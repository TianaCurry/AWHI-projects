XVI PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE . PERMANENT COMMITTEE. 

Senator Henderson, cluiirniiin, made the following report in regard 
to the condition of the various matters under the charge of the com- 
mittee: 

There were no new developments during the year with regard to the Avery fund 
or the Spragne bequest. 

TUK HoncKixs Frxn. 

Progress has been made in the suit of O'Donaghue r. Smith. An appeal was taken 
to the general term from the decision of the trial justice who allowed the verdict in 
favor of the daughter of -Mr. O'Donaghue, wlio was an infant at the time of partition. 
The general term affirmed the action of the justice below, which has caused delay. 
The Smithsonian counsel, Mr. Hackett, is now ready to ]iroceed with the liearing of 
the case. 

During the year the house and lot at Elizaljeth, N. J. has been sold to advantage. 

THE .\XDREWS BEQUEST. 

A preliminary contest is now going on before a referee upon the question whether 
one-half of Mr. Andrews's estate should not go to his heirs by reason of an alleged 
violation of the statutes of 1860, preventing a testator from giving to a charitable cor- 
poration more than one-half of his estate, after payment of debts. Mr. Hackett is of 
the opinion that the Institution's prospects for success continue fair. 

THE REin BEQUEST. 

During the year the Institution was supplied with a copy of the will of the late 
Addison T. Reid, of Brooklyn, N. Y., who died on September 15, 1902. The will 
provides for the payment of the income upon the property to persons named, and 
upon their death, for the payment of the principal of the estate, with accumulations, 
to the Smithsonian. Institution, to found a chair in biology in memory of the testator's

RESOLUTION KELATIVE TO INCOME AND EXPENDITURE. 

Senator Henderson, as chairman of the executive committee, intro- 
duced the following customary resolution: 

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 
1904, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Sec- 
retary with the advice of the executive committee, with full discretion on the part 
of the Secretary as to items. 

On motion the resolution was adopted. 

REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON NEEDS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL 

MUSEUM. 

Senator Piatt, as chairman of the special committee appointed at 
the last annual meeting, submitted the following report: 

The committee of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, appointed 
in accordance with a resolution of the Board ' ' to represent to Congress the pressing 
necessity of additional room for the proper exhibition of specimens belonging to 
the National Museum," have examined the plans prepared under the direction of the 
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in accordance with the provisions of the 
sundry civil appropriation act approved June 28, 1902. 

The committee adopted the following motion: 

"That under the limitations of the law the committee hereby report to Congress 
plan B for a new National ]Museum building as the best obtainable for the amount 
mentioned; but in the judgment of the committee the larger plan A is believed to 
be the one which should be adopted, and we, therefore, ask that Congress shall make 
the appropriation for it instead of for the smaller plan." 

But if an appropriation for the construction of a building upon the larger plan can 
not be made now, the committee respectfully urge upon Congress an approiiriation 
of $1,500,000 to construct that portion of the completed plan shown in Plan B. They 
further represent to Congress the fact that collections of the greatest value are in 
immediate danger of destruction, and are now actually undergoing degeneration in 
the present unsuitable, unsafe, temporary quarters, and that the erection of a new 
building is absolutelv necessary for the preservation of the national collections. 

Respectfully submitted.

After discussion, on motion of Mr. Adams, it was 

Resolved, That the report of the committee be adopted, and that they be instructed 
to proceed to bring the matter to a conclusion by securing an appropriation. 

The Secretary announced the death on September 23, 1902, of Major 
John W. Powell,. Director of the Bureau of Ethnolog}-^, and his 
appointment on October 11, of Mr. William H. Holmes as Chief of 
the Bureau, and made a statement as to the present status of the 
Bureau and its future policy. 



XVIII PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 

He spoke of the work ol' the Zoological Park, of the Bureau of Inter- 
national Exchanges, and of the Astrophysical Observator3\ He also 
spoke of the National Museum's needs, and of the efl'orts being' made 
to secure a new building. He then gave a brief statement of his con- 
nection with the Carnegie Institution. 

The Secretary submitted to the Board a proposition to add $25,000 
of accumulated interest from the unrestricted funds of the Institution 
to the permanent fund, and after an explanation. Senator Henderson 
offered the following resolution: 

Resolved, That the Secretary is hereby authorized to deposit in the Treasury of tlie 
United States, under the terms of section 5-591 of tlie Revised Statutes, as an addition 
to the permanent fund of the Institution, the sum of $25,000 from the unexpended 
balance. 

On motion the resolution was adopted. 

B}' resolution of the Board a special committee of live, consisting of 
the Chancellor, Senators Cullom and Piatt, and Representatives Adams 
and Dinsmore was appointed to consider the question of specitically 
defining the powers of the executive committee, to report at a special 
meeting called for March 12, 1903. 

A special meeting of the Board of Regents was held on jNIarch 12, at 
10 o'clock a. m. 

Present: Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, Chancellor, in the chair: the 
Hon. William P. Frye, the Hon. O. H. Piatt, the Hon. F. M. Cock- 
rell, the Hon. R. R. Hitt, the Hon. Robert Adams, jr., the Hon. Hugh 
A. Dinsmore, the Hon. John B. Henderson, the Hon. George (xray. 
Dr. A. Graham Bell; and the Secretary, Mr. S. P. Langlev. 

The Secretary read letters from Senator Cullom and Doctor Angell, 
stating that their engagements prevented their attendance. He had 
no word from Mr. Olney, who had said, however, at the annual meet- 
ing that it would proba1)Iy I)e impracticable for him to attend on this 
occasion. Doctor White was absent in Europe. 

The Chancellor reported informally upon the duties heretofore dis- 
charged ])y the executive committee. No definite conclusion had been 
reached as to the question of defining the powers of that committee, 
but it was thought desirable that it should hold regular meetings and 
that the Board of Regents should hold two stated meetings in addition 
to the annual meeting pivscribed by law. It was therefore — 

Resolved, That, in addition to the prescribed meeting lielcl on the fourth Wednes- 
day in January, regular meetings of the Board sliall ])e held on the Tuesday after the 
first Monday in Deceml)er and on the 6th day of ISIarch, imless that date falls on 
Sunday, when the following ^londay shall be substituted. 

The special conmiittee was continued, with a request to further 
pursue the examination of the whole subject and to report at the 
December meetino-.

authorized and disburse all appropriations made for the work, and shall receive as 
full compensation for his services hereunder the sum of two thousand dollars annu- 
ally in addition to his present salary, to be paid out of said appropriations. 

Senator Piatt suggested that the Secretar}* be authorized to repre- 
sent the Board of Regents in carrying out the provisions of this clause; 
and, after a very full discussion of the subject, the following resolution 
was adopted: 

Resohed, That the Secretary, with the advice and consent of the Chancellor and 
the Chairman of the Executive Committee, be authorizod to represent the Board of 
Regents so far as may be necessary in consultation with Bernard R. CJreen, to whom 
the construction and contracts for the new Museum building are committed by Con- 
gress in the act making an appropriation for that purpose.

Ilesolced, That the Secretary cause to be prepared a compilation of all laws or parts 
of laws referring to or in any manner affecting the Smithsonian Institution and the

In accordance witli a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted

entire new building- could not be made now the committee would 
respectfully urge upon Congress an appropriation of $1,500,000 to 
construct a portion of the completed plan. The connnittee further 
urged that Congress be advised of the fact that collections of the 
greatest value are in immediate danger of destruction, and are now 
actually undergoing degeneration in the present unsuitable, unsafe, 
temporary quarters, and that the erection of a new building- is abso- 
lutely necessary, for the preservation of the national collections. The 
members of the committee, in addition to the chairman, were Senators 
Cidlom and Cockrell and Representatives Hitt, Adams, and Dinsmore.

Adams and Dinsmore, was appointed to consider the question of 
speciiicalW defining- the powers of the executive connnittee, to report 
at a special meeting- called for March 12, 1903. 

The special meeting was held on March 12, when the Chancellor 
reported informally upon the duties heretofore discharged by the 
executive committee. No definite conclusion had been reached as to 
the question of defining- the powers of that committee, l)ut it was 
thought desirable that it should hold r(>g-ular meeting-s and that the 
Board of Regents should hold two stated meetings in addition to the 
annual meeting prescri))ed ])y law. It was therefore resolved — 

"•That, in addition to the prescribed meeting held on the fourth 
Wednesday in January, regular meetings of the Board shall ])e held 
on the Tuesday after the first Monday in Decemlxn- and on the <5tliday 
of ]\Iarch, luiless that date falls on Sunday, when the following Mon- 
day shall be substituted." 

The special committee was continued, with a re([uest to further 
pursue the examination of the wlioh^ suljject and to report at the 
December meeting. 

Senator Piatt read a clause from the sundry cixil act a[)proved March 



4 EEPOET OF THE SECEETAEY. 

3, 1903, authorizing the liegents to commence the erection of a new 
building for the National Museum, to cost not to exceed $3,500,000, 
and to make contracts for its completion subject to appropriations by 
Congress. Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars was appropriated 
to begin the work, the construction to be in charge of Bernard R. 
Green, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, Library of Congress. 
The resolution adopted })y the Board will be found on page 17, under 
the heading ** National Museum." 

Mr. Bell introduced resolutions providing for appointments under 
the Institution, whicli were referred to the special connnittee already 
existing. 

Upon motion of Senator Cockrell, the Secretary was authorized to 
cause to he prepared a compilation of all laws or parts of laws referring 
to or in any manner affecting the Smithsonian Institution and the 
bureaus under its charge, including all appropriations by Congress for 
its purpose or use. 

Referring to previous action of the Board concerning the removal of 
the remains of James Smithson to this country, Mr. Bell offered to 
bring them to the United States if the Regents would care for them 
thereafter, and after remarks the suggestion was accepted that Mr. 
Bell renew his incjuiry at the next meeting. 

ORGANIZATION OF BOARD OF REGENTS. 

As organized at the end of the fiscal 3'ear, the Board of Regents con- 
sisted of tlie following members: 

The Hon. M. AV. Fuller, Chief .Justice of the United States, Chan- 
cellor; the Hon. W. P. Frye, President pro tempore of the United 
States Senate; Senator S. M. Cullom; Senator O. H. Flatt; Senator 
Francis ]M. Cockrell; Representative R. R. Hitt; Representative Rob- 
ert Adams, jr.; Representative Hugh A. Dinsmore; Dr. James B. 
Angell; Dr. Andrew D. White; the Hon. J. B. Henderson; Prof. A. 
Graham Bell; the Hon. Richard Olney, and the Hon. George Gray. 

ADMINISTRATION. 

The general supervision of the business of the several dependencies 
placed b}^ Congress under the direction of the Institution has year by 
year required my increased attention, although as far as practicable 
the carr3dng out of details has been left to those in innnediate chai:ge 
of the work of the bureaus. 

In view of the great development in the science of ethnologj^ during 
recent years it seemed desirable that the work of the Bureau of Amer- 
ican Ethnolog}^ should be reorganized, and in order that I might have 
full knowledge of the needs of that Bureau a committee was appointed 
to secure detailed information from those engaged in that branch of 
the Institution's activities, and to make reconnnendations l)ascd upon 
the results of theii" o])servati()ns. The committee l)egan this work 
toward the close of the fiscal vear. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5 

BUILDINGS. 

Certain much-needed repairs to the main roof of the Smithsonian 
building- jire in prog-ress, and in thi.s comiection it .seems important to 
again call attention to the necessity of a reconstruction of the ceiling 
and other renovations of the large Anthropological Hall, whose noble 
dimensions deserve a worthier treatment, and of improving the access 
to it. 

In the paragraphs devoted to the Museum and to the Zoological 
Park mention is made of ])uilding improvements during the year. 

FINANCES. 

The permanent funds of tli(^ Institution are as follows: 

Bequest of Sniithsoii, 1846 $.^15, 169. 00 

Residuary legacy of Smithson, 1867 26, 210. 63 

Deposit from savings of income, 1867 108, 620. 37

Total permanent fund 937, 000. 00 

Under the provisions of thc^ act organizing the Institution and the 
act of Congress approved March 12, 1804, the above fund is deposited 
in the Treasury of the United States and bears interest at per cent 
per annum. In addition to the permanent fund, the regents hold 
certain approved railroad bonds, which form part of the fund estab- 
lished b}^ Mr. Hodgkins for investigations into the properties of 
atmospheric air. 

The unexpended balance at the beginning of the fiscal year, Jidy 1, 
1902, as stated in my last report, was $81,120.91. The total receipts 
b}^ the Institution during the year were $67,835.37. Of this sum, 
$56,400 was derived from interest and the remaining $11,435.37 was 
received from miscellaneous sources. 

The disbursements during the year amounted to $93,448.61, the 
details of which are given in the report of the executive committee. 
This amount includes the sum of $25,000 which, in accordance with a 
resolution of the Board of Regents adopted at the last annual meeting, 
was drawn from the current funds and deposited in the Treasury of 
the United States to the credit of the permanent fund. The balance 
remaining to the credit of the Secretary on June 30, 1903, for the 
expenses of the Institution was $55,507.<)7. A considera])le part of

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7 

RESEARCH. 

It was a part of the original plan of the Institution that its Secretary 
should not give his time wholly to administrati^'e duties, but should 
directly aid in its scientitic investigations/' 

Research work in various fields of science has l)een continued by 
the Institution and its dependencies. 

I have made some progress toward the solution of the problem of 
mechanical flight, and have been carrying on, with the consent of the 
Regents, some experiments for the War DepartnuMit, at its expense, 
and am adding other experiments, partly at the expense of the Insti- 
tution. 

In the Astrophysical Observatory I have continued work believed 
to be important, and inaugurated some experiments of novel interest, 
which are referred to later. 

Through the Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology the 
Institution has been enabled to carr}^ on various biological and ethno- 
logical researches, which will be found fully described elsewhere in 
this report and need not l)e repeated here. 

HODGKINS FUND. 

Reports giving the final results of some important investigations 
which have been prosecuted by the aid of the Hodgkins fund and 
others, giving the details of the progress of researches still incomplete, 
have been received. Several of these memoirs have already been 
issued by the Institution, and others are in course of publication. 

The second memoir by Dr. Carl Barus, referred to in my last report 
as supplementary to the investigation on ionized air, has been pub- 
lished as one of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, under 
the title "The Structure of the Nucleus." Questions necessarily left 
outstanding in the first memoir are answered in the second, the two 
volumes forming together a valuable contribution to the literature of 
the subject. 

The thermometric researches of Prof. M. W. Travers, of University 
College, London, have been reported on in a memoir entitled "On 
the Attainment of Very Low Temperatures," which' is now in course 
of publication. It is the design of Professor Travers to prosecute his 
investigation still further, and the question of another grant for the 
purpose has been submitted for consideration. 

The research on vacuum spectroscopy, by Dr. Victor Schumann, of 
Leipzig, has been reported on in detail in a memoir soon to be issued 
as one of the Contributions to Knowledge. The special apparatus, 

(i Resolved, That the Secretary continue his researches in physical science, and pre- 
sent such facts and principles as may be developed for publication in the Smithsonian 
contributions. (Adopted at meeting of the Board of Regents January 26, 1847.) 



8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

which has been ])<)th designed and eons tr acted ))y Doctor Schumann 
for conductino- this advanced and difficult research, is described in his 
report. The interest among specialists in this investigation has been 
so general that the Institution has permitted Doctor Schumann to pub- 
lish without delay significant discoveries made in the course of his 
experiments, on the condition of announcing them at the same time to 
the Institution and mentioning the relation of his work to the Hodg- 
kins fund. 

InFebruar}', 11K)3, Prof, E. W. Scripture, of Yale University, whose 
special researches relative to speech or phonetics have called attention 
to his work, received a Hodgkins grant for the construction of a 
"vowel machine," which, when perfected, he hopes will be equivalent 
to devising a perfect vox humana stop for the organ, which maj' 
replace the one now in use. In accordance with the rule of the insti- 
tution the application for this grant was referred for an opinion to 
the highest accessible authority before approval. 

A grant in form of a su])scription for a specified number of copies 
of the journal Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity 
has been again approved, it ])eing apparent that the puljlication is of 
service to the specialists and educational estal)lisliments that have been 
placed on the list to receive it through the Institution. 

An}' general allotment of the income from the Hodgkins fund is 
precluded ])y the terms of the be(pu>st, but it may be again repeated 
that every request for such assistance receives attention, and an 
application by an in^'estigator who is able to comply with the con- 
ditions established in accordance with the will of the donor is sure of 
serious consideration. 

NAPLES TABLE. 

The contract for the Smithsonian Table in the Naples Zoological 
Station, which was extended from June 30, 1902, through December 
of that year, lias been again renewed for one year from January 1, 1902. 

The applications for the Smithsonian seat have been so numerous 
and so urgent that the Institution felt called on to engage another table 
for a pai't of the 3'ear. This, however, Doctor Dohrn could not arrange 
for, but with his. usual kindness he promised in any event to accom- 
modate all the Smithsonian appointees. He has not onh^ done this, 
but in several instances has exceeded the requests of the Institution. 
During the period from March 1 till Jul}' 1, 1003, the table had con- 
stantly two occupants. It should be added that whenever the dates of 
applications interfered with each other the approval of the Secretary 
was accorded, with the understanding that the tenure of the seat should 
be siibject to such modification as might be suggested by the Director 
of the Station, 

Dr. C. W. Prentiss, of Harvard University, whose application for 
an extension of his occupancy was noted in my last report, remained 



EEPOBT OF THE SECRETARY. 9 

at the Station on the invitation of Doctor Dolirn, i)ending' a decision as 
to the renewal of the Smithsonian lease. His occupanc}^ was after- 
wards extended until August 1, making a session of live consecutive 
months. Preliminary mention of his research has been received from 
Doctor Prentiss, in which he speaks of the exceptional opportunities 
afforded at Naples for obtaining valuable living material for his 
researches. 

During the summer of 190:^ Dr. T. H. Morgan, of Bryn Mawr 
College, hlled another short appointment at the table, and has since 
transmitted to the Institution copies of two published memoirs detail- 
ing the results of his work. 

Dr. C. M. Child, of the University of Chicago, occupied the Smith- 
sonian seat from July 1 till December 81, 1902. His report, which 
indicates briefly the results of his work without extended discussion, 
is to be published in the first quarterl}^ issue of the Smithsonian Mis- 
cellaneous Collections, together with the other papers which have been 
submitted, in accordance with the request of the Institution, for this 
purpose by those who have recently occupied the Smithsonian seat. 

Dr. C. S. Minot, of Harvard University, who filled an appointment 
from October 15 till December 15, 1902, reports that his time at Naples 
was devoted to procuring series of embr3'os of Torpedo ocellata^ Jfi/s- 
telus laevis, Petromyzon^ and Amj)htoxu-'<, and also ^^ouiig specimens of 
Pristi'urus and Scylllum. Doctor Minot also refers to the ample 
resources of the Station, which enabled him to obtain fine series in 
carefully selected stages of development. These specimens have been 
arranged in serial sections and placed in the Hai'vard embryological 
collection, where they will be open to all competent investigators and 
will serve for many years for studies in comparative embryology. 

Prof. F. M. MacFarland, of Leland Stanford Junior University, 
occupied the Table for five months from November 1, 1902. This was 
Professor MacFarland's second term of occupancy, he having been 
appointed to the seat for three months in the spring and summer of 
1896. 

Dr. C. B. Davenport, of the Ihiiversity of Chicago, held the seat for 
parts of November and December, 1902. In a report promptly sub- 
mitted at the termination of his occupancy, Doctor Davenport sa^^s 
that during his short period at Naples he made an investigation into 
the development of the color pattern and specific markings of the shell 
of Pecten jaeohaeiis^ P. varius^ and P. pusio^ having also gathered 
materials for a quantitative variation study of the shells of this 
species. 

Prof. C. W. Hargitt, of Syracuse Universit}', the approval of wdiose 
application was necessarily postponed awaiting a decision as to the 
renewal of the lease, received the appointment for March, April, and 
May of the current year, during which time he completed a research 



10 EEPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 

on the early development of Pkidendrinni. A brief summary of the 
work of Doctor Hargitt lias l>een received and will appear in the first 
quarterly issue of the Smithsonian jVIiscellaneous Collections. A 
more detailed report is to be published later in the Zoologisches 
Jahrbuch. 

Dr. C H. Bardeen, associate professor of anatomy in Johns Hopkins 
University, occupied the Smithsonian seat during- the months of April, 
May, and June, 1903, for the purpose of makino- experimental inves- 
tigations in enil)ryological development. 

In view of the exceptional opportunity for special research afforded 
at the Naples Station, which is frequently mentioned appreciatively 
in the reports sul)niitted by the appointees of the Institution, the Sec- 
retary^ is glad to have found it practicable to renew again the lease of 
the Smithsonian Table, which he hopes on the expiration of the present 
contract to be in a position to extend for another term of years. 

The submission })y a Smithsonian appointee of a brief summary of 
the work done at Naples is an appreciated courtes}', but it may be 
again stated that should an investigator desire to publish the results of 
his work on his own responsibility, a copy of his memoir has always 
been deemed sufficient for the purpose of the Institution, which is 
chiefly to make suitable reference in the annual report to the often 
noteworthy work of those occupying the Smithsonian seat. 

It may be said that while the summary of the scientific history of 
an applicant, which it is customary to submit with a request for an 
appointment, is often unnecessary as a means of acquainting the Insti- 
tution with the work of an investigator, such a sketch is of service in 
completing the files of the Institution relative to each appointee, and 
an abstract of the data thus submitted is transmitted to Doctor Dohrn, 
with each notice of an approved application, for the files of the zoo- 
logical station. 

Dr. T. H. Morgan, of Bryn Mawr, who has several times filled vacan- 
cies caused by the absence of members of the advisory committee, 
courteously consented again to supply the place of Prof. E. B. Wilson, 
during liis absence in Europe from February till September, 1903. 
With this exception the personnel of the committee has been unchanged 
during the year. It gives me pleasure to record again my apprecia- 
tion of the aid rendered me l)y the committee in all questions relating 
to appointments to the Smithsonian table. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

The Institution has continued to carry on various biological and 
ethnological explorations through the medium of the National Museum 
and the Bureau of American Ethnology, and has also cooperated with 
the Executive Departments in these directions. The details of most 
of these explorations are given in the paragraphs devoted to the sev- 
eral bureaus. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11 

PUBLICATIONS. 

Tlio Institution issued during tlie year a total of 45,506 volumes or 
separates of the series of Contributions, Miscellaneous Collections, 
lieports, and publications not included in the regular series." The 
document division received for action a total of 8,522 letters and cards 
of acknowledgment. 

In the publications of the Institution the double aim of its founder 
is represented, in that it should exist for (1) the "increase" and (2) the 
"diffusion" of knowledge. 

The recording of results of original researches, the " increase " of 
knowledge, is chiefly through the series of Contributions to Knowledge, 
a quarto work begun in 1S4S, and in which more than 140 valuable 
memoirs, collected in 82 volumes, have so far been pu])lished. There 
has been added to this series during the year a memoir of 190 pages by 
Dr. Carl Barus on the Structure of the Nucleus, a continuation of his 
experiments with ionized air, which w^ere described in a memoir pub- 
lished during the previous year. 

In the present investigation the author answers certain practical 
questions suggested b}" his last memoir in relation to phosphorus wdien 
used as a source of nuclei; i. e., of extremely small particles tending 
to precipitate water from moist air when this is suddenl}^ cooled. It 
is, however, the chief aim of the memoir to throw light on the phe- 
nomena connected with the presence of nuclei in air by aid of the coro- 
nas or color rings se^n in such air when its moisture is condensed and 
deposited on the nuclei and a distant source of light is looked at 
through the turbid medium. As these coronas occur in great variety 
and size they lend themselves to measurement when other means fail, 
A systematic stud}- is therefort> made at the outset of the number of 
particles corresponding to all well-defined members of the sequence of 
coronas obtained under known conditions of supersaturated air. The 
naml)ers run from less than 100 to upward of 50,000 per cubic centi- 
meter. 

The results are then applied in an endeavor to find the velocity of 
the nucleus by nonelectrical methods, both of a direct and an indirect 
kind, utDizing the fact that if nuclei leave the medium the coronas 
ol>tained under like conditions must change correspondingly, Thn >ugh- 
out the latter part of the investigation the nuclei are purposely pro- 
duced in the simplest manner possible, by shaking solutions in air; 
but in the course of the investigation the author reaches conclusions 
which seem to show that the solutional nucleus is of much broader 
meteckrological significance in its bearing on atmospheric condensation 
and electricity than has heretofore been anticipated. It appears that 

« Contributions to Knowledge, 1,983; Miscellaneon.s Collections, 11,667; Reports,

12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

in an unbounded region of the atmosplnu'e .saturated witli water this 
nucleus must be a persistent structure. This he linds is strikingly 
apparent even when the air is saturated with ver}^ volatile liquids other 
than water. 

In conclusion, the author points out that the size of the nucleus must 
vary with the medium in which it is suspended, and that water nuclei 
in particular will depend for their dimensions on the meteorological 
status of the atmosphere. Finall}', the importance of correlating this 
variation of nuclear diameter with the electrical activity of the water 
nucleus is insisted on, with a view to its possible application to atmos- 
pheric electricity. 

A memoir liy Dr. Victor Schumann on the absorption and emis- 
sion of air and its ingredients for light of wave lengths from 250 /<// 
to 100 yUyW was put in type during the year, but the presswork was not 
completed. 

This memoir, which forms the concluding part of Volume XXIX 
of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, gives an account of 
researches, aided by grants from the Hodgkins fund, on the emission 
and absor2)tion of the gases of atmospheric air in the ultraviolet 
spectrum. Within the last fifteen years our knowledge of I'adiation 
has been greatly increased, and now eml)races wide ranges of the 
spectrum heretofore unknown. Without assigning an}" place to the 
numerous kinds of "rays" whose discovery has been associated in the 
public mind first with the work of Kxintgen and later with that of the 
Curies, I am speaking here rather of the extensions of the spectrum 
in wave lengths which are actually measurable and known. Thus 
beyond the red the spectrum has now been studied in practical conti- 
nuity to a wave length of nearly 100 microns; and at a great remove 
be3'ond this is another known region embracing the so-called Hertzian 
or electric waves now employed in wireless telegraphy. Be3^ond the 
violet progress has been, relativeh^ speaking, less rapid, unless, indeed, 
it shall prove that the liontgen and other radiations fall in this region. 
But a great step in advance has been made by the unwearied investi- 
gations of the author of the present work. Doctor Schumann. 

The difiiculties hindering research in the ultraviolet are great and 
consist chiefiy in the opacity of the usual optical media to the short 
wave-length rays. Quartz, for a long time considered best in this 
part of the spectrum, is found to be too opaque, and has been largely 
superseded in Doctor Schumann's investigations ])y fluorspar for 
prisms and plates. Air, even in layers of a few millimeters' thick- 
ness, is almost wholly opaque, and other gases absorb strongly. It 
has, therefore, been necessary to emplo}^ a spectroscope from which 
the air is exhausted' to the highest practicable degree; and this and 
other necessary apparatus Doctor Schumann has designed and con- 
structed with his own hands, though aided ly grants from the Hodg- 
kins fund of the Smithsonian Institution. 



REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 13 

The ineinoir contains an account of the special apparatus and 
method of using it, and continues with a description of the emission 
and absorjjtion spectra of oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon monox- 
ide and dioxide and aqueous vapor for wave lengths, reaching in the 
case of hydrogen to about 0.10 micron. Illustrations of the apparatus 
and spectra accompany the text, and it is thought the whole will be a 
valuable contribution to knowledge, though but preliminar}^ to the 
researches Doctor Schumann alone is continuing in this spectral 
region. 

The Institution has accepted, for publication in the Contributions 
to Knowledge, a memoir by Dr. Frederick W. True, entitk^d "The 
whalebone whales of the western North Atlantic, compared with those 
occurring in European waters, with some observations on the species 
of the North Pacific." This memoir will make a volume of al)out 200 
pages of text, accompanied ])y about 50 full-page plates illustrating 
the anatomy and habits of the various species described. 

For manj^ years I have had a liope of preparing for publication a work 
consisting essentially of photographic views of the moon so complete 
and, it was expected (with the advance of photography), so minute, 
that the features of our satellite might l)e studied b}' the geologist and 
the selenographer nearly as well as by the astronomer at the telescope. 
This hope has been disappointed, for photography, which has made 
such eminent advances in the reproduction of nebulas and other celes- 
tial features, has stood comparatively still in lunar work. We indeed 
have far better views than were obtained by Rutherford, but the ver}- 
best even of the admirable ones recently procured b}' Professor 
Ritchey at the Yerkes Ol^servatory have proved so far behind what 
the eye can directly discern with the telescope that the expectation 
that such a work could be advantageously published has been, after a 
great deal of labor and preparation for many years, most reluctantly 
al)andoned. During the past 3'ear, however, a memoir has been sul)- 
mitted to the Institution by Prof. N. S. Shaler, of Cambridge, entitled 
"A Comparison of the Filatures of the Earth and the Moon." It will 
be published with some of the best illustrations gathered for the for- 
mer purpose, and about 25 of these illustratioHis of the moon's surface, 
including many of the photogniphs taken by Professor Ritchey, will 
form a prominent feature. The work will prol)a]>ly appear in the 
early part of the ensuing year. 

In 18()4 the Institution published in the series of Contributions to 
Knowledge a memoir hy Prof. Henry Draper on the Construction of 
a Silvered Glass Telescope. The book has long been out of print, and 
as there seemed to be a present demand for a new edition arrange- 
ments have been made for its reissue, accomj^anied by an article l>y a 
competent hand bringing the sul)ject to date. 

To the sei'ies of Miscellaneous Collections two short papers were 



14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

added during the year, and several papers were accepted and progress 
made toward their publication. Among the accepted papers may be 
mentioned an Index to the Literature of Thorium, 1817-1902, by 
Dr. Cavalier H. Joiiet; a Second Supplement to Select Bibliography 
of Chemistry, b}^ Dr. H. C. Bolton, bringing the subject down to close 
of the year 1902; Researches on the Attainment of Yer}^ Low Tem- 
peratures, by Prof. Morris W. Travers, of University College, Lon- 
don, and a paper by Dr. Amadeus W. Grabau, on the phylogeny or 
tribal history of Fusus and its allies, being a very complete description 
of the various fossil and recent genera and species classed by conchol- 
ogists under the name Fusus. 

Among the proposed publications ma^' be mentioned an elaborate 
work by the late Dr. G. Brown Goode on "What has been done in 
America for Science." Doctor Goode left the manuscript nearly com- 
pleted, and arrangements have been made to bring it to date and to 
put it in condition for printing. 

The revised edition of the Smithsonian Physical Tables, issued in 
1897, having become exhausted, and the demand continuing, a second 
edition was printed in January, 1903. 

Arrangements have been made for a (piarterly issue of the Smithsonian 
Miscellaneous Collections in order to afford a medium for the prompt 
publication of brief accounts of the results of researches by the Insti- 
tution and its bureaus, especially those of a preliminary nature, 
together with such notices concerning the Institution and its activities 
as may be of general public interest. Each issue will consist of about 
140 pages of text and will be amply illustrated. The quarterly issue 
will supplement, not replace, the regular series of the Miscellaneous 
Collections. 

Mention has heretofore been made of the character of papers pub- 
lished in the General Appendix of the Regents' Report to Congress. 
This report, to which I have given much personal care, is the only 
Smithsonian publication issued in large numbers, and 3^et the popular 
demand for it is far in excess of the edition of 12,000 copies authorized 
by law. The volume for 1901 was received from the Public Printer 
early in the autunm of 1902 and in a very few weeks ever}^ available 
copy was distributed. It is desirable that a larger edition should be 
authorized. 

The manuscript for the 1902 report was sent to the Public Printer 
in May, 1903, and most of it was in type before June 30. 

Besides the above pul)lications of the Institution itself a large num- 
ber of works on anthropological, biological, and geological subjects, 
issued by the National Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology, 
are referred to in detail in appendices to this report. There was also 
sent to press a report by the Astrophysical Observatory on the solar 
eclipse expedition of 1900. The Secretary of the Institution received 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15 

and submitted to Congress, in accordance with their acts of incorpo- 
ration, the annual reports of the American Historical Association and 
of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution. 

LIBRARY. 

The accessions to the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress 
during the year were 1,848 volumes, 21,282 parts of volumes, 3,804 
pamphlets, and 379 charts, or a total of 27,313, being an increase of 
675 over the previous year, and extending the accession numbers of 
the Smithsonian deposit to 452,465. The libraries of the Secretar}^, 
Office and of the Astrophysical Observatory show an increase of 409 
volumes, pamphlets, and charts, and 1,625 parts of volumes, making 
the total Smithsonian library accessions of the year 29,347. The 
serial publications entered on the card catalogue number 24,630. 

Gen. John Watts De Pe3^ster has added to his large collection of 
books and pamphlets relating to Napoleon Bonapai'te, and has also pre- 
sented a collection of works on g3'psies, a collection of dictionaries and 
enc3'clopedias, many of which are very rare, besides several portraits, 
pictures, and paintings. 

The National Museum library now contains 19,161 bound volumes 
and 32,063 unbound papers. The accessions during the year were 
3,161 books, 3,260 pamphlets, and 303 parts of volumes, which include 
two important gifts — the E. A. Schwarz collection of books on Ameri- 
can Coleoptera and the W. H. Dall collection of books on recent and 
fossil mollusks. The librarian refers to these gifts in some detail in his 
report in the Appendix. 

The Institution has continued to aid in the maintenance of the Inter- 
national Catalogue of Scientific Literature, and a total of 14,480 ref- 
erences were furnished to the central bureau during the vear. Five 
volumes of the Catalogue were received and distributed. 

CORRESPONDENCE. 

The correspondence of the Secretary's office embraces not onh^ com- 
munications referring to the work of the Institution proper, l)ut also 
to the National Museum, the International Exchanges, the Bureau of 
American Ethnology, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro- 
physical Observatory. 

Subjects of inquir}' })y correspondents are perhaps more Aaricnl and 
embi'ace a wider range of topics than obtains in other departments of 
the Government, yet all are promptly answered. 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

JIamilto7i fund. — I have given consideration to the difficult subject 
of the useful disposition of the small Hamilton fund, the income of 



16 REPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

which it is hoped to apply to a biennial lecture, but no arranovments 
have yet been perfected for its delivery. 

Gifts. — Among- the gifts received by the Institution during- the year 
may be mentioned a large oil painting, ''The March of Time,'" pre- 
sented l)}^ the artist, Mr. Henry Sandhani, representing many of the 
principal generals of the civil war. 

Louisiana Parehase Exposition. — Congress having made an appro- 
priation for a (xovernment building and exhibit at the exposition to 
be held in St. Louis in 1904, the Secretary has appointed Doctor True 
to represent the Institution and its bureaus in the preparation and 
installation of its exhibits. 

Congress of Ainericanists. — Mr. F. W. Hodge was delegated to 
represent the Institution at the thirteenth session of the International 
Congress of Americanists, held at New York, October 20-25, 1902. 
The session was successful in every respect; many foreign govern- 
ments and institutions of learning in Europe and throughout the 
American Continent were represented, and the communications pre- 
sented covered the entire field of aboriginal American history, anthro- 
pology, ethnology, archasolog}^, and linguistics. 

C 'ongressof Orientalists. — Prof. Paul Haupt, LL. D., honorary cura- 
tor of the division of historic archaeology in the United States National 
Museum, attended the Thirteenth International Congress of Orientalists 
as delegate of the Smithsonian Institution, This congress, which was 
held at Hamburg, German}^, from September 1 to September 10, 1902, 
was organized in eight sections: I, Indo-European Linguistics; 11% 
India; \V\ Iran; III, Indo-China and Oceania; IV, Central Asia and 
the Far East; V, Semitic; VI, Islam; VII% Egyptian; VII% African; 
VIII, Relations between Orient and Occident (including Byzantine 
studies). At first it was proposed to have a special colonial section, 
but this idea was afterwards al)andoned owing to the fact that a special 
colonial congress was held at Berlin in October, 1902. The Hamburg- 
congress, which was attended b}" more than 600 mem])ers from all 
parts of the globe, resolved to depart from the practice of printing the 
transactions in full and to pul)lish onl}^ a volume of proceedings, includ- 
ing abstracts of all the papers presented and the subsequest discus- 
sions, to be issued within half a year after adjournment. This volume 
has as yet not appeared. The next congress will be held at Algiers in 
April, 1905. 

NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

An important epoch in the history of the National Museum has 
occurred during the past .year, when, by act of March 3, 1903, Con- 
gress provided for the erection of an additional building, to cost not to 
exceed $3,500,000. 

The present building- was completed in Ls.sl and was erected })ri- 



REPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 17 

iiuirily to accommodate the mass of objects received by the Government 
from the International Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876, these objects 
having' been in storage for several years. The present building was 
cheapl}^ erected and Avas not expected to uicet the requirements of a 
great national museum, and Secretary Baird soon found it necessary to 
present to Congress the question of constructing a more adequate one; 
and already in 1888, in my early incumbency, this was represented 
to the Regents. Although Congress at various times during- the past 
twenty 3'ears has had the matter under consideration, definite action 
was not taken by both Senate and House. During tlie first session of 
the last Congress, however, a small appropriation was made for prepa- 
ration of plans for a new building, as 1 stated in my last report. 
Preliminary plans were submitted to Congress at its last session and 
authority has been granted to the Regents of the Institution to proceed 
in the construction of an additional building, to contain about 10 acres 
of floor space, or treble that we have at present, which will be worth}'^ 
to accommodate the great collections of the nation. 
The law reads as follows: 

" Building for National Museum: To enable the Regents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution to commence the erection of a suitable fireproof 
building with granite fronts, for the use of the National JNIuseum, to 
be erected on the north side of the Mall, between Ninth and Twelfth 
streets northwest, substantially in accordance with Plan A, prepared 
and submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution under the provisions of the act approved June twenty-eighth, 
nineteen hundred and two, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 
Said building complete, including heating and ventilating" apparatus and 
elevators, shall cost not to exceed three million five hundred thousand 
dollars, and a contract or contracts for its completion is hereby author- 
ized to be entered into, subject to appropriations to be made by Congress. 
The construction shall be in charge of Bernard R. Green, Superintend- 
ent of Buildings and Grounds, Library of Cono-ress, who shall make 
the contracts herein authorized and disburse all appropriations made 
for the work, and shall receive as full compensation for his services 
hereunder the sum of two thousand dollars annually in addition to his 
present salar}', to be paid out of said appropriations." 

The Regents, at their meeting of March 12, adopted the following- 
resolution: 

'''' Resolved^ That the Secretary, with the advice and consent of the 
Chancellor and the chairman of the executive committee, be author- 
ized to I'epresent the Board of Regents, so far as may be necessary, in 
consultation with Bernard R. Cireen, to whom the construction and 
contracts for the new Museum building are committed by Congress in 
the act making an appropriation for that purpose." 

The final plans for the new structure were commenced toward the 

close of the fiscal 3"ear, and the construction will be pushed as rapidly 

as is consistent with the magnitude of the work. It has been decided 

to locate the building on the northern side of the Smithsonian Park, 

sai 1903 2 



18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

facing the present Smithsonian and Museum l)uildings, though at a 
distance of several hundred feet. It will be a fireproof building with 
granite front and will have about 500 feet frontage and ])e about 330 
feet deep, with four stories, including the basement. The main and 
second floors will be used for exhibition halls, while the basement and 
third floors will serve for laboratory" and storage purposes. 

I have great pleasure in recording this final result of the reconnnen- 
dations of the Regents and their Secretary and of the good will of 
Congress. 

The year shows marked progress in nearly every brancli of the 
Museum. Two hundred and thirty-six thousand specimens were 
received, making the present total over 5,050,000, and there were dis- 
tributed to educational establishments about 33,000 objects. Letters 
requesting information show an increase of about 25 per cent in num- 
ber, and nearly 900 lots of specimens were received for identiflcation. 
The distribution of publications also shows an increase over previous 
3^ears, and to the library some valuable collections of books on spe- 
cial zoological subjects have been added. 

Among the anthropological accessions during th(^ year I may men- 
tion some interesting specimens illustrating the native arts and 
industries of Sumatra and the Straits Settlements, collected by Dr. 
AA'. L. Al)bott; a large ethnological collection from the Philippines, 
furnishing information regarding the life and customs of the natives 
of those islands; a number of bronzed wooden images representative 
of Buddhist religious art, a series of models of United States war ves- 
sels, and of land and naval ordnance; and some relics of General and 
Mrs. Grant of much intrinsic and historic interest, presented by their 
children. 

The Ijiological and geological departments of the Museum also 
received valuable additions, which are enumerated in the report of the 
Assistant Secretary, where will also be found details in regard to 
explorations and researches conducted under direction of the Museum. 

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOCxY. 

Researches among the American Indians have been contimied by the 
Bureau as outlined in the plan of operations submitted June 30, 1!H)2, 
and approved by me May 23, 1003. 

The earlier part of the (fiscal) j'ear was marked by the death of ^laj. 
John V\\ Powell, and in October Mr. W. H. Holmes was appointed 
his successor. 

Major Powell was born March 2-1, 1S31, and died September 23, 
1902. He organized the Bureau of Ethnology and under the general 
direction of the Institution carried on its researches until his death. 



REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 19 

The Story of his well-tilled life has been told I)}' others; he was too 
near and too dear a friend for nie, perhaps, to speak of it With a 
wholly impartial judgment, but I am glad to belieye that I, too, had 
acquired his friendship and that this mutual feeling colored all our 
relations. 

Major Powell, who had taken his part in the great eyents of our 
ciyilw"ar( where he seryed as captain of artiller}- under Grant at Vicks- 
burg) and who liad lost an arm in his country's seryice, w'as tirst 
known to me, as to many others, by one of tlie most remarkable feats 
of exploration left for anyone to accomplish. 

The old Spanish explorer, Coronado, who in 1540 penetrated to what 
is now known as the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, came back with 
the story of a crack in the earth at the bottom of which the great 
tower of the cathedral of Seyille would seem no bigger than a man. 
This w^as set down as a trayeler's tale. 

In this unexplored region the Colorado Kiyer. howeyer, was found 
to flow for nearl}^ 1,000 miles through scenery unequaled on this 
globe, for during a great part of its course it is l)ounded by walls over 
a mile in altitude, at the bottom of which the unknown stream descends 
with frequent falls through a channel from which there is no escape 
except b}^ climbing the nearly impassable precipices w^hich shut it in. 
The riyer is the only road, and its entire course al)ounds in hourly 
perils. This was the scene of Major Powell's exploration in 1807, which, 
though conducted for pureh" scientific purposes, j^et, considering all 
that it involyed, may be called one of heroic adventure, w^hile the skill 
which overcame every difficulty was not less conspicuous than the 
courage of the leader, who, maimed as he was, fought with constant 
physical perils, but came through safel}^ together with those who had 
trusted their lives to his guidance. None of his sul)sequent distin- 
guished scientific life will ever eft'ace the memory of this splendid 
feat. It is one which surpasses in all its eleiients of interest and 
danger, perhaps, the work of any such explorer of modern times. 

I leave to more competent hands the description of the great and 
notable work in geology and ethnology which occupied Major Powell's 
later life, and only add a few words on some qualities of the man 
best known to an intimate friend. 

I have b(^en with Major Powell in the life of the city and in the 
life of the wilderness, and wherever 1 lune been with him I think 1 
have been more impressed with tlie simplicity and self-comprised 
nature of his character than even with the complexit}" of his knowl- 
edge and achievements. Besides his splendid capacity for leadership 
in battle and adventure, besides his varied knowledge as a scientific 
man, the mystery of this world, which pure science so little recog- 
nizes, was always present to Major Powell's mind; the lapse of ages, 



20 KErORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

the wonderful ])irth of species, the path that threaded past time on 
and lip to man — all these things were present to his thought and 
colored his work, were always associated with what he did as a man of 
science, and constituted his innermost point of view. 

He w^as a generous man, kind to others and helpful; a brave and 
always a self-contained man who found in himself counsel sufficient 
for his need. He was a stoic who suffered long 3"ears of pain in 
silence, and who, at the end, met the approach of death as though it 
were a familiar incident of life. We shall not often look upon his like. 

In the past year's work of the Bureau scientific researches among 
Indian tribes in the fiekl, in documentary investigations, and in labo- 
ratory and general office routine have been pursued with the usual 
effectiveness. S3"stematic field woric has been successfully prosecuted 
in many States and Territories and in San Domingo and Porto Kico. 
Six members of the staff have spent periods of greater or less extent 
in the field and have secured materials for embodiment in reports. 
These researches have furnished data bearing more or less fully upon 
numerous branches of the science of man, including tribal classifica- 
tion and history, languages, religions, social systems, arts and indus- 
tries, aesthetics, and welfare. 

A principal feature of the year's work has been the taking up, with 
renewed vigor, of the preparation of the dictionary of Indian tribes, 
which had been on hand for a number of years. The plan contem- 
plates the pu])lication of two octavo volumes, Avhich shall embody in 
compact form the great bod}" of information gathered during the past 
years regarding the American race, its linguistic families, tribes, vil- 
lages, individuals, and history, and make more evident the great utili- 
ties of the Bureau's work. The first volume was practically ready for 
the press at the close of the year, but to my regret the resolution pro- 
viding for the issue of the work in octavo form did not reach a vote 
during the session of Congress, and the manuscript was not transmit- 
ted to the printer. 

The reading of proofs of reports in press, the preparation of illus- 
trations for forthcoming volimies, and the photographing of visiting 
Indians have gone on as usual. 

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES. 

The International Exchange Service of the Institution is the medium 
for exchange of publications between the principal governments and 
scientific institutions and libraries of the world. Every vear shows 
an increase over the work accomplished during the previous year. 
During the past year the total number of packages handled .showed an 



HEPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 21 

increase of 19 per cent over the 3' ear 1901-2, and the weight an increase 
of 41 per cent. Seventy-five per cent of the weight represents i)ack- 
ages sent aljroad and 25 per cent the weight of packages received from 
foreign countries. 

The total nunilljer of correspondents or beneficiaries of the facilities 
of the exchange service at home and a])road aggregates 11,012, of which 
13,121 are foreign institutions, 21,332 foreign individuals, 3,319 domes- 
tic institutions, and 6,210 domestic individuals. 

In 1901 Congress increased from 50 to ()2 the number of sets of 
oflScial documents of this country to be exchang'ed w^ith foreign coun- 
tries, and provided for a further increase to 100 sets when deemed 
expedient in the judgment of the Lil)rarian of Congress. Thus far, 
however, the institution has been called on to transmit through its 
exchange service only 12 parts of sets to foreign exchanges, thus 
leaving 12 full sets actually provided for and 26 additional sets, or 
such parts thereof as may be deemed necessary, still available for 
exchange with other countries. 

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK. 

The collection of animals housed and cared for in the National 
Zoological Park continues to increase in interest and value, and in 
order to adequatel}^ provide for it new buildings for special groups of 
animals need to be erected. During the past 3'ear an elephant house 
has been built, which, owing to the limited appropriation, can only be 
spoken of as a considerable improvement over the temporary (|uarters 
previously occupied. 

It is expected that the funds provided under the general appropria- 
tion for the present year will permit the commencement of the con- 
struction of a house for small manunals, which is the next most 
important need. 

As the number of buildings in the park increases it becomes neces- 
sar}^ to consider a method of heating them in an eii'ective and econom- 
ical manner. At present each separate building has its own heating 
apparatus, each requiring the employment of a special set of men for 
its care and management. It would conduce to economy both in fuel 
and in service if all the' buildings in the park lying within a reason- 
able radius could be heated from a central heating plant, which could 
be managed by a single set of men. 

Considerable additions to the collection have been made during the 
year through the public spirit of Dr. F. W. Coding, United States 
consul at Newcastle, New South Wales, who has sent more than 140 
specimens of the unusually interesting fauna of that region. This 
shows in a remarkable manner what can be done by our officers abroad 



22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

who are fully awake to the needs of our national collection and are 
willing to devote some of their time to its enrichment. 

I have repeatedly called attention to the wasteful destruction of 
Alaskan fauna, and am gratified to sa}" that the last Congress passed 
an act for its protection, so that it may ])e reasonably expected that 
the wholesale slaughter of these interesting animals ma}' l)e checked. 
A clause of the act permits the Smithsonian Institution to procure 
specimens for its use. 

The Zoological Park was declared by Congress to ])e for the advance- 
ment of science and the instruction and recreation of the people. It 
has hitherto more largelj" fultilled the second object, Init in pursuance 
of the special scientific activities of the park I hope that there may be 
established at an early date a pathological laboratory, where nuich may 
be learned of the diseases of animals and their rehitions to those that 
affect the human famil}^. Such a useful laboratory can be erected at 
a very moderate cost. 

The growth of the city in the vicinity of the National Zoological 
Park has finally caused a definitive establishment of streets. These do 
not in all cases conform to the boundaries of the park, which therefore 
abuts at several places upon the backyards of neighboring residences. 
This will undoubtedly cause unsightly l)orders unless some means is 
taken to prevent it. 1 have given a full discussion of this subject in 
m}^ report for the years ending June 30, lSi».5, and June 30, l<S*,Hi. 
The evil has increased rather than diminished, and I would recom- 
mend that action ))e taken by Congress to remedy this condition by 
purchasing sufficient land to extend the park to the nearest neighbor- 
ing street throughout its entire boundary. 

THE ASTROPHYSK^IL OBSERVATORY. 

Bolographic studies of the spectrum of the sun and the i)rovision of 
a large horizontal telescope to be used for studies of special portions 
of the solar radiation have been the distinguishing features of the work 
of the Astroplu'sical Observatory during the past yeai'. Results of 
uncommon interest have l)een reached in the bolographic work of the 
past twehe months, and especially in tlie studies of the a})sorption of 
the solar rays by our atmosphere, as appears in the detailed report of 
the aid acting in charge, which ma}" be found in the Appendix. 

Briefly this has shown that the earth's atmosphere, so far as it can 
be observed here, has been more opaque than usual within the present 
calendar year, so mudh so as to reduce the din^-t radiation of the sun 
at the earth's surface by about l" per cent, on the average, through- 
out the whole visible and infra-red spectrum, and l)y more than doulJe 
this amount in the blue and ^'iolet portions of the spectrum. This 



■REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23 

alteration of the transparenc}' of the air has not, however, l)een con- 
fined to the region of Washington. 

Another interesting observation is that determinations of the i-ate of 
solar radiation outside the earth's atmosphere might appear to indicate 
thatther(> has been adeerease of the solar radiation itself since March ^6, 
1003; Imt I refer to this with hesitation, as I have elsewhere observed 
that it is scarcely possible to be ciu-tain of the accuracy of results of 
this sort when based oii observations near sea level. The value of a 
solar observatory at a high altitude, to which 1 referred last year, can 
hardl}' ))e overestimated. 

A new determination of the temperature of the sun, based on the 
distribution of the solar radiation in the spectrum, has yielded a result 
of 5,J*2() of the centigrade scah^ al)ove absolute zero. 

For the purpose of the special study of the nature of sun spots, the 
absorption of the solar gaseous envelope, and for other observations 
requiring a large solar image an equipment including a horizontal 
reflecting telescope of 1-tO-foot focus and 20-inch aperature and a 
coelostat of improved construction to furnish at all times a 20-inch 
horizontal northerly directed solar beam has been provided. Tlie 
form of coelostat employed seems so well suited to solar work that 
this large instrument will be exhibited by the Observatory at the 
Louisiana Purchase Exposition in l!>0-f. Provision has been made in 
connection with the long-focus telescope to churn the air traversed b}^ 
the beam from the cotlostat to the focal image after the manner 
described in my last year's report. It is hoped that this installation 
will have 3'ielded results of interest before another year. 

On the whole the work of the Astrophysical Observatory during the 
past 3'ear has l)een quite as pi-oductive of results of interest as during 
any former year of its existence, especially in showing a notal)le varia- 
tion of atmospheric transparenc}" which is likel}' to have aft'ected 
climate and the growth of vegetation over a considera1)le part of the 
earth's surface, and in the studies of atmospheric absorption and those 
relating to the solar constant, to which 1 have referred, there seems 
renewed promise of progress toward the goal ''foretelling l)v such 
means those remoter changes of weather which aflect harvests,'' which is 
one of the great aims had in y'ww in the foundation of the Observatory. 

Respectfully su))mitted.

APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY'S REPORT. 



Ari'ENDIX J. 
REPORT ox THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL INITTSEUM. 

Sir: 1 have the honor to submit the following report on the condition and opera- 
tions of the National Museum during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1903. 

The most noteworthy occurrence of the year, and, in fact, for many years past, 
was the action of Congress in providing for an additional building for the National 
Museum, a building that will not only treble the existing amount of space, but also 
present an imposing and dignified appearance, and be entirely worthy to house the 
great collections of the nation. The jiublic will be greatly benefited by this measure, 
and the opportunity will be given to arrange in classified order the great mass of 
valuable material which, for over two decades, has been accunnilating in insecure 
and inconvenient storage quarters. 

Marked progress has been made in nearly every branch of the Museum. The 
number of specimens received was 236,000, increasing the total now in the possession 
of the Museum to over 5,650,000. The number sent out in exchange and as gifts to 
educational establishments was above 33,000. The demands for information by letter 
were increased at least 25 per cent, and nearly 900 lots of specimens were received 
for identification. The amount of fieldwork carried on by members of the Museum 
staff, however, was greatly diminished through lack of means. 

There was an increased number and a more extensive distribution of publications, 
and the library received as gifts two valuable collections of books and pamphlets 
on special zoological subjects. Preparations for the Louisiana Purchase Exhibition 
to be held at St. Louis in 1904 were well under way before the year ended, and the 
fact is now evident that the Museum will have in that connection one of the largest 
and most interesting exhibits it has ever assembled for such a purpose. 

BuUdimjs. — The work upon the final plans for the additional building was com- 
menced near the close of the year, but several months must elapse before the work- 
ing drawings are sufficiently advanced to begin making contracts. The new 
structure will stand upon the north side of the RIall between Ninth and Twelfth 
streets, with its center at Tenth street. Its location is, therefore, directly in front 
of the present buildings, but at a sufficient distance from them to prevent aiiy clash- 
ing between the different styles of architecture. The building will be classic in 
character and constructed of granite. Its frontage will be about 500 feet, and its 
depth about 330 feet. It will have four stories, including the basement, the main 
and second stories to be devoted to the public collections, the others to the storage 
of the reserve specimens and the various objects of the activities of the Museum. 
The entire floor area will amount to nearly 10 acres. It is expected that about four 
years will be required for the completion of the structure. 

The repairs about the present Museum l)uilding were extensive, owing in large 
part to the poor condition of the roof, which seems to develop new leaks during 

25 



26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

every heavy rain. The rotunda and foui- main halls have been entirely repainted, 
and this work was being extended to the four courts at tlie close of the year. This 
extensive renovation will place the exhibition halls in a more presentable condition 
than at any j^revions time. 

Many new cases, both for exhibition purposes and for storage, have been con- 
structed, and much has been accomplished in the rel)uilding and repair of old furni- 
ture and fixtures. 

Orgnnizalion and stuff. — One new division (Physical Anthropology) has been added 
to the Department of Anthropology, and one new section (Lower Alga^) to the 
Department of Biology. The scientific organization of the ]Museum, therefore, now 
comprises 9 divisions and 4 sections in the Department of Anthropology; 9 divisions 
and 13 sections in the Department of Biology; and 3 divisions and 3 sections in the 
Department of Geology. The scientific staff includes 3 head curators, 17 curators, 
13 assistant curators, 15 custodians, 12 aids, 4 associates, and 2 collaboi'ators, mak- 
ing a total of 66 persons, of whom only about one-half are paid employees of the 
Museum, the remainder serving in a volunteer or honorary capacity. 

Mr. W. H. Holmes, head curator of the Department of Anthropology, having been 
aiJi)ointed Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology, Prof. Otis T. Mason has been 
designated to assume his museum duties as acting head curator. 

Dr. A. Hrdlicka took charge of the newly organized Division of Physical Anthro- 
• nlogy on May 1, as assistant curator, and Dr. G. T. Moore, of the Department of 
Agriculture, became custodian of the new Section of the Lower Algte on I\Iay 25. 
The designation of "Sir. W. T. Swingle has been changed to that of custodian of the 
Section of Higher Alg;e. 

On December 31 Mr. Charles T. Simpson resigned his position as principal aid in 
the Division of ]Mo]lusks, being succeeded by Mr. Paul Bartsch, whose place was in 
turn taken by Mr. W. B. Maishall, appointed aid on Aj)ril 1. Mr. R. G. Paine was 
made an aid in the Division of Reptiles and Batrachians on April 6. 

Addillovs to the (■olk'ctioiis. — The number of accessions received during the year was 
1,643, about 230 more than in 1902, comprising in all about 236,000 specimens. This 
increases the total number of specimens in the national collections to above 5,650,000. 
Only the more important additions can be mentioned here. 

One of the most valuable acquisitions by the Department of Anthropology con- 
sisted of material recently eollecteil by Dr. W. L. Abbott in Sumatra ami the Straits 
Settlements, and illustrating the native arts and industries of a region but poorly 
represented in American museums. The many objects, numbering over 1,500, secured 
in the Philippine Islands by the late Col. F. F. Hilder, of the Bureau of American 
Ethnology, for the Government exhibit at the Pan-American Exposition, have been 
turned over to the Museum by the Government Board. This collection is of especial 
interest in that it furnishes much authoritative information regarding the life and 
customs of the natives of the largest of our new possessions. Dr. Frank Russell, 
formerly of the Bureau of American Ethnology, secured important material from 
the Pima Indians of southern Arizona, which, together with many ethnological 
objects from other sources, have been transferred by the Bureau to the custody 
of the Museum. Several collections made by Lieut. (J. T. Emmons, ol the United 
States Navy, illustrating the arts of the Chilcat and other Alaskan tribes, have also 
been acquired. 

An extremely noteworthy collection deposited in the Museum by Mr. S. S. How- 
land, ot Washington, D. C, consists of objects representing Buddhist religious art, 
such as bronze and wooden images of Buddha and Buddhist saints, shrmes, temple 
lamps, and sacred writings on palm leaves, and also of several Oriental manuscripts 
m Hebrew, Arabic, and other languages. Twenty-eiglit Jewish ceremonial objects 
from North Africa were obtained from Mr. Ephraiin Demard, of Kearney, N. J., one 
of the most interesting pieces being an ark of carved wood, containing a ])ar-chment

scroii of the Pentateuch. The Egyptian exploration fund han presented .«onie 
valuable Gr?eco-Eg}-ptian papyri. 

Among the accessions to the Division oi Prehistoric Archeology were a collection 
of implements and other objects obtained b}' Mr. W. H. Holmes from near Kinnns- 
wick, Mo., with the assistance of Mr. Gerard Fowke, w ho also transmitted a numl:)er 
of hammer-stones, flint nodules, and other objects from ancient quarries near Carter, 
Ky., and a series of implements and specimens of ore, whicli had been mined for use 
as paint, from aboriginal hematite mines at Leslie, Mo., collected l)y ]\Ir. Holmes. 
About 300 specimens of stone imi)lements, gathered by the late Mr. Frank Hamilton 
Gushing, including spearheads, arrowpoints, harpoons, and tools of various kinds, 
and a very important collection made by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes in Porto Rico and 
Santo Domingo were received from the Bureau of American Ethnology. The ma- 
terial from Santo Domingo comprises many types new to the Mu.seum, while that 
from Porto Rico contains several stone rings or collars, sculj>tm-e<l pillow stones, the 
remains of human skeletons, and various other objects. 

A series of models of United States war vessels, including gunboats, monitors, pro- 
tected crullers, and rams, deposited in the Museum by the Navy Department, form 
a very attractive exhibit, being of especial interest to the puV)lic. The War Depart- 
ment has also deposited a large number of mo<lels of heavy seacoast cannon, mountain 
howitzers, and other types of oi-dnance formerly used by the Army, and a series of 
small arms. 

Many relics of General and Mrs. L'. S. Grant, of great intrinsic as well as historic 
value, have been presented to the Museum by their children, through Brig. Gen. 
Frederick D. Grant, U. S. Army. They include clothing worn by General Grant 
during the civil war, commissions to different ranks in the Army, a cabinet presented 
to Mrs. Grant by the Empress of Japan, said to be 1,000 years old and valued at 
$20,000, several Japanese vases presented by the Emperor of Japan, and numerous 
other objects. Eight hundred and thirty-seven gold, silver, and copper coins were 
donated to the Museum by Mr. F,. M. Chapman, of New York City. 

Casts of the Neanderthal and Prague ancient crania were purcha.«ed for the newly 
established division of Physical Anthropology, which has also secured five valuable 
head-hunter's skulls from New Guinea, and a large series of crania and parts of human 
skeletons from the Army ^Medical Museum, the United States Fish Commission, and 
other sources. 

The zoological specimens contributed by Dr. W. L. Abbott consisted of a large 
number of deer, squirrels, porcupines, and a new ape, collected in Sumatra and on 
the a<ljacent islands, and on the Riou Peninsula south of Singapore. Many of the 
species are new to science. The donations made by Doctor Abbott as the result of 
his recent extensive explorations in the East Indies now compri.se about 2,500 mam- 
mals and nearly 4,000 birds, besides several thousand specimens in other l>ranches 
of natural history. 

Large collections of bird skins, fishes, corals, moUusks, crustaceans, and other 
marine invertebrates, obtained during the expedition of the United States Fisli Com- 
mission steamer AUmtrox!^ to the Hawaiian Islands and to Samoa, have been trans- 
mitted to the Museum and will be referred to more in detail in the next report. 
They include interesting series of the birds of the Laysan Islands. 

Dr. \i. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, presented a quantity of mammals from the Yellow- 
stone National Park and from Fort Snelliiig, Minn., and the Hon. B. S. Kairden, 
United States consul at Batavia, two undescnbed species ol Tmgulus from Java. A 
valuable skeleton ot the porpoise, Pseudorat crastudens, from the Hawaiian Islands, 
the first reported from that region, was contributed by Prof. C. H. Gilbert, of the 
Leiand Stanford Junior University. 

Several rare birds of paradise and other valuable specimens, including a pair of 
flight less cormorants, from the Galapagos islands, were received from Mr. A. Boucard, 



28 EEPOET OF THE SECRETAEY. 

Isle of Wight, England, and a Javan jnngle fowl, a black-winged peacock, and otlier 
birds from Mr. Homer Davenport, Morris Plains, N. J. The lUshop Musenm, of 
Honoluln, jn-esented about 40 bird skins, including several species not previously 
represented in the Museum collection, and about 300 interesting sj)ecimens from 
Chiriqui, Costa Rica, including a number of cotypes. Fifty-two bird skins from Hon- 
duras were obtained from Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, partly as a gift and partly 
in exchange. The most important accession to the oological collection was a fossil 
egg of Aepyornis maximus from Madagascar. Valuable birds' eggs from Australia, 
South America, and other countries were also received froni different sources. 

Reptiles irou\ southern Florida were contributed by Mr. E. J. Brown, of Lemon 
City, and a fine series of salamanders was presented by INIessrs. Brimley and Sherman, 
of Raleigh, N. C. From Prof. P. Biolley, of the National Museum of San Jose, Costa 
Rica, there were obtained several very interesting specimens, including a new gecko, 
described by Doctor Stejneger as Sphierodaciylus pacificus. Eighteen snakes from the 
Island of Cyprus were purchased from Giacomo Cecconi, of Florence, Italy. 

The accessions to tlie collection of fishes were numerous and important. Dr. O. P. 
Jenkins, of Leland Stanford Junior University, donated 42 types of Hawaiian fishes, 
constituting a second installment of a series of types the first of which were trans- 
mitted in 1901. A valua])le collection of types and cotypes of Japanese fishes was 
received from Dr. Da^'id S. Jordan, president of the same university. A large sal- 
mon, W'eighing about 50 jjounds, taken at Cascapedia, Canada, was presented by Dr. 
S. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia. A deep-sea jielican fish, captured at a depth of 
between 2,000 and 3,000 fathoms, during the survey for the Pacific cable, was trans- 
mitted by the officers of the U. S. S. Nero, and a large conger eel was received from 
Mr. Louis Mowbray, of Bermuda, through the New York Acpiarium. 

Besides the moUusks ol)tained by the Fish Commission expedition to the Hawaiian 
Islands a number of well-iireserve<l land shells from the same region were donated 
by Mr. W. H. Henshaw, of Hilo, Hawaii. Interesting collections of shells were also 
received from Dr. Henry Loomis, Yokohama, Japan; Mr. F. A. Wood worth, San 
Francisco, Cal.; Mrs. T. S. Oldroyd, Burnett, Cal., and the Imperial Academy of 
Sciences, St. Petersburg. A specimen of the rare Valuta mamilla Sby., from Tasma- 
nia, and other valuable Australian shells, were also added to the mollusk collection. 

Among the most important additions to the entomological division were a collec- 
tion of over 19,000 specimens of gall wasps, parasites, etc., from Canada, transmitted 
by the Department of Agriculture; a series of Costa Rican insects of different orders 
purchased from 3Ir. P. Schild, of New York City; 2,000 specimens of Chilean insects

optera from Dr. W. H. Valway, Cleveland, Ohio, and a valuable series of Venezuelan 
ClclndeUidx and Scarahmdx from Mr. E. A. Klages, of Crafton, Pa. A collection of 
African butterflies, including examples of several species described by Doctor Auri- 
villius, was received in exchange from the Royal Natural History Museum, Stoc-k- 
holm. An important exchange was made with the American Entomological Society, 
whereby the Museum received 100 species of Mexican and Central American Hyme- 
noptera, including many cotypes. Thirty-four cotypes of Coleoptera were presented 
by Prof. H. C. Fall, of Pasadena, Cal. 

The Division of Marine Invertebrates obtained through exchange Math the Museum 
of Natural History, Paris, France, about 50 species of fresh-water crustaceans. A 
series of Japanese crustaceans, inchiding many interesting specimens collected by Dr. 
David S. Jordan and Mr. J. O. Snyder, was presented by the Leland Stanford Junior 
University. A mmil)er of crustaceans from the Maldive Islands, collected by Mr. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29 

Alexander Agas.^iz in 1901 and 1902, was received from the Museum of C'om])arative 
Zoology, Camljridge, Mass., and similar material from (.'osta Rica and Cocos Island 
was acquired through exchange with the National Museum of Costa Rica. Among 
other accessions of special interest may be mentioned four lots of isopod crustaceans, 
including types obtained by the Harriman expedition, received from Prof. Trevor 
Kincaid, Seattle, Wash. ; 23 specimens of echinoderms and crustaceans from Great 
Britain and from various localites in the East, contributed by Mr. H. M. Parritt, of 
London, England; a quantity of foraminifera from Great Britain and the Seychelles 
Islands, jjresented by Mr. H. Sidebottom, Cheshire, England, and a collection of 
parasites of fishes, transmitted by Prof. Edwin Linton, of "Washington, Pa. A very 
interesting series of European parasites, comprising trematodes, cestodes, and nema- 
todes, was deposited in the ]VIuseum by the Bureau of Animal Industry, Department 
of Agriculture. 

To tlie Osteological collection were added a skeleton of the giant salamander, Sie- 
boldia japonica, presented by the Imperial Museum of Tokyo; three skeletons of 
Harris's cormorant, Nanopternm JiarrisRi, purchased from Mr. R. H. Beck, of Berryessa, 
Cal., and a skeleton of musk ox from Ellesmere Land, representing a species new to 
the Museum, from Mr. J. S. Warmbath, of Washington, D. C. 

The National Herbarium has been enriched by a collection of about 1,400 plants 
from the Philippine Archii)elago, contributed by tlie Philippine bureau of agricul- 
ture, and by another collection from the same locality received from the Royal 
Botanical Gardens, Kew, England. Mr. William R. Maxon, of the Museum staff, 
obtained a large collection of ferns and other plants during a collecting trip of about 
two months' duration in Jamaica. Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, presented a large 
series of plants collected in the Yellowstone National Park, and Capt. John Donnell 
Smith, of Baltimore, Md., who has made extensive contributions to the Herbarium, 
continued his donations during the past year, transmitting a series of plants from the 
West Indies and Central America. 

As in past years, the principal accessions to the geological collections were from 
the United States Geological Survey. Among the more important ones of the year 
were two series of minerals, rocks, and ores, constituting a jwrtion of the exhibit 
made by the Survey at the expositions recently held in Buffalo and Charleston. An 
interesting lot of tourmalinitic quartz from Little Pipestone district, Montana, of 
which some of the specimens are covered on one side with parallel layers of ame- 
thysts of different hues, accompanied this material. 

A valuable series of massive and cut polished stalactites and stalagmites from the 
Copper Queen mine was presented by Mr. James Douglas, of Bisbee, Ariz. 

A specimen of pallasite, weighing 351 pounds, from Mount Vernon, Ky. ; a mass of 
meteoric iron from Arispe, Mexico, weighing 116 pounds; a mass of meteoric iron from 
Persimmon Creek, in North Carolina, weighing 9 pounds, and a meteoric stone, weigh- 
ing nearly 9 pounds, from Hendersonville, N. C, are among the most important 
additions to the meteoric collections. 

A small piece of the only known specimen of footeite was donated by Mr. Warren 
M. Foote, of Philadelphia, and 35 very desirable minerals not previously represented 
in the INIuseum collection were obtained by purchase. 

The largest and most valuable addition to the Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology 
was the second installment of the E. O. ITlrich collection of Paleozoic l)ryozoans, 
comprising about 7,500 specimens and 2,500 microscopic slides. The collection as a 
whole is the most extensive of its kind in existence and contains many unique speci- 
mens. A])out 14,000 corals, crinoids, mollusks and other invertebrate fossils were 
received from Prof. Carl Rominger, of Ann Arbor, Mich. Many of these have been 
figured and described in the reports of the geological survey of Michigan. The 
Andrew Sherwood collection of Pennsylvania Upper Devonic vertebrate and inver- 
tebrate fossils is also entitled to special notice. This collection was brought together 



30 KEPORT OF THE SECRETAEY. 

by Mr. Sherwood, and includes many choice ylabs filled with large brachiojuidH and 
niollusks, besides about 8,000 small specimens. 

The collection of vertebrate fossils was increased by several important additions, 
one of which, comprising the teeth of Mastodon humhoMtil and Mastodon cordillerum 
and casts of mandibular rami, was received from the British Museum, London, Eng- 
land. Dr. H. J. Herbein, of Pottsville, Pa., contributed a slalj of sandstone showing 
reptilian footprints, from Mount Carbon, Pa., and Mr. Whitman Cross, of the Tnited 
States Geological Survey, collected and transmitted a tooth of Cktdodus formosus 
(Hay) from Needle Mountains Quadrangle, Colorado. 

About 500 specimens of Triassic plants, collected in Connecticut and Massachusetts 
by INIr. S. "Ward Loper, of the United States Geological Survey, have been turned 
over to the Museum; a small series of fossil plants from the Permian of Ohio was 
donated by Mr. H. Herzer, of Marietta, Ohio, and about 80 specimens of Paleozoic 
plants were received with the Ulrii'h collection above mentioned. 

Explorations. — Fewer exjjlorations than usual were carried on last year directly by 
the ]\Iuseum, owing to the scarcity of means for this purpose. 

The fieldwork under the Bureau of American Ethnology, whicli yielded interest- 
ing collections of objects, since deposited in the Museum as before mentioned, was 
conducted by Mr. William H. Holmes, Mr. Gerard Fowke, and Dr. J. Walter 
Fewkes. Mr. Holmes visited the aboriginal hematite mines at Leslie, Mo., and Mr. 
Fowke an ancient quarry in Carter County, Ky., while Do(!tor Fewkes spent con- 
•?idei'able time in Santo Domingo and Porto Rico. 

The important exj^lorations of Dr. William L. Abbott in Sumatra and the adjoin- 
ing islands, as well as on the mainland of the Straits Settlements, have already 
been referred to under the heading of Additions to the Collections. These explora- 
tions, which are carried on entirely at the expense of Doctor Abbott, have now been 
in progress for several years, and through his generosity the National Museum has 
been the fortunate recipient of the very large and extremely valuable collections that 
he has made. 

Mr. F. A. Lucas, with two others of the Museum staff, visited one of the stations 
of the C'abot Steam Whaling Company, on the coast of Newfoundland, in the 
interest of the St. Louis Exposition, for the purpose of securing as complete a 
representation as possible of a large suli)hur-bottom whale. He Mas entirely suc- 
cessful, returning with a perfect skeleton of a specimen measuring al)out 78 feet 
long, and with molds of the exterior from which a cast of the entire animal will be 
made. These specimens, at the close of the exposition, will be returned and 
exhil)ite<l in the Museum. 

Through the courtesy of the Geographical Society of Baltimore the Museum was 
enabled to send Mr. B. A. Bean and Mr. J. H. Riley with an expedition to the 
Bahama Islands, where they made collections of the fishes and land animals of 
that region. 

Dr. H. G. Dyar and Mr. Rolla P. Currie, also of the Museum staff, accompanied 
an expedition to British Columbia under the auspices of the Carnegie ^luseum, and 
brought back with them a large and important collection of insects. Mr. Gerrit S. 
Miller, jr., collected mammals in Virginia, and Mr. William R. INIaxon jilants in 
Jamaica. 

Mr. S. Ward Loper, of the United States Geological Survey, n^ade for the Museum 
an interesting collection of Triassic plants in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and, 
through arrangements with the Director of the Survey, Hon. Charles D. Walcott, 
Mr. Charles Schuchert, of the Museum staff, spent several weeks in Virginia and 
Georgia with the si^ecial view of determining the geological horizons of the southern 
part of the Appalachians. Incidental to this study he collected many fossils. Sev- 
eral tveeks were spent by Mr. R. S. Bassler in Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky, collect- 
intj invertebrate fossils. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31 

In connection with tlie Baldwin-Ziegler expedition to tlie Polar regions, a small 
collection of natural-history specimens obtained aliout Franz Josef I^and was i)re- 
sentecl to the Museum by Mr. Ziegler. It is hoped that the second expedition now 
in progress under the same auspices will result in additional accessions from that 
little-known region. 

Researches. — The Museum collections serve as the basis for a large amount of 
scientific work, as detailed each year in the full reports of the Museum, wliich also 
contain lists of the papers resulting from these studies. These investigations are car- 
ried on both in Washington and at different establishments throughout the country. 
The ]\Iuseum assistants give to the classification of the collections as much time as 
can be s])ared from their duties as custodians. Spet'ialists from the scientific bureaus 
in Washington and from elsewhere are frequent visitors at the Museum, coming for 
the purpose of consulting the collections or of conducting researches of greater or 
less extent. The numl:)er of specimens sent out to investigators during the year has 
amounted to more than 12,000. 

Among those now engaged in the study of special groups in the direct interest of the 
Museum are Prof. Charles L. Edwards, of Trinity College, Hartford, who is at work 
upon the pedate holothurians; Prof. Hubert Lyman Clark, of Olivet College, Michi- 
gan, who has the apodal holothurians; Prof. C. C. Nutting, of the University of Iowa, 
who has nearly completed a monograph on the Sertularian hydroids; Dr. Charles 
B. Wilson, of the State Normal School, Westfield, Mass., who is studying the para- 
sitic copepoda, and one of whose papers on the family Argulid;e was pul)lished 
during the year; and Prof. A. G. Mayer, scientific director of the museum of the 
Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, who is finishing the uncompleted studies of 
the late Prof. Alpheus Hyatt on the Museum collection of Achatinellidse. 

Among other well-known specialists to whom zoological material has been lent are 
Dr. J. A. Allen and Mr. Frank M. Chapman, of the American Museum of Natural 
History, New York City; Mr. AVitmer Stone and Mr. J. A. G. Rehn, of the Philadel- 
phia Academy of Natural Sciences, and Dr. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Columbian 
Museum. 

About 400 orchids were sent to Mr. Oakes Ames, of North Easton, Mass., and 
about 300 specimens of Jludbccl-ia and the same number of Coreopsis to Mr. C. D. 
Beadle, of Biltmore, X. C. 

The Department of Geology has contributed material to the United States ( Jeolog- 
ical Survey and to various Bureaus of the Department of Agriculture for use in con- 
nection with current investigations; specimens of radio-active minerals have l)een 
furnished to Prof. George F. Barker, of the University of Pennsylvania; about 260 
Tertiary insects were lent to Prof. S. W. Williston, of the University of Chicago, and 
500 Carboniferous insects to Dr. Anton Handlirsch, of the Royal Austrian Museum, 
Viemia. 

Excltanges. — In the act of 1846 founding the Smithsonian Institution, the exchange 
of dui)licate specimens with other institutions was authorized as a means of enlarging 
the collections in the Smithsonian Museum. This practice was begun at an early 
date, and has been continued down to the present time. It has not, however, been 
carried on to the extent that the collections would permit, for the reason that the 
staff has never been large enough to classify the specimens to such a degree that 
even a fair part of the duplicates could be set aside from those which must remain 
as permanent records in the Museum. Nevertheless, very much has been done in 
this way and numerous exchanges were made during the past year. Furthermore, 
in accordance with acts of Congress, duplicate specimens not reijuired for exchange, 
have been made up into sets and distrilnited to educaticmal establishments throughout 
the country, thus promoting educational interests at a distance from the .Museum. 

TJtc c.rJilbitio I, lia/l.t. — A nundx'r of collectitms and specimens recently received 
have been placed on exhibition, ])ut, as intimated in previous reports, the installa- 



32 REPOKT OF THE SEOKETARY. 

tion of new material is made possible only by transl'errin<r othei- collections to 
storage or by crowding the exhibits so closely together as to render them practically 
useless to the public. 

The gallery of the northwest court has afforded temporary accommodations for the 
ethnological material obtained from the Philippine Islands, while the other galleries 
assigned to the Department of Anthropology^ have been utilized in relieving the 
general congestion which of late years has become so noticeable throughout the 
Museum building. The large ethnological collections received from Dr. William L. 
Abbott and from the Museum-Gates expedition, with many others of equal impor- 
tance, have been stored away for the present. Special attention has been paid to the 
labeling of the historical collections, and conspicuous labels now indicate the con- 
tents of the various halls, alcoves, and cases. The study collection of Eskimo 
objects has been rearranged and placed temporarily in storage cases in the north- 
west range. As it has been impossible to make the repairs called for in the hall 
devoted to Prehistoric Archeology, it has remained closed -during nearly the entire 
year. 

In the Department of Biology good results have been obtained by the rearrange- 
ment and refitting of cases, especially those containing the exhibits of mammals, 
insects, fishes, and marine invertebrates, and much progress has been made in label- 
ing both the small American mammals and the Old World series. A new mounting 
has been made of the very beautiful Argus ])heasants, which were presented by Dr. 
William L. Abbott some years ago, and it is now one of the most attractive of all 
the exhibition groups. 

The geological halls remain much th6 same as last year because no additional 
space has become available, bnt there has been some expansion in the exhiljit of 
fossil vertebrates, to which a specimen of Claosauru.'i will shortly be added, as well 
as the mounted skeleton of a mastodon. The cases containing the nonmetallic min- 
erals and the geographic exhibit of economic minerals have been carefully cleaned 
and the specimens rearranged, while the case in the west-south range, in which the 
stratigraphic; and historical collections are exhibited, has been reconstructed and the 
specimens have been reinstalled. A large number of labels and reference cards have 
been prepared, and some progress has been made in the preparation of the card cat- 
alogue of type material. 

Visitors. — The total number of visitors to the Museum building was 315,307, and 
to the Smithsonian building 181,174, an increase in the first instance of about <S1 per 
cent and in the latter of about 26 per cent over the previous year. 

Meetings and lectures. — The use of the lecture hall was granted to the Biological 
Society of Washington for a series of five scientific lectures given between February 
14 and March 14. The Naval Medical School and the Army Medical School also 
held their graduating exercises there on April 4 and 14, respectively, and the annual 
spring meeting of the National Academy of Sciences was held in the same place from 
April 21 to 23. 

Publications. — Somewhat more than the usual numl)er of publications were issued 
during the past year, and it is estimated that the distril)ution to libraries and indi- 
viduals, both at home and abroad, amounted to about 45,000 volumes and separate 
papers. 

The new publications of the year consisted of the Annual Report for 1900; the 
second volume of Mr. Ridgway's monograph on The Birds of North and Middle 
America; A List of North American Lepidoptera, by Dr. Harrison G. Dyar; volume 
24 of the Proceedings, in bound form; the separate ])apers, 31 in number, consti- 
tuting volume 25, and the first 27 papers of volume 26 of the Proceedings. A 
pamphlet of instructions to collectors of anthropological objects, with special refer- 
ence to the Philippine Islands and other insular possessions, prejyared by Mr. Wil- 
liam H. Holmes and Prof. O. T. Mason, was issued as Part (i of Bulletin 39. 



EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33 

The sundry civil act for 1903 provided for the transfer of the management of the 
Contributions from the United States National Herbarium from the Dejiartment of 
Agriculture to the National Museum. ITnder this provision two former volumes, 
Numbers II and VII, were reprinted by the Museum, namely, Botany of Western 
Texas, by Prof. J. M. Coulter, and Systematic and Geographic Botany and Aborigi- 
nal Uses of Plants, by Messrs. Coulter, Rose, Cook, and Chesnut. Of the current 
volume, Number VIII, parts 1, 2, and 3, were issued, their titles being as follows: 
Studies of Mexican and Central American Plants, by Dr. J. N. Rose; Economic 
Plants of Porto Rico, by Prof. O. F. Cook and Mr. G. N. Collins; and A Study of 
Certain Mexican and Guatemalan Species of PoJypodium, by Mr. AVilliam R. Maxon. 

A number of INIuseum papers greatly in demand, the editions of which had become 
exhausted, were reprinted. Among them were the first volume of Bulletin 47, by 
Doctors Jordan and Evermann, entitled " Fishes of North and Middle America;" Doc- 
tor Stejneger's paper on the Poisonous Snakes of North America; Doctor Dall's Pre- 
liminary Catalogue of the Shell-bearing Marine Mollusks and Brachiopods of the 
Southeastern Coast of the United States; Mr. Ridgway's monograph on the Humming 
Birds, and several of the pamphlets of instructions to collectors from Bulletin No. 39. 

Twelve papers prepared by members of the staff, based iipon material in the 
Museum, were by permission of the Secretary, printe<l in publications other than 
those of the National Museum. 

Llhnn'!/. — The increase of the ^Museum library during the past year has been 
mainly due to two very important gifts — the Hubbard and Schwarz, and the Dall 
donations. The former collection, consisting of 300 books and 1,500 pamphlets, was 
brought together by Mr. G. G. Hubbard and Mr. E. A. Schwarz (custodian of 
Coleoptera in the Museum) while carrying on their studies more or less conjointly, 
and forms an accessory to their large collection of insects presented to the Museum 
several years ago. It is an entomological library, with special reference to the 
American Coleoptera. The contrilnition by Mr. AVilliam H. Dall, honorary curator 
of -AloUusks, comprises about 1,600 ])ound volumes and about 2,000 pamphlets on the 
moUuska, a special library of great value, which has been accumulated during many 
years of research. It is accompanied l)y a card catalogue covering the literature of 
Conchology, both recent and fossil, up to alwut 1860. 

The aggregate of additions to the library for the year amoimted to 3,161 books, 
3,260 pamphlets, and 303 parts of volumes. 

E.rpoffifioiis. — Much progress has been made during the year in connection with 
the preparation of the exhibits for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. An especially 
noteworthy feature will consist of the complete skeleton and a east of the exterior of 
a sulphur-bottom whale which measured 78 feet long when caught. It was obtained 
at one of the whaling stations on the Newfoimdland coast and was roughly jirepared 
for shipment to this country by members of the Museum staff. 

There will be several striking groups in ethnology, arranged by Mr. William H. 
Holmes, who is also preparing a model of one of the great Maya temples in southern 
Mexico. A special effort is being made by Dr. F. W. True, the representative of the 
Institution and the Museum, to produce a satisfactory display of American animals 
mounted in accordance with the latest methods of taxidermy. The geological 
exhi})it, which is to include one or more of the huge fossil Dinosaurs, is Ijeing 
prepared under the direction of Dr. George P. Merrill.

Appendix II. 
REPOET OF THE BTTREAU ()F AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY. 

Sir: I have the honor to fjubmit the following report on the operations < f the 
Bureau of American Ethnology for the fiscal j'ear ending June 30, 1903, conducted 
in accordance with the act of Congress making provision for continuing researches 
relating to the American Indians under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution. 
The work has been carried out, in the main, in accordance with the plan of ojiera- 
tions submitted by Director Powell on May 20, 1902, and approved by the Secretary 
May 23, 1902. 

The death of Maj. J. AV. Powell, Director of the Bureau, occurred at Haven, Me., 
September 23, 1902. This event profoundly affects the interests of the Bureau, and 
closes an epoch of exceptional importance in the history of the science of man. The 
wisdom of the foundation laid by Director Powell is everywhere recognized, and the 
impetus given to anthropological studies by his work must continue to be felt long 
after the present initial stage of the science has ripened into the full knowledge which 
shall regulate and direct the future development of the human race. 

During the somewhat prolonged j:)eriod of Director Powell's illness the adminis- 
trative work of the Bureau devolved uj^on ]Mr. W J McGee, ethnologist in charge, 
who was Acting Director at the time of Major Powell's death. On October 11, 1902, 
Mr. W. H. Holmes, head curator in the Department of Anthropology, United States 
National Museum, was appointed Chief of the Bureau and assumed charge of the 
office October 13. 

The research work of the Bureau has Ijeen carried on by a permanent force of 9 
scientific employees, while a number of temporary assistants have been engaged for 
brief periods in the office and among the western tribes. During the year 5 members 
of the staff have sj^ent a portion of their time in the field. The regions visited include 
Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Indiana, ]\Iinnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Okla- 
homa, Indian Territory, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, Idaho, California, Porto 
Rico, and Santo Domingo. 

The researches have been of exceptional importance and have dealt with numerous 
branches of primitive culture and history, practical questions having been kept as 
much as ijossible in view. The completion of reports on field exploration and the 
preparation of papers dealing with special prol)lems have claimed much attention, and 
every effort has been made to bring up to date and submit for publication researches 
that have been maturing during the previous years. The preparation of data for a 
dictionary of the Indian tribes has been a principal feature of the year's work, claim- 
ing the attention of all available members of the Bureau staff and emi^loying the 
services of a number of special students. Detailed reference t(j this work is made 
farther on in this report. 

The range of the scientific work has been Avide but has not extended, save inci- 
dentally, to all departments of Anthroi)ology. Philology, sociology, sophiology, 
technology, and pesthetics have received attention by those conducting investiga- 
tions among the tribes in the field and by those engaged in office researches, but 
somatology and psychology have received no systematic attentioii.

KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35 

The nongcientitic work of the Bureau, which iufhides the library, the jihoto- 
graphic laboratory, the editorial, and the general clerical work has engaged ten 
persons aside from the chief administrative officer, and on the whole has progressed 
favorably, many changes having been made in method and routine, especially 
toward the close of the fiscal year. 

For the Ijetter understanding of the work of the year and the conditions affecting 
the present affairs of the Bureau, considerable data dealing A/ith history, statistics, 
and I'outine have been introduced into this report. 

KESEARCH WORK. 

The Chief prosecuted archaeological researches at a number of points in the eastern 
section of the United States. Previous to October 13 he was engaged, with the 
assistance of Mr. Gerard Fowke, in making examinations of the fossil bone beds at 
Kimmswick, Mo., with the view of determining whether there was satisfactory 
evidence that man was contemporaneous with the mammoth and the mastodon in 
that region; but no traces of man were found in direct association with the fossil 
remains. Examinations of aboriginal flint quarries and sites of stone-implement 
manufacture were made in southern Indiana and in eastern Kentucky. In October 
explorations were undertaken at Lansing, Kans., with the view of determining the 
age of the human remains found embedded in loess-like formations near that place. 
The formations were extensively trenched by Mr. Fowke, under the direction of the 
Chief of the Bureau, and the conclusion was reached that the remains were of 
exceptional antiquity for America, but that they could not with certainty be assigned 
to a definite geological horizon and that they were probably of post-Glacial time. 
In April the Chief paid a visit to Leslie, Mo., for the purpose of studying certain traces 
of ancient operations reported to occur in an iron mine near that place. Very inter- 
esting phenomena were encountered, the ancient aborigines having penetrated the 
Dve body in many directions and to surprising depths, the purpose being, apparently, 
to obtain the red and yellow iron oxides if>r paint. Many hundreds of mining tools 
of stone were found in the ancient tunnels. Early in May a trip was made to Georgia 
and Alabama for the purpose of examining quarry sites and caverns occupied in 
ancient times by the aborigines. 

Reports have been prepared on the explorations at Lansing, Kans., and at Leslie, 
Mo. The first of these researches deals with the important and ever-recurring ques- 
tion of the antiquity of man in America. It has been the aim of the Bureau, and espe- 
cially of the present Chief, to occupy conservative ground with respect to this subject, 
and to so scrutinize the discoveries and reputed discoveries reported from time to 
time that erroneous interjjretations should not prevail. The purpose of the excava- 
tions made at Lansing was to expose the formations containing the human remains 
so fully that geologists of all ways of thinking might study them to advantage, thus 
preventing the adoption of conclusions based f>n inadequate observations. The 
Leslie iron mine study has an interesting bearing on the technic and industrial his- 
tory of the tribes. It has been a 'matter of much surprise, as the investigations of 
the ancient mining and quarrying have progressed, that the al)origines, seemingly 
so nonprogressive and shiftless, should have conceived and carried out really great 
enterprises. The technical knowledge and skill displayed are of a low order indeed, 
but the work accomplished indicates remarkable enterprise and persistence, and 
demonstrates the existence of native capacity of high order. 

Mr. "W J McGee, ethnologist in i-harge, continued as Acting Director until October 
13. During this period he prepared the annual report for the preceding year, made 
a hasty archreological and ethnological reconnoissance in ^Minnesota, and in Septem- 
ber visited Baddeck, Nova Scotia, whence he was called to the deathbed of Major 
Powell in Haven, j\Ie. In Decemljer he visited Mexico with the view of arranging 
for an expeditieu to the island of Tiburon, but in this he was-not successful. En route 



36 KEPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

he stopped over a day in New Mexico to visit some ancient ruins near the village of 
Cuchilla. On returning from Mexico Mr. McGee suffered from a fever which pre- 
vented active work for a period of about three months. 

In July, August, and September, Dr. J. Walter Fewkes was occupied in the prepa- 
ration of the text and illustrations of an account of a reconnoissance made in Porto 
Rico during May and June of the previous fiscal year. This report, which was 
intended to be a resume of what is known of the prehistoric inhabitants of Porto 
Rico, was finished in October and placed in the hands of the Acting Director, who 
transmitted it to the Public Printer as Bulletin 28. Considerable time in these 
months was likewise given by Doctor Fewkes to correcting proofs and arranging the 
plates of his memoir on a series of native pictures of Hopi katcinas, or ancestor-gods, 
for the Twenty-first Annual Report of the Bureau. Doctor Fewkes left Washington 
for a second expedition to the West Indies in the middle of November, remaining 
there over five months and visiting the islands of Porto Rico and Santo Domingo. 
The collection of prehistoric objects maile on this trip numbers over 1,000 specimens, 
110 of which were obtained by purchase in Santo Domingo, the remainder by explo- 
ration and purchase in Porto Rico. Not only is this collection numerically the 
largest which has been brought to the Smithsonian Institution from Porto Rico and 
Santo Domingo at any one time, but it is also one of the most significant on account 
of its wealth in typical forms previously unrepresented in the Museum. 

Doctor Fewkes was able to determine l)y excavations that the inclosures surrounded 
by aligned stones and called by the natives "juegos de bola" were made by the 
aborigines of the island for ceremonial dance places, and that neighboring mounds 
are prehistoric cemeteries. The determination of the burial places of the prehistoric 
Porto Ricans and their discovery in numbers are believed to be the most important 
results of Doctor Fewkes's field work in Porto Rico. With this information to guide 
him, the archaeologist will have little difficulty in the future in adding to existing 
collections of prehistoric objects from Porto Rico and in placing them in their 
proper categories. 

Doctor Fewkes maae excavations in a cave called "Cueva de las Golondrinas," situ- 
ated near the town of Manatf, and found large quantities of Indian pottery and a few 
other objects of aboriginal manufacture. All the evidence collected indicates that 
while the aborigines had frequented this cave for a long time, the culture of the 
earlier and later occupants was practically identical. After his return to Washington 
in May, Doctor Fewkes was occupied in cataloguing the objects collected during the 
winter and in preparing a preliminary report on them. He was permitted to with- 
draw the account of his previous year's explorations, which had been transmitted 
to the Public Printer as a bulletin with a view of incorporating with it the new mate- 
rial obtained on this second visit to the island. The valuable results of the two 
years' work will thus appear in monographic form in a forthcoming annual report. 

The researches of Doctor Fewkes furnish much material of value bearing upon ques- 
tions of science and history. Of first importance is the decided advance made toward 
identifying and rehabilitating the unfortunate peoples of the West Indies, swept 
almost without record from the islands during the early years of Spanish coloniza- 
tion. Considerable information regarding their physical characters and manner 
of life has been gained, and various branches of culture are illustrated by the col- 
lections, while definite notions of the origin, burial customs, and arts and industries 
of the island peoples are for the first time conveyed to the world of science. Doctor 
Fewkes has thus shed light on a significant and important chapter of aboriginal 
American history. 

The months of July to November, inclusive, were spent by Mrs. M. C. Stevenson 
in researches among the Zufii Indians, the special objects being a comparative study 
of the peoples of the Southwest and a collection of the ethnoflora of Zuni. Some 
years ago Mrs. Stevenson observed that the prayers of one of the Zufii rain priests 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3T 

were sung in the Sia tongue, and that one of the esoteric fraternities sang in Piman, 
but it was not until her last visit to Zuni that slie learned that all of the thirteen eso- 
teric fraternities used other languages than their own in their ceremonies. It is difti- 
cult to catch the words of an aboriginal choir singing to the accompaniment of rattles 
and drums, especially when the mind is absorbed in noting the ritual rather than the 
words employed. But during the last season, having in view a comparative study of 
the Pueblo Indians, and knowingthatat least one fraternity employed a foreign tongue, 
Mrs. Stevenson closely observed this feature of the ceremonies and made special 
inquiries of the priests and theurgists, thus determining the remarkable fact that this 
was true of all. Several reasons could be advanced for this use of strange languages, 
but it remains for future investigation to acquaint us fully with the facts. 

Mrs. Stevenson makes the important observation that, although the ceremonies 
which she describes in her monograph were regularly practiced during the first 
decade and a half spent by her in their study and were faithfully observed in every 
detail, they have since been gradually changed and in some instances have been 
abandoned. It would thus appear that these researches were not undertaken a 
moment too soon. 

In the main the results of the year's work in Zuiii have been incorporated in the 
monographic studies of the Zuni people prepared by Mrs. Stevenson during the pre- 
vious years. The final work is now in the editor's hands and wnll soon be submitted 
for publication. Mrs. Stevenson's familiarity with the language of the Zunis, the con- 
fidence with which she has inspired them, the deep insight she has obtained into 
the philosophical and religious meaning of their ceremonies, and her intimate knowl- 
edge of their sociology peculiarly fit her for the presentation of a monograph on this 
people. 

The herbarium of edible, medicinal, and fetishistic plants collected by Mrs. Steven- 
son over an area 110 miles north and south and 60 miles east and west from Zuiii, 
contains about 200 specimens. Among the many interesting varieties are a narcotic, 
Datura stramonium, a specific for hemorrhage, UstUago, and what the Zuni claim to be 
their native cotton, Esculapia Mexicana. The fiber of the latter is made at the pres- 
ent time into a cord for the more sacred objects used by the rain priests, and the 
Zunis claim that all of their cotton fabrics were woven of this plant before the advent 
of the Spaniards. Acknowledgments are due to Dr. F. V. Coville, Botanist, Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, and Dr. J. N. Rose, Assistant Curator, U. S. National Museum, 
for their courteous assistance in providing ]Mrs. Stevenson with facilities for preserv- 
ing the plants and also for the classification of the collection. 

At the beginning of the fiscal year Mr. James Mooney was in the field in western 
Oklahoma, engaged in the prosecution of researches among the Kiowa and Cheyenne 
tribes in the joint interest of the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Field Colum- 
bian Museum under an agreement made in the preceding year. Except during two 
brief visits to Washington, in September and in November, 1902, i\Ir. Mooney 
devoted the entire year to researches relating to the social customs, religion, and art 
of the tribes, especial attention being given to investigations of the heraldrj- system 
of the Kiowa and Kiowa-Apache tribes as exemplified in the old-time shields and 
decorated tipis. His work comprised the preparation of a full series of shield and 
tipi models on a suitable scale, together with related investigations and collections. 
The heraldry investigation and the model series for the confederated Kiowas and 
Kiowa-Apaches are nearly finished and the latter is expected to constitute part of 
the Smithsonian exhibit at the forthcoming Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The' 
complete model series may be estimated to contain 150 shields and 40 tipis for the 
Kiowas and confederated Apaches, and a somewhat smaller nund^er for the Chey- 
ennes. In April Mr. ^Mooney shifted his base of operations from Mount Scott, in the 
Kiowa country, to a station near Bridgeport, in the Cheyenne country, about 100 miles 
north, and has since been moving about among the widely separated Cheyenne camps. 



38 EEPOET 0¥ THE SECRETARY. 

Some weeks were devoted to a practical study of the hide-dressing jirocess in all its 
stages in connection with the making of a full-size skin tipi. This important industry 
is thus for the first time placed fully on record. At the close of the present year 
Mr. Mooney was preparing to attend the great annual sun dance of the Cheyennes, 
to be held about the middle of July. 

In addition to the research work referred to above, Mr. Mooney has assisted, both 
in the field and during his brief stay in the office, in preparing material for the Dic- 
tionary of Indian Tribes, in course of preparation l>y the Bureau. 

The heraldry studies of Mr. Mooney have opened up a field entirely new to Ameri- 
can ethnology, and are expected to contribute materially to our knowledge of many 
questions heretofore imperfectly understood in relation to the social and military 
organization, heredity laws, war customs, tabu system, and religious symbolism of 
the Plains tribes. The urgency of the work may be judged by the fact that of per- 
haps 300 shields in possession of the Kiowas a generation ago only 8 are now known 
to be in existence (4 of which have been obtained by Mr. Mooney for the National 
Museum), while more than half the information gained upon the subject came from 
old men who have passed away since the investigation began. 

During the year Dr. Cyrus Thomas, ethnologist, was engaged mainly on the Dic- 
tionary of Indian TriV)es, under the supervision of Mr. F. W. Hodge. In the early 
months he made a final examination of the data relating to the Algonquian family, 
and later took up the Siouan, Muskhogean, Tinuiquanan, and Natchesan stocks. 
Brief articles on a number of the leading subjects intended for introduction into 
the dictionary, such as Agriculture, Mounds, Mound-builders, Government, and 
numerous biographical sketches of prominent Indians, have been prepared by 
Doctor Thomas. He has thus contributed greatly to the interests of the Bureau in 
a practical way, ])utting in final and concise form much of the knowledge accumu- 
iatetl during his thirty years of service in his chosen field. 

Doctor Thomas has been largely employed during preceding years, in direct asso- 
ciation with Major Powell, in the important work of compiling a list of linguistic 
families, languages, and dialects of the tribes of Mexico and Central America, and 
the manuscript of this work, comprising some 200 typewritten pages, was submitted 
l)y him at the close of the present year. 

At the beginning of the fiscal year Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was engaged in the 
work of making an interlinear translation of a version of the Onondaga (Iroquoian) 
cosmologic myth, olttained in the field in 1900 from Mr. John Arthur Gibson, an 
intelligent and gifted Seneca priest. This text is by far the longest and fullest of 
the five versions of this myth recorded by Mr. Hewitt during several field seasons. 
Two of these texts are Seneca, two are Onondaga, and one is Mohawk. The 
Mohawk text, related by Mr. Seth Newhouse, the shorter Onondaga text, told by 
John Buck, and the longer Seneca text, told by John Armstrong, were sent to press 
in the previous fiscal year. The longer Onondaga text contains more than 44,000 
words in the Onondaga dialect, to about one-third of which an interlinear translation 
has been added. The first draft of a free translation of it was completed in October 
of the previous fiscal year. This manuscript will be ready for the press as soon as the 
interlinear translation is completed and the free translation is revised. With it 
will be submitted the shorter Seneca version, which is practically ready for the press. 

Later m tiie year much work was done on portions of the ritual of the Condoling 
Council of the League of the Iroquois.- A free translation was made of the Onondaga 
version of the so-called " Fourteen Matters" and al.so of the Mohawk version of the 
"Address of Welcome" of the Brother Mourning Nations, The 'Chant of Lamen- 
tation," requiring more than an hour to intone, was typewritten ready for interlinea- 
lion. This work has enabled Mr Hewitt to ascertain ap])roximately what is yet 
needful to complete his projected monograph on tlie Condoling Council of the League 
of the Iroquois. 



EEPOBT OF THE SECRETARY. 89 

In September Mr. Hewitt, assisted by the Rev. Jesse Kirk, an educated and intel- 
ligent Klamath quarter-blood Indian, undertook the special study of the system of 
blood relationships and affinities among the Klamaths of the Lutuamian linguistic 
family to ascertain whether or not these people have a clan system. This was done 
by means of two charts, one for the paternal and the other for the maternal lines of 
descent. It was shown by this study that the Klamaths have no clan system such 
as that prevailing among the Iroquois. An extensive vocabulary of Klamath vocfibies 
was also obtained from the Rev. Mr. Kirk, coverings? manuscript pages. Mr. Hewitt 
also devoted nuich time to work in connection with the Dictionary of Indian Tribes, 
furnishing, among other contributions, the articles "Adoption," "Confederacy," and 
"Attakapan Family." 

During the year Mr. Hewitt's regular research work has been interfered with to a 
very considerable extent by duties imposed in connection with the official corre- 
spondence of the Bureau. Many communications were received calling for informa- 
tion regarding the native languages, especially the significance of names and the 
interpretation of jihrases and sentences, and these were for the greater part referred to 
Mr. Hewitt for report. Besides this a num];)er of manuscripts forwarded for examina- 
tion or forpurchase have been placed in his hands for expert consideration. 

In past years jNIr. Hewitt has taken some part in the care of the great collection of 
manuscripts in the Bureau vaults, and toward the close of the present year he was 
aj^pointed custodian of manuscripts. In this capacity he has again taken up the 
work of identifying, classifying and cataloguing these documents — a work of no little 
difficulty and requiring much time. 

Dr. John R. Swanton was engaged for the greater part of the year in copying and 
translating texts obtained by him from the Haida Indians of Queen Charlotte 
Islands, British Columbia, during the winter of 1900-1901. There are two series of 
these texts taken in the dialects of Skidegate and IVIasset, respectively. Of the Skide- 
gate series there are 75 texts (one-third of which are war stories), covering about 360 
typewritten pages, and of the Masset series about 90 texts, covering about the same 
numljer of pages. These texts will be ready for publication early in the next fiscal 
year. 

Doctor Swanton has also been engaged in the preparation of a grammatical study 
of the Haida language, which, while it is not exhaustive, will cover all essential 
points. He has also in hand a dictionary of the Haida language. 

Doctor Swanton has assisted Mr. Hodge in the compilation of the Dictionary of 
Indian Tribes, and has revised, copied, and arranged all the descriptive material for 
the Chimmesyan, Koluschan, Salishan, Skittagetan, Takilman, and Wakashan lin- 
guistic families. 

Dr. Albert S. Gatschet has continued his linguistic work, giving principal attention 
to the completion of a work on Algonquian texts, including the Peoria. Miami, and 
Wea dialects. He has also made some progress in the preparation of a Peoria dic- 
tionary and grammar, and in addition has rendered substantial aid in furnishing 
linguistic data called for by correspondents of the Bureau. 

Dr. Frank Russell, ethnologist, spent most of the previous year among the Pima 
Indians of Arizona, and on the return journey paid a brief visit to the Muskwaki 
tribe in Iowa, reaching Washington in July. The report on his re.searches will appear 
in the Twenty-fourth Annual Re[)ort of the Bureau under the title "The Pima 
Indians of Arizona." His active connection with the Bureau ceased on October 30, 
but certain unfinished portions of the work were completed subsequently. 

Dr. Stewart Culin, curator of anthropology in the museum of the Brooklyn 
Institute, has made progress in the preparation of a monograph on native American 
gafnes which has been on hanii for some years. It is planned to have it appear in 
the Twenty-fourth Annual Report. 

In September Mr. R. H. Partridge was commissioned by the Acting Director to 



40 KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

visit New Mexico for the purpose of mapping certain ancient ruins situated in the 
valley of the Rio liermoso, Socorro County. A month was spent in the work, and 
the map produced and a brief report descriptive of the exploration have been placed 
in the Bureau archives. 

Dr. Albert E. Jenks, ethnologist, on furlough from the Bureau and connected with 
the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes in the Philippine Islands, has communicated 
some details of a successful expedition conducted by himself among the Bontoc 
Igorrotes of northern Luzon. About the close of the year he became acting chief of 
the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes, Doctor Barrows, the chief, having been 
appointed commissioner. of education for the islands. 

Under the immediate direction of Dr. Franz Boas, honorary ethnologist, impor- 
tant linguistic studies were made by Mr. H. H. St. Clair, 2nd, among the Ute, 
Shoshoni, and Comanche tribes. Numerous texts, grammatical notes, and vocabu- 
laries were collected, and in parts of this work the phonograph was used with suc- 
cess. The instrument was employed for recording the dictation of old men, and 
then the record was repeated slowly by interpreters. During the winter months 
Mr, St. Clair assisted Doctor Boas in the office, carrying forward various linguistic 
studies. In addition, Mr. St. Clair continued work on a Chinook dictionary, on which 
considerable progress had previously been made, and in June, 1903, he began work 
among certain tribal remnants in Oregon, more particularly the Alsea, Coosa, and 
Takilma. 

Under Doctor Boas' s supervision Mr. William Jones continued his linguistic work 
among the Sauks and Foxes. He has made a large collection of text.*^, all of which 
have been copied, and has also elaborated a detailed grannnar of the language of 
these tribes. He has succeeded in carrying out the analysis of the Algonquian 
language in a much more satisfactory manner than did any of the older authors, such 
as Baraga, Howse, Cuoq, and Lacombe. It is expected that the manuscript of his 
grammatical studies will be completed by the end of the present calendar year. In 
the spring of 1903 Mr. Jones made investigations of the language of the Kickapoos, 
obtaining a considerable amount of linguistic material from among that tribe. 

Besides directing the work of these assistants. Doctor Boas has continued his 
investigation of the grammar of the Tsimshian and Chinook languages. 

The ripening of linguistic studies in America initiates a new era in this branch of 
research. Powell gave great imjietus to the work, and numerous other students 
have devoted their energies assiduously to the important task of recording and clas- 
sifying the American languages and applying the results to the elucidation of the 
history of languages and j^eoples. The ultimate object of the work conducted under 
the direction of Doctor Boas is a morphological classification of the languages of 
America. The enumeration of linguistic stocks published l)y Major Powell in the 
seventh annual report of the Bureau, is based entirely on vocabularies, many of which 
are veryl)rief. By means of the study of the morphology of languages more remote 
relationships can be traced and the results of the lexicographer's comparisons can be 
checked. The grammatical studies that are carried on at present will therefore serve 
to elucidate many of the obscure parts of the earlier history of our country and the 
significance of the multitude of languages of California and the lower Mississippi 
region. The work is being done in systematic cooperation with investigators not 
connected with the Bureau. Among these are Dr. A. L. Kroeber, of the University 
of California, Dr. Roland B. Dixon, of Harvard University, and'a few other students 
who are collecting material in California, partly for the University of California, 
partly for the American Museum of Natural History. Up to the present time the 
Bureau has taken up, in connection with this work, morphological studies of the 
languages of the northwest coast and of the Siouan, Shoshonean, and Algonquian 
stocks, three of the largest on our continent. The work has so far advanced that it is 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 41 

proposed to prepare at once a handbook of the American languages as a preliminary 
publication. 

The Bureau has had under way for some years the transcription of the Diccionario 
de j\Iotul, a manuscript ]\Iaya-Spanish dictionary, borrowed from the library of the 
University of Pennsylvania. The copy is intended for the use of Seilor Andomaro 
Molina, of Merida, Yucatan, who is engaged in compiling a Maya-English dictionary 
to be published by the Bureau. The transcription was in the hands of Miss Jessie 
E. Thomas, librarian of the Bureau, but her untimely death in January brought 
the work to a close. The dictionary was returned to the university library on March 
15, as previously arranged, but permission has since been granted to bring it again 
to Washington when a competent copyist is found. 

An important feature of the work of the year has been the preparation of material 
for a dictionary of the Indian tribes. It was the Secretary's wish that this under- 
taking should be carried rapidly to completion, and Mr. F. W. Hodge, formerly of 
the Bureau, but now connected directly with the parent Institution, was detailed to 
take charge of the work. Mr. Hodge arranged to spend the afternoon of each day 
at the Bureau, and was thus able to personally direct the work, a report on which is 
here presented. 

DICTIONARY OF INDIAN TRIBES. 

At the time of the early exploration and settlement of North America there were 
encountered many Indian tribes varying in customs and speaking diverse lan- 
guages. Lack of knowledge of the aborigines and ignorance of their languages led 
to many curious errors on the part of the early explorers and settlers; names 
were applied to the Indians that had no relation whatever to those by which they 
were aboriginally known; sometimes nicknames were bestowed, owing, perhaps, to 
some personal characteristic, fancied or real; sometimes there was applied the name 
given by another tribe, which was often opprobrious; frequently an effort was made 
to employ the designation by which a tribal group knew itself, and, as such names 
are often unpronounceable by an alien tongue and unrepresentable by a civilized 
alphabet, the result was a sorry corruption, varying as the sounds were impressed 
on English, Spanish, French, Dutch, Russian, or Swedish ears, or as they were 
recorded in many languages, only to be as grossly corrupted when the next traveler 
appeared. 

Sometimes, again, bands of a single tribe would be given distinctive names, while 
clans or gentes would be regarded as independent, autonomous groups to which 
separate tribal designations were likewise applied. Consequently, in the literature 
of the American Indians, which is practically coextensive with the literature of the 
first three centuries of the New World, thousands of tribal names are encountered, 
only a small proportion of which are recognizable at a glance; therefore, one of the 
most practical and important studies which was undertaken at the inception of the 
work of the Bureau was the classification of these names with the view of their pub- 
lication as an Indian synonymy. As time passed, however, the scope of the work 
was enlarged, for, as the studies of the Bureau were prosecuted, a large amount of 
information in regard to the tribes, both past and present, was gained, so that it was 
deemed desirable to make of the work a cyclopedia or dictionary of the Indians, 
containing tril)al synonyms. 

The work continued at intervals during several years, most of the scientific corps, 
particularly Mr. James Mooney, being engaged in the compilation, under the general 
supervision of Mr. H. W. Henshaw, until 1891, when, owing to failure of health, 
Mr. Henshaw was compelled to relinquish ethnologic work. Later the task was 
assigned to Mr. Hodge, who continued it, so far as his other duties permitted, until 
early in 1901, when he was transferred to the office of the Smithsonian Institution. 
The work was continued, with many interruptions, until November of the present 



42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

fiscal year, when, as has been stated, Mr. Hodge was again assigned to the task. In 
accordance with the Secretary's wish, the scope of the work was enlai'ged to inchide 
not only descriptions of the Indian stocks, confederacies, tribes, subtribes, phratries, 
bands, clans, gentes, and settlements, as previously i)lanned, ])ut also biographies of 
the most noted Indians, sketches of the native manners, arts, and customs, and a list 
of Indian words incorporated into the English language. 

The facilities of the Bureau were immediately made available, most of the scientific 
corps devoting at least a part of their time to the work, while the services of others 
not officially connected with the Bureau were enlisted in directions in which their 
special knowledge would be adv.antageous. To this end the Athapascan stock was 
assigned first to Dr. Washington Matthews, whose ill health unfortunately com- 
pelled him to relinquish it, when it was given to Dr. J. H. McCormick; the Atta- 
capan, Beothukan, Iroquoian, and Uchean stocks were assigned to Mr. J. N. B. 
Hewitt; the Chimakuan, Chinookan, Kalapooian, Kusan, Lutuamian, Shaliaptian, 
Takilnian, VVaiilatpuan, and Yakonan to Dr. Livingston Farrand; the Chimmesyan, 
Koluschan, Salishan, Skittagetan, and Wakashan to Dr. John R. Swanton; the Cal- 
fornian stocks to Dr. A. L. Kroeber and Dr. Roland B. Dixon; the Algonquian, 
Chitimachan, Karankawan, Muskhogean, Natchesan, Shoshonean, Siouan, and 
TinuKjuanan to Dr. Cyrus Thomas; the Caddoan to Mr. James Mooney; the Eski- 
mauan, to Dr. J. H. Bair, and the Kitunahan to Dr. A. F. Chamberlain, while the 
Piman and the Pueblo stocks were undertaken personally by Mr. Hodge. At the 
close of the year the work on these stock and tribal descriptions had been well 
advanced, most of the important as well as a number of the smaller linguistic groups 
being entirely ready for final editorial revision. Owing to pressure of other duties, 
a number of the specialists not officially connected with the Bureau required more 
time than was expected, so that some of the outstanding material can not be finished 
as soon as was desired. 

In accordance with the plan of enlargement of the scope of the dictionary outlined by 
the Secretary, a schedule of all the subjects tliought to be necessary was jirepared and 
they were assigned to the specialists to be succinctly written. Those who have been 
engaged in this part of the work are Mr. AV. H. Holmes, Mr. F. W. Hodge, Dr. Cyrus 
Thomas, INIr. J. N. B. Hewitt, Dr. A. F. Chamberlain, Mr. James Mooney, Prof. 6. T. 
Mason, Dr. Walter Hough, Miss Alice C. Fletcher, Dr. Washington Matthews, Dr. 
J. R. Swanton, Mr. Joseiih D. McGuire, Dr. Frank Russell, and Mr. Stewart Culin. 
At the close of the fiscal year nearly all of the 300 or more articles thus assigned were 
completed, as was the bibliography of works cited in the tribal descriptions of the 
dictionary. This latter was prepared by Mr. McGuire. 

For several weeks Mr. Hodge has been engaged in putting in final form the first 
half of the material for the finst of the proposed two volumes. The first of the 
Algonquian descriptions (A to M), recorded on about 10,000 cards, were more than 
half revised for the j)! inter by the close of June, and many more stocks were awaiting 
similar editorial treatment. 

EXPOSITION WORK. 

Eariy in the year an allotment of |2,000 was made by the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion, from funds placed at its disposal by the Government board of the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition, to be used by the Bureau in preparing an exhibit for the 
exposition. It is arranged that this exhibit shall comprise ethnological and archaeo- 
logical collections illustrative of the research work of the Bureau, and instructions 
have been given to members of the staff in the field to take up the work. Progress 
has been reported by Dr. J. W. Fewkes, who will illustrate his researches in the 
West Indies; by Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson, who will collect specimens illus- 
tratmg Zuni arts and customs, and by Mr. James Mooney, who has in hand a series 
of exhibits de.signed to represent the heraldic systems of the Plains Indians. 



REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 43 



ILLUSTRATIONS. 



The illustrations are a most important feature of the research and i)ul)lication 
work of the Bureau. They consist of drawings, photographs, rubbings, engravings, 
etc., derived from many sources, and either used in the illustration of papers or 
filed for reference. The photographic work includes the making of photographs of 
all visiting Indians, copying pictures and maps, and photographing specimens. 

Mr. DeLancey Gill has continued in charge of illustrations, the volume of work 
being about the same as in previous years. The preparation of illustrations, the 
criticism and revision of engravers' proofs, and the iihotographic work have been 
carried on in the usual manner. Illustrations for Doctor Fewke's paper on his Porto 
Rican studies, consisting of 25 original drawings and photographs, were prepared and 
sent with the manuscrii^t to the Public Printer. Engraved proofs of 330 drawings and 
photographs, intended for use in the Twenty-second Annual Report, have been 
received from*the Public Printer during the year, and have been criticised and cor- 
rected. The printed editions of 107 colored plates, representing nearly 1,000,000 
impressions, to be used in the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Annual reports, have 
been examined by Mr. Gill and the imperfect work rejected. Drawings to the 
number of about 200, intended for forthcoming reports by Mrs. M. C. Stevenson and 
Dr. Stewart Culin, were executed by contract under the supervision of the authors. 
The preparation of illustrations for reports following the Twenty-third was taken 
up toward the close of the year. 

The photographic work has progressed satisfactorily. Six hundred and forty-six 
62 by 8.T inch negatives have been made 123 of which were exposed in the field by 
Dr. Frank Russell and developed in the office laboratory. About five hundred 4 by 5 
inch films were exposed in the field by Dr. Fewkes, and also developed in the otfice 
laljoratory, and a large number of portraits of visiting Indians were made during 
the year. In all, 1,146 negatives were added to the collection and 1,341 prints were 
made. 

Detailed plans by Mr. Gill of three of the great ruined buildings of Mexico, the 
temple of Xochicalco, the temple of the Columns, Mitia, and the House of the Gov- 
ernor, Uxmal, were prepared for use in constructing models of the buildings for the 
Louisiana Purchase Exposition exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution. 



COLLECTIONS. 



For a number of years previous to the separation of the Bureau of Ethnology from 
the Geological Survey, and also since the separation took place, the Bureau has made 
extensive collections of objects illustrating its researches and forming the basis for 
important studies. The collections have usually been catalogued on arrival at the 
Bureau, and after serving their purposes for study and illustration have been trans- 
ferred to the United States National Museum, where they have been recorded and 
properly accredited to the Bureau. 

During the year important collections have been made as follows: Archaeological 
collection from Santo Domingo and Porto Rico, by Dr. J. W. Fewkes, 1,210 speci- 
mens; archieological collection from an aboriginal hematite mine in Missouri, by W. 
H; Holmes and Gerard Fowke, 160 specimens; collection of fiiiit implements from 
Indiana and Kentucky, by Gerard Fowke, many thousands of specimens; ethno- 
logical collection from Zufii Pueblo, Arizona, by Mrs. M. C. Stevenson, 220 specimens. 
These have been transferred to the National Museum along with numerous other 
collections found in the Bureau offices and in storage. The latter include a large col- 
lection from the Maine coast shell heaps, made by Mr. F. H. Gushing, 3,058 specimens; 
an important collection of ethnological material from the Pima Indians of Arizona, 
made l)y Dr. Frank Russell, 324 specimens, and numerous small collections and 
single specimens. These collections have been accompanied by all available data 



44 EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

relating to them, and are so placed at the Museum as to be convenient for study by 
the various collectors in preparing their reports and ])y students generally. 

MANUSCRIPTS. 

Of peculiar value and interest are the manuscripts brought together in the archives 
of the Bureau. They number upward of 1,600 and relate chiefly to the Indian lan- 
guages. Three hundred and thirty-two of these documents were transferred to the 
Bureau on its organization by the Smithsonian Institution. Many others have been 
jjresented to the Bureau since that time, while a large number have been purchased 
from the authors. Not a few have been prepared by employees of the Bureau, and, 
because fragmentary or not fully elaborated, have been filed awaiting completion and 
for reference. A valual)le body of linguistic data is thus preserved and available for 
the use of students. Besides the linguistic material many miscellaneous manuscripts 
and documents have accumulated. A few of these are historical, but^the majority 
relate to the aborigines. These manuscripts are kept in two fireproof vaults in the 
main office and have been recently placed under the custodianship of Mr. J. N. B. 
Hewitt, ethnologist. 

PUBLICATIONS. 

Historij of Oie series. — When the United States Geographical and Geological Survey 
of the Rocky Mountain Region was discontinued, by act of Congress approved March 
3, 1879, it had published two volumes (1 and 3) of a quarto series of Contributions to 
North American Ethnology. The same act made an a])proi3riation for completing and 
preparing for publication other volumes of the series. The work was put in charge of 
Maj. J. W. Powell, previously Director of the Rocky Mounta-rn Survey, and the 
Bureau of Ethnology was organized. The new Bureau continued the publication of 
the Contributions, and in 1880 the Director began a series of annual reports of prog- 
ress to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, which were published, with 
accompanying scientific papers, in handsomely illustrated royal octavo volumes. 
The printing of the volumes of both series was at first specially authorized by Con- 
gressional resolutions, but on March 2, 1881, volumes 6 to 10 of the Contributions 
were provided for by a single resolution. 

Under authority of a joint resolution of August 5, 1886, the Director of the Bureau 
commenced in the -following year the publication of a series of bulletins in octavo 
form, unbound, which was continued by authority of the concurrent resolution of 
July 28, 1888. The puljlic printing act of January 28, 1895, which superseded all 
previous acts and resolutions relating to jiublic printing and binding, provided for 
the continuance of the series of annual reports only. At that time there had been 
published, or were in course of publication, 8 volumes of Contributions to North 
American Ethnology, numbered 1-7 and 9, 24 bulletins, and 13 annual reports. 

From 1895 to 1900 the Bureau issued the series of annual reports only, l)ut on 
April 7 of the latter year Congress passed a concurrent resolution authorizing the 
commencement of a new series of bulletins in royal octavo, uniform with the annual 
reports. Three numbers of this series (25 to 27) have been issued. The present 
edition of both aimual reports and bulletins is 9,682 copies, of which the Senate 
receives 1,500, the House 3,000, and the Bureau 3,500 (of which 500 are distributed 
by the Smithsonian Institution). From the remaining 1,682 are drawn the personal 
copies of the members of Congress, those for the Library of Congress and a few other 
Government libraries, and those sold by the Superintendent of Documents and 
distributed by him to various libraries throughout the country. 

Besides the series mentioned there have been issued small editions of several mis- 
cellaneous publications intended chiefly or wholly for the use of collaborators and 
correspondents. These comprise three introductions to the study of aboriginal 
activities (one having been previously published by the Rocky Mountain Survey); a 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45 

collection of Indian gesture signs; a set of proof sheets of a bibliography of North 
American languages; a provisional list of the principal North American tribes, with 
synonyms, and two samples of style for the Dictionary of American Indians, now in 
preparation. 

There have been issued up to the present time 19 annual reports, of which 4 are 
in 2 parts; 27 bulletins, of which 2-1 are in octavo, unbound, and 3 are in royal 
octavo, bound; 8 volumes of Contril)utions, of which one is in 2 parts; 4 introduc- 
tions to the study of aboriginal activities, and 6 miscellaneous pamphlets — 69 vol- 
umes and pamphlets in all. 

Subjecl-maller of the papers. — The papers published have covered the entire range of 
aboriginal characters, activities, and history. Seven deal largely (3 of them almost 
wholly) with the classification of the tribes; almost all contain some cyclopedic 
material, but only 1 is devoted to it chiefly, while 18 others have a large amount 
of such material; 3 deal chiefly and 9 largely with history and tradition, and 3 are 
concerned with relations with the whites as shown through land cessions and reser- 
vations. Of those treating of aboriginal activities, 3 deal chiefly and 12 largely with 
social organization; 50 are devoted to arts and industries, and 20 more contain con- 
siderable material on this subject; 40 are devoted chiefly to linguistics and perhaps 
35 to mythology and folklore, and a number of others contain material on both these 
topics. The whole constitute a record of great practical value to those dealing with 
the interests of the native tribes, and are of the utmost importance to the science 
of man. 

Publicalions of the year. — The Nineteenth Annual Report, Bulletins 25 and 27, and 
a sample of style of the Dictionary of Indian Tribes (250 copies printed by the 
Smithsonian Institution for the use of collaborators) have been issued during the 
year, the Nineteenth Annual in October, 1902, Bulletin 25 in June, 1903, Bulletin 27 
in January, 1903, and the pamjihlet early in the same year. 

Forthcoming j)ublicatioiis.-—T\\QTviGx\\wih., Twenty-first, and Twenty-second Annual 
Reports are in press, the former being almost completed, and the Twenty-third 
Report, containing Mrs. M. C. Stevenson's paper on the esoteric and exoteric life of 
the Zuiii and Dr. Frank Russell's paper on the Pima Indians, are nearly ready for 
transmission to the Public Printer. A paper on Haida Texts, by John R. Swanton, 
and a series of i»apers on Mexican and Mayan antiquities, history, and calendar 
systems, by Eduard Seler, E. Furstemann, Paul Schellhas, Carl Sapper, and E. P. 
Dieseldorff, is in preparation, and the following unassigned papers have been sub- 
mitted: Algonquian Texts (Peoria, JNIiauii, and Wea), by A. S. Gatschet; List of 
Linguistic Families of Mexico and Central America, by Cyrus Thomas. 

DISTRIBUTION OF THK PUBLICATIONS. 

Publications are sent to two classes of recipients: First, regularly, without special 
request, to working anthropologists, public libraries, scientific societies, institutions 
of learning, and others who are able to contribute to the work of the Bureau through 
publications, ethnologic specimens, or manuscript notes; second, to others in response 
to special requests, frequently indorsed by members of Congress. 

During the year 1,380 copies each of the Nineteentii Annual Report and Bulletins 
26 and 27 have been sent to regular recipients, about one-half of these going to the 
United States, and 3,600 miscellaneous volumes and pamphlets have been sent in 
response to about an equal number of special requests. More than 200 of these 
requests have come through Congressmen, and about 400 volumes have been sent in 
response. 

EDITORI.\L WORK. 

The editorial work has been in charge of Mr. II. S. Wood, assisted during .July, 
August, and a part of September, 1902, by Dr. Elbert J. Benton. Several sets of 



46 EEPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

proofs have also been read by the job. The work has comprised the proof reading of 
the Twentieth Annual Report, Bulletin 27, and Bulletin 25, and of the galleys of the 
Twenty-first and Twenty-second Annual Reports, the preparation of a list of abbre- 
viations for Bulletin 25, and the reading in manuscript of the ^Slayan and Mexican 
papers already mentioned. 



Although V>ooks and documents relating to ethnology were collected to a limited 
extent by the Geological Surveys almost from their inception, the library of the 
Bureau did not have a separate existence until 1882, at which time a librarian 
was first appointed in the United States Geological Survey, with which organization 
the Bureau was still domiciled. The systematic acquisition of volumes by purchase 
and exchange was begun at this time, though the first entry in the accessions list 
was not made until 1885. From then until the separation from the Survey the 
record shows a steady though slow growth, as allotments for purchase were small. 
At the time of the removal from the Survey building, in 1893, the accessioned vol- 
umes numbered about 2,500. Since that date growth has been more rapid, jjartly 
by reason of larger allotments for purchase, but chiefly through judicious exchange. 
The library now contains 11,803 volumes, something over 6,000 pamphlets, and 
several thousand numbers of periodicals, many of which should ])e bound and 
entered on the accessions list. 

Only works dealing with the American Indians and such general anthropologic 
works as are needed for constant reference are purchased, though books and papers 
dealing with all branches of anthropology and with related sciences are received by 
exchange. 

During the year there have been received 524 volumes, about 600 ])amphiets, and 
the current numbers of more than 500 periodicals. 

PKOi'EKTV. 

The property of the Bureau may be comprised in seven classes, as follows: ( 1 ) Office 
furniture, appliances, and supplies; (2) field outfits; (3) ethnologi<! manuscripts and 
other documents; (4) illustrations — photographs, drawings, etc.; (5) books and 
periodicals; (6) collections held temporarily by collaborators for use in research; 
(7) undistributed residue of the editions of Bureau publications. 

The additions to the office and field jiroperty during the year have been few and 
unimportant. Numerous minor manuscripts have ))een added, principally in con- 
nection with the Dictionary of Indian Tribes. The illustrations material has been 
increased by several hundred negatives and by numerous prints and drawings. The 
library has continued to grow steadily through exchange and purchase. 



When the present Chief took charge of the office Mr. F. M. Baj-nett was occupying 
the position of custodian of accounts and ])roperty. It was ascertained during the 
spring that vouchers were being tamj^ered with by him, and he was promptly arrested 
and indicted. 

A critical examination of the Bureau accounts thus became necessary, and all 
papers connected with disbursements were at once turned over to the disbursing 
officer of the Smithsonian Institution, who proceeded to give them the fullest atten- 
tion. One noteworthy result of this examination was the discovery of the fact that 
deficiencies existed for the years 1901 and 1902 amounting to between $600 and $700. 
Fortunately the accounts at the close of the present year were in such shape that a 
sufficient balance remains to liquidate this indebtedness if Congress so desires. At 
the close of the year the accounting work was again placed in charge of the Bureau, 
and along with its other affairs was reorganized and put on a proper business footing. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47 

Necrology, 
jessie e. thomas. 

On January 14, 1903, a skating accident caused the death of Miss Jessie E. Thomas, 
librarian of the Bureau. 

Miss Thomas was born at Carbondale, HI., October 31, 1875. She received a i>ub- 
lic school education, and studied French, German, and Spanish under private 
teachers; and during four years which she spent as secretary and assistant to her 
father, Dr. Cyrus Thomas, of the Bureau, she gained considerable knowledge of the 
Maya language and of the literature relating to the American Indians in general, as 
well as some experience in proof reading and in bil)liographic work. She acquired 
familiarity with library methods through attendance at the Columbian University, 
Washington, D. C, and in May, 1900, was temporarily appointed to fill a vacancy in 
the staff of the Bureau library, of which Mr. F. W. Hodge was then in charge. In 
September the appointment was made permanent, after Miss Thomas had passed 
highest on an examination given by the United States Civil Service Commission to 
fill the position. 

On Mr. Hodge's resignation in the following January she was put in full charge, 
and from that time vnitil her death performed the difficult task of managing an 
imperfectly arranged and catalogued lil)rary with marked ability. Much of her time 
was taken up by the copying of the ^lotul Dictionary (Maya-Spanish, Spanish-^Iaya) 
from the late Doctor Brinton's collection, and in addition to her other duties she 
gave considerable attention to bibliographlic studies intended to lessen the labors of 
students of anthropology. 

Her extreme carefulness and methodical habits are well illustrated by the perfect 
order in which all her work was left, and her staunch character, her modest 
demeanor and lovable disposition were highly appreciated by her associates. 

.TOnX WESLEY POWELL. 

John Wesley Powell, founder and director of the Bureau of American Ethnology, 
\«'as born March 24, 1834, at Mount Morris, N. Y. He died September 23, 1902, at 
his summer home in Haven, Me., and was buried with the honors due a soldier in 
Arlington National Cemetery. 

His boyhood was spent largely in the town of Jackson, Ohio, where his mind was 
first directed toward the study of nature by James Crookham, an eccentric but able 
teacher of the village youth. He was a student for brief periods in Jacksonville 
and Oberlin colleges, and, taking up natural-history studies, traversed many sections 
of the Middle West and South, observing, studying, and collecting. It was thus, no 
doubt, that he acquired a decided bent for exploration, but it was probably his 
experience as an officer in the civil war that developed the masterly qualities which 
made him a leader among men and an organizer in the realm of science. 

At the close of the war, declining political preferment, he resumed his scientific 
studies and engaged in teaching and in lecturing on geology. During his con- 
nection with Wesleyan University and tlie Illinois State Normal University he 
conducted classes in the field, and thus became more and more fully a devotee of 
research. In 1867 he found his way to the Far West, where later he reached the 
climax of his career as an explorer in his memorable voyage down the Grand Canyon 
of the Colorado. This expedition brought into play his splendid courage and com- 
manding abilities, and the story of his adventures is fraught with deep romantic 
interest. On these voyages of exploration contact with the native tribes gave him 
an interest in ethnology, and thenceforth for many years his energies were divided 
almost equally between the sciences of geology and anthropology. 

Major Powell's mind was so broadened and strengthened by the varied experiences 



48 EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

of his early career that when he was called upon to enter the service of the nation 
as explorer, geologist, geographer, and ethnologist he naturally assumed the role of 
organizer. He gathered about him the best available men in the various depart- 
ments of science, assigning them to the fields for which their abilities particularly 
fitted them; but at all times he was the master spirit, compassing with clear vision 
the widest horizon, and easily pointing the wa\' to even the ablest. His vigorous 
methods were an inspiration and his large-mindedness and generosity made a deep 
impression on scores of students, who recognized the potent influence exerted by 
the master. 

As Director of the Geological Survey Major Powell originated and conducted many 
enterprises of importance to science and to public welfare, but he was finally forced 
by failing health to turn his back upon all branches of the public service save that 
relating to the Indian tribes, and in 1893 he resigned the directorship of the Geo- 
logical Survey to devote the remainder of his life to the science of man, and as 
Director of the Bureau of American Ethnology achieved results that establish his 
claim to lasting renown. The Bureau of American Ethnology is peculiarly his own, 
the lines of research initiated by him being in the main those that must be followed 
as long as the Bureau lasts, and in fact as long as the human race remains a subject 
for study. Although the investigations made and directed by Powell related almost 
exclusively to the American race, the results are so broad as to apply to all mankind. 
It was a fortunate circumstance that his energies were directed to a field little 
encumbered by the forms, methods, and determinations of earlier students, since it 
enabled him to conduct his investigations on new lines and thus to raise the science 
to a higher plane. 

The great series of volumes published by the Bureau, more completely Powell's 
own than the world can ever know, area splendid monument to his memory, a mon- 
ument that will lose none of its impressiveness as the years and generations pass, 
and when, a little later, the race of red men and their unique culture are but shad- 
ows on the face of the world, and other primitive peoples have likewise passed for- 
ever out of view, this monument that Powell has reared will stand, not only for 
himself but for the nation among the most important contributions to human history 
ever made by an individual, an institution, or a State. The world of the future, 
viewing Powell's career, will thank the guiding star that led the farmer boy to become 
a teacher, the teacher a soldier, the soldier an explorer, the explorer a geologist, and 
the geologist a historian of a vanishing race. 

Respectfully submitted. 

W. H. Holmes, Chief of Bureau.

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 



Appendix III. 



REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE 

SERVICE. 



INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE 



Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the Inter- 
national Exchange Service during the year ending June 30, 1903. 

The work required of this branch of the Smith- I9O3 

sonian Institution is more essentially of a business 
nature than that of any of its dependencies. The 
duties of the Exchange Service consist chiefly of 
transporting publications from Washington to all 
foreign lands, however remote, and of receiving 
publications from other countries, recording, and 
forwarding them by registered mail to their respec- 
tive addresses in the United States. 

The requirements of the service necessitate the 
handling of many packages, a large number of 
which consist of heavy boxes. This fact renders it 
necessary that the work should be conducted on the 
ground floor, for which reason the south basement 
of the Institution was remodeled ten years ago for 
the express use of the Exchange Service and the 
five rooms thus provided have since been applied 
to its uses. These rooms have been furnished with 
assorting tables, bins, record filing cases, and such 
other office appliances as are necessary for the use of 
clerks and other assistants. 

Although several delays have occurred in the 
delivery of parcels to addresses in other countries, 
none of them has been due to negligence on the 
part of the Institution. In some instances delay 
was due to natural causes, and hence was unavoid- 
able; but in the greater number of instances the 
delay in delivery was by reason of the fact that 
insufficient means are provided in some countries 
for conducting their respective exchange bureaus in 
a manner to insure prompt delivery of parcels for- 
warded in their care. 

So far as reported, in only on-e instance during 
the year has any damage occurred to exchanges in 
transit, and even in this case it is believed that the 
injury was only slight. In January, 1903, the 
steamship La Savoie, of the Compagnie Generale 
Transatlantique, while making a voyage from New 
York to Havre, shipped water during a gale, and 
a consignment of 13 cases for French correspondents 
becoming wet a part of the contents was slightly 
damaged. It may be regarded as (]uite remarkable 
that only one accident of this character should have occurred, although several hun- 
dred shipments were made during the year.

REPOKT OF THE SECRET AKY. 



In the report on the International Exchange Service for the year 1901 reference was 
made to the loss of two cases of exchanges by fire and water in the hold of the steam- 
ship Castano while loading at her pier in Brooklyn, preparatory to sailing for Aus- 
tralian ports. This loss has now been adjusted, and the contributors of the packages 
will soon be paid the approximate value of their respective publications. 

No better proof can be desired of the appreciation of the facilities afforded the 
public by the International Exchange Service than the constant increase in the num- 
ber of transmissions by old patrons of the service as well as the growing use to which 
the service is put by taking advantage of its privileges for the first time. 

In order to appreciate the increase in the work of the year over that of the preced-

and other countries during the fiscal year ending June 30, 190S. 

ing twelve months, it should be observed that, including all classes of exchanges, 
150,217 packages, weighing 559,718 pounds, were handled in 1902-3, as against 125,796 
packages, weighing 396,418 pounds, during the year 1901-2, an increase of 19 per 
cent and 41 per cent, respectively. The average weight of all packages transmitted 
during 1901-2 was 3 pounds, while the average per package during 1902-3 was nearly 
4 potmds. 

The total weight of exchange packages of domestic origin received during the year 
for transmission abroad aggregated 419,191 poimds, while the weight of exchanges 
from abroad was 140,527 pounds, or 75 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively. These 
figtires apparently do not do justice to foreign contributors, especially those in remote 
or thinly populated sections, since, being deprived of the advantages of accessible

exchange bureaus, they are compelled to forward their reciprocal contributions 
correspondents in the United States by post. 

The names of 
new correspond- 
ents in every part 
of the Morld are 
constantly being 
added to the ex- 
change list, so that 
they now reach a 
total of 44,012, 
subdivided as fol- 
lows: Foreign in- 
stitutions, 13,121; 
foreign individ- 
uals, 21,332; do- 
mestic institu- 
tions, 3,319; and 
domestic individ- 
uals, 6,240. De- 
tails by countries 
will be found in a 
subjoined table. 

These corre- 
spondents should 
not be considered 
as participating in 
an exchange with 
the Smithsonian 
Institution itself, 
but are the bene- 
ficiaries of the fa- 
cilities of the Ex- 
change Service at 
home and abroad. 

In 1897 a list of 
institutions in 
other countries, 
then numbering 
nearly 9,500, was 
printed for the use 
of the United 
States Exchange 
Service and sim- 
ilar bureaus 
a'jroad, and has 
been found to be 
of great use in fa- 
cilitating their op- 
erations. During

Several changes in the foreign relations of the Exchange Service have occurred 
during the year. 

Through the good offices of the Department of State arrangements were consum- 
mated with Cuba for a mutual exchange of official pulilications, and in December, 
1902, 7 boxes were shipped to Habana to l)e deposited in the library of the depart- 
ment of state at that capital. 

On December 29, 1902, a reserve set of 52 cases was forwarded to the London 
county council as an exchange for the municipal documents of the city of London. 

Transmissions to Pretoria were interrupted at the beginning of the Transvaal war, 
and the cases which had accumulated during hostilities were finally dispatched on 
March 20, 1903, to the governor of the Transvaal Colony. Later advices indicate 
that this set of documents will be deposited in the state library at Pretoria. 

Regular shipments will be made in future to the depositories in Habana, Pretoria, 
and London at the rate of about one case every two months. 

In January, 1903, the Queensland government established an exchange board, 
with headcjuarters in the Parliament House, Brisbane. This board has already 
taken up the matter of international exchanges in a systematic manner, and satis- 
factory results are sure to follow. 

Until further notice the Exchange Service is constrained to discourage the for- 
warding of parcels to the Smithsonian Institution for transmission to China except 
those bearing addresses in Shanghai. 

Reference has frequently been made in these re2)orts to the ri'strictions placed 



60 EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

upon exchanges forwarded to Japan for distribution. The department of foreign 
affairs at Tokyo, to which all consignments are sent by the Smithsonian Institution, 
is willing to receive only parcels designed for official institutions of the Japanese 
Government or for individuals connected therewith. Although frequent attempts 
have been made to induce the foreign office to distriljute all contri])utions for 
Japanese correspondents, they have thus far been of no avail. 

The United States minister to Ecuador has called the attention of the Institution 
to the delay and expense occasioned in transporting exchanges to Quito by mountain 
trail from the port of Guayaquil, and suggests that only documents of great impor- 
tance be sent to Quito until the railroad which is now building from the coast shall 
be completed, about two years hence.

The 50 sets of official documents provided by the joint resolution of Congress 
approved March 2, 1867, have all been placed in appreciative hands in other coun- 
tries, as noted in the preceding list. Finding that a still further exchange with for- 
eign governments was necessary in order to increase the collections in the Library of 
Congress, a joint resolution was approved March 2, 1901, providing 62 sets for distri- 
bution abroad in lieu of 50 sets as formerly, and further provision was made by this 
resolution for increasing the number of sets to 100 on the request of the Librarian of 
Congress. 

The distribution of tlie additional sets provided for by the joint resolution of March 
2, 1901, has been made through the International Exchange Service to such foreign 
depositories as the Librarian of Congress in his judgment has deemed expedient, 



64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

having solely in view the procurement of such publications in exchange as were 
especially desired l)y that library. 

On account of lack of space in the Smithsonian building for storing the additional 
sets provided for by the resolution of 1901, these documents have been delivered 
from the Government Printing Office to the Library of Congress, and in turn are 
forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution from time to time for transmission abroad 
as negotiations are consummated. When depositories for all these additional sets 
shall have been arranged for, however, it is expected that the documents will be 
delivered directly from the Government Printing Office to the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion, and that all uniform sets will then be shipped abroad at the same time and 
accompanied by duplicate printed lists of the contents of each case, as is now custom- 
ary when shipments are made to the original 50 depositories. 

The following is a list of the new depositories to which consignments have been 
made during the year: 

British Columbia: Legislative Assembly, Victoria. 

Cape Colony: Colonial Governor, Cape Town. 

France: Prefecture de la Seine, Paris. 

Germany: Foreign Office, Bremen. 

Guatemala: Secretary of the Government, Guatemala. 

Jamaica: Colonial Secretary, Kingston. 

Manitoba: Provincial Library, Winnipeg. 

Natal: Colonial Secretary's Office, Pietermaritzburg. 

New Brunswick: Legislative Library, Fredericton. 

Northwest Territories: Government Library, Regina. 

Nova Scotia: Legislative Lil)rary, Halifax. 

Prince Edward Island: Legislative Library, (Teorgetown. 

Dr. Felix Fliigel, Messrs. William Wesley & Son, and Dr. Joseph von Korosy con- 
tinue to act as agents of the Institution in Leipzig, London, and Budapest, respec- 
tively. In each instance the interests of the Institution generally, and those of the 
International Exchange Service in particular, are conducted with rare ability. 

To those correspondents abroad who give their personal attention and doubtless 
often expend private means in furthering the interests of international exchanges at 
large the grateful acknowledgment of the Institution should be accorded. 

The appreciation of the Smithsonian Institution and its branches is due to Mr. 
Charles A. King, deputy collector of the port of New York, for his constant assist- 
ance in clearing assignments froni abroad for the Institution. I desire to commend 
also the efficiency and faithfulness of the employes of the exchange service through- 
out the year. 

Respectfully submitted.

dollars; one-half of which sums for the National Zoological Fark shall be paid from 
the revenues of the District of Columbia and the other half from the Treasury of the 
United States. (Sundry civil act June 28, 1902. ) 

In submitting estimates to Congress .$20,000 was specified for the elephant house. 
Only half of this amount was appropriated, which was altogether inadequate for such 
a building as had been planned— in fact, was sulTicient only to inclose the required 
space with the cheapest i)ossible construction having the necessary strength. 

The preparation of new plans and specifications adapted to the amount available 
was begun as soon as the appr()]:)riation had l)een made and a contract for the work 
was let early in September. Work under the contract was commenced promptly and 
pushed as rapidly as circumstances would permit. There was some unavoidable 
delay in securing materials, but the building was completed early in January, 1903. 
The contract covered building proper, outdoor bathing pool, and fence for outside 
yard, and amounted to $8,594. Boiler and heating pipes and some other interior fit- 
tings and guard rail around outside yard were not included in the contract, this 
work being done by day labor. The total cost, including architect's commission, was 
110,000. About $500 also was expended from the general appropriation in necessary 
grading and construction of walks in the innnediate vicinity. 

The house is a plain, barn-like structure of brick, 35 by 65 feet inside, a space 35 
feet square being provided for the elephant, a 10-foot passage reserved for attendants, 
and a space 20 l)y 35 feet for the public. The outside yard is 79 by 96 feet and 
includes a concrete bathing pool 20 feet in diameter and 6 feet deep. The fence is 
6 feet high, constructed of steel throughout, and consists of I-beam posts, channel- 
beam rail, and pickets of 2|^-inch stiff, round steel 19 inches apart. Both posts and 
pickets are set in a heavy concrete base. A l)ar of 2-inch half-round iron, in which 
are set small pointed steel knobs, is fastened along the inner side of the rail to dis- 
courage the elephant from pushing against it. An area between the yard and pool, 
protected by a stockade, has been planted with shrubs and trees, which will soon 
shade to a considerable extent both yard and pool. The accompanying illustration 
shows the exterior appearance of the house and yard. The elephant was put in the 
house March 12, 1903. 

Besides the regular cost of maintenance, several important improvements have 
been made during the year from the general appropriation. 

Boundary fence. — The Secretary had for several years been urging upon Congress 
the need of replacing the wooden boundary fence, which was constructed in 1890. 
There was an increase of $10,000 in the general appropriation over the sum provided 
for the previous year, and this amount was applied to the construction of a new fence. 
Work was begun soon after the appropriation became available, and the fence was 
completed during autumn, except on a small portion of the boundary, where the 
grades are being changed to conform to newly constructed highways of the District of 
Columbia. The fence consists of Page woven-wire fencing, 72 inches wide, of extra, 
strength, and carried on posts of heavy iron pipe set in concrete bases. Three barbed 
wires are used al)ove, making the total height 90 inches. Heavy galvanized netting, 
extends 12 inches into the ground below for security against dogs. 

The amount available was not sufficient to provide suitable entrance gates, and 
temporary gates were made with wire fencing attached to a light frame of angle iron. 
The total cost of the fence was $10,000.

REPORT OP THE SECRETARY. 67 

• 
In connection with the building of the fence it became necessary to reestablish 
certain points on the boundary line where the grading of District highways had dis- 
placed the original marks or where the line had been altered since the official sur- 
vey was made. The surveyor of the District of Columbia was accordingly employed 
to resurvey the boundary and prepare a new and authoritative map. 

Bear yards. — Two bear yards begun at the close of the previous year have been 
completed. Provision has been made for a series of 10 yards, and the site for the 
entire series has been graded. The two central cages of the series were built and are 
occupied, respectively, by the Kodiak bear and the pair of polar bears. These cages 
are approximately 40 feet square, and each contains a bathing pool about 20 feet in 
diameter. The fence is 10 feet high, with an overhang inward of 2 feet 6 inches. It 
is constructed of vertical bars of |-inch stiff round steel, spaced 5 inches on centers, 
passing through horizontal rails of 2 J by | inch round-edged steel. Each yard is 
provided with a house in the rear, the front of which is of large weathered rocks laid 
up with wide irregular joints. Rear walls are of concrete. Each house has a grating 
door at front and rear and a grating across one end the entire width of the house. 
In winter a tight storm door is lifted into the rear opening, and the open end of the 
house is closed with a wooden panel. The door at the front is closed with a sliding 
grating, operated outside the house. There is also a grating door at the rear of the 
yard for the use of keepers, all attendance being from the rear. The cost, including 
grading, drainage, and water supply, has been $3,000. Trees have been planted 
about the cages, which after a few years will shade both animals and visitors. A 
trellis of light steel framework has been constructed over the public walk and the 
front part of the cages, and over this quick-growing vines are being trained, which 
will afford shade till the trees reach sufficient size to render such shade unnecessary. 
Eagle cage. — This structure«also was begun as the last fiscal year ended. It was 
completed early in the present year and at once occupied. The cage has proved to 
be very satisfactory, and it is hoped that in the near future similar structures can be 
built for other birds of prey, especially for the California condors, which now have to 
be kept in a cage of quite inadequate size. 

The following alterations and additions have been made to buildings and grounds 
during the year: 

Iniprorcmenta in aquarium. — The small aquarium maintained for several years in 
an old work shed proved to be of so much interest to visitors that it seemed advisa- 
ble to make some alterations in order to provide more satisfactory conditions for 
operation and exhibition. Under your instructions the lighting, which had been 
insufficient, was improved by putting in a continuous series of skylights on the north 
side and doubling the skylight area on the south side. A new exhibition tank, 12 
feet long, 3 feet 10 inches high, and 5 feet deep, was constructed at the end of the 
corridor. A second concrete storage tank for salt water was built and an extra pump 
and additional piping put in, so that the entire series of tanks on one side and the 
new end tank can be supplied with salt water. It was also recognized that a bare 
background of asphalted wood did not display fishes to advantage or give any proper 
idea of the surroundings in which they ordinarily live. Some of the tanks have 
therefore been lined with rock of different kinds, while in others cement has been 
combined with gravel and waterworn stones to give the background the appearance 
of a natural bank. Fresh-water plants, marine algae, sponges, etc., have been used 
as accessories in these tanks to produce, so far as possible, the appearance of natural 
conditions. The improvement thus made has been appreciated by the public as well 
as favorably commented on by persons engaged in aquarium work. 

A large mirror has been installed on the roof of the aquarium and so connected 
that it throws sunlight at all times of day, through colored glass, into one of the 
tanks. 



68 ' EEPORT OF THE SECRET AEY. 

• 

Addition to temporartj bird lionse. — It was found to be necessary to further enlarge 
the temporary bird house in order to furnish winter quarters for birds from the 
large flying cage. An extension 50 feet long and 85 feet wide was built at the north 
end with a height of 20 feet. The end of this extension was made into a single cage, 
20 by 35 feet, extending the full height of the building and provided with a pool, 
trees, etc. A considerable part of the birds from the flying cage were kept here dur- 
ing the winter. This addition made it possible to keep birds in a fairly comfortable 
manner, but, with accessions which have come in during the current year, especially 
from United States officers abroad, the collection has again quite outgrown the 
accommodations. 

Repairs to ardelope house. — When this house was built it was necessary, on account 
of insufficiency of funds, to use the cheapest materials. As a natural result some 
parts of the structure have already given away from decay. During the year it 
became necessary to put new floors in all of the large cages. The wooden floors 
were removed and replaced by a macadam surface on a base of stone laid in the 
"Telford" manner. Concrete walls were built to sustain the front of the cages aiid 
the partitions. New double partitions were also constructed, with doors sliding into 
them, and the outer wall was ceiled for greater warmth. 

Repairs to indosures. — Several of the inclosures for ruminant animals have required 
repairs during the year. The elk paddock was in such bad condition that the wire 
fencing had to be replaced for a distance of 100 rods, and at least an equal amount 
additii >nal will have to be rebuilt very soon. A fence possessing at once the desirable 
(lualities of lightness, strength, and durability is apparently not yet obtainable. 

■ Work on roadivays. — No new roatlways have been constructed during the year, but 
the driveway connecting with Klingle road was rebuilt for a distance of 300 feet in 
order to conform to the new grade established for that road. The ford on this drive- 
way was also paved with concrete, as the current of Rock Creek frequently eroded 
the natural bed at that point to such an extent as to render the crossing imsafe for 
carriages. Since this improvement was made there has been no further trouble of 
this kind. It also became necessary to remove the metaling from the roadway 
between Quarry road entrance and the bridge over the creek, as a considerable fill 
was required there to connect with the new entrance road constructed by the District 
at that point. 

Neiv entrance road from Kenesaw avenue. — The appropriations for the District of 
Columbia included the following item: " For Kenesaw avenue, entrance to Zoological 
Park, grading (and the Commissioners of the District of Columbia are authorized to 
adjust the lines of the streets at this locality so as to afford an entrance to the 
Zoological Park upon good and satisfactory grade, with authority to exchange with 
the owners of the abutting property any land now within the lines of said streets 
that may be necessary to accomplish said purpose: Provided, That no expense is 
incurred thereby bj' the United States or the District of Columbia) , ten thousand 
dollars." 

This entrance roadway has been graded throughout to a width of 50 feet. It has 
not as yet been otherwise improved, but will probably be graveled soon. A fill was 
required the entire length of the road, which extends into the park about 200 feet, 
and the side slope encroaches on the park the whole length. The park is now bor- 
dered on the east side from Quarry road to Klingle road by a bank of raw earth as 
steep as it will stand and from 15 to 40 feet high. Measures will have to be taken 
to i^rotect the meadow and woodland below from the wash, also to plant the slope 
so as to screen it and cover it with a growth of vegetation which will hold the earth 
and prevent erosion. 

Important accessions. — Dr. F. W. Goding, United States consul at Newcastle, New 
South Wales, secured for the park during the year the most important collections 
yet received from any one source, amounting to more than 140 specimens, among 



REPOBT OF THE SECRETAEY. 69 

which were a Tasmanian zeljra wolf with 3 young, a Tasmaniaii devil, 3 echidnas, 13 
kangaroos of various species, 3 phalangers, 2 flying phalangera, 4 native cats {Dasy- 
urus), a black-backed jackal, a pair of emus, 30 cockatoos and jjaroquets, a wedge- 
tailed eagle, a pair of black swans, and many other birds. A number of these 
animals were gifts from Doctor Goding, or through him, from persons in Australia 
who are irterested in natural history; others which were especially difficult to obtain 
were purchased by Doctor Goding at small cost through correspondents in remote 
parts of Australia and Tasmania. His wide acquaintance throughout the Australian 
region and knowledge of its fauna made it possible for Doctor Goding to secure a 
thoroughly representative collection, and acknowledgment is here given of the grat- 
itude of the park and of its obligation to Doctor Goding for his valuable assistance. 
Some of the animals mentioned are shown in Plate II. 

E. H. Plumacher, United States consul at IMaracaibo, Venezuela, presented a 
monke}', a deer, a peccary, 2 agoutis, and several iguanas, parrots, and owls. 

E. S. Cunningham, United States consul at Aden, Ara))ia, presented a line speci- 
men of caracal. 

An officer of the Sudan government offered to the President of the United States a 
young lion, which was secured for the park. Dr. H. T. McLaughlin, of the Ameri- 
can mission at Omdurman, kindly attended to the forwarding of the animal, which 
proved to be a fine male about 12 months old. ' 

The President presented to the park a bay lynx and a black bear. 

Victor J. Evans, of Washington, D. C, presented a fine male Arabian baboon. 

Capt. John L. Young, of Young's Pier, Atlantic City, N. J., presented the aqua- 
rium with a number of interesting fishes and also assisted materially in securing other 
specimens. 

The Yellowstone National Park, through its acting superintendent, Maj. John 
Pitcher, U. S. Army, furnished a fine male grizzly bear, weighing 500 pounds. 
Exchanges were made during the year with the New York Zoological Park; Lincoln 
Park, Chicago; the Zoological Garden at Buffalo, N. Y., and various private indi- 
viduals, by means of which surplus animals were disposed of and desirable speci- 
mens obtained. Births increased somewhat in number over the previous year, and 
it is of interest to note that the beavers have again bred, this time producing three 
young. 

Purchases included a young female lion obtained for the park by the United States 
consul at Aden, Arabia, a specimen of the Oregon cougar, 2 fishers, a female moose 
as a mate for the male already in the collection, 4 Cuban flamingos, also a male 
llama and several birds which did not arrive until after the close of the fiscal year. 

The young brown bear obtained on the mainland of Alaska, opposite Kodiak 
Island, in May, 1901, made a very satisfactory growth and weighed, in June of this 
year, 450 pounds. Its weight when captured was 18 pounds. This bear is probably 
of the kind recently described as Ursus gijas. 

Losses of animals.- — The most important were 5 American bison, 3 of which died 
from gastro-enteritis, 1 from abscess of the stomach, and 1 from pya:>mia; 2 wood- 
land caribou, 2 prong-horn antelopes, also 15 monkeys, the loss of which must be 
charged mainly to lack of proper housing. 

Autopsies on a considerable proportion of the animals which died were made by 
the Bureau of Animal Industry of the United States Agriciultural Department, and 
facts of interest were learned as well as information secured which will be of service 
to the i^ark in the future. 

One draft horse and one saddle horse were condemned during the year as unfit 
for use and were sold at public auction. 

The urgent need of a house for small mammals was brought to the attention of 
Congress, and, while no separate appropriation was made for this purpose, it is hoped 
that from the slightly increased general appropriation for the year 1904 a sufficient 



70 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 



amount can be reserved to erect at least a part of the building. Plans for the house 
are already well under way. 

It would be of the greatest advantage to the park if innnediate provision could be 
made for its most vital needs. A central heating plant is one of the indispensable 
features of a permanent equipment and must be put in ultimately. The establish- 
ment of such a plant will result not only in direct and immediate economy thi'ough 
reducing the amount of fuel and the number of firemen required, l)ut it will also 
save the expense of providing each building erected with a separate heating plant, 
and will remove from all the public exhil)ition houses the dirt, smoke, and other 
inconveniences which necessarily attend the operation of a heating plant in the 
building. 

Need of a suitable public comfort house equipped for ladies and children and 
with provision for a restaurant has before been nientioned and is again urged. Tlie 
present insufficient arrangements are becoming each year more unsatisfactory and 
objectionable. It may be mentioned that accommodations of this kind are among 
the most important features in all of the leading zoological gardens. 

Attention is again called to the great desirability of providing permanent build- 
ings for animals sufficient to keep pace with the growth of the collections, so that 
there may be no further necessity for putting up ilieap temporary structures, which 
are never satisfactory and entail a greater final cost than would result were perma- 
nent houses provided at tlie outset.

Appendix V. 

REPORT OF THE WORK OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY FOR 
THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 80, 1903. 

Sir: The kinds and amounts of the Observatory property are approximate!}- as 
follows: 

Buildings $6, 300 

Apparatus 36, 900 

Library and records 6, 460 

Total 49, 660 

During the past year the acquisitions of property of the kind just enumerated have 
been as follows: 

(a) ApjMrtdus. — Astronomical and physical apparatus has been purchased at an 
expenditure of |3,600, the chief pieces so procured being in connection with the 
installation of a long-focus horizontal reflecting telescope of 20 inches aperature and 
140 feet focus. 

(b) Librnni cnid records. — The usual periodicals have been continued and additional 
ooks of reference have been purchased, while 184 volumes of periodicals and books 

of reference have been bound. There has been expended for these several purposes 
$460, of which sum $254.50 was chargeable to the appropriation for the fiscal year 
ending June 30, 1902. 

No repairs of buildings worthy of note have been made during the year, but the 
Observatory inclosure was enlarged for the better accommodation of the great hori- 
zontal telescope by removing 39 feet at the western end of the south fence to a posi- 
tion 20 feet to the south. 

No noteworthy losses of property have occurred. 

The Work of the Observatory. 

For convenience the work of the Observator}- will be considered under three heads, 
as follows: 

1. Publications and miscellaneous matters. 

2. The new horizontal telescope and other apparatus. 

3. Investigations relating to the atmospheric absorption and to the solar constant 
of radiation. 

1. PuhUcations and ndsceUaneous matters. 

Edips^e report. — A report of the expedition to Wadesboro, N. C, to observe the 

total solar eclipse of 1900 has been greatly delayed, but is now complete and in the 

hands of the printer, and it is expected will be distributed in the coming fiscal year. 

It will contain numerous plates illustrative of the work of the expedition and espe- 

• cially of the photography of the inner coronal region with the 135-foot focus lens, by 

Mr. Smillie. 

Miscellaneous work. — The Observatory staff has continued, as heretofore, to furnish

EEPOET OF THE SECEETARY. 77 

occasional assistance in matters of a physical or astronomical nature connected with 
the Institution. Among experimental undertakings of this kind may be mentioned 
the rough measurement of the absorption of certain substances for infra-red radia- 
tions, made at the request of some correspondents of the Institution. 

Personnel. — No changes have been made in the permanent staff of the Observatory. 
Doctor Gilbert completed his temporary services on August 15, 1902, and Dr. J. R. 
Benton tilled a temporary ajipointment from September 16, 1902, to November 30, 
1902. 

2. The new horizontal telescope and other apimratns. 

Referring to my report of last year, it will be recalled that preliminary attempts 
had been made to measure the absorption of the gases of the solar envelope by holo- 
graphic study of an enlarged solar image, and that it -was your intention to continue 
the work so as to include the holographic study of sunspot spectra, but that these 
researches were temporarily laid aside till a more suitable arrangement for forming 
and guiding the solar image could be obtained. Much study and experiment 
has been devoted to this matter in the past year, and as a result a horizontal reflect- 
ing telescope of 20 inches aperture and 140 feet focus has been obtained,- and pro- 
vided with a tube in which the air can be thoroughly stirred to overcome "boiling," 
in accordance with the experiments reported last year. To "feed" this horizontal 
telescope a inodification of the coelostat has been devised which is believed to be 
before untried, and which renders this simple instrument so well adapted for 
the purpose of solar research that it is hoped that the device will approve itself 
elsewhere. 

A large instrument of this type has been constructed by the J. A. Brashear Com- 
pany, of Allegheny, Pa., and will form a part of the Astrophysical 01:)servatory 
exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904. All the above 
apparatus, including the coelostat, long-focus mirror, tube and air-stirring devices, 
and three great piers for the coelostat, "concave mirror, and bolometric apparatus for 
the study of the image, are now in use. The accompanying illustration, PI. IV, 
shows the great coelostat and a portion of the tube which incloses the beam from 
the coelostat to the concave mirror, 55 feet north, and thence south and under the 
coelostat to the plane of the focal image. It will be noted by the reader that the 
beam is reflected in the plane of the meridian from the first plane mirror mounted 
on a polar axis which turns half as fast as the earth, and that a second reflection 
occurs at the surface of a second plane mirror, adjustable about two horizontal axes, 
and also cai)able of moving bodily, by means of tracks, east and west and north and 
south. Thus the second mirror can receive the beam at any hour of any day of the 
year, and reflect it in any desired direction. In practice a nearly horizontal and 
northerly direction is chosen. 

PI. Ill is from the working drawing of the tube, which is an acute V in general 
shape, with a longer branch of circular cross section extending from the concave 
mirror on the northern pier to the focus, 140 feet distant on the southern, and with 
a shorter branch uniting with the longer at its northern end, but proceeding south- 
ward and inclined upward at an angle of 6° and ending at the coelostat, 55 feet dis- 
tant. This shorter branch is circular at its northern end, but broadens out to an 
elliptical cross section, as shown, in order to inclose the beam for the east and west 
positions of the second coelostat mirror. Both branches of the tube are of galvanized 
iron, with two walls separated by an air sjiace \\ inches thick all around. The inner 
tube is blackened and is provided with diaphragms. 

In Plate III is also shown the air ducts which are employed for stirring in the great 
tube. Starting from the blowing engine, which is a 29-inch circular fan blower, with 
direct-connected 22-horsepower electric motor, making 700 revolutions per minute, 
the blast is carried by a 20-inch main to a point near the middle of the tube, where 



78 EEPORt OF THE SECRETARY. 

the air duct branches into two 14-inch tubes, which proceed north and south respec- 
tively and communicate by 5-inch pipes to the interior of telescope tube. At points 
intermediate with these other 5-inch pipes lead out of the telescope tuVje and thence 
by return mains to the suction end of the blower, and thus the same air is continually 
being churned aljout through the entire system. 

To prevent the blowing engine and the city traffic from communicating prejudicial 
tremors to the apparatus, three deep and massive piers have been constructed, sup- 
orting respectively the (;oelostat, the long-focus concave mirr or, and the spectro- 
bolometrii- aj)paratuH used to investigate the solar image. Each pier is contained in 
a pit originally 12 feet s(iuare and 10 feet deep, but supported by retaining walls of 
grouting 1 foot thick, so as finally to leave a cubical-shaped pit 10 feet on a side. At 
the bottom is a layer of sand 2 feet deep, and on this a base of grouting 2 feet thick 
and 9 feet square, supporting the brick pier, which is built to the surface of the 
ground 7 feet scjuare, with 18-inch walls on the four sides and a 13-inch wall north 
and south through the center. Over all is the capstone, 8 feet north and south, 7 
feet east and west, and 7 inches thick. In the case of the coelostat pier a two-walled 
brick superstructure is carried up to the top of the horizontal tube to support the 
base plate of the coelostat. In spite of all these precautions I regret to report that 
the disturl)ance from passing traffic and even distant railroad trains has not been suf- 
ficiently eliuiinated, and recjuires further measures to be taken to overcome the 
almost unconquerable difficulties of the site. 

Owing to prolonged cloudy weather, the apparatus had not been fully tried between 
the time of its installation, about June 1, and the close of the period covered by this 
repoi-t, l)ut, so far as preliminary experiments have shown, the whole promises to be 
a valuable equipment if the tremors due to the site can be corrected. 

The sensitive galranonieier.--'Reierrm<i to portions of my reports of preceding years 
describing the construction and installation of a highly sensitive galvanometer, I 
regret that attention has been diverted this year to other matters so completely that 
comparatively little work has been done with it. In the fall of last year an appa- 
ratus was arranged to measure the heating effect of the Ijrighter stars by its aid, but 
unfortunately communication with the mercurial air pump had so quickly blackened 
the silvered galvanometer mirrors that this, together with their almost microscopic 
size, made it impossible to read the galvanometer by artificial light. After several 
trials numerous mirrors were platinized by electrical discharge in vacuo and the gal- 
vanometer was provided with nurrors of this kind, but immediately after the experi- 
ments were discontinued to take up work on the provision of the great horizontal 
telescope. It is hoped to provide for the use of this special galvanometer in spectrum 
work on the solar image, especially in connection with sun spots, and perhaps upon 
the heat of the stars. 

3. Invesligations relating to the solar constant of radiMion. 

Referring to my last year's report, the holographic measurements of atmospheric 
absorption then described have been continued chiefly in the hands of the junior 
assistant, Mr. Fowle, with improved arrangements and with more complete and 
exact results. In connection with them the absorption of the radiation in all parts 
of the apparatus has been determined frequently, and measures of the total solar 
radiation by the actinometer or i)yrhe]iometer have been made also. From these 
several kinds of data the solar constaiit of radiation, or rate of receipt of solar energy 
at the outer limit of our atmosphere, has been computeil for a numl)er of the best 
days. 

Imjyrovement of bolograpJts. — Before giving these values, I invite attention to Plate 
V, which shows three superposed energy curves of the jOTsmatic solar spectrum. 
Such holographic curves are now obtained covering the region of spectrum from 




d 3 



o -3 



REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 79 

wave length 0.375yu to wave length 2.5/^ in about twenty-five minutes of time. This 
region extends from beyond the line "L," or farther than the eye can see without 
siaecial means in the ultra violet, through the whole visible spectrum, and on through 
the visible but very intense upper infra-red spectrum as far as glass is transparent. 
It includes about j^^'^% of the solar radiation which reaches the earth's surface, and 
so far as experiment has shown, within 1 and 2 per cent of all that reaches the outer 
layers of the earth's atmosphere lies within this spectral region. 

It is only since January, 1903, that the apparatus has been so far perfected as to 
include in the regular ])olographic work the important portion lying between 0.375// 
and 0A7u, and in Plate V readers may see for the first time, as the bolometer recog- 
nizes them, the general features of the violet solar spectrum so familiar in photo- 
graphic spectra. It is, of course, impossible to show the finer details when the bolom- 
eter passes through the whole visible and upper infra-red spectrum in less time 
than was occupied in passing from through a fourth of the upper infra-red alone in 
preparing the detailed map published in 1900; but nevertheless in a rough compar- 
ison of three curves it was seen that as many as 325 of the Fraunhofer lines were 
discriminated by the bolometer as it passed over them thus rapidly. As remarked 
last year, scarcely any "drift" of the galvanometer is now experienced, and, indeed, 
it is sometimes possible to take holographs for a month without readjusting the 
bolometric circuit in any way. This excellent behavior is principally due to the 
improved rheostat and to the 16-coil type of galvanometer, both of which were men- 
tioned on page 87 of last year's rejjort. 

Transmission of the atmosphere. — From series of such holographs as are described at 
page 89 in my last year's report, coefficients of transmission of the atmosphere are 
obtained. It is now customary to compute them for more than 30 points in the 
spectrum between wave lengths 0.37 m and 2.5 //, of which 24 are at wave lengths 
where there are no prominent atmospheric bands and the others within such bands. 
The reduced observations take such a form that they may be graphically platted as 
straight lines whose angle of inclination is a measure of the transmission coetficient 
of the air at the given wave length. It is the exactness with which the reduced 
observations from the holograph fall upon such straight lines which furnishes the 
principal criterion of their value. To show how close this agreement is on the best 
days, I invite attention to Plate VI, which gives for several wave lengths the reduc- 
tions of the observations of March 25 and 26, 1903, respectively. Ordinates are 
logarithms of heights of the holographic curves at the selected wave lengths and 
abscissfe are air masses. 

The circles represent observations of March 25 and crosses those of March 26. 
Lines I and II are for a wave length of 1.027 //; III and IV at 0.656 /<; V and VI at 
0.468 jii, and VII and VIII at 0.395 u. On nearly all days of observation it is found 
that the forenoons yield a less regular series than the afternoons, and it appears as if 
the air became clearer and clearer till a little after noon and then remained substan • 
tially unchanged on the best days till 4 or 5 o'clock p. m. It is therefore the practice 
here to use only afternoon observations in determining atmospheric transmission. 
The forenoon observations are distinguished in Plate VI by being connected by dotted 
lines. 

Notable decrease in tJie transparency of the air in the present calendar year. — From 
numerous determinations of the transmission of the air for solar radiations, a 
striking diminution of the transmission has been noted in the best days of this year 
as compared with last year. To illustrate this difference 1 give the following table:

It is to be regretted that the earlier work did not reach up so far in the violet as 
we now observe, but the trend of the observations makes it appear that the trans- 
parency of the air for the extreme visible violet rays may be 30 per cent less than 
last year, and that the transparency for the visible and infra-red spectrum as a whole 
has diminished by 10 per cent. If this change is widespread it should be likely to 
influence climate, and that it is widespread the falling off of actinometric observa- 
tions both in this country and Europe, as reported by several observers, would seem 
to indicate. 

Selective atmospheric absorption. — Referring to fig. 3, page 89, of my last year's report, 
the depression at a wave length of 0.58// in the curve there shown would a])pear less 
marked in the more recent results, owing to the great decrease in transparency for 
the blue and violet rays; but nearlj- all recent work gives evidence of bands of dimin- 
ished attiiospheric transmission at wave lengths 0.43/i, 0.48/^ and 0.58//. 

Interesting results have been obtained in respect to the atmospheric transmission 
within the great bands of water vapor and oxygen, and it has been found, in con- 
firmation of the accuracy of the observations, and especially of the exponential 
formula employed in reducing them, that the values of transmission coefficients 
within the water-vapor bands of the infra-red are such as would very nearly obliter- 
ate these bands from an energy-sisectrum curve corrected to represent the distril)ution 
of solar radiation in the spectrum outside the earth's atmosphere.

Distribution of Radiation in the Normal Solar Spectrum Outside the Earth's Atmosphere. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 81 

nometer of M. Crova's well-kuovvii design, and constructed under M. Crova's personal 
direction, was received at the OVjservatory. Tliis is a secondary type of instrument, 
requiring standardization by comparison with some other radiation-measuring instru- 
ment whose constants can be determined. Such an assumed standard was con- 
structed here l)y inclosing the cylindrical bull) of a mercury thermometer in a flat 
round box of very thin copper filled with mercury, nickeled on the back and sides, 
blackened with platinum deposit in front, and situated in the center of a much larger 
hollow, thick-walled wooden sphere coated with bright tin foil within, and provided 
with a measured aperture opposite the front of the copper box, to which the solar 
beam was led through adiaphragmed blackened tube. Such an instrument is essen- 
tially the pyrheliometer of Pouillet, as advantageously modified by Tyndall by the 
employment of mercury instead of water, but is rendered still more quick in its action 
by the use of coj^per instead of the iron employed by Tyndall, and partakes somewhat 
of the character of a perfect absorber or "black body," because inclosed in the tin- 
foil coated hollow sphere. The water equivalent of the instrument was determined 
by repeated calorimetric measurements. In use it has apparently worked perfectly, 
responding so quickly to the heating of the solar rays that the rise of temperature in 
the first 20 seconds after exposure is within two or three hundredths of a degree as 
great as in the following 20-second intervals. 

Nevertheless there is a doubt as to the accuracy of this and, as I think, of all 
instruments thus far used to measure the total solar radiation, from the fact that they 
one and all receive the beam upon a front surface, which must necessarily get warmer 
than the rear portion of the instrument, where the rise of temperature is observed, 
and hence must lose a portion of the heat by a greater convection and radiation than 
that which takes place after insolation has ceased. Thus a portion of the heat always 
escapes measurement, and there is no ready way of knowing what its amount is. It 
has been sought to devise here some type of standard pyrheliometer to which this 
objection does not apply, and it is believed that such an instrument has been found, 
although its construction is not yet comjilete. In principle it depends on receiving 
the radiations within a hollow chamber or "black body" and carrying away the 
heat by a continuous current of liquid, and the instrument, if successful, can be 
employed as a continuous self-recording pyrheliometer. 

INIeanwhile repeated comparisons have made it sure that both the Crova actinom- 
eterand the mercury pyrheliometer give readings j^roportional to the .solar radiation, 
though there still remains some doubt as to the absolute magnitudes. Accordingly 
one or both of these instruments have been read on days when the transmission of 
the air has been determined, and these two kinds of data have been employed to 
compute the solar constant of radiation or rate of receipt of solar radiation outside 
the earth's atmosphere. 

THE SOLAR CONSTANT. 

This important quantity has been studied by the method you have devised and 
described in the report of the Mount Whitney Expedition, and in a recent article in 
the Astrophysical Journal for March, 1903. As employed here the method consists 
in producing holographs of the solar spectrumj correcting the form of these for instru-' 
mental absorption, and again for atmospheric absorption, and then multiplying the 
rate of receipt of solar radiation at the earth's surface, as measured by the actinome- 
ter, by the ratio of the areas included under the holographic curves, corrected for 
atmospheric absorption and uncorrected, respectively. 

The work here has been more in the way of developing the inetliod of study and 
obtaining experience in its use than in the expectation of measuring with certainty 
the solar constant itself, for (as you have elsewhere observed), whereas it is in other 
kinds of observation almost a (;ertainty that the mean of a series of observations is 
more trustworthy than any single one, here a single observation made without inter- 

SM 1903 6 



82 REPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

vening absorption wouM outweigh any number requiring correction for atmospheric 
absorption, and the vahies observed tlirough smallest air masses are the most trust- 
worthy. It follows that values obtained at a low altitude like that of Washington are 
necessarily too small, owing to the difficulty of allowing with accuracy for the absorp- 
tion of the great thickness of air above the observer. 

There has been incorporated in the act appropriating for the support of the Astro- 
physical Observatory during the fiscal year ending June 80, 1904, a provision for 
high-altitude observations. In anticipation it may be said that apparatus for that 
purpose has been ordered. 

Although, therefore, uncertainty attaches to the actual values determined here 
and to be given below, still it is probable that they are relatively comparable among 
themselves when we consider the apparent accuracy both of the observations and 
the exponential formula used in reducing them, as illustrated in Plate VI, and the 
fact that the apj^lication of coefficients of atuiospheric tiansmission determined simi- 
larly would practically obliterate the great selective absorption bands in comj)uting 
the form of the solar energy curve outside the atmosphere. 

REDrCEI) OBSERV.ATION'S OF TOE SOLAR R.VDIATIOX CONSTANT. 

In the following table will l)e found such computations of the solar constant as 
were made up to July 1, 1!K):>. The holographs on which they depend extend for 
the most part from 0.375 /< to 2.5 /<, and thus include practically all the solar radia- 
tion whi(;h reaches the earth's surface." 

A correction of about 1 per cent has been added, representing the best estimate 
which could be made of the- excess of energy beyond these limits outside the earth's 
atmosphere. All the results depend on the constant of the pyrheliometer, and may 
therefore be subject to multiplication by a constant factor to be subsequently deter- 
mined. Comparing the values obtained with those which you have given in the 
Mount Whitney report of 3 calories, it will be seen that they are about 25 per cent 
smaller, and that the difference does not appear to depend on the transmission 
coefficients, but rather seems chiefly due to a difference in actinometry. 

Thus you have stated the usual actinometer reading at Allegheny, Pa., for clear 
blue sky at 1.7 calories,'^ while the very highest value obtained here is 1.44 calories. 
Much lower values are reported from recent observations of Mr. Kiml)all, of the 
United States Weather Bureau, at Asheviile, N. C, and at Washington, so that on 
the whole the question of absolute actinometry seems a very open one. 

Turning next to the relative values of the solar constant, it is seen that there is 
generally good agreement of the results prior to March 26, 1903, and that since that 
date there has been a decrease of about 10 per cent in the computed constant. No 
reason for this is known, as some of the best observations were before and others 
since March 25, those of Pebruary 19, March 25, March 26, and April 29 being con- 
sidered to have most weight. February 25 was a most extraordinary day as regards 
aKsence of water vapor absorption. Never since holographs have l)een taken here 
have the great infra-red water- vapor bands <p W £1 been observed so feeble as on 
February 19. 

«The observations of October, 1902, which reached only to 0.48«, have been cor- 
rected l)y means of later work and are therefore of less weight.

THE FOR.\I OF THE SOLAR-ENERGY CURVE OUTSIDE THE ATiMOSPHERE AND THE INFERRED 

TE.MPERATURE OF THE SUN. 

Plate VII includes a number of curves which represent on the normal wave-length 
scale the distribution of energy in the solar spectrum outside the earth's atmosphere. 
They are computed from prismatic energy curves by aid of the coefficients of instru- 
mental and atmospheric ab.sorption and the known dispersion of the prism. It will 
be seen that these recent studies indicate the position of the maximum ordinate at a 
wave length of about 0.49 /<, or between green and blue of the spectrum, and that 
there is a fairly close agreement between the different days' work. The principal 
differences occur in the blue and violet spectrum, and are to some extent caused by 
the rapid deterioration of the reflecting power of the silvered surfaces in this region, 
which renders very frequent measurements of instrumental absorption necessary, and 
even then hardly sufficient. 

Paschen and gthers have established an empirical equation connecting the absolute 
temperature T with the wave length of maximum energy A„„,^, which is as follows: 

'^max r= CONSTANT. 

The constant in this equation has been determined by Paschen, Lunnner, 
Pringsheim, and others, to be about 2,900 for an "absolutely black body," t)r jjer- 
fect radiator, and ranging as low as about 2,600 for bright platinum. Using the 
former value, we may say that it appears that the radiation of the solar beam outside 
the earth's atmosphere has its maximum energy at the same wave length as a perfect 
radiator of the assumed temperature of 5,920° absolute. 

SUMMARY. 

The operations of the year have consisted chiefly: First, in the provision and suc- 
cessful installation of a horizontal reflecting telescope of 20 inches aperture and 140 



84 EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

feet focus, fed by a new form of two-mirror coelostat, and employed with a provision 
for "churning" tiie air on the jjath of the beam. This instrumental equipment is to 
be used for holographic study of the solar image, and especially sun-spot energy 
spectra and the absorption of the solar envelope. Second, in the continuation, with 
improved holographic; apparatus, of studies of the solar-energy spectrum and the 
absorption of radiation in the atmosphere. 

As the most notable result of the studies of atmospheric a))sori)tion, it ai)i)ears tliat 
the average transmission of the air of Washington for all wave lengths for the best 
days of 1902-3 has been as much as 10 per cent less than for the best days of 1901-2, 
while the decrease of transparency in the violet is very much greater. There is no 
evidence that this remarkable decrease is due to water vapor. Indeed, it has been 
well observed on the very driest days. 

Inquiries have been made of the Observatory as to whether the blight of the wheat 
and barley crops could be attributed to any decrease in the ultraviolet radiation of 
the sun, but the Observatory was able only to state the fact that such a decrease had 
been observed. 

It is probable that something like this affected the actinometric observations 
recorded V>y Crova in the years following the great eruption of Krakatoa, though 
whether the smaller one of Mont Pelee can be associated with it is uncertain. There 
is no evidence yet obtainable of how general this absorption is at diSerent parts of 
the globe, but it is, perhaijs, the most notable single result of our- past year's experi- 
ments, and is eminently in the line of the work you have anticipated for the Astro- 
physical Observatory, in furnishing data of importance to the national interests in 
agriculture, and in estimating the influences which may affect j)ast and coming 
harvests.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN. 

Sir: 1 have the honor to present the report on the operations of the library of the 
Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1903. 

In the following table is shown the number of volumes, parts of volumes, i^am- 
phlets, and charts recorded in the accession books of the Smithsonian deposit. Library

The accession numbers run from 445524 to 452465. 

A small number of these publications are assigned temporarily to the library here 
for the use of the staff of the Institution and Museum, the greater quantity l)eing 
sent direct to the Lil)rary of Congress. 

These sendings recjuired about 200 boxes and 20 bags and packages, and are esti- 
mated to have amounted to the equivalent of 9,200 octavo volumes. The publi- 
cations sent in this way are independent of those transmitted by the Bureau of 
International Exchanges, and do not include public documents ijresented to the 
Smithsonian Institution, which are sent to the Library of Congress without stamping, 
credit there being given to the country sending. 

For several years prior to the removal of the Library of Congress to its new build- 
ing a large number of the scientific series bearing upon the work of the Institution 
were retained, owing to the crowded condition of the Library of Congress in its old 
quarters at the Capitol. During the past year it has been found possible to get these 
out, have them taken off the Museum record, and checked on the accession book 
and sent to the Library of Congress. These sets, series, and volumes were forwarded 
in 167 boxes, estimated to contain about 6,680 octavo volumes, making a total sending 
to the Library of Congress for the year of about 15,880 volumes. 

The lil)raries of the Secretary, Office, and Astrophysical Observatory have received 
during the year 409 volumes, pamphlets, and charts and 1,625 parts of volumes, 
making a total of 2,034, and a grand total, including books for the Smithsonian 
deposit, of 29,347. The serial publications entered on the card catalogue number 
24,630.

86 EEPORT OF THE SECRET AEY. 

The universities at the following places have sent inaugui'al dissertations and aca- 
demic publications: 

Baltimore (Johns Hop- Ithaca (Cornell). St. Petersburg. 

kins). Jena. Strasburg. 

Basel. Kazan. Toronto. 

Berlin. Konigsberg. Toulouse. 

Breslau. Leipzig. Utrecht. 

Erlangen. ]\Iarburg. Vienna. 

Freiburg. Oxford. Wasliington, D. C. (Cath- 

Halle a Saal. Philadelphia (University of olic University). 

Heidelberg. Pennsylvania). Zurich. 

Helsingfors. Rostock. 

Owing to the large number of series and parts of sets culled from tlie Museum 
library and sent to the Library of Congress for the Smithsonian deposit during the 
year the Office has been occupied with the checking off and making memoranda for 
the completing of these sets. While this has taken a great deal of time, the policy 
carrieu.1 on from year to year of increasing the library by exchange has been con- 
tinued, and though, for the above reason, there is quite a decrease in the number of 
letters written for new exchanges and for completing series already in the library, 
the total reached 714. Two hundred and sixty-five periodicals were added to the 
receipts and 239 defective series v^'ere either completed or partly completed, depend- 
ing upon the pubHsher's ability to supply the numbers needed. Where certain 
numbers of periodicals are reported as missing, a request that they be supplied is 
made on a postal card and corresponding cards are sent in acknowledgment of 
receipts. During the year 654 numbers were asked for and 424 supplied. 

The books in the reference rooni containing the proceedings and transactions of 
the learned societies have been taken from the shelves and rearranged in more sys- 
tematic order. These books have been consulted by meml^ers of tlie staff of the 
Institution as well as by others. In the reading room the additional shelving has 
allowed a better arrangement of the bound volumes of periodicals. Two thousand 
seven hundred and forty-seven periodicals were taken out for consultation. No 
additional ]iV)raries have been added to the list and those maintained in the Institu- 
tion are the Secretary's library. Office library, and the Employee's library. The 
sectional libraries remain as before, i. e., ^rodromics, International Exchange, and 
Law Reference. 

The sectional library of the Astropliysical Observatory was given a thorough over- 
hauling and many volumes belonging to the Smithsonian deposit not being needed 
for use there were sent to the Library of Congress. As special help was provided, 
many of the missing parts of publications were noted and ordered, and at the close 
of the yeai' most of these had been received. The number of volumes bound 
was 184. 

The section of the lil)rary devoted to books of a popular nature for the use of tlie 
employees has been used more than ever. The success of tlie sending of a number 
of books to the Zoological Park once a month has more than repaid the trouble taken, 
and 575 books were sent out in the course of the year. There are now 1,413 volumes 
on the shelves of the library and 2,946 books were borrowed during the year; 100 
magazines were bound and 43 new books added to the collection. 

In the reading room, cataloguing room, and entry to the employees' library open 
shelving has been put up, in addition to that winch was already in these places, 
giving room for expanding and for a better arrangement of the collections of books. 

Gen. John Watts de Peyster has continued to add to his already large collection of 
books and pamphlets relating to Napoleon Bonaparte, and through his munificence 
many rare volumes have come to enrich the library of the Smithsonian Institution. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 87 

Besides these books, a collection of works on gypsies, a collection of dictionaries and 
encyclopedias, together with several portraits, pictures, and paintings are included 
in his gifts. IMany of the dictionaries and encyclopedias are very rare and can not 
now be duplicated. 

At the close of last year, the extension of the Parthenon frieze in the art room was 
under consideration, and during August and September very good casts of this frieze 
of about the right height were obtained and jilaced upon the walls. 

The collection of books on art and kindred subjects now in the art room has 
received a valuable addition from Dr. E. A. Schwarz, who presented a number of art 
publications. It is hoped that in the near future time will be found for the card 
cataloguing of this collection, as well as many other works which are already there. 

As Congress failed to approj^riate money for the representation of the United States 
on the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the Smithsonian Institution 
again carried on the work, though with a sum quite insufficient for the needs and 
the necessary help. A larger amount has been allotted for the coming year, which 
will enable the Institution to do the work more thoroughly, and will also make it 
possible to fill in the gaps left in the reference to the literature of 1901. The follow- 
ing references were furnished to the central bureau: 

Literature of 1901 6, 150 

Literature of 1902 8, 330 

Total 14, 480 

The subscription account of the catalogue witliiu the United States is as follows: 

Total number of subscriptions to complete sets 62 

Total number of subscriptions to partial sets 37 

Total 99 

The following volumes of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature of 
1901 have been received and distributed: Botany, Part I; Chemistry, Part I; 
Mechanics; Physics, Parti; Meteorology; Physiology, Part I; Mathematics; Astron- 
omy; Bacteriology; Physics, Part II; Mineralogy; Geology; Geography; and List of 
Journals. 

The subscription price for these volumes represent a total of $3,926.82. Out of 
this sum $2,556.52 had been received i.p to June 30, 1903. 

The United States National Museum library has been increased during tlie past 
year by two important gifts — the E. A. Scliwarz collection of books, relating to Amer- 
ican Coleoptera, and the W. H. Dall collection of books, bearing on recent and fossil 
moUusks. The Schwarz Library is one that was built up by Doctor Schwarz and 
G. G. Hubbard while carrying on their studies, and is intended to form an accessory 
to their collection of insects which was presented to the Museum some years ago. 

Doctor Dall, as a collaborator in the Mu.seum, has brought together, in connection 
with his studies on the collection of mollusks in the United States National Museum, 
a collection of V)Ooks which comprises about 1,600 bound volumes and about 2,000 
pamphlets. In connection witti this library Doctor Dall also ]> resents a card cata- 
logue covering the literature of Conchology, recent and fossil, up to about 1860. He 
purchased from the executors of Mons. (>. P. Deshayes, paleontologist, the original 
cards, numbering about 190,000. Doctor Dall obtained this catalogue some twenty- 
five years ago, and during the time it was in his possession he added materially to the 
number of cards relating to the genera of mollusks, though the series relating to 
species remains much as INIonsieur Deshayes left it. 

During the latter part of last summer the United States National Museum Library 
was closed to the public for the purpose of rearranging the books and sorting many 
into their proper place and series. This had been impossible during the last few

years, owing to tne crowded condition; but within tlie past year the additional gal- 
leries i^rovided have been turned over, thus giving the space needed for this pur- 
pose. All the shelves have been gone over, the books taken down and placed in 
the classification, making them more accessible, and a large number belonging to 
the Smithsonian deposit were separated from the Museum books and sent over 
to the Smithsonian Institution for checking preparatory to their being transmitted 
to the Library of Congress. 

Three special collections of books in the library have been provided with book- 
plates — i. e., the Goode Library, the Schwarz Library, and the Ball Library. 

The ]\Iuseuni library now contains 19,161 bound volumes and 32,063 unbound 
pai)ers. The additions during the year consisted of 3,161 books, 3,260 pamphlets, 
and 303 parts of volumes. There were catalogued 916 books, of which 76 belonged 
to the Smithsonian deposit; 1,571 pamphlets, of which 18 belonged to the Smith- 
sonian deposit, and 9,838 pacts of periodicals, (if which 2,274 belonged to the 
Smithsonian deposit. 

Three thousand three liundred and sixteen cards were added to the Authors' 
Catalogue. These numbers do not include 4,614 cards for books and pamphlets 
recatalogued, and also do not include any of the books in the Ball library, but do 
include a number of those in the Schwarz library. 

The number of books, pamphlets, and periodicals borrowed from the general 
library amounted to 23,583, including 4,833 withdrawn for assignment to the 
sectional libraries.

GENERAL APPENDIX 



SMITHSONIAN RElMjRT FOR 1903. 



99 



ADVERTISEMENT. 



The object of the General Appendix to the Annual Report of ttitj 
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov- 
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab- 
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on 
special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond- 
ents of the Institution. 

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report 
required of them by law with memoirs- illustrating the more remark- 
able and important developments in physical and biological discovery, 
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti- 
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history, 
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would 
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress. 

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an 
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been 
issued b}^ well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com- 
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom- 
inent features of recent scientific progress in astrononi}-, geology, 
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and 
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether 
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888. 

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of 
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original) 
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus- 
sion. This method has been contiiuicd in the present report for 19(>3.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. « 



By N. S. Shaler, 
Professor, Harvard University. 



Althoug-h the moon has been the most .studied of all celestial -objects, 
few persons except astronomers have a clear idea of even the general 
results which have been derived from the vast body of observations 
that have been made upon it. For this reason it appears desirable to 
preface the account of the special inquiries which are set forth in the 
following pages by a statement of what is known concerning- this near- 
est neighbor of our earth. This account will necessarily be limited to 
the facts which can be set forth in other than mathematical form; 
fortunately these include all that the reader needs to have in mind in 
order to obtain a fairly clear understanding of the questions which are 
to be discussed. 

The history of primitive astronomy shows that the moon, of all 
celestial objects, from the beginning of man's intellectual development 
has been the most closely ol)served. Although the sun was doubtless 
recognized by the lowliest man as the most important feature of the 
heaveas, as the giver of life, the conditions under which it is seen, 
especially its blinding light, long made any extended study of it 
impossible. So, except for the very evident changes of its course 
across the sky and the consequent succession of the seasons, little was 
known of the solar center two hundred years ago, and, save its approx- 
imate distance from the earth, its mass, and its general relations to the 
planets, not much knowledge of it was gained until the last century. 
On the other hand, the moon, ))ecause of its nearness, being only about 
one four-hundredth part as remote from the earth as the sun, has in a 
noteworthy way entered into the records of men. Its relatively short 
period of change and the very pronounced character of its alterations 
made it the tirst index of time beyond the round of the day. It is 
evident, indeed, that as soon as men l)eg-an to reckon time they used 
the lunar month to make their talh , rather than that of the solar year.

104 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. 

Moreover, the surface of the moon reveals much to the naked eye, 
not clearl}^, })ut sufficiently well to afford the basis for speculation and 
to tempt the imaoination to create there a world like our own. It is 
therefore not surprising that a host of myths concerning the nature 
of our satellite grew up in the days before the telescope. It is inter- 
esting to note the fact that many of these myths have not only become 
fixed in the minds of uninstructed people, but they have had a remark- 
able influence upon modern astronomers, limiting their capacity to 
interpret what their instruments clearh' reveal to them. At every 
stage in the advance of selenography we note the curious persistency 
of the endeavor not only to interpret the lunar features by the terres- 
trial, but to warp the observed facts into accord, with those seen on 
the earth. There is perhaps no better instance of the extent to which 
prepossessions and prejudices may affect the judgment of the most 
conscientious observer, blinding him to evident truth, than the history 
of lunar inquiries affords. 

The story of the physical conditions of the moon had best be begun 
by noting that the relation of our satellite to a larger sphere is not 
exceptional, but the most characteristic of all the relations of one stel- 
lar body to another. Of the planets in the solar system, all save the 
two nearest to the sun. Mercury and Venus, have one or more smaller 
spheres circling about them. The relation of the sun to the several 
planets in a larger way repeats this plan of grouping lesser about 
greater orbs. 

It is generally believed by astronomers that the celestial spheres 
have been formed by a process of condensation, due to gravitation, of 
matter which was originally widely diffused; that our solar system, 
before it was organized into the sun tuid lesser bodies, was in the form 
of a diffused nebulous mass of spheroidal form which extended beyond 
the orbit of the outermost planet. As this matter gathered toward 
the center, the material now in each of the planets and its satellites 
parted from the parent body, probably at first in the form of a nebu- 
lous ring, or spiral, which in time broke and gathered into a spheroidal 
mass. In that detached portion of the parent nebula the process of 
concentration was repeated, with the result that satellites, or, as we 
may term them, secondary planets, were formed substantially as the 
greater spheres were set off from the sun. There are many questions 
and doubts concerning the details of this nebular theory, but that the 
evolution of our solar system, and probably of all stellar systems, took 
place in substantialh' the manner indicated appears to be eminently 
probable; it is, indeed, fairly well established by what we know of the 
distant nebulae and by the rings of Saturn, which apparently contain 
the material which normall}' should have formed one or more of its 
satellites, but which for some unknown reason have remained 
unbroken. 



GENERAL DESCRIPTIOK OF THE MOON. 105 

It is not certain at just what stagfe in the concentration of a nebula, a 
planet or a satellite ma}" be set off from the parent bod}"; nor can the 
present distance of the satellite from the main sphere be assumed as 
that at which the parting took place. It is possible that the concen- 
tration of the parent body had gone so far that the diffused or nebu- 
lous stage of its materials had been passed by and the more advanced 
stage of igneous fluidity entered on. It is, however, more likely that 
in all cases the separation occurred while the particles of matter were 
divided as they are in a gas or vapor. As soon as the two spheres are 
separated from one another, and so long as they remain in any meas- 
ure fluid, the difference in their gravitative attraction on the nearer 
and more remote part of their masses induces tides, and the effect of 
these tidal movements, as has been shown by Prof. George Darwin, is 
necessarily to impel the two bodies farther apart. It seems certain 
that before the earth and the moon became essentially rigid, as they 
now are, the effect of these tides in driving them apart must have been 
great enough to account for a considerable part of the interval which 
now separates them. 

In the present condition of the moon it is a sphere having a com- 
puted diameter of 2,159.0 miles and its mean distance from the earth 
238,818 miles. So far as has been determined the moon exhibits no 
trace of flattening at the poles, such as characterizes the earth, unless, 
as is possible, there are irregularities of flgure on the unseen part of 
the sphere. It is essentially globular in form. The fact that the moon 
is not flattened at its poles proba))ly indicates that if it once rotated 
in the manner of the planet it ceased to do so before it became solid. 

The measure of density of the moon — i. e., the proportion of its 
weight to its bulk — is only about six-tenths that of the earth. While 
the earth's mean density is nearly .5.7 times that of water, that of the 
moon is about 3.5 times as great. Thus the total gravitative force of 
the lunar mass is to be reckoned as only about one eighty-first of that 
of our planet. 

As the moon revolves on its polar axis but once in about a month, 
and at a rate that tends to keep the same part of its surface turned 
toward the earth, we should, but for the phenomenon of librations, 
see no more than one-half of its superficial area. Owing, however, to 
this feature, which is due to certain complications of the moon's 
exceedingly varied movements, the satellite in effect sways in relation 
to the earth so that at certain times we see farther to the east and at 
others farther to the west of its center, and in the succession of these 
movements we are able to behold somewhat more than one-half the 
total area — in fact, about six-tenths of it. It is impossible to set forth 
in this writing the reasons for the librations of the moon, as the mat- 
ter can not be explained without giving in mathematical form a full 



106 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. 

account of the motion of our satellite, which is one of the most com- 
plicated of astronomical problems." 

As noted below, there is some accessible information going- to show 
that even beyond the extreme field revealed by the librations the sur- 
face of the moon has the same character as that which is visible. 
Thus we find that up to the limits of the visible part there is no sign 
of change in the nature of the surface. It is therefore reasonable to 
conclude that the same characteristics extend for some distance beyond 
the limits of vision. We also note on the verge of the unseen field the 
hither margins of certain ring-shaped structures, the so-called volca- 
noes, evidently of large size, so that it is fair to conclude that these 
features are continued on the unseen part. Moreover, there are some 
light-colored bands, such as on this side of the moon always radiate 
from crater-like pits, which apparentl}' come over from such centers 
on the unseen part. These several facts, taken together, make it 
eminently probable that the unseen four-tenths of the lunar surface in 
no essential way differs from that we observe. It is, indeed, altogether 
likely that we see ever}' type of structure that (^xistson the moon, and 
that a view of its whole area would add nothing essentially new to our 
knowledge of the sphere. 

Seen by persons of ordinaril}' good vision, even at a distance of 
about 240, (XH) miles, the moon reveals much of its surface shape, struc- 
ture, and color; it is evident that the color varies greatly from very 
bright areas to those which are relatively dark, that the latter are 
somewhat less in total extent than the former, and that they are dis- 
posed in a general way across the northern hemisphere.'' Persons of 
more than usually good vision may, under favorable conditions, see on 
the edge of the illuminated area the ragged line of the sunlight, which 
indicates that the surface is very irregular, the high points coming 
into the day before the lower are illuminated. Such persons at time 
of full moon can also note, thougli faintly, some of the bright ])ands 
which, radiating from certain crater-like pits, extend for great distances 
over the surface. So, too, they may see at the tirst stage of the new 
and the last of the old moon, the light from the sunlit earth slightly 
illuminating the dark part of the lunar sphere, or, as it is often termed, 
the old moon in the arms of the new. 

With the ])est modern telescopes under the most suitable conditions 
of observation the moon is seen as it would be b}' the unaided eye if 

«An excellent noninathematical presentation of the question, which affords a 
sufficient idea of it, may be found in The IMoou, by Richard A. Proctor, p]i. 117 
et seq., D. Appleton & Co., New York, 1878. 

f'ltis well to note the fact that in a celestial telescope objects are seen in reverse 
position, or "upside down." For convenience they are usually so depicted on maps 
and pictures of the moon; the north pole at the bottom, and the east where it is cus- 
tomary to place the west on terfestrial maps. 



GENERAL DESCRlPTlOlSf OF THE MOON. 107 

it were not more than about -iO miles from the observer. The condi- 
tions of this seeing are much more favorable than tliose under which 
we behold a range of terrestrial mountains at tliat distance, for the 
reason that the air, and especialh" the moisture, in our atmosphere 
hinders and confuses the light, and there is several times as much of 
this obstruction encountered in a distance of iO miles along the earth's 
surface as there is in looking vertically upward. 

Seen with the greater telescopes, the surface of the moon may reveal 
to able observers, in the rare moments of the best seeing, circular 
objects, such as pits, which are perhaps not more than 500 feet in 
diameter. Elevations of much less height ma}^ be detected by their 
shadows, which, because there is no trace of an atmosphere on the 
moon, are extraordinarily sharp, the line between the dark and light 
being as distinct as though drawn by a ruler. Elongate objects, such 
as rifts or crevices in the surface, because of their length, may be vis- 
ible even when they are onl}" a few score feet in width, for the same 
reason that while a black dot on a wall may not make any impression 
on the e3^e, a line no wider than the dot can be readily perceived. 
Owing to these conditions, the surface of the moon has revealed many 
of its features to us, perhaps about as well as we could discern them 
by the naked eye if the sphere were no more than 20 miles awa}^ 

Separated from all theories and prepossessions, the most important 
points which have been ascertained as to the condition of the moon's 
surface are as follows: 

The surface di tiers from that of the earth in the fact that it lacks 
the envelopes of air and water. That there is no air is indicated by 
the feature above noted — that there is no diffusion of the sunlight, the 
shadows being absolutely black and with perfectly clean-cut edges. 
It is also shown l)y the fact that when a star is occulted or shut out by 
the disc of the moon it disappears suddenly without its light being 
displaced, as it would ])e by refraction if there were any sensi])le 
amount of air in the line of its rays. This evidence affords proof that 
if there is an}" air at all on the moon's surface it is probabl}" less in 
amount than remains in the nearest approach to a vacuiau we can 
produce by means of an air pump. Like proof of the airless nature 
of the moon is afforded by the spectroscope applied to the study of 
the light of an occulting star or that of the sun as it is becoming 
eclipsed b}' the moon. In fact, a great body of evidence goes to show 
that there is no air whatever on the lunar surface. 

The evidence of lack of water at the present time on the surface of 
the moon appears to be as complete as that whicli shows the lack' of an 
atmosphere. In the first place, there are evidently no seas or even 
lakes of discernible size. There are clearly no rivers. If such fea- 
tures existed, the reflection of the sun from their surfaces would make 



108 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. 

them exceedingly conspicuous on the dark background of the moon, 
which for all its apparent brightness is really as dark as the more 
somber-hued rocks of the earth's surface when lit by the sun. More- 
over, even were water present, without an atmosphere there could be 
no such circulation as takes place on the earth, upward to clouds and 
thence downward by the rain and streams to the ocean. Clouds can 
not exist unless there be an atmosphere in which they can float, and 
even if there be an air of exceeding tenuity on the moon, it is surely 
insuflicient to support a trace of clouds. Some distinguished astrono- 
mers have thought to discern something floating of a cloud-like 
nature, but these ol)servations, though exceedingly interesting, are 
not sufficiently verified to have much weight against the body of 
well-observed facts that shows the moon to be essentially waterless. 

The well-established absence of l)oth air and water in any such 
quantities as is necessarj^ to maintain organic life appears to exclude 
the possibility of there being an}' such life as that of plants and ani- 
mals on the lunar surface. It may be stated that very few astronomers 
are now inclined to believe that the moon can possibly be the abode of 
living forms. 

Being without an efl'ective atmosphere, for the possible but unproved 
remnant that may exist there would be quite inefl'ective, the moon 
lacks the defense against radiation of heat which the air affords the 
earth. Therefore in the long lunar night the outflow of heat must 
bring the temperature of the darkened part to near that of the celestial 
spaces, certainly to some hundred degrees below Fahrenheit zero. 
Even in the long day this lack of air and consequent easy radiation 
must prevent any considerable warming of the surface. The temper- 
ature of the moon has been made the matter of numerous experiments. 
These, for various reasons, have not proved very effective. The most 
trustworthy, the series undertaken by S. P. Langley, indicate that at 
no time does the heat attain to that of melting ice. 

Turning now to the shape and structure of the moon's crust, we 
observe that it differs much from that of the earth. Considering first 
the more general features, we note that there are none of those broad 
ridges and furrows — the continents and the sea basins. A portion of 
the surface, mainly in the northern hemisphere, is occupied l\v wide 
plains, which in their general shape are more nearl}' level than any 
equally extensive areas of the land, or, so far as we know, of the ocean 
floor of the earth, though they are beset with very many slight irregu- 
larities. These areas of rough, dark-hued plains are the seas or maria 
of selenographers, so termed because of old the}^ were, from their rela- 
tivel}" level nature, supposed to be areas of water. These maria occupy 
about one-third of the visible surface. Their height is somewhat less 
than that of the crust outside of their area. The remaining portion of 



GENEEAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. 109 

the moon is extremel}^ rug-ged. It is evident that the average declivity 
of the slopes is far greater than on the earth. This is apparent in all 
the features made visible by the telescope, and it likely extends to 
others too minute to be seen by the most powerful instruments. 
Zollner, by a very ingenious computation based on the amount of 
sunlight reflected, estimates that the average angle of the lunar surface 
to its horizon is 52 degrees. Though we have no such basis for reck- 
oning the average slope of the lands and sea bottoms of the earth, it 
is eminently probable that it does not amount to more than a tenth of 
that declivity. This difference, as well as many others, is probably 
due to the lack on the moon of the work of water, which so effectively 
breaks down the steeps of the earth, tending ever to bring the surface 
to a uniform level. 

The most notable feature on the lunar surface is the existence of 
exceedingh" numerous pits, generally with ring-like walls about them, 
which slope very steeply to a central cavity and more gentl}^ toward 
the surrounding country. These pits vary greatly in size; the largest 
are more than a hundred miles in diameter, while the smallest discerni- 
ble are less than a half mile across. The number increases as the size 
diminishes; there are many thousands of them, so small that they are 
revealed only when sought for with the most powerful telescopes and 
with the best seeing. In all these pits, except those of the smallest 
size, and possibly in these also, there is within the ring wall and at a 
considerable though variable depth below its summit a nearly flat floor, 
which often has a central })it of small size or in its place a steep, rude 
cone. When this plain is more than 20 miles in diameter, and with 
increasing numbers as the floor is wider, there are generally other 
irregularly scattered pits and cones. Thus in the case of Plato, a ring 
about 60 miles in diameter, there are some scores of these lesser pits. 
On the interior of the ring walls of the pits over 10 miles in diameter 
there are usually more or less distinct terraces, which suggest, if the}' 
do not clearly indicate, that the material now forming the solid floors 
they inclose was once fluid and stood at greater heights in the pit than 
that at which it became permanently frozen. It is, indeed, tolerably 
certain that the last movement of this material of the floors was one 
of interrupted subsidence from an originally greater elevation on the 
outside of the ring wall, which is commonly of irregular height, with 
many peaks. There are sometimes tongues or protrusions of the sub- 
stance which forms the ring, as if it had flowed a short distance and 
then had cooled with steep slopes. 

The foregoing account of the pits on the lunar surface suggests to 
the reader that these features are volcanoes. That view of their nature 
was taken by the astronomers who first saw them with the telesco|)e 
and has been generall}^ held by their successors. That they are in 



110 GENEEAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. 

some way, and rather nearly, related to the volcanic vents of the earth 
appear.s certahi. We have now to note the following peculiar condi- 
tions of these pits. First, that they exist in var3'ing proportion, with 
no evident law of distribution, all over the visible area of the moon. 
Next, that in many instances they intersect each other, showing that 
they were not all formed at the same time, but in succession; that the 
larger of them are not fomid on the maria, ]>ut on the upland and 
apparently the older parts of the surface; and that the evidence from 
the intersections clearly shows that the greater of these structures are 
prevailingly the elder and that in general the smallest were the latest 
formed. In other words, whatever was the nature of the action 
involved in the production of these curious structures, its energy 
diminished with time, until in the end it could no longer break the 
crust. 

All over the surface of the moon, outside of the maria, in the regions 
not occupied by the volcano-like structures, we find an exceedingly 
irregular surface, consisting usually of rude excrescences with no dis- 
tinct arrangement, which may attain the height of many thousand feet. 
These, when large, have been termed mountains, though they are 
very unlike any on the earth in their lack of the features due to 
erosion, as well as in the general absence of order in their association. 
Elevations of this steep, lumpy form are common on all parts of the 
moon. Outside of the maria they are seen at their best in the region 
near the north pole, where a large field thus l)eset is termed the Alps. 
From the largest of these elevations a series of like forms can be made 
of smaller and smaller size until they become too minute to be revealed 
by the teles(?ope; as they decrease in height they tend to become more 
regular in shape, ver}^ often taking on a dome-like aspect. The only 
terrestrial elevations at all resembling these lunar reliefs are certain 
rarely occurring masses of trachytic lava, which appear to have been 
spewed out through crevices in a semifluid state, and to have been so 
rapidl}^ hardened in cooling that the slopes of the solidified rock 
remained very steep. The only reliefs on the moon that remind the 
geologist of true mountains are certain low ridges on the surfaces of 
the maria. 

The surface of the moon exhibits a very great number of fissures or 
rents which, when widely opened, are termed valleys, and when nar- 
row, rills. Both these names were given because these grooves were 
supposed to have been the result of erosion due to flowing water. 
The valleys are frequently broad, in the case of that known as the 
"Alpine Valley," at certain places several miles in width; they are steep 
walled, and sometimes a mile or more in depth; their bottoms, when 
distinctly visible, are seen to be beset wnth crater-like pits, and show 
in no instance a trace of water work, which necessarily excavates 



GENEEAL DESCEIPTION OF THE MOON. Ill 

smooth clescendiiio- floors .such as we And in terrestrial vallej^s. The 
rills are narrow crevices, often so narrow that their bottoms can not 
be seen; they frequently branch, and in some instances are continued 
as branching cracks for 100 miles or more. The characteristic rills ai"e 
far more a))undant than the valleys, there being man}' scores already 
described; the slighter are evidently the more numerous; a catalogue 
of those visible in the best telescopes would probably amount to several 
thousand. (See plates vi, ix, x.) 

It is a noteworthy fact that in the case of the rills, and in great 
measure also in the valleys, the two sides of the fissure correspond so 
that if brought together the rent would be closed. This indicates that 
they are essentially cracks which have opened by their walls drawing 
apart. Curiousl}' enough, as compared with rents in the earth's crust, 
there is little trace of a change of level of the two sides of these rills — 
only in one instance is there such a displacement well made out, that 
known as the Straight Wall, where one side of the break is several hun- 
dred feet above the other. (See plate ix.) 

In the region outside of the maria much of the general surface of 
the moon between the numerous crater-like openings appears in the 
best seeing with powerful telescopes to be beset with minute pits, often 
so close together that their limits are so far confused that it appears 
as honeycombed, or, rather, as a mass of furnace slag full of holes if 
greatly magnified, through which the gases developed in melting the 
mass escaped. (See plate v.) 

Perhaps the most exceptional feature of the lunar surface, as com- 
pared with that of the earth, is found in the numerous systems of 
radiating light bands, in all about thirty in number, which diverge 
from patches of the same hue about certain of the crater-like pits. 
These bands of light-colored material are generally narrow, not more 
than a few miles in width; they extend for great distances, certain of 
them being over 1,000 miles in length, one of them attaining- to 1,700 
miles in linear extent. In one instance at least, in the crater named 
Saussure, a ])and which intersects the pit may be seen crossing its 
floor, and less distinctly, yet clearly enough, it appears on the steep 
inside walls of the cavit}' . In no well-observed case do these radiating 
streaks of light-colored material coincide with the before-mentioned 
splits or rifts. Yet the assemblage of facts, though the observations 
and the theories based upon them are very discrepant, lead us to 
believe that the}- are in the nature of stains or sheets of matter on the 
surface of the sphere, or perhaps in the mass of the crust. At some 
points the rays of one system cross those of another in a manner that 
indicates that the one is of later formation than the other. (See plates 

III, VII, YIII.) 



112 GENEEAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. 

Perhaps the most puzzling feature of the radiating streaks, where 
everything is perplexing, is found in the way the}" come into view and 
disappear in each lunar period. When the surface is illuminated by 
the very oblique rays of the sun they are quite invisible; as the lunar 
dav advances they become faintly discernible, but are onl}" seen in 
perfect clearness near the full moon. The reason for this peculiar 
appearance of these light bands under a high sun has been a matter 
of much conjecture; it is the subject of di.scussion in a later chapter 
of this memoir, where it is shown that inasmuch as these bands appear 
when the earth light falls upon the moon at a high angle, the effect 
must be due to the angle of incidence of the rays on the shining sur- 
faces. It should be noted that the light bands in most instances 
diverge from more or less broad fields of light color about the crater- 
like pits, fields which have the same habit of glowing under a high 
illumination; in fact, a large part of the surface of the moon, perhaps 
near one-tenth of its visible area, becomes thus relatively brilliant at 
full moon, though it lacks that quality at the earlier and later stages 
of the lunar day. 

In the above-considered statement concerning the visible phenomena 
of the moon no account is taken of a great variety of obscure features 
which, though easily seen with fairly good instruments, have received 
slight attention from selenographers. As can readily be imagined, 
observers find it difficult to discern dindy seen features which can not 
be classed in any group of terrestrial objects. Whosoever will nar- 
rowly inspect any part of the lunar surface, noting everything that 
meets his eye, will find that he observes much that can not be explained 
by what is seen on the earth. It is evident, indeed, that while in the 
earlier stages of development this satellite in good part followed the 
series of changes undergone by its planet there came a stage in which 
it ceased to continue the process of evolution that the parent body has 
undergone. The reason for this arrest in development appears to have 
been the essential if not complete absence of an atmosphere and of 
water. 

The difference in height between the lowest and highest points on 
the lunar surface is not determined. To the most accented reliefs, 
those of the higher crater walls, elevations of more than 25,000 feet 
have been assigned; it is, however, to be noted that all these deter- 
minations are made from the length of the shadows cast by the emi- 
nences, with no effective means of correcting for certain errors 
incidental to this method. It ma}" be assumed as tolerably certain 
that a number of these elevations have their summits at least 20,000 
feet above their bases, and that a few are yet higher. We do not 
know how much lower than the ground about these elevations are the 
lowest parts of the moon. My own observations incline me to the 



GENEKAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. 113 

opinion that the difference may well amount to as much as 10,000 feet, 
so that the total relief of the moon may amount to somewhere between 
30,000 and 40,000 feet. That of the earth from the deepest part of 
the oceans to the highest mountain summits is probably between 
55,000 and 60,000 feet; so that notwithstanding- the lack of erosion 
and sedimentation which in the earth continually tends to diminish 
the difference between the sea-floor and land areas, the surface of 
the satellite has a much less range of elevation than the planet. If the 
forces which have built the mountains and continents of the earth had 
operated without the erosive action of water, there is little doubt that 
the difference in height between the highest and lowest parts would 
now be many times as great as it is on the moon,

[In accordance with the usage of selenographers, the plates are printed in the 
reversed order in which they appear in a celestial telescope. The top of each is the 
south, the bottom the north, the right-hand the east, and the left the west.] 

In n. I the most noteworthy features are the maria of the western half of the 
visible portion of the si)here. Tlie rudely circular form of these fields is well shown, 
also tlie fact tliat none of them extend to the margin or "liml)" of the moon. The 
bright, slightly curved ridge in the lower half of the picture facing the partly illu- 
minated mare — the Mare Imbrium — is the Apennines; the large vulcanoid at its 
southern end is Eratosthenes. The larger pit in the ocean opposite the center of the 
range is Archimedes; the two craters next to the north are, the nearer, Autolycus, 
and the farther and larger, Aristillus. The larger of the two dark pits near the 
northern end of the Apennines is Eudoxus, the smaller, Aristoteles. Southeast from 
these iTaters lie the Alps, a group of bright peaks extending in a northeast and south- 
west direction. A faint, dark streak shows the position of the Alpine Valley. The 
flat, irregular area north of the range is the M. Frigoris. 

Close insi)ection of this plate will show that many of the vulcanoids" have pits or 
cones on their floors, and that these are very often in the center of these level spaces. 

The radiating bands or streaks are beginning to appear. 

In the Mare Indjrium, near the western end of the Alps, next north of Aristillus, 
is Cassini, of which the encircling cone appears to have been partly melted down by 
the lava of the mare so that it shows as a faint ridge with a distinct central crater. 

flin this memoir all the features of the moon commonly termed "volcanoes" etc., 
are designated by tlie generic term "vulcanoid."

The most noteworthy changes as compared with PI. I are the great advance in 
the development of the fields of very bright hue, and in the bands radiating from 
them. These are most evident in the system of Copernicus. The system of Tycho 
also l)egins to be evident. This vnlcanoi<l may be identified as the deep large crater 
with a central cone near the border of the illuminated area. The general irregularity 
of these light bands is well phown in those about Copernicus. So, too, the fact that 
they are projections from an illuminated or lucent field about the vulcanoid. 

The relative absence of large vulcanoids on the maria is noteworthy. Those which 
exist lie nearly, if not altogether, on fields of high ground which appear to have risen 
above the floors of the maria and so escajied ir.elting. 

The problematical crater Liime now appears as a small white patch near the mid- 
dle of the eastern side of the INI. Serenitatis. 



PLATE TTI. 

Mooii^s age, 14 days 1 hdur. Juli/ 19, 16'91. Lick Ohservatory. 

In this plate the moon is nearly full, the light being oblique enough to illuminate 
the crater walls on the eastern margin alone. 

The maria are well shown nearly to the eastern margin. Separated by a belt of 
relatively high ground from the Oceanus Procellarum is the large vuU'anoid < Irimaldi. 
It has a small crater on its floor near its northern side. This vulcanoid has a floor 
nearly as dark as the seas. It will be noted that Plato has also a dark floor. On the 
margin of the Oceanus Procellarum, southwest of Grimaldi, is a crater Letronne rather 
indistinctly seen, the wall of which that faces the maria is, as in other instances, 
ruined apparently by the lava of the sea. Other like examples are shown in this 
neighborhood. On the shores of the M. Humorum there are tliree similar instances 
of crater walls broken down on the seaward side. 

It should be noted that none of the maria distinctly attain the margin of the 
moon's surface. On the eastern lands the O. Procellarum comes near to the border 
of the moon, l)ut higli, rugged land is obscurely visible on the very edge. This is 
more clearly disclosed at certain stages of libration. On the southwest border some 
observers think there is a nearly level area crossing the border, but, as will be seen, 
the level land there has not the characteristic dark hue of the maria. 

It will be observed that in this nearly vertical light, except Plato, the craters on 
the eastern margin only are distinctly visiV)le. Those exceptions are due to the 
dark color of their floors. There are two or three craters near the south pole which, 
because they have rather dark bottoms, are faintly seen.

At this stage of the waning moon the most interesting of its fields are no longer 
visible. There are few that command attention in this plate. It may be noted that 
the system of light bands and the central patches whence they proceed, that have 
their center in Kepler, are still very bright. The dark mare-like floor of (jrrimaldi 
is visible near the bright margin of the sphere. The observer may obtain something 
of the impression, such as is afforded by good seeing with a powerful telescope, that 
the Oceanus Procellarum is a relatively shallow sea by the number of fragments of 
what seems to have been the more ancient surface that protrude through it. 



PLATE V. 

Moo7i's age, 21 days 16 liours. 1895, 

In this plate is depicted an area from near the moon's equator to near the south 
pole. On the eastern margin the sunlight is passing from the surface, the evening 
light being so oblique that the bottoms of the vulcanoids are more or less in shadow. 
Here and there, in the advancing night, there are lofty peaks on the margin of crater 
rims, which still receive a touch of sun and appear as bright points in a black field. 
On the western margin the surface is still well illuminated, with the consequent 
effect that the surface appears to be much smoother than it is. A view taken a few 
hours later would show about as rude a margin as is here depicted. 

Perhaps more effectively than any other this view shows how the general surface 
of the moon outside of the maria is essentially made up of vulcanoids and ridges, the 
apparently smooth parts appearing so only because the small irregularities are not 
visible. In this connection it should be noted that near the dark part the surface 
is seen to be beset by small shallow craters, the smallest visible being more than a 
mile in diameter and probably several hundred feet deep. Such pits, in equal num- 
bers to the unit of surface, exist on the bright part to the left when they are observed 
by the higher light. 

The way in which the smaller craters cut the larger is shown at many points in 
this field of view; so, too, the relative lack of sharpness of outline of the greater 
vulcanoids as compared with the lesser objects of this group. The low, narrow 
ridges which surround the pits are insufficiently shown because the light does not 
bring them out. They are best observed near the uppermost part of the picture. 

The generality of the fact that the larger craters have flat floors and that these 
floors are prevailingly nearly level is well indicated; so, too, the fact that there is 
a common tendency of these floors to have either a small crater or a cone in or 
near the center of each circular field. Four such craters in the central part of the 
area extending in an obscure line from near the base to near the middle of the pic- 
ture have cones in their centers. In all, about a dozen of the hundred or so instances 
in which they would be recognizable have this feature. It will be evident that all 
the craters in this region have their floors far below the level of the encircling ring 
and below the general lunar surface. 

In sundry instances two adjacent vulcanoids of moderate size have their neighbor- 
ing walls broken down so that they exhibit the first stage of "crater valleys," with 
a general north and soutli axis. There are in all about ten cases of this kind on this 
field, but several of them are not well disclosed by this illumination.

PLATE VI. 

Pliotographed by Ritchey with 40-ltic]i telescope, using yellow color screen and isochromatic 

plate. 

This plate shows jiart of the southwest quarter of the moon's visible surface. 

On the lower part of the plate is a portion of the Mare Tranquilitatis; on the middle 
of the left-hand side a portion of the Mare Nectaris. 

The large, deep vulcanoid with the steeji, ragged peaks rising from its floor, on the 
lower left-hand portion of the plate, is Theoiihilus, one of the noblest structures on 
the moon. The width of the crater is about 64 miles; the greatest height from the 
floor to the crest of the wall, 18,000 feet. The central mass, composed of several 
sharp peaks, rises about 6,000 feet above the lava plain. In the center of these 
masses there appears to be an obscure crater about half a mile in diameter. The 
terraces in the inner wall of the cone are indistinctly shown. 

Theophilus has partly invaded Cyrillus, the next large vulcanoid on the southeast, 
an older structure with less steep slopes and a generally ruined appearance. South of 
Cyrillus, at a distance of half its width, is Catherina. This crater is met by another 
of half its diameter, which has developed on one side of its floor. From near the 
southeastern margin of Catherina a beautiful row of small craters extends eastwardly 
for a distance of over 200 miles to the large vulcanoid Abulfeda. This is perhaps 
the most noteworthy crater row on the moon. 

The long, curved wall extending from Piccolomini, near the upper left-hand corner 
(the large crater with its floor in shadow), to the east side of Catherina, is the Altai 
Mountains. It should be noted that this step-like structure obscurely extends north- 
ward to the M. Tranquilitatis, where it forms an irregular ridge-like promontory. 



PLATE YII. 

Copernicus and Kepler. I'liotograplied }>y Bitchey with the 40-in<'h Yerkes refractor, with 
color screen and imchromatic plate. 

The most important features exliibited here are the systems of bright rays of 
Copernicus, Kepler, and Aristarclius. These three ray systems, though less exten- 
sive than those of Tyrho, taken together constitute the greatest exhibition of the 
bright bands that exist over the northern part of tlie surface. The complex branched 
nature of these bands is particularly well shown — better, indeed, than the writer has 
ever been able to note with the telescojae. The fact that the bright bands of each 
system are prolongations of a central bright field is tolerably well shown. 

Although owing to the high sun and the consequent absence of shadows, Coper- 
nicus in this view hardly appears as an elevation, it is, under favorable conditions of 
illumination, perhaps the noblest object on the moon. The wall on the eastern side, 
according to the estimates of Schmidt, rises to a height of 12,000 feet above the 
adjacent plain. The outer slopes of the cone are strongly ridged as by the flow 
from the crater of lavas which cooled on the steep slopes; some of these are faintly 
traceable in the plate.

PLATE YIII. 

Ray system about Tycho. Photographed by Ritchey. 

This, the most extensive of the ray systems of the moon, has its origin in the field 
about Tyclio, the large vulcanoid to which the numerous bands apparently converge. 
It appears under the high sun as a large pit with a compound central cone. The 
rays of this system should be compared with those which have their centers in 
Copernicus and Kepler. In these last-named groups the streaks are developed on 
relatively level ground, while on that of Tycho they intersect a rugged surface. 

On the right hand, some of the bands may be seen crossing the Mare Nubium. 
Two of them, of great length, are seen to be nearly parallel for a distance of some 
hundred miles. 

A number of large vulcanoids, partly in shadow, are shown on the southeast 
margin of the moon. Of these, the largest is Schiller. Its length, which is 112 miles, 
will serve as a scale in estimating that of the rays. 



PLATE IX. 

Mare Nuhium and surroundings. Fhotixjraphed hy Ritchey, November 21, 1901, 7 hours 
32 minutes p. m. Exposure, 1 second. 

In this plate Copernicus is the large vulcanoid on the lower margin. The large 
crater near the upper margin, a little to the right of the center, with a cone some- 
what to the right of its center and "rill" on its floor, is Pitatus. The three great 
vulcanoids in a row extending in a north-and-south direction are, in succession 
from the lowest toward the upper margin of the plate, Ptolemauis, Alphonsus, and 
Arzachel. The large, deep crater below and tf) the right of Pitatus, with a divide<l 
central cone, is BuUialdus. 

The most noteworthy features in this plate are found in the many instances in 
which the lavas of the maria have partly destroyed the vulcanoids within their 
fields. In the upper right-hand fourth f>f the plate there are a dozen or more of 
these ruined craters, some of them with their walls almost effaced. In this part of 
the field there are several important rills. Some of these are evidently rows of 
craterlets in which the adjacent walls of the pits have been broken down so as to 
form a ragged cleft. A number of these lines of craterlets are traceable on the 
external slopes of Copernicus. The long, dark line, 65 miles in length, in the upper 
third of the plate, a little to the left of the center, is the Straight Wall, the most 
extensive fault known on the moon. The height of its cliff is about 500 feet. The 
crescent-shaped structure at its southern (upper) end is the remnant of a crater, the 
remainder of the margin having been destroyed l)y the lava of the mare. To the 
right of and near by the Straight Wall is a rill extending in a slightly curved course 
for a length of about 40 miles, terminating at either end in a distinct craterlet. 

The brightly illuminated part of the field depicted on this plate, that to the left 
of the center, exhibits many excellent examples of crater valleys, which in their 
series afford something like a passage from the condition of rills to those of wider 
depressions.

Tlais plate includes nearly the whole of the INIare Tranquilitatis and, on the lower 
margin, a portion of the M. Serenitatis. The large crater near the strait connecting 
these niaria is Plinius. The highland nearest to it is the promontory of Acherusia. 
On the southern, or upper, margin the view extends to the flanks of Theophilus. 

The most noteworthy features are the mountain ridges on the maria, the manner 
in which the maria come in contact with the higher ground, the numerous crater 
valleys, and the great "rills." 

It may be noted that ridges on the maria exhibit little trace of corresponding 
troughs between them, such as are usually found in terrestrial mountain chains. 

The contact of the maria with the high ground has evidently resulted in the 
partial melting of the walls of several vulcanoids. Where these structures are not 
thus affected they are, apparently, in origin later than the formation of the maria. 
The crater valleys are abundant on the right-hand or eastern side of the field. 
Certain of them have been invaded by the lava of the mare. 

Some of the greater rills are very well shown. That on the extreme right side is 
Hyginus. It will be observed that the course of these rills is at high angles to the 
prevailing direction of the ridges on the mare. 



THE PRESSURE DUE TO RADIATION." 



By E. F. Nichols and G. F. Hull. 



As early as 1619 Kepler'' announced his belief that the solar repul- 
sion of the finely divided matter of comets' tails was due to the out- 
ward pressure of light. On the corpuscular theor}^ of light, Newton^ 
considered Kepler's idea as plausible enough, but he was of the opinion 
that the phenomenon was analogous to the rising of smoke in our own 
atmosphere. In the first half of the eighteenth century De Mairan and 
Du Fay '^ contrived elaborate experiments to test this pressure-of -light 
theory in the laboratory, but, because of the disturbing action of the 
gases surrounding the illuminated bodies employed in the measure- 
ments, they obtained wholl}' confusing and contradictory results. 
Later in the same century Rev. A. Bennef performed further exper- 
iments, but could find no repulsive force not traceable to convection 
currents in the gas surrounding the body upon which the light was 
projected, due, in his opinion, to the heating efl'ect of the ra3's. Find- 
ing no pressure due to radiation, he made the following unique sug- 
gestion in support of the wave theory of light: 

Perhaps sensible heat and light may not be caused by the influx or rectilinear 
projection of fine particles, but by the vibrations made in the universally diffused 
caloric or matter of heat or fluid of light. 1 think modern discoveries, especially 
those of electricity, favor the latter hypothesis. 

In the meantime Euler,-^' accepting Kepler's theory attributing the 
phenomenon of comets' tails to light pressure, had hastened to the

IIB THE PRESSURE DUE TO RADIATION. 

support of the wave theory by showing theoreticall}^ that a longitudi- 
nal wave motion might produce a pressure in the direction of its 
propagation upon a body which checked its progress. In 1825 Fres- 
nel ^ made a series of experiments, but arrived at no more definite 
conclusion than that the repulsive and attractive forces observed were 
not of magnetic nor electric origin. 

Crookes^ believed in 1873 that he had found the true radiation pres- 
sure in his newly invented radiometer, and cautiously suggested that 
his experiments might have some bearing on the prevailing theory of 
the nature of light. Crookes's later experiments and Zollner's*^ meas- 
urements of radiometric repulsions showed that the radiometric forces 
were in some cases 100,000 times greater than the light pressure forces 
with which they had been temporaril}' confused. Zollner's experi- 
ments are among the most ingenious ever tried in this field of work, 
and he missed the discovery of the true radiation pressure by only the 
narrowest margin. An excellent bibliography of the whole radio- 
metric literature is given by Graetz,'' and an account of some of the 
older experiments not mentioned above is given by Crookes. ^ 

In 1S73 Maxwell,-^ on the basis of the electromagnetic theorv, showed 
that if light were an electromagnetic phenomenon, pi-essure should 
result from the absorption or reflection of a beam of light. After a 
discussion of the equations involved, he says: 

Hence in a medium in which waves are propagated there is a pressure in the 
direction normal to the waves and numerically equal to the energy in unit volume. 

Maxwell computed the pressure exerted by the sun on the illuminated 
surface of the earth, and added: 

It is probable that a nmch greater energy of radiation might be obtained by means 
of the concentrated rays from an electric lamp. Such rays falling on a thin metallic 
disk, delicately suspended in a vacuum, might perhaps produce an observable 
mechanical effect. 

Apparentl}^ independent of Maxwell, Bartoli ^ announced in 1876 
that the second law of thermodynamics required the existence of a 
pressure due to radiation numerically equal in amount to that derived 
by Maxwell. Bartoli's reasoning holds for all forms of energy streams 
in space, and is of more general application than Maxwell's equations. 
Bartoli contrived elaborate experiments to verify this theory, but was 
balked in the search, as all before him had been, by the complicated

Goldhammer,*^ Fitzgerald,'" Lebedew,^ and Hull''' have discussed the 
])earing of radiation pressure upon the Newtonian law of gravitation, 
with special reference to the repulsion of comets' tails by the sun. 
The theory of radiation pressure, combined with the known properties 
in negative electrons, has recently been more or less speculatively 
applied by Arrhenius* to the explanation of many cosmical and 
terrestrial phenomena, among which the following may be mentioned: 
The solar corona, zodiacal light, gegenschein, comets, origin of come- 
tary and meteoric material in space, the emission of gaseous nebulas, 
the peculiar changes observed in the nebula surrounding Nova Persei, 
the northern lights, the variations in atmospheric electricity and ter- 
restial magnetism and in the barometric pressure. Schwarzschild' 
computed from radiation pressure on small spherical conductors the 
size of bodies of unit density for which the ratio of radiation pressure 
to gravitational attraction would be a maximum. 

Before the Congres international de Physique in IIMJO, Professor 
Lebedew,^' of the University of Moscow, described an arangement of 
apparatus which he was using at that time for the measurement of 
light pressure. He sun)marizes the results already obtained as follows: 

Les resultats des mesures que j'ai faites jusqu'ici peuvent se resumer ainsi: L'ex- 
perience montre qu'un faisceau lumineux incident exerce sur les surfaces planes 
absorbantes et reflechissantes des pressions qui, aux erreurs pres d'observation, sont 
egales aux valeurs calculees par Maxwell et Bartoli. 

No estimate of the "errors of observation" was given in the paper, 
nor other numerical data. Unfortunatel}" the proceedings of the Paris 
Congress did not reach the writers, nor any intimation of the methods 
or results of Professor Lebedew\s work, until after the publication of 
their own preliminary experiments.

118 THE PRESSURE DUE TO RADIATION. 

The writers'* presented the results they had obtained by measure- 
ments of radiation pressure at eight different gas pressures, in a pre- 
liminary communication to the American Physical Society, meeting 
with Section B of the American Association at Denver, August 29, 
1901. The main arguments underlying the method of measurement 
of the radiation pressure ma}^ here be given. 

In the experiments of earlier investigators every approach to the 
experimental solution of the problem of radiation pressure had been 
balked by the disturbing action of the gases which it is impossible to 
remove entirely from the space surrounding the body upon which the 
radiation falls. The forces of attraction or repulsion, due to the 
action of gas molecules, are functions, first, of the temperature differ- 
ence between the body and its surroundings, caused by the absorption 
by the body of a portion of the rays which fall upon it; and, second, 
of the pressure of the gas surrounding the illuminated body. In the 
particular form of apparatus used in the present study, the latter 
function appears very complicated, and certain peculiarities of the gas 
action remain inexplicable upon the basis of any simple group of 
assumptions which the writers have so far been able to make. 

Since we can neither do away entirely with the gas nor calculate its 
effect under varying conditions, the only hopeful approach which 
remains is to devise apparatus and methods of observ^ation Avliich will 
reduce the errors due to gas action to a minimum. The following 
considerations led to a method by which the elimination of the gas 
action was practically accomplished in the present experiments: 

1. The surfaces which receive the radiation, the pressure of which 
is to be measured, should be as perfect reflectors as possible. This will 
reduce the gas action by making the rise of temperature due to absorp- 
tion small, while the radiation pressure will l)e increased; the theory 
recjuiring that a beam totally reflected shall exert twice the pressure 
of an equal beam completel}^ absorbed. 

2. By studying the action of a beam of constant intensity upon the 
same surface surrounded by air at different pressures certain pressures 
may be found where the gas action is less than at others. 

3. The apparatus — some sort of torsion balance — should carry two 
surfaces symmetrically placed with reference to the rotation axis, and 
the surfaces of the two arms should be as nearly equal as possible in 
ever}^ respect. The surfaces or vanes should be so constructed that if 
the forces due to gas action (whether suction or pressure on the warmer 
surface) and radiation pressure have the same sign in one case, a reversal 
of the suspension should reverse the gas action and bring the two forces 
into opposition. In this way a mean of the forces on the two faces of 
the suspension should be, in part at least, free from gas action. 

«E. F. Nichols and G. F. Hull, Science, 14, 588 (October 18, 1901); Phys. Rev., 13, 
293 (November, 1901); Astrophysical Journal, 15, p. 62 (January, 1902). 



THE PRESSURE DUE TO RADIATION. 119 

4. Radiation pressure, from its nature, must reach its maxinuim 
value instantly, while observation has shown that gas action begins at 
zero and increases with length of exposure, rising rapidly at first, 
then more slowl}" to its maxinuun effect, which, in many of the cases 
observed, was not reached until the exposure had lasted from two and 
a half to three minutes. For large gas pressures an even longer expos- 
ure was necessary to reach stationary conditions. The gas action ma}" 
be thus still further reduced l)v a ballistic or semiballistic method of 
measurement. 

In the number of the Annalen der Physik for Noveml)er, 1901, Pro- 
fessor Lebedew'^' published the results of a more varied series of 
measurements of radiation pressure than the early measurements of 
the present writers. 

Professor Lebedew's'^ estimate of the accuracy of his work is such 
as to admit of possible errors of 20 per cent in his final results. An 
analysis of Professor Lebedew's paper and comparison with our pre- 
liminar\' experiments seem to show that his accidental errors were 
larger than ours, but through an undiscovered false resistance in the 
bolometer our final results were somewhat further from the theory 
than his. Either of the above researches would have been sufficient 
to establish the existence of a pressure due to radiation, but neither 
research ofi:'ered, in our judgment, a satisfactory (luantitative confirma- 
tion of the Maxwell-Bartoli theorv.

Deseriptiooi of apparatus; the torsion halance. — The form of suspen- 
sion of the torsion balance, used to measure radiation pressure in the 
present study, is seen in fig. 1. The rotation axis (/ h was a fine rod 
of drawn glass. A drawn-glass cross arm c, bent down at either end 
into a small hook, was attached to the axis. The surfaces C and D, 
which received the light ])eani, were circular microscope cover-glasses, 
12.8 nnn. in diameter and 0.17 nun. thick, weighing- approximately 
51 mg. each. To distinguish the two vanes from each other, in case 
individual differences should appear in the measure.! ents, and also to 
mark the two faces of each vane for subsequent recognition, a letter 
C was marked on one and D on the other by diamond scratches. 
Through each glass a hole 0.5 mm. or less in diameter was drilUnl near 
the edge, by means of which the glasses could be hung on the hooks 
on the cross arm c. On opposite sides of the rotation axis at <l two 
other drawn-glass cross arms were attached. The cover-glass(>s slipped 
easily between these, and were thus held securely in one plane.

fitted the neck of the bell jar, which could thus be put in connection

pressures were measured on the ISIacLeod gauge in the usual way. 
A semicircular magnet M, fitted to

was used to direct the suspended 
magnet 111., and thus to control the 
zero position of the torsion balance. 
By turning M through 1S0\ the op- 
posite faces of the vanes C and D 
could be presented to the light. 

THE AKRANGEMENT OF APPAKATUS. 



A horizontal section of the appa- 
ratus through the axis of the light 
beam is shown in fig. 2. The white- 
hot end of the horizontal carbon S^ 
of an A. T. Thompson 90- arc lamp, 
fed by alternating current, served as 
a source. The arc played against 
the end of the horizontal carbon 
from the vertical carbon, which was 3 
screened from the lenses L^ and L, >- 
})y an asbestos diaphragm d^. A 
lens, not shown,, projected an en- 
larged image of the arc and carbons 
on an adjacent wall, so that the posi- 
tion of the carbons and the condition 
of the arc could be seen at all times 
]>v lioth observers. 

The cone of ravs passing through 
the small diaphragm J, fell upon the 
glass condensing lenses L^, Lg. ^ 

At cZg a diaphragm, 11.25 mm. in 
diameter, was interposed, which per- 
mitted onlv the central portion of 
the cone of rays to pass. Just be- 
yond d.j^ the beam passed to a shutter r- 
at S.3. This shutter was worked by liij[2 
a magnetic escapement, operated by 
the second's contact of a standard 





clock. The observer at T^ might choose the second for opening or 
closing the shutter, but the shutter's motion alwa3's took place at 
the time of the second's contact in the clock. Any exposure was

thus of some wliolo number of seconds' duration. The opening in 
the shutter was such as to kH through, at the time of exposure, all 
of the direct beam which passed through r/.,, Ijut to shut out stray 
light. Just be^'ond the shutter and attached to the diaphragm d^ was 
a 45^ glass plate, which reflected a part of the beam to the lens L^, by 
means of which an image of d.^ was projected upon one arm of a bolo- 
meter at R. The glass lens L., focused a sharp image of the aperture 
d.^ in the plane of the vanes of the torsion balance Bj, imder the bell 
jar. The l)ell jar was provided with three plate-glass windows W^, 
Wg, W3. The first two gave a circular opening- 42 mm, in diameter, 
and through the third deflections of the balance were read by a 
telescope and scale. The lens L3 was arranged to move horizontally 
between the stops S3 and 8^. These were so adjusted that when the 
lens was against S., the sharp image of the aperture d.^ fell centrally 
upon one vane; and when against S^ the image fell centrally upon the

other. This adjustment, which was a very important one, was made 
b}' the aid of a telescope T.,, mounted on the carriage of a dividing 
engine. This was used to observe and measure the position of the 
rotation axis, as well as the positions of the images of d.^^ when the 
lens L3 was against the stops. For the latter measurements the vanes 
could ])e moved out of the wa}' by turning the suspension through 
90'^ b}^ the control magnet M (fig. 1). 

To make sure that the balance as used was entirel,y free from any 
magnetic moment or disturl)ance, the small magnet m., was clamped in 
one position to maintain a constant zero, and the period of the balance 
was accurately measured with the axis of the large magnet M in the 
vertical plane of the vanes and again when the axis was at right angles 
to the plane of the vanes. Several series of this sort failed to show a 
difference of 0.1 second in the period of the balance for the two posi- 
tions of the maernet. 



THE PRESSURE DUE TO RADIATION. 123 

The bolometer at K. (tig-. 2) was of sheet platinum, 0.001 mm. thick, 
rolled in silver. The strip was cut out in the form shown in fig. 3 
and mounted on a thin sheet of slate 8. Two windows had been cut 
in the slate behind the strips at ABCD where the silver had lieen 
removed, lea^ ing the thin platinum. The platinum surfaces were 
blackened b}' Kurlbaum's process. The image from L5 (tig. 2) fell 
at D. The silver ends between A and C were connected with E and 
F, respectivel}'. On the heavy wire EF a sliding contact c served to 
balance the bridge, all four arms of which- are shown in the figure. 

METHODS OF OBSERVATION. 

The observations leading to the results given later were of three 
different kinds: (1) the calibration of the torsion balance; (2) the 
measurement of the pressure of radiation in terms of the constant of 
the balance, and (3) the measurement of the energy of the same l)eam 
in erg-seconds h}^ the rate of temperature rise of a blackened silver 
disk of known mass and specific heat. 

1. The determination of the constant of the torsion l)alance was 
made by removing the vanes C and D and accurately measuring the 
period of vibration. Its moment of inertia was easily computed 
from the masses and distribution of the various parts aljout the axis 
of rotation. The moment of torsion for 1 mm. defiection on a scale 
105 cm. distant was 0.363X10 '' dyne X cm. This value divided by 
one-half the distance between the centers of the light spots on the two 
vanes gave the force in dynes per scale division deflection. As the 
light spots were circles 11.25 nun. in diameter, the area of the image 
was ver}' nearly 1 cm.'; hence the above procedure gave roughly the 
pressure in dynes per square centimeter. 

2. In the measurements of radiation pressure it was easier to refer 
the intensity of the beam at each exposure to sonie arbitrary standard 
which could be kept constant than to try to hold the lamp as stead}^ 
as would otherwise have been necessary. For this purpose, the bolom- 
eter at R (fig. 2) was introduced, and sinudtaneous observations 
were made of the relative intensity of the reflected beam by the deflec- 
tion of the galvanometer Go and the pressure due to th(> transmitted 
beam b}" the defiection of the torsion balance. The actual defi(>ction 
of the balance was then reduced to a deflection corresponding to a gal- 
vanometer deflection of loo scale divisions. The galvanometer sensi- 
tiveness was carefully tested at the l)eginning and end of each even- 
ing's work. All observations of pressure were thus reduced to the 
pressure due to a beam of fixed intensity. 

At each series of radiation pressui-e measurements two sets of 
observations were made. In one of these sets static conditions were 
observed, and in the other the deflections of the balance due to short 



124 THE PRESSURE DUE TO RADIATION. 

exposures were measured. In the static observations each vane of the 
bahmce was exposed in turn to the beam from the lamp, the exposiu'es 
lasting" until tiie turning- points of the swing's showed that stationary 
conditions had l)een reached. The moment of pressure of radiation 
and gas action combined would thus be equal to the product of the 
static deflection and the constant of the balance. The torsion S3^stem 
was then turned through ISO- by rotating the outside magnet, and 
similar observations were made on the reverse side of the vanes. All 
turning points of the swinging balance in these observations were 
recorded. From the data thus obtained the resultant of the combined 
radiation and gas forces could be determined for the time of ever}^ 
turning point. Every value was divided by the deflection at standard 
sensitiveness of the g-alvanometer G„ read at the same time, and was 
thus reduced to standard lamp. Results thus obtained, together with 
the ballistic measurements, show^ed the direction and extent of the gas 
action as well as its variation with length of exposure. 

The reasons for reversing the suspension follow: The ])eam from 
the lamp, before reaching the balance, passed through three thick 
glass lenses and two glass plates. All wave lengths destructiveh" 
absorbed by the glass were thus sifted out of the beam by the time 
it reached the balance, vanes. The silver coatings on the vanes 
absor])ed, therefore, more than the glass. The radiation pressure was 
always away from the source, irrespective of the way the vanes were 
turned, while the gas action would be exerted mainly on the silvered 
sides of the vanes. 

At the close of the pressure and energy measurements, when the 
reflecting power of the silver faces of the vanes was compared with 
that of the glass-silver faces, the reflection from the silver faces was 
found very nmch higher than that for the glass faces backed ])y silver. 
This result was the more surprising because the absorption of the 
unsilvered vanes was found b}' measurement to be negligil)l3" small." 
This unexpected difi'erence in reflecting power of the two faces of the 
mirrors prevented the elimination of the gas action, by the method 
descril)ed, from being as complete as had been hoped for. But by 
choosing a gas pressure where the gas action after long exposure is 
small, the whole gas efl'ect during the time of a l)allistic exposure may 
be so reduced as to be of little consequence in any case. 

By exposing each of the vanes in turn and b}' reversing the suspen- 
sion and averaging results, nearly all errors due to lack of symmetry 
in the l)alance or in the position of the light images with reference to 
the rotation axis, or errors due to lack of uniformit}" in the distribu- 
tion of intensity in different parts of the image, could l)e eliminated.

and glass-silver surfaces. Scientific paj^ers, Cambridge, 2, 538-539, 1900.

The chang-ing- character of the ga,s action, both with time of exposure 
and gas pressure surrounding the bahmce vanes, is well illustrated

through tlic diagTam gives the ineaii value of the moment of radiation 
pressure computed from the data in Tal)le I. Decrease of the deflec- 
tion with time indicates gas repulsion on the warmed silver faces and 
increase in deflection gas suction. It will be seen from the curves 
that beginning at a gas pressure of 66 mm. of mercury, the gas action 
was repulsion changing to suction in passing from 19.8 to 11.2 mm. 
In the last two cases the total gas action is small. For lower pressures 
the suction increases to 0.05 mm. At a gas pressure of 0.02 nun. the 
gas action is again a strong repulsion. 

The curves indicate the existence of two gas pressures, at which the 
gas action in our arrangement of apparatus should l)e zero, one 
between iU.S and 11.2 mm. and the other between 0.05 and 0.02 nmi." 
The former region was chosen for the l)allistic measurements and 
nearly all of the ol)servations were made at a gas pressure of approxi- 
mately 1<> nnn. Even for the two pressures where the decrease in the 
static deflection was most rapid, i. e.. at gas pressures of 66 and 0.02 
mm., the tirst throw was always in the direction of radiation pressure. 
The gas action is strongh^ influenc(»d ])y very slight changes in the 
inclination of th(^ plane of the A'anes to the vertical and also by an}' 
object introduced under the bell jar anywhere near the vanes. For 
instance, a very considerable efl^ect was observed when a small vessel 
of phosphoric anhydride was placed under the jar behind the vanes, 
though the nearest wall of the vessel was separated from the vanes by 
a distance of at least 8 cm. 

During the ()l)servations. the polished silver coatings on the vanes 
deteriorated rapidl}*; new coatings rarely lasted for more than two 
evenings' work. As the balance had to >)e removed and the mirrors 
taken fi-om the hooks, silvered, polished, and replaced a great numl)er 
of time.s during the entire series of measurements, although great care 
was taken in setting the plane of the vanes vertical, it is not likely 
that pr(»cisely the same conditions for gas action were ever repeated. 
The pi'incipal value of the static results was in indicating favora))le 
gas pressures for work, rather than afli'ording quantitative estimates of 
the gas action in short exposures. The dotted parts of the curves are 
not based on results of observation and might perhaps have been 
omitted without loss. 

It was plain, therefore, that further elimination of the gas action 
must be sought in exposures so short that the gas action would not 
have time to reach more than a small fraction of its stationary value. 
This led to the method of ballistic observations. ^ , 

"Crookesjiu his Avork witli the radiometer discovered certain gas pressures for 
which the combined gas and radiation forces neutralized, but as he did not discrimi- 
nate between forces (hie to radiation and gas forces his results were apparently 
capricious and his reasoning somewhat confused. See Phil. Trans., p. 519, 1875. 



THE PRESSURE DUE TO RADIATION. 127 

THE BALLISTIC OBSERVATIONS. 

In passing' from the static to the ballistic observations it mitst 
alwa^'s be possible to compute the static equivalent of the ballistic 
swings. Furthermore, the exposures should be made as short as pos- 
sible without reducing the size of the swing below a value which can 
))e accurateh" measured. 

If the exposure lasts for one-half the period of the balance, the 
deflection, if the gas action he small, and the damping' zero, is equal 
to 26* where B is the angle at which the torsion of the fiber will 
balance the moment produced by the radiation pressure. If the dura- 
tion of the exposure be one-quarter of the period of the balance, the 
angle of deflection is & s/~- The deflection is thus reduced b}' 30 per 
cent, but the effect of the gas action is reduced in greater porportion. 
It was decided, therefore, to expose for six seconds, one-fourth of 
the balance period. Neglecting the gas action, but taking account of

THE ENERGY MEASUREMENTS. 

The radiant intensity of the beam used in the experiments was deter- 
mined l)y directing- it upon the blackened face of a silver disk, weigh- 
ino- -t.SO grams, of 13.3 mm. diameter, and of 3. 58 mm. thickness, and 
by measuring its rate of temperature rise as it passed through the 
temperature of its surroundings. The disk was obtained from Messrs. 
Tiffany & Co., and was said by them to l)e 99.8 per cent line silver. 
Two holes were bored through parallel diameters of the disk, one- 
fourth of the thickness of the disk fi'om either face. Two iron con- 
stantan thermojunctions. made l)y soldering 0.1 mm. wires of the two 

metals, were drawn through 
the holes into the center of the 
disk. To insulate the wires 
from the disk, tine drawn- 
glass tubes were slipped 
over them and thrust into 
the holes, leaving less than 2 
nun. bare wire on either side 
of the junctions. The wires 
were sealed into the tubes 
and the tubes into the disk 
by solid shellac. The tubes 
projected 15 mm. oi* more 
from the disk and were bent 
upward in planes parallel to 
the faces of the disk. The 
general arrangement will lie 
seen in tig. 5. The disk was 
suspended l)y the four wires 
some distance below a small 
flat wooden box. On the l)ox 
was fastened a calorimeter 
can swathed in cotton and 
tilled with kerosene in which

tions were nnmersed. Cop- 
per wires soldered to the two ends of the thermoelectric series were 
brought out of the calorimeter, and the circuit was closed through 
1,000 ohms in series with the 500 ohms resistance of galvanometer Gj. 
The thermojunctions in the disk were in series, and as each junction 
was midway betw^een the central plane of the disk and either face, it 
was assumed that when the disk was slowly warmed by heating one 
face the electromotive forces obtained corresponded to the mean tem- 
perature of the disk. One face of the disk was blackened by spray- 
ing it with powdered lampblack in alcohol containing a trace of shellac.

THE PRESSURE DUE TO RADIATION. 129 

This method was suggested bj^ Prof. (1. E. Hale and gives very fine 
and uniform dead-blaek coatings not inferior to good smoke deposits. 

For the energy measurements the Ijell jar and the torsion l)ahince 
were removed from the platform P (fig. 1) and a double-walled cop- 
per vessel AB (fig. 5), which served as a water jacket surrounding a 
small air chamber C, was mounted in the same place. A tul^e 2 cm. in 
diameter was soldered into the front face of the jacket to admit the light 
beam into the chamber C. This opening was covered by a piece of plate 
glass similar to the plates forming the larger windows in the bell jar. 

The needle system in G^, a four-coil du Bois-Rubens galvanometer, 
was suspended in a strong magnetic field so that its period was about 
four seconds. The system was heavily damped by a mica air fan of 
large surface. The'disk junctions and galvanometer responded quickly 
to the radiation, as was shown by the reversal of motion of the magnet 
system 1.2 seconds after the light was cut ofl' from the disk, wh(>n the 
latter was a few degrees above the temperature of the room. 

The disk was calibrated for temperature in terms of the deflection 
for a definite sensitiveness of the galvanometer G^. * * * 

The mean of two separate calibrations taken several days apart was 
9.96 scale divisions for one degree temperature difference. 

Before beginning a series of intensitv measurements the disk was 
suspended in an air chamber containing phosphoric anhydride and sur- 
rounded by a jacket of ice and salt. The disk was thus lowered to a 
temperature of about zero degrees and was then quickly transferred 
to the chamber C (fig. 5), and the beam was directed upon it. When 
its temperature had risen to within 5 or 6 degrees of that of the cham- 
ber C, galvanometer readings were made at intervals of five seconds 
until the disk was heated to a temperature several degrees above its 
surroundings. The temperature of the chamber C was determined b}^ 
removing the disk and cooling it to a point near the room tempera- 
ture, then replacing it and observing its rate of temperature change 
for several minutes. 

Energy series were made " through air," "through red glass," and 
"through water cell," as in the pressure measurements. During the 
experiment the black coatings were frequently cleaned ofl' from the 
disk and new ones deposited. The final result therefore does not 
correspond to an individual but to an average coating. 

To correct for any inequality between the two disk thermoj unctions 
or any lack of symmetry in their positions, referred to the central 
plane of the disk, which might prevent the mean temperature of the two 
junctions from representing the mean temperature of the mass, series of 
observations were made on each face of the disks. The black coating 
was always cleaned off from the face of the disk away from the light," 

« In the original paper here follow detailed results of 82 energy measurements 
through air, water, and red glass, some on one face of the disk and some on the 
other. 



130 THE PKESSURE DUE TO RADIATION. 

As the general result of all the energy ineasurement.s it was found 
that the rise in temperature of the silver disk per second when the 
light passed:" 

((0 through air=(0°.0970=h0°.00034) C; 

(h) through red glass-=(0°.0946±0°.00036) C; 

(c) through water cell = (0°.0884±0°. 00064) C. 

The mass of the silver disk was 4.80 grams, its specific heat^' at 18° 
C. =0.0556; the mechanical equivalent of heat at 18° C. =4.272X10' 
ergs.'' Consequentl}^ the energy of the standard radiation is 

{(i) through air, 0.0970 X 4.80 X 0.0556 X 4.272 X 10' 

or Ea = (1.108 d= 0.004) X 10" ergs per second. 
(/>) through red glass, Eg = (1.078 ± 0.004) X 10*^ ergs per second. 
{(■) through water cell, E„, = (1.008 ±0.007) X 10^ ergs per second. 

REFLECTING POWER OF THE SURFACES USED. 

According to ^Maxwell and Bartoli. the pressure in d^mes per square 
centimeter for normal incidence is Qqual to the energy in ergs in unit 
volume of the medium. The energy in unit volume is made up' of 
both the direct and reflected beams. If E is the intensity of the inci- 
dent ))eam and p the reflection coefficient, the pressure^? = — ^^ ^, 

where V is the velocity of light. The methods for measuring p and 
E have already been described. The determination of p for ])<)th 
sides of the vanes C and D was made l)y means of a bolometer,'' 

In all, three series of measurements were made on the silver and 
two series on the glass-silver faces of each vane. To get average 
coefficients which would represent the range of condition of the mir- 
rors during the pressure measurements, the vanes were cleaned and 
new silver coatings deposited between each two series on the same 
vane. The reflection coefficients are as follows:

The diffuse reflection of black coatings deposited by the method

determinations of this reflection were made under different conditions

and with different coatings. The values in percentages of the incident 
beam averaged 4.6 per cent. Thus only 95 A per cent of the incident 
beam was absorbed b}^ the black coating on the silver disk in produc- 
ing the temperature increase observed. Hence the true energy of the 
beam is equal to the observed energy divided by 0.954. 

The silver disk, diameter 13.3 mm., used in the energy measure- 
ments, received long waves and scattered radiation which passed round 
and through the light-pressure vanes of diameter 12.8 mm. This 
amount was experimentally determined for both thin and thick silver 
coatings in order to approximate to the average condition of the coat- 
ings in the light-pressure measurements, and it was found to average 
(a) through air, 1.40 per cent; {h) through red glass, 1.44 per cent; 
{{') through water, 0.46 per cent. On this account the energ}^ E of 
the standard radiation must be reduced by the above percentages."

"The pressure and fucrgy measurements for the three different wave groups through air, red glass, 
and water cell constitute three independent experiments. The values for yiressure. 7.01, (i. 91, and 
^52 in the three cases are only accidentally related. The difference arises from tlie different reflect- 
ing power of the 4.5° glass plate (tig. 2) for the different beams and from the fact that the nnlieations 
of the lamp galvanometer G.) connected with bolometer R were probably not strictly proportional to 
energy for throws differing as widely as 33, (50, and 100, which, roughly, were the relative intensities 
of the beams through water cell, red glass, and air. The function of the lamp bolometer and galva- 
nometer was purely to keep a check on the small variations of the lamp, which rarely fluctuated more 
than 10 per cent on either .side of the mean value. 

An estimate of the approximate magnitude of the gas action not 
eliminated by the ballistic method of observation [of which details 
appear in the original paper] shows that the uneliminated gas action, 
b}^ the most liberal estimate, can not have exceeded 1 per cent of the 
radiation pressure. Because of its smallhess and indeliniteness no 
correction for gas action has been made to the final pressure values. 
If corrections were applied, its effect would be to reduce slightly the 
observed pressures. 

From the agreement within the probable errors of the air, red glass, 
and w^ater values with the theory it appears that radiation pressure 
depends onh^ upon the intensity of the radiation and is independent 
of the wave length. 

Tlic Maxwell-Bartoli theory is thus (luantitatively confirmed within 
the probable errors of observation.

(' As the average pitch of the cone of the incident beam was about 1 part in 40, no 
correction need be appUed for inclination. Furthermore, the inside of the bell jar 
was blackened and the zero of the balance was so chosen that energy reflected from 
the window admitting the beam conld produce no pressure effects. 



132 THE PRESSUEE DTTE TO RADIATION". 

THE APPLICATION OF RADIATION PRESSURE TO COMETARY THEORY. 

In the experiments described in the foregoing paper the close agree- 
ment of theory with experiment warrants the rigid application of the 
radiation-pressure theor}^ in the explanation of cosmical phenomena. 

In any balancing of radiation pressure against gravitation in comets 
the size of particles is the determining factor. The repulsion due to 
radiation pressure depends upon the intensity of the rays, the al^sorb- 
ing and reflecting power of the surface, and the cross section of the 
body exposed. Gravitational attraction depends only upon mass, 
or the product of volume and density. It will be seen, therefore, that 
for spheres of a given substance the weight at a lixed distance from 
the sun will vary with the cube of the radius, while radiation pressure 
will depend upon the radius squared. The ratio of pressure to weight 
will thus be inversely as the radius. This relation holds down to the 
point where the particles become so small that they begin to lose in 
absorbing and reflecting power through diffraction. 

The intensity' of the solar radiation and gravitation diminish with 
distance in accordance with the .same law, so that the ratio of pressure 
to weight is a constant for the same body at all distances from the ,sun. 

For spheres of the same size, and the same absorbing and reflecting 
power, the ratio of pressure to gravitation is inversely as the density. 
The variation of this ratio, as it depends upon size and density, hae* 
been used by Lebedew" and Arrhenius'' in the computation of the 
repulsion upon the finely divided matter of comets' tails, but the lim- 
iting value of the ratio for diminishing spheres of the same density 
due to diffraction first appears in Schwarzschild's paper. ^ 

Cornet hr<ids. — In the heads of comets the phenomena are most com- 
plicated and ditficult of explanation, yet it seems worth while to try 
to gather together a few of the separate causes which may be at work 
in producing this intricate structure. 

The heat received from the sun })y the nucleus of a comet may be 
spent in three ways: (1) In raising the temperature of the nucleus. 
As the nucleus is of relatively small mass and probably of low heat 
conductivity no verv considerable quantity of heat is required for this 
purpose. (2) Heat may l)e, and doubtless is, used in the vaporization 
of volatile hydrocarbons and other substances in the nucleus. (3) Large 
quantities of heat are lost from the nucleus by radiation. 

The porous structure of meteorites points to a similar structure in 
cometary nuclei. The jets from the nucleus outward to the envelope 
of the head may l)e formed by the heating of the vaporizal)le materials

THE PRESSURE DUE TO RADIATIOIST. 133 

in the interior of the nucleus and the consequent shooting out under 
pressure of a mixture of gases and dust through holes in a loose outer 
crust. Lack of sufficient means of escape in this way may cause a 
bursting of the nucleus sometimes observed. 

The general upward current of vapors from the nucleus to the envel- 
ope, aside from jets, may be due to convection away from the more 
strongly heated center. '^ 

Because of the counter-pressure due to the radiation of the nucleus 
itself, the rising of even small solid particles from the nucleus to the 
envelope would not encounter as strong an unbalanced pressure from 
the solar rays as particles in the tail. For, if all the heat received 
from the sun were again radiated from the nucleus on the side toward 
the sun, these two counter-radiation pressures would exactly balance 
at the surface of the nucleus. * 

Small particles ma}^ also be aided in rising from the nucleus toward 
the sun by gas forces. By numerous experiments on larger bodies 
immersed in a gas and illuminated on one side, it has been shown that 
they may be either repelled from the light source or drawn to it, 
depending upon the pressure of the surrounding gas. (See curves, in 
the foregoing paper, fig. 4.) If the gas pressure is not too low, par- 
ticles after leaving the nucleus might first be drawn toward the sun 
until a region of higher vacuum was reached in the ascent, and then 
be repelled.'' 

The brilliant envelope of the head may be regarded as forming at 
the height where condensation, caused by expansion and cooling, takes 
place. Here the repelling action of the solar radiation Avould reach a 
high value and the particles in the envelope would be driven backward 
to form the tail. 

According to Arrhenius'' this condensation in the envelope is assisted 

« Matter in the form of gases and vapors is not subject to radiation pressure, as 
solid and li<inid particles are, because of the minuteness of molecular dimensions. 
Except in the spectrum regions of characteristic absori^tion, radiation can, theoreti- 
cally, exert no pressure whatever upon a gas. Hence gases might rise from the 
nucleus toward the sun practically unhindered by radiation pressure. 

''It is worth noting in this connection that the longer and invisible waves are as 
effective in producing pressure as the visible radiations, and that these long waves 
strongly preponderate in the spectra of solid bodies at temperatures low in com- 
parison with the solar temperature. 

c It is possible also that electrostatic forces may play a small part in the forma- 
tion of the head from the nucleus. Arrhenius believes the sun to have a positive 
electrical charge, due to the fact that it loses more negative electrons by condensation 
into nuclei and subsequent rei)ulsion by radiation pressure than it does of positive 
electrons which do not as readily serve as centers of condensation. Streams of nega- 
tively charged particles would communicate a negative charge to the matter surround- 
ing the comet's nucleus, which would thus be attracted by the sun. As this attrac- 
tion would oi)pose the formation of the tail in the same measure as it assisted that of 
the head, it can not be a dominating inHueiice. 

rfL.c, p. 208. 



134 THE PRESSURE DUE TO RADIATION. 

by the influx of negatively charged nuclei from the sun, which serve 
as condensation centers for the ascending vapors. The height above 
the nucleus of the comet at which this condensation would occur would 
thus, in some measure, be governed by the supply of negative paiti- 
€les. These would be found in increasing numbers with diminishing 
distance from the sun. This action may be responsible for the contrac- 
tion of the head and envelope as comets approach the sun. 

The brilliancy of the envelope may l)e attributed in large part to 
the fact that bodies of sufficient size to reflect solar ravs are first 
formed out of the vapors of the head in this region. The negative 
nuclei from the sun would here experience an obstruction and lose the 
greater part of their motion b}^ friction. P^lectrical interchanges and 
discharges would be more active, and the hvdrocarbon spectrum be 
brighter in tlie envelope than in other parts of the head. 

If the brightness of the head and its envelope depend upon the 
number of negatively charged nuclei which strike the comet, and if, 
as Arrhenius maintains, the nuclei move out from the sun radiallj^and 
in greatest numbers from regions of greater solar activity, comets 
crossing the surface defined by solar radii drawn through the sun-spot 
belts should show a marked increase in brightness, especially in maxi- 
mum sun spot years. The writers are not aware that any such 
influence has been looked for in the cases where sudden changes of 
briglitness in comets have been observed. 

Comet tails. — The maximum ratio of radiation pressure to gravita- 
tion, obtained theoretically h\ Schwarzschild for sunlight upon opaque 
reflecting spheres of 0.8 density, under the most favorable conditions, 
was about 20 to 1, if the recent estimates (ranging from 3.5 to 4) of 
the solar constant were used. 

In Bredichin's three types of cometary tails the highest ratio of 
attraction to repulsion required is about 18 to 1. The multiple tails 
observed in such comets as Donati's ma}^ thus be satisfactorily 
explained by the sifting action of radiation pressure in two ways — 
either by assuming, with Bredichin, that the particles in the different 
tails are of different densities, but of uniform size, or hy assuming 
uniform density and particles of several different sizes. 

While radiation pressure alone ma}' thus afford a satisfactory expla- 
nation of comets' tails, there is no reason to assume that it is the only 
cause of the repulsive action observed. There are several ways in 
which the gases and vapors present in the tail may exert a force upon 
the small solid or liquid particles which are known to exist there: 

1. Small particles, if warmed on one side when surrounded by gases 
or vapors, even under pressures so low that electrical discharges take 
place only under relativeh" high voltages, experience a strong repul- 
sion, similar to that upon a vane of a Crookes radiometer. 



THE peesshee due to eadiation. 135 

2. Occluded gases or volatile materials upon the surface of the par- 
ticles would be driven off by the sun's heat on the illuminated sides, 
and the particles would thus receive a thrust in the direction away 
from the sim, 

3. If the particles were porous or loosely put together, containing 
cavities filled with more easily vaporizable substances, the resulting 
\apors would be shot out upon the hotter sides and the particles 
driven back by a kind of rocket action. 

That these combined gas forces are still large, even in high vacua, 
will be seen from an actual experiment described later. 

If we accept Ari:lienius"'s theory that the solar activity produces 
numberless negative electrons which serve as condensation points for 
the vapors surrounding them in the solar atmosphere, and thus form 
small, negatively charged nuclei, which are driven from the sun by 
radiation pressure,'* these nuclei would exert a battering action upon 
the particles of the tail. In the last case a strange meeting point is 
found between the oldest, or Keplerian, and the latest explanation of 
the solar repulsion of comets' tails. 

Finally Prof. J. J, Thomson,'' in investigating the action of electric 
waves upon charged bodies immersed in the medium, has found that 
a small repulsive effect may arise from this cause. This repulsive 
force is entirely distinct from the radiation pressure so far considered, 
but on the electro-magnetic theory of light it ma}^ be competent to 
drive awa}^ electrons formed above the photosphere of the sun, inde- 
pendenth^ of the sign of the charge and of whether they have formed 
nuclei by condensation or not. 

These last two causes of repulsion are in all probability of very 
minor importance when compared with radiation pressure, or even 
with gas action. 

Experiment with a Jahoratory coinefs tall. — Some of the above con- 
siderations led the writers to try to reproduce, as nearly as possible, 
in a vacuum tube some of the conditions believed to exist in comets' 
tails. The result of a hasty computation of the magnitude of the 
effect which might be expected from radiation pressure provided a 
suitable dust could be found was most encouraging. 

At the outset it was apparent that it would be very difficult to man- 
ufacture a powder the grains of which would be sufficiently small, 
light, and uniform for the purpose; so the spores of a great ^•ariet3^ of 
degraded vegetable forms were examined. Finally a puffball of the 
genus L[ic()p)erdon was discovered, the spores of which averaged 2 
microns in diameter, and were as nearly spherical and uniform in size 

« The supposed electrical discharges in the tail of a comet which give rise to its 
gaseous emission spectrum are attributed by Arriienius to the electrical disturbances 
caused by the influx of these negative nuclei.

as a pile of apples from the same tree. These spores were light, cel- 
lular structures, tilled mainly with oil. They were calcined by heat- 
ing to redness and all the vaporizable material driven off, leaving only 
sponge-like charcoal spheres behind. The densit}^ of a mass of these 
spheres (individuals could obviously not be dealt with) was measured 
and found to be about one-tenth that of water. Making liberal allow- 
ances for the spaces between spheres in the pile, the density of a sin- 
gle sphere could not exceed 0.15." 

These spores, together with a quantity of emery sand, were placed 
in a glass tube the form of which was suggested b}^ the hourglass. 
A Smaller tubes led off from either 

end. One of these was fused to a 
good mercury pump of the Geissler 
t3'pe, the other ])ent down and joined 
to a small flask containing mercury. 
All of the tubes were wrapped with 
wire giiuze and heated to a tempera- 
ture just below the softening point 
of glass, and the pump was worked 
man}' hours. W hen the pump showed 
no further signs of gas the mercury 
in the flask was boiled and mercury 
vapor driven through the tubes to 
carry off any permanent gases which 
the pump alone could not reach. 
After this had continued for an hour 
or more the tube system was sealed 
ofl' from the pump and the mercury 
flask was surrounded b}' solid carbon 
dioxide and ether, and the hourglass 
still heated. In this wa}' all of the 
mercury vapor which could be con- 
densed at a temperature of — 80° C. 
was drawn out of the tubes. After 
^i«i- nearly an hour the mercury flask 

with its frozen contents was sealed off from the hourglass. 

The hourglass was then held in a vertical position and a beam of 
light of approximately known intensity was directed horizontallv on 
the lower half of the tube just below the neck, fig. 1. By tapping the 
tube a fine stream of sand and charcoal puffball spores descended. 
The sand particles fell through the beam, showing no deflection, but 
the sj^ores were driven from the stream sidewise in passing th(^ beam. 

^According to Schwarzschild's formula, the ratio of radiation pressure to solar 
gravitation for spheres of the size and density of these spores would he about 6 to 1. 



THE PEESSUKE DUE TO KADIATION. 137 

The observed angle of deflection of the spores from the vertical was 
roughly that given from the computation, and the observers believed 
that the efi'ects shown must be due almost entirely to light pressure, 
with possibly a slight gas action. The action of gases upon heated 
bodies of this size had, so far as we know, never been studied, but 
one of the writers" had studied the gas action on larger bodies down 
to a pressure of permanent gases of 0.0005 mm. of mercury, as shown 
by a McCleod gauge, and had observed that for this pressure the gas 
action had begun to fall off sharply. The pressure of the permanent 
gases in the hourglass must have been well below this value, and it 
was thought that nearly all pressure due to vapor had been frozen out. 

Later, a review of the preliminary computation was made and an 
error discovered which had the effect of bringing out the computed 
light pressure on bodies of this size and densit}' far too large. It was 
plain, therefore, that the force of deflection due to gas action, proba- 
bly of the character of rocket action, was at least ten times as large as 
the effect attributable to radiation pressure. Radiation pressure 
alone would produce a measurable effect under the conditions of 
observation, but would have been far less pronounced than the effect 
obtained. 

The experiment had unfortunately to be tried under circumstances 
nuK'h more unfavorable for a pronounced effect of radiation pressure 
than exists in comets, for the deflection produced by repulsion must 
be measured in terms of terrestrial gravitation, which is over 1,600 
times as great as solar gravitation at the distance of the earth. To 
approach cometary conditions, therefore, it would have been necessary 
to use a light beam 1,600 times as intense as sunlight at the earth. 
In the experiment, beams from twenty to forty times as intense as 
sunlight were used. 

Because of the meagerness of present knowledge concerning the 
actual conditions in comets' tails it is im23ossible to say how closely 
the foregoing experiment fulfilled the purpose for which it was tried. 
It would be difficult to prove from present astronomical data that the 
hydrocarbon vapors know^n to exist in comets' tails exert no radio- 
metric repulsion upon the small reflecting particles present. Still 
more difficult w^ould it be to show that nothing which corresponds to 
what has been called rocket action occurs. This latter repulsion does 
not require the presence of any generally diffused atmosphere what- 
ever, but simply that the particles send off gases toward the sun under 
the action of the sun's heat. Thus, in passing from the era where no 
adequate physical causes which would meet the required conditions

THE SUN-SPOT PERIOD AND THE VARIATIONS OF THE 
MEAN ANNUAL TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH/' 



By Cn. NoRDMANN, Docteur us sciences, 
Astronome a V Ohservatoire de Nice. 



It has lono- been sought to discover if the various meteorolog-ical 
phenomena of the earth, and particularly the temperature, are subject 
to periodic variations other than the diurnal and annual periods depend- 
ing on the rotation of the earth and its motion in the ecliptic. The 
astrologers of the middle ages, who ali'ected to discern a relationship 
between the great climatological changes of the globe and the con- 
figuration of the sun and planets, and who based predictions upon such 
phenomena, ma}' be considered perhaps as the pioneers in this line 
of stud3\ 

During the eighteenth and the lirst half of the nineteenth centuries 
men of science made numerous attempts to determine if meteorological 
phenomena were dependent on the relative positions of the sun and 
moon, and if consequently they could ])e associated with the various 
periods common between these heavenly bodies, such as the Draconic 
period, the Saros, and the period of nodes. These studies were influ- 
enced by a long-standing and still prevalent belief, profoundly fixed 
in the popular mind, that the moon exercises a preponderating 
influence upon terrestrial climates. 

More modern and exact investigations have thoroughly tested this 
traditional belief, and while it is shown that the moon actually appears 
to produce tides in the higher regions of our atmosphere analogous to 
those of the ocean, it is on the other hand established that our satellite 
exercises no appreciable influence upon the temperature or climate of 
the earth, and investigations along these lines have been at length 
abandoned. 

I. 

The inquir}' was brought upon a new field when, in 1852, Sabine, 
Wolf, and Gautier discovered that the phenomena of terrestrial mag- 
netism were subject to variations of a period equal to that of the 
sun spots. A little later Fritz discovered the same period in the 
manifestations of the aurora borealis. Thenceforth it was natural to 
inquire if all the other meteorological phenomena were not.equall}^ 
subjected to the influences of sun spots. (We do not speak here of 
more or less serious attempts which have been made from time to time

to lind relations between sun spots and the appearance of Asiatic 
cholera, famines, or commercial crises.)" 

So far as concerns climatology almost the only result certainly 
established thus far, outside the question of temperature, is that 
derived by Meldrum,^ director of the observatory on the island of 
Mauritius, who found the mean annual rainfall of the earth slig-htly 
greater in years of maxima than in those of minima of sun spots. The 
causes of this variation in rainfall are not yet understood, but I may 
incidentally remark that the views I have myself advanced in relation 
to the aurora borealis^ may afford a simple explanation, for I have 
shown that during years of maximum sun spot frequency the Hertzian 
waves emanating from the sun induce the formation of the cathode 
raj's of the aurora Ijorealis more abundantly than in years of minimum 
sun spots. On the other hand, it is known that the propagation of 
cathode rays is favorable to the condensation of vapor; thus it follows 
that water vapor within the atmosphere, other conditions being equal, 
would condense more abundantly in the form of I'ain during years of 
maxima of sun spots, as found by Meldrum. 

The idea that the sun spots should have some intiuence on terrestrial 
temperatures is very old. This view was advanced by Riccioli in 1651, 
shortly after the discovery of sun spots, but so little was known of the 
nature and magnitude of their influence down to recent times that in 
187:^ Wolf was still able to write: "The relation which Herschel sup- 
posed to exist between sun spots and the mean temperature of the 
earth is still in question."'' It might seem at first sight strange that 
while the connection between the sun-spot period and terrestrial mag- 
netism and aurora was established almost as soon as the question began 
to be investigated, the exact influence of sun spots on the temperature 
of the earth, although long suspected, had not been determined even 
as late as 1872. There are two kinds of causes contributing to this: 

First. While the eleven-^^ear variations of the Aurora Borealis and 
of the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism are so great as to be readily 
discernible in the amplitude of the phenomena in question, the effect 
on temperature is only a fraction of a degree centigrade, as we shall 
presently show, and thus of an order below that of the accidental and 
local variations of temperature. 

Second. The researches published on this subject prior to 1872 gave 
but uncertain and contradictor}^ results, because the authors did not 

«This last idea is not perhaps absurd, for it is certain that if the sun spots really 
exercise a sensible influence upen terrestrial meteorology, they may indirectly influ- 
ence harvests, as had been suggested by the great Herschel. But the price of grain 
depends quite as much, or even more, on political and social circumstances as upon 
meteorology.

in general emplo}' data other than those g-iven hj a single station, 
instead of emploj'ing the onlj' rational method which could distinguish 
a general influence of solar origin from causes purely local and tem- 
porary, nameh^, the study of the contemporaneous records of numer- 
ous stations. Furthermore, the authors did not employ a sufficiently 
long period of observations, for these ought at the very least to extend 
over a complete sun-spot C3'cle. Some writers even ventured to draw 
conclusions from the observations continued only a few months at a 
single station. rinall3% for the most part these earl}- investigators 
studied the records of stations in the temperate zones, where, as 
Koppen has shown, the local and accidental variations are so great as 
to mask completely such minute changes of mean temperature as are 
here in question. 

In 18T3 there appeared the well-known memoir of Koppen, who 
concluded, from an able discussion of the thermometric observations at 
numerous stations during the period from 1820 to 1870, that the pres- 
ence o| sun spots was attended by a slight diminution of the terres- 
trial temperature." Since the appearance of this memoir, which 
constituted the first trustworthy results reached in this direction, no 
extended work on the subject has been published. 

II. 

Encouraged by the friendh' counsel of M. H. Poincare, I have 
undertaken to continue the study of this important subject for the 
period 1870 to 1900, for it seemed to me very desirable to throw addi- 
tional light, if possible, upon a point so important to ph3'sical astron- 
omy and the physics of the earth. 

The work of Koppen esta1)lished that the curve of variation of mean 
annual temperature is reasonably regular only for tropical stations, 
and that in the regions exterior to the Tropics the curve of variation 
becomes so irregular that it is impossible to recognize in it any perio- 
dicity whatever. This result was perhaps to be expected, for the 
tropical regions are characterized by a very even climate, whereas 
for stations nearer the poles the accidental variations of temperature 
are very great, and indeed enormousl}' greater than the slight varia- 
tion of temperature which will be found below to attend the sunspot 
c^xle. 

Accordingly 1 have made use of thermometric o])servations from 
tropical stations exclusively in this study, but since the meteorological 
observations of the past thirty years have been greatly extended and 
sj^stematized, I have been able to employ material nuich more exten- 
sive and trustworthy than was at Koppen's disposal. Thus the series 
of observations for separate stations are generally longer than he

emploj^ed, so that while he was occasionally obliged to use series of 
no more extent than six years of observation, which could not fail to 
be a serious source of error, I have retained no series shorter than 
eleven years, corresponding to the mean period of the complete sun 
spot cycle. Furthermore, while Koppen had no observations from 
stations outside the Indies, the Antilles, and tropical America, I have 
been able to employ data from a greater number of stations, distrib- 
uted more thoroughly over the globe, so that the result obtained can 
be considered as really representing the mean state of all that portion 
of the earth comprised within the Tropics. The stations for which I 
have used all the observations published since 1870 are: 

Sierra Leone, Recife (or Pernambuco), Port au Prince, Trinitd, 
ffamaica, Habana, Manila, Hongkong, Zi Ka Wei, Batavia, Bombay, 
Island of Rodriguez; Island of Mauritius. 

For each station there has been computed the deviation of the moan 
temperature of each year from the general mean for a great number 
of years. Then for each year from 1870 to 11)00 the general mean of 
the deviations of all the stations was obtained. 

The following table contains the results thus derived. In the col- 
unin headed '' Sun spots," will be found for each year the relative 
number of sun spots according to Wolf; and the column headed 
"Deviations," gives in degrees centigrade the mean departure in tem- 
perature for all the stations as obtained in the following manner: 

If aj represent the arithmetical mean of the deviations of tempera- 
ture at all stations for a given year, a^ that for the ^^ear preceding, 
and a2 that for the 3'ear following, the number found in the column 
headed " Deviations " corresponding to the 3'ear in c^uestion is equal to 

a„+2ai+a2 



These numbers have ])een emplo3'ed rather than the direct arith- 
metical mean for the given year, in order to give a more regular 
series b}" eliminating as well as possible the secondary irregularities.

Fig. 1.— Comparison of sun spots and mean temperatures. 

The following more careful discussion goes to show' that their simi- 
larity extends even to minor details: 

1. If we consider the dates of maxima and minima of temperature 
and sun spots, respectivel}', as found in the two curves, we may express 
the results in the form of a table as follows: 

Table II. — Maxima and minima of sun spots and temperatures.

This comparison shows that the agreement between the times of 
minima of temperature and maxima of sun spots on the one hand 
and between maxima of temperature and minima of sun spots on the 
other is very satisfactoiy. 

2. It is well known that the interval between a minimum of sun 
spots and the succeeding maximum is usually shorter than the inter- 
val between a maximum and the following mininmm. The 2i sun-spot

periods from 1870 to 1900 were not exceptions to this rule, and it will 
be noted that the 2^ corresponding- temperature periods also conform 
to it, as appears in Table III.

For both sun spots and temperatures we find: 
Interval 2-3 less than 3-4, and 4-5 less than 5-6. 

Moreover, for both temperatures and sun spots the intervals 2-3 and 

4-5 are smaller than an}^ of the intervals 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6, despite 

the inequality of the total periods embraced in the two and one-half 
cycles considered. These include the half period of eight years (1870 
to 1878), a full period of eleven years (1878 to 1889), and a second full 
period of twelve years (1889 to 1901). 

3. Again, designating as "rich in sun spots'' tlie years for which 
the Wolf relative numbers exceed 60, and as "■ poor in sun spots "' those 
years in which they fall below 15, we may form the following table, in 
which the temperature variations are divided between the classes so 
defined:

This comparison also exhibits a satisfactory accord between the two 
kinds of phenomena. 

4. Let us now consider the years of maxima and minima of sun 
spots, and for each of these years calculate a ''smoothed'"' sun spot 
number by taking the mean between the number for the given year 
and the half sum of the numbers for the years next preceding and 
next following, respectively. We proceed similarly with the temper- 
ature deviations, thus treating both kinds of data in a way to eliminate 
secondary influences, while leaving a preponderating importance with

Comparing the values of (^S with the numerical values of (J^, it 
appears that they vary in general in the same sense for years of max- 
ima of sun spots, and in opposite senses for years of minima. But if 
we regard algebraical signs, a maximum maximorum of (JS corre- 
sponds to a minimum minimorum of S6^ and vice versa. 

5. Finally, the principal points of the preceding discussion may be 
implicitly summed up as follows: 

The function of temperature departures which we have just con- 
sidered ma}' be referred to a new origin of ordinates such that the 
departure +0'-.25 becomes the new zero; and we may reckon the new 
ordinates in the direction which was formerly that of increasing nega- 
tive departures. Denoting by 36 the new ordinates as thus consid- 
ered, it Avill be seen that Sd represents in some sort (other things being 
equal) the difference for each year between the temperature which 
would have been experienced if there had been no sun spots, and that 
which was experienced in realit}'; for the origin of ordinates at +0^.25 
corresponds with the conditions of the year 1900 when there were 
scarcely any sun spots. If now we take the mean of the values of Sd 
for the lirst half period 1870 to 1881, and multiph' this mean by the 
number of years in this half period, and deal similarly by the periods 
1881 to 1889, and 1889 to 1900, also treating the sun spot frequency 
data (^S after a similar fashion, the results obtained are expressed b}^

It apppears that — ^ — = 0.5 dz 0.06. There seems to be a remark- 

ably constant proportionalit}^ between the total number of sun spots 
and the summation of the temperature departures for all of the periods 
reviewed. 

6. From the result just given it seems to follow that we may assign 
to the arbitrary sun-spot frequency numbers of Wolf a physical sig- 
nificance expressing the mean relation between sun-spot frequency and 
terrestrial temperatures. Thus 1 Woli number corresponds to 0°.01 
X 0.5 = 0=.005 C. 

Finally, from this discussion we are able to state detinitel}" the fol- 
lowing law, which is also in agreement with the results of Koppen: 

The mean terrestrial temperature is subject to a period identical 
with tliat of sun-spot frequency, and the effect of the presence of sun 
spots is to diminisli the mean temperature of the earth, so that the 
curve of mean temperature departures runs parallel with an inverted 
curve of sun-spot frequency." 

III. 

It may now ])e inquired how far the result just reached might be 
theoretically predicted. It is known that sun spots radiate less than 
equal surfaces of the adjoining photosphere. This may be visually 
observed from a comparative study of sun-spot and photospheric 
spectra, which indicates a strong general absorption over the sun 
spots. It has also been shown by the bolometric observations of 
Langley, who reached the result that the umbra of an average spot 
emitted onh^ 61 per cent as nmch radiation as equal areas of the adja- 
cent photosphere. Again, at the time of maximum sun spots the 
thickness of the absorbing laj'er of the chromosphere is increased, 
which tends to diminish the radiation of the sun. Still, there are also 
present at this time many faculte which radiate more strongly than 
other portions of the photosphere. The effect of the faculas tends to 
offset the absorption of the more opaque chromosphere, and we may 
assume as a first approximation that the two effects compensate each 
other, leaving only the influence of sun spots themselves to consider. 

From the researches of Zenker,^ based upon several different methods 
yielding concordant results, the mean temperature of the earth's sur- 

«This law has been deduced from the discussion of observations made exclusively 
at tropical stations, for these alone present a sufficient regularity of climate to per- 
mit of the detection of such small temperature variations as are here in question. 
But it would seem to be legitimate to extend the application of the law to the whole 
surface of the globe, for it is impossible to conceive that a variation of the solar 
radiation could influence temperature over half tlie surface of the earth without 
affecting the remainder.

face would be —78° C/' if the solar radiation did not exist. Now, the 
actual mean temperature of the earth is about +15° C.,'' from which it 
follows that the effect of solar radiation is to raise the mean teniDer- 
ature of the earth 88° C. above the temperature of space. 

The mean area covered b}" sun spots during a ^ear of maximum 
activity may l)e taken as not far from one one-hundredth of the total 
area of the sun's disk. From this it follows that the radiation is 
diminished b}' the presence of sun spots by about one two-hundredth, 
and this should produce a diminution of terrestrial temperature of 
about jVt)° or 0°.MC. 

This, it will be remembered, is almost exactly the result obtained 
above from the discussion of direct observations as representing- the 
excess of mean terrestrial temperature during the 3'ears of minimimi 
over those of maximum sun spot activity.'"

cl desire to express here my thanks to M. Mascart, who has been so good as to 
place at my disposal for this investigation the library of the Bureau Central meteo- 
rologique, and to M. Angot, who has given me most valuable counsel. 

[Note by translator.] The author's discussion of temperature departures in 
connection with the sun-spot cycle has aroused considerable interest among meteor- 
ologists. It is fair to say that while expert opinion is not entirely in accord with 
him in his methods of study and conclusions, the criticism which has been called 
forth by his paper seems to indicate that meteorologists require further evidence 
rather than that they wholly disbelieve in the alleged association of sun spots and 
temperatures. 

Professor Angot, in an article translated for the Monthl}- "Weather Review of Au- 
gust, 1903 (p. 371), strongly objects to Nordmann's procedure of smoothing the yearly 
temperature departures and combining observations from numerous stations, on the 
gi'ounds of uncertainty of the real mean temperatures of some stations, and of the 
prejudicial effect upon the general mean of unequal lengths of the series of observa- 
tions at the several stations. He prefers to treat each station separately, and gives 
reductions of data from Guadaloupe, Hongkong, Batavia, Bombay, Barbados, and 
Habana, extending over periods ranging from ten to fifty years, and embracing 16 sun- 
spot periods altogether. Fourteen of these periods yield results in the same general 
direction as those obtained by Nordmann, and 2 in the contrary, so that Professor 
Angot remarks that "the probability is, then, according to these observations, 7 to 1, 
that an increase in the number of sun spots is accompanied by a diminution in the 
temperature." It appears from his reductions that "an increase of 100 in AVolf's 
relative sun-spot numbers (a difference which frequently exists between a maximum 
and a minimum) will be accompanied by a diminution of 0°.33 C. in the value of the 
mean annual temperature." Professor Angot concludes: "It is evident that in order 
to determine the value [of the temperature departure for an increase of 100 sun-spot 
numbers] it would be necessary to work with a much larger lunnber of series. I have 
given the numbers which j)recede only as an example of a method which appears to 
me more exact and more convincing than that ordinarily employed." 

Professor Abbe, commenting editorially on the articles of Nordmann and Angot 
(Monthly AVeather Review, October and December, 1903), refers to a discussion of 



148 THE SUlSr-SPOT PERIOD. 

the obiservations at Hohenpeissenberg, extending from 1792 to 1850, which he himself 
pubhshed in 1870. This discussion yielded the result that an increase of 100 Wolf 
numbers in the sun-spot frequency was attended on the average by a decrease of about 
1° C. in the mean annual temperature for this station. He refers also to Koppen's 
extensive investigation, which yielded the result that an increase of 100 sun-spot 
numbers was attended with a decrease of temperature of 0°.54 C. for equatorial 
stations, but with more complex effects for stations in temperate latitudes. But while 
this statistical evidence thus tends cliiefly in the same direction. Professor Abbe is 
not convinced that we can certainly ascribe tliis apparent temperature periodicity to 
solar influences. He says that although for a long time he "believed that it might be 
possible to establish an intimate connection between solar radiation and solar spots, 
yet the steady development of our knowledge of the selective absorption of the 
earth's atmosphere has shown that we can not argue by crude statistical methods 
from terrestrial temperatures up to solar radiation. We may speak of periods and 
variations in our temperatures, but these do not demonstrate a similar period in the 
solar temperatures or solar radiations, since unsuspected periodic variations in the 
constituents of the earth's atmosphere may be the cause of the variations w'e should 
otherwise attribute to the sun itself. * * * The mere fact that there is a decrease 
of temperature in the Tropics at sun-spot maximum argues nothing as to the direct 
relation of cause and effect between the two phenomena. I have on hand a collec- 
tion of monthly charts of temperature departures for the whole globe for several suc- 
cessive years, which tend to show clearly that the sun-spot period in the earth's 
temperature is a purely local, terrestrial matter, moving round from one part of the 
world to another, just as do our droughts and our rains, our barometric waves and 
our cold waves; analogous to the movement of an earthquake wave over the ocean, 
going sometimes rapidly and sometimes slowly, reflected from a continent, exaggerated 
in some arm of the ocean, breaking in waves on a shore, but scarcely felt on an 
island in midocean, and finally dying out by virtue of innumerable interruptions, as 
all forced waves must do unless they happen to be reenforced by a process similar 
to that of resonance in sound waves." 

A word may be added in connection with Nordmann's discussion of the direct effect 
of sun spots on temperature, which the diminished radiation of sun spots as com- 
pared with the photosphere would lead us to expect. Substantially the same argu- 
ment, based on Newton's law of cooling, was published by Professor Langley in 1876 
(see Monthly Notices British Astronomical Society, November, 1876), and he reached 
the conclusion that the presence of sun spots in a period of maximum solar activity 
might reduce the mean temperature of the earth not exceeding 0°.29 C. by their 
direct effect in diminishing solar radiation, but he did not decide whether terrestrial 
temiwrature may not be quite otherwise affected by some varying solar action of 
which spots are merely accompaniments. 

Within the last twenty years it has been shown that Newton's law of cooling does 
not apply to bodies losing heat solely by radiation, and it has been experimentally 
verified that, in accordance with Stefan's law, the perfect radiator or so-called 
"absolutely black body" emits an amount of radiation proportional to the fourth 
power of its temperature above absolute zero. All other bodies radiating by virtue 
of their temperature emit less than the perfect radiator at any given temperature, but 
at low temi^eratures imperfect radiators are found to depart from Stefan's law and 
to emit amounts more nearly i:)roportional to the fifth jiower of their temperature. 
Since the earth is losing heat almost solely by radiation and is kept at substantially a 
constant mean temperature of about 290° absolute by the solar rays, the earth's total 
radiation is proportional to (290)*+ and is equal to that received from the sun if we 
neglect the small amount received from space. If now the sun's radiation were 
reduced by o Jo, as supposed by the author, on account of the presence of sun spots, 



THE SUN-SPOT PERIOD. 149 

the earth would, if allowed sufficient time, take up a new mean temperature T such

that (T)*+=2QQ (290)*+ or T=290°f goo/"^' ^^"^ ^ ^^'^"^'^ ^® ^^"^^ *° ^^ exceed- 
ing 289°. 97, and the fall of temperature directly due to the sun spots would be only 
0°.03 or less. This line of argument is substantially that adopted by Professor 
Poynting, Philosophical Transactions, Series A, vol. 202, p. 530, 1903. 

It would therefore appear that the direct effect of sun spots is far smaller than that 
observed by Nordmann. But it is entirely possible that the increased a1)sorption of 
the sun's envelope, which he mentions as probably attending them, may produce the 
effects found. See in this connection Halm's article, "A New Solar Theory," Smith- 
sonian Reiwrt, 1902, and also S. P. Langley, Astrophysical Journal, June, 1904. 



METHODS OF FORECASTING THE WEATHER. 



By Prof. J. :M. Perntek. 



Allow mc to-day to address 3-011 once again on the subject of weather 
prophets, and this time to bring before you not only one or two kinds 
of weather forecasting, but to give you a more general survey of all 
methods at present in use, be they right or wrong, with or without 
results. I will keep strictly to the title of this lecture and give the 
prominent place to the methods of forecasting. 1 shall explain them 
and subject them to critical analysis, naming at the same time the 
advocates of each of the various methods; in the technical investiga- 
tion, we have to do with the value of the methods and not that of the 
persons. I must, however, at once bring prominently forward the 
fact that we have at present, uufortunatel}^, no method by which we 
can forecast the weather with absolute certainty even for one day in 
advance, to saj nothing of longer periods. This is already self-evident 
from the fact that we are now able to speak of man}^ methods of fore- 
casting, whereas if there were a sure and infallible method, then it 
would be out of place to speak of the other methods to this society for 
the advancement of scientific knowledge. 

All methods of weather forecasting, not excepting those in use b}^ 
the central meteorological offices, are based upon observed weather 
conditions, and have, therefore, an empirical foundation. Many of 
them do not even make the slightest attempt to put their methods on 
a theoretical basis and content themselves with setting up "'weather 
rules." P^ven the scientific methods of professional meteorologists 
have not yet succeeded in deducing a theory capable of determining in 
advance the changes of the weather as the eflect of one or several 
known causes. Only the advocates of the influence of the moon have 
ventured solely by means of aprioristic theories to "calculate" the 
weather for long periods in advance.

152 METHODS OF FOKECASTING THE WEATHER. 

There are man\' widely difi'crent iiiethod.s Ijy Avhicb the various 
classes and kinds of weather prophets carr}' on the work of weather 
forecasting. There are those who make use of the behavior of animals 
to foretell the weather; hunters wdio recognize the character of the 
approaching season from the actions of the wild animals; the observers 
of birds, spiders, crickets, ants, and other animals, from whose conduct 
they judge of the approaching weather. But in addition to this class 
which utilizes living animals there is another opposing class that pre- 
fers to make use of the dead substances of the animal or vegetable 
kingdoms, such as hairs, strings of instruments, roots and fibers of 
plants; by means of their expansions or contractions, either with the 
aid of little weather houses and figures or without them, they recog- 
nize the coming weather. Others prefer to consult stones and walls 
as to the character of the Aveather to be expected, and turn rather to 
inorganic nature in order to learn from the "sweating'' or dryness of 
these whether to expect rain or continued fine w^eather. Thus, as you 
see, all the kingdoms of nature arc drawn upon to furnish prognostics 
of the weather, and it may depend upon the occupations and predilec- 
tions of the various persons interested in the coming weather whether 
the}' give the preference to one or the other. But I had almost for- 
gotten to mention another class — perhaps the largest — those who are 
not to be satisfied by any one of the three kingdoms nor even by all 
three together, and who rely onl}^ on their own bodies for foretelling 
the weather — assuming, of course, that these have nerves, joints, and 
corns. Sometimes it is the stomach and sometimes even the head that 
is made use of. 1 am not joking in the least; on the contrary, the 
persons inclined to this kind of weather forecasting excite ni}^ sincere 
commiseration. 

If these classes of weather prophets who inidertake to foretell the 
weather l)}^ the sensations of their bodies, by obsei'vations of the ani- 
mal and vegetalde kingdoms, and even l)y the processes of inorganic 
nature, alwa3's rely upon facts which may have a distant connection 
with the weather, yet they are still far ])ehind that class which forms 
its conclusions of the approaching weather from observations of the 
weather conditions themselves. You are all well acquainted with this 
latter class of weather prophets. In ever}^ community there is at least 
one person who is especially relied upon, whether he be a farmer, a 
miller, a teacher, or a pastor of long standing. They look up at the 
sky, observe the clouds and the direction of their motion, and from 
these they forecast the weather for the next day, with good results. 
These local weather prophets rely indeed upon phenomena which have 
the closest connection with the coming weather. For the weather does 
not spring like a Deus ex Machina down from a distant cuckoo's nest 
in the clouds, but is drawn from comparatively near regions, or, if 
you prefer, forms gradually in the place itself. This coming, this 



METHODS OF FORECASTING THE WEATHER. 153 

formation of the weather, is announced 1)}^ the appearance of the sky, 
sometimes for a longer, sometimes for a shorter time in advance, and 
the skill of the weather prophet consists in rig-htly interpreting, for 
the near future, the appearance of the sky and the weather conditions. 
Since it is generally necessar}' in order to grasp the weather condi- 
tions correctly, to have a clear judgment founded on long experience 
in observing, together with an accurate eye, and, I might almost say, 
an inborn quickness of perception, therefore there are as a rule onl}^ 
single individuals in every community who enjoy the reputation of 
being good weather pi'ophets. Certain phenomena, however, are of 
so typical a nature that they have been reduced to lixed rules and are 
everywhere expressed in popular language. 

Thus every country has its weather signs; if the clouds are increas- 
ing, a storm or continuous bad weather is approaching. In every 
locality there is one direction of cloud motion that betokens bad 
weather, and another, generall}' the opposite direction, which portends 
fine weather, etc. Weather rules relative to the red morning and 
evening sk}" have been deduced. The rules that l)ad weather is 
expected when in any given locality the sunnnit of a certain mountain 
is covered with a cap; that a small " watery'' halo around the moon 
indicates rain; that the weather will continue liad if, when the clouds 
break up, a second light covering of clouds is seen a})ove them; that 
it will l)e fine weather if, after rainy weather, according to the locality, 
a certain wind sets in; that a slow breaking up of the clouds gives 
promise of fine weather, etc. ; all of these rules have been fornuilated 
from long-continued and accurate observation, and are exceedingl}" 
well adapted for local weather forecasts from one day to the next. 
Experienced observers also know from the color and nature of the 
clouds whether the prevailing weather, notwithstanding otherwise 
favorable indications, will continue or will change, and b}^ these deli- 
cate distinctions they generally acquire the reputation of being 
especiall}^ good weather prophets. 

These observations of weather signs led the way, however, to more 
far-reaching rules which included the attempt to determine from the 
weather conditions at a certain season of the year what the}' would be 
for a long series of days; or, to determine from the weather of a sea- 
son, or of a certain da}^, or a fraction of a day, the conditions of an 
approaching season. Thus originated the so-called " farmer's rules," 
among which are some valuable ones based upon good observations 
extending over a hundred years, but in contrast to these there are, 
unfortunately, man}^ poor ones for which we are indebted to the 
superficial and frivolous rules manufactured by speculating calendar 
makers. 

Others, however, went still further and, from observing that the 
weather of one year resembled that of a former year, concluded that 



154 METHODS OF FORECASTING THE WEATHER. 

there is a certain regularity in the recurrence of years with similar 
characteristics, and that they were justified in enunciating the law^ that 
almost exactly the same weather returns at intervals of eleven, or of 
eighteen, or nineteen 3"ears, so that it would onl}" be necessary to 
expect in the coming year the weather observed a certain lumiber of 
3^ears before. It is evident that this would be the simplest method 
for predicting the weather in any year, day by day, or at least week 
by week, and this is the system followed in the so-called '*hundred- 
3^ear calendar." Unfortunately the facts do not agree with the 
predictions. 

Both the methods above named in general endeavor to keep one free 
from preconceived ideas as to causes, and base their predictions of the 
weather only upon earlier observations and experience, often sup- 
ported by records of the weather actually prtn'ailing, whether made 
with or without instruments. There are other prophets who have 
sought for the cause that dominates the weather and weather changes 
and adopting this when found Iiave made their weather predictions 
in accordance w'ith the properties, movements, and changes of this 
accepted cause. 

This latter class, somewhat precipitately and without sufficient 
experience in the principles of observational work, l)ut driven by the 
innate longing in the human })reast to seek for a cause for all matters 
and supported only b}' general a priori considerations has sought for 
the dominating cause of the weather. Thus, from the consideration 
that the sun dominates everything on the earth, Professor Zenger has 
chosen that as the agent of the weather changes, which he ascribes to 
the rotation of the sun on its axis. Now, since the time required for 
a revolution of the sun occupies al)out twenty-six days, he has chosen 
one-half of the time of a revolution, that is to say twelve to thir- 
teen da3's, as the ]:>eriod by which he measures the changes of the 
weather, and has arranged a weather calendar according to which 
there is a day of disturbance every twelve to thirteen days. In the 
interval ])etween the two da3^s of disturbance there is an interval of 
safety, or what he calls " calms." The comparison of the predictions 
of the "da^'s of disturbance" and ""da^ys of calms" with the weather 
actually occurring is supposed to give the proof of the correctness of 
the assumption that the semirotation of the sun governs the weather. 
Up to the present time, however, this has not yet been accomplished, 
for the attempted demonstration lias entirelj^ failed. 

The method of weather predictions proposed by Professor Servus 
is of a similar character; he considers the interior of the earth, and 
from the fact that the attraction of the earth upon the atmosphere 
attaches the latter to the earth, he argues that " all the great disturb- 
ances in the equilibrium of our atmosphere are caused by changes in 
the condition of the interior of the earth, which produce disturbances 



METHODS OF FORECASTTl^G THE WEATHER. 155 

in the power of iittraction." You will see at once without further 
explanation that this i« not a tena])le principle for weather predictions. 
Servus himself, for the purpose of preparing weather predictions, has 
been oblioed to call in the sun and moon to his aid as causes of the 
disturbance in the condition of the interior of the earth. In this way 
his method approaches so nearly to that of Zenger and those of the 
lunar prophets that we need not treat of it separatel3\ 

But Professor Lamprecht has shown us in a most startling manner 
how far one may be led awa}^ l)}^ adopting a priori causes for the 
changes of weather without a sufficient basis of experience. By 
analyzing a series of observations for several 3^ears he has discovered 
five periods in weather processes, one of 12^ days, one of 12|f days, 
one of 13y\ days, one of 14f days, and one of 29f days. Before pass- 
ing on I must just tell you that one can, according to his method, 
compute periods of almost any length desired. This is not objection- 
able; but he now proceeds immediately to find the causes for these 
periods, which were really only computed and not at all furnished by 
experience, and, since he sincerely wished it, he found them. We can 
only be astonished at the boldness of his hypothesis. He assumes 
the earth to be surrounded b}" five rings, similar to the rings of 
Saturn, and that their periods of rotation and temporary relations to 
one another are the causes of his weather periods. Lamprecht repre- 
sented to himself the existence of these imaginary rings in such a 
manner that he immediately endowed the rings with names, giving 
them successively the following magnificent names: Emperor William 
ring, Moltke ring, Bismarck ring, Copernicus ring, King Albert ring. 

An old and by far the most widespread method of weather predic- 
tion is based on the idea, which is 1 might say universal among man- 
kind," that the heavenly bodies have an influence on everj-thing which 
takes place on the earth, and particularly upon the weather. The 
moon is that one which was supposed to more especially influence the 
weather, although this power was attributed to the planets also, so 
that each one produces a certain kind of weather, and therefore 
divides the year into damp, dr}^ stormy, quiet periods, etc., accord- 
ing as one or the other planet is the "" ruler for the year." The moon 
is credited with the principal dominator of the changes of the weather. 
The weather is supposed to change by preference with the moon; 
th(M-efore the new moon and the full moon especially possess the 
power of influencing the weather, and one of the most widel}' spread 
weather rules is that the weather changes with the new moon and the 

« Astrology seems to have been specially cultivated in Mesopotamia and to have 
been spread north, south, and west by Sanskrit, (ireek, and Aral) indueiices. It is 
peculiarly Asiatic and Eurojiean. Tliere is no record of its having had any great 
intlnence among the Chinese, Malays, or American Indians. It can, therefore, 
hardly be spoken of as uni\ersal amung mankind. — Ed. 



156 METHODS OF FORECASTING THE WEATHER. 

full moon. However, the first and last quarters are considered of 
greatest importance by a great many. Especiall}' clever observers of 
the influence of the moon upon the weather pretend to have also 
observed the distinctive individual influences of the phases known as 
octants. In general the opinion is very widespread that the decreas- 
ing moon exercises a weak and the increasing moon a strong influence. 
Thus far the theory of the influence of the moon on the weather is the 
direct I'csult of the popular belief in the moon, without regard to any 
scientific basis. 

I am not able to state whether the growth of this popular l)elief was 
preceded b}^ observations of the weather changes, and is therefore to 
be regarded as a result of observations (it is not a question here as 
to whether the latter were defecti\'e and inconclusive or not), or 
whether, on the contrary, the belief in the influence of the heavenly 
bodies and in that of the one which, after the sun, appears the largest 
and most striking to mankind, namely, the moon, was tlie earliest 
step, and that it was in the light of this belief that observations were 
first made. At all events, the latter is far more probable than the 
former, and therefore I can not put the moon theory of w^eather pre- 
dictions in the same category as the methods mentioned in preceding 
paragraphs. These latter methods were certainly based on observa- 
tions (we sa}" nothing as to whether the <)l)servations were correct or 
not); but this is not established in regard to the belief in the moon 
theory; indeed, the probability is in favor of the contrary process, 
namely, the opinion that the moon must influence the weather came 
first, and observations only came later in order to see if the theory 
were correct. 

This idea is strongly supported by the more recent development of 
the theory of the influence of the moon upon the weather. This 
newest and at the present time very prominent phase of this theory 
did not start by collecting reliable observational data and deducing 
from these observations the influence of the moon upon the weather, 
but first adopted the, old belief in the moon and then sought to create 
for it a scientitic basis by means of a priori assumptions and even theo- 
retical mathematical explanations. 

With these results, either assumed or computed, the representative 
of the modernized theory of the moon appt^ars before the pul)lic and 
invites his contemporaries to test his '"results " b}' ol)servation. This 
process is, as you see, the exact opposite to that of the true empirical 
method. The empiricist makes observations, observes long and 
nmch, and sums up the general results of the observations in certain 
propositions or "rules," and when it is possible draws his conclusions 
as to the cause of the phenomena. The modern n.ioon prophets turn 
the process upside down. They designate the moon ])eforeliand as the 
cause of the changes of the weather; from the various positions of the 



METHODS OF FORECASTING THE WEATHER. 157 

moon with respect to the earth and the sun, with the assistance of 
the laws of attraction — without any strict investio-ition as to how far 
these can possibly be of influence — the}" compute the attraction exer- 
cised by the moon in its separate positions, and say on such and such 
a day the influence of the moon must have produced such and such a 
result on the weather. The contirmation of these predictions by 
the observations should then only show the accuracy of their assump- 
tions and computations. The number of tliese modern moon pi'oph- 
ets is at present larg-e. Many of them take into consideration the 
planets in addition to the moon. The names of the most prominent 
advocates of these moon theories are known to you. They arc as fol- 
lows: Falb, Ledochowski, Gladbach, Demtschinski, Garigou-Lagrange, 
A. Poincare — not the celebrated mathematician — and Digby. 

It would be quite erroneous if this method of investigation into the 
causes of the weather were regarded as incorrect and improper. By 
this presentation of the subject I wish only to show that the modern 
moon prophets — and pro])aljly also the older ones — have not intro- 
duced stricth" inductive empirical methods into their belief in the 
moon, but that this belief was there from the first and that they have 
made use of the discovery method for its confirmation, since it is on 
the basis of the moon theory, or, if you prefer, of aprioristic consid- 
erations as to the influence of the moon, that they make their weather 
predictions, and then from the agreement betw een these they endeavor 
to deduce the correctness of their assumptions. Against this method 
as such there is nothing to be said, ])ut it demands the most conscien- 
tious, straightforward, logical, and accurate determination of the con- 
sec^uent weather if we wish I)}' this method to arrive at a confirmation 
or refutation of the propositions advanced as to the influence of the 
moon. How this is to be managed we have still to learn; meanwhile 
it is at present only necessary, in this enumeration of the various 
methods for predicting the Aveather, to include that one which repre- 
sents the influence of the moon. 

As soon as men began to obserAC the barometer attentively, the}^ 
began gradually to recognize that the rising and falling of the barom- 
eter had an evident connection wdtli the weather. It was the celebrated 
burgomaster, Otto von Guericke, of Magdeburg, Avho first used the 
barometer as a " weather glass." He applied, even then, to his water 
barometer the ''weather scale" which is at present in such general 
use, on which the highest reading occurring at any place is designated 
as "fine weather," the lowest reading as "rain and wind," etc. 
The barometer as a weather glass has taken its course throughout the 
world, and is to-day used almost universally. After tiie introduction 
of the aneroid barometer th(^ " weather scale" was also aflixed to that, 
and whoever ])ui'chases such an instrument paj^s particular attention to 



15B Methods of fokecasting the weather. 

make .sure that the weather scale is correctly fixed on it. The makers 
of these instruments must know the mean pressure at the dwelling- 
place of the purchaser; there they place the term "changeable;" the 
point where the pressure is about 10 millimeters above the mean is 
" line," and at about 20 millimeters above the point designated as 
"changeable" will be "steady," "fine," or "dry," or the like, kt 
about the same distance below "changeable" is placed "rain" and 
"storm." 

Whoever has provided himself with an instrument of this kind 
believes himself to l)e the possessor of a self -registering weather 
prophet and is generally highly indignant if it rains when his barome- 
ter stands at "fine," or astonished if it is fine weather when the barom- 
eter says." rain." Since these erroneous indications are not unusual 
with the barometer, therefore faith in it as an indicator of the weather 
is very much diminished, and is only maintained at all, on the one 
hand, by the fact that the barometer frequently "indicates correctly," 
and, on the other hand, by force of habit. Frequently, however, one 
has taken refuge in another instrument, namely, the hygrometer. 
This instrument shows only the amount of moisture actually prevail- 
ing in the air, in the same way that the barometer indicates the act- 
ually prevailing- pressure. As the pressure and the moisture are both 
connected with the weather, the hygrometer may be used as a weather 
prophet in the same way as the barometer, although that is not its real 
vocation. If the h3'grometer shows a high degree of moisture, that 
only indicates that the air is just then very moist, and this generall}' 
happens onl}^ when the weather is already bad. However, it happens 
sometimes that the moisture in the air increases while the weather is 
still fine, so that the hygrometer then indicates approaching ])ad 
weather. In the same way, the hygrometer will generally indicate 
dryness when the weather is fine; it will sometimes, however, when 
the weather is not j^et fine, point to decreasing moisture, and there))y 
foretell approaching drier and finer weather. The best of these 
hj^grometers are made of human hairs, divested of grease, which have 
the property of being expanded by dampness and contracted by dry- 
ness in a most admirable manner. This property of varying its dimen- 
sions with the changing moisture is also possessed, by other animal 
and vegetable substances. There are a number of weather indicators 
of this kind, among which the little house with the little man and 
woman, in which the man goes out in bad weather and the woman in 
fine w^eather, is probably the best known. 

The discredit into which the hygrometer as a weather prophet has 
often faHen is as easily understood as in the case of the barometer. 
Its duty is only to show the moisture actually prevailing at its locality, 
and this knowledge does not enable one to make determinations of the 
approaching weather any more accurately than does a knowledge of 
the pressure at any place. 



METHODS OF FOEECASTING THE WEATHER. 159 

A new, and we must at once say a truly empirical method of weather 
prediction, is that at present in use In* all the official central meteoro- 
loo'ical establishments in the world. This method has o-raduallv and 
slowl}^ develo})ed according- to the exact rules of investigation in 
scientific practical meteorology, and is still far from having reached 
perfection. It has developed entirely, without any addition of an 
a priori nature, out of the observations of the weather processes, and 
is therefoi'e based entirely upon well-established observational data. 
The most fundamenttd of these facts is that the weather is associated 
with the distribution of atmospheric pressure. It has been recognized 
more and more clearly b}^ experience that the weather is determined 
not by pressure as shown by the barometer at the place of observation, 
but by the barometric conditions that prevail over vast regions; for 
instance, those distributed over the whole of Europe. Therefore one 
must chart and study the distriljution of atmospheric pressure over 
the whole of Europe if one wishes to understand the weather actually 
prev^ailing. 

It was necessary, first of all, to determine by extended observations, 
made as nearh^ simultaneous as possible, the distribution of atmos- 
phei'ic pressure for a definite hour, in order to perceive to what kind 
of weather this distri))ution of atmospheric pressure corresponded. 
It was by this means demonsti'ated that there is an extraordinarily 
great variety of forms of atmospheric pressure distribution; that 
these, however, can be classified into a certain number of types b}^ 
having regard to the form as well as to the weather conditions given 
in these forms. * * * Xhe thorough and persevering study of 
the weather that prevails on the occurrence of each t\ pe has led to 
the definite and certain recognition of the following theorems: 

1. The weather, in all its details, depends upon the distribution of 
atmospheric pressure, and the same weather always corresponds to 
the same location relative to this distribution. 

2. The weather of any place is, therefore, determined b}' its position 
in and relation to the various styles of pressure distribution. 

3. If we succeed in knowing in advance what distribution of atmos- 
pheric pressure will prevail on a certain day or on a series of succes- 
sive days or a longer , season, then the weather of the day or of the 
period of time is therel)y determined in advance. 

4. The modifications introduced by reason of geographical conditions, 
the configuration of the ground — as, for example, the location of a 
place in the Alps, etc.- -are constant for the location in each style of 
pressure distribution. 

By means of these theorems, which were deduced from exact obser- 
vations, the foundation Avas laid for a careful method of weather pre- 
diction. Two things were now necessary: (a) The perfecting of our 
knowledge of the typical distributions of atmospheric pressure and of 



160 METHODS OF FORECASTING THE WEATHEE. 

the details of the weather attending them; (/>) the deduction of the 
rules, according to which one form of di.stri])ution of pressure either 
remains stationary, or moves over Europe, or changes into another 
form, or is pushed aside by some other type. 

It is in the nature of things that the hrst task is more easily accom- 
plished than the second. The present state of the art of weather pre- 
diction in our central meteorological institutes corresponds to this 
condition of nftairs. The details of the weather conditions within the 
various styles of pressure distril)ution are, on the whole, quite well 
known. However, there remains much to be done in this direction, and 
it is now one of the most important duties of meteorology to most 
thoroughly investigate, in all directions and details, the distribution 
of the weather according to the forms of pressure distril)ution. The 
knowledge of the weather condition^^ for every place and for every 
type of pressure distribution otiers the only entirely satisfactor}" 
empirical basis for weather predictions; moreover, it is by this knowl- 
edge alone that we can hope at some time to discover the fundamental 
laws of the changes in the weather. This knowledge, however, does not 
lead us inunediately to a prediction of the approaching weather, but only 
teaches us to know the weather of one particular place when the distri- 
bution of pressure is known. In order to he able to predict the weather, 
we nuist know one thing more — we nuist know in advance what distri- 
bution of atmospheric pressure will prevail at the time for which we are 
predicting the weather. This foreknowledge of the pressuredistribution 
is the starting poi nt upon which the whole weather forecast depends. If 
this foreknowledge of the future distribution of atmospheric pressure is 
impossilde, then weather prediction is impossible; if we can foretell it 
approximately, then a weather prediction of greater' or less probabilit}^ 
is possil)le, and we shall be al)le to make a larger number of correct 
than of incorrect predictions; if the distribution of atmospheric pres- 
sure can be known in advance with certaint}', then we shall be able to 
make weather predictions with certainty. 

NoAv, how do we stand as to the question of certainty in foreseeing 
the approaching distribution of atmospheric pressure? If we knew 
the laws according to which one distribution of atmospheric pressure 
changes over into another, or according to which it moves across 
Europe, as well as the laws that cause one distribution of atmospheric 
pressure to contiiuu^ stationary or suddenly break up and another one 
result from it, then the problem could be solved and future weather 
could be predicted with entire certainty. We should proceed with 
mathematical accuracy in the prediction of weather, and be able to 
attain the correctness of the astronomers in their predictions of celes- 
tial planetar}' motions and phenomena. This, of course, is the ultimate 
aim of meteorological science, but we are at present so far removed 
from it that we have many well-founded doubts as to whether this 
object will ever be attained, l^p to the present time we are only able 



METHODS OF FORECASTING THE WEATHER. 161 

to deduce from the experience hitherto acquired a few empirical laws 
of limited applica])ility, according to which the types of distril)utioii of 
atmospheric pressure remain stationary, chanoe, or transform them- 
selves entirely, or perhaps move away over the earth; even this limited 
empirical knowledge relates almost entirely to the change from one 
day to the next. Since these empirical laws as to the changes in the 
distributioji of atmospheric pressure are so defective the difficulty of 
foreseeing the approaching distri])ution of pressure is correspondingly 
great, and the prediction of the weather even for the next day is pro- 
portionately unreliable. Since we have to do only with theorems 
founded entirely upon experience, the persons best (pialitied to make 
the predictions are those who through long years of practice have col- 
lected the most theorems as to the variations in the forms of pressure 
distribution, and have also learned by practice the many modifications 
to which these theorems are subject. In the forecasts for the next day 
men of much experience attain to more than 80 verifications in a total 
of lUO predictions; but the prediction of the distribution of pressure 
for more than one day in advance has such a low probability that in a 
forecast of the weather for several da3'^s in advance we must expect 
more failures than results. 

You will say: " It is despairingly little that we have to expect from 
scientific weather predictions, and hence it is not to be wondered at 
that the public generally clamors for methods that promise more." 
It is easy to promise, l)ut one's promise must be kept, and that is 
difficult. It would also be easy for scientific meteorologists to make 
the same promises and boastings as the other weather prophets, but 
they would then cease to be called scientific. And of what use is it 
to cling to those weather prophets who certainl}^ promise a great 
deal, but finalh' leave you in the lurch 1 Of the popular methods of 
predicting the weather above enumerated, none accomplish nearly as 
much as is accomplished at present by the scientific method; indeed, 
very often they accomplish nothing beyond the noise they make in 
praising themselves. However, l)ef ore I begin to criticise the various 
methods, I will liriefl}' lay before you the processes adopted in weather 
prediction at the central meteorological stations. You know that at our 
central office in Vienna, for example, telegrams arrive every morning 
from more than 1-10 places over the whole of Europe; these t(degi'ams 
contain the observations made that morning of pressure, temperature, 
moisture, precipitation, and wind. According to these telegrams the 
chart of the distribution of atmospheric pressui-e is drawn as it pre- 
vailed over Europe that morning; and from this particular st3Me of 
distribution of atmospheric pressure in conjunction with that which 
prevailed on the preceding day, and by making use of the above- 
mentioned empirical laws governing the chang(\s in the forms of the 
pi'essure areas, a tracing is made of the probable areas of atmospheric 



162 METHODS OF FORECASTING THE WEATHER. 

pressure for the next day. When this sketch is completed then the 
predictions for the various portions of tlie kingdom are made upon 
the basis of our knowledge of the weather conditions at different 
points of each area of atmospheric pressure. Thus the primary diffi- 
culty consists in forming a correct conception of the pres.'sure distri- 
bution for the next day, based on that prevailing on the morning of 
the da}^ in (juestion, and at the same time a clear idea as to the velocity 
with which the changes will proceed. In order to facilitate this diffi- 
cult task the central office receives immediately before the making of 
the forecast, which takes place at l.;->0 p. m., a short telegram from 
twelve selected stations in Austria-Hungary, giving the latest infor- 
mation as to changes in temperature, pressure, and cloudiness that 
have occurred at these stations since the morning observatioji. From 
this last item Ave can perceive with more certaint}' whether we have 
formed a correct idea as to the distribution of atmospheric pressure 
for the next day or not, and therefore whether to retain or modif}" 
the forecast. It is only after the data of the midday telegrams have 
been made use of that the definitive forecast is made. At 1.4.5 p. m. 
the weather report goes to the printer, and the corresponding tele- 
grams are sent to thosc^ who ha\e subscribed for the daily telegraphic 
forecasts. 

The results of this s^^stem of honest weather forecasts are indeed 
modest, but are such as to show a real and striking progress in weather 
predictions as compared with other methods. Of course even this 
earnest scientific method allows us only to consider the general char- 
acteristics of the weather, as, for example, "fine," " windy," "mild," 
"line and cold," "cloudy," "rainy," "warm," etc., as the ol)ject of 
the weather forecast. This method would inmiediately supplant all 
others if it would undertake to foretell the duration and amount of 
precipitation, the degree of the thermometer, the exact force of the 
wind, etc. However, we may at present be A^er}- well satisfied if the 
general character of the weather is predicted for us. Unfortunately 
even the scientific method can give us no positive certainty, since even 
b}^ confining itself to these general characteristics it can at present 
offer onl}^ a little above 80 per cent of verifications of the weather. 

In this state of the case it is self-evident that our efforts are to be 
guided in the direction of those studies that will lead us to an ever 
increasing accuracy in forecasting. These studies of course relate (1) 
to more and more thorough investigations of the weather conditions 
at every point and in every phase of the distribution of atmospheric 
pressure; (2) to the discovery of signs by which to form a judgment 
(a) as to the rapidity and paths with which each type of pressure dis- 
tri})ution moves over Europe, (l) into what other forms a given type 
of distribution transforms itself and the rapidity of such change, and 
{e) what changes in the weather attend the various modifications of one 



METHODS OF FORECASTING THE WEATHER. 163 

and the same type of atmospheric pressure distribution. W'ith the 
increase of our knowledge on these points the weather predictions 
will also become more and more accurate. However, it is verA'^ doubt- 
ful whether it will ever be possible for us to invariably attain absolute 
accuracy even for one day in advance. Ever}' increase in the percent- 
a.ge of veritications is, however, of the greatest value, especialh' to 
national economics. 

Now, as a matter of course, the meteorologists are looking every- 
where in order to take ad^'antage of everything which may be of assist- 
ance to them in this matter. In the first place, there are the man^^ 
good weather rules that have been deduced from the experience of 
many hundreds of years. But the greatest numljer and most valuable 
of these weather rules are only applicable to local weather predictions, 
whereas the central meteorological institutes must make their predic- 
tions for verj' distant countries also, as, for example, Austria for 
Dalmatia, Vorarlberg, Bukowina, etc. 

Those weather rules, however, which relate to the weather condi- 
tions of certain definite dates, and which are generalh- looked upon as 
farmers' rules, are sometimes of great assistance in making forecasts. 
Thus we know that on certain dates of the yeav there has for centu- 
ries been a tendency to a certain kind of weather; for example, to 
-rainy weather. Therefore, if at such periods the distribution of 
atmospheric pressure is of such a form that it may easily change to a 
type corresponding to the weather indicated l^y the farmers' rules, 
then we may be tolerably certain that we must forecast wet weather. 
But, on the other hand, if at some such period the distribution of 
pressure is of such a character as would ordinarily justify us in hoping 
for a change of weather, still we know that this change is not likel}' 
to occur, because there is a continued tendency at this period to wet 
weather, and a change of weather is not to be looked for. Such aid as 
this from farmers' rules is, however, of moderate value and rarely 
available. But it is quite otherwise, in the opinion of the l)elievers in 
the moon, when we consider the support that the weather predictions 
might derive from hypotheses that attribute to the moon and the rest 
of the heavenly bodies a decided influence on the weather. I will 
express myself more in detail on this subject. 

First and foremost, I must insist most strongly on the fact that pro- 
fessional meteorologists themselves have always recognized and do 
recognize one influence of one heavenly body as most decisive and the 
sole cause of the weather on our earth, viz, the heating of the earth 
and of its atmosphere by the smi. The sun regulates our weather; it 
gives rise to winter and summer; In* evaporation it raises the aqueous 
vapor into the air, and this vapor, by cooling, produces clouds and 
rain, snow, storms, and hail; it is the primary cause of the differences 
in atmospheric pressure, and in this way produces the winds. 



164 METHODS OF FOKECASTING THE WEATHEE. 

This heating- intlucnco of the sun, as also its modilications by cloudi- 
ness, by the wind, by the change from day to night or from winter to 
summer, and by the properties of the earth's surface, which, consist- 
ing as it does of water and of land either covered with vegetation or 
barren and bald, has varying capacities for absorbing the sun's heat — 
this influence of the heat of the sun has been established with the most 
absolute certainty l)y the most exact observations. It has been demon- 
strated to be so much more important than any other cause, if any 
such exists, that up to the present time it has not been possible to 
recognize any other cause with certainty, in spite of the fact that the 
professional meteorologists, and singularly enough they only, have 
instituted extensive and most thoroughly exact investigations in order 
to discover such other influences, in case there are any, and to deter- 
mine their value. And what has been the result of these extraordi- 
naril}' lal)orious and wearisome investigations!' Before I answer this 
question I must call your attention to the fact that not one of the rep- 
resentatives of the theory of the influence of the moon, or of any other 
cosmical influence, has undertaken to give an unobjectionable rigor- 
ous demonstration of such an influence. These gentlemen content 
themselves with the inventive method and appl}^ it in a very singular 
manner. They make their predictions for certain days and always 
call attention to the cases when they are successful, but never trouble 
themselves al>out the failures. Now, 1 beg you to observe that in 
every game of chance where there are but two alternatives there nuist 
occur fift}^ verifications out of every one hundred guesses, when a 
great numl)er of guesses are made and it is all pure chance. The 
time at which the game of chance is played, or the time when the 
guess is made, is absolutely' without any influence whatever upon the 
result. So, also, the drawing out of an even or uneven number of 
balls could have no influence upon the weather, even if it should occur 
to some one always to predict fine weather when he drew an even' 
numl)er and bad weather when he drew an uneven one. If, there- 
fore, one should make use of the above-mentioned inventive methods, 
he should carefuU}- record all the cases — the failures as well as the 
verifications. And then, even if every second case is a success — that 
is to say, even if he obtains 50 per cent of verifications — ho will know 
that the theorem or assumption made use of as the basis of the pre- 
dictions really has no causal connection with the weather. Only when 
more than 50 per cent of verifications are attained can the argument 
favor the assumption, and so much the more in proportion as the 
verifications exceed 50 per cent. 

This exact method, the only one for testing their hypotheses as to 
the cosmical influences on the weather, is the one that has never been 
applied; in fact, it has often been distinctl}^ rejected by those who 
maintain the existence of these influences; and yet those who make 



METHODS OF FORECASTING THE WEATHER. 165 

assertions should prove them. It was the professional meteorologists 
themselves who undertook the accurate exanunation of all the various 
cosmical hypotheses, and particularly that of the influence of the moon, 
and it was they who found a slight influence of the moon on storms, 
thunderstorms, the direction of the wind, atmospheric pressure, etc. 
Now, do vou say, "1 told you soT' Well, tir.st of all, observe- — and 
I can not in.sist upon it too strongly — that it is the professional 
meteorologists, and they alone, who have made these investigations 
which point to a slight influence of the moon. Next, I must direct 
your attention to that little word "slight." The influence thus dis- 
covered by them is indeed so small that we can not even state with 
certaint}" whether it really does exist at all; or whether, perhaps, 
it was only perceptible in these investigations because the period 
of time included in them is still too short to furnish us with an 
unexceptionable result. However, let us assume that this slight influ- 
ence really does exist, and let us examine the amount of this influence 
a little more closely. Its magnitude is expressed by the percentages 
of the favorable cases. We will, however, for once greatly exaggerate 
and assume that these favorable cases amount to a surplus of 6 per 
cent. That is to sa}', that in 100 cases 55 succeed and 45 fail. Now, if 
you use such lunar rules for weather predictions, what does it advan- 
tage you in isolated single cases? For instance, 3^ou are in doubt as 
to whether the rain is to be expected or not; the influence of the moon 
indicates rain with a weight of 0.05. In spite of this small weight, if 
now you forecast bad weather, 3"ou will, if 100 such cases occur, have 
a failure in 45 cases. Had you paid no attention to the influence of 
the moon you would possibl}^ have had 50 failures. Thus, in this case 
of 5 per cent of surplus, that would be the whole efl'ect of your con- 
sideration of the moon's influence. But we have in fact assumed an 
exaggerated case, and the real influence of the moon is in every case 
less than one-half of this, if indeed it reall}^ exists at all. 

You may rest assured that the professional meteorologists accept, 
nay, even seek for, everything that can give them any assistance what- 
ever in their weather predictions. By constant investigation and study 
we ma}' hope to advance step by step and per cent 1)}' per cent. Every 
single per cent of agreement that is gained is an important advance 
and success. 



PROGRESS WITH AIR SHIPS/' 



By Maj. B. Baden-Powell, treats Guards. 



The advent of a really practical machine for accomplishino- the nav- 
igation of the air is awaited with much interest, and tlie .somewhat mea- 
ger and unreliable information that one can pick up from the daily press 
is apt only to increase our anxiet}^ to know what is realh^ being done 
in this line. In the Illustrated Scientific News of June, I gave a brief 
sketch of the histor}^ of mechanically propelled balloons and what had 
been accomplished up to recent years. During this summer some dis- 
tinct progress has been achieved in this line. 

SANTOS DUMONT NO. 9. 

M. Santos Dumont has, of course, been well to the fore, and though 
he has only been using his little iSIo. 9 balloon, which may be likened 
to a motor bicycle as compared to a large motor car, 3^et he has been 
able to steer this apparatus and drive it about so easily that the 
accounts of his trips read as if practical aerial navigation had been 
achieved. But, so far as his particular performances go, we are still 
some way from this. It has only been during the calmest of weather 
that he has dared to venture forth, f(jr his little 3-horsepower engine is 
incapable of propelling the vessel at any great speed. This machine is of 
a pointed ovoid shape, the length being 49 feet and the greatest diam- 
eter 18 feet. This compact form gives better sta])ility than the more 
usual cigar shape, if it detracts from speed. The volume of the main 
gas vessel is 9,200 cubic feet; but this does not imply that so nuich gas 
is available for levitation, for of this 1,566 cubic feet is occupied by 
the "ballonet," which is kept partially full of air by a ventilating 
fan, so as to keep the whole balloon tightly distended. Along each 
side of the balloon a strip of canvas is sewn, in which is inclosed a 
number of short battens of wood, and from slings attached to these 
some 46 steel wires depend to support the frame. The latter, which 
is 29 feet long, is composed of pine rods of triangular section, braced 
with steel wires and kept apart by wooden triangles of varying size. 
Toward the front of this frame is the little basket car in which the 
aeronaut stands, and to the after side of this is fixed the motor. This

is a Clement double-cjdinder, air-cooled, petrol engine, weighing 15ut 
20.-1: i)ound.s and developing 8 horsepower, or les.s than pounds per 
horsepower. The fly wheel is formed of a bicycle wheel, which weighs 
under 2 pounds and makes 1,600 revohitions. The steel shaft runs 
back from the motor to the propeller in rear. This is two-bladed, 
formed'of steel tu))es, covered with tightlv stretched oiled silk. The 
propeller is 10 feet in diameter and 15 inches in greatest width. It 
weighs 2-1 pounds and makes 2(»(» revohitions per minute, giving a 
thrust of ."iO to ()(» pounds. The ])alloon itself weighs only 30 pounds, 
and the whole apparatus, with framework, car, motor, etc., is under 
200 pounds. A tapering trail rope, lOO feet long, hangs from the 
front of the l)alloon and is supported by a pulley under the rear end 
of the frame, so that the balance can be regulated. A large rudder, 
of 85 square feet, is placed under the after end of the balloon. 

SANTOS DUMON'T NO. 10. 

The large Santos Dumont No. 10, the "Omnibus," of which a good 
deal has been heard, has not yet left its shed. Though it has been 
practically ready for some weeks, there seems to be some doul)t as to 
how it ma}" l)ehave, and with so large a machine it does not do to run 
any risks. This new machine is far bigger than an}^ of this aeronaut's 
former ])alloons, l)eing nearly 200 feet long, and having a capacity of 
about To.ooo cubic feet. It is supposed to take 14 passengers, who are 
carried in three baskets hung below the long frame. The vessel is to 
be propelled by two screws, one at each end of the frame, and these are 
driven ))}' a motor of 60 horsepower. A number of horizontal aero- 
planes are arranged between the frame and the balloon, to aid in rais- 
ing and lowering the apparatus. 

SPENCER'S BALLOON. 

In England we have also had an experiment with an air ship. Mr. 
Stanley Spencer constructed a new balloon, 93 feet long and 24: feet 
maxinuun diameter, containing 30,000 cubic feet. Below this was 
suspended a framework, similar to that used in the Santos Dumont 
balloons, 5(> feet in length and stayed 4 feet apart by triangles of 
bamboo. The engine was a Sinuns motor of 24 horsepower. A screw 
propeller, 12 feet in diameter, was placed in front and a large rudder 
behind. On its lirst trial, however, the machine did not prove a suc- 
cess, failing to lift. We may look forward to a better result in future 
experiments. 

DEUTSCH'S BALLOON. 

Another large machine which is practically ready, and has been for 
some time, but which also seems to hesitate about starting on its 
maiden voyage, is the " Ville de Paris,'' belonging to M. Deutsch and 
designed by M. Tatin. The general design of this vessel is very much 



PROGRESS WITH AIR SHIPS. 169 

the jsauie u,s that of M. Santos Dumont, but it has one or two peculi- 
arities worth noting. Instead of the ordinary net, the balloon is cov- 
ered with a "■ chemise" of unvarnished silk, to the lower edges of which 
a continuous boarding is attached. A squiire rudder is placed in rear, 
suspended from the end of a triangular framework. The screw, of 
the same form as the Santos Dumont, is 22 feet in diameter. 

LEBAUDY'S BALLOON. 

But of greater interest still is the air ship of Messrs. Lebaudy, 
which is kept ready inflated in its shed at Moisson. This is probald}' 
the most successful aerial machine ever made. It has now accom- 
plished 2U voyages, in all of Avhich, with one exception, it has suc- 
cessfully returned to its point of departure. As comparatively few 
details have been hitherto published about this machine, it may be 
interesting to give some. The gas vessel is long and finely pointed 
at the ends, and contains 80,000 cubic feet. It is composed of two 
thicknesses of cloth with a layer of India rubber in between, and the 
whole is painted bright yellow. The arrangement, designed by M. 
elulliot, is quite different to that adopted by so man}' other inventors. 
There is no long framework suspended below the balloon, but the 
lower surface of the latter is made flat, and a frame of steel tubing 
surrounds this plane. From the front part of this six steel tubes run 
diagonally down to the car, so as to convey the thrust of the propel- 
lers to the balloon, the car being supported l)y a number of steel-wire 
ropes. Below the plane is arranged a keel, consisting of a framework 
of steel tubing, covered along the after half of it with canvas. This 
keel is continued far away to the rear, where it ends with the rudder. 
Under the flat part of the balloon is a layer of uninflamabic material, 
and all the portion above it is occupied by the air-tilled ballonet, so 
that there is very little danger of the gas becoming ignited from the 
engines. The two safety valves to ease the pressure of the gas are 
also placed well out of reach behind. 

The car consists of a boat-shaped frame of steel, partially covered 
in at the sides with canvas, the after part being left open, so as not to 
ofl'er any resistance to the air. The engine, a Mercedes, of -id horse- 
power, is placed in the center, the shaft running horizontally across 
and geared at right angles to the two propellers. The latter are 2.44 m. 
in diameter, and each consists of a steel bar, to which is tixed a thin 
plate of steel of a width equal to one-sixteenth of the circumference. 
These comparatively small propellers rotate at a considerable speed — 
about 1,(»00 turns per minute. 

In the front i)art of the car, where the aeronaut in charge stands, 
may be seen the steering wheel, similar to that of a motor car. This 
is connected by means of an endless chain and wires to the rudder. 
Above this are the pressure gauges to show the compression of the

gas and of the air in the ballonet. To the aeronaut's left (in the 
photograph he is turned a))out) is the ventilator fan, driven by a belt 
from the engine, ^vhich drives air through the pipe up into this bal- 
lonet. To his right is a metal funnel, eontinued below the car, in 
which to empty the sand ballast, so as not to allow any dust to get 
into the engine. The engineer sits in rear of the motor, and here is 
to be seen another of the precautionary measures which are so abund- 
antly provided. The white square seen in the photograph in rear of 
the engines is a thin plate of metal to protect the engineer in case of 
anything going wrong with the screw, a detached portion of which, 
traveling at so great a speed, might do nmch damage. Below the back 
of the car is the exhaust from the engine, the opening of which is 
inclosed in a l)all of wire gauze. A store of oil to last lifteen hours is 
carried under the car. A small extincteur is carried in case of fire. 

It is with some surprise that one notices how very strongly and 
solidly all these parts are constructed. Aluminum is conspicuous by 
its absence, everything is made of steel, and there seems no attempt 
to make it specially light. 

The entire weight lifted l)y the balloon, incduding passengers, is 
given as 5,700 pounds. 

The shed in which this enormous vessel is housed is also very well 
constructed. It is of wood, Avell stayed and trussed, with huge doors 
across one end. The floor is cemented, a well being made in the cen- 
ter for the car to rest in. The arrangements for guiding the airship 
out of the shed are vevy neat. Along each side of the hall, and along 
the center, run double rails close together. Four guy ropes depend 
from the balloon, two on each side. These end with an iron ring and 
ball, which ball is gripped by the rails, a similar ball is attached to the 
bottom of the car and is held by the third pair of rails. When the 
vessel is to be taken out, a man stands to each of the rings and slides 
it along the rails. The rails are continued outside the building, so 
that even when the machine is well outside, it is still secured b}' the 
gu3^s. When all is ready to start, the ropes are detached from the 
rings and the balloon is free. 

As regards tne journe}' s actually made, the first proper ascent was 
efiected on April 11, Avhen the machine rose at 8.15 a. m. and remained 
up for half an hour, covering in that time 19 kilometers. Later in 
the same daj" it made a second ascent, and stayed up for an hour. On 
Ma}^ 8 an important journey was made, the air ship proceeding to the 
town of Mantes, 10 kilometers distant, where it went through various 
evolutions, went on to Rosny, and then returned to its shed at Moisson, 
completing altogether some 23 miles in an hour and a half. On a later 
occasion even this record was beaten, the machine going a journey 
lasting two and three-quarter hours, and traversing* over 61 miles. 
These trips were not, apparently, made during the most favorable

weather, for on the jouriie}" to Mantes it was said that rain, accom- 
panied ])y a considerable wind, prevailed. 

The greatest speed recorded is 11.80 meters per second (or over 25 
miles per hour). Ascents have been made at all times of day, from -i 
o'clock in the morning to 8 o'clock at night, even in fog and in frost. 
The balloon has recently remained for one hundred and ninety-sijc days 
inflated. The ascents were all conducted by the aeronaut, M. Juchmes. 

BARTON'S BALLOON. 

Another large air ship, though it has not at the time of writing yet 
made an ascent, should be nearly' read}^ for its initial trials. This 
machine is very different in design to those I hiive just described. 
The shape of the gas vessel is to be somewhat like that of a shell, that 
is to say, C3'lindrical, with an ogival head and a blunt stern. Schwarz's 
balloon was roughh' of this shape. It is composed of well-varnished 
silk, and will have a "chemise" of similar fabric unvarnished to go 
over the top instead of a net. Portions of the envelope, especially at 
the head, are stiffened with bamboo ril)s. The balloon is about 170 
feet long and some .50 feet in diameter. Underneath this is suspended 
a huge framework of stout l)amboos, lashed together and trussed with 
wire stays. This is 140 feet long, and supports a deck which can be 
walked along from end to end. There are three separate engines, each 
of 50 horsepower. There are to be three pairs of propellers, each 
having several superposed blades. One of the main features of the 
apparatus is a series of aeroplanes, which are to assist the horizontal 
stability and the raising and lowering of the machine. The whole air 
ship is very ])ig and cuml)ersome, but it has very powerful engines. 
If anything should go wrong with the latter, however, it will be a 
difficult balloon to manage. 

OTHER AIR SHIPS. 

An enormous machine is being constructed in San Francisco for 
Mr. Stanle}". It is to be made almost entireh' of aluminum. The 
shape is cylindrical, with conical ends, and it is 228 feet long. Pro- 
pellers are to be fixed at each end as well as on the top, the latter being 
to regulate the rise and fall. It is supposed to take ''at least 30 pas- 
sengers." Another machine, but of more ordinar}' dimensions, is 
nearing completion in London. Mr. Beedle, the inventor, proposes to 
place a propeller at each end of the frame, but the front one is to be 
so arranged that its axis can be turned to one side to guide the vessel. 
It contains 2I:,000 cubic feet, and ^"-^ engines of 1C> horsepower. 



ap:rial navigation. <' 



ByO. ClIAXUTE, (Itiriujo, III. 



There are now dawnings of two possible solutions of the prol)lem 
of aerial navigation, a pi'obleni which has impassioned men foi- per- 
haps four thousand or live thousand years. Navigii))le l)alloons have 
recently l)een developed to what is believed to be nearly the limit of 
their efficiency, and after three intellio-cMit but unfortunate attempts 
by others a successful dynamic tlying machine seems to have been 
produced ])y the Messrs. Wright. 

It is therefore interesting to review the present status of the ques- 
tion, the prospects of its solution, and the probable uses of the hoped- 
for air slii])s. 

BALLOONS. 

As to balloons, we may pass over the early gropings and failures to 
make them navigable. It was recognized very soon that the spherical 
balloon was tlie sport of the wind; that it was necessary to elongate it 
in order to evade the resistance t)f the air, and that, inasnuich as aerial 
currents are nuich more rapid than acpieous currents, it was necessary 
to obtain considerable speeds in order to have a useful air ship. This 
means that there nuist be great driving power and that this power 
shall weigh as little as possible, for in any case the balloon itself, with 
its adjuncts and passengers, will absorl) the greater part of its lifting 
power. 

Gitfard was the tirst to apply, in ltSr)2, an artificial motor to an elon- 
gated balloon. This motor consisted in a steam engine of o horse- 
power, which weighed with its appurtenances 402 pounds, and Gifl'ard 
o})tained only (J. 71 miles per hour, although his balloon was l-i-l feet 
long- and 39 feet in diameter, or about the size of a tramp steamer. 

Dupuy de Lome in 1872 went up with a balloon 118 feet long and 
49 feet in diameter, but, having a wholesome dread of the contiguity 
of fire and inflammable gas, he emploj^ed man power (weighing- about 
2,000 pounds to the horsepower) to drive his screws, and he obtained

less speed than Giffard. The accidents to Wolfert and to De Bradsky 
have since shown the soundness of his fears. 

Next came Tissandier, in 1884, Avho employed an electric motor of 
1^ horsepower, weighing some (>16 pounds, Avith which he attained 
7.82 miles per hour. 

Meanwhile the French war department toolc up the pro])lem. It 
availed itself of the labors of the previous experimenters and made 
careful and costly investigations of the best modes of consti'uction, 
of the best shapes to cleave the air, and of the weight and efficiency of 
motors. This cuhuinated in 188.5, when Messrs. Renard and Krebs, of 
the aeronautical section, brought out tlie war balloon "La France," 
which attained about 14 miles an hour (or half the speed of a trotting 
horse) and returned to its shed live times out of the seven occasions 
on which it was publicly taken out. 

This air ship was 165 feet long, 27i feet in diameter, and was pro- 
vided with an electric motor of 9 horsepower, weighing Avitli its appur- 
tenances some 1,174 pounds. The longitudinal section was parabolic, 
somewhat like a cigar rolled to a sharp point at ])oth ends, the largest 
cross section being one-fourth of the distance from the front, and it 
wasdriven, l)lunt end foremost, bj^ a screw attached at the front of 
the car. No better shape and arrangement have yet l)een devised, and 
subsequent experimenters who have wandered away tlierefrom have 
achieved inferior results, so far as the coefficient of resistance is 
concerned. 

In 1893 the French war department l)uilt the "General Meusnier," 
named after an aeronautical officer of extraordinary merit of the tirst 
French Eepa])lic. This war balloon is said to be 230 feet long, 80 
feet in diameter. 120.000 cu})ic feet in capacit}', and to have l)een orig- 
inally provided with a gasoline motor of 45 horsepower. It is said 
by all the writers on the subject that it was never taken out. Possibly 
the French were waiting for a war which fortunately never came; but, 
be this as it may, it is prol)a]de that with the reduction which has since 
taken place in gasoline motors this l)alloon could carry an engine of 
some 70 horsepower, and attain a speed of about 30 miles an hour, 
which is greater than that of trans-Atlantic steamers. 

Some imsuccessful experiments were carried on in Germany in 
1897, first b}' Doctor Wolfert, whose balloon was set on fire b}" his 
gasoline motor and exploded in the air, killing ))oth himself and his 
engineer, and later by Schwarz, whose aluminum ])alloon proved 
unmanagea]>le and was smashed in landing. The most aml^itious 
attempt, how^ever, was that of Count Zeppelin, who built in 1900, a 
monster air-ship 420 feet long and 39 feet in diameter. It was a 
cylinder with paral)oloid ends, but the shape was inferior and almost 
all the lifting power was frittered away on an internal frame of alumi- 
num, so that the gasoline motor could be of only 32 horsepower, and 



AERIAL NAVIGATION. 175 

the speed attained has variously been stated at 8 to IM niile« per hour. 
Nevertheless the design of Count Zeppelin contained many excellent 
features, and a movement is now on foot in Germany to enable him to 
try again, throug'h means of a popular subscription. The mere size, 
if he builds again as large, is a great element of success, for as the 
cubic contents and lift increase as the cube of the dimensions, while 
the weights increase in a far smaller ratio, a l)alloon of this g-reat size 
ought to be able to lift a very powerful motor, and to attain a speed 
of 30 or more miles per hour. He has shown that the size is not 
beyond the possibilit}' of control. 

Meanwhile gasoline motors had been increasing in efficiency and 
diminishing in weight. The French war department gave no sign and 
it was reserved for a Brazilian, Mr, Santos Dumont, to show to the 
Parisians what could l)e accom])lished by equipping an air ship with a 
gasoline motor. The history of his triumphs is so present to all minds 
that it need only be alluded to, l)ut it may be interesting to give some 
details of the sizes and arrangments of his various balloons. His first 
idea seems to have been that, in order to make it managea))le, a balloon 
should ])e made as small as possible, and that it was practicable to 
disencumber it of many adjuncts hitherto considered indispensable. 
Neglecting- to stud}" carefully what had been found out by his prede- 
cessors, he had to learn by experience, and he built five balloons, all 
navigaldes, before he produced, in 1901, his No. 6, with which he won 
the Deutsch prize b}^ sailing 3i miles and return in half an hour. 
This balloon was 108 feet long, 20 feet in diameter, and was provided 
with a gasoline motor of 10 horsepower which might be driven up to 
18 or 20 horsepower. While the speed over the ground was 11 miles 
an hour, retarded as it was hy a light Avind, the speed through the air 
was about 19 miles an hour, a small but marked advance over any 
previous performance; but the result would have been still better if 
the shape had been that of Colonel Renard's balloon. 

Since then Mr. Santos Dumont has luiilt four new navigable balloons: 
His No. 7, with which he expects to compete at St. Louis in 1901, is 
160 feet long and 23 feet in diameter, and is to be provided with a 
motor of 60 horsepower; his No. 8, which was sold to parties in New 
York last year; his No. 9, which is his visiting balloon, being only 50 
feet long and 18 feet in diameter and provided with a 3-horsepower 
motor. Its speed is onl}" 10 miles an hour, but it is handy to ride 
ai"oiuid to breakfast or afternoon teas. He is now finishing his No. 10, 
the ()nuii])us, which is 157 feet long and 28 feet in diameter, with a 
motor of 16 horsepower. Fares are to be charged for by the pound 
of passenger when it comes out next spring. 

Emulators of Santos Dumont there have been that have come to 
grief. Mr. iioze built in 1901 a catamaran consisting of two twin 
balloons, which, although 118 feet long, failed to raise their own 



176 AERIAL NAVIGATION. 

weight sei'viceab]3\ Mr. Severo built in ]'H)2 a navigable balloon 
which was so injudiciously constructed that the car l)roke away in the 
air, and the inventor was killed as well as his engineer. Later in the 
same year De Bradsky built a navigable balloon equipped with a gaso- 
line motor located so near the vent for the gas that the latter took 
tire, exploded the balloon, and the inventor and his engineer were 
killed, thus for the second time verifying the fears of the experts who 
discountenanced this combination. 

Some meritorious projects have been published, but not yet carried 
out. Among these may be mentioned that of Mr. Yon, now deceased, 
and that of Mr. Louis (xodard. The latter project was for a ])alloou 
180 feet long and 30 feet in diameter, with two steam motors of 50 
horsepower each. It was expected to attain a speed of Hi) miles per 
hour. 

One naviga])le balloon which was built this year, that of the Lebaudy 
brothers, has achieved a great success. It is 185 feet long, 32 feet in 
diameter, and is equipped with a gasoline motor of 40 horsepower. 
It has beaten the speed of Santos Dumont, having on many occasions, 
it is said, attained 21 miles an hour. 

There is also a navigable balloon being built in Paris ))y Mr. Tatin 
for Mr. Deutsch, the donor of the famous prize. This is 183 feet 
long, 27 feet in diameter, and is ecjuipped with a gasoline motor of 60 
horsepower. 

Besides these there are said to be a number of navigable balloons 
either being built or proposed in France. The}' are those of the 
Marquis de Dion, of Fillet & Ilobert, of Girardot, of Boisset, and of 
Bourgoin, l)ut there is no telling how many of them will materialize. 

These are all French balloons, while there are in England the balloon 
of Mr. Spencer, 93 feet by 21 feet, with nominally 21 horsepower; of 
Mr. Beedle, 93 feet by 21 feet, with 12 horsepower, and that of Doctor 
Barton, now in construction, with dimensions of 170 feet in length, 
40 feet in diameter, and equipped with a number of aeroplanes and 
three gasoline motors of 50 horsepower each. It is a question 
whether the weight of the aeroplanes will leave sufficient margin to 
lift 150 horsepower. 

The ultimate practicable size for balloons is not yet known, but the 
mathematics of the subject are now tolerably well understood. The 
larger the balloon the more speed it can attain, and it is possible to 
design it so that the results shall not be disappointing. Those inventors 
who expect to attain 70 to 100 miles an hour ])y some happ}^ combina- 
tion do not know what they are talking about. 

It is interesting to speculate which of the above-mentioned navi- 
gable balloons would, if competing, stand a chance of winning the 
$100,000 prize which has been offered by the St. Louis exposition of 
1901. So far as can now be discerned, the only vessels which are 



AEEIAL NAViaATION. 177 

likely to develop the required minimum speed of 20 miles an hour over 
the oround, which speed really requires about 25 miles an hour through 
the air, as there will almost invariably be some Avind, will be the San- 
tos Dumont No. 7, the Lebaudy and the Deutsch air ships, all of them 
French. The English vessels of Spencer and of Beedle are too small 
to lift sutticient power to drive them at 25 miles an hour. The balloon 
of Doctor Barton might gain this speed if it were not 40 feet in diam- 
eter, besides being loaded down with aeroplanes, and it remains to be 
seen what will be the effect of this combination. The American air 
ships all seem to l)e too small to lift enough power to give them the 
required speed save the Stanley air ship, 228 feet by 50 feet in diam- 
eter, begun in San Francisco. Should this be completed in time, and 
should the weights be kept approximately near those stated in the 
circulars, it might have a chance to obtain 25 miles an hour, but it 
would need more than three times the 50 horsepower contemplated in 
order to do so, and the weight of the aluminum shell and framing 
would probably absorb much of the lifting power. 

FLYING MACHINES. 

If the aeronautical contest at St. Louis were scheduled to take place 
a few \'ears later, thus giving time to consummate recent success, it is 
not improbable that the main prize would be carried off' by a flying- 
machine. This yet lacks the safe flotation in the air which appertains 
to balloons, but it promises to be eventually very nmch faster. 

The writer found, somewhat to his surprise, when on a visit to 
Paris last April, that a decided reaction had set in among the French 
against balloons. It seemed to be realized that the limit of speed had 
been nearly reached for the present, and that )mt small utility was to 
be expected from navigable balloons. They must be large, costly, and 
require expensive housing, while thev are slow and frail and carry 
very small loads. As commercial carriers they are not to be thought 
of, but they may be useful in war and in exploration. 

Hence the French are turning their thoughts toward aviation and 
propose to repeat some of the experiments with gliding machines 
which have taken place in America. Even Colonel Renard, the cele- 
brated pioneer of the modern navigable balloon, is now said to have 
become a convert to aviation and to say that the time has come to try 
the system of combined aeroplanes and lifting screws for flying 
apparatus. 

A good deal of experimenting has been done with power-driven 
flying models. The more recent types have been actuated by twisted 
rubber threads, by compressed air and by steam, and the most notable 
experiments in order of date are those of Penaud, Tatin, Hargrave, 
Phillips, Langley and Tatin, and Richet. The data of these (except 
the tirst) will be found by searchers in such matters in the London 



178 AERIAL NAVIGATION. 

Times edition of the Enc3^cloptedia Britannica, in the article on 
aeronautics. Tlie most successful experiment Avas that of Professor 
Lang-ley, who ol)tained in 1896 three flights of about three-fourths of 
a mile each with steam-driven models, the apparatus alighting safely 
each time and being in condition to be flown again. 

The one great fact which appears from all these various model 
experiments is that it requires a relatively enormous power to obtain 
support on the air. Omitting the cases in which the power was prob- 
ably overestimated, the weights sustained were but 30 to 55 pounds to 
the horsepower expended, thus comparing most unfavorabl}' with the 
weights transported by land or b}^ water; for a locomotive can haul 
about -1,000 pounds to the horsepower upon a level track, and a 
steamer can propel a displacement of -1,000 pounds per horsepower on 
the water at a speed of 11 miles an hour. 

But models are, to a certain extent, misleading. They seldom fly 
twice alike and the}^ do not unfold the vicissitudes of their flight. 
Moreover, the design for a small model is sometimes quite unsuited 
for a large machine, just as the design for a bridge of 10 feet opening 
is unsuited for a span of one hundred feet. 

After experimenting with models three celebrated inventors have 
passed on to full-sized machines to carry a man. They are Maxim, 
Ader, and Langley, and all three have been unsuccessful, simply 
because their apparatus did not possess the required stability. They 
might have flown had the required equilibrium and strength been duly 
provided. 

At a cost of about $100,000, Sir Hiram Maxim built and tested in 
1891 an enormous flying machine, to carry three men. It consisted 
in a combination of superposed aeroplanes, portions of which bagged 
under air pressure, and it was driven b}^ two screws 17 feet 10 inches 
in diameter, actuated by a steam engine of 363 horsepower with steam 
at 275 pounds pressure. The supporting surface was about 1:,000 
square feet, and the weight 8,000 pounds. The machine ran on a 
track of 8-feet gauge, and was prevented from unduly rising by a 
track above it of 30-feet gauge. At a speed of 36 miles per hour all 
the weight was sustained by the air, and on the last test the lifting 
effect became so great that the rear axle trees were doubled up, and 
finally one of the front wheels tore up about 100 feet of the upper 
track, when steam was shut oft' and the machine dropped to the ground 
and was broken. Its short flight disclosed that its stability was im- 
perfect and Sir Hiram Maxim has not 3'et undertaken the construction 
of the improved machine which he is understood to have had under 
contemplation. 

Having already built, in 1872 and 1891, two full-sized flying machines 
with doubtful results, Mr. Ader, a French electrical inventor, ])uilt, in 
1897, a third machine at a cost of about $100,000 furnished by the 



AERIAL NAVIGATION. 179 

French war department. It was like a great bird, with 270 feet sup- 
porting surface and 1,100 pounds weight, being driven by a pair of 
screws actuated by a steam engine of 10 horsepower, which weighed 
about 7 pounds per horsepower. Upon being tested under the super- 
vision of the French army officers, the equilibrium was found so 
defective that further advance of funds was refused. The amount 
lifted per horsepower was 27 pounds. 

The data for the full-sized flying machine of Professor Langley, 
tested October 7 and December S, 1903, have not yet been published. 
From newspaper photographs it appears to be an amplification of the 
models which flew successfully^ in 1896, and this, necessarily, would 
make it very frail. The failures, however, seem to have been caused 
by the launching gear and do not prove that this machine is useless. 
Like the failures of Maxim and of Ader, it does indicate that a better 
design must be sought for, and that the first requisites are that the 
machine shall be stable in the air, shall be quite under the control of 
its operator, and that he, paradoxical as it may appear, shall have 
acquired thorough experience in managing it before he attempts to fly 
with it. 

This was the kind of practical efficiency acquired by the Wright 
brothers, whose flying machine was successful!}^ tested on the 17th 
of December. For three years they experimented with gliding 
machines, as will be described further on, and it was only after they 
had obtained thorough command of their movements in the air that 
they ventured to add a motor. How they accomplished this must be 
reserved for them to explain, as they are not 3^et ready to make known 
the construction of their machine nor its mode of operation. Too 
much praise can not be awarded to these gentlemen. Being accom- 
plished mechanics, they designed and built the apparatus, appl3nng 
thereto a new and effective mode of control of their own. The}^ 
learned its use at considerable personal risk of accident. They planned 
and built the motor, having found none in the market deemed suitable. 
They evolved a novel and superior form of propeller; and all this was 
done with their own hands, without financial help from anybod3\ 

Meantime it is interesting to trace the evolution which has led to 
this result and the successive steps which have been taken by others. 

It is not enough to design and build an adequate flying machine; 
one must know how to use it. There is a bit of tuition which most of 
us have seen — that of the parent birds teaching their 3'Oung to fl3' — 
which demonstrates this proposition. Even with thousands of years' 
evolution and heredity, with adequate fl3ing organs, the birdlings need 
instruction and experience. 

Safety is the all-important requisite. It is indispensable to have a 
flying machine which shall be stable in the air and to learn to master 
its management. Nothing but practice, practice, practice will gain 



180 AEEIAL NAVIGATION. 

the hitter, and upon this the school of Lilienthal and his followers is 
founded. 

Otto Lilienthal was a German engineer of great originalit}' and 
talent, who, after making very valuable researches, assisted by his 
brother, published a book in 1SS!», Der Vogelflug als Grundlage der 
Fliegekunst, which it is very desira])lo to have translated and pub- 
lished for the benefit of English investigators. Then, putting his 
theories to the test of practice, he built, from 18*U to I-Six;, a number 
of aeroplane machines with which ho diligently trained himself in 
gliding flight, using gravity for a motive power, by starting from hill- 
sides. He grew exceedingly expert, and made, it is said, more than 
2,000 flights, until one rueful da}' (August !», iSiH)) he was upset and 
killed by a wind gust, probablj^ in conse(|uence of having allowed his 
apparatus to get out of order. 

He was followed })v ]\Ir. Tilcher, an English marine engineer, who 
slighth^ improved the api)aratus, l>ut ^v•ho, after making many hundred 
glides, was also upset and killed in October, 1899, through structural 
weakness of his machine. 

The basis for the equilibrium of an apparatus gliding upon the air 
being that the center of gravity shall l)c on the same vertical line as 
the center of air pressure, ))oth Lilienthal and Pilcher reestablished 
this condition l)y moving their bodily weight to the same extent that 
the center of pressui'e varied through the turmoils of the wind. The 
writer ventured to think this method erroneous, and proposed to 
reverse it l)y causing the surfaces themselves to alter their position, so 
as to bring the center of pressure back vertically over the center 
of gravity. He began experimentally with man-carrying gliding 
machines in June, 1896, and has since built six machines of Ave dif- 
ferent t^'pes, with three of which several thousand glides have been 
efl'ected without anv accidents. The first was a Lilienthal machine, in 
order to test the known before passing to the unknown, and this was 
discarded some six weeks before LilienthaTs sad accident. 

With three of the other machines favorable results were obtained. 
The best were with the "two-surface" machine, equipped with an 
elastic rudder attachment designed by Mr. Herring, and this was 
described and figured in the Aeronautical Annual for 1897. 

Three years later Messrs. Wilbur and Orville Wright took up the 
pro))lem afresh and have worked independently. These gentlemen 
have placed the rudder in front, where it proves more efi'ective than 
in the rear, and have placed the operator horizontall}^ on the machine, 
thus diminishing by four-fifths the resistance of the man's body from 
that which obtained with their predecessors. In 1900, 1901, 1902, and 
1903 they made thousands of glides without accidents, and even suc- 
ceeded in hovering in the air for a minute and more at a time. They 
had obtained almost complete mastery over their apparatus before they 



AERIAL NAVIGATION. 181 

ventured to add the motor and propeller. This, in the judgment of 
the present writer, is the only course of training by which others ma}'^ 
hope to accomplish success. It is a mistake to undertake too much at 
once and to design and build a full-sized flying machine ab initio, for 
the motor and propeller introduce complications which had best be 
avoided until in the vicissitudes of the winds bird craft has been 
learned with gravity as a motive power. 

Now that an initial success has been achieved with a flying machine, 
we can discern some of the uses of such apparatus, and also some of 
its limitations. It doubtless will require some time and a good deal of 
experimenting, not devoid of danger, to develop the machine to prac- 
tical utility. Its flrst application will probabl}' be military, ^^^e can 
conceive how useful it might be in surveying a Held of battle, or in 
patrolling mountains and jungles over which ordinary means of con- 
veyance are difficult. In reaching otherwise inaccessible places, such 
as clifi's, in convejdng messages, perhaps in carrying life lines to 
wrecked vessels, the fl3'ing machine may prove preferable to existing 
methods, and it ma}"" even carry mails in special cases, but the useful 
loads carried will be very small. The machines will eventually be 
fast, they will be used in sport, but they are not to he thought of as 
commercial carriers. To say nothing of the danger, the sizes must 
remain small and the passengers few, because the weight will, for the 
same design, increase as the cube of the dimensions, while the sup- 
porting surfaces will onl}^ increase as the square. It is true that when 
higher speeds become safe it will require fewer square feet of surface 
to carry a man, and that dimensions will actually decrease, but this 
will not be enough to carry nuich greater extraneous loads, such as a 
store of explosives or big guns to shoot them. The power required 
will always be great, say something like one horsepower to every 
hundred pounds of weight, and hence fuel can not be carried for long- 
single journeys. The north pole and the interior of Sahara may pre- 
serve their secrets a while longer. 

Upon the whole, navigable ])alloons and flying machines will con- 
stitute a great mechanical triumph for man, but they will not mate- 
rially upset existing conditions as has sometimes been predicted. 
Their design and performance will doubtless be improved from time 
to time, and they will probably develop new uses of their own which 
have not vet been thought of. 



GRAHAM BELL'S TETRAHEDRAL KITES. « 



In the June number of the National Geographic Mag-azine (Wash- 
ington, D. C.) is a very interesting and instructive artick^, by Dr. Gra- 
ham Bell on the tetrahedral principle in kite structure. The article 
itself is so concise and depends so much upon illustrations, which are 
reproduced to the number of 20 in the text and 70 in the Appendix, 
that an effective representation of the contents in an article of smaller 
dimensions is scarcely possible. Still the line of thought that runs 
thi'ough the work which the article represents is so clear and so sug- 
gestive that even an imperfect outline of it may be useful. Doctor 
Bell indicates certain stages in the development of his ideas as "mile- 
stones" of progress, and since the ultimate stage of the development 
is the possibility of building up very large kite structures by combin- 
ing unit cells in such a way that the proportion of weight to wing 
area in the structure is nearly the same as that of the constituent cell 
the successive stages are noteworthy. They sketch out in a most 
interesting manner a reply to Newcomb's criticism of the limits of 
application of the aeroplane based upon the argument that increase 
of size means diminished efficiency because, for similar structures, the 
weight varies as the cuIjc, while the area, upon which the lifting force 
depends, varies as the square of the linear dimensions. 

The original stage, the ordinary kite, is a single plane structure. 
The tirst step in adv^ance is the llargrave box kite, with its upper and 
lower aeroplanes for its support and side planes for stability. To 
stiffen the framework of tiie l)()x kite it nuist ])ebraci'd longitudinally 
and transversely. Accordingly Graham lielTs development commences 
by replacing the rectangular framework of the box kite hy a frame- 
work of triangular section, which is by construction stiff so far as the 
cross section is concerned. The inclined sides are by the vector prin- 
ciple of resolution of forces regarded as equivalent to their geometri- 
cal projections, and, in so far as the principle applies, the inclined

i'ace.s represent the combined effect of aeroplanes of the area of the 
projections.'^ 

The box kite of triangular section is, however, not stiff as regards 
longitudinal shear, and the next "milestone" marks the reduction of 
the triangular or prismatic form to the tetrahedron, an essentially stiff* 
framework for all directions. A tetrahedron of rods with two adja- 
cent faces covered with fabric forms a tetrahedral kite cell which, on 
the principle of projection before referred to, is equivalent to three 
aeroplanes represented by the projections of the covered sides upon 
planes at right angles. 

The further development of pure tetrahedral construction is obvious. 
Four cells can be combined to form a tetrahedron of double linear 
dimensions without additional framework; the weight and wing area 
are both simpl}' proportional to the number of cells, and not to the 
linear dimensions. For each set of four cells thus combined there is 
an octahedral free space in the interior which corresponds to the free 
space ])etwcen the two cells of the Hargrave kite. The tetrahedral 
kites that have the largest central spaces preserve their equilibrium 
best in the air. 

Combining 4 multiple cells to till the outline of a tetrahedron of 
double size, again, we get a 16-cell kite, and repeating the process 
again a 64-cell kite, occupying a tetrahedron eight times the dimen- 
sions of a single cell. The building up of multicellular kites from 
the units is represented in the figures here reproduced from illustra- 
trations in Doctor Bell's article. Fig. 1, PI. I, represents the unit 
cell; fig. 2 a combination of 4 cells; fig. 3 of 64 cells. 

The kites fl}" with the points of the wings upward; the line of junc- 
tion of the covered faces of the tetrahedron forms a kind of keel. No 
details as to the heights attainable are given. The most convenient 
place for the attachment of the fl.ying end is said to be the extreme 
point of the bow. If the cord is attached to points successively farther 
back on the keel, the fl3"ing end makes a greater and greater angle 
with the horizon, and the kite flies more nearly overhead; but it is not 
advisable to carry the point of attachment as far back as the middle 
of the keel. A good place for high flights is a point halfway between 
the bow and the middle of the keel. 

"Tetrahedral kites combine in a marked degree the qualities of 
strength, lightness, and stead}^ flight; but further experiments are 
required before deciding that this form is the best for a kite or that 

«This principle to be generally applicable would require the normal component of 
wind pressure to be uniform and independent of the angle between the plane and 
the wind. This is not the case with an aeroplane (see Eayleigli, Nature, vol. xxv, 
p. 108); and for the principle to be applied api^roximately in the case of the kites 
some convention as regards the angle of exposure of the aeroplanes to the wind 
would be required.

winged cells without horizontal aeroplanes constitute the best arrange- 
ment of aero-surfaces. 

"The tetrahedral principle enables us to construct out of light mate- 
rials solid frameworks of almost any desired form, and the resulting 
structures arc admirably adapted for the support of aero-surfaces of 
any desired kind, size, or shape." 

The diagrams illustrating the article show various examples of the 
formation of complex kites from tetrahedral cells. One form sug- 
gested by Professor Langley's aerodrome, but different in construc- 
tion and appearance, is shown in fig. 4, reproduced from an illustration 
in the article. That some of these complex kites are on a very large 
scale is evident from a case cited, in which an aerodrome kite, which 
was struck by a squall before it was let go, lifted two men off their 
feet, and subsequently broke its fljang cord, a Manila rope of three- 
eighths inch diameter. 

The simplicitv of the construction of the cells, and the obvious pos- 
sibilities of their combination, lend an additional fascination to a sub- 
ject which is already full of interest.

]\I. Becfiuorel discovered in ISlx; that uraniimi and its products emit 
spontaneously radiations which, like the Kontgen rays, are photo- 
graphically active, augment the electrical conductivity of the air 
through which the>' pass, traverse black paper and thin sheets of metal

Compounds of thorium emit radiations analogous in their proper- 
ties, and of comparable intensity/ The radiations thus spontaneously 
emitted by certain substances received the name "Becquerel rays," 
and we are accustomed to speak of the substances emitting them as 
radio-active. 

Madame Curie and myself have discovered new radio-active sub- 
stances existing in minute quantities in certain minerals, but possess- 
ing the property of radio-activity in a ver}" high degree. We have 
separated the radio-active substance polonium, analogous to bismuth 
in its chemical reactions, and radium'' which more resembles barium. 
M. Debierne has since separated actinium, which is a radio-active sub- 
stance to be classed chemically with the rare earths.' 

Polonium, radium, and actinium emit radiations of an order of inten- 
sity a million times higher than those emitted by uranium and thorium, 
and have enabled physicists ta conduct many investigations of the 
phenomena of radio-activity within the past few years. The present 
j)aper is contined to the description of radium, which we have proved 
to be a new element, and have succeeded in isolating in the form of a 
pure salt.' This is the substance which has been most widely used in 
researches on radio-activity.

II. 

The radiations of radium produce pliotographic impressions very 
quickly, and are able to penetrate any screen whatsoever. Bodies 
differ in transparency, but no screen is absolutely opaque to radium ' 
ra3's. 

The radiations of radium excite phosphorescence in a great numl>er 
of bodies, including, among others, the following: Alkaline salts, 
alkaline earths, organic substances, the skin, glass, paper, salts of ura- 
nium, etc., while diamond, plati no-cyanide of barium, and the phos- 
phorescent sulphide of zinc of Sidot are particularly sensitive. The 
luminescence of phosphorescent sulphide of zinc persists for some 
time after the removal of the radium which excites it. 

Radium emits its ra3^s with equal intensity whether immersed in 
liquid air at —180° C. or at ordinar}^ temperatures. When a ]nt of 
radium salt is placed with a little screen of platino-cyanide of barium 
in a test tube and the whole plunged into liquid air, the screen appears 
to glow at least as strongly as before. Under the same circumstances 
a screen of sulphide of zinc loses some of its luminosity, but this is 
owing to the diminished phosphorescent power of this substance at 
low temperatures. 

Little by little phosphorescent substances are altered under the pro- 
longed action of radium and become less readily excited and less 
luminous. 

The salts of radium are spontaneously luminous, and it ma}' be pre- 
sumed that they render themselves phosphorescent })y their own radio- 
activit}'. Radium-chloride and radium-bromide are the most intensely 
luminous of these salts, and may even appear visibly bright in open 
daylight. In these circumstances the light emitted by the radium 
recalls to mind the color of that given by the iirefl}" or glowworm. 
The luminosity of radium salts diminishes with lapse of time, but 
never wholly disappears, and salts at lirst uncolored become at length 
tinged with gray, 3'ellow, or violet. 

III. 

The radiations of radium inqjart electrical conductivity to the air 
through ^hich they pass. When a fragment of radium salt is brought 
near a charged electroscope the latter is inunediately discharged. If 
the electroscope is inclosed by a thick, solid wall the discharge still 
takes place, though more slowly. Lead and platinum are strongly 
absorl)ent, but aluminum is the most transparent of the metals, and 
organic su])stances al)soi'l> relatively little of the Becquerel rays. 

Noncon(hicting li(|ui(ls, such as petroleum ether, sulphide of carbon, 
benzine, and Tuiuid air are rendered conducting under the influence of 
radium."

Under certain conditions the radiations of radium facilitate the pas- 
sage of sparks between two conductors placed in air. This is illus- 
trated by the apparatus shown in tig. 1, consisting of an induction 
coil, B, from the poles, P and P', of which two metallic circuits are 
led to micrometric sparking devices, M and M', at considerable dis- 
tance apart, and offering two distinct paths of equal resistance to the 
passage of sparks. The micrometers 
are adjusted so that each transmits 
equally an al)undance of sparks be- 
tween their terminals. Upon bring- 
ing a fragment of radium near one of 
the micrometers the sparks cease to 
pass at the other. 

It appears to be the most penetra- 
ting rays which are most eti'ective in promoting electrical conductivity, 
for the efficiency of the rays for this purpose is not greatly reduced

portion of the rays is arrested ])y such a screen.

The radiations of radium can be neither reflected nor refracted. 
They form a heterogeneous mixture, separable into three groups, 
which follosving the nomenclature of Rutherford we will designate by 
the Greek letters a^ /i, and y. These groups may be discriminated 

hy the aid of the magnetic 
tield; for in an intense mag- 
netic field the a rays are 
slightly deviated from a 
ivctilinear course in the 
same manner as the "canal 
rays" in vacuum tubes, 
while the /i^ rays are devi- 
ated like the cathode rays, 
and the y rays, like those 
of R(>ntgen, are not devi- 
ated at all."

and directed toward the r?ar of this plane, the /? ra3's are strongly 
deflected toward the right and caused to follow a circular trajectory; 
the a ra3\s are slig-litl}' deviated toward the left, while the y rays, 
which are far the least abundant, continue in a straight line. 

The a rays are of slight penetrating power. A sheet of aluminum 
only a few hundredths of a millimeter in thickness absorbs them. To 
exhibit their deviation a very intense magnetic field is required, and 
the actual demonstration requires a far more delicate method than 
that indicated in lig. 2, which is merely a diagram given in general 
illustration." 

The Of ra3's may 1)(^ compared to projectiles of atomic dimensions 
charged with positive electricity and shot oti' with great velocities. 
Apart from tlicir behavior in a magnetic field, the ot rays may be rec- 
ognized by their manner of absorption in a succession of thin screens.* 
In traversing successively a series of screens the (y ra3's become less 

and less penetrating, whereas 
residual Kontgen I'ays under 
these circumstances ))ecome 
more and more penetrating.

(only a fraction of a milligram) 
is suspended ])y a metallic wire 
at a small distance (one-half 
millimeter) from a screcMi of phosphorescent sulphide of zinc. When 
the face of the screen whicii is turned toward the radium is examined 
in darkness by the aid of a magnifying glass, it appears studded with 
sparkling points, reminding one of the stars in the sky, except that

of the impact of a projectile, and thus for the first time there has been,

ment the magnetic deviation of the /? rays ma}^ be demonstrated. A 
tiny phial holding a little vadium, R, is placed at one end of a thick- 
walled lead tube, AB, as shown in section in fig. 3. An electroscope 
is placed somewhat bej^ond the other end of the tube, so that the pen- 
cil of rays emerging from the tube tends to discharge the electroscope. 
The lead tube is situated between the poles of an electro-magnet, E E, 
and at right angles to the line of poles, N 8. When the current is 
flowing in the coils of the electro-magnet the ft rays are thrown upon 
the walls of the lead tube, and do not escape to discharge the electro-

current is cut oti' the electroscope is again rapidly discharged. 

It ma}' be shown that the ft rays transport negative electricity, which 
is in harmony with the hypothesis that the}^ are electrically charged 
projectiles.'^* For this experiment the apparatus illustrated in fig. 4 
may ])c employed, in which R R represents the radium emitting the ft 
rays. Those among them which are directed toward the upper part 
of the figure traverse successively a thin sheet of aluminum, E E P] E, 
in electrical contact with the earth, and supporting an insulating block 
of parafiin, / / i /. They are finall}^ a])sorbed by a lead block, M M, 
which is connected to an electrometer by an insidated wire. It is

found that the electrometer is continually charged negatively. In 
this experiment the ly rays are absorbed by the sheet of aluminum 
which is connected to earth. The layer of paraffin is required to 
insulate the lead block M M, foi* the insulation of this Itlock would be 
defecti\e if there was oidy air between it and the aluminum, on account 
of the air being rendered coiidncting by th<> presence of the rays, so 
that it would then he impossible to (h'teet at th(^ electrometer the 
charging of the lead block. 

An experiment the in\ crx' of this may be performed. The metallic 
trough A A (fig. 5) containing radium. R, is connected with the elec-

trometer and surrounded 1)y paraffin, i i i /, inclosed in the metallic 
envelope E E E E, which is connected to earth. Since the a rays are 
but feebly penetrating the}' can not escape, but the fi rays traverse 
the paraffin and carry off negative electricity, so that the trough A A 
becomes positiveh' charged, 

A sealed glass test tube containing radium salt becomes spontane- 
ously charged with electricity, as if it were a Leyden jar. If, after a 
sufficient time, a line is traced by a glass cutter on the wall of the test 
tube, a spark may pass at the point where the w^all is thinned by the 
scratch, and at the same time the operator receives a feeble shock in 
his lingers l)y the passage of the discharge. 

The group of ft rays is made up of a variety of rays differing in 
their penetrating power. Some ft rays are absorbed by a thickness of 
one one-hundredth millimeter of aluminum, while others are able to 
traverse, before complete absorption, a layer of lead several milli- 
meters in thickness. Another method of distinguishing the varieties 
of ft rays is by the curvature of their path in a magnetic field. In the 
experiment represented in fig. 2 the ft raj's deviated b}^ the magnetic 
field would darken a photographic plate all the wa}' from B to C. 
The least deviated rays would be distinguished at C and those most 
deviated at B. Thus there would appear the photograph of a sort of 
spectrum produced by the influence of the magnetic Held on the ft 
rays. B}' interposing a thin sheet of metal in the path of the ra3^s, it 
may be shown that the rays most deviated are suppressed, so that it 
appears that the most penetrating rays are least deviated.^' 

According to the ballistic theory, it may be assumed that the ft ra3's 
are composed of electrons projected with different velocities. The most 
penetrating ra3's have the highest velocity. Kaufmann's researches, 
interpreted in the light of the theor}' of electrons as given bj^ M. 
Abraham, lead to very important general conclusions. Certain ver}^ 
penetrating ft raj'S may consist of electrons impressed with a velocit}^ 
nine-tenths of that of light. The propertv of mass in electrons, and 
perhaps in all bodies, may be a consequence of electro-magnetic reac- 
tions. The energ}^ required to impress higher and higher velocities 
upon an electricallv charged body approaches infinity when the veloc- 
ity of the body approaches the velocity of light. 

The y ra^'S, which are not deviable in a magnetic field, and which 
are analogous to X-rays, foi'm but a small part of the total radiation. 
Certain / ra3\s are extremely penetrating, and are able to traverse a 
thickness of several centimeters of lead. 

Becquerel ra3's ma3' be utilized to make radiographs without special 
apparatus. A small glass test tul)e containing some hundredths of a 
gram of radium salt replaces the Crookes tube. Both ft and y rays 
are emplo3^ed, but such radiographs lack sharpness on account of the

diffii.sion of the ft ra3^s by the bodies through which they pass. Sharp 
radiographs are obtained by deflecting' the ft rays with a magnetic 
lield, so that only the y rays remain; but the y rays are so feeble that 
several days' exposure must then be employed.

Eadium salts continually give off heat." The evolution of heat is 
so great that it may be shown in a rough experiment made with two 
ordinary mercury thermometers. Two similar vacuum-jacketed recep- 
tacles (A and A', Fig. 6) are employed. In one of them, A, let us 
suppose, is placed a test tube containing 0.7 gram of pure radium 
bromide, and in the second, A', is a similar tube of inactive substance 
such as chloride of barium. The temperature of each inclosure is 
indicated by a thermometer whose bulb is close to the test tube. The 
top of each vessel is closed by a wad of cotton. In these conditions 
the thcnnomoter t, which is placed in the same vessel with the radium, 

continually indicates a temperature 
about 3'-' higher than -that of the other 
thermometer t'. 

A determination of the amount of 
licat emitted by the radium may be 
made with the aid of the ice calorimeter 
of Bunsen. When a tube of radium is 
placed in the calorimeter, there is ob- 
served a continual evolution of heat, 
which ceases when the radium is with- 
drawn. Measurements made with a 
sample of radium which had been pre- 
pared a long time previously indicated 
that each gram of radium gives off 
about 80 small calories per hour. Thus radium gives oft' sufticient 
heat in an hour to melt its own weight of ice. This evolution of heat 
produces no change in the appearance of the salt, nor can any ordinary 
chemical reaction be pointed out as the source of the heat evolved. 

It has been shown that a radium salt when lirst prepared gives oft' 
comparativel}^ little heat, and that the heating increases steadily toward 
a maximum amount, which is not fully attained at the end of a month. 
When a salt of radium is dissolved in water and the solution is 
placed in a sealed tube, the quantity of heat evolved by the solution is 
at tirst feeble, but increases and tends toward a constant value, which 
is attained after about a month. When this constant state is reached, 
the salt in solution evolves the same amount of heat which it would 
give if in a solid state. 

The amount of heat given out l)y radium at dift'erent temperatures 
may be determined l)y causing it to boil a liquefied gas, and measuring

the volume of gas evolved. This experiment may he performed with 
methyl chloride (at —21° C). Professor Dewar and M. Curie have 
conducted such experiments with liquid oxygen (at —ISO C.) and li<|uid 
hydrogen (at —292 -' C). This last licpiid serves the purpose pj) rticularl}^ 
well. A tuhe A (tig. 7) (closed at the lower end and inclosed by a 
vacuum heat insulator of Dewar) contains a little li([uid hydrogen H. 
A tube tt' serves to conve}'^ the gas to be collected o\'er water in the 
inverted graduate E. The tube A and its insulator arc plunged into 
a bath of liquid hydrogen H'. In these conditions no evolution of gas 
is produced in A. But when a tube a containing 0.7 gram of radium 
bromide is placed in the hydrogen in the tube A, the gas is continually 
evolved at the rate of 78 cubic centimeters pei' minute.

The radiations of radium provoke many chemical reactions. Ihey 
^ act upon the substances employed in photography in the 

"I same manner as light. Glass is tinged violet or brown, 

j l i . ; J and salts of the alkalies are cohered yellow, violet, blue, 

'\ n '^^'^^^ or green. Under the action of the rays paratKn, paper, 
and celluloid turn yellow, paper becoiucs brittle, and 
ordinary phosphorus is transformed into the red va- 
riety. In general, bodies phosphorescent under the 
^X^yj action of radium rays undergo a transfoi'mation, and at 

„ „ ... ,. the same time their phosphorescence tends to disappear.

The radiations of radium produce A.irious ])hysiological eti'ects. 

A salt of radium contained in an opaijue tube of metal or pasteboard 
produces a sensation of light upon the eye. This may be shown by 
placing the tube of radium before the closed eye or against the temple. 
The eye then becomes phosphorescently luminous under the influence 
of the rays and light is perceived within the eye itself." 

Radium acts upon the skin so that if one holds a tube of radium in 
the hand for some minutes, though no particular sensation is felt at 
the time, after fifteen or twenty days an inflammation is produced 
and then the skin sloughs off at the place where the radium was 
applied. If the action of radium is continued long enough a sore is 
formed which may take months to heal. The action of radium rays 
on the skin is analogous to that of the Rontgen rays. It has been 
attempted to utilize it in the treatment of lupus and cancer.^

The action of radium ra,ys on nervous centers may result in paralysis

in the process of growth." 

VIII. 

When an}^ solid body is placed near a salt of radium it acquires the 
radiant properties of radium, or in other words becomes radio-active. 
This induced radio-activity persists for some time after the body is 
removed from the presence of the radium, but it becomes steadil}^ 
feebler and diminishes about half in each half hour till it disappears. 
This phenomenon is produced in a particularly intense and regular 
fashion if the solid body is placed with the radium salt in a closed 
vessel, aiid it is advantageous to emplo}' a solution of radium salt 
rather than the salt in the solid form.* 

A salt of radium is placed at A (tig. 8) in a glass reservoir which 
communicates by tubes t and t' with two other glass reservoirs B and 
C, from which air may be exhausted. It may be shown that the walls 
of the reservoirs B and C become radio-active and emit 
Becquerel rays analogous to those emitted ordinarily b}^ 
radium itself, while on the contrary the solution of radium 
emits very little radiation, so that the radio-activity 
becomes, as it w'ere, exteriorized. 

This phenomenon is well exhibited in other gases than 
air, and is independent of the presence of the gas. The 
radio-activity is communicated from one place to another 
by a sort of conduction through the gas, and may even be 
propagated from one reservoir to another through a cap- 
illary tube. Gas which has been in contact with radium, fig. 8— induced 

•^ ^ _ _ ' radio-activity. 

therefore, ac(iuires the propert}^ of imparting radio- 
activity to solids. The gas is itself radio-active, but does not emit 
raj^s which are very penetrating. Rays emitted by gases are not 
transmitted through the walls of a glass receiver. 

When the gas thus modified is removed far from the radium it retains 
its properties for a long time, and continues to emit Becquerel ra3\s of 
slight penetration and to impart radio-activity to solids. But its 
activity from either point of view diminishes b}^ half in each four days 
till it disajDpears. 

Rutherford supposes that radium continually emits a radio-active 
gaseous substance which diffuses in space and provokes the induced 
radio-activity. He gives to this hypothetical substance the name of 
radium emanation and believes that it is to be found in a mixed condi-

ting the material nature of the emanation, this expression tnay be 
employed to designate the special radio-active energy stored in the 
gas. "■ 

Air charged with the emanation provokes phosphorescence in bodies 
which are immersed in it. Glass (especially Thuringian glass) gives 
a beautiful white or green phosphorescence. Sidot's sulphide of zinc 
becomes excessively brilliajit under the action of the emanation.* This 
experiment may be tried with the apparatus shown in fig. 8. The 
cock R being closed, the radio-active emanation which is emitted by 
the solution in A saturates the air above the solution. When the 
emanation has accumulated in A for some days the reservoirs B and 
C, whose inner walls are coated with zinc sulphide, are exhausted. 
The cock R" is then closed and R opened, so that tlie air charged with 
the emanation expands suddenly into the reservoirs B and C, which 
immediately become luminous. 

Radium emanation comports itself as a gas from many points of 
view. Thus it is shared in the same proportions as a gas would be by 
two communicating reservoirs. It diffuses in air according to the law 
of diffusion of gases, and has a coefficient of diffusion not far from that 
of carbonic acid gas in air. *■ 

Messrs. Rutherford and Soddy discovered that the emanation has 
the property of condensing at the temperature of liquid air.'' The 
effects of such condensation may be shown with the apparatus pictured 
in fig. 8. The cock R" being closed, and the emanation being diffused 
throughout the apparatus, as at the conclusion of tlie experiment last 
described, the reservoirs B and C (which are covered within with phos- 
phorescent zinc sulphide) are luminous. On closing the cock R and 
plunging the reservoir C in liquid air, at the end of a half hour, it is 
seen that the reservoir B has lost its luminosit}', while the reservoir C 
is still bright. Thus it is seen that the emanation has quitted the res- 
ervoir B and become condensed in the cooled portion of the reservoir 
C. However, the luminosity of C is not very intense, since the phos- 
phorescence of sulphide of zinc is more feeble at the temperature of 
liquid air than at ordinary temperatures; but 1^}^ closing the cock R', 
which interrupts communication between the two reservoirs, and 
again bringing C to the temperature of the surroundings, it becomes 
again ))rilliantly illuminated, while B remains dark. Thus the ema- 
nation which at fir.st filled the two reservoirs is now all contained in C. 

The preceding experiments tend to convince us that the emanation 
is analogous to ordinar}' gases, but up to the present time the hypoth- 
esis of the existence of such a gas rests wholly on the manifestations

of radio-activity. It may be remarked that, contrary to the behavior 
of ordinary gases, the emanation spontaneoasly disappears when con- 
tained for a sufficient time in a sealed tube. 

The quantity of emanation diminishes by a lialf in four days, and this 
time constant is characteristic of the emanation of radium. 

IX. 

Having- briefly enumerated the principal properties of radium, it is 
proper to recall in a few words the origin of its discovery, in which 
Mme. Curie has had a very great share. '^^ 

Experiments with the substances separated from uranium and tho- 
rium had showed that the radio-activity is an atomic property which 
always accompanies the atoms of these simple substances. The radio- 
activit}' of a complex substance is generally greater the larger the pro- 
portion of the radio-active metal contained in the compound. Certain 
ores of uranium, as pitchblende, chalcolite, and camotite, have, how- 
ever, a radio-activity superior to that of metallic uranium. We there- 
fore questioned whether these minerals might not contain in minute 
proportion some substances still unrecognized and far more radio-active 
than uranium, and we searched by chemical methods for the hj'po- 
thetical substances, alwaj's guided by the radio-activity of the sub- 
stance treated. 

Our anticipations were verified ])y the results. Pitchblende con- 
tains new radio-active substances, but in an excessively minute pro- 
portion. A ton of pitchblende, for example, contains a quantit}" of 
radium on the order of one-tenth of a gram. In these conditions the 
preparation of radium salts is very tedious and costly. A ton of ore 
furnishes some kilograms of radiferous l)ariuni bromide, from which 
the radium is extracted by a series of fractionations. 

During the separation of radium, Demaryay, whose recent death is 
much deplored, was so good as to examine spectroscopicalh" the prod- 
ucts which we prepared. This cooperation was most valuable to us, 
for at the conclusion of our research the spectrum analysis confirmed 
our anticipations and furnisliod the proof that the radio-active barium 
which we had separated from pitchblende contained a new element. 
Demar^'ay made the first investigation of the spectrum of radium.* 

Radium has a vory sensitive spectrum reaction — indeed, quite as 
sensitive as that of ])arium. The presence of radiiau may be detected 
spectroscopically in radiferous barium containing only one ten- 
thousandth of radium; hut the radio-activity of radium gives a reac- 
tion 10,000 times as sensitive still. An electrometer ordinarih' well 
insulated enal)les the observer to detect readily the presence of radium

liadiuni is a higher honiologue of barium in the series of alkaline 
earth metals. Its atomic weight has been determined by Madame 
Curie to be 226. 

While thus a near neighbor to barium, it is not found, even as a 
trace, in the ordinar}- mineral sources of Itarium, and only accompanies 
it in the uranium ores, which fact is of great theoretical importance. 

X. 

Radium therefore gives us an example of a t)ody which, while 
remaining in the same state, evolves continuously a considera))le 
amount of energy. This fact is apparently in contradiction to the 
fundamental principles of energetics, and various hypotheses have 
been put forward to avoid this contradiction. 

Among these hypotheses we may consider two which were made at 
the beginning of tne studies of radio-activity." 

In the tirst hypothesis it is assumed that radium is an element in 
process of evolution. It nuist then be admitted that the evolution is 
extremely slow, so that no appreciable change of state is discernable 
in the course of several 3'ears, for the energy which is disengaged 
in the course of a year corresponds with an insignificant transforma- 
tion of matter. It would appear natural to suppose that the quantity 
of energy put in play in the transformation of atoms is considera])le. 

The second hypothesis assumes the existence in space of radiations 
still unknown and inaccessible to our senses. Radium might be 
assumed to be capable of absorbing the energy of these hypothetical 
rays and transforming it into radio-active energy. 

The two hypotheses which we have mentioned seem not incompatible. 

Since the deliver}' of this lecture there was made (June 1!>, l!»0o) a 
discovery of great importance 1)}' Messrs. Ramsay and Soddy. They 
found that the emanation of radium as it disappears gives place to the 
production of helium gas, whose presence can be recognized by spec- 
trum analysis. It seems, then, that we are here brought face to face 
for the first time with the formation of an element. It is possible 
that radium is an unstable chemical element, and that helium is pro- 
duced as one of the products of its disaggregation.

RADIUM. « 



By J. J. Thomson. 

The discovery by Monsieur and Madame Curie that a samph' of 
radium oivos out sufficient energy to melt half its weight of ice per 
hour has attracted attention to the question of the source from which 
the radium derives the energy necessary to maintain the radiation; 
this prol)lem has l)een l^efore us ever since the original discovery by 
Becquerelof the radiation from uranium. It has been suggested that 
the radium derives its energy from the air surrounding it; that the atoms 
of radium possess the facult}' of at)stracting the kinetic energy from the 
more rapidl}^ moving air molecules while they are able to retain their 
own energy when in collision with the slowly moving molecules of air. 
I can not see, however, that even the possession of this property would 
explain the behavior of radium; for imagine a portion of radium 
placed in a cavity in a ))lock of ice. The ice around the radium gets 
melted. Where does the energy for this come from ? By the hypothesis 
there is no change in the energ}' of the air radium system in the cavity, 
for the energy gained l)y the radium is lost l)vthe air, while heat can 
not flow into the cavit}^ from outside, for the melted ice around the 
cavity is hotter than the ice surrounding it. 

Another suggestion which has been made is that the air is traversed 
by a very penetrating kind of Becquerel radiation, and that it is the 
a))sorption of this radiation that gives the energy to the radium. We 
have direct evidence of the existence of such radiation, for McClennan 
and Burton have recently shown that the ionization of a gas inside a 
closed vessel is diminished by inunersing the vessel in a large tank full 
of water, suggesting that part, at any rate, of the ionization of the gas 
is due to a radiation which could penetrate the walls of the vessel, but 
which was stopped to an apprecial)le extent by the water. To explain 
the heating eflect observed with radium, the absorption of this radia- 
tion by radium nuist be on an altogether different scale from its 
absorption b}' other metals. As no direct experiments have been made 
on radium, it is possible that this may be the case; it is not, however, 
what we should expect frjom the experiments which have been made 
on the absorption of this radiation by other metals, for these experi 
ments haye shown that the absorption depends solely upon the density

of the absorbing- substance and not uj)on its chemical nature or phys- 
ical state. If this law hold for radium, the absorption ]\y it would be 
on the same scale as the absorption by lead or gold and altogether too 
small to explain the observed effects. We are thus led to seek for 
some other explanation. I think that the absence of change in the 
radium has been assumed without sufticient justification; all that the 
experiments justify us in concluding is that the rate of change is not 
sufficiently rapid to be appreciable in a few months. There is, on the 
other hand, \ery strong evidence that the substances actuall}^ engaged 
in emitting these radiations can only keep up the process for a short 
time; then they die out, and the subsequent radiation is due to a dif- 
ferent set of radiators. 

Take, for example, Beccpierers experiment when he precipitated 
barium from a radio-activ^e solution containing uranium, and found 
that the radio-activity was transferred to the precipitate, the solution 
not being radio-active; after a time, however, the radio-active precipi- 
tate lost its radio-activit}', while the solution of uranium regained its 
original vigor. The same thing is very strikingl}^ shown by the 
remarkable and suggestive experiments made b}' Rutherford and 
Sodd}' on thorium. The}' separated ordinary radio-active thoria into 
two parts, transferring practically all the radio-activity to a body 
called l)y them ''thorium X," tiie mass of which was infinitesimal in 
comparison with that of the original thoria. The thorium X thus 
separated lost in a few days its radio-activity, while the original thoria 
in the same time again ])ecame radio-active. This seems as clear a 
proof as we could wish foi- that the radio-activity of a given set of 
molecules is not permanent. The same want of permanence is shown 
by the radio-active emanations from thorium and radium, and by the 
induced radio-activity exhibited l)y bodies which have ])een negatively 
electriticd and exposed to these emanations or to the open air; in all 
these cases the radio-activity ceases after a few days. I have recently 
found tiiat the water from deep wells in Cambridge contains a radio- 
active gas, and that this gas after being liberated from the water 
gradually loses its radio-activity. The radio-activity of polonium, too, 
is known not to be permanent. 

The view that seems to me to l)e suggested by these results is that 
the atom of radium is not stal)le under all conditions, and that among 
the large number of atoms contained in any specimen of radium there 
are a few which are in the condition in which stability ceases and 
which pass into some other configuration, giving out as they do so 
large a (juantity of energy. I may, perhaps, make ni}^ meaning clearer 
b}' considering a hypothetical case. Suppose that the atoms of a gas 
X become unstable when they possess an amount of kinetic energy 100 
times, say, the average kinetic energy of the atoms at the temperature 
of the room. There would, according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann law 



RADIUM. 201 

of distribution, iilwa3'.s be a few atoms in the gas possessing this 
amount of kinetic energy; these would by hypothesis break up. If in 
doing so they gave out a large amount of energy in the form of 
Becquerel radiation, the gas would be radio-active and would continue 
to be so until all its atoms had passed through the phase in Avhich they 
possessed enough energy to make them unstable. If this energy were 
100 times the average energy it would probably take hundreds of 
thousands of years before the radio-activity of the gas was sensibl}^ 
diminished. Now in the case of radium, just as in the gas, the atoms 
arc not all in identical })hysical circumstances, and if there is any law 
of distribution like the Maxwell-Boltzmann law, tliere will on the 
above hjq^othesis, be a very slow transformation of the atoms accom- 
panied by a liberation of energy. In the hypothetical case we have 
taken the possession of a certain amount of kinetic energy as the 
criterion for instability. The argument will apply if any other test is 
taken. 

It may be objected to this explanation that if the rate at which the 
atoms are being transformed is very slow, the energy liberated by the 
transformation of a given number of atoms must be very much greater 
than that set free when the same number of atoms are concerned in 
any known chemical combination. It must be remembered, however, 
that the changes contemplated on this hypothesis are of a different 
kind from those occurring in ordinary chemical combination. The 
changes we are considering are changes in the contiguration of the 
atom, and it is possible that changes of this kind may l)e acc()nn)anied 
I)}' tlic liberation of very lai'ge quantities of energy. Thus, taking 
the atomic weight of radium as 225, if the mass of the atom of radium 
were due to the presence in it of a large number of corpuscles, each 
carrying the charge of 3.4 by lO""^*^ electrostatic units of negative 
electricity, and if this charge of negative electricity were associated 
with an ecjual charge of positive, so as to make the atom electricall}' 
neutral, then if these positive and negative charges were separated by 
a distance of 10"*^ cm., the intrinsic energy possessed by the atom 
would l)e so great that a diminution of it by 1 per cent wcudd be able 
to maintain the radiation from radium as measured by Curie for 
30,000 years. 

Another ])oint to b(5 noted is that the radiation from a concentrated 
mass of radium may possibly be very much greater than that from 
the same mass when disseminated through a large volume of pitch- 
blende; for it is possible that the radiation from one atom may tend to 
put the surrounding atoms in the unstable state. If this were so, more 
atoms would in a given time pass from the one state to the other if 
they were placed so as to receive the radiation from their neighbors 
than if they were disseminated through a matrix which shielded each 
radium atom from the radiation given out by its neighbors. 



EXPERIMENTS IN RADIO-ACTIVITY AND THE PRODUC- 
TION OF HELIUM FROM RADIUM/' 



Bv Sir William Ramsay and Mr. Frederick Soddy. 



(1) EXPERIMENTS ON THE RADIO-ACTIVITY OP THE INERT GASES OP THE 

ATMOSPHERE. 

Of recent years many investigations have been made }\v Elster and 
Geitel, Wilson, Strutt, Rutherford, Cooke, Allen, and others on the 
spontaneous ionization of the gases of the atmosphere and on the 
excited radio-activity obtainable from it. It became of interest to 
ascertain whether the inert monatomic gases of the atmosphere bear 
any share in these phenomena. For this purpose a small electroscope 
contained in a glass tube of about 20 cubic centimeters capacity, cov- 
ered in the interior with tin foil, was employed. After charging, the 
apparatus if exhausted retained its charge for thirty-six hours without 
diminution. Admission of air caused a slow discharge. In similar 
experiments with helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon, the last 
mixed with oxygen, the rate of discharge was proportional to the 
density and pressure of the gas. This shows that the gases have no 
special radio-activity of their own, and accords with the explanation 
alread}^ advanced by these investigators, that the discharging power 
of the air is caused by extraneous radio-activity. 

Experiments were also made with the dregs left after liquetied air 
had nearly entirely evaporated, and again with the same result; no 
increase in discharging power is produced by concentration of a possi- 
ble radio-active constituent of the atmosphere. 

(2) EXPERIMENTS ON THE NATURE OP THE RADIO-ACTIVE EMANATION FROM 

RADIUM. 

The word emanation, originally used by Boyle ('\substantial emana- 
tions from the celiNstial bodies'"), was resuscitated by Rutherford to 
designate definite substances of a gaseous nature continuously pro- 
duced from other sul)stances. The term was also used by Ru.ssell 
("emanation from hydrogen peroxide") in much the same sense. If

204 EXPERIMENTS IN RADIO-ACTIVITY. 

the adjective "radio-active" be added, the phenomenon of Rutherford 
is distiiioui.shed from the phenomena ol)served by Russelh In this 
section we are dealing with the emanation, or radio-active gas obtained 
from radium. Rutherford and Sodd}^ investigated the chemical nature 
of the thorium emanation (Phil. Mag., 1902, p. 580) and of the radium 
emanation (ibid., 1903, p. iST), and came to the conclusion that these 
emanations are inert gases which withstand the action of reagents in a 
manner hitherto unobserved except with the members of the argon 
family. This conclusion was arrived at because the emanations from 
thorium and radium could ))e passed without alteration over platinum 
and palladiiun black, chromate of lead, zinc dust, and magnesium 
powder, all at a red heat. 

We have since found that the radium emanation withstands pro- 
longed s})arking with oxygen over alkali, and also, during several 
hours, the action of a heated mixture of magnesium powder and lime. 
The diseharging poAver was maintained unaltered after this treatment, 
and inasnmch as a considerable amount of radium was employed it 
was possible to use the self-luminosity of the gas as an optical demon- 
stration of its persistence. 

In an experiment in which the emanation mixed with oxygen had 
been sparked for several hours over alkali, a minute fraction of the 
total mixture was found to discharge an electroscope almost instantly. 
From the main (piantity of the gas the oxygen was withdrawn by 
ignited phosphorus, and no visible residue was left. When, however, 
another gas was introduced, so as to come into contact with the top of 
the tube, and then withdrawn, the emanation was found to be present 
in it in unaltered amount. It appears, therefore, that phosphorus 
burning in oxygen and sparking with oxygen has no effect upon the 
gas so far as can be detected by its radio-active properties. 

The experiments with magnesium lime were more strictly quanti- 
tative. The method of testing the gas before and after treatment with 
the reagent was to take one two-thousandth part of the whole mixed 
with air, and after introducing it into the reservoir of an electroscope 
to measure the rate of discharge. The magnesium-lime tube glowed 
l)rightly when the mixture of emanation and air was admitted, and it 
was maintained at a red heat for three hours. The gas was then 
washed out with a little hj'drogen, diluted with air, and tested as before. 
It was found that the discharging power of the gas had been quite 
unaltered by this treatment. 

The emanation can be dealt with as a gas; it can be extracted by aid 
of a Topler pump; it can be condensed in a U-tube surrounded by 
liquid air, and when condensed it can be "washed" with another gas 
which can be pumped oft" completely, and which then possesses no 
luminosity and practically no discharging power. The passage of the 
emanation from place to place through glass tubes can be followed by 



EXnCRIMENTS IN RADKVACTIVITY. 205 

the eye in a darkened room. On opening a stopcock between a tube 
containing the emanation and the pump, the slow flow through the 
capilhir}^ tube can be noticed; the rapid passage along the wider tubes; 
the delay caused by the plug of phosphorus pentoxide, and the sudden 
diffusion into the reservoir of the pump. When compressed, the 
luminosity increased, and when the small bul)ble was expelled through 
the capillar}' it was exceedingly luminous. The peculiarities of the 
excited activit}' left behind on the glass by the emanation could also 
be well observed. When the emanation has been left a short time in 
contact with the glass, the excited activity lasts only for a short time; 
but after the emanation has been stored a long time the excited activit}^ 
decay's more slowly. 

The emanation causes chemical change in a similar manner to the 
salts of radium themselves. The emanation pumped off from 50 milli- 
grams of radium bromide after dissolving in water, when stored with 
oxygen in a small glass tube over mercury, turns the glass distinctly 
violet in a single night; if moist the mercury becomes covered with a 
film of the red oxide, but if dry it appears to remain unattacked. A 
mixture of the emanation with oxygen produces carbon dioxide when 
passed through a lubricated stopcock. 

(3) OCCURRENCE OF HELHTM IN THE GASES EVOLVED FROM RADIUM BROMIDE. 

The gas evolved from 20 milligrams of pure radium l)romide (which 
we are informed had been prepared three months) ])y its solution in 
water and which consisted mainly of hydrogen and oxygen (cf. Giesel, 
Ber. , 1!»03, 347) Avas tested for helium, the hydrogen and oxygen 
being removed by contact with a red-hot spiral of copper wire, par- 
tially oxidized, and the resulting water vapor l)y a tube of phosphorus 
pentoxide. The gas issued into a small vacuum tul)e which showed 
the spectrum of car))on dioxide. The vacuum tul)e was in ti'ain with a 
small U-tube, and the latter was then cooled with liquid air. This 
much reduced the brilliancy of the COj spectrum, and the D^ line of 
helium appeared. The coincidence was confirmed by throwing the 
spectrum of helium into the spectroscope through the comparison 
prism, and shown to be at least within 0.5 of an Angstrom unit. 

The experiment was carefully repeated in apparatus constructed of 
previouslv unused glass with 30 milligrams of radium bromide, prob-. 
ably four or five months ok' kindly lent us by Professor Rutherford. 
The gases evolved were passe through a cooled U-tube on their way 
to the vacuum tube, which compictel}' prevented the passage of carl)on 
dioxide and the emanation. The spectium of lielium was obtained, 
and practically all the lines were seen, including those at 6677, 5876, 
5016, -tlK^S, 4713, and 44-72. There were also present three lines of 
approximate wave lengths, 6180, 5695, 5455, that have not yet been 
identified. 



206 EXPERIMENTS IN RADIO-ACTIVITY. 

Oil two .subsequent oecu.sion.s the gase.s evolved fi'oiii both solutions 
of radium bromide were mixed, after four days' accumulation, which 
amounted to about 2.5 cubic centimeters in each case, and were exam- 
ined in a similar way. The D3 line of helium could not be detected. 
It may l)e well to state the composition found for the gases continu- 
ously generated by a solution of radium, for it seemed likely that the 
large excess of hydrogen over the composition required to form water, 
shown in the analysis given by Bodliinder (Ber., loc. cit.), might be 
due to the greater solubility of the ox3^gen. In our analyses the gases 
were extracted with the pump, and the first gave 28.6, the second 29.2, 
per cent of oxygen. The slight excess of hydrogen is doubtless due 
to the action of the oxygen on the grease of the stopcocks, which has 
been already mentioned. The rate of production of these gases is 
about 0..5 cubic centimeter per day for .50 milligrams of radium bro- 
mide, which is more than tsvice as great as that found l)y Bodliinder. 

(4) PRODUCTION OF HKLIUM BY THK KADUTM EMANATION. 

The maxinuun amount of the emanation obtained from 50 milligrams 
of radium bromide was conveyed by means of oxygen into a U-tube 
cooled in liipiid air, and the latter was then extracted by the pump. 
It was then washed out with a little fresh oxygen, which was again 
pumped ofl'. The vacuum tube sealed onto the U-tu))e, after remov- 
ing the litjuid air, showed no trace of helium. The s})ectrum was 
apparently a new one, probably that of the emanation, ])ut this has 
not yet been completely examined, and we hope to publish further 
details shortly. AiUn- standing from July IT to 21; the helium spec- 
trum appeai-ed, and the characteristic lines were observed identical in 
position with those of a helium tube thrown into the field of vision at 
the same time. On July 22 the yellow, the green, the two blues, and 
the violet were seen, and in addition the three new lines also present 
in the helium obtained from radium. A confirmatory experiment 
gave identical results. 

We wish to express our indebtedness to the research fund of the 
chemical society for a part of the radium used in this investigation. 



THE N KAYS OF M. BLONDLOT. 



By C. G. Abbot. 



[The so-called "N rays," recently described by M. Blondlot and 
others, have too respectable an introduction to the scientilic pul)lic in 
the Comptes Rendus of the Institute of France (from which this paper 
has l)een 'chiefly abstracted) and have attracted too wide attention to 
justify an omission of all notice of them in this place. It never- 
theless seems proper to state here that the experiments on which they 
rest are not universally deemed conclusive, and that final judgment 
upon them ma}' 1)e suspended until the appearance of still further 
evidence. — Note by S. P. Langlev.] 

DISCOVERY. 

In the early part of the year 10(»3 M. Blondlot, professor of physics 
at the University of Nancy, was carrying on some studies of the X 
rays to discover if these could be polarized. He found that a con- 
venient method of recognizing- the presence and possil)le polarization 
of these rays consisted in the employment of a small electric spark- 
ing device. Two sharpened wires, communicating inductively with 
the terminals of a Kuhmkorff coil, were so nearly approached that 
feeble sparks continually passed between them, and upon bringing 
this sparking de^•ice near a source of X rays the luminosity of the 
sparks was found to increase. M. Blondlot at first thought he 
detected by his experiments a considerable degree of polarization in 
the X rays, but a little later he decided that it was not the X ra3^s 
themselves which gave the appearance of polarization, but a new kind 
of rays heretofore unrecognized. In his first experiments with these 
rays their source was a Crookes tube provided with a thin covering of 
aluminum to cut off the light. The rays which traversed the aluminum 
then passed through a ivctangular opening in a sheet of lead and fell 
upon the little sparking device already mentioned. It was found that 
only when the line of sparks Hew in a certiiin direction, as compared 
with the slit in the leaden sheet, could the maxinuun brightness be 
observed, and this direction for maximum brightn(\ss was altered Avhen 
a substance which rotates the plane of polarization of light was intro- 
duced. 

207 



208 IHE N RAYS OF M. BLONDLOT. 

The experi'^ients on polarization suggested to M. Blondlot the pos- 
sibility that the new rays might also be refracted. He tested this by 
interposing a quartz prism, and found that in fact the ra^^s were now 
diverted from a straight line, so that he was obliged to carry the 
sparking device to one side in oi-der to reach a point of increased 
luminosity. By means of a quartz lens the fact of the refraction of 
the rays was further verified, and following this it was found that the 
rays could be reflected regularly and dilfustdy, just as is the case with 
ordinary light. As polarization, refraction, and reflection are not 
qualities of X-rays, but are essentialh' qualities of ordinary light, M. 
Blondlot drew the conclusion that he was now dealing with radiation 
propagated by waves in the ether in essentially the same manner as 
ordinary light. This new type of rays he found to be transmitted by 
wood, paper, aluminum, and many other metals, but to produce no 
direct efl'ect upon the eye, the photographic plate, or a phosphorescent 
screen, and he w^as at flrst unable to recognize them excepting b}^ 
means of the little sparking device. 

The experiments with refraction in prisms and lenses had indicated 
that the index of refraction of these rays in quartz was very high and 
indeed exceeding 2. Professor Kubens had not long before discov- 
ered mys of great wav€ length for which the index of refraction in 
quartz was about 2.18. This similarity of refractive index led M. 
Blondlot at first to think that perhaps he was now dealing with a type 
of radiation belonging to the extreme infra-red, and as Rubens had 
employed a Welsbach lamp as a source of the radiations he had meas- 
ured, M. Blondlot sought to determine if these new ravs were also 
emitted by this source. Shielding the lamp which he employed by an 
iron covering having a small aluminum window, he was aide to detect 
the presence of the ra^'s in question in its radiation by the aid of the 
small sparking device. When the quartz lens was used to form an 
image of the source, the rays appeared not to be homogeneous, but to 
contain at least four dift'erent varieties whose indices of refraction 
were, respectively, 2.94, 2.02', 2. 44, and 2.29. With the exception of 
lead, rock salt, platinum, and water, the rays were found to be trans- 
missible by moderate thicknesses of many ditterent substances, includ- 
ing tin foil, copper, aluminum, steel, silver, gold, paraflan, black 
rubber, and others. 

sou HOES OF THE KAYS" AND METHODS EMPLOYED IN THEIR EECOCiNITION. 

M. Blondlot now gave a jiame to these rays, calling them N rays, 
after the city of Nancy, in which he lives. He claims to detect their 
presence in the emission of luminous gas flames, as well as in the 
sources already mentioned, ])ut he failed to find them in the emission 
of a l^unsen burner. The Nernst lamp is spoken of as a speciall}^ 
intense source of them. 



THE N RAYS OF M. BLONDLOT. 209 

Other methods of recoj^nizing the rays were now introduced, for 
M. Blondlot was led to inquire whether the sparking device acted as a 
sign of their presence b}^ virtue of its electrical properties or by vir- 
tue merely of its emission of light. Accordingly he used a small blue 
flame instead of the device, and found with it also an increased lumi- 
nosity when placing it in the focus of the rays. A little later he 
found that phosphorescent substances, though not excited directly by 
the rajs, yet if first made feebly luminous b}' ordinary" light were 
raised to a higher luminosit}' when exposed to the N rays. In later 
experiments it appeared that a surface feebly illuminated by reflected 
light became brighter under the influence of N rays. Still more 
remarkable, lie found that if the N rays fell onl}^ on the eye of the 
observer, and not on the object observed, the latter was nevertheless 
made to appear more luminous, though the N rays themselves produce 
no sensation of light. Photography failed as a direct method of 
observing the ravs, but he used it indirectly to note the increased 
luminosity of the spark, the blue flame, or the phosphorescent surface 
which was employed to recognize the presence of the rays. The 
accompanying flgure, taken from the Comptes Rendus of February 
22, 190-1, shows an example of this indirect photographic metliod. 
Experiments with the most sensitive apparatus failed to record an}' 
sensible heating produced by the N rays. 

M. Blondlot makes the following general rcMuark concerning the 
observation of the N rays: 

The ability to recognize slight variations of luminous intensity varies very much 
between different persons. Some see at the first glance, without any difficulty, the 
augmentation which the N rays produce in the brightness (if a small luminous source, 
while to others these changes are very near the limit which they can distinguish, 
and it is only after some experience that they are able to be sure of having observed 
the phenomenon. The feebleness of these effects and the delicacy of the observation 
ought not, however, to arrest our study of these heretofore unknown radiations. I 
have found recently that the Welsbach burner may be advantageously replaced as a 
source by the Nernst lamp with no glass covering, for this latter gives forth the 
N rays with greater intensity, and thus with a 200-watt lamp, for example, the phe- 
nomena are so marked that they may be easily observed. 

N RAYS FROM THE SUN. 

The following simple experiment is given by the discoverer to show 
the existence of N rays in the solar beam: 

A completely darkened chamber is furnished with a window exposed directly to 
the sun's rays, and this window is closed by an oak shutter at least half an inch 
thick, so that no ordinary light can possibly penetrate into the room. Behind this 
shutter, at about a meter distance, for example, is placed a small glass tube contain- 
ing -a phosphorescent substance — sulphide of calcium, for example — whicli has pre- 
viously been exposed to light and become feebly luminescent. If, now, in the beam 
of the sun, which we suppose to pass through the wooden shutter and fall upon the 
phosi)horescent tube, we interpose a screen of lead, or even simply the hand of the 



210 



THE N RAYS OF M. BLONDLOT. 



observer, though at considerable distance from the tube, the brightness of the phos- 
]>liorescence is seen to diminish, and ujion removing the obstacle the brightness 
again increases. The only precaution which it is necessary to take is to employ a tube 
only slightly phosphorescent, but it is advantageous to place behind it a black pajier, 
so that the interposition of the screen produces no change whatever in the back- 
ground against which one sees the tube. The variations of l)rightness are most 
easy to observe near the boundaries of the luminous spot formed upon the black 
background by the jihosphorescent l)ody, and when the N rays are intercei)ted these 
contours lose their sharjmess and regain it when the screen is removed. Sometimes 
the variations of brightness are not instantly recognized. Interposition in the path 
of the beam of several sheets of aluminum, of cardl)oard, and even of a board of 
oak more than an inch thick, does not prevent the effect, so that all possibility of 
the action of any ordinary radiation is of course excluded. A thin sheet of water, 
however, entirely arrests the rays, and thin clouds passing before the sun consider- 
ably diminish their action. 

WAVK LENCTII OF THK RAYS IN gUESTION. 

M. Jilondlot, as we have seen, was at lirst inclined to think that his 
rays belonged in the extreme infra-red spectrum, but more recently 
he has described measures of their wave length b}' means of the diffrac- 
tion grating which lead him to the opposite conclusion. He employed 
a spectroscope with aluminum prism to separate the several different 
species of N rays emitted by a Nernst lamp, and then estimated their 
wave length by means of several different diffraction gratings having, 
respectivel}^ 50, 100, and 200 lines to the millimeter. The following- 
table contains the results of his measures:

Thus it appeal's that the N rays belong far beyond the previously 
studied ultraviolet, and have a wave length only one-tenth that of the 
rays with which Doctor Schumann has been working with his vacuum 
spectograph. It is somewhat extraordinary that the N rays should so 
readily traverse thicknesses of the air and other substances, which 
would entirely arrest the ultraviolet rays examined by Doctor Schu- 
mann, ])ut, as is tht? case in other regions of the spectrum, it may be 
that the air has here special bands of great absorption, in one of which 
Doctor Schumann's vajs lie, and that beyond this region there are 
other parts of the spectrum where the air is again transparent. Another 
curious thing about the measures just given is that the aluminum

prism jippears to be anomalousl}' refracting; in other words, its indices 
of refraction increase rather than decrease with increasing wave length 
of the rays. M. Blondlot suggests that the augmentation of brilliancy 
observed in a small luminous source under the action of the N rays 
may be attributed to a transformation of these radiations into lumi- 
nous ones in conformity to the law of Stokes. 

STOKING UP OF THE N RAYS. 

M. Blondlot finds that man}- substances are able to store up the 
N rays and emit them for some time after having been subjected to 
the influence of a source. This property, it will be seen, is similar to 
the phenomenon of phosphorescence which is observed with ordinar}^ 
light. Among the substances which appear to store up the N rays 
are quartz, Iceland spar, fluorspar, glass, and many others. Alumi- 
num, wood, paper, and ])araffin, on the other hand, do not appear to 
possess this property of storing up N rays to any very appreciable 
extent. The phenomenon is so general that a large portion of the 
bodies upon which the sun's ra3'S fall are said b}- M. Blondlot to 
become saturated with the raj's and to give them out undiminished in 
some cases as long as four days after they have been removed from 
the influence of the sun. 

N RAYS PRODUCED BY MECHANICAL PROCESSES. 

It appeared that compression and other distortions of metals, wood, 
glass, ru))ber, etc., caused these substances to emit N rays while under 
such mechanical constraint. Crystalline substances, tempered steel, 
and some other bodies possessing special internal structure, are stated 
to be spontaneous and permanent sources of N ravs. As an illustra- 
tion of the permanence with which this property remains associated 
with such substances, M. Blondlot mentions that a sword found in an 
ancient sepulcher dating from the Merovingian epoch, was found to 
give out the N rays strongly. It thus appears that the emission of the 
N rays ])y tempered blades of steel may continue for centuries with- 
out becoming enfeebled, and as regards continuous emission, therefore, 
the N raj's may be compared with the radiation of uranium, radium, 
polonium, and other sources of Becquerel rays, although, of course, in 
other respects the two kinds of radiations are entirely dift'erent. 

EMISSION OF N RAYS BY THE HUMAN BODY. 

M. Charpentier, while repeating in his laboratory many of the 
experiments of M. Blondlot on the i)roduction and observation of 
N rays, noted that the luminosity of phosphorescent substances used 
to defect the presence of the rays appeared to increase when tlie 
observer approached these phosphorescent su})stances. Continuing 



212 THE N RAYS OF M. BLONDLOT. 

the studies which this observation led him to pursue, he found that 
the increase of brightness was most considerable in the vicinit}^ of a 
muscle, and was greatest when the muscle was strongly contracted. 
Nerves and nervous centers were afterwards found to produce similar 
effects, and he was even able to follow in this manner the course of 
certain nerves beneath the skin. These experiments suggested to 
him that the human body, at least some portions of it, might be emit- 
ting N rays, and he found that the emissions observed passed readily 
thi'ough aluminum, paper, and other substances classed as transparent 
to the N rays, and that the}^ were arrested by lead and moistened 
paper which had been used by M. Blondlot as screens. The ra3^s were 
further found to be reflected and refracted, and could l)e brought 
to a focus by the aid of convex lenses, and appeared to have about 
the same indices of refraction as the N rays themselves. It seemed 
possil)le, however, that the human body acted merely as a reservoir, 
storing up the rays like some other substances in which such action 
had been observed b}^ M. Blondlot, but M. Char^^entier states that 
after continuing nine hours in complete darkness the rays were still 
emitted by the body, though perhaps a greater sensitiveness of the 
eye under these conditions may have made it more easy to recognize 
them. However, M. Charpentier is of the opinion that the human 
body certainly emits N rays, and especially in those parts of it which 
are in active use. 

From later experiments it was concluded that the lower animals, such 
as the monkey and others, are active sources of the N rays, and that 
here, as in man, the principal seat of the emission is in the muscles and 
nerves. It was not alone the warm-blooded animals which appeared 
to give rise to emission, but also the cold-blooded — frogs and others. 
As in the case of metals and other substances experimented upon by 
M. Blondlot, mechanical constraint, such as the compression of nerves 
and muscles, greatly augmented the luminous effects. In order to 
localize the observations in a convenient manner, M. Charpentier uses 
a narrow lead tube from 2 to -t inches in length, of which one end is 
pliu-ed in contact with the body to be examined and the other contains 
the phosphorescent substance used as the indicator. He states that 
he can thus trace out the regions of the brain which are active in 
special functions, such as the "center of Broca," reputed to be the seat 
of articulate language. 

It appears from Charpentier's later experiments that the physiolog- 
ical emissions are not exclusively composed of N rays, but include 
other kinds of radiation differing in some degree in their properties 
from those which have been found associated with the N rays. 



THE N RAYS OF M. ELONDLOT. 213 

TRANSMISSION OF THE N KAYS ALONG WIRES. 

Ill the course of M. Charpentier's experiiiieiits he found that the 
rays emitted l)y tlie human l)ody are capabk' of being- transmitted not 
only in the air, ]>ut along wires of metal, such as copper or aluminum. 
This extraordinary discovery has been explained by M. Bichat, who 
ol)serves that this method of transmission may be compared to the 
repeated reflections of ordinary light within a long glass tube. His 
experiments indicated first of all that the wire itself was certainl}^ the 
conductor of the rays, and not the medium in which it was .placed, 
for upon immersing the wire in water the conductivity remained undi- 
minished. It was necessary, moreover, that the Avire should be of good 
transmitting material, for leaden wires are said to transmit nothing. 
The wire must not be bent at a sharp angle, nor should it be rough at 
any point, for in these cases the internal reflections along its boundary 
can not be pro})agated. 

Nj RAYS. 

Some veiy recent experiments of M. Blondlot led him to think that, 
whereas the N rays augument the luminosity of certain sources of 
light, there is another kind of raj^s associated with them which 
diminishes instead of augments the luminosity, and he has investigated 
these ra3"s among those emitted by a Nernst lamp. These so-called 
Ni ra3^s he finds to be reflected and refracted similarh^ to the N rays, 
but to lie alternately with them in wave length, so that, for example, 
he states that a group of Nj ra3's exists of wave length .003yM, a group 
of N ra3's at 0.0048yu, another group of N^ rays at 0.0056yw, N rays at 
0.0067yw, and N^ rays at 0.0074//. All of these new groups, both N 
and Nj, are of smaller w^ave length than those included in the table 
alread3^ given. 

Certain sources appear to emit exclusively, or at least principally, 
the Nj rays, such as copper, silver, and platinum. The Nj ra3^s may 
be stored up, ho states, like the N rays. 

CONCLUSION. 

To sum up these newly reported discoveries and experiments, it 
appears that several other men of scientific standing and attainments 
have repeated and verified M. Blondlot's discoveries of the N and N^ 
rays and those of M. Charpentier on the rays emitted b3' living bodies. 
The observations appear, however, to be diflicult. and many able 
observers who have endeavored to repeat the experiments have not 
been able to verify even the existence of such radiations, to say noth- 
ing of making measurements of their wave length by the diffraction 
grating. It has been stated in Criticism that augmentation of bright- 
ness in phosphorescent substances ma3' be the result of several causes, 



214 THE N RAYS OF M. BLONDLOT. 

perhiips not sufficiently exc-liulotl from M. Blondlot's experiments. As 
we have seen, however, M. Bloiidlot does not depend wholly on phos- 
phorescent screens to observe his rays, and he remarks the difference 
in sensitiveness of e3'es to minute changes of the intensit}^ of light, so 
that this negative evidence is not a disproof of the existence of the 
rays in question. On the other hand, the positive photographic evi- 
dence afforded in the illustrations given by M. Blondlot, which does 
not at all depend on phosphorescence, but onl}' on the brightness of the 
little sparking device, seems to outweigh indications depending merely 
on sight alone. 

In connection with M. Charpentier's physiological rays, it may be 
recalled by the reader that a half century ago there was great interest 
aroused, both in scientific and po})ulai' circles, by the accounts of the 
so-called " odic force'' of Reichenbach. This was said to be mani- 
fested as a luminous aureole which appeared to some observers to sur- 
round certain persons. For some time there was a controversy 
between those who claimed they could see it and those who certainly 
could not see it, })ut at length the discussion disappeared from the 
journals, and the general impression has ])een that no such thing really 
existed. 

Some persons have thought that these new discoveries of M. Char- 
pentier and others may in a certain sense revive the old idea of such 
an aureole thrown out by living people, but the methods of observing 
the new rays are evidently wholl}^ different. The physiological rays 
now l>eing discussed can not be seen by the naked e3'e, nor do they 
ati'ect the photographic plate or any other of the ordinary means of 
observing light, and they are only to be distinguished indirectly by 
the augmentation of brightness which they produce in feebly luminous 
objects. Accordingly, however interesting it may ])e if we know 
that the living body actually is surroiuided ))y special radiations which 
it emits in addition to those rays of great wave length which we 
have long known are emitted b}' every bod}', living or dead, above the 
temperature of al)solute zero, still so long as our e^^es can not see 
them they can hardly be supposed to belong in the category of the 
aureole of Reichenbach. It is to be hoped that they will not, like this 
asserted aureole, fall into scientific oblivion. 



MODERN V1P:WS ON MATTER. « 



By Sir Oliver Loihje, H(jn. D. Sc, F. R. S. 



The nature of matter has been regarded by philo.so])hers froiii many 
points of view, but it is not from any philosophic standpoint that 
I presume in this university to ask you to consider the subject 
under my guidance. It is because new views as to the structure and 
properties of what used to be called the ultimate atom are now 
being born, and because these views, whether they succeed in ulti- 
mately esta])lishing themselves in ever}' detail or not, are of surpass- 
ing interest, that I have chosen this very recently deciphered chapter 
of science as the suljject-matter for the lecture — the Romanes lecture — - 
to be given this 3'ear in remembrance of a man whom I knew as a 
friend, and w^hose mind, if he had been alive to-day, would have been 
widely open to these most modern developments of physical science. 
Nor would the admittedly speculative character of some of the hypoth- 
eses now being thrown out have deterred him from hearing about 
them with the keenest interest. 

If I may venture to say so, it is the more philosophical side of 
physics which has always seemed to me most suitable for study in 
this university; and although 1 disclaim an}' (.-ompetence for philo- 
sophic treatment in the technical sense, yet 1 doubt not that the new 
views, in so far as they turn out to be true views, will have a bearing 
on the theory of matter in all future writings on philosophy, besides 
exercising a profound effect on the pure sciences of physics and chem- 
istry, and perhaps having some influence on certain aspects of biology 
also. 

In admitting that I am going to pronudgate a speculative hypothesis — 
that is. a hypothesis for which there is evidence but not yet conclusive 
evidence — 1 must not lead you to suppose that the whole of what 1 have 
to say is of this character. On the contrary, nuu'h of it is certain; 
that is to say, is accepted by a consensus of opinion to-day among 
those who by reason of study are competent to judge. I will endeavor 
carefully to discriminate between what is in this sense certain and what 
must still be regarded as doubtful and needing further support.

216 MODERN VIEWS ON MATTER. 

To treat the .subject properly, to give all the evidence as well as the 
results, would need a volume, or a course of lectures; and in order to 
be brief I must frequent!}" be dogmatic, l)ut I shall only intend to )>e 
so in those places where I feel sure that the physicists present (whom 
here I salute) will agree Avith me. When I have a dogma of this kind 
to propound I shall call it a thesis. The more speculative opinions 1 
sLall plainly denominate hypotheses. 

1. My first thesis is that an electric charge possesses the most fun- 
damental and characteristic property of matter, viz, mass or inertia; 
so that if anyone were to speak of a milligram or an ounce or a ton of 
electricity, though he would certainly be speaking inconveniently, he 
might not necessaril}' be speaking erroneously. At the same time it 
would l)e well to mistrust anA'one who employed such a phrase, except 
in speaking to experts. He would most likely be talking nonsense; but 
if he talks nonsense to experts, his l)lood is on his own head. 

In order to have any appreciable mass, however, an electric charge 
must either be extremely great or must be extremely concentratc^d, 
and unless it is to be utterly masked by the matter with which it is 
associated it must be the latter; that is to say, it must exist on bodies 
of far less than ultra-microscopic size. The mass or inertia of a 
charge depends upon two factors— the quantity of electricity in it, 
and its potential — and by concentrating a given charge onto a suffi- 
ciently small sphere the latter factor can be raised theoretically to 
any value we please, and thus any required inertia can be ol)tained, 
unless a stage is reached at which it becomes physically impossible to 
concentrate it any more. 

•2. The next thesis is a very simple and familiar one, and dates 
virtuall}' from the time of Faraday, though the conception has grad- 
ually gained in clearness and solidity. It is that every atom of matter 
can have associated with it a certain definite quantity of electricity 
called the ionic charge; that some atoms can have double this quantity, 
some treble, and so on, but that no atom or any piece of matter can 
have a fraction of this cjuaRtity; which therefore appears to be an ulti- 
mate unit, a sort of "atom," of electricity. The ratio of the charge to 
the weight of a material atom is measured with accuracy in electrol- 
ysis, in accordance with what are called Faraday's laws; and in so far 
as the mass of the atom itself is otherwise approximately known the 
quantity of electricit}' which can be associated with it is known with a 
similar degree of approximate accuracy. 

3. Now, mathematical data were given by J. J. Thomson in 1881 
which enable us to say that if the charge of electricity usually associ- 
ated with a single monad atom of matter were concentrated on to a 
spherical nucleus one hundred-thousandth of an atom's dimension 
in diameter, it wouldthereby possess a mass about one-thousandth of 
that of the lightest atom known, viz, the hydrogen atom. 



MODEEN VIEWS ON MATTER. 217 

Such a h3"pothetical concentrated unit of electricity it has become 
customary to call an ''electron,'"' a name invented by Dr. Johnstoi.e 
Stoney to designate the so-to-speak "atom" or smallest known unit of 
electric charge. Eyery electric charge is to be thought of as due to 
the possession of a number of electrons, but a fraction of an electron 
is at present considered impossible, meaning that no indication of any 
further subdivision has ever loomed even indistinctly above the 
horizon of practical or theoretical possibility. 

The electrification of an atom of matter consists in attaching such 
an electron to it or in detaching one from it. An atom of matter 
possessing an electron in excess is called an "ion;" and there is reason 
to know that, considered as a charged body, its charge is that Avhich 
we have been historically accustomed to designate ' ' negative ;" whereas 
an atom of matter with one electron in defect is that which has his- 
torically been called a "positive" ion. 

This inversion in the natural use of the names positive and negative 
is inconvenient but accidental and not really serious; it dates from the 
time of Benjamin Franklin. 

These ions or traveling particles of matter have been long known. 
A liquid or a gas conducts because of the locomotion of its charged 
particles. The particles travel in an electric field because of their 
attached charges, all the positive going one way, and all the negative 
the other wa}^; and each kind of matter possesses an intrinsic or char- 
acteristic ionic velocity, when urged b}' a given field through a given 
solution. The charges may be likened to horses or other propelling- 
agency, and the atom to the vehicle or heavy bod}" which is dragged 
along. The speed of travel through li(|uids is very slow, but through 
gases is considerably quicker, partly because there is less resistance, 
and partly because it is easier to maintain a steep gradient of potential 
in a medium where the ions are not too numerous. 

The act of production of such ions is styled "ionization," and the 
process has been employed to explain ver}- many facts in both phj^sics 
and chemistry. 

As an example, Rontgen rays passing through air ionize it and 
so render it conducting for a time; wherefore they arc able readil}' to 
discharge electrified bodies in this secondary way. 

It may be convenient here to emphasize the dimensions of an electron 
as above specified, for the arguments in favor of that size are ver}^ 
strong, though not absoluteh" conclusive; we are sure that their mass 
is of the order one thousandth of the atomic mass of hydrogen, and 
we are sure that if they are pui'ely and solely electrical their size must 
be one hundred-thousandth of the linear dimensions of an atom; a size 
with which their penetrating power and other behavior is quite con- 
sistent. Assuming this estimate to be true, it is noteworthy how very 
small these electrical particles are, compared with the atom of matter 



218 MODERN VIEWS ON MATTER. 

to vvliicli tlicv are attached. If an electron is represented by a sphere 
an inch in diameter, the diameter of an atom of matter on the same 
scale is a mile and a half. Or if an atom of matter is represented by 
the size of this theater, an electron is represented on th^ same scale 
by a printer's full stop. It is well to bear this extreme smallness in 
mind in what follows. 

An atom is not a large thing, but if it is composed of electrons, the 
spaces between them are enormous compared with their size — as great 
relative!}^ as are the spaces between the planets in the solar system. 

4. My next thesis is that these electrons or minute-charged cor- 
puscles can exist separately, for they can l)e detached from their atoms 
of matter at an electrode, not only in electrolytic liquids but also in 
gases, and when thus released from their thousandfold more massive 
atom, they flj^ away from the negative electrode with prodigious speed, 
because they are acted on by the same electrical propelling force as 
before, but now have hardly anything to move. 

These isolated flying particles travel a long distance in rarefied 
gas, and are known as cathode rays. They were studied by Hittorf, 
Crookes, Lenard and others, both inside and outside vacuum tubes, 
and they are now known to be flung ofl' spontaneously from many 
substances. When stopped suddenly by a massive obstacle, they give 
rise to the X radiation discovered by Rontgen. At first these cathode 
rays were thought to be atoms of matter, though their extraordinar}^ 
penetrating power rendered such a hypothesis diflicult of belief, and 
caused Crookes to speak of them as matter in a fourth state. They 
are, however, certainly energetic bodies, being abfe to propel light 
windmills, to heat platinum to redness, and to charge an electroscope; 
they are also able to penetrate thin sheets of metal and to affect pho- 
tographic plates or phosphorescent substances on the other side. They 
are not so penetrating, however, as are some of the Rontgen rays. 

The final definite establishment of the fact that these flying par-

stitutc the high-water mark of the world's experiincjital physics during- 
the beginning- of this centurv. 

5. I must not dwell upon the properties and powers of electrons, 
nor upon the experimental means by which these measurements were 
made, for it is far too large a subject. I must exhibit a few diagrams, 
and l)rieily summarize a few main facts. 

Electrons have been shown to be shot off from an}' negatively 
charged body, especially from negatively electritied metals, when 
exposed to ultra-violet light. 

Wheii shot into a mass of air they ionize that air for a time and 
render it electroly tically conducting; also, of course, they can discharge 
positively electritied bodies themselves, and can thus be most readily 
detected in small numbers. 

Electrons in orlntal motion have been shown to constitute the mech- 
anism bv which atoms are able to radiate light; and a great mass of 
semiastronomical facts concerning these orbits and their perturl>ations 
have been obtained by immersing the source of light in a strong mag- 
netic held and observing the minute but ver}' detinite changes of 
spectra thereby produced, a Vjranch of science with which the names 
of H. A. Lorentz, of Leyden, and Zeeman. of Amsterdam, will be 
inseparably associated. 

In all these and other wa3'S the electron has become a familiar 
object. It constitutes the ionic charge of matter. Multiples of it, 
but no fractions, are possible. Its mass, its charge, and its speed 
have ])een frequently measured by different processes, and always with 
consistent results. It is the most definite and fundamental and simple 
unit which we know of in nature. 

It has thus displaced the so-called atom of matter from its funda- 
mental place of indivisibility. The atom of matter has l)een shown 
capable of losing an electron, of having at least one chipped off' it. 
The^ electron has been shown to possess in kind, though not in degree, 
the fundamental properties of the original atom of which it had 
formed a part; and it liecomes a reasonable hypothesis to surmise that 
the whole of the atom may be built up of positive and negative elec- 
trons interleaved together, and of nothing else; an active or charged 
ion having one electron in excess or defect, but the neutral atom 
having an exact number of pairs. The oppositely charged electrons 
are to bethought of on this hypothesis as flying about inside the atom, 
as a few thousand specks like full stops might fly al)Out inside this 
hall, forming a kind of cosmic system under their strong nmtual 
forces, and occupying the otherwise empty region of space which we 
call the atom — occupying it in the same sense that a few scattered l)ut 
armed soldiers can occupy a territory — occupying it by forceful 
activitv, not 1)V bodilv bulk. 



220 MODERN VrEWR ON MATTER. 

('». The hypotheticiil part of the statement about the .size of an elec- 
tron is the followino-. Whereas })oth the mass and the charo-e of an 
electron are known, it is not yet quite certain that the mass is wholly 
due to the charge. It is possible, but to mo very unlikely, that the 
electron, as we know it, contains a material nucleus in addition to its 
charge, so in that case it need not lie so concentrated, because :i portion 
of its mass would be otherwise accounted for. 

I say ''accounted for," but it would be equally true to say " unac- 
counted for." The mass which is explicable electrically is to a con- 
siderable extent understood, but the mass which is merely material 
(whatever that may mean) is not understood at all. We know more 
about electricity than about matter, and the way in which electrical 
inertia is accounted for electromagnetically and localized in the ether 
immediately surrounding- the nucleus of charge is comparatr\'ely clear 
and distinct. 

There may possibly be two different kinds of inertia which exacth^ 
sinudate each other, one electrical and the other material, and those 
who hold this as a reasonable possibility are careful to speak of elec- 
trons as "corpuscles," meaning charged particles of matter of ex- 
tremely small size, much smaller than an atom, consisting of a definite 
electric charge and an unknown material nucleus, which nucleus, as 
the}' recognize, l>ut have not yet finally proved, may quite possibly be 
zero. 

The chief defect in the electrical theorj- of matter at present is that 
the positive electron, if it exists, has never yet been isolated from the 
rest of an atom of matter. It has never been found detached from a 
mass less than the hydrogen atom; whereas the negative electron is 
constantly and freel}' encountered flying about alone, its mass being 
little more than the thousandth part of an atom of hydrogen. 

Until a positive electron can be similarly isolated, the hypothesis 
that an atom is really composed solely of electricity — that is to sa}', of 
equal quantities of positive and negative electricity associated together 
in a certain grouping of little bodies, each of which is nothing more 
than a concentrated charge of electricity of known amount — must 
remain a hypothesis. 

7. It is a fascinating guess that the electrons constitute the funda- 
mental sul)stratum of which all matter is composed; that a grouping 
of, say, TOO electrons, 350 positive and 850 negative, interleaved or 
interlocked in a state of violent motion so as to produce a stable con- 
figuration under the influence of their centrifugal inertia and their 
electric forces, constitutes an atom of hydrogen; that sixteen times 
as many, in another stable grouping, constitute an atom of oxjgen; 
that some 1»),000 of them go to form an atom of sodium, about 1(»0,- 
000 an atom of barium, and 100,000 an atom of radium. 



MODERN VIEWS OIN MATTER. 221 

Oil this view all tiic (^Iciiicnts would l)e regarded us dili'ereiit group- 
ings of one fundamental constituent. Of all the groupings possi])le. 
doubtless most are so unstalile as never to be formed; but some are 
stable, or at least relatively stable, and these stabler groupings consti- 
tute the chemical elements that we know. The fundamental ingredient 
of Avhich, on this view, the whole of matter is made up, is nothing 
more or less than electricity, in the form of an aggregate of an ecjual 
numlter of positive and negative electric charges. 

This, when established, will be a unitication of matter such as has 
through all the ages been sought: it goes further than had l)eeii hoped, 
for the su])stratum is not an unknown and hypothetical protyle. but 
the familiar electric charge. Nevertheless, of course, it is no ultimate 
explanation. The questions remain. What, then, is an electric charge? 
What is the internal structure and constitution of an electron? 
AVherein lies the dili'erence lietween positive and negative electricity? 
and What is their- relation to the ether of space? Definite questions 
these, and dou))tless some day answerable; indeed, powerful methods 
of attack on this position have been already contrived ])y Dr. J. Lar- 
mor and others; ))ut they are questions of a higher order of difHculty 
than those which occupy us to-day, and it must remain for a future 
llomanes lecturer to report progress in these directions, whenever 
adequate progress has, in fact, been made. 

8. That is the end of the first half of my lecture; and six months 
ago that, somewhat expanded, might have been the whole of it, because 
the next portion would have seemed too fanciful; but discoveries have 
been made, chiefly in France and in Canada — some of the most strik- 
ing of them within the present 3^ear — which remove the treatment of 
the next part of m}' subject from the realm of fancT to the region of 
proliability, and justify my proceeding further with some of the theo- 
retical consequences deducible from an electric theory of matter. 

I referred above briefly to the origin of radiation, saying that by 
the method of applying a powerful magnet to a source of light, and 
examining the minute perturbations in the lines of the spectrum thus 
produced, it had been proved that the real source of radiation was an 
electric charge in rapid orbital motion; and 1 now" go on to say that 
by careful measurement of the amount of perturbation it has hccii 
definitely proved that it is our friends the negative electrons, with a 
mass about one thousandth of the smallest known atom of matter, that 
are responsible for the excitation of ether waves or the production of 
light. Larmor and others have, indeed, shown mathematically that 
whenever an electric charge is subject to acceleration, an emission of 
some amount of radiation is inevitable, by reason of the interaction of 
its electric and magnetic fields; and it is proliable that there is no 
other source of light or radiation possible exce})t this change in the 



222 MODERN VIEWS ON MATTER. 

luotioM of electrons. It is known, for inst;ine(% that the \iolent accel- 
eration or retardation of electrons when they (Micounter an obstacle 
is responsible for the excitation of K/intoen rays. All lioht and all 
the Hertz wav^es or pulses employed in wireless telej^raphy are due to 
electric acceleration, and the greater the rate of change of A'elocity 
the more violent is the radiation emitted. 

The charge may oscillate, as in a Hertz vibrator, or it may revolve, 
as in a source of ordinary light, such as a sodium flame. In order to 
emit perceptible radiation by revolving, it must revolve with extreme 
speed in a very small orbit, so that its rate of curvature or centripetal 
acceleration may be considerable; for it is on the square of the value 
of the average acceleration tluit the energy of radiation depends. 

9. All this is of the nature of a definite and certain thesis, but now 
we are going to apply it to our hypothesis that the atom of matter is 
either wholly or partially composed of electrons in a state of vigorous 
motion among themselves. Such revolving or vil)rating electrons are 
subject to acceleration, either radial or tangential, and must therefore 
to a greater or less extent necessarily emit radiation; it becomes 
natural to iiupiire whence comes the energy that is radiated away. 

Now, in ordinary familiar cases it is the irregular agitation of 
jnolecules which we call "heat"' that is being radiated away; and in 
that case the result is a mere cooling, or diminution of the molecular 
agitation, which can readily l)e made up by receipt of similar energy 
fi'oiu the inclosures or from surrounding bodies; or, if not made up, 
it can produce the ordinary well-known efi'ects of ''cold." But to the 
motion of the internal ])ai'tsof an atom the id(^as of heat and tempera- 
ture do not apply. Vho atom, if it lose energy, must lose what is to 
it an essential ingredient, and hence this inevita))le radiating power 
of the constituents of an atom seemed to constitute a difficulty, for it 
suggested that an atom of matter was not really a permanent and 
eternal thing, l)ut that it contained within itself the seeds of its own 
decay and ultimate dissipation into the separate electrons of which it 
was composed. The process might indeed be exceedingly slow, the 
radiation loss might be almost imperceptible, but, in so far as an atom 
is composed of revolving electrons, it is inevitable that radiation of 
energy nuist go on from it, and that this nuist in the long run have 
some perceptible degenerative result. 

10. That result has quite recently, I believe, been experimentally 
discovered, and is a part of the phenomenon known as '* radio-activity." 

So now we come to the uiost remarkable and probably the most inter- 
esting step of all. 

The phenomenon of spontaneous radio-activity, discovered lirst by 
Becquerel in uranium and thorium, and greatly extended by the bril- 
liant chemical researches of M. and Mme. Curie which resulted in the 
discovery of radium, was at first supposed to consist in the emission of 



MODERN VIEWS ON MATTER. 223 

a sort of X rav.s or ether pulses; and was sii])se([uently assiuned to eon- 
sist ehieflv in the bodily emission of ch^ctrons, which were sliot oti' 
from the radio-active substance as they are from a negative electrode 
in a vacuum tube, or as they are in air when ultra-violet lig-ht falls 
upon clean negatively charged surfaces. 

As a matter of fact, both these modes of radiation — the wave form 
and the corpuscular form — are emitted by radio-active bodies, l)ut 
they turn out to be of subordinate importance, and must be regarded 
as secondar}' or subsidiary results of the main phenomenon. 

The main fact of radio-activity has been shown by Professor 
Rutherford, of Montreal, in a paper published in the month of Feb- 
ruary this very 3"ear, to consist in the flinging- nwny with g-reat violence 
of actual atoms of matter — atoms electrihed indeed, but not negatively 
like electrons, and not small or penetrating like them, but full-sized 
atoms, such as are easily stopped by a thin sheet of metal, or even 
by a sheet of paper — atoms which are positiveh" charged and possessed 
of a remarkable amount of energy, ionizing the air which they bom- 
bard to an extj-aordinary extent, and likewise generating quite a per- 
ceptible amount of heat wherever they strike; producing indeed a flash 
when they strike a suitable target, as Crookes has shown, quite like 
the impact of a cannon ball on an armor plate. Their speed, indeed, 
far exceeds that of any cannon ball that ever existed, being as much 
faster than a cannon ball as that is faster than a snail's crawl; a 
hundred times faster than the fastest flying star, these atomic pro- 
jectiles constitute the fastest moving matter known. This furious 
bombardment from a radio-active substance continues without inter- 
mission and apparenth' Avithout sign of diminution or cessation. There 
is ever}^ reason to believe that a minute scrap of radium, scarcely per- 
ceptible to the eye. may go on emitting these energetic projectiles for 
hundreds of years. 

11. At first sight the fact that it is merely atoms of matter which 
are being flung ofl' b^' most radio-active substances, and that ethereal 
and other efi'ects are subsidiarv to this emission of substance, seems 
to lessen the interest attaching to the phenomenon, reducing it to 
something of merely chemical importance and suggesting a resem- 
blan(;e to scent or other volatilization from solid bodies. But Professor 
Rutherford, with great skill, succeeded in determining appi'oximatel}^ 
the atomic weight of the uttiM-ly imperceptible amount of substance 
thrown ofl', as well as its speed, and found that it was not l)y ai'.y in<>ans 
the radio-active substance itself which was evaporating, l)ut something 
quite difl'erent. 

Plainly, if an elementary form of matter is found to ])e throwing 
ofl' anothiM' substance, it becomes inqDcrative to iii(|uire what that sub- 
stance is and what it is that is left l)ehind. Now, tlu^ atomic weight of 
radium, or of thcn-ium or uranium, or of anv known stronglv radio- 



224 MODERN VIEWS ON MATTER. 

active substance, i.s very hioh, in each case over two hundred times the 
atomic weiglit of hydrogen, whereas the atomic weight of the substance 
flung olf appears to be more nearly of the order one or two; in other 
words, the suljstance thrown off is more likely to be either hydrogen 
or helium than it is likely to be radium. It is just possible that the 
inert chemical elements are b} -products of radio-activity. 

Now, clearly here is a fact, if fact it be, of prodigious importance. 
Undoubtedl}' the nu^asurements require conflrmation, but for m3\self 
I see no reason to doubt them, at least as regards their order of magni- 
tude. The atomic weight of radium being, sa}^, 225, and that of the 
projoctt'd portion Ix^ing, say, 2, the residue must represent by its 
atomic weight the difference between the heavy atom of the original 
substance and that of the light atom or atoms which have been flung 
away, unless indeed it he assumed, as it will almost certainly be 
assumed 1)}^ some skeptical chemists, those who derided argon and 
other chemical discoveries when made in a physical manner, that the 
substance flung away is some foreign ingredient or impurity — a 
h^'pothesis, I venture to say, already strongly against the weight of 
availal)le evidence. 

The su])stance left behind in the pores of the radio-active substance 
has 1)een examined even more completely than the projected portion; 
it is volatile, it slowly diffuses awa}^, and it behaves like a gas. It can 
be stor(»d in gas holders when mixed with air, for in amount it is quite 
imp(n-ceptible to all ordinary tests; and yet it can be passed through 
pipes and otherwise dealt with. It condenses not far al)ove the tem- 
perature of liquid air, and it is itself radio-active, but in such a way 
that its power decays rapidly with time. Its radio-activity seems to 
consist likewise in throwing away part of itself and leaving yet anothei" 
residue, likewise radio-active; and one of the residues so left seems 
idtimately to pitch away electrons simply instead of atoms of matter. 
It is not to I)e supposed that thorium and radium and uranium all 
behave alike in details. The emanation of one may lose its activity 
rapidly, and give rise to another substance which retains its power for 
some time; the emanation of another element may last some time and 
generate a sulistance whose activity rapidly decays, but into these details 
it is not now the place to go. 

12. Assuming the truth of this strange string of laboratory facts, 
we appear to be face to face wdth a phenomenon quite new in the his- 
tory of the world. No one has hitherto observed the transition from 
one form of matter to another, though throughout the Middle Ages 
such a tr^nsnmtation was looked for. The transmutation of elements 
has been suspected in modern times on evidence vaguely deducible by 
skilled observers from the spectroscopic details of solar and stellar 
appearances. The evolution of matter has likewise been suspected by 
a few chemists of genius. It was perceived, on the strength of Men- 
delejefl''s law, that the elements form a kind of family or related series, 



MODERN VIEWS ON MATTER. 225 

and it was surmised that })<)ssil)ly the bari'iors bctwoen one species and 
the next were not al)sohit(^ly infran_oihl(>, hut that temporary transi- 
tional forms might occur. All this was sp(^culation; hut here in radio- 
active matter the process appears to l)e going on l)et'ore our eyes. 
Professor Rutherford and ^Tr. Soddy. who in Canada during the present 
year have worked hard and admirably at the sul)ject, have adduced 
.facts which point clearly in this direction; and thev initially describe 
what appear to bo the tirst links of a chain of substances, all produced 
in hopelessly minute (puintities reckoned by ordinary tests, but which 
yet by electrical means can easily be detected, and their l)oiling points 
and other properties investigated. Moreover, the investigators of 
these strange substances are able to dissolve and precipitate, and per- 
form ordinary chemical operations on, these utterly imponderable and 
hopelessly mimite deposits of I'adio-active substances, 1)ecause of the 
powerful means of detection which their ionizing power puts into our 
hands — even a few stray atoms being able by their ionizing power to 
discharge an electroscope appreciably. 

18. Thus, then, it would appear that our theoretical conclusion con- 
cerning the inevitable radiation and loss of energy from electrically 
constituted atoms of matter, a loss wdiich must involve them in neces- 
sary change and dissolution, meets with quite unexpectedi}' rapid con- 
firmation, and it is for that reason that I feel willing to accept tenta- 
tively and as a working 'hypothesis this explanation of radio-activity. 
It represents a fact previously wanted on theoretical grounds. For 
how is radio-activity to be explained? It looks as if the massive and 
extremely complex atoms of a radio-active suljstance were liable to get 
into an unstable condition, probably reaching this condition whenever 
any part of it attempts or is urged to move with the velocity of light. 
I have showni elsewhere" that the mere fact of radiation will act as a 
resisting medium and increase the speed of the particles automatically, 
on the same principle that a comet would be accelerated if it met with 
resistance, since the inverse-square law applies to electrical central 
forces. Electrical mass is not strictly constant; it is a function of 
speed, but in such a wa}' that it is practically^ constant until the velocity 
of light is very nearly attained. That is a critical velocity, wdiich 
apparently can not be surpassed. When this critical speed is reached 
any electrilied bod}" becomes suddenly of infinite mass, and something 
is boimd to happen. AVhat that something is, it is not easy theoret- 
ically to say, but the partial or incipient disintegration or dissociation 
of the atom and the flying away of a portion with a speed compara])le 
to that of light is no unlikcdy result. 

Out of the whole multitude of atoms, even of the atoms of a con- 
spicuously radio-active substance, it is prol)al>le that only a very few 
get into this unstable or critical condition at any one time; perhaps not 

f'^ee. Nature, June 11, 190.3. 



22fi MODERN VIEWS ON MATTER. 

more t!i;iii one in a million million. Nevertheless, just as oecasional 
thouuli rare encounters take place in the heavens, followed by the 
l»]aze of a new and temporary stai", so, though probal)ly not l)v the 
same mechanism, liere and there a few out of the billions of atoms in 
any perceptilile speck of radium arrive in due time at the unstal^le con- 
dition and break down into something else, with energetic radio- 
activity during the sudden collapsing process, emitting in the process 
of collapse not only the main projected substance, but likewise also a 
few electrons and those X rays which always accompany a sudden 
electric jerk or recoil. And the X rays so emitted are of the most 
penetrating kind knowMi. being able to pass through an inch of solid 
iron in perceptible quantity. 

1-i. The hypothesis concerning radio-activity which is now in the 
field, then, is that a very small numl)er — an almost infinitesimal pro- 
portion — of the atoms are constantly breaking up. throwing away a 
small portion, say 1 per cent, of themselves with innnense violence 
at about one-tenth of the speed of light; the remainder constitute a 
slightly diti'erent substance, which, however, is still extremely unstable, 
and therefore radio-active, going through its stages with nuich greater 
rapidity than the radium itself, because practically the whole of it is 
in tlie unstable condition,. and so giving rise to fresh and fresh products 
of its oAvn decay, till a comparativel}' stable state is reached, or till the 
process passes beyond our means of detection. 

Roughly, the process may l)e likened in some respects to the con- 
densation or contraction of a ne])ula. The particles constituting a 
whirling nebula fall togetlier until the centrifugal fc^rceof the periph- 
eral portions exceeds the gravitative pull of the central mass, and then 
they are shrunk off and left ludiind, afterwards agglomerating into a 
planet, wliile the residue goes on shrinking and evolving fresh bodies 
and generating heat. A nebvila is not hot, l)ut it has an immense store 
of potential energy, some of which it can turn into heat, and so form 
a hot central nucleus or sun. A radium atom is not hot, but it, too, 
has a great store of potential energy, innnense in proportion to its 
mass, for it is controlled by electrical, not by gravitational forces; and 
just as the falling together of the solar material generates heat, so 
that a shrinkage of a few yards per century can account for all its 
tremendous emission, so it has been calculated that the collapsing of 
the electrical constituents of a radium atom, by so little as 1 per 
cent of their distance apart, can supply the whole of the energy of 
the observed radiation — large though that is — for something like 
thirty thousand years. 

15. It does not follow that the life of a piece of radimn is as great 
as that; the data are uncertain at present, but there is absolutely no 
ground for the popular and gratuitous surmise that it emits energy 
without loss or waste of any kind, and that it is competent to go on 
forever. The idea, atone time ii-responsibly mooted, that it contra-

dieted the priiieiple of the conservation of energy, and was troubling 
physicists with the idea that the}' must overhaul their theories — a 
thing which they ought always to be deHghted to do on good evi- 
dence — this idea was a gratuitous absurdity and never had the slightest 
foundation; l)ut the notion that radium was perhaps able to draw upon 
some unknown source or store of energ}^, without itself suffering loss, 
was a possibility which has not yet wholly disappeared from some 
minds. Sir W. Crookes, for instance, suggested that it might some- 
how utilize the most quickly moving atoms of air, after the fashion of 
a Maxwell demon — a possibility that should always be borne in mind 
as a conceivable explanation of the power of some living organisms. 
It is much more reasonable to suppose, however, that radium and the 
other like substances are drawing upon their own stores of internal 
atomic energy, and thereby gradually disintegrating and falling into 
other, and ultimateh* into more stable, forms of matter. 

Not that it is to be supposed that even these are finally and abso- 
lutel}^ stable; these, too, are subject to radiation loss, and so must be 
lial)le to decay, but at a vastly slower rate, perhaps not more than a 
few hundred atoms changing and difl'using away each second — a process 
utterly imperceptil)le to the most delicate weighing until after the lapse 
of millions of .years, so that for all practical purposes, and for times 
such as are dealt with in cosmic histor}^, they are permanent, even as 
the solar system and stellar aggregates appear to us to l)e permanent. 
Yet we know that all these systems are in reality transitory, as terres- 
trial structures like the p3^ramids or as the mountains and the conti- 
nents themsehes are transitory; of all these things it may ])e said that 
in any given form they have their da}' and cease to l)e. But whereas 
geological and astronomical contigurations pass through their phases 
in a time to })e reckoned in millions of years, the active life of a solar 
system covering perhaps no very long period, it is probal)le that tbe 
changes we have begun to suspect in the foundation stones of the uni- 
verse, the more stable elemental atoms themselves, nuist require a period 
to be expressed only by millions of millions of centuries. For in such 
a time as this, at the rate of a hundred atoms per second, a bare kilo- 
gram — a couple of pounds only — of matter, even of heavy matter, 
would have drifted away, 'not so nuich indeed — a couple of ounces 
more likely. And yet this period is a million times the estimated age 
of the earth. 

16. If we allow ourselves to speculate on the strength of the slender 
experimental evidence as yet forthcoming, instead of waiting, as to be 
wise we nuist wait, for contirmation and thorough examination of the 
facts, we should say that the whole of existing matter appears liable 
to processes of change, and in lliut sense to he a ti'ansient phenomenon. 

Somehow, we might conjecture, by some means at present unknown, 
it takes its rise: electrons of opposite sign crystallizing or falling 
together, perhaps at first into a manifestly unstable form; these forms 



228 MODEKN VIEWS ON MATTER. 

then pass on from one into another, going- through a series of transi- 
tional states, and abiding for a long time in those contigurations which 
are most stable; giving a process of evolution inconceivably slow in 
its later stages, comparatively rapid in its early ones, and yet not so 
rapid, even in a substance like radium, but that its life as such may 
be reckoned by thousands of years. 

If such a transitory existence is ever established for the forms of 
matter as we know them, it by no means follows that the process goes 
on in one direction only, or that the total amount of matter in the 
universe is subject to diminution. There may be regeneration as well 
as degeneration. 

The total amount of radio-activity in a substance is singularly con- 
stant. If the radio-active portion is removed, a fresh supply makes 
its appearance at a measured rate, that rate being expressible by a 
decreasing geometrical progression, and being precisely equal to the 
rate at which the power of the removed portion decays. 

Whether the total amount of matter in the universe is constant 
likewise, as much disappearing at one end by resolution into electrons 
as is formed at the other end by their aggregating together, is at 
present ()uite unknown; and, indeed, it is clear that we have now become 
far immersed in the region of speculation. Nevertheless, it is specula-' 
tion not of an illegitimate character, for it is ver}^ consistent with all 
that we know about the rest of the material uni\erse. 

Astronomy tells us that the cosmic scheme, though it looks perma- 
nent, is subject to constant flux. In the sky we see solar systems and 
suns in process of formation by aggregation out of nebula?; we see 
them rise in brillianc}', maintaining a number of planets in health and 
activity for a time, and then slowly become subject to decay and death. 
What happens after that is not certainly known. It may be that by col- 
lision a nebula mav be reconstituted and the process started again; 
though so long as there is only a force of one sign at work (gravitation 
onl}') it would seem that ultimately the regenerative process must 
come to an end. The repellent force exerted by light upon small 
particles, however, must not be forgotten; it can overcome gravitation 
when it acts on small enough ])odies; and there are other possibilities. 
Among the parts of an atom certainly the forces are conspicuously not 
of one sign. Inside an atom there exist both attractive and repulsive 
forces. The resolution of an atom into its electron constituents, and 
the aggregation of these constituents into fresh atoms, are both per- 
fectly^ thinkable. All we have to do is to ascertain by careful and 
patient investigation wliat really happens; and my experience has led 
me to feel sure of this — that whatever hypotheses and speculations we 
may frame, we can not exceed the reality in genuine wonder; and I 
believe that the simplicity and beauty of the truth concerning even 
the material universe, when we know it, will be such as to elicit feel- 
ino's of reverent awe and adoration. 



MODERN VIEWS ON MATTER: THE REALIZATION OF A 

DREAM." 



By Sir "William Ckookes, F. Tl. S., etc. 



For nearly a century men who devote themselves to science have 
been dreaniino- of atoms, molecules, ultramundane particles, and specu- 
lating as to the origin of matter; and now to-da}- they have got so far 
as to admit the possibility of resolving the chemical elements into 
simpler forms of matter, or even of refining them altogether awa}" into 
ethereal vibrations of electrical energy. 

This dream has been essentiall}' a British dream, and we have become 
speculative and imaginative to an audacious extent, almost belying our 
character of a purely practical nation. The notion of impenetrable 
mysteries has been dismissed. A nn^stery is a thing to be solved — 
"and man alone can master the impossible." There has been a vivid 
new start. Our physicists have remodeled their views as to the con- 
stitution of matter and as to the complexity if not the actual decom- 
posability of the chemical elements. To show how far we have been 
propelled on the strange new road, how dazzling are the wonders that 
waylay the researcher, we have but to recall — matter in a fourth state, 
the genesis of the elements, the dissociation of the chemical elements, 
the existence of bodies smaller than atoms, the atomic nature of elec- 
tricit}', the perception of electrons, not to mention other dawning 
marvels far removed from the lines of thought usually associated with 
English chemistry. 

The earliest definite suggestion in the last century of the possible 
compound nature of the elements occurs in a lecture delivered in 1809'^ 
by Sii- Humphry Davy at the Royal Institution. In that memorable 
lecture he speculated on the existence of some substance common to 
all the metals, and he averred that "If such generalizations should be 
supported by facts, a new, a simple, and a grand philosophy would 
be the result. From the combination of diflerent quantities of two or

three species of ponderable mattei' we niiuht conceive all the diversity 
of material substances to owe their constitution." 
Again, in 1811, he said:" 

It will be useless to speculate upon the consequences of such an advancement in 
chemistry as that of the decomposition and composition of the metals. * * * It 
is the duty of a chemist to be bold in pursuit. He must not consider things as 
impracticable merely because they have not yet been effected. He must not regard 
them as unreasonable because they do not coincide with popular opinion. He 
must recollect how contrary knowledge sometimes is to what appears to be experi- 
ence. * * * To inquire whetlier the metals t)e capable of being decomposed and 
composed is a grand object of true philosophy. 

Davy tirst used the term ''radiant matter" about 1809, l)ut chiefly 
in connection with what is now called '"radiation." He also used the 
term in another sense, and the following passage^ in its clear forecast 
is prophetic of the modern electron: 

If particles of gases were made to move in free space with an almost infinitely great 
velocity — i. e., to become radiant matter — they might produce the different species 
of rays, so distinguished by their peculiar effects. 

In his lectures at the Royal Institution, in 1816, "On the general 
properties of matter," another prescient chemist, Farada}^ used simi- 
lar terms when he said: 

If we conceive a change as far beyond vaporization as that is above fluidity, and 
then take into account also the proi)ortioiial increased extent of alteration as the 
changes rise, we shall, perhaps, if we can form any conception at all, not fall far 
short of radiant matter; and as in the la.st conversion many cjualities were lost, so 
here also many more would disappear. 

Again, in one of his early lectures he strikes a forward note: 

At j)resent we begin to feel impatient and to wish for a new state of chemical ele- 
ments. To decompose the metals, to re-form them, and to realize the once absurd 
notion of transnmtation are the problems now given to the chemist for solution. 

But Faraday was always remarkable for the boldness and originality 
with which he regarded generally accepted theories. In 1844 he said: 

The view that physical chemistry necessarily takes of atoms is now very large and 
complicated; first many elementary atoms — next compound and complicated atoms. 
System within system, like the starry heavens, may be right — but may be all wrong. 

A 3 ear later Faraday startled the world by a discovery to which he 
gave the title "On the magnetization of light and the illumination 
of the magnetic lines of force." For fifty 3'ears this title was mis- 
understood and was attributed to enthusiasm or confused ideas. But 
to-day we begin to see the full significance of the Faraday dream. 

It was not till 1896 that Zeeman showed a spectrum line could ))e 
acted on 1)ya magnetic field. A spectrum line is caused by motion of 
the electron acting on the ether, which can only move and be moved

by the electron. A uui(^netie iiekl resolves this motion into other 
component motions — some slower, others (juicker — and thus causes a 
single line to split into others of g-reater and less refrangibilit}" than 
the parent line. 

In 1879, in a lecture I delivered before the British Association " at 
Sheffield, it fell to my lot to revive "radiant matter."" I advanced the 
theory that in the phenomena of the vacuum tube at high exhaustions 
the particles constituting the cathode stream are not solid, nor liquid, 
nor gaseous, do not consist of atoms propelled through the tube and 
causing luminous, mechanic, or electric phenomena where they strike, 
"but that they consist of something nuich smaller than the atom — 
fragments of matter, ultra-atomic corpuscles, minute things, very 
much smaller, very much lighter than atoms — things which appear to 
bo the foundation stones of which atoms are composed."'^ 

1 further demonstrated that the physical properties of radiant matter 
arc common to all matter at this low density — " Whether the gas origi- 
nally undei" experiment be hydrogen, carbon dioxide, or atmospheric 
air, the phenomena of phosphorescence, shadows, magnetic deflection, 
etc., are identical." Here are my words, written nearly a (juarter of 
a centur}" ago: "We have actually touched the border land where 
matter and force seem to merge into one another'" — the shadowy realm 
between the known and unknown. I venture to think that the greatest 
scientific problems of the future will find their solution in this t)order 
land, and even beyond; here, it seems to me, lie ultimate realities, 
sul)tlc, far-reachinc^, wonderful." 

It was not till 1881 that J. J. Thomson established the basis of the 
electro-dynamic theory. In a very remarkable memoir in the Philo- 
sophical Magazine he explained the phosphorescence of glass under 
the influence of the cathode stream by the nearly abrupt changes in 
the magnetic tield arising from the sudden stoppage of the cathode 
particles. 

The now generally accepted view that our chemical elements have 
been formed from one primordial substance was advocated in 1888 by 
me when president of the Chemical Society,'^ in connection with a 
theory of the genesis of the elements. I spoke of "an infinite num- 
ber of immeasurabh' small ultimate — or, rather, ultimatissimate — 
particles gradually accreting out of the formless mist, and moving 
with inconceivable velocity in all directions." 

Pondering on some of the properties of the rare elements, I strove 
to show that the elementary atoms themselves might not be the same

now as when tir.st j^enenited — that the primary motions wdiich consti- 
tnto the (wistence of the atom mi^ht slowly be ehanjiing, and eyen the 
secondaiT motions which pi-odnee all the eti'ects we can ol)serye — heat, 
chemic, electric, etc. — mi<>ht in a slight degree l)e affected; and I 
showed the pi'obability that the atoms of the chemical elements were 
not eternal in existence, but shared with the rest of Creation the attri- 
butes of decay and death. 

The same idea was expanded at a lecture I deliyered at the Royal 
Institution in 1887, when it was suggested that the atomic weights 
were not inyariable ((uantities. 

1 might ([note Mr. Herbert Spencer, Sir Benjamin Brodie, Professor 
Graham, Sir George Stokes, Sir William Thomson (now Lord Kelvin), 
Sir jSoi'man Lockyer, Doctor Gladstone, and many other English men 
of science to show that the notion, not necessaril\' of the decompos- 
a])ility, ))ut at any rate of the complexity of our supposed elements, 
has long l)een "in the air" of science waiting to take more definite 
deyelopment. Our minds are gradually getting accustomed to the idea 
of the genesis of the elements, and many of us are straining for the 
tirst glimpse of the resolution of the chemical atom. We are eager to 
enter the portal of the mysterious region too readily ticketed "Unknown 
and Unknowable." 

Another phase of the dream now demsinds attention. I come to the 
earlier glimpses of the electric theory of matter. 

Passing over the yaguer specidations of Faraday and the more 
positive speculations of Sir William Thomson (now Lord Kelvin), one 
of the earliest definite statements of this theory is given in an article 
in the Fortnightly Reyiew for June, 1875, by W. K. Clifford, a man 
who in common with other pioneers shared that "noblest misfortune 
of being born before his time.'" "There is great reason to ))elieye," 
said Clifford, "that every material atom carries upon it a small electric 
current, if it does not wholly consist of this current." 

In 1886, when president of the chemical section of the British asso- 
ciation, in a speculation on the origin of matter, I drew a picture of 
the gradual formation of the chemical elements by the workings of 
three forms of energy — electricity, chemism, and temperature — on the 
"formless mist" (protyle"), ydierein all matter was in the preatomic 
state — potential rather than actual. In this scheme the chemical 
elements owe their stability to their being the outcome of a struggle 
for existence — a Darwinian deyelopment by chemical evolution — a 
surviyal of the most stable. Those of lowest atomic weight would 
first be formed, then those of intermediate weight, and finally the

primal matter existing ])efore the evolution of the chemical elements. The word 1 
venture to use is composed of nfjo (earlier than) and rA;/ (the stuff of which things 
are made).

elements having the highest titoniic weights, such us thorium ;ind 
uranium. I spoke of the " dissociution point" of the elements, 
' ' What comes after uranium 'i "" I asked. And I answered back — ' ' The 
result of the next step Avill be * * " the formation of * * * 
compounds the dissociation of which is not beyond the powers of our 
terrestrial sources of heat." A dream less than twenty years ago, but 
a dream which daih" draws nearer to entire and vivid fultillment. I 
will presently show 3'ou that radium, the next after uranium, does 
actually and spontaneously dissociate. 

The idea of units or atoms of electricity — an idea hitherto floating 
intangibly like helium in the sun — can now be brought to earth and 
submitted to the test of experiment." Faraday, W.Weber, Laurentz, 
Gauss, Zollner, Hertz, Helmholtz, Johnstone Stoney, Sir Oliver 
Lodge, have all contributed to develope the idea, originally due to 
Weber, which took concrete form when Stoney showed that Faraday'^ 
law of electroh^sis involved the existence of a definite charge of elec- 
tricity associated with the ions of matter. This definite charge he 
called an electron. It was not till some time after the name had been 
given that electrons were found to be capable of existing separately. 

In 1891, in my inaugural address as president of the Institution of 
Electrial Engineers,^ I showed that the stream of cathode rays near the 
negative pole was alwa3^s negatively electrified, the other contents of 
the tube being positively electrified, and I explained that ''the division 
of the molecule into groups of electro-positive and electro-negative 
atoms is necessary for a consistent explanation of the genesis of the 
elements." In a ^^acuum tube the negative pole is the entrance and 

""The equivalent weights of bodies are simply those quantities of them which 
contain equal quantities of electricity; * * * it being. the electricity which deter- 
mines the equivalent number, because it determines the combining force. Or, if we 
adopt the atomic theory or phraseology, then the atoms of bodies which are equiva- 
lents to each other in their ordinary chemical action, have equal quantities of 
electricity naturally associated with them." — Faraday's Experimental Researches in 
Electricity, jjar. 869, January, 1834. 

"This definite quantity of electricity we shall call the molecular charge. If it 
were known it v^ould be the most natural unit of electricity." — Clerk Maxwell's 
Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, first edition. Vol. I, 1873, p. 311. 

"Nature presents us with a single definite quantity of electricity. * * * For 
each chemical bond which is ruptured within an electrolyte a certain quantity of 
electricity traverses the electrolyte, which is the same in all cases." — (i. Johnstone 
Stoney, On the Physical Units of Nature, British Association meeting, Section A, 1874. 

"The same definite quantity of either positive or negative electricity moves always 
with each univalent ion, or with every unit of affinity of a multivalent ion." — Helm- 
holtz, Faraday Lecture, 1881. 

"Every monad atom has asso(M:ilc(l witli it a certain definite ciuautity of (■Icctricity; 
every dyad has twice this (piantit}' associated with it; every triad tliree times as 
much, and so on." — O. Lodge, On I'-lectrolysis, British Association Keport, 1885.

the positive pole the exit for electrons. Falling on a pliosphore.seent 
body, yttria, for instance — a collection of Hertz molecular resonators — 
the electrons excite vibrations of, say, 550 billion times a second, pro- 
ducing ether waves of the approximate length of 5.75 ten-millionths 
of a millimeter, and occasioning in the eye the sensation of citron- 
colored light. If, however, the electrons dash against a heavy metal, 
they produce ether waves of a far higher frecpienc}^ than light and 
are not continuous vibrations, l)ut, according to Sir George Stokes, 
simple shocks or solitary impulses, more like discordant shouts as 
compared with nuisical notes. 

During that address an experiment was shown which went far to 
prove the dissociation of silver into electrons and positive atoms. "■ A 
silver pole was used, and near it in front was a sheet of mica with a 
hole in its center. The vacuum was very high, and when the poles 
were connected with the coil, the silver being negative, electrons shot 
from it in all directions, and passing through the liole in the mica 
screen formed a bright phosphorescent patch on the opposite side of 
the bulb. The action of the coil was continued for some hours to 
volatilize a certain portion of the silver. Silver was seen to be 
deposited on the mica screen only in the immediate neighborhood of 
the pole; the far end of the bulb, which had been glowing for hours 
from the impact of electrons, being free from silver deposit. Here, 
then, are two sinuiltaneous actions. Electrons or radiant matter shot 
from the negative pole caused the glass against which the}' struck to 
glow with phosphorescent light. Simultaneously, the heavy positive 
ions of silver, freed from negative electrons and under the influence 
of the electrical stress, likewise flew ofl: and were deposited in the 
metallic state near the pole. The ions of metal thus deposited in all 
cases showed positive elect ritication.* 

In the 3"ears 1893-1895 a sudden impulse was given to electric vacuum 
work b}" the publication in Germany of the remarkable results obtained 
by Lenard and Rontgen, who showed that the phenomena inside the 
vacumn tube were surpassed in interest by what took place outside. 
It is not too much to say that from this date wdiat had been a scientilic 
conjecture became a sober reality. 

One important advance in theoretic knowledge has heen ol)tained by 
Dewar, the successor of Faraday in the classic laboratories of the 
Royal Institution. Soon after Rontgen's discovery Dewar found that 
the relative opacit}' to the Rontgen rays was in proportion to the 
atomic weights of bodies, and he was the first to apply this principle 
to settling a debated point in connection with argon. Argon is rela- 
tively more opaque to the Rontgen raj^s than either oxygen, nitrogen, 

"In describing the experiment, one of fundamental importance, modern terms are 
empioyed. 

''Proc. Roy. 8oc.,A'ol. LXIX, p. 421. 



MODERN VIEWS ON MATTER. 235 

or sodiimi, and from this Dewar inferred that the atomic weight of 
argon was twice its density relative to hydrogen. In the light of 
to-day's researches on the constitution of atoms it is impossible to 
overestimate the importance of this discovery. * 

In 1896 Becquerel, pui'suing the masterly work on phosphorescence 
inaugurated by his illustrious father, showed that the salts of uranium 
constantl}" emit emanations, which have the power of penetrating 
opaque substances and of affecting a photographic plate in total dark- 
ness, and of discharging an electrometer. In some respects these 
emanations, known as "Becquerel rays," behave like rays of light, but 
they also resemble Rontgen rays. Their real character has onh^ recentl}^ 
been ascertained, and even now there is much that is obscure and pro- 
visional in the explanation of their constitution and action. 

Following closel}" upon BecquereVs work came the l)rilliant researches 
of M. and Mme. Curie on the radio-activity of bodies accompanying 
uranium. 

Hitherto I have been recounting isolated instances of scientific specu- 
lation with apparently little relation to one another. The existence 
of matter in an ultra gaseous state; material particles smaller than 
atoms; the existence of electrical atoms or electrons; the constitution 
of Kontgen rays and their passage through opaque bodies: the emana- 
tions from uranium; the dissociation of the elements — all these isolated 
hypotheses are now focussed and welded into one harmonious theory 
by the discover}^ of radium. 

Often do the spirits 

Of great events stride on before the events, 

And in to-day already walks to-morrow. 

No new discovery is ever made without its influence ramifying in 
all directions and explaining much that before had been m3^stifying. 
Certainly no discovery of modern times has had such wide-embracing 
consequences and thrown such a flood of light on broad regions of 
hitherto inexplicable phenomena as this discovery of M, and Mme, 
Curie and M. Bemont, who patiently and laboriouslv plodded along a 
road bristling with difficulties almost insuperable to others who, like 
myself, have toiled in similar labyrinths of research. The crowning 
point of these labors is radium. 

Let me briefly recount some of the properties of radium and show 
how it reduces speculations and dreams, apparently impossible of 
proof, to a conci'ete form. 

Radium is a metal of the calcium, strontium, and barium group. 
Its atomic weight, according to C. Runge and J. Precht, is probably 
about 2.58. In this case it occupies the third place below barium in 
my lenmiscate spiral scheme of the elements," two unoccupied gaps 
intervening. 

"Proc. Roy. So.-., Vol. LXITT, p. 409,. 



236 MODERN VIEWS ON MATTER. 

The spectrum of radiuiii has several well-detined lines; these I have 
photoo-raphed and have also measured their wave lengths. Two espe- 
cially ai-e stronj^- and characteristic — one at wave length 3649.71, and 
the other at Wave length 3814.5s, These lines enal)le radium to be 
detected spectroscopically. 

The most striking property of radium is its power to pour out tor- 
rents of emanations l)earing a certain resemblance to llcintgen rays, 
but differing in important points. 

The emanations of radium cause soda glass to assume a violet color, 
and they produce many chemical changes. Their physiological action 
is strong, a few milligrams brought near the skin in a few hours 
producing a wound difficult to heal. 

The emanations from radium are of three kinds. One set is the 
same as the cathode stream, now identified with free electrons — atoms 
of electricity projected into space apart from gross matter — identical 
with "matter in the fourth or ultragaseous state," Kelvin's "satel- 
lites," Thomson's " corpuscles" or "particles;" Lodge's " disembodied 
ionic charges, retaining individuality and identit}"." These electrons 
are neither ether waves nor a form of energy, but substance possess- 
ing inertia (probably electric). Liberated electrons are exceedingly 
penetrating. They will discharge an electroscope when the radium is 
10 feet or more awa}', and will affect a photographic plate through 
5 or 6 millimeters of lead and several inches of wood or aluminum. 
They are not readil}^ filtered out by cotton-wool; they do not behave 
as a gas, i. e., they have not properties dependent on intercollisions. 
mean free path, etc. ; they act more like a fog or mist, are mobile and 
carried about by a current of air to which the}^ give temporary con- 
ducting powers, clinging to positively electrified bodies and thereby 
losing mobility and difl'using on the walls of the containing vessel if 
left (piict. 

Electrons are deviable in a magnetic field. They are shot from 
radium with a velocity of about one-tenth that of light, but are grad- 
ually obstructed liy collisions with air atoms, so that some become 
much slowed, and then are what 1 formerly called loose and erratic 
particles, which diffuse about in the air and give it temporary con- 
ducting powers. These can turn corners, can be concentrated by mica 
cones into a bundle and then produce phosphorescence. 

Another set of emanations from radium are not affected hy an ordi- 
narily powerful magnetic field and are incapable even of passing 
through thin material obstructions. These emanations have al>out one 
thousand times the energ}^ of those radiated ])y the deflectable particles. 
They render air a conductor and act strongly on a photographic plate. 
Their mass is enormous in comparison with that of the electrons, 
and their velocit}^ is probably as great when they leave the radium, 
but, in consequence of their greater mass, the}^ lire less deflected by 



MODiERN VIEWS ON MATTER. 237 

the magnet, are easily obstructed ])y obstacles, and are sooner brought 
to rest by collisions with air atoms. The lion. R. B. Strutt" was the 
first to affirm that these nondetlectable rays are the positive ions 
moving- in a stream from the radio-active )>()dy. 

Rutherford has shown that these emanations are slightly atfected 
in a ver}^ powerful magnetic field, but in an opposite direction to 
the negative electrons. They are therefore proved to be positively 
charged bodies moving with great velocity. For the first time Ruther- 
ford has measured their speed and mass, and he shows they are ions 
of matter moving with a speed of the order of that of light. 

There is also a third kind of emanation produced Ijy radium. 
Besides the highly penetrating rays deflected by a magnet, there are 
very penetrating rays not at all afl'ected by magnetism. These accom- 
pan}^ the previous emanations, and are Rcintgen rays — ether vibra- 
tions — produced as secondary phenomena by the sudden arrest of 
velocity of the electrons by solid matter, producing a series of Stoke- 
sian "pulses'' or explosive ether waves shot into space. 

Many lines of argument and research tending toward the same point 
give trustworthy data b}^ Avhich to calculate the masses and velocities 
of these different particles. I must deal with big figures, l>ut big and 
little are relative and are onl}" of importance in relation to the limita- 
tions of our senses. I will take as the standard the atom of hydrogen 
gas — the smallest material bod}^ hitherto recognized. The mass of an 
electron is one seven-hundredths of an atom of h3'drogen, or 3 X 10~-^ 
gram, according to J. J. Thomson, and its velocity is 2 X 10'' centi- 
meters per second, or two-thirds that of light. The kinetic energy 
per nnlligram is lo^'^ ergs, about 3,500,000 foot-tons. Becquerel has 
calculated that 1 square centimeter of radio-active surface would radiate 
into space 1 gram of mattei' in one billion years. 

The positively electrified masses or ions are enormously great in 
comparison with the size of the electron. Sir Oliver Lodge illustrates 
it thus: If we imagine an ordinary sized church to be an atom of 
hydrogen, the electrons constituting it will be represented ])y about 
7oO grains of sand, each the size of an ordinary- full stop (8.50 jjositive 
and 3.50 negative), dashing in all directions inside, or, according to 
Lord Kelvin, rotating with inconceivable velocity. Put in another 
way; the sun's diameter is about 1.500,000 kilometers, and that of the 
smallest planetoid al)out li-i kilometers. Tf an atom of hydrogen be 
magnified to the size of the sun, an electron will be about two-thii'ds 
the diameter of the planetoid. 

The extreme minuteness and S|)arsenessof the electrons in the atom 
account for their penetration. While the nior(> massive ions are 
stopped by intercollisions in ])assing among atoms, so that they are

almost completely tirrested l)y tli(> thinnest sheet of matter, electrons 
will pass almost uno])structed throuo'h ordinary opaque bodies. 

The action of these emanations on phosphorescent screens is differ- 
ent. The electrons strongly affect a screen of barium platinocyanide, 
but onl}' slightly one of Sidot's zinc sulphide. On the other hand, 
the heavy, massive, nondeflectable positive ions affect the zinc-s'ilphide 
screen strongly, and the barium-piatinocyanide screen in a much less 
degree. 

Both KcHitgen rays and electrons act on a photographic plate and 
produc(^ images of metal and other substances inclosed in wood and 
leather, and thi'ow shadows of bodies on a barium-piatinocyanide 
screen. Electi'ons are much less penetrating than Rontgen rays, and 
will not, for instance, show easily the bones of the hand. A photo- 
graph of a closed case of instruments is taken by radium emanations 
in thi-ee days and by Rontgen rays in three minutes. The resemblance 
between the two pictures is slight and the dilferences great. 

The power with which radium emanations are endowed of discharg- 
ing electriiied bodies is due to the ionizatioji of the gas through which 
they pass. This can be effected' in many other w^ays; thus, ionization 
is communicated to gases faintly 1)V the splashing of water, by ffames 
and red-hot bodies, ])v ultraviolet light falling on negatively electri- 
ffed metals, and strongly l)y the passage of Rontgen rays. 

According to Sir Oliver Lodge's electronictheory of matter, a chem- 
ical atom or ion has a few extra negative electrons in addition to the 
ordinary neutral atom, and if these negative electrons are removed it 
there!)}" becomes positively charged. The free electron portion of 
the atom is. small in comparison with the main bulk, in the proportion 
in hydrogen of al)Out 1 to 7W. The negative charge consists of super- 
added or unbalanced electrons — one, two, three, etc., according to 
the chemical valenc}" of the body — whereas the main bulk of the atom 
consists of paired groups, equal 2:)Ositive and negative. As soon as 
the excess electrons are removed the rest of the atom, or ion, acts as 
a massive positively charged body hanging tightly together. In a 
high vacuum the induction spark tears the components of a rarified 
gas apart; the positively charged ions, having great comparative 
density, are soon slowed down by collisions, while the electrons are 
driven from the negative pole with an enormous velocity, depending 
on the initial electromotive force and the pressure of gas inside the 
tube, but approaching at the highest exhaustions half that of light. 

After leaving the negative pole the electrons meet with a certain 
resistance in a slight degree l)v physical collisions, but principall}^ by 
reunion with the positive ions. 

Since the discovery of radium and the identiiication of one set of its 
emanations with the cathode stream or radiant matter of the vacuum 
tube, speculation and experiment hav<» gone hand in hand, and the

two-fluid theory of electricity is gradually replaced by the orig'inal 
one-fluid theorj^ of Franklin. On the two-fluid theory the electrons 
constitute free negatiye electricity and the rest of the chemical atom 
is chai-ged positiyeh^, although a free positive electron is not known. 
It seems to me simpler to use the original one-fluid theory of Franklin, 
and to say that the electron is the atom or unit of electricity. Fleming 
uses the word "coelectrons" to express the heavy positive ion after 
separation from the negative electron, '"We can no more,'' he says, 
"have anything which can be called electricity apart from corpuscles 
than we can have momentum apart from moving matter." A so-called 
negatively charged chemical atom is one having a surplus of electrons, 
the number depending on the valency, whilst a positive ion is one hay- 
ing a deficiency of electrons. Differences of electrical charge ma}^ thus 
be likened to debits and credits in one's banking account, the electrons 
acting as current coin of the realm. On this view only the electron 
exists; it is the atom of electricity, and the words positive and negative, 
signifying excess and defect of electrons, are only used for convenience 
of old-fashioned nomenclature. 

The electron theory fits and luminously explains Ampere's idea that 
magnetism is due to a rotating current of electricity round each atom 
of iron; and following these definite views of the existence of free 
electrons has arisen the electronic theory of matter. It is recognized 
that electrons have the one property which has been regarded as 
insepara])le from matter — nay, almost impossible to separate from our 
conception of matter — I mean inertia. Now, in that remarkable 
paper of J. J. Thomson's. pu])lished in 1881, he developed the idea of 
electric inertia (self-induction) as a reality due to a moving charge. 
The electron therefore appears only as apparent mass b}- reason of its 
electro-dynamic properties, and if we consider all forms of matter to 
be merely congeries of electrons the inertia of matter w^ould be 
explained without any material basis. On this view the electron 
would be the "protyle" of 188t), whose different groupings cause 
the genesis of the elements. 

There is one more property of the emanations of radium to bring- 
before 3"Our notice. I have shown that the electrons produce phos- 
phorescence of a sensitive screen of barium platinocvanide and the 
positive ions of radium produce phosphorescence of a screen of zinc 
blende. 

If a few minute grains of radium salt fall on the zinc-sulphide screen 
the surface is immediately dotted with brilliant specks of green light. 
In a dark room, under a microscope with a |-inch objective, each 
luminous spot shows a dull center sui-rounded l)y a difl'used luminous 
halo. Outside the halo the dai'k surface of the screen scintillates with 
sparks of light. No two flashes succeed on the same spot, but arc

scattered * over the surface, coining and g'oing instantaneously, no 
movement of translation l)eing seen. 

If a solid piece of a radium salt is ])rought near the screen, and the 
surface examined with a pocket lens magnifying about 20 diameters, 
scintillating spots are sparseh^ scattered over the surface. Bringing 
the radium nearer the screen, the scintillations become more numerous 
and brighter, until when close together the flashes follow so quickly 
that tlie surface looks like a tur])ulent luminous sea. When the scin- 
tillating points are few, there is no visible residual phosphorescence 
and the successive sparks appear "atoms of intensest light," like stars 
on a ])lack sky. What to the naked eye seems like a uniform "milky 
wa}'," under the lens becomes a multitude of stellar points flashing 
over the whole surface. 

"Poloiiiiun" l)asic nitrate, actinium, and radio-active platinum pro- 
duce a similar efl'ect on the screen, but the scintillations are fewer. 
In a vacuum the scintillations are as bright as in air, and, Iwing due 
to interatomic motion, they are not afi^ected l)}- extremes of low tem- 
perature; in liquid hydrogen the}' ai'e as brilliant as at the ordinarj" 
temperature. 

A convenient way to show these scintillations is to flt the blende 
screen at the end of a brass tube with a speck of radiimi salt in front 
a))<)ut a millimeter ofl', and to have a lens at the other end. I propose 
to call this little instrunuMit the *' Spinthariscope," from the Greek 
word ffTrirfiapig^" a scintillation. 

It is ditficult to estimate the number of flashes of light per second. 
With the radium about Ave centimeters ofl' the screen the flashes are 
barely detectable, not more than one or two per second. As the dis- 
tance of the radium diminishes, the flashes become more frequent, 
imtil at one or two centimeters they are too numerous to count, 
although it is evident this is not of an order of magnitude inconceivably 
great. 

I*ractically the whole of the luminosity on the })lende screen, whether 
duetto radium or ''polonium," is occasioned by emanations which will 
not penetrate card. These are the emanations which cause the scintil- 
lations, and the reasons why they are distinct on the blende and feeble 
on the platino-cyanide screen is that with the latter the sparks are 
seen on a luminous ground of general phosphorescence which renders 
the eye less able to see the scintillations.

MODERN VIEWS ON MATTER. • 241 

It is prol)able that in these phenomena we actually witness the bom- 
l)ardmcnt of the screen Ijy the positiv e ions hurled off I)}' radium with 
a velocity of the order of that of light. Each particle is rendered 
apparent only by the enormous extent of lateral disturbance produced 
by its impact on the sensitive surface, just as individual drops of rain 
falling on a still pool are not seen as such, but b}" reason of the splash 
they make on impact, and the ripples and waves they produce in ever- 
widening circles. 

Indulging in a "scientitic use of the imagination," and pushing the 
hypothesis of the electronic constitution of matter to what I consider 
its logical limit, M'e may be, in fact, witnessing a spontaneous dissoci- 
ation of radium — and we ])egin to doubt the permanent stability of 
matter. The chemical atom may be actually suffering a katabolic 
transformation, l)ut at so slow a rate that, supposing a million atoms 
fi}^ oti' every second, it would take a centur}' for weight to diminish 
by one milligram. 

It must never be forgotten that theories are only useful so long as 
they admit of the harmonious correlation of facts into a reasonable 
system. Directh' a fact refuses to be pigeonholed and will not be 
explained on theoretic grounds, the theory must go, or it nuist be 
revised to admit the new fact. The nineteenth century saw the birth 
of new views of atoms, electricity, and ether. Our views to-day of 
the constitution of matter may appear satisfactor}' to us, but how will 
it be at the close of the twentieth century? Are we not incessantly 
learning the lesson that our researches have onh' a provisional value? 
A hundred years hence shall we acquiesce in the resolution of the 
material universe into a swarm of rushing electrons ? 

This fatal quality of atomic dissociation appears to be universal and 
operates Avhenever we brush a piece of glass with silk; it works in the 
sunshine and raindrops, and in the lightnings and flame; it prevails in 
the waterfall and the stormy sea. And although the whole range of 
human experience is all too short to afford a parallax whereby the date 
of the extinction of matter can be calcidated, protylo, the '"foi'mless 
mist," once again ma}' reign supremo, and the hour hand of eternitv 
will have completed one revolution. 



THE ATOMIC THEORY/' 



By Prof. F. W. Clarke, D. Sc. 



One hundred years ag'o, on October 21, 1803, John Dalton gave this 
society the first announcement of his famous atomic theory. Jt was 
only a slight preliminary notice, a mere note appended to a memoir 
upon another subject, and it attracted little or no attention. In ISO-i 
Dalton communicated his discovery to Dr. Thomas Thomson, who at 
once adopted it in his lectures, and in 1807 gave it still wider pub- 
licit}^ in a text-book. A year later Dalton published his New System 
of Chemical Philosoph}-, and since then the history of chemistry has 
been the history of the atomic theory. To celebrate Dalton's achieve- 
ment, to trace its influence upon chemical doctrine and discover}^ is 
the purpose of my lecture. It is an old story, and yet a new one; for 
ever}' year adds something to it, and the process of development shows 
no signs of nearing an end. A theory that grows and is continually 
fruitful can not be easily supplanted. Despite attacks and criticisms, 
Dalton's generalization still holds the field; and from it, as from a 
parent stem, spring nearly all the other accepted theories of chemistry. 

Every thought has its ancestry. Let us briefly trace the genealogy 
of the atomic theory. In the very beginnings of philosophy men 
sought to discover the nature of the material universe and to bring 
unity out of diversity. Is matter one thing or many ^ Is it continu- 
ous or discrete ? These questions occupied the human mind before 
recorded history began, and their vitality can never be exhausted. 
Final answers may be unattainable, but thought will fly beyond the 
boundaries of knowledge to bring back, now and then, truly helpful 
tidings. 

To the early Greek philosophers we must turn for our first authentic 
statements of an atomic theory. Other thinkers in older civilizations 
doubtless went before them; perhaps in Egypt or Bal)y Ionia, but of 
them we have no certain knowledge. There is a glimpse of something 
in India, but we can not say that Greece drew her inspiration thence. 
For us Leucippus was the pioneer, to be followed later by Democritus

and Epicurus. Then, in lineal succession, came the Roman, Lucretius, 
who gave to the doctrine the most complete statement of all. In the 
thouj^ht of these men the universe was made up of empt}" space in 
which swum imiumerable atoms. These were inconceivabl}^ small, 
hard particles of matter, indivisible and indestructible, of various 
shapes and sizes, and continually in motion. From their movements 
and combinations all sensible matter was derived. Except that the 
theory was purely (qualitative and nonmathematical in form it was 
curiously like th(> molecular hypothesis of modern physics, oidy with 
an absolute vacuum where an intermediary ether is now assumed. 
This notion of a vacuum was repellant to many minds; to conceive of 
a mass of matter so small that there could be none smaller was unrea- 
sonable; and hence there arose the interminable controversy between 
plenists and atomists which has continued to our own day. 

It is, however, essentially a metaphysical controversy, and sonu'. 
writers have ascribed it to a peculiar distinction between two classes 
of minds. The arithmetical thinker deals primarily with number, 
which is, in its nature, discoiitinuous, and to him a material disconti- 
nuity ort'ei-s no difliculties. The oeometer, on the other hand, has to 
do with continuous maj^'nitudes, and a limited divisibility of anything 
in space is not easy for him to conceive. But be this as it may, the 
controversy was one of words rather than of realities, and its intrica- 
cies have little interest for the scientific student of to-day. It is 
always easier to reason about tilings as we imagine they ought to be, 
than about things as the}" really are, and the latter procedure became 
practicable only after experimental science was pretty far advanced. 
The Greeks were deticient in phvsical knowledge, and, therefore, their 
speculations remained speculations only, mere intellectual gymnastics 
of no direct utility to mankind. They sought to determine the nature 
of things ])V the exercise of reason alone, whereas science, as we under- 
stand it, being less confident, seeks mainly to coordinate evidence and 
to discover the general statement which shall embrace the largest 
possible number of observed relations. The man of science may use 
the metaphysical method as a tool, but he does so with the limitations 
of definite, verifiable knowledge always in view. Intellectual stimu- 
lants may be used temperately, but they need not be discarded 
altogether. 

From the time of Lucretius until the seventeenth century of our 
era the atomistic hypothesis received little serious attention. The 
philosophy of Aristotle governed all the schools of Europe, and scho- 
lastic quibl)lings took the plai'C of I'eal investigation. All scholarship 
lay under bondagi^ to one master mind, and it was not until (ialileo 
let fall his weights from the leaning towei- of Pisa that the sp(dl of 
the Stagirite was bi-oken. Experimental science now came to tlw? fore, 
and it was seen that even Aristotelian logic must verify its premises. 



THE ATOMIC THEOKY. 2-45 

The authority of evidence began to rephu-c the iiuthority of the 
schools. 

Early in the seventeenth century the atomic philosoph}- of Epicurus 
was revived by Gassendi, who was soon followed b}^ Boyle, by New- 
ton, and by many others. One other important step was taken also. 
Boyle, in his Sceptical Chymist, gave the first scientific definition of 
an element, a conception which was more fully developed by Lavoisier 
later, but which received its complete modern form onh^ after Davy 
ha4 decomposed the alkalies and shown the true nature of chlorine. 
Without this preliminary work of Bo3de and Lavoisier, Dalton's 
theory would hardh^ have been possible. An elementar}' atom can be 
given no real detinition unless we have some notion of an element to 
begin with. But the strongest impulse came from Newton, who 
accepted atomism in clear and unmistakable terms. 

Coming before Newton, Descartes had rejected the atomic hypothe- 
sis, holding that there could be no vacuum in the universe and mak- 
ing matter essentially synonymous with extension. True, Descartes, 
in his famous theory of vortices, imagined whirling particles of 
various degrees of fineness; but they were not atoms as atoms and 
molecules are now conceived. It may be dangerous to pick out land- 
marks in history and to assert that such and such a movement began 
at such and such a time. Nevertheless, we may fairly say that the 
turning point in physical philosophy was Newton's discovery of gravi- 
tation, for that indicated mass as the fundamental property of matter. 
For an}^ given portion of matter which we can segregate and identif}^ 
extension is variable and mass is constant; when that conclusion was 
estal)lished the dominance of atomism became inevitable. Bo3"le, 
Newton, and Lavoisier were legitimate precursors of Dalton, but 
whether Boscovich should be so considered is more than dou])tful. 
His points of force were too abstract a conception to admit of direct 
application in the solution of real problems. Dalton certainl}" owed 
nothing to Boscovich, and would just as surely have developed his 
theory had the brilliant Dalmatian never written a line. 

To Boyle and Newton the atomic h3^pothesis was a question of 
natural philosoph}^ alone, for in their day chemistry as a quantita- 
tive science had hardly begun to exist. Attempts were soon made, 
however, to give it chemical application, and the first of these which 
I have been able to tind was due to Emanuel Swedenborg. This phi- 
losopher, whose reputation as a man of science has been overshadowed 
l)y his fame as a seer and theologian, pu])lished in 1721 a pamphlet 
upon chemistry, which is now more easily accessible in an English 
translation of relativel}^ recent date." It consists of chapters fiom a 
larger unpublished work, and really amounts to nothing more than a

246 THE ATOMIC THEORY. 

sort of atomic geometiy. From geometric groupings of .small, con- 
crete atoms the properties of different substances are deduced, but in 
a way which is more curious than instructive. Between the theory 
and the facts there is no obvious relation. The book was absolutely 
without influence upon chemical thought or discovery, and therefore 
it has escaped general notice. It is the prototype of a class of specu- 
lative treatises, considerable in number, some of them recent, and all 
of them futile. They represent efforts which were premature and 
for which the fundamental support of experimental knowledge was 
lacking. 

In 1775 Dr. Bryan Higgins, of London, published the prospectus 
of a course of lectures upon chemistry, in which the atomic hypothesis 
was strongly emphasized. It was still, however, only a hypothesis, 
quite as ineffectual as Swedenborg's attempt, and it led to nothing. 
Dr. Higgins recognized seven elements — earth, water, alkali, acid, air, 
phlogiston, and light — each one consisting of "atoms homogeneal," 
these being " impenetrable, inmiutable in .ffgure, inconvertible,""' and 
all "globular, or nearly so.'" He speculated upon the attractions and 
repulsions between these bodies, but he seems to have solved no prob- 
lem and to have suggested no research. William Higgins, on the 
other hand, whose work appeared in 1789. showed more insight into 
the requirements of true science and had some notions concerning 
definite and multiple proportions. His conception of atomic union to 
form molecules was fairly clear, but the distinct statement of a quan- 
titative law was just beyond his reach. In 1814, however, when Dal- 
ton's discoveries were widely known and accepted, Higgins published 
a reclamation of priority.^' In this, with much bitterness, he claims to 
have completely anticipated Dalton, a claim which no modern reader 
has been able to allow. In Robert ilngus I-^mith"s Memoir of John 
Dalton and History of the Atomic Theory,* the work of Bryan and 
William Higgins is quite thoroughly discussed, and therefore we need 
not consider the matter any more fully now. We see that atomic 
theories were receiving the attention of chemists long before Dal ton's 
time, although none of them went nuich beyond the speculative stage 
or was given serviceable form. The^- were dim foreshadowings of 
science; nothing more. 

In order that a new thought shall l)e acceptable, certain prereciuisite 
conditions nmst ])e fulfilled. If the ground is not prepared, the seed 
can not ho fruitful; if men are not ready, no harvest will be reaped. 
Only when the time is ripe, only when long lines of evidence have 
begun to converge, can a new theory connnand attention. Dalton's

opportunity cauie at the riolit niomont, and lie knew how to use it well. 
Elements had ])een defined; the constancy of matter was established; 
pneumatic chemistry was well developed, and great numbers of quan- 
titative analyses awaited interpretation. The foundations were ready 
for the master builder, and Dalton was the man. His theor}' could at 
once be tested by the accunmlated data, and when that had been done 
it was found to be worthy of acceptance. 

It is not my purpose to discuss in detail the processes of Dalton's 
mind. The story is told in his own notebooks, which have been given 
to the public by Roscoe and Harden,'^' and it has been sufficiently dis- 
cussed b}^ others. We now know that Dalton was thoroughly imbued 
with the corpuscular ideas of Newton and that, When studying the dif- 
fusion of gases, he was led to the belief that the atoms of different 
suV)stances must be different in size. Upon applying this hypothesis 
to chemical problems he discovered that these differences were in one 
sense measurable and that to every element a single, definite, com- 
bining number, the relative weight of its atom, could be assigned. 

From this, the law of definite proportions logically followed, for 
fractions of atoms were inadmissible; and the law of multiple propor- 
tions, which Dalton worked out experimentally, completed the gen- 
(M'alization. The conception that all comi)ination nuist take place in 
lixed proportions was not new, and, indeed, despite the objections of 
Herthollet, was generally assumed; ])ut the atomic theory gave a rea- 
son for the laAV and made it intelligible. The idea of multiple propor- 
tions had also occurred, although incompletely, to others; ))ut the 
determination of atomic weights was altogether original and novel. 
The new atomic theory, which figured chemical union, as a juxtaposi- 
tion of atoms, coordinated all of these relations and gave to chemistrj^ 
for the first time an absolutelv general ([uantitative basis. The tables 
of Richter and Fischer, who preceded Dalton, dealt only with special 
cases of combination, l)ut they established regularities which rendered 
easier the acceptance of the new and l)roader teachings. The earlier 
atomic speculations were all purely qualitative and incapable of exact 
application to specific problems; Dalton created a working tool of 
extraordinary power and usefulness. Between the atom of Lucretius 
and the Daltonian atom the kinship is very remote. 

Dalton was not a learned man, in the sense of mere erudition, but 
perhaps his limitations did him no harm. Too much learning is some- 
times in the way, and clogs the flight of that imagination ])y which the 
greatest discoveries are made. The man who could not see the forest 
])ecause of the trees was a good tj'pe of that scholarship which never 
rises above petty details. It maj" compile encyclopa'dias, but it can

248 THE ATOMIC THEOET. 

not generalize. In some ways, doubtless, Dalton was narrow, and he 
failed to recognize the improvements which other men soon intro- 
duced into his system. The chemical symbols which he proposed were 
soon supplanted b}^ the better formuhe invented by Berzelius, and his 
views upon the densities of gases were set aside by the more exact 
work of Gay Lussac, which Dalton never full}^ appreciated. As an 
experimenter he was crude and excelled by several of his contempo- 
raries; his tables of atoniic weights, or rather equivalents, were only 
rough approximations to the true values. These defects, however, 
are only spots upon the sun and in no wise diminish his glory. Dal- 
ton transformed an art into science, and his influence upon chemistr}^ 
was never greater than it is to-day. The truth of this statement will 
appear when we trace, step by step, the development of chemical doc- 
trine. The guiding clue, from first to last, is Dalton's atomic theor}-. 

Although Dalton tirst announced his theory in 1803, the publication 
of his "systenr' in 1808 marks the culmination of his labors. The 
memorable controvers}' between Proust and Berthollet had by this 
time exhausted its force, and nearly all chemists were satislied that 
the law of definite or constant proportions must be true. The idea of 
multiple proportions was also easily accepted; and as for the combin- 
ing numbers, they, after various revisions, came generall}" into use. 
The atomic conception, however, made its way more slowi}^, for the 
fear of metaphysics still governed many acute minds. Dav}' especially 
was late in yielding to it, but in time even his conversion was efl:'ected. 
Thomson, as we have already noted, was the earliest and most enthu- 
siastic disciple of the new system, and WoUaston, although cautiously 
preferring the term "equivalent" to that of atomic weight, made 
useful contributions to the theory. These names mark the childhood 
of the doctrine before its vigorous growth had thoroughly begun. 

The development of the atomic theory- followed two distinct lines, 
the one chemical, the other physical, in dii-ection. On the chemical 
side the leader was Berzelius, who began in 1811 the publication of his 
colossal res;'arches upon definite proportions. At first he seems to 
have been influenced b}^ Richter rather than by Dalton, but that bias 
was only temporarj^ For more than thirty years Berzelius continued 
these labors, inventing symbols, establishing formuhe, and determining 
atomic weights. He, above all other men, made the atomic theory 
applical)le to general use, a universal tool suited to practical purposes. 
Turner, Penny, Erdmann, and others did noble work of the same 
order, but Berzelius overshadowed them all. Throughout his long 
career he was almost the dictator of chemistry. 

It was on the physical side, however, that the theory of Dalton was 
most profoundly modified. First came the researches of Gay Lussac, 
who, in 1808, showed that combination between gases always took 
place in simple relations by volume, and also that all gaseous densities 
were pro})ortional either to the com])ining weights of the several sub- 



THE ATOMIC THEOEY. 249 

stiinces, or to rational luultiplcs thereof. In 1811 Avogadro general- 
ized the new evidence and broug'ht forward the great law which is 
now known by his name. Equal volumes of gases, under like condi- 
tions of temperature and pressure, contain equal numbers of molecules. 
Mass and volume were thus covered by one simple expression, and 
both were connected with the weights of the fundamental atoms. 
Avogadro, moreover, distinguished clearly between atoms and mole- 
cules, a distinction which is of profound importance to chemistry, 
although it is not always properly appreciated by students of physics. 
The molecule of to-day, which is usualh^ but not always, a cluster of 
atoms, is identical with the atom of the pre-Daltonian philosophers; 
while the chemical unit represents a new order of divisibility which 
the ancients could never have imagined. A molecule of water was 
easily conceived 1)}^ them, but its decomposition into smaller and 
simpler particles of oxygen and hydrogen, the chemical atoms, was far 
beyond the range of their knowledge. That the distinction is not 
alwavs borne in mind by physicists is illustrated I)}- the fact that in 
Clerk Maxwell's article "Atom," in the Encyclopa3dia Britannica, 
Dalton is not even mentioned, and the phenomena there selected for 
discussion are molecular only. 

Maxwell was surely not ignorant of the dili'erence between atoms 
and molecules, but his knowledge had not reached the point of com- 
plete realization. His thought was of molecules, and so Maxwell 
unconsciously neglected the real subject of his chapter — the atom. Of 
late 3"ears man}^ essays upon the atomic theory have ])een written 
from the physical side, and few of them have been free from this par- 
ticular ambiguity. At first a similar error was committed by chem- 
ists, who paid small attention to Avogadro's law, and so the latter 
failed to exert unich influence upon chemical thought until more than 
forty years after its promulgation. The relation discovered by Dulong 
and Petit in 1819, that the specific heat of a metal was inversel}^ pro- 
portional to its atomic weight, was more speedily accepted; but even 
this law did not receive its full application until many j^ears later. 
To ai)plv either of these laws to chemical theory involved a clearer 
discrimination between atomic weights and equivalents than was pos- 
sibk> at the beginning. A long period of doubt and controversy was 
to work itself out before the full force of the physical evidence could 
be appreciated. Mltscherlich's researches upon isomorphism were 
more fortunate, and gave imniediate help in the determination of 
atomic weights and the settlement of formula?. For the moment we 
need only note tiiat the chemical atom was the underlying conception 
by means of which all these lines of testimony were to be unified. 

From Dalton and (lay-Lussac to Frankland and Cannizzaro was a 
time of fermentation, discussion, and discovery. In chemistr}-, con- 
trarj' to the sajangof the preacher, ther(> were many new things under 
the sun, and some of the discoveries were most suggestive. First, it

was found that certain groups of atoms could l)e transferred from com- 
pound to compound, almost as if they were veritable elements; and 
radicles, such as ammonium, cyanogen, and benzoyl, were generally 
recognized. I say "groups of atoms" advisedly, for as such they were 
regarded, and they could hardly have been interpreted otherwise. 
Then came the discovery of isomerism; of the fact that two substances 
could be strikingly different, and yet composed of the same elements 
in exactly the same proportions. This was onl}' explicable upon the 
supposition that the atoms were differently arranged within the iso- 
meric molecules, and it led investigators more and more to the stud}^ 
of chemical or molecular structure. Without the atomic theory the 
phenomena would have been hopelessly bewildering; with its aid the}'^ 
were easy to understand and fertile in suggestions for research. Still 
another link in the chain of chemical reasoning was forged b}^ Dumas 
when he proved that the hydrogen of organic compounds was pften 
replaceable, atom for atom, b}" chlorine. Sometimes the replacement 
was complete, sometimes it was only partial, and the latter cases were 
the most signiffcant. In acetic acid, for example, one, two, or three 
fourths of the hydrogen could l)e successivel^y replaced, but the last 
fourth was permanently retained. Hj'^drogen, then, was com])ined in 
acetic acid in two different ways, one part yielding its place to chlo- 
rine, the other ])eing unaffected. This behavior was soon found to l)e 
by no means exceptional; indeed, it was very common, and it opened 
a new line of attack upon the problems of chemical constitution. The 
existence of radicles, the formation of isomers, and the substitution 
of one element by another were facts which strengthened the atomic 
theory and seemed to be incapable of reasonable interpretation upon 
other terms. Their connection with one another, however, was not 
well understood, and wearisome discussions preceded their coordina- 
tion under one general law. 

With the tedious controversies which distracted chemists between 
1830 and ]850 we have nothing now to do; they were important in 
their day, but they do not come within the scope of the present argu- 
ment. Theor}^ after theory was advanced, prospered for a time, and 
then deca3"ed, and chemical literature is crowded with their fossil 
remains. Each one, doubtless, indicated an advance in knowledge; 
but each one also exaggerated the importance of some special set of 
relations and so overshot the mark. During this period, however, 
Farada}" discovered the law of electrolysis which is now known by hi.'^ 
name, and the chemical equivalents were thereby given another exten • 
sion of meaning. The electro-chemical theories of Berzelius had fallen 
to the ground, l)ut Faradaj^'s law came as a permanent addition to the 
physical side of chemistr3\ 

During the sixth decade of the nineteenth century two importtmt 
forward steps were taken. The kinetic theory of gases gave new force

to Avogadrc/s law, and made its complete recog-nition b}^ t-hemists 
necessary. Atoms, molecules, equivalents, and atomic weights needed 
to be more sharply detined, and in this work many chemists shared. 
Berzelius had proposed a system of atomic weights whicli ditfered, 
except in the yalue taken for its base, l)ut little from the one now in 
use. This was abandoned for a table deyised by Gmelin, in which the 
laws of Ayogadro and of Dulong and Petit were almost if not entirely 
ignored. Laurent and Gerhardt attempted to reform the system, but 
it was left for Cannizzaro, in 1858, to succeed. By doul)ling some of 
the currently accepted atomic weights order was introduced into the 
preyailing chaos, and the chemical constants were ])rought into har- 
mony with the ph3'sical laws. The modern atomic weights and our 
present chemical notation may be dated from this time, eyen though 
the preliminary anticipations of them were neither few" nor incon- 
spicuous. 

The second great step forward was accomplished through the labors 
of several men. Frankland and Kekule were foremost among them, 
but Couper, Odling, Williamson, Wurtz, and Hofmann all contributed 
their share to the upbuilding of a new chemistry" of which the doctrine 
of valency was the corner stone, A new property of the chemical 
atom was brought to light, and structural or rational formula^ became 
possible. Each atom was shown to have a lixed capacit}^ for union 
with other atoms, a capacity which could be given numerical expression, 
and from this discovery important consequences followed. An atom 
of h3'drogen unites with one other atom onh^; the atom of oxygen 
may combine with two; that of nitrogt^n with three or five; while 
carl)on has capacity for four. All unions of atoms to atoms within a 
molecule ai-e governed by conditions of this order, and the limitations 
thus imposed determine the possibilities of combination in a given 
class of compounds. In organic chemistry the conception of valency 
has been most fruitful, and it has shown the prophetic power which 
is characteristic of all good theories. It explains radicles and isomers; 
it predicts whole classes of compounds in advance of their actual dis- 
covery; and it has guided economic investigations from which great 
industries have sprung. The former partial theories regarding chem- 
ical constitution fell into their proper places under the ucav generali- 
zation, for that was broad enough to comprehend them all. All con- 
stitutional (chemistry depends upon this property of the atoms, and 
any other adequate foundation for it would be difticult to tind. 

I have said that the discovery of valency explained the phenomena 
of isomerism. Indeed, it enabled chemists to foresee the existence of 
new isomers and it established the conditions under which such com- 
pounds could exist. And yet, in one direction at least, its power was 
limited and substances were found which the theory could not interpret. 
Tartaric acid, for example, exists in two moditications, ditiering in 



252 THE ATOMIC THEOKY. 

cr3^stalline form and in their action upon i)<)larize(l lioht. One acid 
was dextrorotatory, the other la?vorotatory, while a mixture of the 
two in equal proportions was neutral to the polarized l)eam, and gave 
no rotation at all. Their crj^stals exhibited a similar difference in the 
arrangement of certain planes, one set being right-handed, the other 
left-handed; and each cr^^stal resembled its isomer like a retiection in 
a mirror, alike, but reversed. For a long time tliis physical isomerism, 
as it was called, remained inexplicable, for the rules of valency gave 
to both molecules the same structure and offered no hint as to the 
cause of the difference. Structural formuhe, however, said nothing of 
the arrangement of the atoms in tridimensional space and it Avas soon 
suspected that the root of the difficulty was here. The mere linking 
of the atoms with one another could be represented in a single plane, 
but that was obviously an imperfect symbolism. 

- In 187-t van't Hott' and Le Bel, working independently of each other, 
suggested a solution of the problem. One simple assumption was 
enough; merel}^ that the quadrivalent carbon atom was essentially a 
tetrahedron or, more precisely, that its four units of chemical attrac- 
tion were exerted from a common center in the direction of four tetra- 
hedral angles. Atoms of that kind could he built up into structures in 
which right-handedness and left-handedness of arrangement appeared, 
provided onl}' that each one was united with four other atoms or 
groups ail different in nature. Stereochemistry was born, the anom- 
alies vanished, and many new substances showing optical and crystal- 
line properties analogous to those of tartaric acid were soon prepared. 
The theory of van't Hoff' and Le Bel was fertile, and therefore it was 
justified; it interpreted another set of phenomena, but in order to do 
so something like atomic form had tirst to be assumed. It was only a 
new extension of Dalton's atomic theory, but it has suggested a future 
dev(dopment of extraordinary signiticance. If we can determine, not 
mereiy the linking of the atoms, but also their arrangement in space, 
we should be able, sooner or later, to establish a connection between 
chemical composition and crystalline form. The architecture of the 
molecule and the architecture of the crystal must surely in some way 
be related. But the pro])lem is exceedingh^ complex, and we may have 
to wait many 3'ears before we I'each its solution. The atomic theory 
still has room to grow. 

Let us now turn back in time and consider another phase of our 
subject. In 1815 Prout suggested that the atomic weights of all the 
elements were even multiples of that of hydrogen. It was only a 
speculation on the part of Prout, and yet it led to iniportant conse- 
quences, for it opened a discussion upon the nature of the chemical 
elements, and it pointed to hydrogen as the primal matter of the uni- 
verse. Prout's hypothesis, tlun'efore, l)ecanie a subject of controversy. 
It foinid many supporters and also many antagonists; l)ut, fortunately, 



THE ATOMIC THEOEY. 253 

one aspect of it wa.s capable of experimental investigation. Some of 
the most exact and elaborate determinations of atomic weight have 
been made with the direct purpose of testing the truth or falsit}^ of 
Front's speculation, and science thereby has been notably enriched. 
The marvelous researches of Stas, for instance, had this specitic object 
in view. The verdict was finally unfavorable to Prout. At least, the 
best measurements fail to support his idea; but it still has advocates 
who believe that the experimental data are vitiated by unknown 
errors, and that future investigations will reverse the decision. In 
science there is no court of last appeal. 

Front's hypothesis, then, stimulated the determination of atomic 
weights, and so helped us to a more accurate knowledge of them. It 
also led to a search for other relations between these constants, and 
thus paved the way for important discoveries. Dobereiner, Kremers, 
Dumas, Pettenkofer, Cooke, and many other chemists published 
memoirs upon this theme, but not one of them was general or con- 
clusive." Groups of elements were compared and relations w^ere 
brought to light, but an exhaustive study of the question was hardly 
possible until after Cannizzaro had revised the atomic weights and 
indicated their proper values. 

In 1865 Newlands presented before the London Chemical Society a 
communication upon the law of octaves, in which lie showed that the 
elements, when arranged in the order of their atomic weights, exhibited 
a certain regular recurrence of properties. Unfortunateh% his views 
were not given serious attention, and even met with ridicule, })ut they 
contained the germ of the great truth. It was reserved for the Rus- 
sian, Mendek'etf, four years later, to- completel}' formulate the famous 
periodic law. 

Mendeleefi' arranged the elements in tabular form, still following 
the order of their atomic weights. A periodic variation of their 
properties, including the property of valency, at once became evident; 
and although the scheme was, and still is, open to some criticism, 
its importance could hardly l)e denied. In the table certain gaps 
appeared, presumably belonging to unknown elements, and for three 
of these some remarkable predictions were made. The hypothetical 
elements were described by Mendeleeff, their atomic weights were 
assigned, and their physical properties foretold, and in due time the 
prophecies were verified. The three metals — gallium, scandium, and 
germanium — have since been discovered, and they corr(^spond very 
closely with Mendeleeff's anticipations. His general conclusion was 
that all of the physical properties of the chemical elements are periodic 
functions of their atomic weights, and this conclusion, I think, is no

ment of the IVriodic Law, published at P^aston, Pa., in 1896. 



254 THE ATOMIC THEORY. 

longer seriously doubted. The curves of atomic volumes aud melting 
points which Lothar Meyer afterwards constructed give strong sup- 
port to this view. 

The periodic system, then, gives to the uum])ers discovered ])v Dalton 
a much more profound significance than he ever imagined, and is 
destined to connect a great mass of physical data in one general law. 
That law we now see, "as in a glass, darkly;" its complete mathemat- 
ical expression is yet to be found, ])ut I believe that it will ])e fully 
developed within the near future. We may have a spiral curve to deal 
with, as in the schemes proposed by Stoney or bj^ Crookes, or else a 
vibratory expression like that suggested by Emerson Rey^nolds in his 
presidential address before the Chemical Society last year; but in 
some form the periodicity of the elements must be recognized, and 
one set of relations will connect them all. 

In the arrangement proposed b}" Reynolds the inert gases, the 
elements of zero valency, appear jit the nodes of a vibrating curve — a 
circumstance which gives this method of presentation a peculiar force; 
but for the consideration of physical properties the curves drawn by 
Lothar Mey^er seem likely to be the most useful. In one respect, 
however, the periodic system is still defective — it fails to take ade- 
quately into account the numerical relations between the atomic 
weights, a phase of the problem which should not be ignored. Such 
relations exist; some of them have been indicated by your distinguished 
fellow-member. Doctor Wilde; and, elusive as they^ may^ seem to be, 
thev are surely not meaningless. The final law must cover the entire 
ground, and then atomic weights, ph^-sical properties, and valency 
will be completeh' correlated. Prout\s hypothesis is discredited, and 
yet it may prove to be a crude ilrst approximation to some deeper 
truth, as the probability calculations of Mallet" and of Strutf' would 
seem to indicate. The approaches of the atomic weights to whole 
numbers are too close and too frequent to be regarded as purely acci- 
dental. But this is aside from our main question. The real point to 
note is that the physical properties of the elements are all interde- 
pendent, and that the fundamental constants are the atomic masses. 

Do I seem to exaggerate? Then look for a moment at the present 
condition of pln^sical chemistry, and see how moderate my statements 
really are. We have not only the laws already mentioned, of Avo- 
gadro, of Dulong and Petit, of Faraday and of Mendeleetl', but also a 
multitude of relations connecting the ph3\sical constants of bodies with 
their chemical character. Even the wave lengths of the spectral lines 
are related to the atomic weights of the several elements, as has been 
shown by the researches of Runge and his colleagues, of Ruramel,'^^

and of Marshall Watts. ^ If we try to study the specitic gravity of 
solids or liquids, the only clows to regularity are furnished by the 
atomic ratios. Atomic and molecular yolumes give us the onl}^ 
approximations to anything like order. Similarly, we speak of atomic 
and molecular refraction, of molecular rotation for polarized light, of 
molecular conductivity, and the like. In Trouton's law the latent heat 
of vaporization of an}' liquid becomes a function of the molecular 
weight. And, iinally, all therniochemical measurements are meaning- 
less until they have been stated in terms of gram molecular weights; 
then system begins to appear. Chaos rules until the atomic or molec- 
ular weight is taken into account; with that considered, the reign of 
order begins. 

Even to the study of solutions the same conditions apply. Sub- 
stances in solution exert pressure, and in this respect they closely 
resemble gases. Van't Hot! has siiown that equal yolumes of solu- 
tions, having under like conditions equal osmotic pressures, contain 
equal numl)ers of molecules, and thus Avogadro's gas law is curiously 
paralleled. The two laws are even equivalent in their anomalies. The 
abnormal density of a gas is explained by its dissociation, and the 
variations from van't Hotl's law are explicable in the same way. The 
theory of ionic or electrolytic dissociation, proposed, by Arrhenius, 
shows that certain substances, when dissolved, are split up into their 
ions, and through this conception the analogy between gases and 
solutions is made absolutely complete. The ions, however, are atoms 
or groups of atoms, and just as Avogadro's law is applied to the deter- 
mination of molecular weights among gases, so van't Hoft's rules enable 
us to measure the molecular weights of substances in solution. The 
atom, the molecule, and the molecular weight enter into all of these 
new generalizations. In short, if we take the atomic theory out of 
chemistry we shall have little left ])ut a dust heap of unrelated facts. 

1 have now indicated briefly, and in outline only, the influence of the 
atomic theory upon the development of chemical thought. Details 
have been purposely omitted; the salient facts are enough for my pur- 
pose, and they make, at least for chemists, an exceedingly strong case. 
The convergence of the testimony is remarkable, and when we add to 
the chemical evidence that which is oflfered l)y physics, the theory 
becomes overwhelmingly strong. This side of the question I can not 
attempt to discuss, but I may in passing just refer to Professor 
Riicker's presidential address ])efore the British Association in 1901, 
which covers the gi-ound admirably. The atomic theory has had no 
better vindication. 

And 3'et from time to time we are told that the theory has outlived 
its usefulness, and that it is now a hindrance rather than a help to

256 THE ATOMIC THEORY. 

science. Some of the objector.s are quite dogmatic in their utterances; 
some only seek to evade the theory without going- to the extreme of 
an absolute denial, and still others, more timid, assume an apologetic 
tone, as if the atom were something like a poor relation — to be recog- 
nized and tolei-atod, Ijut not to l)e encouraged too far. Now, caution 
is a good thing if it is not allowed to degenerate into indecision; when 
that happens mental obscurit^y is the result. In science we must have 
intellectual resting places; something to serve as a foundation for our 
thinking; something concrete and tangible in form. No theory is 
immune against hypercriticism; none is absolute and final. With these 
considerations borne in mind we may ask whether a doctrine is serv- 
iceable or not and we can use it without fear. When we say that 
matter, as we know it, behaves as if it were made up of very small, 
discrete particles we do not lose ourselves in metaphysics, and we have 
a detinite conception which can be applied to the correlation of evi- 
dence and the solution of problems. Objections count for nothing 
against it until something better is offered in its stead — a condition 
which the critics of the atomic theor}^ have so far failed to fultill. 
They give us no real sul)stitute for it, no other working tool, and so 
their o])jections, which are too often m(>taphysical in character, com- 
mand little serious attention. Criticism is useful just so far as it helps 
to clarity our thinking; when it ])econies a mere agent of destruction 
it loses force. 

Broadly speaking, then, the modern critics of the atomic theory 
have shaken it Init little. Still, some serious attempts have been made 
toward forming an alternative system of chemistry, or at least a system 
in which the atom shall not avowedl}^ appear. The most sei'ious and 
perhaps the most elaborate of these devices was that brought forward 
in 1866 by Sir Benjamin Brodie" in his Calculus of Chemical Opera- 
tions, which he defended later (1880) in a little book entitled Ideal 
Chemistry. In this curious investigation Brodie tries to avoid 
hypotheses and to represent chemical acts as operations upon the unit 
of space l)y which weights are generated. This notion is a little difficult 
to grasp, but Brodie's procedure was perfectly legitimate. His one 
fundamental assumption is that hydrogen is so generated by a single 
operation, and upon this he erects a system of symbols which, treated 
mathematically, lead to some remarkable conclusions. For instance, 
chlorine, bromine, iodine, nitrogen, and phosphorus become com- 
pounds of hydrogen with as many unknown or "ideal" elements, 
which no actual analysis has yet identified. That is, the known phe- 
nomena of chemistry seem to be less simply interpreted by Brodie's 
calculus than in our commonly accepted theories, and certain classes 
of phenomena ai-e not considered at all. It is true that Brodie never 
completed his work, but it is not easy to see how his notation and

THE ATOMIC THEOEY. 257 

reasoning could have accounted for isomerism, much less for the facts 
which stereochemistry seeks to explain. 

Just here we tind the prime difficult}^ of all attempts to evade the 
atomic theory. Up to a certain point we can easily dispense with it, 
for we can start with the fact that every element has a definite com- 
bining- mimber, and then, without an}' assumptions as to the ultimate 
meaning of these constants we can show that other constants are 
intimately connected with them. So far we can ignore the origin of 
the so-called atomic weight; but the moment we encounter the facts 
of isomerism or chemical structure, and of the partial substitution of 
one element by another, our troul)les begin. The atomic theory con- 
nects all of these data together and gives the mind a simple reason 
for the relations which are observed. We can not be satisfied with 
mere equations; our thought will seek for that which lies behind 
them; and so the antitheorist fails to accomplish his purpose because 
he leaves the human mind out of account. The reasoning instrument 
has its own laws and requirements, and they, as well as the empirical 
observations of science, must l)e satisfied. Even in astronomv the law 
of gravitation is not enough; men are continualh' striving to ascertain 
its cause, and no number of failures can prevent them from trying 
again and yet again to penetrate into the heart of the mystery. In 
the atomic theory the same tendencj^ is at work, and the ver}- nature 
of the atom itself, that thing which we can neither see nor handle, has 
become a legitimate subject for our questionings. Shall we, having 
gone so far, assume that we can go no farther? 

"All roads lead to Rome." If we accept the atomic theory, we 
sooner, or later tind ourselves speculating about the realit}' of the 
atom, and at last we come face to face with the old, old problem of 
the unity or diversity of matter. We can, if we choose, employ the 
theory as a working tool only and shut our ears to these profounder 
questions, but it is not eas}^ to do so. What is the chemical atom? 
Is all matter ultimately one substance? We ma3M3e unable to solve 
either pi'ol)lem, and yet we can examine the evidence and see which 
way it points. 

I think that all philosophical chemists are now of the belief that the 
elements are not absolutely distinct and separate entities. In favor 
of their elementary nature we have only negative evidence, the mere 
fact that with our present resources we are unable to decompose them 
into simpler forms. On that side of the argument there is nothing 
more. On the other hand, we see that the elements are bound together 
by the most intimate relations, so much so that unknown elements can 
be accurately described in advance of their discoverv, and facts like 
these call for an explanation. Something belonging to the elements 
in connnon seems to underlie them all. If, however, we study the 
atomic weights, we are forced to observe that the elements do not

shade into one another continiiousl}', but that they vary by leaps 
which are .sometimes rehitivel}' large, and sometimes quite small. To 
Mendeleeti" this irregular discontinuity is an argument against the unity 
of matter, or rather an indication that the periodic law lends no sup- 
port to the belief; but such a conclusion is unnecessary. If the funda- 
mental matter, the '■'protyle,''as Crookes has called it, is itself discon- 
tinuous and atomic in structure, the same property must be shown in 
all of its aggregations, and so the difficulties seen by Mendeleeff dis- 
appear. The chemical atoms become clusters of smaller particles, 
whose relative magnitudes are as yet unknown. 

That bodies smaller than atoms really exist is the conclusion reached 
by J. ,7. Thomson" from his researches upon the ionization of gases. 
According to him, this phenomenon "consists in the detachment from 
the atom of a negative ion," this being "the same for all gases." He 
regards "the atom as containing a large mimber of smaller bodies," 
which he calls "corpuscles," and these are equal to one another. "In 
the normal atom this assemblage of corpuscles forms a system which 
is electrically neutral.'' It nuist be borne in mind that these conclu- 
sions are drawn by Thomson from the study of one class of phenomena, 
and it is of course possil)le that they may not be tinally sustained. 
Their value to us at the present moment lies in their suggestiveness 
and in the curious way in which they reenforce other arguments of 
similar purport. The possibility that the chemical atoms can ])e 
actually broken down into smaller particles of one and the same kind 
is, to say the least, startling, but it can not be disregarded. The evi- 
dence obtained by Thomson is, so far as it goes, positive, and it is 
entitled to receive due weight in all discussions of our present problem. 
It is the tirst direct testimony that we have been able to obtain, all 
previous evidence being either negative or circumstantial. It may be 
misinterpi-eted, but it is not to be pushed aside. 

In direct line with the inferences of Thomson are the results obtained 
by Rutherford and Soddy in their researches upon radio-activity. 
Here, again, we have a subject so new that all opinions concerning it 
must be held open to revision, but, so far as we have yet gone, the 
evidence seems to point in one way. Ruthei'foi-d and Soddy* have 
studied especially the emanations given off by thorium, and conclude 
that from this element a new body is continually generated in which 
the radio-activity steadily decays. This loss of emanative power is in 
some sort of equilibrium with the rate of its formation. When tho» 
rium is "de-emanated," it slowly regains its emanative power. The 
emanation is a "chemically inert gas, analogous in nature to the mem- 
bers of the argon family." The tinal conclusion is that radio-activity 
may be "considered as a manifestation of subatomic chemical change."

THE ATOMIC THEORY. 259 

This word ".subatomic" is one of ominous import. It implies atomic 
complexity, and it also suogests something more. The property of 
radio-activity is most strikingly exhibited b}' the metals radium, tho- 
rium, and uranium; and these have the highest atomic weights of any 
elements known. If the elements are complex, these are the most 
complex, and therefore, presumably, the most unstable. Are they in 
the act of breaking down? Is there a degradation of matter compar- 
able with the dissipation of energy ? We can ask these questions, l)ut 
we may have to wait long for a reply. There is, however, another 
side to the shield, and the universe gives us glimpses of a generative 
process, an elementary evolution. 

The truth or falsity of the nebular h3^pothesis is still an open ques- 
tion. It is a plausible hypothesis, however, and commands many 
strong arguments in its favor. We can see the nebuhe and prove 
them to be clouds, of incandescent gas; we can trace a progressive 
development of suns and systems, and at the end of the series we have 
the hal)itable planet upon which we dwell. The nebular hypothesis 
accounts for the observed condition of things, and is therefore by 
most men regarded as satisfactory. But this is not all of the story. 
Chendcally sj^eaking, the nebuh>3 are exceedingly simple in composition; 
the whiter and hotter stars are a little more complex; then come stars 
like our sun, and finally the finished planets, with their many chemical 
elements and their myriads of compounds. Here again we have evi- 
dence bearing upon our prol)lem, evidence which led me," more than 
thirty years ago, to suggest that the evolution of planets from nebulse 
had been accompanied by an evolution of the elements themselves. 
This thought, stated in a reversed form, has since been developed and 
amplified by Lockyer, and it is doubtless familiar to you all. In the 
development of the heavenly bodies we seem to see the growth of the 
elements; do we, in the phenomena of radio-activity, witness their 
decay ? This is a startling, possibly a rash, speculation, but it rests 
upon evidence which must be considered and weighed. 

We have, then, various lines of convergent testimony, and there are 
more which I might have cited, all pointing to the conclusion that the 
chemical atoms are complex, and that elemental matter, in the last 
analj'sis, is not of many kinds. That there is but one fundamental 
substance is not proved; and 3'et the probability in favor of such an 
assumption must be conceded. Assuming it to be true, what, then, is 
the nature of the Daltonian atom? 

To the chemist the simplest answer to this question is that fur- 
nished by the researches of J. J. Thomson, to which reference has 
already been made. A cluster of smaller particles or corpuscles satis- 
fies the conditions that chemistry imposes on the problem, their ulti- 
mate nature being left out of account. For chemical purposes we

need not inquire whether the corpuscles are divisible or indivisible, 
althougli for otliei" lines of investigation this question may be perti- 
nent. But, no matter how far we may push our analysis, we must 
always see that something still lies beyond us and realize that nature 
has no assig-nable boundaries. That which philosophers call "the 
absolute" or "the unconditioned" is forever out of our reach. 

Through many theories men have sought to g-et back a little farther. 
Among these Lord Kelvin's theory of vortex atoms is perhaps the 
most conspicuous and certainly the best known. It presupposes an 
ideal perfect fluid, continuous, homogeneous, and incompressible; 
portions of this in rotation form the vortex ring's, which, when once 
set in motion by some creative power, move on indestructil)ly forever. 
These rings may be single or linked or knotted together, and they 
arc the material atoms. The assumed permanence of the atom is thus 
accounted for and given at least a mathematical validity, ])ut we have 
alread\" seen that the chemical units may not 1)c ((uite so simple. The 
idtimate corpuscles, to use J. J. Thomson's words, ma}' be vortex 
rings; the chemical atom is much more complex. On this theory 
chemical union lias been explained by supposing that vortices are 
assembled in rotation a])out one another, forming groups which are 
permanent under certain conditions and j^et are capable of being 
l)roken down. The vortex ring is eternal; its groupings are transi- 
tory. This is a plausible and fascinating theory; if only we can 
imagine the ideal perfect fluid and apply to it the laws of motion; 
that done, all else follows. Unfortunatel}', however, the fundamental 
conception is difficult to grasp and still more difficult to apply. So 
far it has done little or nothing for chemistry; it has brought forth 
no discoveries nor stimulated chemical research; we can only say that 
it does not seem to be imcompatible with what we think we know. In 
a certain way it unifles the two opposing conceptions of atomism and 
plenism, and this may be, after all, its chief merit. 

But there are later theories than that of Kelvin, and some of them 
are most daring. For instance, Professor Larmor regards electricity 
as atomic in its nature, and supposes that there are two kinds of 
atoms — positive and negative electrons. These electrons are regarded 
as centers of strain in the ether, and matter is thought to consist of 
clusters of electrons in orbital motion round one another. Still more 
recentl}" Prof. Osborne Reynolds, in his Rede lecture," has oft'ered us 
an even more startling solution of our problem. He replaces the con- 
ventional ether by a granular medium, generally homogeneous, closely 
packed, and having a density ten thousand times that of water. Here 
and there the medium is strained, producing what Reynolds calls 
"singular surfaces of misflt" between the normally piled grains and

their partial!}^ displaced neigh])ors. These surfaces arc wavc-Uke in 
character and constitute what we recognize as ordinary' matter. 
Where they exist there is a local deticiency of mass, so that matter is 
less dense than its surroundings; and this, as Heynolds has said, 
is a complete inversion of the ideas which we now hold. Matter is 
measured by the absence of the mass which is needed to complete a 
normal piling of the grains in the medium. In other words, it might 
be defined as the defect of the universe. The ''singular surfaces" 
already mentioned are molecules, which may cohere, but can not pass 
through one another, and they preserve their individuality. 

Possibly I may misapprehend this theory, for it has been published 
in a most concise form, and the reasoning" upon which it rests is not 
g'iven in detail. I can not criticise it, l)ut 1 may offer some sugg-es- 
tions. If matter consists of weaves in a universal medium, how does 
chemical union take place '. Shall we conceive of hydrogen as repre- 
sented by one set of waves and nitrogen as represented b}^ another, 
the two differing onh^ in amplitude!' If so, when they combine to 
form annnonia there should be either a superposition of one set upon 
the other, or else a complex system might be found showing interfer- 
ence phenomena. But would not the latter supposition imply a 
destruction of matter as matter is defined by the theory^ Could one 
such wave coalesce with or neutralize another '\ To conceive of a union 
of waves without interference is not eas}^, but the facts of chemical 
combination must be taken into account. When we remember that 
compoiuids exist containing- hundreds of atoms within the molecule, we 
begin to realize the difficulties which a complete theory of matter must 
overcome. Chemical and physical evidence must be taken together; 
neither can solve the problem alone. At present the simplest concep- 
tion for the mind to grasp is that of an aggregation of particles. 
Beyond this all is contusion, and mathematical devices can help us 
only a little. In speaking thus I assign no limit to the revelations of 
the future; some theor}', now before the world, ma}" prove its right 
to existence and survive; l)ut none such, as yet, can be taken as defi- 
nitel}' established. The theory which stands the test of time will not 
be a figment of the imagination; it nmst be an expression of o))served 
realties. But enough of speculation; let me, before I close, say a few 
words of a more practical cliaracter. 

Dalton's statue stands in Manchester, a fitting tribute to his fame. 
But it is something which is finished; something on which no more 
can be done; something to be seen onh' by the few. As a local 
memorial it serves a worthy purpose, l)ut Dalton's true monument is 
in the set of constants which he discovered, and which are in daily 
use by all chemists throughout the world. Here is something that is 
not finished; and h(M-e Dalton's memory can be still further honored, 
by good work, good research, honest efforts to increase our knowledge. 



262 THE ATOMIC THEOKY. 

We have seen that the atouiic weights are the fimdaiiieiital eonstants 
of all exact chemistry, and that they are almost as important also to 
physics; l)ut the mathematical law which must connect them is still 
unknown. Every discovery along the line of Dalton's theory is 
another stone added to his monument, and many such discoveries are 
yet to be made. 

What, now, is needed? First, every atomic Aveight should be 
determined with the utmost accuracy, and what Stas did for a few 
elements ought to be done for all. This work has more than theo- 
retical signiticance; its practical bearings are many, but it can not be 
done to the best advantage along esta])lished lines. So far the investi- 
gators haA'e been a mob of individuals; they need to be organized into 
an army. 

Collective work, cooperative research, is now denianded, and the 
men who have hitherto toiled separately should learn to pull together. 
Ten men, working on a common plan, in touch with one another, can 
accomplish more in a given tiuic than a hundred solitaries. The prin- 
ciples at issue are well understood; the methods of research are well 
established; ])ut the organizing power has not yet appeared. Shall 
this be a great institution for research. a])le to take up the problems 
which are too large for individuals to handle, or a voluntary cooper- 
ation between men who are unselfishly inclined to attempt the work? 
This question I can not answer; doubtless it will solve itself in time; 
but I am sure that a method of collective investigation will be found 
sooner or Liter, and that then the advance of exact knowledge will be 
more rapid than ever before. When the atomic weights are all accu- 
rately known, the problem of the nature of the elements will be near 
its solution. Some of the wealth which chemistry has created might 
well be expended for this purpose. Who will establish a Dalton labo- 
ratory for research, and so give the work which he started a permanent 
home ?

Sectk )N 1.-7 \r)'j><>sc of ill IX j>(ij)er. 

J 11 l!>0^ we published a paper on the dissoeiatiou of matter, in which 
were detailed the results of certain experiments. Continuing the 
investigations on this sul)ject, pursued for some years past, we resumed 
our experiments, and these ha>e tinally shown that the phenomenon 
of radio-activity, that is to say, the dissociation of atoms, at tirst 
supposed to lie peculiar to certain exceptional l^odies, such as uranium 
and radium, is, on the contrary, a general property of matter, and 
consequentl}' one of the most widely diffused phenomena of nature. 

The aptitude of bodies to become disaggregated, emitting effluvia 
analogous to the cathodic rays, and, like them, capable of traversing 
material substances and generating X rays, is universal. Light 
impinging upon any substance whatever, the ]»urning of a lamp, 
chemical reactions of very diverse characters, an electric discharge, 
etc., may cause these effluvia. The bodies designated as radio-active 
substances, such as radium, only show in a higher degree a phenome- 
non which all matter possesses in some degree. 

Section 2. — Phe7i<nnena ohst'vrcd duniKj the dissociation of matter'. 

The radio-activity of matter, its dissociation, is always manifested 
by the emission into space of effluvia having a velocity comparable to 
that of light and possessing qualities analogous to those of cathodic 
rays, notably the qualit}^ of producing X rays as soon as they encoun- 
ter an obstacle. 

Numerous experiments have detinitely shown the source of the vari- 
ous radio-active emissions. Whether they come from the cathode of 
g, (Brookes tube, from the radiation of a metal under the action of 
light, or fi'om the radiation of bodies spontaneousl}' radio-active, such 
as uranium, thorium, etc., these elfluvia are of the same nature. The}' 

undergo the same magnetic deflection; the relation of their charge 

^ ^ lit *= 

to their mass is the same. Their N'clocity alone varies, but is always 
very great.

264 INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 

The cathodic ra^^s are charged with electricity, yet can traverse thin 
metallic plates connected with the earth without losing their charge. 
Whenever they impinge upon an olistacle they immediately give rise 
to those peculiar radiations called X rays, which differ from the 
cathodic rays in that they are not detlected by a magnet and traverse 
thick metallic plates capable of averting those rays, 

Cathodic rays and X ravs produce electricity upon all ))odies, 
whether gaseous or solid, which they^ meet. They consequently ren- 
der the air a conductor of electricity. 

By measuring the deflection of the cathodic rays by an electric field 
and by a magnetic field, wo may estimate the velocity of the particles 

composing them, and the relation — of their charge e to their mass m. 

The velocity found oijuals a third of that of light. If ;// expresses 

the electric charge in c()uh)mt)s, we o))tain !(/ for the relation— .'^ 

In electrolysis the relation for hydrogen is ]<»', one thousand times 
smaller. The charge e being the same, the mass of the cathodic par- 
ticle would be one one-thousandth that of the atom of hydrogen, the 
smallest of known atoms. The ordinary atom would then be disso- 
ciated into 1,000 parts to form the cathodic particle. 

In place of a Crookes tube let us now use a substance spontaneously 
ver}^ radio-active — thorium or radium, for example. We again find 
most of the preceding phenomena with simple quantitative variations. 
For example, we find more raj^s charged with negative electricity in 
the Crookes tu})es than in the radium emanations which are specially 
charged with positive electricity; but the nature of the phenomena 
observed in the two cases appears to be identical. 

Radio-active bodies emit three diflerent kinds of radiation, which 
may be designated }y\ the letters o', /?, and y. 

The a radiations are but slightly penetrating, are charged with 
positiA'e electricity, and form the greatest part of the emitted rays. It 
is under their influence that the air becomes a conductor of electricity. 
Thev appear to be formed by the projection of particles about the 
size of a hydrogen atom — that is to sa}', one thousand times greater 
than the particles of the fS radiations; their velocity is about one-tenth 
that of light. They can not be deflected except by a very powerful 
magnet. 

The fi radiations are similar in all respects to the cathodic rays of a 
Crookes tube. Like them they are charged with negative electricity, 

^'This relation varies according to different observers between 1.55 by 10'' and 1.84 
by 10' (in electro-magnetic iniits). If we adopt the latter figure we see that it rep- 
resents the enormous charge of 184 millions of coulombs per gramme of cathodic 
matter. In electrolysis tlie charge of a gramme f)f hydrogen aiuounts to only 96,000 
coulombs. 



INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 265 

and may also be deflected by a niaonet, but in the opposite direction 
from that taken by the a radiations. They are the ones that produce 
the photographic effects. They must be very piMietrating." Their 
velocity, according- to Kaufmann, must be nearly that of light. 

The y radiations are not deflected b}^ a magnetic field and are proba- 
bly similar to X raj's and, like them, very penetrating. Their 
velocity, according to Blondlot, must be exactly that of light; that is 
to say, 300,000 kilometers per second. 

Besides these various kinds of radiations which have, as wc shall 
see in a future paragraph, none of the properties of jnatter, radio- 
active bodies emit, in an infinitely small quantit}^, an emanation hav- 
ing the character of a gas, which can be condensed by means of liquid 
air at a temperature of —150"^ and is made up, according to Ramsay, of 
helium. It gives to bodies with which it comes in contact a tempo- 
rary radio-activity. The product of the condensation, whose proper- 
ties are shown by the action of the electrometer, is invisible and 
imponderable, but it can be dissolved in certain acids, and on e\apo- 
rating the solution the radio-activity is obtained, unchanged, in the 
residue. 

The effluvia of radio-active bodies have very active physiological 
properties that have already l)een studied by many observers. Con- 
centrated radium, even when incased l)y a metallic envelope, l)urns 
the skin. It paralyzes bacteria. 

Induced radio-activity, discovered by Rutherford, is that phe- 
nomenon l)y virtue of which radio-active bodies, especially in solution, 
communicate for some time their radio-activity to surrounding bodies, 
either insulating or conducting. It seems quite evident that in this 
case we are dealing with material substances, since induced radio- 
activity is not effected through glass and mica, and may be carried to 
a distance from radio-active bodies. On blow^ing the disengaged par- 
ticles through a coiled tube and projecting them upon any body what- 
ever, the latter soon acquires a temporary radio-activity. 

It is by induced radio-activity that is produced the phosphorescence 
of sulphide of zinc inclosed in a glass receiver communicating by a 
large tube with another receiver containing a solution of radium. Bis- 
muth plunged for some daj^s in a solution of nitrate of radium finallj'-, 
for the same reason, becomes phosphorescent. All radio-active bodies 
are more active in solution than in a solid state, but then they lose their 
phosphorescence and can only induce it b\" their emanations. 



«In this, as Rutherford says, tliey do not resemble the cathodic rays, since the 
latter, as Lenard has slinwn, will lianlly traverse metallic layers no thicker than 
one one-hundredth of a millinictci-. It is probable, rather, that the penetration of 
metals is due tu the X rays that always accompany these radiations or that are at 
least always entienderefl 1)v thcni. 



266 INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 

It seems pro)ml)le that tlie property possessed by radio-active ema- 
nations of condensing- tiie vapor of water is due to material particles 
carried along- by their radiating- force, especially if we consider these 
particles as electriti(Kl. This is a property common to all dusts, as can 
be easily shown by the following- well-known experiment: A glass 
receiver containing water in -a state of ebulliti(^n communicates, by glass 
tubes, with two other receivers, one filled Avith ordinary air taken from 
the room, the other with air deprived of its dust by simple filtration 
through cotton wool. The water A^apor entering the receiA^er contain- 
ing- the dust-lad(Mi air immediately condenses into a thick fog, Avhile 
that entering the other receiA'er remains transparent.

A\ lien radio-active bodies Avere discovered physicists did not take the 
pains to m(>asure the amoiuit of energA^ liberated during- their disso- 
ciation, l»ut vainh' sought and still continue to seek some external 
source from AVhich these bodies might derive that energ-y. It is, in 
fact, considered as an absolutely fundamental principle that matter 
can only giA'c l)ack in some form or other energ-y it has previously 
received. 

NoAA% since all pliA'sicists are to-day unanimous in afhrming- that the 
products (A all kinds of radio-activit}' are similar; and since, on the 
other hand, the energy necessary for the emitting into space effluvia 
haA'ing- the velocity that the radio-active particles possess is inmiensely 
superior to that Ave are al)le to produce by the A^arious forces at our 
disposal, is it not evident that it is not outside of matter but Avithin 
matter itself that Ave nmst seek for the source of the energy expended? 
This liberated energy is the consequence of intra-atomic reactions 
which Ave shall shorth' consider and which differ essentially from the 
extra-atomic reactions that come under the domain of cht^mistry, cA^en 
if in no other Ava}', ])y the enormous magnitude of the effects produced. 

If this is so — and it is not possible to conceive that it should be 
otherAvise — we are imniediatel}' led to look upon the atoms that make 
up matter as immense reservoirs of energ-}'. The}' ma}' manifest this 
energ-y without borrowing from without, since it exists within them- 
selves where it Avas accumulated at the time of their formation. 

What are the fundamental characteristics of this hitherto ignored 
energy which Ave may call simply intra-atomic energy? 

It differs from all others with which Ave are acquainted l)y its pro- 
digious poAver. If, instead of dissociating- only a few niillionths of a 
milligi'ain of matter, as Ave do noAv, we could succeed in dissociating 
some kilograms, Ave Avould have, as Ave shall show, a source of energy 
compared Avith Avhich all the motors coml>ined now di'iven by coal 
Avould present an insigniticiuit total. It is because of the amount of 



INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 267 

this energy tbat the radio-active phenomena .show sucli intensity. It 
is this which causes the emission of particles endowed with an immense 
velocity, phosphorescence and the production of an enormous <[uantity 
of electricity, out of proportion to that which we can maintain upon 
insulated bodies. 

The o-reat velocity of the particles discharoed into space under the 
influence of the energy lil)erated in the atom would be of itself a proof 
that we are in the presence of an entirelj' new force. It is only in 
vil)rations of the ether that a velocity comparable to this has hitherto 
been observed, and there we readily explain it b}' the almost perfect 
elasticity of the medium. No analogous explanation can ])e invoked 
for the projections of the particles. 

X rays also are one of the indirect manifestations of intra-atomic 
energy, a new stage of its manifestation. 

A form of energy ma}" be declared new when it is dift'erentiated ))y 
its fundamental characters from all those previously known. 

We do not yet know all the possible transformations of this new 
mode of energy, but we are alread}' convinced as to its origin. We 
know that it comes from matter, since we can not produce it without 
matter. We know also that when it is once formed it is no longer 
matter, since it has lost all material characters, and that it can not 
again become matter by any process. 

Before an assemblage of facts as conclusive and clear as these, it 
seems impossible to admit an}" hypothesis other than this: Here is an 
entirely new mode of energy having no relation to any of those hitherto 
observed. 

The origin of intra-atomic energy is not entirely inexplicable if we 
admit, with astronomers, that the condensation of a nebula sufficed, b}" 
itself alone, to produce the considerable temperature possessed by the 
sun. It may be conceived that an analogous condensation of the ether 
may have generated the energies contained in the atom. We may 
roughly compare the latter to a sphere in which a n()idi(}uetial)lc gas 
was compressed by some billions of atmospheres at the time of the 
origin of the world.

GREAT AMOUNT OF INTRA-ATOMIC ENEKOV. 

The great energy manifested in radio-active phenomena has pro- 
foundly impressed physicists, and for a long time past they have been 
seeking its origin. One of them recently observed that the complete 
dissociation of a gram of radium would produce sufficient energy to 
transport the entire P^nglish flei^t to the summit of ]\Iont Blanc. 



268 INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 

Let U8 ti\y to state with some exactitude the amount of force con- 
densed in a small quantity of any matter whatever. The various 
methods employed for measuring the velocity of the radio-active par- 
ticles have always oiven about the same results. This velocity is 
nearly tliat of light for certain radio-active emissions and aliout one- 
third of that for the particles in a Crookes tube. Let us take the 
lowest of these velocities — a))out 1<»0,000 kilometers per second — and 
try, })y taking- this for a l^ase, to calculate the energy that would be 
required to completely dissociate one gram of any matter whatever. 

The work performed by a ])ody in motion being equal to half the 
product of its mass with the square of its velocity, an elementary cal- 
culation gives at once the power which would be manifested by the 
particles of this gram of matter in case they were endowed with 
the supposed velocity. It would be equal to about 6,80(),(H)0 horse- 
power. This amount of energy would suffice to move, on a levef road, 
a freight train having a length of a little more than four and one-fourth 
times the circumference of the globe. 

To move such a train l)y means of coal would require 2,830,000 
kilograms, which, at 24 francs a ton, would cost about 68,000 francs. 

These figures, so vast as at tii-st to seem impro])ab]e, depend upon 
the enormous velocity by which the particles are impelled, a velocit}' 
which we can not approach l)y any known mechanical means. In the 
factor vt\"' the mass of 1 gram is certainly very small; but as its 
velocity is immense, the effects produced must likewise be iumiense. 

Now, all the velocities which we can produce are almost as nothing 
compai"(^d with those of the particles of dissociated matter. We can 
scarcel}" exceed 1 kilometer per second by the means at our disposal, 
while the velocity of the radio-active particles is 100,000 times greater. 
Hence the tremendous effects produced. 

Kutherford has said that the energ}' manifested in radio-active phe- 
nomena is "perhaps a million times greater than that produced l)y 
the various known reactions of molecular forces." 

He also remarks — and he is, as far as 1 know, the first ph3"sicist wdio 
has decided to make such a statement — that "since the radio-active 
elements do not differ from the other chemical elements b}^ any of 
their chemical characters, there is no reason to think that the enormous 
reserve of energy the}" possess is peculiar to them alone. It seems 
pro])a])le, then, that atomic energy is general and of equal force in all 
1 todies.'' " This is the thesis that I have constantly defended and upon 
which I have for a long time based my contention concerning the 
existence of a new form of energy surpassing in force all we have 
hitherto known. 

Shall we some day succeed in easil}^ liberating this colossal force 
that lies within the atoms? No one can tell. Neither could one have

told ill the time of Galvaiii that the enerj*'}' whicii wa.s used with diffi- 
culty to twitch the lei^s of a frog and attract small fi'agments of paper 
would one day set in motion enormous railway trains. 

Perhaps it will always l)e beyond our powers to completely dissoci- 
ate the atom, because the difficulty would probably increase as disso- 
ciation advances, yet to dissociate a very small part would suffice. 

If, as physicists still claim, matter, instead of being- an inunense 
reservoir of energy, can only restore the energy comnmnicated to it 
by some means or other — heat, for example — it is evident that in order 
to produce the dissociation of matter there would be necessary' an 
expenditure of work exactly equal to that which the results of the 
dissociation would perform, conformably to one of the fundamental 
principles of thermo-dynamics. 

It can not, however, be longer held that the energy exhibited by 
the dissociated atom comes from without; it must be borrowed from 
the enormous reserve that it possesses. Besides, even if it were 
merelv an agent in the transformation of energy, the importance of 
dissociation would still remain, since we can produce it by agents that 
are to-day absolutel}' free to all and unutilized, such as light." 

MATTER CONSIDERED AS AN ENORMOUS CONDENSATION OF ENERGY. 

The indisputable fact that the atom is a reservoir of energy leads 
immediately, in m}'^ opinion, to the hjqDothesis that matter is com- 
posed onl}^ of condensed energy of a special mode, whence result its 
weight, its form, and its fixity. It is to energy thus considered that 
we give the name of matter. 

Some ancient facts, quite anterior to the discovery of the cathodic 
rays, already pointed to this idea. Take, for example, the quantity 
of electricity extracted from bodies bj' electrolysis. A gram of a 
substance such as hydrogen contains a charge of 96,000 coulombs. 
The electricity must be there in a state of very considerable condensa- 
tion, since b}^ no means at our disposal can we make an insulated body 
of the size we have mentioned hold more than a very small fraction of 
this charge. -Foubert has observed that the quantity of electricity con- 
tained in a cubic centimeter of h3'drogen would suffice to charge a 
sphere as large as the earth with a potential of 6,000 volts. 

In my opinion electricity is only one of the manifestations of spe- 
cial energy contained in the atoms. It is the state of prodigious con- 
densation of this energy that permits the generation of the enormous 

«In a recent work (On ether and gravitational matter through infinite space) Lord 
Kelvin expresses himself as follows: "The mechanical value of a cubic kilometer of 
solar light is equal to 412 kilogram meters, equivalent to the work of a horsepower 
for five and one-half seconds. This result may give some idea of the actual total of 
the mechanical energy of the luminoun vil)rations and of the forces contained in our 
atmosphere." 



270 INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 

quantity of electricit}' that the atom can pi-oduce. only a part of 
which, very proba])ly, appeals in ordinary electrolysis. This is not 
an hj^pothesis, since, in the radio-acti\ity manifested by sim])le bodies, 
the quantity of electricit}" liberated for a given weight of matter is 
considerably larger than in electrolysis. 

In all the ordinary operations to which we submit matter — fusion, 
vaporization, etc., and in all chemical operations — we communicate to 
it an additional amount of energ}', which apparently augments the 
movements of rotation or vi])ration of the atoms, ]>ut we do not touch 
their structure, and that is wh}^ matter so easily resumes its primitive 
state, as we see it do, for example, when we allow a liquefied body to 
cool.

derahle. 

Current idem as to the dht'inctlon het'a-'een, tJie pondei'ahle and the im- 
p&nderable. — Science formerly classitied the various phenomena of 
nature ])y placing them in clearly separated groups, between which 
there appeared to })e no connection. These distinctions existed in all 
branches of knowledge. 

The discovery of the laws of evolution occasioned the disappearance 
from the natural sciences of the divisions that had previously seemed 
insuperable barriers, and from the protoplasm of primitive creatures 
up to man the chain is to-day almost uninterrupted. Missing links 
are restored every day, and we now see how changes have been 
effected in the course of time from the most simple to the most com- 
plex beings. 

Physics has followed a similar road, but all the chasms that separate 
its different branches have not yet been spanned. It has slowly got 
rid of the fluids that formerly embarrassed it. It has discovered the 
relations between the different forces and now admits that they all are 
but varied manifestations of something indestructible— energy. Thus 
it has established the serial permanence of phenomena, has shown the 
existence of continuit}^ where only discontinuity formerly appeared. 
The law of the conservation of energy is in reality only a simple state- 
ment of this continuity. In order to establish continuity throughout, 
physics has still an enormous step to take. It still maintains that 
there is a deep gulf between the ponderable and the imponderable; 
that energy and matter are sharply separated, matter and ether no 
less so. 

In the present state of scientific thought two ideas are current that 
should be considered apart; first, matter can not itself create energy; 
second, the imponderable ether is entirely distinct from ponderable 
matter — that is to say, it has no analogy with it. 



INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 27 1 

The foundations on which these ideas were established seemed to be 
so solid that they would defy the inroads of time. We shall, how- 
ever, endeavor to show that new facts tend to successful!}' undermine 
them. 

ThetransfonnatioH of matter lntocneT(iy. — A material S3\stem isolated 
from all external action can not spontaneously generate energy. If we 
suppose it to be endowed with an internal energy, chemical or other- 
wise, its (piantity of energy will remain invarial)leas long* as the system 
is subject onl}^ to internal action. This is one of the great principles 
of thermo-dynamics. 

All past scientific observations seemed to entirely confirm this idea, 
that no substance can produce energy Avithout having- first borrowed 
it from without. All thermo-ehemistry is based on the principle that 
"the heat disengaged or absorl)ed in the decomposition of a body is 
exactly equal, and contrary in sign to that which it has been necessary 
to employ for its transformation." 

To cause the disappearance of this sharp separation we have just 
noted it is necessary to succeed in transforming matter into energy 
without furnishing anything from without. Now it is just this spon- 
taneous transformation that is shown us by all the experiments I 
have cited on the radio-activity of matter. The spontaneous produc- 
tion of energy thus shown, so at variance with current scientific ideas, 
has much embarrassed physicists, who have tried in vain to discover, 
outside of the matter afitected, the origin of the energy manifested by 
it. We have seen that the explanation becomes very simple as soon 
as we consent to admit, in accordance with the clearest evidence, that 
matter contains a reserve of energy which it can partially lose, either 
spontaneously or under slight exciting influences. It may doubtless 
be said that it is not really matter that is transformed into energy, but 
merely an intra-atomic energy that is given out. Yet, as this energy 
of intra-atomic origin can not be generated without the final disappear- 
ance of matter, we are justified in saying that this is just what would 
happen if matter were transformed into energy. To state this more 
fully it would first be necessary to understand the intimate nature of 
matter and energy, which no one thus far has been a))le to do. 

Tlie tTanait'ton hdireen the jjorxJerahh' (md the iiitpo)i<lei'ahle — Propet^-

now reached the second of the propositions above enunciated as one of 
the great scientific dogmas of the present day. namely, that the ponder- 
able and the imponderable, that is to say, matter and ether, are abso- 
lutel}' distinct, and that there is no connection between them. 

In order to prove that this is not the case, we nnist show that the 
effluvia generated by all bodies during their dissociation consist of a 
substance having characters intermediate between those of ether and 
those of matter. 



272 INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 

Durino- iiuiny years physicists luive held that the particles emitted 
in the phenomena of radio-activity were merely fragments of atoms, 
doubtless charued with electricit}', but nevertheless always formed of 
matter. 

This opinion might seem to be contirmed by the fact that radio- 
active emissions are often accompanied l)y a projection of material 
particles. In a Crookes tul)e the emission of solid particles from the 
cathode is so considerable that they metallize plates exposed to their 
projection. 

Similar deportation of matter is likewise observed in most elective 
phenomena, notably when electricity having a sufficiently high poten- 
tial passes })etween two electrodes. The spectrum of the electric sparks 
then formed always shows the lines characteristic of the metals of 
which the electrodes are formed. After repeated dischai'ges ])etween 
a l)all of gold and one of silver, we find silver on the gold ])all and gold 
on the silver one. With currents of high frequency Monsieur Oudin 
showed that electrodes of amalgamated gold, used in air having the 
ordinary pressure, lose nearly one-tenth of a milligram of their 
weight per hour. In these various cases matter is doubtless carried 
away by the velocity of the electric molecules, as is the sand of the 
sea })y the violence of the waves. 

Still another reason seemed to clearly prove the materialitj* of the 
cathodic emissions. They can be deflected ])y the magnetic field; 
besides, they are charged with electricity, and as electricity had not 
been known to l^e transported without material support it was neces- 
sary to pr(^suppose the existence of such a support: It is true that, 
in the theory of electrons, it is admitted that the electric atom in 
motion, wholl}^ free from all matter, behaves exactly like a current 
and can be deflected by a magnet; l)ut some 3^ears ago that theory, 
unsupported by the discovery since made by Zeemann, had not the 
considerable extension it has to-day. 

The kind of matter-dust supposed to form the emissions from the 
cathode and from radio-active bodies showed very singular charac- 
teristics for a material substance. According to the experiments of 
J. J. Thomson, the products of this emission were identical, no matter 
what might be the body dissociated. The electric charge and the 
mass being always the same, it was necessary to admit that in different 
bodies identical elements were found. 

These supposed material elements had likewise lost all the properties 
of the matter that gave them birth. Lenard showed this clearly when 
he sought to verify one of the ancient hypotheses, according to which 
the effluvia generated by ultra-violet light impinging upon metals are 
composed of dust torn from the surface of metals. Taking a body — 
sodium — easily dissociated ])}" light, and which can also be detected in 
intiuitesimal quantities in air by means of the spectroscope, he found 



INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 273 

that the products of dissociation .showed no trace of sodium. If, 
then, the effluvia of radio-active bodies are matter, such matter pos- 
sesses none of the properties of that from which it was derived. 

Max A]>i'aham and Kaufman n proved that the dissociated atoms of 
radio-active phenomena are transformed into something- extremely dif- 
ferent from matter, and which the}" consider to be composed exchisivel}' 
of atoms of electricity; that is to say, of what one to-day calls electrons, 
bodies without weight, which differ essentiall}^ from ordinary matter, 
having no character in common with it except a certain amount of 
inertia. 

Inertia is, as is well known, the resistance, whose cause is unknown, 
that bodies oppose to movement or change of movement. It can be 
measured and its measure is defined by the term "mass." Mass,' 
then, is the measure of the inertia of matter, its coefficient of resist- 
ance to movement. It has an invariable value for every material bod}', 
one which remains invarial)le throughout all the transformations to 
which that body may be sul)jected. Constancy of mass is, as I inen- 
tioned above, one of the fundamental principles of mechani(%s and of 
chemistry. 

Now, this property possessed by the material atom is also possessed 
by the electric atom to a certain degree. For some years it has been 
admitted that electricity is endowed with inertia. It is, indeed, by 
means of this property that we explain the phenomena of induction 
and of oscillating discharges. We are ignorant whether that inertia 
has the same unit of measure as the inertia of matter. Some physi- 
cists suppose, without, indeed, being able to offer any proof, that the 
inertia of matter is due to the electrons and is entirely of electro- 
magnetic origin. 

It does not seem, however, that we can identify the inertia of mat- 
ter with that of the electric atom whose mass is, in reality, only an 
apparent mass, resulting simply from its state of an electrified body 
in movement. The electric corpuscle seems to have a longitudinal 
mass (measured l)y opposition to acceleration in the direction of 
motion) different from its transversal mass (perpendicular to the direc- 
tion of motion). It is clear that the properties of an electi-ic atom 
differ considerably from those of a material atom. 

What, then, is the constitution of these h3'pothetical electric atoms 
emitted by all ])odies during radio-activity^ 

The answer to that cpiestion will fui'nish us with exactly the link 
between the pondtu'able and th(» ini])oiiderable, for which we are 
searching. 

It is evidently impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to 
define an electric atom, but we can at least characterize it thus: A 
substance that is neither a solid, a liquid, nor a gas, that has no 
weight, that traverses obstacles without difficulty, and that has no 



274 INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 

property in common with matter, except a certain inertia, and, what 
i.s more, an inertia \ar3'ing' with the velocity, that is more like ether 
than matter and forms a transition between them. 

The formation of effluvia is an incontestable testimony to the trans- 
formation of the ponderable into the imponderal)le. 

This transformation, so contrary to all the precepts laid down by 
science, is nevertheless one of the most frequent phenomena in natui'e. 
It is dail}" effected under our eyes, l)ut as we formerly possessed no 
reagent for testing it it w^as unoi^served. 

Section 6. — The current conception as to atoms. 

Orir/h) of current ideas concerning the structure of atoms. — Those 
scientists who follow in foreign journals the experiments and discus- 
sions of the most eminent physicists of the present day, such as Lord 
Kelvin, J. J. Thomson, Crookes, Larmor, Lorentz, and many others, 
have before them a curious spectacle. They see melting away before 
them, da}" ]>y day, fundamental scientific conceptions that seemed estab- 
lished solidly enough to remain forever. 

Being unal)le to give, in detail, the steps of this evolution, I will 
confine myself to stating summarily the researches of which the present 
theories seem the necessary consequence. 

Five fundamental discoveries were the origin of the transformation 
of ideas concerning matter and electricity. These were, first, facts 
revealed by the study of electrolytic dissociation; second, the discov- 
ery of the cathodic rays; third, that of the X-rays; fourth, that of the 
so-called radio-active bodies, such as uranium and* radium; fifth, the 
demonstration that radio-activity is not a peculiar property of certain 
bodies, but is a general property of matter. 

The oldest of these discoveries, since, indeed, it goes V)ack to Davy — 
that is to say, to the commencement of the last century — is that of the 
dissociation of chemical compounds by an electrical current. Its study 
was completed later by various ph3\sicists, notably l)y Faraday, and, 
in our time, by Arrhenius. It led on toward the theory of atomic 
electricity and the preponderating influence which electric atoms or 
electrons have in chemical reactions and the properties of ])odies. 

It seemed formerly that electric dissociation could only be obtained 
from compound l)odies, never witli simple ones. Yet, as soon as the 
cathodic rays and radio-activity Avere discovered, the theory of electric 
dissociation seemed to explain them very well on the simple condition 
of admitting that the atoms of a simple body contain, like those of a 
compound body, electric atoms having contrary signs and susceptible, 
like them, of separation. 

The second of these discoveries, that of the cathodic raj's, suggested 
the idea that there might be a state of matter different from any 
hitherto known; but this idea remained without infiueuce up to the 



INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 275 

day when Rontgeu, exainhiing' more closely the Crookes tubes which 
physicists had been using- for more than twenty years without seeing 
anj'thing- new in them, discovered that they gave out peculiar rays, 
absolutely different from any then known, to which he gave the name 
of X-rays, By this discovery a quite unforeseen thing, entirely new, 
since it found no analogy of any kind in known phenomena, was placed 
before the world of science. 

The discovery of the radio-activity of uranium followed closely upon 
that of the X-rays, and had the consequences which 1 have already 
stated. It led especiallv to the admission that the atoms of certain 
bodies, supposed at first to be exceptional in character, possess the 
extraordinary property of dissociating themselves, but, as I showed 
that this property l)elongs to all bodies, it was necessarv to recognize 
that there exists in matter a special and universal propert}' totally 
unknown hitherto, and from which it results that the structure of 
the atom is necessarily ver}^ different from that which had for a long 
time been supposed. 

Premnt ideas as to the structure of atoms. — The first origin of our 
present ideas concerning the structure of atoms was a consequence of 
Faraday's discoveries in electroh^sis. He proved that the molecules 
of compound bodies carr}" a charge of neutral electricity, definite and 
constant in amount, which becomes dissociated into positive ions and 
negative ions when solutions of metallic salts are traversed })y an 
electric current. The atom was soon considered as composed of two 
elements, a material particle and an electric charge which was believed 
to be combined with it or sui)erposed upon it. 

In this phase of the evolution of ideas the positive electron and the 
negative electron are merel}' two substances to bo added to the list of 
elementary bodies with which the}- are capable of combining. The 
idea of the material atom still persists. 

In the present evolution there is a tendency to go much further. 
After asking themselves whether this material support of the electron 
was realh' necessar}^ man}' physicists have reached the conclusion that 
it is not. They reject it entirelv and consider the atom as wholly con- 
stituted of an aggregate of electrical corpuscles without any material 
suppoi't. The structure of matter would then be exclusively electrical. 

This is evidently a considerable step, and by no means all plu^si- 
cists have yet taken it. Classical ideas pi-epossess our minds too 
completely to be easily got rid of; but. judging from the general ten- 
dency at the present time, it would seem quite possible that this idea 
may itself l)ecome classical in its turn. 

As soon as the mat(MMal atom is generally considered as a simple 
aggregation of (dectrie corpuscdes we are very (puckly led to admit 
that it is only a condensjition of (MUM'gy. 



276 INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 

According- to the purtisaii.s of the exclusiveh' electric structure of 
matter, the atom is entirely made up of a certain number of electric 
vortices. Around a small num))er of positive electrons there whirl, 
with dizz}^ velocit3% the negative electrons to the number of a thou- 
sand, and often more. 

Taken together the}' form an atom, which is thus a sort of solar S3"s- 
tem in miniature. "The material atom," says Larmor, "is composed 
of electrons, and of nothing else." 

These electrons, hy neutralizing each other, render the atom elec- 
tricalh' neutral. The lattiu- ]>ec()mes positive or negative only when 
it is deprived of electrons of corresponding contrary signs, as is done 
in electrolysis. All chemical reactions are due to losses or gains in 
electrons. 

It will ))e seen that the old atom of the chemists, formerly considered 
so simple, is really remai'kabiy complex. It is a veritable siderial 
system, comprising a sun and planets that gravitate about it. From 
the architecture of this system are derived the properties of the var- 
ious atoms, but all have the same fundamental elements. 

Section 7. — Ether tlte fnudnnimtdl xuhsfuncc of (ifomx. 

The greater part of the phenomena studied ])y ph^'sics — light, heat, 
radiant electricit}', etc. — are considered as produced b}' vibrations of 
the ether. Gravitation, from which we derive a knowledge of celestial 
mechanics and the course of the stars, seems to l)e still another of its 
manifestations. The theoretical speculations on the constitution of 
atoms seem also to demand the ether for a basis. 

The necessity for the ether has long been realized, because no phe- 
nomenon would l)e conceiva))le without the existence of this medium. 
Without it there would probably lie neither weight, nor light, iTor 
electricity, nor. heat — in a word, nothing of that with which we are 
accpiainted. The universe would be silent and dead, or would manifest 
itself in a form utterly inconceivable. If we could construct a cham- 
ber of glass from which the ether was entirely removed, neither heat 
nor light could traverse it. It would be absolutely ])lack, and probabl}' 
graA'itation would cease to act upon bodies placed within it. Thej'^ 
would then lose all their weight. 

Yet, as soon as we attempt to detine the properties of the ether, 
enormous difficulties appear. They arise, especially, from the fact 
that, being unable to connect it with anvthing known, terms of com- 
parison. and consequently of definition, fail entirely. 

When the books on physics say, in a few lines, that the ether is an 
imponderable medium that tills the universe, the first idea that comes 
into the mind represents it as a kind of gas sufficiently rarefied to be 
imponderal)le by the means at ourdisposal. It is not difficult to imag- 
ine such a gas, A. Miiller has calculated that if we should difi'use 



INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 27T 

the matter of the sun "and the phmets that surround It throughout a 
space equal to that which separates us from the nearest fixed stars, a 
cubic myriameter of such matter thus diffused into a gaseous state 
would scarceh" weigh the millionth of a milligram, and would con- 
sequently be imponderable in our balances. A gas of such tenuity, 
representing perhaps the primitive state of our nebula, would be 
a quadrillion times less dense than the vacuum carried to the mil- 
lionth of an atmosphere in a Crookes tube. 

Unhappily the constitution of the ether can not be compared in any 
way with that of a gas. Gases are' very compressible, while ether can 
not be notably compressed. If it were, it could not transmit almost 
instantaneously the vibrations of light. 

It is only in fluids theoretically perfect, or, better yet, in solids, that 
we can find distant analogies with the ether; but we nmst then imagine 
a substance having very singular ])roperties. It must have a rigidity 
surpassing that of steel, for if it did not possess that it would not 
transmit luminous vibrations at a speed of 300,000 kilometers per 
second. The most illustrious of our modern ph3^sicists, Lord Kelvin, 
considers ether as "an elastic solid filling all space." 

The elastic solid that forms the ether has very strange properties for 
a solid, properties which we find in no other. Its extreme rigidity 
must be associated with an extraordinarily low density — that is to say, 
so low that its friction is una])le to retard the motion of the stars in 
space. Hein has calculated that if the density of the ether were only 
a million times less than that of the air of a Crookes tul^e it would 
produce a secular alteration of half a second in the average motion of 
the moon. Such a medium, in spite of its greath' reduced density, 
would soon remove the atmosphere from the earth. It has been cal- 
culated that if it had the properties that we attribute to a gas it would 
acquire by its impact with the surface of planets deprived of atmos- 
phere, like the moon, a temperature of 38,000'^. Finally we reach 
the idea that the ether is a solid without densit}" or weight, unintelli- 
gi])le as such a proposition ma}^ seem. 

In order to explain the phenomena observed we must admit tliat in 
this subtance, more rigid than steel, bodies move freely, and we may 
produce in it, by setting on fire any substance whatever, those pro- 
digiousl}' rapid vibrations called light — vibrations of sucli A'elocity 
that if we compare th(nn with the speed of a cannon ])all the latter 
seems at rest. With a piec(^ of glass cut in a certain manner Ave can 
deflect the luminiferous ether from its course and separate its A-i))ra- 
tions. It is an agent that we encounter everywhere, that Ave set into 
vibration and deflect at Avill, hut wliich Ave can never seize. 

That which is still more astonishing is the magnitude ol' tiie forces 
which Ihe ether is al)k^ to transmit. An electromagnet must act across 
a vacuum by the intermediation of the ether. Now, as Lord Kelvin 



278 INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 

remarks, it acts upon iron at a distance with a force that may amount 
to 110 kilograms per s(|uare centimeter. " How is it," nays the great 
ph3^sicist, ''that these tremendous forces are developed within the 
ether and that nevertheless solid bodies are free to move through 
this solid { ■' We do not know and we can not tell whether we shall 
ever know. We do not know the actual relations existing between 
electricit}' and the ether, although it seems more and more evident 
that one is derived from the other. 

Maxwell considers the ether ^ as composed of small s])heres animated 
with a ver}' rapid movement of rotation Avhich they transmit from 
one to another." Fresnel regarded its elasticity as constant, but its 
density as variable. Other phj'sicists believe, on the contrary, that its 
density is constant and its clasticit}^ variable. Most of them think 
that it is not displaced l)y the movements of the material systems that 
traverse it, but passes through the interstices (jf all molecules as water 
passes through sand. 

The physicists are, howcAcr, wholly agreed that the ether is a 
substance entirely different from matter and that it is not subject to 
the hiAvs of gravitation. It is a sul)stance without weight and inuna- 
terial in the usual sense of that word. It forms the world of the 
impondera])l('. 

If the ether has no weight it must nevertheless have mass, since it 
presents resistance to movement. This mass is very slight, since the 
rapidity of the propagation of light is very great. If it were nothing 
at all. such propagation would be instantaneous. 

The question of the imponderability of ether, which was dis(;ussed 
for a long time, seems now definitely settled. It was quite recently 
taken up by Lord Kelvin," and, for mathematical reasons, which I 
can not detail here, he arrives at the conclusion that the ether is formed 
])y a substance in no wav under the control of the laws of gravitation — 
that is to say, imponderal)le. '' But," adds he, " we have no reason to 
consider it as aljsolutel v incompressil)le, and we may admit that a suf- 
ficient pressure might condense it.""' 

It is prol)aV>le that from this condensation, effected at the begin- 
ning of time l)y a mechanism of which we are entirely ignorant, are 
derived the atoms which are considered b}" many physicists, notably 
Larmor, as nuclei of condensation in the ether having the form of 
little vortices endowed with an enormous rotatory velocity. " The 
material molecule,'' writes this physicist, ''is formed entirely by the 
ether, and by nothing else." '' 

It is difficult to believe that with such properties the ether is homo- 
geneous. If it had been so, the worlds coukl not have been formed.

Section S. — In tra-atom Ic chemical reactions producnuj the di>i>i<jclatk»i 

of matter. 

Ill examining the properties of radio-active bodies wc reached the 
conclusion that the radiations they produce come solely from the 
energy furnished b}' the atom where it is found in a state of enormous 
condensation. Tlie radiating particles would then be a product of a 
disintegration effected in the very interior of the atom. 

This disintegration, however, necessarily implies a change of eijui- 
librium in the arrangement of the numerous elements that compose 
an atom. Evidently it is only by passing to other forms of equilibrium 
that it can lose its energy, and consequentl}^ cause radiations. 

The variations of which it is, then, the seat, differ from those with 
which chemistry is acquainted by this fundamental particular, that 
they ai'e intra-atomic, while the ordinary reactions affecting only the 
architecture of groups of atoms are extra-atomic. Ordinary chemistry 
can onh" vary the arrangement of the stones that form an edifice. In 
the dissociation of atoms the materials of which the edifice is con- 
structed are themselves changed. 

We are ignorant of the mechanism by which this atomic disaggre- 
gation is effected, but it is quite clear that it implies conditions of a 
special kind necessaril}' very different from those hitherto studied by 
chemistr3^ The quantities of mattei- involved are infinitely small and 
the energy liberated is extraordinarily great, which is the opposite of 
what occurs in our ordinary reactions. 

We have always maintained " that there is an analogy lietween the 
phenomena observed and those peculiar chemical reactions that pro- 
duce phosphorescence. These reactions take place between bodies of 
which one, in infinitesimal proportions to the other, probabl}" acts by 
connnencing a dissociation. Sulphate of quinine, for example, is not 
radio-active. By allowing it to' become hydrated after desiccation it 
shows radio-activity as long as the hydration lasts. Mercury and tin 
present but .slight traces of radio-activity under the influence of light, 
but by adding to the first of these bodies a small portion of the second 
its radio-activity soon becomes ver}^ intense.*

In the bulbs of incandescent lamps it is noted that the incandescence is no longer 
produced if the j)r( )iiortion of oxide of cerium added to the oxide of thorium is less 
than 1 percent. Armstrong and Auer admit that tlie incandescence is due to an 
oscillatory oxidation — that is to say, one that is alternately produced and extin- 
guished. When oxidated the cerium might (^)mbine with thorium, when there would 
soon l)e decomposition, then reoxidation and cond)ination, and so on. These reac- 
tions, produce*! milHons of times a second, occasion the luminous oscillations of the 
ether which produce incandescence. The theory is very much open to discussion, 
and I reproduce it here only to show that the idea of reactions that are set up and 
discontinued millions of times a second, and consequently very different from all 
those known, seems very acceptable to eminent chemists.

280 INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 

The idea that radio-aetivity origuiate.s in a peculiar choinieal pnx-ess 
has rallied to its .support .several einiiieut phy.sici.sts. Notably, it has 
been adopted and defended by Rutherford. 

"Radio-activit}^" says he, ''is due to a succession of chemical 
chanoes in which new types of radio-active matter are contiiuially 
formed. It is a process of equilibrium in which the cost of the pro- 
duction of new radio-activity is balanced l)y the loss of the radio- 
activity already produced. The radio-activity is maintained by the 
continual production of new quantities of matter possessing tempo- 
rary I'adio-activity. 

"A radio-active body is, for that very reason, one which is being 
transformed. Radio-activity is the expression of its inces.sant lo.ss. 
Its change is necessarily an atomic disaggregation. The atoms which 
have lost something are, l)y that fact alone, new atoms.""" 

Although the (juantity of energy radiated by the atoms that are 
undergoing a commencement of disaggregation may be relatively 
very great, the loss of material substance that occurs in these reac- 
tions is very slight, precisely ])ecause of the enormous condensation 
of energy that is contained in the atom. Profes.s<n- Becquerel has 
estimated that 1 gram of radium loses 1 milligram of matter in a thou- 
sand millions of years. Professor Curie contents himself with one 
million j^ears. Still more modest, Professor Rutherford speaks only 
of some thou.sands of j^ears, and Professor Crookes of hundreds of 
3^ears. These ligures, the first of which are quite fantastic, are 
reduced more and more as more accurate experiments are made. 

According to certain (experiments of my own,! gram would last 
one hundred 3^ears, which is just the figure given by Professor Crookes. 
The matter can only be absolutely settled by repeated experiments. 

Yet even if we accept the figure that Professor Rutherford gives of 
some thousands of years for the duration of 1 gram of radium, it 
would suflice to prove that if uranium, thorium, and radium had 
existed with their radio-active properties in the geological epochs 
they would long ago have disappeared. This again supports our theor}^ 
that rapid spontaneous radio-activity appeared only after the bodies 
became engaged in certain chemical combinations capal^le of afi'ecting 
the stability of their atoms, combinations which we ma}' succeed in 
reproducing. 

What is the nature of these combinations^ Of this we are yet 
ignorant, l)ut the various examples cited in my preceding papers'' 
prove that there exists a whole series of reactions (hydration of 
various sulistances, decomposition of water, decomposition of carbide 
of calcium, etc.), capable of causing atomic di.ssociation, and which

havo not l>oeii taken into account by chemists because tlieir balances, 
the most essential means for testing, are not sufficiently sensitive to 
show the changes that occur. 

It is evident that we do not yet Icnow the mechanism of the Intra- 
atomic reactions that produce radio-activity, but we do alread}- know 
some of the conditions capable of producing this phenomenon to a 
certain degree. In chemistry it is not necessary to know all the con- 
ditions of a reaction, but often only a small number of them, in order 
to cause that reaction to appear. A child knowing nothing of the 
meclianism of a steam engine may set it going by simply shifting the 
lever by which the steam is turned on. In the greater number of 
ordinary chemical reactions we work a little as the child does, without 
comprehending anything of the action of the mechanism and seeing 
only the tinal results. 

Section D. — Modificati<m>< i)r(>(hu-<'d In. matter l>y tJie ixni'ial dimocla- 

tion (if its (ttotns. 

We know that the products of the dissociation of atoms can not be 
recombined so as to form the bodies from which they originate. We 
also know that this dissociation can not be effected, at least by the 
means at present at our disposal, except for an infinitesimal quantity 
of matter. We must not, therefore, expect to find a very profound 
modification in matter onl}' a small part of which has been dissociated. 
A modification does, however, necessarily exist. A body whose atoms 
have been partly dissociated is necessarily different from the same 
bod}' before dissociation has commenced. What, then, are the modifi- 
cations presented b}' bodies after the emission of effluvia from tiiem? 

Here we are obliged to leave for the moment the regions of pure 
experimentation and proceed by the wa}- of conjectures and analogies. 
We are at the threshold of a new chemistry in which the ordinary 
reagents and balances can not help us at all, since we are dealing with 
reactions whose ph3^sical effects ma}'^ be considerable, although the 
quantities of matter emploj'ed may l)e almost infinitely small. 

We can, however, already say that the existence of this future 
science — intra-atomic chemistry — does not depend u})on hypotheses 
alone. Numerous facts, scattered here and there, and hitluM-to un(>x- 
plained, already give some scientific support to these hypothc^ses and 
seem to l)e about to soon transform them into solid realities. 

These facts show us, indeed, tiiat certain simple bodies may undergo 
transformations sufficient to change fheir most fundanuMital proper- 
ties. 1 have shown tiiis by my expei-iincMits witii alumituim and 
magnesium, l)ut it is shown still better with metals in the so-called

very active in a dose of a three hundredth of a niillij^rani of the 
metal to a liter of water — they take on properties so intense and pecul- 
iar, so difi'erent from those which they possess in an ordinary state, 
that we can only compare them to certain org-anic compounds called 
diastases. It is found also that they act by their presence alone — that 
is to say, Avithout appearing in the final product of the reactions. 
Chemists use the term 'catalytic action'' to explain analogous facts. 
The body supposed to act only by its presence is perhaps the seat of 
special atomic disaggregations which are not shown by reagents. We 
will indicate further on experiments on phosphorescence that support 
this consideration. 

These metals in a colloidal state are obtained by various processes, 
the severest of which is the passing through distilled water of an electric 
arc between two poles made of the metal to be transformed, platinum 
or gold, for example." After a certain time the water contains, in a 
form totally unknown, something derived from the particles of the 
metal, and that in the infinitesimal dose I have mentioned above. The 
liquid is colored, but it is impossible to separate anj^thing from it by 
filtration or to perceive by the microscope any particles in suspension, 
which loads us to suppose that these particles, if they exist, are less 
than a wave length of light — that is to say, the thousandth of a milli- 
meter. It does not seem possible to admit that the metal thus trans- 
formed is in a state of solution, ^ for the water that contains it presents 
none of the characters of a solution, such as a changing of its freezing 
or boiling points, the tension of its vapor, etc. In my opinion, the 
metal is found in the state of matter that has suffered a commence- 
ment of dissociation, and it is exactly for that reason that the colloidal 
metal prepared by the electric arc possesses none of the qualities of 
the body from which it was derived. Colloidal platinum or gold are 
certainly not ordinary gold or platinum, tliough they are made from 
those metals. 

The properties of these colloidal metals are, indeed, without any 
analogy with those of a salt or even of a metal in solution. B}^ certain 
of their reactions they resemble organic compounds rather than brute 
matter. That is the reason why they have been compared to the 
toxines, a kind of diastases of unknown chemical composition gener- 
all}^ formed b3' bacteria, from which they can be separated by filtration, 
and which in imponderable doses produce tremendously active efi'ects. 

« The metals called "colloidal," like silver, for example, that are now found in 
commerce, are really simple chemical combinations and have very different 
properties. 

''This would not be theoretically impossible, notwithstanding the supposed insol- 
ubility of metals, since a 20-franc piece placed in distilled water for a short time 
leaves in the latter traces of the copper which it contains as alloy in a quantity 
that can not be shown by reagents, but which is still sufficient to poison certain aigee. 



INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 288 

According- to M. Armand Gautier, two drops of tetanic toxine, con- 
taining 99 per cent of water and onl}^ 1 per cent of the active body, is 
sufficient to kill a horse. "A gram of this body," he says "would 
kill 75,000 men." 

Metals in a colloidal state are exactly like toxines or organized fer- 
ments. Colloidal platinum decomposes oxygenated water, as do cer- 
tain ferments from the blood; by oxidation it transforms alcohol into 
acetic acid, as does the Mycoderma aceti. Colloidal iridium decomposes 
the formate of lime into carbonate of lime, carbonic acid, and hydrogen, 
as is done by certain bacteria. A still more curious thing is that 
bodies like prussic acid, iodine, etc., that poison organic fennents" 
also paralyze or destro}' the action of colloidal metals. It is necessary 
to invoke all the weight of our classical ideas concerning the invari- 
ability of chemical species in order not to see, in a body whose prop- 
erties are so profoundly different from those from which it is derived, 
a totally new substance. 

It is evident, however, that the opinion of chemists as to the invari- 
ability of atoms appear^s to rest upon a very solid basis, since, after all 
the transformations a body may undergo, we may always regenerate 
the body. Sulphate of copper bears no resemblance to metallic copper, 
but copper can be formed from it without difficulty. This argument 
will retain its value so long as we do not succeed in dissociating suffi- 
cient quantities of matter, or at least as long as we do not possess the 
physical means for revealing the transformations, often very slight, 
that occur in a bod}'^ in which a small amount of dissociation has taken 
place. When a metal is modified by a partial dissociation it is 
changed too little for us to be able to prove it by the ordinar\' chemi- 
cal reactions. 

Only physical reactions can give evidence of such modifications. 
Radium and phosphorescent bodies furnish an excellent proof of this. 
As concerns radium, for example, we know that in its chemical reac- 
tions it is entirely identical with barium. It differs from it enor- 
mously, however, by its radio-active properties — that is to sa}^, b}^ the 
permanent dissociation of its atoms, which physical means alone can 
reveal. 

As to the marvellous phenomenon of phosphorescence, it likewise 
affords an example of substances chemically identical which yet pre- 
sent an entirely novel physical property under the influence of traces 
of foreign substances that probably act by producing a connnencement 
of dissociation. The sulphides of calcium or of l)ariuni are never 

« The action of the poison varies with different toxines. They resist some ener- 
getic reagents and are influeni-ed by traces of reagents that would seem to possess 
but little activity. ]\I. Ariiiaiid Gautier has sliown that bodies as violent as prussic 
acid, corrosive sublimate, and nitrate of silver are without effect upon cobra venom, 
while mere traces of alkaline matter prevent its action.

plio.sphoresccnt when pure. Augnieiited l)y traces of certain foreign 
substances and submitted to the action of an elevated temperature 
wliich produces dissociation of matter in all bodies, as I have shown 
in a preceding' paper, these same sulphides soon become capable of 
producing phosphorescence. These examples might l)e uudtiplied. 

We must not, then, ask chemistry to inform us as to the transforma- 
tions that matter undergoes when it begins to become dissociated. It 
is also evident that the only means possessed by that science are some- 
times altogether too gross for the differentiation of bodies, and some- 
times do not succeed in differentiating them at all. Nearly a quarter 
of the elementary bodies already known — that is to say, about fifteen — 
so ]'eseml)le each other in their chemical characters that without cer- 
tain physical properties (spectroscopic lines, electric condiictibility, 
specific heat, etc.) they would never have been separated. These bodies 
are the metals whose oxides form what are called the rare earths. 
"They are distinguished from each other," say Messrs. Wyrouboff 
and Vernouil, " with some two or three exceptions, only l)v their 
ph^'sical properties, and are found to be chemically identical. They 
are so much so that by no reaction hitherto devised can they be sepa- 
rated, and we are reduced to obtaining them in a more or less pure 
state by the empirical and gross process of fractional distillation." 
In no other manner, indeed, can we obtain radimn. 

If we marshal the facts cited we arrive at this conclusion — incon- 
testable in the case of barium and radium, incontestable in the case of 
certain phosphorescent bodies, almost incontestable in the case of 
metals in a colloidal state — that reactions having- :for their probable 
origin beginnings of atomic dissociation suffice to give to bodies abso- 
lutely novel properties which none of our chemical reagents can 
detect, and which were revealed only when now means of physical 
investigation were discovered. Ordinar}' chemistry touches only, I 
repeat, the structures formed b}" atoms and modifies them at its will. 
If, however, it disposes at will of the stones of the structures, it does 
not yet know how to affect the constitution of those stones. The 
intra-atomic chemistry of the future will attempt the study of the 
phenomena which take place within the atoms. In this new science, 
of Avhich we ])arely discern the dawn, the old paraphernalia of the 
chemists — their balances and their reagents — will probably remain 
unemployed. 

Section K), — P/iasr's o^ existence erf ■/natter — Genesis and evolution of 

atoms. 

BirtJt a/td evolution of atoms. — It is hardly thirty ,vears since it 
would have been impossible to write on this subject a single w^ord 
deduced from any scientific observation whatever, and one might have 
supposed that the history of aioms would always be enveloped in

darkness. How, indeed, was it possible to suppose that they could 
evolve'^ Was it not universally admitted that they were indestructi- 
ble? Everything was changing in the Avorld, and ever3"thing was 
ephemeral. Beings succeeded each other, always taking on new forms; 
stars ended 1)}' becoming extinguished; the atom alone was not sub- 
jected to the action of time, and seemed eternal. The doctrine of its 
immutability reigned for two thousand years, and nothing- seemed to 
indicate that it could ever ])e shaken. 

We have detailed the experiments which resulted in the crumbling 
away of this aiiticjue belit^f. We know now that matter disappears 
slowl}' and that the atoms which compose it are not destined to last 
forever. 

If, however, atoms are condemned to a relatively ephemeral exist- 
ence, it is natural to suppose that they were not formerly what they 
are to-day and that they must have evolved during the course of 
ages. What were they formerly? Through what successixe phases 
have they passed? What gradations of form have they assumed? 
What were formerly the various material substances which now sur- 
round us — stone, lead, iron; in a word, all bodies? 

Astronomy alone can answer, in some degree, such questions; and, 
indeed, it has done so. Knowing how to penetrate by spectral analysis 
into the structure of stars of various ages that illuminate our nights, 
it has been able to show us the transformations that matter undergoes 
at its earliest stages. 

The eminent astronomer, Sir Norman Lock3"er, director of one of 
the large English observatories, first showed this evolution of matter 
in the stars, and was also the first who dared to maintain that the atoms 
of elementary bodies were dissociable." 

The proofs that he furnished of this last assertion were convincing-, 
but minds were not then prepared for them, and it was necessary to 
wait till the discovery of the cathedic radiations and the radio-activity 
of matter before the antique doctrine of the indestructibility of atoms 
could be shaken. 

The point of departure of the researches of Sir Norman Lockyer 
was this fundamental fact that, contrary to the ideas that first prevailed, 
the spectrum of each chemical element varies according to the temper- 
ature to which the element is submitted. For exampl(\ the spectrum 
of iron in an ordinary flame is quite different from the spectrum of 
the metal in the electric arc. In the flame it presents only a small 
numl)er of lines. In the arc it presents nearl}^ 2,000 of them. The 
spectrum of the same metal likewise varies according as we observe it 
in the hottest or the less hot portions of the sun. In tubes containing

286 INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 

rarefied, gases traversed by an electriv- discharg-e, the same gas. nitro- 
gen, for example, may give different spectra, according to the degree 
of the vacuum.. 

Carrying, then, his investigations to the stars, the same astronomer 
showed that the whitest ones — whicli are also the hottest, as is proved 
by the prolongation of their spectrum into the ultra violet — are com- 
posed of only a very small number of chemical elements. Sirius and 
«'-Lvra, for example, are composed almost exclusively of hydrogen. 
In the red and yellow stars, which are less hot, having begun to cool, 
and therefore are older, we see the other chemical elements succes- 
sively appear. First, magnesium, calcium, sodium, iron, etc., then 
the metalloids, the latter l)eing seen only in the earliest stars. It is, 
therefore, only as their temperature lowers that the elements of the 
atoms can group themselves so as to form the elementary ])odies. 
Sir Norman Lockyer finall>' arrives at the following conclusion: 
"The chemical elements are, like plants and animals, the product of 
evolution." 

The preceding ol)servations seem to definitely prove, conforma])ly, 
indeed, to one of the oldest theories of chemistry, that the various ele- 
mentar}" l^odies were derived from a single sul)stance. Hypothesis 
begins only when we suppose that this priniitive substance was pro- 
duced by a condensation of the ether. 

It appears dou])tful whether heat was the only cause of the trans- 
formation of atoms. Other iniknown forces nnist, pro])ably, have 
acted. What these forces were is, however, of no consequence; the 
essential fact is that observation of the stars shows us the evolution of 
atoms and the formation of various bodies under the influence of that 
evolution. 

M(>l>'dity and sensitiveiieKft of inatter. — We have now reached that 
phase of the history of atoms in which, under the influence of unknown 
causes whose effects only we can ascertain, they have finally' formed 
the various elementary bodies that make up our globe and all the 
beings that live upon its surface. Matter is born and will persist 
during a long succession of ages. ■ 

It persists with various characteristics, of which the most marked 
appears to be the stability of the atoms that compose it. They serve 
to form chemical structures whose form readily varies but whose mass 
remains practically invariable throughout all changes. 

The materials of the chemical structures are then vei'y stable. l>ut 
these structures are sometimes of very great fragility and always of 
extreme mobility. The least variations of the environment — tempera- 
tiu'e, pressure, etc. — instantl}' modify the movements of rotation and 
oscillation of the atoms of which matter is made up. 

These luodifications are rendered easy by the gramilar state of mat- 
ter. We are obliged to admit, in fact, that the atoms that compose it 



INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 287 

never toueli eueh othei-, and are only kept together by a special force 
called cohesion. It is this which pcM-niits bodies to retain their form. 
If it were possible to annul it by a niaoic wand, or more simply ])y an 
antagonistic force, we would instantaneously .reduce into an atomic 
dust a block of metal, a rock, or a living })eino-. ^^"e could not even 
perceive this dust, for atoms do not seem to possess any properties 
that could render them visible to our e3"es. 

If atoms are simply a condensation of energy we might say that the 
matter most rigid in appearance — a block of steel, for example — simph" 
represents a state of mobile equilibrium between the condensed energy 
that constitutes it and the various energies, heat, pressure, etc., that 
surround it. Matter 34elds to their influence as an elastic thread 
obeys tractions to which it may be subjected, yet resumes its form as 
soon as the traction ceases. 

The mobility of matter is one of its most easily- demonstrated 
characteristics, since it is only necessary to place the hand near a 
thermometer bulb to cause the column of li(|uid to become at once 
displaced. Its molecules are then separated from each other under 
the influence of slight heat. When we place the hand upon a l)lock of 
metal the movements of rotation and oscillation of its atoms are like- 
wise moditied, but so sligiitly that we fail to perceive it, which is 
precisely the reason ^vhy matter appears to us to possess very slight 
mobility. 

The general belief in its stability seems likewise cotitirmed by the 
observation that in order to cause considerable modifications in a body — 
for example, to melt it or to reduce it to vapor — it is necessary to 
employ very powerful means. 

Sufficiently precise methods of investigation show, on the contrary, 
that not only is matter extremely mobile, l>ut also that it possesses a 
sensitiveness that no living being has ever approached. 

Physiologists measure, as is well known, the sensitiveness of a being 
by the degree of excitation necessar}- in order to obtain from it a 
reaction. The being is considered as very sensitive wlien it reacts 
under slight stimuli. Applying similai- tests to brute matter we can 
show that the most rigid su})stance and the least sensitive in appear- 
ance, a bar of metal, for example, is really incredibly sensitive. The 
matter of the bolometer, formed essentially of a thin thread of plat- 
inum, is so sensitive that it reacts — l)y a variation of electric conducti- 
bility — when it is sti'uck by a rav of light having an intensity so t'eebl(> 
that it t-an produce an elevation of temperature amounting to onl^- 
one hundred millionth of a degree. 

With imi)rov('nient in oui' means of investigation this extreme sen- 
sitiveness of matter and the niol)ility that necessarilv accompanies it 
become more and moi-c nianifest. M. II. Steele latelv showed that it

is .sufficient to lightly touch ;vu iron wire with tli(^ tino-er to cause it to 

become at once the seat of an electric current. It is known that at a 

distance of hundreds of kilometers the Hertzian waves, whose energy 

at such distances is infinitely feeble, profoundly modify the structure 

of the metals that they reach, since they change in a marked degree 

their electric couductibility. On this phenomenon wireless telegraphy 

is based. Various physicists admit that under the influence of these 

waves metals instantly undergo allotropic transformations analogous 

to those that light produces in certain bodies, notabl}" phosphorus 

and sulphur. 

This extraordinary sensitiveness of matter, so contrary to what 
conunon ()]>servation seemed to indicate, becomes more and more 
familiar to physicists, and this is why an expression like ''the life 
of matter,'' devoid of sense only twenty-five years ago, is now in cur- 
rent use. The study of Innite matter re\'eals more and more proper- 
ties that formerly seemed the exclusive endowment of living beings. 
M. Bose, investigating the fact that '"the mostgenei'al and delicate sign 
of life is the response to an electric curnMit," proved that this electric 
response, " considered generally as the effect of an unknown vital 
force," exists in matter. He shows also ])y ingenious experiments'^ 
"the fatigue" of metals and its disappearance after repose, the action 
of chemical excitants and depressants, the action of poisons on these 
same metals, etc. 

Till' disftoci((tiiiii of (doiun iind the disappearance of matter. — Until 
ver}' recently the indestructibility of the elements that compose mat- 
ter was considered as the most fundamental dogma v)f chemistry. 

Nor was it vulgar o})servation alone that taught this; all the experi- 
ments of chemistry had only served to confirm it since, throughout all 
the transformations that matter might undergo, its mass, measured by 
its weight, remained in\'ariable. This invarialjility of mass had even 
come at last to be the oidy truly irreducible characteristic of matter — 
that is to say, the only one that appeared to be independent of the 
influences of the environment. The other properties, being always 
conditioned l)y the environment, appeared to ))e simple relations. 

I have recalled in this ])aper and examined in detail in a preceding 
one the facts demonstrating that matter can ])e dissociated, and conse- 
quently that its mass can not be considered as an invariable cjuantity. 
It is needless to return to this now. Let us consider the fact as 
estal)lished and try to explain it. 

The explanation will necessarily be hypothetical, as the conception 
upon which it rests is an hypothesis. According to our present ideas 
regarding the constitution of atoms, each of them may l)e considered 
as a veritable solar S3^stem comprising a central part, around which 
turn with great velocity' at least a thousand particles and sometimes 

"Journal de Physique, August, 1902. 



INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 289 

many more. The latter must tlien possess great kinetic energy. If 
an}^ cause whatever disturbs their trajectory, or if tiie rapidity of 
their rotation becomes sufficient for the centrifugal force resulting 
from it to overcome the attractive force that maintains them in their 
orbit, the peripheral particles will then escape into space, folloAving a 
tangent of the orbital curve. By this emission they will give rise to 
phenomena of radio-activity. To attempt to briefly ex])lain why these 
particles whirl about each other since the origin of things Avould be 
useless. 

Whatever may be the value of this explanation, the fact of dissocia- 
tion exists. It is very singular, surely, to see a system as stalde as 
that of the atom l)egin to dissociate under influences so slight as a 
ra}' of light or ver}^ simple chemical reactions, but these are facts of 
experience before which we must bow. 

When it was thought that radio-activity was peculiar to certain 
bodies, such as uranium and radium, it was believ^ed, and is still 
believed b}- ph3'sicists, that the instability of these bodies was a con- 
sequence of their high atomic weight. This explanation disappears 
before the fact demonstrated b}^ our former researches that it is just 
the metals of the lowest atomic weight, such as magnesium and alumi- 
num, that become the most easily radio-active under the influence of 
light, while, on the contrarv, those of high atomic weight, such as 
gold, platinum, and lead, have the lowest radio-activity. Radio- 
activity is then independent of atomic weight and is probably due, as 
I have suggested, to certain chemical reactions of unknown nature. 
Two bodies, not radio-active, may become so b}" com])ination. Mer- 
cury and tin, for example, are among' the ])odies having lowest radio- 
activity under tiie influence of light. I have shown, however, that 
mercury becomes extraordinarily radio-active under the influence of 
light as soon as there are added to it some traces of tin. 

This example and all similar ones will show that, as said al)ove, the 
causes that produce dissociation of atoms aie often very slight. How 
do they act;' Of this we are completely ignorant. Some metals that 
become very radio-active under the influence of luminous rays, having 
a certain wave length, lose this activity almost entirely under the influ- 
ence of rays whose wave length is but slightly different. These facts 
seem to have an analogy with th(^ phenomena of resonance. It is well 
known that an organ pipe or a heavy bell mav be made to vil)rate by 
sounding near it a note of a certain vibratory period, while the most 
violent noises may not affect it. 

Whatever may be the causes capable of dissociating in some slight 
degree the aggregate of condensed energy constituting the atom, 
those causes exist, and when we know thcMU better we shall certainly 
succeed in obtaining a more complete dissociation than we now do. 
It was sufficient, in the present state of science, to prove its existence. 



290 INTRA-ATOMIC ENEEGY. 

What becomes of the elements dissociated from atoms? They have 
lost, as we liave shown, their material character, and Ave suppose that 
they are made up of electric particles. Where do these particles 
g'o to '( 

We are here at the extreme limits of our knowledge aiid are reduced 
to replacing' explanations by conjectures and interrogation points. 
We have seen the material atom become dissociated. Matter consid- 
ered as energ-}^ condensed under a form in which it acquires weight, 
form, and lixit}' has become transformed into imponderable elements 
that are no longer matter, but are not yet ether. Of their destiny we 
are still entireh' ignorant. 

We know b}" experiment that the}' can not again form the matter 
from which they were derived. Does the electric atom, which all 
modern ideas lead us to consider as a localized modification of the 
ether, having a permanence in the ether, preserve its individuality 
indefinitely? Is it eternal while matter is not so? 

Whetlier it remains isolated or associates itself with matter having 
a contrary sign matters little. Even though b}- such an association it 
should form an atom of neutral electricity — an unknown thing, shown 
as yet by no experiment — it possesses an individuality. But how 
long a time does it keep it? If it does not keep it, what does it then 
become ? 

That the atom of electricit}' that necessarily had a ])eginuing is des- 
tined to have no end seems hardly probable. If all electric atoms 
persist, while their formation is continuous under the influence of so 
man}^ diverse causes, the}^ would finally accumulate to such an extent 
that they might form a new universe or at least a sort of nebula. It 
is therefore probable that they end by losing their individual existence* 
But how can they then disappear? Can we suppose that their destiny 
is like that of the blocks of ice that float about in the polar regions and 
preserve their individual existence so long as they do not encounter 
the only cause that can destrov them — an elevation of temperature? 
As soon as this cause of destruction acts upon them the}' vanish and 
disappear in the ocean. Such, perhaps, is the final destiny of the 
electric atom. When it has radiated all its energy it disappeai's in the 
ether and is no more." 

«This conception evidently does not agree with the first principle of thermo- 
dynamics; but if the dogma of the indestructibility of matter is taken away, that of 
tlie conservation of energy f?eem9 likewise somewhat menaced, ffowever, the ques- 
tion is too important to be discussed here, and we will take it up in another paper. 
It seems very proba])le, and I am not alone in so thinking, that the law of the 
conservation of energy, whose uncertain limits tiave been so V)rilliantly demonstrated 
by M. Poincare in his recent work. La Science et I'Hypothese, is, Hke most physical 
laws, like that of Mariotte, for example, true only within certain limits. It would, 
then, be useful to preserve it for convenience in calculations. 



INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 291 

If the view.s sot forth in this paper are correct, there exist four suc- 
cessive forms of matter. Two are l^nowu to us by experience; the 
first and the last are as 3'et hypothetical. 

The first form is that exhibited by the ether. 

The second that of ordinar}^ matter, formed t)f atoms which are, 
according- to our view, only condensed energy in a special state, from 
which result form, weight, and fixity. 

The third form, with which dissolution commences, is represented 
by the so-called electric atom, a substance intermediate between ordi- 
nar}^ matter and the ether — that is to say, between the ponderable and 
the imponderable. The matter has lost its weight, its inertia is no 
longer constant, and its fixity seems to be transitory. 

The last phase of the existence of matter would be that in which the 
electric atom, having lost its individuality — that is to say, its fixity — 
disappears in the ether. This would be the final term of the dissocia- 
tion of matter, the final nirvana, into which it seems that everything 
must return after an ephemeral existence. 

Yet these are merelv interpretations. We must not depart from the 
facts set forth and which have proved that atoms become dissociated. 

Since, too, we have proved that this dissociation is a general phe- 
nomenon, we are authorized to conclude that the doctrine of invaria- 
bility of atomic weights, on which all modern chemistry is founded, is 
only a deceptive appearance, resulting entirely from the want of sensi- 
tiveness in balances. If they were sensitive to the millionth of a 
milligram, they would show that all our chemical laws are merely 
approximations. If balances were capable of such precision, we should 
soon show that under many circumstances, and particularly during 
chemical reactions, the atom loses a part of its weight. We are then 
authorized to conclude, contrar}^ to the principle stated b}" Lavoisier 
as the basis of chemistry, that we never find in a chemical com- 
bination the total weight of the bodies emploj-ed to produce that 
combination." 

The correctness of this capital fact begins to be recognized by emi- 
nent physicists. For example, recently before the Physical Society of 

« We are already beginning to prove this experimentally by using extremely sensi- 
tive balances and operating during a sufficiently long time. " By the aid of a balance 
of great precision," writes M. Lucien Poincare, "MM. Landv/olt and Heydweiler 
have weighed numerous bodies before and after the action of chemical changes which 
those bodies set up, and these two very expert and very cautious physicists have not 
been afraid to announce the sensational result that under certain circumstances the 
weight is not the same before and after the reaction. To particularize, the weight of a 
solution of sulphate of copper in water is not the exact sum of the weight of the salt 
and the Aater." (Revue des Sciences, January, 1903, p. 96.) 



292 INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY. 

London Sir Oliver Lodi>e, referring to experiments in radio-activit}^, 
expressed himself as follows: 

The evolution or tranHforniation of matter is experimentally demonstrated by 
experinientH ni)on radio-activity. The heavy atoms <if radio-active l)odies apj)ear to 
collapse and throw off atoms of low atomic weight. It might be thought that this 
hypothesis about the degradation and instability of the atoms is mere speculation, 
l)ut it is the most reasonable explanation of the observed phenomena. According to 
the electric theory of matter, i. e., on the view that the atom contains electrons 
with rapid intra-atomic movements obeying laws like astronomical laws, this insta- 
bility ought to exist. We must not suppose that atoms are permanent and eternal. 
We may possibly iind a rise and decay in ordinary matter. The history of an atom 
presents analogies with that of a solar system. On the electric theory of matter, the 
falling together of electrons might produce the electric aggregate known as an atom, 
and its subse(juent gradual decay or separation into other forms would be accompa- 
nied by epochs of radio-activity. " 

In an addi-ess, also <|uite reeent. Sir William Crookes arrived at an 
analogous conclusion : 

This fatiil quality of atomic dissociation ajjpears to Ix; universal and operates when- 
ever we brush a piece of glass with silk; it works in the sunshine and raindrops, 
and in the lightnings and flame; it prevails in the waterfall and the stormy sea. 
And although the whole range of human experience is all too short to afford a 
parallax whereby the date of the extinction of matter can be calculated, protyle, the 
"formless mist," once again may reign supreme, and the hour hand of eternity will 
have completed one revolution.'' 

Let us now I'eeapitulate. 

By this long analysis Ave have followed the atom from its l)irth to 
its decline. We have seen it forming, developing, then beginning to 
disappear. Trying to ascertain its nature we have -shown that it con- 
stitutes a tremendous reservoir of energy, and is prol)ably nothing but 
condensed energ}^ susceptible of being slowly dissociated. 

We are certainly ignorant of the nature and mode of action of 
forces capable of condensing a part of the ether that fills the universe 
into atoms of any gas whatever — such as hydrogen or helium, for 
example — then of transforming such gas into substances like sodium, 
lead, or gold, but the changes observed in the stars show that forces 
capable of producing such transformation actuall}^ exist, that they 
have operated in the past and still continue to operate. 

According to Laplace's theory of cosmogeny the sun and planets 
were at first a great rotating nebula at whose center a nucleus formed 
and from which rings were successively detached, which later formed 
the earth and other planets. At first gaseous, these masses became 
gradually cooled, and the space primitivel}^ filled b}^ the nebida was 
occupied only by a few globes that continue to rotate around their

the composition of atoms, we are authorized to suppose that eacli of 
them was formed in a simihir manner, and, in spite of its minute size, 
represents a Aerita])le solar system. 

Yet our nebula, like those which still continue to illuminate the 
night, necessarily came from something. In the present state of 
science we can onl}^ suggest the ether as a possible source from which 
this something arose, and that is Avh}^ all investigations lead us Vmckto 
considering it as the fundamental element in the universe. The 
worlds were born in it and they will die in it. 

We are ignorant how an atom came to ))e formed and why it ends 
by slowly disappearing; but we at least know that a similar evolution 
is taking place in the worlds that surround us, since we can observe 
them going through all the phases of evolution from the nebula to the 
cooled star, passing through the stage of incandescent suns similar to 
our own. The transformations of the inorganic world now appear 
to be as certain as those of organized ])eings. The atom and conse- 
quentl}" matter do not escape from this sovereign and mysterious law 
which rules over the birth, growth, and death of the innumerable 
stars which people our firmament. 

It is in these atomic S3'stems, which were ignored for so long a time 
because of their extreme minuteness, that we must doubtless look for 
the explanation of some of the mysteries that surround us. The inti-

It is not only from a purely theoretical point of view that it is nec- 
essar}" to thoroughl}" stud}- the atomic systems and the tremendous 
energies that work within them. Science may be on the eve of cap- 
turing these energies whose existence was unsuspected and thus ren- 
der unnecessary the mining of coal. The provision of combustibles 
that the terrestrial strata contain is rapidl}' becoming exhausted, and if 
this reservoir of energy fails, manufactures, the essential element of 
civilization, are destined to perish. AVithout coal, indeed, railroads 
and steamboats would l)e stopped, factories closed, and electric lights 
extinguished. The man of science who finds the means of economically 
li])erating the forces that matter contains will almost instantaneously 
change the face of the world. An illimitable source of energy being 
gratnitously at the disposal of man, he would not have to procure it 
by severe lal)or. The poor would ])e the eipials of the rich, and the 
social (|uestion would be no longer agitated. 



THE ELECTRIC FURNACE. « 



Bv J. Wright. 



There are few inventions in the electrical tield which have benefited 
the chemist and metallurgist more than that comprised under the gen- 
eral title of ''electric furnace/' Up to, comparative!}^ speaking, a few 
years ago the highest attainal)le temperature by any known artificial 
means was 1,800"^ C, or, possibly, with exceptional facilities and the 
exercise of great care, as high a temperature as 2,000° C. may, in some 
cases, have been attained, though the exact limit is questionalde; cer- 
tainly it does not rise much above the latter figure. Thanks, how- 
ever, to the indefatigal)le researches of Moissan, Siemens, Borchers, 
Cowles, and some other investigators, we now possess a means for the 
artificial production of temperatures far above this limit, which enable 
us to fuse and otherwise treat commercially such hitherto refractory 
substances as chromium, platinum, carbon, and even the once inde- 
structible crystalline form of that element, the diamond. 

Generally speaking, electric furnaces may be divided under two 
main headings, namely, those in which the heating effect is produced 
by the electric arc established between two carbon or other electrodes 
connected with the source of current, connnonly knowni as arc fur- 
naces; and those in which the heating effect is produced by the pas- 
sage of the current through a resistance, which either forms part and 
parcel of the furnace proper, or is constituted, by ft suitably conduct- 
ing train, of the material to be treated in the furnace. The principle 
of this latter type is analogous to that involved in the heating to 
incandescence of the ordinary electric-lamp filament, and such fur- 
naces are, as u class, known as resistance furnaces. 

The earlier electric furnaces naturally assumed an experimental* 
form, and of these that devised ])y Moissan, the celebrated chemist 
and investigator, is probabl}' the simplest. It is an arc furnace, and 
consists of two chalk blocks bored out at their centers to receive a 
carbon crucible, which incloses the center or hearth of the furnace 
proper. Into this cavit}' pass two massive carbon electrodes, through 
openings provided for them in the walls of the structure, which is 
held together by massive clamps. Suitable terminal connections to

the car)>oii rods jiro prt)vided. exterior to the furnuee, :nid tlie arc 
e.stabli.slied between their inner extremities when the current is turned 
on plays over the center of the crucible, h(^ating its contents. 

A furnace of this type, though its capacity is limited to a single 
charge t)f the cruci])le at each operation, has nevertheless proved 
itself of extreme utility in laboratory ])ractice, and is a very efficient 
source of heat in that the hearth or center of activity is entirely sur- 
rounded by refractory, nonconducting walls. Yeiy little heat is, 
consequently, lost by difiusion or radiation. 

A somewhat more elaborate modification of Moissan's original fur- 
nace has been devised by Messrs. Ducn^tet & I.,ejeune, of Paris, and is 
shown in fig. 1. It consists of a refractorv chani])er R, ])uilt of fire 
brick or some other suitable material, and provided with an opening 
A, through which the substances to ])e treated may be introduced. C C 
are carbon rods supported in massive tubular clamps T T, which are 
water-jacketed to keep down their temperature to a safe limit. 1) is a 
carbon or magnesia crucible, forming the hearth of the furnace and 
containing a ciiarge of the material to be treated, while W is a remov- 




able window or inspection opening, fitted with rid)y glass, through 
which o])erations re((uiring only a moderate heat can be watched 
while in progress. When utilized for higher temperatures, this glass 
slide is replaced 1»y a slab of refractory material, such as fire l)rick. 
The carbons C C project through the walls of the furnace at right 
angles to each other, and the necessary separation of their inner 
extremities for the establishment of the arc takes place at a point just 
above the mouth of the crucible B, as shown. A system of tubes leads 
into the interior of the chamber K, and serves, when required, for the 
introdtiction of special gases with which it may be necessar}' to cause 
the contents of the crucibl(> to enter into chemical com})ination. A 
horseshoe permanent magnet M, manipulated at the exterior, exerts a 
repellant force upon the arc, directing it down into the crucible as 
desired, after the manner of a blowpipe. 

Sir William Siemens was the first to apply the electric arc furnace 
to conunercial operations, and his apparatus and experiments were 
described in a paper read by him before the Society of Telegraph

Engineei-8. According- to this a.stutc imestigator, who seems to have, 
in a measure, grasped the conditions and general principles necessary 
to the successful operation of an arc furnace — no mean conception, 
when one considers the general lack of knowledge on the subject 
which prevailed at the time (over twenty' years ago) — the advantages 
in favor of the electric furnace as a source of heat are that, theoretic- 
ally, the heat obtainable is unlimited; fusion is effected in a perfectlv 
neutral atmosphere; the operation can be carried on in a laboratory, 
without much preparation, and under the eye of the operator; and 
that the limit of heat practically obtainable with the use of ordinary 
refractory materials is very high, l)ecause in the electric furnace the 
fusing material is at a higher temperature than the crucible, whereas 
in ordinar}^ fusion the temperature of the crucible exceeds that of the 
material fused within it. 

The general principle of the early Siemens arc f ui-nace is represented 
in tig. 2, in which B is a refractory crucible of plumbago, magnesia, 
lime, or other suitable material, 
which may be varied according to 
the nature of the su}>stance to be 
dealt with. It is supported at the 
center of a cylinder or jacket J, 
^nd is packed around with broken 
charcoal, or a similarh' pool' 
conductor of heat. Being thus 
isolated, as it were, from the sur- 
rounding atmosphere, it retains 
its heat, and very little is lost })y 
diffusion. The negatiAC electrode 
consists of a massive carbon rod 
C passing verticalh^ through the 
center of the lid of the crucible and free to move vertically therein, 
though the clearance opening is, for obvious reasons, very small. The 
rod C is suspended from the lower end of a copper strap S, which 
conducts the current from it, being attached at its upper end to the 
curved extremity of a horizontal beam A. The other side of the beam 
is provided with an adjustable weight W, and carries, suspended from 
its extremity by a hinged joint, a hollow soft-iron cylinder e, forming 
the core of the solenoid E. P is a dash-pot arrangement in which the 
cylinder works, the tendency of E being to raise it out of V against 
the counteracting force of the weight W, thus lowcM-ing the negative 
electrode into the crucible. The solenoid winding is connected as a 
shunt across the two (dectrodes. The positive electrode F, which may 
be of iron, platinum, or car!)()n, consists of a rod of one or the other 
of these materials })assing up through the center of the l)ase of the 
crucible. The furnace was originally' designed by Siemens for the

fusion of refractory metals and their ores; consequentl3", once the 
action is started, electrical contact is estalilished between the lower 
electrode F and the semimetallic mass in the crucible, and the arc con- 
tinues to play between the surface of the mass and the movable carljon 
rod C. As the current through the furnace increases, that through 
the shunt winding of the solenoid diminishes, and the weight W coming 
into play causes its end of the beam to descend, thereby raising the 
negative electrode C and restoring equilil)rium. 

The AVillson furnace is essentiall}' a modification of Siemens's orig- 
inal form, the solenoid regulation of the upper movable carbon being 
replaced bv a worm and hand wheel, wdiile the furnace is made contin- 
uous in op(M-ation l)y the i)rovision of a tapping hole for drawing off 
the molten products. This type of furnace was employed in the man- 
ufacture of calcium carbide, which, 
Avhen drawn off in a molten state, 
is much purer than the ingot or 
broken-lump form, in which the 
greater bidk of that commodity is 
placed on the market. 

The Parks carbide furnace, de- 
vised by W. P. Parks, of ('hicago, 
is of the arc variety and provides for 
the production of calcium carbide 
in the molten state. It is repre- 
sented in fig. 3 and consists of a 
vertical cylindrical structure F of 
refractory material, provided with 
a carbon hearth C, which at the 
same time acts as the negative elec- 
trode. It has an annular channels* 
cut in its upper surface, which latter 
is flush with the inner floor of F. 
This chaimcl collects the molten carbide formed, and it drains down, 
to be ultimately drawn ofl" at A. The upper, positive, electrode B 
consists of a massive, hollow carbon cylinder, in the lo\Aer half of 
which, or the portion inside the furnace F, are cut radial slots s s, 
which subdivide the electrode and tend to set up a circle of arcs 
around the space bounded b}' the hearth. T T are gas-supply pipes, 
ending in hydrocarbon burners inside of B, which primarily heat the 
raw material as it passes down the hollow center of the electrode. 
The feeding: is eflected from a hopper H by an Archimedean screw 
working in the casing D. 

An electrolytic furnace, utilized in the separation of alumimuu from 
a mixture of purified alumina and crj^olite, is that adopted in what is 
known as the Herault process, which is being worked by the British 




Fig. 3. 



THE ELECTEIC FURNACE.

Ahuuiniviin Company, of Foj^ers, New Brunswick, and ono or two 
metallurgical tirms on the Continent. 

It consists of an outer iron casing- or container F (tig. 4) resting on 
an insulating base. This container is lined with massive car}»on plates, 
cemented together with tar or suita})le conducting material, and so 
arranged as to form at the center a recess or liearth H, an outlet o^ 
from the ]H)ttom leading out to the exterior of the furnace, and pro- 
viding for drawing off the molten metal. 
^ A series of copper pins e (\ di'iven into the iron walls of the container, 
""serve as a means of terminal connection to the car])on ])locks, which 
constitute one electrode of tlie furnace, while the other, C, consists of 
a number of carbon plates, placed face to face, like the leaves of a 
book, the spaces between being tilled in with some good electrical con- 
ductor, such as sheet copper. The composite electrode thus built up 
is mounted in a frame E, by means of whicli it can ])e raised or low- 
ered as required, and terminal con- 
nection is secured by means of an 
encircling clamp T. The electrode C 
passes through a clearance opening 
in the lid L of the furnace, which 
consists of graphite plates; openings 
'p J) are also provided for the intro- 
duction of the raw material (alumina 
and cryolite), thereby making the 
furnace continuous in operation. 

The furnace is charged with pui'i- 
fied alumina and cryolite, as already 
indicated, and, the electrode C having 
been lowered, the action is started. The heat thus set up, combined 
with the electrolytic action of the current, results in the setting free 
of metallic aluminum, while oxygen gas is evolved at the positive or 
carl)on electrode and enters into coml)ination with it, forming the gases 
monoxide and dioxide of carbon. 

The molten aluminum collects at the l)ottom of the hearth and is 
tapped off through the outlet o, fresh material being fed in and the 
height of the electrode C regulated as the operation proceeds. 

The King furnace is also of the arc variety and is utilized in the 
manufa<'ture of carbide in ingot form. It consists of a tire-brick 
cham))er, through the roof of which passes vertically the upper 
adjustable electrode. The lower, ffxed, electrode is carried l)y a small 
truck or trolley, which runs along rails at the ])ase of the structure and 
acts the part of crucil)le or hearth. The lime and carbon are fed into 
it down lateral. channels in the walls of the furnace and are caused to 
coml)ine by the heat of the arc set up. Th(> upper (dectrode is gradu- 
ally raised as the raw material is fed in, until, at a certain point, the

truck ]>ocome.s lilU'd with ;i l»l()ck or ina.ss of calciuni carbide and is 
then wheeled out of the furnace to discharge its h)ad. Wliih' fusion 
is in progress a slight reciprocating motion is given to the truck, 
which serves to shake the charge well down and introduce fresh por- 
tions of it into the path of the arc proper. 

The Chavarria-Contardo arc furnace for 
the manufacture of calcium carbide pos- 
sesses several novel ])oints. Its general 
principle is represented diagrammatically 
in tig. 5, where e e are the electrodes, run- 
ning parallel to one another and slightly 
al>ove the axis of the channel or trough 
T, which forms the hearth; c e are thin 
gra})hite plates, built up to form a roof- 
shaped structure, which I)ecomes itself 
intensely hot when the furnace is active. 
The raw^ material is fed in at A, and, pass- 
ing over the upper surfaces of c c, receives 
a ])i'elimiiiary heating of no mean degree; 
it then passes down, taking the course 
indicated by the dotted lines, under the 
electrodes e e and into the trough T, where it is su])jected to the most 
intense reflected heat of the are. The molten carbide formed is drawn 
off l)y wa}' of the outlet o. 

The disposal of the gases, especiall}' carl)on monoxide, resulting 
from the reactions in a carbide furnace has long be(Mi a stumbling 
block to the manufacturer in that any attempt at modifying the furnace 
to this end resulted in luidesira- 
ble complications and increased 
prime cost. This has been, in a 
measure, overcome in theFrolich 
arc furnace for car])ide manufac- 
ture, invented l)y Dr. Oscar Fro- 
lich. of Streglitz, Germany. The 
general arrangement is shown 
in tig. 6 and consists of a cylin- 
drical iron cruci])le F, mounted 
on standards S, and tapering at 
its base to a central discharge 
orifice. 

A lining of lire clay L protects 
the cylindrical W'all, while the 

inner surface of the conical base is covered by the carbon electrode C. 
The remaining electrode consists of the massive carbon cylinder B, 
which is hollow, and depends, with its lower edge just over the dis- 
charge oritice, the arc taking place between the two edges of the

ciirV)on.s. Tu])osTT lead from the upper portion of the earl)on cylin- 
der B to the annular chandler R,.just outside and inclosing- the space 
bounded by the lower electrode C. The g-ases of combustion pass up 
the center of B, which acts as a Hue, and down by way of the tubes 
T T to R, where they mingle with air, adiuitted through perforations 
in the casing, and are consumed, the linal products passing- out through 
the discharge pipe P. 

The raw material is fed into the mouth of the furnace around the 
central electrode, and, passing through tlie annular arcing- region at 
the l)ottom, where it becomes converted into carbide, falls onto the 
adjustable conical table D. This is provided with a lip around its 
lower edge and is mounted on a stem .s', which, gearing- with the lever 
Z, permits of its being raised or lowered according as the operation of 
the furnace is intermittent or continuous. 

The Denbergh furnace for the manufacture of sulphuric and phos- 
phoric acids, and also " water-glass," or sodium ortho-silicate, is shown 
in tig. 7. It consists of an ordinar}" 
fire-brick structure F, lined at /■ with 
a refractory material impervious to 
the gases produced in the reactions, 
an outlet for which gases is provided 
at (>. The bod}^ of the furnace is 
contracted below, as shown, and the 
outlet R for the fused products is 
led up within the walls themselves, 
from the point of lowest level to 
another point of higher level, which 
defines the depth of converted ma- 
terial contained within the furnace. 

The lid L carries a charge inlet i and a hopper H, the feeding being 
secured mechanicalh' by a reciprocating movement communicated to 
the piston p, which works in a C3dinder c, carrying- a definite quantity 
before it at each stroke. The electrodes E E are of carbon, passing 
thi'ough terminal sockets in which they are capable of motion in a 
direction corresponding with their axes, which permits of feeding as 
they wear away, whilst the sockets, in turn, are mounted in a species 
of swivel joint, which allows the angle of inclination, and consequently 
the height of the arc, to bo varied at will. 

Roller's arc furnace is of a simple description. It consists of a 
longitudinal chamber, with massive carbon blocks projecting through 
the end walls. A series of carbon blocks, supported in line with the 
terminal electrodes, are arranged along the chamber at regular inter- 
vals, their number varying according- to the voltage. The arc is tints 
split up into series, and a numl)er of heated regions are secured in the 
center of the mass of raw material which is packed around the blocks. 




302 



THE ELECTRIC B^URNACE. 




Fig. 8. 



The Henriveiix furnace, for the manufacture of glass, consists of 
three steps or slabs of refractory material, forming a species of cascade, 
the mixture to be fused being fed from a hopper onto the top step, 
whence it descends by gravity over the remainder. The heat from a 
powerful arc is directed upon each of the three steps, and the mass, in 
passing through the series of three, emerges finally in a molten state, 
and is collected in a suitable receptacle at the bottom, where it is main- 
tained in a state of fusion by a gas or coke fire. It is said to be a very 
wasteful process in that a considerable quantity of the heat developed 
in the arcs is lost or dissipated without performing useful work. 

Passing now to resistance f ur- 

^•- -^ naces, Borchers's is typical of 

that class in which a core, form- 
ing part of tlie furnace itself, is 
heated by the passage of the cur- 
rent through it, and imparts its 
heat to the surrounding mass of 
material contained in the furnace. It is represented in fig. 8, and 
consists of a l)lock B of refractory material, through the center of 
which passes an opening R, forming the crucible or center of activity 
into which is fed the material to be treated. This space R is- bridged 
bv a thill carbon rod t\ which is attached at its extremities to two 
massive carbon electrodes C C, passing through the walls of the 
furnace and fed with current througli the large metal clamps M. 
These massive electrodes serve to conduct the current without undue 
heating to the smaller rod c, through Avhich it passes in turn, rais- 
ing it to a very high temperature, owing to the resistance ofl'ered to 
its passage bv a conductor of considerably smaller cross section, and 
forming, as it were, a central, 
heated axis to the material con- 
tained in the crucible. It thus 
diffuses its heat throughout the 
mass from its center outwards. 
The Gibbs resistance furnace 
is based on the Borchers prin- 
ciple, a carbon rod, or rods, of small section l)eing supported l)etween 
massive carbon blocks set in cast-iron sockets let into the brickwork. 
The novelty of this invention, however, lies in the position of the 
small resistance rods. These are located above the furnace charge 
and do not come into actual contact with it at all, the heat l)eing 
communicated by reflection from the domed roof. 

The Acheson furnace for the manufacture of carborundum is a 
somewhat rudimentary device, in that it is built up and pulled down 
again for each charge of raw material dealt with. It is represented in 
diagram by fig. 9, in which F is a rough fire-brick structure, through 




THE ELECTRIC FURNACE. 303 

the end walls of which project the electrodes C C, consisting of com- 
posite bundles of carbon rods set in massive metal clamps M. The ' 
space between the two electrodes is bridged by a conducting path of 
coke A, which constitutes the distinct core of the furnace, and rele- 
gates it to the class of which Borchers's furnace is a typical example. 
This core is packed round with the raw material N, consisting of coke, 
sand, sawdust, and common salt. The process of conversion is said 
to be far from economical. 

A resistance furnace, based upon the fundamental principle of the 
Nernst lamp, has been devised by Doctors Nernst and G laser. The 
resistance, or heater, is cyiindrical, electrical connection with it at 
the top and bottom being secured by an annular packing of some con- 
ducting oxide held in place by iron clamps and l)olts. The hollow 
cylinder is surrounded by a jacket of oxide loosely packed between 
it and an outer cylindrical sheath, an arrangement which prevents 
undue waste of heat. The heating cylinder, which consists of a mix- 
ture of magnesia, calcium carbonate, alumina, and silica, is closed by 
a lid, and the substance to be treated is either packed directly into it 
or contained in a crucible located within it. In the former case the 
cylinder is protected internally b}^ an additional lining of pure mag- 
nesia, coated with graphite to give it an initial conductivity. 

The Cowles furnace, again, is typical of that class of resistance fur- 
nace in which the path of high resistance consists of the material to be 
treated and does not form part of the furnace proper. The Cowles 
furnace first made its appearance in 1884, and takes several forms, all 
more or less similar in general principle, but differing in such details 
as affect the class of work for which they are intended. 

In its simplest form it consists of an oblong fire-brick structure, 
provided with a lid, in w^liich are one or more vent holes to permit the 
escape of the gases generated. Massive carbon electrodes are intro- 
duced horizontally through the two ends of the furnace, electrical 
connection with them being secured, in an earl}" form, ])y a species of 
tubular gland through which each electrode passed and which was 
filled with copper shot. In passing to and fro through these glands 
the carbon rods set up a kind of rolling friction with the shot, and 
fairly good electrical contact was thus established between them. 

A preliminary lining of granular charcoal was given to the furnace, 
which, l)eing a bad conductor of heat, prevented undue loss due from 
radiation and diffusion. Inside this lining, again, was packed the par- 
tially conducting mass to be heated, forming a chain between the two 
carbon electrodes. When the current was turned on this mass became 
heated by the passage of the current through it, after the manner of 
the carbon filament in the ordinary incandescent lamp. 



304 



THE ELECTRIC FURNACE. 




In a later form (tig. 10) of the Cowles furnace- charging- funnels F F 
were introduced through apertures in the lid, while the hearth sloped 
from cither end to the center, at the lowest point of which was provided 
an outh^t <> for drawing off the molten products. C C are the carbon 
electrodes; G, the glands containing the shot; and c, the lining of non- 
conducting charcoal. The funnels F, hy a judicious feeding process, 

provided a means of 
keeping the resist- 
y^C, ance of the column of 
material fairly uni- 
form at ;U1 points, 
thus insuring an even 
distribution of heat 
Fig. 10. throughout the mass. 

The Cowles furnace for the treatment of zinc ores was also of the 
resistance type, and is represented by fig, 11, where R is a long c^d- 
inder of fire clay, mounted in a brickwork setting and surrounded by 
a jacket of some refractory material J, which is also a ])ad conductor 
of heat. The inner end of the cylinder \i is effectually closed by a 
flanged disk of carbon C, which also constitutes one electrode of the 
furnace, the other taking the form of a plumbago crucible P, the con- 
vex base of which tits into the outer extremit}^ of the cylinder R and 
forms a removable seal. Further, by way of an aperture a in the 
wall of the crucible, the metallic zinc passes over into it by distillation 
and is collected therein, a chinmey or outlet c serving to carry off' the 
gases and fumes produced. The charge of broken ziiic ore is, as before, 
spread evenly along the cylinder, 
so as to form a semiconducting 
chain between the two electrodes. 
The Cowles furnace for the 
manufacture of aluminum alloys 
partook of the nature of Bor- 
chers's furnace, although it had 
not, strictly speaking, a continu- 
ous resistance core of its own. 
Two massive tubular electrodes, 
provided with a means for manual adjustment, carried close-fitting 
cores of smaller section, which inclined to one another and actually 
met, forming a conducting core of high resistance at a point in the 
center of the furnace immediately under the aperture of the feeding- 
hopper. These smaller electrodes, together with the raw material fed 
on to them at the point of meeting, formed a conducting link of high 
resistance between the main electrodes, and the heating efi'ect of the 
current was thus localized and confined to the point at which it was 
most needed, namel}^ at the feeding center of the cavity.

and intended mainly for the reduction of iron ores or the manufacture 
of steel, consists of a cylindrical lire-brick structure, the inner wall of 
which is contracted to form a narrow opening at about two-thirds of 
its depth to the hearth proper, which lies below. At the contraction 
is introduced a circular set of electrodes of segmental form, made of 
the usual compressed carbon mixture, and isolated from one another 
by intervening segments or pillars of lire brick. 

The electrode segments constitute an even number, and are con- 
nected alternately to the positive and 
negative poles of the source of current. 
Means of adjustment are provided 
which allow the segments to be fed radi- 
ally" as they wear away. A similar circle 
of segmental electrodes surrounds the 
central portion of the furnace proper, 
or crucible, which is located below the 
contraction and provided with an outlet 
for drawing off the molten metal as ite- 
forms. By a suitable manipulation of 
the current and connections to the fur- ^"'- ^'-'• 

nace it is possible with this device to secure a combination of heated 
zones or paths through the mass of material under treatment, the 
position of which can l)e varied at will, so as to penetrate to all i^arts 
and secure a homogeneous and uniform fusion. 

The Readman-Parker furnace for the manvifacture of phosphorus 
was invented independently by these two gentlemen in 1S8S, and they 
subsequently combined their ideas to form a community of interests. 
It consists of the usual lire-])rick structure F, tig. 12, and feeding 

hopper H, the furnace being hermetically 
sealed in order to exclude atmospheric air. 
A discharge flue A carries oft' the gases and 
vapors formed during the process, and the 
interior of the chamber is contracted at its 
lower portion, as shown, to form a hearth. 
'C Mutiple electrodes E E are employed, 
facing one another in two rows, passing- 
through the side walls of the structure, 
while smaller electrodes e <% below them,

withdrawn, and the action, which resembles that of a resistance fur- 
nace with a conducting ]xith formed of the material under treatment,

retort or crucible lined throug'hout with car])on C, forminj^ one elec- 
trode, the other being a massive carbon block of rectang-idar section 
B, which is supported at the center of the retort, and is of such 
dimensions that its corners approach very closely to the inner carbon 
walls of that vessel. The raw material is fed in at hoppers on either 
side of B, their position being- indicated by the circles a and h. While 
working the crucible and its contents revolve, thus constantly bring- 
ing fresh portions of the mass within the zone of activity, while by a 
carefully proportioned train of gearing the electrode B is gradually 
raised at such a rate that its lower extremity is always immersed at a 
constant deptli in the mass under treatment, Avhile an ingot of finished 
carbide is graduall}' ])uilt up ])eneath it in the crucible. 

A series of patents have been recently granted in the United States 
on electric furnaces for the manufacture of such comminuted products 
as pigments, al)rasives, oxides, refined metals, and a miscellaneous 
collection of similar character. The general arrangement consists of 
an arc or resistance furnace, with which is combined an air blast 
device, playing either inuiiediately onto the furnace contents or upon 

the vapors arising from it. An ex- 
ample will serve to demonstrate the 
general principle involved. 

Fig. l-t represents a furnace of this 
description, devised by C. S. Lomax 
and patented as recently as March, 
1902. It is intended for the manufac- 
ture of the various couunercial oxides 
of lead and tin. A refractory l)lock F has a narrow channel <• cut in 
its upper surface; this constitutes the hearth of the furnace, and is of 
uniform cross section for about the center third of its length. At each 
extremity it merges into a deeper and wider wedge-shaped cavity, in 
either of which is placed, vertically, an electrode; T is a main, supply- 
ing cold or heated air to the discharge jets t t, which are set at such an 
angle that the air emerging from them is projected downward into the 
central trough or channel; L is a cover or screen which collects the 
products and guides them into the chamber 11. 

The mode of procedure is exceedingly simple. The channel c, 
together with its enlarged ends, is filled with the molten lead or tin to 
be converted; the current is turned on, and that portion of the molten 
colunni bounded by the narrow central channel innnediately attains 
a considerable temperature, owing to its smaller cross section. When 
the i-equired heat has been reached the air blast is brought into play, 
causing the finely divided metallic particles to combine with its oxygen, 
the resulting compound being carried over into the chamber R. This 
form of furnace is adaptable to making a variety of oxides, the neces- 
sary changes in chemical combination being brought about by A^arying 
the respective temperatures of the air blast and the molten metal.

Ruthenl)urg's electro-magnetic furnace is another practical example 
of the proverb "Necessity is the mother of invention." One of the 
purest sources for the extraction of metallic iron is ''iron sand" and 
similar ores, the process of treating- which has hitherto been hampered 
b}" their finely divided state and consequent clogging of the smelting 
furnaces. Ruthenburg's invention has in view the preliminary agglom- 
eration of this sand, with the object of thus converting it into a form 
more suitable for the ordinary operation of smelting. 

His furnace is represented in fig. 15, and consists of two similar 
cast-iron hoppers H H, hinged together at the point of support a, and 
into which the iron sand is fed at equal rates. The discharge orifices 
o o are opposite to each other, and the distance between them can be 
varied at will by the handwheel and worm W. The two hoppers con- 
stitute the electrodes, terminal con- 
nection with them being secured as 
shown at f t^ where the discharge noz- 
zles are also water jacketed; C C are 
magnetizing coils encircling the hop- 
pers and having their windings con- 
nected either in series with or in shunt 
across the hoppers. Their office is 
to magnetize the individual particles 
of the sand, causing them to adhere 
together temporarily, and thus assist 
in forming a self-supporting mass M 
across the discharge apertures. This 
mass is subjected to the maximum 
heating effect, and the semimolten 
prt)duct drops away into the crucible 
R, placed to receive it. 

A novel t^'pe of resistance furnace, 
patented independently, with some 
slight variation of detail, by Colby, l^Vrranti, and Kjellin, is worked 
on the inductive principle, and consists of an anmilar or helical 
channel in a refractor}^ l)ase, filled with a conducting or semiconduct- 
ing medium, which constitutes the furnace charge, and has a heavy 
current induced in it l)y a surrounding coil of many turns, carry- 
ing an alternating current. The device, in point of fact, acts as the 
closed circuit secondary of a step-down transformer, and is said to 
be admirably adapt*^! foi- the fusing of such metals as platiiuun, 
which, if exposed to the atmosphere during the |)r()cess, as in the 
ordinary type of furnace, occlude ox3'gen and other gases in their 
mass, which lead subseijuently to blowholes and other imperfections 
in the casting. The Kjellin furnace princi})le has recently been 
applied to the manufacture of steel at Gj^singe, Sweden, with great 
success.

THE ELECTEIC FUKNACE. 



The experience of late years in the construction and use of electric 
furnaces trends toward the establishment of the resistance furnace as 
a t} pe more readil}- capa])le of efficient reg'ulation. This is further 
accentuated by the fact that overheating is, to a considerable extent, 
possible, and, indeed, prevalent in many types of furnace, especially 
those of the ai'c variety. Scientists and others unversed in the possi- 
bilities of the electric furnace as a source of artilicial heat hailed its 
introduction with delight as a means of overcoming many of the diffi- 
culties previoush' imposed l)y the limitations of temperature. In so 
doing they in man}' cases overlooked the very simple fact that it is 
possible to have too much of a good thing, and the consequent tend- 
ency was to overrate rather than underrate the temperature required 
for various commercial processes. 

Experience, however, has exposed this fallacy, and as a natural result 
w^e turn to that type of furnace which otters the best means of regula- 
tion and the absence of excessive variation, viz, the resistance furnace. 

Here again we are beset with fur- 
ther difficulties, for if we emplo}' 
a portion of the charge itself as a 
high-resistance column, excessive 
variations creep in, ownng to the 
changeable nature of the column 
with the reactions taking place 
within it, whereas if we employ a 
detinitecoreof small cross section, 
as in the Borchevs class, the capac- 
ity of the furnace is limited, and 
the cost of its upkeep is increased 
by the very necessary and frequent renewal of the conducting rods. 
With a view to minimizing these various draw])acks, Mr. H. I. 
Irvine, of Niagara Falls, has brought out a resistance furnace in Avhich 
the heated column consists of a fused electrolyte, n)aintained in a state 
of fusion by the passage of the current and comnmnicating its heat by 
radiation and diffusion to the encircling charge which is packed 
around it. 

The general construction of this furnace, which was mainly designed 
for the manufacture of ])hosphorus, is represented in tig. K!. It con- 
sists of a refractory structure F, lined with carbon C, and fitted with a 
domed roof R, in the center of Avhich is a hopper H. Two vertical 
car>)on electrodes B B descend vertically through R to within a short 
distance of the hearth, whilst a possible variation in the direction of 
the heating effect is provided b}^ lateral electrodes h h, connected with 
the hearth itself. The action of the furnace is tirst started through a 
mass of coke K, which forms a bridge between the electrodes B B, and 
is subsequently maintained by the fused slag from the furnace charge

which Hows down ])etween the electrodes and is maintained at constant 
leA'el l)y the overflow ontlets o o. 

As pointed out 1)y Mr. Carl Hering-, the lire brick or other refrac- 
tory lining- of all furnaces when heated becomes a conductor after the 
manner of a Nernst lamp glower. Though unavoidable, this is a con- 
tingency which, with furnaces of the resistance type at least, must be 
taken into account, in that it increases the total conductivity of the 
device and necessitates a corresponding increase in the working cur- 
rent. He further points out that the heat thus conmuuiicated is not 
lost, except in a small degree, consequent upon the decrease in the 
thickness of the nonconducting walls and the diminution of their heat- 
conserving qualities. 

Equally important with the selection of an easily regulated and com- 
paratively invariable electric furnace, ranks the question of tempera- 
ture determination. At the enormous temperatures developed in the 
electric furnace all previously known methods of temperature measure- 
ment, whether by thermometer or pyrometer, desert us, in that the 
constituent parts of these various apparatuses will not stand the direct 
application of such terrific heat. Here again stern necessity has been 
the means of inspiring investigators to action, with a view to discov- 
ering some efficient method for the measurement or comparison of 
these high temperatures. 

Fery's suggested method for determining the high temperatures 
usually encountered in electric furnaces consists in a practical applica- 
tion of Stefan's law, which is to the effect that the radiation of an 
absolutely black body is proportional to the fourth power of its abso- 
lute temperature. Kirchoff' has proved that the interior of an inclosure 
of which the walls are at a uniform temperature is equivalent to an 
"absolutely Idack l)()dy," i. e., a l)ody which absorbs all the heat 
imparted to it, giving it out again bj' radiation, and not l)y reflection. 
In this connection, therefore, the interior wall of an electric or other 
inclosed furnace may be regarded as an absolutely black body, a small 
aperture in wdiich docs not materially aft'ect the conditions governing 
this definition. 

Fery\s practical application of this law to the measurement of fur- 
nace temperatures consists in a species of telescope with a fluorspar 
objective. This telescope is placed in line with the aperture in the fur- 
nace wall, and, receiving the heat radiated therefrom, concentrates it 
upon a small thermo-couple. By an inner diaphragm, regulating the 
number of rays which reach the thermo-couple, the device is rendered 
independent of its distance from tlie furnace wall. The fluorspar 
objective, by its absorption of radiant heat, reduces the sensitiveness 
of the arrangement by about 10 per cent; l)ut, notwithstanding this, it 
has proved of extreme utility, owing to its enormous range and its 
applical)ility in such cases as those with which we are dealing at the 



310 THE ELECTEIC BDENACE. 

present moment, where other generalU^ accepted methods are out of 
the question. The actual temperature is, of course, obtained from a 
specially prepared table or curve, and is read from the electro-motive 
force recorded by the thermo-couple. 

Another, somewhat crude, method of measuring furnace tempera- 
tures, into which the personal element is liable to enter, causing an 
error of judgment, consists in a telescope, as before, mounted on a 
convenient stand and placed in line with a small aperture in the furnace 
wall. Inside the tube of the telescope is located a small incandescent 
lamp, which can be energized by one or two battery cells, and the 
current through it, and an ammeter placed in series with it, regulated 
by a suitable switch and rheostat. The principle upon which its action 
depends is that which involves the apparent disappearance of the 
tilament when raised to the same degree of incandescence as the fur- 
nace lining and viewed against the latter as a background. If the 
lamp be inactive, the iilament appears as a black line; at equal incan- 
descence it becomes invisible, while if its state of incandescence be 
above that of the furnace it assumes the appearance of a white line. 
By regulating, therefore, the current through the lamp until the tila- 
ment apparently disappears, its temperature is made equivalent to that 
of the furnace, and the result is read on a specially prepared table. 
The limit of the apparatus is 3,600° F., so that for electric-furnace 
work its field of utility is somewhat limited. 

In the preceding paragraphs the writer has l)y no means covered the 
entire field of development of the electric furnace, but has confined 
himself to a brief description of those examples which serve as a 
general type of the class to which they, respectively, belong. The 
subject is a large one, and its comprehensive study would till a volume 
of no mean dimensions, while its importance from a chemical and 
metallurgical point of view must not be underrated. 

At the end of the yenv 1900 the power used in electric furnaces was 
estimated at 225,000 horsepower, of which 185,000 horsepower were 
employed in the manufacture of calcium carbide, 27,000 horsepower 
in the manufacture of alumiiuim, 11,000 horsepower in that of copper, 
while carborundum was responsible for the output of some 2,000 
horsepower. Any gain, therefore, in the construction or working of 
electric furnaces, however slight, or apparently worthless, provides 
food for serious reflection, in that it ma}' he tlie means of saving large 
sums of money annually. 



HIGH-SPEED ELECTRIC INTERURBAN RAILWAYS/' 



By George H. Gibson. 



The electric railway is to perform a service for mankind as notable 
and perhaps ultimatel}^ as great as that rendered by its steam-operated 
precursor. Already it handles the bulk of suburban and short-distance 
interurban passenger traffic; it carries freight, mail, express, and bag- 
gage; it operates at speeds reaching 60 miles per hour; its cars are 
operated on time schedules and dispatched by telephone; its roadbed 
is often as expensive and heavy of construction as that of the best steam 
lines; and, what is more interesting to the investor, it pays large -divi- 
dends. At the present time $1,600,000,000 are nominally invested in 
electric roads in the United States and upon this sum $7,000,000 are 
paid in yearly dividends; 300,000 employees receive yearly in wages 
$250,000,000, and there are 20,000 miles of track on which 60,000 cars 
are run. In 1890, 10 miles of electric road were built for evevy mile 
of steam road constructed. 

The greatest development of interurban roads has taken place in the 
great agricultural districts of the Middle Western States, where they 
have grown to a truly surprising extent. It is often said that electric 
railways have checked the concentration of population in great cities 
by creating suburban districts, but in the farming regions they have 
had a still greater effect in building up many small centers of popula- 
tion. The Union Traction Company, of Indiana, operates 109 miles of 
interurban track and 51: miles of city track in the gas belt of that State 
and serves a population of 350,000. It connects the cities of Ander- 
son, Marion, Muncie, Indianapolis, and about 20 smaller towns, and 
traverses 6 of the most prosperous counties of the State. The interur- 
ban lines are located almost entirel}^ cu private right of way, protected 
by fences and cattle guards. Tests have shown that a maximum speed 
of 58 miles an hour may be reached and an average speed of 45 miles 
an hour maintained. Cars are run in each direction every hour, and 
special cars are furnished for theater parties, excursions, and picnics. 
The rates of fare are approximately 1 cent a mile. The dailv receipts 
of the interurban lines are said to be $3,000 on an average, but this is 
frequently increased to $8,000, and on one occasion was $11,000 in a

single dii3'. Large additions are contemplated — about doubling the 
present mileage. Power is generated in a central station at Anderson, 
containing three 1,000-kilowatt Westinghouse alternators, and is trans- 
mitted by 3-phase alternating current at 14,000 volts to 8 substations, 
which are supplemented l\y storage 1)atteries. 

One of the greatest possi])ilities of the interurljan road lies in the 
development of freight traffic. It is well fitted for the transfer of 
farm produce and supplies for farmers and for carrying package 
merchandise, and it can often give great convenience of delivery and 
the possibility of handling freight economicall}^ especially in small 
cities. The Chicago, Harvard and Lake Geneva Railway has not only 
a large freight traffic of its own, l)ut carries on an interchange of busi- 
ness with steam roads to a greater extent perhaps than an}^ other 
electric road in the United States. Its southern terminus is at Har- 
vard, on the Chicago and Northwestern Railway, and at Walworth, 
8i miles north of this place, the road crosses the Chicago, Milwau- 
kee and St. Paul Railway, thence running 2 miles northeast to Lake 
Geneva, one of Wisconsin's most popular summer resorts. One-third 
of the business of the road is in handling freight. Freight cars from 
the railroads are hauled to sidings on the electric road at a fiat rate of 
$5 per car, and piece freight is transported on a one-rate plan between 
any two points on the road for 5 cents per 100 pounds, no package 
being handled for less than 10 cents. A freight motar car with a crew 
of 2 men carries package freight and hauls from 1 to 4 jjteam-road 
freight cars. There are 6 freight sidings along the road, not including 
the company's yards. Live-stock shipments are an important part of 
the business. In summer refrigerator cars are run twice a week over 
the Chicago and Northwestern Railway for the benefit of creameries 
situated on the electric road, and last wintei- 3,000 tons of ice were 
hauled from Lake Geneva for local use along the line. The company 
receives $500 per jquy for hauling mail two trips daily each way. 
Passenger tickets are sold by the electric road to points on the steam 
roads and baggage is carried free. The power house is located at 
Murray and contains two generators of 500 kilowatts each. The 
equipment consists 10 motor cars and 6 trail cars. The maximum 
speed is 45 miles per hour. 

While many electric roads have been constructed cheaply and of 
light materials, the tendency is more and more toward a substantial 
type of construction similar to the best steam-railwa}^ practice. The 
Grand Rapids, Gralid Haven and Muskegon Railway, recently com- 
pleted, is equipped with standard 70- pound T-rails laid on a private 
right of way. The road runs from Grand Rapids to Muskegon, Mich., 
a distance of 35 miles, with a branch 7 miles long to Grand Haven. 
It piirallels steam roads to both cities, the running time of the electric 
and steam cars being about the same. The country is ,well developed 



HIGH-SPEED ELECTRIC INTERUEBAN RAILWAYS. 313 

industrially, containing tin-plate and paper mills, knitting- factories, 
and machine shops. Grand Rapids has a population of 96,000, Muske- 
gon 26,000, and Grand Haven 5,000. The country near Grand Haven 
is largely occupied as a summer resort by people from Grand Rapids, 
Chicago, and Milwaukee. In passing through towns and cities the 
road uses the overhead-trolley system, for which the cars are equipped 
with a trolley arm, while upon the inclosed right of way through the 
country the third-rail system is employed. The third rail is discon- 
tinued at crossings, the current being carried under the highways by 
conductors imbedded in pitch in underground conduits. The conductor 
rail is of 65-pound section and standard composition, and is supported 
upon reconstructed granite insulators. The power house, located at 
Fruitport, contains five 250-kilowatt generators, three of which are 
double-current machines, generating both direct and alternating cur- 
rents, while two are standard alternators. All arc direct-connected to 
Westinghouse vertical compound engines and are arranged for opera- 
tion in multiple. 

Another interesting road running out from Grand Rapids is the 
Grand Rapids, Holland and Lake Michigan Rapid Railway, extending 
from Grand Rapids to Holland and there connecting with two short 
lines to the lake shore. This road traverses a rich farming country, 
thickly settled by Dutch and Germans, and the two lines to the lake 
shore reach a favorite summer- resort district. The aggregate length 
of track of the combined roads is 71 miles, the total distance covered 
being 15 miles, 19 miles of this comprising the two roads running 
from Holland to the lake. * * * 

While electric roads are approaching steam lines in t\'pe of con- 
struction and methods of operation, many of the latter are finding it 
advantageous to adopt electric traction, especially for short-haul and 
suburban service. The Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway 
has in this way within two years increased its total yearly capacity 
and receipts from $11,221 to $73,292. The overhead trolley is used, 
and the cars are equipped with two 50-horsepower motors and air 
brakes and are capable of running 15 miles per hour. The total cost 
of the electrical installation for 30 miles of track, including 6 double- 
truck cars and a 600-kilowatt alternating-current generating station, 
was $169,375. On Sundays and holidays the road is used so exten- 
sivch' that its resources arc f ull}^ taxed, and it has been found neces- 
sary to increase the rolling stock so that, in addition to the regular 
cars, specials ma}' be run at ten and fifteen minute intervals. It will 
further be necessar}' to construct a double track between Quebec and 
Montmorency. In addition to the electric traffic, steam, freight, and 
special pilgrimage trains are constantly handled, and no collision or 
other accident has so far occurred. 



314 HIGH-SPEED ELECTEIC INTERUEBAN RAILWAYS. 

Another road which has greatly improved its service b}^ adopting 
electric traction is the Butt'alo and Lockport Railway. The company 
operating this road was organized in April, 1S9S, and leased for ninety- 
nine years the Lockport Branch of the Erie Railroad, running from 
Lockport to North Tonawanda, N. Y., and comprising 13i miles of 
single track. It has since bought 5i miles of road in the streets of 
Lockport, 7i miles of single track between Buffalo and North Tona- 
wanda, and a mile of track in Buffalo, making the total length of the 
line at present 29 miles and giving through service from Buffalo to 
Lockport and Niagara Falls. Power is obtained from the Niagara 
Falls Power Company, and is transmitted at 10,500 volts to a rotary 
converter substation located at Lockport, from which it is fed as 
direct current at 1,600 volts to the trolley wires. * * * 

A number of roads used chiefly for pleasure riding have been built 
in southern California, in the neighborhood of Los Angeles. The 
population is composed largely of wealthy people, who have sought 
that part of the country on account of climatic conditions and who 
patronize the roads liberally. One of the roads from Los Angeles 
extends to Pasadena, and from there to Echo Mountain and Mount 
Lowe. Another line runs from Los Angeles to Santa INIonica, on the 
Pacific Ocean. The Los Angeles-Pasadena line was so well patronized 
the first 3"ear that it was necessary to double-track the road. It com- 
petes with three steam lines, and one of the latter has been compelled 
to reduce its tiain service 1)V half, and would reduce it still further 
if that were not prevented by its franchise. The cars on the Pasadena 
line are each equipped with two lO-horsepower motors and Standard 
air brakes, and make a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour. The 
road to Santa Monica has quadruple equipments of 50-horsepower 
motors and can maintain a speed of 10 miles per hour. .Vnother road 
which is being built from Los Angeles 20 miles to Long Beach will 
have as one of its features a ))road boulevard, 181 feet wide, on each 
side of the track. 

Perhaps the tield of greatest activity in the United States for the 
construction of high-speed interurban lines has 1)een in northern Ohio 
and southern Michigan, where there is now a network of highly 
equipped roads upon which through traffic is being established, offer- 
ing even such accommodations as parlor and sleeping cars. It is said 
that a service of this character will shortly be established between 
Columbus and Cincinnati. The roads utilized will be the Southern 
Traction Company's lines from Cincinnati to Dayton; the Dayton- 
Springfield and Ur])ana to Springfield; and the Columbus, London 
and Springfield to Columbus, the t^ervice to be established as soon as 
the latter road is completed. The schedule time between Columbus 
and Cincinnati will be about six hours. It is also proposed to operate 
through cars between Cleveland and Cincinnati, the route from Cleve- 



HIGH-SPEED ELECTRIC INTERURBAlSr RAILWAYS. 315 

land l)eing- over the Cleveland, Elyria and Western, the Cleveland, 
Ashland and Manslield, the Mansfield, (Talion and Crestline, and the 
Columljus, Delaware and Marion, roads all either in operation or 
under construction. 

A few notes regarding the Cleveland, Elyria and Western may be of 
interest, since its power house will be the first railway power station 
in the United States to be equipped with steam turbines. Two West- 
ino'liouse turbines, running' at 1,500 revolutions per minute, are to ])e 
direct-connected to two 1,000 kilowatt, 2-pole generators, delivering 
alternating current at -lOO volts and 25 cj'^cles per second. Steam will 
be supplied to the turbines at 150-pounds pressure and 200-degrees 
superheat, and the exhaust will be under a 28-inch vacuum. The 
steam consumption is guaranteed not to exceed 10. S pounds of steam 
per horsepower-hour; and at one-half load the steam consumption per 
horsepower is not to increase more than 15 per cent. Tliese turbines 
are somewhat novel in construction in that the steam is expanded con- 
secutively in two chambers — that is, the steam first passes through a 
high-pressure cjdinder, then through a reheater, and finally through 
a low-pressure cylinder. The rotating parts of both the high and 
low pressure cylinders are upon one shaft, the bearing being placed 
betw^een the two cylinders. Full load may be carried without super- 
heat or vacuum. The adoption of steam turbines has increased the 
possible capacity with the space availalde in the existing powerhouse 
from 2,000 to 5,000 kilowatts. Two 300-kilowatt rotary converters are 
being installed as connecting links between the present direct-current 
plant and the alternating-current apparatus. The power is ti"ansmitted 
to substations along the road by alternating current at 20,000 volts. 

Cleveland is the center of an extensive interurban electric-railway 
system, extending in one direction nearly to Buffalo, N. Y., and in the 
other to Toledo, Ohio, which is also the terminus of a large number 
of roads. One of the roads connecting Cleveland and Toledo is the 
.Toledo, Fremont and Norwalk, about CO miles in length and controlled 
by the Lake Shore Electric Compan}-. The powerhouse at Fremont, 
about the middle of the line, contains four alternating-current gen- 
erators, direct-connected to l,T50-horsepower Westinghouse steam 
engines. Current is transmitted at 16,000 volts to six substations, 
which are combined with passenger and freight stations in order to 
cut down the cost of attendance. The high-tension transmission wires 
are carried upon the poles supporting the trolly brackets. The road- 
bed, partly upon private right of way and partly upon public turnpike, 
is constructed for speeds exceeding 10 miles per hour. In preparing 
for a through service between Cleveland and Toledo, a series of experi- 
ments are being made by the Lake Shore Electric Company with a 
view of determining the most desirable motors for the traffic. A 
cross-country schedule of 35 to 10 miles per hour has been established 



316 HIGH-SPEED ELECTRIC INTERURBAN RAILWAYS. 

and a speed of over 60 miles per hour has been maintained for short 
distances. Some of the cars are fitted with four lOO-horsepower elec- 
tric motors. The cars now in service on the Toledo, Fremont and 
Norwalk are equipped with 75-horsepower Westing-house motors. 
That part of the Lake Shore Electric Company's line between Cleve- 
land and Norwalk is entirel}^ on private right of way and is rock bal- 
lasted and laid with T5-pound T-rails. This company is making an 
especial effort to develop freight traffic in fruit and dairj^ products. 
Passenger mileage books are sold for $13.50 per 1,000 miles, and local 
fares are about one-half of those charged by steam roads. 

Toledo and Detroit are connected b}^ a series of electric roads, one 
of the most completel}" equipped of which is the Toledo and Monroe 
Railway, having 18 miles of single track laid with 70-pound T-rails 
and ballasted with broken limestone. The equipment consists of ordi- 
nary passenger cars, chair cars, combined passenger and l)aggage cars, 
and freight cars. The passenger cars are 40 feet long and a regular 
schedule speed of 30 miles per hour, including stops, is maintained. 
The powerhouse contains two lOO-kilowatt Westinghouse 3-phase 
alternators, and a substation contains a 200-kilowatt rotary converter. 
The long distance transmission is at 15,000 volts, the wires being car- 
ried on 45-foot pine poles set 6 feet in the ground and surrounded by 
concrete, so that no guy wires are necessary. The same poles support 
the double trolley wire. 

One of the oldest high-speed roads in America is the Detroit, Ypsil- 
anti and Ann Arbor Railway. As originally constructed this road had 
a length of 50 miles. 40 miles between Detroit and Ann Arbor, with a 
branch line of 10 miles to Saline. The line has recenth' been consider- 
ably extended, now reaching to Jackson, Mich., where it connects 
with other interurban roads. It is composed of single track through- 
out. The equipment consists of 20 cars, each provided with four 
50-horsepower motors and quick-acting air brakes. The motors can 
all be thrown in series for slow speed through cities. A regular half- 
hour service is maintained, with an occasional fifteen-minute service, 
and all cars are dispatched by telephone, telephone stations being 
located at turn-outs. The most remarkable effect of this i-oad has 
been the development of an enormous passenger tratfic. During the 
first 3^ear 4,000 passengers were carried per day, against 200 previ- 
ously carried per day by the steam road passing through the same 
towns. The fare for 40 miles is 50 cents, while the fare charged by the 
steam roads for the same distance is $1.12. A 1,000-mile mileage book 
is sold for 1 cent per mile. The average fare per passenger is 15.9 
cents. Many houses are being built in the small towns along the 
route and market gardening is rapidly developing in the country trav- 
ersed. Freight service is given twice a day and express packages are

carried in the bagg-ag-e compartments of the passenger cars. When 
the line was first opened, more freight was offered than could be car- 
ried, although the rates were two-thirds more than those asked by the 
steam-railroad company. 

Extending north from Detroit 73 miles to Port Huron, Mich., and 
comprising in all 110 miles of single track exclusive of sidings, are the 
lines of the Rapid Railway Compan}^ another early pioneer in the elec- 
tric interurban railway field. This road is an excellent illustration of 
the great advances in the building of electric roads made possible by 
high-tension power transmission. All power is generated at a main 
station at New Baltimore and transmitted in either direction by alter- 
nating currents at 16,. 500 volts. The power house is equipped with all 
the latest improvements in the way of coal and ash handling machin- 
ery, mechanical draft, economizei*S, etc., and contains three 1,000- 
horsepower Westinghouse steam engines, all direct-connected to 
3-phase generators. There are five rotary-converter substations — 
two north of, two south of, and one at the power house. This rail- 
way passes through a rich agricultural country and at its middle part 
through a noted summer-resort district, which is rapidly being built 
up in consequence of the transportation facilities furnished by the elec- 
tric line. About the same fares are charged as upon the Detroit, Ypsi- 
lanti and Ann Arbor road, and arrangements have been made for an 
extensive freight traffic in fruit, fish, vegetables, groceries, and gen- 
eral merchandise. It is said that 50 per cent of the lighter trade going 
to Detroit is now carried by the electric road. The cars are run on 
train dispatchers' orders, telephone stations being placed at all sidings. 
After leaving the city limits of Detroit there are no grade crossings, 
and the track is thoroughl}^ well laid and ballasted. One of the branches 
of the road closely follows the shore of Lake St. Clair, and the north- 
ern part of the road follows the St. Clair River, passing through 
many fishing, hunting, and boating resorts. Hourly service is given 
regularly over the whole line, and cars are operated at shorter intervals 
between points where traffic is dense. The schedule time for the cars 
is 27 miles per hour, including stops, and between stations the speed 
reaches 15 miles per hour. * * * 

In the State of Michigan there arc 21 interurban lines actual!}" in 
operation, and franchises have been asked for 17 more. The great 
activity in bidlding electric roads in this territory is due, perhaps more 
than to anything else, to the fact that it was here that a number of the 
eai'liest and most successful roads in the country were constructed, thus 
bringing the possibilities of electric traction before the eyes of ])usiness 
men and capitalists. 

While the Middle West has l)een the scene of the most active electric 
railway building in the United States, considerable progress has been 



318 HIGH-RPEED ELECTRIC INTERURBAN RAILWAYS. 

made in .some of the more thickly populated Eastern States. At Hud- 
son, N. y., ])eg'ins a long- electric railway system which extends a dis- 
tance of 105 miles to Wari-ensburg, near Lake George, running for a 
great part of the way along the Hudson and through a semimountain- 
ous country and giving a view of the Catskills and the Berkshire Hills. 
The first 37 miles is covered by the Albany and Hudson liailway, a 
small part of which is operated by trolle}^ and the remainder l)y the 
third-rail system. Except through city streets, the company owns its 
own right of way, which is fenced in and laid in a very su'))stantial 
manner. Both running and conductor rails are of T section and weigh 
80 pounds to the .yard, the third rail being somewhat lower in carl>on 
than the service rails in order to reduce the electrical resistance. The 
track has been heavily ballasted and the ties are laid 2 feet center to 
center, evGvy fifth tic being extended to support the third-rail insulat- 
ors. The latter are supported C inches above the tie and are made of 
wooden blocks, topped by malleable cast-iron caps or chairs. At all 
highway's and farm crossings the third rail is interrupted, Ijut the con- 
tinuity of the circuit is not broken. Power is supplied from a 
h3^draulic plant at Stuyvesant Falls, on Kinderhook Creek, about 10 
miles north of Hudson, and is transmitted by 3-phase current at 
12,000 volts to three substations along the line, where it is transformed 
to direct current at 600 volts. * * * 

In view of the high-speed experiments with 3-phase motors that have 
recently been carried on in Germany, it is gratifying to note that sim- 
ilar experiments with direct-current motors are shortly to be made in 
America. The Aurora, Elgin and Chicago liailway has been designed 
for a continuous maxinuim speed of 70 miles per hour, and the track 
is of such substantial character and easy alignment that higher speeds 
can be attained. The service rails are to weigh 80 pounds to the yard, 
the track is to be rock ballasted, and all In'idges will be of concrete 
and steel construction. The third rail is to weigh 100 pounds to the 
yard and is to be supplied with direct current from substations, to 
which power will be transmitted at 26,000 volts by 3-phase alternating 
current over aluminum feeders. The schedule speed will be 40 miles 
per hour, including stops at stations 3 miles apart. Cars are to weigh 
40 tons, and are to run at a maximum speed of 65 miles per hour, 
with a possible 70 miles per hour on a level track and with normal 
voltage on the third rail. The cars are to be operated either singly 
or in trains and are to be equipped by the General Electric Company. 

This paper might seem unduly partial if no mention were made of 
European roads. However, of high-speed interurban roads in Europe 
there are extremely few. In Great Britain it can truthfully be said 
there are no high-speed electric roads at all. The difference between 
America and Europe with respect to the development of electric trac- 
tion is very strikingly shown by the following figures: The miles of 



HIGH-SPEED ELECTRIC INTEEURBAN RAILWAYS. 319 

electrically operated railways are, in the whole world outside of the 
United States, 4.6i per million people; in Germany, the highest of 
continental countries, 41.8 miles; and in the United States, 276.2 
miles. It is said that the new plant of the Manhattan Elevated Rail- 
way Company, of New Tork City, which will have a total power of 
40, 000 kilowatts, equals in capacity the total electric power available 
for traction purposes in France. The United States has 70 per cent 
of all the electricit}" availalde in the world for traction, 7<>^ per cent 
of the electric-railwa}^ mileage, and 88^ per cent of all the trolley cars. 

A German steam road upon which electric traction has been tried 
is the Wannsee line, between Berlin and Zehlendorf. Since August, 
1900, an electric train has lieen interspersed in the regular service, a 
speed of about 25 miles per hour 1>eing maintained. Tlie train weighs 
193 tons empty and 220 tons loaded, and is composed of ten coaches, 
the first and last having tlu-ee motors each, of an aggregate capacity 
of 975 horsepower. It runs 225 miles per day, the maximum speed 
being 31 miles per hour. Direct current is used at 750 volts. The 
efficiency of the power transmission between switchboard and axle 
was found to l)e from 70 per cent to 85 per cent. The Government 
railroad authorities have decided to discontinue the electric service, 
but the failure of the road has been due more to half-hearted meas- 
ures than to any defect in the system. 

The first installation of a high-speed electric road in Europe was 
between Diisseldorf and Krefeld, a total distance of 13. «> miles, the 
longest stretch between stopping places being 10.4 miles. Since the 
road parallels the steam railway for the greater part of its length, it 
is considered necessary to maintain a speed of 25 miles per hour on 
the open stretches. A speed of 37.2 miles per hour has 1)een reached 
on trial trips. (Pi. iv.) The road does not pass through the inter- 
vening towns, but only touches the outskirts. It it double-tracked 
from Diisseldorf to Oberkassel, the terminus of the Diisseldorf local 
traffic. Direct current is used at 000 volts pressure, and the cais are 
mounted upon doul)le trucks, each truck carrj'ing a 40-liorsepower 
motor. The passengers are divided into three classes, the total seating 
capacity of a car being 84. Three kinds of brakes are used — viz. , hand 
brakes, electric short-circuit brakes, and Standard air-brakes — and each 
motor car is also equipped with two trolley poles. Trains leave each 
terminal station every half hour. The road has developed a quite 
considerable freight and farm service. 

A road which has attracted considerable attention by its novel and 
unique features is the suspended railway at Elberfeld-Barmen, where 
the cars are hung from a single rail without any side guards or sup- 
ports, so that in going around curves the cars may assume an inclined 
position. (PI. V, tig. 1.) Of the 8 miles originally plann<'d, only 4i 



320 HIGH-SPEED ELECTRIC INTERUKBAN RAILWAYS. 

have been built. The speed of the cars is from 12i to 14 miles per 
hour. The switching construction is highly interesting, but is not con- 
sidered safe and is used only by empty cars. 

The Swiss " roads are very interesting because of the original engi- 
neering methods which they embody. Most of them are mountain 
roads and are provided with rack rails. They are largely patronized 
b}^ tourists and charge very high fares. The road starting at Zermatt 
and ascending the Gornergrat has a maximum grade of 20 per cent 
and is composed of curves throughout 30 per cent of its total length, 
which is 5.7 miles. The entire roadbed was cut from solid rock or 
bidlt upon projections. The rack system is of the Abt type. The 
locomotives weigh 10^ tons each and are equipped with two motors 
having an aggregate of 90 horsepower and operating at 500 volts. 
(PI. V, fig. 2.) The speed is only -li miles per hour, and double- 
reduction gearing is used. In addition to the two spindle brakes, one 
operated on the rack wheels and the other on the surface wheels, there 
is an electric brake which comes into action as soon as the speed of 4^ 
miles per hour is exceeded. The motors are of the 3-phase induction 
type with wound rotors and collector rings, and in coasting they may 
be used as extra brakes by inserting resistance in the rotor circuit. 

The longest (25 miles) Swiss 3-phase railway is the Burgdorf-Thun 
road, opened in 1899. The standard trains weigh 56 tons and have a 
maximum speed of 22^ miles per hour. Current is transmitted at 
1(),000 volts, which is stepped down, by means of transformers located 
at an average of 2 miles apart, to 750 volts for distribution to the 
trolley line. The caivs carry four trolleys, two at each end of the car. 
The equipment consists of two 2-axle locomotives and six d-axle motor 
cars, with a number of trailers for passenger and freight traffic. The 
total power of the locomotives is 300 horsepower. A small trans- 
former is installed on each locomotive or motor car for lighting, heat- 
ing, and driving an air compressor, Westinghouse air brakes being 
used. At present only five trains are operated on the line at any 
time. The fare for the entire 25 miles is -40 and 60 cents for the two 
classes. 

The Stansstad-Engelberg Electric Railway has a total length of 13.8 
miles, of which about 1 mile is rack construction. Three-phase cur- 
rent is supplied to the trolley line at 750 volts, at which voltage most 
of it is generated. The trolley line is protected l>y Westinghouse 
lightning arresters. The rolling stock consists of three locomotives 
and seven motor cars weighing l-l tons and seating 46 persons. (PI. v, 
fig- 3.)

Perhaps the most remarkable of the Swiss railways is the Jungfrau 
line, which runs for 1^ miles alono- the base of the mountain and then 
ascends by means of a tunnel (j^r miles lon^" to an altitude of 13,435 
feet. After leaving the terminal station, the passengers are raised a 
further 210 feet by an elevator. The grade is 25 per cent along the 
entire road, with the exception of a 2.2-mile section which has 07 per 
cent grade. The rolling stock consists of live locomotives, ten pas- 
senger cars, and two freight cars. The locomotives in reality form the 
rear truck of the cars, but can only be used without the latter. Three 
independent brakes insure safet}^ during the descent. The locomo- 
tives are equipped with two 3-phase motors, having a normal capacity 
of 25 horsepower each, and the speed is l:f miles. The forward motor 
is coupled to a continuous-current dynamo, which serves to exite both 
motors during the descent, thus turning them into generators. There 
are but few days when the sunnnit presents a clear view of the sur- 
rounding territor3% and the traffic is therefore concentrated in a very 
short time, when the rush is very great, and at such time eight trains 
per da}' operate. * * *

THE MAKIENFELDE-Z0S8P:N HIGH-SPEED ELECTRIC 
RAILWAY TRIALS/' 



By Dr. Alfked Gkadexwitz. 



The Marienfelde-Zossen high-speed electric-railway trials, as is 
known, were undertaken with a view to obtaining the necessary tech- 
nical and economical data for a regular electric-railway service up to 
speeds as high as 200 kilometers per hour. Useful data were available 
from previous trials made by the Siemens & Halske Company on their 
special experimental line in Gross-Lichterfelde, near Berlin, which 
line was intended to be a model railwaj- for operation by 10,000-volt 
currents. It is due mainl}^ to the enterprise of the two leading electric 
firms in Germany, the Siemens & Halske Company and the Allo-emeine 
Elektrizitilts Gesellschaft,'^ as well as to the assistance of the most 
important German banking firms and the authorities concerned, that 
as early as the fall of 1899 a special concern was formed under the 
name '"Studiengesellschaft fiir Elektrische Schnellbahnen." The 
German railway authorities placed at the disposal of the undertaking 
the Marienfelde-Zossen military railwa3% and two cars to be con- 
structed respectivel}^ by the firms mentioned above were to be used 
for the experiments. 

The Siemens & Halske Company undertook the construction of the 
line supplying the electric power, whereas the Allgemeine P^lektrizitats 
Gesellschaft were willing to generate the power in their Obor Schon- 
weide electricity works as well as to construct the feeding wires thence 
to Marienfelde-Zossen. The line was to be constructed after the 
model of the Gross-Lichterfelde experimental track, and the same 
arrangement of the conductors and collectors, as well as the same kind 
of current, namely, 10,000 volts rotary current between two con- 
ductors, was to be used. 

The Marienfelde-Zossen military line, 23 kilometers in length, 
seemed spocialW available, as there ar(> no curves of less than 2,000 
meters radius, the short gradients being not more than 1 : 200. The 
permanent way, however, corresponded only with the older tj^pes of

Prussian railwa3's, consisting of light rails of 33.4 kilograms per 
meter (67 pounds per 3"ard), placed partly on wooden sleepers and 
partly on short iron sleepers, the roadbed consisting mainly of inferior 
material. Though it accordingly was anticipated at the very outset 
that the existing permanent wa}' would not be sufficiently resistant for 
maximum speeds as high as 200 kilometers per hour, it was decided 
to begin the trials without any rebuilding of the track, apart from 
some immaterial improvements. After the number of sleepers had 
been somewhat increased, and the roadbed reenforced with consider- 
able amounts of broken stone, the track stood perfectly well the strain 
involved by speeds up to 130 kilometers (80.8 miles) per hour. As, 
however, in connection with the experiments made in the fall of 1901, 
serious troubles were experienced for the maximum speeds of 140 to 
160 kilometers per hour, a thorough re))uilding of the track was 
eventually carried out in the course of the summer of 1902. The new 
rails have a weight of 42 kilograms per meter (about 84^ pounds per 
3'ard) and a length of 12 meters, being placed on 18 tir sleepers with 
hartl-wood pegs; 1.5,X)00 cubic meters broken l)asalt were vised for the 
roadl)ed. About IT kilometers of the track were fitted with guard 
rails such as used in connection with ordinary railways on bridges, etc. 
These g'uard rails, the foot of which is ,^() millimeters distant from the 
main rail, are fixed on cast-iron ))eds, screwed to every sleeper, this 
arrangement, in addition to preventing derailments, imparting an 
extraordinary strength to the whole of the roadbed. (Plate i.) 

The ovL'rhead Ihic. — The arrangement of the overhead line is shown 
in plates i and ii, the middle of the pole l)eing about 2i meters distant 
from the middle of the track and the three horizontal wires conduct- 
ing the 3-phase current being about 1 meter apart. The whole of 
the line is divided into sections of about 1 kilometer, each of which 
is provided in the middle with a device for compensating losses in 
pressure. The neutral point of the S3\stem is connected to the earth 
and to the rails. The suspension point moves aside somewhat as the 
collector presses against the horizontal wire, a satisfactory and simul- 
taneous contact between the three horizontal wires and the contact 
arcs being thus possible. This is insured l)y having the single parts 
on the outrigger, intended for carrying the insulators, connected by 
joints. The horizontal wires have a double insulation against earth, 
and each insulation separately is susceptible of standing the whole of 
the maximum pressure of 20,000 volts occurring during the service. 
The wires have cross sections of 100 square millimeters (0.155 square 
inch) each, the tension between each two wires varying between 10,000 
and 12,000 volts. Hard copper wire with a breaking strength as high 
as 38 kilograms per square millimeter and a conductivity more than 
97 per cent of that of chemically pure copper is used; lightning 
arresters are provided, as well as safety' devices in case of a fracture 
by which the wire is automatically earthed.

MARIENFELDE-ZOSSEN ELECTRIC-RAILWAY TRIALS. 325 

The collectors. — The collectors are constructed according to the sys- 
tem developed by the Siemens & Halske Company on their Gross- 
Lichterfelde experimental track; they are nearly identical on both 
cars, differing- only as to the details. In the Siemens car they have 
the form of two masts supported by the cars at either end and mov- 
a])le around their vertical axis. These masts consist of two Mannes- 
mann tubes, each about 200 millimeters in diameter, inserted one into 
the other. B}' lueans of a crank acting on a double-toothed gearing, 
any desired rotation of the masts may be effected from the motorman's 
stand. The sliding rings are attached to an insulated tube. Contact 
springs, screwed b}' means of hard-rubber insulators on a special flat 
iron frame, are flxed to the three sliding rings. Into the insulating- 
tubes and partly into the lower part of the collector, the upper tube is 
slipped, so as to be readil}" dismounted after loosening a few screws. 
This tube bears, at central distances of 1 meter each, three rotating 
axles for the contact bows proper. The wind pressure against the bow 
on one side of the rotating axle is balanced by means of a vane attached 
to the other side of the axle. The Allgemeine Elektrizitilts Gesell- 
schaft car is likewise fitted with two groups of three collectors each, 
one for each phase, which, however, instead of being placed on one 
common mast, are arranged one behind the other. Both arrangements 
have so far given full satisfaction, it being impossible to decide which 
is the more available. Sparking between the overhead wires and the 
collector bows, as occasionally noted in connection with the earlier 
experiments, was recently prevented by some slight improvements in 
the construction of the collectors. One of the most difficult problems, 
namelv, the transmission of high amounts of energy from a stationary 
conductor to a train running at enoi-mous speeds, has thus been satis- 
factorily solved. 

The motor car^. — The two motor cars used with these trials were 
constructed by Messrs. Van der Z,ypen & Charlier, Colognc-Deutz, in 
accordance with the electric apparatus supplied by the two electric 
firms. The cars, intended for about 50 passengers, are 21 and 22 
meters in length, respectivel}^, and correspond as to their dimensions 
and equipment with the technical regulations of the Association of 
German Railwa}" Administrations. The body of the car rests b}^ 
means of two center bolts on two trucks without any special springs. 
In addition there are on the frames of each truck four steps limiting 
the lateral oscillation of the body b}^ bearing part of the weight of the 
car. Lateral oscillations of the body were moreover observed only 
for lower speeds, up to 100 kilometers per hour, whereas with higher 
speeds the run of the cars was perfectly steady, much more so than 
with ordinary rapid trains. Each of the trucks is fitted with three 
axles, the external axles bearing the motor, whereas the central ones 
serve as runniny- axles. The distance between the axles was at the 



326 MARIENFELDE-ZOSSEN ELECTK1C-RA.ILWAY TRIALS, 

beginning 3.8 meters; this has been increased up to 5 meters in con- 
nection with the recent successful trials. The distance between the 
centers of each two trucks is 13.3 and 14.3 meters, respectively, and 
the diameter of the wheel tread 1.25 meters. Two springs are placed 
against the axle boxes, namely, one plate spring, 1..5 meters in length, 
abov^e each axle })ox, these plate springs ])eing in turn maintained at 
their ends by spiral springs, the tension of which is regulated by 
means of screws. As the trucks, in connection with the earlier exper- 
iments, followed au}^ deviation in the direction of the track, the dis- 
tance of the wheels, as above said, was increased to 5 meters, and the 
bearing springs placed so as to be visible and connected with one 
another by compensating levers. The center bolts, which formerly 
were rigidly fixed to the lower frame, were in the course of the recent 
reconstruction provided with lateral pegs fitted with springs, so as to 
pre\'ent any transmission of the oscillations of the body to the frame. 

The connections of the cars.-^Uhe, connections of the cars are shown 
in plate iii. In the AUgemeine Elektrizitats Gesellschaft car, the 
currcnit is led b}^ means of armored cables from the two groups of col- 
lectors to the main switch in tlie machine room and thence by separate 
conductors to the transformers. The main cut-out switch is operated 
only after the run is completed, or as an emergency switch in case of 
disturbances occurring during the run. From the transformers the 
low-tension conductors lead through the main controller to the motors. 
The main controller is also placed in the machine room of the car, 
being easily actuated from each driver's stand through a steering wheel 
connected by toothed gearing to an axle traversing the whole length 
of the car. This controller directs the working current to the motors 
and through the resistances, and permits forward and reverse running, 
besides providing for the braking of the car by means of reverse cur- 
rent. There is in addition a small controller in the driver's stand, 
conveying low-tensLon current from the transformer to the motor for 
operating the air compressor in connection with the compressed-air 
brake. 

The connections in the Siemens & Halske car are somewhat different, 
the high-tension current being first conveyed to one of the two main 
switches for forward and backward running, which may be controlled 
from the driver's stand, and thence to the two large transformers, 
whence the working current is again conveyed through individual 
switches toward the motors and the resistances. From the main con- 
ductors on the roof of the car, part of the current is in addition branched 
off toward the small transformer placed above the motorman's stand, 
and conveyed to the electric motor operating the two air pumps. Two 
special cranks are provided in the motorman's stand for actuating the 
reversing switch and the motor switch, respectively, the working re- 
sistances being controlled by the driver through a special controlling

wheel with or without the ag-eney of compressed air. These equip- 
ments have given satisfactory results with hoth carriages and proved 
very effective, affording- full protection against the electric current. 

Transformers. — The main characteristics of the transformers used 
in each of the cars are as follows: 

In the transformers of the Siemens & Halske car the effective iron 
sheets are placed vertically on their small edges and distributed in 
groups, l)etween which there is space for the passage of air. The 
secondary coil is well insulated from the iron cores, the coils of the 
primary winding being placed above it. In the ventilating channel 
of the iron cores there are protective boxes prolonged as far as the 
front plates of the casing and exuanding into the latter so as to facili- 
tate the drawing in of the air. 




SuspfiisidU of the motor on the All,L,'emeine Elektrizitiits-Gosellsehaft cur. 

Tlu; transformers in the Allgemeine Elektrizitats-Gesellschaf t car are 
designed, according to the patents of this company, with three parallel 
iron cores, the axes of which rui\ longitudinalh". Each iron core is 
provided with a longitudinal slot, through which, as well as between 
the rectangular cores and the round coil, an air current is allowed to 
pass. The transformers in both cars have given full satisfaction, the 
strong air currents proving particularly effective and pre^'enting any 
considerable heating effects. 

The motors.— T\\Q. motors of the Allgemeine Elektrizitats-Gesell- 
schaf t car are designed for an output of 250 horsepower each, provided 
with fork-bar coils. The exciting current has a tension of 435 volts. 
The motor cases are fixed on an iron frame supported on l)oth sides of 
the carriage by plate springs, each of which is lixed on tlie main ])ear- 
ing spring of the car. The motor casings each bear a hollow axle, 
SM 11H)3 22 



328 MARIENFELDE-ZOSSEN ELECTRIC-RAILWAY TRIALS. 

slipped over the car axle, on which the armature of the motor is built. 
The motor is coupled to the wheels of the corresponding axle by means 
of doul)le arms attached on both ends of the hollow axle and touching 
the sliding pieces placed on the wheels. The weight of the motor, 
instead of resting immediately on the axles of the car, is thus sup- 
ported ])y bearing springs on the axle boxes of the truck. 

The motors constructed by the Siemens & llalske Company on the 
other hand are ()-pole motors, also for outputs of 250 horsepower each, 
the energy current being conve3'ed to the rotor at a tension of 1,150 
volts b}' means of three sliding rings. The pressure in the secondary 
circuit at rest and at first starting is 650 volts. The rotor is provided 
with closed direct-current bar windings, whereas the stationary part 
of the motor has rotary-current bar windings. The rotor with its box 
is pressed strongl}^ on the axle of the car. The stationary part of the 
motor, inclosed by a double cast-iron casing, rests without any inter- 
mediate spring on the car-axle bearings. The diameter of the rotor is 
7<S0 millimeters, whereas the external diameter of the motoi' is 1,050 
millimeters. 

Both the direct fixing of the motors on the axles and the suspension 
by springs on the truck have giv^en full satisfaction in connection with 
the experiments so far made. In general, the spring suspension seems 
to be preferable to the rigid suspension of the motor. 

J-Cxeiters and resit^tanees.— The. exciters and resistances, necessary in 
starting and in controlling the speed, show also some essential difier- 
ences in the two carriages. In order to avoid any. abrupt variations 
in the speed and any excessive sparking in the car,* the resistances must 
be switched off from the circuit quite gradually. In the Allgemeine 
Elektrizitats Gesellschaft car there are to this efi'ect liquid resistances 
of the following construction: 

The terminal plates of the opened circuits are placed in two reser- 
voirs in th(; central machine room of the car. Beside each of the 
reservoirs thei-e is an electrically driven centrifugal ])ump, conveying 
into the upper reservoir a soda solution placed in a ])()x l)elow the 
carriage. The higher the liquid in the latter the smaller will bo the 
resistance ])etween the electrodes. The height of the licjuid is regulated 
from the driver's cab l)y means of a valve. The pumps work perma- 
nentl}^ during the run, the liquid circulating in a tube conduit insui-ing 
a permanent cooling (rcfi-igei'ation). This excitei- afloi'ds the advan- 
tage of dispensing with the contacis and cable joints necessary in con- 
nection with solid exciters. 

In the Siemens & llalske car, on the other hand, there are metallic 
resistances, formed of "Kruppine'"* bands 45 ))y 2 millimeters in section. 
These bands are placed by groups in flat boxes fitted outside on the 
lotigitudinal wall of the car, below the window. There are in all 29 
steps, four being intended for the Hrst inserting and 25 for increasing

and regulating the speed of the motors. Below the resistance boxes 
there are the exciter rollers placed long-itudiually and bearing bronze 
contact pieces; the corresponding contacts are attached to tv.o steel 
tubes placed one beside the other and isolated from them. In order 
to avoid any such disturbances as would attend on an a))rupt increase 
in collecting the current, the single contacts are inserted not simul- 
taneously but successively. The exciting rollers are actuated through 
a longitudinal spindle traversing the whole of the car, rotated from 
the driver's stand Ijy means of a conical toothed gearing. In order to 
facilitate the handling of this controlling device, there is a compressed- 
air apparatus assisting the driver in starting and reducing automaticall}' 
the exciter to its zero position if the current has to be switched oil'. 
By means of a special gearing the controlling may be eliected also 
without the aid of compressed air. 

The trlala. — In connection with the trials made in the course of the 
fall of 1901, speeds as high as 150 kilometers, and even in one case 160 
kih)meters, were obtained. As, however, rather material oscillations 
and shocks were experienced even at speeds of 110 kilometers per hour, 
no further increase of the speed was thought advisable for the moment, 
the remainder of the year being given up to veiy valual)le measure- 
ments and records on the consumption of electric energy. The 
acceleration obtained after starting was different according to the strain 
the source of power was put to and the performance of the motors. 
In order to attain speeds of 100 kilometers, starting distances of 2,000 
to 3,200 meters, and starting times ranging between 138 and 220 seconds 
were necessar}^ these figures corresponding- with a mean acceleration 
as high as 0.13 to 0.20 meters per second. As, however, the motors are 
capable of supplying for short intervals about 3,000 horsepower, 
whereas for the above acceleration only TOO to 1,000 horsepower are 
required, this represents b}^ no means, an upper limit. 

As regards the braking of the (uirs, ))oth cars maybe stopped either 
])y means of Westinghouse rapid brakes, hand brakes, or using back 
current; the Allgemeine P^lekti'izitilts (xesellschaft car is in addition 
fitted with an electric brake. The Westinghouse and electric brakes 
may be operated from each motorman's stand sinudtaneously, though 
the ))raking eciuipments are independent for either of the trucks. In 
the case of an aii- pressure as high as 6 atmospheres in the braking 
cylinder, two of which' are placinl on (»acli truck, the pressure on each 
of the 24 l>raking shoes arranged on both sides of the wheel is about 
0, »>(»(> kilograms, the l)raking shoes thus receiving a total pi'cssure as 
as high as 114,000 kilograms — 150 per cent of the weight of the 
Ciirriage. * * * 

After the trials made in the course of lOdl, a thorough rebuilding 
of the track, as above stated, was found necessar}-. This occupied 
part of the year l'J02, the remainder of wiiich w^as taken up in the 



330 MARIENFELDE-ZOSSEN ELECTRIC-RAILWAY TRIALS, 

continuation of the experiments on the consumption of energy, etc., 
for speeds up to 130 kilometers. The results of the improvements 
made last year were shown, in connection with the recent trials, to ))e 
most satisfactory and even surprising. The track not only stood easily 
the strain to which it was put by trials at ever increasing speeds, but 
the cars would now run with such safety and steadiness as to make the 
shocks of the rails nearl}^ unnoticeable. 

The Siemens car was first given a (,;hance to show its possi))ilities; 
after reaching speeds as high as 181) kilometers per hour at the end 
of September last, it was anticipated that resuming the experiments 
at the begiiniing of Octo])er would lead to the maximum speed of 200 
kilometei's being finally reached. This was actually the case on Octo- 
ber (), the event being watched by a great number of lookers-on. 
The distance l)etween Marienfelde and Zossen was repeatedly trav- 
ersed in not more than eight minutes each way, including starting 
and ])raking, the maximum speed of 201 kilometers (126 miles) being 
actually reached on the section Mahlow-Dahlwitz-Rangsdortf, traversed 
in one and one-half minutes, throughout about 5 kilometers. The 
mean speed of 175 kilometers per hour would enable the journey 
between Berlin and Cologne (577 kilometers) to be completed in about 
three and one-fourth hours, whereas the fastest present trains require 
fully nine hours. 

This result, which aroused such sensation in the engineering' world, 
was exceeded on October 23, when 207 kilometers were reached with- 
out an\^ disturbing factors being noted. 

The Allgemeine Elektrizitats Gesellschaft car had meanwhile in 
turn resumed the experiments, both cars being alternately used in the 
course of October. In order to ascertain first the working conditions 
of the car, moderate speeds were used at the beginning, which, how- 
ever, could rapidly be increased, so that the high-speed car of the All- 
gemeine Elektrizitats Gesellschaft on October 28 even slightly exceeded 
the record made by the Siemens car, reaching the enormous speed of 
210 kilometers per hour. Both cars ran so steadily that all those 
present were highly satisfied. 

From a car running at such exceedingly high speeds neigh])oring 
objects, of course, will disappear from view. Though the motorman 
would be able to distinguish obstacles on the track, this would be of 
little use, the braking distance, i. e., the distance from the beginning 
of braking to the stopping of the train, being 2 kilometers, and 1,(300 
horsepower having been necessary to obtain the desired speed. 
Lookers-on could just distinguish the presence of men in the car; 
before, however, they were able to fix their figure the car had disap- 
peared from view. Though the track is very straight there elapsed 
at most one-half minute between the first appearing of the train and 
its passage and thence to the instant of its disappearance on the 
horizon. 



MARIENFELDE-ZOSSEN ELECTRIC-RAILWAY TRIALS. 331 

As the maximum authorized speed has now been reached it is not 
intended, for the moment being-, to drive the speeds up to any higher 
figures, but to complete the measurements already made by an exten- 
sive series of records, so as to ascertain fully the working condition 
of high-speed electric railways. It is thought probable that under 
existing conditions speeds as high as '2'SO to ;>-i() kilometers per hour 
may be obtained without any difficulty, but as no authorization is 
obtained for the moment this will have to wait for next year. It is 
thought probable that after the successful results of these trials some 
railway will be equipped according to the principles ascertained on the 
military railwa}^ so as to allow of these interesting trials being con- 
tinued on a larger scale. 



THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY— A CHAPTER IN 
THE HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHOTOG- 
RAPHY WITH THE SALTS OF SILVER/' 



By Maj. Gen. J. Waterhouse, I. A. 



Photograph}" proper, i. c, the art of delineating images of external 
objects by the agency of light upon chemically prepared sensitive sur- 
faces, does not seem to have been seriously thought of, still less prac- 
ticed, before the end of the eighteenth centur}". The publication of 
Wedgwood and Davy's experiments in 1802 showed not only the 
possibility of reproducing copies of drawings or paintings on glass, 
by contact, upon a sensitive surface of paper or leather impregnated 
with silver nitrate, but also gave the first idea of fixing the images of 
the camera obscura on such a surface. The results obtained by them 
were, however, ver}^ imperfect, and photograph}^ did not take anj^ 
practical shape until the time of Niepce, Daguerre, Reade, and Talbot, 
between the j^ears 1825 and 1810. But long before Wedgwood's time, 
and especially during the last two or three decades of the eighteenth 
century, when the science of chemistry received such rapid develop- 
ment, considerable attention had been given to the chemical and plw^- 
ical action of light in changing the appearance of many metallic 
compounds and organic substances, notably the blackening of animal 
or vegetal^le tissues by silver nitrate, the darkening of the white sil- 
ver chloride and other metallic salts, and the darkening or bleaching 
of many organic dyes and resins, etc. On the other hand, Newton's 
discovery of the compound nature of white light gave an impetus to 
the study of the physical nature and of the chemical and optical prop- 
erties of light and color which in more recent years has had and must 
continue to have a ver}" strong influence on the further development 
and progress of photograph}^ Again, Kepler's investigations of the 
optical principles connected with the projection of images of external 
objects upon a screen by means of lenses, single or combined, and the 
camera obscura form the basis of modern ^photographic optics.

ical writers for inquiries of my own relative to the action of light upon

834 THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 

silver and its compounds, I commenced collecting- material for an 
investigation into the evolution of photography with the salts of silver. 
My attention was, however, diverted to the optical side of the ques- 
tion connected with the history of the camera obscura and the 
telephoto lens, and the results of those inquiries have been published 
in the Journal. 

The publication of the late Mr. R. B. Litchfield's biography of Tom 
Wedgwood, the first photographer, which was intended as a centenary 
memoir of the founder of the art, has renewed my interest in the 
subject, and the further investigations 1 have lately made have, I 
think, thrown quite a new light upon the early histor}^ of photograph}^ 
and .shown how it was gradually developed from Schulze's rough 
experiment with silver nitrate and chalk, and finally brought about, 
though imperfectly, by Wedgwood and Davy. This retrospect seems 
the more opportune now that a century has passed since Wedgwood's 
work was first made known, and we are about to celebrate the jubilee 
of our societ}^ which, however, was not founded imtil after the iuA^en- 
tion of collodion had put photographv on a thoroughly practical 
basis. 

The main facts in the early history of the progress of photo-chem- 
istry and optics tending to phc^tograph}' have been noted in • Prof. 
J. M. Eder's admirable Ausfiihrliches Handbuch der Photographie 
(Part I, 1891), in which I have found many useful references to the 
early writers and literature. 1 know of no English work in which 
the subject has been treated with the fullness it deserves. And this is 
the more to be regretted because so much of the 6arly investigation 
was done by Englishmen and is almost unknown. Robert Hunt's 
Researches on Light has no pretensions to b(> a historv, while W. J. 
Harrison's History of Photograph}', though it contains a short sum- 
mary of the earl}^ work, is more devoted to the record of progress in 
practical photography since 1S39. The story of these early experi- 
ments is, however, an interesting one; and although I can only give a 
brief and necessarilv very incomplete sketch of it, this ma}^ serve to 
draw attention to the subject and incite further incpiir}'. 

EARLY NOTICES OF SALTS OF SILVER. 

Nitrate of silver seems to have been known from very early times. 
Doctor Vogel infers from Herapath's statement that silver has been 
found on linen niumm}^ cloths marked with hierogl3"phs that the 
ancient Egyptians knew of the darkening action of light upon silver 
nitrate. (W. and T. J. Herapath, Phil. Mag. (iv) 3, 528, and 5, 339.) 
One of the earliest authentic accounts of it is given by Jabir i))n Hay- 
yam (commonly Icnown as Geber), who lived about the seventh or 
eighth century. Li the quaint English translations of his works by 
Richard Russel (lt>78j we find a clear description of nitric acid (dis- 



THE BEGINNINGS OF PH0T06EAPHY. 335 

solutivo water) prepared ])y distillation of a mixture of vitriol of 
Cyprus (copperas), saltpeter, and alum. By adding- sal ammoniac a 
kind of aqua regia was formed, which he says would dissolve gold, 
sulphur, and silver. B}' dissolving calcined silver in its solutive water 
(nitric acid), and allowing a third part to evaporate, he ()l)tained the 
nitrate in the form of small fusi))le stones, like crystal. (Invention of 
Verity, cap. 2, p. 266.) He also mentions a peculiar celestine or 
h3^acinth color produced ])y exposing* silver to the fumes of acute 
things — as of vinegar, sal ammoniac, etc. Later on we find a g-reat 
many references to this silver blue pigment in the writings of the early 
chemists and painters. In some cases the color was no doubt due to 
the verdig]-is formed by the action of strong vinegar on the copper 
alloy mixed with the silver, l)ut in others it may have been a form of 
chloride or compound chloride of silver with ammonia and copper of 
an intense blue color. So that silver chloride may have taken its place 
in pictorial art very much earlier than is generally supposed. Entzelius, 
in his De Re Metallica (Frankfort, 1557, p. 17), mentions a plum col- 
ored silver ore which, according to Theophrastus, was used as a tine 
pignuMit. He also notes the great variet}^ of color shown by the ores 
of silver. 

We may pass over Albertus Magnus and the alchemists of the 
eleventh to the fifteenth centuries, whose methods of making nitric 
acid, silver nitrate, and at^ua regia were for the most part derived from 
Geber. And though they must have been acquainted with silver 
chloride, they have, so far as I have been able to ascertain, h^ft no 
record of the action of light upon it or an}" other silver compound. 
Little, indeed, to this effect can be found in the works of the earlier 
mineralogists and metallurgists of the sixteenth century, who mention 
several different ores of native silver, but seldom undei- the name of 
horn silver, or luna cornea, and it is very difficult to ascertain which 
of the many translucent ores descril)ed by them really was tlie native 
chloride. 

One of the earliest and 1)\' far the most important of these writers, 
Georgius Agricola (Georg Bauer), in his De Natura Fossil ium, liber S, 
written al)out 1546, mentions silver as producing black lines and dirty- 
ing the hands; acids also corrode it, tinge it l)lue, and destroy it. In 
another passage, in liber 10 of the same work, he describes an excellent 
method of making- the blue pigment al)Ove referred to by exposing 
sheets oF sihcr full of small iissures, which should be filled up with 
mercury, to the vapors of a mixture of sal ammoniac dissolved in the 
strongest vinegar in a closed vessel buried in the earth or in dung for 
about twenty da3^s. 

The l)est edition of his Dc Re Metallica and other works, published 
at Iksel in 1657, is a complete treatise on mining and metallurgy, 
illustrated with many curious pictures of mines and mining machinery. 



336 THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 

In an index at page 702 of this ])ook we find tlie German equivalents 
to the Latin names of a number of ores of silver, but thei'e is no men- 
tion wliatcver of horn silver, nor have I found any distinct reference 
to it in the volume. Nor is there any reference to the darkening of 
these ores by light, though he says of one form of Tyrolean glassy 
ore (argentum rude rheticum, pri)l)ably a sulphide*) that from a blue 
inclining to violet "it blackens or is ash colored. 

FARRICIUS AND OTPIERS ON HORN SILVER. 

In a note to a memoir on Daguerreotype, written about 1839. Arago 
says (OEuvres completes, T, 4»)t)) that in a work l)y Fabricius (De Rebus 
Metallicis, 1.5.56) there is a full description of a kind of silver ore called 
"horned silver," with the color and transparence of horn, the fusibility 
and softness of wax. Exposed to light, it passed from a 3'ellowish 
gra}^ to violet, and by a more prolonged action became almost black; 
it was natural horn silver. Tissandier (History and Handbook of 
Photography) makes Fal)ricius an alchemist and says that he prepared 
luna cornea by precipitating a solution of silver nitrate with sea salt, 
and that in his Book of the Metals (15.56) he relates that the image 
projected by a glass lens onto a surface of luna cornea imprinted itself 
in black and g'ray according as the parts were completely illuminated 
or touched only by diffused light. Harrison, in his History, also 
gives a simihir account. 

Becquerel, Eder, and Fabre have already noted that there is nothing 
to this effect in the little treatise De Metallicis Rebus ac Nominibus, 
ohservationes variie et eruditfe, ex Schedis Georgii Fabricii: (juibus 
ea potissimum explicantur, qn&i Georgius Agricola prwteriit, com- 
piled from notes by (jeorgius Fabricius (Georg Goldschmied) sent b}- 
his brother to Kentmann and published in 1566 b}^ Conrad Gesner, of 
Zurich, in a collection of simihir treatises on gems, fossils, minerals, 
etc. In the chapter on silver (p. 6) Fabricius sa3^s: "In no metal is 
there such a great variet}' of colors as appears in this by some marvel- 
ous artifice of nature: some ores are transhicent, as the red or liver- 
colored, another is like a ruby, a third lias a horny light (hicem cor- 
neam) and is very like cornelian (sarda)." Again he says that "the 
liver-colored ore is described in his book of metals (in nostra corpore 
metallico). This also is soft like lead and melts over a candle; poured 
out on gy])sum, on account of its spiritual subtility it is entirely con- 
sumed. Its thinner particles are translucid like horn, the thinnest 
like ice." In a list of various ores of silver (p. lo) lie mentions one 
(cornei coloris translucidum), ti'anslucid Avith the color of liorn, but 
that is all; not a word al)out any change of color by exposure to light 
or otherwise. From the above it seems possible that Fabricius wrote 
an earlier work on metals, ])ut I have not been able to find any trace 
of it. From 1553 till his death, in 1571, he was director of the college 



THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. S37 

at Meissen, and was the author of several philological, historical, 
and poetical works (F. All)inus, Meissniche Land-('hronica, p. 322). 
His treatise on metals, referred to, is not in the least alchemistic. Son 
of a goldsmith, born and living in the mining disti-icts in Saxony, it 
is natural that he should have taken an interest in metals. So far as I 
have l)een able to gather, the accounts of his observations of the action 
of light on horn silver, or silver chloride, are quite apocrA^phal. 

In G. D. Schreber's Life of Fabricius (1717) we find several pas- 
sages showing the friendship that existed ])etween Fabricius and Agri- 
cola and the help given to the latter by the former in compiling his 
book, to whicli the notes by Fabricius were intended as a supplement 
and were so pu])lished in the edition of 1565. 

In another treatise in the same volume, b}" Johann Kentmann, 
describing the minerals of Misnia (Meissen) there is a list of 84 difi'er- 
ent ores of silver, and among the yellow ones he describes one as 
"pellucid like horn, from Marienberg: melts over a candle." 

The only distinct early notice of horn silver and of its change of 
color I have come across is in a little German book l)y H. Modestin 
Fachs, mint master at Leipzig, Probier Buchlein (1567). At page 184, 
in a list of silver ores, he mentions horn silver ore (Horen Silberertz) 
and says: "' It looks just like horn, such as is used for horse combs, 
and may ))e cut and impressed like wax; is ver}' rich in silver. Like 
it, such horn silver is wont also to change to the color of oxidized lead 
(bley nichter.) " 

Johann Mathesius, in his Bergpostilla, or Sarepta (1578), mentions 
horn-colored silver ore as lateh' found in the Marienberg mines, trans- 
parent like the horn of a lantern and fusible over a flame. (This maj'' 
explain why Agricola does not notice it.) He does no(f note the 
change of color on exposure, but in the Meissnische Berg-Chronica 
(1590), page 110, Petrus Albinus describes a remarkable white semi- 
fluid silver ore from St. Georgen, which was said to be like butter- 
milk when found, but soon hardened in the air, becoming like sand or 
grit, and its white color changed to l)rown or rusty. This semiHuid 
ore is also noticed by Albertus INIagnus and Agricola, ])ut there is 
nothing to show it was a chloride. Albinus also mentions horn silver 
from Marienberg (p. 127) in nuich the same terms as Mathesius, and, 
with I'c^gard to the variety of colors it assumes, he quotes the extracts 
from Fabricius, given above, as referring to this ore. In this way the 
earl}' knowledge of native horn silver and its liabilit}^ to change of 
color seems to have been entirely conlined to iho mining districts of 
Saxony. 

Even in the great work of Aldrovandus, Musajum Metallicum (161S), 
although we tind a very full and interesting account of silver and its 
ores, with many illustrations, nothing definite is said about horn sil- 
ver. Nor does Father Kircher mention it in his Muudus Subterraneus 
(1665). 



338 THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 

From the sixteenth centuiy onward the science of chemistry as dis- 
tinct from alcheni}', or the search for the philosopher's' stone and 
transmutation of metals, beg-an to develop in connection with medicine 
under the impulse of the teaching of Paracelsus and his followers. 
Tinctures of gold and silver being considered of high remedial value, 
attention was paid to the preparation of salts of these metals. It is in 
a book of this kind, the Basilica Chymica, by Oswald Croll (Frank- 
fort, 1608), we have perhaps the first distinct mention of the precipita- 
tion of silver chloride by adding salt water to a solution of silver in 
aqua fortis. He mentions its fusibility, softness, and capability of 
being cut b}^ a knife, and calls it, from its horn-like appearance after 
fusion, "that unknown luna cornea,*" and warns his readers against 
it being used in combination with lead to prove the transmutation of 
metals, the falsified lead being apparently turned into silver. He 
says nothing, however, about an}" darkening in light. 

In the translation of Erckern's book on Assa^dng, by Sir John 
Fettus (Fleta Minor, 1683), page 5, he refers to the horny ore of silver 
as being called so from its transparency, or rather lucidation, like 
horn, and very rich in silver next to certain glass ores, or sulphides. 
In the same way, C. K. Schindlcr, in Dcr Geheimbde Miinz (luardein 
und Berg Probierer (1705), mentions horn ore as a kind of transparent 
ore like the horn of a lantern and of rich yield. 

That these horny ores of silver were identical with the luna cornea 
or horn silver, formed by fusing the precipitated chloride, seems 
doubtful from the account of them given by J. A. Cramer in his 
Eleinenta Artis Docimasticic (1739), of which there is an English trans- 
lation by Dr. Cromwell IVIortimer (1764). Horny silver ore is described 
as semitr^nsparent, of a deeper or lighter yellow or brown color, 
according to the size of the pieces, looking like resin, easily powdered, 
and lamellar in structure. When strong]}' heated it emits sulphurous 
and arsenical fumes and only contains two-thirds of silver. 

In the second part of the l)ook he describes the purification of silver 
by precipitation as chloride with nuiriatic acid from the solution of the 
nitrate. If the precipitate is dried and melted and poured out quickly 
"it appears as a body of a light scarlet color, half transparent, pon- 
derous enough, and so tenacious that it is diflicult to reduce it to pow- 
der, and if you'})reak it, it seems to be of a fi})rous texture within; 
whence it is called 'Lunje cornua,' on account of its resembling the 
horns of animals on the outside." He, however, says nothing about 
this substance ]>eing darkened by exposure to light, nor of its relation 
to the horny silver ore. 

CRONSTEDT AND WOULFE. 

We find the first distinct recognition of the identity of the true 
hornertz, or horny silver ore, with the luna cornea, or horn silver, pre- 
pared by precipitation from the nitrate in Cronstedt's essay toward a 



THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 339 

system of mineralogy (1T58), of which an Eno-lish translation by von 
Engestrom and Costa appeared in 1770, and a second edition by 
Magellan in 1788. He sa3^s that the horn silver ore is the scarcest 
silver ore; it is of a white or pearl color, changeable on the surface, 
semitransparent, and somewhat ductile when crude and when melted. 
It can not be decomposed without some admixture of such substances 
as attract the combined acid of the sea salt. Although he notes the 
blackening of the glassy ore or sulphide in the air, he does not clearly 
mention the blackening of the horn silver. In Magelhin's edition the 
darkening of this ore to a violaceous brown when exposed to the sun's 
beams, as happens also to the artihcial horn silver, is mentioned in a 
note. 

The first definite chemical analysis of crude mineral horn silver 
compared with the artificially prepared, was made by Peter Woulfe 
(Phil. Trans., 6(), 1776, 608). He notes the confusion existing between 
the horny ores and the glassy ores, containing sulphur and arsenic, 
and says that Cronstedt and Le Sago asserted that the native horn 
silver was composed of silver and sea salt only. Woulfe also found 
some sulphate, amounting to about one-third of the chloride, and in 
some samples admixture of sulphides. He says nothing al)out the 
darkening in light, but mentions a black horn silver. 

DARKENING ACTION OF SILVER NITRATE. 

On the other hand, the darkening action of silver nitrate was known 
much earlier. It is generally said thtit Albertus Magiuis was the first 
to record it in his Compositum de Compositis, but this is not correct. 
After his description of the preparation of nitric acid, which is very 
similar to Geber's, he says: "It dissolves silver and separates it from 
gold; it calcines mercury and crocus martins; it stains the human 
skin with a black color diflicult to remove." As given in the texts 
this latter passage certainly refers to the acid and not to the solution 
of silver. But there may have been some silver in the acid. 

In J. B. Porta's Magia Naturalis (1589) liber 10, caption 20, we find 
a modification of Ge))er\s old recipe for making aqua fortis, for part- 
ing silver from gold, by distilling niter and alum, also for making 
aqua regia by adding sal ammoniac to the other ingredients, and another 
for sulphuric acid. In liber 16 he gives a number of methods for 
secret writing, among others writing on the skin with a solution of 
silver in aqua fortis, and in liber 20 he gives a method of disguising 
oneself for some time by applying the same solution over the body. 
It is curious that he should not have thought of applying the solution 
to paper. 

In the well-known work by Caneparius, De Atramentis (161i»), deal- 
ing with the preparation of pigments and inks of various kinds, we 
might have expected to find mention of the use of a solution of nitrate 



340 THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 

of silvei' as a s^anpathetic ink or as an indellil)le markiiio- ink, ])ut he 
says nothing- of this, thouoh he mentions the use of silver for writing. 

He gives, however, several recipes for making azure blue pigments 
from silver, gold, and mercmy, which, in the case of silver, all depend 
on the formation of an impvire chloride, or double chloride of silver 
and copper, l\y the action of the vapors of vinegar and sal ammoniac 
upon thin plates of silver inclosed in a tight vessel and left for some 
time under warm dung or grape husks, etc. There is no mention of 
any addition of mercury as recommended 1)V Agricola. 

Angelus Sala, in his Opera Medico-Chymica(16'47), mentions the stain- 
ing of the hands ])y solution of silver nitrate, but sa3'S it has not the 
strong corrosi\e action of nitric acid, and when some of the salt was 
kept in paper for about a j^ear the paper was darkened ]>ut not cor- 
roded. He also notes that powdered lunar caustic (lapis lunaris) 
exposed to sunshine appeared like the })lackest ink; this was after- 
wards quoted by Kircher. He noticed the same change of color if it 
was mixed with solution of gold. He gives full instructions for cr3\s- 
tallizing the solution of lapis lunaris. Sala was the lirst to recognize 
annnonia as a separate l)ody. 

In Glauber's Opera Ch^'uiica (10.5s) there are ^several ]>assages relat- 
ing to the use of nitrate' of silver solution for staining hard woods like 
ebony, or for dyeing leather or feathers black, and this is perhaps the 
hrst mention of the practical use of it for sucli purposes. In Christo- 
pher Packe's excellent translation of Glauber's works (1(389), Philo- 
sophical Furnaces, Part II, caption 28, page 26, a method of preparing 
crystallized silver nitrate is described, and the solubility of the chlo- 
ride in ammonia is noted as follows: 

The remaining solution which is not crystallized, yi»u may, in a copper vessel 1)y 
adding sweet water thereto, precipitate over the fire into a calx and then eilnlcorate 
it and dry it and keep it for other use. Or else you may precipitate the same with 
salt water and so edulcorate and dry it; and you will have a calx which doth melt 
by a gentle fire and is of a special nature, and in the spirit of urin, of salammoniak, 
of hartshorn, of amber, of soot, and of hair it doth easily dissolve, and it may be 
prepared or turned into good medicines as shortly in our treating of the spirit of 
urin shall be taught. 

After describing several medicinal preparations of silver, as well as 
a green oil, made with spirit of sal annnoniac and useful for silvering 
metals or glass he goes on to mention othtn- uses of silver crystals: 

Lastly, there be many pretty things more effected (besides the medii-inal use) by 
means of crystal of silver — viz, when you dissolve them in ordinary sweet rainwater 
you may dye beard, hair, skin, and nails of men or beasts into carnation or pink red, 
l>rown, or black, according as you have put more or less thereof in the water, or else 
according as the hair was more or less wetted therewith, wherehy the asjiect of man 
or beast (which sometimes in several occasions may not be contemned) is changed 
so that they can not be known. 



THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 341 

He says very little about the eliloride, and bad apparently no idea of 
the action of light or sunshine in producing the change of color in 
organic matter by the action of silver nitrate. 

In the same way Robert Boj^le frequently mentions the stahiing of 
the skin I33' solutions of silver or of gold and also the darkening of the 
chloride in the air, but seems to have had no idea that it was due to 
the action of light. Thus, in his General History of the Air (1692), 
page 53, he says: 

If we precipitate a strong solution of good silver made in aqua fortis with a com- 
jietent quantity of spirit of sea salt we shall have a pouder whieh at lirst will be very 
white; but if the liquor l^e nut poured off, this being exposed for a good while to 
the air, it would acquire on the surface a dark colour, which perhaps an attentive 
eye will discern somewhat various, as this or that kind of saltness happens to be 
predominant in the air. 

At page 52 he mentions that silver plate exposed to the air in Amster- 
dam is very readily tarnished, and it is evident that he looked upon the 
darkening of the chloride as something analogous and due to saltness 
or impurit}" in the air. 

Nicolas Lemery also des^cribes the preparation of a medicinal '" lunar 
tincture''' made by dissolving precipitated silver chloride in spirit of 
urine and spirit of wine. He says, further, that the precipitate of sil- 
vci- with salt darkens on drying, even in the shade, no doul)t on 
account of a small quantity of copper present. 

sciiulze's observations. 

Although the writings of Kunckel and Stahl contain a good deal 
about the chemistr}- of the compounds of silver and their reduction by 
heat and chemical methods, we find no observations of the darkening 
by light, and the first investigation of this action was made b}- Johann 
Heinrich Schulze, who published an account of his experiments in the 
Acta of the Cesarean Academy for 1727. (A full translation of this 
paper appcuired in this journal for ISiKS, p. 53.) Though these exper- 
iments were mentioned b}' Priestley and other authors, and, as I propose 
to show, in all probabilit}^ led the way to Wedgwood's work, they 
seem(Hl to ha\e entirel}' dropped out of sight until they were ])rought 
forward l)y Doctor Eder in 1881, in his histor}^ of photography pub- 
lished in the Photo. Correspondenz. Like manj'^ valuable discoveries, 
th(\v originated with the investigation of an accident. St-hulze tells us 
that while experimenting on the preparation of the Bolognian phos- 
phorus, with a mixture of chalk saturated with some aqua fortis which 
contained a small quantity of silver, at an open window, he was sur- 
prised to rind tlie color of the surface changed to a dark puri)lish red, 
while the part untouched by the sun's rays remained unchanged. 
This curious fact struck him so forci})ly that he put aside liis original 
experiments to investigate the cause of the darkening. His friends 



342 THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 

suggested that it was due to heat, but experiment showed it was not 
so. He then divided the mixture into two parts, one being kept in 
the dark while the bottle containing the other was put in the hot sun 
with a thread passed round it al)out the middle of the part exposed to 
the sun. After some hours' exposure the thread was removed, and 
he was delighted to find that under it the color of the mixture was the 
same as that in the back part of the bottle, which had not been exposed. 
The experiment was repeated in various waj^s, and proved that the 
change of color depended entirely on the sun's light, and that heat had 
nothing to do with it. He then tried experiments in the converse 
way, i. e., he mixed up the fluid to give it a uniform color, and then 
covered the greater part of the glass with opaque ])odies, or with cut- 
out words or sentences on paper, leaving only a small portion of the 
mixture exposed. In this way the words or sentences were accurately 
and distinctly reproduced on the chalk sediment, and the result was 
looked upon as a great marvel by ignorant people. 

Feeling tliat still further invi^stigation was necessary, and l)elieving 
that the etiects were dependent on the mixture of chalk and aqua fortis, 
he tried several experiments with fuming spirits of niter and ordinary 
a([ua fortis mixed with chalk, but obtaining no result, he remembered 
that the aqua fortis he had first used contained some silver, and that 
the effects must have been due to it, because he had already noticed 
that solutions of silver in aqua fortis turned dark red after exposure 
to the sun. He then repeated his first experiments with an aqua fortis 
containing more silver, and observed that the color was more distinctly 
marked tlian before. He found also that reflected sunlight was capable 
of producing the same result. He notes that other white sLil)stances, 
such as hartshorn, white magnesia, ceruse of lead, can be used to show 
the same effect as with the chalk. Ex^n then he seems to have felt 
that he had not penetrated to the real cause of the phenomenon, and 
only suggests the use of it as a means of testing the presence of silver 
in a solution. He evidentl}^ had no idea of its photographic possi- 
bilities. 

Although Schulze did not set out witli the idea of making photo- 
graphic copies by means of his silver and chalk mixture, and his 
cut-out stencils were only used to give a clear demonstration of the 
action of light, it nuist ])e acknowledged that his experiments Avore 
distinctly photographic in that he first produces his negative images 
of the thread, leaving a white line on a dark ground, and then the 
positive images, dark on a wliite ground, of his cut-out words and 
sentences, or in modern parlance his negative, or cliche. There is no 
doubt that here we have the germ of the photographic idea, and 
further on I shall endeavor to show how it was taken up in this coun- 
try and led more or less directly to Wedgwood's own experiments. 



THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGEAPHY. 343 

1)U FAY AND irELLOT. 

In the M(unoir,s of the French Acadeni}^ for 1728, page 50, Du Fa}^ 
has de.scri])ed a method of stainiiio- agates ))y treating" them with a 
sohition of silver nitrate, and when dry exposing them to sunshine; 
the solution, penetrating to different depths in the more or less al)sorb- 
ent layers of the stone, produced variegated effects not shown in the 
original. In some cases the solution was applied with a pen. Du Fay 
seems, however, to have had no idea of using a stencil, and to have 
worked, though almost contemporaneously, cpiite independently of 
an3'thing done l)y Schidze, the staining of objects b}^ silver nitrate 
solutions })eing, as we have already seen, w^ell known, though the 
necessity of the objects being exposed to light was not so clearly 
recognized. He also used solutions of gold and bisnuith, and notes 
the favorable effect of a certain amount of moisture in strengthening 
the reduction. 

Similarly, llellot, in the same memoirs for 1787, mentions the use of 
a weak solution of silver nitrate as a sympathetic ink which would 
show nothing so long as the paper were kept in darkness, ])ut on 
exposure to the sun darkened and showed the writing in a slaty gray, 
this effect being due, as Hellot thought, to the action of some sulphur- 
ous principle in the nitric acid which ])lackened the silver. This is 
int('r(\sting as, apparentl}', the first recorded graphic application of 
silver nitrate to paper. 

BECCARl's OBSEKVATIONS. 

We have already pointed out the incorrectness of the commonh' 
accepted statement that Georgius Fabricius was the ffrst to pu])lish the 
fact that luna cornea, or silver chloride, darkened on exposure to 
light, and, although this darkening must have been constantly observed, 
it was, even up to Boyle's time, not attributed to the action of light, 
but rather to sofiio effect of the air or sulphurous vapors. That it was 
due to the action of light was first proved by Jacopo Bartolomeo Bec- 
cari, of Bologna, in 1757, b}^ a method ver}'^ similar to Schulze's with 
the nitrate. His paper, in the fourth volume of the Commentaries of 
the Bolognian Academv, deals with the power which light possesses of 
itself to change not only the colors but likewise the texture of things. 

Having a suspicion that the change in color of luna cornea, gener- 
ally attributed to the action of the air, was due to light, he inclosed 
some in a glass vessel and i)laced it at some distance in front of the 
window of a room not ver}^ brilliantly lighted. After some time he 
noticed that the luna cornea on the side toward the window had turned 
violet, while that on the other side away from the light retained its 
original color. This showed that there was some influence in light 
which caused changes of color. To make ((uite sure, however, ho tixed 
SM V.HrS 23 



344 THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 

some black paper on the unchang-ed .side of the vessel to see if it would 
protect the silver salt, and left it again exposed till next day, when, on 
returning to it, he found that the luna cornea had turned violet ever}^- 
where except in the parts protected by the paper. From this he con- 
cluded that the change was due more to the action of the light than of 
the air, and that the same is probabl}^ the case with the fading of the 
colors of garments, for fullers when dyeing the more costh" cloths onl}^ 
consider a dye good if the color remains unchanged after a long exposure 
in full daylight, though thev probabl}' attribute the injury to the effect 
of the air rather than of light. The 7"emainder of the paper is devoted 
to experiments ])y Bonzo on the changes of color of silken ribbons in 
light. Here, as in the case of Schulze, Beccari's experiment was more 
photochemical than photographic. 

DR. WILLIAM lewis's INVESTIGATIONS. 

So far it had Ijeen recognized that the change of color of silver 
compounds was due to the action of light, but nothing had been done 
to show what chemical changes took place during this action or what 
were the conditions to be fulfilled, and the first to make any investiga- 
tion in this direction was Dr. William Lewis, M. D., F. R. S., the 
author of many works on technical chemistry. In his Commercium 
Philosophicum Technicum, or Philosophical Commerce of Arts (1763), 
he has given a very full account of his inv^estigations into the cause of 
the coloration of ivory, bone, wood, or stone treated with solution of 
silver nitrate and exposed to sunshine. He repeated Schulze's experi- 
ments with chalk moistened with solution of silver nitrate, both while 
wet and after being dried, and notes that the color is produced only 
on those parts on which the sun shines, and that distinct characters may 
be exhibited on the mass by intercepting a part of the sun's light by 
threads or cut paper. He found that the color thus produced on the 
chalk}" mixture was not so deep as it was on bone or ivory and was 
entirely superficial, so that b}" shaking up the mixture it again appeared 
white. By exposing the mixture constantly to light for many weeks 
and frequently shaking it, he was able to darken it throughout, though 
weakly. The light of a candle or the ordinary warmth of a fire had 
no effect, but at a considerable heat the matter became brown, though 
it did not become black as it did in the sun. 

He also tried several earth}' bodies and found that those which 
dissolve in acids, the ashes of vegetables, of bones and horns, darkened 
in the same way as chalk and other mineral calcareous earths. Pow- 
dered flint remained perfectly uncolored, even after six months' 
exposure in the sun. White clay, plaster of Paris, and powdered talc 
also remained uncolored; and even chalk itself, previously satiated with 
vitriolic acid so as not to be acted upon 1)y the acid in which the silver 
was dissolved, was imchanged. He concluded, therefore, that to pro- 



THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGEAPHY. 345 

dnce a l)lMck stain from solution of silver, it was necessary not onl}' 
that the sul)stance moistened with it should be exposed to the action 
of solar light, ])ut that it should contain some matter which the nitrous 
acid mig-ht dissolve preferably to the silver which it already held dis- 
solved. He observes that thoug-h this is plaiidy the case with bones, 
horns, hair, marble, and other bodies which ai'c stained by the silver 
solution, there are also some stones, such as agate, in which a sub- 
stance soluble by the acid has not yet discovered itself. (In another 
place he refers to Du Fay's experiments with agates already noted.) 

He goes on to say that this production of a dark color by the action 
of the sun is not peculiar to solution of silver, or to a combination of 
this solution with soluble earths, and notes that precipitated nitrate of 
bisnmth and mercurius dulcis, a combination of quicksilver with the 
marine acid (calomel), suffer a like change, but do not become l)lack 
like silver. He does not mention the action of light on silver chloride. 

In the early part of the book he notes also that the solution of gold 
in aqua regia stains the skin and other animal and vegetable substances 
purple, the coloring being hastened b}" exposure to the sun and free 
air and favored by the presence of moisture. He mentions several 
other preparations of the muriate of gold combined with sea salt, 
niter, or sal anuuoniac, as well as solutions in ether and volatile oils. 
He also discusses the staining power of a solution of platimnn in acpia 
regia in the light and finds it nmch less than that of gold. It gives a 
brown stain to organic materials dipped in it, but in most cases water' 
washes off the stain. 

CONNECTION BETWEEN SCHULZE AND WPHXIWOOU. 

These very interesting researches are, like the previons ones of 
Schulze and Beccari, mor(> photochemical than pht)tographic, though 
the}" form a noteworthy contri])ution to the bistor}- of silver printing 
which has hitherto been quite overlooked. They are the more impor- 
tant because it appears extremely probal)le that they form the con- 
necting link between Schulze and Wedgwood, for we tind in Dr. 
Thomas Thomson's History of Chemistry (Vol. I, p. SGO), that at Doc- 
tor Lewis's death, in 1781, all the manuscript volumes containing his 
experiments and collections from other authoi's which had ])een com- 
pih'd by hU assistant, ]\Ir. Chicholm, who liad 1)een with him for man}' 
years, were purchased ])y ^Ir. Wedgwood, who jilsotook Mr. Chicholm 
into his own service and put him in charge of his la])oratory. Accord- 
ing to Miss Meteyard (Life of Josiah Wedgwood, "2, }). 465), the name 
of this assistant was Alexander Chisholm; he had been thirty 3'ears 
with Doctor Lewis, of Kingston-on-Thames, and entered AVedgwood's 
service at Etruria as secretary and chenucal assistant in 1782, and 
was for a long tinu^ liis right-hand man. He di(Kl in 1S()7. From 
Mr. Litchtield's "'Tom AN'edgwood" (p. 5), it appears that C/hisholm (or 



346 THE BEGINNINGS OV PHOTOGRAPHY. 

Chisolm, as Litchtield spells it) had a g-reat deal to do with the educa- 
tion of young- Tom. He was a good chemist, a man of education, and 
at least something of a classical scholar, and the bo}^ seems to have 
received nmch of his scientific and classical training from him, and 
when at the university corresponded freely with him, chiefly on chem- 
ical topics. He no doubt also assisted him in his early experiments. 
This connection of Chisholm, first with Doctor Lewis and the photo- 
chemical experiments recorded in the Commercium Philosophicum 
Technicum, and then with the Wedgwoods, throws a good deal of 
light upon the probal)le origin of Tom Wedgwood's photographic 
experiments, and it is possible that if an}^ of the correspondence 
between Tom Wedgwood and Chisholm, or any of the hitter's manu- 
script notes, are still available, some valuable information on the 
subject may vet be obtainable. 

DOCTOR TRIESTI.EY. 

In 1772 Dr. Joseph Priestley pul)lished his valuable History of Dis- 
coveries relating to Light, Vision, and Color, and it is interesting to 
note (p. 378) that he was a believer in the theor}^ that light was a real 
substance, consisting of particles of matter emitted by luminous bodies, 
and considered that this view was favored by experiments demonstrat- 
ing that the color and inward texture of some l)odies are changed by 
exposure to light. He notes Duhamers researches on the purple 
color extracted from a shellfish found in Provence, which is developed 
by sunshine; also Beccari's experiments with luna cornea, alread}- 
mentioned. With regard to this he remarks that it does not appear 
that Beccarius knew on what ingredient in the composition the change 
of color depended, and then he fully describes Schulze's experiments, 
which prove it to have been the silver. Although Doctor Lewis's 
book is mentioned in the list of authorities consulted by Priestley in 
the preparation of his history, he makes no mention of his chemical 
investigation of Schulze's experiment, but- goes on to discuss the 
further experiments of Bonzius and Beccarius on the action of light 
on ribbons, etc.; but these do not concern us at present. 

In connection with Priestley it may be noted that Josiah AYedgwood, 
the father of Tom, was a subscriber to this book of Priestley's, and 
we may agree with Miss Meteyard that it was not unlikely that young 
Wedgwood would knov/ the book, especially as he was interested in 
questions l)earing on light and heat. Moreover, Mr. Litchtield men- 
tions (op. cit., p. 19) that while working at the long series of experi- 
ments descril>ed in his two papers of 1701-92 Tom Wedgwood was 
corresponding with Priestley, who was an intimate friend of the family, 
and if he were working at photography at the same time it is not 
improbal)le that his attention would have been drawn to Schulze's 
experiment, even if Chisholm had not already told him of it. 



THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGEAPHY. 847 

We next find Schulze's experiment included by Dr. A\'illiam Hooper 
in hi« Rational Recreations (1774, 4, 141}) under the heading- "Writing 
on glass b}' the rays of the sun." It was repeated by Ilalle in 1784 
in his Magie, oder die Zauberkrafte der Natur, who mentions writing 
with sympathetic inks made of solutions of gold or silver, and it 
appears also in later collections of chemical experiments. Here we 
have the first distinctl}^ graphic application of Schulze's experiment, 
and nothing else of the kind is given by Hooper. For the purpose of 
this experiment the cut-out stencils (or, as Schiendl calls them, " nega- 
tives") were more suitable than the positive prints or projections used 
by Wedgwood and Davy. No thought of lixing or of multipl3dng 
copies of his light images seems to have occurred to Schulze or to an}^ 
of those who described his experiment, and, indeed, from the nature 
of it, it was not likely to do so. In this sense he certainh^ fell short of 
the photographic ideal which Davy and Wedgwood undoubtedly had 
before them. 

scheele's observations. 

In 1777 Carl Wilhelm Scheele published his well-known observations 
and experiments on air and lire (Aeris atque Ignis examen chemicum, 
Upsala and Lips, 1777), of which translations were published in Ger- 
man, French, and English. He also was a believer in the prevailing 
theory of light being a body, and that the light of the sun was the 
same as of a burning candle. He sets himself to prove the presence 
of an inflammable principle in light (sec. 60), and starts with the 
blackening of a solution of silver nitrate exposed to the sun on a piece 
of chalk, noting that reflected white light produces the same efl'ect, 
but heat does not; then he asks whether this black color should be 
real silver, and in the following sections describes a series of experi- 
ments he made to prove it. The most important, photographically, 
are in section 63, in which he describes how he first of all prepared 
silver chloride by precipitation with sal aumioniac from solution of 
the nitrate, washed and dried the precipitate, and exposed it on paper 
to the sun for two weeks, when the surface of the white powder grew 
black. The powder was then stirred and the operation repeated 
several times. He then poured some caustic spirit of sal ammoniac 
upon the darkened chloride, and found that the annuonia dissolved a 
quantit}' of the chloride, though some black powder remained. This 
was washed and dissolved in pure nitrous acid and was again precipi- 
tated as luna cornea. Consequently the blackness which the luna 
cornea acquires from the sun's light, and likewise the solution of silver 
poured on chalk, is siher by reduction. In further experiments he 
showed that during the exposure of luna cornea to light under water 
the latter takes up muriatic acid, which can be proved by its again 
precipitating luna cornea m a solution of silver nitrate; also that 



348 - THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGKAPHY. 

liina cornea, when expo.sed to liyht, moistened with nitric acid, docs 
not change color. In section •'>('. lie demonstrates the presence of 
phlogiston in light, and shows that light itself is not phlogiston by 
placing- in the colored rays of the solar spectrum paper on which some 
luna cornea had been spread, when it w-as found that the darkening 
took place much more rapidh' in the violet rays than in the others; 
i. e., the calx of silver more quickl}^ separates the phlogiston from, the 
violet than from the other rays. He thus shows that light can not be 
considered as a simple substance or an element. These observations 
of Scheele's, scanty as they are, mark a very distinct advance in photo- 
chemical knowledge, and demonstrate fully the decompositions that 
take place by the exposure of silver compounds to light, so far as the. 
imperfect chemical theories of the time allowed. It may ))e noted that 
Scheele did not discover the solubility of silver chloride in ammonia, 
as it apparently was known to some of the alchemists, and, as we have 
seen, is distinctly mentioned by Glauber and I^emery; also, in 1761, 
b}^ Marggraf, who describes the preparation of anunonia (spiritum 
urinosum), and says that he can onh^ sa}' of it that it dissohc^s luna 
cornea in the cold. (Chymischer Schriften, pp. «)2 and 28-1.) 

SENEBIER AND PHOTOMETRY. 

Scheele's observations were repeated and developed further ))y Jean 
Senebier, but more particularly with reference to the influence of light 
on vegetation. His book, Memoires Plu'sico-chymiques sur Tinfluence 
de la lumiere solaire pour modifier les .etres des- trois regnes de la 
Nature, et surtout ceux du regne vegetal (1782), contains a vast num- 
ber of interesting- observations on the disengagement of air or gas 
from leaves under water in sunshine, on the production and devel- 
opment of confervte in water, on etiolation and the effects of colored 
lights and of the different colored rays of the spectrum on the growth 
of plants. He recognized the greater activity of the violet ray. He 
preceded Herschel in the examination of the temperature of the differ- 
ent rays of the spectrum but failed to note the special heating power 
of the ultra-red rays or the extension of action beyond the violet. In 
the latter case he placed the chloride in saucers and threw the spectrum 
on them. Had he used strips of paper he would probably have 
observed the ultra-violet rays. In many of his experiments he used 
cut-out masks or shades of metal or other material to cut off the light 
of the sun from fruit or plants under observation. He, like others of 
his time, believed that light w^as a material substance, and also in the 
existence of phlogiston, so that it is sometimes difficult to translate his 
meaning- into conformity with modern ideas. 

He investigated the changes of color in various woods by the action 
of light, using slips of sheet lead as shades, also glazed boxes fitted 
with various colored y-lasses or different thicknesses of the same glass. 



THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 3-19 

He also used colored ribbons or papers in ditferent thicknesses to grad- 
uate the amount and color of the light falling on the woods, and thus 
appears to have been the first to use a ])hotometer. He foiuid that 
the change of color was due to the resinous constituents of the wood 
and the liability to change depended on the amount of resin present. 
He does not seem to have made any o])servations on changes in the 
solu))ility of resins after exposure to light, but apparenth' recognized 
that the light brought about an oxidation, and that some resins are 
bleached while others are darkened. 

In the fourteenth memoir (Vol. HI, p. 184) lie discusses the action 
of light on mineral substances and, after Ijriefl}- noting its action on 
several metallic compounds, he deals, in section 3, page 192, with 
the compounds of silver, and especially the chloride (luna cornea). 
He refers to the previous work of Beccari, Meyer, Schulze, and 
Scheele, and proposes to extend it. Not content with the simple 
experiment with a cut-out stencil of sheet brass, he instituted a series 
of pliotometric observations, b}^ exposing the chloride under a varying 
number of thicknesses of paper or slips of difierent woods or of glass. 
He confirmed Scheele's experiment with the spectrum and extended 
it by measuring the length of time it took each ray to darken the 
chloride, and found that while the more refrangible rays at the blue 
end only took from fifteen to thirty-five seconds the less refrangible 
from the yellow to the red required from five and one-half to twenty 
minutes. 

Valuable and interesting as Senebier's observations are as a contri- 
bution to the science of vegetable physiology, they did not advance 
photography very much, except in so far as they marked the intro- 
duction of a system of photometric measurement, which in recent 
years has been recognized as the only reliable basis of scientific 
photographic investigation, and perhaps no one has contributed more 
to this than our esteemed president, Sir William Abney. 

BERTHOLLET, 

In the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1785 Berthollet pulj- 
lished some researches on the action of light ujion plants, etc., as well 
as upon silver chloride under water, and attributed the darkening of 
the silver salt to a partial reduction of the metal caused by the disen- 
gagement of oxj'gen loosely combined with it. He explains this as 
being conformable to a law of afiinit}' under which the adherence of 
any element increases in proportion as its quantity grows less, and 
remarks that gold, silver, and mercury are precipitated on animal 
substances in this medium state between the oxide and the metal. 
Doctor Eder notes that Berthollet was thus the first to suggest the 
formation of a subchloride or oxysubchloride by the action of light 
on silver chloride. Berthollet's views were afterw^ards chaue-ed more 



350 THE BEGINNIISIGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 

in coiit'orniitv with Schcele's ob,scr\;iti()ii that hydrochloric ucid was 
found in the water after oxpo.surc of the clilori(Ui to light. (Essai de 
Stati(iue Ciiinii(|iie, ISOo.) He also found that the ])lackened chloride 
dissolved in annnonia as well as the white and was unchanged. There 
was, therefore, no disenoagemeut of oxygen from the chloride, tlie 
gas l)ul)l)les noticed being due to air adhering to it. This was further 
proved by melting some ])lackened chloride in a retort, as Avell as ])y 
exposing some Avhite chloride to a moderate heat till it blackened 
before melting. In both cases hydrochloric acid was evolved, but no 
oxj'gen. It appears, therefore, that light sim})ly ))rings a)>out the 
separation of a portion of the h3alrochloric acid coml)ined with the 
silver, and the same effect can l)e produced })y heat. Another portion 
of white chloride set in a dark place in a current of air darkened 
almost as ({uickly as if light had acted upon it. The air, therefore, 
had caused the disengagement of part of the hydrochloric acid, which 
must escape if the chloride blackens, and this result can l)e brought 
about in Aarious ways. We ma}^ note that Stahl (Anweisung zur 
Metallurgie, 1720) mentions this remarka))le volatility of the precipi- 
tated chloride and its visible fuming and loss of substance when 
exposed to a strong current of air. In another work he also notes the 
darkening and volatilization of luna cornea when heated with access 
of air, and attributes the change of color to the action of sulphur. 

Some experiments by the Abbe A. M. Vassali, described in two 
papers entitled "Parailele de la Lumiere Solaire avec celle du Feu 
comumn," published in Vol. V of the Memoirs of the Turin Academy 
(1791-92), may be noticed. He shows that precipitated silver chloride 
can be darkened, though slowly, bv the flame of a lamp as well as by 
solar rays; also that it could be slightl}^ darkened by the light of the 
full moon, especially if it were concentrated ])y a lens. (This result 
was disputed ))}' subsequent observers.) He concludes, therefore, that 
the light of the moon is the same as that of a flame or of sunlight, but 
not so intense. He used the chloride taken moist from a bottle and 
spread on unsized paper. In the second paper, he describes an experi- 
ment made to ascertain the loss of weight in the dr}^ chloride after 
exposure to light, and how on concentrating the sunlight with a lens 
the chloride was partly reduced to metal. 

MRS. FULIIAME. 

More closely connected with photograph}- is the work of Mrs. Ful- 
hame, as desci'ibed in her book. An Essay on Cond)ustion, with a view 
to a new Art of Dying and Painting, etc. (1794). She began her 
experiments in 1780 in making cloths of gold, silver, and otiier metals 
by chemical i)rocesses. She also prepared maps in which the I'ivers 
were shown in silver and the towns, etc., in gold, and it is evident 



THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 351 

from this and from the title of her book that she had an idea of the 
g-raphic application of reducing- solutions of silver and gold upon silk. 
It is surprising, therefore, to lind that she does not seem to have 
thought of making patterns on her silken tissues by using stencils. 
She refers to Doctor I^ewis's experiments, alread}^ noticed, and could 
have got the idea from his account of Schulze's experiment. There 
is, however, no mention of it, and she, like her predecessors, treated 
the question of the reduction of metallic salts or solutions bv light 
almost entirel}^ from its chemical side. Though at fault as regards 
her ideas of the nature of light, she made a great many very interest- 
ing experiments on the reduction of gold and silver b}^ chemical proc- 
esses, as well as I)}" the action of light on pieces of silk treated with 
solutions of chloride of gold or nitrate of silver. She found that light 
had little or no action on them when they were carefully dried before 
exposure, while if the}^ were moistened with water, the metal was very 
easil}^ reduced. She concluded, therefore, that the presence of water 
was necessary to effect the reduction, as it also was in the case of other 
reducing- agents she tried, including h3^drogen gas, phosphorus, sul- 
phur, and some of its volatile compounds, charcoal, acids, etc. The 
favoring effect of moisture in the case of the reduction of gold and 
silver by light, had, as we have alread}" seen, been noticed bv Du Fay 
and Lewis, but not investigated as it was by Mrs. Fulhame. 

The account of her experiments with light is in the eighth chapter 
of her book (p. 142), headed '"Reduction of Metals b}" Light." She 
first shows by experiments with strips of silk treated with solutions of 
nitro-muriate of gold and nitrate of silver, dried and suspended over 
water and kept in darkness for three months, that water alone has not 
the power of reducing metals at the ordinary temperature of the air. 
She then describes a series of parallel experiments with strips of silk 
treated with solutions of the same salts; (3 and 7) dried in the air and 
suspended in a window exposed to the sun for about three months, 
both showing considerable darkening and partial reduction, stronger 
with the silver than the gold; (-1 and 8) dried and suspended in cr^'stal 
phials over dry carbonate of potash, the phials being sealed with wax 
and exposed to the sun as before, both strips showing onlv a very 
slight reduction on the exposed side of the silk; (5 and 10) the slips 
after being dipped in the solutions of gold and silver were placed upon 
china plates and exposed to the sun, ))eing kept wet with water during 
the exposure. In the case of the gold thi^ color soon changed to purple 
and after an hour the silk was covered witii a coating of bright reduced 
gold. With siher the silk also soon darkened and in four hours had 
accjuired a blackish-gray color, l)ut further exposure was required to 
show particles of silver on the undei- side of the silk; (O and 11) the 
slips were dipped in alcoholic solutions of the gold and silver salts and 



352 THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 

exposed in the sumo way on china plates, but kept luoi.st witli alcohol. 
In the case of the gold no change took place in an hour. The experi- 
ment was interrupted l)y want of sun, and on subsequent exposure there 
was a faint change of color and some reduced gold. With silver there 
was more darkening, up to rc^ldish brown, but no l)lackening after 
four days' exposure. In (i>) a sli}) of silk was dipped in alcoholic solu- 
tion of silver nitrate and after veiy careful drying in darkness over 
sulphuric acid in a phial was exposed to light over the acid for about 
three months without the slightest change of color. 

From these experiments she concludes: (1) That water is essential 
to the n^duction of metals by light; (2) that light does not reduce 
metals by giving them phlogiston; nor (8) by fusing and expelling 
their oxygen; (4) light is a combustible body, for it acts like hydro- 
gen, piiosphorus, sul})hur, and charcoal in the reduction of metals, 
and further, that it is obvious that light reduces metals b^- decompos- 
ing water attracting the oxygen, while the h3'drogen unites, in its 
nascent stiite, to the oxygen of the metal and reduces it, forming at the 
same time a quantity" of water eipial to that decomposed. In chapter 
10 she gives an intelligent explanation of the decomposition of water 
which takes place when silver is precipitated in the metallic^ form hy 
ii'on and other metals, the precipitant uniting with the oxygen, while 
the hydrogen combines with the oxygen of the precipitated metal, 
forming water, and reduces the metal. 

These principles are applical)le in the same wa}' to the reduction of 
silver by acid iron solutions, as in the wet collodion process. She also 
notes the reducing powei- of gallic, tartaric, and formic acids on 
metallic salts. In considtn-ing her work it imist l)e remembered that 
chemical science was in a very transitional state at the time she wrote, 
but it is interesting ])ecause it led to further investigation of the action 
of light on silver compounds b}^ Count Kumford, liitter, Berthollet, 
and others. Her little treatise was translated into German by Lentin, 
and fa\'orably reviewed by Ritter. A ver}- appreciative accoiuit of 
the experiments with light is to be found in Placidus Heinrich's prize 
essay, " Von der Natur und den Eigenschaften des Lichtes" (St. Peters- 
burg, ISOcS. p. lo6). We find several of her experiments repeated in 
a little ])()ok of chemical recreations (Rational Amusement, by W^. M. 
Toulmin, Calcutta, 1822), among them methods of drawing silver or 
gold figures of flowers, etc., upon silken ribbons. Many of her obser- 
vations were confirmed and extended by Count Rumford in a paper 
entitled "An iiKjuiry concerning the chemical properties that have 
been attrilnited to light'' (Phil. Trans. R. S., 1798), in which he tried 
to show that the reduction of the gold or silver on the tissues was 
produced, not by any chemical combination of the matter of light with 
such bodies, but merely by the heat which is generated or excited by 
the light that is absorbed bv them.

BLACK. 

In Dr. Joseph Black's Lectures on the Elements of Chemistry 
(2, 600), he hiis fully treated of the salts and best known ores of silver 
and discussed the action of lig-ht in chano-ing- the color of the chloride 
and permanently staining organic and mineral substances moistened 
with the nitrate. His explanation is similar to Doctor Lewis's, and he 
saj'S those bodies to which the solution is a])plied attract the acid 
from the calcined silver, while at the same time this metal is restored 
to its metallic state, or made to approach that state, by the action of 
the light, A\ hich expels from the calx a ([uantity of vital air. Tliis 
effect of light in this and other similar examples is well known ])y 
experience, but it is not clearly understood how it is produced. Of 
the chloride he says that if perfectl}' dr}' and white it will not change 
its color in air that is also perfectly dry, although accessible to light, 
and then he discusses Scheele's and Berthollet's experiments upon it. 
These lectures were written before 1796. 

WILLIAM HEHSCHEL AND KITTP^R. 

In 1800 William Herschel, following somewhat in the footsteps of 
Senebier, discovered the heat rays beyond the visible red rays, by 
means of thermometrical observations, and this discovery was followed 
in 1801 by the almost more important one, so far as photography is 
concerned, made by J. W. Ritter of the invisible ultra-violet rays and 
of their strong chemical action upon salts of silver. The first account 
of these results appears in an extract from a letter from Herren Rit- 
ter and Bockmann, in Gilbert's Annalen, Volume VII, 1801, page 527, 
discussing HerschePs results. He (Ritter) says: ""On February 22, 
I also came upon solar rays on the violet side of the color spectrum 
and beyond it, and indeed proved it b}^ means of horn silver. They 
reduce even more strongly than the violet light itself, and the extent 
of these rays is very great." A further conmmnication was made in 
the Erlangen Literatur Zeitung, 1801, No. 16, page 121, and a complete 
account of the investigations was given in a paper read before the 
Jena Society for the Investigation of Nature, in the spring of 1801 
(reprinted in the collected works of Ritter, Physisch-Chemisch 
Abhandlungen, II, 81). It is entitled "Remarks on HerscheFs recent 
researches on light," and is a most interesting paper, more so as 
regards the chemical action of the red and violet ends of the spec- 
trum than for any photographic application. 

As the thermometrical method used b}^ Herschel for showing the 
extension of the spectrum at the red end would have been useless in 
investigating an extension of the violet end, where changes of tem- 
perature are not indicated, Ritter, noting Schecle's observation that 
horn silver, or nuiriate of silver, darkened much moi-c rapidly in the 



354 THE BEGlNNINaS OF PHOTOGEAPHY. 

violet than in iiny other ray of the spectrum, follo^ved his method. 
A strip of strong- white paper was coated very eveidy ])y means of a 
brush witli precipitated silver chloride iineh' rul)bed down Avith water 
into a seuiifluid mao-ma. When exposed moist in a dark room to the 
solar spectrum of a prism, it at once quickly darkened at a considerable 
distance beyond the outer violet, then in the violet itself, and finally 
showed the weakest action in that part where the l)lue loses itself in 
the green. Through the yellow and red and on l)eyond, the chloride 
remained white, however long it might be exposed. 

This experiment, he says, shows the presence of invisible rays 
beyond the violet in continuation of the visi])le rays, and possessing 
the same action, and that, just as is shown at the red end by the ther- 
mometer, their maxinuun action lies beyond the limit of the visible 
ra3's and at a considerable distance from them. In the same way as 
the heating action shown by the thermometer is almost confined to 
the red end of the spectrum, so the darkening action on the chloride 
is almost entirely confined to the blue and violet. He remarks that 
Scheele must have made his observation very casually not to have 
noticed that in half the spectrum there was no action at all, and it is 
to be regretted that he overlooked this fact and the physical and 
chemical phenomena connected with it. 

He then discusses the chemical nature of the change in the horn 
silver, which consists of nuu'iatic acid and silver oxide (silver and 
oxygen). By the blackening of this substance the silver loses its oxy- 
gen, and, since it can not remain coml)ined with the ncid. reverts to the 
metallic state, appearing black on account of its being finely divided. 
Consequently what occurred on the blue side of the spectrum was 
deoxidation, one of the two great processes into which every chemical 
reaction finally resolves itself. Its opposite is oxidation. Seeing 
that the deoxidation took place only at the l)lue end of the spectrum, 
the question A\as whether corresponding oxidation took place at the 
red end. He set himself to prove it by exposing a strip of paper 
coated with the chloride, but already evenly darkened in the violet or 
other part of the blue end, so tliat the red rays fell on the darkened 
part, comparing it from time to time with a similarly darkened strip. 
He found that near the red and I^CA'ond it there was a place at which 
the darkened strip became distinct!}' paler, and it gradually spread 
till, after a (juarter of an hour, the middle of the spectrum had 
retained its original tint, Avhich became gradually weaker until it 
almost disappeared at a point beyond the red and then increased again 
for a short space. 

From this he argues that the loss of color in the darkened chloride 
was due to oxidation of the silver, and that therefore the red raj's 
have oxidizing properties, agreeing very closely in gradation with 
that of the rise and fall of temperature in HerschePs experiments. 



THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 355 

Thus the whoh> })ri>smatic .spectrum acquires a new dignit}' as chem- 
ical. In whit(> light, both forces, oxidation and the characteristic 
deoxidation, are in a state of opposite combination. The whole spec- 
trum is divided into two parts, the sphere of the one toward the 
red being- oxidation, and of the other, toward the blue, deoxidation. 

In a third experiment a long, darkened strip of the chloride paper was 
placed in the spectrum for tive or ten minutes, when the outer ends of 
the strip were found unchanged; but the whole blue and violet side had 
darkened, the maximum being beyond the visible violet ra3^s, as in the 
first experiment. The whole of the red end, on the contrary, became 
lighter, and the maximum bleaching action was, as before, beyond the 
visible red rays. Similar results were obtained by exposing a strip of 
the white chloride paper in aliright light and at the same time throw- 
ing the spectrum upon it. 

After discussing the relative oxidizing and deoxidizing powers of the 
two ends of the spectrum and expressing his desire for exact measure- 
ments of the intensity of the energy of the various rays throughout 
the spectrum, as well as of its extent, he says that in chemistry it is 
known that Avator is the chemical medium in all j^rocesses of oxidation 
and deoxidation ])v the wet method. By it alone can the oxidizable be 
oxidized and the oxidized deoxidized, and in both cases decomposition 
of the water takes place. In the first case the oxygen combines with 
the oxidizable body and the hydrogen is set free or combines with an}" 
oxygen present in a free or combined state to form water anew. In 
the second case tlie hydrogen of the water combines with the oxygen 
of the oxidizal)le ])ody to form water, while the oxygen formerh' com- 
bined with the hvdrogen of the water goes to the oxidizable body 
present, the deoxidation of which it usually only indirectly brings 
about. The active agent in the hrst is therefore oxygen, and in the 
second is something which possesses the same strong affinity for 
oxygen as hydrogen, or is hydrogen itself. He gives as a parallel 
the decomposition of water by electricity or magnetism. In a later 
paper he completes the parallel by showing that if the two poles of a 
voltaic pile are placed in half -blackened silver oxide or chloride the 
negative polo increases the darkening, while the positive entireh' pre- 
vents it. Perfecth' dry horn sih'er appears to remain perfectly 
unchanged in sunlight in consequence of the want of water to be 
decomposed and supply the hydrogen necessary for the reduction. In 
this theory of the action of water he (juite supports the theory put 
forward ])y Mrs. Fulhame. The fact that perfectly dry silver chloride 
exposed in a vacuum remains white has ))een proved by Sir VV^illiam 
Abney. 

Although it appeai-s from a later paper that Ritter saw how impor- 
tant his results would l)e in connection with the action of light on 
organic bodies, it is curious that he made no similar experiments with 



356 THE BEGINNINGS OF FBOTOGKAPHY. 

resinous and other organic substances shown l)y kSeneliier to bo sensi- 
tive to light. He makes no mention of Sene])ier; but, had lie known 
of his work, he would probabl}' have done so, as he recognized that all 
bodies were more or less sensitive to light. 

Kitter must have been one of the tirst to recognize the electrical 
nature of sunlight and the unit}^ of principle in the i)olarity of chem- 
istry, electricity, magnetism, and heat. I can not now dwell upon this 
aspect of his work, but in the light of modern physico-chemical science 
it seems worth}^ of attention. 

DOt^TOR WOLLASTON. 

The existence of the ultra violet rays ygns also noticed by Dr. J. H. 
Wollaston in 1801, about the same time as they were observed b}' 
Ritter. In a note to a conununication to the Eoyal Societ}' (Phil. 
Trans., 1S02, p. ;-i79), he says: 

Although what I have above described comprises the whole of the prismatic spec- 
trum that can he rendered visible, there also pass on each side of it other rays 
whereof the eye is not sensible. From Doctor Herschel's experiments (Phil. Trans., 
1800) we learn that on one side there are invisible rays occasioning heat that are less 
refrangil^le than red light, and on the other I have myself observed (and the same 
remark has been made by ]\Ir. Ritter) that there are likewise invisible rays of another 
kind tliat are more refracted than the violet. It is by their chemical effects alone 
that the existence of these can be discovered, and l)y far the most delicate test of 
their presence is the white muriate of silver. 

To Scheele, among many valuable discoveries, we are indebted for having first 
duly distinguished between radiant heat and light (Traits de I'Air et du Feu, sees. 
56, 57), and to him also we owe the observation that when muriate of silver is exposed 
to the common prismatic spectrum it is blackened more in the violet than in any 
other kind of light (sec. 66). In repeating this experiment I found that the black- 
ness extended not only through the space occupied by the violet, but to an equal 
degree and to al)Out an equal distance beyond the visible sj)ectrum, and that by 
narrowing tlie pencil of light received on the prism the discoloration may be made 
to fall almost entirely l)eyond the violet. 

In a sul)sequent communication to Nicholson's Journal (Vol. VIII, 
1801:, p. l2l>3), he explains that in the above note he w^as careful to 
express the power exerted ])y the most refrangible ra^'s on nuiriate of 
silver in general terms as chemical, not merely f i-om a doubt whether 
they would in other cases produce a corresponding etfect. but becaitse 
he had at that time made experiments which proved that the same ra3^s 
which cause the emission of oxygen by nuiriate of silvi^' occasion its 
a])soi-ption \)y the resin usually called gum guaiacum. wliich turns 
green by absorption of oxygen when exposed in the air to sunshine, 
and consequently he ol)jected to Ritter's designation of the ultra violet 
ra3\s as disoxidizing. 

He adopted an ingenious method of obtaining prismatic images for 
the purpose of his experiments, and in this way must have been one of 
the first to produce a photographic image on silver chloride by means 



THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 357 

of a len.s. Over a lens seven inches in diameter and about twenty- 
four and one-fourth inches focus he pasted a circular piece of paper 
liaving its radius one-tenth of an inch less than that of the lens, 
thus leaving" a prismatic annulus corresponding in the length of its 
circumference to a prism twenty-two inches long, so arranged by 
its circular form that anj^ one of the colors might at pleasure 
l)e Ijrought to a focus, or the spectrum could be received on a ring 
of any diameter required by mere variation of the distance of the 
lens. At short distances the exterior margin of the spectrum was 
red and the violet within; at greater distances than the focus the order 
of the colors was reversed, the violet being on the margin and the red 
within. With this apparatus he found that the etfect on nuiriate of 
silver was much accelerated. At distances short of twenty-two and 
one-fourth inches a ring was produced, at twenty-two and one-half a 
circular dark- colored spot, and at about twenty-three inches appeared 
to be the focus of these rays, as the spot was then smallest; at twent}"- 
three and one-half it was larger, at twenty-four and one-fourth it again 
became a ring shaded to the center, and at twenty- four and one-half 
(unless the paper had been wetted) the center remained completely 
white, though strongly illuminated. He was, however, unable to 
restore the white color to the muriate after it had once been tinged, 
however slightly, by exposure to the most refrangible rays. Similar 
experiments were tried with the gum guaiacum on paper tinged with 
an alcoholic solution of the gum. 

THOMAS AVKDGWOOD. 

We now come to Thomas Wedgwood's experiments. Though they 
may have been carried out some A'ears l)efore they were published, I 
have thought it better to discuss them in order of the date of their 
publication hy Davy in 1802. Miss Meteyard mentions (Life of 
Wedgwood, 2, 586) with regard to Thomas Wedgwood's early work: 
"His father early in 1774 had used the camera obscura for taking 
views for the Russian service, and Doctor (Matthew) Turner, of 
Liverpool, as it was well known, had either invented or brought to 
toleral)le pei-fection the art of copying prints upon glass by striking 
oflf impressions with a colored solution of silver and tixing them on 
the glass by baking on an iron plate in a heat siifficient to incorporate 
the solution with the glass. 'SMth knowledge thus ()))tained and 
o])Scrvation directed, it amounts to absolute certainty that Thomas 
Wedgwood, during some of his experiments on the production of light 
from different bodies by heat and attrition, made certain discoveries 
which led practically to the first principles of photograph}'. '' She 
goes on to discuss his subsequent experiments with Davy and the 
difficulty of tixing the images, and falls into the mistake about the two 



358 THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 

early photographs, supposed to be by T. Wedgwood, which were 
brought before this society in 1863, and are now in the society's col- 
lection. Where she got the information about Dr. Matthew Turner's 
burnt-in silver prints she does not say, and I have not l)een able to 
find any other reference to them. 

We find, however, that the intimacy between Doctor Turner and 
the Wedgwoods began in 1702, and afterwards that he compounded 
varnishes, fumigations, bronze powders, and other chemical appliances 
for Josiah Wedgwood. In a letter from Wedgwood to Bentle}-, about 
1767, he says: "One of the fumigations is a most excellent enamel 
color — so line a j^ellow that 1 have some hopes of the great work 
being perfected, and that we shall be able to turn even the dirt under 
our feet into gold." Now there is a great deal about glass staining 
with silver and other yellow enamels in Doctor Lewis's Philosophical 
Commerce of the Arts (1763) alread}^ noticed, and it is quite possible 
that Doctor Turner ma}^ have used this source of information. There 
is evidence to show that T. Wedgwood was engaged in experiments 
on the reduction of silver for the ornamentation of pottery al)out 
1790. Miss Mcteyard says (op. cit., ii, 585): "To solve some problems 
connected with light he used silver differently prepared, and his obser- 
vations thereon led to, the inv^ention of what was termed 'silvered 
ware,' namely, a pattern of dead or burnished silver upon a black 
earthenware body. We tirst hear of this ware in 1701." She gives 
an engraving of a tea traj' ornamented with patterns which could 
easily have been obtained from stencils, and it may be noted that 
whereas the previous experimenters in this direction had mostly l)een 
chemists, young Wedgwood had ver}^ strong artistic instincts, and 
being accustomed to prepare designs for pottery would more natu- 
rally be led to the pictorial application of the old methods of obtain- 
ing images by the reduction of silver salts. There was no discovery 
of any new principle in this reduction, but the application of it to 
copying drawings on paper b}" contact or in the camera was a distinct 
and marked advance toward practical photograph}^ of which the whole 
credit is undoubtedly due to Wedgwood. We find confirmator}" evi- 
dence that silver pictures were being made about this time in a letter 
from James Watt to Josiah Wedgwood, written apparently in 1790 
or 1791, and beginning thus: "Dear Sir: I thank you for your instruc- 
tions as to the silver pictures, about which when at home I will make 
some experiments." 

There is some doubt al)out the date of this letter, Mr. Litchfield put- 
ting it as above (Tom Wedgwood, p. ISO), while Miss Meteyard notes 
it as docketed "Hand Mill— 1799'' (CJroup of Englishmen, p.' 150) and 
says it was written a few days after AVatt visited Etruria, in 1799, on 
business connected with a hand mill. From correspondence with 
Leslie, moreover, it seems probable that the early experiments were

resumed about this date or in 1800. Writing- to T. Wedgwood in 
Novem])er, 1800, Leslie mentions an object glass for the solar micro- 
scope and some painted glass which had been left for him at the 
W^edgwood House, in York street, St. James square, and Wedgwood 
came to town about the same time. Davy could not have taken part 
in these experiments, l)ecause he was still at Bristol, but they w^ere 
old acquaintances, and Davy may have advised him. In Wedgwood's 
earlier experiments of 1790 he no doubt had the assistance of Chisholm, 
who, as we have seen alread}^ knew a good deal about the reduction 
of silver and other metals by light. Davy mentions in the paper pub- 
lished in the Journal of the Royal Institution for 1802 that to cop3^ 
the images formed by means of a camera obscura was Wedgwood's 
first object in his researches, and for this purpose he used the nitrate 
of silver, which was mentioned to him by a friend as a substance ver}" 
sensible to the influence of light, but the images thus formed in the 
camera were too faint to produce any effect on the nitrate of silver, 
and all his numerous experiments to this primary end proved un- 
successful. 

From the scanty details of the experiments given b}^ Davy in this 
paper it is very difficult to ascertain clearl}^ the relative share that 
Wedgwood and Davy had in producing the results obtained. It is 
evident from the above that the idea of reproducing the images formed 
in the camera obscura was Wedgwood's own, for he had been familiar 
with the use of it from his youth, and his first experiments were no 
doubt made with paper washed over with a solution of silver nitrate. 
For certain sul)jects, copjdng paintings on glass, or making delinea- 
tions of objects parth^ opaque and parti}" transparent in texture, such 
as leaves, or wings of insects, etc., white leather was found preferable 
to paper, because it was more sensitive, the tanned gelatine no doubt 
acting as an accelerator. Davy, however, says that in following 
these processes he found that the images of small objects produced 
by the solar microscope might be copied without difficult}^ on paper, 
but it was necessary that the paper should be but a small distance 
from the lens. He notes also that the muriate of silver was more sen- 
sitive than the nitrate and both were more readily acted on when 
moist than when dry, a fact long known. The advantage of the nitrate 
was its s()lul>ility, but leather or paper could ])e impregnated with the 
muriate by diffusing it through water and applying it in this form 
(as Hitter did) or by immersing paper moistened with the solution of 
the nitrate in very dilute nuiriatic acid. 

In dis(;ussing the difficulty of preventing the uncolorcd parts of the 
copies or profiles from being acted on by light, even after repeated 
washings, on account of some of the saline matter still adhering to the 
white parts of the paper or leather and causing them to darken on 
exposure to the sun, he says, "It is probable that both in the case of 
SM 1903 24 



360 THE BEGINNINGS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 

the nitrate iiiid the nmriate, a portion of the metallic oxide abandons 
its acid to (Miter into union with the animal or vegetable su])stance, so 
as to form with it an insolu])le compound. If so, it was not improl)al)lc 
that substances might be found capable of destroying this compound 
either by simple or comi)Ound afHnities. He had imagined some 
experiments on the subject and hoped to publish them later." In con- 
clusion he says: "Nothing but a method of preventing the unshaded 
parts of the delineation from l)eing colored l)v exposure to the day'is 
wanting to rendei" the process as useful as it is elegant.'' From this it 
is very evident that he fully appreciated the value of the process if only 
the difficulty of rendering the images permanent could be overcome. 

It is easy to understand that the want of sensitiveness on the one 
hand and on the other the difficulty of iixing the images were sufficient 
to render Wedgwood's original idea of reproducing objects in the 
camei'a quite inipractical)le with papers prepared with the nitrate or 
chloride of silver. Davy does not mention having tried any chemical 
method of fixing l)eyond repeated washings. In the case of the nitrated 
papers, washing with warm distilled water should have l)een sufficient 
to render the pictures fairly permanent; but it would not answer with 
the muriate, for which the only method available at the time would be 
treatment with solution of salt or of ammonia, both of which are 
unsatisfactory. Davy, being well acquainted with the previous work 
of Scheele, as is shown by his note in the paper, would have known of 
the solvent action of ammonia on the unexposed chloride, but, as 
Berthollet showed, it also attacks the exposed and darkened parts. 
Roliert Hunt says it can be used etiectively as a fix'ing agent for silver 
chloride or nitrate prints, but requires very great care in its use to 
avoid the solution of the reduced image. With chloride prints on 
paper prepared as described above, without any free silver, by brush- 
ing on the chloride (Talbot seems to have been the first to use the 
method of preparing the muriated paper by double decomposition with 
excess of silver) I found that the image was weak and only loosely 
adherent to the paper. 

After treatment with dilute solution of ammonia the coating dis- 
solved oil', leaving a faint gray image, formed, as Davy describes, 
b}' the combination of some of the silver with the organic material of 
the paper. A 10 per cent solution of connuon salt did not have the 
same solvent and clearing action as the anuuonia, and the paper dark- 
ened again readily in the light. The solvent action of hyposulphite of 
soda on salts of silver wwis not known till 1819, when Sir John Hcr- 
schel first drew attention to it. Under these circumstances one can 
not be surprised at Davy not following up the subject, he being fully 
occupied with his Royal Institution lectures, besides investigations 
and researches of greater importance at the time. He published the 
results of Wedgwood's invention with his own observations, as far as 



THE BEai]SnNriNC4S OB^ PHOTOGRAPHY. 361 

they went; and had he not done so, it is doul)tful whether tnere would 
have been any record of them at all, and Wedgwood would have lost 
all the credit that has always been considered justly due to him of 
being- the first to apply the well-known reduction of salts of silver by 
light to the reproduction of pictures and natural objects either b}' con- 
tact or in the camera. Like so many other discoverers, he was before 
his time, and it must be agreed that there is an immense gap between 
these imperfect and unsuccessful trials and the brilliant practical 
results achieved some years later by Daguerre, Reade, and Talbot, 
with the more sensitive iodide of silver, the use of which, it nmst be 
recollected, was rendered possible b}" Davy's investigation of Cburtois's 
discovery of iodine, and Herschel's, of an efficient and suitable fixing 
salt. To this ultimate success Wedgwood's early trials with the camera 
no doubt contributed as embod3'ing the first idea of practical photog- 
raphy of natural objects and demonstrating its possibility. 

At this point I must conclude my sketch. Although during the 
intermediate period, V)etween Wedgwood, in 1802, and Daguerre and 
Talbot, in 1839, no marked progress was made in practical photogra- 
phy, immense strides were made in the chemistry and optics connected 
with it, so that it was gradually being made possible and practicable. 
A record of these advances would appropriately form another chapter 
in this historv.

Bv Prof. CiiAKi.Ks Lapwokth, LL. D., F. R. 8. 



We stand to-daj, gentlemen, at the beginning- of a new century. 
The science of geolog}^, whose devotees we are, is one of the 3"oungest 
of the great faniil}^ of the sciences. The years since tirst it Ix'came 
conscious of its being are but few in number, and its struggle for 
existence has from the tirst been incessant. Yet I doubt not that 
there are many observers familiar with its history who woidd assert 
that " young as it is in years, it is already old in achievements, and 
that the roll of its discoveries and the number and extent of its con- 
quests stand almost unrivaled for their far-reaching influence upon 
the philosophy and the practice of mankind." 

But it is neither necessary nor dignified on our part here to-day to 
advance or even suggest this claim. For it is not our self-esteem 
which prompts our work, or the applause of the world that checn-s us 
in its pursuit. Rather is it the delight in the work itself which 
animates our labors; and it is in the s3anpathy and the appreciation 
of our fellow-workers that we rejoice when our aim is achieved. To 
geology and geologists do we stand or fall. 

That being so, 1 have asked myself, as your elected representative, 
whether it would not be good for us, as a united family of geologists 
met here together at the close of one era and the opening of the next, 
to take stock, as it were, of the work which geology has already 
accomplished, and note how we are prepared to face the tasks which 
the new era will demand of our science and of ourselves. 

But self -centered though Ave may be as individual geologists, and 
self-centered though we may consider our science, we share the com- 
mon lot of all men, and our science shares the common lot of all the 
sciences. As individuals we receive from our fellow-men all that 
makes for our social well-being, and our science owes its very exist- 
ence, and most of the conditions that make for its progress, to the aid 
and sympath}^ afforded by its fellow -sciences. 

We have, therefore, no right to make this prospect or retrospect in 
the family privacy of our own science without regard to the feelings

or the claims of others. Geolog^^ has not onl>' its privileges, but also 
its duties, and the entire world of science and practice has the right 
of demanding a justification of the faith that is in us. Nor do 1 think 
that it asks two nmch if it insists upon a categorical answer to the 
questions, What is this geology of which we are so proud and so confi- 
dent? What has it done for the mental or material benetit of the 
human race? and on what grounds does it justify its claim to respect 
and support as one of the factors in the advance of humanity i 

Far l)e it from me to presume to attempt to reply on your ])ehalf to 
questions of so serious an imi)ort. That task must be left in part to 
the eloquent apologists of our science and in part to the results 
achieved by the great workers in geology — results that carry the 
answer with them. But on an occasion like the present I doubt 
wheth<n- ^ve can do anything better or more appropriate to the time 
than ha\t> a quiet but open talk together over the position and rela- 
tions of our science. 

I. — Geology and its Fellow-Sciences. 

GEOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY. 

In the words of one of the most devoted adherents of our science, 
we might say, '* without impropriety, that all the physical sciences are 
included under two great heads — astronomy and geology; the one 
comprehending all those sciences which teach us the constitution, the 
motions, the rehitive places, and the mutual action of the astra, or 
heavenly bodies, while the other singles out for study the one astrum 
on which we live, namely, the earth." 

This definition, if we may call it so, is one which is not only simple 
and convenient, l)ut it gives perhaps the broadest and clearest view of 
the place and mission of gfeology, regarded from an outside standpoint. 
And there is a naturalness in this association of geology and astron- 
oni}" which can not be ignored. 

Astronomy concerns itself with the whole of the visible universe, 
of which our earth forms but a relatively insignificant part; while 
geology deals with that earth regarded as an individual. Astronomy 
is the oldest of the sciences, while geology is one of the newest. But 
the two sciences have this in common — that to l)oth are granted a mag- 
nificence of outlook and an immensity of grasp denied to all the rest. 

Yet, compared with other sciences, few perhaps have so small a 
number of adherents and working members. It may be that this is 
due to the opinion of the majority both of the past and the present 
generation that these two sciences seem to demand for their success- 
ful prosecution an abnegation of emotion and of all human sympathies; 
their grandest results are not the conquests of the heart, but of the 
head, wrought out in the cold, dry light of reason. 



THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 365 

It is needless in these days to insist upon tlie fierce and pained 
resistance whicli both have encountered at almost ever}- fresh ad\ance. 
In spite of the fact that in the end ever}^ such advance has proved 
itself to l)e a higher stage in the mental or material progress of man- 
kind at large, there still exists, ev^en at the present time, an instinctive 
antagonism to astronomy and geology in the minds of many, especially 
from the sides of literature and of philosoph}". 

The bewildering immensities of space and time with which these 
two sciences deal, and their insistent claim to ])e the only autiiorities 
that can bring home to the mind of man the awful ideas of intinity 
and eternity, cause them to be shunned and dreaded by the man of 
letters, and wring now and again a wail of impotence and sadness from 
the poet: 

What be these two shapes high over the sacred fountain, 
Taller than all the muses, and higher than all the mountain? 
On these two peaks they stand, ever spreading and heightening. 

****** 

Look in their deep double sliadow, the crowned ones all disappearing! 
These are Astronomy and Geology^terrible Muses I 

But, while astronomy and geology share almost equally in the vague 
dread which they inspire in the minds of those who look onl}- at nature 
from the side of the emotional and the beautiful, they ])y no means 
share equally in the admiration instinctivel}' accorded l)y the average 
thinking man to the sciences in general. Along the whole range of 
the concrete sciences there is perhaps not one that has so effectually 
compelled the respect of men as astronomy. There is not one in whose 
progress they have taken so keen an interest, or whose conclusions 
have been so unhesitatingly accepted. On the other hand, everv new 
discovery arrived at by geology appears to have come upon the minds 
of men with something of the nature of a shock. The conclusions of 
our science seem rarely or never to have l)een accepted with pleasure 
because of their value or their grandeur, but rather to have been 
adopted with reluctance and regret and liecause they were found to 
be irresistible. 

Yet, after all, this is hardly a matter for astonishment, for it has 
its root in the origin and the growth of the two sciences themselves. 
Astronomy had its birth in the childhood of mankind, in the silence and 
calm of the night, and in the wonder of curiosity and awe. It carried 
with it from the verv first the mystic fascination of the distant and 
unknown. It was associated in man's mind with the peaceful hours 
of rest and of contemplation. It held within it much of the enthusi- 
asm and elevation of religion, for it lifted man's e3^es upward and 
heavenward, away from the never-ending struggle in the world below. 

Geology had none of these attractions.^ The world over which early 
man wandered was to him the theater of a never-endino- conflict, in 



366 THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 

which wero arrayed against him impassal)lc seas, unscalable moun- 
tains, oloomy forests peopled l>v deadly beasts of pi"(!y, raging streams 
and foaming torrents, each and all the haunts of spirits luring him to 
doom. 

What Avonder, then, that astronomy Avas one of the first of the 
sciences to come into Ijeing, and that the successive generations of 
mankind have mingled with an awe of her greatness a tender and 
respectful appreciation of her work and of her results? 

And it was l)ut natural that geology should be nonexistent until 
lono- after most of the other sciences had come into being and some 
had grown almost to maturity. Even when she at last appeared and 
thrust hei's(>lf, as it were, into the esta])lished aristocracy of the 
sciences, she brought with her the stigma of Ium' lowly origin. And 
to that she added much of the recklessness and assurance of youth 
and a bewildering absence of respect for the settled conventionalities 
of opinion and tradition. This is no excuse; but it is in its way a 
reason why she is still supposed to ])e som(nvhat of a parveiui among 
the sciences, and is often oidy listened to with patience because of her 
powers and her genius. 

But there is also another reason for the reluctance with which the 
conclusions of geology are received ])y men in general, when compared 
with the reception accorded to those of astronomy, namely, the rela- 
tive backwardness of the race in its appreciation of the concept of 
the extension of time as compared Avith its advanced appreciation 
of the concept of the extension of space. Note the willingness, and 
even the welcome, with which any average audience of the present day 
accepts the statements and sympathizes with the conclusions of an astro- 
nomical lecturer who demands for his remoter starry distances, it may 
b(\ myriads of millions of miles. Compare that reception with the 
coldness, or at all events the smiling incredulity, of the same audience 
when a geologist suggests for the development of all the geological 
formations at the very most a hundred millions of years. But it is 
not only the popular audience, l)ut also the majorit^y of the men of 
education and experi(Mice. who still feel this curious hesitation and 
dilHculty. And nothing perhaps has so retarded the reception of the 
higher conclusions of geology among men in general as this instinc- 
tive parsimony of the human mind in matters where time is concerned. 

Yet, after all, perhaps this is easily accounted for. It has l)een well 
said that "the intellectual advancement of men is due to the relatively 
small etfects of individual experiences added to the large effects of the 
experiences of the antecedent individuals." The concept of the vast- 
ness of space has ))ccn familiar to mankind for untold ages, and has 
grown and expandinl with the growth of the race. The concept of the 
immensity of time has entered so little into the intellectual develop- 
ment of mankind has a M'hole, and in its grander aspects so recently, 
that the race is as yet incapable of adeijuately grasping it. 



THE EELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 367 

The wanderings of early man from place to place and land to land 
soon familiarized him with the idea of the extension of space. He had 
learned by l)itter experience, times out of numher, that the distant 
horizon which to the eye bounded the ^ast canopy of the sky aliovc 
him was no l)oundary at all, l)ut shaded away in all directions into a 
limitless Avorld beyond, whose practical infinity had been proved to 
him by his own wanderings, and ])y those of his forefathers generation 
after generation. Thus the idea of the vastness of space had already 
become a part of man's intellectual equipment long before the origin 
of astronomy itself. And this idea has been deepened, broadened, 
and strengthened during the successive centuries of progress by the 
emplo^nnent of constantly improving instruments of accurate meas- 
urement, b}^ the invention of the telescope, the discoveries of geogra- 
phy, and by the application of the higher mathematics to astronomy 
as a whole. 

But early man (and, indeed, his successors even down to and beyond 
the Middle Ages) Avas miserably provided with the experiences which 
might bring home to his mind the immensity of time. Early man 
himself had for his longest trustworthy chronological base line a short 
seventy years — the span of his own existence — or at most, perhaps, a 
hundred 3'ears, if he included the experience of his parents. Even in 
classical times all the past was to his experience vague and indefinite. 
He had, it is true, mythical traditions of heroic ages, golden ages, and 
the like, but these when summed up were merel}^ the legendary total 
of the experiences of l)ut a few generations. Bound down as Avas 
man's mind by his anthropomorphic ideas, he naturally assigned to 
the earth and mankind a correspondingh' brief existence; a few gen- 
erations — a few centuries at the most — must have witnessed its birth; 
a few generations more must ineA'itably ))ring about its death and disap- 
pearance. Even since the invention of letters and the compilation of 
accurate historical .records the period of time of which man possesses 
experience, either personally or collectively, is at most a ver}^ few 
thousands of years. It is hopeless to expect, therefore, that for a long 
period to come the geological concept of the immensity of past time 
will permeate the minds of the many, or that they will accept the con- 
clusions of geology, where time is concerned, with the same confidence 
as that with which they have long since accepted the conclusions of 
astronom}'. 

But this intellectual backwardness of the race in the matter of the 
appreciation of the vastness of geological time is not onl}' a stumbing 
])lock in the way of th(> acceptance of the results of geology among 
the puldic at large, but :dso to tluMvorkers in other sciences, and even 
to t\w students of geology itself. It is well within the memory of 
many of us how even those holding the most advanced views in other 
sciences were intensel}^ reluctant to acknowledge the possibility of the 



368 THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 

existence of man upon the earth for more than a few thousands of years. 
And among the g('ok)oists of the precedino- generation the demand of 
the so-called ''uniforinitarians'" for those vast ieons which must be 
granted if the geological formations were accumulated and deposited 
at the same rate as corresponding accimmlations are Ijrought together 
at the present day, was only reluctanth" conceded by the majority after 
years of conflict and denial. Even at the present time it is the habit 
not only of eminent physicists, mathematicians, and chemists, but also 
of some of our geological authorities, to scout all reasonings that sug- 
gest a geological antiquity for our glo))e of more than a few millions of 
■j^ears. 

Far l)e it from me to suggest that geologists should be reckless in 
tlieii- drafts upon the bank of time; but nothing whatever is gained, 
and very much is lost, l>y persistent niggardliness in this direction. 
The astronomer, although persuaded of the possible inrinity of the 
universe, is just as careful in estimating the length of his grander 
base lines of millions of miles as is the geographical survej^or who 
takes years, it may be, to measure accuratel}" the length of a base line 
a few miles in extent l)efore he commences the triangulation of a single 
country. But the consciousness of the astronomer of the practical 
inlinity of his realms gives him a freedom of action in dealing with 
space which is delightful. In the same wa}^ the geologist, who is })lest 
with an assured conviction of the immensity of geological time, moves 
with an ease and freedom from cause to effect wholl}- denied to those 
wanting in this conviction. No doctrine in geology has resulted in 
such ])rilliance of discovery as the doctrine of uniformitarianisn), 
which sets no theoretical bounds either to the efficacy of present 
causes or to the duration of past time. It is not, however, the eternity 
of geological time that this doctrine demands, but the assumption of 
the vast duration of the geological periods of which it has been made 
up. And if to this assumption the geologist adds the conscientious 
accuracy of the geodesist and astronomer, and not only takes for pos- 
sible, but absolutely demonstrates T)}" discovery after discover}^ the 
true extent of the ieons that have gone to the making of the geological 
formations, he is cc^rtain to foster and eventually to establish in the 
minds of men a fidl and adequate conception of the immensity of geo- 
logical time. 

GEOLOCY IN PARTICULAR. 

I have said that the widest definition of geology is that it is that 
science which, leaving to astronomy the stud}' of the heavenly bodies 
as a society, devotes itself to the study of the earth as an individual; 
in other words, that it is a "geonomy" as contrasted with an 
"astronomy." But while this description is justifiable in principle, it 
is open to the natural objection that it shares this earth-knowledge 



rnR RELATIOKS OF GEOLOGY. 369 

with many other .sciences, especially with the science of geography. 
Perhaps the shortest detinition that has been made of our science, and 
one equally acceptable to its students and to those who view it from 
the outside, is that geology is the "science of the structure of the 
earth. It is in and around that earth structure that all geological 
ideas center. In working out the solutions of the problems presented 
l)y that structure, geology not only finds her own special and peculiar 
mission, but extends a hand to all her sister sciences. 

In studying the solid elements of that structure, geology shades 
through the science of mineralogy into that of chemistry. In the 
study of the changes which the parts of tliat structure have undergone 
and are now imdergoing it shades through the science of meteorology 
into that of physics. In the study of the successive surfaces of that 
structure it grades into the science of geography. In the study of the 
stony relics of the vanished beings that once dwelt upon those surfaces 
it joins hands with the sciences of zoolog}^ and botany. In studying 
the phenomena presented by the sequence and interrelations of the 
rock formations which go to the building up of that structure, it finds 
the means of reading the past history of the earth and its living 
inhabitants— a glory reserved for geology alone. 

It was not until geologists discovered that the solid earth crust had 
a structure which was made up of definite parts or "formations" capa- 
ble of individual recognition and description, each showing a special 
distril^ution in space and in time, and each marked by characteristic 
features capable of being compared, contrasted, and reasoned about, 
that the science of geology attained individuality and became worthy of 
its name. It was this discover}^ — inaugurated by Lehmann and Guet- 
tard about the middle of the eighteenth century, made famous by 
Werner and his contemporaries toward its close, and established be- 
yond all dispute by William Smith at the dawn of the next — that gave 
geology a claim to be regarded as one of the concrete sciences, and 
placed in her hands the weapons with which she has fought her way 
onward irresistibly to the conquest of her kingdom. 

Since the days of William Smith, the careful investigation and 
mapping out of these geological formations, igneous as well as aqueous, 
has spread outward from the original centers of investigation with 
extraordinary rapidity, until at the present day there is hardly a 
civilized nation that does not possess a government geological surve3\ 
The fascinating problems presented by these formations and the light 
which their solution has thrown upon all that concerns the past 
development of the earth and of its living inhabitants, have not only 
attracted hosts of enthusiastic students to the science itself, but have 
given it a far-reaching interest to countless workers in other branches 
of knowledge and opinion. As a consequence, there is hardly a single 
important intellectual center in the Old World or the New whith has 



370 THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOOY. 

not its own jvcological society, cnmlative of our own, whose nieniljers 
are either engaged in aiding tiie advance of that science or profiting 
1\V the benefits of that advance. One and all — national surveyors, 
members of geological societies, sympathiztM's in other sciences, col- 
lective bodies or isolated individuals — are united in a catholic free- 
masonary by their common study of, and interest in, the rocliy 
structure of the earth. 

I will not attempt the impossible l)}^ endeavoring to follow in 
detail the vai'ious stages in the development of geological science, or 
by trying to distinguish between what is due to the researches of its 
own students, and what is due to the aids afforded them by the fellow- 
sciences. But none among us would venture to deny the assertion 
that no ])ranch of scientific inquiry has profited more than geology 
from what has been termed the "consensus of the sciences." No 
science has received more ungrudging assistance from other sciences, 
or has repaid more fully that assistance in kind. Almost every problem 
attacked by geology has needed the aid of some other ])ranch of 
knowledge for its solution; almost every advance made by geology 
has +'urthered the progress of one or more of its fellow-sciences. 

GEOLOGY AND MITs'EKALf^GY. 

The discovery of the geological formations themselves may be said 
to have ])een essentially the outcome^ of the early association of 
geology and mineralogy. The l)rilliant i(U'as of Werner, em])odied in 
his so-called '"''geognos}'," in which thc'sc formatioi-uS were first identi- 
fied by their mineral characters, and then followed over their vast 
geographical (wtension until they were shown to stand related to the 
whole of tcn-restrial nature and of life, had unquestionably their root 
in mineralogy; and the geological student of the igneous formations 
is incapal)le of his task unless he is well acquainted with the latest 
methods and results of mineralogical science. But the idea of the 
inevitable association of mineralogy and geology nuist not be pressed 
too far, nor should it be allowed to give to the whole of geology that 
dominant mineralogical color in which it is often erroneously supposed 
to be steeped. It is impossible to overestimate the advantages which 
have accrued to the science of geology by its association with miner- 
alogy. But that association is an alliance and not a conquest, (leol- 
ogy is not a province of mineralogy, but an empire in its own right, 
and between it and that of chemistry, mineralogy is, as it were, a kind 
of buffer kingdom having alliances with both. 

But if geology owes much to its alliance with mineralogy, mineral- 
ogy has benefited by that alliance to quite as great an extent. Not 
onlj^ have all the minerals their home and habitat in the rock forma- 
tions, but the mineralogist owes to the geologist all that he knows of 
their association and distribution. In no branch of our science has 



THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 371 

mineralogy aided us more than in that of petrology, which has made 
such marvelous strides during the past generation; but that debt of 
obligation has been well repaid. To the petrologist is owing the dis- 
covery of the special association of the minerals in the igneous rocks, 
their relative order of generation, and their mutual interferences; 
and following upon this he has made known hosts of unexpected data 
rich in fascinating problems, opening out a new world of speculation 
and research both for the mineralogist and for the chemist. 

GEOLOGY AND BIOLOGY. 

But if geology owes the first suggestion of the geological forma- 
tions and their individualization to mineralogy, she has received bene- 
fits of as long standing and of as great a moment from biolog}" and 
biologists. The solid foundations of the paleontological side of 
geology were laid l)y the continental biologists, ranging from Steno to 
Cuvier, simultaneously with the discovery and the working out of the 
order of the geological formations. Nothing in the history of the 
growth of geology so astonished mankind or so efiectually aided in 
lifting and dispersing the dark cloud of obloquy and neglect which 
hid from the world the magnitude of the residts attained by the early 
geologists as the demonstration by the biologist that the extincjt 
organic remains collected from the geological formations were iden- 
tical in structure with creatures living upon the earth at the present 
day and that all these fossil forms fell naturally into a place in the 
accepted biological classifications. At every successive stage in the 
progress of stratigraphy since that time the geologist has been simi- 
larly indebted to the' biologist for the interpretation and classification 
of his fossils; and when we have respect to the rarity and to the frag- 
mentary condition of mau}^ of these forms, we can not suflicientl}' 
express our gratitude to biology for the aid which she has afforded us. 

But there is no need to claim that geolog}" has repaid the debt. It 
will 1)6 enough if 1 quote here two short receipts handed in on our 
behalf, one ])y the most distinguished biologist of the latter half of 
the century just closed, and another by the present occupant of his 
chair. In the words of Huxley, ""The doctrine of evolution in biology 
is a necessary result of the logical application of the principles of the 
geological doctrine of uniformitarianism to the phenomena of life; 
Darwin is the natural successor of Hutton and Lyell, and the 'Origin 
of Species' the logical sequence of the 'Principles of GeologT.''' 
These words were written })y him about twenty 3^ears since, and his 
successor, in reviewing from a morphological standpoint a few months 
ago the work of zoologists accomplished (hiring these twenty years, 
speaks as follows: 

The progress tlm High whicli -we liave passed has produced revolutionary resuhs; 
our knowledge of facts has become materially enhanced, and our clas«itications have 



372 THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 

been to a large extent replaced in clearer and more comprehensive schemes; and we 
are enabled to-day to deduce with an accuracy proportionate to our increased knowl- 
edge of fact the nature of the interrelationships of the living beings, which with 
ourselves inhabit the earth. * * * Satisfactory as is the result, it must be clearly 
borne in mind that its realization coidd not have come about but for a knowledge of 
the animals of the past. 

It is at the present daj" the ha))it of some to hint that pah^ontology, 
as geologists understand it, is a mere l)ranch of hiology, just as it 
was the fashion half a centiiiy ago to look upon it as a branch of 
geology. But the proper view, 1 take it, is to regard it as the common 
possession of ])otli these sciences. Here, as in so man}' contests of 
opinion, the truth lies in the middle. It is undeniable that all the 
organic remains discovered l»y the geologist were in their day mem- 
bers of the great biological chain of life, and have, therefore, their indi- 
vidual places and relationships in the scheme of biological classification; 
and that as a consequence the study of their structure and their rela- 
tionships falls within the province of biology. But it is equalh' unde- 
niable that each of these creatures had an existence during a definite 
range of geological time, and that its fossilized remains occur at a 
certain horizon in the ascending series of the geological formations. 
They have thus a geological arrangement and grouping as inevitable 
and necessary as the biological one. While we grant that the biolo- 
gist has not only a right but almost an obligation to place in its sys- 
tematic biological position in his museiun an example of everv species 
hitherto discovered b}- the geologist, it is equally important for the 
advancement of science in general that the geologist shall have in his 
museum a stratigraphical grouping and chronological arrangement of 
fossil species always available for his geological Avork. There is a 
phylogenetic grouping by affinity for which the biologist is constantly 
striving, and to which he is dail}^ more and more approximating; but 
there is also a chronological grouping by geological position, which 
for every individual specimen in the paleontological department of a 
geological museum was practicallv fixed the day when that specimen 
was collected from a known stratigraphical horizon. We ma}' rest 
assured that 3'ear by 3'ear the stratigraphical classification in our 
geological museum will l)ecome more detailed and more refined. 
This chronological grouping constitutes a tool with which geology can 
not possibly dispense. Again and again in the years gone by the 
apparent sequence and the known paleontc^logy have been in conflict 
as to the true stratigraphical position of local formations, and in every 
known case hitherto the paleontological side has scored the victory. 

But, indeed, if we geologists were ever to become so benighted as to 
neglect this detailed sequential classification of the fossils in our 
museums, the biologists themselves would soon force it upon us for 
the sake of their own science. Fossils as thus arranged are and can 
be the only tangible proofs of the chronological order in which the 



THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 373 

various types :ind forms of life made their successive appearance on 
the earth; and they are in consequence the clearest and most widely 
accepted evidences of the doctrine of biological evolution. And, 
further, the more minutely they are arranged in stratigraphical detail 
and the greater the numlier of species, varieties, or mutations which, 
are arranged under each horizon, the sooner will ])iologists ha^•e at 
their command the necessary materials enabling them to solve those 
great outstanding problems that bear upon the laws whicli have ruled 
in the origin, variation, and distribution of species. 

GEOLOGY AND GEOGKAPHY. 

Turning next to the relations between geography and geology, we 
ma}" say, perhaps, that there are no two sciences more intimately con- 
nected or more mutualh' beneficial. I have alread}- i-eferred to the 
natural claim of some geologists that, logical h', geolog}' includes all 
that is contained in the stud}' of the earth. But it might better, per- 
haps, be said tliat geology and geography share much of this collective 
study between them. Geology deals witli the past of the glolje and 
geography with its present — the former having, so to speak, the 
charge of its history, and the latter of its politics. The surface of the 
globe is their common limit, and in a wa}' their common property. All 
that comes above that surface lies within the province of geograph}^; 
all that comes below that surface lies inside the realm of geology. The 
surface of the earth is that which, so to speak, divides them and at 
the same time "binds them together in indissoluble union.""' AVe may, 
perhaps, put the case metaphoricall}-. The relationships of the two 
are rather like that of man and wife. Geography, like a prudent 
woman, has followed the sage advice of Shakespeare and taken unto 
her "an elder than herself;'' but she does not trespass on the domain 
of her consort, nor could she possibly maintain the respect of her chil- 
dren were she to flaunt before the world the assertion that she is "a 
woman with a past." 

It is almost superfluous even to hint at the aid afforded by physical 
geography to physical geolog}^, or to attempt to show how mutually 
dependent the two have always been one upon the other. At first geol- 
ogy was looked upon merely as a branch of phvsical geography. De 
Saussure, who first gave the name of geology to our science, was him- 
self in the front rank of the physical geographers of his da}'. The 
study of the whole array of terrestrial phenomena described l)y the 
physical geographer is, if anything, even more necessary to the edu- 
cational outfit of the young geologist than the study of mineralogy 
and chemistry. Without the aid afforded by the study of the present 
phenomena, which properly fall within the ken of the physical geog- 
rapher, "the conquests of Hutton and Lyell would never have been 
achieved, and the true philosophy of geology would have been 
impossible." 



374 THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 

Again, every advance made by the geographical surveyor in the 
accuracy and details of his maps has resulted in a corresponding 
improvement in geological mapping and surveying. Ever}^ advance 
made by the descriptive geographer in the discovery, delineation, and 
description of the geographical relief of continental lands or of the 
depths and deposits of the sea has increased geological knowledge, 
and has stimulated geological inquir}^ and discover}^ in an almost cor- 
responding ratio. 

But in this case of geography and geology, as in others, the ])enetits 
have certainly been mutvial. Broadly speaking, almost the whole of 
that vast mass of information which geographers now possess respect- 
ing the work of those agencies which rule upon the djniamical side of 
physical geograph}^ has been wrought out and accumulated b}^ geolo- 
gists engaged in searching for the causes of geological action in the 
past. The grand processes of denudation, erosion, and deposition; 
the multifarious action of rain, rivers, and ice; the phenomena of 
earthquakes and volcanoes, and the rock-making activities of animals 
and plants were most of them first lal)oriously investigated by geolo- 
gists, who welded them into tools for work in their own science and 
then handed them over bodily for permanent lodgment in the well- 
filled storehouse of the physical geographer. 

As regards the surface of the earth itself, so numberless of late 
3'ears ha\e grown the visible and certain points of contact between 
the phenomena previously regarded as proper to the one or the other 
of the two sciences of geology and physical geography, and so evident 
to all has become the sequence of geological causes and geographical 
efl'ects, that many geographers have of late j^ears almost lost con- 
sciousness even of the existence of a possible downward limit to their 
science. Reveling in the wealth of geological facts and ideas already 
accumulated and lying ready to their hand, scientific writers have 
combined with their geographical description of the ''forms" of the 
surface of the earth the geological explanation of their origins in that 
most interesting branch of knowledge which is sometimes named 
" geomorphology.'" This is undoubtedly a section of geonomic 
science which is of great value, and is destined to grow in importance 
as time goes on. But its stud}' presupposes a prelimiiuuy education 
in which geology and geological causes take perhaps the largest share; 
and those who would class it merely as a subscience of geography 
are as wrong as those who class it merel}' as a subscience of geology. 
It is the healthy and vigorous child of both. 

GEOLOGY AND PHYSICS. 

Here we enter upon more difficult and dubious ground, namely, the 
relations of geology to the science of physics, especially in the matter 
of the so-called "hypogene" agencies. The mechanical modes and 
means of formation of our mineraloffical rock sheets have long since 



THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 375 

been reco^-nized and agreed upon, but the mechanical modes and means 
of their deformation have, many of them, j^et to be identitied and 
established. Jn the matters of cleavage, jointing, and foliation we 
have advanced, and in the modes and effects of faulting we have 
already made some headway. But in the grander problems of orogen}', 
crust warping, and secular elevation and depression we are still ver3'^ 
much in the dark. In spite of all the brilliant work which has been 
done of recent years, we are forced to acknowledge that we are still 
busied in collecting data upon which to found a philosophic system of 
crust deformation. Nothing yet formulated in this direction is of 
sufficient detiniteness and breadth of grasp to atford matter from 
which anything more than suggestive deductions may ])e drawn b\' 
the higlier physics and mathematics. 

But although our materials are as yet too heterogeneous and too 
complicated to admit satisfactorily of such butside analysis, yet among 
geologists themselves there is being developed a tendency to assort 
and interpret them from two extreme points of view, which may per- 
haps be distinguished as the astronomical and the geonomical. 

The working theory employed by the many at the one extreme is 
the collapse theory, which is founded essentially upon the (contraction) 
hypothesis of the gradual loss of heat of the earth's interior. This 
theory starts from the original covering of our globe, and regards the 
present state of that covering as that of a solid and more or less cooled 
crust, which warps, folds, and fractures as it follows down upon the 
slowly contracting, but still intenseh" heated (and probal)ly solid), 
nucleus. This crust shows in its structure and in the major forms of 
the outer surface the combined effects of the radial and tangential 
deformafions due to the contraction and collapse, these deformations 
being grou})ed about the remains of the chief irregularities proper to 
the crust at the time of its original const)lidation. 

The working theory employed by the few at the othin- (>xti-eme is 
the fold theory, founded essentially on the (undulation) liy})othesisthat 
the deformation may be largely due to tidal movements and to the con- 
stant redistribution of load and resistances. It starts from the known 
modes of deformation of the rock sheets which make up the present 
supercrust and of those of its superposed coverings of water and of air. 
It regards the earth crust as a spherical shell or bridge surrounding 
and l)alanced upon a fluid nucleus (prol)a))ly gas-like), the shell being 
in a staie of general \il)ration and its parts in a state of regional and 
local strain. This shell yields harmonically as a whole, and its various 
parts yield in groups or individually to the several stresses, but always 
in theoretic units (duacls), each made up of two moieties w hich an^ the 
positive and negative e(|uivalents of each other. 

According to both theories, the type of defoiination mav t)e that of 
undulation, \varping, folding, gliding, fracture, or tiow, according as 
SM 1903^—25 



376 THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 

the magnitude of the stress, the speed of the action, or the relative 
elasticity of the material may determine. Its development may range 
in time from that of an instant to that of an teon, and its extent from 
microscopic to hemispheric. 

According to the first theory, however, the deformation is not 
theoretically symmetrical, but is consequent upon and has ever been 
controlled by the salient features of the original earth crust. Accord- 
ing to the second, the deformation is theoretically symmetrical, and is 
due to the continual l)reaking down and I'eadjustment of equilibrium; 
it is at every stage controlled ])y the length and direction of the instan- 
taneous polar and ecjuatorial diameters of the earth, and by the sum- 
mational and individual deformations already effected. 

The tendenci«\s of the first theory are to compare all the phenomena 
of yieldage with those characteristic of solid liodies and to dwell 
especially ui)<)n the proofs of fracture (with the fault as the central 
type); to parallel such signs of symmetry as are apparent with that of 
crystals, and the loxodromic trend lines of the earth's surface with 
those of crystalline cleavage. The tendencies of the second theory are 
to compare the yieldage phenomena with those of flexible bodies (with 
the fold as the central type), grading on the one hand into those of 
rigid and on the other into those of li(|uid bodies, and including all 
types; to })arallel the synunetries with those of wave forms, and to 
refer the trends to composition, interference, or superposition, as the 
case maj^ be. 

In the first theory there is inherent the expectation of continuous 
accretion and discontinuous collapse; in the second the expectation 
of rh3"thmic recurrence of form in space and of movement in time. 
According to the first theor}^ the locus of the pole of the land hemi- 
sphere on or about the forty-fifth ])arall(M is an accident of evolution 
and a survival; according to the second it is a theoretic necessity and a 
resultant. 

How nmch of each of these views is a mere mental expedient, and 
how much is an expression of fact, must be left for future research to 
determine. The discovery of the true path lying between the two 
extremes will form one of the tasks which await the geologists of the 
coming era. 

II. — Geology and Practice. 

GEOLOGY AND THE USEFUL ARTS. 

Up to this point I have dealt mainly with the so-called "scientific" 
aspect of geology, regarding it from the inside point of view as an 
interpreter of nature and a meml)er of the great family of the 
sciences. But, as I have already hinted, we are bound also to consider 
it from the outside or " practical" point of view as being one of the 



THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 377 

servants of mankind and an associate of the useful arts. Indeed it is 
wholl}^ impossible to avoid dealing with it from this outside aspect. 
In the words of Herbert Spencer: 

Not only are the sciences involved with each other, but they are all inextrieal)ly 
interwoven with the complex web of the arts, and are only conventionally inde- 
pendent of it. Originally the two were one, and there has been a perpetual inoscula- 
tion of the two ever since. Science has been supplying art with higher generalizations 
and more completely qualitative previsions; art has been supplying science with bet- 
ter materials and more perfect instruments. * * * And all along this interde- 
pendence has 1>een growing closer, not only between the arts and sciences, but among 
the arts themselves and among the sciences themselves. 

I have already noted how greatly geology is indebted to her sister 
sciences, and how in ever}' case the aid which she has been- given has 
been fully reciprocated and the mutual sympathy broadened and 
enlarged. Surely there is no need for me to recall how deep and how 
fundamental are the ol)ligations which geology owes to the arts in 
general, and to those of mining, engineering, and topographic sur- 
vej'ing in particular. But it may not be without advantage if we 
geologists remind ourselves of that which in the absorption of our 
researches we are sadly prone to forget, namely, the existence of those 
many links that bind our science to the world of practice, and the 
vital need there is of strengthening those links b}' everv means in our 
power. 

It is true that the first duty of every science is to move incessantl}^ 
forward from discover}- to discover}^ along the straight path of un- 
remitting investigation and research, following truth withersoever it 
may lead, wholly unbiased by the question as to whether that dis- 
covery bears any relation whatever to the material wants of mankind. 
But it is equalh^ true that once a fresh fact has l)een discovered, or 
once a new and satisfactory conclusion has been reached, if that fa(;t 
or that conclusion be of evident benefit to mankind at large, every 
lover of his science should welcome its utility and do his best to en- 
courage its use. 

Here, however, we can not ignore the fact that it is impossil^e that 
full use can be made of the results of an}^ science until those to whom 
such results would be of practical value are educated at least in tlie 
principles of that science. And such education has a double value; it 
is not only of especial advantage to those who intend to make use of 
the results of the science, but it redounds to the benefit of the science 
itself, for it trains up a host of sympathetic students all concerned in 
its advancement. 

We can not fail to recognize that those sciences— such as chemistry, 
ph3^sics, biology, and the like — which are generally acknowledged 
to be mo.st intimately l)ound u[) with practice, and an education in 
which is held to be absolutelv necessary for success in one or more of 



378 THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 

the arts or professions, are the .sciences which have the greatest num- 
ber of students and are making the swiftest progress. It is the height 
of absurdity to imagine that geology can, any more than any other 
science, possibly restrict its activity to research alone. Rather ma}^ 
we sa}^ that tlie corporate geological organism has three necessary 
functions — research, practice, and education. So long as all three 
functions are naturally and healthfully performed, so long willgeolog}^ 
live and flourish. Whenever either function remains long unexercised, 
or falls into disuse, there follows, of necessity, a weakness throughout 
the entire organism, which nuist in the end becouje lethargic and crip- 
pled, and fall behind in the race. 

When, on the other liand, all three functions ure most vigorously 
exercised, the progress of the science nmst be at its swiftest and its 
surest. And this fact has been well illustrated in the histor}" of our 
science; for whenevei" these three fimctions of geology have been most 
clearly appicciated and simultaneously energized by its leaders, geol- 
ogy has shown forth with an (^special and peculiar lustei-, and has won 
the attention and regai-d of the world. 

Those who came fi'oin all paits of Eui'ope to attend the lectures of 
Werner were drawn to him by his conviction that geology was one 
of the most useful of trainings, not only for the men of the mining and 
metallurgical world, hut also for those who were interested in all that 
concerns man's relation to the earth in general. They listenc^d with 
delight and with profit to the brilliant exposition of his far-reaching- 
ideas, not oidy l)ecause they felt the fascination of these ideas, l)ut also 
because^ they were impressed l)y his assurance of their material and 
intellectual utility. The geological education which they received 
from him they conununicated in their turn to theii- own pui)ils. and 
rapidh' spread the Ixmetits and influence of geology far and wide over 
the economic and intellectual world of their time. 

Rut we have even a more striking instance nearer home. 1 do not 
think that it is too nuich to assert that no single geologist whose name 
adorns'the long roll of the past members of this societ}" secured at 
one and the same time so far-reaching an influence upon the spi'ead of 
geological knowledge at large, so sincere a respect for our science 
from the governments of civilized countries, and so kindly a I'egard 
and aflection for it from the mass of mankind, as Sir Henry De la 
Beche. And 1 take it that all this was due to the fact that he, more 
than any other British geologist before him or after him, had a clear 
and well-balanced conception of the three functions of geology. He 
was at once a scientist, a practical man, and an educationalist. 

No one familiar with his Geology of Devon and Cornwall or with 
his Geological Observer but will grant tliat he was, both from the 
side of research and of theory, a scientist to the backbone. But he was 
more than a scientist. He was a man whose life work had convinced 



THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 379 

hilii that the useful side of geology is as iniportant as the intellectual 
and, indeed, of the necessity there is for the constant union of science 
and practice, or, as he puts it himself, *" Science and practice are not 
antagonistic; they are mutual aids." And mainly, perhaps because 
of this conviction, he was also a keen educationalist; for, as he himself 
expresses it, as "some reason, right or wrong, is sure to be assigned 
to every practice, it is most important for those connected with that 
practice that the}^ should possess the existing knowledge upon which 
it rests." 

De la Beche devoted some of the best \'ears of his life to the task of 
convincing the Government and the people of this country of the 
importance of the knowledge of the science and practice of geology 
and its related sciences to the material and intellectual advancement of 
the nation. He l)rought round the (xovernment of the day to his 
views, and the ])est minds of his time, from the Prince Consort down- 
ward, became his enthusiastic supporters. He created the British 
National Ueological Survey, which has proved itself as t)eneticial to 
the advance of pure geology as it has to the dev(dopment of the min- 
eral resources of the Kingdom, while it has been the prolific parent of 
similar national geological surveys in almost all countries of the civi- 
lized world. He founded the Museum of Practical (xeology as a national 
home for the collections made l)y geological research and for tlie illus- 
trations of geology in all its practical applications, consecrating the 
building, even in its title, to that idea of tlie coml)ination of knowledge 
,and utility which justified the nation in its foundation and its main- 
tenance. And more, he made that museum, through his genius and 
his knowledge of men, a living and growing center of instruction in 
geological science and its useful applications, selecting as the teachers 
of that special education some of the highest intellects of his day. 

What other scientitic leader of the nineteenth century can show so 
famous a roll of lieutenants^ It is almost invidious to select names 
from th(> list. But so long as natural science, pure or applied, shall 
command the respect of men the names of Thomas Huxley, Lyon 
Playfair. Edward Frankland, John Percy, Edward Forbes, and 
Andrew Ramsay will be held in honored memory as those of men 
whose life woi'k in science, or in practice, or in education, or in all 
three combined, place them in the front raidv of the l)enef actors of 
their da}" and their generation. 

We might go on to point out how the success of De la Beche's scheme 
caused it to outgrow rai)idly the limits of its original home, for we are 
most of us familiar with the fact that while the geological survey and 
the national geological collections are still retained in the original 
museum, the educational sections became developed into the Royal 
School of Mines and eventually into the Royal College of Science, 
which in its turn practicall}- bc^-ame the center of that widespread 



380 THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 

scheme of imtioiml iiisti'uction kiio^vn as the '■'science iind art <lepavt- 
ment/' But wliat especially concerns us here is that these results 
demonstrate, on the one hand, the naturalness and fertility of 
De la Beche's conception of the necessary association of science, prac- 
tice, and education and, on the other, the far-reaching" influence that 
geology and geologists have had on the extension and invigoration of 
scientific pi-actice and education in Britain. 

GEOLOGY AND ECONOMICS, 

It is almost an im})ertinenc(^ to point out to an assemblage of geolo- 
gists like this the relationships of geology and its applications to the 
material welfai'c of our fellow-counti'ymen; but those of us who are 
absorbed in the charms of research are now and again tempted to look 
askance at those Avho are engaged in advancing geology and the appli- 
cations of geology from the side of ci-onomics. Yet for all that ever}" 
one of us is well aware that geology is bound up body and soul with 
the develo[)ment of the mineral wealth of our land — that mineral wealth 
by means of which the enterprise of our people has placed our countiy 
at the head of tlie manufacturing and connnercial powers of the world. 
Our science has not only the charge of the working out of all the 
detailed j)henomena, subterranean and superticial, of the great coal 
fields and iron-ore fields which lie at the foundation of our conuuercial 
supremacy iis a nation, but it works out the characters and tixes the 
places of all the ston}" materials of which our cities and towns are 
built, our humblest dwellings are constructed, and all our roads and 
railways are made. It deals with the sources and the quantities and 
characters of our water supplies, whether deep seated or superticial, 
the nature and distribution of our soils, and indeed with everything 
which W'C derive directly from the ground upon which we tread. Thus 
a know ledge of tiie principles and applications df geology is indispen- 
sable to the education of the miner, the mine owner, the prospector, the 
land agent, the land owner, the agriculturist, the civil engineer, and 
the military engineer. 

GEOLOGY AND MAN. 

It is as true now as it was in the davs A\hen \\'erner tirst drew his 
far-reaching inferences before his charmed listeners that in the char- 
acteristic phenomena and varying distribution of the grand mineral 
masses of the rock formations almost all that concerns the relative 
habitability of a land depends. Where the hard, intractal)le rock 
formations rise boldly out we have our mountain regions — our uplands 
and highlands — wild areas of pasture and scanty populations, it is true, 
but the lands of refuge and of freedom in the past and of health and 
holiday in the present. Where the soft, easily weathered rock forma- 
tions spread out in gentle slopes or })road undulations we have the wide 



THE RELATIONS OF OEOLOGY. 381 

plains of our oreat ai^riciiltural clistiicts — the lands, it may ])e, of peace 
and plenty, but where life is so easy-g-oino- and so monotonous that 
there is little incentive or opportunity to vary the established order 
of thing's, and the local country life remains much the same genera- 
tion after generation. Ret^ve(Ml these two exti'emes lie the areas 
floored l)y the gently inclined rocks of our great coal lields, the theaters 
of an incessant and fierce industrial struggle — a struggle that has its 
reflection and its effects iu tii(^ restless energy and the determined 
advance of their inha])itants. 

What well-read geologist among us is notawai-e that ever}' Aariation 
in the contour of our country, as it rises from the encircling seas that 
have guarded our freedom, is dependent upon its geology ^ \Miere 
the hard rock formations reach the seaboard, project the bold head- 
land and its clift's. Where the soft rocks come down to the shore line, 
open out the lu'oad })ays. Where the highly resistant rocks are lifted 
up in broad mass and face the wild ocean, we find a shore land of 
rugged clifl'^ and wild inlets, inhabited only by a few hardy tishermen. 
Where the easily yielding rocks have been depressed in mass by geo- 
logical movements, we have the long withdrawing estuary, alive with 
the ships of connuerce moving to and fro from the busy and populous 
seaport at it^^ head. 

Or, tur-ning inland and looking over the general aspect of the country, 
we recognize every whei'c not only the paramount influence of the 
geological formations and geological conditions on the scenery and the 
relief of the land, but we trace everywhere the persistent eflects of 
these conditions upon the past and present of the people. All the 
'activities of struggling humanity, in the contest for the bare necessi- 
ties of existence, for mutual protection, for trade and for progress 
have been limited and controlled by the natural ))Ounds marked out by 
the unvarying geological factors. The original sites of almost every 
city and town, village and handet, ancient castle and modern mansion 
were all determined practically by geological considerations. The 
sites of the old fortresses were fixed by the places of the more or less 
inaccessible clifl's and scarps, the position of the villages and hamlets 
by the abundance of the springs, and the settlement of the lands by 
the comparative richness of the soils. All down the long str(>am of 
history the successive waves of invasion, the I'bl) and flow of con- 
quering armies, the tracks of inland trade and conununication, from 
the time of the Roman ways, through the roads of the middle ages 
and later, down to the main threads of the network of railways of the 
present day, have all more oi' less followed the same general courses, 
courses determined l)y the geographical phenomena consequent upon the 
geological structure of the land. 

It is idle to pursue these matters further or recall how all the 
variations 'n scenery and scenic beaut}' arc dependent upon geological

causes, or how these causes (h'teruiitie tlie prothictiveness or the 
healthfulness of a district, lint it is ini})ossil)le tor us, to whom tiiese 
matters are as familiar as household words, to couccuve that the educa- 
tion of the geographer, the traveler, the man of commerce, the student 
of hygiene, the artist, the archaeologist, the historian, or even the 
politician can possibly pretend to completeness uidess that education 
has shown him something of the wealth of facts and ideas that flow 
even from an elementary ac(iuaintance with a knowledge of these 
things. 

Here perhaps we may call to mind the fact that what gives character 
and especial color to the science of geology is that it is the exponent 
of the idea of continuous evolution. I had almost said the discoverer; 
foi- '' Iw discovei's who proves." Its wid(»st conclusions are based upon 
the assumption and proof of the efficacy of small causes to bring al)Out 
the greatest cumulati\(' effects. There is probably no educational 
gynniastic more ca})tivating and invigorating than to work out and 
fully ap})i-eciat(e the <|uietly cumulative^ etl'i^cts of present natural 
causes the sea waves gnawing away the shore, the slow siidving of

up the long laddei- of life, and note the successive* incoming of the 
ascending types of the animate creation, rising higher and higher yet 
in the scale of l)eing to the crown of all — man himself — '' the heir of 
all the ages." 

The discoveries which geology, in company with archaeology and 
anthropology, has made in aid of the solution of the great pro})lem of 
the antiquity of man are so revolutionary and so recent that the}" are 
practically familiar to all. 

To one who has gone through a geological training and appreciated 
its meaning the idea of slow and continuous evolution becomes, as it 
were, part and parcel of his mental constitution. He naturallv carries 
the same geological methods into the stud}' of humanit}^ in general — 
always from the developmental point of view, always on the watch for 
those simple natural causes that may have been capable of bringing 
about the present known effects, andalwa^-s in the hope of discovering 
a slow and natural evolution. It is in this wa}" that he studies the 
races of mankind, the growth and relations of languages, the forms 
and distributions of beliefs, the trends of political practice and 
opinion, the origin and expansion of commerce. He is watching and 
indeed, as it were, assisting in the development of a living thing grow- 
ing up before his mental eyes. His interest is excited, his curiosity 
piqued, and his emotions stirred; and while his imagination is allowed 
full play, it is always safely confined within the logical bounds of 
induction, deduction, and veritication. 



THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 383 

Snrolv sonu' kiiul of knowledge and training of this kind is much 
to be desii-ed for the ordinary man of education and leisure, the lit- 
erary man, the arts man, the matiiematician. Oiily by some means 
of this kind does it seem possible to restore the loss of balance due to 
the self- absorptive and introspective tendency of much of the so-called 
culture of the present day. Only by some means of this kind can 
one attain to the needed breadth of outlook and freedom of opinion as 
respects all that concerns the relation of man and nature. 

III. — Geology and Education. 

We have se^n that a knowledge of geology is indispensa]>le to the 
complete education of the miner, the prospector, the civil engineer, 
and the military engineer, and that a first-hand acquaintance with at 
least its elements is eminently desira))le for the agriculturist, the 
geographer, the traveler, and the l)iologisr. Many may even be will- 
ing to admit that the literary man and the man of culture would l)e 
the better for knowing something of its principles and its conclusions. 
But as geologists it is our bounden duty to go nuich further than 
this, and urge upon the educationalists of the day the necessity of 
artording the rising generation such a full opportunity of instruction 
in that kind of knowledge, of which geology is the keystone, as shall 
enable our youth to understand and appreciate the more important 
phenomena of the world at large and the bearing of these upon their 
own life and surroundings. 

Nothing, however, is further from my intention than to suggest 
that all the youth of the country shall be instructed in the science of 
geology as such or that geology shall be introduced as a special sub- 
ject of education except into the higher classes of schools, colleges, and 
universities. But what 1 have in my mind is that geology is the center 
of that group of knowledges which are sometimes collectively referred 
to as ''nature knowledge" and their stud}' as ''nature stud3^''' The 
more advanced educationalists have long since suggested and even 
strongly advocated instruction in nature study for all our youth; but, 
alas, they are not yet agreed as to what '"nature study " shall include or 
how it shall be taught. At the one extreme are those who apparently 
would embrace within it instruction in and explanation of all such con- 
crete facts and phenomena as can l)e ])rought before the notice of the 
vouthful pupil so as to direct his attention to external nature in general. 
At the other extreme are those to whom this dwelling upon facts and 
phenomena appears to be repugnant, if we may judge from the fol- 
lowing extract, which 1 take from a recently published book catalogue: 
"To those who are striving to make nature study more vital and 
attractive by revealing a vast realm of nature outside the realm of 
science and a world of ideas aliove and bevond the world of facts the 



884 THE EELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 

pag-e.s following, giving- the titles of books dealing with nature and 
nature studies, are dedicated." As geologists, however, we should 
presume, I take it, that education in nature study is, in the words of 
Huxley, ''education in that diligent, patient, loving study of all the 
aspects of nature the results of which constitute exact knowledge or 
science.'' 

EDUCATION IN EARTH KNOWLEDGE. 

However that may be, this at all events is clear: The branch of 
nature knowledge with which geology and geologists have to do is that 
which Huxley terms "erdkunde, or earth knowledge, or geology in 
its etymological sense." So impressed was Huxley with the general 
need for instruction in this kind of earth knowledge that he practi- 
cally founded for its study the educational subject, which he named 
""phj'siograph}'." Yet ph3^siogTaph\" has come to embrace much that 
truly belongs to astronom}' ; and, indeed, a very large proportion of 
the subject of physiography, as taught in many schools and colleges 
in Britain at the present day, is essentially astronomical. But here we 
have to bear in mind that of the two great divisions of nature that 
of the outside universe which is proper to astronomy concerns indi- 
vidual men but indirectly. The other half of nature, if we may call 
it so — the world upon which we live and amidst whose phenomena we 
move and have our being — is always with us and around us, and its 
conscious systematic stud}', Avhich we call '"earth knowledge," is, in 
truth, only a methodizing and an extension of the unconscious and 
unsvstematic study that we call '"experience," which we are always 
making from the earliest dawn of our consciousness to the final dark- 
ness of old age. This is the kind of nature knowledge — namely, earth 
knowledge proper, or, in other worGs, "geonomy " as contrasted vvith 
"astronomy'' — of which our youth has the greatest need, and it is 
instruction in this which it is one of the missions of geology to claim 
for the rising generation. 

The da}' has not yet arrived when it will be possible to define pre- 
cisely what should l)e taught under the head of this earth knowledge. 
But what 1 would understand by it is that it should embrace instruc- 
tion which would direct the attention of the scholar not only to the 
natui'al phenomena of the world at large, but also to those particular 
phenomena of the world immediately around him. In its general inter- 
pretation its central plane would be the surface of the earth, and from 
this it would pass upward ))y pi'opei; stages to consider the distribution 
of all the phenomena, organic and inorganic, above that surface; out- 
ward to the stud}' of the meaning and interaction of these phenomena; 
downward to the study of their history, and onward to the study of 
their evolution. 

The teaching of this earth knowledge could begin in the elementary 
classes of schools, l>e contiiuied in risitio- urades through the hijjfher 



THE BELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 885 

classes, and thence extended to the universities. Speaking theoretic- 
ally, in its earliest stages it should be as simple as possible and cover 
the ground which is familiar to daily experience or which is funda- 
mental to several of the natural sciences. In its higher stages it should 
become more specialized and include the facts and principles common 
to the special group of sciences which will become of value to the 
scholar in his later studies or in his after life. In the universit}^ it might 
finally be restricted to the perfect knowledge of that one science which 
the scholar has selected for his specialt}' and as much of the fellow 
sciences as has an intimate bearing upon the science which he selects 
as his own. At every stage a broad foundation should be laid for the 
superstructure to be erected in the next stage of advance. 

But, speaking practically, it is impossible at the present day to lay 
down any general rules as to the order in which the subjects dealt 
with under tlie head of geononi}^ should be taken up or as to the way 
in which those subjects should be individually treated. For while it 
is quite true that the aim should be to instruct in those generalities 
wdiich are common to many or all of the sciences, we should luost 
strictly guard ourselves from falling into the error implied by many 
of the text-book writers on physiography, who start with an opening 
chapter on matter, energy, gravity, and the like — generalities in their 
essence as yet hardly capable of conception even by the highest intel- 
lects. And while it is quite true that the most vivid and lasting means 
of education is by experiments and deductions carried out by the pupil 
himself, we should as carefully avoid the equally fatal error of imag- 
ining that instruction in a single experimental science, such as chem- 
istry and physics, ca^n do more for the pupil than give him a glimpse 
of a corner of nature. 

It is sometimes suggested that instruction in earth knowledge should 
commence with the simphvst facts and deductions and lead up, stage 
by stage, to the highest philosophical conceptions and generalizations. 
But this is not the way in which any branch of knowledge has grown 
and developed in the past. The human mind is so constituted that it 
can often appreciate the broadest generalizations in some directions 
before it can interest itself in the most elementar}' facts and draw the 
simplest conclusions in others. What must be done is to ascertain 
from the study of the several branches of knowledge how they have 
individual!}^ grown during their developmental history- in past ages, 
note the order of su))jects which were earliest and most easily appre- 
ciated by the human intellect, and give the successive phases of 
education as nearl}- as may be in that order. 

Again, it ia sometimes hinted that the only fruitful education is that 
which is purely experimental, the deductions and generalizations in 
which shall be worked out by the scholar himself; and also that all 
knowledge whii-h is imparted by the didactic method is not true 
knowledge and is comparatively infertile. But 1 firmly hold that 



386 THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 

both nietliods are corrcM-t, eacli for itsi^lf, and should both b«' utilized. 
There are uii({uesti()nal)ly souie thiiios which are best tauoht by 
experiment, and by that demonstration in which the pupil takes the 
whole or the largest share. But, on the other hand, the facts of 
science are so overwhelming in nund^er, and some of its grandest 
conclusions are so dependent on the highest extremes of knowledge, 
that they must be communicated didacticall}" and must be accepted by 
the scholar more or less as an article of faith. Indeed, the younger 
the scholar and the less his experience, the more certain is he to accept 
as unquestionabl(> truths the assertions of his instructors. It would 
be tlie height of folly to neglect the advantages of all this side of a 
3"Outirs education in those years of his life when he is most ([ualitied 
to profit by it. 

The fac^t is that in the imparting of (^arth knowledge, as in any other 
kind of instruction, both educational methods didactic and experi- 
mental, authoritative and original — should he utilized together. It is 
a matter for the educationalist to hnd out what sections of a subject 
and what stages of a subject are best im])arted by one method and 
what by anotlun'. The only rule which can be laid down is that the 
didactic and authoritative method is certain to have h^ss and l(\ss effect 
as the scholar grows older and his experience broadens, and the 
ex])erimentai and original more and more. But there is no escape 
from the conclusion that it is the common interest of the teacher and 
the scholar to make use of both methods; for the knowledge of every 
man — the genius, the scholar, thc^ wise man, and the fool — is alike in 
this, that it is the sum of that knowledge which is due to his own 
individual experience and that portion of the collective knowledge of 
humanit}' which is due to the antecedent experiences of his fore- 
fathers and which he has received at second hand. It is not that the 
present educational systems are wrong in laying stress on the memo- 
rizing and the applying of what is already known, l)ut that they are 
defective in neglecting the individual and original half of a libei-al 
education. 

As 1 have already pointed out, the central plane of geonomy is the 
knowledge of the surface of the earth, whose present conditions 
belong to geograph}^, and whose past and evolution belong to geolog}^ 
But in the earlier phases of the education of the scholar there can and 
need be no distinction in his mind between these two sciences; they 
are rather combined in a geonomic stage — in a generalized organism, 
so to speak — destined to evolve and diti'erentiate later on. Yet in this 
earl}' stage the dominating section of the subject is essentialh^ geog- 
raphy. As such it presents two very ditierent aspects— the general 
geography, namely, that of the world and its surface as a whole; and 
the local geography, namely, the geography of the home and the sur- 
roundings of the scholar. The general geograph}" must be taught di- 



THE EELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 387 

dacticallv. with the aid of such lecture illustrations as globes and maps; 
and the instruction must be received by the scholar more or less as an 
article of faith. The local geograph}, however — and by this I would 
understand not only the topography of the district, but the geograph}^ 
of the town or village, the playground, and the ver}" schoolroom itself — 
should be taught practically at lirst hand, the data being recognized, 
collected, and classified, the experiments made, and the conclusions 
drawn, as much as possible })v the scholar himself. 

MAI'S AS MP]ANS AND SYMBOLS OF EARTH KNOWLED(4E. 

It is along this local side of geonomy that some of the most impor- 
tant advantages will accrue to geology, and not only to geology Ijut to 
all its associated sciences. One of the most necessary qualifications 
for the geologist and the geographer, and indeed for all students of 
those sciences and arts in which facts and phenomena have to be 
arranged in their order of distribution, is a familiarity with the use of 
maps and a knowledge of how they are constructed. But one of the 
connnonest results of the present modes of giving instruction in maps 
and map making in most schools is to cause this kind of knowledge to 
become distasteful to the learner. And the consequence is that for one 
fairly well educated man who can read a good map of his own native 
district, there are hundreds to whom this is impossible. A detailed 
topogra])hical map or a geological map is practically a mystery to the 
average man, and yet the training which would have enabled him to 
appreciate and enjoy them l)oth might, if given properly in his earl}^ 
years, have afforded him manv a pleasant and interesting break in the 
monotony of his ordinary school work. He has doubtless ])een shown 
in his geographical classes the ordinary maps of the world, and those 
of the continelits and his own country; he has perhaps copied some of 
them laboriously in manuscript and very probabh' passed examinations 
in drawing them from memor}'. But they were always more or less 
dead things to him, because they dealt with lands and districts which 
he had never beheld and not with the familiar ot)jects of the school and 
the home. He has ne\'er seen them grow up before his own eyes, 
built up from facts collected by himself and his fellows. 

We should like to see the lower classes of all schools making a map 
of their own schoolroom and playground. We should like to see 
the scholars at a higher stage studying and exercised in the large scale 
25-inch map of the locality, with the school in the center; those at a 
higher stage engaged on the 6-inch ma}) of the neighborhood, and so 
on. Stage by stage the scholars might pass to the study of the 1-inch 
map of the district or county. Then, when once th(»se maps had 
))ecome famitiiir objects, the learners should bt' taken out on occasional 
excursions into the country with the maps in their hands, and edu- 
cated in some of the higher grades of that earth knowledge which can 



388 THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 

only be seen and appreciated in the open air. Later on the scholars 
might pass to the study of natural agencies, the origin and meaning of 
landscape, to geology proper, and thence to the study of the intimate 
relations of nature and man. 

But it nmst be acknowledged that the present lack of this kind of 
instruction is not to be wholly ascril)ed to the teachers. Good local 
maps were until tecently practically nonexistent. The Government 
ordnance and geological surve3^s have now made these at great national 
expense, but so hidden away are they that few except military and 
civil engineers and surveyors use them freely, and very few have rec- 
ognized their perfection and importance. Now, that these maps are 
becoming completed, we are beginning to discover that they constitute 
a most important educational engine. They are still, however, sold 
at too high a price. When we })ear in mind the impoi'tant fact that 
each member of a class should be provided with a fresh map at every 
successive stage, the cost to parents and school managers of this 
branch of geoncmiic training, as matters stand, would be considerable. 
Yet we may be sure that this kind of instruction is certain to come 
about. It ))ecomes, therefore, a serious question whether the Govern- 
ment departments concerned with the surveying of our country could 
not be authorized to supply these maps to school classes, either as 
part of the local Government grant or at a ver}^ cheap rate. The actual 
survex'ing of the country and the preparation of the mai)s already 
costs several thousands of pounds annually, which are ungrudgingly 
paid by the nation. Surel}' an extra yearl}^ grant of a few scores of 
pounds to enable the Government map-making departments to supply 
these maps to schools at a nominal price would, be so trivial, whether 
compared on the one hand with the large grant already made for the 
original production of these maps or on the other hand with their 
educational value to the rising generation, that it would undoubtedly 
be welcomed by all. 

And once our people became aware of the excellence of these national 
maps, topographical and geological, the demand for them, which is 
comparatively small at present, would certaiid}' grow. As yet, how- 
ever, the public are hardly aware even of their existence. A great 
advance has been made of late by hanging up selected, )>ut unfortu- 
nately not local, portions of these maps in post-ofBces, with a notice 
that the maps can be obtained from the local agent. But what are 
really wanted in all post-offices are framed copies of the 1-inch and 
6-inch maps of the locality, hung up so as to be available for reference 
b}" all comers, and a copy of each of these and the other local maps 
kept in stock, together with a simple catalogue of all the national 
maps and memoirs, any one of which should be obtaina])le by return 
of post. The post-offices are, in the very nature of things, the l)est 
advertising places in the country , and they are in direct touch with 



THE KELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 389 

the map-issuing- departments of the Government. Once the people 
become accustomed by means of their school teaching-, and Iw constant 
sight of these maps in the post-offices to regard them as a factor in 
their daily life, that which is now a luxury for the learned and the 
few will become more or less a necessity for the general and the many, 
and they will demand for themselves and their children a more inti- 
mate acquaintance with that earth know^ledge of which these maps are 
a symbol — a consummation in which the science of geology will benefit 
by no means last and by no means least. 

CONCLUSION. 

But to what extent instruction in that earth knowledge of which 
geology is thesoui and center will constitute an integral portion of the 
general education during the present century must depend iti part on 
the efforts of geologists and in part on the enlightenment and emanci- 
pation of the educationalists themselves. As geologists, however, wc 
have the assurance, justified ])y unbroken tradition, that our views 
will eventuallv l)e accepted simply l)ecause they are inevital)le. 

In the direction of practice also we may look forw^ard with (Mjual 
contidence, especially to the spread of geological facts and principles 
and to the extension of the applications of our science. The enormous 
increase in the utilization of the mineral resources of our country 
which is now going on, and the rapid opening up of the many mineral 
districts throughout the world-wide possessions of the Empire, bring 
da}' by day a larger array of students to our science from I he side of 
economics. 

And turning- to the side of research we are all of us aware that some 
of the grandest and most difficult problems of our science still await 
solution — problems as attractive, as stinudating, and as rich in prom- 
ise as were any of those of the past. And if that past be a true index 
of the future we may be well satisfied that there is no science which 
need outstrip ours in its rate of progress. When we call to luind that at 
the couunencement of the great French Revolution, whose echoes have 
as yet hardly died away, our science was just struggling into exist- 
ence, and that in the short time which has since elapsed it has placed 
itself abreast of the foremost, we have every incentive to push for- 
ward and to emulate those great pioneers in the science, in the mighty 
sum of whose conquests we rejoice and take a pardonable pi-ide. 

We have indeed abundant cause for pride, yet none for vainglory. 
No science, it is true, has made so swift an advance as geology, but 
certainly to none has ever been afforded so magniHcent an opportunity. 
The veil of ignorance and of traditional opinion which hid from the men 
of the Middle Ages the wondcis which geology has since repealed was 
so dark and opacuie tliat until the close of the eighte(>nth century no 



390 THE RELATIONS OF GEOLOGY. 

lig'ht could penetrate beyond. But so old and tlim.s}' was it thai when 
once the strong hand of the geologist had torn it, it was soon rent 
through from top to bottom, and in the tiood of light which entered 
what wonder that discovery followed discover^" in almost endless 
succession. 

And we have deep cause for thankfulness in that these discoveries 
have been of benefit not for our science alone, but for all its fellow- 
sciences; and more, that they have been from the first of supreme 
importance to man himself, his industries, and his progress, and to the 
study of his historv, his origin, and indeed of all that ))inds him and 
his fellow-creatures to the world on which he lives. 

AVhilc, therefore, we move on contidently together in this dawn of a 
ncAv era, blazing forward the straight and narrow, trail of research 
marked out up to this ])oint by our geological forefathers "'the old 
trail, the lone trail, the trail that's always new" — let us ever remcun- 
l)er that our science is not only the interpreter of nature, but also the 
servant of humanit}'. 



TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM IN ITS RELATION TO 
GEOGRAPHY." 



By Capt. Ettrick W. Creak, C. B., R. N., F. B. «. 



Of the six disting'uishcd naval officers who have previously presided 
'over this section, four were arctic explorers,- and therefore, possessing 
personal experience in arctic regions, the}' naturally gave prominence 
to the deeply interesting subject of the past and future of arctic dis- 
covery in their addresses, while not forgetting other matters relating 
to the geography of the sea. The remaining officers, from their imme- 
ditttc connection with all that relates to the physical condition of the 
ocean, in its widest sense, coupled with the great importance of giving 
the fruits of their knowledge to the world, took that sul)ject as their 
principal theme. 

Valuable as are contributions to our knowledge of the physics of the 
ocean to the world in general, and especially to the mariner and water- 
borne landsman, I propose to take a ditferent course, and l)ring to your 
notice the subject of terrestrial magnetism in its relation to geography. 
In doing so I shall endeavor to show that much may be done by the 
traveler on land and the seaman at sea in helping to fathom the mys- 
teries connected with the behavior of the freely suspended magnetic 
needle as it is carried about over that great magnet, the earth, l)y 
observations in different regions, and even in limited areas. 

I would, however, pause a moment to call attention to the presence 
of several distinguished meteorologists at this meeting, who will surely 
attract many to the consideration of matters connected with the impor- 
tant science of meteorology, which alread}' occupies considerable atten- 
tion from travelers. I feel sure, therefore, that geographers will be 
glad to accord a hearty welcome to the members of the International 
Meteorological Congress now assembled in this town, and especially 
to the foreign visitors who honor us by their presence. 

Some one may ask, What has terrestrial magnetism to do with 
geography? I reph. Excellent lectures on that subject of growing 
importance have been given imder the direct auspices of the Royal 

<« The president's address to Set^tiou E (geograpliy) at tlie SoutlipDrt meeting of 
tiie British Aseoeiation. Beprinle<l after revision by the author from tlie Scottish

Geographicul Society; one in LSTS by tiie late Cai)t. Sir Frederick 
Ev^an.s, and another in 1897 by Sir Arthur Kiicker. And I would here 
quote the opinion of Doctor Mill, when defining geography, in my sup- 
port: '■'Geography i.s the science which deals with the forms of the 
eartli's crust and with the influence which these forms exercise on the 
distril)ution of other phenomena." 

We know now that the normal distribution of the earth's magnetism 
for any epoch is in many localities seriously affected according as the 
natuic of the country surveyed be mountainous, or generally a plain, 
in the form of islands (or mountains standing out of the sea), and 
from land under the sea. There is also reason to suspect that the mag- 
netism of that portion of the earth covered by the oceans difiers in 
intensity from that of the dry land we inhabit. A connection between 
the disturbances of the elirtirs crust in earthcpiakes and disturbances 
of th(^ magnetic needle also seems to exist, although, the evidence on 
this point is not conclusive. 

MACXKTK" SURVEYS. 

Previously to the year LSSO there were two periods of exceptional 
activity on the part of contril)utors to our knowledge of the earth's 
magnetism, during which the scientific sailor in his ship on the track- 
less ocean combined with his brethren on land in making a magnetic 
surve}' of the globe. 

The first period was that of lcS-f8-l84l), during which not only were 
fixed observatories established at Toronto, Saint Helena, Capetown, 
and Hobart for hourly ol)servations of the movements of the magnetic 
needle, but to use Sabine's words, "that great national undertaking, 
the magnetic survey of the south polar regions of the glol^e,"' the fore- 
'?r of our present antarctic expedition, was accomplished by Ross 
and his companions almost entirely at sea. 

This antarctic survey was carried out during the years 1840-1845, 
and the results given to the world as soon as possible by Sabine. The 
results afterwards formed a valuable contribution when constructing 
his maps of equal lines of magnetic declination, inclination, and inten- 
sity for the whole world, a great work for the completion of which 
Sabine employed every available ol)servation made up to the year 1870. 
whether on land or at sea. 

Readers of these contributions can not fail to ])e struck with the 
great number of observations made by such travelers as Hansteen and 
Due, Erman and Wrangel, extending from wt^stern Europe to far 
into Sil)eria. 

The second period was thjit of 1S70-1SSU, during which not only was 
there nmcli activity among observers on land, but that expedition, so 
fruitful to science, the voyage of II. M. S. ClidUenijir^ took place. 
During the years 1872-1876 we find the sailor in the CJtalloKjcr doing 
most valuable work in carrying out a magnetic surve}" of certain por- 



TEEEESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 393 

tion.s of the great oceans, valuble not onh^ for needful uses in making 
charts for the seaman, but also as a contribution to magnetic science. 

Prior to this expedition very little was known from observation of 
the distribution of terrestrial magnetism in the central regions of the 
north and south Pacific oceans, and Sabine's charts are consequently 
defective there. 

Combining the ChallengermsigneticsLl results with those of all avail- 
able observations made by others of Her Majesty's ships and by colo- 
nial and foreign governments, 1 was enabled to compile the gharts of 
the magnetic elements for the epoch of 1880, which were published in 
the i-eport of the scientific results of H. M. S. Challenger. I will ven- 
ture to say that these charts give a fairly accurate representation of 
the normal distribution of the earth's magnetism between parallels of 
70- north and 40° south. Be3^ond these limits, either northward or 
southward, there is a degree of uncertainty about the value of the lines 
of equal value, especially in the southern regions — an uncertaint}' 
which we have reason to hope will be dissipated when we know the 
full results obtained by Captain Scott and the gallant band he com- 
mands, for as yet we have to be content with some eddies of the full 
tide of his success. 

Until the Discovery was built the ChaUemjerw^ifi the last vessel spe- 
cially selected with a view to obtaining magnetic observations at sea, 
so that for several years past results obtained on land have been our 
mainstay. Thus, elaborate magnetic surveys with fruitful results 
have been carried out in recent years in the British Isles by Kiicker 
and Thorpe. France, Germany, Holland, and some smaller districts 
in Europe have also been carefully surveyed, and British India par- 
tially so, b\' Messrs. Schlagintweit in 1857-58. The latter country is 
being again magnetically surve3'ed under the auspices of the Indian 
government. 

On the American continent the coast and geodetic survey of the vast 
territories comprised in the United States, which has been so many 
years in progress, has been accompanied by an extended magnetic sur- 
ve}^ during the last fifty-two years, which is now under the able direc- 
tion of Dr. L. A. Bauer. Resulting from this some excellent charts 
of the magnetic declination in the United States have been published 
from time to time, and the last, for the epoch 190"^, is based upon S,(M)U 
observations. 

There are other contributions to terrestrial magnetism for positions 
on various coasts from the surveying service of the royal navy, and 
our ships of war are constantly assisting Avith their ([uota to the mag- 
netic declination, or variation, as sailors prefer to call it; and wisel}^ 
so, I trow, for have they not the declination of the sun and other 
heavenly bodies constantly in use in the computation of their ship's 
position? 



394 TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 

This work of the royal na\y and the Indian marine is one of great 
importance, l>oth in the interests of practical naviojition and of science; 
for besides the equipment of instrmnents for absolute determinations 
of the declination, dip, and horizontal force supplied to certain of our 
surveying ships, every seagoing vessel in the service carries a landing 
compass, specially tested, by means of which the declination can be 
observed with considerable accuracy on land. 

Although observers of many other oljjects may still speak of their 
''heritaoe, the sea," as a mine of wealth waiting for them to explore, 
unfortunately for magnetic observations, we can no longer say "the 
hollow oak our palace is,"" for wood has been everywhere replaced by 
iron or steel in our ships, to the destruction of accurate ol^servations 
of dip and foi'ce on board of them. Experience, howevei-, lias shown 
that verv useful results, as regards the declination, can be obtained 
every time a ship is ''swung," either for that purpose alone or in the 
or(linar\' course of ascei'taining tlie ei'rors of tho compass due to the 
iron or steel of the sliip. 

As an example of this method, th(^ cruise of the training scjuadron 
to Spitzbergen and Norway in isnr) may ])e cited, when several most 
useful observations were made at sea in regions })ut seldom visited. 
Again, only this year a. squadron of our ships cruising together near 
Madagascar separated to a distance of a mile ai)art and "swung" to 
ascertain the declination. 

I would here note that all the magnetic observations made by the 
officers of Her Majesty's shi[)s during the years 189»)-1 !♦()() have ])een 
published in a convenient form by the hydrographic departiuent of 
the Admiralty. 

The fact remains, howe^■er, that a great portion of the world, other 
than the coasts, continues unknown to the searching action of the 
magnetic needle, while the two-thirds of the globe covered b}' water 
is still worse otf. Among other regions I would specify Africa, 
which, apart from the coasts, Cape Colony, and the Nile valley to lat- 
itude oi'^ north, is absolutely a new field for the observer. 

]Moreov(M', the elaborate surveys I have mentioned show how much 
the results depend upon the nature of the locality. I am therefore 
convinc(Hl that travelers on land, proAided witii a proper eipiipment 
of instruments for conducting a land survey of the strange countries 
which they may visit, and mapping the same correctly, can, with a 
small addition to the weight they have to carry, make a valuable con- 
tribution to our knowdedge of terrestrial magnetism, conunencing with 
ol)servations at their principal stations and tilling in the intermediate 
space with as man}- others as circumstances will permit. 



TEERESTRTAL MAGNETISM. 395 

THE ANTAltOTIf EXPP^DITION. 

Of the nuit>"netic work of our iiiitarctic expedition we know that 
since the Discovery entered the pack — and, as far as terrestrial mag- 
netism is concerned, upon the most important part of that work — 
every opportunity has been seized for making observations. 

Lyttelton, New Zeahmd (where there is now a reguhir fixed niagnetic 
observatory), was made the primary southern base station of the expedi- 
tion; the winter quarters of the Discorery^ the secondary southern base 
station. Before settling down in winter quarters, magnetic observa- 
tions were made on board the ship during the cruise to and from the 
most easterly position attained oft' King Edward VII Land in lati- 
tude 76^ south, longitude 152i west, and she was successfully swung 
oft' Cape Crozier to ascertain the disturl)ing eftects of the iron upon 
the compasses and dip and force instruments mounted in the ship's 
observatory. 

As a ship fitted to meet the most stormy seas and to bufi'et with the 
ice, the Discovery has been a great success. Let me add another 
tribute to her value. From Spithead until she reached New Zea- 
land but small corrections were required for reducing the observations 
made on board. The experience of Ross''s Antarctic expedition had, 
however, taught the lesson that two wood-built ships, the Erelms and 
Terror^ with but some 3 to -i degrees of deviation of the compass at 
Simons Bay, South Africa, found as much as 56 degrees of deviation 
at their position farthest south, an amount almost prohi])itory of good 
results l)eing obtained on board. 

How fared the Discovery? I have been told bj^ Lieutenant Shackle- 
ton — for whose return to England on account of his health we must 
all feel great sympathy — that a maximum of onl}" 11 degrees of devia- 
tion was observed at her most southerh' position. From this w(^ may 
look forward hopefully to magnetic results of a value hitherto unat- 
tained in those reg"ions. 

At winter quarters, besides the monthly absolute o])scrvations of 
the magnetic elements, the Eschenhagen variometers or self -register- 
ing instruments for continuously recording the changes in the declina- 
tion, horizontal force, and vertical force were esta))lished, and in 
good working order at the tinic^ appointed for commencing the 3'ear''s 
observations. 

I may here remind you that some time previously to the departure 
of the British and German Antarctic expeditions a scheme of coopera- 
tion had been established between them, according to which observa- 
tions of exactly the same nature, with the same form of vai'iometers, 
were to ))e carried out at their respective winter quarters during a 
whole year, commencing March 1, 1902. Besides the continuous 
o])servations with the \:iii<)ineters, regular term da^'s and term hours 



396 TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 

were agreed upon for ()l)tainino- speciiil ohstM'vutioiis with them ;it the 
same moment of (h'eenwich meiiii time. Both expeditions have suc- 
cessfully completed this part of their intended work. 

To cooperate in like manner with these far southern stations, the 
Argentine Government sent a special party of observers to Staten 
Island, near Cape Horn, and the Germans another to Kerguelen Land, 
whilst New Zealand entered heartily into the work. In additon, similar 
observations were arranged to he made in certain British and colonial 
observatories, which include Kew, Falmouth, Bombay. Mauritius, and 
Melbourne; also in German and other foreign observatories. 

We have all read thrilling accounts of the journeys of the several 
traveling parties which set out from the Discorery^ and of the immi- 
nent dangers to life they encountered and how^ they happily escaped 
them except one brave fellow named Vince. who disappeared over one 
of those mighty ice cl ill's, upon which all Antarctic voyagers descant, 
into the sea. In s})itc of all this there is a record of magnetic ol)ser- 
vations taken on these joTiriK^ys of which oidy an outline has yet been 
given. Anticipations of the value of these ohscr\ations are somewhat 
clouded when we read in one report- that hills "more inland were com- 
posed of granite rock, split and broken, as well as weatherworn, into 
extraordinary shapes. The lower or more outer hills consisted of 
quartz, etc., with basaltic dikes cutting through them.'' Conse- 
(luently, we have to fear the etiects of local magnetic disturbances of 
the needle in the land observations, while buoyed up with th(> hope 
of obtaining normal results on board the ship. 

Judging from some land obs(n-vations which have' been received it 
appears that considerable changes ha\'e taken place in the values of 
the magnetic elements in the regions we are considering, but wdien 
making comparisons w^e have to remember the sixty years which have 
elapsed since Ross's time, and that he had nothing like the advantage 
of steam for his ships, or of instruments of precision like our present 
ship Dlscovrij. His ships also were, as we have already remarked, 
much worse magnetically, causing far more serious disturbance of the 
instruments. Hence the changes we note may not be entirely due to 
changes in the earth's magnetism. 

The ()l)servations made by the officers of the Southern Cross at Cape 
Adare in lSl>l»-l!t(»u also contribute to this ([uestion of magnetic change. 

THE MAGNETIC POLES OF THE EARTH. 

1 will noW' refer to those two areas on the globe where the dipping 
needle stands vertically, known as the magnetic poles. The determina- 
tion of the exact position of these areas is of great importance to 
magnetic science, and I will just glance at what is being done to solve 
the problem. 



TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. ' 397 

Let us consider the North Pole first, the approximate position of 
which we know best from observation. If one were aslvtnl to say exactly 
where that pole has been in observation times, whether it has moved, 
or where it now is, the answer must be, *■' 1 do not know.*" It is true 
that Ross in 1831, by a single observation, considered that he had lixed 
its position, and 1 believe hoisted the British flag over the spot, taking- 
possession thereof; but he may or may not have set up his dip circle 
over a position affected by serious magnetic disturbance, and therefore 
we must still be donbtful of his complete success from a magnetic 
point of view. Although eminent mathematicig-ns have calculated its 
position, and Neumayer in 1885 gave a place to it on his charts of that 
year, we have still to wait for observation to settle the question, for 
one epoch at least. 

Happily, I am able to repeat the good news that the Norweijian^ 
Capt. Koald Anuuidsen, sailed in June last with the express object of 
making a magnetic survev of Ross's position and of the surrounding- 
regions, in order to tix the position of the north magnetic pole. 
Furnished with suitable instruments of the latest pattern, he proposes 
to continue his investigations until 1905, when we may look for his 
return and the fulfillment of our hopes. 

As far as we can now see, the south magnetic pole can not be 
approached very nearly l)y the traveler, and we can only lay siege to it 
by observing at stations some distance off, but encircling it. We have 
our own expedition on one side of it, and now with the return of the 
Gauss to South Africa in June last we have learned that that vessel 
wintered in latitude 66^ 2' south, longitude 89° 48' east, a position on 
the opposite side of the supposed site of the magnetic pole to that of 
the Discovery. We may now pause to record our warm congratula- 
tions to Doctor von Drygalski and his companions on their safe return, 
accompanied by the welcome report that their expedition has proved 
successful. 

In addition to the British and German expeditions, there are the 
Swedish expedition and the Scottish expedition. Therefore, with so 
many nationalities working in widely dift'erent localities surrounding 
it, we have every reason to expect that the position of the south mag- 
netic pole will be determined. 

THE SECULAll CHANOE. 

When, in the year 1600, Gilbert announced to the world that the 
earth is a great magnet, he believed it to be a stable magnet; and it 
was left to Gellibrand, some thirty-four years latei-. by his discovery of 
the annual change of the magnetic declination near London, to show 
that this could hardly be the case. Ever since then the i-emarkal)le and 
unceasing changes in the magnetism of the(>arth have been the subject 
of constant observation bv magneticians and of investigation h\ some 



398 - TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 

of the iiWlcst |)hil()Sophers in Europe and America. Year after year 
new (lata are amassed as to the cliang-es o-oing on in the distribution of 
the niaonetisni of the earth, but as yet we have been favored ])y 
hypotheses only as to the causes of the wondrous changes which the 
magnetic needle records. 

These hvpotheses were at one time chiefiv based upon a considera- 
tion of the secular change in the declination, but it is now certain that 
we must take into account the whole phenomena connected with the 
movements of the needle if we are to arri\e at any satisfactory result. 
Besides, it will not suffice to take our data solely from existing fixed 
observatories, however relatively well placed and equipped, and 
valuable as they certainh^ are, for it now appears that the secular 
change is i)aitly dependent upon locality, and that even at places not 
many miles apart differences in results unaccounted for by distance 
have been obtained. 

The tendency of observation is increasingly to show that the secu- 
lar change of the magnetic elements is not a world-wide progress of 
the magnetic needle moving regularly in certain directions, as if solely 
caused by the regular rotation during a long series of years of the 
magnetic poles round the geographical poles, for if you examine Map 
No. 1,^' showing the results of observations during the years 184()--1.SS(), 
as regards secular change, vou will observe that there are local causes 
at work in certain regions, whilst in others there is rest, which must 
largelv modify the effect of any polar rotation. 

Allow me to explain further. The plain lines on Map No. 1 indicate 
approximate regions of no secular change in the declination, and the 
small arrows the general direction (not the amount) in which the north- 
seeking end of the horizontal needle was moving during those forty 
3^ears. The foci of greatest change in the declination, with the approxi- 
mate amount of annual change in the Northern Hemisphere, are shoAvn 
in the German Ocean and northwestern Alaska, in the Southern Hemis- 
phere off' the coast of Brazil, and in the South Pacific between New 
Zealand and Cape Horn. The two foci of greatest annual change in 
the dip are shown — one in the Gulf of Guinea, where the north-seeking 
end of the needle was being repelled strongly upward; the other on the 
west side of Tierra del Fuego, where the north-seeking end of the 
needle was being attracted strongly downward. 

It is remarkal)le that the lines of no change in the declination pass 
through the foci of greatest change in the dip. If the needle be repelled 
upward, as at the Gulf of Guinea focus, it will be found to be moving 
to the (nistward on the east side of the whole line of no change in the 
declination from the Cape of Good Hope to Labrador; to the westward, 
on the west side. If the needle be attracted downward, as at the Tierra 



«Origiiuilly prepared ])y the autlior for the " MaKnetical Results," H. M.S. Cliallenyer. 



TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 399 

del Fuego focus, it will !)«' found moving to the westwai'd on the east 
side of the whole line of no declination from that focus to near Van- 
couver Island; to the eastward on the west side. 

A similar result may be seen in the line passing through a minor 
focus of the dip near Hongkong. 

Judging from analogy, there should be another focus of change in 
the dip in latitude T0° north, longitude 115'- east, or about the posi- 
tion assigned to the Siberian focus of greatest force. " 

On Map No. 2 are shown lines of equal value of the declination — the 
red lines for the year 1880, the black lines for the year 189.5. From 
these, when shown on a large scale, w^e may deduce the mean annual 
change which has taken place in the declination during the fifteen 
years elapsed. 

In this map we are reminded of the ditferent results we obtain in 
diti'ereiit localities; for if a line be drawn from Wellington, in New 
Zealand, past Cape York, in Australia, to Hongkong, little or no 
change will be found in the neigh])oring region since 1810. Again, 
the line of no change in the declination shown on Map No. 1, to be 
following nuich the same direction as the great mountain ranges on 
the west side of the American Continent, has hardly moved for many 
years, according to the observations available. 

On the other hand, let us now turn to an example of the remarkable 
changes which may take place in the declination unexpectedly and 
locally. The island of Zanzibar and the east coast of Africa were con- 
stantly being visited b}^ our surveying ships and ships of war up to 
the year 1880, observations of the declination being made every year 
at Zanzibar during the epoch 1870-1880, The results showed that from 
Cape Town nearly to Cape Guardafui the annual change of that element 
hardly exceeded 1'. 

During the succeeding years of l81H»-!tl o1)servations were made I)}' 
the Germans at Dar-es-Salaam and some other places on the neighbor- 
ing coasts, with the result that the declination was found to he chang- 
ing at first 3 minutes annually, and since that period it had leached 10 
to 12 minutes at Dar-es-Salaam. Subsequent observations at the 
latter place in 1896-1898 confirmed the fact of the great change, ;uid 
in addition our surveying ship on the station, specially ordered to 
"swing" at different places in deep water off the coast, generally con- 
firmed the results. It is remarkable that while such great changes 
should have taken place between (-ape Town and (^ape Guardafui, 
Aden and the region a])out the St I'aifs of lia)) el Maiidel) seem to be 
comparatively unafi'ected. 

''The results described in (he four precediiii,' paragraplis aiul given in Maj) No. 1 
were also exhibited on a 12-inch glohe with tlie addition of magnetic nieridiann for 
the epoch 1880, terminating in the MippoHcd positions of the magnetic poles. This 
12-inch globe is now in the South Kensington Museum, London. 



400 TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 

LOCAL MAGNETIC DISTURBAXCK. 

Ill Map No. 2 iiorinal lines of equal value of the declination are 
reoorded, and a.s far as the greater part of the globe covered bj' water 
is concerned we may accept them as undisturbed values, for we have 
yet to learn that there are any local mag-netic disturbances of the needle 
in depths be3"ond 100 fathoms. 

When, however, we come' to the land, there is an increasing diffi- 
culty in finding districts of only a few miles in extent wdiere the 
observed values of the magnetic elements at different stations therein 
do not differ more widely than the\" should if we considered only their 
relative position on the earth as a magnet. Take Riicker and Thorpe's 
maps of the British Isles and those of the United States, for example, 
where the lines of equal value are drawn in accordance with the 
observations, with the result that they form extraordinary loops and 
curves differing largely from the normal curves of calculation. 

From among numerous examples of disturbance of the declination 
on land, two may be quoted. In the Rapakivi district, near Wiborg, 
a Kussian surveying officer in the vear 1890 observed a disturbance of 
180 degrees, or. in other words, the north point of his compass pointed 
due south. At Invercarg.ill, in New Zealand, within a circle of 80 feet 
radius a difference of 50 degrees was found. Even on board ships in 
the same har})()r different results are sometimes observed, as our train- 
ing xjuadron found at Reikiavik, in Iceland, and notably in our ships 
at Bermuda. 

It is hardly necessary to add that the dip and force are often largelj' 
subject to like disturbance, but I do so in order to warn trav^elers and 
surveyors that observations in one position often convev but a partial 
truth; thev should be supplemented by as mam' more as possit)le in the 
neighborhood or district. Erroneous values of the secular change have 
also been pul)lished from the various observers not having occupied 
exactly the same spot, and even varied heights of the instrument from 
the ground may make a serious difference, as at Rapakivi, before men- 
tioned, and at Madeira, where the officers of the Challenger expedition 
found the dip at a foot above the ground to be -18- 46' north: at 8i 
feet above the ground, 56° 18' north, at the .same spot. 

All mountainous districts are specially open to suspicion of magnetic 
distui-t)ance. and we know from comparison with normal ol)servations 
at sea that those mountains standing out of the deep sea, which we call 
islands, are considerably so affected. 

MAGNETIC SHOALS. 

The idea that the compasses of ships could be affected by the attrac- 
tion of the neighboring diT land, causing those ships to be unsus- 
pectingly diverted from their correct course, was long a favorite 
theory of those who discussed the causes of shipwreck, but it was '"a 



TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 401 

fond rhino- vainly invented/"' 1 can hardly say this idea is yet exploded, 
but from what has already l>een said about local magnetic disturl)ance 
on land, it is not a matter of surprise that similar sources of disturb- 
ance should exist in the laud under the sea, for it has been found that 
in certain localities, in depths of water suthcient to float the largest 
ironclad, considerable disturbances are caused in the compasses of 
ships. 

An area of remarkable disturl)ance having been reported as existing- 
ofl[' Cossack, northwestern Australia, II. M. S. Penguin^ a surveying ship 
provided with the necessary magnetic instruments, was sent by the 
Admiralty in 18*.*1 to make a complete magnetic survey of the localit}', 
W'ith a view^ to ascertaining the facts and placing them on a scientilic 
basis.' An area of disturbance 3.5 miles long by 2 miles broad, with 
not less than S fathoms of AViiter over it, was found h'ing in a north- 
east b}" east and southwest by west direction. At one position the dis- 
turbing force was sufficient to deflect t\\Q, Penguin'' s compass .56 degrees; 
in another — the focus of i)rincipal disturbance — the dip on board was 
increased by 29 degrees, and this at a distance of over 2 miles from 
the nearest visible land, upon which only a small disturbance of the 
dip was found. 

This remarkable area of disturbance was then called a "magnetic 
shoal."" a term which at rirst sight hai'dly appears to be applicable. We 
have, however, become familiar with the terms '' ridge line, \alley line, 
peak, and col," as applied to areas of magnetic disturl)ance on land; 
therefore I think we may con^'eniently designate areas of magnetic 
disturbance in land luider the sea "magnetic shoals."* 

This year His Majesty's surveying ship Re^eni'ch has examined and 
placed a magnetic shoal in East Loch Roag (island of Lewis), l)ut as 
all our surveying .ships are practically iron ships, it was impossible 
from observations on board to oV)tain the exact values of the disturb- 
ing forces prevailing in this shoal. The reason for this is that, 
although we may accurately measure the disturbing forces of the iron 
of the ship in deep water, directly she is placed over the shoal induc- 
tion takes place, and wt^ can no longei- determine to what extent the 
observed disturl)ances are due to the ship's newly developed magnet- 
ism, or to whiit extent the shoal alone produces them. 

We can, nevertheless, even in an iron ship, accurately place and 
show the dimensions of a magni^tic shoal and the direction in which a 
ship's compass will ])e detlected in any part of it by compass observa- 
tions only. Is it not, therefore, the duty of any ship meeting with 
such shoals to stop and flx their position^ 

The general law governing the distribution of magnetism on these 
magnetic shoals is that in the Northern Hemisphere the north point of 
the compass is drawn toward the focus of greatest dip: in the Southern 
Hemis[)here it is repelled. The results at East Loch Koag proved an 
exception, the north point ot" the compass being repelled. 



402 TERRESTEIAL MAGNETISM. 

TERRKSrUIAL MACiNETISM AND (lEOTAKiY. 

1 hiivc iilrciuly refenvtl to tlic (juestioii of local magnetic disturbance 
as one of great importance in magnetic surveys. The causes of these 
disturl)ances were at one time a matter of opinion, l)ut the evidence of 
the ela})orate magnetic surveys 1 have alluded to, when compared with 
the geological maps of the same countries, ])<)ints clearly to magnetic 
rocks as their chief origin. 

Magnetic rocks may ))e present, but from their peculiar position fail 
to distui-b the needle; on the other hand, as lliicker writes in his 
sunnnary of the results of the great magnetic survey' of the British 
Isles conducted by Thorpe and himself, "'the magnet would be capable 
of detecting large masses of magnetic rock at a depth of several miles," 
a distance not yet attained by the science of the geologist. 

Again, Doctor Rijckevorsel, in his survey of Holland for the epoch 
1891, was convinced that "''in some cases, in many, perhaps, there 
must be a direct relation between geology and terrestrial magnetism, 
and that many of the magnetic features nuist he in some way deter- 
mined by the geological structure of the underground.'' 

During the years 189T-1.S!)9 a nuignetic survey was made of the 
Kaiserstuhl, a mountainous district in the neigh])orhood of Freil)urg, 
in Baden, by Dr. G. Meyer. Exact topographical and geological sur- 
veys had l)een previousl}' made, and the ol)ject of the magnetic survey 
was to show how far the magnetic disturl)ances of the needle were con- 
nected with geological contirmations. Here, again, it was found that 
the magnetic and geological features of the district showed consider- 
able agreement, basaltic rocks being the origin of the disturbance. 
This was not all, for in the level country adjacent to the Rhine and 
near Breisach unsuspected masses of basalt were found by the agency 
of the magnetic needle. 

More recentl}^ we find our naval officers in H. M. S. Pengiiln^ with 
a complete outfit of magnetic instruments, making a magnetic surve}'^ 
of Funafuti atoll and assisting the geologist l)y pointing out, by means 
of the observed distui'bance of the needle, the probabh^ positions in 
the lagoon in which rock would ))(» most accessible to their boring 
apparatus. 

Lea\'ing the geologist and the magnetician to work in harmony for 
th(Mr common weal, let us turn to some other aspects of the good work 
already accomplished and to be accomplished by magnetic observers. 

MAGNETIC CHARTS. 

Of the valuable work of the several fixed magnetic observatories of 
the world, 1 may remark that the}' are constantly recording the never- 
ceasing movements of the needle, the kej^ to man}^ mysteries to science 
existing in th(^ world and external to it, but of which we have not 3'et 
learned the use. Unfortunately, many of these once fixed observatories 



TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 403 

have Ix'come travelers to positions where the earth can carry on its 
work on the needle undisturbed l>v electric trams and railways which 
have sprung" up near theui, and it is to be hoped thej' will tind rest 
there for man\^ years to come. 

Of the 42 observatories which publish the values of the magnetic 
elements obtained there, 32 are situated northward of the parallel of 
30 degrees north, and onl}- -i in south latitude; and it is a grief to 
magneticians that so important a })osition as Cape Town or its neigh- 
borhood does not make an additional fixed magnetic observatory of the 
iirst order. 

Thus, as far as our present (Question of magnetic charts and their 
compilation is concerned, the observatories do not contri1)utc largely, 
but we should be very grateful to them for the accurate o})servations 
of the secular change they providi^ which are so difticult to obtain else- 
where. 

Of the value of magnetic charts for difi'erent epochs I huxe nuich to 
sa}^ as they are requiret^l for purely scientific in<iuiry as well as for 
practical uses. It is only b}- their means that we can realh' compare 
the enormous changes which take place in the magnetism of the globe 
as a whole; the}^ are useful to the miner, but consid(n-al)ly more so to 
the seaman. Had it not been for the chart., compiled from the results 
of the untiring labors of travelers by^ land and observers at sea in the 
field of terrestrial magnetism during the last century, not only would 
science have been miserably poorer, but it is not too much to sa}" that 
the modern iron or steel steamship traversing the ocean on the darkest 
night at great speed would have been almost an impossibility, whereas 
with their aid the modern navigators can drive their ships at a speed 
of 26.5 statute miles an hour with comparative confidence, even when 
neither sun, moon, nor stars are appearing. 

Of the large number of travelers In^sea, including those who embark 
with the purpose of increasing our geographical knowledge of distant 
lands and busying themselves with most useful inquiries into the geol- 
ogy, l)otan3% zoology, and meteorology of the regions they visit, few 
realize that when they set foot on board ship (for all ships are now 
constructed of iron or steel) they are living inside a magnet. Truly 
a magnet, having become one by the inductiv<^ action of that great 
parent magnet— the earth. 

How fares the compass on l)oard those magnets, the ships, that 
instrument so indispensable to navigatioi\, wliich Victor Hugo has 
forcibly called '* th(> soul of the ship,'' and of which it has been written, 

A rusted nail, placed near tiie faithful compaws, 
Will sway it from the truth, and wreek an arffrwy. 

And if so small a thing as an iron nail Ite a danger, what are we to sa}^ 
to the iron ship ^ Let us for a moment consider this imi)ortant matter. 



404 TEKRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 

If the nature of tlie whole of the iron or .steel used in construction 
of ships were such as to become permanently magnetic, their naviga- 
tion would ])e much simplitied, as our knovvledoe of terrestrial mag- 
netism would enable us to pro^•ide correctors for an^^ disturbing effects 
of such iron on the compass, which would then point correctly. But 
ships, taken as a whole, are general!}' more or less unstable magnets, 
and constantly sul)ject to change, not only on ciiaiige of geographical 
position, but also of direction of the ship's head with regard to the 
magnetic meridian. Thus, a ship st(»ering on an easterh' course ma}^ 
be temporarily magnetized to a certain extent, ])ut t)n reyersing the 
ship's course to west she would after a time ])ecome tem])orarily mag- 
netized to the same amount but in the opposite direction, the north 
point of tlie compass being attracted in each case to that side of the 
ship which is southernmost. 

Shortly, w(^ in^i}" dehne the action of the earth's magnetism on the 
iron of a ship as follows: The earth being surrounded by a magnetic 
field of force differing greatly in intensity and direction in the regions 
from the north pole to the equator and the equator to the south pole, 
the ship's magnetic condition is largeh^ dependent upon the direction 
of her head Avhile building and the part of that iield she occupied at 
the time; partly upon her ])osition in the magnetic field she traverses 
at any given time during a voyage. 

For the reasons J have given, magnetic charts are a necessit}^ for 
practical purposes and in the following order of value: That of the 
magnetic declination of variation which is constantly in use, especially 
in such parts of the world as the Saint Lawrence and the approaches 
to the English Channel, where the declination changes very rapidly as 
the ship proceeds on her course. Next, that of the dip and force, 
which are not only immediately usef id when correcting the ship's com- 
pass, but are required in the anah'sis of a ship's magnetism ])oth as 
regards present knowledge and future improvements in placing com- 
passes on board. 

If astronomers have for a very long time ])een able to publish for 
several years in advance exact data concerning the heavenly bodies, is 
it too nuich to hope that magneticians will before long also be able to 
pu])lish correct magnetic charts to cover several 3"ears in advance of 
any present epoch? If this is to be done within reasonable time, there 
nmst be a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together of magnetic 
observers in all lands, and accuuudated datii must also be discussed. 

ON MACNKTIC INSTRUMENTS FOli THAVELKKS. 

Traveleivs in unsvu'veyed countries, if properly instructed and 
equipped, can do good ser^'ice to science by observing the three mag- 
netic elements of declination, inclination or dip, and force at as many 
stations as circumstances will permit. Hence the following remarks: 



TEERESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 405 

For the purpose of making the most exact magnetic sui'vey the best 
equipment of instruments consists of the well-known unitilar magneto- 
meter, with fittings for observing the declination, and a Bari'ow dip 
circle. To some travelers these instruments might be found too 1)ulky, 
and in some regions too delicate, as well as heavy to carry. 

Of suitable instruments made abroad, those used by M. Moureaux 
in his surve}^ of France may be mentioned, as they are of similar 
type, but much smaller and lighter than tlie instruments above 
mentioned. 

Another form of instrument used for observing both the inclination 
and total force is called an "L. C." instrument. Originally designed 
for observations on board ships at sea, where the ordinary magnetic 
instruments above mentioned are immanageable, it lias also been found 
to give satisfactor}^ results in a land survey, where greater accuracy 
is expected than at sea. Thus, during a series of observations extend- 
ing from the north side of Lake Superior to the southern part of Texas 
last year, comparisons were made between the results obtained with an 
L. C. instrument and those of the regular unitilar magnetometer and 
dip circle, when the agreement was found satisfactory. 

I am therefore of the opinion that a traveler furnished with a the- 
odolite for land-surveying purposes, but fitted with a reversible mag- 
netic needle, can at any time he observes a true bearing obtain a 
trustworthy value of the declination. Dismounting the theodolite from 
his tripod, the latter will serve for mounting an L. C. instrument with 
which to observe the inclination and force. Thus, by adding to his 
ordinary equipment an instrument weighing in its box about 21 pounds 
he can obtain valuable contributions to terrestrial magnetism and at 
the same time give useful assistance to geological investigations. 

CONCLUDING REMARKS. 

Although a great subject like terrestrial magnetism, even to exhibit 
our present knowledge of the science, can not be brought within the 
compass of an address — for it requires a treatise of many pages — 1 have 
brought some of the broad features of it before the section in order to 
show its connection with geography. 

I also entertain the hope that geographers will b(>comc more inter- 
ested in a subject so important to pui-e science and in its practical 
applications, and that it will become an additional subject to the instruc- 
tion which travelers can now obtain under the auspices of the Royal 
Geographical Society in geology, botanv, zoology, meteorology, and 
surveying. 

There is a wide field open to ol)servers, and w here results often 
depejid so nuich upon locality we require to explore more and more 
with the magnetic needle. To look over the great oceans and think 
how little is being done for terrestrial magnetism is a great matter for

regret. Yet even there we ma}^ begin to be more than hopeful, for 
the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey authorities are making- 
arrangements to tit out its vessels with the necessary instruments for 
determining the magnetic elements at sea. 

We wish them all success; but I must again remind you that 
although we can not compel observers to start, there is room for them 
and to spare. 

I would fain make some remarks on the prevailing ignorance of 
sound geography in many (quarters and on the defective methods of 
teaching the science; ])ut I feel that the subject is placed in very able 
hands and will be fully discussed in Section L during the present 
meeting. 



AN EXPLORATION TO MOUNT McKINLEY, AMERICA'S 
HIGHEST MOUNTAIN." 



By Alfred H. Brooks. 



Alaska's southern shore line makes a ])road, crescentic sweep, embrac- 
ing- that part of the northern Paciiic known as the '" Gulf of Alaska." 
Of the many indentations which give this coast its jagged outline the 
largest is Cook Inlet, a deep embajmient in the western arm of tlie 
crescent, which stretches northward for 150 miles from the headlands 
marking its entrance. There it receives the turbid waters of the 
Sushitna River, laden with the silt of glaciers which have their source 
in the great Alaskan Range lying northwest of the valle}". (See map, 
plate II.) 

This Ak^skan Range curves in a rugged mass around the headwaters 
of the Sushitna, forming the divide between the Cook Inlet drainage 
on the south and the waters flowing into Bering Sea through the Kus- 
kokwim and Yukon rivers on the north. The southern end of the 
range lies in an unexplored region to the west of Cook Inlet, but 
probably does not include any peaks over 7,00U or 8,000 feet high. 
Toward the north its relief increases, culminating in Mount McKinley, 
over 20.000 feet^ in altitude, and the highest mountain on the North 
American continent. 

Strange as it ma}' seem, though this mountain has been known to 
white men for upward of a century — it is plainly visible from tide 
water at Cook Inlet and from many points in the Yukon Basin — 3'et 
until ver}' recent years it did not appear on any map atid was barely 
referied to in literature. When the famous navigator Captain Cook 
in 1778 spent a few weeks exploring the inlet which now bears his 
name, the clouds hung low, or the mountain would not have escaped 
his attention. 

Vancouver, fifteen ^-ears later, while extending Cook's surveys in 
the inlet, probabl}^ also had no view of it, though he distinctl}^ men- 
tions the range. The Russians, who carried on their fur trade on this

coast for over half a centurj-, knew the mountain and called it ^ Biil- 
shaia," which, like the native name "" Trolika," signified " high moun- 
tain ; " but Russian literature on Alaska, so far as we know, contains 
no reference to this important geographical feature. Lieut. Henrj^ T. 
Allen, too, who, in 1885, made his hazardous exploration of the lower 
Tanana, saw this peak, liut at so great a distance that he was not spe- 
cially impressed with its altitude. 

Thus it was that explorers and traders did not seem to be aware that 
they had sighted the highest peak on the continent. When, in 1895, 
scores of prospectors were attracted to Cook Inlet by the discover}- of 
gold, they, too, saw the mountain, but apparently gave it no thought 
until the following year, when one of them, W. A. Dickey, recognized 
its importance, and upon his return published a description of it and 
proposed the name Mount McKinley. Though the mountain had been 
known to white men for over a centur}-, and though scores of others 
had been as near it as this prospector, or nearer, he was termed the 
discoverer of Mount McKinley. All honor to him for calling attention 
to it, but let us not make the absurd blimder of crediting him with its 
discovery. 

Two 3"ears after the naming of the mountain, George H. Eldridge 
and Robert Muldrow^ of the United States Geological Survey, in the 
course of their exploration of the Sushitna River, located it accurately 
and determined its altitude at over 20,000 feet. Its height and posi- 
tion were thus known, and something of the character of the southern 
flank of the range above which it towers. The northern face of the 
range and the base of the mountain remained to be explored, and this 
was the task assigned to me as part of the general S3^stem of explora- 
tory surve3^s undertaken by the Geological Survey in Alaska. I was 
fortunate in having as associates in this enterprise Messrs. D. L. Rea- 
burn and L. M. Prindle, as well as four able and enthusiastic camp 
men. 

On May 27, 1902, the vessel bearing our party steamed slowly up 
Cook Inlet. Hardl}' a ripple stirred the water, and through the hazy 
atmosphere we could barely discern the outline of the low coast, beyond 
which, in a bank of clouds, lay the high mountain range which we 
were to explore. At noon we dropped anchor at Tyonok, a small 
native settlement on the west shore of the Inlet with one trading post 
and a white population of half a dozen men. (See plate iii.) 

We were forced to wait until the evening tide floated a large scow 
destined to convey our horses to the shore. These, in spite of much 
struggling and kicking on their part, were then unceremoniously hoisted 
out of the hold and dropped over the side into the scow. The landing 
was attended with some excitement, for the horses, restless after their 
two week's confinement, exhibited a strong desire to leave the narrow 
gangway which reached the beach. One little brute satisfied his curi-

osity by leaping into the sea, but was promptly hauled out, and on 
striking- the beach took to his heels. After the entire outfit had been 
dragged ashore by the infinite labor of all hands, the presence of great 
numbers of Indians and dogs necessitated a guard, so I stood watch 
while the others slept. The chilly night air made the employment of 
chasing the Indian or '"Siwash" dogs, as they are called, not unaccept- 
able. A relief was called at 5, and I turned in and slept as one only 
can sleep who has been active for twenty-four hours. 

The important question was which route should be chosen to the 
base of the mountains, for the crossing of the swampy and_ heavily 
timbered lowland area which interA'ened presented the most serious 
difficulties. The agent of the trading company, who was first interro- 
gated, was rather skeptical of the proposed plans; and well he might 
be, for he had seen more than one exploring expedition start out with 
high hopes only to return disappointed a few months later. Should 
we go westward directly toward the mountains our northeasterly 
course along the base of the range would be blocked b}^ glaciers; should 
we take a more northerly" course we would become lost in a maze of 
swamps and encounter a number of turbulent rivers. Such were the 
stories told by the white men, and the Indians, who were assembled in 
solemn conclave, were equall}" discouraging. 

Through the medium of signs, eked out by a few Russian words, I 
held a long parley with an old Indian chief over a map of his hunting 
grounds which he drew for me, but when I pointed out my proposed 
route far beyond the bounds of his knowledge he gravely shook his 
head as if to sa}' that I was attempting the impossible. Some of the 
more experienced traders admitted that we might reach the base of 
the range during the course of the summer, but when we unfolded our 
plans for extending our journey to the Tanana, and even the Yukon, 
they smiled knowingly and told us when we could catch the last steamer 
in the fall, before the ice blocked Cook Inlet. 

As a matter of fact, the "zone of influence" of many of the long- 
established Alaskan trading posts extends hardh' a day's journey from 
the settlement, and many traders of long residence are astonishinglv 
ignorant of the "hinterland." The Indian's knowledge is always con- 
fined to the hunting grounds of his tribe, and he is apt to regard the 
region beyond Aery much as the old cartographer represented unex- 
plored areas, as the abode of hideous monsters. He magnifies unknown 
dangers, and this fact, together with his ignorance of the use of horses, 
makes his advice in regard to routes of little value. 

The part}' paid small heed to the stories of dire failure and disaster 
which were recounted, for all but two of its members were veterans 
of thi-ee or four years' standing in Alaskan explorations and had made 
more tiian one successful trip in the face of similar gloomy prophecies. 
While some were reconnoitering to choose a route, the packers, Fred 



410 AN EXPLORATION TO MOUNT McKINLEY. 

and Von, were busy breaking in such of the horses as were unused to 
packing — an operation which afforded great amusement to the natives, 
who watched it from afar and promptly toolv to their heels if one of 
the bucking brutes threatened to approach them. 

Our observations finally promi^ted us to choose the northwesterlv 
route as the shortest, other conditions being a])out equal, or at least 
equall}^ impossible to foresee. To facilitate the crossing of the large 
rivers which Avere known to lie athwart our route to the mountains, a 
boat was sent ahead in cliarge of George Eberhardt and Louis Ander- 
son, both experienced in frontier life and, as the event proved, emi- 
nently reliable men. We decided not to use Indian guides, in spite of 
the advice of the Tj^onok sages, both because of the Indian's igno- 
rance of horses and for the reason that his insatiable appetite for 
white men's stores makes him an undesirable addition to a party when 
the transportation of supplies is the difficult problem. 

The adequate provisioning of a party like ours is the most important 
feature of the preparation. If the allowance of food is insufficient, 
the journey has to be curtailed or risk of starvation encountered. On 
the other hand, if a greater quantity is taken than is necessary, it may 
hamper the transportation facilities and result in failure to the expe- 
dition. A proper variety' of food is also imperative, for on this will 
depend the health and strength of the party. The accumulated expe- 
rience of five years of Alaskan travel enabled us to judge the propor- 
tions to a nicety. Practically nothing but dried foods were chosen; 
the staples — flour, bacon, beans, sugar, and evaporated fruit — were sup- 
plemented by farinaceous foods, cheese, evaporated eggs and potatoes, 
condensed soups, together with tea, coffee, and a few pounds of delica- 
cies, such as macaroni and jelly. Our ration provided for 3 pounds 
of food per man each day, an ample allowance if no canned goods are 
taken. 

The provisions, sufficient to feed seven men for one hundred and five 
days, were packed in 50-pound waterproof bags. As for the rest of 
the equipment, everA^thing Avas chosen with a view to lightness, the 
tents weighing onlv a few pounds and carbines being carried instead 
of rifles. Sleeping bags were substituted for blankets because they 
give a maximum of warmth for a minimum of weight. The entire 
equipment weighed about 3,500 pounds, of which 1,000 pounds were 
sent by boat and the rest distributed among the 20 horses. 

As all our preparations were now completed and the grass was suffi- 
ciently advanced to insure an ample supply of feed for the horses, we 
set out from Tyonok on June 2. 

At the outset our experience was a hard one. The horses were fresh 
and some of them objected seriously to the heavv burdens. Again 
and again they l)ucked their packs off and stampeded the entire herd. 
Our baggage was scattered to the four winds of heaven, and the pieces 



AN EXPLOKATION TO MOUNT McKINLEY. 411 

had to be .souglit for curefulh' in the long grass which covered the 
upper part of the beach; the natives, meanwhile, viewing our discom- 
fiture with delight, as if it were an exhibition prepared for their special 
benefit. 

Beyond the town, where the route followed the beach between the 
water on the one side and the steep gravel bluff's on the other, the 
narrow space gave opportunity to control the fractious horses. (See 
plate III.) 

The pack train was not without a certain picturesqueness. First 
came Fred mounted on the lead horse, and behind him, in single file, 
followed the other horses, their new white pack covers glistening in 
the sun. The other men were on foot scattered along at intervals, 
with George at the close of the procession, leading his small bay mare 
with the cook stove on top of her pack. This stove was in George's 
eyes the most precious possession of the party, and for three months 
he never allowed it to be out of his sight. It finally came to grief 
700 miles inland, when both horse and stove rolled into the river. 

At the mouth of the Beluga River, 20 miles from TA'onok, the boat 
met the party, and a da}^ was spent in crossing. The horses were made 
to swim over at full tide, little relishing the plunge into the cold waters; 
and thev probably would have liked it still less had they known of the 
score or more of icy rivers that would be traversed during the suc- 
ceeding joiirne}^ Camp was pitched on the north l)ank while the boat 
was utilized for a two da3's' excursion up the Sushitna River. 

Leaving the boat at an Indian town at the head of the delta, four of 
us made our way to Mount Sushitna. A steep climb brought us to the 
summit, and the broad lowland of the Sushitna Vallej" lay spread 
before us, the dark greens of its spruce forests contrasting with the 
lighter greens of the open marshes and the bright gleam of small lakes 
or winding water courses. Be3'ond rose a range of highlands, imd 
then, forming the sky-line, snow-covered Alaskan mountains. From 
our vantage point the rugged crest line seemed unbroken, and had we 
not known that it was in fact cleft by passes we might have despaired 
of finding a route through such a forbidding mountain mass. 

As we gazed a mass of clouds hanging over what appeared to be the 
center of the range broke and re\ealed two majestic peaks, Mount 
McKinlc}' and Mount Foraker, glistening in the slanting rays of the 
afternoon sun. Far above the crest line they towered, enormous 
mountains, even at a distance of 120 miles. Four years before, while 
making an exploration down the Tanana with canoes, I had seen the 
same peaks and at about the same distance, but from the opposite 
direction. 

The task before us was to find a route across the swampy lowland, 
traverse the mountains, and, following their northern front, ap})roa('h 
from the inland slope as near tlu; base of this culminating peak of the

continent as conditions and means would permit; we must map the 
country and incidentally explore a route which some time could l)e 
used by that mountaineer to whom should fall the honor of first set- 
ting foot on the summit of Mount McKinley. 

At the Beluga River the course lay inland, and by good fortune an 
Indian trail lightened the labor of the axmen to a great extent; ))ut 
it was designed for use in the fall and winter when the ground was 
frozen, and its many bogs, which then only served to facilitate travel- 
ing, now caused our horses one long struggle to wallow through it 
with their heavy burdens. Almost continuously one or more of the 
animals became mired, and often the entire strength of the seven 
members of the party was required to drag them out. 

A week after leaving tide water, we emerged from the lowlands into 
a belt of foothills covered for the most part with tall grass, inter- 
spersed with symmetrical spruces and open groves of poplar. The 
landscape had a park-like appearance not unlike some of the farming 
regions of the East. (See plate iv.) The man}^ familiar wild flowers 
added to the delusion, and it was hard to realize that we were in one 
of the unexplored parts of the world, for it seemed as if every rise of 
ground must bring us to the sight of a farmhouse, with its fields and 
orchards. '^ 

As we climbed higher we left all timber behind us except the omni- 
present willow and alder thickets. The horses reveled in an abun- 
dance of grass, while the camp larder was improved by the ptarmigan 
which were shot along our line of march. Another glimpse of Mount 
McKinley enabled Reaburn, our topographer, to determine our loca- 
tion accurately. 

The dail}^ routine was now well established. All hands were called 
at 5 in the morning, and while the packers drove in the horses the 
others took down the tents. When the horses had been saddled and 
breakfast had been eaten, we all took a hand in the packing. It was 
no easy task to lift the 200-pound packs to the backs of the horses 
and adjust them. Nearlj^ all of the men were now fairly expert at 
lashing them in place — " throwing the diamond hitch," as it is called. 
(See plate iv.) After two hours of hard work spent in this operation, 
the march began. In a timbered region two or three axmen pre- 
ceded the train, but in the open country this was not necess9.ry. 
Camp was made between 3 and 4, and after an early supper the geolo- 
gist and topographer usually made an excursion to some neighboring 
peak or valley. 

In this foothill region we came in contact with our first bear. Fred, 
while forging ahead of the party in search of a trail, came upon a 
she bear and cub. The old one at once charged. Hemmed in by 
alder thickets, with an ax as his only w^eapon, he faced his assailant 
with what seemed, even to an old hunter like himself, hardl}' a fighting

chance for life. Fortunately, however, the Kodiak grizzly, though 
larger, is not so ferocious as his Rocky Mountain brother, and Fred 
made his escape, though the animal approached within a few feet of 
him. 

The good traveling came to an end all too soon, and we plunged into 
the thick growth of timber covering the floor of the Yentna Valley. 
When, on June 18, we reached the banks of that river, the turbulent, 
silt-bearing waters, coursing through a score of channels, did not 
look inviting, and we had grave doubts whether a crossing could be 
made. It must be attempted, howevei", as it would save a week's 
time. Mounted on two of the stronger horses, from which the saddles 
had been stripped, Fred and I managed to ford some of the streams, 
though the horses barely kept their footing in the rushing waters, 
which reached their shoulders. There still remained several of the 
widest channels. The unwilling animals were urged into the first 
of these, and in a moment were swept off their feet b}^ the muddy 
torrent, which for an instant engulfed both riders and horses and bore 
them downstream at a terrific rate. By an almost instinctive move- 
ment, Ave threw ourselves from the struggling brutes, seized them by 
their manes, and swam alongside, thus at length guiding them back 
to the bank. We dragged ourselves out, both we and the horses 
shivering from our ducking in the icy waters. The plunge was but 
one of many similar incidents of the journey before us, but it was 
more significant, in that it showed the impossibilit}^ of making a cross- 
ing at this point without taking serious risks. 

So, perforce, we headed downstream and spent weary days cutting 
a trail through the dense growth on the river bank; until on the fourth 
day a welcome rifle shot told us that we were near the rendezvous 
with the men and boat. With the aid of these we at last succeeded 
in crossing the river. As it was, the passage occupied an entire da}', 
and was not without its dangers to the horses, who had to be towed 
across behind the boat, in imminent risk of drowning in the 8-mile 
current, which at times carried them under water. (See plate v.) 

After agreeing upon a third rendezvous, the land party continued 
its trail chopping and corduroy building. This was the most disheart- 
ening part of the whole journey. The middays were sultry, and the 
endless chopping, harassed as we were l)y clouds of mosquitoes, was 
almost maddening. With our best eft'orts we could make barelv 3 
miles a day, and though nearly a third of our provisions were con- 
sumed, we had completed hardly an eighth of our 80()-mile journey. 
Day after day we toiled on, fighting mosquitoes, dragging horses out of 
nuid holes, cutting our way through dense growths of alder. Occa- 
sionally we would determine our position ])v compass sights from the 
top of some tall cottonwood, and then we Avould la}' a new course. At 
last, having reason to believe ourselves near the Keechatna, we halted 
for a day to reconnoitcr and rest the tired horses and men. 



414 AN EXPLOEATION TO MOUNT McKINLEY. 

While exploring- the route ahead I missed camp, which was hidden 
in a broad, wooded flat, and spent a part of the night in the rain, 
vainl}^ attempting to snatch a few hours' sleep in spite of the m3^riads 
of mosquitoes, and my supperless plight. When 1 finally reached 
camp, at 6 the next morning, we at once got under way. A day's 
march ))rought us to the banks of the Keechatna, and a signal smoke 
guided us to where the boat and men awaited us. My thirt3'-six hours 
of almost continuous tramping made m}^ small tent seem very attractive. 

The Keechatna was a less turbulent stream than the Yentna, and 
with the aid of the boat a crossing was eflected without difficulty. 

We now parted with Eberhardt and Anderson, who returned to 
T3'onok, taking the last letters we should be able to send out. Thence- 
forth until we reached the Yukon, about three months later, we were 
to be entirel}" cut otf from the rest of the world. 

The outlook was not encouraging, for we had nearh' TOO miles of 
practically' unknown territorv to traverse, and the incessant labor of 
toiling through the swamp, added to the continual annoyance from 
mosquitoes and horseflies, was having a serious effect upon the strength 
of our horses. Night after night we Avould hear the tinkle of the bell 
horse as he led the band of horses, maddened by the insects, back and 
forth. Though we blanketed them and built large fires as smudges, 
they seldom got relief for more than two or three hours of the twenty- 
four. It was terrible to see their sufl'ia-ing and be powerless to help 
them. They would frequently crowd into camp as if to implore us to 
relieve them from their misery. 

The men, too, were becoming worn out by the mosquito pest, which 
harassed them continually during the day, though they found relief 
at night in the mosquito-proof tents. The soft blanket of moss, 
usually saturated with moisture, which nearly ever}" where covers the 
face of the countrj", offers a breeding-ground for myriads of the 
insects. They are ever active, both day and night; on the mountain 
tops, far above timber, as well as in the lowlands. Five years of 
Alaskan travel have convinced me that there is no hardship so diffi- 
cult to bear as this insect pest. I have seen horses, fairl}^ maddened 
by the torment, blindly charge through the forest, oblivious to the 
trees and branches encountered, until they wore themselves out, then, 
in utter hopelessness, drop their heads and patiently endure the suf- 
fering. I have seen strong men, after da3^s and nights of almost 
incessant torment, when they were too weary to offer further resist- 
ance to their relentless foes, weep with vexation. No part of an 
Alaskan traveler's outfit is more important than his mosquito-proof 
headdress and gloves. The former is made to fit closely around the rim 
of his hat and to his shoulders, for the mosquitoes will find the smallest 
opening. Unfortunately, the headdress has only too often to be dis- 
carded. When pushing through the undergrowth, using a surveying 
instnmient, sighting a rifle, or chopping a trail, the traveler is at the

mercy of the mosquitoes, Avliich follow him in clouds. While every 
other hardship of Alaskan travel is often grossly exaggerated, it is 
hardly possible to do this one justice. Men capable of enduring heat 
and cold, hunger and fatigue without murmuring, will become almost 
savage under the torture. However, the story told me bj^ an old 
prospector of the days on "Fortj^mile,"' when he could wave a pint 
cup over his head and catch a quart of mosquitoes, did seem somewhat 
beyond the bounds of probaliility. 

As we could not know but that the part}" might be forced to retreat 
along the same line as the advance, we left an emergency cache of 
provisions at this point — that is, we placed bags of bacon and flour in 
the branches of a tall spruce out of the reach of wolves. There they 
will remain until the}^ deca}', for a cache is sacred to an Indian, and he 
will not molest it even if he be at the point of starvation. 

On the 30th of June we Started up the Keechatna Kiver, taking 
turns as axmen in the dense growth of alder and willow which clothed 
the valley floor. Sometimes our trail lay perilously near the under- 
cut river bank, and again it climbed along the valley wall to avoid 
precipitous cliffs. The river seemed to have a strange fascination for 
some of the horses, and more than once they deliberately jumped in. 
A cr}' for help one da}" brought me to the rear of the pack train on a 
run, and there was Prindle lying full length on a tree trunk which 
overhung the water, clinging desperately to the halter of a horse 
which the rushing current threatened to carry down. The loss would 
have been irretrievable, for his pack contained nearly all the records 
of the journey. A general alarm was sounded, and the united efforts 
of seven availed at last to rescue the animal. 

On another occasion Medicine, one of our most troublesome horses, 
deliberately jumped into the river and became mired in a quicksand 
20 feet from the bank. The horse following, known as "'Grand- 
father/' to whose pack was intrusted the folding boat, plunged in 
after Medicine, as if to the rescue. Both were dragged out, but at no 
small danger of both horses and men being engulfed in the treacher- 
ous quicksand. 

One day the steep mountain wall closed in and forced us to ford the 
river. This was not very wide, but its swift current tumbling over 
huge Ijowlders looked anything but inviting. Climbing on top of a 
pack. I essayed the first attempt, but my horse lost his footing and 
rolled us l)oth over in the icy waters. A second trial proving more 
successful, the other horses followed one by one, with the men lying- 
flat on the tops of the packs. Odell, with characteristic recklessness, 
had chosen the wildest one, which bucked him off' in midstream, giv- 
ing us a bad scare, but he managed to gain his feet and clamber 
ashore. 



416 AN EXPLORATION TO MOUNT McKINLEY. 

After a week of this sort of thing we entered the foothills of the 
range, and the conditions improved. The horses being now thoroughly 
broken in and, in fact, almost devoid of spirit, three men could easily 
manage them while the others explored the adjacent hills. Grass 
was plentiful; and as the mosquitoes became less annoying after the 
timbered region was left behind, most of the horses began to recover 
strength. 

The jaded horses now needed a da3^\s rest, and while the}' enjoyed 
the abundant grass Reaburn and I climbed a neighboring mountain. 
We found that we were well within a rugged range whose jagged 
peaks arose on every hand and whose higher valley's were filled with 
glacial ice. There were still no indications of the pass we sought, so 
we again took up our march. (See plate v.) 

On July 13 a convenient moose walked into camp, and a shot from 
Fred's carl)ine gave us a welcome supply of fresh meat. Poor Wild 
Bill, who had been playing the part of an invalid for several days, 
found himself under a load of 100 pounds, much to his disgust. 

Fred, Prindle, and 1 now set out to explore the mountains ahead, 
each taking a different direction. When we met again in camp after 
a twenty-four hours' absence, it was Fred who reported discovery of 
the pass so essential to our further progress. 

It was the middle of July when we threaded the narrow gap which 
led us from waters flowing into the Pacific Ocean to those tributary 
to Bering Sea. The fair weather we had encountered almost from the 
beginning now gave place to storms, naturall}^ suggesting the name 
"Kainy Pass'' for the newh' discovered gap. (See plate vi.) We 
were now in high spirits, for we all felt that whatever the summer 
might bring forth, we had at least located a route through this high 
mountain barrier. 

With this thought to encourage us we hastened to press on. Choos- 
ing as guide a stream which headed on the north side of the divide, 
we entered a beautiful mountain vallev, whose steep slopes, clothed in 
dark green spruce, ended above in abrupt clifi^s. Here Fred's ever- 
ready carbine brought us our first mountain sheep. Farther on the 
valley opened up into a broader one across whose level floor a mighty 
river meandered with great, sweeping bends, and we recognized the 
Kuskokwim, the second river of Alaska in size, which poured its 
muddy waters into the Bering Sea a tliousand miles away. Here we 
came upon the trail of a previous exploring expedition and hailed the 
half -obliterated ax marks with a sense of companionship, several years 
old though they were. 

While the pack train cut its wav along the river bank, I climbed a 
peak which proved to be a part of the valley wall. From this point 
I could see the broad valley of the Kuskokwim stretching to the north, 
opening out 30 miles below to a broad lowland whose limits were lost 
in the distant haze. South of me rose the snowy peaks of the range 



AlSr EXPLORATION TO MOUNT McKINLEY. 417 

we had traversed, sweeping- around to the northeast in an apparently 
unbroken crest line, without a sug-gestion of Rain}- Pass, Far to the 
southwest distant snow peaks belonging to some unknown range com- 
pleted the picture. 

On my way down 1 kept along the ridge until 1 caught the glimmer 
of white tents in the valley 5,000 feet below me, and then, noting the 
course by my compass, I plunged down the mountain side without 
further consideration. A clifi' proved a temporary obstacle, then 
another, and finally a succession of steep slopes which were merely 
intervals between small cliffs. Once started it was impossible to turn 
back; one minute I was sliding with a mass of loose talus, another cau- 
tiously clambering down a cleft in a precipice, bracing myself against 
either wall to maintain my scant foothold. Once a huge bowlder, 
which I had loosened in m}' descent, whizzed past and crashed into 
the timber a thousand feet below. It Avas with a deep sense of relief 
that I reached the timber line and registered a silent vow never to 
attempt anything so foolhard}' again. 

By the last week in Juh^ Ave reached the lowland which stretches 
northwestward from the inland front of the Alaskan Range. Our 
route now left the river, turning to the northwest. As we slowl}- cut 
our way through the dense timber of the lower slopes of the valley 
another horse gave out, and his load was distributed among the others. 
Poor brute! Only .six weeks before he had been tearing up the beach 
at Tyonok, scattering his pack to rig-ht and left to the terror of the 
Siwash dogs. 

Coming shortly after into an open spruce forest, we were startled 
by the discovery of a blazed trail, which was plainly not the work of 
natives. No one accustomed to the frontier can ever mistake the scars 
of an Alaskan Indian's ax, for he has never learned to luake a clean, 
sharp cut. No; this chopping- had been done by white men, in win- 
ter, several years before. We followed the trail for some miles until 
it turned off out of our course. Who were these lonely travelers 
of this wild region? Whence had they come and whither did they go? 
These are questions that may never be answered. That they belonged 
to that class of Alaskan prospectors who have traversed the territory 
from the almost tropical jungles of its southern coast to the barren 
grounds which skirt the frozen sea on the north seems not unlikely. 
Often these pioneers make journeys that would put to shame tlie 
Avidely advertised explorations of nianj' a well-equipped govermnent 
expedition. Were the results of their efforts commensurate with the 
toil, danger, and suffering involved, geographical science would be 
much enriched thereby. Unfortunately their ideas of Avhere they 
have been are often almost as vague as of Avhere they are going. 
Many a life has been lost on these hazardous journeys, and only too 
often are bleaching bones the sole record of unproclaimed and unre- 
warded heroism. These adveiitunu-s have no hioh ideals, often no

thought be3'ond tlie desire of lindhig gold; but in the hi.st three decades 
they have been carrying ci^'ilization northward and converted an 
unknown hind into a populated territory which is now yielding millions 
of gold. 

From the forest we now entei-ed a belt of foothills, which formed 
a northern spur of the main range, and once more ol)tained a clear 
view of Mount McKinle}', still almost as far distant as when we first 
saw it from Mount Sushitna six weeks before. This Avas no cause for 
depression, however, for then we were separated from our goal by an 
apparently impenetrable swamp and a great, snow-covered range, 
whereas now there seemed no serious obstacles to our achieving our 
purpose. 

Among these foothills, averaging a height of 3,000 or 4.000 feet, 
dwelt large luimbers of mountain sheep, their pure white color, which 
in this region remains unchanged throughout the year, making them 
conspicuous ol)jects on the l)are rocks or moss-covei'ed slopes. In the 
course of one morning's roaming over the hills I counted more than 
100 of these mountain dwellers. In fact, the abundance of sheep, 
bear, moose, and caribou found along the noj'th slope of the Alaskan 
Range rank it as one of the finest hunting grounds in North America. 

Our descent from the foothills ])rought us to a gravel-floored plateau 
which abutted directly upon the l)ase of the range. Its smooth, moss- 
covered surface afl'orded such excellent footing and so few obstacles 
to progress that for days we hardly varied our direction a degree, 
heading straight for Mount McKinley. That mountain and its twin 
peak. Mount Foraker. now oidy 50 miles away, seemed to us to rise 
almost sheer from the gravel plain. We passed man}- large glaciers 
"which de})ouched from the mountain valleys upon the plateau and dis- 
charged roaring, turl)ulent, bowlder-filled rivers, which were our most 
serious impediment. 

The other members of the party seemed to have no dread of these 
dangerous crossings, but for my part, I crossed every one we sighted 
a dozen times before we reached it. Late in the day, after the glaciers 
had felt the full influence of the sun's rays, the streams would often 
be so high as to be practically impassable, but morning would generally 
And the water fallen 1 or 2 feet. The large rivers were always 
reconnoitered on a horse stripped to the halter; then, if a crossing 
proved feasible, each man would mount on the ])ack of his favorite 
horse and essay the perilous passage, guiding the unmanageable steed 
as best he could. The feat was ever exciting, with the animal plunging 
shoulder high in the muddy, surging water, swaying from side to side, 
and occasionally slipping on some hidden bowlder. More than once 
a horse was carried ofl' his feet, and sometimes rolled quite over. Nor 
was the ludicrous aspect entirely wanting, for often when the farther 
bank was reached the horses would make a sudden leap for it and a 



AlSr EXPLOKATION TO MOUNT McKINLEY. 419 

careless rider would be unceremoniously dumped over the animal's 
tail into the glacial water. 

Since leaving- the pass we had subsisted largely upon moose and 
mountain sheep. Not a day was spent in hunting, but when the supply 
of meat ran low an animal was shot near camp or on the march. Not 
only was game plentiful, but so little did it know of man that it 
regarded us rather with curiosity than mistrust. During our journey 
across the piedmont plateau for days and weeks together we were 
hardl}" out of sight of caribou. They had a curious wa}' of approach- 
ing, either individualh" or in bands, to within .50 yards of the moving- 
train, then galloping away to a distance and returning l>y a series of 
large circles. Sometimes a lone buck would encircle our camp for 
hours at a time, one minute standing erect gazing at us with rapt 
attention, another flj'ing across the smooth sod at a breakneck pace, 
onl}^ to approach again from a different direction. Their curiosity 
was apparently never satisfied, their wonder ever increasing at the 
unfamiliar sight of the pack train or tents. Even the sharp crack of 
the rifle did not frighten them. There was no sport in hunting such 
innocenth" tame creatures, and we never molested them except when 
we needed meat. 

These were the happiest days of the summer. Cheered ])y the 
thought that every day's march was bringing us visibly nearer to our 
goal, we lent ourselves readily to the influence of the clear, invigorating 
air and the inspiration of that majestic peak ever looming ])efore us, 
the highest mountain of North America, whicli we were to be the first 
to explore. 

Yet our task was never an easy one; for the very fact that the pack 
train was enabled to cover longer distances rendered it all the harder 
to overtake it after the side excursions which were necessary to fulfill 
the purpose of the expedition, and it was often dusk of the long arctic 
day before the geologists and topographer reached camp. 

George alone of the partv was low-spirited. His great ambition in 
life — to cook — had too narrow a scope in this land above the limit of 
spruce trees, where there were only stunted willow and alder for fuel. 
His spirits registered inversely to the ])ar()meter, rising as we went 
down toward tinilx-r, falling as we clinil.'ed above it. Two long jour- 
neys in the barren grounds of the north h-ul not freed him from the 
traditions of the Lake Superior woodsman, and he could never regard 
anything as fuel that did not require splitting with an ax. Notwith- 
standing, he cooked woiuUn-ful meals, as the following menu copied

a meal that no city cook need be ashamed of, yet it was prepared in 
one of the most inaccessible points on the continent, with onh- green 
willow as fuel. George was ever faithful to his task, read}^ at any 
time of night or day with a hot meal for those who returned late. 

Our camp of August 1 was pitched in a grove of cottonwoods near 
the foot of a glacier which flowed down from the neve fields of Mount 
Foraker. This we called the ''Herron Glacier," in honor of Capt. 
Joseph S. Herron, our predecessor in the exploration of the upper 
Kuskokwim Basin. A short scramble through the underbrush brought 
me to the front of the moraine, which stretched like a cyclopean 
wall across the valley. Climbing to the top, 1 surveyed the mass 
spread out before me, Aery like the preliminary dumping ground 
of a railway excavation. It was a striking scene and an unusual one, 
for a newly formed moraine is the exception in land forms. Nature 
in her sculpturing delights in rounded and symmetrical outlines, and 
it is only Avhen the forces of erosion have not had time to do their 
molding that such a crude, unfinished surface is exposed to view. It 
is, so to speak, the raw material which streams and rains will carve 
ijito beautifully rounded topography, and then vegetation, nature's 
decorative artist, will clothe with greens of various hues. 

Two days later we made our nearest camp to Mount McKinley in a 
broad, shallow valley incised in the piedmont plateau and drained by a 
stream which found its source in the ice- clad slopes of the high moun- 
tain. We had reached the base of the peak, and a part of our mission 
was accomplished, with a margin of six weeks left for its completion. 
This bade us make haste, for Ave must still traverse some 400 miles of 
unexplored region before we could hope to reach even the outposts of 
civilization. Notwithstanding all of this, we decided to allow our- 
selves one day's delay, so that Ave might actually set foot on the slopes 
of the mountain. The ascent of Mount McKinley had never been part 
of our plan, for our mission was exploration and surve3ang, not 
mountaineering, but it now seemed A'ery hard to us that AA:e had neither 
time nor equipment to attempt the mastery of this highest peak of the 
continent. 

The next morning dawned clear and lu'ight. Climbing the ])luff 
above our camp, I overlooked the upper part of the vallej', spread 
before me like a broad amphitheater, its sides formed by the slopes of 
the mountain and its spurs. Here and there glistened in the sun the 
white surfa-ces of glaciers which found their way down from the peaks 
aboA'e. The great mountain rose 17,000 feet above our camp, appar- 
ently almost sheer from the fiat A\alley floor. (See plate vii.) Its 
dome-shaped summit and upper slopes were white with snoAv, relieved 
here and there by black areas which marked cliffs too steep for the 
snoAV to lie upon. 

A two hours' walk across the valley, through several deep glacial 
streams, brought me to the A^ery ])ase of the mountain. As I approached 




o

AN EXPLORATION TO MOUNT McKINLEY. 421 

the top was soon lost to view; the slopes were steep, and i had to 
scramble as best I could. (See plate i.) Soon all vegetation was 
left behind me, and my way zigzagged across smooth, bare rocks and 
talus slopes of broken fragments. My objective point was a shoulder 
of the mountain about 10,000 feet high, but at 3 in the afternoon 1 
found mj" route blocked by a smooth expanse of ice. With the aid 
of my geologic pick I managed to cut steps in the slipperj^ surface, 
and thus climbed 100 feet higher; then the angle of slope became 
steeper; and as the ridge on which the glacier lay fell off at the sides 
in sheer cliffs, a slip would have been fatal. (See plate viii.) Con- 
vinced at length that it would be utterly foolhardy, alone as I was, to 
attempt to reach the shoulder for which I was headed, at 7,500 feet I 
turned and cautiously retraced ni}^ steps, finding the descent to bare 
ground more perilous than the ascent. 

I had now consumed all the time that could be spared to explore 
this mountain, which had been reached at the expense of so much prep- 
aration and hard toil, but at least I must leave a record to mark our 
highest point. On a prominent cliff near the base of the glacier which 
had turned me back I built a cairn, in which I buried a cartridge shell 
from my pistol, containing a brief account of the journej^, together 
with a roster of the party. 

By this time I was forcibly reminded of the fact that I had forgot- 
ten to eat my lunch. As I sat resting from my labors I survej'ed a 
striking scene. Around me were bare rock, ice, and snow ; not a sign 
of life, the silence broken now and then by the roar of an avalanche 
loosened by the midday sun, tumbling like a waterfall over some cliff 
to find a resting place thousands of feet below. I gazed along the 
precipitous slopes of the mountain and tried to realize again its great 
altitude, with a thrill of satisfaction at being the first man to approach 
the summit, which was only 9 miles from where I smoked my pipe. 
No white man had ever before reached the base, and I was far beyond 
where the moccasined foot of the roving- Indian had never trod. The 
Alaskan native seldom goes beyond the limit of smooth walking and 
has a superstitious horror of even approaching glacial ice. 

Returning to camp I fomid Reaburn had worked all da}' over his 
plane-table board sketching the topography of the mountain, which- 
was plainly visible from his station. His map will luidoubtedly serve 
as a guide to him who first reaches the summit. Prindle had spent 
the day making an excursion into the mountains to the south of my 
route, and had come back burdened with geological and botanical 
specimens; Von and Fred had been shoeing some of the horses, while 
George had cooked a meal worthy of the occasion. 

Our immediate goal was the Tanana River. Hoping to reach this 
by the valley of one of its tributaries, the Cantwell, which we believed 
to head in the northern part of the Alaskan Range, we continued our 



422 AN EXPLORATION TO MOUNT McKINLEY. 

course northeastward along the front of the range. The character of 
the country remained unchanged for 100 miles, and we pushed for- 
ward as rapidly as our surveys and investigations would permit, the 
long moves of the party often making it difficult for Reaburn and me 
to reach camp before dark. More than once we were forced to make 
a lonely Invouac under some spruce tree until the return of daylight 
enabled us to find camp. These irregularities annoj^ed George, who 
liked to see each man get a full meal three times a dsij. He regarded 
it as a kind of bad habit which we had fallen into, and when Reaburn 
was gone from camp for two nights in succession remarked, "When 
a man once takes to the spruce vou can't do nothing with him.'' 

On one occasion, after an all-day tramp, I sighted camp from a 
mountain top 6 miles away, its location marked b}^ a cloud of smoke, 
our usual method of signaling. Crossing valleys, ridges, and low- 
lands, from ever}'^ high point I could see the column of smoke. Dark- 
ness finalh' overtook me 2 miles from camp, but 1 held my course by 
sighting a star and thus made my way, breaking a passage through 
the thick maze of alder, stumbling over fallen logs, wading streams, 
and even plunging- through a river whose opposite bank I could dis- 
cern only in dim outline. Suddenly from the top of a ridge 1 saw a 
pillar of fire shoot toward the sky. The boys had heard my pistol 
shot and were putting fire into spruce trees. Thus guided l\y the 
cloud of smoke during the day and the pillar of fire l)y night, I finally 
stumbled into camp, weary, with clothing torn, and face and hands 
scratched by the underbrush encountered in the darkness. 

About the middle of August we turned to the south again into the 
mountains and shortly reached the forks of the Cantwell, where two 
former exploring expeditions had been forced to turn back. (See 
plate IX.) On the following day we made what proved to be our 
last difficult crossing. When I saw the waters surging around the 
shoulders of the big horse on which I led the way I had serious fears 
for the smaller animals. All crossed in safety, except that Von, who 
had chosen a wild mount, was tossed off in shallow water, much to his 
disgust and the amusement of the others. 

On its way to the Tanana the Cantwell cuts a deep canyon through 
a minor range which lies athwart its course. Finding this canyon 
apparently impassable for horses we began to fear that we had 
encountered a check; fortunately, however, a short search was 
rewarded by the discovery of a pass. The numerous old camps and 
caches showed us that this route had long been in use by the Indians, 
but we were the first to essa}" it with horses. 

We came out upon the northern side of the range into the narrow 
valle}^ of a stream, and from the ridge above I obtained a view over 
the broad lowland beyond. Far across the expanse of spruce timber 
and open swamp I could see the bright ri])))oii of water which revealed

AN^ EXPLORATION TO MOUNT McKINLEY. 423 

the position of the Tanana. Meanwhile the pack train had continued 
down the valle}^ below me into a rock-walled canyon, through which 
the stream tumbled over huge bowlders. From my point of vantage 
1 could see through the glasses the horses climbing up the valley slopes 
one by one, like flies crawling up a wall. It seemed impossible that 
the}" could extricate themselves, but twenty years of mountaineering 
in Montana had taught Fred to take horses where no other man could. 
That night we camped on the Tanana side of the range and our moun- 
tain climbing was over. 

Two daj's later the signals made to bring me to camp did not have 
that result, for 1 was miles away seeking shelter from the driving rain 
under a spruce tree. The rifle shots did, however, attract a l)and of 
Indians and a white prospector. The former were out on a hunting- 
trip from their village on the Tanana. The white man, traveling- 
alone, except for tw^o large dogs which he had burdened with packs, 
was on one of those wild-goose chases after gold which are so common 
in Alaska. We hailed these visitors with J03", for since leaving tide- 
water three months before we had seen no human beings, and only 
once had we indication of their existence, by a smoke sighted miles 
away across the flats of the upper Kuskokwim. 

The Indians were hungry, as is usually the case with Alaska natives, 
and had to be regaled. They rewarded our hospitality by information 
of a trail across the swampy lowland to their village on the Tanana. 
This was of material assistance to us, for l)y its aid we were enabled 
to cover the ground rapidly, and three da3's later emerged from the 
spruce-clothed flats on the banks of the Tanana at the native settle- 
ment called Tortella. (See plate ix.) 

I reached the village some distance ahead of the party. Great was 
the astonishment of the natives at my sudden appearance from the 
forest. White men had visited them before, but always b}- water, in 
large parties and with abundant supplies. Who was the lone stranger 
whose baggage consisted solely of his revolver, field glasses, and ham- 
mer, and where did he come from ? One boy knew some English, and, 
drawing a map in the sand by way of illustration, I explained my route, 
greath" to their bewilderment. One old man had made the trip to 
Cook Inlet years ago, but he had gone by the direct route from the 
head of the Cant well, and they knew nothing of the roundabout route 
we had followed. 

The village consisted of a score of low structures built of spruce logs,

ing an aspect that was ludicrous rather than picturesque. The old

chief o-ravel}' stalked around, peering out from under the visor of a 
policemairs hehnet, which was so large for him that is rested on his 
ears. 

When the horses ari-ived their delight and somewhat childish terror 
were laughable. Losing no time, we bargained with the Indians for 
a boat and began the crossing. After one horse had been towed over, 
the rest were driven in and swam across to join their mate. Thus by 
nightfall we were camped on the north l)ank. 

It was now the 1st of September and we were still 100 miles or 
more from our goal on the Yukon. The Indians implored us not to 
attempt to make the journe}' by land, declaring the country impassa- 
ble for horses. As my interpreter stated the case, "Plenty water; 
plenty stick [thick timber]. No good! No good!" But we were not 
to be deterred from completing the exploration we had planned, though 
we could have shot the horses and easily reached the Yukon b}^ boat. 
The next morning a delegation of our friends visited our camp to give 
us a final warning: "No good! No good! By and by come back. 
Maybe so." 

Here we abandoned all except the most necessary part of our outfit, 
for the early frost was killing the grass and the stock was beginning 
to show the effects of insuflficient nourishment. The light packs were 
quickly adjusted, and without cutting a trail, to the astonishment of 
the Indians, we let the horses crash their way through the underbrush. 
For two days we followed a ridge leading to the north along the east- 
ern edge of a broad timbered flat dotted with innumerable lakes and 
crossed by many sluggish water courses. This it was that the Indians 
had said was impassable. Finding that the route around it threatened 
to protract our journey 100 miles or more, we boldly headed straight 
across it. 

It was a route beset with difiiculties. Now we were chopping our 
way through a dense tangle of small growth; now building corduroy 
over swamps and streams; now rafting rivers too wide to bridge. All 
worked with energy born of the consciousness that our provisions were 
getting low and it was only a matter of days before our horses would 
begin to play out. In one week we succeeded in rafting five rivers 
and built bridges over six more. More than once our temporary 
bridge gave way, and then we had the heartrending toil of dragging 
the poor, weak animals up on the bank. The traveling was not all of 
this character, for occasionally there would be a stretch of several 
miles where we would thread our way through open forests of white 
birches. The glistening white trunks and yellow autumnal foliage 
presented a gayety of color which was in strong contrast to the somber 
spruce forest we had been traversing for so man}^ miles. The small 
lakes were covered with wild fowl congregating for their southward 
migration. 



AN EXPLORATION TO MOUNT McKINLEY. 425 

We finally left the lowland and entered an upland region, where we 
kept for the most part above timber. The poor horses, even under 
the lightened loads, iDegan to fail. Overtaking the pack train one day, 
1 found Prindle and George laboring with Rabbit, who refused to take 
another step. Both were very fond of the little mare — always a pet 
with the party^ — and wanted to save her life. We Avorked with her a 
while, but it was no use — her heart was broken; and drawing nu' 
revolver, 1 sent a })ullet through the brain of the poor beast who had 
served us so well. After this a horse was shot nearly every day. 

Leaving the party one morning, I took a long side trip, expecting 
to pick up their trail and follow it into ctimp that night, but they had 
misunderstood my directions, and at midnight 1 again sought shelter 
from the rain under a large spruce. I roasted a ptarmigan which 1 
had shot, and this, together with a few hard-tack, constituted my sup- 
per and breakfast. The next day 1 was forced to go back to the old 
camp to pick up the trail. A dead horse marked the spot, and a 
search through his pack revealing a bag of rice, I cooked a meal of 
this with the aid of an abandoned butter can and started on the trail. 
On the mountain side lay another dead horse with some bacon left in 
his pack, which I took for an emergenc3^ Nightfall found me not yet 
in camp, and this time I dined and breakfasted on bacon and another 
ptarmigan which had fallen to my revolver. Late in the afternoon I 
reached camp, after an absence of two nights and nearly three days, 
to find Reaburn very anxious and scouts out in various directions. 
This camp was on a trail which led from the then newly discovered 
gold diggings known as Glenn Creek to Rampart, on the Yukon. 

The next morning we packed for the last time, abandoning most of 
the outfit and feeding the last of our flour to the horses to strengthen 
them for the final march. I took a route across the hills and at night- 
fall joined the party camped in the town of Rampart. Many were the 
questions asked us, but few of the questioners, I think, really believed 
that we had made the journey from Cook Lilet. 

Thus ended the longest cross-countr}^ exploration ever attempted 
in Alaska. Our plans had been carried out from start to finish; we 
had traversed 800 miles of the roughest part of Alaska in one hundred 
and five da\'S. While cooking our breakfast next morning, a river 
steamer whistled, the last to make the journey down the Yukon before 
it was locked in the winter ice. Leaving our breakfast cooking on 
the fire, we hastily gathered up our more precious belongings, chiefly 
notes and specimens, and scrambled on board. The boat swung out in 
midstream, and with a farewell salute to the crowd of Indians and 
prospectors on the bank we rapidly steamed away, once more headed 
for civilization and home.

NORTH POLAR EXPLORATION: FIELD WORK OF THE 
PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902/' 



By Comnmiuler K. E. T'eahy, U. S Xavy. 



INTRODUCTION. 



. In January, 1897, 1 promulgated before the American Geographical 
Society of New York City my plan for an extended scheme of arctic 
exploration, having for its main purpose the attainment of the North 
Pole. During the spring of 1897 Morris K. Jesup, now president of 
the Peary Arctic Club, became interested in the matter and suggested 
the idea of this club. His example was followed b}^ other prominent 
men, and late in Maj^, through the persistent personal efforts of Charles 
A. Moore, backed by letters from these and other influential men, five 
years' leave of absence was granted me by the Navv Department to 
enable me to cany out my plans. 

It being too late that season to get the main expedition under way, 
the summer of 1897 was devoted to a preliminary trip to the Whale 
Sound region to acquaint the Eskimos with 1113^ plan for the coming- 
year and in setting them to work laying in a stock of skins and meat. 
These objects were successfulh^ accomplished, and, in addition, the 
great "Ahnighito" meteorite of Melville Bay, the largest known mete- 
orite in the world, was brought home. In December, 1897, while in 
London, the schooner yacht W/ndward, Avhich had been used in his 
Franz Josef Land expedition, was tendered to me by Alfred Harms- 
worth, who offered to have her re-engined and delivered to me in New 
Y^ork. This generous offer I acce'pted. In the spring of 1898 the 
Peary Arctic Club was organized, Morris K. Jesup, Henry W. Can- 
non. H. L. Bridgman, all personal friends of mine, forming the nucleus 
about which the rest assembled. In May the Windward arrived, but to 
my extreme regret and disappointment she still retained her antiquated 
and puny engine (the machinists' strike in England prevented the 
installation of new ones), and was practically nothing but a sailing craft. 
The lateness of the season was such that nothing could be done but

make the most of the Windward as she was. But her extreme slow- 
ness (3^ knots under favorable circumstances) and the introduction of 
a disturbing factor, in the appropriation by another of m}- plan and 
field of work, necessitated the charter of an auxiliary ship if I did not 
wish to be distanced in my own domain. The Windward sailed from 
New York on the 4th of July, 1898, and on the 7th I went on board 
the Ilojye at Sydney, Cape Breton, and sailed just as the first two-line 
cablegram came of the battle of Santiago. 

1898-99. 

Pushing rapidly northward and omitting the usual calls at the Dan- 
ish Greenland ports, Cape York was reached after a voyage uneventful 
except for a nip in the ice of Melville Bay which lifted the Hope 
l)odily and for a few hours seemed to contain possibilities of trouble. 
The work of hunting walrus and assembling my party of natives was 
connnenced at once; the Windward soon joined us, after which the 
hunting was prosecuted b}'' both ships until the final rendezvous at 
Etah, from whence both ships steamed out on August 13, the Wind- 
vMrd to continue northward, the Hope bound for home. The Wind- 
vKird was four hours forcing her way through a narrow barrier of 
heav}" ice across the mouth of Foulke Fjord. Here the Hope left us, 
straightening away southward toward Cape Alexander, and the Wind- 
?/w;Tnieaded for Cape Hawkes, showing distinctly beyond Cape Sabine. 
At 4 a. m. Sunda}^ we encountered scattered ice ofi' Cape Albert. 
About noon we were caught in the ice near Victoria, Head, and drifted 
))ack several miles. Finally we got round Victoria Head into Princess 
Marie Bay at 6 p. m. The bay was tilled with the season's ice, not yet 
l»roken out, while Kane Basin was crowded with the heavy, moving- 
polar pack. Between the two, extended northward across the mouth 
of the bay, was a series of small pools and threads of water, opening 
and closing with the movements of the tide. At 11.30 p. m. on the 
18th the WindirardXynA worried her way across the ba}' to a little patch 
of open water close under Cape D'Urville. Here further progress 
was stopped b}^ a large floe, several miles across, one end resting against 
the shore and the other extending out into the heavv ice. While cross- 
ing the bay the more important stores had been stowed on the deck 
in readiness to be thrown out upon the ice in the event of a nip. 
Pending the turning of the tide, when I hoped the big floe would 
move and let us proceed, I landed at Cape D'Urville, deposited a 
small cache of supplies, and climbed the bluffs to look at the conditions 
northward. 

August 21. — I went on a reconnoissance along the ice foot to the head 
of Allman Bay and into the valley beyond. The night of the 21st 
young ice formed which did not melt again. On the 28th I attempted 
to sledge over the sea ice to Norman Lockyer Island, but found too 



FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 429 

many weak places, and fell back on the ice foot. The night of the 
!29th the temperatui'e fell to 13' F., and on the 31st the new ice was 
4i inches thick. On this day 1 went to Cape Hawkes and climbed to 
its summit, whence 1 could see lakes out in Kane Basin, but between 
them and the Wlmhcard the ice was closely packed — a discouraging 
outlook. Only a strong and continued westerly wind would give me 
any chance. The uncertainty^ of these two weeks was very annojdng 
to me. Had I been sure that we could not get away from here I could 
have been making an inland trip. As it was I could not leave the 
ship for fear an opportunity to advance would occur in my absence. 

Septc'inher 2. — I started on a sledge trip up Princess Marie Bay. 
At Cape Harrison the strong tidal current kept the ice broken, so I 
could not round it, and the ice foot was impracticable for sledges. I 
went on foot to the entrance of Copes Bay, surve3nng the shore to 
that point, then returned to the ship after four daj's' absence. During 
this trip I obtained the English record from the cairn on the summit 
of Norman Lockyer Island, deposited there twent3^-two years ago. 
This record was as fresh as when left. 

September 6. — 1 left the ship to reconnoiter Dobbin Bay, the head 
of which is uncharted, returning three days later. During this trip 
the tirst real snowstorm of the season occurred, 5i inches falling. 

September 12. — One-third of my provisions, an ample 3"ear's suppl}- 
for the entire party, was landed at Cape DT^rville, my Eskimos sledg- 
ing loads of 700 to 1,000 pounds over the young ice. The night of 
the 13th the temperature dropped to — 10- F., and all hope of farther 
advance was at an end. 

September 15. — The boiler was V)lown oti' and preparations for win- 
ter commenced. 

On the 17th I broached my plans for the winter campaign as 
follows : 

The autumn work was simple enough and outlined itself. It com- 
prised two items— the securing of a winter's suppW of fresh meat for 
the party and the survey of the Buchanan Strait-Hayes Sound-Princess 
Marie Ba}' region. In spite of the peculiarh" desolate character of 
that part of the Grinnell Land coast immediately about the Windivard., 
and the apparent utter absence of animal life, I felt confident of 
accomplishing the former. Various reconnoissances thus far on the 
north shore of Princess Marie Ba}' had given me little encouragement, 
but I knew that the Eskimos had killed one or two musk oxen in 
3^ears past on Bache Island, and that region looked favorable for them. 
As regards the surve3', a presentiment that I must get at that at the 
earliest possible moment had already led me to make attempts to reach 
the head of Princess Marie Bay. 

As to the spring campaign, I could not be reconciled to the idea of 
losing a 3'ear from the main work of the expedition, and proposed to 



430 FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 

utilize the winter moons in pushing- supplies to Fort Cong-er. then 
move my party to that station early in Februar3% and on the return of 
the sun start from there as a base, and make my attempt on the .Pole 
via Cape Hecla. I might succeed in spite of the low latitude of my 
starting- point, and in any event could be back to the ship before the 
ice broke up, with thorough knowledge of the coast and conditions 
north of me. 

September 18. — I left the ship with two sledges and my two best 
P^skimos, with provisions for twelve days, for a reconnoissance of 
Princess Marie Bay. 

September W. — I reached the head of a small fjord running- south- 
west from neai- the head of Princess Marie Bay, and found a narrow^ 
neck of land about 3 miles wide separating- it from a branch of 
Buchanan Strait. Bache Island of the chart is, therefore, a pen- 
insula, and not an island. From a commanding- peak in the neigh- 
borhood 1 could see that both arms of Buchanan Strait ended about 
south of my position; that the "strait" is in reality a bay, and that 
Hayes Sound does not exist. On the I21st and 22d 1 penetrated the 
arms of Princess Marie Bay, designated as Sawver and Woodward 
bays on the charts, and demonstrated them to be entirely closed. 

8eptemher23. — While entering a little big-ht about midway of the 
north shore of Bache Peninsula, 1 came upon two bears. These my 
dog- chased ashore, and held at bay until I could come up and kill 
them. 

Septeinh</r25. — I crossed Bache Peninsula on foot with my two men, 
from Bear Camp to the intersection of the northern and southern 
arms of Buchanan Bay. Here we found numerous walrus, and could 
command the southern arm of the large g-lacier at its head. Compara- 
tively recent musk-ox tracks conyinced me of the presence of musk 
ox on the peninsula. The next day I returned to the Windtvai'd to 
retit and start for Buchanan Bay via Victoria Head and Cape Albert, 
in the quest of walrus and musk oxen. Henson, in a reconnoissance 
northward during- my absence, had been unable to get more than a few 
miles be3'ond Cape Louis Napoleon, sea ice and ice foot being alike 
inipracticaV)le. A day or two after my return I started him oft' again 
to try it. 

Septe)iiher SO. — 1 started for Buchanan Bay. Between Victoria 
Head and Cape Albert found f re^h tracks of a herd of musk oxen and 
follow^ed them until obliterated by the wind. Reached the walrus 
grounds in Buchanan Bay late on October 4, and the next da}^ secured 
a walrus, and the remainder of my party arrived. The following day 
everyone was out after musk oxen, but, finding it very fogg}^ on the 
uplands of the peninsula, I returned to camp and went up to Buchanan 
Ba}' in search of bears, the tracks of which we had seen. Returning 
to camp, I found that one of m^^ hunters had killed a bull nuisk ox.

FIELD WORK OF THE PEAKY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 431 

On the 7th of October I sent two men to bring out the meat and 
skin, while I went up Buchanan Bay again. Returning to camp, I 
found it deserted. A little later some of my party returned, reporting 
a herd of 15 musk oxen killed. The next two days were consumed in 
cutting up the animals, stacking the meat, and getting the skins and 
some of the meat out to camp. The latter had to be dragged to the 
top of the bluffs and thrown over. 

October 10. — We started for the ship, which was reached late on the 
12th. The ice in Buchanan Bay was very rough, and a snowstorm on 
the 11th made going very heavy. Five days later, October IT, 1 
went with two men to locate a direct trail for getting the meat out to 
the north side of the peninsula, but found the country impracticable, 
and returned to the ship on the 21st. The sun left on the 20th. 

The following week was devoted to the work of preparation for the 
winter. A reconnoissance of Franklin Pierce Ba}^ developed nothing 
but hare tracks, but Henson came in from Copes Bay with a big bear, 
killed near the head of the bay. This marked the end of the fall cam- 
paign, with our winter's fresh meat supply assured, and the Bache 
"Island "-Buchanan "Strait"-" Hayes Sound" question settled. 

The next step was the inauguration of the teaming work, which was 
to occupy us through the winter. I alread}^ had ni}^ pemmican and some 
miscellaneous supplies at Cape Louis Napoleon, and two sledge loads of 
provisions at Cape Fraser. The rapidly disappearing daylight being 
now too limited for effective traveling, I was obliged to wait the 
appearance of the next moon before starting for a personal reconnois- 
sance of the coast northward. On the 29th I left the ship with Henson 
and one Eskimo. The soft snow of the last two storms compelled me 
to break a road for the sledges with my snowshoes across Allman Bay 
and along many portions of the ice foot, but in spite of this delay we 
camped at Cape Louis Napoleon after a long march. 

The next day we reached Cape Fraser, having been impeded b}' the 
tide rising over the ice foot, and camped at Henson's farthest, at the 
beginning of what seemed an impracticable ice foot. It was the only 
possible way of advance, however, as the still moving pack in the 
channel was entirel}' impassable. The following day 1 made a recon- 
noissance on foot as far as Scoresby Bay, and though the ice foot was 
then entirel}'^ impracticable for sledges, I was convinced that a good 
deal of earnest work with picks and shovels, assisted b}' the leveling 
effects of the next spring tides, would enable me to get loaded sledges 
over it during the next moon. From Cape Norton Shaw I could see 
that by making a detour into Scores))}' Ba}' the heavy pack could be 
avoided in crossing. This stretch of ice foot from Cape Fraser to 
Cape Norton Shaw is extremely Alpine in character, being an almost 
continuous succession of huge blocks and masses of bergs and old floes, 



432 FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 

forced bodily out of the water and up onto the rocks. At Cape John 
Barrow a large berg had been forced up on the solid rock of the cape, 
until one huge fragment la}' fully 100 feet above the high-tide level. 

Returning from my reconnoissance, I camped again at Camp Fraser, 
building the first of my snow igloos, which I intended should be con- 
structed at convenient intervals the entire distance to Fort Conger. 
The next three days were occupied in bringing the supplies at Cape 
Louis Napoleon up to Cape Fraser, and on the -ith of November I 
returned to the ship. The time until the return of the next moon was 
fully occupied in making and repairing sledges, bringing in beef from 
the cache on Bache Peninsula, and transporting supplies and dog food 
to Cape Hawkes, beyond the heavy going of Allman Bay. During 
much of this time the temperature was in the — 40°'s F. 

Noveniher 21. — Henson and 3 Eskimos left with loads, and on the 
22d 1 followed with a party of 3 to begin the work of the Novem])er 
moon. This work ended just after midnight of December 4, when the 
last sledges came in. It left 3,300 pounds of supplies and a quantitv 
of dog food at Cape Wilkes on the north side of Richardson Bay. 
These supplies would have been left at Cape Lawrence had it not been 
for the desertion and turning back of one of my men, discouraged with 
the hard work, while crossing Richardson Ba}^ Knowing it to be 
essential to prevent any recurrence of the kind, I pushed on to Cape 
Wilkes, camped, and turned in after a twenty-tive-hour day, slept three 
liours, then started with empty sledge, 8 picked dogs, and an Eskimo 
driver, to overtake my man. He was found at Cape Louis Napoleon, 
and after receiving a lesson was taken along with me to the ship. 

My party was left with instructions to bring up supplies which the 
wrecking of sledges had obliged me to cache at various places, assemble 
all at Cape Wilkes, and then, if I did not return, reconnoiter the ice 
foot to Rawlings Bay and return to the ship. The distance from Cape 
AVilkes to the Wind/mrd was 60 nautical miles in a straight line (as 
traveled b}" me along the ice foot and across the bays, not less than 90 
statute miles), and was covered in twenty-three hours and twenty min- 
utes, or twenty-one hours and thirty minutes actual traveling time. 
Temperature during the run, — 50 ' F. Ever}- sledge was more or less 
smashed in this two weeks' campaign, and at Cape John Barrow 
sledges and loads had to be carried on our l)acks over the ice jams. 
The mean daily minimum temperature for the thirteen days was —41.2° 
F. , the lowest, —50° F., which occurred on four successive days. The 
experience gained on this trip led me to believe that the conditions of 
travel from Cape Wilkes noi'thward, as far at least as Cape Defosse, 
would not differ materialh^ from those already encountered and enabled 
me to la}" my plans with somewhat greater detail. With the light of 
the December moon I would proceed to Cape Wilkes with such loads 
as would enable me to travel steadily without double banking, advance 



FIELD WORK OF THE PEAEY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 433 

everything" to Cape Lawrence on the north side of Rawling-s Bay, then 
go rapidl}' on to Fort Conger with light sledges, determine the condi- 
tion of the supplies left there, that 1 might know what I could depend 
upon, and thus save transportation of unnecessar}- articles, then return 
to the ship. 

In the Januar}" moon I would start with my entire party; move my 
supplies from Cape Lawrence to Fort Conger; remain there till the 
February moon, the light of which would merge into the beginning of 
the returning daylight; then sledge the supplies for the polar journe}' 
to Cape Hecla, and be in readiness to start from there, with rested and 
well-fed dogs, by the middle of March. In pursuance of this plan, 
the two weeks intervening between the departure of the November 
moon and the a])pearance of the December one were busily occupied 
in repairing and strengthening sledges, and making and overhauling 
clothing and equipment, to enable us to meet this long and arduous 
journey in the very midnight of the "great night.'" During this 
interval the temperature much of the time was at —50° F. and below. 

December W. — In the first light of the returning moon I left the 
Windivard with my doctor, Henson, 4 Eskimos, and 30 dogs, all that 
were left of the sixty odd of four months previous. Thick weathei", 
strong winds rushing out of Kennedy Channel, heavy snow, and an 
abominable ice foot in Rawlings Bay delayed me, and it was not until 
the 28th that I had all my supplies assembled at Cape Lawrence, on 
the north side of Rawlings Bay. 

Cape Lawrence presented the advantage of two possible routes by 
which these latter supplies could be reached from Conger, one through 
Kennedy Channel, which I was about to follow, and the other via 
Archer Fjord and overland. In spite of the delays, I felt on the whole 
well satisfied with the work up to the end of the year. I had all m}' 
supplies halfway to Fort Conger, and had comfortable snow igloos 
erected at Cape Hawkes, (.ape Louis Napoleon, Cape Fraser, Cape 
Norton Shaw, Cape Wilkes, and Cape Lawrence. 

December 29. — I started from Cape Lawrence with light sledges for 
Fort Conger, hoping to make the distance in five days. The first 
march from Cape Lawrence the ice foot was fairly good, though an 
inch or two of efilorescence made the sledges drag as if on sand. The 
ice foot grew steadily worse as we advanced, until after rounding Cape 
Defosse, it was almost impassable even for light sledges. The light of 
the moon lasted only for a few hours out of the twenty-four, and at 
its best was not sufiicient to permit us to select a route on the sea ice. 

Just south of Cape Defosse we ate the last of our biscuit, just north 
of it the last of our beans. On the next march a biting wind swept 
down the channel and numbed the Eskimo, who had spent the previ- 
ous winter in the States, to sueh an extent tliat to sa\e him we were 



434 FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLCTB, 1898-1902. 

obliged to halt just above Cape Cracroft and dig- a burrow in a snow- 
drift. When the storm ceased 1 left him with another Eskimo and 9 
of the poorest dogs and pushed on to reach Fort Conger. 

The moon had left us entirely now, and the ice foot was utterly 
impracticable, and we groped and stumbled through the rugged sea 
ice as far as Cape Baird. Here w^e slept a few hours in a burrow in 
the snow, then started across Lady Franklin Bay. In complete dark- 
ness and over a chaos of broken and heaved-up ice we stumbled and fell 
and groped for eighteen hours, till we <'limbed upon the ice foot of the 
north side. Here a dog was killed for food. Absence of suitable 
snow put an igloo out of the question, and a semicave under a large 
cake of ice was so cold that we could stop only long enough to make 
tea. Here I left a broken sledge and 9 exhausted dogs. Just east of 
us a iloe had been driven ashore, and forced up over the ice foot till 
its shattered fragments lay 100 feet up the talus of the l)lutJ'. It 
seemed impassable, but the crack at the edge of the ice foot allowed 
us to squeeze through; and soon after we rounded the point, and I was 
satisfied by the "'feeF' of the shore, for we could see nothing, that we 
were at one of the entrances of Discover}'" Harbor, l>ut which one I 
could not tell. Several hours of groping showed that it was the east- 
ern entrance. We had struck the center of Bellot Island, and at mid- 
night of January 6 we were stumbling through the dilapidated door of 
Fort Conger. A little remaining oil enabled me, )\v the light of our 
sledge cooker, to find the range and the stove in the officers' quarters, 
and after some difficulty fires were started in ])oth. When this was 
accomplished, a suspicious "wooden"'' feeling in my right foot led me 
to have my kamiks pulled off, and I found to my annoj^ance that both 
feet were frosted. Coffee from an open tin in the kitchen, and biscuit 
from the tal)le in the men's room, just as they had been dropped over 
fifteen years ago, furnished the menu for a simple but abundant lunch. 
A hasty search failing to discover matches, candles, lamps, or oil, we 
were forced to devise some kind of a light very quickly before our oil 
burned out. Half a bottle of olive oil, a saucer, and a bit of towel 
furnished the material for a small native lamp, and this, supplemented 
by pork fat and lard, furnished us light for several days, until oil was 
located. Throwing ourselves down on the cots in the officers' rooms, 
after everything had been done for my feet, w^e slept long and soundly. 
Awakening, it was evident that I should lose parts or all of several 
toes, and be confined for some weeks. The mean minimum temperature 
during the trip was —51.9'^ F., the lowest —63-^ F. 

During the following weeks our life at Conger was pronouncedly a 
la Robinson Crusoe. Searching for things in the unbroken darkness 
of the "Great Night," with a tiny flicker of flame in a saucer, was 
very like seeking a needle in a haystack. Gradually all the essentials 
were located, while my 2 faithful Eskimos brought in empty boxes

and barrels and broke them up to feed the tire. The dog's left on 
Bellot Ishxnd were brought in, Init sexeral died before they got used 
to the frozen salt pork and beef, which was all I had to feed them. 
The natives made two attempts to reach and bring- in tlie 2 men left 
at Cape Cracroft, but were driveji back both times b}' the darkness 
and furious winds. Finally, some ten days after we left the dugout, 
the}" reached it again, and found that the 2 men, after eating some 
of their dogs, had started for the ship on foot, the few remaining 
dogs following them. 

On the 18th of February the moonlight and the remaining twilight 
aiforded enough light for a fair day's march in each twenty-four hours; 
we started for the Windvxird. My toes were unhealed, the bones were 
protruding through the raw stumps on both feet, and I could hardly 
stand for a moment. I had 12 dogs left, but their emaciated condi- 
tion and the character of the road precluded riding b}^ anyone but 
myself. Lashed firmly down, with feet and legs wrapped in musk-ox 
skin, I formed the onh' load of one sledge. The other carried the 
necessar}' provisions. 

On the 28th we reached the WhiduHird^ ever}" one but mj^self having 
walked the entire distance of not less than 250 miles in eleven daj^s. 
Fortunately for us, and particularly for me, the weather during our 
return, though extremely cold, was calm, with the exception of one 
da}' from Cape Cracroft south, during which the furious wind kept us 
enveloped in driving snow. The mean hiinimum daily temperature 
while we were returning was — 56.18'^ F., reaching the lowest, — 65° 
F., the day we arrived at the W/?idward. 

Marc/i o. — 1 started one of my Eskimos for Whale Sound with a 
summons to the hunters there to come to me with their dogs and 
sledges. Between the 3d and 14th a party of Eskimos coming unex- 
pectedly, the last of the musk-ox meat on Bache Peninsula was 
l)rought to the ship, and another bull musk ox killed. 

March IS. — Thetinal amputation of my toes was performed. Pend- 
ing the arrival of more natives, I sent a dory to Cape Louis Napoleon 
to be cached and had dog food and current supplies advanced to Cape 
Fraser. 

March 31. — A contingent of 5 natives and 27 dogs came in. My 
messenger had been delayed by heavy winds and rough ice, and the 
ravages of the dog disease had made it necessary to send to the more 
southerly settlements for dogs. 

Ajn'il S. — Henson left with these natives and 35 dogs, with instruc- 
tions to move the supplies at Cape Lawrence to Carl Hitter Bay, then 
push on with such loads as he could carry without double banking to 
Fort ("onger, rest his dogs and dry his clothing, and if 1 did not join 
him bv that time to start back. 



436 FIELD WORK OF THP: PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 

April 19. — My left foot had healed, though still too weak ftnd stiff 
from long disuse for nie to inoYe without crutches. On this day I 
started for Fort Conger with a party of 10, some 50 dogs, and 7 
sledges loaded with dog food and supplies for return caches. 

April 23. — I met Henson returning with his party at Cape Law- 
rence. From there 1 sent back m}^ temporary help and borrowed 
dogs, and went on with a party of 7. including 5 natiYes. 

April 28. — We reached Conger. 

Jfay 4- — HaYing dried all our gear and repaired sledges, I started 
for a reconnoissance of the Greenland northwest coast. I should haYe 
started two daj^s earlier but for bad weather. Following a Yery ardu- 
ous ice foot to St. Patricks Bay, I found the bay tilled with broken 
pack ice covered with snow almost thigh deep. From the top of Cape 
Murchison, with a good glass, no practicable road could be seen. The 
following day I sent 2 men with empty sledges and a powerful team of 
dogs to Cape Beechy to reconnoiter from its summit. Their report 
was discouraging. Clear across to the Greenland shore, and up and 
down as far as the glass could reach, the channel was tilled with 
upheaved floe fragments, uninterrupted by young ice or large floes, 
and covered with deep snow. 

Crippled as 1 was, and a mere dead weight on the sledge, 1 felt that 
the road was impracticable. Had I been fit and in my usual place, 
ahead of the sledges breaking the ice with m}^ snowshoes, it would 
have been different. One chance remained — that of finding a passage 
across to the Greenland side at Cape Lieber. 

Returning to Conger, I sent Henson and one Eskimo oft' immediatelv 
on this reconnoissance, and later sent 2 men to Musk Ox Bay to look 
for musk oxen. Two days afterward they returned reporting 16 musk 
oxen killed, and Henson came in on the same day, reporting tlie con- 
dition of the channel off' Capes Lieber and Cracroft the same as that 
oft' Capes Beechy and Mirchison, and that they had been unable to 
get across. I now gave up the Greenland trip, and perhaps it was 
well that I did so, as the unhealed place on my right foot was begin- 
ning to break down and assume an unhealthy appearance from its 
severe treatment. As soon as the musk-ox skins and beef were 
brought in, the entire party, except myself and one Eskimo, went to 
the Bellows and Black Rock Vale for more musk oxen. Twelve were 
killed here, and the skins and meat brought to Conger. Not believ- 
ing it desirable to kill more musk oxen, and unable to do any travel- 
ing north, I completed the work of securing the meat and skins 
obtained; getting the records and private papers of the United States 
International Expedition together; securing, as far as possible, collec- 
tions and property; housing material and supplies still remaining 
serviceable, and making the house more comfortable for the purposes 
of my party. 



FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 437 

May "23. — We started for the ship, carrying only the scientific records 
of the expedition, the private papers of its members, and necessarj^ 
supplies. I was still oblig-ed to ride continuously. Favored with 
abundant light and continuously calm weather, and forcing the dogs 
to their best, the return to the ship was accomplished in six days, 
arriving there May 29. During ni}^ absence Captain Bartlett had 
built at Cape DTTrville, from plans which I had furnished him, a 
comfortable house of the boxes of supplies, double roofed with canvas, 
and banked in with gravel. 

June 1. — I sent one sledge load of provisions to Cape Louis Napoleon, 
and four to Cape Norton Shaw. 

Jtine 6. — I sent three loads to Carl Ritter Bav and two to Cape 
Lawrence. On the 25th of June the last of these sledges returned to 
the Windicard^ and the year's campaign to the north was ended. The 
return from Carl Ritter Bay had been slow, owing to the abundance of 
water on the ice foot and the sea ice of the bays, and the resulting sore 
feet of the dogs. 

Jtine 28. — A sufficient number of dogs had recovered from the effect 
of their work to enable me to make up two teams, and Henson was 
sent with these, four of the natives, and a dory, to make his w^ay to 
Etah and communicate with the summer ship immediately on her 
arrival, so that her time would not be wasted even should the Winchvard 
be late in getting out of the ice. 

t/une 29. — I started with two sledges and three natives to complete 
my surve}' of Princess Marie and Buchanan bays, and make a reconnois- 
sance to the westward from the head of the former. M}^ feet, which I 
had been favoring since my return from Conger, were now in fair 
condition, only a xevj small place on the right one remaining unhealed. 
Traveling and working at night and sleeping during the day, I 
advanced to Princess Marie Bay, crossed the narrow neck of Bache 
Peninsula, and camped on the morning of July 4 near the head of 
the northern arm of Buchanan Bay. Hardly was the tent set up 
when a bear was seen out in the bay, and we immediately went in 
pursuit, and in a short time had him killed. He proved to be a 
line large specimen. While after the bear I noticed a herd of musk 
oxen a few miles up the valley, and after the bear had been brought 
into camp and skinned, and we had snatched a few hours' sleep, we 
went after the musk oxen. Eight of these were secured, including 
two fine bulls and two live calves, the latter following us back to 
camp of their own accord. The next three days were occupied in 
getting the beef to camp. I then crossed to the southern arm of 
Buchanan J^ay, securing another musk ox. Returning to Princess 
Marie Ba}', I camped on the morning of the 14th at the glacier which 
fills the head of Sawyer Ba}-. 



438 FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 

During the following- .six days I ascended the glacier, crossed the 
ice cap to its western side, and from elevations of from 4,000 to 
4,700 feet looked down upon the snow-free western side of Ellesmere 
Land, and out into an ice-free fjord, extending some 50 miles to the 
northwest. The season here was at least a month earlier than on 
the east side, and the general appearance of the country reminded me 
of the Whale Sound region of Greenland. Clear weather for part of 
one day enabled me to take a series of angles, then fog and rain and 
snow settled down upon us. Through this I steered by compass back 
to and down the glacier, camping on the 21st in m^^ camp of the 15th. 
The return from here to the ship was somewhat arduous, owing to the 
rotten condition of the one-year ice and the deep pools and canals of 
water on the surface of the old floes. These presented the alternative 
of making endless detours or wading through water often waist deep. 
During seven days our clothing, tent, sleeping gear, and food w^ere 
constantly saturated. The Wmdivard was reached on the 28th of July. 

In spite of the discomforts and hardships of this trip, incident to 
the lateness of the season, I felt repaid by its results. In addition to 
completing the notes requisite for a chart of the Princess Marie- 
Buchanan Bay region, I had been fortunate in crossing the Ellesmere 
Land ice cap and looking upon the western coast. The game secured 
during this trip comprised a polar bear, 7 musk oxen, 3 oogsook, and 
14 seals. 

When I returned to the Windward she was round in the eastern side 
of Franklin Pierce Bay. A party had left two days before with dogs, 
sledge, and boat, in an attempt to meet me and suppl}^ me with pro- 
visions. Three days were occupied in communicating with them and 
getting them and their outlit on board. The WJndamnl then moved 
back to her winter berth at Cape D'Urville, took the dogs on board, 
and on the morning of Wednesay, August 2, got under way. 

During the next five da3^s we advanced some 12 miles, when a 
southerly wind jammed the ice on us and drifted us north abreast 
of the starting point. Early Tuesday morning, the 8th, we got another 
start, and the ice gradually slackening, we kept under way, reached 
open water a little south of Cape Albert, and arrived at Cape Sabine 
at 10 p. m. 

At Cape Sabine I landed a cache and then steamed over to Etah, 
arriving at 5 a. m. of the 9th. Here we found mail, and learned that 
the steamship Diana^ which the club had sent up to communicate with 
me, was out after walrus. Saturday morning the Diana returned, and 
1 had the great pleasure of taking Secretary Bridgman, commanding 
the club's expedition, by the hand. 

Though the year had not been marked by any startling results, it was 
a 3^ear of hard and continuous work for the entire party. During the 
year I obtained the material for an authentic map of the Buchanan Bay, 



FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 439 

Bache Peninsula, Princess Marie Bay region; crossed the EUesmere 
Land ice cap to the west side of that land; established a continuous 
line of caches from Cape Sabine to Fort Conger, containing some 14 
tons of supplies; rescued the original records and private papers of 
the Greely expedition; fitted Fort Conger as a base for future work, 
and familiarized myself and party with the entire region as far north 
as Cape Beech}-. 

With the exception of the supplies at Cape DTIrville, all the pro- 
visions, together with the current supplies and dog food (the latter an 
excessive item), had been transported l)y sledge. 

Finally, discouraging as was the accident to my feet, I was satisfied, 
since m}" effort to reach the northwest coast of Greenland from Conger 
in May, that the season was one of extremely unfavorable ice condition 
north of Cape Beechy, and doubt, even if the accident had not occurred, 
whether I should have found it advisable, on reaching Cape Hecla, to 
attempt the last stage of the journey. 

My decision not to attempt to winter at Fort Conger was arrived at 
after careful consideration. Two things controlled this decision : First, 
the uncertainty of carrying dogs through the winter, and, second, the 
comparative facility with which the distance from Etah to Fort 
Conger can be covered with light sledges. 

After the rendezvous with the Dhina^ I went on board the latter 

ship and visited all the native settlements, gathering skins and material 

for clothing and sledge equipment and recruiting my dog teams. The 

Windtvard was sent hunting walrus during my absence. The Diana 

also assisted in this work. 

August 25. — The Windward sailed for home, followed on the 28th 
by the Diana., after landing me with m}^ party, equipment, and 
additional supplies at Etah. 

1899-1900. 

The Diana seemed to have gathered in and taken with her all the 
fine weather, leaving us a sequence of clouds, wind, fog, and snow, 
which continued with scarcely a break for weeks. 

After her departure the work before me presented itself in its own 
natural sequence as follows: Protect the provisions, construct our win- 
ter quarters, then begin building sledges and grinding walrus meat 
for dog pemmican for the spring campaign. 

During the first month a number of walrus were killed from our 
boats ofi' the mouth of the fjord; then the usual Arctic winter settled 
down upon us, its monotony varied only by the visits of the natives, 
occasional doer hunts, and a December sledge joui'ney to the Eskimo 
settlements in Whale Sound as faras Kangerd-looksoah. In this nine- 
days' trip some 240 miles were covered in six marches, the first and 
the last marches being 60 to TO miles. T returned to Etah just in time 

SM 1903 29 



440 FIELD WOEK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 

to escape a severe snowstorm, which stopped communication between 
Etah and the other Eskimo settlements completely until I sent a party 
with snowshoes and a specially constructed sledge, carrying no load, 
and manned by double teams of dogs, to break the trail. 

During my absence some of my nativ^es had crossed to Mr. Stein's 
place at Sabine, and January *J I began the season's work by starting- 
a few sledge loads of dog food for Cape Sabine, for use of ni}^ teams in 
the spring journey. From this time on, as the open water in Smith 
Sound permitted, more dog food was sent to Sabine, and as the light 
gradually increased, some of ni}" Eskimos were kept constanth' at 
Sonntag Bay, some 20 miles to the south, on the lookout for walrus. 

My general progranuiie for the spring work was to send three 
divisions of sledges north as far as Conger, the first to be in charge of 
Henson, while I bi'ought up the rear with the third. 

From Conger I should send back a numl)er of Eskimos, retain some 
at Conger, and with others proceed north from there either via Hecla 
or the north point of Greenland, as circumstances might determine. 

I wanted to start the first division on the loth of Fel)ruary, the 
second a week later, and leave with the third March 1, but a severe 
storm, breaking up the ice between Etah and Littleton Island, delayed 
the departure of the first division of sev^en sledges until the 19th. 

The second division of six sledges started on the 26th, and ]\iarch 4 
I left wnth the rear division of nine sledges. Three marches carried us 
to Cape Sabine, along the curving northern edge of the north water. 
Here a northerly gale with hcavv drift detained me for two da3^s. 
Three more marches in a temperature of —40*- F. brought me to the 
house at Cape D'Urville. Records here informed me that the first 
division had been detained here a week by stormy weather, and the 
second division had left l)ut two days before nw arrival. I had 
scarcely arrived when two of Henson's Eskimos came in from Richard- 
son Bay, where one of them had severely injured his leg by falling 
under a sledge. One day was spent at the D'Urville house drying 
our clothing, and on the 13th I got away on the trail of the other 
divisions with seven sledges, the injured man going to Sabine with the 
supporting j)arty. 

I hoped to reach Cape Louis Napoleon on this march, but the going 
was too heavy and I was obliged to camp in Dobbin Bay, about 5 
miles short of the cape. 

The next day I hoped on starting to reach Cape Eraser, but was 
again disappointed, a severe windstorm compelling me to halt a little 
south of Hayes Point, and hurriedl>' build snow igloos in the midst of 
a blinding drift. 

All that night and the next day and the next night the storm con- 
tinued. An early start was made on the 16th, and in calm but very 
thick weather we pushed on to Cape Eraser. Here we encountered 



FIELD WOEK OF THE PEAEY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 441 

the wind and drift full in our faces and violent, making our progress 
from here to Cape Norton Shaw along- the ice-foot very trying. 

The going from here across Scoresby and Richardson ])ays was not 
worse than the year before; and from Cape Wilkes to Cape Lawrence 
the same as we had always found it. These two marches were made 
in clear but bitterly windy weather. 

Another severe southerl}^ gale held us prisoners at Cape Lawrence 
for a day. The 20th was an equally. cruel day, with wind still savage 
in its strength, but the question of food for mj^ dogs gave me no choice 
but to try to advance. At the end of four hours we were forced to 
burrow^ into a snow bank for shelter, where we remained till the next 
morning. 

Ln three more marches we reached Cape von Buch. Two more days 
of good weather brought us to a point a few miles north of Cape 
Defosse. Here we were stopped by another furious gale with drifting 
snow, which prisoned us for two nights and a day*. 

The wind was still bitter in our faces when w^e again got underway 
the morning of the 2Tth. The ice-foot became worse and worse up to 
Cape Cracroft, where we were forced down into the narrow tidal joint 
at the base of the ice-foot; this path was a very narrow and tortuous 
one, frequently interrupted, and was extremel}^ trying on men and 
sledges. Cape Lieber was reached on this march. At this camp the 
wind blew savagel}^ all night, and in the morning I waited for it to 
moderate before attempting to cross Lady Franklin Ba}'. 

While thus waiting, the returning Eskimos of the first and second 
divisions came in. They brought the very welcome news of the killing 
of 21 musk oxen close to Conger. They also reported the wind out 
in the ba}^ as less severe than at the cape. 

I immediately got underway and reached Conger just before mid- 
night of the 28th, twenty-four days from Etah, during six of which I 
was held up by storms. 

The first division had arrived four da3's and the second two da^'s 
earlier. During this journey there had been the usual annoying delays 
of broken sledges, and I had lost numbers of dogs. 

The process of breaking in the tendons and nuiscles of my feet to 
their new relations, and the callousing of the amputation scars, in this, 
the first serious demand upon them, had been disagreeable, but was, I 
believed, final and complete. 1 felt that I had no reason to complain. 

The herd of musk oxen so opportunely secured near the station, 
with the meat cached here the previous spring, furnished the means 
to feed and rest my dogs. A period of thick w(^ather followed my 
arrival at Conger, and not until April 2 could I send back the Eski- 
mos of my division. 

On leaving Etah I had not decided whether I should go north from 
Conger via Cape Hecla, or take the route along the northwest coast of 



442 FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 

Greenland. Now I decided upon the latter. The lateness of the season 
and the condition of my dogs might militate against a very long 
journey, and if I chose the Hecla route and failed of my utmost aims 
the result would be complete failure. If, on the other hand, I chose 
the Greenland route and found it impossible to proceed northward 
over the pack, I still had an unknown coast to exploit, and the oppor- 
tunity of doing valuable work. Later developments showed my decis- 
ion to be a fortunate one. 

I planned to start from Conger the 0th of April, but stormy weather 
delayed the departure until the 11th, when 1 got awa}^ with sev^en 
sledges. 

At the first camp beyond Conger my best Eskimo was taken sick, 
and the following day I brought him back to Conger, leaving the rest 
of the party to cross the channel to the Greenland side, where I would 
overtake them. This I did two or three days later, and we began our 
journey up the northwest Greenland coast. As far as Cape Sumner 
we had almost continuous road making through very rough ice. Before 
reaching Cape Sumner we could see a dark water sky, lying beyond 
Cape Brevoort, and knew that we should find open water there. 

From Cape Sumner to Polaris Boat Camp, in Newman Bay, we cut 
a continuous road. Here we were stalled until the 21st by continued 
and severe winds. Getting started again in the tail end of the storm, 
we advanced as far as the open water, a few miles east of Cape Brevoort, 
and camped. This open water, about 3 miles wide at the Greenland 
end, extended clear across the mouth of Robeson Channel to the Grin- 
nell Land coast, where it reached from Lincoln Bay to Cape Rawson. 
Bej'ond it to the north and northwest as far as could be seen were 
numerous lanes and pools. The next day was devoted to hewing a 
trail along the ice foot to Repulse Harbor, and on the 23d, in a violent 
gale accompanied by drift, I pushed on to the "Drift Point" of Beau- 
mont (and later Lockwood),a short distance west of Black Horn Cliffs. 

The ice foot as far as Repulse Harbor, in spite of the road making 
of the previous day, was very trjnng to sledges, dogs, and men. The 
slippery side slopes, steep ascents, and precipitous descents wrenched 
and strained the latter, and capsized, broke, and ripped shoes from the 
former. 

I was not surprised to see from the "Drift Point" igloo that the 
Black Horn Cliffs were fronted by open water. The pack was in motion 
here, and had only recently been crushing against the ice foot, where we 
built our igloo. I thought I had broken my feet in pretty thoroughly 
on my journey from Etah to Conger, but this day's work of handling a 
sledge along the ice-foot made me think they had never encountered 
any serious work before. A blinding snowstorm on the 24th kept us 
inactive. The next day 1 made a reconnoissance to the cliffs, and the 
next day set the entire party to work hewing a road along the ice foot. 



FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 443 

That night the temperature fell to —25° F. , forming a film of A'oung- ice 
upon the water. The next day I moved up close to the cliffs, and then 
with three Eskimos reconnoitered the young ice. I found that by 
proceeding with extreme care it would in most places support a man. 

With experienced Ahsayoo ahead constantl}^ testing the ice with his 
seal spear, m^^self next, and two Eskimos following, all with feet wide 
apart, and sliding instead of walking, we crept past the cliffs. Return- 
ing we brushed the thin film of newly fallen snow off' the ice with our 
feet for a width of some 4 feet, to give the cold free access to it. 

1 quote from my diary for the 27th: 

At last we are past the barrier, which has been looming before me for the last ten 
days, the open water at the Black Horn Cliffs. Sent two of my men, whose nerves 
are disturbed by the prospect ahead, back to Conger. This leaves me with Henson 
and three Eskimos. My supplies can now be carried on the remaining sledges. 
Still further stiffened by the continuous low temperature of the previous night, the 
main sheet of new ice in front of the cliffs was not hazardous as long as the sledges . 
kept a few hundred feet apart, did not stop, and their drivers kept some yards away 
to one side. Beyond the limit of my previous day's reconnoissance there were areas 
of much younger ice, which caused me considerable apprehension, as it buckled to a 
very disquieting extent beneath dogs and sledges, and from the motion of the outside 
pack was crushed up in places while narrow cracks opened up in others. Finally, 
to my relief, we reached the ice-foot beyond the cliffs and camped. 

The next day there was a continuous lane of water 100 feet wide 
along the ice foot by our camp, and the space in front of the cliffs was 
again open water. We crossed just in time. 

Up to Cape Stanton we had to hew a continuous road along the ice- 
foot. After this the going was much better to Cape Bryant. Off 
this section of the coast the pack was in constant motion, and an almost 
continuous lane of water extended along the ice foot. A little west of 
Cape Bryant I killed 2 musk oxenj the flesh of which jny dogs highly 
appreciated. A long search at Cape Br3'ant finally discoverd the 
remains of Lock wood's cache and cairn, which had been scattered by 
bears. At 3.30 p. m. the 1st of May I left Cape Bryant to cross the 
wide indentation lying between Cape Bryant and Cape Britannia. 
Three marches, mostl}' in thick weather and over alternating hum- 
mocky blue ice and areas of deep snow, brought us at la. m. of the 
4th to Cape North (the northern point of Cape Britannia Island). 
From this camp, after a sleep, I sent back 2 more Eskimos and the 12 
poorest dogs, leaving Henson, 1 Eskimo, and myself with 3 sledges 
and 10 dogs for the permanent advance party. 

From Cape North, a ribbon of young ice, on the so-called tidal crack 
which extends along this coast, gave us a good lift nearh^ across Nor- 
densk]"r)ld Inlet. Then it became unsafe, and we climbed a heavy rubble 
barrier to the old floe ice inside, which we followed to Cape Benet and 
camped. Here we were treated to another snowstorm. 



444 FIELD WOEK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 

Another strip of young- ice gave us a passage nearly across Mascart 
Inlet until, under Cape Payer, I found it so broken up that two of the 
sledges and nearly all of the dogs got into the water before we could 
escape from it. Then a pocket of snow, thigh and waist deep, over 
rul)ble ice under the lee of the cape stalled us completel}-. 1 pitched 
the tent, fastened the dogs, and we devoted the rest of the da}' to 
stamping a road through the snow with our snowshoes. Even then, 
when we started the next day, I was obliged to put two teams to one 
sledge in order to move it. 

Cape Pa3'er was a hard proposition. The first half of the distance 
round it we were obliged to cut a road, and on the last half, with 12 
dogs and 3 men to each sledge to push and pull them, snow-plow fash- 
ion, through the deep snow. 

Distant Cape was almost equally inhospitable, and it was onl}' after 
long and careful reconnoissance that we were able to get our sledges 
past along- the narrow crest of the huge ridge of ice_ forced up against 
the rocks. After this we had comparativelj' fair going on past Cape 
Ramsay, Dome Cape, and across Meigs Fiord as far as Mary Murray 
Island. Then came some heavy going, and at 11.40 p. m. of May 8 
we reached Lockwood's cairn on the north end of Lockwood Island. 
From this cairn I took the record and thermometer deposited there by 
Lockwood eighteen years before. The record was in a perfect state 
of preservation. 

One march from here carried us to Cape Washington. Just at mid- 
night we reached, the low point, which is visible from Lockwood Island, 
and great was mj' relief to see, on rounding this point, another splendid 
headland, with two magnificent glaciers debouching near it, rising 
across an intervening* inlet. I knew now that Cape Washington was 
not the northern point of Greenland, as 1 had feared. It would have 
been a great disappointment to me, after coming so far, to find that 
another's eyes had forestalled mine in looking- first upon the coveted 
northern point. 

Nearly all m}- hours for sleep at this camp were taken up by obser- 
vations and a round of angles. The ice north from Cape Washington 
was in a frightful condition, utterly impractical )le. Leaving Cape 
Washington, we crossed the mouth of the fiord, packed with blue-top 
floe bergs, to the western edge of one of the big glaciers, and then over 
the extremity of the glacier itself, camping near the edge of the second. 
Here I found myself in the midst of the birthplace of the '"floe bergs," 
which could be seen in all the various stages of formation. These 
floe bergs are merel}^ degraded icebergs — that is, bergs of low alti- 
tude, detached from the extremity of a glacier, which has for some 
distance been forcing its way along a comparatively level and shallow 
sea bottom.

FIELD WOKK OF THE PEAKY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 445 

From this camp we crossed the second glacier, then a small fiord, 
where our eyes were gladdened In' the sight of a polar ])ear, which a 
couple of bullets from my carbine quickly transformed into dog meat 
for my faithful teams. The skin of this bear I have brought l)ack as 
a troph}' for the club. 

It was evident to me now that we were very near the northern 
extremity of the land, and when we came within view of the next point 
ahead, I felt that my eyes rested at last upon the Arctic Ultima Thule 
(Cape Morris Jesup). The land ahead also impressed me at once as 
showing the characteristics of a musk-ox country. 

This point was reached in the next march, and I stopped to take 
variation and latitude sights. Here my Eskimo shot a hare, and we 
saw a wolf track and traces of musk oxen. A careful reconnoissance 
of the pack to the northward, with glasses, from an elevation of a 
few hundred feet, showed the ice to be of a less impracticable charac- 
ter than it was north of Cape Washington. What were evidently 
water clouds showed ver}^ distinctl}' on the 4iorizon. This water sk}^ 
had been apparent ever since we left Cape Washington, and at one 
time assumed such a shape that I was almost deceived into taking it 
for land. Continued careful observation destroyed the illusion. My 
obversations completed, we started northward over the pack, and 
camped a few miles from land. 

The two following marches were made in a thick fog, through which 
we groped our way northward over broken ice and across gigantic, 
wave-like drifts of hard snow. One more march in clear weather 
over frightful going, consisting of fragments of old Hoes, ridges of 
heav}^ ice thrown up to heights of 25 to 50 feet, crevasses and holes 
masked by snow, the whole intersected by narrow leads of open water, 
l)rought us at 5 a. m., on the 16th, to the northern edge of a fragment 
of an old floe bounded by water. A reconnoissance from the summit 
of a pinnacle of the floe, some 50 feet high, showed that we were on 
the edge of the disintegrated pack, with a dense water skv not far 
distant. 

My hours for sleep at this camp were occupied in observations, and 
making a transit profile of the northern coast from Cape Washington 
eastward. 

The next day I started back for the land, and having a trail to 
follow, and no time wasted in reconnoissance, reached it in one long- 
march, and camped. 

Leaving this camp on the 18th, as we were traveling eastward on 
the ice foot an hour later, I saw a herd of 6 musk oxen in one of t}i(> 
coast valleys, and in a short time had secured them. Skinning and 
cutting up these animals and feeding the dogs to repletion consumed 
some hours, and we then I'esumed our march, getting an unsuccessful 
shot at a passing wolf as we went. 



446 FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 

AVithin a mile of our next camp a herd of 15 musk oxen la}^ fast 
asleep; I left them undisturbed. From here on, for three marches, we 
reeled off splendid distances over good going-, in blinding sunshine, 
and in the face of a wind from the east which burned our faces like a 
sirocco. 

The first march took us to a magnificent cape (Cape Bridgman), 
at which the northern face of the land trends away to the southeast. 
This cape is in the same latitude as Cape Washington. The next two 
carried us down the east coast to the eighty -third parallel. In the 
first of these we crossed the mouth of a large fjord penetrating for a 
long distance in a southwesterly (true) direction. On the next, in a 
fleeting glimpse through the fog, I saw a magnificent mountain of 
peculiar contour which 1 recognized as the peak seen by me in 1895 
from the summit of the interior ice cap south of Independence Bay, 
rising proudly above the land to the north. This mountain was then 
named by me Mount AVistar. Finally, the density of the fog compelled 
a halt on the extremity of a low point, composed entirely of fine glacial 
drift, and which I judged to be a small island in the mouth of a large 
fjord. 

From my camp of the previous night I had observed this island (?) 
and beyond and over it. a massive block of a mountain, forming the 
opposite cape of a large intervening fjord, and be3^ond that again 
another distant cape. Open water was clearh^ visible a few miles off 
the coast, while, not far out, dark water clouds reached a'way to the 
southeast. 

At this camp I remained two nights and a day, waiting for the fog 
to lift. Then, as there seemed to be no indications of its doing so, 
and my provisions were exhausted, I started on my return journey at 
3.30 a. m. on the 22d of May, after erecting a cairn, in which I depos- 
ited the following record:

The fog kept compai^y with us on our return ahiiost continuously 
until we had passed Lockwood Island, but, as we had a trail to follow, 
did not delay us so much as the several inches of heavy snow that fell 
in a furious arctic blizzard, which came rushing in from the polar 
basin and imprisoned us for two daj's at Cape Bridgman, 

At Cape Morris K. Jesup, the northern extremity, I erected a 
prominent cairn, in which I deposited the following record:

May 17. — "Have returned to this point. Reached 83° 50^ north latitude due north 
of here. Stopped by extremely rough ice intersected by wajter cracks. Water sky 
to north. Am now going east along the coast. Fine weather." 

May 26. — "Have again returned to this place. Reached point on east coast about 
north latitude 83°. Open water all along the coast a few miles off. No land seen' 
to north or east. Last seven days continuous fogs, wind, and snow. Is now snow- 
ing, with strong w'esterly wind. Temperature 20° F. Ten musk oxen killed east of 
here. Expect to start for Conger to-morrow." 

At Cape Washington, also, I placed a copy of Lockwood's rec- 
ord, from the cairn at Lockwood Island, with the following indorse- 
ment: 

This copy of the record left liy Lieut. J. B. Lockwood and Sergt. (now colonel) 
D. L. Brainard, U. S. Army, in the cairn on Lockwood Island, southwest of here, 
May 16, 1882, is to-daj' placed by me in this cairn on the farthest land seen by them, 
as a tribute to two l)rave men, one of whom gave his life for his Arctic work. 

May 29. — For a few minutes on one of the marches the fog lifted, 
giving us a magnificent panorama of the north coast mountains. 
Very somber and savage they looked, towering white as marble with 
the newly fallen snow, under their low threatening canop}" of lead- 
colored clouds. Two herds of musk oxen were passed — one of 15 
and one of 18 — and two or three stragglers. Four of these were 
shot for dog food, and the skin of one, killed within less than a mile 
of the extreme northern point, has been brought back as a trophy for 
the club. 

Once free of the fog oft" Mary ]\Iurray Island we made rapid prog- 
ress, reaching Cape North in four marches from Cape Washington. 



448 FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 

Clear weather showed us the existence of open water a feAv miles off 
the shore, extending from Dome Cape to Cape Washington. At Black 
Cape there was a large open water reaching from the shore northward. 
Everywhere along this coast I was impressed by the startling evi- 
dences of the violence of the l)lizzard of a few days before. The 
polar pack had been driven resistlessly in against the iron coast, and 
at every projecting point had risen to the crest of the ridge of old ice, 
along the outer edge of the ice foot in a terrific cataract of huge 
blocks. In places these mountains of shattered ice were 100 feet or 
more in height. The old ice in the bays and fjords had had its outer 
edge loaded with a great ridge of ice fragments, and was itself cracked 
and crumpled into huge swells by the resistless pressure. All the 
voung ice which had helped us on our outward passage had l)een 
crushed into countless fragments, and swallowed up in the general 
chaos. 

Though hampered by fog. the passage from Cape North to Cape 
Bryant was made in twenty-five and a half marching hours. At 7 
a. m. of the 6th of June, we camped on the end of the ice foot, at the 
eastern end of Black Horn Cliff's. A point a few hundred feet up the 
bluff's coimnanding the region in front of the cliffs showed it to be 
tilled by small ]:)ieces of old ice held in place against the shore by pres- 
sure of the outside pack. It promised at best the heaviest kind of 
work, with the certainty that it would run a1)road at the first release 
of pressure. 

The next da}-, when about one-third the way across, the ice did begin 
to open out, and it was only after a rapid and hazardous dash from 
cake to cake that we reached an old floe, which after several hours of 
heavy work allowed us to climb upon the ice-foot of the western end 
of the cliff's. 

From here on rapid progress was made again, three more marches 
taking us to Conger, where we arrived at 1.30 a. m. June 10, though 
the open water between Repulse Harbor and Cape Brevoort, which 
had now expanded down Robeson Channel to a point below Cape 
Sumner and the rotten ice under Cape Sumner hampered us seriousl}". 
In passing I took copies of the Beaumont English records from the 
cairn at Repulse Harbor, and brought them back for the archives of 
the club. They form one of the ffnest chapters of the most splendid 
courage, fortitude, and endurance, under dire stress of circumstances, 
that is to be found in the histor}" of Arctic explorations. 

In this journey I had determined conclusively the northern limit of 
the Greenland Archipelago or land group, and had practically con- 
nected the coast southward to Independence Bay, leaving only that 
comparatively short portion of the peripherv of Greenland lying 
between Independence Bay and Cape Bismarck indeterminate. The 
nonexistence of land for a very considera))le distance to the northward

and northeastward was also settled, with every indication pointing to 
the belief that the coast along- which we traveled formed the shore of 
an uninterrupted central polar sea, extending to the Pole, and l)eyond 
to the Spitzbergen and Franz Josef Land groups of the opposite 
hemisphere. 

The origin of the floe bergs and palJeocr3^stic ice was detinitely 
determined. Further than this, the result of the journej^ was to elim- 
inate this route as a desirable or practicable one b}^ which to reach 
the Pole. The broken character of the ice, the large amount of open 
water, and the comparative!}" rapid motion of the ice, as it swung 
round the northern coast into the southerly setting East Greenland 
current, were ver}' unfavorable features. 

During my absence some 33 musk oxen and 10 seals had been 
secured in the vicinity of Conger; caches for m}^ return had been 
established at Thank God Harbor, Gape Lieber, and Lincoln Bay, and 
sugar, milk, and tea had been brought up from the various caches 
between Conger and Cape Louis Napoleon. 

July was passed by a portion of the party in the region from 
Discover}" Harbor westward via Black Rock Vale and Lake Hazen, 
where some 40 nmsk oxen were secured. 

During August and earh^ September various other hunting trips of 
shorter duration were made, resulting in the killing of some 20 musk 
oxen. 

1900-1901. 

The middle of September 1 started with Henson and 4 Eskimos to 
Lake Hazen to secure musk oxen for our winter supply, it being evi- 
dent that my ship would not reach us. Going Avestasfar as the valley 
of the Very River, l)y October 4, 92 musk oxen had been killed. 
Later 9 more were secured, making a total of 101 for the autumn 
hunting. 

From the beginning of November to March 6, the greater j)ortion 
of the time was passed Ijy my party in igloos built in the vicinity of 
the game killed in various localities from Discovery Harbor to Ruggles 
River. 

April 5. — I left Conger with Henson, 1 Eskimo, 2 sledges, and 12 
dogs for my northern trip. At the same time the remainder of the 
party, with 2 sledges and 7 dogs and pups, started south for Capes 
D'Urville and Sabine to communicate with or obtain tidings of my 
ship. On reaching Lincoln Bay, it was evident to me that the condi- 
tion of men and dogs was such as to negative the possibility of reach- 
ing the pole, and I reluctantly turned back. 

Arriving at Conger, after an absence of eight days, J found the 
remainder of my party there. They had returned to Conger after an 
absence of four days, having proceeded one-third of the distance across 
Ladv Franklin Bav. 



450 FIELD WORK OF TBE PEARY ARCTIC CLU3, 1898-1902. 

Fortunately, the night before I arrived, one of the Eskimos secured 
several musk oxen above St. Patricks Bav, which enabled me to feed 
my dogs Ijefore starting south, which I did with the entire party on 
April IT. 

April 30. — At Hayes Point I met the party from the Whu7v:ard 
attempting to reach Conger, and received my mail, learning that the 
Windward was at Payer Harbor with Mrs. Peary and our little girl 
on board. After a rest at the D'Urville box house, I went on to the 
Windward, arriving May 6. 

After a few days' rest the work of establishing pew caches along the 
coast northward toward Conger was commenced, and continued until 
the middle of June. 

Then the preparing of Payer Harbor for winter quarters was car- 
ried on till July 3, when the Windward broke out of the ice and 
steamed over to the Greenland side. 

July was devoted to killing walrus, and li}8 were secured and trans- 
ported to Pa3^er Harbor. 

Ai/r/ust 4.. — The Erik, sent up b}' the club in command of Secretary 
H. L. Bridgman to communicate with me, arrived at Etah. 

The usual tour of visits to the Eskimo settlements was then made, 
and both ships pressed into the work of hunting walrus until August 
24, when the Windwa7'd proceeded southward, and the Erik steamed 
away to land me and my party and the catch of walrus at Paj^er 
Har})or. 

A large quantity of heavy ice blocking the way to Payer Harbor, I 
requested Secretary Bridgman to land me and my party and walrus 
meat in a small bight, some 12 or 15 miles south of Cape Sabine, from 
whence I could proceed to Payer Harbor in ni}' boats or sledges when 
opportunity offered. This was done, and on the 29th of August the 
Erik steamed away. 

1901-2. 

On the 16th of September I succeeded in reaching Payer Harbor, 
crossing Rosse Bay partly by sledge and partly by boat, and going 
overland across Bedford Pim Island. 

Soon after this my Eskimos began to sicken, and ])y November 19, 
6 of them were dead. 

During this time I personall}^ sledged much of the material from 
Erik Harbor to headquarters, and Henson went to the head of Buchanan 
Bay with some of the Eskimos and secured 10 musk oxen. 

The winter passed quietly and comfortabl3\ Two more musk oxen 
were secured in Buchanan Bay, and 6 deer at Etah. 

January 2. — ^Work was begun in earnest on preparations for the 
spring campaign, which opened on the 11th of February. On this 
day I sent off 6 sledges, with light loads, to select a road across the

mouth of Buchanan Bay, and build an igloo abreast of Cape Albert. 
On the 12th I sent two of my best hunters on a flying- reconnoissance 
and bear hunt in the direction of Cape Louis Napoleon. 

On the 13th 8 sledges went out, taking dog food nearly to Cape 
D'Urville. On the 16th my two scouts returned with a favorable 
report, and on the 18th 10 sledges went out loaded with dog food to 
l)e taken to Cape Louis Napoleon. This party returned on the 22d. 

On the evening of the 28th everything was in readiness for Henson 
to start the next day, it being my intention to send him on ahead with 
three picked men and light loads to pioneer the way to Conger, I to 
follow a few da3's later with the main party. 

A northerly gale delayed his departure until the morning of March 
3, when he got away with 6 sledges and some 50 dogs. Two of these 
sledges were to act as a supporting party as far as Cape Lawrence. 

At 9 a. m. of March 0, 14 sledges trailed out of Pa3^er Harbor and 
rounded Cape Sabine for the northern journe}', and at noon I followed 
them with ni}- big sledge, the "Long Serpent," drawn by a team of 10 
fine grays. Two more sledges accompanied me. The temperature 
at the time was —20° F. The minimum of the previous night had 
been -38^ F. 

We joined the others at the igloos abreast of Cape Albert, and 
camped there for the night. Temperature —43-^ F. 

The next da}' we made Cape D'Urville in temperature from —45° 
to -49- F. 

Here I stopped a day to dr}- our foot gear thoroughly, and left on 
the morning of the 9th with some supplies from the box house. Two 
sledges returned from here. Camped about 5 miles from Cape Louis 
Napoleon. The next march carried me to Cape Fraser. and the next 
to Cape Collinson. During this march, for the first time in the four 
seasons that I have been over this route, I was able to take a nearly 
direct course across the mouth of Scoresby Ba}'. instead of making a 
long detour into it. 

One march from Cape Collinson carried me to Cape Lawrence, on 
the north side of Rawlings Bay. 

The crossing of this bay, though more direct than usual, was over 
extrerael}' rough ice. Learning from Henson's letter at Cape Law- 
rence that I had gained a day on him, and not wanting to overtake him 
before reaching Conger, 1 remained here a day, repairing several 
sledges which had been damaged in the last march. Five men, with 
the worst sledges and poorest dogs, returned from here. 

Three more marches took us to Cape von Buch, on the north side 
of Carl Ritter Bay, temperature ranging from —35- to — 45° F. 
Heavy going in many places. 

Two more marches carried us to the first coast valley north of 
Cape Defosse. I had now gained two days on the advanc'e party. 



452 FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 

The character of the channel ice being- such that we were a1)le to 
avoid the terrible ice foot whicli extends from here to Cape Lieber, 
and ni}' dogs being still in good condition, I made a spurt from here 
and covered the distance to Conger in one march, arriving about an 
hour and a half after Henson and his party. 

I had covered the distance from Payer Harbor to Conger, some 300 
miles, in twelve marches. 

Four days were spent at Conger overhauling sledges and harness, 
drying and repairing clothing, and scouting the countr}^ as far as The 
Bellows, in search of musk oxen. None were seen, but about 100 
hares were secured in the four days. Temperature during this time from 
—40° to —57° F. Seven Eskimos returned from here, taking with 
them the instrvmients of the Lady Franklin Bay Expedition and other 
items of Government property abandoned here in 1883. 

On the morning of the 24th I started north with nine sledges. We 
camped the tirst night at "Depot B.'' The next mai'ch I had counted 
on making Lincoln Bay, but just before reaching Wrangell Bay a sud- 
den, furious gale, w'ith blinding drift, drove us into camp at the south 
point of the ba}'. Here we were storm bound during the 2()th, but 
got away on the morning of the 27th and pushed on to Cape Union, 
encountering along this .portion of the coast the steep side slopes of 
hard snow, which arc so trying to men and sledges and dogs. 

Open water, the clouds over which we saw from Wrangell Bay Camp, 
was about 100 yards bevond our igloo, and extended from there, as 1 
judged, northward beyond Cape Rawson, and reached entirely across 
the channel to the Greenland coast at Cape Brevoort, as in 1900. 

Fortunately, with the exercise of utmost care, and at the expense of 
a few narrow Escapes and incessant hard work, we were able to work 
our sledges along the narrow and villainous ice-foot to and around 
Black Cape. 

The ice foot along this section of the coast was the same as was 
found here b}" Egerton and Rawson in 1876 and Pavy in 1882, 
necessitating the hewing of an almost continuous road; but a party of 
willing, light-hearted Eskimos makes comparatively easy work of what 
would be a slow and heart-breaking job for two or three white men. 
Beyond Black Cape the ice foot improved in character, and I pushed 
along to camp at the Alert's winter quarters. Simultaneously with 
seeing the Alerfs cairn three musk oxen were seen a short distance 
inland, which I went away after and secured. The animals were very 
thin, and furnished but a scant meal for my dogs. 

One march from here carried us to Cape Richardson, and the next 
under the lee of View Point, where we were stopped, and driven to 
build our igloo with all possible speed, by one of the common arctic 
gales. There were voung ice, pools of water, and a nearly continuous 
water sky all along the shore. 



FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 453 

As the last march had been through deep suow, I did not dare to 
attempt the English short cut across Fielden Peninsula behind Cape 
Joseph Henry, preferring to take the ice-foot route round it. 

For a short distance this was the worst bit of ice foot I have ever 
encountered. By the slipping of my sledge two men nearl}- lost their 
lives, saving themselves by a most fortuitous chance, with their feet 
already dangling over the crest of a vertical face of ice some 50 feet 
in height. 

At the very extremity of the cape we were forced to pass our sledges 
along a shelf of ice less than 3 feet in width, glued against the face 
of the cliti at an elevation which I estimated at the time as 75 feet 
above the ragged surface of the floe beneath. 

On the western side of the cape the ice foot broadened and became 
nearly level, but was smothered in such a depth of light snow that 
it stalled us and we went into camp. The next day we made Crozier 
Island. 

During April 2 and 3 we were held here by a westerh' storm, and 
the 4th and 5th were devoted to hunting musk oxen, of which 3 were 
secured, 2 of them being very small. 

From here 1 sent ])ack 3 Eskimos, keeping Henson and 4 Eskimos 
with me. 

During this time reconnoissances of the polar pack northward were 
made with the glasses from the summit of the island and from Cape 
Hecla. The pack was very rough, but apparently not as bad as that 
which 1 saw north of Cape Washington two 3-ears before. Though 
unquestionably a hard proposition, it 3-et looked as though we might 
make some progress through it, unless the snow was too deep and soft. 
This was a detail which the glasses could not determine. 

On the morning of April 6 1 left Crozier Island, and a few hours 
later, at the point of Cape Hecla, we swung our sledges sharply to the 
right, and climbed over and down the parapet of the ice foot onto the 
polar pack. As the sledges plunged down from the ice foot their 
noses were buried out of sight, the dogs wallowed belly deep in the 
snow, and we began our struggle due northward. 

We had been in the lield now just a month. We had covered not 
less than 400 miles of the most arduous traveling in temperatures of 
from —35^ to —57"^ F., and we were just beginning our work— i. e., 
the conquest of the polar pack, the toughest proposition in the whole 
wide expanse of the arctic region. 

Some two miles from the cape was a belt of ver}- recent young ice, 
running parallel with the general trend of the coast. Areas of rough 
ice caught in this compelled us to exaggerated zigzags, and doubling 
on our track. It was easier to go a mile around on the young ice than 
to force the sledge across one of these islands. The northern edge of 
the new ice was a high Avail of heavily ru])l)led old ice, through which, 



45'1 FIELD WORK OF THE PEARY ARCTIC CLUB, 1898-1902. 

after some reconnoissance, we found a passage to an old floe, where I 
gave the order to build an igloo. We were now about 5 miles from 
the land. 

The morning- of the Tth brought us fine weather. Crossing the old 
floe we came upon a zone of old floe fragments, deeply blanketed 
with snow. Through the irregularities of this we struggled, the 
dogs floundering almost useless, occasionall}' one disappearing for a 
moment, now treading down the snow around a sledge to dig it out of 
a hole into which it had sunk, now lifting the sledges bodily over a 
barrier of blocks, veering right and left, doubling in our track, road 
making with snowshoe and pickax. Late in the day a narrow ditch 
gave us a lift for a short distance, then one or two little patches of 
level going, then two or three small old floes, which though deep with 
snow, seemed like a godsend compared with the wrenching work 
earlier. Camped in the lee of a large hummock on the northern 
edge of a small but very heav}" old floe. P^veryone thoroughly tired, 
and the dogs utterly lifeless, dropping motionless in the snow as soon 
as the wdiip stopped. 

We were now due north of Ilecla, and I estimated we had made 
some 6 miles, perhaps 7, perhaps onl}^ 5. A day of work like this 
makes it difficult to estimate distances. This is a fair sample of our 
day's work. 

On the 12th we were storm bound by a gale from the west, which 
hid even those dogs fastened nearest to the igloo. During our stay 
here the old floe on which we were camped split in two with a loud 
report, and the ice cracked and rumbled and roared at frequent 
intervals. 

In the first march beyond this igloo we were deflected westward by 
a lead of practically open water, the thin film of young ice covering it 
being unsafe even for a dog. A little farther on a wide canal of open 
water deflected us constantl}" to the northwest and then west, until an 
area of extremely rough ice prevented us from following it farther. 
Viewed from the top of a high pinnacle this area extended west and 
northwest on both sides of the canal, as far as could be seen. I could 
only camp and wait for this canal, which evidenth' had been widened 
(though not newly formed) bv the storm of the day before, to close up 
or freeze over. During our first sleep at this camp there was a slight 
motion of the lead, but not enough to make it practicable. From here 
I sent back two more Eskimos. 

Late in the afternoon of the 14:th the lead began to close, and hastily 
packing the sledges we rushed them across over moving fragments of 
ice. We now found ourselves in a zone of high parallel ridges of 
rul)l)le ice covered with deep snow. These ridges were caused by 
successive opening and closing of the lead. When after some time 
we found a practicable pass through this barrier, we emerged upon a

series of veiy small l>ut extremely heavy and rugiied old floes, the 
snow on them still deeper and softer than on the southern side of the 
lead. At the end of a sixteen-hour day I called a halt, thouo-h we 
were only 2 or 3 miles north of the big- lead. 

During the first portion of the next maivh we passed over frag- 
ments of very heavy old floes, slowl}' moving eastward. Frequently 
we were obliged to wait for the pieces to crush close enough together 
to let us pass from one to the other. Farther on I was compelled to 
bear away due east by an impracticable area, extending west, north- 
west, north, and northeast as far as could be seen, and just as we had 
rounded this and were bearing away to the north again we were 
brought up V)y a lead some 50 feet wide. From this on one day was 
much like another, sometimes doing a little better, sometimes a little 
worse, but the dail}" advance, in spite of our best efforts, steadily 
decreasing. Fog and stormy weather also helped to dela}' us. 

I quote from my journal for April 21: 

The game is off. My dream of sixteen years is ended. It cleared during the 
night and we got under way this morning. Deep snow. Two small old floes. Then 
came another region of old rubble and deep snow. A survey from the top of a pin- 
nacle showed this extending north, east, and west, as far as could be seen. The two 
old floes over which we had just come are the only ones in sight. It is impracti- 
cable, and I gave the order to camp. 1 have made the best fight I knew. I l)elieve 
it has been a good one. But I can not accomplish the impossible 

A few hours after we halted, the ice to the north commenced like 
the sound of heavy surf, and continued during our stay at this camp. 
Evidently the floes in that direction were crushing together under the 
influence of the wind, or, what was perhaps more probable, from the 
long continuation of the noise, the entire pack was in slow motion to 
the east. A clear day enabled me to get observations which showed 
my latitude to be 84° 17' 27" north, magnetic variation 99° west. I 
took some photos of the camp, climbed and floundered through the 
broken fragments and waist-deep snow for a few hundred yards north 
of the camp, gave the dogs a double ration, then turned in to sleep, if 
possible, for a few hours preparatory to returning. 

We started on our return soon after midnight of the 21st. It was 
very thick, wind from the west, and snowing heavily. I hurried our 
departure in order to utilize as much of our tracks as possible before they 
were obliterated. It was ver}- diflicult to keep the trail in the uncertain 
light and driving snow. We lost it repeatedly, when we would ])e 
obliged to quarter the surface like bird dogs. On reaching the last lead 
of the upward march, instead of the open water which had interrupted 
our progress then, our tracks now disappeared under a huge pressure 
ridge, which I estimated to be from To to 100 feet high. Our trail 
was faulted here by the movement of the floes, and we lost consider- 
able time in picking it up on the other side. This was to me a trying

miirch. 1 had had no sleep the nioht before, and to the physical strain 
of handling- my sledge was added the mental tax of trying to keep the 
trail. When we finally camped it was only for a few hours, for I 
recognized that the entire pack was moving slowly, and that our trail 
was everywhere being faulted and interrupted l)y new pressure ridges 
and leads in a way to make our return march nearly if not quite as 
slow and laborious as the outward one. The following marches were 
nuich the same. In crossing one lead I narrowly escaped losing two 
sledges and the dogs attached to them. Arrived at the "grand canal," 
as 1 called the big lead at which I had sent two Eskimos back, the 
changes had ])een such as to make the ])lace almost unrecognizable. 

Two marches south of the grand canal the changes in the ice had 
been such, betweeii the time of our upward trip and the return of my 
two men from the canal, that they, experienced men that they were 
in all that pertains to ice craft, had been hopelessly bewildered and 
wandered apparently for at least a day without finding the trail. 
After their passage other changes had taken place, and as a result I 
set a compass course for the land and began making a new road. In 
the next march we picked up our old trail again. 

Early in the morning of the 2'2d we reached the second igloo out 
from Cape Hecla and camped in a di'iving snowstorm. At this igloo 
we were storm bound during the 2Tth and 28th, getting awa}- on the 
29th in the densest fog, and bent on ])utting our way in a "bee-line" 
compass course for the land. Floundering through the deep snow 
and ice. saved from unpleasant falls only by the forewarning of the 
dogs, we reached Crozier Island after a long and wear}^ march. The 
band of 3'oung ice along the shore had disappeared, crushed up into 
confused ridges and mounds of irregular blocks. 

The floe at the island camp had split in two, the crack passing 
through our igloo, the halves of which stared at each other across the 
chasm. This march finished two of my dogs, and three or four more 
were apparently on their last legs. We did not know" how tired we 
were until we reached the island. The warm foggy weather and the 
last march together dropped our ph3^sical barometer several degrees. 

As we now had light sledges, I risked the short cut across the base 
of Fieldin Peninsula, and camped that night under the lee of View 
Point. Four more marches carried us to Conger, where we remained 
three days drying clothing and repairing sledges, and giving the dogs 
a much-needed rest. Leaving Conger on the 6th of May, 11 marches 
])rought us back to Payer Har])or on the 17th of May. A few days 
after this I went north to complete the survey of the inner portions 
of Dobbin Bay, being absent from headquarters sonu^, ten days. Open 
water vetoing a trip which I had planned for June up Buchanan Bay 
and across to the west coast of EUesmere Land, the remainder of the

time was devoted to assiduous hunting, in order to secure a suppl}" of 
meat for the winter in the conting-ency of no ship arriving. 

On the 5th of August the new Wlndvxird sent north by the ckib, 
and bringing to me Mrs. Peary and my little girl, steamed into the 
harbor. As soon as people and supplies could be hurried aboard her, 
she steamed across the sound to the Greenland side. Here my faith- 
ful Eskimos were landed, and after devoting a week or so to the work 
of securing sufficient walrus to carry them in comfort through the 
winter, the Whidward steamed southward, and after an uneventful 
voyage arrived at Sydne}^ C. B., on the ITth of September, where I 
had the pleasure of meeting Secretar}^ Bridgman of the club, and for- 
warding through him a brief report of my movements during the past 
year. 



THE FIRST YEAR\S WORK OF THE NATIONAL ANTARCTIC 

EXPEDITION/' 



By Sir Clements R. Markham, K. C. B., F. R. S. 



We must all, I think, feel that this is a great occasion. We have 
received news of the splendid work done by our countrvmen in the 
far south, and we are assembled to acquire some idea of the nature of 
that work, and of the g-eneral results. We shall effect this object by 
means of Mr. Skelton's photographs, and of the best map we have been 
able to construct with the materials that have reached us. We do not 
intend to discuss or to describe the scientific results of this work. We 
have not the means. All that is reserved for the grand da}' when we 
welcome the return of Captain Scott and his fellow-explorers to this 
country. To-night should rather be devoted to an endeavor to under- 
stand and to appreciate the high qualities, the indomital)le energy, the 
strict sense of duty, the courage and hardihood which enabled our 
countrvmen to make the extensive discoveries which are shown on the- 
map. They represent an achievement Avhich is quite imsurpassed in 
m}^ time. 

Before following the memorable voyage, I must say a ver}" few 
words on the subject of the arrangements for the expedition in this 
country. When the two societies approached the Government with a 
view to obtaining assistance in June, 1899, Mr, Balfour spoke in the 
strongest terms of the importance of such an expedition, both from a 
scientific and a national point of view, and he was told that it would 
be necessary to build a ship specially adapted for the service, among 
other reasons for the sake of the magnetic observations. An estimate 
was submitted to him amounting to £100,000 if the expedition lasted 
for thnn^ years, or £90,000 if for two years. It was decided that the 
expedition should be for two years. Mr. Balfour promised a parlia- 
mentary grant which amounted to £45,000, The public subscribed 
the other moiety, this society giving £S,000. The Biscoveri/ was 
launched, and has proved most admirably adapted for the work. It 
has been said that she is the most expensive vessel that was ever built 
in this country for scientific purposes. It is equally true that she js 
the cheapest. For she is the only vessel that was ever built in this

countiT for scdentific purposes. She has been a great success, and she 
will be a great success even if she has to be abandoned in the antarctic 
ice. The famous voyage performed in her, the vast and important 
scientific results achieved through her means, will remain forever as 
the record of her success, even though the staunch old Dheovery leaves 
her ribs in the far south. But this will not l)e if human help, guided 
b}' no ordinary ability and skill, can avail. For if the ship is strong 
and adapted to her work, still stronger and still better are her crew. 
No more striking proof of this is needed than the way they have ral- 
lied round their beloved commander. Captain Scott's deeds speak for 
themselves, and he was supported by such officers as Armitage, Royds, 
Skelton, Shackleton, and Barne; by Koettlitz, ^^'ilson, Bernacchi, 
Hodgson, and Ferrar; and })y 26 seamen and marines, all good men 
and true. Alas that one of the best of all, the devoted and chivalrous 
Shackleton, is no longer with them! The Admiralty has lent the men, 
without whom the work could not have been done; out we nuist alwa^^s 
remember that we owe this to the good offices of our lamented asso- 
ciate, Admiral Sir Anthony Hoskins. We owe much more to his 
memory than even that. 

One word with regard to the management of the business of the 
expedition. Since December, 1900, a joint finance committee, 
appointed My the councils of the two societies, of which I have been 
chairman, has transacted all the l)usiness. The three other members 
are the treasurers of the two societies and a distinguished official of 
the treasury appointed with the approval of Mr. Balfour; these three 
business men have conducted the affairs of the expedition on business 
principles. Efficiency has been secured without waste or extravagance, 
and most especial care was taken with regard to the examination of the 
provisions by an expert under official supervision. The committee 
has worked and is still working harmonioush', and there has scarcely 
been a difference of opinion among its members. As a test of its 
business capacity, we have the fact that the expedition is well within 
the estimate, and that the committee had a balance of £'7,000 to meet 
all further expenditure, if the two ships had returned this year in 
accordance with the instructions. Captain Scott sat on the committee 
from its conunencement until the departure of the Dheovery. 

Under such auspices the expedition left New Zealand on Christmas 
eve, 1901, and entered the antarctic ice. Her objects were to study 
the nature of Ross's great ice barrier; if possible, to discover land to 
the eastward; to secure various scientific results during the voj^age 
and in winter quarters; and from winter quarters to explore the 
^'olcanic region, and to make discoveries to the south and inland to the 
west. Most thoroughly and complete!}' have the explorers carried 
out these instructions. Their deeds have far exceeded all that I had 
hoped or even conceived possible. Let us now follow their proceed- 



THE NATIONAL ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 461 

ings. and endeavor to get some notion of their s'urroiindingjs witli the 
help of Mr. Skelton's photographs. 

On reaching safe winter quarters, the great work of .sledge traveling- 
was commenced with some autumn journeys. The severity of the 
weather was intense, both from low temperature — 42" to even 57° 
below zero — and from the furious gales; but the journe3^s were of 
great use, both for obtaining information respecting the lay of the 
land and for the acquisition of experience. There was one fatal acci- 
dent, which is admiral)ly described l)y Captain Scott: 

Mr. Barne reacheil the crest of the hills at about noon on JMarch 11, and camped 
for lunch, during which meal the wind sprang up very suddenly, bringing a heavy 
drift; the temperature fell, and the party, not experienced in sucli conditions, suffered 
much from frostbites and general discomfort. In these circumstances, and imagining 
themselves closer to the ship than they actually were, they decided to leave the 
sledges and make for her. Soon after their start the gale increased, and they were 
enveloped in a whirl of drifting snow and entirely lost their bearings. Mr. Barne 
did his best to keep the party together, the more so when when it became evident 
that the slope on which they stood was affording a less and less secure foothold. 
Before long, however, one of the men, Evans, slipped and disappeared from sight. 
After shouting and receiving no reply, Mr. Barne, cautioning the men to remain 
where they were, decided to follow, and very deliberately started to slide down the 
slope himself. He was firmly under the impression that the slope was one well 
known to us all close to the ship, and that after making certain he would be easily able 
to regain the summit and bring the men on. After waiting for some time another of 
the men (Quartly) decided to follow Mr. Barne and was immediately lost to sight. 
The experience of these three was identical; after the first start they were soon going 
at a speed which left them absolutely no control of their movements, and this con- 
tinued for some 4€0 or 500 yards, until they were suddenly brought up in a patch of 
soft snow within 15 feet of a sheer drop into the sea. 

Meanwhile, of the party above, one. Hare, had decided to go back to the sledge to 
change his footgear, and the remaining five, after a long wait, proceeded along the 
slope, as they supposed, toward the shii), led by an able seaman (Wild). Luckily, 
Wild had nails in his boots, for, after traveling some distance, he suddenly and 
without warning (so thick was the snow) found himself within an ace of stepping 
over the cliff into the sea. He had the presence of mind to shout to the others to 
stop, which they were all able to do except poor Yince, who missed his footing, shot 
past Wild, and was immediately lost to view. Yince was a thoroughly good man, 
always cheerful and bright, and popular throughout the ship. With great difficulty 
the remaining four men succeeded in retracing their steps, and eventually reached 
the crest of the hill, from whence, taking a more easterly course, they fell on some 
landmarks and found their way to the ship. Great credit is due to Wild for the 
manner in which he conducted and kept together the small jiarty. 

A large search i)arty was immediately dispatched on their return to the ship, and 
the siren was kept going. With some difficulty the searcFi party succ-eede<l in find- 
ing the sledges, and in the vicinity they found Mr. Barne, Evans, and Quartly half 
frozen and wholly dazed; they did not know how they had again reached the sum- 
mit of the hill. No trace was found of Hare or Yince. A further prolonged search 
was made on the following day, a roped party descending the slope with crampons, 
but without result. On the third day I got up steani on the bare possibility of find- 
ing an ice-foot below the ice cliff over which Yinc^e had fallen, and while we were 
preparing to weigh Hare was seen descending the hill oi)pi>site the ship. He was 



402 THE NATTOIS^AL ANTAEOTIC EXPEDITION. 

quickly brought on Ijoard, and found to be neither frost-bitten nor in any way hurt 
by his exposure; he had turned to tin<l the sledges, failed to do so, wandered aim- 
lessly aVjout, and finally lost consciousness; thirty-six hours later he awoke, to find 
himself buried in snow and only a trifle stiff. He imagined it to be the morning after 
the accident, and was astounded to learn that he had slept through a whole day. 

On taking the ship around to the scene of the accident we found an ice-foot, and 
it was evident that Vince must have fallen directly into the sea from a cliff 150 to 
203 feet in height. 

When Captain Scott addressed the ship's company in a few words 
after service on the following Sunday, there was scarcely a dr}'^ eye. 
All mourned the loss of their comrade, George Vince, a cheerful and 
popular messmate and an excellent seaman. 

The winter passed cheerfully. There were plenty of anuisements, 
but there was also plenty of hard work. Mr. Bernacchi tended his 
magnetic instruments with zealous care, and took regular observations 
with the electrometer. The temperature and sahnity of sea water at 
various depths were ascertained. Mr. Hodgson was indefatigable in 
all weathers, keeping holes open in the ice for his nets and lish traps. 
Doctor Wilson's work, as regards vertebrates, is exceedingly valuable, 
and I am assured that the biological collections are most important 
and will form one of the great features of the expedition. The 
meteorology is luider the charge of Lieutenant Boyds, and nothing can 
exceed his care and diligence. A series of meteorological observations 
for two years in 77-^ 50' S., more than 500 miles farther south than 
any ship has ever wintered before, will be most valuable. 

As the sun began to return, the magnificent range of mountains to 
the westward began to appear in surpassing grandeur. The glow of 
the sun when it was still below the horizon just caught them, and the 
sides facing the north were lit up with a pinkisli-orange tint, the other 
sides being dark and shadowy. In September the eiiv\y spring travel- 
ing commenced, when the cold was even more intense than in the 
autunm. Koyds and Skelton were the chief explorers of the volcanic 
island on which Erebus and Terror rear their giant cones. With four 
men they were away twenty-one da3's, with the thermometer always 
— 4:0'", and once as low as — 5S^. This cold is too intense for sledg-- 
ing, and in addition they encountered a furious gale, which lasted for 
five days. In spite of the weather, Skelton and two men found a wa}^ 
over the big ice ridges of the barrier down to the sea edge, using 
crampons and ice axes, and being roped together. A close examina- 
tion was thus made of the position where the barrier abuts upon the 
land at Cape Crozier. In a subsequent journey Royds found the post 
cairn at this point and deposited a notice for the relief ship. 

There were several sledging journeys for short distances conducted 
by the scientific staff, chietl v with the object of geological investiga- 
tions, hut the great results were to be obtained from the southern and 
western parties. 



THE NATIONAL ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 463 

Captain Scott established a depot 60 miles to the south in a journe}^ 
of ten days, from Septeml)er 23 to October 4, when there was a heavy 
gale, and the thermometer fell to —51^. On November 1 he started 
with 18 dogs, accompanied by Lieutenant Shackleton and Doctor 
Wilson, A supporting sledge under Lieutenant Barne went as far as 
the first depot. At first all went well, but after a fortnight- the dogs 
got weaker and weaker, and a long tract of soft snow had to be 
crossed, which occupied them for thirty days, bringing the sledges up 
in relays. Practically the dogs l)ecame useless. The explorers had to 
do all the work themselves. But, nothing daunted, the gallant men 
pushed onward, lightening the weight by leaving a depot in SO"^ 30' S. 

They reached 82° 17' S. On their return Lieutenant Shackleton 
broke a blood vessel, and was only just able, owing to his extraor- 
dinary pluck, to keep up with the sledge; while Scott and Wilson, 
suffering from snow-blindness and hunger, dragged the sledge back, 
240 pounds each, and reached the ship on February 4, after an absence 
of ninety-four da3"s. 

I calculate that they nuist have gone over 981 statute miles. The 
storv will be told by Scott himself — a story of heroic perseverance 
to obtain great results; a story which is unmatched in polar annals. 
It will tell us, too, of new geographical facts and deductions of intense 
interest; of a new and hitherto unknown world in the far south, 
reached with such extreme difficulty — 

Yet even liere Britannia's flag has thrown 

Her shadow on the iee, and hailed the land her own. 

The achievement of the great western party, dragging sledges over 
mountains and glaciers, with such leaders as Armitage and Shackleton, 
is only second to Scott's memorable journey. They were dragging 
240 pounds per man; first over 29 miles of sea ice, and then for 19 
-miles up a snow-filled valley to the foot of the moimtains. They also 
had to work Iw relays. Crampons, blocks and tackles, ice axes, and 
crowbars w^ere needed; and so they climl)ed the ice slopes with loaded 
sledges, and traveled many miles over bare blue glacier amidst mag- 
nificent scener}^, reaching an elevation of 9,000 feet, at a distance of 
142 statute miles inland from the ship as the crow flies. They were 
fifty-three da3'S away. 

The loss of the dogs was felt as a great calamity, because each dog 
was given in charge to a man, who became much attached to it. There 
are, however, several puppies. 

Another calamity was the loss of all the boats, which during the 
winter got frozen into a mass of solid ice. After hacking at this ice 
for months, it was found impossible to extricate the boats. 

But now all the traveling parties had returned, and the longed-for 
relief ship Morning hove in sight on the 23d of last -lanuarv. 



464 THE NATIONAL ANTAKOTIC EXPEDITION. 

The meeting is acquainted -svith the history of the relief ship; how 
she was bought, fitted out, ec^uipped, and dispatched last year by the 
Geographical Society, with funds subscribed ahuost entirel}^ by our 
fellows. We all know the great dangers of polar navigation, and that 
a ship in those regions may be in need of succor after the first 
winter. Consequently, annual comnumication has been the rule with 
all government expeditions since the Franklin disaster. We were 
bound to follow this example, and the necessitv for our action has 
since been proved. 

The MoriuiKj, iitted up with provisions, including a good supply of 
frozen meat, and coals for the Discovrry^ left Lyttelton, New Zealand, 
on December (>, and crossed the Antarctic Circle on Christmas Day. 
She is conunanded ])y Captain Colbeck, a very able and capable ice 
navigator, who has under him zealous officers and a good crew. In 
about ()7'-^ 40' S. an interesting discovery was made of a new island, 
of which several excellent photographs were taken. A landing was 
efiected and a survey was made; it was named Scott Island. 

Outside the pack the Morning encountered a heavy southeast gale, 
bergs and heavy iioe pieces being a source of continual danger, and the 
ship was subjected to a most severe straining. At one time she could 
show no canvas. The season was very late and the navigation difh- 
cult. But Captain Colbeck followed up his clew, found the record at 
Cape Crozier, and finally sighted the Discoveries masts. 

It was found that several miles of ice intervened betw^een the two 
ships, and it was not long before it became clear that the ice was not 
likely to move during that season. All hands at once went to work 
to transfer stores and provisions on sledges, and before it became 
necessary to depart the Morning had supplied 14 tons of stores and 
provisions and 20 ton^ of coal. But there was barely time. 

The arrival of the Morning was most providential, but she leaves 
the Discovery with oidy provisions to last until next January, and 80 
tons of coal. 

In returning, the Morning was in some danger of being detained. 
She was beset, but was saved by her skillful ice navigation, aided by a 
strong southwesterly gale. Her detention would have been a terrible 
calamity. She, however, returned safely to L^^ttelton, New Zealand, 
last March. 

Captain Colbeck deserves high commendation for the skill and ability 
with which he conducted a very arduous and difficult voyage; for his 
excellent judgment in finding the winter quarters of the J9/.sror</y, his 
rapid transfer of stores, and the seamanlike qualities which enabled 
him to work his vessel safely out of the ice under circumstances of no 
ordinary difficulty. The officers worked under him with zeal and 
intelligence, and the conduct of the men was excellent throughout the 
voyage. 



THE NATIONAL ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 465 

Jt will be seen that a .second voyage of the M(>rnin<j is al^sokitely 
necessary for the safety of our gallant countr3'men . There are 37 souls 
in the Antarctic ice, consisting of 5 naval officers, 1 officer of the naA'al 
reserve, 5 members of the scientific staff, 24 naval seamen and marines, 
and 2 other good men. We have a balance of £7,000. Only a small 
additional sum is needed, namely, £'12,000. Without it those heroes 
who have done so much for science and their country's credit will be 
in grave peril. 

We must provide for wages for ])oth ships ; we must send out the 
means of blasting and forcing the Discovery owi of her icy prison ; we 
must repair the Morning^ so terribl}" strained and knocked about ; we 
must store her with coal and provisions. 

There are difficulties and dangers yet, but the chief dangers are 
financial. Our gallant Colbeck and his people avIU overcome the rest. 
Meanwhile, the heroic Discoverers are still working for us at their 
numerous observations under increasing hardships caused by the small 
stock of coal. They have full faith in us, and that the needful fuAds 
will be found by us. Look once more at your maps. Look at their 
discoveries. Do not these men deserve well of their country % Will 
not their country recognize their services? I feel sure that it will, 
and that we shall yet welcome them all here after one of the most 
successfvil and glorious achievements that have ever adorned our 
geographical annals. 

Note on the Antarctic Sketch-map. — As the complete charts showing the results 
of the surveys made by Captain .Scott and the officers serving under him have not 
yet been received, the map of the Antarctic regions which accompanies this paper 
must be considered as only provisional. It has been prepared from all the informa- 
tion at present available, including the rei)ort which Captain Scott has addressed to 
the presidents of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society. A rough 
sketch of the winter quarters of the Discovery by Lieutenant Barne, and another of 
Erebus and Terror Island by Lieutenant Royds, have furnished the basis for the 
enlarged inset plan, but the remainder of the new work has been drawn from letters

liminary chart on a small scale, by Lieutenant Evans and sent home bj' Captain 
Colbeck. Lieutenant Shackleton has, since his return, looked over a proof of the 
map and made several corrections, but until the complete charts, based upon 
numerous observations and careful surveys, arrive, it is, of course, impossible to 
give anything more than an approximate idea of the geographical work of the 
expedition. Upon the present map the newly discovered land is shown in red, 
while the remainder of the coast line has been principally taken from the Admiralty 
charts and other material.

THE SWEDISH ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION « 



By Otto Nordenskiold and Others. 



I. Summary of Events. 

By tlie Editor of Titk Geographical Journal. 

We print below a summary of the scientific results of the Swedish 
Antarctic Expedition of 1902-3, kindly communicated to us b}^ Doctor 
Nordenskiold. It is necessary, however, to preface this by an outline 
of the course of the expedition from the time when the Antarctic 
steamed north, on February 21, 1902, after leaving the leader and his 
five companions in the inhospitable neighborhood of Snow Hill, on 
the eastern side of the northward-pointing- land mass known as Louis 
Philippe Land. The first business which engaged the attention of the 
explorers was the erection of houses and observatories, after which an 
attem])t was made to explore the neighborhood by means of a boat 
excursion. It was soon found that the season was too far advanced 
for work of the kind, the movements of the pack placing the boat in 
frequent danger. Enough was done to show that Seymour Island, as 
well as that on which the winter station had been established, was 
divided from the mainland by a channel representing the supposed 
Admiralty Inlet; but further exploration had to be postponed until 
the sea should once more be frozen over. The terrific gales experi- 
enced during the winter and the work done during that trying period 
ai'c spoken of in Doctor NordenskioUVs paper, and we may therefore 
pass on to the first important sledge expedition, which was l)egun on 
September 3o. the leader being accompanied by I^ieutenant Sobral 
and the sailor fJonasen. Of the two sledges taken, one only could ttc 
pulled by the dogs, the numbers of which had sadly diminished l)y 
this time. Progress was therefore somewhat slow. It soon proved 
that the outer fringe of islands was ))acked by a continuous mainland, 
connecting Louis Pliilip])(' Land with King Oscar Land farther south. 
The space between the islands was occupied by ice plains, terminating 
in a precipitous ice wall, and apparentl}' resembling the surface of

Ross's famous barrior in the vicinity of Victoria Land. The surface 
was generally smooth, ])ut, as was found In^ the British explorers in 
the opposite hemisphere, the approach to the land was barred by 
formidable crevasses, rendering it impossible to obtain seal meat for 
the dogs, so that it became necessary to begin the return journe.y on 
October 21, or earlier than had been anticipated, the station being 
again reached on November 4. 

During the summer the gales ceased almost entirely, and little 
change in the ice occurred, this being the reason for the failure of 
the Antarctic to reach the station to take home the explorers. The 
second winter which they were thus forced to spend at the station 
proved far better than the former as regards the gales experienced, 
but the renewal of sledge expeditions, apart from some minor trips, 
was again reserved for the spring. On September 29, Doctor Norden- 
skiold started, with the sailor Jonasen as his only companion, intend- 
ing to examine the channels northward in the direction of Erebus (rulf. 
This was reached on October 12, when the explorers unexpectedly met 
with Doctor Andersson and Lieutenant Duse, who had spent the winter 
in that locality without any suitable ecpnpment, having left the Ant- 
arctic at the end of 1902, in order to try to reach the winter station 
overland. They had since heard nothing of the ship. Returning in 
company to the winter station, they arrived in time to greet the 
jippearance of the Argentine gunboat Uruguay (Captain Irizar), which 
arrived on November 8, still without news of the Antarctic. The 
very same night their fears for the safety of the crew were set at rest 
by the arrival of Captain Larson and four men, who had made their 
way from the spot where the crew had wintered after the loss of the 
ship, the fate of which was thus for the first time made known to the 
other parties. The catastrophe had occurred when the Antarctic was 
about 20 miles south from Dundee Island, the ship having been 
crushed by the ice pressure caused b}^ a violent gale on January 10, 
and finally abandoned on February 12, the crew making their wa}' 
amid great difficulties to Paulet Island. The various parties being 
happily reunited on the arrival of the Uruguay at the last-named 
island on November 11, the homeward voyage was commenced. 

IL Scientific Work at the Winter Station. 
By Dr. Otto Nordenskiold. 

We arrived at the place selected for our winter station, at the foot 
of Snow Hill, in Admiralty Inlet, on February 12, 1902, and on Feb- 
ruary 21 our ship, the Antarctic, finally left us, not for some months, 
as we expected, but never to return. The members of the winter 
party, besides myself, were Doctor Bodman, meteorologist and magne- 
tician; Doctor Ekelof, physician and bacteriologist; Lieutenant Sobral,

of the Argentine navy, assistant meteorologist, and two sailors. As 
soon as possible the observations were started, and the scientitic work 
was carried on without interruption until November 8, 1903, the day 
of the arrival of the Argentine relief expedition, commanded by 
Captain Irizar. 

In the preliminary plan of the expedition the meteorological obser- 
vations are entered as one of the most important parts of our work. 
But it is not only their intrinsic interest that makes me, in tr3dng to 
give a general view of the ph3'sical geography of the region, begin 
with a discussion of our meteorological observations. In fact, not onh^ 
is the climate of that region of specially great geographical importance, 
but there are some rather unexpected features that seem to lend that 
section of our results a peculiar interest. 

The principal meteorological features of the region appear in the 
following table, communicated by Doctor Bodman, and comprising the 
approximate monthl}' means of temperature, barometic pressure, and 
velocity of the wind:

The minimum for the whole time was in August, 1902, —42.16°; 
the maximum in the same month of August, 1903, 48.74°. 

As other meteorological questions will soon be discussed more 
extensively by Doctor Bodman, I here restrict myself to those most 
important for the climate, viz, the temperature and the velocity of the 
wind. Tlu; first thing shown by this tabl(> is the unexpectedly low 
mean temperature. According to approximate calculations of our 
astronomical observations, the situation of the winter station was in 
64° 22' south and 57° west. The nearest places where meteorolog- 
ical observ^ations have been carried out during a time of sufficient 
length are at Cape Horn and in the region where the Brh/ica wintered, 
and from the results thus obtained we might have expected to find 



470 THE SWEDISH ANTAECTIC EXPEDITION". 

here a vearh' mean of about 20 or 25^ Fahrenheit. Instead of this 
we obtained for the lirst jeav +10.04'^ Fahrenheit. Though it is 
possible that this temperature is somewhat lower than general, as the 
summer was undoubtedly exceptionalh' cold, and even the mean for 
the eight colder months (March-October) was in the first year 2.3^ 
Fahrenheit, but in the second 4", it does not seem probable that the 
difference from that general mean temperature should l)e even so great 
as between the two winters. A mean temperature of 10- Fahrenheit 
at the same distance from the pole is in the northern hemisphere found 
in the environs of Hudson Strait, and in Siberia, in the region of 
Yakutsk, still one or two degrees farther south. In both cases we 
see the influence of the extremely low winter temperatures of a con- 
tinental climate, while for a thoroughly marine climate the tempera- 
ture is unexpectedly low. It must be left to the discussion of the 
observations of the other expeditions contemporaneous with ours, 
including the Scotia expedition, to discover whether there exists an 
especiall}" cold area on the east coast of Graham Land, or even south 
of the Atlantic Ocean. 

The difference in temperature ])etween summer and winter is, of 
course, not so great as in the regions mentioned, and, notwithstanding 
that the temperature of the three winter months was during the two 
years as low as —4"^' Fahrenheit, the winter could not be called very 
cold if it was not for the wind. The great violence of the wind in all 
antarctic regions is a well-known fact, but I doul)t if a violence such 
as that during our first winter has ever been experienced in an arctic 
or antarctic climate, itnd even the average for the whole time nuist 
])e considered unexpectedly high." However, the table shows that 
the dift'erences between difierent seasons, and also between different 
years, are very great. 

The factor that really determines the climate is the direction of the 
wdnd. The situation of the station, on the shore of a strait, may par- 
tially account for the predominance of the winds from the southwest 
and northeast quadrants. Besides this, there is a high percentage of 
calm, or nearly calm, weather. The southwest winds are by far the 
most common and the strongest, and because they are also the coldest 
all the really bad weather is to be ascribed to them. The calm hours 
are not much warmer, but of course their influence on the general 
feeling is al)Solutely difl'erent. The real northeast winds are compar- 
atively strong and cold; but, besides them, there is another class of 
winds which are, if not as common as the others, still exceedingly 
characteristic of the climate. They are the winds from north or even 
north-northwest, and when once started they are very strong and very

by the Borchgrevink expedition (preliminary), the mean being considerably lower 
than ours. 



THE SWEDISH ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 471 

long- continued, and bring the wtirniest weather. It is these differences 
thatbringoutanotheroharacteristic of the climate — its great variability. 
The variations from day to day are in winter time greater, as in most 
other regions of the world, and, as far as our short experience goes, 
it is quite probable that this also holds good from year to year. 
Though the mean temperature of these two winters is nearly the same, 
the difference between the two is very great. In the first year the 
southwest storms were absolutely overwhelming, alternating wnth 
periods of calm, warmer weather. In the second year the calm periods 
were generally colder, and, at least during the first part of the winter, 
very common and long continued, and to this cause during the second 
half were due long periods of warm northerly Avinds. 

In the closest connection with that state of the weather stand the ice 
conditions. After the winter of 1902, with its southwest storms, came 
a summer that was not only the coldest hitherto known in an}- region 
of the world, but also, and that to our l)ad luck, marked by an accu- 
nudation of ice such as never has been seen in that region. It was in 
the l)attle with that ice that the Antarctic was lost, but it nmy be said 
that we on the station had really no reason for uneasiness, as never, 
except perhaps for two or three days, was the sea in our neighborhood 
so free from ice as to render the arrival of the ship probable. On the 
other hand, even in the middle of the winter, the north and northwest 
winds would cause large openings in the ice, and after the strong gales 
in August to October, 1903, the second summer started with an almost 
clear sea, and probably this year is of the same type as the summer of 
1893-1, when Larsen made his well-known voyage south. 

During our stay 1 brought together rich material from investiga- 
tions on the ice, both sea ice and land ice, and especially that typical 
Antarctic ice cap of Snow Hill — its temperature compared with that of 
the sea ice and the soil, its movement, surface structure, and stratifica- 
tion. Interesting is the great accumulation of snow during the sum- 
mer 1902-3, which is important for explaining the formation of such 
ice caps and their great extension in those regions; a few 3-ears such 
as this would Cover the whole region with snow. 

Because of this accumulation the land ice forms at all seasons an easy 
traveling road, and only where there are large crevasses it might be 
difficult to pass in summer time. On the contrary, just as in the north, 
so also here the sea ice js during the summer to a great extent covered 
l)y water, making the traveling very difficult. But even if this had 
not been the case we could not have used the first summer for distant 
sledge traveling, as we had then to wait for the return of the Antcwctic, 
and later to provide ourselves with the supplies necessar}' for another 
wintering. All sledge work, therefore, was mainly during the two 
springs. Its results have been the survey of the coast with its outly- 
ing islands from the end of Louis Philippe Land to our southernmost

point in 66'^ south, 62 we.st. The accompanyino- rough .slvetcli-nmp, 
compiled l\y Lieutenant Diise, gives an idea of the general geography 
of the region rather ditferent from older maps. As a matter of fact, 
the whole mainland from Louis Philippe Land past King Oscar Land 
forms a narrow strip of high mountainous land, the continuation of 
Graham Land. Farther on in the same direction, Joinville Island 
seems really an archipelago of islands. East of the mainland we find 
two other island groups, divided by the wide gulf extending between 
Snow Hill and Ko))ertson Island. 

The northern archipelago is divided from the mainland ])y a broad 
channel studded with islands. It consists of two groups, divided by 
Admiralty Sound, with its two islands, Cockburn and Lockyer. 
Inside of this strait the principal mass of land is divided by a narrow 
winding channel into two large islands, the largest of which, with 
Moiait Haddington for its highest point, I propose to call, after its 
discoverer, James Ross Island. Though in cold summers the ice in 
those channels and straits does not break up, it is probable that there 
is in other years much open water. 

Ver\^ different is the aspect of the southern ""archipelago.'' No 
real islands exist here; even the mildest summer will not melt away 
the ice so as to allow a boat to come round any of the islands. All 
visible land consists of nunataks rising' out of a high, extensive mass 
of ice. Still, 1 believe it is very probable that should once there come 
a change to a warmer climate, then the ice would be found to rest for 
a great part in a shallow sea, and not only on the land, forming in 
reality a connection between the mainland and a group of outlying 
islands. The mainland, so far as known, is composed of crystalline 
rocks, mostly granites, and also porphja'ies, and, as shown by Doctor 
Andersson, though perhaps to a less extent, of folded sedimentary 
rocks of pre-Cretaceous age. On the contrary, in all parts of the 
eastern archipelago, j^oung volcanic rocks are in predominance, while 
granitoid rocks are entirely wanting. What is found is mostly basalt, 
and to a great extent tufaceous rocks, sometimes belonging to types 
of great petrographical interest. I need not state that, as a conse- 
quence of this geological difference, the mountain forms and the whole 
aspect of the country show very marked contrasts. 

Among the southern nunataks I have only observed volcanic rocks. 
Besides those, there occurs in the northern region, around our station, 
another far more interesting series of rocks. Those are the f ossilifer- 
ous sedimentary rocks, generally sandstones, that are to be found 
cropping out at the foot of the hills below the volcanic series in most 
parts of Ross Island, and also on Cockburn Island, and which form 
the whole of the two large outlying islands, Snow Hill and Seymour 
islands. The study of those rocks and their fossils will be of great 
interest for the knowledge of the conditions of those regions in former 



THP] SWEDISH ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 473 

times, tliouoh it is, of course, impossible at this time to go further 
into the matter. The whole formation is generally very rich in rather 
well-preserved fossils, belonging to numerous groups of marine forms. 
In the lower part ammonites are common, and the age nuist be con- 
sidered as Mesozoic; higher up those are wanting, and it is not 
improbable that the strata here pass into the Tertiary. 

It is in those upper strata that 1 found numerous plant remains, and 
also remains of some vertebrate animals, showing not only that in a 
period geologically not very distant, land has existed in this region, 
but also that the climate was at that time mild, and the land covered 
by vegetation and inhabited b}^ animals. There is in all this, in the 
whole configuration of the country as well as in its geology, a very 
marked analogy to Patagonia, and further studies may prove the 
resemblance to be still greater. Even the inner channels are interest- 
ing, because of their analogy with the great plains and the lakes on 
the eastern side of the Cordillera. But it seems undeniable that there 
are great diiierences in the structure of the southern Cordillera and the 
Antarctic mountain chain, and more investigation is necessary to deter- 
mine whether it is possible to consider this part of Antarctica as a con- 
tinuation of the South American continent or not. 

Of our other investigations I will here only mention the bacterio- 
logical work. Just as in the Arctic regions, bacteria are also here 
scarce; but Doctor Ekelof has made the interesting observation that 
in the upper layers of the soil there is to be found a comparatively 
rich flora. 

Our studies came to rather an abrupt end with the arrival of the 
Argentina relief expedition, as we thought we had reasons to expect 
that we should have a good deal of the summer at our disposal. Still, 
the time has been long, and undoubtedl}^ it has been an advantage that 
the scientific work could be continued two years instead of one. 

III. TH^: Scientific Operations on Board the Antarctic in 
THE Summer 1902-1903. 

By Dr. .1. Giinnak Andersson. 

On November 5, 19o2, the Antarctic left Ushuaia for the south. 
The ship had been thoroughly equipped for the coming cruise in the 
Antarctic sea: a full supply of coal was taken on board, together with 
some additional provisions in case of having to winter. A plan for a 
relief expedition was sent to Sweden and to the Scandinavian general 
consulate in Buenos Ayres. 

As I had been told that coal iiad been recent!}' discovered in Teke- 
nikaBay, in the southei-n part of the Fuegian Archipelago, I so arranged 
our route southward that we stoi)})ed two days in this bay to survey 
the coal-bearing formation. This led to an unexpected result. Instead 



474 THE SWEDISH ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 

of what I had expected to meet here, an isolated patch — like that in 
Slog-get Bay — of theTertiaiy formation, with plant fo.ssils and lignite, 
which is widely distributed in northern Tierra del Fuego, and, in my 
opinion, more recent than the folding period of the Fuegian cordillera, 
1 found a strongly folded sedimentary' series, chiefly a conglomerate, 
with marine shells and trunks of driftwood. The sedimentary beds 
were traversed by eruptive dikes. Unfortunate!}' nn' collections from 
this place were lost with the Antarctic. For this reason I can not give 
any definite opinion as to the age of the sedimentary beds nor the 
petrological character of the eruptions traversing" them. Moreover, 
1 have decided to return to Tekenika Bay to survey in detail this 
locality', as it will evidenth' contribute to deciding the unsettled age 
of the Fuegian cordillera. 

Late in the evening of November 7 the Antarctic crossed the latitude 
of Cape Horn to the west of Hermit Island, and in the night of the i>th 
to loth of the same month, in latitude 59^ 30' south, longitude G6^ west, 
we passed the first water-worn floes of drift sea ice, the first iceberg 
having been sighted the previous day. As soon as we had entered the 
region of drift ice, 1 started regular observations on the frequency and 
size of sea ice and icebergs. These running observations were carried 
on by me up to my departure from the ship on December 29, and tifter 
that they were continued b}^ Mr. Skottsberg. 

On November 11-12 we met the dense pack in latitude 61' south, 
and only after ten days' hard work did Captain Larsen force a wav to 
the open coast water outside the South Shetland Islands. Between 
Smith Island and Snow Island we entered Bransfield Strait, practicalh' 
free from ice. November 23-24 we visited Deception Island, but 
found its crater covered by unbroken ice. From here we steered for 
the eastern end of Livingstone Island, where a short landing was made. 
During all this time the weather was fine and clear. On the opposite 
side of the broad strait we distinctl}' sighted the snow- clad plateaus 
and lofty peaks round the Orleans channel — the old Trinitv Land. 
But nothing was to be seen of Middle Island, which is marked on the 
charts as situated in the middle of the strait between McFarlane Sound 
and Astrolabe Island; on the following day (25th) we crossed the 
position of the nonexisting island, and here dropped the lead in 800 
fathoms. On the previous day, in a sounding between Deception and 
Livingstone islands, in 534 fathoms depth, we had found a remarkabh' 
low-bottom temperature of 29*^ Fahrenheit. An examination of the 
intermediate depths at the sounding station of Middle Island, gave 
the result that Bransfield Strait repeats the typical hydrographical 
condition of all ice-bearing parts of the ocean — a superficial layer and 
a deep-water mass, both characterized b}' low temperature, and 
between them a body of relatively warm water. But this section 
shows two remarkable features; the intermediate warm current is 



THE SWEDISH ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 475 

here faintly developed, and in consequence a veiy large part of the 
section is occupied by the bottom water, the temperature of which is 
only 29.66^ to 29° Fahrenheit, the latter at the bottom itself. This 
bottom temperature is somewhat below the minimum deep temperature 
hitherto observed in the ocean (the Norwegian Sea, bottom tempera- 
ture 29.3° Fahrenheit), and it is quite exceptional in the south polar 
regions, the bottom temperature of the Antarctic Ocean being about 
31° Fahrenheit. Evidently Bransfield Strait is an isolated l)asin, 
separated from the open ocean by submarine shelves, which admit only 
a very limited renewal of the warm water. Later on in the summer 
we got more sections and single soundings in Bransfield Strait. The 
maximum depth observed was 82t3 fathoms, near to Bridgeman Island. 

In January of the same year (1902), before establishing the winter 
station. Doctor Nordenskiold, with the Antarctic, made a two days' 
excursion along the coast of Graham Land southwest from Astrolabe 
Island. As a result of this visit he was convinced that here runs 
a continuous coast line, and that the Orleans channel of Dumont 
d'Urville and the Belgica (later Gerlache) Strait of the Belgian expe- 
dition form parts of the same far-extending channel. But the ques- 
tion was in some principal points unsettled, because of the difficulty 
of reaching an incontestable connection with the Belgian chart. Now, 
we had to clear it up decisively, and in the time — November 26 to 
December 5 — Lieutenant Duse carried out a surve}^ on the scale of 
1:300,000 of the region between Astrohxbe Island and Cape Murray 
(Cape Neyt of the Belgian chart). During this time the hard-working 
cartographer arranged the course of the ship so as best to suit his sur- 
vey, we other scientists taking the chances thus ofl'ered for our own 
work. At every landing that Mr. Duse made to get bearings and 
astronomical observations he was followed by the botanist and the 
geologist; Mr. K. A. Andersson, in the meantime, Avith trawlings 
from the ship, making collections of the luxuriant marine fauna. 
These days in the Orleans channel we remember as a most happy 
time of full and profitable activit}", the only regret being that the 
larger mass of its rich collections no longer exists. 

On December .5, the survey of the Orleans Channel l)eing finished, 
we headed for the sound between the mainland and floinville Island in 
order to proceed to the winter station. Cheerfully we spoke of the 
approaching meeting with Nordenskiokl and his comrades, and prepa- 
rations were made for their reception on l)oard, ])ut ev(Mits turned out 
far otherwise than we expected and man}^ a lonely day had to pass 
before we reached our friends on Snow Hill. The sound inside Join- 
ville Island we always found filled with heav}^, hummocky drift ice; 
and Erebus and Terror Gulf, as far as we could sight it from the sound, 
looked like a dazzling white plain without a single space of open water 



476 THE SWEDISH ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 

visible. Here all efforts to penetrate the pack would eviclenth' be use- 
less, at least for the next few weeks, and Captain Larsen determined to 
tr}^ outside of Joinville Island. On the northern coast of this island 
we again met the edge of the dense pack, which Ave followed in a 
northerly direction, eagerly looking for an opening to the east and 
south. South from the Elephant Islands the Antarctic got caught l)y 
the ice and drifted with it in a northeasterly direction. On December 
15 (latitude 01-^ 35' south, longitude 53° west) we had drifted outside 
the Bransfield basin, as w^as proved ])y a sounding at 892 fathoms, a 
bottom temperature of 31.28" F., the normal deep temperature of 
the open Antarctic Ocean. Two days later, the ice having slackened 
so as to permit the ship moving, Captain Larsen made his way back 
westward to open water. We now returned to the sound inside 
Joinville Island, only to find the ice conditions here unaltered. The 
chances of reaching the winter station with the ship at this time 
seemed very bad, and we sought to realize a plan that had been under 
preparation during the last two weeks. On December 29 Mr. Duse, 
Sailor Grunden, and I were landed on the west side of the sound to

The movements of the Antarct'tc from this day to the tinal disaster will 
be reported l)y another hand." The only thing that remains to tell 
here is the fate of the scientific materials on board at this time. 

The most valuable part of our collections of earlier times by the 
expedition had been sent home from Port Stanley and Ushuaia. 
Before we left Port Stanley the last time (September, 1902), I had left 
another large part of our collections in charge of the Colonial (lovern- 
mentand of the Falkland Island Company. All zoological, botanical, 
and geological material that could, if wanted, be worked out by foreign 
hands was deposited here. My private geological notebooks, as well 
as all the materials in charge of Mr. Duse (meteorological and hydro- 
graphical journals, cartographical material), were kept on board to be 
worked out in the course of tke voyage. We are highly indebted to 
Captain Larsen and the two scientists remaining w^ith him on board 
for saving all the notebooks, journals, etc. Only the cartographical 
material from South Georgia could not be found b}^ them, and it was 
consequently lost with the ship. The collections made on the second 
visit to Tierra del Fuego were kept on Ijoard, and the most of these, 
as well as most of the collections obtained during that last sammer\s 
work in the south, had to be left on board when the sinking ship was 
abandoned. But it is nu;ch to the credit of Messrs. K. A. Andersson 
and Skottsberg that they, in the days when the fate of the ship was 
already evident, selected the most valuable, portable parts of their 
collections, which they took to Paulet Island, and thus saved them.

THE SWEDISH ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 477 

IV. The Slkdgk Expedition from the ''Antarctic."" 
By Dr. J. CtUXnar Anderssox. 

^Yben, ill the middle of December, we liad found tliat tlie impene- 
trable pack in every direction stopped the ship in its passage toward 
the winter station, I determined to try to reach Snow Hill by a sledge 
vo^^age round Erebus and Terror Gulf. Mr. Duse instantly expressed 
his desire to take part in the proposed trip, and also the third member 
wanted, Sailor T. Grunden, joined voluntarily. 

Without an}^ special equipment for sledge traveling, and starting 
along an unknown coast, we evidently entered on a rather doubtful and 
hazardous undertaking, but the situation required everything possible 
to be tried. As soon as the necessary preparations were made, we 
landed in a bay on the mainland (west) coast of the sound inside Join- 
ville Island where a depot of provisions was erected. Before the 
departure the following was agreed with Captain Larson: That (1) if 
the sledge party reached the station, we should wait there for the 
Antarctic until February 10, but after that date bring Nordenskiold 
and his comrades out to our starting point. In this case Larson had to 
pick us up at the place agreed on between February 25 and March 10. 
(2) If the Antarctic reached the station, and we did not appear there 
by January 25, Larson had to look for us at our depot. 

On the night following our landing, we started in a south-southwest 
direction across the inland ice, and on the second day we made an 
unexpected discovery. Having reached an ice shed we faced a broad 
sound with scattered islands. This sound we liad to cross to reach 
a snow-covered land Ij'ing some 22 miles distant in a southerly direc- 
tion. The sea ice was at this season in a very miserable state, covered 
with large fresh-water pools. These were getting deeper and formed 
a regular network as we approached the last-named land, which we 
reached (flanuary 3, 1903) only after a desperate wading and with all 
our etiects thoroughl}^ wet. After having climlied to the top of the 
gently sloping inland ice, we got a free view all round that cleared up 
our position. The land where we were standing formed in reality a 
large island on the north side of the water called by Sir James Ross, 
Sidney Herbert Bay, which in fact runs far inland and joins our island 
inside with the broad water that we had just passed. Sidney Herbert 
Sound was all over a l)luisli surface of water-covered ice, quite similar 
to that on which we had just had a narrow escape, and along the shores 
there were in some places broad s[)aces where the ice was entirely gone. 
As Ave could not think of crossing this sound, we could only give up 
our plan and return to the depot, which we reached on January 13. 
Here the weeks passed without the Antarctic reappearing, and in the 
middle of February we l)egan to make preparations for the chani-e that 
we might be forced to winter hero. On ]\Iarch Ki, tlie time to expect

the ship was due, and the following day our stone hut was readj' for 
use. The depot had been established only for the time until the ship 
should return, and was thus insufficient for wintering-. Some hundred 
peno'uins were killed to supply' us with fresh meat, and seal blubber 
was used as fuel. 

The winter passed without accident, but with a complete lack of 
intellectual emplo^yment. On September 29 we started again for the 
station on Snow Hill, were stopped for three da3^s in a violent snow-~ 
storm, and then went on slowly in unsettled weather. On October 12, 
traveling along the coast of the above-mentioned island, we, b}" a 
strange coincidence, unexpectedly met with Nordenskiold, who had 
reached this region through a large interior channel just then discovered 
by him. Loading our effects upon his dog sledge, we continued the 
journey pleasantly through Sidney Herbert Sound and outside Mount 
Haddington. After four daj's' traveling in splendid weather, we 
reached Snow Hill on October 16. 

Our sledge part}' was dispatched from the Antarctic to fulfill a duty 
that we failed to carr}'^ out in face of natural obstacles which we could 
not master. The scientific results of our undertaking are very limited. 
Living during the winter in a misery of dirt and darkness, and want- 
ing also the simplest instruments, we Avere unable to make an}^ kind of 
observations. Still, our time was not spent totally in vain. We 
entered a virgin area, where Duse made a survej- that forms a neces- 
sary link between his chart of the Orleans Channel and the extensive 
cartographical work executed by Nordenskiold and Duse together 
farther south on the east coast. 

In the Orleans Channel I collected some facts, adding to the evidence 
brought forward by Mr. Arytowski, and proving that the large chan- 
nel was once filled by an immense glacier moving in a northeast direc- 
tion. Near to our wintering place I found some other and veiy striking 
traces of an earlier wider extension of the glaciers. This material will 
soon be published, in combination with mj- observations from South 
Georgia, the Falkland Islands, and Tierra del Fuego. 

On the geological survey of the vicinity of the l)ay where we 
wintered, I made another noticeable find— well-preserved plant fossils, 
cycadas, conifers, and ferns, a flora of apparently Lower Mesozoic age. 
A small selection of this material was brought with us on the sledge 
to Snow Hill, but the great mass was left at our winter place, and 
afterwards picked up by the Argentine relief ship. 

Our involuntary wintering brought also a certain practical result. 
By force of circumstances, living principall}' on the products of sur- 
rounding nature, and, like Nansen and Johansen in Franz Josef Land, 
in many respects following the mode of life of the Eskimo, we, 
together with the party wintering on Paulet Island, accumulated an

experience, new for the Antarctic regions, which, when once full}^ 
described, might be of service to future explorers in distress during 
the survey of the desolate and stormy southern lands. 

To me it was of special interest to get intimate around our wintering- 
place with a nature so different from the now well-surveyed region 
round the station on Snow Hill. Instead of its unfolded table-land 
surrounded by a shallow sea, we have here a deep sound with fjord- 
like bays swarming with a rich fauna, and a land with numerous edged 
nunataks rising through the inland ice — a folded region with such a 
variet}^ of sedimentary and eruptive rocks that the lind of a rich 
Mesozoic flora is only to be regarded as a first hint of the possibilities 
of a future more extensive exploration. In the lonely winter months 
I sometimes amused myself with sketching in detail a survey of the 
geology and biology of this region- -a plan that, I hope, will not wait 
lono- for its realization. 



FOOD PLANTS OF AXCTENT AMEBIC A. « 



By O. F. Cook, 
r. *S'. Department of Agriculture. 



Agricultural science so g-enerally appears as a borrower from 
physics, chemistry, botany, or zoology that it has not been expected 
to furnish facts of use in other lines of inyestigation. Thus, although 
it has been known since the sixteenth centur}' that the same primitiye 
food plants were cultiyated throughout the tropics of both hemis- 
pheres, the signiticance of this remains unappreciated, and there is 
still doubt and speculation regarding prehistoric communication across 
the Paciiic. Alaskan land connection. Buddhist missionaries, stranded 
Japanese junks, and other possibilities of a northwestern contact haye 
been gravely and minutely discussed, while unequivocal evidence of 
tropical intercourse lay only too obviously at hand. The cultivation 
of the same seedless plants, such as the yam, sweet potato, taro, sugar 
cane, and banana l)y the primitive peoples of the islands of the Pacific, 
as well as by those of the adjacent shores of Asia and America, indi- 
cates, with attendant facts, not only an older communication but an 
intimate contact or community of origin of the agricultural civiliza- 
tions of the lands bordering upon the Pacific and Indian oceans. Con- 
crete biological data need not be disregarded because the peopling of 
America by the lost tribes of Israel and other equally fanciful con- 
jectures are discredited. 

THE CULTIVATED PLANTS OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS. 

Notwithstanding the immense distances by which the tropical islands 
of the Pacific are separated from the continents and from each other, 
European discoverers found thorn already occupied by an adventur- 
ous, sea-faring people who knew enough of the stars, trade winds, and 
currents to navigate their frail canoes in those vast expanses of ocean 
without the mariner's compass. The agiiculture of the Polynesians 
was. however, no less wonderful than tlnnr seamanship, and was cer- 
tainly not less important to them, since the coral islands of the Pacific 
are not only deficient in indigiMious plants and animals suitai)le 
for food, but the natural conditions are distinctly unfavorable to 
agriculture.

Monthly, October, 1902.

"The whole surface of these flat coral islands is like the clean white 
sanded floor of an old English kitchen. The cocoanut tree springs up 
everywhere, but in the spots where yams and taros are grown the sand 
is hollowed out and a pit formed, from 100 to 200 3'ards long and of 
varying width, into which decaying cocoanut leaves and refuse are 
thrown till a rich soil is formed."" 

"The position occupied b}' the PoljMiesian races as tillers of the soil 
has hardly had suflicient attention given to it, although it may be 
doubted whether any people ignorant of the uses of the metals ever 
advanced so far as they have done. * "^ * Let an}" one read the 
account given b}' the first visitors to New Zealand — especially Cook — 
respecting the Maori cultivations of those days — the care that was 
taken to keep them free from weeds; the labor expended in convej'- 
ing gi'avel to hill up the kumara plantations; the trouble taken to 
protect them from the strong wnnds by means of temporary screens 
or fences; the months employed in building houses (often highl}" 
carved and decorated) in which to store their crops; the amount of 
patient care and selection required in raising new varieties."^ 

The agricultural achievements of the Pol3'nesians become even more 
impressive when we reflect that so many of their cultivated species 
were not propagated from seeds but from cuttings. These must have 
been carefully packed, kept moist with fresh water, and protected 
against the salt spray, to survive the long voyages in open canoes. 
A list of 24 species of plants believed to have been brought to the 
Hawaiian Islands by prehistoric colonists is given by Hillebrand." 
This number, however, must be greatl}' increased, since there were 
many varieties of the sweet potato, taro, sugar cane, and banana. 
Moreover, the Hawaiian group is scarceh' more than subtropical in 
climate, and lacks numerous seedless sorts of the breadfruit, vam, taro, 
and other plants of the equatorial belt of islands, so that a complete 
enumeration of the species and varieties carried about by the early 
Polynesians among the islands of the Pacific would include nearl}' 100. 

There are manj' indications to be drawn from the people themselves, 
as well as from the abundance of ancient ruins, that the archipelagoes 

« Moresby, Discoveries and Surveys of New Guinea, p. 73, London, 1876. The vol- 
canic islands of Polynesia have, of course, rich soil, but they shared the deficiency 
of native food plants, so that nonagricultural 2:)eople could scarcely have secured a 
permanent food supply. 

It is certain, moreover, that among the Polynesians the cocoanut is a cultivated 
plant no less than the yam, taro, sweet potato, sugar cane, banana, breacifruit, and 
numerous other species found in use throughout the tropical islands of the Pacific. 
An especial interest attaches to the cocoanut in that there are adequate liotanical 
reasons for believing that it originated in America, the home of all related palms.

of the Pacitie were the scene of a former civilization much more 
advanced than that found by Europeans. Seamanship, like other arts, 
had declined, and communication with the remoter islands like Hawaii, 
Easter Island, and New Zealand had been interrupted for several 
centuries, perhaps as a result of an intermixture of the so-called 
Melanesians, the native black race of New Guinea and neig-hboring 
islands of the western Pacific, peoples inferior in agriculture, seaman- 
ship, and social organization. In spite of- the richer native flora of 
the Melanesian islands, no cultivated plant of importance seems to have 
been domesticated there, no species being- reported as in cultivation 
among the Papuans which is not shared with the Malays to the west 
or with the Polynesians to the east, and in nearly all cases with both. 
The primitive agriculture of all the Pacific islands ma\' be viewed, 
then, as a connected whole, and a detailed stud}- of the origins, present 
distributions, native names, agricultural methods, and domestic uses 
of the numerous species and varieties of cultivated plants may be 
expected to vield the most definite information now obtainable regard- 
ing the origins and migrations of the ancient agricultural peoples of 
the Tropics." At present we have only incomplete and scattered data 
collected incidentally by missionaries, ti'avelers, and professional bot- 
anists who did not appreciate their opportunities from the agricultural 
point of view. But even these miscellaneous facts are often of unex- 
pected interest. Thus, we know that in Central America the use of 
leguminous shade trees in cacao plantations was adopted by the Span- 
ish colonists from the natives, who furnished even the name, "mother 
of cacao," by which the species of Erythrlna and other leguminous 
shade trees are still know^n in Spanish America. The Indians, of 
course, were not aware that the roots of the leguminoste developed 
tubercles for the accommodation of bacteria able to fix atmospheric 
nitrogen in the soil, and thus increase its fertility. They believed 
that the "madre de cacao'' supplied water to the roots of the cacao, 
a fanciful idea still credited by man}^ planters, and not much improved 
upon b}' the current notion that shade of large trees is beneficial to 
cacao and coffee. In the Pacific we encounter a similar fact with ref- 
erence to the yam bean {Pachyrhizax), a leguminous vine with a fleshy 
edible root. The natives of the Tonga Islands no longer cultivate 
Pachyrhizus for food, but they nevertheless encourage its growth in 
their fallow clearings in the belief that it renders them the sooner 
capable of yielding larger crops of 3'ams. Such anticipations of the 
results of modern agricultural science are of extreme interest, Init it 
is still uncertain whether similar knowledge exists in other archipel- 
agos of the Pacific, or on the American continent where Pachyrhizus 

f'Even the cosmopolitan tropical weeds are worthy of careful study from this 
standpoint. After excluding aquatic, s\Vami)-land, and strand species, Seeman found 
64 genuine weeds in Fiji, of which 48 were common to America, while only 10 were 
held to be Old World species. 



484 FOOD PLANTS OF ANCIENT AMERICA. 

probably originated. The botanists report it as ''a common weed 
in cultivated grounds," and we learn further that, in the absence of 
better material, the people of Fiji use the liber for tish lines, and that 
the plant sometimes figures in an unexplained manner in their religious 
ceremonies, an indication of greater importance in ancient times. 

Our knowledge is far from complete regarding even the present dis- 
tribution of the principal tropical food plants, but the need of further 
investigation should not obscure the striking fact that several of the 
food plants with wdiich the Spaniards l)ecame acquainted in the West 
Indies were also staple crops on the islands and shores of the Pacific 
and Indian Oceans, and even across tropical Africa. 

How this very ancient agricultural unity of the Tropics came about 
may be unexplainable by history or tradition. ])ut it is scarcely more 
m3'sterious than that so significant a fact shoukl have l)een disregarded 
so long in studies of primitive man. Our attitude, even yet, seems to 
be that of the mediaeval Europeans, who believed with Columbus that 
the newly discovered "Indies" of the western Atlantic were the same 
as those of eastern Asia. Nearly a centur}' elapsed between the dis- 
covery of America and the realization that it was indeed a new world 
and not merely an eastern prolongation of Asia, so that the community 
of food plants in regions separated b}^ more than half the circumfer- 
ence of the globe did not at first appear remarkable. Modern geogra- 
ph}^ has proved the remoteness of the localities, but modern biology 
gives no less definite testimony that the same plant does not originate 
twice, and makes it plain that varieties dependent everywhere for their 
very existence on human care must also have been distributed by human 
agency. 

THE AGRICULTURE OF ANCIENT AMERICA. 

The most important food plants of the Poh'nesians were seven in 
number — the taro, yam", sweet potato, sugar cane, banana. ])readfruit, 
and cocoanut — of which six, or all except the breadfruit, existed in 
pre-Spanish America, and of these, five, or all except the cocoanut, 
were propagated only from cuttings. 

Except w^ith the banana, botan}^ gives us much evidence for and 
none against the New World origin of the food plants shared by 
ancient America with Polynesia and the tropics of the Old World, 

" Numerous species of true yams [Dioscorea) are cultivated, aucl the roots of many 
wild species are collected for food in various parts of the Tropics. The present refer- 
ence is to D. alata, the most widely distributed of the domesticated species and not 
known in the wild state. 

"The Haitian name of the Dioscorea alata is axes or ajcs. It is under this denomi- 
nation that Columbus describes the igname in the account of his first voyage; and it 
is also that which it had in the times of Garcilasso, Acosta, and Oviedo, who have 
very well indicated the characters by which the axes are distinguished from batates.'^ — 
Humboldt, Kingdom of New Spain, vol. 2, p. ono. Trans, by Black, New York, 
1811. 



FOOD PLANTS OF ANCIENT AMERICA. 485 

though few of them are known under conditions which warrant a 
belief that they now exist anywhere in a truly wild state. The partial 
or complete seedlessness attained b}^ several of the important species 
also indicates dependence upon human assistance in propagation for a 
very long" period of time, and precludes all rational doubt that their 
wide dissemination was accomplished through the direct agency of 
primitive man. 

Ethnologists will not deny that in the Old World this distribution 
was the work of the remote ancestors of the Polynesians, traces of 
whose presence have been found distributed over the area included 
between Hawaii, Easter Island, New Zealand, Formosa, Malaya, 
Madagascar, and even across the African continent." We have not 
been provided, however, with any explanation of the existence of 
these food plants in America, for ethnologists do not admit that the 
eastward migrations of the Pol3^nesians reached this continent, ])uthold 
that the tribes, languages, customs, and arts of the American Indians 
are of trul}" indigenous development, not imported from Asia or else- 
where, as so frequently and varioush" conjectured. 

"I maintain, therefore, in conclusion, that up to the present time 
there has not been shown a single dialect, not an art nor an institution, 
not a myth or religous rite, not a domesticated plant or animal, not a 
tool, weapon, game, or symbol, in use in America at the time of the 
discover}', which had previously been imported from Asia or from any 
continent of the Old World."* 

If this conclusion be adopted it is obvious that the food plants com- 
mon to the two hemispheres nmst have been derived from America. 
This alternative seems not to have been canvassed with the standpoint 
and methods of modern ethnology, but it is safe to saj^ that in Asia no

of the Smithsonian Institution for 1898, j^p. 637-650. 

^Brinton, D. G., in Memoirs of the International Congress of Anthropology, p. 
151, Chicago, 1894. The same arguinent has been stated somewhat less radically by 
Payne, but with no more adequate appreciation of the significance of the facts of 
tropical agriculture: 

" If advancement was at some remote time imported from the Old AVorld into the 
New, how happens it that at the discovery all the domesticated animals and nearly 
all the cultivated food plants of the Old World were either wanting or existed only 
in a wild state in the New World? * * * Pulse [the bean] was the only culti- 
vated plant common to America and the Old World. * * * Civilized immigrants 
from Asia would naturally strike the New World in British Columbia or Oregon; 
and the doctrine of imported advancement finds its most decisive refutation in the 
fact that from the most remote until recent times agriculture was here absolutely 
unknown." Payne, Hist, of the New World called America, Vol. IT, p. 340-347. 

It is iwssible that there were no Old World cultivated j)lants in America except 
the banana, which evidently arrived late. That Asiatic agriculture was not intro- 
duced into America is, however, far from j)roving that American agriculture was not 
introduced into Asia. 



486 FOOD PLANTS OF ANCIENT AMERICA. 

such arguments can be made as in America against the exotic origin 
of the earliest civilizations. It is a simple zoological fact, also f reel}" 
admitted by ethnologists, that the straight-haired Malayoid peoples 
are not the original inhabitants of southeastern Asia and the neighbor- 
ing islands, since throughout these regions there are isolated remnants 
and traces of earlier curl-haired types, such as the Negritos, Anda- 
manese, Papuans and Ainus.*^* 

If it be reasonable to suppose that the food plants which the Poly- 
nesians shared with the tropical peoples of both continents were 
carried by them across the Pacific, it is also reasonable to seek the 
origin of these widely distributed species on the continent which gives 
evidence of the oldest and most extensive agricultural activity, and to 
the question in this form there can be but one answer. The agricul- 
ture of the Old World ti'opics is adequately explainable by the supposi- 
tion that it was brought by the Polynesians, since the root crops of the 
Polynesians w^ere also staples of the Old World tropics. This proposi- 
tion would not apply to America, where, in addition to the sweet 
potato, yams, yam-bean {Pachyrhlzns), canna and taro, which crossed 
the Pacific, the aborigines also domesticated a long series of root crops 
confined to America at the time of its discovery. Such are: Manihot 
(cassava), Maranta (arrowroot), Calathea (lleren), Solanum (Irish 
potato), Xanthosoma {iie\eYQ\ species), Oxalis (ocu), Sechhim {chayote}^ 
T/'ojxeolum, (massua^), Ullucus^ Arracacia, and Ilelianthus (Jerusalem 
artichoke)'^ all of considerable local importance. 

The simplest of cultural methods, propagation from cuttings, was 
applied to these root crops and has been in use for so long a period that 
several of them have become seedless. With equal uniformit}^ the 
distinctively Old World root crops are grown from seed. And as all 
the Asiatic and European species are of temperate origin and have not 
Ijeen greatly modified from their wild ancestral types, it is reasonable 
to ])elieve that they were domesticated by peoples already accustomed 
to the planting. of cereals, which are correctly viewed as the basis of 
temperate agriculture. Root crops of American origin belong to at 
least twelve natural families, and the only important Old World addi- 
tion to the series is the mustard famil}', a distinctly temperate group, 
the cultivated members of which have not been greatly modified in 
domestication, and are still known in the wild state. 

This apparent superfluity of American root crops is explainable by 
the fact the different plants were independently domesticated in differ- 

'' Science, N. S., 15: 928-932. 1902. 

''Mr. W. E. Safford notes that the word " musofi" means, in the Samoan language, 
sticky or starchy and is appUed to the Polynesian arrowroot ( Tacca pmnatifi.c'a) a root 
crop of the Pacific islands. See Pratt, Samoan Dictionary, p. 211, 1893. 

'AH these root crops were i^ropagated from cuttings except Pac/fyrZ/m^.s, Canna, and

FOOD PLANTS OF ANCIENT AMERICA. 487 

ent localities, which means also that conditions favorable to the develop- 
ment of agriculture were verv general among the natives of America. 
That most of these plants are not known in the wild state testities also 
to the great antiquity of this agricultural tendency, while archaeology 
shows the same antiquity and diversity of prehistoric civilizations in 
America. From the mounds of Ohio to the equally remarkable ruins 
of Patagonia, the American continents and islands are, as it were, 
dotted with remains of rudimentary civilizations which nmst have 
required centuries and millenniums to rise from surrounding savager}', 
culminate, and perish. The constructive arts b}' which the existence 
of these vanished peoples is made known took the most diverse forms; 
some made mounds, some expended their energies upon huge carvings 
on high, inaccessible rocks, some dug devious underground passages, 
some set up monoliths and carved statues, and some built massive 
platforms, terraces, pyramids, temples,, and tombs, while still others 
are known onl}- from their potter^" or their metal work. In civiliza- 
tion, as in agriculture, the tropics of America stand in striking con- 
trast to those of the Old World. Here men of the same race showed 
great diversity of plants and arts; there races are diverse, while arts 
and staple food plants are relatively little varied. The early civiliza- 
tions of the eastern world resembled some of the primitive cultures 
of America more than these resembled each other. 

The American origin of agriculture is thus not doubtful, s'nu-e not 
merely one, but several, agricultures originated in America. The 
same can not be claimed for Asia and Africa, where only root crops 
shared with America attained a wide distribution, an indication that 
they reached those continents before the uses of the similar indigenous 
j)lants had been discovered. 

POISONOUS EOOT CROPS. 

The domestication of so many root crops in America indicates, as 
has been intimated, a widespread use of food of this kind before agri- 
culture began, and many savage tribes still have recourse to wild roots, 
either as a staple article of diet, or in times of scarcit}". It is evident, 
however, that the culture of the principal I'oot crops of America was 
not ])egun as a simple and direct transition from the use of fruits, 
which are commonly supposed to have been the food of primitive man. 
The more ancient and more important of the Old World root crops, 
the onions, leeks, garlics, carrots, and radishes are eaten, or are at 
least edible, in the raw state, l)ut in America there seems to Ive no indi- 
cation that the natives used any root crop in this way. Some of them, 
such as the sweet potato, the artichoke and the '"sweet cassava,'' can 
be eaten raw, but throughout the tropics of America the Indians, like 
the Chinese, prefer everything cooked. This luibit nmst have been 
SM 1903 32 



488 FOOD PLANTS OF ANCIENT AMERICA. 

adopted very far back to make possible the ancient domestication of 
2Ian)hot (cassava), CoJoeasia (taro) and Xantlwmma (3'autia), since the 
fleshy underground parts of these plants contain substances distinctly 
deleterious and extremely unpalatable until disintegrated and rendered 
harmless and tasteless b}^ heat. The same may have been true of the 
sweet potato/' since the fleshy roots of its uncultivated relatives are 
strongly purgative. Several of the yams, both wild and cultivated, 
are also poisonous in the raw state. 

That these poisonous root crops were the most popular, widespread 
and ancient would seem to afford sufficient proof that the discovery of 
the use of fire in cooking preceded the development of the art of agri- 
culture, though further support may be derived from the verj^ practi- 
cal consideration that without fire the primitive savage with his 
stone ax would make little headway in the work of clearing away 
the forest, . which is everywhere the first preliminary of tropical 
agriculture. 

To be able to utilize as nourishing food the natural supplies of 
starchy roots, which to other tribes were poisonous, would give the 
primitive fire users an important advantage over their neighbors, and 
would greatly conduce to the adoption of a settled existence in dis- 
tricts where the plants were plentiful. Cassava, yams, taro, sweet 
potatoes, and others of the primitive series of root crops often grow 
freely and without care from rejected fragments or pieces of stem, so 
that the digging of the roots and trampling down of the vegetation 
would not exterminate the wild supply, but would afford, on the 
contraiy, abundant opportunity and encouragement for the gradual 
increase of cultural efforts. 

A third important step in the domestic economy of primitive man 
was the making of dr}^ meal or starch from roots, accomplished in the 
tropics of both hemispheres b}- similar processes of grating, soaking 
in water, boiling, or treating with alkalis to destroy their poisonous 
properties. Separated from the sugars and other readily soluble sub- 

«A plant which may be the wild ancestral form of the sweet potato is a common 
weed in the C'oban coffee district of eastern Guatemala. The absence of the sweet 
potato from Samoa, Fiji, Guam, and the Philippines may have inclined some to doubt 
its prehistoric distribution in the Old World west of Hawaii and New Zealand, but 
according to Bretschneider it is recorded in Chinese books of the second or third 
century of the Christian era, and there are many varieties with native names in trop- 
ical Africa, both east and west, and legends indicative of its presence in early times. 

"It is told me as truth, that before the Portuguese came to this coast (Guinea), 
the negroes subsisted themselves with these two fruits (yams and sweet potatoes) 
and a few roots of trees, they being then utterly ignorant of ]\Iilhio (maize), which 
was brought hither by that nation." (Bosnian's Guinea (1698) in Pinkerton's 
Voyages, vol. 16, p. 459.) 

Cheeseman records two varieties of the sweet potato as existing in Rarotonga 
before the arrival of Europeans, and believes that the plant has been cultivated 
there "from time immemorial." (Trans. Linn. Soc. Lond., 2 sen, 6:289, 1903.)

stances which retain or absorlj moisture, the starch of the taro, cassava, 
arrowroot, canna, and other root crops can be qnickly and thoroughly 
dried, and will then keep indetinitel}". In the absence of cereals this 
simple expedient might well be deemed an epoch-making- discovery, 
since it rendered possible the accumulation of a permanent, readily 
transportable, food suppl}', and thus protected man from the vicissitudes 
of the season and the chase. That the resulting economic difference 
appeared striking to the hunting tribes of Guiana is apparent in the 
name the}^ gave to their agricultural neighbors, whom they called 
"Arawacks" or "eaters of meal." 

Cassava in the raw state carries a deadly charge of prussic acid and 
begins to decay in a few hours after being taken from the ground, but 
properly prepared it furnishes the starch wdiich keeps best, and which 
in the form of tapioca our civilization is tardily learning to appre- 
ciate as a wholesome delicacy. In spite of its unpromising (lualities 
when raw, cassava seems to have been the first and only root crop 
used by many South American tribes who plant nothing else except 
the so-called peach palm {GviUehna)^ a species which gives suggestive 
evidence of a cultivation nuich older than that of the date palm, since 
it is generally seedless, and is not known in the wild state. The 
farinaceous fruits are made into meal and baked into cakes in the same 
manner as the cassava, to which recourse is necessary during the 
months in which the single harvest of palm fruits is exhausted." 

Cassava is, indeed, so distinctivel}' the best, as well as the most 
generously and continuously productive, of the tropical root crops, that 
it could hardly have been known in the regions in which the others 
were domesticated. Ever since the Spanish conquest put an end to 
the isolation of the native peoples of tropical America the use of 
cassava has been slowly extending at the expense of similar crops; it 
has also found a footing in the Mala\^ region and other parts of the 
East. 

THE DOMESTICATION OF THE BANANA. 

In furthei" support of the suggestion that the use of the starch- 
producing root crops is a distinctively American development of primi- 
tive agriculture is the fact that the tropics of the Old World contributed 
no important cultivated plant of this class, and none which give evi- 
dence of long domestication. On the other hand, such regions as 
Madagascar and East Africa, where Polynesians are now supposed by 
ethnologists to have settled in " remote prehistoric times," continued 

« Some of these tribes are extremely primitive and, in the absence of all domestic 
implements, grate their cassava on the exjiosed spiny roots of another native palm 
(Iriartea exorhiza). Some Indian tribes of Gnianaare similarly dependent upon still 
a third palm {Maurida), from the pith of wliich they secure starch in a manner 
strongly suggestive of that used with the sago palm ol the Malay region.

the culture and differentiation of the varieties of the taro and the 
sweet potato, and were a_orieulturall\' mere outpost.s of the American 
tropics. 

The presence of the banana might be thought to explain the rela- 
tively small importance of root crops in the Old World, since it furnishes 
with far less effort of cultivation and preparation a highly nutritious 
and palatable food. It appears, however, that the use of root crops 
must have preceded the domestication of the banana, for. although the 
seed-bearing wild bananas are worthless as fruits and hence would not 
have been domesticated as such, nevertheless more species of them 
than of any other genus of food plants were brought into cultivation. 
The clue to this paradox is afforded by the fact that bananas are still 
cultivated as root crops in the Old World tropics, particularly in New 
Caledonia and Al)yssinia." 

That the varieties used like vegetables or root crops are as old or 
older than those grown for fruit is indicated by the fact that, like the 
sweet potato, taro, sugar cane, and ginger, they seldoni produce ffowers. 
Furthermore, among all savage tribes the varieties valued by civilized 
peoples as fruits are relatively little used, far greater popularity being 
enjoyed l)y the so-called "plantains," not edible in the raw state, even 
when ripe, though nearly always cooked and eaten while still imma- 
ture, or ])efore the starch has changed to sugar. They are also in 
manj^ countries dried and made into a meal or ffour often compared to 
arrowroot. 

In dietary and culinary senses the breadfruit also is as much a veg- 
etable as the taro or the sweet potato; \as a fruit it would be no more 
likeh' to be domesticated than its distant relative, the osage orange. 
The farinaceous character of the breadfruit also prol)ably explains its 
relatively greater importance among the Polynesians than in its orig- 
inal Malayan home, as shown by the propagation of numerous seedless 
varieties. The popularity of the breadfruit among the Polvnesianjs was 

«The suggestion that tlie primitive culture race which domesticated the banana 
came from America also receives definite support from the fact that an American 
plant {Heliconia bihai), somewhat similar to the banana but without an edible fruit, 
reached the islands of the Paoific in prehistoric times. Though no longer cultivated 
by the Polynesians, it has become established in the mountains of Samoa and in 
many of the more western archiiielagoes. In New Caledonia the tough leaves are still 
woven into hats, but the Pandanus, native in the Malay region, affords a better 
material for general purposes and has displaced Heliconia in cultivation among the 
Polynesians. In the time of Oviedo the natives of the West Indies made hats, mats, 
baskets, and thatch from the leaves of Heliconia, and the starchy rootstocks were 
eaten. 

Professor Schumann, of Berlin, has recently recognized the prehistoric introduc- 
tion of Heliconia bihai from America to the Pacific Islands. 

"Originally native in tropical America, Imt extensively naturalized since very 
ancient times (uralfen Zeiien) in Polynesia and Malaysia." (Schumann und Lauter-

further extended by the discovery that the fruits could be stored in 
covered pits, the prototj^pes of the modern silo. 

In Abyssinia the tender heart of the banana, there cultivated as a 
root crop, is fermented in a similar manner and then baked into 
cakes." 

FROM ROOT CROPS TO CEREALS. 

If the domestication of the banana is to be ascribed to cultivators of 
root crops, the same reasoning applies with even greater propriety' to 
cereals. Tribes accustomed to subsist on mangoes, dates, figs, or 
similar fruits which require no grating, grinding, or cooking, and are 
eaten alone and not with meat, would not develop the food habits and 
culinary arts necessary to equip primiti\'e man for utilizing the cereals. 

Wild bananas and their botanical relatives are natives of the rocky 
slopes of mountainous regions of the moist tropics, w^here shrubs and 
trees prevent the growth of ordinary her})aceous vegetation. The 
commencement of the culture of cereals by fruit-eating natives of 
such forest-covered regions is obviously improbable, but would be a 
comparatively easy transition for the meal-eating cultivators of root 
crops, since the grasses and other plants domesticated for their seeds 
are exactly those which flourish in cleared ground and are prompt to 
take advantage of the cultural efforts intended for other crops. Thus 
the Japanese have b}' selection secured a useful cereal from the com- 
mon barnyard grass {Panicum crus-galU)^ just as they have made a 
root crop of the burdock. Accordingh^ we should look to some taro- 
growing tribe of southeastern Asia as the probable domesticators of 
rice, sesame, and Guinea corn. That root crops preceded cereals in 
America was inferred above partly from the fact that root crops were 
not there grown from seeds, and there is a corresponding indication 
that the knowledge of cereals preceded the domestication of the seed- 
grown temperate root crops of the Old World, since none of these is 
anywhere dried, made into starch, or otherwise prepared for storage 
as the basis of a permanent food supply of primitive tribes. 

Without the winter protection which primitive man could not sup- 
ply, the culture of cassava and other tropical root crops is confined to 
strictly tropical climates, so that increase of latitude and altitude 
would bring to starch-eating peoples the necessity of a change of food 
plants. Indeed, altitude seems to have pWed a larger part than lati- 
tude in this transformation which brought about the adoption l.y 
primitive American peoi)les of Indian corn, '' Irish'" potato, arracaciia, 
oca, and other crops of the temperate plateaus of South America. 

Without reasonable doubt, maize is the oldest of cereals. The large 
soft kernels which distinguish it from all other food grasses would 
render it easih' available among the meal-eating aborigines of America, 

« Warburg, in Engler, Deutsch Ost-Africa, Nutzpflanzen, 100. 1895. In the lake 
regions of Central Africa the rootstocks of the fruit-bearing varieties of the Vianana 
are also pounded, dried, and made into meal, especially in times of scarcity. 



492 FOOD PLANTS OF ANCIENT AMERICA. 

and everywhere in tropical America maize is still prepared for food 
by methods adapted to root crops, and not ground dry and made into 
bread as a cereal, as among the Europeans who have colonized America. 
The rough stone slab (metate) against which the primitive Indian had 
rubbed his cassava and other farinaceous roots to a paste served also 
for maize, which is tirst softened by soaking in water with lime or 
ashes. The metate and the tortilla still hold their own in tropical 
America. 

Like other species cultivated in the highlands of tropical America 
most varieties of maize do not thrive in moist equatorial regions of 
low elevations," so that it did not supplant the root crops, though 
having a far wider distribution than any other plant cultivated by the 
aborigines in pre-Spanish America. Nor did the utilization of maize 
mark the limit of cereal cultures in America, though no small-seeded 
crop of the New World compares in popularity with rice, wheat, barle}', 
rye, and oats. Even in Mexico, the supposed home of maize, the 
seeds of Awai^tivthiis and Salvia (chia) attained considerable economic 
importance. In addition to their use as food, the latter were made to 
furnish a demulcent drink and an edible oil valued as an unguent and 
in applying pigments, a series of functions closely parallel to those of 
sesame, perhaps the most ancient of Old World herbaceous seed crops. 
Wild seeds of many kinds were collected by the Indians of the United 
States and Mexico, including wild rice (Z/'sania) and ZJnioJa^ another 
rice-like, aquatic grass of the shallow shore water of the Gulf of 
California. In Chile there existed also several incipient cultures of 
small-seeded plants, such as Madia^ while the people of the bleak 
plateaus of Peru and Bolivia had developed a unique cereal crop from 
a pigweed {Chenojxjdhna quinoa), another of many evidences of a 
general tendency to agricultural civilization in ancient America.^ 

« The varieties of maize cultivated, for example, by the Indians of Guatemala and 
Peru are closely adapted to their different altitudes, only a few sorts yielding good 
crops in the tropical lowlands. 

& "It has been erroneously stated that maize was the only species of grain known 
to the Americans before the conquest. In Chile, according to ]\Iolina, the mager, a 
species of rye, and the tuca, a species of barley, were both common before the 
fifteenth century, and as there was neither rye nor barley in pre-Spanish America it 
is evident that if they were common, even after the conquest, and not European 
grain, they were indigenous. In Peru the bean (two or more species) and quinua 
were common before the conquest, for I have frequently found them in the huacas, 
preserved in vases of red earthenware." (Stevenson's Travels, Vol. I, pp. 336-.367. ) 

There are, however, many indigenous species of barley {Hordeum) in South 
America, some seventeen being listed as valid in the Index Kewenm. It is not 
impossible that some of these were cultivated, or at least utilized, before the coming 
of the Spaniards. It might have taken very little time for such a crop to be replaced 
by barley brought from Europe. 

Quinua, like the root crops, is inedible when raw. It contains an extremely bitter 
substance which has to be removed by long cooking, dnrini; which it is customary 
to change the water eleven or twelve times. 



FOOD PLANTS OF ANCIENT AMERICA. , 493 

As long" recognized by historians and ethnologists, maize was the 
most important factor in the material progress of ancient America, and 
the American civilizations remained on a much more strictly agricul- 
tural basis than those of the Old World, a fact not without practical 
signiticanee to modern agriculture, since it undoubtedly conduced to 
the more careful selection and improvement of the many valuable plants 
which we owe to the ancient peoples of America. Subordinate only to 
maize from the agricultural standpoint was the domestication of the 
beans, while the materials for a developed culinary art and a varied 
and wholesome diet were furnished bj^ a variety of minor products, like 
the Cayenne popper, the tomato, the tree tomato (( 'uplionuDidrfi)^ the 
pineapple, sev^eral species of the strawberry tomato {Physalia)^ the paw- 
paw (Carica), the granadilla {PaKsiflora quadrangularis), the gourd, 
the squash, and the peanut. American fruit trees, such as the cus- 
tard apple and related species of Aurtona, the avocado {Persea)^ the 
sapodilla, Mammea and Liccuma, afford refreshing acids, beverages, 
relishes, or salads, but do not furnish substantial food like the banana. 
Contrary to the opinion of De Candolle there is every probability that 
the banana reached America from the west long before the arrival of 
the Spaniards, but it evidently did not come until after the agriculture 
and cultivated plants of America had spread into the Pacific. 

NO PASTOEAL PERIOD IN AMERICA. 

Relying on the traditions of the peoples of western Asia and the 
Mediterranean region, many writers have assumed that animals were 
domesticated before plants, and that a pastoral stage marked the first 
step of primitive man from savagery toward civilization. There are, 
however, no indications of such a period in the agricultural history of 
the ancient peoples of America, nor among the ''orientar' nations of 
the Asiatic shores of the Pacific and Indian oceans. The straight- 
haired men of both continents were primarily domesticators and culti- 
vators of plants. The Chibcha people of the interior of Colombia 
attained a considerable degree of advancement without adopting a 
single domestic animal. The Peruvians and Chinese learned to use 
beasts of burden and animal fibers and skins, but their pastoral efforts 
were merely incidental to agriculture; they remained essentialh' vege- 
tarians, eating little meat, other than fish, and never taking up the use 
of milk. 

A settled agricultural existence made it practicable, however, to 
tame animals, and it may well be dou))ted whether any animal, with 
the possible exception of the dog, was domesticated ])y wandering 
savages. The lack of useful domestic animals in ancient America has 
been discussed by Payne " and other historians as an evidence of the 

« History of the New World called America, Vol. II. 



494, FOOD PLANTS OF ANCIENT AMERICA. 

inferior intelligence and resourcefulness of the aboriginal peoples, but 
it seems that one tribe or another had domesticated all the American 
animals likely to be of value to civilized man; certain it is that Euro- 
peans, with three centuries of opportunity, have not added to the num- 
ber or uses, or extended the range of any American animals, except 
the turke}^ and guinea pig. On the other hand, the American Indians 
have not failed to appreciate the superiority of the domesticated ani- 
mals brought by Europeans, and the more enterprising tribes have 
adopted the hen, cat, pig, goat, sheep, cow, and horse. Indeed, even 
nonagricultural Indians of our Western States have taken kindly to 
the keeping of herds of sheep and cattle, and have thus assumed the 
pastoral state, illustrating, perhaps, the manner in which, in ancient 
times, domesticated animals spread more rapidly than cultivated plants 
from the agricultural East into the Mediterranean region. 

Nomadic hunters or fruit eaters would not be likely to domesticate 
anything themselves, but offered the choice of plants or animals already 
thoroughly tamed and improved by selection, they are more likely to 
take the animals first as requiring a less radical change of food and 
habits of life. The milk and flesh of their herds would still be sup- 
plemented by the game, honey, wild fruits, and other edible plants 
which might be encountered in searching for pasture for their flocks, 
after the manner of the patriarchs of the Old Testament. Dates, figs, 
and other fruit trees might receive some attention from such wander- 
ers, but the more successful they miglit become as shepherds the less 
likely thej^ would be to take up the planting of cereals or of other her- 
baceous crops, which, in the absence of fences, would be appropriated 
by their animals before the owners could make even an initial experi- 
ment. It is accordingly significant that the origin of the agricultures 
and civilizations of the valleys of the Nile and Euphrates is no longer 
sought by ethnologists with Semitic shepherds or more northern peo- 
ples, but with a seafaring race which has been traced to southern 
Arabia, and whose language has been found to have analogies with 
the primitive Malayo-Polynesian tongue of Madagascar." 

OTHER INDICATIONS OF TRANS-PACIFIC COMMUNICATION. 

The American origin of agriculture could ask for no more striking 
testimony from Old World archaeology and ethnology than the recently 
discovered fact that the primitive culture race of Babylonia, which 
brought "letters, astronomy, agriculture, navigation, architecture, and 

«Keane (Man, Past and Present, p. 250 et seq. ) considers the language of Mada- 
gascar to be Polynesian rather than Malayan, and holds that the similarities between 
Madagascar and Arabia are not due, as has been suj^posed, to a recent contact 
during the Mohammedan period, but date back to the ancient Minseans and Sabfeans, 
maritime peoples who had commerce with India, and who are now supposed to have 
worked the prehistoric mines of the South African "Oi^hir."

other arts,^' was "a short, robust people, with coarse, black hair; 
peaceful, industrious, and skillful hus))andnien, with a surprising- 
knowledo-e of irrigating- processes.''" 

It is a long reach from Babylonia to tropical America, but the com- 
munity of ancient food plants will prevent biologists, at least, from 
passing as a meaning-less coincidence the fact that these earl}- agricul- 
tural civilizations of Asia differed in no essential respect from those of 
our own so-called New World, not even in the physical characteristics 
of the people, so that the same words describe Ijoth equally well. If 
it be found that the same taro plant was in reality cultivated in ancient 
Egypt. Southern Arabia, Hindustan, Polynesia, and America, ancient 
human communication between these remote parts of the world is as 
definitel}^ established as thoug-h coins of Alexander the Great had been 
dug- up. It is no empty fancy, but the most direct and practical 
explanation of concrete facts, to believe that the robust, straight-haired 
race may have brought from America some of the plants they culti- 
vated in Asia. It was among such men that agriculture, navigation, 
and other arts of civilization reached high development in America at 
a very remote period. The ancient cultures of the Old World left 
traces of no such infancy and gradual growth as those of America. 
Eg3'pt and Babj^onia arose suddenly to civilizations further advanced 
than those of Mexico and Peru. 

That the Aztec and Inca empires were comparatively recent political 
organizations has caused many writers to forget that they incorpor- 
ated much more ancient culture. For centuries still unnumbered the 
Andean region of South America supported crowded populations. 
On the western slopes of Peru every inch of irrigable land was culti- 
vated — houses, towns, and cemeteries being relegated to waste places 
to save the precious soil. Irrigation was practiced with a skill and 
thoroughness unexcelled in modern times, though by methods closely 
duplicated in ancient Arabia, even including the boring- of deep tun- 
nels for coll(K'ting- subterranean water. 

To claim that the Polynesians, Malays, Phcenecians, Egyptians, 
Hindoos, or Chaldeans came from America would be a careless anachro- 
nism, to say the least, for the very terms of the problem place its 
solution far beyond the period in which these peoples, nations, and 
languages were differentiated. It is doubly unreasonable to expect 
any very close resemblance of languages or arts in the Tropics of Asia 
and America at the time of their discovery l)y Europeans, since change 
and diversification had continued on both sides of the Pacific. To 
accomplish the dissemination of the tropical food plants there was 
necessary only a primitive people with the skill in agriculture and 
navigation possessed by the Polynesians and Malays. It has long been

admitted by ethnologists that the remote ancestors of these races did 
overrun all the Tropics of the Old World, and the latest investigations 
warrant the belief that they made their intiiience felt also along the 
shores of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, where the civilization of 
the Mediterranean countries was formerly thought to have originated. 

It can not be declared impossible, of course, that this primeval 
migration from America took place at a time when there was more 
land in the Pacific than now, as Belt and other geologists have held 
that there was, some thousands of years ago, but such conjectures are 
rendered gratuitous in view of the highly developed seafaring talents 
of the inhabitants of the Pacific islands and of the adjacent shores of 
America, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. It is no farther from 
America to the inhabited islands of the Pacific than from Tahiti to 
Hawaii, a route traversed by the Polynesians." In ancient, as in modern 
times, the sea was not a barrier, but the most open way of communica- 
tion between distant regions; then, as now, the boat was the easiest 
means of transportation known to man. In time and labor of travel 
the islands of the Pacific were far nearer to Peru, for example, than 
many of the inland regions conquered b\^ the Incas of Cuzco. More- 
over, the Peruvians told the Spaniards of inhabited islands in the Pacific, 
or at least gave sailing directions which enabled Quiros to reach the 
Low Archipelago. There was a tradition that one of the Incas had 
made a vovage of two years in the Pacific and returned with black 
prisoners of war. Apparently, too, they told the Spaniards that the 
Ijauana was brought from this quarter, for Acosta gathered from the 
Indians that it was not a native of America but came from "Ethiopia." 
These historical incidents have been overlooked or disregarded, perhaps 
because such possibilities as an American origin of agriculture and a 
trans-Pacific dissemination of food plants have not been considered by 
writers on primitive man. The times, routes, and methods of travel 
are, of course, questions to be approached by detailed studies of many 
kinds. For the present purposes it suffices to remember that the 
actual introduction of plants by human agency discounts in advance 
all objections on the ground of distances and difficulties of communica- 
tion, and justifies the fullest use of biological or other data in tracing 
the origin and dissemination of agricultural civilization in the Tropics 
of both hemispheres. 

The distribution and the uses of tropical cultivated plants support, 
it is true, the belief of ethnologists in the truly indigenous character 
of the peoples, agricultures, and civilizations of the western hemi- 
sphere, but they also testify to a very early colonization of the islands 
and coasts of the Pacific and Indian oceans from tropical America. 

« The similarity of Polynesian culture to that of ancient America has been discussed 
at length in Lang's Polynesian Nation, Ellis's Polynesian Researches, and Rutland's 
History of the Pacific.

Botanical evidence makes it plain that most of the plants shared by 
the people of the two continents originated in America, like numer- 
ous other cultivated species which remained limited to this continent. 
The primitive culture peoples of the tropical regions of ancient America 
were accustomed to the cooking, g-rinding, and storing of vegetable 
food, and were thus prepared to appreciate and utilize the cereals b}^ 
agricultural experience lacking among- the fruit-eating aborigines of 
the Old World, where there seems to have been no tendency toward a 
spontaneous development of agriculture. Civilizations have nowhere 
developed without the assistance of the farinaceous root crops and 
cereals, the use and cultivation of which are habits acquired by primi- 
tive luan in America and carried in remote times westward across the 
Paciiic, together with the social organization and constructive arts 
w^hich appear only in settled communities supported by the tillage of 
the soil. 



DESERT PLANTS AS A SOURCE OF DRINKING WATER. 



Bv Frederick Y. Coville. 



A stranger left alone in a desert would die of thirst, and yet there 
is water in all deserts, and both the native animals and the native 
races know how to find it. This water is gathered and stored by 
plants, which have built and tilled their reservoirs for their own pur- 
poses, but which yield it up. when required, for the use of the animal 
world. 

The extent of the root sj^stem in desert plants, b}- means of which 
the}^ absorb their water from the soil, is often astonishingly great. 
In the Mohave Desert of (California a branching cactus {Opuntia 
echlnoearpa) 48 centimetei's (19 inches) in height was found to have a 
network of roots extending over an area of ground about 5.5 meters 
(18 feet) in diameter." The roots lay near the surface, at a depth of 5 
to 10 centimeters (2 to i inches), a situation which enabled them to 
take advantage of a single substantial downpour and, before the pre- 
cipitation had been again absorbed into the parched air, to suck up a 
supply of water sufficient, if need be, for a whole year's use. Other 
desert plants send their roots deep into the ground for water, and a 
certain shrubby species of acacia found about Tucson, Arizona, pos- 
sesses, according to Professor R. H. Forbes, a double-root system, in 
which one series of roots spreads out horizontall}', close beneath the 
surface, and a second series, sharply defined, goes directly downward 
into the soil. Such an arrangement enables the plant to seize upon 
water either from light precipitation or when deeplv percolating under 
dry stream beds. 

While the devices for absorption in desert ]:)lants are unusual, the 
mechanical contrivances bv means of which these plants are enabled 
to retain the moisture they have absorbed are still more remarkable. 
Other factors l)eing eciual, the amount of water transpired, or evapo- 
rated, from a plant is proportional to the area of its green surface, 
which, in ordinary plants, is a foliage surface. A specimen of coflfee 
plant {Coffea at'ahlca) weighing 2<».5 grams is found to have a leaf 
surface computed at KU.-lTB square millimeters, which gives a ratio of

McKenney the structure of a pore of Kch'uiocactus emoryi is presented 
for comparison (tig. 3). It is to be noted that the cuticle of the latter 
is excessively thickened. Beneath the epidermis is a deep layer of 
hypodermis with very thick walled cells and small cell cavities. It 
can scarcely be doubted that, except at the pores, the epidermal struc- 
ture is impervious to moisture even under the extreme desiccating 
conditions of the desert. Beneath the minute 
opening of the pore is an air chamber, the 
lower contracted end of which is made up of 
the walls of the green, moist interior cells of 
the plant. The portion of the walls of this 
chamber which lie within the hypodermis. 
Doctor McKenney has discovered, are cuti-

The cushion of air in the chamber is therefore 
slowly receiving moisture at its lower end 
from the interior water supply of the plant 
and slowly giving it off into the outer air when- 
ever the two guard cells open the narrow slit 
between them. The whole sti'ucture is evidently well adapted to the 
maintenance of a transpiration current at an exceedingly attenuated 
rate adapted to the plant's limited supply of moisture.^ 

The interior of the plant consists chiefly of water-storage cells (tig. 
4). These are globular in form, devoid of green coloring matter, 
and with walls somewhat thickened but possessing thinner sieve-plate

areas which permit the ready transfer of water from one cell to 
another throughout the interior. Doctor ]McKenney has made a 
determination of the water in a sam- 
ple of this storage tissue and finds 
the astonishing amount, by weight, 
of 96.3 per cent. The plant when 
mied to its capacity is almost a tank 
of water. 

That animals which live in a desert 
would have difficulty in securing a 
regular supph' of water is evident. 
But it is a matter of fact that many 
of these animals go without water 
for months at a time, deriving all 
their moisture from the watery tis- 
sues of plants; and there is conclusive 
evidence that some animals never 
drink water, apparently not knowing 
what water is, and never eat even 
ordinary herbage, but subsist on dry 
seeds alone. D. W. Carnegie records

peccaries live for months at a time without possible access to natural 
Yv^ater. It is evident from their habit of rooting in the ground like the 
domestic hog, that they derive some of their requisite moisture from 
the underground portions of plants, while another source of moisture 
is the fruit of opuntia and other cactuses. 

Mr. T. S. Van Dyke, in an article on the mule deer," says: 

When on this food [cactus] deer not only can go without water, but often go 
without it when it is perfectly convenient. On the great ^lexican desert known as 
the Bolsor. de Mapimi, I hunted for several weeks in 1884, stopping at a railroad 
station 25 miles from anywhere, and known to be 25 miles from any other water. 
Several hundred feet from the station the leakage from the water cars of the railroad 
made a shallow pond some 50 feet long and a dozen wide. To the leeward of tliis 
fresh tracks of deer could be found almost any morning, all near enough to smell 
the water, but not one of them going to it. I had plenty of other most i>ositive 
proof tliat the deer there, as well as the antelope, did not go to water, though the 
days were hot enough to make a man want water as much as in midsummer. For 
many a league there was no green feed except some of the varieties of cactus, and 
every deer and antelope that I opened in this vicinity was filled with it. The same 
is true in parts of Sonora and in much of Lower California. 

This statement is confirmed by Mr. E. W. Nelson, the American 
naturalist most widelv experien(;ed in Mexican travel and observation, 
to whom similar instances are well known. 

Various authentic records exist regarding the almost incredible 
abstinence of some of the small desert rodents of the southwestern 
United States. Mr. Vernon Bailey, of the United States Biological 
Survey, informs me that he kept a desert jumping mouse {3fl<rodlj)o- 
dops megacephaliis) for more than a month, during which period it ate 
only drv seeds and grain. After it had become very tame he placed 
water before it, but it would not drink. When the dish was elevated 
until the water touched the end of its nose, the animal showed everv 
sign of ignorance of the liquid and even repugnance to it. Mr. F. Ste- 
phens, of Santa Ysabel, California, has recorded the statement* that he 
had a pet of the gray pocket mouse {Perognathus fallax) which drank 
no water in the six months during which it had been in his possession; 
that it would not touch water and did not seem to know what water was, 
and that it would not eat green food. He states also that Mr. W. G. 
Wright, of San Bernardino, California, had a captive specimen of the 
tuft-tailed pocket mouf^e{Pero(/nathuspemet7lafus) which had no drink 
and no food save dry grain for more than two years. Dr. J. A. Allen, 
of the American Museum of Natural History, states^ that a pocket 
mouse from western Texas {Pet'ognathns merrimni) had been kept for 
nearly three years without water, his food during that period consist- 
ing exclusively of dr}^ mixed birdseed. The domicile of the animal

was a tin box 10 by 20 b}^ li inches, open at the top, but with a thick 
la3'er of earth at the bottom. Doctor Allen summarized his experience 
with the animal in the statement, ''As no water and no fresh vegeta- 
tion have been given him for nearly three years, it is evident that the 
only moisture required for his sustenance is derived wholly from dry 
birdseed."' A water content determination of dry mixed birdseed, 
made in Washington, December 31, 1903, shows 11.75 per cent of 
moisture. Freshly matured wheat grains in the climate of the arid 
portions of California have a water content of only 6 to 8 per cent of 
their weight. It is impossible that these rodents, performing their 
functions of respiration, digestion, and secretion, can subsist on this- 
amount of moisture. The subject is one that deserves precise quanti- 
tative measurement as well as anatomical investigation. Is it possible 
that these animals possess some apparatus by means of which they can 
abstract moisture from the air h3'groscopically and condense it for 
their own use i Or do they manufacture the water they require by the 
chemical dissolution of starch? 

However this may be, it is clear from some of the cases cited that 
the water suppl}^ of many desert animals, either for long periods or 
during their whole lives, comes not from natural water, but from that 
stored in the tissues of plants. It is an old established fact that ani- 
mals do not possess the power to manufacture their food out of the 
raw mineral constituents of the soil, but that these constituents must 
first be elaborated into starch or other food products by plants. To 
this fundamental dependence of animal upon vegetable life may be 
added, in the case of many desert animals, their further complete 
dependence on plants for their supply of water. 

Under certain conditions this dependence of desert animals upon 
plants for their water is extended even to the human race. The rain- 
fall of the desert of Sonora is so small and so irregularly timed that 
periods of prolonged drouth occur, during which man}^ of the cus- 
tomary sources of water supply, always few and far between, fail 
utterly. To two of the native tribes, the Seris and Papagos, such a 
condition is not necessarily serious, for they betake themselves to the 
water stored in cactuses. 

Some of the largest cactuses, such as the saguaro, or giant cactus 
( Oereus giganteus), the pitahaya ( Oereus tkurberi), and the sina {Pilo- 
cereus schottil)^ are not availa})le as a source of drinking water, for 
their juice is bitter and nauseating. But the juice of certain species 
of the genus Echinocactus, notably E. emoryi and E. loislizeni^ is sweet 
and palatable. These cactuses, the Mexican name of which is bisnaga, 
are known b\' all natives of the desert region as a potential source of 
drinking water. In February, 1903, the writer, in company with Dr. 
D. T. MacDougal, while seeking a location for a desert botanical labo- 
ratory for the Carnegie Institution, found an opportunity to observe 

SM 1903 33 



504 DESERT PLANTS AS A SOURCE OF DRINKING WATER. 

the extraction of water from a l)isnao-a accordino- to the primitive 
process and by one of the aborioines themselves. The localit}'^ was in 
the State of Sonora, Mexico, at a point about 12 kilometers (8 miles) 
west of the railroad station of Torres. Upon request a Papago Indian, 
the guide of the party, exhibited the operation. The cactus used was 
a specimen of bisnaga {Eelunocactus emoryi) with which the region 
abounds. 

The plant selected was about 1 meter (3it feet) high and 0.5 meter 
(20 inches) in diameter. Its top was first sliced oli', exposing- the white 
interior (pi. i). It was evident that this was saturated with water, 
but the structure of the tissue was such that the water did not exude 
of its own accord. The Indian cut a stake of palo verde {Parh'msonia 
micropliijlla) about 7.5 centimeters (3 inches) in diameter at the larger 
and blunt end, and wnth this proceeded to mash the white flesh of the 
cactus into a pulp. As the churning progressed a bowl was formed 
in the top of the cactus, and when a suitable quantity of pulp had 
accumulated in it the Indian, taking this up handful by handful, 
squeezed out the water into the bowl, throwing the rejected pulp upon 
the ground. 

From the upper 20 centimeters (about 8 inches) of the cactus about 
3 liters (3 quarts) of water was obtained. Its flavor maj- be described 
as very slightly salty and somewhat herbaceous. Any really thirsty 
traveler would have drunk it without hesitation, and our Papago, 
although he had had plenty of water from the supply we carried, 
drank the cactus juice w4th evident pleasure (pi. ii). 

A bisnaga of approximately spherical form furnishes a more pala- 
table water than the cylindrical specimens many years older, and care 
is taken to use for a masher a wood which has no bitter, resinous, or 
poisonous qualities. No deleterious efi'ect is caused, our Indian stated, 
through drinking a quantitv of the water, unless one subjects himself 
immediately afterwards to violent ph3^sical exercise. The natives use 
the cactus water, if need be, for mixing bread, and evidently it could 
be devoted to an}' camp use. 

An interesting correlation is to be noted betw^een the palatable flesh 
of the bisnagas and their efl'ective protection against grazing animals 
through their impenetrable armor of hooked and rigid spines. With- 
out such protection the bisnaga would be doomed to early extinction 
by such animals as required a continual supply of moist, herbaceous 
food. Other cactuses, on the contrarv, which have a bitter and nause- 
ating juice, often have only a very imperfect protection by spines, as 
the giant QixoXxx^ {Cereus (/iganteus) and the sina {PUocereufi schottif). 
One cactus, the peyote {Lophopho7X( '(v!JUarn,sii)^ has no spines what- 
ever at maturity. In appearance it is as plump and juicy as an apple; 
yet, as is demonstrated by its abundance in certain localities, it is amply

protected against the depreciations of animals by its bitter and poison- 
ous juice. 

Anotlier notable feature in the mechanical construction of the bis- 
nao-a is the fluted character of its surface. Between the times when 
its body is fully distended with water from the absorption following- 
a heavy rain and other times when its interior tissues are far shrunken 
after a prolonged drought, the plant, if ordinarily constructed, would 
be ver}' liable, from the repeated wrinkling and stretching of its hard 
skin, to injury by cracking. What form could be more admirably 
suited to accommodate the bisnaga to this feature of its existence than 
the fluting of its surface, each fluting or rib becoming thick by the 
absorption of water and thin by its loss i 

Streiuious are the conditions to which the plants of the desert are 
doomed; many and remarkable are the devices with which these con- 
ditions are met, and rich are the opportunities for research where 
such phenomena exist. It is a matter for congratulation that to the 
United States belongs the credit of first establishing a botanical labo- 
ratory in the midst of the desert. Such a laboratory has been founded 
near Tucson, Arizona, by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, 
and we may contidently expect to learn from time to time of results 
which shall excite our wonder and which shall constitute new contri- 
butions to the sum of human knowledge. 



A NEW THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES." 



Bv A. Dastre. 



Nearly half a centui\Y has elapsed since the appearance of Darwin's 
work On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, It is 
unnecessary to recall the commotion which that publication produced 
and the effects which followed. It was the signal for a profound revo- 
lution affecting- the natural sciences, secondarily other sciences, and 
even the mental attitude of individuals. The idea of the evolution of 
living forms, of their descent, or rather of their transformation, 
already advanced by Lamarck and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire was rescued 
from the ol)livion or the indifference in which it had hitherto remained 
and was imposed, in a manner, on almost the whole seientitic world. 
At present it is accepted with but slight opposition. It is, to be sure, 
onl}^ an h^^pothesis; but, as it is the only one that has any rational 
basis, it becomes, because of that fact, almost a necessity. As M. 
Yves Delage says: 

If there were a scientific hypothesis other than descent by which the origin of 
species could be explained, a number of naturalists would abandon, as insufficiently 
demonstrated, the opinions which they now hold. 

This may be true, but there is no other scientific hypothesis, and 
the naturalists of to-day, willing or not, are 4;ransf ormists — that is to 
say, they are persuaded that living forms are not unrelated to each 
other, invariable, isolated, brought into existence by special acts of 
creation, and without any bond of union between them, but that they 
are, on the contrary, related — that is to say, derived one from the other. 

Darwinism did not, however, consist merely in an affirmation of 
transformism, for this had alread}' been advanced prior to Darwin. 
Transformism certainly arose from the application to the natural 
sciences of the idea of " (lontinuit}' " introduced into science by the 
mathematicians of the eighteenth century. We may thus explain the 
course taken b}^ that idea as well as. the variations which it assumed. 
The mathematicians passed it on to Buff'on, who was originally a 
geometrician and who entered the Acadeni}' of Sciences as such; he in 
turn transmitted it to Lamarck, who was one of his intimate friends, 
and from him it passed to Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. It was, however,

508 A NEW THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. 

the illustrious English naturalist who first explained the mechanism 
by which, according" to him, the transformation of one species into 
another might be etfected, thus producing a continuity of living forms. 
This mechanism is natural selection. 

Now it appears that, while Darwin succeeded in establishing the 
idea of the continuity of living forms by means of generation — that is to 
sa}". transformism, he was much less successful as regards the means 
which ho proposed. To speak plainl}', he failed. There'are but few 
naturalists at the present time who attribute to natural selection any 
role whatever in the filiation of species. As has been remarked by 
Herbert Spencer, it is not in this way that truly specific characters 
can be acquired. Besides, when once acquired, the}' coidd certainly 
not be fixed by heredity. It is some ten years since an3'one has held 
to the fixed hereditv of characters acquired by a living being in the 
course of its existence, or at least during ten years past that idea, 
formerly admitted without opposition, has been fiercely attacked and 
denied by naturalists of great standing, sucli as Weismann, Pfiiiger, 
Naegeli, Strasburger, Kolliker, His, Kay-Lankester, Brooks, Meynert, 
van Bemmelen, and others. 

A Dutch naturalist, Hugo de Vries, who has a wide reputation 
among the botanists of our time, has just given the finishing stroke to 
the theory of natural selection, already much shaken, and has pro- 
posed in place of it another hypothesis which he calls ''the theory of 
mutation." The name in itself is not very significative and needs to 
be explained. We shall do that presently. The doctrine is founded 
on ol)servation and experiments which by the sagacity, long and 
patient effort, and careful criticism of their author deserve to be ranked 
with the admirable o})servations of Darwin. On the other hand, it 
has been most favorably received by many naturalists. For these two 
reasons the scientific public is obliged to take it into consideration, 
and. at least, to become acquainted with it. 

I. 

Every new being resembles the ones from which it ascended, con- 
sidering those in the widest sense. We say — and it is only a form of 
speech — that it owes this resemblance to heredity. Heredit}^ then, is 
simply the name by which we express the fact that an ofi'spring 
resembles its parents. On the other hand, the resemblance is not 
absolute. For example, two animals of the same litter or two plants 
of the same sowing are never identical. We apply the term " varia- 
tion,''' individual variation, to such divergences or to the tendency 
which produces them. It is, then, a fact that in new generations there 
appear new characters which it is impossible to attribute to a reversion 
to ancestral features — that is to say. they are truly new and unde- 
scribed hitherto. It is only as to the extent and importance of such 
characters that discussion arises. 



A NEW THEORY OF TitE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. 509 

We can not deny that variation exists. Living forms have not the 
rigidity of stone; they vary incessantly, and these variations have 
been used b}^ breeders for the creation of races. Modifications of this 
kind are restricted, however, within certain limits. Their amplitude is 
restrained b\' three conditions, as follows: Generalh" they are not per- 
manent and they disappear at the same time as do the circumstances 
under which they are produced; they are not transmissible by gener- 
ation to descendants; and finally, the modified beings have not lost the 
aptitude of crossing with those that have not been modified^ This is 
what is meant by declaring that these individual variations can not 
create a new species; for these three defects found in the modified 
being are exactl}' those which define a species. 

Up to the i)resent time no one has ever seen an animal or vegetable 
species engender another or transform itself into another. In other 
terms, no one, except perhaps Hugo de Vries, has perceived a living 
form arising from another form, yet differing from it by features hav- 
ing the value of those which distinguish species, and showing itself 
inapt for crossing with the parent, although capable of maintaining 
and preserving itself by generation. Such a profound transformation 
can not be accomplished in a moment or by a single effort. 

Darwin supposed that such a transformation could be accomplished 
by degrees. According to his view the cumulative repetition of certain 
small variations might effect a more considerable transformation. In 
order to do this it would suffice that they should always be produced 
in the same direction during a long course of generations. Breeders 
effect this by reproducing and maintaining the conditions of the origi- 
nal transformation and breeding together the individuals which present 
such transformation. This is "artificial selection." It is a judicious 
and methodical exercise of the two properties of heredity and of variation 
practised for the interest and advantage of man. 

The supposition of Darwin is equivalent to admitting that nature, 
personified, acts like man, heedful of consequences and with a method, 
by "natural selection" having in view the interest and advantage of 
species. Certain slight variations appearing under diverse influences, 
for example, under a change in the environment, will constitute an 
advantage for individuals. Such individuals are thus l)etter adapted 
to these new circumstances and have a better chance of survival; these 
are the ones which will pair and h}- heredity preserve the advanta- 
geous variation, fix it, accumulate it, until there is formed a race, a 
variety, and finally a new species. This automatic play of the best 
adaptation favoring certain individuals, permitting them to survive 
and to reproduce themselves, has here, in natural selection, the same 
pr;)vidential role as the breeder plays in artificial selection. It is the 
best adaptation which designs and choo.-es the useful variation: it is 
that which favors the individuals that possess it; it is that, in line. 



510 A NEW THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. 

which degrades the others in the concurrence, either direct or indirect, 
which exists between animals and plants, in that sort of strnggle for 
existence whose importance was perceived already by A. de Candolle 
and Lyell, and which results in the disappearance of the vanquished 
species and the effective triumph of the new one. 

It may be noted that natural selection is not a single hypothesis; it 
is a linking together of three hypotheses. If we separate the links of 
this chain we can show" that not one of them w^ill stand test. The first 
hypothesis is that of the advantage in the struggle for existence which 
is given to an animal by the possession of a small, adaptive variation; 
the second is that of a preservation, by transmission, of this acquired 
character; the third is the progress, always in the same direction, of 
these profitable variations, which, accumulating, finally create a spe- 
cific character. None of these hypotheses will support a searching- 
examination. 

In the first place, as to the benefit of a small, adaptive variation, it 
may be observed that it would be, in itself, too insignificant to give 
rise to selection. Let us take for example the transformation of an 
ungulate quadruped into a giraffe according to the Darwinian theory. 
In this system an increase of some centimeters in the length of the 
neck would be a favorable adaptive variation; it would allow the 
animal, in case of famine, to browse upon the verdure of trees some 
inches higher than his companions could. But with Mivart, Naegeli, 
Delage, Osborn, Emery, Cuenot, and others, we may affirm that in 
case of actual famine this advantage would amount to nothing and 
would not assure the survival of its possessor. The individuals who 
would die would be the youngest or the oldest, or, in a general way, 
the feeblest. The variation must be considerable in amount in order 
to constitute a real advantage and in order that tiie process of selec- 
tion may be applied to it. 

The second hypothesis is, then, to imagine that this variation, 
admitted, for the moment, as useful, may be preserved and trans- 
mitted by generation. We have stated above what naturalists think 
at the present time concerning the transmission of acquired characters. 
The least that one can say is that it is \evy much controverted. 

The third h3q5othesis, grafted upon the first two, is the repetition of 
the variation. Even if we disregard the objections made to the pre- 
vious h3'potheses there are still others which present themselves here. 
It is, indeed, necessary that the variation should continue to be pro- 
duced in the same direction during a great number of generations in 
order that it may be recognizable, since it is minute each time it occurs; 
many additional elongations would be needed in order to produce the 
neck of a giraffe from that of an ungulate. Lamarck, by placing the 
cause of variation in external conditions, makes this continual addition 
of effect plausible. The permanence, or better, the repetition of the 



A NEW THEOKY OF THE OKIGIN OF SPECIES. 511 

processes of variation, will perpetuate itself as long as these external 
conditions are kept up. For example, in attributing the elongation of 
the neck of a girati'e to the habit of browsing upon the high leaves of 
trees and the effort of the animal to reach those which are still higher, 
Lamarck accounts for the detinite and sustained course of variation. 
But it is exactly this resource that Darwin took away, since he did not 
accept the ideas of his illustrious predecessor as to the causes of varia- 
tion. Decidedly, selection appears to be a process more adapted for 
preserving a state of things than for creating a new one. It is more 
conservative than revolutionary. 

Besides, this is not the only objection, not even the most serious 
one, which affects this third hypothesis of Darwin. The principal 
difficult}" with it is that it attempts to account for the considerable 
change which creates a new species by too slow an accumulation of 
inappreciable changes. When the Darwinists are pressed closely they 
demand time — much time; too much time. The}" require indefinite 
series of generation's in order that the smallest species may be formed. 
Their adversaries have reproached them with having made our globe 
too old; this is also the opinion of Lord Kelvin. 

In reality it must be that there is not so much delay in the creation 
of a new species. This is exactly what Hugo de Vries contends. He 
denies the gradual transformation of species by the addition of inap- 
preciable variations; or, at least, he affirms that they may be produced 
by a process that is rapid, precipitate, sudden. The new species 
wdiose development he has observed have arisen abruptly, as one nn.y 
say, explosively. This is what the Dutch naturalist calls " spasmodic 
progress." 

II. 

The main idea of the doctrine of Hugo de Vries is the abrupt muta- 
tion of living forms. The eminent naturalist does not advance it as an 
a priori proposition; he deduces it from his experiments, and he is 
not afraid of sharply opposing it to the universal view which accepts 
slowly acting causes. In the course of the nineteenth century, geology 
was tossed from the cataclysms of Cuvier and his geological revolutions 
to the slow causes of gradual (^volution pointed out by Sir Charles 
Lyell; and at the present time it is swinging ))ack with Suess toward 
sudden transformations. It is interesting to note that a similar move- 
ment is occurring in ]>i()logy: the attempt of de Vries is one of its 
manifestations. 

A great number of zoologists, ])otanists, and paleontologists are 
inclined to adopt this notion of sudden changes as consonant with the 
teachings of experience. We may cite in this connection the well- 
known argument of Agassiz. This celebrated naturalist called atten- 
tion to the siinultaneous appearance, in the first fossiliferous strata. 



512 A NEW THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. 

of a mixed fauna comprising representations of all the grand divisions 
of the animal kingdom. This is shown in the Upper Silurian or 
Devonian horizon in which the vertebrates make their appearance in 
the form of fish. In the most ancient fauna, and that which has 
become known most recently (that of the Lower Silurian or Cambrian), 
all the grand divisions are still found, except that of vertebrates, each 
represented by quite high t3"pes. It is a question to be decided 
whether, lower down, in the sedimentar}' rocks hitherto considered 
as azoic, there is really a living population, more widely scattered, 
and reduced to the most rudimentary animals and plants — that is to 
say, to protophytes and protozoans, as appears from the researches of 
MM. Barrois, Bertrand, and Caveux. Yet it is none the less certain 
that the ver}- important remark of Agassiz is true, and that, in the 
Cambrian horizon, all the principal tj'pes appear simultaneously. We 
perceive here a sort of explosion of universal life. 

In consequence of this the transformists are obliged to admit that 
in the short space of time that corresponds to the deposit of the most 
ancient fossiliferous rocks the first living beings must have undergone 
all the evolutions necessary for passing from the state of a simple mass 
of protoplasm to that of types characteristic of all the grand divisions, 
the vertebrates only excepted. We are authorized to conclude that 
the time during which the most ancient fossiliferous rocks were 
deposited was short, because we can judge of it from their thickness, 
which is nmch inferior to that of the subsequent strata. Therefore, 
but a comparatively short space of time was required for the modifica- 
tions by virtue of which the first living forms produced the principal 
grand divisions. The Lower Silurian epoch was one of rapid trans- 
formations, of active morphogenesis, of intensive mutations. If we 
w ished to suppose that these wei'e caused by the Darwinian mechanism 
of slow accumulation of minute variations, we would be obliged to 
throw back the origin of life into an epoch inconceivabl}- beyond the 
most ancient geologic epoch now known. 

In the same way, as other paleontologists have observed, among 
wdiom is Dr. Chark'S A. White, the extraordinary flora of the Carbon- 
iferous epoch developed abruptly. We know- nothing or but ver}' 
little of the floras that preceded it. Its appearance and its extinction 
were sudden. 

We might multiply these remarks relative to the abrupt explosions 
of creation in living things. Here is another. The dinosaurian 
lizards that abounded throughout the secondary" epoch, forming. 
indeed, the dominant animal tj^pe, show an extreme variety taken 
from any point of view. There were some gigantic ones, like Bron- 
tosaurus, having a mass that wps certainly equal to that of four or 
five elephants, others of small stature not larger than a domestic fowl. 
The group included carnivora and herbivora, aquatic species and

terrestrial species, quadrupeds, and bipeds quite similar to birds, 
except as to the faculty of liig-ht. By the variety of their types of 
organization the}' form, as apth^ stated by Frederick A. Lucas, a sort 
of epitome of the class of reptiles, ^ow, their appearance and differ- 
entiation were comparatively abrupt and sudden phenomena. It does 
not seem probable that they were formed b}^ the mechanism of natural 
selection and that they were destroj'ed because of their inferiority to 
other species in the struggle for existence. 

We arrive at similar conclusions from an examination of the first 
placental mammals. The}^ appeared abruptly at the beginning of the 
Tertiary period; they assumed a variety of forms almost as numerous 
as those of the mammals of to-dav, and they finally disappeared. 

Besides the paleontologists, many' naturalists have pointed out the 
existence, in animals of our own time, of abrupt variations that pro- 
duce a new type that becomes fixed as soon as it appears, and that has 
the value of a species distinct from that from which it was derived. 
Mivart and Huxle}', Clos, Camerano, and Bateson have called atten- 
tion to the existence of such discontinuous variations, which may afford 
an explanation of the discontinuicy of species. Yet the g'reater num- 
ber of the examples adduced b}^ these authors miiy be referred to the 
category of monstrosities or teratogenic variations which have suc- 
ceeded in becoming fixed. This is the case with species of Asterias 
having numerous arms, with crinoids having three or four divisions, 
with a certain number of levogyrate gastropods. However, abrupt 
transformations have been noted by entomologists under perfectly 
normal conditions. Standfuss, to whom we are indebted for some 
extremely interesting experiments on the heredity in butterflies, 
speaks of "explosive transformation," thus expressing the richness in 
new forms suddenl}' produced from a single parent stock. 

III. 

The origin of the new theory of Hugo de Vries must be sought for in 
this mass of observations, facts, and theoretical ideas relative to the 
abrupt variation of species in opposition to the Darwinian idea of 
slow variation. The Dutch naturalist has, in a manner, worked over 
all these ideas and codified them into a coherent system. This system 
already existed in embryo in the well-known little work which he 
published in 1889 on intracellular pangenesis. His views were, at that 
time, purely theoretical, for he had then only just begun his experi- 
mental verifications. Since then, however, some of his experiments 
have succeeded in an astonishing manner. To-day, therefore, it is the 
views that have been scrutinized and verified which the celebrated 
l)otanist presents to the scientific public in his work on the Theory of 
Mutation, recently published at Leipzig, 



514 A NEW THEOEY OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. 

His doctrine consists, as might be anticipated from wliat ^ve have 
said, in the denial of gradual ti'ansformatidh and the affirmation of 
abrupt transformation. Species in general do not enjoy that per- 
fectly" uniform and monotonous existence which has been assigned to 
them by naturalists of the school of Linnivus and Cuvier. Paleontol- 
ogy teaches us that the}" have a commencement and an end and that, 
during their term, they present periods of two kinds, periods of muta- 
tion and periods of equilibrium, times of calm and times of revolution. 
The observation of existing species contirms this view. 

Ordinaril}" the principal '"period of mutation " is found at the earliest 
stage of the species, at the time of its birth, but this is not absolute. 
However, the phase, or the entire group of phases, of plasticity, is 
more or less brief in comparison with the rest of its existence. It is 
only at these epochs that the living being is susceptible of mutations 
of a specific character; it is unchangeable for the rest of the time, that 
is to say, during the greater part of its term. Because of this the 
period of plasticity or of mutation usualh' escapes attention and we 
observe the greater number of species exacth^ at the moment when 
they have become really invarial^le — that is to say, susceptible only of 
those small, secondary modifications which may, at most, conduce to 
the formation of varieties and races. 

When, on the contrary, the species is in the period of mutation it 
oti'ers an abundance of specific variations, distinct in character from 
the small, individual ones. They are, in fact, abrupt, clearly marked, 
permanent, fixed, and hereditary as soon as they appear, and the new 
forms are infertile when crossed on the parent stock. In a word they 
accomplish a transgression of the limits of a species. 

Such is the new hvpothesis of nmtation. Before detailing the exper- 
iments on which it is founded, and furnishing the justification of its 
accuracy, it would be well to establish its signification, its scope, and 
its consequences. 

This theory- is a sort of rehabilitation of the idea of species. It does 
not, liowever, consider species as the fixed entity, the special and 
innnuta])le category of the Creator's thought, conceived by the natural- 
ists who followed Linna?us. It is trulv a transfoi'mist doctrine; it 
admits the possible existence of an infinite number of species derived 
one from the other. Nevertheless it must not be denied that it confers 
on species an ol)jt'ctive existence, a sort of reality that is foreign to 
the conception of the transformist school. *' Species appear," says 
Hugo de Vries, "like invariable unities, such as are necessary in a 
systematic classification. Their existence is real, like that of individ- 
uals. A species is born, has a short period of youth during which it 
is subject to specific mutation, is maintained in an adult condition 
during a period which mav ^>e of great length, then finally disappears." 

The doctrine of Hugo de Vries is opposed to that of Darwin in 



A NEW THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. 515 

almost every point. The Darwinian theory ha.s for its corner stone 
indiyidual varitition; the new theory, specific mutation, 

Indiyidual variations are progressive, usually guided b}' adaptation 
to the environment in a direction determined by the "survival of the 
fittest." The}' are continuous — that is to say, they are produced at all 
periods. Mutations are quite different. They are metamorphoses, 
not determined by adaptation; they are produced in various wa3's, 
without any direction; they are sometimes injurious, sometimes profit- 
able, sometimes indifferent to the indiyidual — they appear only at cer- 
tain periods of the life of the species. Besides, both of these transfor- 
mations occur from the action of causes which are determinate but 
whose nature is unknown. The first affect, more or less pro- 
foundly, all parts of the organism; the others affect in a special waA' 
the function of reproduction. In the Darwinian theory the first form 
is separated from that which differs from it specific-all}' by a long suc- 
cession of generations. According to Hugo de Vries the first form 
which engenders another, and, ordinarily, many others, coexists side 
by side with this daughter species. It is only after its formation that 
the latter enters into competition with the species from which it 
sprang, and circumstances decide which shall survive and which shall 
disappear. Here the struggle for existence and selection suppresses 
species ))ut it does not create them. In brief, the most characteristic 
feature of nuitation is that it is a manifestation of a physiological 
character, connected by special conditions with the function of repro- 
duction. 

In one point only the two doctrines agree, viz, that very marked 
differences in organization are the effect of the disappearance of inter- 
mediate links. In the case of mutation the new form, although quite 
markedly distinct from the parent one, does not necessarily show great 
divergence from it. Its differences may sometimes be anatomically 
very slight, although they are physiologically very marked, since they 
inhibit any crossing. Great morphological divergences always result, 
as in the theory of Darwin, from a series of repeated mutations. These 
changes are, however, crowded together in a time relatively short, 
since newly formed species are, at the very moment of their formation, 
in their phase of plasticity, in their crisis of mutation. 

IV. 

We have now to state the evidence in favor of this doctrine and the 
foundations on which it rests. We may count in its favor the advan- 
tage of its reconciling the transformist hypothesis, which is neces- 
sarily logical, with the inunutability of species, which is, according to 
de Vries, a proved fact. It succeeds in doing this, as has been seen, 
by supposing that there is in the life of the species a period of crisis, 
so to speak — a temporary period of mutation which interrupts for 



51<> A NEW THEORY OF THE OKIGIN OF SPECIES. 

a ([uite brief period the habitual invariability. In this it harmonizes 
with Darwin to a certain extent. 

Hugo de Vries considers that the existence and invariabilit}' of species 
are facts supported by daily observation. He refers to the memorable 
experiments of Jordan and his followers, who made thousands upon 
thousands of sowings of vegetable species and never observed the 
passage of one into another — that is to sa}', a true vegetal mutation; 
they only obtained ditferences now classed under the head of indi- 
vidual variations. These, as is well known, are of such a nature that 
if we avoid artificial isolation, segregation, and selection, the forms 
revert to the primitive type. It is vain for transformism to deny this 
remarkable tixity and to replace it by an h5^pothesis of changes so 
slow, so miiuite, and so gradual that they become evident only after 
the lapse of centuries, and inevitably escape our observation at the 
moment. 

Another fact that accords with the theory of mutation is the exist- 
ence, in certain genera, of animals and plants of a great number of 
species that differ from each other but little anatomically. Botanists 
are aware that most Linntean species are groups of living forms that 
are constant, hereditary, and usually infertile when crossed; that is to 
say, they are specifically distinct. Yet they differ so little in their 
aspect that many naturalists mistake them or confound them with each 
other. It would appear as if, at a given moment, in a crisis of muta- 
tion, the parent stock had become resolved into a multitude of sec- 
ondary species which have persisted. For instance, the group of roses 
contains more than a hundred wild species so similar to each other 
that the most experienced connoisseurs make mistakes in their deter- 
minations. The thorn bushes, the willows, and the Alpine gentians 
are other examples of the same peculiarity, as are also the pansies and 
the sunflowers. In the animal kingdom many genera of insects pre- 
sent the same phenomena. 

These, however, are merely agreements. H. de Vries has not con- 
tented himself with noting them; he has sought direct proofs of his 
hypothesis. The best one would bo to iind a plant that was actually in 
its period of mutation and that might beget, by means of seeds, a 
number of daughter plants in which there should abruptly appear the 
characters of a new species. We may readily apprehend the principles 
which would guide him in his researches. It would be necessary to 
experiment with genera of wild plants that have a large number of 
closely related species. Jordan has, indeed, established the fact that 
the greater number of wild species now found in Europe are specifically 
immutable. Yet it is possible that they may not all be so and that 
some may, at the present time, be undergoing a crisis of mutation. 
There would be more chance of finding such among the species that 
present a great many subspecies, this being a sign of plasticity leading 



A NEW THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. 517 

to the presumption of mutation. H. de Vries. therefore, experimented 
with 100 phmts that satistied this condition — centauries, asters. c3"no- 
glossi, carrots, etc. He chose seeds from those which were distin- 
guished by some peculiarity or deviation, liice fissuration of the leaves, 
ramification of the spines, etc. He arranged for the sequestration of 
the plant as soon as the peculiarit}' appeared, and ))efore tlowering. In 
order to avoid hj'bridization he enveloped the floral beds with bags of 
transparent parchment and fertilized the flower with its own pollen. The 
greater number of his attempts failed. Onh^ one fully succeeded, that 
which related to the onagra of Lamarck, the Oenothera lamarckiana. 

This plant is well known as the biennial onagra, or ass's herb, 
brought from Virginia to Europe in 1613. It is a tufted, herbaceous 
plant about a meter in height, with simple leaves bearing some resem- 
blance to an ass's ear, whence the name of the plant. It has handsome 
flowers, usually yellow in color. Its red tap root (red rampion) is 
edi])le. Introduced into Holland, it became acclimated and is culti- 
vated there; it also grows there in a wild or uncultivated state, escaped 
from gardens and from cultivation. 

One species of this genus, the onagra of Lamarck {Oenothera 
lamarcMana)^ was especially abundant around the little city of Hil- 
rersum. Now, in 1875 it was noticed that in this district this species 
showed unusual vigor and a remarkable power of multiplication and 
dispersion. Varieties were multiplied in profusion, and there was, 
therefore, reason to suppose that the plant was in its plastic crisis, in 
its period of mutation. H. de Vries cultivated it in his experimental 
beds at the botanical garden of Amsterdam, not for the purpose of 
favoring the production of organic forms by means of culture, but 
because by this means such forms could be preserved, aided, protected, 
and given more chances of maintaining themselves. The sowings were 
continued and the plants were observed during a period of fourteen 
3^ears, from 1886 to 1900. In 1887 a new type made its appearance. 
In 1888 there were already two new species. In 1900, after eight gen- 
erations, H. de Vries had obtained, from 50,000 plants produced from 
his several sowings, 800 new individuals belonging to 7 undescribed 
species. There are, then, 800 individuals in 50,000 that are under- 
going speciflc transformation. The activity of the mutation which this 
plant exhilpits is, therefore, expressed b}^ 1\ per cent. 

The new species do not at all resemble the varieties of the parent 
stock. They appeared suddenly, without preliminary or intermediate 
forms. The care devoted to these experiments gives them a value 
which must attract the attention of naturalists. Their result furnishes 
a new and powerful argument in favor of the theory of mutation. 



THE EVOLUTION OF THE HUMAN FOOT.'^ 



Bv M. Anthony. 



If it were possible for ii.s to turn Ixick some thousands of centuries 
and find ourselves, with our present form and intelligence, suddenly 
transported to a geologic epoch long since passed awa}-, and into the 
midst of the fauna of the Middle Tertiary epoch, we would l)e unable 
to restrain our curiosit}' or moderate our astonishment. 

We should see, gamboling and sporting upon the plains, the ances- 
tors of our present ungulates, and we ma}" well belieye that in the 
deep forest shades we should encounter, together with great carniyora, 
beings similar to the anthropoids that liye to-day in the forests of 
equatorial Africa and Malaysia, covered with hair, with prehensile 
feet, prominent mandibles, and uttering inarticulate cries. 

We should doubtless pass them by without supposing that they 
could possibly be in anj" way related to ourselves. 

How could we suppose, indeed, that beings so different from our 
present form could be the ancestors of man, whose intelligence has 
finally enabled him to bring under subjection the rest of the animal 
world !; 

Nevei'theless, the recent progress in comparative rational anatomy, 
as well as in embryology and paleontology whose results continually 
tend to supplement and confirm those of that science, enables us to say 
that it is no longer absurd to suppose that our ancestors lived upon 
trees, that they were covered with hair, and lacked the faculty of 
speech. We no longer have to rely upon our imagination alone to 
support the doctrine that there was a common arboreal ancestor from 
which sprang both man and the anthropoids, and who must have 
immediately preceded Pithecanthropus upon the earth. Although 
this ancestor has not 3'et ])ecn placed before us by paleontological 
discoveries, Hfeckel has, in anticipation, named it " Prothylobates.'" 
We have every reason to think that he must have been very nuichlike 
existing anthropoids; similarly adapted, without doubt, to an arboreal 
life, in which direction the anthropoids have improved; like them, 
therefore, he must have had a pi-ehonsile foot and the bestial face 
which prominent jaws combined with a relativel}" small brain would give. 

What necessity has intervened to cause a modification of these forms ? 
How was the adaptation to terrestrial locomotion effected? What

course did it follow? What organ preceded the others and led to 
their gradual moditication ? Such are the questions that arise, and 
we may readil}' see that they deal with a very complex problem. The 
researches made during- the last few years in comparative anatomy, 
though they may not enable us to give a linal answer to these ques- 
tions, at least permit us to form serious h} potheses, and 1 think that 
we are now authorized to suppose that, in the series of successive 
moditications, the foot and the lower limbs have played a predominant 
part. We may, then, according to the opinion expressed by M. Man- 
ouvrier in his remarkable studies on the Pithecanthropus, consider 
that the following were the successive steps of this evolution: 

Impelled by a necessity whose causes we can not now determine, 
and which were, perhaps, due to changes in the fauna, the flora, or the 
climate, our ancestors nuist, apparently, have descended by insensible 
degrees from the trees and become accustomed to live on the ground. 
In order to effect an adaptation to this new kind of existence, the 
pelvic limb was naturally the first to be modified; the mobility of the 
toes had to be diminished, the great toe to become less and less oppos- 
able. It was also necessary that the knees should become straighter; 
that the movement of the joints should be amplilied and, at the same 
time, that the distal insertions of the ischio-ti))ial nuiscles should be 
shifted to a higher position; it was necessary that the femur should 
be lengthened, should acquire force. These moditications in the pelvic 
limbs, which put them in advance of the rest of the organism, had at 
the same time the adv^antage, as M. Manouvrier also remai'ks, of allow- 
ing the thoracic limbs to become adapted in a more perfect manner 
to the functions of prehension and to become gradual!}' transformed 
into those highly improved organs that w^e now possess; they also 
permitted the head to be raised and moved about in every direction, 
opening a way in brief to all the other moditications. 

By this series of moditications it resulted that, at the end of the 
Tertiary, during the Pliocene^ epoch, our arboreal ancestor was trans- 
formed into an animal presenting, from certain points of view, vague 
resemblances to the gibbon of the present day, and which seems to be 
represented, according to the opinion of the most competent anato- 
mists, by PithecanfJiropus erect us^ that form whose remains were found 
In Java a few years ago. Even a superficial examination of the femur 
of this creature shows that it was no longer a climber, but already a 
walker in the full sense of the term, although it must have possessed, 
more than the men of the present day, features of resemblance to its 
ar})oreal ancestor. 

The passage from this ancestral type to man was easy, and it was 
probably effected either at the end of the Pliocene or the beginning of 
the Pleistocene.

Such seems to me to be the orig-in and course of the evohition of our 
species in its hiter stages. 

In order to prove to you the former arboreal condition of man, by 
placing before you some of the vestiges of his past that he still retains, 
I have thought that I could not do lietter than to choose the compara- 
tive study of the skeleton of his foot, that organ which was so pro- 
foundly modified at the time of the transition from an arboreal to 
a terrestrial life, and whose moditications seem to have determined

researches. 

The skeleton of man's foot contains 
a certain number of bones, which should 
be classified as follows: 

Tar.sHs: Calcaueum, astragalus, scaph- 
oid, first, second, and third cuneiform, 
cuboid. 

3£et< (tarsus : First, second, third, 
fourth, and fifth metatarsal. 

Phalanges: Hallux (2), second digit 
(3), third digit (3), fourth digit (8), 
fifth digit (3). 

If we follow, from the beginning of 
anatomical science, the w^ork that has 
been done on the osteology of the foot 
of man and of the primates generalh', 
we shall find that, at the end of the 
eighteenth century, the study of the 
human foot was already advanced, 
owing to the work of the anatomists 
of the middle ages and of the begin- 
ning of the modern period; the foot 
of the monkey, the only animal that 
could give us an approximate idea of 
our arboreal ancestors, was, on the con- 
trary, almost unknown, and all comparison was therefore impossible. 
Daubenton and Camper were the first who took it up in a methodical 
manner, although it seems that Linruieus, who in his celebrated classi- 
fication of the animal kingdom grouped the monkeys with man in the 
same order of primates, had alread}^ recognized the similarities that 
occur between the simian foot and our own. 

Tt was, however, with Cuvier that the era of comparative and sys- 
ttnnatic anatomical studies really opened, and in his works we begin

to tind most important information rogardino- the foot of primates 
other than man. 

Still, oiving- to the anatomical facts which he had observed a false 
interpretation, he thought that he was authorized to change the old 
Ijinna?an classification, disrupting the order of the primates and 
creating from part of it the order quadrumana, comprising the 
monkey's or four-handed animals, contrasting with them the bimana, 
comprising man, who alone is possessed of two hands and two feet. 

It was an unhapp}' innovation, seeming to placeman in a class apart 
from the animals that most closely resemlde him and which really form 
with him a natural group. 

After the" work of Cuvier we should cite that of Meckel and De 
Blainville, who followed the road marked out by the mastei-, then 
Vrolik, whose Treatise on the Anatomy of the Chimpanzee (18^11) con- 
tains a comparative study of the foot of the higher primates. 

This author gives information as to the much less solid structure of 
the tarsus of the anthropoids, the relative length and inclination of 
the astragalus, the more or less oblique direction of the articular facet 
of its head. He mentions, also, the special resemblance which exists 
between the calcaneum of the gibbon and that of man, and it is very 
interesting to note that he ventures to point out how defective, by 
reason of the confusion it creates, is the appellation quadrumanna, 
generally current at that time. 

In 1853, Burmeister began the study of the foot of the races of 
man. It is about this time that a strong impulse was given to com- 
parative anatomy by the transformation hypothesis. This naturally 
affected the history of the osteology of the foot, and, in 1863, Huxley, 
in his famous work, Man's Place in Nature, expressed very clearly 
his objections to the term quadrumana, and restored man to his place 
in the order of primates. At the same time Wyman discovered that 
in the human embryo the great toe, instead of being parallel to the 
others, makes, at a certain period of development, an angle with 
them, as in the monkeys, an observation which, as one may well 
believe, was specially calculated to break down the theory that the 
lower extremity of monkeys could not be compared with that of 
man; the same peculiarity was later noted by Leboucq. 

It was at this time that our illustrious founder, Broca, published his 
Discourse Concerning Man and Animals. He there specially insisted 
on the existence, in apes, of a veritable foot, and in 1869 he treated 
definitely in his Order of Primates the question of the hand and the 
foot, finally replacing man in a position beside the anthropoids, the 
place which belongs to him, in spite of the arguments. of Luca?, who 
still thought that the denomination bimana should be preserved. 

In Germany the study of the comparative anatoni}' of the foot was

continued, and it is worth}' of note that, in 1878, Aeby showed that 
the astragalus of the newl)ovn child is intermediate between that of 
an adult man and that of a gorilla. 

Since that period the (jferman anatomists have followed a new road. 
MM. Bardeleben, Pfitzner, and Thilenius have interested themselves in 
the study of the supplementary and accidental bones of the tarsus 
which the older anatomists erroneously considered as sesamoids, show- 
ing their significance by noting their presence in other types of ani- 
mals, thus opening to their successors a fecund mine of new reseai'ches. 

Finally, among the most recent, works, there remain to be cited 
those of Schotl'hausen, who, in 1884, studied the foot of the savage 
races of men; of M. Sarazin, who made remarka,J)]e studies of the foot 
of the Veddahs, those ancient inlial)itants of the island of Ceylon, who 
seem, from all points of view, to be the men who most nearly approach 
the anthropoids of to-day; of MM. Manouvrier, Topinard, andTestut, 
authors of man}^ studies of the skeletons of prehistoric men. 

One of our most learned colleagues, M. Volkov, has attempted a 
monographic study of the skeleton of the human foot. He wished to 
reach a final solution of the problem, and to show how, by investi- 
gating a single organ, judiciousl}' chosen, it would be possible to prove 
the arboreal habits of our ancestors, and he seems to have succeeded 
perfectly. His work is still unpublished, but he has been good enough 
to place at my disposal his manuscript and his remarkable collection 
of drawings and photographs, permitting me thus to give 3X)U the 
earliest glimpse of his work." I am going to give you the results of 
his researches and to tell you, supporting myself on the arguments he 
has furnivshed and upon his measurements, how we should regard the 
human foot at the present time. 

The study of the human foot, undertaken for the purpose of throw- 
ing light upon the problem of the origin of man, seems to me to be 
rationally divisible into three parts: 

First. A part relating to comparative anatomy, in which the foot of 
man in general, or that of men of difl'erent races in particular, is 
examined and compared with that of other animals in order to deter- 
mine the characters by which thev resemble each other. 

Second. An embryological part, in which the foot of man is exam- 
ined during a period of its development in order to ascertain whether, 
at any particular stage, it resembles the foot of animals. 

Third. A paleontological part, in which the foot of men of prehis- 
toric races is examined in order to determine whether it possesses any

In the greater number of eases I have confined myself to stating the facts without 
giving measurements. These would not be suitable for a lecture, and, besides, M. 
Volkov will soon publish them in detail.

characters b}^ which it resembles more closely the foot of animals than 
does the foot of existing man. 

If the foot of man presents marked resemblances to a foot adapted 

for arboreal life, if these 
characters are marked among 
the inferior races, the fetus 
or the child, and prehistoric 
man, we have reason to think 
that the human foot is derived 
from the arboreal tvpe. M. 
Volkov treats oid}^ of the 
comparative anatomy, merely 
touching upon the embry- 
ology. 

The study of the human 
foot taken as a whole, with- 
out separating it into its com- 
ponent parts, furnished M. 
Volkov no important infor- 
mation relative to the historj' 
of its development.

by their being obliged to grasp branches, sometimes of large caliber, 
he sought to ascertain whether men of the so-called inferior races 
have, as might he expected, feet relatively longer than those of Euro- 
peans, thus approaching in that character an ancestral. arl)oreal type. 

He w^as unable to record any positive results in this 
respect, the individual differences being more consid- 
erable than the differences of races. 

In the same way, having noticed that the feet of 
ar]H)real living animals are narrower than those that 
walk, in which the l)ase of sustentation has to be as 
solid as possible, he thought he might tind that the 
foot of the inferior races was narrower than that of 
Europeans. 

As a matter of fact, the contrary is the case, and 
the greatest relative width of feet occurs among the 
negritos, a circumstance explained by the very ni;. rked 
divergence of the great toe, one atavistic character 
masking another. 

On the other hand, the human foot surpasses in relative height that 
of the arboreal animals; he found that, in this respect, the foot of the

negro occupied a position intermediate between the arched foot of the 
European and that of the gorilla, 

M. Volkov quickl}" realized that a study of the foot pursued in this 
way would give him but meager results; without further delay he 
immediately undertook a separate study of the different parts, bone 
b}^ bone. We will follow him in this investigation. Still, since our 
time is limited, I will confine m3^self to the consideration of the three 
most important elements of the tarsus — the calcaneum, the astragalus, 
and the scaphoid — which will enable us to clearly understand the arch 
which gives to the human foot its mechanical perfection and what we 
are accustomed to call its beauty. My method of procedure will be 
as follows: After having indicated to you the architectural features 
that characterize an adaptation to arboreal life — that is to say, the fea- 
tures of the simian foot — and those which characterize an adaptation 
to the biped and plantigrade method of walking — that is to say, those 
of the human foot — I shall show 
you in what respects the feet of 
new-born children and of men 
of the inferior races possess in 
a higher degree than ours traits 
of resemblance to the feet of 
arboreal animals. These traits 
of resemblance can only be ves- 
tiges of our past, still persisting 
in the lower ranks of our spe- 
cies and which have disappeared 
with us, our foot seeming to 
have attained the maxiuuim of 
perfection for the function it is 
to fultill. 

Astragal UK. — The total length 
of the astragalus is less in the climbers than in the walkers, 
its minimum length is found among the lower races. The 
true as regards its height. 

The most important character, however, that M. Volkov has studied 
in the astragalus is the angle of divergence of its head. The cause of 
this divergence, upon which it closely depends, is evidenth' the same 
in all the pentadactylate vertebrates; it is the divergence of the first 
cuneiform, the first metatarsal, and the great toe, which together form 
a united whole. Now this divergenci; is, as is well known, considera- 
ble among climbers in general, and in particular among monkeys, 
whose feet are adapted for the function of grasping. In man, on the 
contrary, adapted for biped locomotion, the first toe is placi^l against 
the other toes; its mobility would impede walking, and the astragalus, 
instead of being movable, as in the climbers, becomes the support of

the weig'ht of the body, the keystone of the plantar arch. The angle 
of divergence of the head of the astragalus is therefore but slight.

Besides its divergence, the head of the astragalus also shows a cer- 
tain amount of torsion corresponding to the position of the first toe,

different, consequently, in the ar])oreal and the walking races; and in 
this, too, the lower races of men hold an intermediate position. 

Calcaneuiii. — The studies of M. Volkov relating to the calcaneum 
were particularly interesting. He first saw that the length of the cal- 
caneum relative to that of the foot had a direct relation to the aptitude 
for walking. It is markedl}" shorter in the climbers than in the walk- 
ers, and among the monkey's it is those that sometimes walk, like the 
macaques and the cyncocephali that have the longest calcaneum. As to 
the anthropoids it increases in length from the orang, who does not walk 
at all, to the gorilla, as follows: Orang, gibbon, chimpanzee, gorilla. 

The orang has, indeed, a calcaneum shorter than any of the monke3^s; 
he is also, as is well known, more aboreal in his habits than perhaps 
an}^ other of the primates. 

As to the races of man, it might have ]>een foreseen that the primi- 
tive ones would have a calcaneum shorter than the higher ones; that 
is, in fact, what M. Volkov has shown, and establishing for an index 
the relation between the length of the calcaneum and that of the foot

M. Volkov has also compared the posterior breadth of the calcaneum 
with the length of the foot and of the calcaneum itself. This breadth 
is proportionatel}^ less in climbers than in walkers, 
the Pitheci surpassing the Cebidte in this respect, 
and man surpassing the anthropoids. When stud- / ut 
ied in the human species this ratio is found to be 
relativeh' greater in Europeans than in persons 
belonging to the primitive races. New-born Euro- 
peans resemble in this respect the lower races, even 
standing between the chimpanzee and the gorilla. V,— >.».__^.^/^ 
The lesser process of the calcaneum, the sus- / ^ S.

monkeys that walk than in those that are exclu- 
sively arboreal, among the Pitheci than among the r \ ^^.c 

Cebidffi. Among the anthropoids the orang has .

arch it is set farther up in man than in inonkevs, and we see again 
that the Melanesian, for example, has in this respect an intermediate 
position between the gorilla and the European.

to be a transition between civilized man and the anthropoid. Reo^ard- 
ing-.the height there is an interesting fact to which I desire to call 
special attention, namely, that the height of the heel in Hylobates is 
very near that of man. This fact, connected with certain others, 
justifies us in giving special attention to the foot of the gibbon, an 
animal which in many respects approaches man, and it led Dubois, 
in his first memoir on Pithecanthropus, to compare the gibbon at once 
to that ancestor. The gibbon even surpasses in this respect the 
Veddahs, the negritos, and the negroes, as well as new-born children 
of our own race. 

Another very important matter to Avhich M. Volkov has directed his 
attention is the angle of inclination of the calcaneum. This angle of 
inclination, or rather the position of the calcaneiun relative to the sur- 
face of the ground, has consideral)h^ influence on the formation of the 

arch, and consequently is 
contributory to all the 
variations just mentioned. 
In the lower apes, as well 
as in the anthropoids who 
have no well-marked arch, 
the calcaneum is placed, 
as it were, flat on the 
ground— that is to say, no 
angle of inclination exists. 
In the inferior races it is 
very small, and its mini- 
mum is reached in the 
Veddahs {S = 3° — $ = 
10") and the negroes ( S 
- 6° ~ 9 —4°). In new- 
born Europeans it does 
not exceed 5°; its maximum is attained in adult Europeans in whom 
it is 14° for the male, 16- for the female. You will understand the 
great importance of this character; the inclination of the calcaneum 
is, 1 repeat, one of the principal elements of the plantar arch, the 
characteristic of the plantigrade, walking foot. Desiring, for clear- 
ness' sake, to treat, while speaking of the arch, of other characteristics 
of the calcaneum, 1 will examine onl}" one more interesting feature of 
this bone, that of the articular facets for the astragalus found on the 
antero-internal surface. The older anatomists sometimes recognized 
two of these facets, sometimes one only. In his Traite d'anatomie M. 
Testnt admits but one, which is sometimes, he says, divided into two 
by a transverse furrow. 

M. Volkov has sought for the cause of this variation and has tried 
to determine its ethnic value. Following Camper, who had already 
remarked that the calcaneum of ncw-l)orn children has always two

of the calcaneum and the longitudinal arch). 



THE EVOLUTION OF THE HUMAN FOOT. 529 

antero-internal facets on the astragalus, M. Volkov showed that 
monkeys possess the same peculiarity. In the chimpanzee and the 
gorilla, however, there is a distinct tendency for these facets to become 
united. The same tendency is observed in bears and all walking ani- 
mals; finally in man, and especially in man of the so-called higher 
races, it is not rare to find the two facets completely blended, a feature 
less commonly found elsewhere. The separation of the antero-internal 
facets should be considered an atavistic character. 

Scaphoid. — As M. Volkov has well remarked, the variability of this 
bone essentially depends upon that of the astragalus and first cuneiform 
which itself has a relation with the development, separation, and mobil- 
ity of the first metatarsal and the first toe, which are, as is well known, 
characteristic of the tree-dwelling animals. 

In the American monkeys, whose foot is especially adapted to an 
arboreal life, and who consequently have quite a mobile great toe, the 
inner edge of the scaphoid is very thick. It is less so in the monkeys 
of the Okl World, who are even 
surpassed in this respect by the 
orang among the anthropoids. In 
the lower races of man the inniM' 
border of the scaphoid — that is to 
say, its tul)erosity (whose real 
significance, we may say in pass- 
ing, has been so well determined 
by M. Volkov) — is markedly bet-

on the fact that with them the first toe, together with the head of the 

astragalus, is much less divergent. 

M. Volkov has also directed his attention to the glenoid cavity hy 
which the scaphoid articulates with the astragalus. He saw very 
clearl}' that this articular facet is, as one might expect, ovoid and 
much elongated from without, inward, in climbers, square, on the 
contrai'v. and slightly elongated in walkers. He established, for this 
articular surface, an index which increases from the climbers to the 
walkers, that is to say, among the monkeys from the Cebidse to the 
Pitheci, Among anthropoids the orang appears to present, in this 
regard, an inexplicable anomaly; though he is the most arljoreal of 
his class he possesses an index higher than the others; this exception 
is, however, easy to understand and even confirms, in my opinion, in 
a remarkable w^ay, the general rule al)ove enunciated. The orang is, 
indeed, the most arboreal of the anthropoids, and, on this account he 
shows a marked tendency toward an atrophy of the fii'st toe (the first 
digit of the hand is likewise absent in a certain number of species of 
the ])rimates, notably in the Colobus, one of the most characteristic 
arboreal Cebidte). We are thus able to explain wh}- the orang. 




530 THE EVOLUTION OF THE HUMAN FOOT. 

beeau.se of the very fact that he is ai-boreal to a supreme deg-ree, pos- 
sesses a reduced g-leuoid cavity; in man the primitive arrangement, 
that is to say, the one which is analogous to that of the arboreal animals 
is again found, as may 1)6 supposed, in negroes and the greater number 
of negritos, and the arrangement adtii)ted to plantigrade locomotion 
belongs to the European. 

It is strange to lind that this peculiarity of the European foot, dis- 
tinguishing it from that of the negro, recurs in certain rodents and 
marsupiids of a primitive type. This nuist doubtless have piqued the 
curiosity of M. Volkov; he has, it seems to us, completely solved the 
enigma. The animals of primitive types have an extra bone, the 
external tibial, which in primates is fused with the scaphoid and forms 
its tuberosity. This explains the greater transverse dimensions which 
the scaphoid, has in apes. In man, because of adaptation to walking, 
the scaphoid is reduced, and though it still possesses, coossitied with 
it, the external tibial, it has assumed the reduced dimensions and the 
appearance of the autonomous scaphoid of primitive manuuals. 

1 shall content myself with this too rapid and incomplete examina 
tion of these three most important elements of the human foot, and 
hasten on to a consideration of the foot as a whole, the real synthetic 
portion of M. Volkov's work. 

Considering- as a whole the foot, not merely of man alone but of all 
animals that walk upon their soles, such as the bear, for example, and 
one of a very remote class, the armadillo, we see that it is greatly 
differentiated from that of animals who use it but seldom, or not at 
all, for walking. Among the latter the skeleton of the tarsus is 
greatly lacking in solidity, the ligaments are relaxed, and the bones 
have rounded articular facets denoting movements of considerable 
amplitude. On the contrar}', the tarsus of a plantigrade, such as man, 
is formed of angular bones with nearly ilat articular surfaces, bound 
together by powerful ligaments, an arrangement indicating that its 
movements are very restricted. 

It is the same with the toes. In arboreal monkeys they are very 
movable, the first is even opposable, while, in man, they remain bound 
together. 

In the most arboreal monkeys, as is remarkably well shown in the 
orang, the metatarsals and the phalanges are bent, presenting a con- 
cave surface on the plantar aspect, an arrangement adapted for 
grasping branches; in man they are almost straight. Besides these 
characters, the foot of man has another important peculiarity which 
also assists in giving it the solidity required for plantigrade walking; 
that is, its arched condition. 

The monkeys not adapted for walking have a flattened foot, and, as 
is well known, support themselves upon its outer border whenever 
they attempt: to progress along the ground. 



THE EVOLUTION OF THE HUMAN FOOT. 



531 



In man, on the contrarv, the foot is arched and rests flat on the 
ground in standino- and walking. 

It is this arch which, acting as a sort of spring, enables the foot, as 
may easil}" 1)6 understood, to support a considerable weight;^' it is, 
then, an improvement made with a view to walking, therefore it is not 
peculiar to man alone, and exists well developed in plantigrade animals 
who have considerable weight of body in comparison with the surface 
of the astragalus. The armadillo has a well-marked arch. M. Casse, 
in a very good paper on the ontogenetic development of the foot, 
compares the human foot to a tripod whose points of support would 
be the calcaneum and 
the heads of the first 
and fifth metatarsal 
bones, and whose ^.. 
summit, a broad cur- 
V i 1 i n e a 1" surface 
arched in t\vo direc- 
tions, would be occu- 
pied by the astrag- 
alus. 

It is the astragalus, 
indeed, that transmits 
the weight of the 
body to the tripod. 
In order that the sys 
tem mux be in equi- 
librium it is evidently 
necessary that this 
astragalus should l)e 
situated in the l)isec- 
tor of the angle whose 
apex is foi-med ])y 
the posterioi' point of 
support C. This is 
precisely what occui's 
in man, whose foot is 
perfectly adapted to biped, j^lantigrade walking. M. Volkov noted 
that, among the primates, the development of this arch is in direct pro- 
portion to the more or less perfect adaptation to plantigrade walking. 

He studied separately the transverse arch and the longitudinal one. 
First he calculated the value of the transverse arch l)y measuring and 
comparing the actual lu-eadth of the tarsus following its curvature 
from without inward, with the same breadth taken l)v projection; he

thus found that the weakest transverse arch is that of the orang-, Avho 
never walks. In man, too, the minimum is represented, as before, by 
the men of the inferior races, the Australians and the negritos, the 
averag-e by negroes and the maximum by Europeans (see fig, 10). 

For the longitudinal arch, whose value was obtained by measuring 
the distance from the summit to the base of the arch, the foot being 
placed tiat on the ground. ]M. Volkov arrived at the same results; at 
the bottom of the scale are the Veddahs. the neg-ritos and the negroes, 
and at the top the Europeans; the foot of the European having the 
maximum of convexity. 

M. Volkov has also studied the evolution of this arch, in^^estigating* 
how the flat foot of the tree dweller became such a structure as M. 

Casse has described, and the morpho- 
logical changes of its constituent parts 
that have ensued because of the devel- 
opment of the convexit}". 

One of the principal consequences of 
the formation of the arch has been the 
inclination of the heel to the ground, 
which we have airead}' studied, and 
which, as would })e supposed, varies 
directly as the degree of convexity, '' 
this modification also occasioning a dis- 
placement of the insertion of the Achilles 
tendon.

projection diminishes as the arch increases; this well-established fact explains the 
apparent contradiction between these results and the opinion generally expressed 
that the negroes have a longer heel than Europeans. As M. Volkov has shown, the 
men of the so-called inferior races have in reality, anatomically speaking, the cal- 
caneum as a whole (and the heel itself) about eqiial to that of the Europeans when 
that bone is measured by itself and detached from its neighbors, but physiologically, 
since, as every one knows, we ought always in mechanics to measure the arm of the 
lever, it is longer in projection, which explains, as may l)e added parenthetically, 
the reason why the gastrocnemius muscle is longer and slenderer in the negro, 
shorter and thicker in the European. The well-known theory of M. Marey on this 
subject is completely confirmed by the figures of ]M. Volkov.

foot, this lesser process is set very low, l)eing almost u continuation of 
the inferior surface of the calcaneum. The development of the arch 
in man had for its first eti'ect the raising of this lesser process and then 
a reduction of its dimensions, the astragalus resting directly on the 
bod}^ of the calcaneum because of the approach of the latter to the 
anatomical axis" of the foot. This approach is, in fact, another char- 
acter that varies with the 
development of the arch. 
In the anthropoids the heel 
is pushed strongly outward ; 
in European man its axis 
coincides with the anatom- 
ical axis of the foot, and 
thus attains the position 
mentioned above and rep- 
resented in figure 12. 

Corresponding with the 
inverted position of the 
foot, the axis of the poste- 
rior surface of the calca- 
neum is in tree dwellers 
oblique from above downward and from without inward. As the arch 
becomes more completely formed, this axis becomes more and more 
perpendicular to the ground. It is not jet quite vertical in the Aus- 
tralian, but is so in the European. Men of the inferior races and 
new-born children have in this respect a position between the gorilla 
a id the European adult, and in the arrangement of the diti'erent ele- 
ments of the foot all is so 
well correlated that this 
deviation, more marked in 
anthropoids than in other 
apes, varies as does the 
divergence of the head of 
the astragalus, which is

The adaptation of the arboreal foot to plantigrade walking and the

THE EVOLUTION OF THE HUMAN FOOT. 



cite first the alreacl}^ mentioned diminution, in the arboreal apes, of 
the angle which the bod}^ of the bone makes with its head, and we will 
also cite that peculiar torsion of the head of the astragalus, the major 
axis of which is in man directed from above downward and from with- 
out inward, while it tends to become horizontal in arboreals with feet 
having- no arch, the apparent torsion in man being raanifestlA^ due to 
the approximation of the great toe and the upward thrusting of the 
lesser process of tlie calcaneum. 

Another very important modification is one to which M, Testut had 
the merit of first calling attention; that is, the displacement of the 
axis of the trochlear surface of the astragalus. Since the arboreal 
apes have an inturned foot they have an astragalus whose trochlear 
axis tends to occup}" a position farther and farther from the anatom- 
ical axis. In man, because the foot has changed to a position at right 
angles to the limit, the axis of the trochlear surface tends to approach 
the anatomical axis nearer and nearer; that is to say, to coincide with 
the ])isector of the angle C (fig. 11). By this character, too, the infe- 
rior human races present, as 
always, interesting features of 
T-TTi /ni f^ r resemblance to the arboreal an- 

ili\ / ^ \ \ (^ ^ \ cestors. Since the trochlea of 

the astragalus fits, as is well 
known, into the tibial mortise, 
when its axis is displaced it must 
iiecessarilv involve modifications 
in the position and form of the 
tibia which has for this reason 
suffered a certain torsion from 
without inward, whose efi^ects are shown even as far vip as the femur 
(see fig. 1-i). 

To conclude, the position of the foot is modified by the develop- 
ment of the arch — in climbers the sole is turned inward, in man it is 
flat on the ground. It follows that the inferior tibial mortise must 
look inward in the first, while in the two last it is horizontal, and here 
again the negro stands between the European and the gorilla. 

1 do not wish to abuse 3"our patience longer, but, in terminating 
this too long exposition, in which the great abundance of details, on 
which 1 have been unable to expatiate, has, perhaps, been tiresome 
and difficult to follow, I think it will be useful to recapitulate and to 
sketch, in conclusion, what I understand to have been the course of 
development of the human foot. 

The foot of nionkeys, as you have seen, shows a number of charac- 
ters, which may be summarized as follows: 

It is turned inward, it is flat, its articulations are loose and mol)ile, 
its first toe is mobile and separated. From these general characters 




Fig. 14. — Lower end of the tibia (a, rear view; B, view 
from below). I, Gorilla. 11, Xegro. Ill, European. 



THE EVOLUTION OF THE HUMAN FOOT. 535 

it follows that the upper part of its calcaneum is turned outward aud 
the trochlear surface of its astrag-alus is likew^ise oblique and looks 
outward; it also results from this that its calcaneum is flattened and 
provided with a long lesser process set near the g-round; these occa- 
sion further modifications in the tibia, as we have just seen, and even 
in the femur. 

The foot of man, on the contrary, is placed at right angles to the 
axis of the limb — it is arched, its articulations are almost immovable, 
its first toe is closely attached to the others, all these arrangements 
tending to give the organ the solidity and flexibilit}^ required for 
biped locomotion. To these general features are added others of a 
special character, the principal of which are: The shifting of the cal- 
caneum and the trochlear surface of the astragalus into the anatomical 
axis of the foot, and the torsion of the tibia above mentioned; the 
first feature relates to the arboreal adaptation, the second is the result 
of a gradual improvement with reference to biped and plantigrade 
locomotion. The stages intermediate to these two conditions, which 
we find so clearly marked in the foot of the inferior races of men, 
prove incontostably that our foot is derived from an arboreal foot 
analogous to that of the monkej^s of to-day, our i-emote cousins, 
wdiich has left its traces' in our species. 

Our convictions in this regard are confirmed when we see that the 
foot of new-born infants of our race reproduces the features of that 
of men of the inferior races, often assimilating even nearer than that 
to the arboreal, simian foot, especially to that of the gorilla, which 
appears to be decidedly the most nearly related to the human foot. 
The course of ontogen}^ here again reproduces that of phylogen}^; 
comparative anatomy and embryology once more agree. 

In this investigation one chapter is 3"et wanting or, rather, may seem 
to you insufficiently developed — that is to say, one in which there would 
be investigated the feet of men belonging to the prehistoric races. 
M. Volkov has not 3"et been able to undertake this investigation, but 
it is probable that the results he may obtain by it will merely confirm 
those alread}' secured; we have a right to .suppose this, especially 
since M. Testut has found in the man of Chancelade a separated great 
toe like that of the lower human races of to-day and almost as marked 
as among the anthropoids.

THE NAME MAMMAL AND THE IDEA EXPRESSED/' 



By Theodore Gill. 



One of the most natural of tlie polA^iiorphic groups of the animal 
kino-dom is the class of mammals, but yet it was less than a century 
and a half ago that it was recognized. It was. in fact, the fruit of 
scientitic research and logic and not of ]:)opular recognition. Popular 
and scientitic classifications of the animal kingdom, far from being 
parallel or the one merel}- an extension of the other, have been often 
directly opposed. From the earliest times, the Aryan and Semitic 
peoples at least considered animals in aggregates with reference to 
-the functions exercised rather than with reference to agreement in 
structural details; in the language of the naturalist, they segregated 
them by physiological characters rathei" than morphological ones. 
There was, too, a curious association with what were called the 
''elements" — earth, water, and air. (Fire was without its animals, 
unless the fabled salamander be regarded as one.) This association 
was in olden times generally accepted. It appears in the fJewish tale 
of creation giyen in Genesis (i. 1, 2, 7, 9, 20, 24); it appears in the 
Roman niA'thology perpetuated in Oyid's yerse (Metam., I, lines 5-7, 
21, 22, 72-75). 

In popular natural history, the hairy quadrupeds were associated with 
the scaly and naked ones as quadi'upeds, the sea-dwelling cetaceans 
were combined with the scaly tishes in another class, and the \olaiit 
bats were sometimes grouped with qnadrupeds on account of their 
obyious likeness to mice, except foi' the. wings, and sometimes with 
birds because thej could Hy. So all continued to be grouped through 
the ages. Aristotle did no better, or at any rate little better, than those 
preceding him and those following him for many centuries. The 
assertion of Owen that Aristotle fully recognized the class of mam- 
mals imder the name Zootoca is without proper foundation. Long ago, 
in the American Naturalist (VII, 45S), I showed that ditferent [)assages 
in Aristotle's book negatiyed such a statement and that the wovvi 
zootdka was never used as a substantive. 

«Muoh of the present article was published in September, 1902, in the Popular 
Science Monthly under the caption "The story of a name — Mammals."

588 THE NAME MAMMAL AND THE IDEA EXPKESSED. 

At last a veiy bright English naturalist, the great(\st naturalist ot" 
the seventeenth century, John Ray, was suggestive in this, as in many 
other cases. Ray, in his Synopsis Methodica Aninialiiini Quadni- 
pedum et Serpentini Generis (1093, p. 53), gave an "Animalium tabula 
generalis" in which he bracketed the terrestrial or quadruped niannuals 
with the acpiatic as vivipara, and contrasted them with the ovipara or 
aves. The vivipara are exactly coextensive with what were later called 
mammalia, l)ut the w^ord vivipara was used as an adjective and not as 
a noun. This was a most happy suggestion, but it was long before it 
was acted on or before anyone advanced as far in the appreciation of 
the facts involved. 

Linngeus, the Swedish naturalist, published the tirst edition of his 
Systema iS'atun^ in 1735, and in that and every succeeding edition up 
to the ter>th adopted the idea current for so many generations, so far 
at least as the union of cetaceans with fishes was concerned. But in 
1758 he at last caught on to the idea of Ray and for the first time 
separated the cetaceans from the fishes and combined them with the 
hairy quadrupeds in a special class. There was no name for that class; 
for though Ray had suggested the grouping of the two together, he 
did not propose a collective name. A new^ name, therefore, had to be 
given, and that was "mammalia.'' Some curious mistakes have been 
made respecting this name. 

In the great Centur}' Dictionary, a deservedly esteemed work, and 
which may generally be implicitly trusted, the etymology of mammalia 
is given as "NL. (sc. anlmalia')^ neut. pi. of LL. main ma lis {newt. sing, 
as noun, mammale)^ of the breast: see marninal^'''' and, under mammal, 
we have ^^a. and n. [ = OF. mammal— Sp. mamal — l^g. inanial^ mam- 
mal-— \i. manrmal(\ n.; << NL. ma,mmale^ a mammal, neut. of LL. 
raammaUs^ of the breast, < L. mamma ^ the ])reast]." 

All this is misleading, if not absolutely erroneous. The name 
''mammalia," as just indicated, was first coined and used by Linnaeus, 
and was formed directly from the Latin; it had nothing whatever to 
do with French, Spanish, Portuguese, or Italian words. The concept 
of which the Linna^an wor^ is the expression is as remote from a pop- 
ular notion as could well be, and even the necessity for the word (or 
an analogous one) can be appreciated really only by the educated or, 
pro tanto, the scientifically educated. Buff'on and Pennant, for exam- 
ple, could not realize the reason for its use. 

It is noteworth}^ that, in the Century Dictionary, even the very word 
that might have given the clew to the formation of "■ maumiar' is 
cited, and yet the excellent professional etymologist who worked on it 
was not guided into the right path. With the hint given to him, he 
failed to see the point. Evidently, then, the et3aiiolog3^ is not as 
obvious as it might seem to be. 



THE NAME MAMMAL AND THE IDEA EXPRESSED. 539 

Often, indeed, in looking over etymologies, one must be impressed 
with the insufficiency of philological learning alone for the solution of 
knotty questions. A living knowledge of the objects named, as well 
as of their history, is often requisite for a full understanding of the 
signiticance or aptness of the names. 

It was one of the happiest inspirations of Linnteus to segi'egate all 
the mammiferous animals — the hairy quadrupeds, the bats,' the sire- 
nians, and the cetaceans — in a single class. No one before had appre- 
ciated the closeness of the relations of the several types, and there was 
no name for the new class (or concept) as there was for all his other 
classes. A name, therefore, had to be dev'ised. It was another happy 
inspiration that led Linna?us to name the class "mammalia." Those 
who are familiar with the works and ratiocination, and especially the 
nomenclature, of the great Swede may divine his thoughts and share 
with him in the execution of his ideas, although he did not give 
etymologies. For those '-animalia" whieh are animals par excellence 
he would coin a name which would recall that fact. (Animal, be it 
rememl)ered, is often used in popular converse in the sense of 
manmial.) 

The name in question was evidently made in analogy with animalia. 
In animalia the principal component was aniina^ the vital principle, or 
animal life. (Old Nonius Marcellus well detined and contrasted the 
word — "animus est ([uo sai)innis. anima qua vivinuis.") The singular 
of the word was animal. In manunalia the essential component is 
inanvmK, })reast; the singular should l)e mammal. The terminal 
clement (-al) was coincident with ratlier than derived directly from 
the Latin suffix (-alis) which expressed the idea of resemblance or 
relationship: anyway, it was used in substantive form, and the idea of 
possession or inclusion was involved, as in the case of animal, capital, 
feminal, tribunal — all well-known Latin words. In tine, a mannnal is 
a being especially marked by or n()tal)le for having mannna'. 

The truth embodied in the word was almost immediately appreciated 
by most naturalists at least, and the class of mammals has been adopted 
ever since the Linna?an period by zoologists. Naturally the new 
Latin name was to some extent replaced by names in the veiiiacular 
tongues of most nations. 

In the acconmiodating English alone the Latin word was adopted 
with only a change in its ending, and thus the class name "manmials'' 
was introduced, and the singular form — "mammal" — followed as a 
matter of course, and by chance (or rather the genius of language) 
exactly coincided in form with the singular of the Latin word. 

Not only had the name nothing to do with the alleged derivative 
Latin words — it was not admitted at all into the vernacular speech of 
France, Spain, Portugal, or Italy. The naturalists and lexicographers 



Ti-iO THE NAME MAMMAL AND THE IDEA EXPRESSED. 

of those countries failed even to appreciate its etymological aptness 
and beauty. First, the French had to introduce a new word to cor- 
respond — mamniiferes, or the breast-bearers. Thg other Latin races 
followed; the Spanish and the Portug-uese with nianiiferos, and the 
Italians with mammiferi. None of the words quoted in the Century 
Dictionary are even given as nouns in the ordinary dictionaries of 
those languages — not even in the great dictionary of Littre. Littre, 
however, has the words nuunnialogie, nianimalogique, and niamma- 
logiste. 

Of course the Germans coined a word from their vernacular — 
Saugethiere, or suckling animals. The cognate nations imitated — the 
Dutch with Zoogdieren, the Swedish Avith Diiggdjuren, and the Danes 
and Norwegians with Pattedyrene. 

But, although the English proved ultimately to be so "accommo- 
dating,*" the full acceptance of a name in the vernacular speech was 
long delayed. Very early the equi\alent words had been cordially 
welcomed in the continental languages, l)ut the users of English were 
chary in their admission of foreigners. 

Even the English word in plural form "mannnals'' — was grudg- 
ingly admitted; the Latin form — ''mammalia'' — was long preferred. 
The chief translators of the Regne Animal rendered manmiiferes by 
'■mannnalia;'"' Plyth alone substituted "mannnalians'" in its place. 
Owen, in his Histor}^ of British Fossil Mammals, employed "mam- 
malia" in the text more frequently than "mammals," and yet he used 
the English form more than any of his contemporaries. Popular as 
well as scientific writers avoided the English word as one alien to 
the genius of the language. Some preferred the word "mammifers" 
when they would use an anglicized term. 

By reason of the general ignorance of the etymology of the word 
''mammalia." and the dislike of it on account of the misappreliension 
that it was an imperfect or clipped word, one of the French natural- 
ists devised a substitute — "mammiferes" — and this early took root 
and has been universally adopted by French writers. It was to some 
extent adopted l)y English writers of the first half of the last century 
under the form '' mammifers." Rol)ert Chambers, in his anonymous 
Vestiges of Creation, frequently used it, and Hugh Miller, in his 
antidotes to the heresy of the Vestiges, sometimes did. Miller, in 
his Old Red Sandstone (18-il), also accepted the singular form in his 
statement (Chapter IV) that '"the manmiifer takes precedence of the 
bird, the bird of the reptile, the reptile of the fish." The usie of the 
word, nevertheless, was never general. The derivative adjective, how- 
ever, was much more frequently adopted for a time. 

Lyell, in his Principles of Geology, almost invariably used the 
word " manmialia,'' but accepted the adjective " mammiferous" instead 
of "mammalian" and even of "mammaliferous." (He admitted 



THE NAME MAMMAL AND THE IDEA EXPEESSED. 541 

"mammifer.s'' in his Glossary, but did not otherwise use it.) This, 
naturally, was an example which others followed. It was not until 
the first half of the century had been past for some time that the 
English word came generally into use. 

In the most trivial fiction the Latin '"'mammalia'' was used instead 
of the English " mammals." An example of this may be given, inas- 
much as it will also serve to show how, by accident or design, a pos- 
sible solecism was avoided. Edgar Allan Poe, the precursor of Conan 
Doyle as author of "detective stories,'' in 1841 published a thrilling- 
story of The Murders in the Rue Morgue. The supposititious narrator 
is an American resident in Paris, and has a French friend (M. Dupin) 
notable for the acuteness of his analytical and detective facult3\ An 
unaccountable murder of two Avomen was committed, and the police 
as well as professional detectives of Paris had been unable to i^olve 
the m3^stery. The amateur, M. Dupin, investigated, satisfied himself, 
and explains to his friend his solution. "Read, now," says Dupin, 
" this passage from Cuvier." The American summarizes in his own 
language: "It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive 
account of the large fulvous orang-outang of the East Indian Islands. 
The gigantic stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild 
ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these manmialia are suffi- 
ciently well known to all. I understood the full horrors of the murder 
at once." 

Now, as it was an American that gave the account, it was perfectly 
right, at the time in question, to use "mammalia." But if Poe had 
put that word in the mouth of Dupin, or as emanating from the pen 
of Cuvier, he would have done violence to French usage. The scien- 
tific men of France as well as popular writers always used their ver- 
nacular "mammiferes;" and if the American would have translated 
to represent the French style he should have used "niammifers" or 
"mammals." To have rendered it by "mammalia" (as many would) 
would have been paraphrastic, but not translation of the spirit of the 
French. 

The first writer to use the English word ""mannnals," at least to 
any extent, was Dr. John Mason Good. In his Pantologia (Volume 
VIII, 1818) he formally introduced the English name, under "Mam- 
malia,'' in the following words: 

In English we have no direct synonym fur this term; quadruped or four-footed, 
which has usually been employed for this purpose, is truly absurd, since one of the 
orders have [sic!] no feet whatever, and another offers one or two <^enera that can 
not with propriety be said to have more than two feet. We have hence thought 
ourselves justified in vcrnacularizing the Latin term and translating "mammalia," 
mammals, or breasted animals. 

In Volume XII, in the articles "Quadruped'' and "Zoology." Good 
also used the word "mannnals" apropos of the classification of Lin- 



542 THE NAME MAMMAL AND THE IDEA EXPRESSED. 

neeus, and in other places," and also iu the article on ''Quadruped," 
the adjective "Diammalian." 

The .same Good, in The Book of Nature (1826) and in the second 
lecture of the second series, ''On zoological systems/' again specif- 
ically introduces it. Quadrupeds is not appropriate, "and hence it 
has been correctly and elegantl}^ exchanged by Linnseus for that of 
'mammalia,'" and he concludes, "As we have no fair synonym for it 
in our own tong-ne, 1 shall beg leave now, as I have on various other 
occasions, to render 'mammals.'" He repeatedly used the English 
form elsewhere in The Book. I have been unable to lind any use of 
the word in its singular number^ however. 

The singular form, '' mammal," has been indicated as rare or unusual. 
One might look through many volumes on mammals, as well as on 
general natural history, and not find it. As a matter of fact, however, 
it may be frequently used. Let us go, for example, into a laboratory 
when they are assorting a miscellaneous lot of Ijones gathered from 
some fossil ossuary. Such expressions ma}^ be heard as "that seem^ 
to 1)6 a mammal bone;" "that is a mammal bone;" "that is a m«;/?-- 
mal bone;" ^Hhat is a mammal bone": — or the substantive "mammal" 
alone may be used. Further, a whale may be alluded to as a gigantic 
mammal or a mammal giant. 

The earliest English author to use the singular form, so far as 
known, was Richard Owen. In his History of British Fossil Mammals 
and Birds (1846), for example, he alluded to a mastodon as "this rare 
British fossil mannnar'' (p. xxii), and asserted that he knew "of no 
other extinct genus of mammal which was so cosmopolitan as the 
mastodon" (p. xlii); he said that "the myrmecobius is an insecti- 
vorous mammal, and also marsupial" (p. 40), and he claimed, condi- 
tionally, that "the Meles taxus is the oldest known species of mannnal 
now living on the face of the earth" (p. 111). Robert Chambers, in 
editions of the famous Vestiges of Creation, published afterwai-ds, 
also used the singular number in several cases (e. g.. Harper ed., 
pp. 110, 280), although in earlier editions (1844 et seq.) he used 
"mammifer'' (e. g., p. 103). So, likewise, did Hugh Miller in his 
later works. In an extension of the statement respecting the succes- 
sion of the vertebrate classes already referred to, mammal is used 
instead of mammifer. In the chapter on "final causes" in The Foot- 
prints of the Creator (1847) it is claimed that an increase in size of 
the brain in comparison with the spinal cord is correlative with the 
succession of the animals; after the brains of the fish, reptile, and 
bird, "next in succession came the brain that averages as four to one — 
it is that of the manmial." Elsewhere (Boston ed., p. 238) the singu- 
lar is also used and the plural "mammals" often. 

"The volumes of the Pantologia are not paged, the alphabetical arrangement hav- 
ing been thought to supersede pagination. 



THE namp: mammal and the idea expressed. 548 

But some English authors who were willing to use a \ernacular 
substitute for mammalia would have neither mammals nor mammifers. 

The Rev. William Kirby, in 1835, in the once famous Bridgewater 
treatise On the Power, Wisdom, and (loodness of God, as manifested 
in the Creation of Animals and in the History, Habits, and Instincts, 
declined' to accept either, but invariably used, as the English 
equivalent of mammalia, 'Mnannnalians.''' Chapter xxiv is entitled 
''Functions and instincts. Mammalians;" in this, it is explained, 
''the whole body, constituting the class, though sometimes varying in 
the manner, are all distinguished by giving suck to their young, on 
which account they were denominated by the Swedish naturalist 
'mammalians""' (H, p. 476). In a footnote to this statement, Kirby 
adds, "Cuvier calls them 'mammifers.' Imt there seems no reason for 
altering the original term.''' 

We may cordially indorse the sentiment of Kirby, and, doing so, 
refuse to follow him in action and to adopt his modification of "the 
original term,'' and revert to the genuine original — mammals, or, in 
the singular, mammal. 

No instance of the use of the singular- mammalian — has been found 
in Kirby's work or in any of his successors', nor does the singular 
form ''mannnal" occur in the Pantologia. There is, indeed, one 
instance of its use in the Vestiges of Creation (Harper ed., p. 284); 
but as it was followed by a. plural verb, it was inadvertently used. 

The science which treats of mammals had to l)e named. Mammal- 
og}^ was naturally thought of, but many objected to it. The French, 
who would not tolerate mammal or mammaux, although the\^ had 
no objection to the analogous animal and animaux, on the whole 
took kindly to "mammalogie" or " mammologie." Substitutes, it is 
true, were otfered; Desmarest proposed "mastologie" and De Blain- 
ville " mastozoologie," and the latter was admitted ])y Littre to his 
great dictionary, but they did not secure a permanent foothold, and 
" mammalogie" is the term now generally used. 

The objection to " mammalogy" was and is that it is a hybrid and 
also a badly compounded and clipped word. It is formed of the Latin 
uiannna (a breast or teat) and the Greek sufiix, -Xoyia; the apparent 
meaning is a discourse on breasts rather than breast-bearing animals. 
Greek nouns also generally have the vowel "o" rather than "a" 
before the second component. There is no simple word Xoyia in 
Greek meaning discourse, and the suffix in question is connected with 
the word Xoyo^ or, rather, the verb Xtyco. The only Greek word 
Xoyia (occurring in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, xvi, 1, 2) 
means " a collection for the poor," and therefore Xoyia is misleading 
and has misled several to my knowledge. The Greek words " diko- 
logia," " et^^mologia," "philologia," and "theologia," of course are 



544 THE NAME MAMMAL AND THE IDEA EXPRESSED. 

good pi-ecedent.s for tlie English words ending in "-ology "" and conse- 
quently we nia}^ use, as a suffix, -\6yia (but not simply Xoyin) in 
explanation of the etymology. 

In view of all its faults, suggestions were made to correct the word 
to "mammology '' if not '' mammalology." Others Avould compound 
a name of two Greek constituents {O/jp, a wild beast, and Ao;/o?). 
Therology was the result. Dr. John D. (lodman, in his American 
Natural History (1824), entitled the first (and only published) part 
''Mastology," thus borrowing a word tirst used by Desmarest. The 
writer of the long article on "Mammalia" for the Edinburgh Ency- 
clopedia (1819) coined the word "mazology '' (/,«a'Cos-, a breast, and 
Xoyog^ discourse). None of these words lias found general admis- 
sion into the language. Notwithstanding the philological objections, 
mammalogy -of late years has been generally accepted, and general 
consensus establishes its right of being. 

On a ])revious page it has been affirmed that "animal is often used 
in popular converse in the sense of mammal."" One of the many cases 
that might be cited is furnished by a justly esteemed author in a 
recent number (]\Iarch, 1904) of The Century Magazine. John Bur- 
roughs, in an article "On humanizing the animals" (p. 779), has con- 
trasted the word with birds. He says: ''There seems to be among 
the birds something that is like what is called romantic love. The 
choice of mate seems always to rest with the female, while among the 
(inl)nals the female shows no preference at all.'" As the present 
article is intended only to show the use of words no comments are 
necessary, save to add that Mr. Burroughs excepts from his generali- 
zation "certain l)irds of India and Australia." 

The word animal is made to do duty, in the same article, both as the 
equivalent of the Latin "animalia" and "mammalia." In the larger 
sense it is used (p. 773) apropos of "the wariness of wild creatures" 
and "why tiocks of birds, droves of beasts, and schools of tish act 
with a connnon impulse." To contrast with other classes, "beasts" is 
then the word used in place of "mammals." How much better it 
would ])e to use "mammals" in every case where such ar(> meant. 
Ambiguity would be avoided; precision insured. There is need of 
the word, and English-speaking peoples are as well entitled to its use 
as all the other European nations are to employ analogous words. 



EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ON THE MENTAL LIFE OF 

ANIMALS. " 



By N. Vaschide and P. Rousseau. 



Among- the problems attacked by modern experimental ps^^chologv, 
that of the mental life of animals has a prominent place, all tlie more 
important because upon its solution depends, in a g'reat degree, the 
exactitude of our knowledge concerning the evolution of mental activ- 
ity in the scale of life. 

We know very little about the minds or mental life of animals, 
and the scanty knowledge we possess concerning their intelligence 
is largely mingled with legend. Everyone who owns a dog thinks 
himself a ps3'chologist and that he has made exact observations on 
animal mentality when he brings out a few simple phenomena that 
he calls "experiments." These are the defenders of the old maxim 
of the deep significance of simple observations. 

In another field we note the remarks of professional people, meet- 
ing ever3'where with citations, after the manner of the illustrated 
journals, of thousands of methods of capturing animals, methods 
whose success is believed to indicate the possession by animals of a 
well-developed imagination. It has even been supposed that we can 
follow the complex processes of creative animal imagination! 

In this article we will give an account of the experimental investi- 
gations of the American psychologist, Mr. Edward L. Thorndike. 

I. 

Animal psychology has, up to thi.-5 time, remained in a somewhat 
rudimentary state; those authors who have occupied themselves with 
studies of that nature have a tendency to explairi the mental life of 
animals by associative pi'ocesses. That life being essentially made up 
of reactions to impressions arising (Mnpirically. i)r()duced either by 
the influence of her(Mlitary instincts or the personal experience of 
each animal, it seems umiecessary to appeal to phenomena of al)strac- 
tion and inference and to concepts in order to explain it. Our author 
considers that this general tendency is good. It is not, however, so 
regarded b}' all psychologists, and even those who hold it are still

546 STUDIES ON THE MENTAL LIFE OF ANIMALS. 

inclined to views tliat are too synthetical. We must study the for- 
mation of associations in a more fragmentary and analytical manner. 
We too easily content ourselves with words and vague formulas; it 
is common sense, not the scientitic spirit, the spirit of criticism and 
analysis, that still makes laws in this very special domain of psychol- 
ogy. 1 call my cat to give her a saucer of milk to drink. What is 
the exact series of images developed in her mind from the moment 
when the sound strikes her ear to that when she decides to obey? To 
say that the animal has present in her intelligence a more or less com- 
plex process of association is to be contented with very little. We 
limit ourselves to saying that she does not reason — which appears 
quite evident — and yet that her acts accord with elements other timn 
purely instinctive phenomena. To fix the meaning of the expression 
"process of 'association " as applied to animals, to give it a positive 
signification, to ascertain what processes of this kind can be formed in 
their minds, and of what degree of complexity and delicacy, what 
would be the duration of such processes and the conditions of their 
formation — such is the problem, precise and clearly limited, that Mr. 
Thorndike" set himself to solve. He has given us a clear statement 
of his method and a very complete illustration of it. Two qualities 
are found united in his work: On the one hand, the faculty of making 
us grasp the detail of his facts; on the other, that of bringing out 
clearly the scope and interest that this question presents for general 
and comparative psychology. 

Strictly from the point of view of m('tht)d the older or even con- 
temporary psychology pi-esents a numl)er of grave defects. It tends 
toward a perpetual eulog}' of animals, as- with Romanes, for instance. 
Psychologists are too easily moved to astonishment and admiration. 
This disposition, which tends toward puerility, ends by falsifying tlie 
method itself, l)y leading to the choice of thos'e facts only that excite 
admiration or enthusiasm. A more objective attitude is necessary. 

In the lirst jilace, most of the books do not give us a psychology, but rather an 
eulogy of animals. They have all been about animal intelligence, never about 
animal stupidity. Though a writer derides the notion that animals have reason, he 
hastens to add that they have marvelous capacity of forming associations; that 
human beings only rarely reason anything out; that their trains of ideas are ruled 
mostly by association, as if, in this respect, animals were on a par with them. The 
history of books on animals' minds thus furnishes an illustration of the well-nigh 
universal tendency in human nature to find the marvelous wherever it can. We 
wonder that the stars are so big and so far apart, that the microbes are so small and 
so thick together, and for much the same reason wonder at the things animals do. 
Now, imagine an astronomer tremendously eager to prove the stars as big as possi- 
ble, or a bacteriologist whose great scientific desire is to demonstrate the inicrobesto 
be very, very little. Yet there has been a similar eagerness on the part of many

re(;ent writei> on animal i)syfhokigy to jiraii^e the abilities of aninialy. This can not 
but lead to partiality in deductions from facts and more especially in the choice of 
facts for investigation. How can scientists who write like lawyers, defending 
animals against the charge of having no power of rationality, l)e at the same time 
impartial judges on the bench?" 

Finally, even the writers who might have won valuable results have 
contented themselves with arguing- against theories of the eulogists. 
They have not yet made investigations of their own. 

Further, animal psychology has been hitherto too nuich derived 
from anecdotes; authors cite only those facts that arc exceptional, 
extraordinary, or considered as such, instead of which the normal and 
simplest cases should always be reported. Anecdotes also have the 
disadvantage of being rarely given at first hand. Finally, by their 
very definition they are unverifiable. 

II. 

The method adopted should be an exclusively experimental one, 
and that alone is what Mr. Thorndike has used. It is essentially a 
method of observation and experiment, submitted, as in all such cases, 
to a certain lunnber of constant precautions. It was necessar}' here 
more than elsewhere to av-oid making generalizations from the indi- 
vidual to the species on observations of only a single case, to regu- 
late in a precise manner the conditions of each experiment as far as 
possible, and to use in these experiments only animals whose previous 
historj^ was known, all of which precautions seem to have been 
ignored by preceding psychologists. This objective attitude once 
adopted, there were still some details to be arranged. It was necessary 
to formulate a plan- to establish a certain number of constant points 
which, in the whole series of experiments, would serve as guides for 
the observer. Mr. Thorndike reduces these points to three, fornni- 
lated as the three following questions, which constitute the logical 
structure of the method: 
, 1. What is it the animals inider observation do? 

2. How do they do it? 

3. What do they feel while they thus act?'' 

The theoretical aspect being thus settled, it became necessary to 
determine the material and psychological conditions of the experi- 
ments. The principle kept in view was to select an experiment or 
series of experiments which should be at once simple and at the same 
time significant. From a psychological point of view it was necessar}^ 
to manage so as to have only a restricted num])er of known })sycho- 
logical elements. Our author adopted the following ingenious strat- 
agem: Using for his experiments cats, dogs, and chickens, he deprived 

a Thorndike, pp. 3 and 4. b Thorndike, p. 5. 



548 



STUDIES Oisr THE MENTAL LIFE OF ANIMALS. 



of food for some time — twenty-four hours, for example — the animal 
which was to be the subject of the experiment; then lie shut it in a cage 
having- a grating front; near by, on the outside, food for the animal 
was placed. The door of the cage, set into the grating, was moyed 
by a mechanism which the animal had to operate in order to get out; 
once free, he could satisfy his hunger. In general, the animal was 
put into the box through a hole either in the back oi* the top. This 
hole was then covered over by a board. The door in th(> various 
cages could be opened either by a latch, a button, In' pulling a cord, 
or by stepping on a platform. Sometimes it was fastened b}- two or 
three means, which had to l)e operated l)y the animal ])efore its release 
was effected. When our author used chickens he sometimes modified 
his pi'ocedure. In place of having to open a door, the sul)ject was 
placed in a small inclosure and had to surmount successively a certain 
luunber of obstacles — walk up steps, for example — to find its food 

and companions. 
The basis of the 
principle remains 
the same; the ani- 
mal has, in all cases, 
to form an associa- 
tion between the 
representation of 
the interior of the 
box presented by 
his senses and the 
series of movements 
which release it, 
hunger being the 

Fi<;. 1.— General model of a box (Box K). eX('itant. 

After the animal was shut up, its conduct was carefully observed. 
A dou})le precaution was taken: first, to note if the subject of the 
experiment had or had not previously been subjected to the same or 
some similar experience; finally, which was quite easy with the 
arrangements adopted, to })e quite sure that the animal was free from 
any influence of the observer; the ''personal equation" connected 
with the latter being entirely eliminated. It was only manifest in the 
theoretical interpretation of the experiment. The animal's behavior 
was quite independent of any factors save its own hunger, the mechan- 
ism of the box it was in, the food outside, and such general matters as 
fatigue, indisposition, etc. Animals in doubtful health were not con- 
sidered. In order to be sure as to the psychological motive involved, 
the author, in the case of dogs and cats, did not experiment with them 
until they were in a uniform state of absolute hunger. As a general 
rule, if the animal placed in the cage did not, after a certain time, 




STUDIES ON THE MENTAL LIFE OF ANIMALS. 549 

succeed in getting out, he was taken out, but not fed; shortly after 
the experiment was recommenced with him. If. after a sufficient 
number of trials he failed to get out, the case was considered a failure. 
Enough animals were successive!}" tried in each box to make it sure 
that the results were not due to individual peculiarities. As chickens 
could not be subjected to extreme hunger without danger of death, 
the author used for them, as a psychological motive, the dislike of 
loneliness, which is very gi-eat among those animals. 

The associations which it is thus attempted to form are entirely 
new to the animal; they are such as could hardly have been expe- 
rienced by it in the course of its past life, still they are not too remote 
from the ordinary course of its mental activities. They express the 
connection of a certain act with a certain situation and the will that 
results from that relation. The movements required by the act are 
those hal)itual to the animal; we ma}' therefore consider the experi- 
ments as near as possible to the acts normal to the animal's life. As 
the acts required are near enough like those reported by the anecdotic 
school, we may compare the results obtained l)y this method with 
those furnished by that school. The results are 
schematically expressed in a graphic manner 
l)y curves which permit a rapid comparison of 
many experiments or the following of them 
through their different stages. The arrange- 
ment of the method seems excellent; let us see 
now its results.

First. Horn and under ivhat conditions is association formed ( — The 
experiments were made on 13 cats, whose ages varied from to 19 
months; on 3 dogs, of which one (No. 1) was 8 motiths old and the two 
others were adults, all three being of at)out the same height: al)out 10 
chickens were also used. 

The behavior of the cats, with th(^ exception of two. the oldest 
(No. 13) and one of a naturally apathetic disposition (No. 11), was 
always the same. All gave at iirst violent signs of discomfort when 
put into the box, clawing and biting at the bars, thrusting the paws 
out at any opening. These violent acts lasted eight to ten minutes. 
All manifested at first a desire to escape; they did not pay very

the door; a connection thus tended 
to be e.sta])lished between the 
act of opening the door and that 
of going- out; gradually all the 
movements that did not result in 
the delivery of the subject, not 
being finally accompanied by the 
feeling of pleasure resulting 
from that deliverance, would be 
stamped out. The impulse*^ that 
terminates in setting the subject 
at liberty would be stamped in 
])v the resulting pleasure; this 
particular quality would cause it 
to predominate in the conscious- 
ness of the animal in r. more or 
loss exclusive manner; aftermany 
successful trials the cat would, 
when put into the box, immedi- 
ately claw the button or the bolt 
that closed its prison. A pro- 
gressive modification of its entire 
attitude was produced. A cat, 
placed successivel}' in two boxes, 
manifested in the second one less 
desire to attempt escape through 
the )iars; it almost ceased to mew; 
if it got out of the first box by 
scratching, it showed a marked 
tendency to scratch when placed 
in the second; there was shown 
then, to a certain degree, an adap- 
tation of movements to efi'ect a 
desired end. 

Here are some figures: Cat 
No. 12, from 1 to 6 months old, 
placed in a box closed by a bolt, 
first took 1()0 seconds to got out; 
final!}' it did this in a minimum 
of 5 seconds. The intermediate 
figures show an almost regular 
decrease: 100, 130, 5)0, 60, 15, 28, 

8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7 seconds. An inter-

accompanying a muscular innervation; it is the direct feeling of the doing as dis-

val of 2-i hours separated the last two attempts. When the method of 
closing the door was simple — if, for example, it was released l\y pulling- 
upon a cord situated outside the bars or b}^ turning a button — 100 per 
cent of the cats succeeded. In cages having a more complicated method 
of closing, irregularity began. Cat No. 2, from 5 to T months old. did 
not succeed in getting out of the box marked "K," which required 
three acts to open it. The rapidity with which an association is formed 
varies considerably. It may be considered as easily formed when it 
passes from a maximum of 300 seconds to a minimum of (> or 8 seconds 
in five or six attempts; it is formed with difficulty when the same 
result is attained only after 30 attempts. Observation of the conduct 
of animals shows that the rapidity depends on the hereditary aptitudes 
of the subject, on its past experience, on the attention which it gives 
to the act. A cat may scratch without attending to any object in par- 
ticular, but if it accidentally shoves back 
the bolt its attention will be fixed upon 
that movement and that particular ob- 
ject. Finally, account must be taken of 
the greater or less vigor and the more or 
less abundant movements of the animal. 
Attention is often correlated with a cer- 
tain lack of vigor; the association in this 
case is more easily formed; a less exag- 
gerated display of activity, a greater 
calm, allow the animal to be more con- 
scious of what is necessary to do. 

Among the 50 graphic tracings that 
our author presents we notice the two 
curves shown in figs. 2 and 3 relating to 
cat No. 3, shut up first in box A, closing 
with a bolt; then in box K, in which three 
modes of closing were employed. The 
number of trials is carried on the line of 
the al)scissas, as well as the intervals that occurred between each 
attempt; the duration of each attempt is carried on the ordinates, 
each millimeter representing 10 seconds. The extreme difficulty 
which the animal had in getting out of box K will be remarked. 
The curve is interrupted twice, which indicates two failures. It is, 

tinguished from the idea of the act done or to be done. It is not the motive that 
leads the animal to do the act; it is the consciousness itself of the performance of the 
act. There is in it a psychological element and a physiological element. The 
"impulse" is the feelmg which comes from seeing oneself move, from feeling one's 
body in a different position, etc. — a position which relates to the execution of a par- 
ticular act and which characterizes it; it is the consciousness of the kin,iesthetic sen- 
sations that result from that attitude. Ecjuivalent expressions would be — the feeling 
or consciousness of movement; the feeling of muscular effort.

besides, extreineW irregular; after reniaiiiiiig low for some time it

curve carried on the same line of abscissas, showing the results of a 
new series of attempts after quit(^ a long- interval, shows that associa- 
tion was still far from being definitely formed; altogether it shows a 

very decided agitation and disorder 
of mind in the subject. 

The behavior of dogs was in a gen- 
eral wa}' quite different from that of 
cats. 

A dog who, when hungry, is shut \x\) in 
one of these boxes is not nearl}' so vigorous 
in his struggles to get out as is the young 
oat. And even after he has many times ex- 
perienced the pleasure of eating on escape 
he does not try to get out so hard as a cat, 
young or old. He paws or bites the bars 
or screening and tamely tries to squeeze 
out. He gives up his attempts sooner than 
the cat if they prove unsuccessful. Fur- 
thermore, his attention is taken by the food, not the confinement. He wants to get 
to the food, not out of the box. So, unlike the cat, he confines his efforts to the 
front of the box. It was also a practical necessity that the dogs should be kept 
from howling in the evening, and for this reason I could not use as a motive the 
utter hunger which the cats were made to suffer. In the morning, when the experi- 
ments were made, the dogs were surely hungry, and no experiment is recorded in 
which the dog was not in a 
state to be willing to make 
a great effort for a bit of 
meat, but the motive may 
not have l)een even and 
equal throughout, as it 
was witli the cats." 

An examination of 
the curves for these 
experiments shows a 
rapid descent, gener- 
ally after the second 
trial, sometimes after 
the first. Above all. 
there is recorded in a 
much less deofree the

sharp elevations indicating duration. In order to show the contrast, 
we reproduce the curve relative to cat No. 10, from 4 to S months old, 
and dog No. 1 placed in two similar boxes, C and C C, closed by a 
button which had to be broug'ht from a vertical to a horizontal posi- 
tion in order to open the box. The same remarks apply to the curve 



«Thorndike, pp. 32 and 33, 



STUDIES ON THE MENTAL LIFE OF ANIMALS. 



553 



of dog No. 1 in box O, similar to box K in which was shut cat No. 3. 
Apart from an abrupt rise in the curve followed by an immediate 
descent, we see no such marked irregularity, and, in particular, we 
see no interruption; that is to say, no failure. 

The experiments made with chickens were arranged in a little differ- 
ent manner. The subject was placed in a pen with two exits, one of 
which led to the place where were the other chicks and food, the other 
to a second pen from which there was' no issue. The number of these 
false exits could ])e arl)itrarih' increased. There were other pens in 
which an o])stacle was placed in the chicken's path, a few steps to 
climb, a piec^e of stovepipe, 11 inches long, forming an inclined plane 
which led the subject to an open platform from which the animal 
could jump down among his companions. In other cases he could 
escape by pecking at the door of the cage, by climbing up a spiral 
staircase and out throujili a hole in the wall. 




Fig. 7.— Cat No. 10 in box C. (Thorndike, p. 19. fig. 3.) 

Everything being equal, and making allowances for the modifica- 
tions due to the influence of heredity, the behavior of the chicks shows 
the same general character as that of the cats. The subject first shows 
extreme agitation. Its conduct appears to be governed by the law 
which may henceforth be considered as having a universal application: 
"An animal shut up and isolated tends to execute, for the purpose of 
getting out, all the acts which ordinarily give him his lil^erty under 
analogous conditions.'''* The alternation of successes and failures 
produces a selection: it is the pleasure that attends the .successful act 
or series of acts that causes it to survive. 

Chickens are. in general, slower in forming associations than the 
animals previously considered. Our author explains this by a differ- 
ence in their bodily organs and instinctive impulses. The anatomical 
and phj'^siological constitution of the chicken is on a lower plane than 

«^ " In scientific terms this hi,«torv means that the chick, when confronted by 
loneUness and confining walls, responds by those acts which in similar conditions in 
natnre wonld lie likely to free him." Thorndike, p. 36.

that of the dog and cat; its hereditary tendencies, derived from phys- 
ical conditions, are less suited than are those of the dog- or cat to per- 
mit a prompt reaction to the definite impressions of these experiments. 
On the other hand, it is not ver}- easy to distinguish, in the behavior of 
two species of animals, the part played by individual intelligence and 
that taken by heredity, race, etc. We have not here an}' precise indi- 
cations which would permit us to class, hnally, these 
animals in the scale of intelligence; the problem can 
only be solved by complex researches upon the devel- 
opment of attention, memory, activity, etc. The 
present experiments enable us to say, however, that 
the chicken ranks below the dog and the cat and 
that, as to these, the dog generally appears as the more intelligent.

Experimentx concerning imitation oud the j>s:i/ch(>l(>(/lcnl life of ani- 
mals. — To the question. "Do animals imitated' science has uniformly 
answered, "yes." But, put in this way, the question is too general; 
there are several kinds of imitation, not a single species. 

There are, to begin with, the well-known phenomena presented by the imitative 
bird?. The power is extended widely, ranging from the parrot who knows a hun- 
dred or more articulate sounds to the sparrow whom a patient shoemaker taught to 
get through a tune. Now, 
if a bird really gets a sound 
in his mind from hearing 
it and sets out forthwith 
to imitate it, as mocking 
birds are said at times to 
do, it is a mystery and 
deserves closest study. Jf 
a bird, out of a lot of ran- 
dom noises that it makes, 
chooses those for repeti- 
tion which are like sounds 
that he has heard, it is 
again a mystery why, 
though not as in the pre- 
vious case a mystery how, 
he does it. The important 
fact for our pui-pose is 
that, though the imitation 
of sounds is so habitual, there does not appear to be any marked general imitative 
tendency in these birds. There is no proof that parrots do muscular acts from hav- 
ing seen other parrots do them. At any rate, until we know what sort of sounds 
birds imitate, what circumstances or emotional attitudes these are connected with, 
how they learn them, and, above all, w^^ether there is in birds which repeat sounds 
any tendency to imitate in other lines, we can not, it seems to me, connect these 
phenomena with anything found in the mammals or use them to advantage in a 
discussion of animal imitation as the forerunner of human. «

Another sort of imitation ought also to be eliminated — that shown, 
for example, in a flock of sheep. The hrst ones leap over a barrier 
which is taken away before all the flock have passed: the next sheep 
jumps as if to get over a barrier, although it is not there, and five or 
six others do the same. In appearance — but only in appearance — this 
is a phenomenon of imitation. In fact, the reproduction of the act 
accomplished by the first animals may depend upon very special cir- 
cumstances peculiar to animals that live in flocks. " It is possible that 
among gregarious animals there may be elaborate connections in the 
nervous system which allow the sight of certain peculiar acts in another 
animal to arouse the innervation leading to those acts, but that these 
connections are limited. The reactions, according to this view, are spe- 
cific responses to definite signals, comparable to any other instinctive or 
associational reaction. The sheep jumps when he sees the other sheep 
jmnp, not because of a general ability to do what he sees done, but 
because he is furnished with the instinct to jump at such a sight, 
or because his experience of following the flock over bowlders and 
brooks and walls has 



got him into the habit 
of jumping at the spot 
where he sees one 
ahead of him jump; 
and so he jumps even 
though no obstacle be 
in his wav." There is 



(^

present at tne same Fig. lO. — Labyrinths used in experiments with ohipkcns. (Thorn- 
time a phenomenon of <iii^e, p. 35.) 
hereditary instinct and of personal experience. Primitively, the sheep 
who now imitates did not jump unless the external elements calling 
for that act were present and especiall}" unless the obstacle was present; 
now he jumps '"when only the nonessentials are present."" Besides, 
"these limited acts may be the i)rimitive, sporadic beginnings of the 
general imitative faculty we find in man.'' In an}" case, the very fact 
that diverse interpretations arc possible obliges us to leave out of 
consideration this kind of imitation in the present investigsition. 

The imitation which we are to study here must be imitation in the 
precise and strict sense of the word, understood as the transfer to 
one's own personality of an association formed by another.

and then jumping down. >io. t'4 had been previously taught to get 
out at the hole. No. 66 had no experience with the two methods of 
exit. After 9 minutes !^0 seconds. No, 66 went out by the inclined 
plane, although No, 64: had in the meantime crawled out under the 
screen 9 times. It was impossible to judge how many times No. 66 
really saw No. 64: do this. He was looking in that direction 5 times. 

Similar experiments Avere made with other chickens, utilizing other 
methods of exit indicated above — pecking at the door, jumping on a 
little platform, etc. Certain ones especially may be mentioned which 
were made with 8 chickens (Nos. 80 to 87) ranging in age from 16 to 
'M) days. Each was put in and left alone from 60 to 80 seconds, then 
another was introduced who knew the means of exit. The experi- 
ments were numerous. Chic^ken No. 80, for example, saw his com- 
panion go, out 54: times; he failed completely, notwithstanding the 
long duration of the attempt ((50 minutes). There was but one excep- 
tion, No. 82, W'ho finally escaped at the end of 8 minutes 40 seconds; 
the method of escape was effected by stepping upon a platform; and 
the author considers that in this case the successfnl attempt was purely 

accidental. The conclu-

sion reached, then, is that 
these animals do not imi- I 
tate. ' 

2. Exptriinenta tvlt/i 
caU. — The box used for . f^ 

these experiments was 
arranged in two com- 
partments separated by a wire screen. The larger of these had a 
front of wooden bars, with a door which fell open when a string- 
stretched across the tiop Avas bitten or clawed down. The smaller was 
closed by boards on three sides and l)v the wire screen on the fourth. 
The subject was placed in tiie latter compartment. The cat who was 
to serve as guide was placed in the other. The subject could in this 
way observe his guide, see him pull the string, go out, and eat the tish. 
Record A\as made of the time during which the subject was looking at 
his companion. The latter, at fixed intervals — 48 hours, 24 hours — 
repeated a certain numl^er of times the act of going out. Then the 
subject was in his turn placed in the large compartment from which 
he was to attempt to get out. The time elapsing between his entry 
and the moment of his pulling the string was noted. If he failed in 
.5 or 10 or 15 minutes to do so, he was released and not fed. 

As regards their general behavior, it is to be noted that the cats 
that here served as subjects behaved exactly as those did who were 
put in the same position without ever having under their eyes a com- 
panion as a model. They struggled as usual without ever noticing 
the liberating string. The example of the cat used as a guide was of 



STUDIES ON THE MENTAL LIFE OF ANIMALS. 557 

no utility; the association was formed in the same way as if each liad 
been phiced alone in the box. 

Besides, one would expect that if the association between the sight 
of the string- and the act which results from pulling it had been formed 
by seeing the guide cat pull the string the subject w^ould pull at the 
string as soon as he saw it; or, if there was a slight hesitation, a little 
indecision, such a period would be extremely short, at least it woidd 
be nearly constant for all subjects. Now, none of these expectations 
was fulfilled. No subject pulled the string on being placed in the 
compartment. The only exception w^as merely an apparent one — No. 
6, in the midst of irregular struggles to get out, chanced to hit the 
string with its paw. The association between pulling the cord and the 
act of getting out was so slight that he remained in the box for 16 
seconds before he noticed that the door was open. Cats No. 7 and No. 
5 always failed, notwithstanding the fact that they fixed their atten- 
tion upon the guide cat in an unmistakable manner 43 and 33 times, 
respectively, and in a doubtful manner 111 times for No. 7 and 68 
times for No. 5. 

No. 3 alone succeeded very promptly in getting out in three experi- 
ments, and in 3 minutes and 30 seconds. He finally succeeded in 8 sec- 
onds; but it should be noted that imitation was not necessarily a factor, 
for this cat showed in the course of numerous experiments signs of a 
much more lively intelligence than the others. He probably got out by 
his own effort alone. Besides, when a subject gets out of the box, if 
the success was due to imitation there ought to be a regular relation 
between the time which he observed his guide and the time employed 
in getting out; the latter should be in inverse proportion. Yet it is 
the opposite that is observed — the longer the time of observation the 
more time was lost in efforts to get out, or, indeed, the attempt ended 
in complete failure.

If the experiments are varied the same results are reached. For 
example, two cats were placed in the same cage, one of which, unac- 
cjuainted with the means of exit, sees the door opened and goes out and 
is fed with him. The experiment is repeated a number of times, then 
the subject is placed in the box alone. No modification of his behavior 
is noted which reveals the influence of imitation; the association is 
formed no quicker; the method employed was different from that used 
by his companion. Cat No. 1 opened the door ])y pulling at a loop 
with his teeth; cat No. 7. the subject, pulled it with his paw. In 
another 1)0X which could, at the will of the animal, be opened in two 
ways cat No. 3 pulled at a loop at the back of the box, while cat No. 5 
pulled a string at the front.

8. Experiments with dogs. — From these, too, it appears certain "that 
the animals were unable to form an association leading- to an act from 
having seen the other animal or animals perform the act in a certain 
situation. Not only do animals not have associations accompanied, 
more or less permeated and altered, l\y inference and judg-ement, they 
do not have associations of the sort which may be acquired from other 
animals by imitation."" Imitation can not in the animal take the place 
of reason, since it does not even exist. "If a general imitative faculty 
is not sufficiently developed to succeed with such simple acts as those 
of the experiments quoted, it must be confessed that the facult}'' is in 
these higher mammals still rudimentary and capable of influencing to 
only the most simple and habitual acts or else that, for some reason, 
its sphere of influence is limited to a certain class of acts possessed of 
some qualit'ative difference other than mere simplicity which renders 
them imitable."^ 

Another point in this question of imitation was brought out in the 
experiments with dogs. It was wished to ascertain, not whether imi- 
tation could facilitate the execution of an act which the subject could 
have performed, though less easily, by himself alone, but whether 
imitation could bring him to accomplish an act too difficult for and 
superior to his personal resources. 

Two dogs, Nos. 3 and 1, were placed in two identical boxes set face 
to face opposite each other, so that No. 3, himself incapable of open- 
ing his box, saw b}' what movement No. 1 let himself out. The result 
was a (complete failure. The experiments were repeated five times at 
intervals of 1 hour, .2-1:. and 48 hours. No. 3 certainly saw No. 1 go 
out {S'o times, and probably saw him 93 other times. Finall}^ left to 
himself for 40 minutes, he could not accomplish the necessary act. 
The conclusions derived from other analogous experiments are exactly 
the same. Dog No. 1 had learned to release himself from a box by 
jumping up and biting a cord. Dogs 2 and 3 were })rought in. Like 
him, the^" jumped and l)it, scratched here and there with their claws, 
but they never jumped after the cord. Dog No. 2 was tried with this 
series of experiments 8 times; he saw No. 4 get out 70 times, yet he 
never succeeded in imitating him. No. 3 was tried 9 times at intervals 
of 1 hour, 24, and 48 hours; he certainly saw No. 1 bite the cord and 
escape 75 times; his want of success was the same. 

VII. 

The conclusion finally reached, that animals no not imitate, seems 
contrary to the opinion of certain animal trainers interrogated bv the 
author; but the facts appear to warrant this conclusion. 

"Thorndike, pp. 61, 62. ^Thorndike, loc. cit., p. 62.

We give below some of the opinions of these trainers. They do not 
all agree, and besides they do not in any wa}^ impeach the very precise 
and scientific experiments of Mr. Thorndike. 

Question 1. If you wanted to teach a horse to tap seven times with 
his hoof when 3^ou asked him, "How many days are therein a week?" 
would 3"ou teach him by taking his leg and making him go through 
the motions^ 

A answered, "Yes, at first." 

B answered, "No; I would not." 

C answered, "At first, yes." 

D answered, "No." 

Question 2. Do you think \^ou could teach him that way, even if 
naturall}^ 3^ou would take some other way? 

A answered, "In time, yes." 

B answered, "I think it would be a very hard way." 

C answered, "Certainly I do." 

D answered, "I do not think I could." 

E answered, "Yes." 

Question 3. How would you teach him? 

A answered, "I should tap his foot with a whip, so that he would 
raise it, and reward him each time." 

B answered, "I should teach hiu] l)v the motion of the whip." 

C answered, '"First teach him by pricking his leg the number of 
times you wanted his foot lifted." 

E answered ambiguously." 

Let us compare the investigations of Mr. Thorndike with observa- 
tions made on the inhibition of instincts by habit. 

This phenomenon, very frequent among animals, has been noted ))v 
previous psychologists, and nota))ly by William James in his Psy- 
chology. In this the animal, being able to perform two acts, one of 
which is simple and natural, the other imposed by habit, chooses the 
latter. In the boxes which Mr. Thorndike used the hole by which 
the animal was introduced Tyas usualh' covered, so that it was obliged 
to go out at the door. Yet, after the association was once formed, 
even if the hole was left uncovered, the animal continued to go 
out at the door, although the opening of the latter was more difficult 
for it. 

The influence of association upon the inhibition of instincts may be 
exerted in two ways. Sometimes the instinct may wane by not being 
used; sometimes it is inhibited for the moment by a contrar}' dispo- 
sition. An instance of the former sort is found in the history of a 
cat, which, when placed in a box like those we have indicated, learns 
to open a door and escape. After enough trials, the board covering

the entrance hole is removed. The oat w ill .still continue to open the 
door, but if at any time she happens to notice the hole she nia^y make 
use of it occasionally, but not invariably.' An instance of the second 
sort is that of a chick placed in a cage, A, separated by a wire screen 
from a box, D, in which were other chickens and food. After picking 
and scratching at the screen, the subject finally jumps to B, and, after 
a similar process, to C, then reaching D. After seventy -five or eighty 
trials the wire screen is removed. The chicken could now at will 
descend from A to D, or from B to D, or from C to D. Now, this 
singular phenomenon appears: He goes to the edge of A, looks' down 
upon his comrades, but does not jump down into D, although nothing- 
prevents him, and then goes into B, where he does the same. Finally, 
in spite of the removal of the screen, the chicken traverses the long 
route A, B,' C, D. The instinct has been truly inhibited. The author 
observed but one case in which, after the wire was removed, the chicken, 

after looking over nine times to see his 
comrades, decided, after seven minutes, 
to jvunp directlv into D.

We can now^ attempt to make an out- 
line of the conception of the psycholog- 
ical life of animals as derived from these 
investigations. 

That life is, take it altogethei', rather meager. The animal is not 
endowed with reason; the faculties of comparison and conception of 
similarity are wanting. He lacks ideas and tendencies which would, 
as a whole, constitute an original and free intellectual life: he has no 
nuMuory of the past in the sense of a superior faculty by which he can 
recall at will i)sych()logical states that have disappeared, for the pur- 
pose of com})aring or contrasting them with present states. The phe- 
nomena of association that constitute his mental life, while presenting 
a certain analogy with some human associations, remain very different 
from what they are in man. 

The animal lacks entirely the power not only of correlating ideas 
independent of a corporeal attitude and determinate exterior condi- 
tions, but also of varying, of cond)ining associations originally formed 
undei- external influences. We should not, however, conclude from 
these investigations that the three species of animals here experimented 
with necessarily represent the totality of animals. It is especially 
notable that Mr. Thorndike has been unable to investigate monkeys. 
A similar study of these animals is much to be desired. 

The experiments here cited may at least aid us in establishing a 
criteriiun of the difference between animal and human intelligence. 
According t(^ a widespread opinion, held especially l)y Mr. C. L. 



STUDIES ON THE MENTAL LIFE OF ANIMALS. 561 

Morgan, the diti'erence between these two kinds of intelligence con- 
sists simply in the greater complexity or simplicity of their associa- 
tion. The superior animals are supposed to be capable of construct- 
ing concepts more or less similar to our own, the association being the 
same both in them and in man. The aptitude for forming rich and 
complex associations constitutes intelligence, properly so called, as 
opposed to reason defined as a faculty of analysis. From the point of 
view of intelligence there is a regular gradation from man to the ani- 
mal. That which distinguishes them is the presence of that rational 
analytic faculty with which the faculty of speech is connected. We 
also meet men in whom that analytic faculty is but slightly developed 
and who nevertheless .show a high degree of intelligence. In the 
human species these individuals are those whose mental life most 
closely approximates to that of the superior animals; there is an 
almost direct transition from one to the other. 

This theory can not be accepted. Human association is entirely 
tranyformed by the intervention of inference, judgment, and com- 
parison. It includes imitation, understood as a transferred associa- 
tion. Its elements may exist in our consciousness in an isolated man- 
ner, independently from the primitive association that united them, 
etc. Our author says in plain terms that "'man is no more an animal 
with language than an elephant is a cow with a proboscis."" The 
species or genera should be no more confounded from the psychological 
than from the physiological point of view. 

Progress from the psychological life of the animal to the mental life 
of man has been effected by transforming the direct connections 
between the terms of an association into indirect ones. It is essential 
to understand that an animal has not a continuous and free mental life. 
Its consciousness does not control the nuiltiple series of associations 
which his life obliges him to form. Living in the present, his mind 
is powerless to grasp the past or to previse the future. He possesses 
only a fragmentary consciousness whose various elements are inter- 
connected only in a confused manner; at each instance of time the ego 
of the animal is made up of the consciousness of an association directed 
with a view to an innnediate practical action, an association whose 
terms are directly united, under the pressure of exterior circumstances; 
there is no continuity imposed from w ithin. A\'ith man, on the con- 
trary, the elements of an association may be dissociated and isolated 
one from the other; they are not indissoluldy bound up with the 
excitation that caused their appearance in consciousness, and with the 
reaction which responded to that excitation. There is thus a series of 
terms, very variable in number, l)ut always considerable in each indi- 
vidual consciousness, which phiy freely, associating themselves with

each other in an original and independent manner, B3' memory, 
generalization, inference, etc., faculties properly human, the elements 
of past associations intervene in the play of the present elements, and 
this total may be organized with reference to a future action. An 
important investigation for comparative psychology would consist in 
attempting to find in the child and in the most elevated types of the 
primates the first traces of this transformation of directly practical 
association into a free and continuous mental life. We should thus be 
able to ascertain, not the legendar}' account, but the real history of the 
origin of our human faculty of association. 

"• Our work/' sa3^s Mr. Thorndike, "has rejected reason, compari- 
son, or inference, perception of similarity, and imitation. It has 
denied the existence, in animal consciousness, of any important stock 
of free ideas or impulses, and so has denied that animal association is 
homologous with the association of human psychology. It has homoi- 
ogized it with a certain limited form of human association. It has 
proposed, as necessary steps in the evolution of human faculty, a vast 
increase in the number of associations, signs of which appear in the 
primates, and a freeing- of the elements thereof into independent exist- 
ence. It has given us an increased insight into various mental proc- 
esses." It has convinced the writer, if not the reader, that the old 
speculations about what an animal could do, what it thought, and how 
what it thought grew into what human beings third\, "were a long- 
way from the truth, and not on the road to it." 

I believe that our best service has been to show that animal intellection is made 
up of a lot of specific connections, whose elements are restricted to them, and which 
subserve practical ends directly, and to homologize it with the intellection involved, 
in such human associations as regulate the conduct of a man playing tennis. The 
fundamental phenomenon which 1 find presented in animal consciousness is one 
which can harden into inherited connections and reflexes, on the one hand, and thus 
connect naturally with a host of the })henomena of animal life ; on the other hand 
it emphasizes the fact that our mental life has grown up as a mediation between 
stimulus and reaction/' 

Theoretical science may derive a profit from these conclusions; but 
the author thinks also that from all these investigations some of the 
results possess considerable pedagog-ical interest. The associative 
process requires the immediate personal experience of the animal. 
Why not apply this psychological proceeding- to the education of the 
child? There are young minds that have not, at first, the theoretical 
intelligence for certain matters of knowledg-e that are taug-ht, such, 
for example, as mathematical operations; often the teacher's theo 
retical explanation escapes them. Why not, in this case, have 
recourse to practical and personal "training-?"' Pedagogical methods 
founded on imitation can not afi'ect certain minds; for them the best

method of learning long- division, for. exapaple, would perhaps be to 
learn it in the form of numerous practical exercises. This method, 
like that of animal trainers, is founded on the formation of associa- 
tion by the repetition of the act. One of the essential laws of peda- 
'gogy ought to be that no restraint should be imposed upon children 
that is not based upon the subjective laws that govern the personal 
development of each child. 

IX. 

The method of investigation chosen by Mr. Thorndike has the great 
advantage of including in the observation only known elements, chc ^en 
in advance by the observer himself; it simplities and makes clear the 
data of the crude experiment; it facilitates the interpretation of facts. 
Yet it is necessarily somewhat arbitrary; it neglects the actually exist- 
ing complexity. In the investigations considered, one single element, 
of a physiological rather than a psychological nature, dominated the 
conduct of all the subjects — that is, hunger. But is that .state of phj^s- 
iological disturbance the most favorable one for studying the superior 
psychological life of animals? In studying states of consciousness 
closely associated with a physical need, has not Mr. Thorndike purely 
and simply eliminated in advance an entire side of that intellectual life, 
and precisely those forms, rudimentary without doubt, but perhaps 
really existent, of an original and free psychological development? 

Everyone knows how much our own mental life may be disturbed 
and upset by a disorder affecting an organic function. Notwithstand- 
ing the authority of Pascal, we are generally but little inclined to 
mathematical calculations while sult'oring with the toothache; poetic 
revery is not a common preoccupation of a man who is hungry. Now, 
other things being equal, was not this state of mental depression, 
which is intimately allied to physical suti'ering, the state in which Mr. 
Thorndike's subjects, particularly his dogs and cats, were placed? A 
single feeling engrossed their consciousness — the feeling of the distress 
they suffered; it was like a state of mono-ideism w^hich must disturb 
the normal course of their psychological development. The procedure 
of Mr. Thorndike appears to us very acceptable as regards the investi- 
gation of the conditions of the formation and nature of association — 
at least, in so far as he defines it — but it yet is necessary to complete 
the investigation by a study of subjects, free, as regards physiological 
necessities. 

As to the investigations regarding imitation, they seem to us much 
less conclusive. In the first place, Mr. Thorndike reasons as if the 
time during which the subject looks at the model corresponded to a 
time of real attention. Nothing could be less certain. Even when 
the subject sees the cat or the dog taken as guide escape from the 
cage, his own consciousness may be occupied by quite other matters 



564 STUDIES ON THE MENTAL LIFE OF ANIMALS. 

than the care of obserring and retaining- the movements accomplished 
by that guide. It is then that the consciousness of ph3'sical discom- 
fort becomes an obstacle to tlie development of psychological life. 
Doubtless the subject could have but one desire, that of getting out as 
soon as possible; but in order to give real attention to the acts of his 
comrade, to organize them into precise memories, the animal should 
be disembarrassed from the consciousness of phy.sical suifering, which, 
however, does not leave him for an instant. He should be capable of 
the intellectual eftbrt, anticipating the future and representing to him- 
self the series of movements going on before his eyes as being the con- 
dition of his own deliverance. If the time the animal takes to escape 
does not, then, vary in inverse proportion to these supposed observa- 
tions, it is not because the animal is absolutely incapable of imitating; 
it is because he has given no real attention. In order to put out of 
his consciousness the painful feeling of hungei- that controls him and 
to impress upon his mind the consecutive acts of his guide, he must 
have a control over himself that is not possessed by any animals. It 
would, above all, be necessary for the subject to comprehend that 
these acts and movements were the only ones that lead to deliverance. 
But can we ask of an animal such an etl'ort of intelligence and foresight? 
Let us now consider the moment when, his guide having got out, 
the subject is, in his turn, placed in that part of the cage. The state 
of hunger that tortures it being present, what feeling can occup}^ its 
mindC Mr. Thorndike takes for granted that if the animal imitates 
he ought to execute in order the movements that he has seen accom- 
plished ])v the other subject. But nothing could be more contestable. 
The animal is already discontented from having been shut up; instead 
of being out, his suffering is now prolonged; the changing of his 
compartment has given him a momentary illusion of approaching 
liberty; now here he is again with the doors all shut. He inevitably 
becomes angry, and this new discontent is shown by the agitation, 
sometimes quite excessive, which the author has noted. If the sub- 
ject had at tirst some tendency to reproduce the acts of the model, 
such tendency would be immediately obliterated by this brusque dis- 
play of activity, the expression of his irritation. The cat and the dog- 
do not immediately open the door, not only because they are incapable 
of judging as to the efficacV' of their various movements, but also 
because the memory of acts accomplished l)efore them is not suffi- 
ciently powerful to repress this overflow of useless action which arises 
from their anger; and when that anger has passed, the memor}^ of 
these acts is already too distant to be utilized. This does not at all 
prove, however, that under more favorable conditions imitation would 
not take place; perhaps, indeed, the study of the pla}^ of animals 
might lead to conclusions different from those of Mr. Thorndike. 



STUDIES ON THE MENTAL LIFE OF ANIMALS. 565 

It also appears to us that Mr. Thorndike's definition of imitation is 
rather a narrow one; starting from this definition he concludes that 
imitation does not exist among animals. According to him, in order 
that there should l)o imitation the subject must exactly reproduce the 
same movement, the same gesture that he has seen. So (see text) cat 
No. T did not imitate cat No. 1, because the latter opened the door by 
pulling a loop with its teeth, while No. 7 pulled it with its paw. It 
seems to us, however, that the exact, complete reproduction of a 
movement is an example of imitation that is I'elatively difficult and 
quite complex: it is the perfect form of imitation, very common with 
man, who possesses a developed imagination. There may be some 
exaggeration in expecting to find it as perfect as this among animals. 
The subjects of Mr. Thorndike have not reproduced the movements 
of their model because they did not possess a sufficiently strong or 
lively faculty of representation. The experiments cited by us may 
likewise be interpreted otherwise than is done by the author. The 
point was to see whether the animal, guided by the author, would 
repeat the movement which the latter made him execute. It was 
required to open the box C, closed by a button. It was shown that 
the subjects did not turn the button in the way they had been taught; 
they did not repeat identically the act wdiich it was desired to teach 
them. But the essential matter is that there was formed in their con- 
sciousness the notion, even though vague, of a relation between the 
situation before them and the act of turning the button. Each subject 
would then translate this relation in a manner personal to himself — 
one would push the button with his nose; another would bite it, etc. 
In brief, we would not have an exact reproduction of the movements 
which had been taught — there would not be a perfect imitation; but 
the question remains unaffected, whether the primai-y. rudimentary 
form of imitation does not consist, in the experiments here cited, 
merely in a connection between a given situation and a possible direc- 
tion of movements. The button of the door does not appear to the 
subject as the central point on which the action depends; progress in 
imitation will consist in associating with the point the image of the 
special movements executed by the animal that served as model. We 
must expect to find in them a trace of imitation, a tendency still vague 
in its manifestations, rather than a, clearly established habit. The 
disadvantage of Mr. Thorndike's method appears to us to be that he 
has transported into the domain of animal psychology the notion of 
imitation defined according to human examples. Unwittingly, Mr. 
Thorndike has not escaped the prejudice that consists in observing 
animals with preconceptions derived from the normal psychology of 
man. In this very question of imitation the problem appears to us to 
be that of seeking within the animal series to find what acts, what

movements, ma}' implj' a tendency to imitation, what forms of imita- 
tion are met with among the .superior animals — not to seek to know 
whether animals imitate as men do, or if they have the same imitative 
processes that we have. 

In spite of these few ol)iections, the merit of these investigations 
appears ver}* great. The method which is here inaugurated and the 
new views derived from them have already suggested other studies. 
As to the author himself, this beginning is full of promise, and we 
hope, in the interest of experimental psychology, that this promise 
will bear more fruit. 



ANIMALS THAT HUNT.«

The nimrods who, armed from head to heel, are ^oing- forth in a 
few days to contend with terrible partridge chicks and frightful rab- 
bits may not be aware that their methods of hunting are in use among 
animals. For the benefit of those who are perhaps ignorant regarding 
this fact we will explain. 

The toxote, for example, a lish in the rivers of ^Malaysia, has learned 
how to shoot at a mark and well deserves its name of the archer, 
or the spitting-tish, which has been given it. Although aquatic it 
feeds upon winged insects. When it sees on the plants on the bank a 
silly insect gaping in the air it advances as near as possible to the 
object of its desires, fills its mouth with liquid, and closes its gills. 
Soon it raises its snout out of the water and, closing its jaws, shoots 
upon the insect a long thread of water — a veritable shower bath — 
which, falling l)ack, washes the poor creature into the river, where 
he has not long- to wait to be devoured. The remarkable part of this 
performance is the accuracy of the fish's aim Avhich ver}' rarely misses. 
In Java and the neighboring countries people often carefully pre- 
serve the toxote in aquariums and anuise themselves by offering it 
flies, holding them some distance off so that it will shoot at them w^ith 
its douche, to the great delight of the spectators. 

To obtain food another fish, the cholinous, proceeds in the same 
wa3' with salt water, but he is less adi-oit, a fault which he possesses in 
common with man}- hunters. Yet he is alwaj^s persevering. ' If he 
misses his aim he tries again until he succeeds, unless the insect has 
withdrawn out of reach. 

laying in wait for prey is practiced with great skill by a large num- 
ber of animals who have learned that in order not to frig-hten away 
the creatures which they wish to catch it is necessary to remain 
motionless. This is notabh' the case with crocodiles, which wait 
whole days without moving, hidden in the water or the grass on the 
sliore, until their prey, deceived by their apparent quiet, comes to 
bathe or to slake his thirst. It is also the case with the python snake,

that waits hanging from the trees by his tail so inuiiovable that he 
can not be distinguished from the surrounding l)ranclies. When an 
animal is about to pass he lets himself fall upon it. Various leeches 
in Africa proceed in the same manner. In passing through virginal 
forests onl}' too frequently one hears a sudden noise like hail falling 
on the l)ranches. It is not falling hail, l)ut leeches which hasten to 
attach themselves to beasts of burden and to men, from whom they 
hasten to suck the blood. They were watching their chance, perched 
on the l)ranches — an odd dwelling place, l)y the way, for creatures 
that are generally considered aquatic. 

The bird of prey called the Pygargus sea eagle also waits till his 
victim comes within range. Audubon has picturesquely sketched 
him. "Behold," says he, "just at the bank of a great river the eagle, 
perched upright on the last branch of the highest tree. His eye, glit- 
tering with a somber tire, sweeps over a vast stretch. He listens, 
and his subtle ear is open to every distant sound. From time to time 
he casts a glance downward to the earth for fear lest even the light 
step of the fawn may escape him. His female is perched on the oppo- 
site bank, and if all remains tranquil and silent she admonishes him, 
b}' a cr}', still to l)e patient. At the well-known signal the male partly 
opens his immense Avings, bends his, body slightly downward, and 
answers her with another cry like a burst of maniac laughter. Then 
he resumes his upright position and again all is silent. Ducks of all 
sorts, teals, scoters, and others pass before him in swift flocks and 
descend the river, but the eagle does not deign to notice them; they 
are not worthy of his attention. Suddenh' like the hoarse note of a 
clarion the voice of the swan resounds, still distant, but coming 
nearer. A piercing cry comes across the river from the female, not 
less active, not less alert than her mate. He shakes all his bod}^ vio- 
lently, and by several shakes of his head, aided by the action of the 
muscles of the skin, he in an instant arranges his plumage. Now the 
white voyag-er is in sight. His long snowy neck is stretched forward; 
his eyes are on the alert, vigilant as those of his enemies. His great 
wings seem to support the weight of his body with difficulty, though 
they beat the air incessantly. He seems so wearied in his movements 
that his legs are even stretched out under his tail to aid his flight. At 
the instant when the swan is about to pass the somber pair the male, 
fully prepared for the chase, darts down uttering a formidable cry. 
The swan hears it, and it sounds more terrible to his ears than the 
report of the murderous gun. This is the moment to appreciate the 
power which the eagle puts forth. He darts through the air like a 
falling star, and swift as light swoops on his trembling victim, who 
in the agony of despair tries by various evolutions to escape from the 
embrace of his cruel talons. He pretends death, makes feints, and 
would even plunge into the current. But the eagle prevents him; he

has known too long- that by this stratagem his pre}' could escape, and 
he forces him to remain on the wing by trying- to strike him from 
beneath." " 

The beautiful ))ird that is known to all as the bee eater proceeds 
like those hunters who, on the shores of the Mediterranean, watch for 
game on its retui-n from Africa. He posts himself near a nest of 
wasps or bees and snaps up these little stiletto bearers as they come 
out or return home. 

The baudroie prefers to catch by deco3\ This rather large tish 
buries himself in the mud and lets only a sort of small flag appear, 
which is fastened to his nose by the medium of a long tilament which 
floats as the water moves it. The little fishes in his neighborhood 
hurry toward this flag, thinking they have to do with an easy prey. 
When they are gathered in goodly number, disputing over this sweet 
morsel, the baudroie opens his huge mouth and swallows them down 
without further ceremony. 

Other animals are more refined and, in the hunt by decoy, prefer to 
use traps. It might be supposed that this method of hunting, which 
demands a certain intelligence, would be practiced by creatures of 
rather high organization. This is not so, since the humble insects 
employ it. The larva of the ant-lion digs on the surface of the sand 
a large funnel, at the bottom of which he crouches; every insect 
which tries to pass roils down into the funnel and reaches the bottom, 
where at once it is snatched up by the larva. This is pit hunting. 
Moreover, if the victim seems likely to escape, he shovels at him 
quantities of sand which makes him fall still more quickl}'. The larva 
of cicindela acts ditt'erently, but with equal craft, in order to obtain 
the little insects necessary for his nourishment. He digs in the earth 
a vertical hole, in which he props himself like a chimney sweep climl) 
ing up a chimne}^ in. such fashion that his head, flattened and slightly 
hollowed, exactly stops up the orifice of the opening on a level with 
the ground. When a little creature is about to pass over this veri- 
table living trap the larva sinks down, at the same time dragging 
with him his victim, which he hastens to seize between his claws and 
to devour. 

Hunting with the aid of nets is, as we know, practiced with great 
ability by spiders, who stretch their webs, which are sometimes irreg- 
ular, sometimes of marvellous regularity, in our gardens and houses. 
Some await their prey, keeping to the middle of the web. Others, 
more prudent, hide in a little silken cell well concealed in a hole of 
the wall. Most of them trust to the strength of their threads and to 
the glutinous substance with which these are moistei)ed. When a 
victim is taken, the spider often prevents it from struggling by 
enveloping it with delicate threads. If it is small, however, he con- 
tents himself with killing it and sucking it up on the spot or after

dragging it into a corner. There exists in Madagascar a spider 
which, for a long time, puzzled the naturalists. Its web is rather like 
that of our Epelra dmdemls, but it is noticeable that at the center 
therc^ is a great thread of silver white, a \ eritable cable, bent in zig- 
zag. What could possibly be the use of this? One could watch 
the web for a long time without seeing the creature make use of it; 
when a victim is taken, the spider is content to wind him about with 
small threads. Yet the cable is undoubtedly of use to the spider, 
for if it is removed he hastens to make another. M. Vinson at last, 
after long observation, succeeded in solving the question. One day 
when he was examining for the hundredth time the tricks and the 
manners of the spider, he saw a great grasshopper jump into the 
midst of the web. At the same instant the spider, darting upon the 
cable, l)egan with the greatest swiftness to wrap it about the insect. 
The victim was too large to be held by the simple threads; the cable 
was there to bind him securely. 

The ant-eater depends less on the power of skill, and, like a child, 
limes his game. He puts out his long sticky tongue and flattens it 
on the ground; all the insects that pass stick to it, vying with each 
other, and when the heap is sufficiently thick, the ant-eater draws his 
long tongue in and swallows them all. At other times he plunges his 
lingual appendix into ant-hills and draws it back laden with ants. 

Coursing is ver}" frequent among mammals, notably among Avild 
dogs, wolves, and foxes. According to F. Houssay, wild dogs follow 
their prey in immense packs. Thev excite one another by their hay- 
ings at the same time that the}^ frighten the game and half paralyze its 
power. Ko animal is agile nor strong enough to be sure of escaping 
them. They surround him and cut off his retreat in a most skillful 
manner; gazelles, antelopes, despite an extreme lightness and swift- 
ness, are overtaken at last; wild boars are quickh^ run down; their 
rough defense costs some of the assailants their life, but these also 
become the prey of the pack that falls upon the quarry. In Asia these 
wild dogs are not afraid to attack even the tiger. Man^^ without doubt, 
have their backs broken by a blow from his paw, or are strangled by 
being seized by his jaws, but the death of comrades does not diminish 
either the courage or the hunger of the surviving assailants. Their 
number is such, moreover, that the great beast, overrun, covered hy 
agile enimies who cling to him and cover him with wounds, finally 
succumbs. 

Wolves likewise hunt in large packs. Their boldness, when hunger 
presses them in the bad season, is well known. In time of war they 
follow ami}' corps to attack stragglers and devour the dead. In 
SiV)eria they follow sledges on the snow with a redoubtable persever- 
ance and the pack is not restrained l)y the corpses of their comrades 
who are shot down. Aside from these fatal battles, wolves seem to 



ANIMALS THAT HUNT. 571 

have the power of combining for actual stratagems. Sometimes a 
pair hunt together. If they meet a flock, knowing that the dog will 
defend bravely the creatures intrusted to him, that he is vigilant, and 
that his fine sense of smell will bring him upon them long before the 
herdsman is aware of them, they attend first to him. The wolves 
approach, waril}^ keeping out of sight; then one of them abruptly 
shows himself and attracts the attention of the dog, who rushes upon 
the wolf and pursues it with such eagerness that he does not perceive 
tliat, during this time, the second thief has seized a sheep and dragged 
it into the wood. The dog finall}^ gives up his attempt to vie in swift- 
ness with the fugitive and returns to his flock. Then the two confed- 
erates again meet and share their pvGj. In other cases a w^olf will 
hunt with his mate. When they wish to take a roebuck, one of the 
pair — the male, for example — follows it and directs the chase so as to 
make the prej' pass near a place where the female is hidden. She 
then springs forward and continues the chase while the male wolf rests. 
It is a verital)le organized relay race. Of necessity the strength of 
the roe is exhausted, and he can not equal the ardor which his pur- 
suer, quite fresh, displays in the chase. He is taken and put to death. 
The male has meanwhile approached the place of the feast in a more 
leisurely manner and comes to claim his share of the boot3^ 

By what we have now said, it is clear how analogous to our own 
methods of hunting are those which are in use among animals. That 
the picture may be complete, it is necessary to cite the poachers, which 
will not be difficult, for they are legion. I will only mention one of 
them — the most audacious — the stercorarius, a sea bird that is often 
seen on the seashore following gulls, sea mews, and terns as if he 
would devour them. Such is not his purpose. If you follow him 
with a glass yon see him torment these unhappy birds unceasingly, 
until they let fall into the sea a whitish, greenish mass, which he 
seizes and swallows in an instaiit. The early witnesses of this per- 
formance imagined that this mass was nothing else than the dejection 
of the sea bird, and therefore concluded that the stercorarius had a 
singular method of alimentation (whence the name). But in reality 
that is not the explanation. The mass rejected is a fish only just 
swallowed l)y th(> bird, who is forced by the stercorarius to regurgi- 
tate it; to this (Mid the latter follows without rest and strikes his 
quarry violently on the head until the ])0()ty is abandoned to him. 
If the ])ird resists, which rarely happens, he strangles it and tears it 
to pieces. 



FLAMINGOES' NESTS. « 



By Frank M. Chapman. 



Not very many years ago, so little did we know about the nesting 
habits of the flamingo, it was commonly believed that the incubating 
bird straddled the nest when hatching, letting her legs hang down on 
either side! The observations of H. H. Johnston ^' and Abel Chapman * 
on the European species {Phwnicopterus antiquorum) and of Sir Henry 
Blake '^ on the American species {P. 'ruber) proved the a])snrdity of this 
belief b}^ showing that incubating birds folded their legs under them 
in the usual w'a}", but we still know very little about the nesting 
habits of these birds. 

Largely with the o])ject of studying the flamingo on its nesting 
grounds I went to the Bahamas in April of the present 3' ear, accom- 
panied by Mr. Louis Agassiz Fuertes, the well-known artist. At 
Nassau we joined Mr. J. Lewis Bonhote, of Cambridge, England. 
Mr. Bonhote was formerly governor's secretarj^ in the Bahamas, when 
he acquired a knowledge of the islands which was of the greatest value 
to us. He had already made a reconnoissance in search of flamingoes' 
nesting retreats, and with the aid of one of the few natives who was 
familiar with their whereabouts had succeeded in reaching a locality 
on Andros Island, at wdiich the birds had bred the previous year. 

It is not my purpose to recount here the various adventures which 
befell us while cruising about the Bahamas in a ver}" comfortable 
50-ton schooner, and I proceed at once to a description of our experi- 
ences with the flamingo. 

Flamingoes are late breeders. It is not improbable that the time 
of their nesting is dependent upon the rain}^ season, which, in the 
Bahamas, begins about the middle of Ma3^ Consequently we deferred 
our trip to the locality previously visited by Mr. Bonhote until the 
middle of May. Then we anchored our schooner at the mouth of a 
certain channel, and, loading our small boats with needed supplies, 
rowed for the better part of a day, pitching our tents toward evening 
on a low, slightly shelving shore with a ])ackground of dense, scrubl)y 
vegetation. Exploration of the surrounding country showed that it 
was regularly frequented by flamingoes in numbers during the nesting

season. Within a radius of a mile no less than eight groups of nests 
were discovered. They showed successive stages of decay, from the 
old nests, which had almost disappeared before the action of the 
elements, to those which were in an excellent state of preservation 
and were doubtless occupied the preceding j^ear. Some were placed 
among young, others among fully grown, mangroves, and one colony, 
probably inhabited in 1900, was situated on a sand bar 200 yards from 
the nearest vegetation. All the colonies found contained at least 
several hundred nests, and the one on the sand bar, by actual count of 
a measured section, was composed of 2,000 mud dwellings. What an 
amazing sight this settlement nmst have presented when occupied, 
with the stately males, as is their habit, standing on guard near their 
sitting mates! 

Flamingoes in small flocks containing from 3 or 4: to 50 individuals 
were seen in the vicinit}', but it remained for Mr. Bonhote's negro 
assistant to discover the spot which had been selected by the birds for 
a nesting site in 1902. Climbing a small palm, an extended view was 
had of the surrounding lagoons, sand bars, and bush-grown limestone; 
and he soon exclaimed, "Oh, Mr, Bonhote, too much, too much fiUy- 
mingo!" Less than a mile away, indeed, was a flock estimated to 
contain at least 700 of these magniticent birds, which Mr. Bonhote 
approached so cautiously through the thick growth of mangroves, 
that he Avas fairly upon them before they took wing. They had not 
then begun to build, but the open spaces among the mangroves were 
closely dotted with nests (see illustration), which apparently had been 
occupied the preceding year and in some of which old eggs were seen. 
Here, some days later, nests were found in the early stages of their 
construction ; but, to our great regret, circumstances compelled us to 
leave l)efore they were completed and we did not, therefore, see the 
birds upon them. However, we learned some things regarding the 
nesting habits of flamingoes which, in view of our comparative igno- 
rance of the w^ays of these birds at this season, it may be worth while 
recording. 

In the tirst place, although the birds return to the same general 
locality year after year, they apparently use a nest only one season. 
This seemed proven by the nicely graduated series of groups of nests 
which we found, each one of which, beginning with those best pre- 
served, seemed about a year older than the other, and b}^ the fact 
that the birds were building fresh nests near numbers of others which 
were seemingl}' as good as new. 

The thousands of nests seen were built of mud, which the nests in 
process of construction showed was scooped up from al)out their base. 
In fact it is difficult to conceive of a flamingo carrying nmd. In 
selecting a nesting site, therefore, the l)ird is governed by the condi- 
tion of the ground, which, to be serviceable, must be soft and mudd}'.

flamingoes"" nests. 575 

For this reason, as I have suggested, the time of the breeding- season 
may be regulated by that of the rainy season; the heavy, tropical 
downpours not only moistening the earth, but doubtless raising the 
water sufficiently in this exceedingly low, flat country to slightly 
flood large areas. While the birds, therefore, must build near, or, 
indeed, in the water, they guard against complete submergence of 
their home by building it high enough to protect the eg^ from possi- 
ble danger. The popular conception of a flamingo's nest makes it not 
more than 6 or 8 inches in diameter at the base, whence it tapers to a 
truncate, hollowed top nearl}^ 2 feet in height. I saw no nest, how- 
ever, over 12 inches high, and most of them were not over S inches 
high. The average basal diameter was about 18 inches, that of the 
top about 10 inches. 

It is possible that the height of flamingoes' nests, like that of the 
mid-chimneys to the l)urrows of fiddler crabs, mav depend upon the 
amount of rise and fall in the neighboring waters. This is a point to 
be ascertained by subsequent observations. 

Flamingoes are wonderful birds. Their brilliant coloring and large 
size, habit of perching and flying in files, and the openness of the 
country which they inhabit, all combine to make a flock of flamingoes 
one of the most remarkable sights in bird life. Indeed, so far as my 
experience goes, it is the most remarkable sight in bird life. 

They are very sh}^ and can be approached closel}' only when thev 
are unaware of your presence. Attempts to use a telephoto lens in 
photographing birds about 200 yards away failed because of the force 
of the trade winds over the mangrove flats.. Even at this distance the 
birds are large enough to make a strip of glowing color, in strong- 
contrast to the blue water before and the green mangroves behind 
them. This is near their danger line, and if one attempts to approach 
more closely without cover there is a sinuous movement along the 
whole line as the long, slender necks are raised and the birds i-egard 
the cause of their alarm. Soon a murmur of goose-like honkings 
comes to one's ear; then the birds ))egin, in slow and stately fashion, 
to move away step by step, and if their fears are not allayed the 
leader will soon spring into the air and, followed by other members of 
the flock, stretch his long neck and legs to the utmost and begin a 
flight which usually takes them beyond one's view. As the birds raise 
their wings, displaying the bright feathers below, the efl'ect is superb 
bej'ond description, the motion showing their plumage to the ])est 
possible advantage. 

It is surprising how far, under the proper light conditions, even a 
small flock of flamingoes may be seen. Long after one can distinguish 
the individual in the waving, undulating line of birds, they show pink 
against the sky like a rapidly moving wisp of cloud which finally dis- 
solves in space. 



UPON MATERNAL SOLICITUDE IN RHYNCHOTA AND 
OTHER NONSOCIAL INSECTS/' 



By G. W. KiRKALDY. 



Since my brief note on this subject (Entom. 1902, vol. xxxv, 
pp. 319-320) I have seen a length}^ paper by the celebrated J. H. 
Fabre [5]'' on ''Pentatomas," in which he ridicules De Geer's account, 
and consigns the whole recital to the limbo of fairy tales. 

I have therefore looked up the literature of the subject, and have 
now sunmiarized it, in the hope that some of the readers of The Ento- 
mologist may be disposed to give the phenomena their attention during 
the ensuing months. 

ORDERS OTHER THAN RHYNCHOTA. 

The earliest reference to parental care in nonsocial insects appears 
to be that of Goedaert [9], who states that the mole crickets {GryUot- 
alpa (jryUotalija Linn.) take particular care of their eggs, raising up 
the nests in a hot and dry season so that the young- almost touch the 
surface of the earth, and are thereb}^ cherished by the sun's heat; con- 
trariwise they sink the nests down when the air is cold and moist. 
They also act as uncfeasing sentinels round the nest. Rosel [22] cites 
the above account, and gives a colored sectional drawing of the nest 
and eggs. Audouin [1] states that all authors agree in saying that the 
mole cricket takes the greatest care of its young, but Goedaert is the 
only author I can trace who relates his personal observations. 

The discovery of the maternal solicitude of the earwig {^Forjicula 
aurieularia Linne) by Frisch [6], confirmed and extended by De Geer 
[8], Rennie [21], Kir])y and Spence [l-t], Camerano [4], etc., is so well 
known and authentically established b}^ recent observations, that it is 
not necessary to dwell upon it. Sharp [23] states that Labidura riparia 
'' is said to move its eggs from place to place, so as to k(M»p thcMii in 
situations favorable for their development,'' but I have not been able 
to trace the original source of this statement. Burr [3] also notes 
that "a certian entomologist [Colonel Bingham] once told me that in

Burma, while .sitting- round the vump tire one night, they disturbed a 
large earwig who was guarding a little l)atch of eggn. Her first care 
was not for herself, but for her eggs. She showed great concern for 
their safety." 

In the Hymenoptera I do not refer to the well-authenticated instances 
of maternal providence in the Sphegidte and other families, this notice 
being confined to actual personal and continuous care. A sunmiary of 
the former will be found in Sharp [24], page 111. Of the latter there 
is one instance, viz, Perga lewh'il Westwood, a Tasmanian sawfly. The 
habits of this tenthredinid were related [16 and IT] by R. H. Lewis, 
who informs us that the eggs, in numl)er aliout 80, are placed trans- 
versely in a longitudinal incision between the two surfaces of a leaf of 
a species of eucalyptus. On this leaf the mother sits till the eggs are 
hatched. She follows the larva\ "sitting with outstretched legs over 
her brood, preserving them from the heat of the sun, and protecting 
them from the attacks of parasites and other enemies." It should be 
noted, however, that broods accidentally or purposely deprived of the 
mother appeared to thrive just as well. These observations have been 
briefly confirmed by Froggatt [7]. 

In the Coleoptera, the only instances known to me occur in the 
Scol3"tida^, among the Ambrosia ])eetles, and a consideration of these 
scarcely comes within the scope of this notice, since they are not non- 
social insects. The reader may be referred to Kirby and Spence [14] 
and Hubbard [25]. 

Mr. R, South and Mr. L. B. Prout are not aware of any instance 
among the Lepidoptera, and similar advice has been given me by Mr. 
Ci. nrVerrall and Mr. J. E. Collin of the Dipt(*ra and by Mr. W. 
J. Lucas of the Neuroptera. Research on the literature of the Thy- 
sanoptera, Anoplura, Thysanura etc., has failed to trace any such 
records. 

I must here also express my thanks to Messrs. W. F. H. Blandford, 
C. O. Waterhouse, C. J. Gahan, W. F. Kirby, and Drs. G. Breddin 
and D. Sharp for information and hints. 

RHYNCHOTA. 

The earliest Rhynchotal notice is that of Modeer [18]. In speaking 
of " Cmxex ovatux jmUide griseas,'' he distinctly afiirms that the eggs 
are laid in .June on the common birch, in number from 40 to 50, so 
that the mother can cover them when she sits over them. She does 
not abandon them except for brief refreshment, and can not be 
removed except by superior force. The eggs are hatched at the end 
of June, and the maternal care is still exercised, for she protects 
them against the male, whose attacks and the defense of the mother 
are circumstantially related. The great De Geer [8] confirms and 
expands the observations under the head of Chiiex hetulx (he gives 



MATERNAL SOLICITUDE IN INSECTS. 579 

C. giHseus Linne as a .synonym!). Boitard [2], in Iiis Curiosites 
d'Histoire Naturelle — a work unknown to me — embellishes these 
accounts, according to Fabre [5], by noting- that when it rains the 
mother leads her young under a leaf or under the fork of a branch to 
shelter them, and cov^ers them with her wings. Montrouzier [19] 
observed the habits of Oceanian Scutellerina3, a subfamily not closely 
allied to the Acanthosomatina? (in which the birch bug is included). 
His remarks have been recently translated in The Entomologist [1.5]. 
Montrouzier appears to have been unaware of the researches of 
Modeer and De Geer. Douglas and Scott [20] quote a letter addressed 
to the former by E. Parfitt, inclosing an adult female and young 
ones indentitied as Acantliomma grlseum. This letter circumstantially 
verifies De Geer's observations, which, so Parfitt states, were unknown 
to the English entomologist. These habits were still further con- 
firmed in great detail, in three notices [10, 11, and 12], by Hellins, a 
well-known and most careful observer. 

Last 3'ear I contributed to The Entomologist [15] a translation of 
Montrouzier's observations [10], and noted ""a species of Spudseus {fy 
sent by Doctor Willey from Birara (New Britain), of which I had 
under my care for study alcoholic specimens apparently confirming 
the generally accepted opinion. These specimens belong to the Peu- 
tatomine Coctoteris exiguus Distant, a determination kindly confirmed 
for me by the author of the specific name. 

So far the five original observers — viz, Modeer, De Geer, Mon- 
trouzier, Parfitt, afid Hellins — agree that the female bug does show 
parental aflection during a comparatively considerable period, and the 
first named declares that this is, in part at least, directed against the 
assaults of the male; but in 1901 J. H. Fabre — the "immortal Fabre" 
of Darwin, and one of the foremost of modern field observers — has 
published a length}^ document [5], in which he declares De Geer" to 
l)e mistaken. The gist of Fabrels paper is as follows: The gray bug'' 
is rare in Fabre's neighborhood. He found three or four specimens 
which he placed under a bell jar, but they did not oviposit, though 
eggs were laid b}^ the green [= Palcnnena prcmnus (Linne)], red and 
black speckled \= Euri/dema ornatus (Linne)], and yellowish [sp. ?];'^ 
and Fabre continues: "In species so closely allied, parental care in 
one ought, at least in some details, to be discovered also in the others." 
It can not be too strongly expressed that the last three are not at all 
closeh^ related to the gray bug, for the last named belongs to the

he appears to be unaware of the independent ol)servations of Montrouzier, Parfitt, 
and Helhns.

Acanthosoniatina?, the other three to the Pentatomina?, subfamilies 
distinguished apart by considerable and important structural differ- 
ences. Fabre declares that in these species "the mother paid no 
attention to her brood; the last egg laid in its place at the extreme 
end of the final row she left, careless of the trust; she no longer 
busied herself with it, and returned no more. If the chances of 
roaming bring her hack, she walks over the heap and passes on, 
indifferent. * * * This forgetfulness must not be considered as a 
possible aberration due to captivity. In the full freedom of the fields 
I have discovered divers broods, among which are found, perhaps, 
that of the gray bug. Never htive I seen the mother mounted over her 
eggs, as she ought to, if her family required protection as soon as 
hatched. The mother is of roving inclination and facile flight. Once 
flown far from the leaf which received the treasure, how, two or three 
weeks later, will she remember that the hour of exclusion approaches? 
How will she rediscover her eggs, and how again distinguish them 
from those of another mother? It would be incredible — such prowess 
of memory amid the immensity of the fields. 

"Never, I sav, is a mother surprised stationary near the eggs 
that she has fixed on a leaf, and, more convincing still, the total 
brood is divided into clutches scattered haphazard, so that the family 
in its entirety is formed of a number of tribes lodged here, there, and 
at distances sometimes considerable, but impossible to fix precisely. 
To rediscover these tribes at time of hatching, earlier or later accord- 
ing to the date of oviposition or the forwardness of the season, and 
then to reassemble in one flock from the four corners of the universe 
all the little ones, so feeble and moving so unsteadily — there are in 
this evident impossibilities. Suppose that bj^ chance one of the groups 
is discovered and recognized and that the mother devotes herself to 
them. The others must in that case be abandoned — and the}^ do not 
prosper the less. What, then, is the motive for this remarkable 
maternal zeal with regard to the care of one of the groups when the 
majority are left? Such singularities inspire mistrust. 

"De Geer mentions groups of 20. These would certainly not be 
the complete family, but just a tribe resultant from a partial oviposi- 
tion. A Pentatoma, smaller than the gray bug, has given me in a 
single ))atch more than 100 eggs. A like fecundit}^ ought to be the 
general rule when the mode of living is the same. Bej^ond the 20 
observed, what became of the others abandoned to themselves? 

"Despite the respect due to the Swedish savant, the caresses of the 
mother bug and the unnatural appetites of the father, devouring his 
little ones, ought to be relegated to the same limbo as the childish 
tales which encumber history. I have watched in an aviary (voliere) 
as man}^ hatchings as I wished. The parents were near at hand, under 
the same roof. What do they all do in the presence of the young? 



MA.TERNAL SOLICITUDE IN INSECTS. 581 

Nothing- at all. The^athers do not dash to drain the juices of their 
brats. Neither do the mothers rush to protect them. One flits about 
the latticework (treillis) [? metal gauze], one settles down to refresh- 
ment at the rosemary, while another walks over the groups of newly 
hatched ^^oungsters, which he tumbles head over heels, without any 
bad intention, but without an}^ discretion. The little l)eggars are so 
small, so feeble, that, passing by, he grazes them with the end of his 
foot and overturns them. Like turned turtles, the}" vainly kick 
about; no one heeds them. 

"During three months' assiduous observations I have not noted the 
slightest appearance of the maternal solicitude so celebrated by the 
compilers. The newly hatched bugs, packed one against the other, 
remain stationary" for several days on the empty eggs; there the}" 
acquire a firmer consistency and brighter coloring. Hunger comes; 
one of the youngsters leaves the group in search of refreshment; the 
others follow, happy in their mutual proximity, like sheep at pastur- 
age; the first in moving sets in motion the whole band, who set out 
for tender places where they may implant their beaks and imbibe; 
then they all return to their natal place for repose upon the empty 
eggs. Expeditions in common are repeated over an increasing radius, 
till at last, somewhat strengthened, the society separates and breaks 
up, never to retarn to its place of birth. Henceforth each one lives 
in his own w"ay. What, then, would happen if, when the troop moves 
away, there should encounter them a mother of slow gait, a frequent 
case among the sedate bugs? The young ones, I suppose, would confi- 
dently follow this chance leader, as they follow those among them- 
selves who are the first to take to the road. There would then be 
some similarity to a hen at the head of her chickens. This casual 
occurrence would lend an appearance of maternal cares in a stranger 
heedless of her bundle of brats. 

"The good De Geer appears to me to have been duped in some such 
manner; a little color, involuntarily embellished, has completed the 
tableau; and then are vaunted in books the family virtues of the gray 
bug." 

Fabre has been led into error, first, by his ignorance of systematic 
rhynchotology — as 1 have previously remarked, the form of bug which 
De Geer had under observation belongs to a subfamily not closely 
allied to that embracing the bugs watched by Fabre; secondly, by his 
negligence of previous literature, except that of De Geer (and inci- 
dentally Modeer) and Boitard; yet we have an independent observer, 
Montrouzier, ignorant, apparently, of all previous similar records, 
who notes a like habit in yet another subfamily, more remote still 
from either, and that almost at the antipodes of Europe. Moreover, 
De Geer\s accounts are explicitly corroborated by two competent field 
entomologists whose integrity and capacity have never before been 



582 MATERNAL SOLICITUDE IN INSECTS. 

questioned, and one of these (Parfitt) was by his own account ig-norant 
of any literature on the subject. So that Fabre's gibe at messieurs 
the compilers has failed to score. Boitard's account may perhaps be 
treated a little incredulously, and possibly also Modeer's interpretation 
of the paternal gymnastics. In my opinion, at least, it will be neces- 
sary^ to have much more direct refutation of De Geer, Hellins, and 
Partitt than the observations of even Fabre on species of another 
subfamily. 

With reg'ard to Fabre's asseveration that he never once found a 
female "Pentatoma"''' stationar}^ near the eggs, this is circumstan- 
tially contradicted by the precise observations of Hellins and Pariitt in 
Elasmostethus. Neither has the French author proved his theory, 
upon which he establishes so large a part of his assumptions, that the 
Pentatomida^ (or at least some of them) oviposit in more than one 
place. It is to be regretted that he did not examine the oviducts of 
one of the females observed by him. Moreover, it does not appear 
that Fabre marked any of the female Pentatomina" o})served by him 
so as to recognize them in the event of any "chance" returns to the 
original spot. Fabre also says, "A Pentatoma smaller than the graj^ 
bug has given me in a single batch more than 100 eggs," and insists 
therefore that De Geer's record of 20 in the gray bug could have 
been only a partial laying! 

This confines the subject entirely to the Rhynchota; now we have 
also, as noted above at the beginning of this paper, records of the 
devotion of the mother earwig (and of more species than one), records 
as well authenticated as such could well be, not only in written litera- 
ture, but from living observers who have not considered it worth 
while to register what has always appeared as a thoroughly firmly 
founded fact. The occurrence in GryUotaJpa (iryUotaljxi seems also 
authentic, while the recent confirmation by Froggatt, after seventy 
years' interval, of Lewis's observations on Perga levnsU establishes 
this remarkable case beyond doubt, and it is especially interesting to 
note that in other Australian species of the same genus entirely difl'er- 
ent larval habits are known to obtain; the latter is another argument 
against Fabre. What is there of incredilnlity in the whole recital 'I 
What a limited demonstration of afl^ection, or at least of intelligent 
power, compared with that displayed by the social H^nnenoptera and 
Neuroptera! Fabre argues as if parental solicitude and the sense of 
direction were unknown among the insecta, and his sneer at the inad- 
equacy of the memory of the mother bug" to rediscover the original 
place of oviposition is remarkable enough from the historian of the 
habits of the Hymenoptera. 

To conclude, Fabre may prove to be right, and Goedaert, Frisch, 
Modeer, De Geer, Kirby and Spence, Rennie, Montrouzier, Boitard, 
Lew4s, Parfitt, Hellins, Camerano, Froggatt, and Bingham, all, to a

man, wrong; ])ut even if so, Fabre has proved nothings at present 
beyond the fact that the females of two or three species of Pentatom- 
inse, not particularly closely observed b}" previous authors, did not 
manifest any regard for their progeny during his observations. It is 
perhaps not the "good De Geer'' who ''has been duped,"" Imt Fabre, 
who has been led astray by his ignorance of the systematics and bibli- 
ography of the Rhynchota. 

Addendum (March 30, 1904). — Since the above was published vari- 
ous contirmatory evidences in support of my views have been found. 
H. Schoutetlen [26] has noticed my paper at some length and men- 
tions two papers previouslv unknown to me. He further relates an 
early observation of his own on the gray bug in Belgium, where he 
noted a female brooding over its eggs and holding on tightly, without 
emitting any odor, when seized in the lingers. 

Reiber and Puton [27] cite the case of a female of the same ''sit- 
ting on its freshly emerged j^oung ones on a birch leaf,'"' The Abbe 
Pierre [28] also cites his experiences of this species, conlirming the 
foregoing accounts. 

Miss Murtfeldt [29] describes the devotion of a membracine, Entylia"' 
si/iuafa., from Central Missouri, feeding chiefly on Amhrosla (ragweed). 
Her observations on this Homopteron entirely accord with the previous 
recitals. 

Finally, my friend Mr. E. E. Green writes to me from Peradeniya, 
Ceylon (May 29, 1903). I take the liberty of quoting his words: "The 
female of several of the leaf-haunting reduviids — e. g., Endochus cing- 
aJcnuh and allied forms — remain near their ^^^ clusters until these are 
hatched. The young are at flrst gregarious, and the parent may 
usually be seen on the same leaf, watching over them like a hen with 
her chicks. It seems possible that she may catch insects to provide 
them with food, but I have no evidence of this." 

With regard to other insects, Barrett [30] writes: "The female of 
the northern mole cricket {GryUofidpn horeaUs) is said to care for her 
yoiuig until thev reach the second molt." No reference is given. 

Rennie [31] states that the eggs and 3^oung of the mole cricket ( Oryl- 
JotuJjxi gryJlotalpa) are "exposed to depredation, and particularly^ to 
the ravages of a black beetle who burrows in similar localities. The 
mother insect, accordingl}^ does not think her nest secure till she has 
defended it, like a fortified town, with labyrinths, intrenchments, ram- 
parts, and covert ways. In some part of these outworks she stations 
herself as an advance guard, and when the beetle ventures within her 
circumvallations she pounces upon him and kills him." The raising of 
the nests b}" GryUotaljM is also mentioned b}" S. S. Rathvon. (Ento-

THE PSYCHICAL FACULTIES OF ANTS AND SOME OTHER 

INSECTS." 



By A. FoREL. 



A fine example of the fact that complicated psychical combinations 
require a large nerve center having- under its control the sensory and 
motor centers is afforded b}^ the brain of the ant. An ant colony is 
usually made up of three kinds of" individuals — females (the largest), 
smaller workers, and males, who are rather larger than the workers. 
The workers have, more than an}' of the others, complicated instincts, 
and with them intellectual faculties (memory, plasticity, etc.) are 
readil}' demonstrable. The females have much less. The males are 
incredibly stupid; they do not distinguish friends from foes, and 
are unable to find their way to the nest. They have, however, well- 
developed eyes and antenna?; that is to say, the only two sense organs 
that are connected with the brain or supra-esophageal ganglion, and 
these enable them to successfully pursue the female in flight. No 
muscle is innervated from the supra-esophegeal ganglion. This fact 
makes very much easier the comparison of the organ of thought— 
i. e., the brain {Q)7'j)ora jyedunculata) — in the three sexes. It is ver}" 
large in the workers, much smaller in the females, almost atrophied in 
the males, though the olfactory and optic lobes are in the latter quite 
large. The cerebrum of the ant workers possesses also a cortex 
extraordinarily rich in cells. Injury to the cerebrum in ants is fol- 
lowed by results similar to those which occur in the pigeon. 

Insects appear to possess sight, smell, taste, and touch. Hearing is 
doubtful. It is possibh^ replaced by a tactile sense modified for deli- 
cate appreciations of concussion. A sixth sense has never been 
demonstrated. A modified photodermatic sense for perception of 
light must be considered as a variety of the tactile sense, and occurs 
among many insects. This is in no way an optical sense. In water 
insects, smell and taste become somewhat blended (Nagel), for chemical 
substances dissolved in water are detected bv either sense.

588 PSYCHICAL FACULTIES OF ANTS AND OTHER INSECTS. 

The vision of the retinal eye is especiall}- directed to the detection 
of movements — i. e., to the relative local changes in the retinal picture. 
In flight it localizes large space areas, but defines contours of objects 
lesf^ sharply than our eve does. The retinal eye gives but a single 
upright image (P^xner), whose clearness increases with the number of 
facets and the convexity of the eye. Exner succeeded in photo- 
graphing this image in Lamj>yris. The inmiobility of the eyes neces- 
sarilv makes it impossible for an insect at rest to see stationary objects 
situated laterally from it. This is the reason why insects at rest are 
so easily caught by slow movements. In light, insects orient them- 
selves in space ])y means of the retinal eyes. B3' the displacement of 
pigment many insects can adapt their eyes for use by day or by night. 
Ants perceive the ultra-violet rays with their eyes. Bees and beetles 
distinguish colors, though indeed not as the same tints that we do, 
since they arfe not attracted to those flowers that seem to us most 
l)eautiful. Perhaps this comes from some mixture with the ultra-violet 
rays not perceived l)y us. 

The ocelH play a subordinate part and apparently serve only for 
near vision in dark ])laces. 

The olfactory sense resides in the antennse, especially in their club- 
like ends — that is to say, their ])()i"e plates and olfactory bulbs. Being- 
movable and externally situated upon the antennal tips, they impart to 
the insect at least two attributes wanting to verte))rates and especially 
to man: 

{<() The ability to recognize the chemical qualities of an object b^^ 
means of direct contact (tactual smell). 

(/>) The abilit}' to recognize and distinguish, by means of odor, the 
shape and extent of an object, including also the form of its own 
track, and in this way to establish associated memories. 

The olfactory sense of many insects gives, therefore, definite and 
clear relations of known space, and may serve very well to orient ani- 
mals that move about on the ground. I have on that account named 
this qualitative sense, quite differing from our smell in its specific 
energy, topochemical olfaction. Apparently the pore plates serve to 
detect odors at a distance and the olfactoiy l)ull)s for tactual smell, 
3'et this is only supposition. The removal of the antennse destroys 
the power of distinguishing friend from foe and deprives the ant of 
the abilit}'^ to orient itself on the ground or to find its way, while 
three legs and an antenna may be removed without essentially injuring 
these functions. The topochemical sense enables the ant to distinguish 
from each other the two directions of its trail, an ability which Bethe 
considers to be due to a mysterious polarization. 

The organ of taste is found in the mouth parts. The taste reactions 
of the insect are very similar to our own. Will, having accustomed 
wasps to seek honey at a definite place, then put quinine in it. The 



PSYCHICAL FACULTIES OF ANTS AND OTHER INSECTS. 589 

wasps noticed this immediately, showed symptoms of disgust, and did 
not return. When he replaced the honey with alum the}' at first 
came back, but after experiencing the unpleasant taste ceased to come. 
It may be said, by the way, that this is also a testimony as to their 
memory for tastes and their power of association. 

Various organs for hearing have been described. The auditory 
reactions do not change, however, after the removal of such organs, 
whicli leads to the supposition that there is a sort of pseudo-audition 
by means of a perception of delicate vibrations through the tactile 
organs (Duges). 

The tactile sense has for its organs tactile hairs or tactile papilhe. 
It reacts especially to delicate vibration-s of the air or of the support. 
Certain articulate animals, especially spiders, orient themselves pref- 
erably^ by means of the tactile sense. 

It ma}^ be demonstrated that insects are accustomed to combine their 
various senses for the orientation and recognition of the outer world 
according to the species and the needs of their life. Eyes and vision 
are wanting in many species. Others, on the contrary, have a very 
dull olfactory sense; certain forms lack tactual smell — for example, 
most of the diptera. 

The great power of orientation possessed by some aerial animals, like 
])irds (carrier pigeons), bees, etc., demonstral)ly depends upon vision 
and visual memories. It is of enormous value in aerial flight. The 
semicircular canals of the auditory nerves provide a sense of equilib- 
rium and give sensations of acceleration and turning (Mach-Breuer), 
but they do not orient the individual as regards the outer world. A 
specific power of orientation, magnetic or otherwise, independent of 
the other senses does not exist. 

Taking these senses as elements, we have a basis for insect ps}"- 
chology. 

Domain of 2)<^rc€2)tion. — It may be considered as established that 
many insects (apparently all in some rudimentary degree) possess 
memory, i. e., the power of storing up sense impressions in their brains 
and turning them to account later. Bees, wasps, etc., will find their 
way back to a concealed place, not visible from their nest, where they 
had found some substance they liked, even after its removal and when 
days and weeks have elapsed. They do this, too, by flight through 
the air, during wind and rain which would remove every trace of odor, 
and even after excision of their anteini.e. 

The topochemical sense possessed by the antennee also gives excel- 
lent evidence as to the possession of memory by ants, bees, etc. An 
ant will make a difficult journc}', sometimes as far as 80 meters, from 
a nest that has been destroyed, and, finding there a place suitable for 
building a new nest, will return (orienting itself with its antenna^), 
and seize a companion, which he rolls around himself and carries to 



590 PSYCHICAL FACULTIES OF ANTS AND OTHER INSECTS. 

the jjlace he has found. Each of these then retraces the way and ]>oth 
repeat the maneuver with other companions, etc. The recollection 
that tiuit place is suitable for building a nest must reside in the brain 
of the ant. The slave-making ants {Polyergus) will undertake robber 
raids, led by a single worker, who, days and weeks before, has dis- 
covered the way to the nests of Formica fusca. The ants often lose 
their way, then stop and search for a long time until they again find 
the topochemical trail, when they give to the others the right direction 
for their farther journeying by sharply pushing them. The Polyer- 
gus will take the pupa? of the Forinlca fuaca from the depths of the 
nest and carry them otf to put into their own nests (often as far awa}' 
as 40 meters or more). If the despoiled nest contains still more pup» 
the robbers return on the same da}' or the following day; otherwise 
they do not return. Only the memory, i. e., the recollection that there 
were still many pupae in the despoiled nest can lead to the return 
thither. 1 have followed up a great numl)or of such raids. 

While the species of Forinlea carefully and painstakingh' go back 
over their topochemical trail, they know the immediate surroundings 
of their nest so well that even shoveling away the ground does not 
disturb them, and they find their way immediately. This is not by 
perceiving the odor from a distance. Certain ants can recognize their 
friends after the lapse of months. Among ants and bees there are 
very complicated olfactory combinations and uiixtures, w hich Von But- 
tel has quite justly distinguished as nest odor, colony (famil}') odor, 
and individual odor. Among ants there is also a species odor, while 
the queen odor does not appear to play such a part as it does among 
bees. 

From these and many other facts we conclude that the social 
Hymenoptera store up in their brains visual and olfactory (topochem- 
ical) impressions, and combine then] to form perceptions or something 
similar; that they associate these perceptions, even those of different 
senses — especially those of sight, smell, and taste — so as to obtain 
conceptions of space. 

These animals, by the frequent repetition of an act of traversing the 
same wa}", etc., acquire a rapidity and a celerity in their instinctive 
performances. Habits are formed by them with great rapidity. 
Habit, however, implies secondary automatism and previous plastic 
adaptation. Bees who have never flown away from the hive (although 
they may be older than many others who have so flown) do not find 
their way back at all, even if the hive is only a few meters distant, if 
they can not see it directly, while other bees know the entire neigh- 
borhood, often within a range of 6 or 7 kilometers. 

From the accordant observations of experts we therefore conclude 
that among the social insects sensation, perception, association, deduct- 



PSYCHICAL FACULTIES OF ANTS AND OTHER INSECTS. 591 

ive power, memory and habit follow in general the same elementary 
laws as they do in vertebrates and in man. 

On the other hand, inherited automatism greatly preponderates with 
them. The abilities just mentioned are very weak indeed outside the 
range of instinctive automatism peculiar to the species. 

An insect is extraordinarily stupid and unadaptable for everything 
that does not relate to its instinct. I once taught a Dytiscusi mar- 
ginaUs (water ))eetle) to eat upon my table. In doing this he always, 
by stretching out his fore legs, made an awkward movement which 
brought him upon his back. He indeed learned to continue to eat 
while in that position, but not to abstain from this movement. On 
the other hand he tried to spring out of the water (no longer to flee to 
the depths of the bucket) as soon as 1 entered the room, and gnawed 
quite familiarl}" at the tip of my extended linger. This was certainly 
a plastic variation of instinct. In the same way the large Algerian 
ants which I transferred to Zurich, learned in the summer months 
how to close up the wide opening of their nest with balls of earth, 
because they were followed and annoyed by our small Lasius niger. 
In Algiers I alwaj^s saw the nest openings widely open. 

That ants, bees, and wasps communicate to each other information 
which is understood is so well attested that it is unnecessary to waste 
a word upon the subject. The observation of a single robber raid of 
Polyergiis would suffice to show this. Yet this is not speech in the 
human sense. There is no corresponding abstract conception attached 
to these signs. We are dealing with inherited, instinctive, automa- 
tized signs (pushing with the head, rushing at each other with open 
jaws, vibrating the antennse, disturbing the ground with the body, and 
man}' others). Imitation also plays a great part — ants, bees, etc., 
imitate and follow their companions. It is therefore an entire mis- 
take (in this Wasmann, Von Buttel, and myself are entirely agreed) to 
think that this insect speech indicates anything like human delibera- 
tion and human power of apprehension. It is even somewhat doubtful 
whether a so-called general notion (for example, the notion "ant," 
""enemv," "nest," "pupa") can arise in the brain of the ant. The 
matters about which we are sure are certainly interesting and impor- 
tant enough in themselves. They give us a glimpse of the cerebral 
life of these animals. 

A good example will illustrate what has been said better than all 
generalities: 

Plateau has stated that if one covers dahlia crowns with green leaves 
the bees still return to them. He first covered his dahlias incompletel}' 
(only the outer or ra}^ flowers), afterwards completely, but still scan 
tily, and concluded from the result that bees are attracted by odor and 
not by sight.

In a dahlia bed much frequented by bees and comprising about 43 
crowns of various colors 1 covered with vine leaves certain of the

by bending the leaves about them and fastening them with pins. 

(b) In 4 only the yellow heart was covered. 

(c) In 1 this was reversed, the outer colored rays l)eing covered 
and the heart left free. 

So many bees visited the dahlias that tlu're were often several on 
the same crown. 

Result. — The bees immediately ceased to visit the completely cov- 
ered crowns. Dahlia c was soon revisited like those that had been 
left uncovered. Bees often flew to the h dahlias but immediately left 
them. A few, however, succeeded in getting under the leaves and 
reaching the hearts. 

As I removed the covering of a red dahlia the bees at once flew back 
to it. Soon a badly covered dahlia was discovered and revisited by 
them. Later an exploring bee discovered how to reach a covered 
dahlia either below or from the side. From that time on these bees, 
and onl\" these, came back to those covered dahlias. 

Yet various bees were a])parently searching for the vanished dahlias. 
About 5.30 p. m. a few had discovered the covered crowns. From 
this time on they were quickly imitated by the others, and in a short 
time the covered crowns were freelj'' visited. When a bee discovered 
my device and the entrance to the covered crown he in his succeeding 
journeys flew without delay to the lower concealed entrance of the 
vine leaf. As long as one bee alone had found the (entrance he was 
not regarded by the others, but if there were several (usually 4 or 
5 at least) they were followed by the others. 

Plateau's experiment therefore was a bad one and led to false con- 
clusions. The incompletely covered dahlias were still seen hy the 
bees. When he completely covered them from above the bees were 
already aware of his trick and still saw the dahlias from the side. 
Plateau had not reckoned on the memory" and watchfulness of the bees. 

On September 13 1 made some rude imitations of dahlias by stick- 
ing yellow heads of hieracium into petunia flowers and placed these 
under the dahlias. Neither the petunias nor the hieracium were visited 
b}^ the bees; yet many bees and bumble bees flew at tirst to my arti- 
facts, quite as many as to the dahlias. They left them immediately, 
however, apparently noting the error l)y the smell. The same occurred 
with a dahlia whose heart had been replaced by the heart of a hier- 
acium. 

As a counter experiment I placed a fine fragrant dahlia heart among 
the w^hite and yellow chrysanthemums neglected by the bees and situ- 
ated at the border of the dahlia bed. For half an hour all the bees 



PSYCHICAL FACULTIES OF ANTS AND OTHER INSECTS. 593 

flew over this heart without noticing it; then there came a single bee 
which chanced to be followed by a second. From this time on this 
dahlia heart, situated in the line of flight, was visited like the others, 
while on the other hand the petunia-hieracium artifacts were no longer 
regarded because they were now recognized as fraudulent. 

Plateau showed that artificial flowers, although they might be very 
good imitations (for us), were disregarded. I placed such flowers among 
the dahlias. They were in fact completely unnoticed. Perhaps, as I 
have already pointed out, the bees could distinguish the chlorophyll 
colors from our artificial colors by a mixture of ultra-violet rays or in 
some similar way. As, however. Plateau imagines that the artificial 
flowers repel the insects, I made on September 19 the following 
coarsely cut paper flowers: 

«', a red flower. 

/^, a white flower. 

;/, a blue flower. 

(S, a blue flower with a yellow heart made out of a yellow leaf. 

f , a rose-colored piece of paper with a dr}' dahlia heart. 

C, a green dahlia leaf (unaltered). 

It was 9 a. m. I placed a drop of honey on each of the artifacts 
set under the dahlias. For a quarter of an hour numerous bees flew 
quite near to my artifacts without noticing the hone}^, therefore with- 
out smelling it. 1 went away for an hour. When 1 returned the 
artifact S had no honey, therefore had apparently been discovered by 
a bee; all the others were completely intact and had remained dis- 
regarded. 

I now took pains to place a quite near a bee that was sitting upon a 
dahlia. The attention of the bee was, however, so engrossed by the 
dahlias that 1 biid to repeat the attempt four or five times before 1 
succeeded in bringing the honey directly to his proboscis. This one 
now immediately began to suck the honey from the paper flower. I 
marked him on the back with a blue color in order to recognize him, 
and repeated the experiment with ^ and f, whose bees 1 marked with 
3'ellow and white. The blue })ee flew away, but soon after returned 
from the hive and went directly to a, at first hovering uncertainlj' 
here and there, then to S^ where it fed, then back again to «', but not 
at all to the dahlias. Later the yellow bee returned to /i and fed, 
then flew to a and d, where it also fed, and did not trouble itself about 
the dahlias any more than the blue one had. 

Now came the white bee, looked for f, did not find it inunediately, 
and fed in some dahlias. Yet he tarried in each dahlia but a moment, 
as if the impelling idea of the honey was vexing him. He came 
back to the artifacts, whose appearance he seemed not 3'ct to fully 
associate with the remembrance of the honey, but finally found a sep- 
arated and somewhat depressed portion of f and sucked hone}^ in it. 



594 PSYCHICAL FACULTIES OF ANTS AND OTHER INSECTS, 

From that time on the three marked bees, and those alone, regu- 
larly returned to the artifacts onl}', pa3'ino- no further attention to the 
dahlias. It is a very important fact that those marked bees, entirely 
of their own accord, doubtless because of an instinctive analogical 
conclusion, discovered the other artifacts as soon as they became 
mindful of the honey that one of the same contained, and, indeed, 
in spite of the fact that the artifact was somewhat distant from the 
others and was differently colored. The dahlias which they previously 
visited were also of different colors. In this way the blue bee flew to 
(y^ /i, )\ and S; the yellow one to /^, «', ^, and y; the white one to f, 
«', /i, and S. For half an hour this went on. The concealed green C 
was not found, apparently because it was not distinguished from the 
green foliage. 

At last a bee, who had apparently noticed the othei* three, came of 
his own accord to S and fed. I colored him carmine. He then flew 
to (X and drove away tiie blue bee. Another bee was conducted to e 
and colored with cinnabar. Still another bee came of its own accord 
to and was colored green. It was 12.2U p. m. ; the experiment had 
therefore lasted over three hours, and only 6 bees knew the artifacts, 
while the great multitude yet resorted to the dahlias. Now, however, 
the other bees began to notice the ones that visited the artifacts. 
One, then two, then three and more new ones followed and colors 
failed me for marking them. Ever}^ moment I had to renew the 
honey. Then I went to dinner, returning at 1.25 p. m. At that 
moment there were 7 bees in /?, 2 in o', 1 in y, 3 in S^ the white one 
alone in f; more than half of them new, unmarked followers. From 
now on a perfect swarm of bees assailed the artifacts and sucked up 
the last trace of honey. Now, at last, one bee out of the swarm dis- 
covered the artifact C, which had, although full of honey, remained 
thus far unnoticed on account of its color. 

Like a pack of liounds attacking a bare skeleton, the swarm of bees, 
(piite diverted from the dahlias, threw themselves upon the artifacts, 
now^ totally destitute of honey, and searched ever3vcorner of them in 
vain for honey. At 1.55 p. m. the bees began to disperse and return 
to the dahlias. 1 replaced a and /i, respectively, with pieces of white 
and red paper that not a trace of honey had touched, consequently 
devoid of its odor. In spite of this, these pieces of paper were visited 
and searched by many bees, their brain yet occupied with the impell- 
ing idea of the taste of honey. The white bee, for example, searched 
the white paper in the most careful manner for three or four minutes. 
There can here be no question of an unknown force or of an attraction 
by means of smell or by the beauty of the flowers. These facts can 
only ])e explained by recollections of space, form, and color associated 
with recollections of taste. 



PSYCHICAL FACULTIES OF ANTS AND OTHER INSECTS. 595 

I took all the artifacts awa}', carrying them in my left hand. Two 
or three bees followed me, il^'ing- about my left hand and seeking to 
settle upon the empty artifacts. The space picture was changed, so 
the color and form of the object alone suffices bees for recollection. 

At 2.20 p. m. all of my bees, even the colored ones, had returned 
to the dahlias. 

On the 27th of September — that is to say, eight days later — I wished 
to make the same bees distinguish, by color alone, slips of various 
colors placed in different places on a long, graduaded scale of shades 
painted on a large sheet of paper and passing from white through 
gra}' to black. 1 wished first to train one bee as to one color. I had, 
however, reckoned without considering the memory of . the bees, 
which spoiled the whole thing for me. Hardly had I laid my paper 
and ni}^ slips on the meadow near the dahlia bed, set one or two bees 
upon blue slips and painted them, when they began to fly about to all 
the red, Idue, white, black, and other slips, whether provided with 
honey or not, and to thoroughly search them. After a few moments 
other bees came from the dahlia bed, and in a short time a whole 
swarm descended upon the paper slips. Naturally the slips that had 
honey upon them were more frequented, because the bees remained 
there, but those that were entirely free from honey were stormed and 
searched b}" groups of bees following one after another in flight, and 
then again abandoned. The bees even stormed the color box, among 
them one whose antenna? I had cut off'. He had already taken honev 
from blue slips and had flown back from the hive. He sought the 
blue cake of color in the color liox. 

In short, my experiment failed because all the bees still had in 
their heads the former ])articolored artifacts associated with honey, 
and therefore investigated all slips of paper similarly colored. The 
association ''taste of honey and paper slip" was again awakened by 
the perception of the latter and obtained a standing, as well as rapid, 
powerful imitation, because honey was really found upon certain 
of the slips. Ability to perceive and associate implies ability to 
deduce analogically from individual experiences simple, instructive 
conclusions, without which the work of perception and memory would 
be nugatory. We have just given an example of this. I have related 
in a previous paper that bumblebees whose nest I had transferred to 
my window often mistook for that other windows in the same fayade 
and examined them carefully for a long time before they righted 
themselves. Lubbock relates similar instan<?es. Von Buttel shows 
that bees who have become accustomed to a room and a window 
learned from that to look for a room and a window in other places 
(other houses). When Pissot covered over the entrance to a wasp's 
nest with a net whose meshes measured 22 millimeters, the wasps, 
checked at first, went below around the bottom, etc. Soon, however, 



596 PSYCHICAL FACULTIES OP ANTS AND OTHER INSECTS. 

they learned to H}' directly through the meshes. The sense of vision 
in flight is peouliurly adapted to this kind of experiments, which, 
however, can not be made with ants. Yet the latter doubtless arrive 
at similar conclusions by means of the topochemical sense residing in 
their antennte. The finding of booty or other nourishment upon a 
plant or near any object leads them to search similar plants or 
objects, etc. 

There are, on the other hand, very stupid insects, such as male ants, 
diptera, and day flies, with scanty brains, who are unable to learn 
anything, unable to combine sense perceptions so as to produce an}'- 
thing higher than merely automatic acts, in whom a retention of mem- 
ory impressions is hardly demonstrable. These respond hardly at all 
to anything but sense stimuli, but their life is adapted to extremely 
simple relations. It is here that the difference is best seen, and this 
demonstrates in the clearest manner, by comparison and contrast, the 
greater intelligence that the more gifted insects possess. 

Doinaln of the will. — The conception of the will as opposed to that 
of the reflexes presupposes, between the sense impression and the 
movement conditioned by it, a certain time as well as an intervening 
and complicated cerebral process. During the performance of instinc- 
tive, purposeful automatisms, which disengage themselves in a certain 
succession, there is also, as in the will, an interval of time occupied 
by the interior dynamic processes of the brain. There are, therefore, 
no pure reflexes. They may be for some time broken off and then 
again resumed. Yet their execution involves for the most part a 
linking together of complicated reflexes, which are obliged to follow 
each other in a definite order and not otherwise. Therefore the 
expression automatism or instinct is justified. 

In order to be able to predicate will in the narrow sense we must 
establish individual resolves which can be directed according to circum- 
stances — i. e., can be modified — which have the faculty of lying for a 
certain time in the brain, then to be again brought forward. This 
will is usually far below the complex human will, which consists of 
enormously complicated components long prepared and combined. 
Ants show both positive and negative will phenomena, which should 
not be confounded. In this the species of Formica L. excels, as it 
especially illustrates in the clearest manner individual psychical activi- 
ties. In the changes of nest mentioned above we may very well recog- 
nize the individual plans of a worker adhered to with the greatest 
tenacity. An ant will work for hours at some difticult matter in order 
to attain an end it has proposed for itself. This end is not exactly 
prescribed instinctiveh', as man}' possibilities may be involved, and 
therefore it often occurs that two ants work against each other. To 
the superficial observer this may appear stupid. Yet it is provided 
for in the plastic quality of the intelligence of ants. For some time 



PSYCHICAL FACULTIES OF ANTS AND OTHER INSECTS. 597 

the two animals will destroy each other's work. At last, however, 
they notice this and one gives way and retires or helps the other. 

Nest and road making give the best opportunities to observe this — 
for example, among the wood ants {Formica rufa) and, still better, 
among Formica jyratensis. To full}^ elucidate this it is necessary to 
follow them up for hours at a time. 

We may also recognize in the wars of ants very definite purposes 
of action, especially in what I have called "combats a froid" (chronic 
tights). After two opposing parties (two colonies that have been 
brought together) have concluded a peace, single ants are often seen 
to follow up and maltreat certain individuals of the opposite party. 
They often carry them far away in order to separate them from the 
nest. If these excluded ants return and are found by their pursuers, 
they are again packed off and carried still farther. In one such case 
it happened that the persecutor brought his victim to the edge of my 
table. He then stretched out his head and let his enemy fall to the 
ground. It was not accident, for he repeated the act twice afterwards 
when I had brought his victim back upon the table. From the various 
individuals of his former enemies but present allies he had concentrated 
his antipath}" upon this one, and sought to make it impossible for him to 
return. One must have strong prepossessions to say that in such and 
man}^ similar cases ants do not form and execute resolves. It is true 
that these acts are confined to the paths along which the instincts of 
the species work and that the various steps in the execution of a 
resolve are performed instinctively. Further, 1 especially protest 
against ascribing to the will of the ant human considerations and 
abstract conceptions. Nevertheless, we must candidly confess that, 
reversing the positions, we men when executing our resolves con- 
stantly allow the intervention of inherited as well as secondary 
automatisms. While I am writing this my eyes are working with 
automatisms that are partly inherited and my hand w^ith secondary 
automatisms. It is of course understood that the complication of my 
innervations and the accompan^nng abstract deliberations are such as 
are peculiar to the human brain. 

It may be said in passing that we can explain in a similar manner 
the relative independence of the spinal (;ord and the subordinate cere- 
bral centers with reference to the cerebrum in the lower vertebrates 
(also in lower mammals) as compared with the close interdependence 
which those organs and their functions have in the mighty brain of 
man and to some extent in that of apes. The latter separate and con- 
trol their automatisms (divide et impera). 

While success visibly increases both the audacity of the ant and the 
pertinacity of its will, continu(>d failure or sudden surprise by power- 
ful enemies may occasion an inhibitive despondency leading to the 
neglect of the most important instincts, to cowardly flight, the eating 



598 I'SYCHICAL FACULTIES OF ANTS AND OTHER INSECTS. 

or casting' out of its own brood, the neglecting of work, etc. There 
ma}^ be a chronic increasing despondency in degenerate colonies and 
acute despondency occasioned by a lost battle. In the last case one 
may see a troop of large, strong ants fleeing, without anj^ attempt at 
defense, before a single small and weak enemy who is following them 
up. Half an hour before these fugitives would have killed the enemy 
by a few bites. It is remarkalile how quickly the victors note this dis- 
position and avail themselves of it. Discouraged ants are accustomed 
to collect after flight and soon regain their will and courage. Still they 
ofi'er but feeble resistance to a renewed attack of the same eneni}- if it 
is made, for example, on the following day. Even an ant's brain does 
not (piickly forget a defeat. 

In embittered conflicts between two approximately equal colonies 
the obstina,cy of the struggle increases and with it the will to conquer, 
until one colon}' or the other is completely overcome. In the domain 
of the will imitation pla3's a great part. Arrogance and despondency 
are also uncommonly contagious among ants. 

Domain of the emotions. — Most of the emotions of insects are closel}' 
])Ound up with instincts. This is the case with the jealousy of the 
queen bee who kills her rivals, and the anxiet}' of the latter who are 
yet in their cells; also with the rage of fighting ants, wasps, or bees, 
with the just-mentioned despondency of ants, the love for the brood, 
with the self-sacrifice of the working bees, who let themselves die of 
hunger in order to feed their queen, and with many more. There are 
also individual afl'ections not necessarih' conditioned by instinct, such 
as the desire of some ants to maltreat certain opponents, as we have 
stated. As the reverse of this, friendly services (feeding) ma}', as I 
have witnessed, be exceptionally offered to an enemy, a mutual feel- 
ing of sympathy and finally alliance may take place even between ants 
of different species. Also with ants sympathy, antipath}', and anger 
are heightened by repetition and by the acts corresponding to them, 
as is the case with other animals and with man. 

The feeling of social duty is instinctive among ants, and it varies 
^■ery much according to individuals, times, and occasions, which argues 
a certain plasticity. 

Psychical correlations. — I have hastil}' outlined the three chief 
domains of the psychology of ants. It is, of course, understood that 
here, as elsewhere, there is no sharp division between them. The 
will consists of the central resultants of the sense perceptions and the 
emotions, but reacts powerfully upon both of them. 

As long as bees are collected on only one species of flowers the}' 
overlook all other species and even other flowers of the same species. 
If their attention is directed to honey that they had previously over- 
looked, then they have eyes for that alone. An intensive emotion, 
like swarming among bees (Von Buttel) makes these insects forget all 



PSYCHICAL FACULTIES OF ANTS AND OTHEE INSECTS. 599 

enmities and even their old parent hive, .so that they return to it no 
more. If, however, the hive was painted bhie and the swarm is 
broken up b}' taking away the queen, the bees remember the lilue 
color of their old hive and fly to hives that have been painted l)lue. 
In a vswarm of restless, angrily buzzing bees who have lost their queen 
two emotions often conflict — that of enmity to strange bees and that of 
a need for a new queen. If a strange queen is now artificially intro- 
duced, they will maltreat or kill her, because the former emotion at 
first prevails. The bee keepers therefore give them a strange queen 
confined in a cage of wire gauze. The stranger odor then excites 
them less because it is more distant, and thev can not maltreat the 
queen. Thereupon they soon recognize the specific queen odor and 
can feed the strange queen through the meshes of the wire with their 
trunks. This suflices to immediately quiet the hive. Therefore the 
second emotion quickly prevails, the workers soon become accustomed 
to the stranger odor, and after three or four days the queen can be 
freed without danger. 

Among ants the love for dainties may be made to conflict with the 
sense of dut}" by allowing a colony of invading enemies to attack and 
then strewing honey in the path of the defenders that come streaming 
out. I did this with Formiea pratensh. At first the ants tasted the 
honey quite a little, but only for a moment. The sense of dutv con- 
quered and all, without exception, hastened to the battle, for the most 
part to death. Here the higher resolve or instinct prevailed over a 
lower inclination. 

I must to-day again maintain a thesis which I first advanced in 1877 
at the time of my installation as privat-docent in the Munich school 
for higher instruction: 

All the peculiarities of the human soul can be derived from the peculiarities of the 
souls of the higher animals. 

I will now add to this the following: "And all the peculiarities of 
the souls of higher animals can be derived from those of lower ani- 
mals." In other words, the doctrine of evolution is just as applicable 
in the psychical field as in the other fields of organic life. Through- 
out all the variety of animal forms and their conditions of existence 
the psychical functions of the nerve elements yet appear in all cases 
to obey certain elementar}" laws, even where the differences are so 
great that this wotdd be least expected.

MUSK OXEN IN CAPTIVITY. ' 



By JCL. SCIIIUTT, 

Director of tlie Zoological Garden in Copenhagen. 



The musk ox is undoubtedh' one of the most interesting- of the 
ruminants. Intermediate in form between the sheep and the ox, he is 
able, even better than the reindeer, to withstand high degrees of cold 
and to exist upon the scanty resources of the polar regions. In doing 
this he scorns lichens, the chief winter sustenance of the reindeer, and 
which were formerly erroneously considered as his principal food. 
It has been settled, especially through the investigations of Professor 
Nathorst, that the musk oxen of the arctic fields live upon grasses and 
other plants which to some extent keep fresh and green throughout 
the long polar winter, so that the animals have merely to paw awa}" 
the snow in order to get fodder. During the winter they are also 
nourished by the reserve of fat accumulated during the sununer, when 
in protected valleys the fruitful earth spreads out a rich carpet of 
grass. 

The hairy coat of the nuisk ox is warmer than that of any other 
mannnal. I-ndcr the long, dark-brown outer hair there grows during 
the autunm a thick coat of line, soft wool, which remains until the next 
summer, when it falls off in large flocks, the long, smooth outer hair 
remaining. Formerly the musk ox lived in all the countries lying 
about the north pole and was found much farther south than at pres- 
ent. Its fossil remains have been found in Siberia and England, as 
well as in Denmark, and even in German}-, about to the limit to which 
the ice of the glacial period extended. Yet it certainly was never 
abundant in our hemisphere, and, at any rate, it has not survived the 
glacial period, as has the reindeer, which extended farther north. 

At the present time it is found onl}' in the most northerly regions 
of the Western Hemisphere, both upon the continent and upon large 
circumpolar islands, especially in the northern and northeastern por- 
tions of Greenland. 

Since the time when the great Hudson's Ba}'^ Fur Compan}- was 
founded (1670) the skin of the musk ox has been known in Europe, 

« Translated from Der Zoologische Garten r Frankfurt A. M.), 1908, pp. 305-317.

and its flesh is very iiiucli esteemed ])y the fur traders, Indians, and 
Eskimos. The English naturalist. Pennant, pul)Iished a xerj correct 
description and picture of the animal in his work Arctic Zoology 
(1T84-1787), l)ut there had previously been published quite a good pic- 
ture in a (xerman illustrated work. Die Sfiugethiere in Abbildungen 
nach der Natur, Erlangen, 1778. The short, stubbed build of the ani- 
mal, its white legs, thickly covered with hair, its square rump, the 
light spot on the back, its Aviiitish muzzle covered with hair, as well 
as the strong horns characteristic of the male, and which in adult ani- 
mals reach down toward the ground, ai'e there conspicuously shown. 
The curvature of the horns is, however, not quite accurate. Cer- 
tainly the model for the drawing was only a stufl'ed one; yet natural- 
ists had the opportunity of o])serving the living animal in its native 
home, first in the numerous polar expeditions which had for their aim 
the discovery of the '"Northwest Passage,"" and then in those which

were sent out later to nrap the lands about the north pole and to reach 
the pole if possil^Ie. 

The lirst polar expeditions that went through Baffins Bay found 
both sides of Smiths Sound — that separates Grinnell Land from north 
Greenland — inhalnted l)v musk oxen. 

When Peary reached, with sledges, the north coast of Greenland and 
proved that it was a large island he likewise found musk oxen there. 
In the yeai" 1869-70 the German expedition under Koldewey found 
them in east Greenland, although not farthei" south than 73^ north 
latitude, and in greater numbers northward as far as 77'. 

Later, in the year 1892, the Ryders expedition met with them in 
Scoresbys Sound at about 71-, and farther south than that they have 
not l)een seen." Professor Nathorst notes, however, that neither 

"Note by Tkaxslator. — The writer doubtless refers here to their southern range 
in Greenland. On the continent thev range as far south as 60°. 



MUSK OXEN IN CAPTIVITY. 603 

Scoresby, who visited this liord in 1822, nor Claveriiig- and Sabine, 
who were in that region in 1823, .saw any musk oxen. Nathorst shows 
that these animals nmst have migrated quite sk)wly from tlie north- 
west side over Smiths Sound into Greenhind, and then along the north 
and east coasts until they tinally reached the deeply cut inlet of 
Scoresbjs Sound. 

It was also noted that they were followed l)y polar wolves that 
took from them many of their small calves. This is the most natural 
explanation of the fact that so few calves are seen with the herds 
observed. "In August, 1900," says the zoologist, Soren Jensen, " the 
Amdrup expedition saw in the regions north of Scoresbys Sound 
about 400 musk oxen, of which onl}^ 13 were cah'es." When we take 
into account the slaughter effected by the hunters who land when the 
ice permits it can be easily understood that the species is in danger 
of extermination. 

It was not until the year 1899 that an^^one succeeded in capturing a 
musk ox and bringing it alive into civilized countries. Even upon 
the continent of North America this was verj^ difficult, because it was 
usually necessary to transport the animals upon sledges over long* and 
trackless land journeys. Adult animals could hardlj^ be utilized, 
firstly, because of their untamable disposition and also because it was 
with great difficulty that they could become accustomed to new kinds 
of food. It therefore became necessary to look for calves. 

Finally, in the autumn of 1899, a Norweg'ian arctic hunter brought to 
Tromso two calves^ which he had captured at Clavering Island, on the 
east coast of Greenland. They were born in May of the same 3'ear, and 
while on the way he fed them partly on the arctic willows and grasses 
collected on the spot where they were taken, but chiefl}" on ship's 
biscuit. He knew ver}^ well the value of his captives and asked for 
the two calves 22,000 marks. He had, however, to be contented with 
10,000 marks, which were paid him by the wealth}' Duke of Bedford 
who has a large zoological garden at Woburn, in the south of England. 
One of the animals, however, was somewhat weakened and died soon 
thereafter; the other, a male, died a short time ago, in July of this 
year. It was very wild and on that account was kept in a strong 
inclosure where it could not easily be seen. 

This profitable capture led all the Norwegian seal hunters to think 
of giving up the capture of whales and seals and devoting themselves 
wholly to that of musk calves. At any rate, some of these hunters 
undertook such captures during tlu^ sununer of 1900. 

The Swedish expedition under Kolthotf, which was sent out to make 
zoological researches in the arctic regions, now undertook to get musk 
calves for acclimatization in northern Sw(h1(mi. Also the Danish 
expedition to eastern Greenland, under Amdrup, undertook, among 



604 MUSK OXEN IN CAPT1VITY« 

other thing's, to capture musk oxen, and empowered the author, as 
director of the ;^oolooical garden, to send with it assistants for this 
purpose. 

The sununer was a very favorable one, as the ice rarely prevented 
the vessel from approacliing the coast. As a result of all the eti'orts 
there was a total of 13 calves obtained. The Danes got a male calf, 
captured on the 12th of August and which arrived at the zoological 
garden at Copenhagen on the Tth of Octolter. Here it is still living-, 
and the photographs reproduced herewith show the progress of its 
development. The Swedes obtained two calves, a male and a female, 
which were put in a large inclosure in Norrland, wdiere they thrive 
excellently. The Norwegians relied upon expert hunters, so that they 
obtained no less than 9 calves, together with 1 male of 1899. It is 
not quite clear how they made this capture. The Danes, I am sorry 
to say. used the violent method of shooting down the whole herd of 
adult tinimals in order to obtain a calf or calves. It is stated that 
some of the Norwegians used a better method — namely, that of kill- 
ing only the mother. Then when the calf took flight with the herd 
thev did not ft)llow it. but secreted themselves near the dead cow. If 
the calf came back later to the body, they then captured it without 
nmch difficulty. 

The male of 1899 mentioned above was brought to Hammerfest. 
Unfortunately during the struggle that occurred at its capture it lost 
its left horn. It was sold to Carl Hagen})eck and by him disposed of 
to the Berlin garden, where it is still to be found. Its left horn has 
grown again, but the tip is wanting. 

Two brothers from Aalesund brought in no less than 5 calves, which 
they sent to the Antwerp garden. These, however, were so weak or 
so badly nourished that they died, either on the way or shortly after 
arrival. The remaining 4 arrived in Tromso. Informed of the mat- 
ter l)y Professor Nathorst, C. F. Liljevalch, a wealthy Swede, pur- 
chased them and brought them-to Medstugan, in Jemtland, in order to 
attempt to acclimatize them, as Nathorst thought that, on account of 
their fine wool, the}' would make valuable domestic animals. Unfor- 
tunately one of these had a wound on its back which, being under its 
thick coat, w^as not observed. It inflamed, and the animal died. The 
3 last (1 ])ull and 2 heifers) throve very well until the bull and one 
heifer succumbed on August 30 of last year to a contagious skin 
disease which carried ofl' a large number of domestic cattle in that 
region, both last year and the present one. The remaining cow is 
believed to have been taken to Norrland and placed with the 2 from 
the Kolthoff expedition. 

There are. therefore, at the present time (sunmier of 1903) living 
in Europe 5 musk oxen — 3 in Sweden, 1 in Berlin, and 1 in Copenha-

g-en," Unfortunatel}' the two last are both males; it is, however, not 
impossible that the attempt may succeed that is being- made at Copen- 
hagen to cross the musk ox with the somewhat nearly allied yak of 
Tibet. AVith his usual kindness and interest in scientific matters Carl 
Hagenbeck has ptaced at our disposal tw^o small, hornless yak cows. 

Our readers will find herewith a reproduction of a photograph of 
the smaller of these cow^s, which is hardly as large as the musk ox. 
Near by stands a white calf, which was 14 days old and was Ijorn from 
another white and somewhat larger cow. Lydekker (Royal Natural 
Histoi-y, vol. II, p. 188) sa3^s that this hornless, dwarf race has arisen 
by crossing with the ordinar}^ Indian cattle (dwarf zebu?). Yet noth- 
ing in the structure of this animal indicates a hybrid. Hornless, 
dwarf races of domestic cattle are indeed quite common. At the same 
time there will be placed with the musk ox a giant Frisian sheep, and 
then we shall see to which species he gives the preference. As regards 
the musk ox himself our pictures will sufiiciently show how^ excellently 
he has developed. The first autumn (1900) was very rainy and there- 
fore very unfavorable for him. He was uncomfortable and damp in 
his inclosure and could not njove about sufiiciently. As rheumatism 
began to afiect his legs, he was removed to another pen, made to move 
about dail}% and later walked about freely in the snow-covered garden 
ever}" day.* 

As in the spring of 1901 his horns began to grow and his disposi- 
tion became less friendly, he was placed in a spacious inclosure situated 
on a northerl}' slope. There an open veranda was built to his stall, 
and with this he was obliged to content himself in rainy weather. 
As all gregarious animals need society he w^as provided with compan- 
ions. After unsuccessful attempts with Shetland ponies and a bufl'alo 
calf, he was given a chamois and an old goat. To the latter he soon 
showed a great liking, a sentiment that has continued since that time. 
The chamois likewise made court to the goat, and this rivalry, together 
with daily squabbles at the feeding trough, made the musk ox and the 
chamois sworn enemies. This enmity has grown greater and greater 
and has had the most favorable effect upon the welfare of the musk 
ox. In order to follow and fight his quick-footed enemy he has to 
run, and therein* gets the necessary daily exercise. The chamois as 
a rule attacks, like a robber, from behind. In this wa}' he succeeded 
in the autumn of 1901 in butting his enemy, infiicting a l)loody wound 
upon his hind leg. As a punishment both of the horns of the chamois 
were tipped with sheaths, which, however, have now become unneces- 

« Besides these there were brought into Tromso, since the 26th of August, 1903, 
l)y a Norwegian hunter, 5 more calves of 1903—1 male and 4 females— which are at 
present (September 23) thriving well, but are held at a high price. See also the 
l)Ostscript at the end of this article.

,sai\v, as in the spring- of 1903 the chamois attacked his companion so 
boldly and vig-orouslj that he broke ott' the tips of both horns, and yet 
he is just as warlike as ever. 

Orig'inalh' the ground within the inclosure was partly overgrown 
with grass and partly covered with gravel. The hoofs of the musk 
ox were not sufficiently worn upon this soft ground, and they had 
to be cut and trimmed. The last cutting took place on September 24, 
1901, when the animal was a)>out sixteen months old. Each time he 
had to be bound and thrown down, and as the projecting horns might 
be injured and such violent measures also made the animal yet more 
untamable, quite sharp stones were spread upon the surface of the 
inclosure in order to make it similar to that of east Greenland. This 
was apparently" a good method, for, since then, the hoofs have been 
worn off sufficiently and in a natural manner by daily moving about 
upon the hard ground. Our pictures (pi. iv, figs. 1, 2) show" the last 
cutting, September 2'4, 1901. In the first picture the musk ox is seen 
with a noose about his nose and his legs tied together. A keeper 
holds his head down by grasping his right horn. To the left stands 
Professor Sand, of the veterinary school, with a knife in his hand. 
In fig. 2 the professor is seen bending over the animal while busy 
cutting the hoofs. 

The food of the musk ox consists of ground oats and wheat bran, 
with a very little white bread cut in pieces, besides hay (grass in sum- 
mer) and wdllow and elm branches throughout the 3'ear. He eats not 
only the leaves, but is especialh" fond of the bark, which he strips from 
even quite small branches, less than a centimeter in diameter. Tannic 
acid is as necessary" for the digestion of the musk ox as it is for the 
moose. His droppings are globular, like those of deer, goats, and 
sheep. 

The quantity of food taken can not be determined because the 
chaniois and the goat are fed together with him. Yet he takes care to 
preserve for himself his favorite parts — that is to say, the branches. 
The musk ox does not drink much and is in the habit of putting his 
feet into the drinking water; possibly inherited from a habit of cool- 
ing the feet in melting snow water. 

On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean the famous arctic explorer 
Greely captured 4 musk calves as long ago as 1881-1884, at Lady 
Franklin Bay north of Great Bear Sea. It was, however, impossible 
for him to provide food for them and take them with him. 

In March, 1898, Mr. C. J. Jones fitted out a small expedition to the 
barren lands, a portion of arctic North America, for the purpose of 
capturing musk calves. He succeeded in taking 5 of them, which he 
and his white companions drove southward. For two days and two 
nights they were obstinately pursued l)y arctic wolves, who wished to 
snatch their booty from them. When at last they got rid of the

wolves they fell asleep, exhausted, and when the}^ awoke the}^ found 
that some Indians had killed all their calves, having- the superstitious 
fear that all the musk oxen would leave the countiy, following- after 
their stolen comrades. 

These two fruitless attempts had considerably diminished the interest 
taken by the Yankees in these animals when it was again excited by 
the news of the fortunate capture made by the Norwegians. 

During the winter of 1900-1, an American whaler, Capt. H. H. 
Bodlish, was foixed to pass the winter on the North American coast of 
the Arctic Ocean. In March, 1901, he sent ashore a part of his force, 
accompanied by Eskimo hunters. At a distance of 30 English miles 
from the coast the}^ encountered a herd of musk oxen with 1 calves. 
They succeeded in capturing- all 1, but unfortunately 2 of them were 
almost immediately killed by the sledge dogs, l^he two surviving 
ones were tied fast upon two sledges, taken to the coast and got safely 
on board ship. The dogs succeeded, however, in killing still another 
and only the last one, a heifer calf, survived. It was fed with ship's 
l)iscuit, willow twigs, and grass collected on the coast, and at last it 
was safely brought to San Francisco. The owner asked $3,000 for it 
(about 11,000 kroner or 12,000 marks), but found no purchaser at that 
high price. Concerning this matter so many telegrams were exchanged 
that the shares of the Western Union Telegraph Company straight- 
way rose in value! Finall}^ a wealth}^ man purchased the calf and pre- 
sented it to the New York Zoological Park. On March 12, 1902, one 
year after it was taken, it arrived there. A short time after it was 
photographed, and our picture shows how it appeared when about 2 
years old. Its horns then measured 10 inches (21 centimeters) taken 
along the curvature. 

It is remarkable that this cow, taken from the western part of the 
continent, has itself a light spot upon its foreh«ad, the specific charac- 
ter that Lydekker has assigned to the so-called Orlbos imrdi, and that 
is especiall}' thought to distinguish the musk oxen of east Greenland 
from those of the continent, which are not usually so marked. This 
specific character does not, therefore, appear to be constant. It has 
long been known that the size and character of the light spots on the 
foreheads and backs of individuals of the same region and the same age 
are subject to nmch variation. This has already been placed beyond 
doubt bj" the experienced Danish zoologist, Herhif ^^'inge, in his 
excellent work on the mammals of Greenland. In connection with 
this there may also be mentioned Dr. J. A. Allen's article in the 
Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History. 

I am sorry to say that the New York Zoological Park did not long 
enjoy this rare animal. In August he was taken with an inflammation 



608 MUSK OXEN IN CAPTIVITY. 

of the lungs, and, after an illness of a week, died in spite of all the 
efforts of the veterinary surgeons. 

A month later Peary brought to the park a small calf which he had 
captured in northeast Greenland. It died three weeks afterwards 
because of an abscess on the back, which had doubtless arisen from a 
small wound unobserved under the thick fur. Wo have here a case 
similar to that of one of the calves brought to Jemtland in 1900. 

But our antipodes on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean may con- 
sole themselves with the reHection that .they possess the only musk 
oxen that are at present living in a wild state upon the globe. We 
rightly say at present, for how long will this self-supj)orting animal 
be able to prolong its life and propagate its race, even in the desolate 
and inhospital)le regions to which it has been driven? How long, 
indeed? The insatiable enemies of the nuisk ox, the arctic wolf and 
man — the most ravening wolf of all creation — follow on his tracks 
and incessantly thin his ranks. Unfortunately, the ice does not alwa3"S 
protect the east coast of Greenland against the landing of hunters as 
well as it did in 1901 and ltH)2. 

We hope that the attempts at acclimatization which are now being 
made in Sweden, at the instance of Professor Nathorst, will be 
crowned with success. That excellent naturalist and unwearied arctic 
explorer conceived the idea that the musk ox might be domesticated 
and his extraordinarily Hne wool utilized. The impetuous temper of 
the animal will, however, probal)lv make such an undertaking very 
onerous; at an}" rate, much patience and the work of several genera- 
tions will be required for its success. 

Postscript. — Professor Nathorst states, April 7, 1904, that of the 
pair caught by Kolthoff the cow died in the autumn of 1903 of a liver 
complaint (intestinal worms), upon which the bull was taken to 
Jemtland to be bred .with the cow left there. Together with this 
decrease of the numlier of musk oxen in Europe we can report an aug- 
mentation, as the Norwegians have been successful again. Capt. Johan 
Thjeldsoii, of the steamer Laura., belonging to Magnus K. Gicever, 
brought home to Tromso at the end of August, 1903, 5 live musk 
calves. These were all caught in east Greenland. The first one wa> 
caught in the jNlusk Ox Bay, where Kolthoff in 1900 had found a num- 
ber of oxen, and where now they met with onlj' half a score. At Cape 
Graah they came across a flock with 3 calves. Having destroyed the 
adult animals, the}^ caught the cah'es in nets. One of them, however, 
had been grazed in the belly and died a few days after. At Mackenzie 
Bay they caught 2 more calves. These 5 animals (1 bull and -4 heifers) 
were placed in a paddock at Tromso. One of them was smaller than 
the others and rather delicate. She died in November, whereas the 
others were getting on well. Unfortunately, one of the heifers strangled 
itself later on in an attempt to get out of the paddock. The young

biiir.s legs are said to be bad, possibly from rheumatism, owing to the 
moist climate. The musk ox in Copenhagen also suffered from that 
the first autumn. He is getting on splendidly, but has not shown 
the slightest sign of interest in any of the females (yak cow and 
Frisian sheep) proffered him. 

One of the surviving heifers from Tromso is now (July 15, 1904) in 
the garden at Copenhagen, having been secured at a cost of 3,000 
kroner, so that at present the garden has the unique distinction of 
possessing a pair of these animals. Unfortunately the female is yet 
too young for breeding. The other heifer is in the zoological garden 
at Hamburg. 

From recent information it appears that there remains in Sweden 
but one specimen, a cow born in 1900, and that the bull in Norwa}^ 
has also succumbed. 



FROZEN MAMMOTH IN SIBERIA/' 



Bv O. F. Herz. 



[About the middle of April, 1901, the Imperial Academy of Sciences 
of St, Petersburg was informed b}" V. N. Skripitsin, governor of 
Yakutsk, of the discovery of a mammoth in an almost perfect state of 
preservation frozen in the cliff along the river Berezovka, the right 
tributary of the river Kol3aiia, about 200 miles northeast of Sredne- 
Kolymsk (about 800 miles westward of Bering Strait and some 60 
miles within the Arctic Circle). 

Thanks to the courtesy of Finance Minister Witte, 16,300 rubles 
were assigned for the prompt dispatch of an expedition to examine 
and secure this valuable tind. 

O. F. Herz, a zoologist of the Imperial Academ}' of Sciences, was 
appointed chief of the expedition; E. V. Pfizenmeyer, a zoological 
preparator of the same institution, and D. P. Sevastianoff, a geolog- 
ical student of the Yuryevck University, his assistants. The expedi- 
tion started from St. Petersburg on May 3, 1901, and its chief reached 
the mammoth region on September 9. On August 28 the expedition 
was joined by Mr. Hoi'n, a police official from Sredne-Kolymsk.] 

August 31- September 6. — Upon reaching Mysova, on the Kolyma 
River, I was informed that the Cossack Yavlovski had but a few daj'S 
previously gone to the mammoth region, about 85 miles distant, hav- 
ing understood that the academy expedition would not reach Sredne- 
Kolymsk before winter, and that upon his return, in three or four 
days, I should be able to continue the journey. Yavlovski arrived on 
September 3, and tliough the tidings he brought were somewhat dis- 
couraging, there was yet liope for success. He had intended to visit 
the mammoth region in the spring, but had been hindered by serious 
illness, from which he only recently recovered. Were it not for this 
mishap he would have covered the tind with stones and earth, and thus 
prevented it from injury by rain and beasts of prey. Owing to 

« Extracts translated from report of O. F. Herz, chief of the expedition of the 
Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg, to the river Berezovka for excava- 
tion of frozen mammoth. Entire report in Russian in Bulletin of the Imperial

niit'ortunate circumstances, Yavlovski tells me that rains during the 
summer had washed a mass of earth down the slope in which the mam- 
moth lies, so that bones were toi"n from the hind part of the body, 
the entire back was exposed, and most of the head skin was devoured 
by bears and wolves. At the iirst examination the trunk was already 
gone. Yavlovski reported that he had collected all the bones l^^ing 
about, i^laced them on top of the animal, and covered all with earth 
and stones, so that no more damage would be likely to result before 
my arrival. As he saw no hair or wool on the exposed parts, he 
thought that either there had been none or else it had been washed 
away by the rains. 

1 am very sorry I could not see the Lamut, S. Tarabykin, who dis- 
covered the mammoth, but he was absent at this time. I can therefore 
give the details of the discovery only as related to me, as follows, by 
Yavlovski: About the middle of August, 19()0, while the Lamut 
Tarabykin was chasing a deer, he found a mammotirs tusk, weighing 
about 166 English pounds, a little above the present find, and continu- 
ing the search soon discovered the well-preserved head of a second 
mammoth protruding from the ground, upon which, however, there 
was but one tusk. On account of the superstitious fear that the 
Lamuts have of whole mammoth bodies, whose excavation they believe 
produces sickness, Tarabykin returned to his tent, about 15 miles dis- 
tant, and told of his discovery to the two Lamuts, JNI. Tapchin and 
V. Dietkov. These two men visited me twice at the place of discovery, 
and after persistent inquiry informed me tliat at the time of tinding 
the animal the skin upon its head had alreadj^ partly decayed, and 
that there was no trunk, or '^ nose," as they described it. The Lanuits 
said that at the part where they chopped off the tusk, on the day fol- 
lowing the discovery, there was left only a small piece of decayed skin. 
They" ])elieved that the head had been exposed for about a year before 
they found it, but insisted that they had never seen it before, as it was 
the first time they had visited the place, and that in general they had 
never before in their lives seen a mammoth. We must observe that 
the Lamut Tapchin was over 90 years old. 

At the end of August, 1000, all three Lamuts repaired to Kolyma, 
where they sold the two tusks to Yavlovski, telling him that the 
smaller tusk, weighing a little over 63 pounds, belonged to a mam- 
moth which was probably still in the ground in a good state of 
preservation, but which they dared not touch. The Cossack Yav- 
lovski, being the more intelligent man, understood the importance of 
this discovery and agreed to meet them on the 1st of November and 
go with them to see the mammoth. He told the Lamuts that if what 
they related was true he would report it to the Emperor, which might 
result in the fitting out of an expedition to transport the entire animal 
to St. Petersburg. This satisfied the Lamuts, but it is to be regretted 



FROZEN MAMMOTH IN SIBERIA. 613 

that Tavlovski did not then instruct them to cover the mammoth with 
earth. 

Early in Novem])er, 190(1, Yavlovski, accompanied b}" the Lamiits, 
visited the mammoth. He cut a piece of skin from the head, a similar 
piece from the left thigh, and secured a small portion of the stomach, 
with its contents, and brought these, together with the tusk, to 
Sredne-Kolynisk as proofs of the discovery, giving them to the assist- 
ant police commissioner, N. L. Horn, who decided to convince himself 
of the importance of the find and then to report the matter to the 
governor of Yakutsk. The parts mentioned were therefore forwarded 
to the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg, where they 
were due after our departure. 

' In the middle of December, Horn and Yavlovski together examined 
the manmioth and reported the matter to the governor of Y^akutsk, 
who in turn forwarded Horn's report to St. Petersburg. 

Septeiiiher 11^ 1901. — It was so warm to-day that the soil became 
loose and easily handled, and I was able to begin the work of excava- 
tion. The manunoth is located a third of a mile from our tents and 
35 meters above the present level of the water, on the left bank 
of the river Berezovka. The bod}' lies in a cliff that faces east and 
extends for a mile in a semicircle. The demolished portion of the cliff 
inclines toward the river at an angle of 35^ from the upper layer of 
earth, over which extend the ''taiga," or Siberian marshy forest. 
The surface of the cliff is 113 meters wide and 55 meters high. The 
bod}' of the mannnoth is 62 meters back from the bank of the river. 
According to measurements I took in different places the upper strata 
of earth, covered with a layer of moss, is 30 to 52 centimeters thick. 
Beneath this is a loamy mass, one-third loam and two-thirds earth, 
averaging 2 meters in thickness, though in some places more than 
4 meters thick, mixed with stones, roots, and pieces of wood, with 
lamellar plates of ice, 15 to 18 centimeters thick, stretching through 
the mass. Underneath this alluvial layer there is a vertical wall of 
ice, which stands free for a distance of 5 meters, and in some places 
even 7 meters above the mammoth. This ice wall probably inclines 
to the river at the same angle as the entire cliff' region. I intend to 
investigate this wall later. Upon this supposed ice incline are huge 
shapeless earth masses and mounds, evidently moved downward dur- 
ing heavy rains by the gradual thawing of the ice wall, as well as by 
the water which falls from the upper "taiga" and from the hill, 120 
meters high, that rises in the rear of the wall about a sixth of a mile 
from the river bank. According to the Lamut natives of the region, 
the head of the mammoth was exposed two years ago by this down- 
ward movement, or by the breaking away of a considei-able mass of 
earth; the rest of the body was exposed only at the end of August, 
1900. 



614 FROZEN MAMMOTH IN SIBERIA. 

After taking some pictures 1 eominenced to open up the mammoth 
mound. The skull was soon exposed. Unfortunately luost of the 
head skin had been devoured by carnivorous animals during the past 
summer. To my greatest surprise I found well-preserved food frag- 
ments between the teeth, Avhieli serves as proof that our manunoth, 
after a short death struggle, died in this very position. The fact that 
what we found was food and not substance carried in recently was 
later proved by comparing it witli the stomach contents. 

Upon the left half of the bone between the jaws I could see marks 
of the ax whicli the Lamuts used in chopping off the tusk, and could 
thus determine detinitely that the tusk that I had seen in Sredne- 
Kolymsk was from this particular mammoth, for 1 had carefully 
measured and studied the cuts upon it. The right tusk evidently had 
fallen out long ago, for I could find no traces of its forced severance 
from 'the head. The lower jaw. which was fast in the ground, lay 
upon a large piece of skin, whicli appeared later to belong to the 
upper part of the chest. 

1 first gave orders to carefully remove the mound of earth about 
the mammoth, beginning with the head. At a depth of 68 centi- 
meters we found the left fore leg, still covered with hair on all sides 
up to the humerus. The epidermis had apparentlv completely rotted, 
but on account of the moist earth the hair still clung to the skin. In 
a frozen condition we may perhaps succeed in getting it to St. 
Petersl)urg. 

So far as a preliminary examination can determine, the hair on the 
upper part of the left fore leg consists of a yellowish-brown crumpled 
under coat 25 to 30 centimeters long, with a thiyk upper bristle-like 
coat, the hairs of which have ragged ends, are rust-brown, and 10 to 
12 centimeters long. The left fore leg is bent, so that it is evident 
that the mammoth tried to crawl out of the pit or crevice into which 
he proba])ly fell, ])ut apparently he was so badly injured by the fall 
that he could not free himself. 

Fvu-ther excavation exposed also the right fore leg, which had 
become turned almost horizontally under the abdomen during the 
animal's fall. Only a very insignificant portion of the upper bristly 
coat was preserved upon this leg, while the yellowish-])rown under 
coat was preserved in several places. Upon the left hind leg I also 
found portions of decayed flesh, in which the muscular bundles were 
easily discernible. The stench emitted by this extremity was unbear- 
able, so that it was necessary to stop work every minute. A thorough 
washing failed to remove the horrible smell from our hands, and yet 
we were obliged to perform part of our task with bare hands. 

Septeniber P2. — After we removed the earth from under the left leg 
the thick hair on the under side came to view, especiall}' that on the 
foot joint. Some of this hair fell oflF with the earth, but the larger

part will be saved by bandages. In the midst of the yellowish-brown 
under wool, which in color resembles the summer coat of a young 
camel, there are very thickly set hairs of the bristly coat 10 to 12 
centimeters long. The color of this hair on the under side of the leg 
may best be described as roan, while that on the outer and inner side 
up to the middle of the forearm is dark brown, somewhat lighter at 
the ends. Five hoof-shaped blunt nails could also be seen at the end 
of the digits. 

The wool of the left hind leg, varying in color from rust-brown to 
roan, was not so thick as upon the fore leg, judging b}^ the loosened 
remains of the hair, and the yellowish-brown under coat was here a 
little shorter. The length of the ragged end hairs varies from 4 to 12 
centimeters. The roots of the hair had rotted away together with 
the epidermis. 

After midday we dug away the mound of earth to a depth of 2 A 
meters on the right side of the mammoth. In the mound, l3'ing 
between the upper layer of earth and the vertical ice wall, roots and 
other parts of trees and also bowlders were found lodged. Under 
this layer of earth, 2i meters thick, I first struck water ice 18 centi- 
meters thick, caused b}^ a thaw; then a thin layer of earth; under this 
again another layer of ice, and then the right fore leg of the mammoth 
came to view. The wool that had probably covered the upper side of 
this leg was entirely gone, most likely torn away by the sliding masses 
of ice and earth. The same was true of the wool on the other sides of 
the animal. 

The right fore leg was so placed as to indicate that the mammoth 
after falling had supported himself on this leg while attempting to 
step forward with the left one. We concluded that while in this stand- 
ing position he became exhausted and died on this very spot, and that 
he had by no means been washed there by the water from elsewhere. 
The presence of a thick wool shows that the animal was well adapted 
to endure cold, and it is improbable that he died from hunger, for a 
large quantity of fragments of food was in his stomach. His head 
faces south. 

Sepfern.her 13.— To-day we took photographs. 1 searched the vicinity 
for bones of other animals and found horns of the northern deer l3'ing 
about everywhere. 

Septemher llf. — In an cfl^ort to find remnants of the trunk, I ordered 
that the mound be opened up farther south and southeastw^ard, but I 
did not find them. This part was no doubt exposed before the rest 
and had long ago (nther decayed or been devoured. I examined every 
shovelful of earth, but I found only indefinite fragments of very brit- 
tle hair, and that was all. 

A bone found 1.82 meters to the south of the right cavity was sub- 
sequently determined to be a part of the skull of a northern deer.

After dinner I began clearing the ice away from the right side. Near 
the outside of the right fore leg the ice was brownish in color, with 
bubbles, and 23 centimeters tliick, and 27 centimeters thick over the 
sole of the right fore foot, which also faced the south, as did the left 
hind leg. Beneath both legs there was a laj^er of ice 3 centimeters 
thick, which, after the final loosening of the animal, was found to 
extend beneath the entire body. From the right hind leg northward, 
in the direction of the highland, the ice ran thicker, being at first 54 
centimeters, while 86 centimeters from the sole it was 71 centimeters 
thick; then came the earth layer. The ice layer, 71 centimeters at its 
thickest part, extends to the middle of the right side of the abdomen, 
where it becomes 10 centimeters thick. 

A very interesting discover}^ was made at a distance of 13 centime- 
ters from the upper edge of the sole of the right hind foot, namely, 
the very hairy end of the tail, which was subsequently thawed out and 
examined. (See September 21.) 

8epteinl>ei' 15. — The snow has completely disappeared off the cliff. 
I stopped further excavation, however, in order to resume it when 
my companions, who were left behind, shall arrive and Mr. Sevas- 
tianofl' can make the geological surve3\ In order to be able to dis- 
member the mammoth after severe cold weather has set in, 1 am dis- 
posed to build over the animal a structure that can be heated, and for 
this purpose I will order, one of these days, the cutting and planing 
of timber. Meanwhile I covered the animal with tarpaulin to protect 
it from possible snowing under. 

Sejdemher 16. — During clear weather I made a trip to the top of 
the hill eastward of here and brought from there some specimens of 
mountain flora. I append a sketch of the Berezovka as seen from 
there. 

September 17. — The cliff region extends along the loop made by the 
Berezovka and along the deep channel of this river a half mile farther 
south, where it graduall}' becomes lower. During spring high tide 
masses of earth are detached from the cliff". 

Further geological research will determine how the cliff region was 
formed, and j'et, although I am not a geologist, I regard it my duty to 
here express my personal views. According to my opinion, the entire 
cliff' region rests upon a glacier, which was disintegrating and in which 
there were deep crevices. The water that flowed down from the 
•'taiga,"" or from the neighboring hills, mixed with earth, stones, and 
pieces of wood, gradually filled these crevices. The whole was later 
covered with a layer of soil, upon which a rich flora doubtless devel- 
oped that served as excellent food for mammoths and other animals. 
Whether this flora was identical with the present flora can be deter- 
mined only when the food fragments found in the mouth and stomath 
of the manunoth shall have been examined and compared wnth the

plants I collected on the elitf. The upper layer of earth was at that 
time probably not yet everj^where iirm enough to support the weight 
of mammoths, and probably our specimen broke through into a 
crevice, which would account for his position and for the fracture of 
such heavy bones as the pelvis and the right forearm. After falling,

the mammoth no doubt tried to crawl out, the position of l^oth fore 
legs being peculiailj^ like that of an animal making such effort, but 
the injuries were so serious that his strength gave way and he soon 
perished. The pit, 4 meters square, dug with the spade after the 
mammoth was removed, showed that the ice wall must be quite deep, 



618 FEOZEN MAMMOTH IN SIBERIA. 

probably reaching- below the channel of the river. At a depth of 1.7 
meters in this pit I found ice similar to that of the upper part of the 
ice wall. 

About 100 meters north and even lower than the mammoth's g-rave 
there is an ice cliff covered l)v a layer of earth 2^ meters thick and 
structurally identical with the upper wall. The exposed ice is brown- 
ish earthy in color and contains numerous air bubbles, some of them 
elongate, averaging 2 to 5 millimeters in length; others spherical, 
averaging 1^ to 2 millimeters in diameter. Among the bubbles, 
which are often connected, there are thin laj-ers of sand or cla}^ that 
in places form small lumps. Deeper down in the cliff the ice becomes 
more solid and transparent, in some places entirel}^ white and brittle. 
After remaining exposed to the air even for a short time this ice again 
assumes a 'yellowish-brown color and then looks like the old ice. The 
ice, on the other hand, which is formed from melted ice and snow is 
always transparent, white, and hard, and on account of the longer 
vertical air l)ubbles, which attain a length of over 20 millimeters, 
assumes a streaked appearance. 

That the ice wall was formed from snow I regard as unlikely, 
because the entire mountain faces directly east, and throughout sum- 
mer is su])jected to the sun's rays to such an extent that a considerable 
portion of the snow must have been melted by these rays as well as 
by the heated mass of stones of the neighboring mountain crest. Do 
we not see here before us primitive or, as Baron Toll puts it, stone ice, 
which resulted from the previous glacial period? 

It is difficult to presume here the formation of a glacier valley that 
could have attained a height of 50 meters, for sucli a damiuing of the 
water as would cause the formation of a valley can not be admitted 
when the depth of the Berezovka is taken into consideration. 

September 18. — To-day we moved fi'om the tents into the new 
winter house, built under my instructions in the woods, in a place pro- 
tected from the northern winds. Toward evening we succeeded in 
establishing ourselves and felt quite comfortable, supping near the 
fireplace in a well- warmed room. 

September 19. — In several pits in the earth I found well-preserved 
parts of Betula nana, which no longer grows upon elevated places, 
though in well-protected spots one occasionally finds stems about as 
thick as a man's arm. 

The timber asssigned for the building of a house over the mammoth 
is already cut and prepared and we can commence putting it up as 
soon as our fellow-travelers arrive. 

Despite the fact that the mannnoth is in a frozen condition, the 
stench emitted is very disagreeal)le. 

Sejptemher W. — At the exact hour of my prediction Mr. Pfizenmeyer 
arrived this afternoon with the rest of the transport equipment. To

my surprise, Mr. Sevastianoff was not with him, as he returned from 
Mysova to Sredne-Kolymsk, together with Mr. Horn. 

September ^21. — To-day, in the wnnter house, we. began to thaw out 
the tail end, which we found on the 14th instant, but soon stopped the 
work as all the hair threatened to fall off. This tail end is 22 centi- 
meters long and the hairs at the extremity, penetrating an icy-earth 
mass, are 10 centimeters long. The hairs stand in bunches around 
the end of the tail. When warmed, however, these separate from the 
skin, together with the epidermis, only at the very end. Part of the 
hair is still fast in the skin. The hairs on the basal end of the tail and 
a little farther down are dirt}^ yellow ocher in color, while those at the 
distal end are black. The thin ends of the hair are partly broken off. 
The hairs at the middle of the tail end are a very few centimeters 
longer than the others, and their color is ocher at the base, then black, 
and at the very end passes into whitish. 

Se])temher 25.- — The building over the mammoth is fast advancing 
toward completion. As we proposed to build this structure below 
the upper wall of the skull, we removed the latter, after which we 
could take out the remnants of food from between the molars on the 
left side. These remnants appear masticated and apparently do not 
contain parts of pine needles or larch, but only fragments of various 
grasses. The imprint of the tooth crenations is well preserved upon 
the food bits. There is also a small quantit}" of food upon the Avell- 
preserved tongue, but I can secure this only when the lower jaw is 
removed. 

The most devoted mother could not carry her child more carefully 
than I carried these fragments of antediluvial fauna to our winter hut. 

When the Lamuts discovered the mammoth they could not see the 
fragments of food, for the lower jaw was then still in the ground. 
This was confirmed by Tarabykin's companions, whom I questioned 
closely on this point. 

Septeviher 26. — To-day 1 took the principal measurements of the 
mammoth as they are given in the accompanying drawings. I also 
collected the plants that are partly under the snow. 

Septemher 28. — To-da}^ we finished the roof of the house over the 
mammoth. 

Septemher 30. — To-day we made the first experiments in heating 
the house, and the arrangement appears to be excellent. However, 
we have 3^et to Ijuild a wooden partition, so that the animal may not 
be exposed directly to the fire, however low it may be. But in order 
that the mammoth should not freeze it is necessary to keep a steady 
fire day and night. 

October 1. — As it was found too dark in the house, a second open- 
ing was made near the door. To serve as window panes we placed 
pieces of ice in both openings and hung an elk's skin over the door.

FROZEK MAMMOTH IN SIBERIA. 



Odoljtr 2. — We began this day to clear the earth away from the 
occiput and back. Doing this we exposed several broken ribs. We 
also dug up several lumbar vertebra which had been torn out b}- wild 
beasts or else forced out by the sliding earth. 

Under the right middle part of the abdomen, which was still covered 
with earth, we found a yellowish-brown underwool 20 to 30 centi- 
meters long, Avhich, however, was so crumpled and mixed Avith earth 
that we saved only a small portion of it. 

We also collected and deposited in a bag the underwool and bristles 
from the right cheek. The latter are 30 centimeters long and -broken

oflf at the ends; the color varies from black to pale blonde; the black 
hairs predominate, and are lighter toward the ends. 

October 3. — After removing the last laj-er of earth from the back, 
the remains of food in the stomach were exposed. The latter was 
badly decayed. We could not continue our work here owing to the 
solidly frozen condition of everything. After dinner we removed 
the right side of the abdomen in order to permit the access of heat 
from the fireplace into the interior of the body. 

October 4. — Before noon we removed the left shoulder blade and 



FROZEN MAMMOTH IN SIBERIA. 621 

part of the ribs, and then cleaned part of the stomach, which contained 
an immense quantity of food remnants. The walls of the stomach 
first exposed were dark coffee-brown, almost black in color, and were 
badly decayed and torn, even where they were not injured mechan- 
ically. 

In the afternoon we severed the left fore leg between the shoulder 
and forearm in hopes of saving the wool, which still clung to the leg, 
and which might have fallen away during subsequent tha^wing. 
Besides, this amputation was made necessary by the left side of the 
abdomen. 

Octoher 5. — To-day we first skinned the left side and exposed several 
ribs, which were mostl}^ very well preserved. The stomach with its 
contents is becoming more and more exposed, while the other organs 
are destroj^ed. Then we skinned the head, of which the following 
parts were preserved: The cheeks, the right e3'elid with the deep e3"e- 
lash fold, part of the skin from the sinciput, three-fouilhs of the 
upper lip, and the very well-preserved under lip. This latter was also 
beset b}' scattered spines or bristles, which, however, adhered to the 
ground and were mixed up with other hair, so that it was impossible 
to pick them out. The skin from the head, which was already deca3'^ed 
in several places, we immediatel}^ treated with alum and salt. 

In the afternoon we removed the left shoulder, upon which, how- 
ever, we allowed the tendon and muscular fibers to remain. 

The flesh from under the shoulder, which is fibrous and marbled 
with fat, is dark red in color and looks as fresh as well-frozen beef or 
horse meat. It looked so appetizing that w.e wondered for some time 
whether we should not taste it, but no one would venture to take it into 
his mouth, and horseflesh was given the preference. The dogs cleaned 
up whatever mammoth meat was thrown to them. 

The layer of fat beneath the skin is 9 centimeters thick. It is 
white, odorless, spongy, and readily cut. The flesh between the ribs 
and skin, as well as the membrane under the ribs, could easih' be pulled 
off in separate laj^ers without special effort. 

The skin on the left shoulder is 19 millimeters thick, and on the 
right side 23 millimeters. 

The Ifig bunches of hair that stuck in the frozen ground near the 
lower lip, and which belonged to the chin and chest, are 36 centimeters 
long, torn as the}^ are. " Estimating the broken-off ends to be one- 
third the entire length (based on the thickness of the hair at tiie break), 
we may assume that these hairs were approximately^ 50 centimeters 
long. The bristly hairs which stuck in the ground immediateh' 
behind the lower lip are black, while those pointing to the fore legs 
are ash-blonde in color. In view of the fact that it is impossible to 
pick out these hairs urn'njured, I shall save the entire clod of earth in 
a frozen state. 



622 FROZEN MAMMOTH IN SIBERIA. 

Of leng-th similar to that of the above-mentioned hairs is the hair 
shed from the outer side of the left shoulder blade, which I removed. 
Judging by the remnants of the separate hard bristle-like hairs that 
I observed on the skin, they were of the same length, extending per- 
haps along the back. Beginning with the destroyed epidermis, up to 
the very ends, these hairs are ashy or pale blonde in color. The 
shoulder bore the longest hair found thus far, and is probably what 
has been erroneously called the mammoth mane. The applicability of 
this name will be possible onh^ when it shall be proven that no other 
part of the mammoth was covered with such long hair. 

The hairs upon the belh^ are reddish-brown at the base, chestnut- 
blonde in the middle, and yellowish at the ends. 

The hairs on the left cheek are 23 centimeters long, partly chestnut- 
brown to black, partly blonde. The under wool is not so thick as on 
the other parts of the skin, the hairs being yellowish as everywhere 
else, and 35 centimeters long. 

The bristle-like hairs of the spine retain their elasticity so long as 
they remain in the fresh air, but in the temperature of our winter 
house they hardened instantly and became very brittle. I keep every- 
thing, therefore, in the fresh air. 

Octoher 6. — We bandaged the left fore leg, packed it in hay, then 
wrapped it in sackcloth, so that all the wool will probably remain 
intact. In Srednc-Kolymsk we shall, in addition, sew all these things 
up in skins, of which I have not enough here. 

From the stomach we removed about 27 pounds additional of food 
remains. We then amputated tlie right fore leg above the shoulder 
blade, cut it open down to the forearm and removed the shoulder 
bone, which was broken in the middle, evidentl}^ injured when the 
mammoth fell. We would gladly have transported the leg intact, but 
for its too great weight for one dog sled. The flesh and fat are well 
preserved and will be packed for shipment. No hair was found on 
the outer and anterior sides of the right fore leg, and from the under 
side of this leg I succeeded in saving only what I found in beautiful 
laj^ers in the ice. 

I collected hits of blood, which resembled small pieces of potassium 
permanganate. When melted, these bits turn into dirt}^ dark-red 
spots, which are easil^y washed ofl. To the touch they resemble 
coarse dry sand. Similar blood occurs also between the stomach and 
the sternum, whereas blood that was taken from above the sternum 
and the shoulder blades had a bright clay-yellow color, and to the 
touch felt like chalk. Separated by a layer of cotton, I put these 
two kinds of blood in a bag. 

The stench is not near so intolerable as during the first two days, 
possibly because we have grown accustomed to it. 



FROZEN MAMMOTH IK SIBERIA. 623 

October 7.- — To-day we first packed up the rig-ht leg and then 
resumed the cleaning of the stomach. Those parts of the stomach that 
were exposed to the air for any length of time tear even when most 
cautiously touched, exactly like the membrane beneath the ribs. I 
succeeded, however, in removing from the bod}^ a considerable portion 
of the stomach with its contents, which I take with me in a good state 
of preservation. 

In the afternoon we succeeded in exposing" that part of the body 
which we could not reach before, and which lay all the time in the 
frozen g'round. This part was 9 centimeters lower than the left fore- 
arm, and 13 centimeters lower than than the sole of the left hind foot, 
and proved to be the protruded male genital, 86 centimers long above 
and 105 centimeters long below; 10 centimeters above the urinary 
meatus; the diameter of the flattened-out penis is 19 centimeters. 

Octobei' 8. — The more the hind part becomes free the more difficult 
becomes the work. The left side of the broken pelvis was removed. 
The flesh beneath the pelvis is still frozen and hard as stone, just like 
the flesh about the shoulder blades. Near the stomach there is a lump 
of ice which we must remove little b}" little. The cross bone or sacrum 
was found intact. 

Oetoher 9. — This morning we cut off' the left hind leg and the right 
hind one this afternoon. The thigh bones, which were severed with 
great difficulty from the frozen meat that surrounds them, were so 
strongly connected with the tibia that it was necessar}^ to cut all these 
bones out together and dismember them the next day. 

The color of the hair of the right hind fenuir varies from rust- 
brown to black. Best of all preserved was the hair in the skin fold 
between the genital and the left hind leg. The crumpled hair of the 
under wool is 30 to 3.5 centimeters long; the bristly hair is 32 centi- 
meters long. I saved some pathological growths f roui the right shoul- 
der bone, also some layers of hair with exact descriptions as to their 
position on the body. 

October 10. — After removing about 270 pounds of flesh we started 
the raising of the abdominal skin, which turned out to be still quite 
bulk}^ and which we had decided must be cut up. After raising the 
piece of skin, which weighed about 170 pounds, we discovered, to 
our greatest joy, the entire tail of the. mammoth, and by means of it 
explained the other puzzling point. The joy that possessed us at this 
new discover}^ was so great that, lowering the skin to the ground 
again, we gave three loud cheers. We could not decide to cut up 
the still intact piece of skin, as we wished to be able to bring this 
interesting object intact to the academy. 

The tail is short, and consists evidentl}^ of 22 to 25 caudal vertebrge. 
It is not as long as the drawing made under Von Brandt's supervision,

aud more nearly resembles the tail drawn b}^ Boltunoff, though it 
defective in other respects. 

The hard bristly hairs, which are broken off to about one-third thei 
length, indicate that the end of the tail was covered with long haii 
that became fastened in the layer of ice underneath the entire body 
These hairs were drawn out of the ice, however, with great care 
They are 20 to 25 centimeters long, and, like the bristly hair on th.

centimeters.

The width of the anal opening is 28 centimeters, and the length of 
the somewhat drawn-out skin extending between the base of the penis 
and that of the tail is 1.32 meters. 

The base of the tail, together with the anus, were located 41 centi- 
meters lower than the under side of the left hind tibia. 

The reason that Boltunoff, in his drawing, figured excrescences on 
the fetlocks, which indicate the presence of rudimentary metacarpal 
or metatarsal bones, is explained by the fact that the mammoth he 
saw in all probability had just such a mass of hair at the bend of the 
leg as this mammoth found on the Beresovka. 

October 11. — To-day we performed the last operations on the mam- 
moth, after which all the parts were brought into the winter house 
and securely packed away for transportation. 



A SUMMARY OF GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE 
SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES/' 



By Emile G. Racovitza. 



To avoid repetition in the description of the habits of the different 
species which we have observed, I propose to group in this chapter a 
certain number of ideas relative to the life of the whales in general. 
There is much yet to be done on this subject. Many questions have 
not been answered, many even have not been asked. It will there- 
fore be useful to sum up in the following pages what is known on 
this subject and what I have been able to observe myself, and to group 
the questions systematically. 

Whales are terrestrial mammals that are modified for an exclusively 
aquatic life. The whale seeks its food in the water, but is obliged 
to breathe in the air. From these two facts springs all the very 
special biology of these creatures, as well as the characters of their 
organization. 

M}- most numerous and, I believe, most novel observations have 
had for their principal object the necessary respiratory movements of 
whales. These movements are very regularly performed and very 
characteristic for each species. The greater part of this chapter will 
be devoted to them ; the remainder will comprise a description of some 
other movements which have no bearing on respiration. 1 have 
entii-ely neglected their reproduction and manner of taking food, 
because I have had no personal experience on these matters. 

Respiratory movements. 

The respiration of land mammals is accomplished by means of in- 
spirations and expirations succeeding each other at obviously regular 
intervals; but when a land mammal plunges into the water its respira- 
tory rhythm changes. To a series of rapid inspirations and expirations 
there succeeds a very deep inspiration; then the respiration is sus- 
pended during immersion. Upon returning to the surface the diver 
makes a long expiration, succeeded by a series of rapid inspirations

Cetology, 1903, pp. 5-19.

628 THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. 

and expirations. This respiratory rhythm, which land mammals utilize 
only accidentally, forms the normal rhythm of the respiration of the 
whales, and, I may add, of all terrestrial vertebrates which are modi- 
tied for an exclusively aquatic life (for example, the leatherback turtle, 
the water snakes, etc.). 

The whale, having' returned to the surface after a long inuuersion, 
emits then a prolonged expiration, makes a short inspiration, dives a 
little, reappears to breathe, dives again, and thus many times in suc- 
cession; then he makes a long inspiration and plunges into the depths 
for a considerable time. I will now analyze successively all these 
movements. 

A. — EXPIRATION, OR " SPOUT." 

This is the only part of the act of breathing which has attracted the 
attention of the whalers, and they have given to it the special name of 
"souffle" in French, or "blow" or "spout" in English. 

1. The moment at ivldcTi the '"'' spout^'' is j^^oduced. — Expiration is 
produced exactl}^ at the moment when the summit of the head, on 
which the blowhole is placed, arrives at the surface. Therefore, in 
general, it is the protuberance of the blowhole which indicates the 
presence of the animal. It is, moreover, at this moment the most 
prominent part of the body, because whales have the faculty of pro- 
truding this part of the blowhole. (I have proved this for the whale- 
bone whales, and it is probably true of the toothed whales.) The 
movement of the protuberance of the blowhole is very rapid, and 
Buchet (1895) is the only one who has pointed this out. Whalers told 
him, indeed, that when a whale blows "the blowhole forms a very 
large protuberance," which disappears when the animal is dead. 

In BalEenoptera muscidus L. (the sulphurbottom) the median region 
of the back often appears before the protuberance of the blowhole. 
In the sperm whale that which appears first is the dorsal [hump?], 
according to the opinion of Beale (1839), who appears to have care- 
fully observed these animals. As to the porpoises and the ziphioid 
whales, it is possible that their blowhole is not extensible, but it is also 
the top of the head which appears first above water. 

.^. Duration of the spout. — The duration of the spout is variable and 
depends on the size of the whale. The large whales spout longer than 
the small ones, and the first spout after sounding is much longer than 
the intermediate spoutings. I have estimated it at five or six seconds 
for Bald&noptera muscidus L. (the sulphurbottom) and at three or four 
seconds for the humpbacks. Beale (1839) mentions six seconds for the 
sperm whale. As to the porpoises, the duration of their spout does 
not exceed two seconds. Whatever the length may be, the spout 
always lasts longer than the inspiration. I will return to this subject 
in connection with the second part of the respiratory act. 



THE SPOCTTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. 629 

3. Noise of the spout. — The noise produced by the spout is also very 
variable in intensity, in accordance with the size of the animal. 
Scarcely perceptible in DeJpMnus delphis L. (the common dolphin) 
and its allies, it becomes very loud in the small tinbacks, louder still 
in the right whales and the humpbacks, and of a force truly extraordi- 
nary in a Balxnoptera mibsculus L. (sulphurbottom) of great size. 
This sound has been compared with good reason to the noise made 
b}' steam escaping from a pipe under pressure; from a brass pipe, 
I may add, because very often the spouts of the iinl)acks possess 
remarkable sonorousness. It is not a true emission of voice, because 
whales have no vocal cords, but a simple vibration caused by the expul- 
sion of air under pressure. The effect is often produced even in man 
when the nose is for any reason obstructed by foreign substances. 
It is not rare, indeed, to observe whistling sounds which, with a due 
allowance for difference in proportions, are of the same nature as the 
more or less musical sounds produced by whales. It is in this waj^ 
that I explain the bellowings so often described as occurring among 
cetaceans. I ought, moreover, to mention that among certain por- 
poises it may be that there are special dispositions of parts which 
produce noises in a constant manner. 

Jf.. Form and appearance of the spout. — ^The form and appearance of 
the spout depend much on the force with which the air stored in the 
lungs is expelled; they depend also on the rapidity of motion of the 
animals and the state of the atmosphere. Among small whales the 
spout is invisible, or very little visible, and the whale must exceed at 
least 10 meters before its spout will be visible. 

The appearance of the spout is that of a mass of white and pearly 
vapor. When it is calm and cold and when the whale is quiet or 
moves gently, the spout rises vertically in the air in a column more or 
less slender according to the species. The right whales emit a very 
larg-e spout and the tin backs a small one. As the upper part of the 
colunm becomes enlarged the spout takes the form of a very much 
elongated cone, but before the end of the expiration the summit of 
this elongated cone spreads out, its outlines become vague, and the 
terminal part is transformed into a sort of cloud. At the end of the 
expiration the spout detaches itself from the blowhole, rises gently in 
the air, and the lower part disappears; it seems to gather itself together 
into the upper cloud, and finally the upper cloud also dissolves. This 
is noticed especially in the case of the first spout after sounding, 
which is always more forceful. 

On the other hand, in expirations during the interv^ening appear- 
ances at the surface the column formed by the spout is less high, the 
cone which it forms is much less elongated, and its duration in the air 
is much less. When the wind blows or when the animal is in rapid 



680 THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. 

motion, the column inclines backward and takes on the appearance of 
a glass tear. 

Ancient authors often hgured the spouting of different species of 
whales, but these figures are as naive as false. One sees that these 
venerable cetologists believed that the whales threw up water through 
the blowhole, because their figures reproduced conscientiously the 
appearance of jets of water and fountains gushing. Baer (1864) was 
the first to give a figure obviously exact of the spout of a finback 
and of its transformations. He has, nevertheless, drawn it too cylin- 
drical. In reality its form is distinctly conical. Henking (1901, figs. 
1 and 2) has perfectly given the appearance of the spout of a Balse- 
noptera physalus L. (common finback), and the inclination which he 
has given it is certainly due to the rapid progression of the animal. 

The highest spout is that of Balxnoptera muscidus L. (the sulphur- 
bottom), in spite of what Rawitz (1900) says, who only attributes to it 
1 meter. All the eyewitnesses agree on this subject, and 1 estimate 
further on the height of the spout of this animal at favorable times at 
15 meters (49 feet). 

The largest spout is that of Balsena mystlcetus L. (l>owhead). The 
right whales, finbacks, and humpbacks throw up vertical spouts in 
calm weather, the sperm whale spouts inclined forward at 1-35'-' (Beale, 
1839), and the large porpoises a very short spout, also inclined. 

One reads often in authors that the spout of the finbacks and the 
right whales is double, but if one goes to the sources — that is, to the 
writings of ej^e witnesses and not to those of compilers — one sees that 
nothing is in general less proved. Beale (1839) declares plainly that 
the spout of the sperm whale is simple and is distinguished on that 
account from the spout of the other whales, which is double, but this 
seems to apply only to the right whales. Thiercelin (1866, vol. 1), 
who seems to have been a conscientious author, declares expressly that 
the southern right whale throws "a double column of white vapor, 
more or less thick, which rises in the form of a V, of which one branch 
is shorter than the other." Other observations seem to confirm this. 

It is otherwise with Megaptera (humpbacks) and Balaenoptera (fin- 
backs). Baer (1864) declares that he has observed that the spout of 
Balsenoptera is simple, and that, moreover, one onl}^ sees it double in 
looking at the animal from in front. Rawitz (1900) has also seen the 
spouts of the humpbacks and of Balxnopter'a imisculus and pliysaluii 
single. Henking (190l) also figures it single in B. pliysalus. I have 
always seen it simple, although humpbacks and finbacks have spouted 
ver}^ near to me, both front view and in profile. 

It seems to me that we have to do here with an a priori idea, sug- 
gested by the fact that these whales have two openings in the blowhole. 
But as these openings are very near together, and as the diameter of the 
column formed by the spout is relatively considerable, it seems to me 



THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. 681 

difficult to believe that the spout of each oritice can preserve its indi- 
vidualit3^ It is not possible, then, to see them separately, even when 
one observes the animal from in front, the only position in which one 
can theoretical!}' distinguish this duality. 

5. Nature of the apoiit. — The greatest uncertainty has reigned for a 
long time as to the nature of the substance thrown out by the whales 
when spouting. Aristotle (Histor}' of Animals, viii, 2) declares that 
"at the same time that it (the dolphin) takes in the water and ejects 
it through its blowhole it has a lung, through which it receives the 
air and breathes." The real nature of the cetaceans was thus estab- 
lished at this early day, but at the same time also the idea that these 
animals throw out water through their blowholes. Pliny (Natural 
History) did much to cause this last belief to be adopted b}^ citing- 
some definite cases. He shows the "physeter - * * diluviem 
quandam eructans. " (Liber ix, cap. iv. ) He even mentions having seen 
a killer whale fill and swamp a boat with his spout, — "quorum unum 
(navigium) mergi vidimus, reflatu bellua' oppletum unda.'' (Liber ix, 
cap. VI.) 

Although this idea is absolutely false, it was adopted without dis- 
cussion, and only at the beginning of the nineteenth century was the 
notion abandoned, not, however, without contest and without its reap- 
pearance from time to time. Thus F. Cuvier (1838) still admitted it. 
And actually even Bruce (1896), who was the naturalist of the Balsena^ 
maintained it, and Dahl (Heuking, 1901, p. 3, note 7) is said to have 
established it very recently in the case of a cetacean which he believed 
to be a sperm whale. 

So far as I know, it was Fabricius (1780), the conscientious observer, 
who first expressly said that whales expel only air charged with 
vapor, and, following him, I will mention, among those who are 
authorities in cetology and have themselves observed cetaceans, 
Scoresby (1820), Baer (1826 and 1836), Beale (1839), Bennett (1810), 
Holboll (Eschricht, 1849), Baer (1861), Thiercelin (1866), Brierly, 
Haglund, Torrell (Lilljeborg, 1866), Scammon (1871), and all recent 
cetologists. 

The proofs that whales do not expel water through the nostrils, 
but air saturated with vapor, like all mammals without exception, are 
many and of different kinds. I will give a brief summary of them, 
taking notice of those already given by cetologists and adding those 
derived from my own observations. 

The spout has neither the form nor the appearance of a jet produced 
b}' water escaping under pressure, but very much the flocculent 
appearance of a cloud. It is seen that this cloud is blown along b}^ 
the wind, like ordinary vapor; it is seen to spread out and dissolve 
in the air and not to fall in a cascade as it would if it were water. It 
is absolutely impossil)le for a conscientious observer to doubt the 
SM 1903 11 



632 THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. 

reality of these evidences, however Httle he has witnessed whales blow- 
ing close at hand. An observation of this kind alone should suffice to 
decide the question, but I have another proof furnished by a more 
direct observation. On January 28, 1898, the Belgica was in Charlotte 
Bay (Gerlache Strait). We were surrounded by a great school of 
humpbacks, and I located myself with the photographic apparatus on 
a stage which projected about 2 meters over the gunwales of the ship. 
One of the humpbacks came up suddenl}' under the stage to spout, and 
I was entirely enveloped in the animal's expiration. Under these con- 
ditions 1 was well situated to know whether the humpbacks eject water 
or air. I can assure Dahl, Bruce, and all who persistently remain 
followers of Aristotle and Pliny that there was not the least bit of 
water in the expiration of this whale. I was struck in the face by a 
warm and humid wind of a fetid odor, to the consideration of which I 
•shall return later on. 

The anatomical structure of the larynx, of the back of the buccal 
cavity, and of the blowhole prohibits the expulsion of water. We 
know, indeed, that among all the cetaceans the extremity of the 
larynx is prolonged into a ver}" long appendage, which, penetrating 
deeply into the canal of the blowhole, completely fills the cavity. 
This arrangement is a marvelous adaptation to the necessity which 
there is for whales to swallow their prey under water. The respira- 
tory organs are thus completely separated from the digestive organs 
in the back of the buccal cavity, the food passing into the esophagus 
on each side of the larj^nx, while the water or the substanc^es with 
which it is filled are not able to penetrate into the larynx. This being 
established, it is not easy to see how the water can be expelled 
through the blowhole, which is completely closed. On the other hand, 
one asks in vain what may be the force which could project this water 
to such considerable heights as are observed in the case of some spouts. 
How is the whale able to produce the necessary pressure in its mouth? 
The conformation of this cavity does not permit, in fact, a complete 
closing of the mouth even among the toothed whales; on the con- 
trary, it is formed in such a manner as to allow the passage of water. 
The whalebone whales have in the corners of the mouth veritable 
gutters, which are especially well developed in the humpback and are 
useful to these animals in expelling the water in which their food 
floats. 

Thus, in order that the water may be thrown out through the blow- 
holes to a great height, it is necessary that it be previously' held in the 
lungs. I believe that even the most fervent partisans of Aristotle's 
ideas would recoil before such a supposition. 

But there is one case in which a liquid is thrown to a considerable 
height through the blowholes. That is when the whale is wounded in 
the lungs. In this case a jet of blood is often thrown to great height. 



THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. 633 

This phenomenon is not peculiar to wliales; it is presented b}" all ani- 
mals whose lungs are torn or for any reason filled with blood. 

Many conscientious observers, however, think they have proved 
that the spout sometimes falls in drops of water. Baer (1864) sa3's 
that Captain Kotzebue has seen a whale spout so near the ship that 
the spout spread out over the deck, which was covered with little 
drops, but these drops were never sufficiently numerous for the water 
to collect in a stream. Thiercelin (1866, t. 1) relates that from the 
spout of the rig-ht whale there fall some small drops of "oily matter" 
and a certain quantity of water. Lilljeborg (1866) cites Haglund, 
who has seen drops of water fall from the lower part of the cloud 
formed by the spout, and Torrell, who declares that a little water fell 
from a spout onto the deck of the ship, the water probably produced, 
he adds, b}^ condensation of the vapor. 

All these observations, and others which I have not cited, have been 
made in the polar regions, where the temperature of the air is ver}'^ 
low. They could therefore be explained easily by the vevy rapid 
condensation of the water contained in the spout. 

Many other explanatory hypotheses have been put forward. It is 
claimed that the animal having blown before the protuberance of the 
blowhole is completel}^ emerged, the spout draws with it a part of the 
surface water and vaporizes it. Baer (1864) does not admit this view. 
He observes, very justly, that whales do not spout until the blowhole 
is out of the water. On the other hand, the results of an experiment 
which he made appeared to him conclusive. He blew under water 
with a curved tube and proved that the water was not carried up 
except when the orifice of the tube was very close to the surface. 

It seems to me that the experiment of Baer demonstrates just the 
opposite of what he claims. He has, indeed, demonstrated experi- 
mentally that water can be drawn up under certain conditions, and one 
can hardly suppose that these conditions are never realized; on the 
contrary, it is very probable that they may be sometimes realized, 
Baer himself figures a killer which draws up some little drops of 
water with the spout. I believe, then, that such occurrences are 
possible. 

But man}" authors, and Baer among others, have proposed a differ- 
ent explanation. They also believe that the small drops of water 
which fall from the spout are from water drawn up, but derived from 
that which accumulates in tli(> depression of the blowhole. Rawitz 
(1900) combats this view at length Avith arguments based on the 
obliquity of the orifice of the blowhole, which is in the form of a slit, 
and on the inclination of the protul)erance of the blowhole. I am of 
the opinion of Rawitz, but for a reason which seems to me better than 
his, because it is unanswerable. We have seen above that the blow- 
hole of the whalebone whales is drawn out during the spout into a 



634 THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. 

couical projection, which does not present the least depression in which 
water could accumulate. 

Other authors have attributed the origin of the little drops of water 
to that which penetrates into the tube of the blowhole. I do not see 
any impossiljilit}'^ in this in principle, but would simply remark that 
the seals and penguins that I have observed close at hand never exhib- 
ited this phenomenon. I do not see why the nostrils of the cetaceans 
should be less well organized than the nostrils of these animals. I 
hardly need say that this last explanation is merely an hj^pothesis which 
is not based on direct observation. 

The belief of earlier authors that the whales spout water is certainly- 
based on defective observations and on the blind credence which was 
accorded to all the stories of Aristotle and Pliny. It seems to me 
that it is not the same as regards modern authors. 1 believe that 
with a part of these at least the influence of an a priori idea has been 
determinative. To explain the visibility of the spout of the large 
whales in the polar regions is an eas}^ matter. It is only necessary to 
show that it i^ common to all the mammals which are found in those 
regions and that the phenomenon is observed in winter even in tem- 
perate regions. The condensation of water vapor contained in a state 
of saturation in the waiiii expired air produces a "cloud" (buee) 
upon contact with the cold air. It is then natural to associate the 
spout of a whale with a normal "cloud," only that it is larger, on 
account of the size of the animal. 

This explanation will not sufiice, however, in the case of cetaceans 
whose spout is visible even in high temperatures. It is well known 
that the sperm whale is found in the tropical seas, where the tempera- 
ture of the air is often 30° C, and yet the spout of these animals, 
although less considerable than that of the large polar whales, is, 
nevertheless, perfectly visible. It is this difiiculty of explaining the 
visibility of the spout of the large whales in high atmospheric tem- 
peratures which has led some authors to affirm that the spout is liquid. 

There is also another difficult}" which presents itself when one 
attempts to go to the root of the matter. It may l^e asked why the 
spout is not visible among the smaller whales if it is a simple "cloud" 
(buee). 

Rawitz (1900) seeks the explanation of the visibilit}^ of the spout in 
tropical regions in the high temperature which the cetaceans are said 
to possess. He says on page 94: " The temperature of the blood of the 
large whalebone whales — I believe Kiikenthal or Guldberg has made 
the ol)servation — surpasses the highest fever temperature of man." 
But this reference is altogether erroneous. It was Guldberg (1900) 
who published the work to which Rawitz referred, and from this 
memoir it appears very evident that the temperature of the cetaceans 



THE SPOUTIlSra AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. 635 

is inferior to the normal temperature of man. Indeed, muscular 
or rectal temperatures liave quite indisputably given 35.4° C. for 
Bala&noptera nmscuhis Comp. (common finback), according to Guldberg, 
and 35.6" C. for Delphinus del])hh Cuvier (common dolphin), accord- 
ing to Richard and Neuville, and the temperature of the liver (the 
warmest organ of the body) 37.8° C. in Pliocsena communis (harbor 
porpoise), according to Dav}-. Guldberg states on page 69: " We 
may therefore regard a temperature of from 36° to 37° C. as the 
normal temperature of the cetaceans rather than 38° to 39° C." He 
means the temperature of the liver, which is certainly higher than 
that of the lungs and of the air which is contained in them. 

If, therefore, the temperature of the cetaceans is sensibly inferior 
to that of man, it is much lower than that of the majority of land 
mammals, which have a temperature varjang around 39° C. This 
agrees perfect!}" with what I have found for the seals and penguins 
(Racovitza, 1900, p. 206), animals in all points comparable from a 
physiological point of view. 

I would therefore place in opposition to the assertions of Rawitz 
this general law: The temperature of mammals and birds modified for 
an aquatic life, in which the bod}" is surrounded by an insulating layer 
of fat, is inferior to the temperature of their terrestrial allies. These 
aquatic animals do not produce more heat wherewith to counteract the 
cold of the medium which they inhabit, but they lose less. The fat 
which envelopes them prevents the loss of heat to such an extent that 
a seal which has been dead for twenty-four hours and exposed to a 
temperature of —20° C. has the viscera still warm (Racovitza, 1900, p. 
207), and a Bataenoptera sihbaldl (sulphurbottom) three days after 
its death gave 34° C. in the muscles and the blood (Guldberg, 1900). 

I would remark here that the fat in cetaceans, seals, and penguins 
is not reserve matter, as in terrestrial mammals, but a veritable organ 
of defense against cold, and I shall* support with proofs, in a memoir 
which I have in preparation on seals and penguins, this opinion, which 
seems a veritable paradox — that aquatic animals which have been 
almost exterminated on account of their fat are lean animals. 

The explanation given by Rawitz is, therefore, at fault, and. further- 
more, if it were true it would not explain why the spout of the small 
cetaceans is not visible, since the difference between the temperature 
of their body and the external temperature in the intertropical 
regions would be sufficient, according to his hypothesis, to produce 
condensation. 

My friend. Doctor Portier, chief of physiological investigations at 
the Sorbonne, has suggested an explanation which seems to me a 
good one. The effects of confining gases are known by w^ell-estab- 
lished physical experiments. All gases under pressure which are 
suddenly liberated undergo an instantaneous reduction of tempera- 



636 THE SPOUTING AND MOVEJtfENTS OF WHALES. 

ture, and it is certain that the phenomenon of the expiration of ceta- 
ceans can be compared from every point of view with the phenomena 
presented by gases under constraint. There is, in effect, a vast pul- 
monary reservoir inclosed in a powerful thoracic cage, comnuinicating 
w^ith the exterior by an orifice much reduced in comparison with the 
capacit}" of the lungs, and this orifice is opened suddenly at the 
moment of expiration. The proof that the air is expelled under strong 
pressure is that the spout rises to a very great height and especially 
that its emission produces a harsh sound, so characteristic that all 
authors have compared it to the escape of steam under pressure. 

This idea of Portier's seems to me to explain admirabl}^ all the 
peculiarities of the spout; thus, the spout of the small whales is not 
seen because their muscular power is feeble and the air escapes under 
a mininuun pressure. The expiration which follows the first appear- 
ance of the Avhale after sounding is more forceful than the others, 
because the animal at the moment of diving has expanded its lungs 
more strongly than for ordinary immersions and consequently the air 
is under a more considerable pressure. 

I do not wish to maintain that the refrigeration consequent upon 
the phenomenon of restraint is the sole reason of the visibility of 
the spout. It is necessary to make a distinction. In the Tropics it is 
certain that the condensation of the vapor is due solely to refrigera- 
tion caused by restraint, but in the polar regions the phenomenon of 
the buee complicates the causes of this appearance. 

6. Odor of the sjjout. — As I have already remarked in another 
place (p. 632), the odor of the spout of the humpback is nauseating, 
and confirmation of this observation will be found in Baer (1864), 
Lilljeborg (1866), Jouan (1882), and other authors whom it is unneces- 
sary to cite here. Jouan (1882, p. 12) remarks, indeed, that this is 
observed especially among the large species of cetaceans, and that the 
spout of the sperm whale is particularly fetid, as it provokes nausea 
and " produces the effect of a blister on the skin." I leave to this 
author the entire responsibility of this last assertion, and would recall 
simply that the fetidness of the spout is habitual in the large whales 
and is not peculiar to the humpbacks. 

I have attributed this bad odor somewhat rashly to the bodies of 
the animals which have decomposed in the whalebone of the baleen 
whales, a fact often observed. Fishes found in the mouth of Balae- 
noptera 2?hysalus (common finback) in process of decomposition have 
been cited, but in addition to the fact that this hypothesis can not be 
applied to the sperm whale, which is without whalebone, it is also 
incompatible with the arrangement of the respiratory canal, which is 
completely isolated from the cavity of the mouth. It is necessar}', 
therefore, to look for the source of infection in the respiratory appa- 
ratus itself. 



THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. 637 

B. — INSPIRATION. 

Inspiration is effected immediately after expiration, without an 
interval. The protuberance of the blowhole is alwa3's the only part 
which appears at the moment on the surface, but its form is now quite 
dijBFerent. The orifice in the whalebone whales, instead of being- situ- 
ated on the conical eminence as it is during expiration, is now wide 
open and the protuberance of the blowhole is so much flattened as to 
be confounded with the regular contours of the head. This disposi- 
tion is very clearly shown in the photographs [not here reproduced]. 
In the toothed whales the modification is less, but the orifice of the 
blowhole must be wider open than during expiration. 

The duration of the inspiration is always less than that of expira- 
tion, which can be readil}' understood. During expiration the orifice 
of the blowhole is small, and the air, though projected, it is true, with 
violence, is expelled in a column of small diameter.' During the 
inspiration, on the contrary, the orifice is wide open that the air may 
be taken in suddenh\ The whale has probably acquired this faculty 
of very rapid inspiration in order that it may be exposed for a less 
time to the penetration of water into the respiratory apparatus. 

I have been able frequentl}" to confirm this extreme rapidity of 
inspiration in the finbacks, the humpbacks, and the porpoises, and 
many accurate writers have noted it as well as mj^self. Thiercelin 
(1866, vol. 1) states that among all the cetaceans "the expiration is 
very much longer than the inspiration," and again, " but in all cases, 
as soon as this operation has ceased, the blowhole appears to sink so 
much that it is necessary to know that the animal needed to inspire in 
order not to suppose that it confined itself to the first phase of its 
function [of breathing]." Henking (1901) has observed among the 
sulphurbottoms {B. musculu.s) that '"the inspiration plainly follows 
[the expiration] with extraordinary rapidity, and the sounding of the 
whale occurs veiy quickly after the projection of the spout." Beale 
(1839) says that immediatel}" after the sperm whale has blown the 
inspiration takes place ver}' quickh% because the snout descends. 
Kiikenthal (1903) also maintains from theoretical considerations, on 
which I do not wish to insist, that the inspiration must be veiy short. 

But Rawitz (1900, a) compels us to give attention anew to his 
statements. He asserts that the inspiration is longer than the expira- 
tion and deeper. On wdiat does this author rely as the basis for this 
statement? It can only be his own observations, but one can con- 
vince oneself as regards their accuracy by running over the lines I 
have devoted to the humpback. .And what is the meaning of an 
inspiration deeper than an expiration? Does liawitz imagine that, 
everything considered, the whale introduces a larger volume of air 
into its lungs than it rejects? He denies also the enlargement of the 



638 THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. 

orifice of the blowhole during inspiration, a negation more unfortu- 
nate as the fact is undeniable, and he accompanies this opinion with 
an argument which can not be admitted. He says, in effect, that this 
enlargement of the blowhole can not serve to accelerate the inspira- 
tion in any considerable degree since the nostrils remain always very 
narrow compared with the quantity of air inspired. Thus, according 
to Eawitz, the difference between the volume of air which can be 
taken in by a narrow orifice and that taken in by an orifice ten times 
as wide is inconsiderable! I leave to him the responsibility for such 
a conclusion. 

The entrance of the air into the lungs of the large cetaceans as well 
as the expirations produces a certain sound, which is not a "voice," 
but simply a sound produced by the strongly inspired air passing- 
through the relatively narrow orifice. Sometimes, how^ever, the noise 
is more harj^h, resembling a dull w^histle, and with proper allowance it 
resembles that produced sometimes in the nasal canals of terrestrial 
animals which are clogged with mucus or any foreign matter. 

It is unnecessary to say that the cetaceans breathe air alone, and 
that they are as much inconvenienced as any land animals when the 
water penetrates into their respiratory organs. 

C. — THE INTERMEDIATE IMMERSIONS. 

When a cetacean has respired, as seen above, it dives, executing a 
rotating movement indicated by the curvature of the body more or 
less extended, and thereupon continues to advance under water. There 
is seen, then, at the surface after respiration, which has been indicated 
b}^ the presence of the protuberance of the blowhole, the slight con- 
cavity which marks the rudimentary neck in these animals, then the 
back always convex for a distance approaching the posterior extremity 
more or less, according to the species. Thus the right whales show a 
large part of the back, extending posteriorly beyond the point where 
the dorsal fin is located in those cetaceans which possess this part. In 
the humpback the back is also shown to a point behind the dorsal fin. 
In the finback the dorsal fin is not shown, but the sperm whale shows 
its dorsal hump and the porpoises their dorsal fins. 

The inmiersion of the animal proceeds from in front backward, 
always in a curved line, and the cetacean disappears without having 
shown its tail in any case. 

The period of disappearance is longer or shorter, according to the 
species, but never exceeds a few minutes. Then the protuberance of 
the blowhole reappears, the whale respires, shows its back, and disap- 
pears again. The number of these intermediate immersions before 
sounding varies according to the species. In general, the whalebone 
whales execute >)nt few, the toothed whales very many. In all ceta- 
ceans, however, they are characterized b}' the following: (1) The

expiration and inspiration, respective!}', are shorter than the first expi- 
ration after sounding and the last inspiration before sounding, and 
these respiratory acts are less deep; (2) the interval between reappear- 
ances is very short; (3) the animal dives only to a slight depth, a few 
meters at most, and generally it keeps immediately below the surface; 
(4) the posterior part of the body is always invisible; (o) the whale 
during the time it remains under water progresses quite rapidly, 
usually in a straight line, but sometimes in a circle when in a narrow 
bay where space is limited. 

The ol>ject of these movements is easy to understand. The cetacean 
does what all diving animals do. Before plunging, for a very long 
time, it makes many rapid respirations, which permit it to reoxygenate 
its blood, which has become more or less carbonated since the last 
sounding; it also permits the animal to surcharge its blood with oxy- 
gen for the succeeding immersion. It follo^vs that the cetaceans which 
make the greatest number of ordinary- inspirations before sounding 
are those which should be able to dive deepest, or at least those which 
should be able to remain longest under water. In this regard it is the 
sperm whale which appears to hold the record, for its divings inter- 
mediate between soundings are very numerous^ — 60 or TO, says Beale 
(1839) — and it is also the whale which remains submerged longest, an 
hour and ten minutes to an hour and twenty minutes, or rarelj^ an hour 
in the case of large males. The long submersion should be very 
important for this whale to enable it to procure its food, which con- 
sists of large cuttle-fish, animals living at a great depth, the pursuit of 
which must be long and arduous. 

The habits of the bottle-nosed whales {Ilypei^oodon) are similar to 
those of the sperm whale, and the number of immersions intermediate 
between two soundings is very large among them also, as will be seen 
later. 

D. — SOUNDING. 

When the animal has its store of oxygen, it makes a very deep 
inspiration in order to carry with it as large a quantity of air as 
possible. In this also, the cetaceans are not exceptional, but follow 
the course of all diving animals. The back of the whale is shown 
immediatel}^, much higher above the surface than in intermediate 
immersions. The curve formed by the dorsal line is very convex, the 
rotating movement more pronounced, and the back disappears from 
the anterior part to the posterior part. What follows is character- 
istic for each species. The right whales, the humpbacks, and the 
sperm whales show their flukes above water; at this time the head 
is directed downward and the axis of the bod}' obliquely. The flukes 
are waved in the air two or three times and the animal disapj)ears. 
The finbacks do not show their flukes, but describe a strong- curve 



640 THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES, 

approaching a circle. The porpoises jump out of the water and 
describe an elongated curve in the air, descending head foremost, with 
the body extended. 

The whale dives at once obliquely and disappears for a time longer 
or shorter, according to the species, but rarely for less than a quarter 
of an hour. It reappears and spouts very powerfully and long. 

The sounding is characterized, then, among all cetaceans by the fol- 
lowing peculiarities (1) It commences with an inspiration deeper than 
any other, and ends with an expiration which is also very strong; (2) 
the posterior part of the body executes special movements; (3) the 
whale dives to a great depth; (4) it remains there very long before it 
appears again. 

E. — THE TRACK. 

Every time a large whale disappears below the surface, it leaves 
behind it a slick (grasseur), which is especially plain when the water 
is but little agitated. This ""slick" is unquestionably an extremely 
thin layer of oil, which spreads on the surface of the water and gives 
it the well-known mirror-like appearance. This fact has been observed 
and recorded many times already, and there can be no doubt as to its 
interpretation. 

It is difficult, however, to understand the origin of this oily sub- 
stance which the whale leaves behind, for anatomists who have studied 
the skin of the cetaceans (Delage, 1885; Kiikenthal, 1889; Rawitz, 
1899, among others) have proved the complete absence of sweat 
glands or sebaceous glands. The oil can not, then, be derived from 
secretions of the skin. Inthe common dolphin, a species which I have 
examined in this particular, the skin is entirely without a trace of oil; 
it is perfectly dry and does not leave any mark on a well-cleaned glass. 
It follows, therefore, that this oil must have some other origin. The 
following observations may, perhaps, put us on the track of the truth. 
Thiercelin (1866, vol. l)says regarding the southern right whale: "Some 
little drops of oily matter drop from the spout." If this observation is 
verified — for it can not be admitted without hesitation — it gives us 
the source of the "slick" mentioned; but another observation which 
I made in Gerlache Strait appears to me to supply a more plausible 
explanation. I noticed at the surface of the water, among the fin- 
backs and humpbacks of the strait, some irregular masses of a red 
color surrounded by "slicks." They were without doubt the excre- 
ments of these animals. The seals and penguins had similar excre- 
ments, the color of which is explained by the fact that tlie food of 
these animals consists of JEuphausia (a small thysanopod crustacean), 
which is abundantly provided with red pigment. The Eu/phausia, like 
all planctonic animals, possesses lumierous small globules of oil in its 
tissues, which must serve as floats in animals which pass their lives in 



THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. 641 

the water. This lieing so, the waste products of digestion of the 
mammals and birds which feed upon them must contain oil. It is 
therefore possible that the large whales excrete small quantities of 
oilj matter, which may be the origin of the "slicks" observed. 

Various movements executed by cetaceans. 

The movements thus far analyzed are the habitual movements, and, 
so to speak, permanent in the normal life of the whales, but there are 
others which these animals execute under certain conditions which are 
special, or exceptional in their lives, and which we must now anah^ze. 

^1. Leaps and gambols. — These movements are observed among 
many cetaceans, but especially among certain species, in connection 
with which the}^ constitute a genuine specific character. The hump- 
back is especially prone to leaping out of water, which will be described 
in detail in a subsequent chapter. The finbacks do not appear to 
indulge in these gambols, but they enter into the habits of the sperm 
whale (Beale, 1839). American and English whalers have coined a 
word to designate the action of leaping out of water among large 
whales. They call it "breaching." The small porpoises spring out 
of water and are known to follow vessels under wa}^ and to outstrip 
them in speed. Large finbacks are also mentioned which have fol- 
lowed boats for a very long time (Rodler, 1888). 

B. Resting on the surface. — Right whales and humpbacks have the 
habit of remaining motionless at the surface of the water. The 
whalers pretend that it is for the purpose of sleeping, but this asser- 
tion needs to be confirmed. 

It appears from the published observations that this resting on the 
water is but rarely observed. I only saw it once during three seasons 
which 1 passed in Gerlacho Strait, when our vessel was constantly 
surrounded b}- humpbacks. It has never been observed with certainty 
among the finbacks or porpoises. This seems to me to indicate that it 
can not be interpreted as a function so normal and periodic as sleep. 

But it properl}^ may be asked whether whales sleep at all. I am 
inclined to answer this question negatively. During our sojourn in 
Gerlache Strait and among the icebergs we heard the whales blow at 
all hours of day and night, confirming Jouan's observation of 1882. 
I often observed porpoises following the boats at night, while on the 
other hand, Ddpli'mus delphis L. (common dolphin) caused havoc in 
the fishing apparatus used for taking anchovies and sardines at all 
times and at all hours of the day and night. 

Rodler (1888, p. 274) reports that a steamer was followed l)v the 
same school of cetaceans from Cape Horn to Liverpool, and Moseley 
(1892, p. 9) declares that a humpback {Megaptera) followed the Chal- 
lenger many days. During these vo3'ages the whales must liave swum 



642 THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. 

actively, which excludes the possibility of sleep, even if we admit 
that the necessaiy movements of respiration could be automically per- 
formed, as Jouan supposes (1882), for it is not possible to maintain 
that the whales could follow automaticall}^ a ship the course of w'hich 
is variable. 

It is possible to form three hypotheses regarding the sleep of 
whales. One can suppose, first, that the}^ sleep at the bottom of the 
sea. Buchet (189.5) is of this opinion, and believes what the fishermen 
told him on this subject, for he says: "They [the whales] often emerged 
suddenly- all around the ship without having been seen at a distance." 
This applies to the heavy whales and the porpoises which would sleep 
at night. The fact which Buchet reports as a proof of the correctness 
of his opinion is explained in quite another manner. It is not a mat- 
ter for astonishment to see animals suddenly appear, which swim as 
much as 12' miles an hour (Scoresby, 1820) and can remain under water 
more than half an hour. 

The opinion of Buchet can not be accepted for many reasons. Ceta- 
ceans could sleep but poorly at the bottom of the sea, since they are 
obliged to ascend to breathe. When they inhabit deep seas they could 
not sleep, for the cetaceans do not dive to a great depth. Their skin 
is so delicate that the contact with the bottom would be injurious to 
them. I do not believe, therefore, that this first hypothesis can be 
maintained. 

1 will note here merely for reference a curious work of Barkow 
(1802) which is connected with the h3'pothesis which I am about to 
examine and which contains the following conclusions: "The summer 
life of the whalebone whales is preeminently^ the life of the mammals 
depending on atmospheric lungs; their winter life preeminently a sub- 
marine life, depending on the abdominal vessels (Darmgefassleben)." 
This author therefore considers the cetaceans as hibernating animals, 
which pass a part of their existence at the bottom of the sea. He 
reaches this strange deduction as a result of erroneous conclusions, 
regarding which I will not enter into details here. 

The second hj^pothesis that can be put forward is also improbable, 
namel}", that the cetaceans sleep at the surface. It is well known, 
indeed, that the cetaceans, which are heavier than the water, could not 
maintain themselves at the surface except by swimming. The genus 
Balsena makes the single exception — the right whales float, but the}^ 
float on the back (which is ver}^ much heavier than the belly) if the}" do 
not maintain themselves actively in the natural position. This brings 
matters to the same point as in the case of the heavy cetaceans — in the 
one instance as in the other the blowhole would be below the surface. 

The third hypothesis is much more plausibk. In sleeping whales 
execute automatically the movements necessary to respiration. It is 
well known that horses in harness can sleep perfectly well while pull- 



THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. (>48 

ing a wagon, and that even a man can sleep while marching. Tiiere is 
nothing, therefore, which, a priori, could prevent our accepting this 
hypothesis, but we have seen that the observations cited at the begin- 
ning of this paragraph tend rather to cause us to hold that the 
cetaceans do not sleep at all. If I dwell on this subject, it is merely 
to show its interest and the small amount of data we possess for the 
solution of the problem. 

C. MigrationH. — Cetaceans have often been seen in the open sea, 
traveling straight ahead, without sounding; in these cases they are 
following a course in search of a new feeding place, or perhaps for 
the needs of reproduction. 

CONCLUSIONS RELATIVE TO MOVEMENTS. 

From this brief inquiry relative to the movements of cetaceans, it 
results that these movements vary according to the species. It is this 
point which seems to me especiall}^ important from a practical point 
of view, and in the chapters which follow I shall demonstrate, with 
suitable proofs, that it is certainly so, for the species I have been able 
to study. I la}^ down the principle, therefore, that the movements of 
cetaceans in the water are specific. In combining the results derived 
from observation of movements, with data supplied b}" dimensions, 
form, and color, one becomes able to recognize readily ever}' kind of 
whale with as much certainty as if one had the animal at one's disposal 
to dissect — an opportunity which presents itself but rarely. 

THE DEPTH TO WHICH CETACEANS DIVE. 

I will pass in closing this chapter to the consideration of a funda- 
mental question in the biology of the Cetacea — the depth to which 
they dive. There arc no direct observations for the solution of this 
problem and those cetologists who mention it incidentall\^ content 
themselves with assertions without proofs. All give very high fig- 
ures, and Kiikenthal (1900, p. 197) pretends even that cetaceans can 
dive more than 1,000 meters (3,281 feet), but without mentioning on' 
what he bases this assertion. I do not believe that this depth can ever 
be attained by these animals; on the contrary, I believe that the}' can 
not exceed a maximum depth of 100 meters (328 feet). Let us examine 
into what takes place when a cetacean dives. 

First. — The pressure of the water: It is necessary not to forget that 
the cetaceans have an aerial respiration —that their pulmonary cavities 
are filled with air. On tiie other hand, we know what takes place when 
a mammal is submitted to a pressure of several atmospheres; the gases 
dissolve in large quantities in the blood, and when the pressure is 
relieved suddenly the surplus of dissolved gas can not be eliminated 
by the lungs; the gaseous bubbles form in the capillaries, which 
arrest the circulation of the blood and cause death. For man, the 



644 THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. 

limit of depth to which he can venture without danger is 30 meters 
(98 feet) — that is to say, the pressure of three atmospheres. No mam- 
mal confined under nine atmospheres and suddenly released has sur- 
vived this treatment; therefore, 90 meters (295 feet) is a limit which 
no terrestrial mammal can reach. It may be admitted, however, that 
the whale is accustomed little by little to depths more and more con- 
siderable, and in his case to increase the depth he can reach, but it is 
not possible to believe that he can annihilate entirely the ph3\sical law 
of solution of gases in liquids proportional to pressure, nor that he 
can prevent the disengagement of these gases when the pressure ceases. 
Therefore, in giving to the cetaceans, in view of this supposed adapta- 
tion, a power three times as great as that of the human organism, we 
must be close to the truth, I believe, indeed, that this limit of 100 
meters which I have assigned to the cetaceans is rather exaggerated. 

Second. — The weight: The density of the body of the cetaceans is 
less than that of the sea water in the right whale and the sperm 
whale; it is a very little superior in the other cetaceans, which sink 
when killed. To go down, therefore, it is necessary that the whale 
should swim to the bottom. Furthermore, the living cetacean carries 
an enormous quantity of air in its lungs, which tends to make it rise 
to the surface. 

That being so, one can imagine the effort required of a cetacean to 
plunge to 1,000 meters. It is an effort so enormous that it certainly 
surpasses the animal's muscular power. One should not forget that a 
man, whose body is much denser than that of a whale, has to load 
himself with a very considerable weight when he wishes to dive into 
the sea to depths which exceed a few meters. . I recall that the cos- 
tume of a diver weighs 80 kilograms. This is another consideration 
which prevents me from believing in the 1,000 meters of Kiikenthal. 

Third. — LigJit: We know that the light of day does not penetrate 
deeper than 300 meters (984 feet) and that, furthermore, at this depth 
only the chemical rays of the spectrum make their effect felt. One 
may say, indeed, that practically, for the ej^e of a mammal, the illumi- 
nated zone does not pass 50 or 60 meters. If sight is unnecessary to 
the cetaceans which feed upon the plancton, it must, on the contrary, 
be indispensable to those which feed on fish and cephalopod mollusks. 
What would the}^ do, then, in the depths l)eyond the limit of illumi- 
nation that can be utilized ? 

Fourtli. — Food: Whales do not dive for pleasure, they dive in search 
of food. But what could they find at 1,000 meters i' The fishes on the 
banks scarcely inhabit great depths, and the zone where the plancton 
is very abundant — that in which the crustaceans live which serve as 
food is the zone of the diatoms, that is, the illuminated zone — extends 
to about loo meters. That there is plancton below this zone is not 



THE SPOUTING AND MOVEMENTS OF WHALES. (U5 

doubtful, but wh}' should the cetacean dive down there if it finds what 
it needs with less exertion? 

Fiftli. — The fishing ground: The cetaceans seek in general the 
proximity of the coasts, and very often they are seen preferably in 
places of little depth. In these places they execute their movements 
as usual ; they remain under water as long as when in the open sea, 
and if they remain there so long it is not in order to have time to 
reach great depths, as has been said, but simply because they require 
this time to procure food. 

These, then, are the considerations which cause me to reject entirely 
the ideas of those who believe that the cetaceans can dive to great 
depths. I believe, on the contrary, that the cetaceans dive some 
dozens of meters, and 100 meters seems to me a limit which can hardly 
be exceeded. 

The onl}' direct observation that I have been able to find w^iich is 
worthy of confidence confirms this opinion. The Japanese take whales 
in nets, and in a book on the whale fishery, dating from 1829 (Mobius, 
1893), I find the following passage: '"Whales which dive deeper than 
18 hiro (27.1 meters) can not be taken in nets except where the bot- 
tom does not exceed this depth, but as the Semikoiijira {Balsena 
japonica, right whale of Japan) does not dive below this depth it can 
be captured in nets at all depths." 

We see, then, that the right whale does not dive below 28 meters. 
The right whale is the one whose density is the least, so that when dead 
it floats; the others dive below 28 meters, but does anyone suppose 
that the difference can be so great between animals so closeh^ related, 
having the same habits and the same structure, as to permit that one 
can not exceed 28 meters while the other can exceed 1,000 meters? 



PROBLEMS ARISING FROM VARIATIONS IN THP: DEVEL-

By Prof. Johnson Symington, M. ])., F. R. S., F. R. S. K. 



It is now nearly twenty 3'ears sinee anthroj^olooy attained to the 
dignity of being- awarded a special and independent section in this 
association, and I believe it is generally admitted that during this 
period the valuable nature of many of the contributions, the vigor of 
the discussions, and the large attendance of njembers have amply 
justified the establishment and continued existence of this section. 

While the midtifarious and diverse nature of the subjects which are 
grouped under the term anthropology gives a variety and a breadth 
to our proceedings which are very refreshing in this age of minute 
specialism, I feel that it adds very considerably to the difficult}^ of 
selecting a subject for a presidential address which will prove of gen- 
eral interest. 

A survey of the recent advances in our knowledge of the many 
important questions which come within the scope of this section would 
cover too wide a lield for the time at nn' disposal, while a critical 
examination of the various problems that still await solution might 
expose me to the temptation of pronouncing opinions on subjects 
regarding which I could not speak with any real knowledge or experi- 
ence. To avoid such risks I have decided to limit my remarks to a 
subject which comes within the range of my own special studies, and 
to invite your attention to a consideration of some pro))Iems arising 
from the variations in the development of the skull and the brain. 

Since the institution of this section the development, growth, and 
racial peculiarities of both skull and brain, and the relation of these 
two organs to each other, have attracted an ever-increasing amount of 
attention. The introduction of new and improved methods for the 
study of the structure of the ])rain and the activity of an aide ))and of 
experimentalists have revolutionized our knowledge of the anatomv 
and phj^siolog}' of the higher nerve centers. 

The value of the results thus obtained is greatly enhanced by the 
consciousness that they bear the promise of still greater advances in

the near future. If the results obtained b}^ the craniologist have been 
less marked, this arises mainly from the nature of the sul)ject, and is 
certainly not due to any lack of energy on their part. Our cranio- 
logical collections are continually increasing, and the various prehis- 
toric skullcaps from the Neanderthal to the Trinil still form the basis 
of interesting and valuable memoirs. 

While the additions to our general knowledge of cerebral anatomy 
and physiology have been so striking, those' aspects of these subjects 
which are of special anthropological interest have made comparatively 
slight progress and can not compare in extent and importance with the 
advantages based upon a study of fossil and recent crania. These facts 
admit of a ready explanation. Brains of anthropological interest are 
usually difficult to procure and to keep, and require the use of special 
and complicated methods for their satisfactory examination, while 
skulls of the leading races of mankind are readil}' collected, preserved, 
and studied. Hence it follows that the crania in our anthropological 
collections are as numerous, well preserved, and varied as the l)rains 
are few in mmiber and defective, both in their state of preservation 
atid representative character. It may reasonably be anticipated that 
improved methods of preservation and the growing recognition on the 
part of anthropologists, museum curators, and collectors of the impor- 
tance of a study of the brain itself will, to some extent at least, remedy 
these defects; })ut so far as prehistoric man is concerned we can never 
hope to have any direct evidence of the condition of his higher nerve 
centers, and must depend for an estimate of his cerebral development 
upon those more or less perfect skulls which foi-tunately have resisted 
for so many ages the corroding hand of time. 

I presume we will all admit that the main \alue of a good collec- 
tion of human skulls depends upon the light which they can be made 
to throw upon the relative development of the brains of different races. 
Such collections possess few if any brains taken from these or corre- 
sponding skulls, and we are thus dependent upon the study of the 
skulls alone for an estimate of brain development. 

Vigorous attacks have not unf requentl}^ been made upon the crauio- 
metric systems at present in general use, and the elaborate tables, 
compiled with so much trouble, giving the circumference, diameters, 
and corresponding indexes of various parts of the skull, are held to 
atiord l)ut little information as to the real nature of skull variations, 
however useful they may be for purposes of classification. AVhile by 
no means prepared to express entire agreement with these critics, I 
nnist admit that craniologists as a whole have concentrated their atten- 
tion mainly on the external contour of the skull, and have paid com- 
paratively little attention to the form of the cranial cavity. The outer 
surface of the cranium presents features which are due to other factors 
than l)rain development, and an examination of the cranial cavity not

only gives us important information as to brain form, but l)j affording 
a comparison between the external and internal surfaces of the cranial 
wall it gives a valuable clew to the real significance of the external 
configuration. Beyond determining its capacit^^ we can do but little 
toward an exact investigation of the cranial cavity without making a 
section of the skull. Forty 3'ears ago Professor Huxley, in his work 
On the Evidence of Man's Place in Nature, showed the importance of 
a comparison of the basal with the vaulted portion of the skull, and 
maintained that until it should become "an opprobrium to an ethno- 
logical collection to possess a single skull which is not \bisected longi- 
tudinally' there would be "no safe basis for that ethnological 
craniology' which aspires to give the anatomical characters of the 
crania of the diti'erent races of mankind." Professor Cleland and Sir 
William Turner have also insisted upon this method of examination, 
and only two ^a^ars ago Prof. D. J. Cunningham, in his pi'esidential 
address to this section, quoted with approval the forcible language of 
Huxley. The curators of craniological collections appear, however, to 
possess an invincible objection to any such treatment of the specimens 
under their care. Even in the Hunterian Museum in London, where 
Huxlev himself Avorked at this subject, among several thousands of 
skulls, scarcely an}' have been bisected longitudinally or had the 
cranial cavit}^ exposed by a section in any other direction. The 
method advocated so stronglv by Huxley is not onl}' essential to a 
thorough study of the relations of basi-cranial axis to the \'ault of the 
cranium and to the facial portion of the skull, but also permits of 
casts being taken of the cranial cavity, a procedure which, I would 
venture to suggest, has been too much neglected by craniologists. 

Every student of anatomy is familiar with the finger-like depressions 
on the inner surface of the cranial wall, which are described as the 
impress of the cerebral convolutions; but their exact distril)ution and 
the degree to which they are developed according to age, sex, race, 
etc., still remain to be definitel}" determined. Indeed, there appears 
to be a considerable difference of opinion as to the degree of approxi- 
mation of the outer surface of the brain to the inner surface of the 
cranial wall. Thus the brain is frequently described as lying upon a 
water bed, or as swimming in the cerebro-spinal fluid, while Hyrtle 
speaks of this fluid as a "ligamentum suspensorium"'' for the brain. 
Such descriptions are misleading when applied to the relation of the 
cerebral convolutions to the skull. There arc, it is true, certain parts 
of the l)rain which are surrounded and separated from the skidl by a 
considerable amount of fluid. These, however, are mainly the lower 
portions, such as the medu la oblongata and pons Varolii, which may 
be regarded as prolongatiorrs of the spinal cord into the cranial cavity. 
As they contain the centers controlling the action of the circulatory 
and respiratory organs, thej are the most vital parts of the central

nervous system, and hence need special protection. They are not, 
however, concerned with the .regulation of complicated voluntary 
movements, the reception and storage of sensory impressions from 
lower centers, and the activity of the various mental processes. These 
functions we must associate with the higher parts of the brain, and 
especially with the convohitions of the cerel)ral hemispheres. 

If a cast he taken of the cranial cavity and compared with the brain 
wdiich had previously been carefully hardened in situ l)ef()re removal, 
it will be found that the cast not only corresponds in its general form 
to that of the brain, but shows a considerable number of the cerebral 
fissures and <'onvolutions. This molding of the inner surface of the 
skull to the adjacent portions of the c(;rebral hemispheres is usually 
nmeh more marked at the base and sides than over the vault. Since 
the spcM'itic gravity of the l)rain tissue is higher than that of the 
cerebro-spinal Huid, the cerel)rum tends to siidv toward the base and 
the fluid to accunndate over the \ault: hence probably these diti'er- 
ences admit of a simple mechanical (wplanation. Except luider abnor- 
mal conditions. th«> amount ot" cerebro-sijlnal fluid between the skull 
and the cerebral convolutions is so small that from a cast of the cranial 
cavity we can obtain not only a good })icture of the general shape 
and size of the higher parts of th(^ br:iin, l)ut also various details as 
to the convolutionary pattern. This method has been applied with 
marked success to the determination of the characters of the lirain 
in various fossil lemurs by Dr. Forsyth Major and Prof. R. Burck- 
hardt, and Prof, (xustav Schwalbe has made a large series of such 
casts from his craniological collection in Strassburg. The interesting 
observations b}^ Schwalbe" on the arrangement of the " impressiones

question has engaged the attention of experts as well as the ""man in 
the street" since the time of Gall and Spurzheim, and one might 
naturally suppose that the last word had been said on the subject. 
This, however, is far from being* the case. All anatomists are agreed 
that the essential function of the cranium is to form a box for the su} - 
port and protection of the brain, and it is generally conceded tluu 
during- the processes of development and growth the form of th(> 
cranium is moditied in response to the stimulus transmitted to it by 
the brain. In fact, it is brain growth that determines the form of the 
cranium, and not the skull that molds the brain into shape. This 
belief, however, need not be accepted without some reservations. 
Even the brain may be conceived as being influenced by its inmiediate 
environment. There are probably periods of development when the 
form of the brain is moditied b}^ the resistance offered by its cover- 
ings, and there are certainly stages when the brain does not full}^ 
occupy the cranial cavity. 

At an early })eriod in the phylogeny of the vertebrate skull the 
structure of the greater part of the cranial wall chang'es from mem- 
branous tissu(» into cartilage, tho portion persisting as membrane 
being situated near the median dorsal line. In the higher vertebrates 
the rapid and early expansion of the dorsal part of the forebrain is so 
marked that tiie cartilaginous growth fails to keep pace with it, and 
more and more of the dorsal wall of tlu^ ci"aniuni remains membranous, 
and subseciuently ossifies to form membrane bones. C^artilage, tiiough 
constituting a firmer support to the brain than membrane, does not 
possess the same capacity of rapid growth and expansion. The head 
of a 3'oung child is relatively large, and its skull is distinguished from 
that of an adult by the small size of the cartilaginous base of the 
cranium as compared with the membranous vault. The appearance of 
topheaviness in the young skull is gradually obliterated as age advances 
by the cartilage continuing slowly to grow after the vault has practi- 
call}" ceased to enlarge. These changes in the shape of the cranium 
are associated with corresponding alterations in that of the brain, and 
it appears to me that we have here an illustration of how the conditions 
of skull gi-owth may modify the general form of the brain. 

Whatever may be the precise infiu(mces that determine skull and 
brain growth, there can I)e no dou))t but that within certain limits the 
external form of the cranium serves as a reliable guide to the shape of 
the brain. Statements such as those \)y Dr. J. Deniker," "that the 
inequalities of the external table of the cranial walls have no relation 
whatever with the irregularitiivs of the inner table, and still less have 
anything in common with the configuration of the various parts of the 
brain," are of too general and sweeping a character. Indeed, various 
observers have drawn attention to the fact that in certain regions the

652 THE DEVELOPMENT OF SKULL AND BRAINS. 

outer .surface of the skull possesses elevations and depressions which 
closely correspond to definite tissures and convolutions of the brain. 
Many years ag'o Sir William Turner, who was a pioneer in cranio- 
cere})ral topoo-raphy, found that the prominence on the outer surface 
of the parietal bone, known to anatomists as the parietal eminence, 
was situated directly superficial to a convolution of the parietal lobe 
of the brain, which he consequently very appropriately named "the 
convolution of the' parietal eminence." Quite recently Prof. G. 
Schwalbe has shown that the position of the third or inferior frontal 
convolution is indicated by a prominence on the surface of the cra- 
nium in the anterior part of the temple. This area of the brain is of 
special interest to all students of cerebral anatomy and physiolog-y, 
since it was the discovery by the illustrious French anthropoloo-ist 
and physician, M. Broca, that the left inferior frontal convolution 
was the center for speech, that laid the scientific foundation of our 
present knowledge of localization of fimction in the cerebral cortex. 
This convolution is well known to l)e much more hio-hly develo]3ed 
in man than in the anthropoid apes, and the presence of a human 
cranial speech l)ump is usually easily d(>monstrated. The faculty of 
speech, however, is such a complicatcnl cei'cbral function that 1 would 
warn the "new'' phrenologist to be cautious in estimating the loquac- 
ity of his friends l)v the degree of prominence of this part of the 
skull, more particularly as there are other and more reliable methods 
of observation by which he can estimate this capacity. 

In addition to the prominences on the outer surface of the cranium, 
corresponding to the convolutions of the parietal eminence and the 
left inferior frontal convolution, the majority of skulls possess a shal- 
low groove marking the position of the Sylvian point and the course 
of the horizontal limb of the Sylvian fissure. Below these two other 
shallow oblique grooves indicate the line of the cerebral fissures which 
divide the outer surface of the temporal lobe into its three c()n\'olu- 
tions, termed "superior," "middle," and "inferior.'' Most of these 
cranial surface markings are partially obscured in the living body by 
the temporal muscle, but they arc of interest as showing that in 
certain places there is a close correspondence in form between 
the external surface of the brain and that of the skull. There are, 
however, distinct limitations in the degree to which the various cere- 
bral fissures and convolutions impress the inner surface of the cranial 
wall, or are represented by inequalities on its outer aspect. Thus 
over the vault of the cranium the position of the fissure of Rolando 
and the shape of the cerebral convolutions in the so-called motor area, 
which lie in relation to this fissure, can not usually be detected from 
a cast of the cranial .cavity, and are not indicated by depressions or 
elevations on the surface of the skull, so that surgeons in planning the 
seats of operations necessary to expose the various motor centers have

from points fr('([uently remote from these centers. 

The cranium is not merely a box developed for the support and pro- 
tection of the brain, and more or less accurately molded in conformit\' 
with the o-rowth of this organ. Its antero-lateral portions atford 
attachments to the muscles of mastication and support the jaws and 
teeth, while its posterior part is liable to vary according to the degree 
of development of the muscles of the nape of the neck. Next to the 
brain the most important factor in determining cranial form is the con- 
dition of the organs of mastication — muscles, jaws, and teeth. There 
is strong evidence in favor of the view that the evolution of man from 
microcephah" to macrocephal}- has been associated with the passage 
from a macrodontic to a microdontic condition. The moditications in 
the form of the cranium due to the influence of the organs of mastica- 
tion have been exerted almost entirely upon its external table; hence 
external measurements of the cranium, as guides to the shape of the 
cranial cavit}^ and indications of brain development, while fairly reli- 
able in the higher races, become less and less so as we examine the 
skulls of the lower races, of prehistoric man, and of the anthropoid 
apes. 

One of the most important measurements of the cranium is that 
which determines the relation between its length and breadth and thus 
divides skulls into long or short, together with an intermediate group 
neither distinctly dolichocephalic nor brachj^cephalic. These meas- 
urements are expressed by an index in which the length is taken as 
100. If the proportion of breadth to length is 80 or upward, the skull 
is brachy cephalic; if between 75 and 80, mesaticephalic; and below 
75, dolichocephalic. Such a measurement is not so simple a matter 
as it might appear at first sight, and craniologists may themselves 
be classified into grou})s according as they have selected the nasion, or 
depression at the root of the nose, the glabella, or prominence above 
this depression, and the ophryon, a spot just above this prominence, 
as the anterior point from which to measure the length. In a young 
child this measurement woukl practically be the same whichever of 
these three points was chosen, and each point would be about the same 
distance from tiie brain. With the appearance of the teeth of the 
second detention and the enlargement of the jaws, the frontal bone in 
the region of the eyebrows and just above the root of the nose thick- 
ens, and its outer table bulges forward so that it is now no longer par- 
allel with the inner table. Between these tables air cavities gradually 
extend from the nose, forming the frontal siiuises. Although the 
existence and significance of these spaces and their influence on the 
prominence of the eyebrows were the subject of a fierce controversy 
more than half a century ago between the phrenologists and their 



654 THE DEVELOPMENT oF SKULL AND BRAINS. 

opponents, it is only recently that thoir variations have been carefully 
investigated. 

The frontal sinuses are usually supposed to vary according to 
the degree of prominence of the glabella and the supraorbital 
arches. This, however, is not the case. Thus Schwalbe" has figurcnl 
a skull ill which the sinuses do not project as high as the top of 
the glabella and supraor))ital prominences, and another in which 
they extend considerably at)ove these projections. Further, Dr. 
Logan Turner,'' who has made an extensive investigation into these 
cavities, has shown that in the at)original Australian, in which this 
region of the skull is unusually prominent, the frontal sinuses 
are frequently either absent or rudimentary. The ophryon has been 
selected by some craniologists as the anterior point from which to 
measure the length of the skull, under the impression that tlu^ frontal 
sinuses do not usually reach above the glal)ella. Dr. Logan Turner, 
however, foiuid that out of 174 skulls in which the frontal sinuses were 
present, in i:)<> the simises extended above the ophryon. In 71 skulls 
the depth of the sinus at the level of the ophryon varied from 2 to 1») 
millimeters, the avei-age ])eing i'>.'2 millimeters, while in the same series 
of skulls the depth at the glalxdla varied from ?> to 18 millimeters, with 
an average dei)th of S.;") millimeters. It thus appears that the selection 
of the ophryon in preference to the glabella, as giving a more accurate 
clue to the length of the brain, is ])ased upon erroneous assumptions, 
and that neither point can be relied upon in the determination of the 
anterior limit of the cranial cavity. 

The difficulties of estimating the extent of the cranial cavity by 
external measurements and the fallacies that may result from a reli- 
ance upon this method are especially marked in the case of the study 
of the pi-ehistoric human calvaria, such as the Neanderthal and the 
Trinil and the skulls of the anthropoid apes. 

Statistics are popularly supposed to be capable of proving almost 
anything, and certainly if you allow craniologists to select their own 
l)oints from which to measure the length and breadth of the cranium 
they will furnish you with tables of measurements showing that one 
and the same skull is dolichocephalic, mesaticephalic, and )>rachy- 
cephalic. T^et us take as an illustration an extreme case, such as the 
skull of an adult male gorilla. Its glabella and supraorbital arches 
will be found to project forward, its zygomatic arches outward, and 
its transverse occipital crests backward far beyond the anterior, 
lateral, and posterior limits of the cranial cavity. These outgrowths 
are obviously correlated with the enormous development of the mus- 
cles of mastication and those of the back of the neck. In a specimen

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SKULL AND BRAINS. 655 

in my possession the greatest length of the cranium, i. e., from glabella 
to external occipital protuberance, is 195 millimeters, and the greatest 
breadth, taken between the outer surfaces of the zygomatic processes 
of the temporal bone, is 172 millimeters, giving the marked ])rachy- 
cf^phalic index of 88.21. The zygomatic processes, however, may 
reasonably be o})jected to as indicating the true breadth, and the side 
wall of the cranium just a))ove the line where the root of this process 
springs from the squamous portion of the temporal bone will certainly 
ba much nearer the cranial cavit3\ Measured in this situation the 
breadth of the cranium is 118 millimeters, which gives a length- breadth 
index of 60.51, and thus represents the skull as decidedly dolichoce- 
phalic. The transverse occipital crests and the point where these 
meet in the middle line to foi'm the external occipital protuberance 
are much more prominent in the male than in the female gorilla, and 
the estimate of the length of the cranium in this male gorilla may be 
reduced to 160 millimeters, by selecting the base of the protuberance 
in place of its posterior extremity as the posterior end measurement. 
This raises the index to 73.75, and places the skull near the mesati- 
cephalic group. At the anterior part of the skull the prominent 
glabella is sepai'ated from the inner table of the skull by large air 
sinus(\s, so that on a median section of the skull the distance from 
the glabella to the nearest part of the cranial cavity is 36 millimeters. 
We have here, therefore, another outgrowth of the cranial wall which 
in an examination of the external surface of the skull obscures the 
extent of the cranial cavity. Accordingly the glabella can not be 
selected as the anterior point from w^hich to measure the length of the 
cranium, and must, like the zygomatic arches and occipital protuber- 
ance, be excluded from our calculations if we desire to determine a 
true length-breadth index. The difficulty, however, is to select a 
definite point on the surface of the cranium to represent its anterior 
end, which will be free from the objections justl}^ urged against the 
glabella. Schwalbe suggests the hinder end of the supraglabellar 
fossa, which he states often corresponds to the beginning of a more 
or less distinctly marked frontal crest. I have found this point either 
difficult to determine oi- too far back. Thus in my male gorilla the 
posterior end of this fossa formed by the meeting of the two temporal 
ridges was 56 millimeters ])ehind the glabella, and only 24 millimeters 
from the bregma, while in the female gorilla the temporal ridges do 
not meet, but there is a low median frontal ridge, which may be con- 
sidered as bounding posteriorly the supraglabellar fossa. This point 
is 22 millimeters from the glabella, and between .50 and 6o millimeters 
in front of the bregma. 

I would suggest a spot in the median line of the supraglabellar 
fossa which is crossed by a transverse line uniting the posterior bor-

ders of the external angular proce.sse.s of the frontal bone. 1 admit 
this plan is not free from objections, but it possesses the advantages 
of being available for both male and female skulls. In my male skull 
the selection of this point diminishes the length of the cranium by 'iio 
millimeters, thus reducing it to 137 millimeters. The breadth being 
calculated at 114 millimeters the index is 83.21, and hence distinctly 
brachycephalic. The length of the cranial cavity is 118 millimeters 
and the breadth 90 millimeters, and the length- breadth index is thus 
the brach3"cephalic one of 81.36. 

I have given these somewhat detailed references to the measure- 
ments of this gorilla's skull because they show in a very clear and 
obvious manner that from an external examination of the skull one 
might easily be misled as to the size and form of the cranial cavity, 
and that ii,i order to determine from external measurements the pro- 
portions of the cranial cavity, skull outgrowths due to other factors 
than brain growth must be rigorously excluded. Further, these 
details will serve to eiiiphasize the interesting fact that the gorilla's 
skull is decidedly brachycephalic. This character is by no means 
restricted to the gorilla, for it has l)een clearly proved ))y Virchow. 
Schwalbe, and others that all the anthropoid apes are markedly round- 
headed. Ever since the introduction b}?^ the illustrious Swedish anthro- 
pologist, Anders Ketzius, of a classification of skulls according to the 
proportions between their length and breadth, great attention has 
been paid to this peculiarit}'^ in different races of mankind. It has 
l)een generally held that brachycephaly indicates a higher type of 
skull than dolichocephaly, and that the increase in size of the brain in 
the higher races has tended to produce a brachycephalic skull. When 
the cranial walls are subject to excessive internal pressure, as in hydro- 
cephalus, the skull tends to become distinctly brach3^cephalic, as a 
given extent of wall gives a greater internal cavity in a spherical than 
an oval form. In estimating the value of this theor}^ as to the evolu- 
tionary line upon which tlie skull has traveled, it is obvious that the 
brachycephalic character of the skulls of all the anthropoid apes is a 
fact which requires consideration. 

Although an adult male gorilla, such as I have selected, presents 
in an extreme degree outgrowths from the cranial wall masking the 
true form of the cranial cavity, the same condition, though to a less 
marked extent, is met with in with the human subject. Further, it is 
interesting to note that the length of the skull is more liable to be 
increased by such growths than the breadth, since they occur espe- 
cially over the lower part of the forehead and to a less degree at the 
back of the skull, while the side walls of the cranium in the region of 
its greatest breadth generally remain thin. 

Few if any fossils have attracted an equal amount of attention or 
given rise to such keen controversies as the " Neanderthal'" and the 



THE DEVELOPMENT OE SKULL AND BRAINS. 657 

''Trinir' skullcaps. According to some authorities, both these skull- 
caps are undouV)tedly human, while others hold that the " Neandei-thal '' 
belongs to an extinct species of the genus Homo, and the "Trinir" is 
the remains of an extinct genus — P/tJiecanthi'opus erectun of Dubois — 
intermediate ))etween luan and the anthropoids. One of the most 
obvious and easily recognized peculiarities of these skullcaps is the 
very marked prominence of the supraor})ital arches. The ghibella- 
occipital length of the Neanderthal is Sd-t millimeters, and the greatest 
transverse diameter, which is over the parietal region, is 1.52 milli- 
meters^ — an index of 74.51 — while the much smaller Trinil calvaria, with 
a length of 181 millimeters and a breadth of 130 milimeters, has an index 
of 71.8. Both of these skulls are therefore slightly dolichocephalic. 
Schwalbe has corrected these figures by making reductions in their 
lengths on account of the frontal "outworks,'" so that he estimates the 
true length-])readth index of the Neanderthal as 80 and that of the 
Trinil as 75.5. These indices, thus raised about 5 per cent, are con- 
sidered to represent approximatel\' the length-breadth index of the 
cranial cavity. A comparison of the external and internal measure- 
ments of many recent skulls with prominent glabelhe would, I suspect, 
show a greater difl'erence than that calculated by Schwalbe for the 
Neanderthal and Trinil specimens. In a male skull, probably an 
aboriginal Australian, with a cranial capacity of 1,227 cubic centi- 
meters, I found that the glabella-occipital length was 189 millimeters 
and the transverse diameter at the parieto-squamous suture 127 milli- 
meters, which gives an index of 67.20 and makes the skull decidedly 
dolichocephalic. The length of the cranial cavity, however, was 157 
millimeters and the breadth 121 millimeters (an index of 77.07 and a 
difference of nearly 10 per cent), so that while from external measure- 
ments the skull is distinctly dolichocephalic, the proportions of its cavity 
are such that it is mesaticephalic. It is probable that many skulls 
owe their dolichocephalic reputation simply to the prominence of the 
glabella and supraorbital ridges. An excessive development of these 
structures is also liable to give the erroneous impression of a retreat- 
ing forehead. In tlie Australian skull just mentioned the thickness of. 
the cranial wall at the glabella was 22 millimeters. From this level 
upward it gradualh' thinned, until 45 millimeters above the glabella 
it was only millimeters thick. When the bisected skull was placed 
in the horizontal position the anterior surface of the frontal bone 
sloped from the glabella upward and distinctly })ackward, while the 
posterior or cerebral surface was inclined upward and forward. In 
fact, the cranial cavity in this region was separated from the lower 
part of the forehead by a wedge-shaped area having its apex upward 
and its base below at the glabella. 

The cranial wall opposite the glabella is not appreciably thicker in 
the Neanderthal calvaria than in the Australian skull to which 1 ha\ c 



658 THE DEVELOPMENT OF SKULL AND BRAINS. 

alread}' referred, and the form of the cranial cavity is not more maslved 
by this prominence in the Neanderthal than in many of the existing races. 

Although the Neanderthal skull is by no means complete, the base 
of the cranium and the face bones being absent, still those parts of 
the cranial wall are preserved that are specially related to the portion 
of the brain which Subserves all the higher mental processes. It 
includes the fi'ontal, parietal, and upper part of the occipital l)ones, 
with parts of the roof of the orbits in front, and of the squamous 
division of the temporal bones at the sides. On its inner or cranial 
aspect there are markings by which the boundaries between the cere- 
brum and the cerebellum can be determined. In a profile view of 
such a specimen an inioglabellar line can he drawn which will corre- 
spond very closely to the lower boundary of the cerebrum, and indi- 
cate a horizontal plane above which the vaulted portion of the skull 
must have contained nearly the whole of the cerebrum. 

Schwalbe^' has devised a series of measurements to illustrate what 
he regards as essential differences between the Neanderthal skullcap 
and the corresponding portion of the human skull. From the inio- 
glabellar line another is drawn at right angles to the highest part of 
the vault, and by comparing the length of these two lines we can 
determine the length-height index. According to Schwalbe, this is 
40.4 in the Neanderthal, while the mininuun in the human skull is i'2. 
He further shows that the frontal portion of the vault, as represented 
by a glabella-bregmatic line, forms a smaller angle with the base oi- 
inioglabular line, and that a vertical line from the posterior end of 
the frontal ])one (bregma) cuts the inioglabella farther back than in 
the human subject. Professor King, of Galway, attached special 
importance to the shape and proportions of the parietal l)ones, and 
more particularly to the fact that their mesial borders are shorter than 
the lower or temporal, whereas the reverse is the case in recent man. 
This feature is ol)viously related to the defective expansion of tho 
Neanderthal vault, and Professor Schwalbe also attributes consideral)l(' 
signiticance to this pecularity. 

Another distinctive feature of the Neanderthal skull is the relation of 
the orbits to the cranial wall. Schwalbe shows that its brain case takes 
a much smaller share in the formation of the roof of the orbit than it 
does in recent man, and King pointed out that a liiu^ from the anterior 
inferior angle of the external orbital process of the frontal bone, drawn 
at right angles to the inioglabellar line, passed in the Neanderthal in 
front of the cranial cavity, whereas in man such a line would have a 
considerable portion of the frontal part of the brain case anterior to it. 

From the combined results of these and other measurements, 
Schwalbe arrives at the very important and interesting conclusion that 

«"Ueber die specitischen Merkmale des Neanderthalschiidels," Verhandl. der 
anatomipchen Gesellschaft in Bonn, 190L 



THE DEVELOPMENT OE SKULL AND BRAINS. (i59 

the Neanderthal skull possesses a number of important peculiarities 
which differentiate it from the skulls of existing- man and show an approx- 
imation toward those of the anthropoid apes. He maintains that in rec- 
OD-nizing- with King-" and Cope^ the Neanderthal skull as belonging to a 
distinct species, Iloino N^eanderthalensis, he is onl}- following the usual 
practice of zoologists and paleontologists, by whom specitic characters 
are frequently founded upon nuich less marked differences. He main- 
tains that as the Neanderthal skull stands in many of its characters 
nearer to the higher anthropoids than to recent man, if the Neanderthal 
type is to be included under the term Homo ^aplcnH^ then this species 
ought to be still more extended, so as to embrace the anthropoids. 

It is interesting to turn from a perusal of these opinions recently 
advanced l)y Schwalbe to consider the grounds on which Huxley and 
Turner, about forty years ago, opposed the view, which was then 
being advocated, that the characters of the Neanderthal skull were so 
distinct from those of any of the existing races as to justify the recog- 
nition of a new species of the genus Homo. Huxley, while admitting 
that it was "the most pithecoid of human skulls, '\vet holds that it 
"is b}" no means so isolated as it appears to l)e at first, l)ut forms in 
reality the extreme term of a series leading graduall\' from it to the 
highest and best developed of human crania." He states that " it is 
closely approached by certain Australian skulls, and even more nearly 
by the skulls of certain ancient people who inhabited Denmark during 
the stone period." Turner's'^ observations led him to adopt a similar 
view to that advanced b}' Huxley. He compared the Neanderthal 
calvaria with savage and British crania in the Anatomical Museum of 
the University of Edinburgh, and found among them specimens 
closely. corresponding to the Neanderthal type. 

While yielding to no one in my admiration for the thoroughness 
and ability with which Schwalbe has conducted his elaborate and 
extensive investigations on this (luestion, I must confess that in my 
opinion he has not sufficientU' recognized the signiticance of the large 
cranial capacity of the Neanderthal skull in determining the zoolog 
ical position of its owner, or made sufficient allowance for the great 
variations in form which skulls undoubtedl}' human may present. 

The length and breadth of the Neanderthal calvaria are distinctl}^ 
greater than in many living races and compiMisate for its defect in 
height, so that it was capable of lodging a brain fully equal in volume 
to that of many existing savage races and at least double that of any 
anthropoid ape. 

A luimber of the characters upon which Schwalbe relies in differ- 
entiating the Neanderthal skullcap are due to an appreciable extent

to the great development of the o-l;il)ella and supraorbital an-bes. 
Now these processes are well known to present very strikino- variations 
in existing human races. They are usually supposed to be developed 
as buttresses for the purpose of affording support to the large upper 
jaw and enable it to resist tlie pressure of the lower jaw due to the con- 
traction of the powerful muscles of mastication. These processes, how- 
ever, are usuall}' feebly marked in the microcephalic, prognathous, and 
macrodont negro skull, and may be well developed in the macrocephalic 
and orthognathous skulls of some of the higher races. Indeed, their 
variations are too great and their significance too obscure for them to 
form a Ixxsis for the creation of a new species of man. Both Iluxlej^ 
and Turner have shown that the low vault of the Neanderthal calvaria 
can be closely paralleled b}^ specimens of existing races. 

If the characters of the Neanderthal calvaria are so distincti\e as to 
justify the recognition of a new species, a new genus ought to he 
made for the Trinil skullcap. In nearl}^ every respect it is distinct!}^ 
lower in type than the Neanderthal, and yet many of the anatomists 
wlio have expressed their opinion on the subject maintain that the 
Trinil specimen is distinctly human. 

Important and interesting as are the facts which may be ascertained 
from a study of a series of skulls regarding the size and form of the 
brain, it is evident that there are distinct limits to the knowledge to ))e 
o])tained from this source. Much additional information as to racial 
characters would undoubtedly be gained had we collections of brains at 
all corresponding in number and variety with the skulls in our juuseums. 
We know that as a rule the brains of the less civilized races are smaller 
and the convolutions and fissures simpler than those of the more 
cultured nations; ])eyond this but little has been definitel}^ determined. 

As the results of investigations in human and comparative anatomy, 
physiology, and pathology, we know that definite areas of the cere})ral 
cortex are-connected with the action of definite groups of muscles, and 
that the nervous impulses starting from the organs of smell, sight, 
hearing, and conunon sensibility reach defined cortical fields. All 
these, however, do not cover more than a third of the convoluted sur- 
face of the brain, and the remaining two-thirds are still to a large 
extent a terra incognita so far as their precise function is concerned. 
Is there a definite localization of special mental qualities or moral 
tendencies, and if so, where are they situated ? These arc problems of 
extreme difficult}^, but their interest and importance are difiicult to 
exaggerate. In the solution of this problem anthropologists are 
bound to take an active and important part. When they have col- 
lected information as to the relative development of the various parts 
of the higher brain in all classes of mankind with the same thorough- 
ness with which they have investigated the racial peculiarities of the 
skull the question will be within a measurable distance of solution. 



THE ANTIQUITY OF THE LION IN GREECE. 



By A. B. Meyer.' 



The descriptive images of the lion l)y the earliest Greek author, 
Homer,* are so realistic and true to nature (compare especially in the 
Iliad, XI, 544 sqq.), that thej must be ascribed to direct observation,'' 
yet this does not prove the existence of that animal in Greece in 
historic time. Aside from other possibilities, it is uncertain whether 
the passag-es in question originated as late as the entire Homeric epic 
on the soil of Asia Minor (^■Eolia, Ionia), or whether they belong to 
earlier continental (Thessalian) collections of hymns. Herodotus, 
from about 4S4 to about 430 b. c, records, in volume vii, pages 124- 
126, of his history, that there are many lions between the Achelous 
River in Acarnania and the Nestus, which flows through Abdera, and 
this he mentions in connection with the description of Xerxes's expe- 
dition through Macedonia in 480 b. c, when lions killed some draft 
camels. This passage is often cited. Aristotle (384-322 b. c), in 
Hist, anim., viii, 28, gives the same range, but seems to have taken 
it only from Herodotus.'^ 

On this G. C. Lewis'^ remarks: 

The scientific character of Aristotle's researcliea in natural history gives great 
weight to his testimony. As he was a native of Stagira and had resided in Mace- 
donia, he may be supposed to have had opportunities for verifying it; and we can 
not assume that he blindly followed the account of Herodotus, although at an 
interval of about a century he defines the range of the lion by the same two rivers.

der L("iwe in Griechenland nachweisbar?" Reprint from Der Zoologische Garten,

^The most important passages among ancient authors who refer to the lion have 
been brought together in an interesting manner by H. O. Lehz, in "Zoologie der

()()2 THE ANTIQUITY OF THE LION IN OKKKOE. 

Further, ai'ter culling attention to the fact that Aristotle coi-rected 
a nonsensical statement of Herodotus on the act of parturition of the 
lion, he adds: 

* * * It i^eems very unlikely that Aristotle should have Ijeeii al)le to correct 
the historian's account of the parturition of the lioness but not have thought it 
worth his while to verify the more obvious and patent fact of the occurrence of the 
lion in northern Greece. « 

And on page 59 he .says: 

It is very improbable that * * * he should in two places (i. e., also vi, 31) 
have repeated so important a statement as that of the presence of the lion in the 
whole of northern Greece, from Abdera in Thrace to the confines of ^olia, without 
verification and ui)on the mere credit of Herodotus, whom he elsewhere designates 
as afalmlist and whose errors in natural history he points out and rectifies in several 
places. 

All this, though not cogent, is so ol»\ ious that it is easily understood 
when the philologist and the historian do not ((uestion Herodotus's 
''account, so definitely presented and twice repeated by Aristotle, a 
native of that region.'"' Nay, J. Beloch^ even adds: "That it [the 
lionj once spread over the whole peninsula (i. e., also over middle 
(ireece and the Peloponnesu.s) is shown by the myths of the Nemean 
and Cithajronian lions."'' On the part of phdology there is thus 
a})parently no ground to doubt the ancient tradition that even in 
historic time, about 500 b. c, there were lions in a i)art of Europe 
situated near Asia. 

Turning from the ancient tradition to the domain of linguistic facts, 
we find among the Greeks a high antiquity of the lion's name,'' unpar-

the name makes it probable that it originall}' denoted an indigenous 
animal which could not have been other than the lion. But the 
existence of that animal in historic time is not thus proved, and the

originally designated an indigenous animal leads us now to turn to 
zoology " for a possible solution of the problem. 

Likewise, if we search among* the place names for traces of the 
existence of the lion we gain nothing. True, the word Xecov (leon) 
occurs as the name of a cape near Eretria and Lebena* in Crete, ))ut 
these names certainly do not refer to the animal as native to the region, 
but merelv indicate that the rock suggests a lion in shape.'' What, 
then, IS the attitude of zoologists and paleontologists toward this 
(|uestion ^

becomes very pro])able that in 330 u. c;. lions were still encountered in 
Macedonia, though ver}^ rare." It is as little doubted by A. Newton,'^ 
Dupont, Nehring, von Zittel (see below), and others. Dawkins' also 
refers, in agreement Avith Lewis, ^ to Xenophon^' (from about i2S until 
after 355 b. c.) in regard to the occurrence of the lion in historic time 
in South Thracia, and adds: "It ma}' have extended far over the

(36-4 THE ANTIQUITY OF THE LION IN GREECE. 

If bones of the rectttt lion have not 3'et been found in Greece, it 
should be remembered that the limited researches made in that countr}^ 
render negative evidence of little account. On the other hand, fossil 
lion bones are found. Thus only recently, as Dr. T. Kriiper at 
Athens informed me, Doctor Skuphos found such a skull. The fossil 
cave lion was spread all over Europe during- the Diluvial period. 
"In Diluvial bone caves of Europe," says von Zittel," "the cave lion, 
which does not differ from the lion now found in Africa and western 
Asia, occurs in solitary examples. In historic time it still inhabited 
southern Europe." Nehring has recently proved the existence of the 
Diluvial Wow {Fells s2^elpeaA}o\di.) in the province of Branden})urg,'^ 
and previousl}' also in Thuringia, Westphalia, Brunswick. Hanover, 
and the province of Saxony.'' He remarks on that occasion: "As 
regards the question of the contemporaneousness of man with Fells 
S2)elcea^ I can not help affirming it on the basis of my excavations in 
the gypsum quarry of Thiede (Brunswick)." We may expect an 
elaborate treatise by Professoi' Nehring on the Diluvial lion. He 
thinks, as he informed me, that about 20,000 years ago, during the 
steppe period, the cave lion roamed in Germany as far north as Bruns- 
wick. Dupont considers such fixing of dates impossible, and thinks 
that for the present we must be content with establishing the succes- 
sion of forms (loc. cit.). He has variously proven the existence of 
Fells spelhvd in Belgium.'' Its occurrence in England has been fully 
discussed bv Dawkins and Sanford,'' who say that it completely dis- 
ap})eared at the end of the Post-Glacial or Quaternary period, and that 
no finds of prehistoric time have been made. The same investigators 
discuss-^ its occurrence also in France, Belgium, Germany, the Car- 
pates, Italy, and Sicily. In the latter territory it is supposed (accord- 
ing to Falconer) to have existed contemporaneously with man. Thus, 
according to paleontological indications, the lion was once spread over 
almost entire Europe. 

This fossil lion of Europe is, in the opinion of most investigators, 
identical with the lion of the present. Such identit}" was alread}' 
asserted by D'Orbigny ■'/ in 1858-1861, and, later, Dawkins and Sanford, 
in their already quoted work,^*^ in which they treated of the Fells 
xpelxa with the utmost completeness and care, arrived at the conclu- 
sion "that there is not one character b}^ which the animal can be dis- 
tinguished from the living lion. It must therefore be admitted that

Fells spelsea is specifically identical with the lion now living on the 
face of the earth." For practical reasons they recommend the use of 
the designation Fdlx leo var. spelcea to denote that variety which dur- 
ing the Post-Glacial period inhabited the caves of north and west 
P^urope, In 181K> Nehring" declares, following the opinion of most 
modern investigators, that the cave lion, Felissjydsea^ is ''nothing else 
than a nortliorn variety of the lion [evidently provided with a warm, 
shaggy skin] analogous to the northern variety of the tiger which 
occurs at present in south Siberia."" Dupont* likewise observes: "The 
lion, the reindeer, and the stag of the Quaternary epoch, in the remains 
which have been preserved to us, as much resemble those which live 
at present as the ibis which was embalmed thousands of 3^ears ago 
resembles the ibis which embellishes the shores of the Nile. The 
American Feli.s afro,!' Leidy is also, according to Dawkins and Sanford, 
identical with F. leo var. spelaia^ so that its range extended o\'er Europe, 
through Russia and north Asia, and, by way of Bering Strait, into 
America as far south as Mexico (loc cit., p. 103). 

All the deposits in which the bones of the cave lion have been found 
in the countries mentioned above are either Post-Glacial or Quater- 
nary. But Dawkins and Sanford think it w^ould be rash to, a priori, 
exclude the occurrence in the Pliocene time. The}' also point out that 
Aristotle calls the lion "rare," while Herodotus, one hundred and fifty 
years l)efore, could still say there were "many," and they think that it 
decreased during that interval. The}^ then further observe, follow- 
ing Lewis,'' that Dio (Jhrysostomus, 80 or 100 a. d., speaks of the 
complete extinction of the lion, so that within four hundred 3"ears after 
Aristotle it disappeared from Europe.'' Lastly, they lay stress upon the 
lion in the folklore of the Balkan peoples because this permits the 
conclusion of the simultaneous occurrence of the lion with man. This, 
too, is based chiefly on the data I)rought together by G. C. Lewis in 
his two extremel}^ readable essays." 

Whatever weight may be given to the accounts or legends of the 
ancients or to th(> views of modern naturalists on the sinuUtaneous- 
ness of man with the cave lion, there is at all events a connection 
between the former and present range of the lion, and since lions still 
roam not far from Greece its gradual retreat l)efore man and civiliza- 
tion to the present limit of its range is not only not uidikely, I)ut, on 
the contrary, most prol)able.

(i6f> TH?: ANTIQUITY OF THE LION IN GREECE. 

' According to the Old Testament, the lion was common in the Leba- 
non region and even on the Jordan. It occurred in Palestine until 
the twelfth century (the time of the Crusaders)." In Syria its exist- 
ence can be traced from the earliest historical times to the present 
day. According to Perrot and Chipiez,'' Amenophis Til (1400 b. c.) 
is proved to have chased the lion in northern Syria on a large scale. 
Only twenty years ago, according to Tristram (loc. cit.), the body of 
;i lion was brought to Damascus. In Kgypt proper, lions but rarel}^ 
occurred,'' while in northern Syria they must have been quite numerous. 
Ancient writers also — Xenophon, Aristotle, Strabo, Pliny, and others — 
speak of lion hunts in Syria and in Arabia. The lions in the latter 
country are said to have been more powerful and mmierous than in 
Lybia. Tristram states that in Mesopotamia the lion is at present 
conmion. Layard, in the middle of the last century, heard its roaring 
not far from Bagdad. In the north it occurs on the Tigris as far as 
Kalaat Schergat, on the Euphrates as far as Bir,''and, lastly, in Persia, '^ 
where the lion is especially found "in the forest slopes of the Zagros," 
the chief mountain region of Persia. Abbott' mentions the lion 
among the animals of Khorasmia.^/ On its occurrence in northwest 
India, see Blandford (loc. cit.) and Dawkins.'' 

Considering all this, I hold it not well to be doubted, from reasons 
of natural science, that in Herodotus's time lions still lived in the 
regions named by him, and I hold it not impossible that the ancient 
lion representations in Greece, such as a lion chase upon a Mycen^an

t-' "The artists of the new empire were encouraged to a frequent representation of 
the lion alwve all through the renewed acquaintance with the animal itself, and one 
might think that this Asiatic lion possessed their imagination when they depict lions 
either with a very light mane or with none at all, if both varieties did not appear at 
Beni Hassan. At all events the lion with heavy mane is the more original type in 
Egyptian art . . . Only very rarely do the forms of the lion in Egyptian represen- 
tations indicate the Assyrian type. The heraldic use of animals upon shields and 
pectorals is also of Asiatic origin, appearing in the second Theljean empire in pictures 
which exhibit gryphons, jackals, and lions." (Perrot and Chipiez, loc. cit.) Thus 
there oct-ur upon Egyptian monuments both the Egyptian and the Asiatic types of 
lions (l)oth wild and tamed), with a noticeable difference, which is worth considera- 
tion also in other parts of ancient archfeology, as, for instance, in the study of the 
Greeks.

dagger, were made from nature, viz, at a time when the animal still 
occurred there in a wild state. Lewis is of a diti'erent opinion, and 
says:" "The lions on the gate of M3'cena? are of great antiquity, but 
the occurrence of this animal in w^orks of early art can not be con- 
sidered as evidence of his presence in the country. Sculptured lions 
occur more than once in connection w^ith Etruscan tombs, and there 
is no reason to believe that the lions ever existed in Italy * * *.'" 
But can this last objection be considered valid ? * Besides, not all non- 
naturalists are of this opinion, as, for instance, Perrot and Chipiez:'' 
''Unless we assume — and we have no ground whatever for so doing — 
that it was an object imported from without,'^ we must admit, not- 
withstanding all that has been said to the contrary, that the lion in 
those remote times still haunted the mountains of the Peloponnesus 
and central Greece, and that the engravers and sculptors, when they 
portrayed that animal, were able to do so from nature." Thus in the 
discussion of the earliest historic time more or less subjective opin- 
ions come into play, and natural science likewise can consider the 
question as solved only when the discovery of recent lion bones under 
incontestable circumstances gives positive proof. Of this, however, 
there seems little hope. At all events it might be suggested that in 
future excavations all animal bones be conscientiously collected and 
submitted to experts for examination.

''Prof. P. Herrmann, of the Royal Sculpture Collection at Dresden, writes me: 
"The view of Lewis, which is based on the lion representations in Etruscan art, and 
quoted by you, is absolutely untenable. These Etruscan monuments are a thousand 
years younger than the Mycenaean and have, besides, their parallels in the contem- 
porary art creations of the Greeks. No archaeologist has maintained or will main- 
tain of either of them that the lion images appearing on them were made from direct 
observation of nature. They are obviously borrowed from Asia. This shows itself 
clearly enough in the absence of the refined and free realism which characterizes the 
Mycenaean representations in such a high degree." Compare also the chapter 
"The lion and the lotus," in William II. Goodyear's The Grammar of the Lotus, 
London, 1891, pp. 205-211, witli plates xxix and xxx (add. 1904).

THE EXCAVATIONS AT ABUSIR. EdYPT. 



By Prof. Dr. .\. Wikdkmanx." 



The traveler from Cairo ascending" the Mokattani mountains sweeps 
his gaze westward and his vision is presently arrested by the great 
pyramids looming upward in rigid conventional forms on the table- 
land across the Nile as reminders of that old civilization of which they 
are the best known surviving memorials. In ancient days they must 
have been much more imposing than at present, for besides the few 
structures now visible, there stood on the opposite elevation more than 
loo pyramids, as well as numerous temples and monumental tombs, 
while below them on the plain, where only isolated villages are now 
seen, there spread out one of the larg'est cities recorded by ancient 
history, Mennefer, "the beautiful place," Memphis of the Greeks. 
The "city of the dead," to which for nearly four thousand j'ears the 
inhabitants of this great city were carried to their last rest, is marked 
b}" the pyramids. The width of this necropolis was not great, scarcely 
exceeding 2 kilometers, but its length has been estimated at oO kilo- 
meters. The size of the "city of the living" was in proportion to 
the great necropolis, and under modern European conditions this 
would indicate an enormous city, surpassing- in extent even the 
city of London (about 22 kilometers). V\e must not forget, how- 
ever, that we are in the Orient where the crowding of buildings 
together is little in vogue, groups of houses being followed by 
broad gardens and fields, then other clusters of houses, or wide 
desert tracts, in checkered succession, so that a city is really 
nothing more than a collection of several separated localities. Ori- 
ental cities also frequentl}" change their location; some portions avv 
abandoned or become insignificant suburbs, while new quarters spring 
up by their sides. Such was the development of Cairo, where, by tlie 
side of the important city of Babylon-on-the-Nile of tlie old Egyptian 
and the Grseco-Roman periods, arose old Cairo, whicii soon surpassed 
it. Then, farther north, was developed tiie modern C^airo. Old Cairo 
has to a great extent gradually disappeared, while Babylon, as a small

place, inclosed by the walls of a Roman fortress, survived it. Ancient 
Memphis likewise experienced a shifting of its principal center, the 
change of position being traced b}^ the locations of the pyramids, for 
the Pharaohs liked to build their homes not far from their future 
burial places. Thus, at Thebes, the royal palace of Amenophis III 
was within the precinct of the necropolis, and the same custom wns 
also observed at Memphis, as proved by the discovery of the remains 
of a ro3'al palace l)eneath the foundations of a temple in the grave- 
yard city. From the location of the pyramids and the succession of 
their builders it can be inferred that Memphis as a rule spread from 
north to south, though occasionally for a brief period the course was 
in the opposite, direction. The site of the principal temple alone 
remained unchanged, though lesser sanctuaries to the same god might 
elsewhere, be erected. Thus the temple of Ptah, the local divinity 
of Memphis who was widely l)elieved to have created and to rule the 
world, lay between the Nile and the village of Sakkarah, while other 
sanctuaries, dedicated to the same god, arose in other parts of the cit3^ 
Near the present villages of Cxizeh and Sakkarah lie the two necrop- 
olis districts of Memphis which have been most assiduously investi- 
gated by modern explorers and whose monuments produce a most 
imposing impression. A visit to these places is part of the stated 
programme of most travelers in Egypt. One frequently gets also a 
view of other monuments of the graveyard cit}' that are situated 
more to the north and the south, between the above localities. Those 
to the north belong to the oldest remains of the kings resident in Mem- 
phis, while to the south are buried the rulers of the twelfth dynasty, 
who lived about a thousand years later. In the pyramids of Gizeh 
mummies of princes of the fourth dynast}' were interred, while in those 
of Sakkarah the}^ were chief!}' of the sixth dynasty. The pyramids 
of Abusir, between Gizeh and Sakkarah, were constructed under the 
fifth dynast}^ and for a long time were believed to offer little reward 
to the visitor; for althougli a few isolated and l)eautiful graves were 
found in their neighborhood, they had l)ecome covered again by the 
sand, so that tourists found here little worth seeing. This circumstance 
was an advantage to the necropolis, for absence of strangers means 
also freedom from that petty plunder of antiquities dependent on 
daily sales which is, on the. whole, more fatal to the monuments than 
the wholesale removal of plundered objects to be sold at a distance. 
As a result little excavating has been done here by the Arabs, and as 
the connections with Cairo are inconvenient, not nmch scientific explo- 
ration has been carried on. And yet such a work would have l)een 
profitable, as proved by the results of the excavations made by the 
Germans in the field of ruins during the last few years and which are 
briefly described in the following pages. 



THE EXCAVATIONS AT ABUSIR, EGYPT. 



C71 



The attention of the first scholars who visited the graveyard of 
Abusir was attracted by the ruins on its northern end, near the open- 
ing of a shallow desert valley into the arable country. It gave the 
impression of a pyramid which, from a casual investigation, was 
ascribed to King Ra-en-user, of the fifth dynasty. Superficial excavii- 
tions, especially those of Villiers Stuart, the P^nglish member of Par- 
liament, brought to light temple remains buried underground. Thus 
matters stood until about 1898, when it was found that Aral)ian antiquity 
traders had here discovered a series of reliefs, which came to the 
Museum of Berlin. The subjects and the execution of these reliefs 
were interesting enough to make scientific excavations on that site 
desirable before all the antiquities there buried should become the 
prey of the natives and scattered to all quarters of the compass. The 
Berlin Museum undertook the work, for which Dr. Freiherr von Biss- 




I'lii. 1. — Kucoii.st ruction of wuu .saiutuai y. (From Borcluirdl. ) 

ing furnisiicd the necessary funds, and during the winters of 1898 to 
1901 Drs. L. Borchai'dt and H. Schilfer brought the excavation 
work to a conclusion. There is as 3'et no final ])u])lication giving the 
completed I'csults of their investigiitions, but fi'om the pr(diminary 
reports it is possible to obtain an accurat(> survc}' of the essential 
achievements. 

At the rear end of a rectangular walled inclosure, 75 meters wide 
and 100 meters long, there rose a pyramid with a blunted top, from 
the center of which projected an obelisk. (See fig. 1.) Within the 
court stood an altar constructed of gigantic alabaster blocks, and 
near it on one side were sunken channels, leading to alabaster basins, 
evidently to carry off the blood of the victims from the inunediate 
vicinity of the altar. Behind the channels were numerous storerooms, 
while the east and south sides were occupied nith passages whose 



672 THE EXCAVATIONS AT ABUSIR, EGYPT. 

walls were once faced witli slabs of limestone decorated with reliefs 
partly still preserved. Opposite the altar a gateway led into the large 
inclosure. An inclined pathway led to the gate, and thus connected 
the plain with the elevated sanctuary. The lower end of the pathway 
terminated in a monumental gateway which stood within another 
walled inclosure. The latter inclosed a quadrangular space about 
800 meters square, which, with much exaggeration, was called a 
"city," though in reality the only residences here were those of the 
priests and officers stationed in the building. In addition to these 
Borchardt discovered outside the sanctuary, toward the south, brick 
masonry beside which lay remnants of decayed wood. As may be 
concluded from the form of the entire find, there once stood here a 
large w^ooden sacred bark resting upon brick foundations. 

The reliefs just mentioned represent, lirst of all, some of the cere- 
monies accompanying the founding of an Egyptian sanctuary. Thfe 
king and the goddess of the right measure determine the axis of the 
temple, make the opening for the foundation, offer the sacrifices of 
the corner stone, etc. Then the celebration of the Sed festival is 
depicted as it is also seen in the reliefs of numerous temples of the 
classical period of Egypt. The king sits upon a throne, then he 
descends the steps leading to the throne and is carried about on a 
chair. The people fall down before him; priests and officials follow 
him. Then he appears in various festal robes, his feet are washed, 
the royal children are brought in sedans, rows of sacred animals are 
led by, etc. Every representation of this festival formerly existed in 
duplicate, the Pharaoh performing these ceremonies on one side of 
the temple, being decorated with the insignia of a king of Upper 
Egypt, while on the other side he wears the vestments of a king of 
Lower Egypt. It is regretted that so far no explanation can be given 
of the object of the Sed festival, though it is so often mentioned in 
the inscriptions. In most cases the king appears to have celebrated 
the festival for the first time thirty vears after his appointment as 
Pharaoh or crown prince, and then repeatedly at shorter intervals. 
It was at all events combined with religious solemnities, especially 
with the erection of obelisks, and it may be that the sanctuary 
described above was established on such an occasion. 

Still more interesting than these reliefs are others representing the 
divinities of the Egyptian seasons in human form and behind them 
the images of the objects characteristic of each season. Plants and 
trees are depicted; birds flutter about or rest in their nests; fishes 
swim in the water; animals beget and bring forth young; men are 
engaged in fishing and fowling; the}' construct and use boats, till the 
soil, harvest tigs and honey, brew beer, hunt in the desert, and raise 
cattl(\ Similar representations occur in the tom])s of the so-called old 
Empire of Egypt (about 3000 b. c.) as pictures of the daily life in the

valley of tlio Nile, but those of our sanctuarv are marked l)y greater 
unity of arrangement and completeness of grouping. Only a few of 
the ordinary customs of life appear in the decoration of temples of 
later times. It is evident that in ancient times dail}' life was held to 
be more worth}' of preservation, while in later periods onl}" the sublime 
objects, rather than the doings of every day, were deemed worthy of 
representation on reliefs in the house of God, 

From what has been said it can readily be inferred that the struc- 
ture described was not a pyramid tomb, but rather a sanctuar}- in 
whose inclosure sacrifices were offered upon an altar erected in the 
open court. Such altars in the open air l)elonged to the sun god. 
This deity was first of all embodied in his planet in the sky, whence he 
could look down upon the gifts and where he could receive the smoke 
of the burnt oft'erings. But a god afar off did not satisfy the ancient 
Egyptians in their worship. The god must be near the altar, where 
he could have the full benefit of the sacrifices, and usually this object 
was attained by having close at hand the sacred animal or the statue 
or emblem serving as the embodiment of the god, and which actually 
became to them the very god himself. This was the case in Abusir. 
The pyramid obelisk, before which the altar stands, is the sun god in 
the form in which he dwelt in the holy of holies of the temple of his 
most holy city of the valley of the Nile, named for him Heliopolis, 
"the city of the sun." Behind sealed doors, opening onh^ to the elect, 
there stood a conical stone as divinit3\ Such a form of deity is often 
met with among the Semitic tribes, but whether their influences intro- 
duced it into Heliopolis or whether the natives of the valley of the 
Nile had similar conceptions of the sacredness of stones is still unde- 
termined. All that is known is that from most ancient times the deity 
was here represented in this manner, but that in the course of centu- 
ries there arose an uncertainty as to the exact form of the conical 
stone, it being once conceived as a pyramid, then as an obelisk, and 
later, as at Abusir, as a combination of both. Near the god there 
stood in the temple two sacred barks used by the sun god for his jour- 
ney across the heavenly ocean. One in the forenoon bore the newlj' 
resurrected sun, while the other in the afternoon carried the dying- 
planet as it descended from the zenith. Similar to this was tiie group- 
ing of the sacred objects at Abusir. The remnants of one of the barks 
was discovered during the recent excavations, ])ut the other is still 
covered by the desert sands. 

In the district of Memphis, however, the sun god was a stranger. 
Originally there reigned here Ptah, the god of Memphis, and Sokaris, 
the god of the adjoining district of Letopolis, the sparrow-hawk- 
headed prince of the realm of the dead, who gave his name to Sak- 
karah. When the fifth dynasty, whose members claimed descent from 
the sun god, ascended the throne, the kings endeavored to introduce 



r)74 THE EXCAVATIONS AT ABTJSIR, EGYPT. 

the worship of their heavenl}^ ancestor also into the district of their 
capital. He conld be snre here of a ready reception, for the Egyptian 
gods were not exclusive and were always ready to make room for 
other heavenly powers in the sanctuaries as long as their own cult 
was not prejudiced In^ it. The inscriptions teach us that gradually 
several pyramid obelisks w^ere erected in the vicinity of Memphis. 

According to the Egyptian view, at the moment when the image of 
a god was completed in the prescribed form there came into existence 
a new god, and in the study of these structures this belief is of funda- 
mental importance. The new^ god was equipped with all the rights 
and duties of the original divinity who was imitated by the image. 
He lived as long as the image lasted, and after its destruction passed 
away as a dead god into the other world. On this account old images 
of gods were occasionally buried in order to give the corpse of the 
god a proper resting place. The logical contradiction appearing in 
the juxtaposition of numerous similar divinities, as shown by the 
multitude of divine images, disturbed the Egyptians no more than did 
the many other unlogical elements which the sun-god religion presents 
to modern critics. The object of worship in the editice of Ra-en-user 
was accordingly the representation of the sun god newly created by 
the King; for him were intended the sacritices which were oti'ered 
upon the lai-ge altar. From the platform upon which the sanctuary 
stood the god could look down upon the worshipping multitude as it 
approached him. The discovery of this god image and its place of 
w^orship was the achievement of the excavations just described. 

From what has been said it follows that the northernmost large 
mound of ruins at Abusir did not contain the tomb of King Ra-en- 
user. Succeeding investigations made it clear that this must be some- 
what south of the sanctuaiy beneath a shapeless heap of debris, about 
thirty meters high, the remains of a pyramid adjoined on its eastern 
side b}^ a large tield of ruins. The (excavations of the German Orient 
Society, imder the direction of Dr. L. Borchardt, have since 1901 been 
devoted to this site. In the pyramid, Avhich had already been opened, 
little of importance could be expected, but the adjoining tield of ruins 
that covered the mortuary temple of Ra-en-user was more promising. 
Sanctuaries serving the same object had alread}^ been discovered near 
other pyramids. The temple recently examined made it possible to 
follow up, with their aid, the development of beliefs in the relation 
of the living to the dead in the early times of Egypt. 

The tomb was at first nothing but a hole in the desert sand, into 
which the earthly remains of the dead were laid either in parts or the 
entire body, as skeleton or mummy, with or without a coffin. By 
their side were placed some pots and bowls with food and drink for 
the deceased, whose physical needs were the same in the other world 
as in this. Gradually it became the custom to furnish the graves 



THE EX(iAVATI(>lsrS AT ABUSTK, KGYTT. 675 

more elaborate I}, \intil the gifts were .so numerous that the shnple 
grave could no longer hold them. Other rooms were then added, and 
the grave became a storehouse in which the gifts were placed either 
whole or broken into fragments. In the former case it was assumed 
that the deceased would himself use them in the grave which formed 
his dwelling place ; in the latter case it was believed that he sojourned 
in the other world in an abode which was the counterpart of his 
grave. The new body corresponded to the corpse, and in the same 
manner the fragments had their real comiterparts. In place of real 
offerings plastic imitations were frequently sul)stituted, especially in 
later times, or their images were merely painted on the walls of the 
tomb, and aided l)y magical fornnila the dead could give them real 
existence. Such pictorial offerings were less costl}' and were less 
exposed to deca}- than real ol)jects, and could afford the necessary basis 
for the constant renovation of the food articles and other needful 
things. 

These tomli structures at first lacked a place of worship. As no 
offerings were found in the earth above the grave tt) indicate that 
ceremonies were observed after the inter- 
ment, it is inferred that in the most ancient 
time the obligations of the survivors ended 
with the burial, so that the deceased could 
afterwards claim no more gifts. This con- 
ception, however, gradually underwent a . — 
change, and it was considered requisite for / \ 
the welfare of the departed that from time to (Z i/^^c>.,u. \ ^ 
time new sacrifices should be consecrated to fig. 2.— sun obelisk, from a con-

place. Rooms separate from the grave chamber became desirable, and 
such rooms indeed appear in Egyptian tombs from about the time of 
the pyramids until the passing away of the old religion. These are 
above the earth, separate from the inaccessible grave, and are open to 
visits from the living. 

In the pyramids the grave proper was in the closed interior of the 
structure, where tlie offerings were placed next to the coffin, or, since 
the fifth dynasty, were painted on the walls. In front of the pyra- 
mid there was sometimes erected a mortuar}' temple. The oldest edi- 
fice of this kind known was at the pyramid of King Snefru, a ruler 
during whose reign the transition from the later stone age to that of 
the strictly historical dynasti(\s in its varions directions was accom- 
plished. This building is unfortunately for the most part destroyed, 
there remaining only a covered winding path that led to a small room 
containing an altar and adjoining tiie pyramid. At the temple of the 
P3 ramid C'hefrcn, which is in a better state of preservation, a straight 
passage leads between storerooms to the sacrificial hall, while \\\ the 



676 THE EXCAVATIONS AT ABUSIR, EGYPT. 

temple of Mycerinus storerooms lie to the right and left of the holy 
of holies. The importance g-iven to storage places in these build- 
ing plans shows the old significance of the tomb as a repository for 
the dead, the place of worship being only a secondar}'^ consideration. 

In the later mortuary temples of the period following from about 
2000 B. c. this relation is reversed. It is true the}^ still have storerooms 
for the treasures of the sanctuaries, l)ut they are of less importance 
in the general plan. The temple has here become essential. Such a 
change was made necessar}^ by the development of the Egyptian 
religion, for no longer was it the real gift or action that was impor- 
tant, but the magical formula. If one wished to convey sometliing to 
the deceased, he was more certain of success ])y pronouncing the pre- 
scribed magical words than by the offering of real objects. 

This transition from the old temple with storerooms to the later cult 
temple, which heretofore had only been surmised, is now made clear by 
the excavations at Abusir. Here is found a complete temple with the 
usual arrangement of later times. In the rear rises the holy of holies 
not far from the pyramid. In front of it is a broad, covered room cor- 
responding to the later covered court and leading to the open court, 
around which a covered passage runs. Its back Avail is formed by the 
terminating masonr}' of the temple, while its front rests on tastefully 
shaped columns carved with papy rus designs. In the middle of the court 
a rain basin is sunk, from which an outflow leads outside the court. 

This construction proves that the middle part of the court was from 
the first intended to be uncovered, and it also refutes the still 
frequently' repeated assertion that no rain fell in ancient times in 
Egypt. At a more recent period the Egyptian temple terminatt^d 
with such an open court, its entrance forming a monumental, fortress- 
like gate, the so-called " pylon," but at Abusir this was not A^et the case. 
A simple door here leads into the court and a long passage leads up to 
it from the opposite direction. To the right and left of the passage 
are storerooms that have their continuation in still other passages 
surrounding the entire building and even extending to the north of 
the temple in front of the pj'^ramid. At the end of the main passage 
is the entrance door, which was reached from the plain of Memphis 
by a slanting, inclined path. The storeroom plan is thus still retained, 
but it is onl}' externally, not organically, attached to the cult rooms, 
which on their part have become an independent temple. 

The temple just described is not located before the center of the 
pyramid, but before the southern part of the east side. In the course 
of tlie excavations at Abusir it turned out that the storerooms of the 
temple extended northward on the east side of the pyramid, and that 
l)etween them and the center of the pyramid there was a large struc- 
ture which on th(^ front side of the pyramid was shut oft' by a large 
blind door. This building was not the holy of holies, or sanctum, of 



THE EXCAVATIONS AT ABUSIR, EGYPT. 077 

the pyramid temple, as it was supposed; for the sanctum — the room 
in which the solemn sacritices were performed — was in Eg-ypt, as else- 
where, an organic part of the temple. It seems to me probable that 
the 1)1 ind door was to serve as a passage for the deceased when he 
wished to leave the pyramid, his tomb. It had thus the same object 
as the Idind doors frequently painted or sculptured upon the Egyp- 
tian coffins or tomb walls. The departed king- could pass throug-h this 
door to the building near the sanctum, and from there assist at the 
sacritices, listen to the prayers, and inhale the odor of the oti'erings. 
Jt thus served the same purpose as the so-called ''serdab" or narrow 
vaulted chamber found in the private tombs, the so-called ''mastaba,'' 
alongside of the cult room, with which it occasionally conununicated 
by a narrow opening. In this serdab there was usually placed a statue 
of the dead, in which he could embody himself and participate in the 
sacrifices offered in his honor. 

This door also served the dead pharaoh as passage when he wished 
to revisit the earth and as specter to remind the living of the obla- 
tions to be ofiered to him, and to manifest upon earth the divine posi- 
tion to which he attained ])v dint of the magical formula. It may 
seem strange that this outlet for the deceased led not directly to the 
grave temple, but to a structure lying aside from it. The reason of 
this arrangement, also found in the mastaba, is probably to be sought 
in the belief of the Egyptians, of which numerous indications are found 
in the texts, that the souls of the dead, when not receiving a sufficient 
amount of offerings, and consequentl}^ in want of nourishment, would 
crowd at the gates of the locality searching the garbage heaps for food 
and attacking and robbing passers by. For this i)urpose the}' would 
also gather before the temples and the entrances to the tombs, whither 
offerings of food were brought and refuse dropped. It was therefore 
dangerous for the occupant of the tomb to pass such hungry preda- 
tory souls. The blind door located off' the temple was to enable the 
dead to pass from the grave into the open unseen b}^ the hostile souls, 
and thus escape the danger of being attacked by them. Thus also this 
find at the pyramid of Ra-en-user harmonizes in an excellent manner 
with what we otherwise know of the old Egyptian religious views. 

The walls of the edifice are adorned with reliefs that in part corre- 
spond to the usual representations in the tombs of the valley of the 
Nile. We find here th(». killing of the sacrificial animals, the leading 
them up in procession, the long rows of women who, as representatives 
of the possessions of th(^ departed, offer gifts. Alongside of them 
stand images which usually are seen only in temples — adoration of 
various gods by the king; the massacre of captured enemies whom the 
ruler kills with an uplifted club. etc. In these two kinds of pictures 
Ihc twofold object of the edifice, that of tomb and temple, finds a 
distinct expression. In this comiection it is interesting to observe 



B78 



THE EXCAVATIONS AT AHUSIR, EGYPT. 



that the manner of presenting these groups, just as in the reliefs of 
tlie sanctuary of the sun god at Abusir, discussed above, corresponds 
ahnost exactly to the mode of presentation shown in the temples of 
the flourishing period of Egypt one or two milleniums later. The 
same characteristics are found in the architectural forms, the colunms, 
cornices, and other features. It is therefore concluded that the view 
of the older investigators, that the art of the old empire of Egypt did 
not differ in principle from that of the later periods, was correct. 
The art of the later periods shows comparati\ ely insigniticant differ- 
ences, due to the progressive development of the people. This conclu- 
sion, howeA^er, has of late been frequently' disputed. ]Momiments 
whose inscriptions indicate very early time, but that exhibit peculiari- 
ties known only in later periods, have been declared to ])e in realit}'^ 
products of these later periods artificially given an archaic appearance; 
but the finds at Abusir show that these conclusions are erronc^ous and 
that such monuments are really as old as the names of the kings that 
they bear.

Fig. 3. — Plan of the Pyramid Temple of Ka-en-usur. 

The mortuary temple of King Ka-en-user is as little finished as most 
old Egyptian edifices of this kind. The king died before the last 
hand was put on the work, and his successors had so much to do with 
their own buildings that the}' felt no inclination to spend time and 
strength on the foundations of their predecessors. But this pharaoh 
left endowments on the income of which priests were appointed to 
exercise his cult of the dead, and centuries later these functionaries 
are still mentioned, though the temple was in process of decay, for 
graves of that time have been found dug into ruin heaps above the 
temple floor. Shortlj^ afterwards the cult, too, ceased, the walls of 
the temple were torn down, and the stones used for other ))uildings; 
high heaps of debi'is accumulated, common graves for the poor were 
made there, and a mound of ruins soon covered the entire site. 

On the occasion of these excavations tom])s of widely separated 
epochs of Egyptian history were opened in the neighborhood of the

temple described above. There were mastaba tombs of the old empire 
with the statues of their former occupants, and nonviolated tombs of 
the middle empire (2500 b. c.) with all the paraphernalia which those 
left behind had once placed for the departed in his grave. The tombs 
of the flourishing period of later Egypt were very poorly fltted out, 
and it is only with the Greek settlements in the country that costly 
interments again come to light. 



• THE TIMOTHEUS PAPYRUS OF THE PERSAI. 

In one of the graves of this Greek period at Abusir was discovered, 
on February 1, 1902, a papyrus roll containing a large portion of the 
poem Persai of Timotheus. The papyrus was found in a wooden 
coffin still containing its corpse, together with a pair of sandals, a 
broken leather bag, a piece of rust-eaten iron, and a fragment of 
burned wood. All these objects arc now at the Royal Museum of 
Berlin, and the papyrus has been published with a transcription, para- 
phrase, comments, and a facsimile reproduction in heliogravure, by 
Prof. Dr. Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff." The papyrus meas- 
ures 18.5 centimeters in height and when unrolled has a length of 1.11 
meters. It is inscribed with six columns of varied width and unequal 
number of lines in archaic Greek characters, resembling the style of 
monumental inscriptions, so that in the opinion of Professor Wilamo- 
witz this papyrus' represents the oldest book known, antedating the 
founding of the library of Alexandria and the establishing of the 
Alexandrian book trade. The four last columns are on the whole 
well preserved, while the first column, not protected by cover- 
ing, is crumbled into minute fragments, and of the second column 
the lower half is for the most part destroyed. A narrow margin 
on the first column, showing traces of having been cut through, 
proves that only part of the scroll had been deposited in the grave. 
We have, therefore, in this papyrus only the latter portion of 
the work. The fact, however, that Timotheus names himself as 
its author and that it treats of the naval defeat of a Persian 
king suffices to establish its identity with the Persai of Timotheus, 
which celc])rates the naval victory of the Greeks over Xerxes, the 
King of Persia, in 480 b. c. at Salamis, which was one of the decisive 
l)attles in the GrtKco-Persian wars. Timotheus is known to have been 
a celebrated poet and musician, ])orn at Miletus, Asia ]Minor, and died 
at an advanced age about 357 b. c. He was cspeciall}' distinguished 
as a composer of the so-called "nome," an ancient song or ode in the 
epic style, consisting of a narrative interwoven with speeches of

introduced characters, and sung to the accompaniment of the lyre by 
the poet himself on festival occasions in honor of some god. He is 
also recorded to have increased the number of the strings of the lyre 
to eleven, by which innovation he incurred the displeasure of the 
Spartans, who considered it to be a corruption of nuisic. But of the 
numerous compositions credited to him by later writers only a few 
fragments survive", and of the Persai only three verses were known. 
The Persai is also in the form of a nome and was first recited at the 
Panionion festival in honor of Poseidon, about 398 b. c. The part of 
the nome contained in this papyrus begins with the principal section 
of the poem, the omphalos, comprising the narrative. The ships are 
fitted out; the battle begins; the vessels dash against each other; 
lances fly about; firebrands whir in the air, setting the ships afire, 
from the glare of which the " smaraged" sea is reddened. The Persian 
fleet is put to flight; one rich follower of the Persian king battles 
with the waves, cursing the treacherous sea, and at last sinks while 
professing his hope for the victory of his king. Other Asiatics cling 
to rocks in the sea and bewail their inmiinent fate of death or cap- 
tivity. At last panic seizes also the royal headquarters, and the king, 
under lamentations, orders a general retreat of his motley army. The 
victorious Greeks erect a trophy to Zous and celebrate their victory 
with dance and song. In the epilogue the poet refers to himself, 
defending his innovation in music against the reproof of the Spartans, 
and invokes Apollo to "'give the people j^eace and blessing resting on 
the observation of the law." 

Of the details of the old Egyptian grave finds a better estimate ma}^ 
be formed when the results of the digging still in progress become 
available. 

The excavations of the German Orient Society on the soil of the 
ancient Valley of the Nile have not received the same consideration 
from the great public as the diggings of the same societ}^ in Bab}- 
Ionia. To the latter attention was directed by the lectures of Fried- 
rich Delitzsch, although their contents were but loosely connected 
with the excavations. The Egyptian work has not received the same 
treatment. Considering the real scientific results of the excavations 
in themselves, it can not be denied that the Egj^^tian explorations of 
the society, directed by Borchardt, have at least been crowned with as 
great a success as the Babylonian. It is to be hoped that the con- 
tinued interest of the Government, as also the increasing number of 
members, will place the society in the condition to pursue its explora- 
tions with equal vigor in both of these countries whose civilization 
dominated early antiquity and likewise to extend its research to the 
countries lying between them, Palestine and Syria.

THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 



Bv Dr. Leopold Messerschmidt." 



In addition to the two o'reut spheres of ancient culture found in 
western Asia, the Eg-yptian and the Bal)ylonian, we meet in the nortli, 
chiefly in Asia Minor, a third element which we are accustomed to call 
the Hittite civilization. We have as yet comparatively little knowl- 
edge of this people and their histor}^, for only in one or two places 
have tliere been thorough excavations. The Hittite inscriptions them- 
selves have not been deciphered, and tlie Egyptian and Assyrian inscrip- 
tions give only such meager items as records of warfare required. The 
Old Testimient, to which until now our acquaintance with the name of 
the Hittites has been chiefly due, is too remote from the events in time 
and place and too indeflnite in details to be of much service. Although 
our knowledge of the Hittites is thus, in many respects, so incomplete, 
yet we are able to construct a somewhat connected picture of the 
development of their civilization. 

Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions tell of warfare from about 1500 
to about 700 B. c. , with various peoples in North Syria, North Mesopota- 
mia, Cilicia, Ca[>padocia, and Armenia. These peoples were neither 
Semites nor Indo-Europeans, yet they must have been interrelated as 
parts of a great group of peoples or common race. In favor of this 
view, the names of persons and g-ods come down to us which by their 
identical formation bear evidence of relationship and it is moreover 
improbable that entirely distinct races would at about the same period, 
and partly mingled, advance in the saiue direction and toward the same 
regions. On the other hand, it is self-evident, and proven also by 
certain facts, that these individual peonies, notwithstanding their gen- 
eral connection, were really distinct from one another in culture and in 
dialect, a phenomenon well known among the Semites as well as among 
the Indo-Europeans. 

One of these peoples, known through Egyptian inscriptions as the 
Cheta, or Chatti according to Assj'rian inscriptions, must be mentioned 
at once, since the name is signiflcant, for we are accustomed to desig- 
nate the entire group as '"Hittites,"' their individual names being

unknown. Consideration must therefore be ^^iven in eaeli case as to 
whether the name Hittites denotes the individual Chatti people or the 
entire race. 

In the regions where the Eg3'ptians and Ass^'rians were at war with 
the Hittites there has been discovered during the last decade a com- 
plete series of remarkable monuments, with and without inscriptions, 
which doubtless bear witness to a pecular and independent civilization 
alongside of the P^gyptian and Babylonian culture. The places of the 
finds, and particularly the agreement between subjects pictured and 
traditional evidence, lead to the assumption that we have here to do 
with monuments of the Hittite peoples. Similar monuments have 
been found scattered through the whole of Asia Minor, as far as 
Smyrna on the coast of the ^-Egean Sea, more numerous in the east, less 
frequent in 'the west. Keeping the above in mind, added to informa- 
tion derived from the Assyrian inscriptions, we must consider AsiaMinor 
as the home of the " Hittites" and of their civilivation, from which 
country they advanced in successive movements southward and south- 
hence thej immigrated into Asia Minor, whether 
from the Avest, which indeed is very probal)le, can not yet be positivel}^ 
determined. 

The historical development of the Hittite race, its rise and disap- 
pearance, has been described in a former paper," and will therefore 
here be but merely briefly repeated, with some additional information. 
The beginning of Hittite civilization on the soil of Asia Minor dates 
back to the third millenium before Christ, when S3a-ia and Meso])o- 
tamia were under Babvlonian rule. We assimie an advance of Hittite 
peoples toward Syria and Mesopotamia about 20('0 b. c, in the 
course of which they wrested these countries from BabNdonian domi- 
nation, for at the period when our documents begin to speak — that is, 
in the Tell el-Amarna letters,'' in the fifteenth century b. c. — we find 
that peoples of the Hittite race had for a long time been in possession 
of these regions. 

The first stratum of the Hittites wdiich through the above-mentioned 
letters enters our horizon is the jNlitani people,'' but whether they 
were really the first of the Hittites to advance as far as Syria, or, what 
is more probable, whether they were preceded ])y others, none of our 
documents answers with certaint\\ But the kingdom of the Mitani, 
under their king, Tushratta, meets us at once as a gi'cat power ecpial 
to Babylonia and Egypt, comprising Melitene and the territories to 
the southeast of it, then northern Syria and northern Mesopotamia, 
with Nineveh, which was later the capital of Ass,yria. Still, the powder 
of this kingdom is evidently strongly on the wane. It nnist formerly,

THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 688 

probably in the sixteenth oentuiy, have extended far southward into 
Syria to Mount Lebanon, as we have evidence that the language of 
the Mitani was spoken in Dunip (= lioliopolis = Baalbek). And the 
unnamed power against which Thothnies I, about 1500 b. c, and 
Thothnies III carried on war in Naharina was probably the jVIitani 
kingdom." But soon after the Amarna period, already in the four- 
teenth century, rising Assyria overthrew the Mitani kingdom and 
took possession of Mesopotamia. 

While the Mitani must have advanced toward the south, in the 
seventeenth or sixteenth century B. c, we see the Chatti, or individual 
people of the Plittites, Just at the Tell el-Amarna period, in the 
fifteenth century b. c, invading Syria from their native country, 
Cappadocia, and continually advancing southward. Through the 
weakness of Egypt, and for a time also the waning power of Assyria, 
the Mitani in the course of the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries 
sul)]ected entire S3"ria to themselves as far as Mount Hernion. At 
the acme of their power, in the twelfth century, they meet the read- 
vancing Egyptians under Ramses II in various battles, one of which, the 
attack of the Egyptians on the city of Kadesh on the Orontes, became 
well known, as the subject of a great Egyptian poem which extolls 
King Ramses in an extravagant manner. From these times dates also 
the oldest surviving example of a treaty between nations. This treaty 
was concluded between Ramses II and Chattusar, the king of the 
Chatti. The original was inscribed on a silver tablet in Babylonian 
script and language, as is now clearly estal)lished, and shows that 
Babylonian was even then, about 100 years after the Amarna period, 
still the international language of diplomacy.^' But it is only the 
Egyptian translation which the Pliaraoh caused to l>e engraved in the 
Temple of Karnak, that has come to us. On this occasion the royal 
scribe added an introduction, according to which the question was of 
a conclusion of peace which the Hittite king had entreated from 
Ramses. As a matter of fact it is Chattusar who draws up the treaty 
nor are there any fixed conditions of peace. The treaty I'ather con- 
tains genera] assurances to al)stain from hostilities against one another, 
probably thus meeting a mutual need, and in addition there is 
the conclusion of a defensive alliance against internal and external 
enemies. The interesting contents of the document justify its pres- 
entation here in nearly complete form after the latest translation.''

In the year 21,'' on the 21st of the winter month (Tyl)i), under the majesty of the 
king of upper and lower Egypt, Ramses II. '' It was on that day that his majesty 
was at the city " liouse of Ramses II," doing what his father A men-Ra'' ajjproves. 
When there came the royal messenger and * * * and the royal messenger 
* * * (before the majesty of the king) Ramses II (with the messenger of Chatti 
Tar) tesob and * * * whom the great prince of Chatti, Chattusar, had sent to 
the Pharaoh to implore jieace of the majesty of the king, Ramses II.

TRANSLATION OF THK ORKilNAI, TABLET.' 

Treaty, which was prepared upon a silver tablet by the great jtrince of Chatti, 
Chattusar,-' the mighty, son of Morsar, the great prince of Chatti, the mighty, grand- 
son of 8apalulu, the great prince of {^^hatti, the mighty, for Ramses II, the great 
King of Egyi')t, the mighty, son of Seti I, the great King of Egypt, the mighty, 
grandson of Ramses I, the great King of Egypt, the mighty,./" the beautiful treaty of 
peace and alliance, which establishes (between them beautiful) peace (and beau- 
tiful alliance) for all eternity. 

UEMEMHRANCE OF FORMER GOOD RELATIONS AND THE NECESSITY OF TREATIES. 

Formerly, in very ancient times — as regards the relation of the great King of 
Egypt witli the great j)rince of Chatti, the god did not allow any enmity to arise 
between them (and this hajipened) through a treaty. But at the time of Mutallu, 
the great prince of Chatti, my brother, he carried on war with (Ramses II) the 
great King of Egypt. Henceforth, however, from to-day on, behold, Chattusar, 
the great prince of Chatti (has caused to be drawn up) a treaty which determines 
the relation of the land of Egypt to the land of Chatti as Ra.'/ created and as 
Sutechr/ created, that no enmity arise between them forever. 

THE ALLIANCE IS CONCLUDED ANEW. 

I'ehold, Chattusar, the great i)rince of Chatti, enters from to-day on into a treaty 
with Ramses II, the great King of Egypt, that it be a beautiful peace and a beau- 
tiful alliance between us in eternity. He is allied with me, he is in peace with me; 
I am allied with him, I am in peace with him forever. 

After ISIutallu, the great prince, my great brother, had followed his unhappy fate,^' 
and Chattusar ' sat upon the throne of his father as the great prince of Chatti — 
behold, I agreed with Ramses II, the great King of Egypt, that we (arrange) our

(?) peace and our (?) alliance. It is better than the peace and the alliance which 
existed before. Behold, (as) I, the great j^rince of Chatti, am in beautiful peace 
and beautiful alliance with Ramses II, the great King of Egypt, so shall the chil- 
dren's children of the great prince of Chatti be in alliance and peace with the 
children's children of Ramses II, the great King of Egypt. They shall be like us 
in a peace and alliance relation, and (the land of) Egypt (be) allied with the land 
of Chatti in peace, as we are, forever. No enmity may arise between them forever. 
The great prince of Chatti may never invade the land of Egypt, in order to rob it 
of anything, and Ramses, the great King of Egypt, may not forever invade the land 
of Chatti in order to roV) it of anything. 

ALLIANCE AGAINST ATTACKS FROM THE OUTSIDE. 

The lawful (?) treaty which was in force at the time of Sapalulu, the great prince 
of Chatti, as also the lawful (?) treaty which was in force at the time of Mutallu," 
the great prince of Chatti, my father, I firmly stand by. Behold, Ramses, too, the 
great King of Egypt, firmly stands by it (we both keep it) together, from to-day on 
we hold it firmly and act after this lawful (?) manner. 

niTTITE AID FOR EGYPT. 

If another enemy '^ goes to war against the lands of Ramses II, the great King of 
Egypt, and the latter writes to the great prince of Chatti: "Come to my assistance 
against him," the great prince of Chatti (will come to his assistance), and the great 
prince of Chatti will kill his enemy. But if the great prince of Chatti should not 
wish to set out himself, he will send his troops and his charioteers, and will slay his 
enemy. 

ASSISTANCE AGAINST EGYPTIAN REBELS. 

Or, if Ramses II, the great King of Egypt, is angry against * * * subjects, 
because (?) they have committed an offense (?) against him and he sets out to kill 
them, the great prince of Chatti will act in common with Ramses II, the Lord of 
Egypt. 

EGYPTIAN ASSISTANCE FOR CHATTI. 

In the same manner the great prince will act if another enemy sets out against the 
lands of the great prince of Chatti, * * * [What follows is mostly destroyed, 
but with corresponding changes it was similar to the alwve.] 

ASSISTANCE AGAINST MITTITK RKBRLS. 

But if subjects of the great prince of Chatti commit an offense against him, * * *

TREATY OF EXTHADITION. 

[The beginning is destroyed.] If nobles flee from Egy{)t and come to the coun- 
tries of the great prince of Chatti, whether from a city (or from a country district [?] ) 
of the countries of Ramses II, the great King of Egypt, and they come to the great 
prince of Chatti, he shall not receive them. The great jirince of Chatti shall cause 
them to be brought back to Ramses II, the great King of Egypt, their lord. 

Or when one or two people who are not prominent (?) flee from the countrv of 
Egypt and come into the Chatti land in order to l)ecome subjects of another, they 
will not be allowed to remain in the Chatti laud, but will he brought l)ack to Ramses, 
the great King of Egypt. 

Or when a noble flees from the Chatti land [continues same as above, with corre- 
sponding changes].

680 THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 

FORM OF OATH. 

Of these words of the treaty of the great prince of Chatti with Ramses, the great 
King of Egypt, written upon a silver tablet, a thousand gods, male and female, of 
the Chatti land, together with a thousand gods, male and female, of those of Egypt, 
are witnesses. * * * 

[Follows a list of the gods who shall watch as witnesses. Adjoining it is read:] 
Whosoever will not keep these words, which are written upon a silver tablet, for the 
land of Chatti and the land of Egypt, the thousand gods of the Chatti land, together 
with the thousand gods of the land of P^gypt, shall punish him, his house, his land, 
and his subjects. But whosoever shall keep the words which are written upon the 
silver tablet and not neglect them, whether of the Hittites or of the Egyptians, the 
thousand gods of the Chatti land, together with the thousand gods of the land of 
Egypt, will preserve him in health and give him life, together with his offspring, his 
country, and his subjects. 

POSTSCRIPT TO THE TREATY OF EXTRADITION — HOW TO RECONCILE WITH IT THE RIGHT 

OF ASYLUM. 

If one, or two, or three people flee from the land of Egypt and come to the great 
prince of Chatti, the great prince of Chatti shall have them seized and returned to 
Ramses, the great King of Egypt. No accusation shall be made against the man 
who is thus brought to Ramses on account of his offense; his house, his wives, or 
children shall not be punished; he shall not be killed, nor shall his eyes, his ears, 
his mouth, or his feet be nuitilated; in short, no charge whatever shall be made 
against him on account of his offense. 

In the same way, if one, or two, or three people have fled from the land of Chatti 
* * * [The same as above, with corresponding changes.] 

DESCRII^ION OF THE SILVER TABLET. 

On the obverse of the tablet is shown a figure of Sutech,« who embraces the figure 
of the great prince of Chatti, surrounded with an inscription which says: "Seal of 
Sutech, the King of Heaven, seal of the treaty which Chattusar, the great prince of 
Chatti, the mighty, son of INIorsar, the great i)rince of Chatti, the mighty, concludes." 
Within the bordering of the sculpture is tlie seal * * * (supply, "of the great 
goddess?' ' ) . 

On the reverse is a sculpture, a figure of * * * (supply, "the great goddess?") 
of Chatti, who embraces the figure of the great princess of Chatti, surrounded with 
an inscription which says: "Seal of the sun god of the city of Arenena, the lord of 
the earth, (and?) seal of Rutuchipa, the princess of the Chatti land, daughter of the 
country of Kizawaden, the (lady?) of the city of Arenena, the lady of the land, the 
worshiper of the god(?)." Within the bordering of the sculpture is the seal of the 
sun god of Arenena, the lord of all lands. 

This treat}' of alliance and extradition is, acoordingl}^ the renewal 
of a former one, one party to which was Sapalulu, the grandfather of 
King- Chattusar. 

Subseqiienth' the Kingdom of Chatti goes rapidly to ruin, parti}' 
through the inrush of a wave of Aramean peoples, partly through the 
advance of new Hittite peoples from the north and northwest, with 
whom, already in 1100 b. c, Tiglath-Pileser 1 came in conflict, 

" By Sutech the Egyptian renders the names of all foreign gods. It is not the 
name of a IJittite god. 



THE ANCIENT H1TTITE8. 687 

although Carchemish (Jerabis) on the Euphrates (west of Carrhar), a 
Chatti state, for a couple of centuries keeps up the appearance of 
independence by the ready payment of tribute to the suzerain of the 
time until in 717 that region also became an Assyrian province. 

Another stratum of the Hittite peoples is met with during- the 
fifteenth century in western Asia Minor in the Lukki, who, according 
to the Tell-Amarna letters, carried on pirac}^ on the southern coast 
of the Peninsula and as far as Cyprus. The provinces of hycia. and 
and Lycaonia are named after them, and we assume that they overran 
the whole of western Asia Minor. 

A couple of centuries later we see new Hittite peoples adv^ance and, 
availing- themselves of a period of weakness of Assyria, settle in 
northern Mesopotamia on the Euphrates. They were the Kummuch, 
who gave their name to the later province of Commagene. Tiglath- 
Pileser I (see above) joins with them in battle in 1100 b. c. on the 
Euphrates and subjugates them, ])ut at the same time on the borders 
of the Kummuch meets other peoples of the same race, the Muski, who 
were not yet permanently settled, but still advancing, and farther ])ack 
he meets the Kaski and Tabal. He repulses them. The Muski very 
probabl}" retreated back of the Hah's and settled there, for in 700 b. c. 
their name is employed as an old historical territorial designation of a 
new kingdom, which was of the same character and extent, but Indo- 
German. King Midas of Phr3-gia is called in the Assyrian inscriptions 
"Mita of Muski.'' The Tabal settle in Cappadocia, the Kaski north 
of it in Armenia Minor. In addition to these are also mentioned the 
Kumani, who occupied the mountains of the province of Melitene and 
have given Comana its name. 

A little later we meet another branch of the Hittite group in the 
Chiiakku as heirs of the Lukki. The Assyrians came across them in 
Cappadocia, though their name remained attached only to Cilicia, the 
country south of the Taurus. 

All the peoples above mentioned maintained for centuries a con- 
stantly changing attitude toward Assyria. Whenever the Assyrian 
armies were far away, or Assyria was weakened through external 
or internal upheavals, they withheld allegiance and stopped pa3'ing 
tribute, but at the approach of the Assyrian armies they immediately 
again sent tribute and declared their submission. Tired of this con- 
stant change, the Assyrians at last embodied a part of these peoples 
as provinces into their empire, Carchemish, in 717 b. c. (see above); 
Tabal. with Chiiakku and Kur (with the capital Tarsus), that is, Cap- 
padocia and Cilicia, under Sargon (7l*'2-7or) b. c); then Konnnanu 
(with Comana) as tiie province of Tulzai inuuu in 712 b. c. 

The last shoots of Hittite state organization are most })i<)l)al)ly to be 
looked for in the Lydian and Cilician Kingdoms. 



688 THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 

Soon after TOO k. c. the Indo-German Kino-doiii of Midas of Phrygia, 
disappeared tlirouoh the shock of the Cynibrian iiimiigration. The 
Lydian G^yg'es, perhaps a lieg'e man of Midas, took advantage of the 
confusion to establish upon the ruins of the Phr^^gian Kingdom, as 
successor to its power, a Ljxlian Kingdom, which again was most 
probabl}^ Hittite. East of it, in Capi)adocia and Cilicia, we see during 
the last years of the Assyrian Empire, from about 660 b. c. down, the 
gradual formation of a new^ Kingdom of Chilakku (= Cilicia, but extend- 
ing much farther north than the later province), which soon after the 
fall of Nineveh, in 606 b. c, appears under S3^ennesis, at the time of 
Nebuchadnezzar, as the fourth great power of the Orient alongside of 
L3Hlia, Media, 5uid Bal)ylonia, and together with Nebuchadnezzar 
mediates, in 585 b. c, the peace l)etween Alyattes of Lydia and 
Kyaxares of Media. Judging from the names of the kings, we should 
also consider this Kingdom of Chilakku as Hittite. It was only the 
conquest of Asia Minor by the Persians under Cyrus that put an end 
to this and to the Lydian Kingdoms, and thus also to the last Hittite 
state formations on a large scale. 

This is the development on tlu* western stage. But we also meet 
Hittite States farther east in Armenia. Shalmaneser I (in 1275 B.C.) and 
Tiglath-Pileser 1 (in 1100 b. v.) came across a series of peoples in the 
mountains of Armenia, west and south of Lake Van, which we must 
consider as Hittites, since the Kummuch (see above) are among them, 
and agreements in the names also support this assumption. At first we 
meet here a series of isolated tribes. From 850 B.C., however, probably 
in consequence of new inunigrations, a great empire is being formed 
around Lake Van, which for two centuries was a dangerous rival of 
Assyria. The Assyrians call it Urartu, the native inscriptions Biaina. 
Its center is the city of Thuspa (modern Van) on the eastern coast of 
Lake Van. In the times of its greatest power it extended from the 
Araxes to Melitene, Syria, and southeast to I^ake Urmia. Its power, 
broken by Sargon, was annihilated through the Iiido-(Termanic innni- 
gration in the seventh century b. c. 

As meager as is our acquaintance with the history of the Hittite 
peoples, so also is our knowledge of their civilization, for accurate 
knowledge results almost exclusively from comprehensive and careful 
excavations. But as regards the territory under consideration, exca- 
vations by the German Orient connnittee have been made only at 
Senjirli, in North Syria, a few days' journey from the Bay of Isken- 
derun. The English have made excavations east of the point men- 
tioned, at Carchemisli (at present Jerabis) on the P^uph rates, and the 
French at Boghazkeu and Ueynek, in the interior of Asia Minor, in 
Cappadocia, while excavations have been made l)}^ the English, Ger- 
mans, and natives in Armenia, on the eastern coast of Lake Van.

u.s have been found either on or near the surface, or may still be seen 
on the roeky walls of Asia Minor. Special mention should l)e made 
of two finds in the ruins of Babylon — a stone bowl and a stone image of 
the Hittite storm god — the latter on the occasion of the present exca- 
vations of the German Orient Society — as also of one in the ruins of 
Nineveh, because they were found at such a distance from the settle- 
ments of the Hittites, and must have come there through contact either 
in war or in peace. At Nineveh there came to light eight small pieces 
of clav on which seals were impressed with Hittite characters, serving 
to verif3^some dociunents or other objects to which they were attached 
by means of cords. 

The sites of the finds of the monuments extend over entire Asia 
Minor as far as Smyrna and over North iiyv'm and Armenia, but are 
most abundant around th(^ Bay of Iskenderun, in Cappadocia, Cilicia, 
and North Syria. Although the number of the products of civiliza- 
tion from all these places 
can not be termed incon- 
sidera])le, and is, more- 
over, increasing with 
each 3'ear, the circum- 
stances mentioned aboAc, 
that they were all discov- 
ered casually on tlie sur- 
face of the earth and that 
the accompanying in- 
scriptions are still unin- 
telligible, makes it, as 
3'et, impossible to assign 
the monuments — w i t h 
the exception of the Ar- 
menian finds — to the single peoples which meet us in history, to fix 
them in time or to construe a history of the development of Hittite civi- 
lization and art. It would also he unwise to represent the undeniably 
existing points of contact with tiie Egyptian and Assyrian art monu- 
ments as loans on the part of the Hittites. A description of the Hittite 
civilization must for a long time ])o limited to the presentation of facts. 

The writing of the Hittites" (see tig. 1) is pictorial script. It 
shows human and animal In^ads: also whole animals, such as hares and 
birds; then hands, feet, and claws, besides a large number of images 
of objects, of which only a few, such as the sword, are as 3'et intelli- 
gible. While on the pi'obahl}' older inscriptions these pictures are 
executed in detail, the more recent ones <'xhihit a transformation of

many of thoiii into simpler, more conventional forms In' merely out- 
lining them. With this is combined another mark of progress. The 
signs of the older inscriptions are cut in relief; whether there are 
exceptions to this custom can not be determined with certainty. 
Those of the more recent are intaglio. This grouping of some inscrip- 
tions as older, others as more recent, can not yet be supported by their 
contents, but is based upon the following peculiarity: A close stud}' 
of the inscriptions shows that the direction faced by the signs (notice 
especially the faces) varies. In figure 1, line 1, the face is turned 
toward the right; in line 2, on the other hand, toward the left. Since, 
according to the process of the Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions and 
the unmistakable indications of the Hittite inscriptions themselves, the 
writing is alwa^'s' to be read in the direction of the faces, it follows 
that line 1 runs from right to left, line 2 from left to right, and line 3 
again from right to left. The inscription terminates with two-thirds 
of line 3, and the fact that the left third, not the right, remains blank 
shows that our arrangement is correct. Within the lines there stand 
several signs below one another which are to be arranged from top to 
bottom. Those inscriptions which by reason of the form of the char- 
acters had been above designated as the older ones, with a few excep- 
tions resulting probal)ly from special circumstances, always begin on 
the right-hand top and strictly maintain this direction throughout. 
On the other hand, in man}^ of the inscriptions which, on account of 
the cursive form of their signs are estimated to be of a later period, 
it can be observtM;l not only that they begin on the left-hand top, but 
also that some signs no longer follow the right direction demanded by 
the course of the lines. This may probaldy be accounted for l)y the 
lack of practice in the use of picture writing, caused by the fact that 
in daily life, as in Assyria and Babylonia, another simpler S3'stem — 
perhaps the Aramaic phonetic writing — was already employed, in 
addition, it should be noted that the later an inscription appears to be 
I)V other indications the more apparent becomes the division of the 
words by definite punctuation marks. There had probably already 
arisen the need of punctuation marks to facilitate the reading and 
arrangement, just as in the case of an Egyptian, who wished to learn 
the cuneiform writing, divided up the words with red lines on the clay 
tablet which he was studying. (See Der alte Orient, vol. i, pt. 2, 2d 
ed., p. 5.) 

There have so far been found about 35 larger inscriptions, and to 
these may be added a great number of inscriptional fragments and of 
short inscriptions on seals, etc. Besides, hardl}^ a year passes without 
new inscriptions coming to light. It can, therefore, be easily imagined 
that the desire to know what these inscriptions contain becomes 
more and more lively. But all efforts to decipher them made since 
18T0, when the inscriptions of this sort for the first time aroused 



THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 



691 



close attention, have been In vain. The cause of faihire is the meager 
t)r indefinite information concerning the Hittites on the part of their 
neighbors or successors, and the puzzling complications of their sys- 
tem of writing. It is approximately estimated that there are already 
known more than 200 signs in their system, and this number is increas- 
ing with each new inscription. As far as can l)c inferred from the 
inscriptions and from other writing systems of western Asia, some 
single signs stand for entire words which in reading are either to be 
pronounced, or are merely explanator}-, to indicate the notional sphere 
into w^hich a preceding or following written-out word l)elongs;" some 
denote a s^dlable, others again merely a sound. The mingling of 
all these signs naturally renders the S3^stem very obscure, since one 
and the same word can be written in an entirely different manner. In 
the uniform writing systems of the Egyptians and Bal)vlonians, 
inscriptions which presented the same content in ditferent parallel 
scripts and languages, one of which was known or easy to make out, 
smoothed the difficulty of decipherment. It is true that we have 
also for the Hittite writing system such an 
example, which naturally has been much 
discussed. It is the bilingual inscription of 
"Tarkudimme'' (fig. 2). But, unfortunately, 
it is too short and presents in itself too many 
riddles to be of any use. The object made 
of silver, in form something like a hollow 
hemisphere, formed the upper part of a dag- 
ger handle and was to serve as a seal. The 
convex surface is engraved with a figure and 
writing. On the edge runs a cuneiform 
inscription reading: "Tarkudimme, King of the country of Erme 
i'i or Me ?)." In the center, to the right and the left of the figure of 
the King, is a Hittite inscription twice repeated. The distribution of 
the content of the cuneiform script over these six signs presents so 
many difticidties that one is compelled to suppose that the Hittite 
inscription either contains only a portion of it or something entirely 
dift'erent. 

The Hittite hieroglyphic writing has bin-onie the parent of a series 
of partly alphal)etical writing systems which in later times meet us on 
the soil of Asia Minor. To these belongs the script used on the isle 
of Cyprus, a syllabic writing, where nearly every sign denotes a 
s3dlable (consonant and vowel). A large number of Greek inscrip- 

f'Such a sign is that for "(lod" — consisting of an oval with a crossbar in it — the 
only one thus far interpreted with certainty without, liowever, knowing how it is to 
be pronounced. The first sign in figure 1 — a head with an arm and the hand point- 
ing to the face — which stands at the cominencemeut of many inscriptions, very 
l)n)hably means "I am," or (N N . . .) "speaks." Uut here, too, the pronuncia- 
tion is unknown.

tions are written in this script. The fact that .such complicated script 
was eiiiph)yed alongside of the (xreek attests to the great predomi- 
nance of pre-Cjrecian civilization in Cyprus. The Lycian, Carian, 
Pamphylian, and other scripts of Asia also trace back, at least in part, 
to the ilittite. 

Although the hierogl3phic inscriptions are thus still unintelligible 
to us, we have some examples of the Hittite dialects in Babylonian 
script. Among the clay tablets of Tell el-Amarna (see Der Alte Orient, 
vol. I, pt. 2) are found a couple of letters in cuneiform writing, but 
in Hittite lang-uage, of the Kings Tushratta, of Mitani, North Meso- 
potamia (ibid., vol. I, pt. 2. 2d ed., p. 1-1), and Tai'chundaral)a, of 
Arsapi or Arzawa (ibid., }>. 5). Clay tablets in the same language 
were found at Boghazkeu, in Cappadocia. The largest number of 
monuments, however, was furnished })v the soil of Armenia. There 
were discovered numerous rock inscriptions, of historical and religious 
content, which in the characters of cuneiform script speak to us in the 
language of the ancient Hittite people. They are usually designated 
alter the capital of this people. Van, as the Van inscriptions. Of this 
language, as also of the Mitani language, which is clearly related to 
it, we already understand something, so that the documents can in 
part be translated. But we do not gain l)y that a clear idea of the 
structure of these languages, nor are we in condition to affirm with 
certaint}' a relationship with other known languages. Still, there 
seems to be these poijits of contact with the languages spoken in the 
Caucasus, especially with the Georgian. 

The personal appearance of the Hittites on their monuments is ver}^ 
peculiar, even if allowance be made for what may be lack of skill in the 
representation. Anthropological investigations, such as measurements 
of the skulls of the present inhabitants of western Asia, in whose midst 
remnants of older races can l)e discerned, have made it probal)le that 
the Hittites, the modern Armenians, and a part of the Jews" belong 
to one and the same race. Their characteristics are strikingly short 
heads (bracychphaly), dark eyes and hair, and large curved noses. The 
latter is most conspicuous on the monuments. The Egyptian repre- 
sentations depict the Hittites with oblong, slightly curved noses, 
strongly receding foreheads, prominent cheek bones, beardless, with 
short, round chins, and with fair skin. The hair is long and thick and 
fails upon the shoulders in two strings. On the Hittite monuments 
only one queue, and that braided, is seen, anci, besides, a large number 
of the men wear beards. The ari-angcMueiit of the hair of the women 
is the same as that of the men. 

« Which is, accordingly, not Semitic by race, though having a Semitic language, 
Race affinity and linguistic affiliation do not coincide. The true Semitic type is, 
according to the same investigations, preserved among the Bedouins in the desert, 
and is characterized as dolichocephalic.

The dress of the men consists chiefly of a coat with short sleeves 
reaching to the middle of the upper arm, closed around the neck, and 
reaching- only to something above the knees, the lower edge being fre- 
quently lined with fringes or a thick border. It is held together, 
around the hips, by a broad belt beneath which there is indicated a 
slit, slantingly running downward. Whether and how the legs were 
clothed can not be definitely determined from the reliefs. In place of 
this short coat there is less frequently found a long one, reaching to 
the feet, likewise Avith short sleeves, closed around the neck and girdled 
about the hips. Sometimes the belt seems to run, in an unexplainable 
wa\', partly under, partly over the coat. This dress is connuon to 
men and women. Witii the latter it seems sometimes to fall down 
underneath the belt in ^ 



perpendicular folds. In 
a few cases it is lined 
with points and fringes. 
Distinguished from it is 
a long cloak which evi- 
dently is worn over 
the short coat described 
above, as it seems, only 
by persons of impor- 
tance — priests or kings. 
It apparently consisted 
of a long piece of cloth 
thrown over one shoul- 
der and drawn around 
the chest so as to form 
a fold for one arm while 
leaving the other free 
and falling down on the 
back. From the repre-

sentations it is supposed 
that this garment was made of artistic textures. The dress of the 
women, descrilx'd above, Avas sometimes supplemented by a.piece of 
cloth thrown over it, which can hardly l)e anything else than a veil. 
It was in some manner fastened to the head gear, falling over it to the 
feet and covering the entire back. The edge of the veil is ornamented 
with fringes. 

The head gear of the men is generally a pointed hat, probably of felt 
or leather and of cone shape. At the lower edge is a rim turned 
upward. Occasionally it is decorated with perpendicular stripes, not 
satisfactorily explained, and sometimes also with circular ornaments. 
A variet}'^ of this pointed hat is one that terminates in the form of 
a ball. Quite peculiar is the head gear of the women, consisting of a 



694 THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 

kind of t\ylinder. While it usually has a rim bent upward and is 
without ornaments, those on the reliefs of Boghazkeu exhibit perpen- 
dicular stripes, are notched at the top and lack the rim. In this form 
it is the starting point for the head gear of later representations of the 
goddess C3d)ele, termed the "mural crown." A head gear common to 
both sexes is a round, closel}' fitting cap, sometimes ornamented with 
perpendicular stripes, horizontal rows of rosettes, or with small 
rosette-shaped settings on the front which perhaps consisted of pre- 
cious stones. In isolated cases there is also found, as head gear for 
men, a cap with a tassel, just like the modern Turkish fez. 

The foot gear of the Ilittites is a shoe with turned-up tips. It is 
found among many mountain inhabitants, as the turned-up point pro- 
tects the toes better than the straight shoe. In several cases the 
figures wear sandals, consisting of a flat piece of leather held by 
thongs under the foot, the heel lacing provided with a cap for better 
protection. 

Few ornaments can be discerned upon the monuments. Wrists 
and ankles are occasionall}' adorned with rings. Earrings frequently 
occur as ornaments also of men. In one case a necklace is seen on a 
woman. Women are usuall}^ represented with a mirror in one band, 
while the other hand holds either an object required by the situation 
portrayed or something resembling a pomegranate or a spindle. The 
men carry a staff as a mark of dignity. The priestly or royal mark 
of special dignity seems to have been the crook, carried with the 
curved end downward. 

The army of the Hittites was composed of foot soldiers and chari- 
oteers, horsemen being of rare occurrence on the reliefs. The foot 
soldiers wear, as far as can be ascertained, a shoi't coat, pointed cap, 
and boots. The chief arms are bows and arrows. By their side are 
also seen a long lance, club, double-edged axe, single and double 
edged sword, and a sickle-shaped sword. The handle of the common 
sword terminates at the upper end in a globular knob. On the native 
monuments no helmet can be recognized. But the Egyptian repre- 
sentations of Hittite nobles and charioteers exhibit a low morion, 
round on the top, with a hair tuft. The shield is either quadrangular 
or of the form of the so-called Pontian Amazon shield, approaching 
the outline of an 8. The war chariot is a low box, open in the rear, 
resting upon two Avheels, and drawn by two horses. On each side is 
a quiver, while the rear part holds the lance. The Egyptians empha- 
size the fact that each Hittite chariot had three warriors — the chari- 
oteer, the shield-bearer, and the bowman, because it differed from 
their own custom. Upon the Hittite representations the shield-bearer 
is lacking. This, however, is accounted for b}' the circumstance that 
they all depict hunting and not war scenes.

THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 695 

The war chariot was also emplo3"ed for the chase. The animals 
hunted are represented as the lion, the deer, and the hare. The lirst 
was chased with dogs. On one of the gate slabs of Senjirli the god 
of the chase is represented with human body and the head of a lion. 
He holds in one hand a hare, in the other a I)oomerang, which, accord- 
ingl}", must have been used in hunting. On each of his shoulders is 
a bird, evidently a falcon, which alread}^ in ancient time was trained 
for the chase. 

This peculiai' god image, a mixture of man and beast, lead.s to a 
consideration of the religion of the Hittites. Here, too, the meager- 
ness and obscurity of tradition, and the failure to decipher the inscrip- 
tions is to be regretted. Only scattered details can, therefore, be 
culled. With which of the Hittite peoples originated the names of 
the gods in Asia Minor which the Greeks transmitted, and whether 
their form is the correct one, can not yet be determined. More relia- 
ble, but scanty, is the information of the cuneiform inscriptions. Some 
knowledge can also be derived from personal names, as in the Orient 
they are frequently composed with the names of gods. The pictorial 
representations also teach us to a certain extent concerning the nature 
of the gods. 

Everj'whei'e in Asia Minor and northern Syria tradition places in 
the foreground the worship of a goddess which is sometimes desig- 
nated as the "great mother." At Komana in Cappadocia she was 
worshiped under the name of Ma. She wears upon the head the 
so-called nuiral crown. Innumerable priests and priestesses served 
her. The latter were called Amazons, and from the Greek legends 
are known as warlike priestesses. The former, who were eunuchs, 
bear the name of Galls, and constitute a peculiarity of Asia Minor 
cult: (Comp. Der alte Orient, vol. iii, part 213, 2d ed., p. 61, note 1.) 
The festivals of the goddess, to which large multitudes are said to 
have flocked, were celel)rated with wild songs and dances accompanied 
by noisy music, the priests on such occasions being thrown into such a 
frenzy as to emasculate themselves. To be sure, this is related of the 
cult of the great goddess at Hieropolis-Bambyke in northern Syria, 
but this is the same goddess, even though she bears another name. 
She is called Semiramis. Her sacred animal is the dove. In this 
connection it is worthy of notice that the name-group of this goddess, 
distinctly recognized in the pictorial inscriptions, though itcannotj'et 
be read, contains the image of a bird. For an understanding of the 
legend of her killing each of her lovers in succession reference may be 
made to the man-hating Ishtar, and the legend of her concealing her 
sex suggests the bearded Venus of classical antiquity. (Der alte Ori- 
ent, Ihid.^ pp. 61 to 63.) Resides this goddess are mentioned Dionysos 
and an unspecitied god who doubtless corresponds to her beloved, 
Adonis-Tamuz (ibid., pp. 61, 62), as yearly a pyre is erected and a 

SM 1903 45 



696 THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 

dirge recited in liis honor. For Lydia we have the names Heracles 
or Sandon and Omphale transmitted, they are the sun and moon gods. 
The former is said to have beeii worshiped also in Cilicia under the 
name of Sandon. The chief act in his cult there is said to have been 
the erecting of a p.yre (see above). In addition to Ma and Semiramis 
the name of Cyl)ele is also found for the "great mother," especially 
in Phrygia. Like Ma she also wears upon her head the mural crown. 
Combined with her is Attis, her beloved, corresponding to Adonis- 
Tamuz;. Rhea, another form of the great mother, was attended by 
the Dactyles or deities considered as the inventors of metallurgy. As 
the moon god worshiped in Asia Minor, the name Men is transmitted 
to us. 

From the cuneiform inscriptions and from the personal names it can 
be concluded that among the western Hittites, the god at the head of 
their pantheon bore the nameTarku, while among the eastern Hittites 
it was the storm god Teshup. Both names, but especially the latter, 
are of comparatively frequent occurrence. Teshup is represented 
(pi. iv), at least on the soil of northern Syria, as a warrior, holding in 
one hand a bundle of three lightning forks, with the other swinging 
the hanuner, the symbol of fertility. (Compare Tor with the hammer 
Mioelnir.) In Cilicia u god Sanda, among others, was worshiped. 
Among the Mitani w^e meet besides Teshup, the goddess Shaushkas, 
corresponding to the Babylonian Ishtar, and perhaps a god Shimigi. 
The so-called Van inscriptions (see p. 692) contain a large number of 
names of gods, but we are little informed concerning the nature of most 
of these deities. The god Teshup was probably received by the people 
of the Van inscriptions from an earlier people belonging, however, to 
the same race, for though he is often mentioned in their inscriptions, 
the first place is held by the god Chaldis, who is scarceh- wanting irvany 
of the incriptions. We also frequently meet with a triad of gods as 
the most important ones, Chaldis and the storm god Teshup or, as he is 
called is this dialect, Teishebas being joined by the sun god Ardis. 
Rarely is the moon god Shelardis mentioned. Concerning the sacri- 
fices to be offered to the gods on various occasions the inscriptions 
contain detailed statements which, however, are not yet fully intelli- 
gible. 

The monuments themselves present a series of religious scenes, the 
most important being found at Boghazkeu — probably the ancient 
Pteria — in Cappadocia. The living rock forms there in one place, in 
a general manner, a rectangular room, without ceiling, one broad- 
side of which, open in its entire wndth, forms the entrance. The stone 
walls in the interior are perpendicular. On these walls a large relig- 
ious scene is sculptured composed of about 70 persons advancing 
one behind the other. Upon the rear wall, facing the entrance, is the 
principal group (pi. ii) forming the center of the whole. Toward

it advance from the left side wall a procession almost exclusively of 
male fig-ures, one behind the other, and in the same manner from the 
right side wall one of female figures. The persons represented on the 
rear wall who stand partly upon mountains, partly upon human iig- 
ures, partly upon animals, are doubtless to be considered as divinities. 
The god at the head of the male procession who stands upon the heads 
of two persons, prol)abl3' priests, and has by his side an animal with a 
pointed cap upon its head* is represented as a warrior. He turns with 
outstretched hand toward a goddess advancing from the opposite 
direction who stands, with a nuiral crown upon her head, upon a pan- 
ther and has likewise by her side an animal with a pointed cap. 
Behind her is a god standing upon a panther, the only male in the 
female procession. We therefore see in him the "beloved" of the 
great goddess. The entire scene has received the most divergent 
interpretations, the most probable of which sees in it a representation 
of the spring myth, though the interpretation does not solve all the 
difficulties. The meeting of the sun god and the moon goddess — for 
this is the likely interpretation of these divinities — each at the head of 
a solemn train, seems to sjmibolize the vernal constellation of sun and 
moon. The male procession on the left side ends with twelve per- 
fectly identical personages who carry sickle-shaped swords and seem 
to advance in a kind of trot. In this may be seen a representation of 
the dancing with arms by the priests which is said to have taken place 
in the festivals of Ma. Many of the figures have in front and al)ove 
their heads groups of hieroglyphics that evidenth^ contain names of 
gods and establish the sculptures as Hittite. 

Upon a rock wall, near the one just described, is found the relief of 
pi. II. The representation, besides being absolutely unique in itself, 
attains a special value from the circumstance that a short explana- 
tion of it is preserved to us from antiquit}^ itself in the description 
of the seal of the chief Hittite god, given at the conclusion of the 
Hittite treaty (see p. 680). Our relief evidently exhibits the same 
representation as that of the seal: The god, represented as a warrior in 
heroic size, embraces a Hittite prince or priest. The name of the god 
is unknown, as the Eg3q3tian has inserted the name of the F^gyptian 
Sutech in place of the Hittite. The agreement of the relief with the 
inscription is important, also, for the reason that it enables an ap])roxi- 
mate dating of the Boghazkeu sculptures, which some would refer as 
far back as 700 b. c. But as this uniijue representation is thus far 
met with only twice, the tendency is to combine both cases of its 
occurrence, i. e., to refer them to about the tiiirtecnth century, the 
time of the Hittite treaty, although it nnist be admitted thattlu; artis- 
tic execution seems to favor a later date. But as we know as yet 
almost nothing of the art development of the Hittites, this circum- 
stance iiRist nofoe given too much importance. 



698 THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 

At Fraktin, in Cappadocia, soiitli of Ci\?sarea, a Hittito sacriticial 
scene is represented upon a rock. To the left stands a god, in the garb 
of a warrior, holding in one hand a crook over his shoulder. Before 
him is an altar, which in its ground form is a pillar, somewhat taper- 
ing upward, with a thick plate placed horizontally over it. Before 
it stands a man, perhaps a priest, in the dress of a warrior, turned 
toward the god and with his right hand pouring a li])ation from a ves- 
sel. To the right is another identical scene, only that here a priestess 
in long dress offers the libation to a seated goddess. Upon the altar 
here a bird is sitting. This is worthy of notice. The type of a seated 
goddess with a mirror or flower in the hands and occasionally a bird 
sitting upon the altar or upon a table l)efore her, meets us often on 
the Hittite sculptures. We ma}' safely recognize in it Semiramis, to 
whom the dove was sacred, or, as she is also named. Ma of Comana, 
etc. At Irviz, on the ])order of Cilicia and Cappadocia, there is seen 
upon a rock in a lovel}' and fertile region a king or priest in adora- 
tion before a god of fertilit}". The god is marked as such b}' having 
in one hand a vine with many clusters, in the other a cornucopia from 
which water is streaming. 

As unique creatures of religious fanc}" ma}' ])e mentioned the sphinxes 
and gryphons. The former are fantastic beings with lion bodies and 
human heads, and generally winged. Upon one relief the sphinx is 
given even two heads, one of a lion in natural position and the other 
of a man placed perpendicularly upon the neck. The gryphon has 
the body of a man, l)ut the head of a vulture, and also has wings. 

The examples of Hittite architecture remain for the most part still 
buried. Only in one place, at Senjirli, North Syria, have extensive 
excavations l)een made, to be described in a future publication, uncover- 
ing the site of an ancient city. The city was surrounded by a double, 
nearly circular, wall protected by towers. Within this large circle 
was the citadel proper, raised upon an elevated site. It was inclosed 
by a second wall, likewise provided with projecting towers, and on 
the south side was a large gate of a characteristic plan, for the wall 
was not merely cut through to efl'ect an opening, l)ut considerably 
thickened at the gate, so that it has two passages, in front and in the 
rear. The space between the passage within the wall on both sides 
is partly unfilled, so that a large quadrangular court is formed. On 
either side of the outer door large towers project. All the walls are 
of extraordinary thickness, even several meters thick, and consist, in 
the lower portion of uncut stones, to keep off moisture, and the 
upper part is of unburnt bricks. Clay is employed as building mate- 
rial through the entire Hither Asia, even where other material is 
available, and the custom dates Ixick to Babylonian influence. The 
inner walls of the gate and palace rooms were faced with stone slabs, 



THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 699 

1 to li meters in height, adorned with reliefs. The edifice in its 
simplest form was oi a quadrangular ground plan with colossal walls 
and had varied chambers. The front showed two large towers, which, 
however, were not an organic part of the building. Between them an 
open vestibule with columns formed the entrance, to which a few 
steps led up. The columns must have been of wood, as nothing 
is left of them excepting the stone bases, which were formed of single 
or pairs of sphinxes, 

A gate very similar to that of Senjirli was found at the village of 
Veynek, in Cappadocia, Part of the large stone slabs used as wall 
dressing, upon which arc representations of sacrificial scenes, as also 
two large sphinxes which flanked the gate passage, are still in place. 
At Boghazkeu, also, numerous wall remnants of an extensive ancient 
city are found. In the northern part of it are still discerned the 
foundation walls of a large palace of quadrangular ground plan, with 
many rooms. The walls are preserved to the height of about a meter, 
and consist, like those of Senjirli, of rough, uncut stones. From this 
circumstance it mav be inferred that here, too, the upper part of the 
wall consisted of unburnt bricks. To the excavations at Jerabis, on 
the Euphrates, on the site of the ancient and oft-mentioned Carchemish, 
we owe our knowledge of the wall slabs with reliefs, which until now 
represent the high-water mark of Hittite artistic development in sculp- 
ture (see pi. ii), in which, however, Ass3a"ian influence is distinctly 
discernible. It shows itself in the position and carriage of the figures 
and in the care applied to the reproduction of ornamental details. 
Worthy of notice is the remarkabl}^ high relief employed in some of 
the Jerabis sculptures. The reliefs, accompanied by inscriptions, 
evidently form the decoration of the entrance to a Hittite palace. 

The subjects of the Hittite sculptors, so far as can be understood, 
are chiefly religious, and have been largely referred to above, but 
special mention may be made of a unique work upon a rock at Boghaz- 
keu. It has a human head with a pointed cap upon it, while the entire 
bod}?^ is composed of four lions. Of two of them only the fore parts 
are represented; the}" form the breast. Their bodies, to the right and 
the left, are turned outward, and appear at a distance like arm 
stumps. The two other lions represented in full are bent with their 
heads downward and turn their Ixicks to the right and the left out- 
ward. Thev represent the bod}" of the figure, Ih place of legs, 
which are not indicated, there are perpendicular straight lines, which 
unite at the bottom. The freciuontly occurring double eagle (fig, 3, 
pi, ii) is also remarkable as a second instance of the composition of fan- 
tastic figures of animals, but especially because it forms a directly 
connecting link between modern times and Hittite antiquity, for the 
Austrian double eagle is borrowed from the latter. It was first 



700 THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 

adopted in the Orient by the Seljuk sultans (in 1217 a. d.). and from 
them descended through the German emperors, its lirst appearance on 
their coat of arms being in 1345. 

Among nonreligious sculptures, tombstones will first be mentioned. 
Fig. 3, page 003, and probably fig. 1, pi. i, are such representations. 
They are stone slabs of human size, provided at the bottom with a stone 
peg to fit into a socket to keep it in an upright position. Upon the 
fore side the dead is invariably represented sitting at a meal, alone or 
with another person. Before him or, in the latter case, between them, 
is seen a table with crossed legs, resembling our camp stools, upon 
which food and drink are set. P'ig. 3 shows two women, each hold- 
ing in one hand a pomegranate (or a spindle?), while in the other hand 
one woman has a mirror, the other woman a bowl which she carries 
to the mouth. Besides these we have the lower parts of two human 
statues, provided with inscriptions. The execution is very stiff and 
shows oidy feeble attempts at reproducing the folds of the drapery. 
Of animals, the lion is most frequently represented. Head and chest 
stand out free from the stone slab, while the body is merely in relief, 
as the work was foi" a gate ornament, and had to be represented with 
one half of the body fitted into the wall. 

Regai'ding th(» character of the Hittite sculptures, that is, those thus 
far known, they nuist l»e considered as rude, childish, and stitf, though 
improvements and cfiorts to enliven the rigurescan not l)e denied. As 
we are not abU^ to read the inscriptions on the sculpture no date can 
be assigned to the work, and we are therefore unable to describe the 
historical development of Hittite art. A conclusion from purely 
artistic view points, considering the manifold circumstances which 
influence civilized life, would easily lead astray. Thus sculptures 
found in two difierent places, some of which may be very rude, while 
others point to a considerably higher degree of art, may belong to the 
same period. The explanation of this would be that the former dec- 
orated the palace of a petty unimportant prince without the means to 
engage the best artists of his time, while the latter come from a con- 
temporaneous, but powerful and rich ruler. Only when productions 
of difierent art degrees are found in the same place is a chronological 
arrangement of them to a certain extent justified. This is the case at 
Senjirli. Here were found at the southern gate of the city wall sculp- 
tures which are certainly older than those of the southern gate of the 
citadel wall. But the material is too meager for establishing a develop- 
ment in detail. 

Most of the sculptures are executed in low relief. In the crudest 
the representation is a simple outline, within which muscles, drapery 
folds, and other details are merely indicated by awkwardly incised 
lines, so that the legs or wings of animals sometimes appear as merely 
mechanically attached to the body. This line drawing betrays metal 



THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 701 

work as the starting- point of stone sculpture, for figures in metal are 
driven from the back of the plate to the front, and the muscles and 
other details are then indicated by reversing the process in the respec- 
tive parts of the metal. The writing of the Ilittites also indicates such 
origin for their art, the oldest inscriptions showing the characters cut 
in relief, which is much more difficult than intaglio work to produce 
in stone. 

The primitive sculptures also show an utter lack of proportion. 
The lower part of the human body is usually much too small in pro- 
portion to the upper part, or the arms are two thin and too short. 
Animal bodies are either excessively drawn out or are shortened. But 
while these faults are less evident in the better sculptures, there is 
common to all an almost entire absence of perspective. Of objects 
with some depth only the fore side is represented. Thus in fig. 3 and 
pi. I, table and chairs seem to have only two legs each, and the plate 
of the former is merely a line. The toes on the feet of human figures 
and the claws of lions are generally piled one upon another instead of 
being entirel}^ or partly spread out, while the old artist always has 
endeavored to show as much as possible. In pi. iv the chest of the 
god who advances to the right is completely turned about so that it 
appears in a front view. Both shoulders, besides being- too much 
drawn up, are not shortened. The artist evidently desired to bring 
the emblems of the god into clear view, but was not equal to the task 
of com])ining it with a natural attitude of the body; and he probabl}' 
also hesitated about hiding the face b}^ the arm and hammer. The 
existence of such a principle among artists of western Asia is evi- 
denced by numerous Assyrian reliefs, upon which the bow and liow- 
string are simply omitted when they would cover the face or chest. 
The unnatural position of the arm of the god or goddess (pi. i) is 
probabl}^ to be explained in the same way. In order that the vessel 
might not obscure the drapery, evidently executed with much care, 
the artist extended the arm far to the front. Upon a relief at Ueynek, 
which depicts a person ascending a ladder, the ladder is represented 
with a front view, but the person with a side view, so that he seems to 
cVun]) upon the cross beam of the ladder. On this as on other sculp- 
tures the artist tries to do justice to the laws of perspective b}" short- 
ening the figures in the background, but does not maintain a propor- 
tion as regards their Ineadth or in relation to the other figures. Thus 
on a relief from ^larash a warrior is consideraljl}' larger than the horse 
which he leads b}' the bridle. Frequently also rear figures are placed 
on the same level as front ones, giving the appearance of adults and 
children, although judging from the above characteristic this is not at 
all intended. Where several rows of figures ranged one behind the 
other are to be represented, as upon the Marash relief mentioned 
above, they are placed, as on steps, one above the other, because the 



*r02 THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 

artist could not conceive and reproduce a picture in its entirety, but 
could only take each group separately in yiew. 

The attitude of the body is conyentional. The personages are rep- 
resented as walking by placing one foot in front of the other. One arm 
is extended to hold or carrj^ a stafi', a yessel, or an ornament and simi- 
lar objects, the other is bent at a right angle and placed against the 
chest. There seems to be no attempt at indiyidualizing. Even where 
several personages or animals appear, each tigure, almost without 
exception, is moving in the same attitude as the other. The e3^e is 
always drawn with a front view and is generally too large. Profile 
represetitation is the rule. The only example of drawing with front 
view is upon a relief found at Carchemish representing a winged 
goddess, which is certainly due to Babylonian influence, as the goddess 
Ishtar very often appears in that attitude on seal cylinders of that 
country. The lifeless monotony of Hittite art is enhanced where 
only a single personage is represented, which is mostly the case. 
The cooperation of several personages on the same tasks is seldom 
observed, even where a larger sculpture series is found. For even 
here each figure generally seems to be so little influenced by the action 
of its neighbors that its absence would not be missed. Battle scenes 
are until now entirely wanting. On the other hand we have the rep- 
resentation of a lion hunt, accompanied l)v a Hittite inscription, which 
belongs to the better productions of this art. Upon a war chariot, 
supposed to be drawn by two horses, although only one is sketched, 
while the other must be imagined as covered by it, there stands by 
the side of the charioteer a bowman in the act of shooting an arrow at 
a fleeing lion. The lion, already hit by an arrow and infuriated by it, 
rears high upon his hind legs and with terrific roaring turns the upper 
bod}', with raised fore claws, toward the bowman. Under the horse a 
dog is represented in a rapid run. A very similar representation of a 
deer chase, evidently coming from the same place, has recently been 
discovered. 

As regards technology the Hittites seem to have been quite skillful 
in working metals. The mountains l)etween Cilicia and Cappadocia 
are rich in silver, and silver mines were found which must have been 
worked in very ancient times. And, indeed, among the few remnants 
of Hittite industry that have come to us there are several objects of 
silver such as the sword knob in figure 2 and some seals. In one of 
them, artisticall}^ executed, the several parts are held together with 
silver alloy. The Hittite treaty, described on a previous page, was 
engraved upon a silver tablet. Bronze works have been discovered 
in the excavations on the soil of the Kingdom of Van. One of these 
is a bronze votive shield, upon which rows of walking lions and bulls 
in repousse arc represented in concentric circles around the center of 



THE ANCIENT HITTITES. 703 

the shield. Besides there were found arm rings, belt buckles, parts 
of artistic thrones and statues of bronze. The statues and animal 
figures had been covered with very thin gold plate and set with gems, 
the gold plates being fastened to the bronzes by narrow^ lient edges 
sunk into cuts in the bronze. 

The excavations in Van brought to light a unique floor mosaic com 
posed of black, white, and red stones combined with bronze. Around 
a bronze rosette the colored stones are grouped in eoncentric rings. 
Other floures of the same material are worked into rhombic forms.

The Mayan tribes of Yucatan, Chiapas, Guatemala, and western 
Honduras had reached at the time of the *■' discover}^" the highest stage 
of native culture found in North America, except possibly in political 
organization, in which the ancient Mexicans, or Aztecs, excelled. 
This advance is shown by their architecture, as seen in the ruins of 
stately stone structures found throug-hout the region indicated, by 
their sculptures in stone and wood, by their complicated calendar 
system, b}- their arithmetical computations, and, above all, by the 
near approach they seem to have made to alphabetic writing, their 
system falling apparentl}^ Imt a step behind that of the ancient 
Eg3"ptians. They engraved their peculiar hieroglyphic characters on 
stone tablets, on great sculptured monoliths, and on the walls and 
lintels of their buildings, painted them on plastered surfaces and 
on pottery, and wrote them in books. As most of these glyphs have 
rounded outlines, early authors imagined they resembled somewhat a 
section of a pebble, and the term ''calculiform characters" — from the 
Latin calculus, "a pebble" — was for a time applied to them; but this 
is no longer in use, the term "hieroglyph," or simpl}" "glyph," 
having replaced it. Where inscribed on stone or wood (for they are 
carved on both, but chiefly on the former) the}^ are made to stand out 
in low relief, as may be seen in plate i; but occasionallv they were 
scratched or incised on shells and pottery, in which cases the glyphs are 
generally quite rude. 

Inscriptions composed of these peculiar hieroglyphs have been 
found in the ruins of temples and of other structures in the States 
of Chiapas and Yucatan, Mexico, and in Guatemala and w^estern 
Honduras. They are found in ditl'erent situations, some of them on 
stone slabs set in the inner side of the walls of the temples, one of 
which, from Palenque, Chiapas, is among the collections of the Smith- 
sonion Institution. A very extensive inscription is on the inside wall 
of the structure at Palenque, named by Stephens the "Temple of 
Inscriptions." At Copan, in western Honduras, and at Quirigua, in 
eastern Guatemala, the more important ones are on the sides and 
backs of the great stone statues which stood, and, in part, are yet 
standing, in what the native priests considered sacred precincts. The 

705 



700 CENTEAL AMERICAN HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING. 

lintels of the temple doors and, in a few instances, even the steps lead- 
ing- up to those edifices were utilized for this purpose. Casts and 
excellent photographs of most of these inscriptions have been made, 
thus bring-ing- them in reach of students for investigation and study. 
Most of the ruins are found covered with a heavy forest growth, which 
has to be removed before exploration can be carried on. The present 
condition of one of the ruins at Chichen Itza, in Yucatan, named by 
Prof. W. H. Holmes the "Temple of Tables," is shown in plate ii, 
where the growth has been partially removed. 

The glyphs of the inscriptions, which were carved so as to stand out 
in low relief, are, as seen in plate i, somewhat square in outline, vary- 
ing from 3i to 4^ or 5 inches square. Each of these squares, which 
are as a rule in straight columns or lines, constitutes a hieroglyph or 
glyph, l)ut they are usually composed of several elements or parts. 
This characteristic, which can not be easily explained in words, will be 
readily understood by reference to plate i. Some of these elements, 
as will be observed, consist of lines and dots, mostly at the left side 
or on the top of the gl3'phs. These are of special importance and will 
receive further notice. Some of the glyphs consist chiefly of an oval 
figure surrounded by a rim, as in the Egyptian cartouch. These 
inclosed characters, with prolmbly a single exception, are symbols of 
Maya days. It is by means of these day symbols and the month 
syml)ols, which are also given in the inscriptions, that students ascer- 
tain that Maya people were the authors. Diego do Landa, a Spanish 
l)ishop, wdio wont to Yucatan as a missionary in 1540, when persons 
were still living w^ho could read the symbolic writing of the codices, 
has preserved in his work (Do las Cosas do Yucatan) the forms of 
these symbols, each with its proper name attached, and this is the 
initial point of later investigations. As these names are those of the 
Ma3'an da3\s and months, and the ruins are in the regions inhabited, 
so far as known, only by Mayan tribes, the remains as well as the 
inscriptions are attributed to these tribes. 

However, Maya scribes were iiot limited in their symbolic or hiero- 
glj^phic writing to stone or wood, but wrote or painted their characters 
in manuscripts. Four examples of these manuscripts, or codices, as 
they are usually termed, remain. These are the Codex Troanus and 
Codex Cortesianus, thought by some authors to be part;- of the same 
book, which are at Madrid; the Codex Peresianus, whicn is in Paris, 
and the Codex Dresdonsis, the most important of the Sf 'ies, which is 
in the Royal Liljrary at Dresden. 

The first two strongly resemble each other, and were probably 
written in Yucatan, as they follow the calendar systeri of that region. 
The Codex Peresianus differs in some respects froia all the others. 
The Dresden codex, which is of chief importance in studying the

CENTRAL AMERICAN HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING. 707 

written glyphs, agrees closely with the temple inscription in essential 
points, and was probably written in Chiapas or Guatemala. 

These manuscripts are on a kind of paper made of the Mag-ue}- plant. 
A description of one is substantially a description of all, though the 
size and the number of pages yary. The Troano codex, which will be 
taken as an example, consists of a strip of mague}^ paper about li feet 
long and 9 inches wide, both surfaces of which were first coyered with a 
white paint or varnish. The two faces were then divided into spaces 
about six inches wide by black or red lines across the strip, in which 
spaces the characters and figures, in black, brown, red, and sometimes 
blue, were painted.- The strip was then folded back and forth, like a 
pocket map, into 35 folds corresponding with the cross lines, repre- 
senting, when pressed together, the appearance of an ordinary octavo 
volume. The glj^phs and figures cover both sides of the paper, form- 
ing 70 pages, the writing and painting having been done apparently 
after the folding, as the folds do not interfere with it. A page is 
shown in facsimile in plate iii. 

The order in which this writing — if it may properly be so termed — 
is to be read was for many years a subject of discussion, some authors 
contending for one direction, as from left to right, or from the top 
downward, while some thought that the reading should be in the oppo- 
site direction. The proper order in which the inscriptions and the 
text, in part, of the manuscripts is to be read was first pointed out 
l»y the writer in 1882.« 

In the inscriptions, which usually consists of two, four, or six col- 
umns, the columns are to be taken by twos or pairs from left to right, 
and the gl.yp^** i'^ <'^t'ti P^ii' of columns are to be read from left to right 
and from top to bottom, in the order of the letters in the diagram 
(fig. 1). Where there is a single column the 
reading is from the top downward, and in sin- 
gle horizontal lines it is from left to right. 
The order in which the glyphs in the codices are 
to be taken, where there is a regular arrange- 
ment, is substantially the same. Although the 
columns ma}^ consist of but two lines in depth 
they are read in the order a^ b, c, d in the dia- 
gram, at least in the Dresden, Troano, and Cortesian codices. In 
the Dresden codex, however, the numeral and time series, some of 
which are quite long, aro in some cases to be read from right to left 
by lines across the page, the lines following one another from the 
bottom upward. Usually there are in tlic inscriptions, besides the 
glyphs, figures of priests and deities, and s3Mnbolic representations. 
A considerable portion of almost every page in the codices consists of

pictographic representations such as are seen in the spaces below the 

text or lines of glyphs in plate iii. 

An important class of characters consists of those which as is now 

known denote numbers. These are of two quite distinct t3'pes; one, 

which is the usual form, found in both the inscriptions and the codices, 

but more abundantly in the 
latter, consists chiefl}^ of

refer almost exclusively to the numbers given to the days, as explained 
on a subsequent page. This is one instance, at least, in which color

has special significance in these native manuscripts and suggests the 
probability that the different colors of the dots used to denote num- 
bers in the Aztec codices in the time counts have a specific meaning, 
though this has not as yet been determined. 

The number 20 is represented by several different forms, as shown 
in tig. 2. Those marked «, J, e, d., and ," are found only in the codices; 
those marked/*, (/, 7i, and / occur chiefly in the inscriptions and are 
attached to the left side of the glyphs. Naught (0) is also represented 
in the inscriptions ^^y characters numbered 1 to 10 in tig, 3, those num- 
bered 1 to 8 being placed at the left side or on top of the glyph when 
used. Numbers 9 and 10 of the figure are used chiefly in double-face 
characters, as those seen in fig. 6. Number 11 of fig. 8 shows the 
characters for naught (0) used in the Dresden codex. The use of these 
S3^mbols for naught is interesting, as it manifests a very strict adher- 
ence to mathematical steps in the representation of numbers, no blanks 
being allowed. 

The Ma3^a scribes were capable of carrying their numeration to a 
high number, and this they did in the codices, not with new or diflerent 
symbols from those mentioned, but by relative position, on the same 
principle that we denote higher numbers than the Arabic digits l\y the 
position of these digits. Thus we increase the value of a number ten- 
fold in our decimal system at each step to the left, while in the vigesi- 
mal system, used by the Maya scribes, the numbers increased twenty- 
fold at each step, to indicate which they placed their digits, if we may 
so call them, in a column increasing from the bottom upward, so that 
a line and dot, mentioned above as denoting 6 if placed at the bottom, 
as seen in the margin of the page, would denote *>, 
but if placed one step upward would denote 120, or 
6 by 20, and one step higher would, according to 
their regular vigesimal system, be equal to 2,-tOO, or 
6 by 20 by 20, but in their time counts, which are 
the only numeral series in the third place, or third order of units, 
would be 6 by 20 by 18, making 2,160. The other steps upward 
increase uniformly twentyfold. As they rise as 
high as the sixth step the value of the unit in the 
several steps or orders of units would be as shown 
in the colunm at the margin. As the da}' was the 
primary unit, a single dot in the sixth step or 
order would denote 2,880,000 days. A single 
dot in the fifth order would denote 144,000 days, 
and two dots in that place would denote twice that amount; three dots, 
three times that amount, and so on up to 19. This applies to each of 
these orders, except that in the second, where 18 is the multiplier. 
The highest number that can be inserted is 17. They are the same in

and pence — the highest number given in the pence place is 11, as 12 
would be 1 shilling; and 19 the highest number to be given in the 
shilling place, as 20 would be £1. These series, or units of the various 
orders, can be reduced to the lowest denomination — which is days — in 
file same way that pounds, shillings, and pence are reduced to pence. 
Some of the numeral series in the Dresden codex amount when 
reduced to over 12,000,000 days. 

As an example of their use of large numbers, one numeral series 
from plate lxix of the Dresden codex is presented here, the num- 
bers indicated by the numeral characters being placed at the left in 
parentheses and the equivalents in days at the right. The names 
placed at the extreme left (great cj^cle, cycle, etc.) are those adopted 
by Mr, Goodman for the respective orders: 

Days, 
(great cycles) (4) . . . . equal 11,520,000 

\ (cycles) (5) equal 720,000 

% (katuns) (19) .... equal 136,800 



( ahaus ) (13) _^^^_j_ equal 4, 680 

(chueus) (12) . . equal 240 

(days) (8) ... equal 8 



Total 12,381,728 

That is to sa}", i great C3'cles (or 1 units of the sixth order or posi- 
tion) equal 11,520,00(1 days; 5 cycles (or 5 units of the fifth order) 
equal 720,000 days; 19 katuns (or 19 units of the fourth order) equal 
136,000 days; 13 ahaus (or units of the third order) equal 4,680 days, 
and so on. 

The total amount expressed by this series is over 12,000,000 days. 
This is a large number to be handled by a pre-Columbian native, yet 
it can be demonstrated by actual count that the Maya scribe used this 
number correctly in a calculation. 

Writers of the present day have adopted the simple method of 
expressing these numeral series thus (using the a))ove example), posi- 
tion indicating the orders of units 4-5-19-13-12-8, ascending toward 
the left just as we may express £i, 12 shillings, and 6 pence, thus — 
4-12-6. 

A knowledge of the Maya numeral system and method of counting 
and expressing numbers, as given above, is absolutely necessary in the 
attempt to decipher the glyphs. It is also necessary to give here a 
brief notice of the Maya calendar, as a knowledge thereof is another 
requisite in deciphering. The process with the Maya glyphs, so far 
as it has been carried, is wholly different from the method pursued in 
deciphering P^gyptian hierogl3'phs and the cuneiform inscriptions of 
Assyria. There the phonetic value of the characters being ascertained, 
the combinations to form words can be followed and tested b}^ the

result. In the Maya, with the few exceptions which will be mentioned 
later, the glyphs, so far as determined, are to a large extent s3^mbols 
(not phonetic characters), used to denote numbers, days, months, etc. 
Hence the only means so far discovered by which to test an interpre- 
tation is the demonstrable relation of one character to another, thus: 
Having a vsymbol known to be that of Monday, another to be that for 
7, another to be that for the month of March, and another for the 
number 120, and linding them placed in an inscription in the order: 
Monday, March 7, 120, and this followed b}' two imperfect or unknown 

characters and 5, thus ? ? 5, and having ascertained that the 

intermediate numbers, as the 120 in this case, indicate the number of

days from the tirst date to a second, we count 120 days from Monday, 
March 7, which brings us to Tuesday, eTuly 5. This gives us Tuesday 
and July as the two unknown or doubtful characters of the terminal 
date. Just as it is necessary, in the example given, to understand, in 
part at least, our Gregorian calendar, so is it necessary to understand 
the Maya calendar in attempting to decipher the Maya hieroglyphs. 

The Maya years consisted uniformly of 365 days, no reference to or 
evidence of bissextile years (corresponding to our leap year) having 
been found in the codices or inscriptions. The}' were divided uni- 
formly into 18 months of 20 days each, and a supplemental month of 
5 days following the 18th. Each of these months had a name and a

symbol as shown in fig. 4. They alwa3\s followed one another in the 
same order, the year uniformly beginning- with Pop. The 20 days 
were also named, each haying its appropriate s3mibol as shown in fig. 
5. The order in which they followed one another was uniform, though 
the year did not always begin w^ith the same da}^, the 5 in the supple- 
mental month carrying the count forward 5 days each year. Although 
the days had their month numbers, as 1, 2, etc., to 20, as we say the

fifth, sixth, and seventh day of the month, there was another number- 
ing which applied to the days only. This, howeyer, was from 1 to 13, 
beginning again with the unit. These numbers were prefixed to the 
days and followed in regular succession, no day being without its num- 
ber. It follows from this method that a day bearing both the same 
name and the .same number will not recur until 13 months have passed. 
This gives a cycle or period of 260 days, which appears to have been 



CENTRAL AMEEICAN HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING. 718 

more in use as a ceremonial or religious period, both amono- the Mayas 
and Mexicans, than the secular year of 365 days. 

The order of the daj^s and their numbering- passed on from month 
to month and from year to year without a break or change in the reg- 
ular succession. There is one series of 312 years in length in the 
Dresden codex, in which there is not a break in the succession, nor 
an indication of a bisextile j^ear. In the series given above, also 
from the Dresden codex, which covers 34,059 years, 1> months, and 13 
days, the date of the commencement and of the ending being given, 
which calculation shows to be correct, this is evidence that there can 
be no break or change in the succession of days, day numbers, or 
months. In this regularit}^ of succession lies the possibility of deter- 
mining the time series of the inscriptions and the codices. 

In order to show what advance has been made in deciphering this 
ancient American writing, it is necessar}^ to present examples from 
the codices and inscriptions that the reader may have the glyphs 
referred to before him, for words alone can not describe them so as 
to be understood. Beginning with the inscriptions, which appear to 
be older than the codices, attention is called to plate i, showing the 
inscription on the Palenque tablet in the Smithsonian Institution, As 
a means of identifying the individual glyphs, a letter is placed over 
each column and a number at the side opposite each line, as in refer- 
ence maps, R, S, T, U, V, W, X have been selected because they 
are the letters used for these particular columns in Doctor Rau's 
scheme." 

The column R being separated from the others, and a single col- 
unni, it must be read from the top downward. Passing by this, 
attention is called to the other six, which are to be read two and two, 
beginning with the two at the left, going from the top downward, 
taking the glyphs alternately in the left of the two columns and then 
in the right, thus: First glyph, S 1 then T 1; next, S 2, T 2; then S 3 
and T 3, and so on to the bottom. Then columns U and V are to be 
taken in the same order, and after these columns W and X. As it 
would require a somewhat extended stud}^ of the subject to follow 
out understandingly a complete explanation of the steps in the process 
of decipherment, an outline only of what has been accomplished in 
this direction can be given. 

Reading down columns S and T in this manner, the first glyph 
which has been determined, or rather could be determined if unin- 
jured, is T 2 (or the second in the T column), which, from the sur- 
rounding border or band and the number attached is known to be the 
symbol of a day, but on account of the imperfect markings or weath- 
ering of the face, is not indentifiable with certainty. Here, however, 
is an instance where a knowledge of the Maya calendar system 

« Palenque Tablet, in Sm. Cont. Knowl., vol. xxii, p. 6L 



714 CENTRAL AMERICAN HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING. 

becomes important, as it enables us to limit the investigation to one 
of four out of twent}^ days. As the next glyph which follows — that 
is, S 3 (or the third in the S column) — is the symbol for the month 
Pop (see lig. -i), the first month of the Maya year, and has attached 
to the left the symbol for 20 (similar to that shown at / fig. 2), it is 
evident that the da}" at T 2 is the 20th day of the month. As there 
are but four days (Ik, Manik, Eb, Caban — see fig. 4) in the calendar 
system used in the inscriptions that can fall on the 20th, it is evident 
that it must be one of these. The reader will observe by inspecting 
this glyph in the figure that there are two short perpendicular lines 
and a dot at the left; these denote that it is the day 11 — ^ 

Passing on to S 10, T 10, we find another date, the glyph S 10, 
being the symbol for the day'^ 11 Lamat, and glyph T 10, the svmbol 
for the month Xul with the numeral character for 6 at the left. For 
the days mentioned reference can be made to fig. 5 and for the months 
to fig. 4. However, for the illustration the names of the days and the 
months are not essential, but are added here to avoid using blanks. 
It will be observed that above and below the little dot in the numeral 
characters at the side of each of these glyphs is a little semicircle or 
crescent. These, which might be mistaken for number dats, have no 
significance, but are used to fill out the space or to guard the dot. 

To be able to say that certain gh'phs denote days, others months, 
and others numbers is one step in the process of decipherment, but 
the step is a comparatively short one unless their relation to one 
another and the object of their introduction into the inscription can be 
ascertained. This relation has been determined in part through inter- 
mediate number series. For example, by passing on to glyphs S 12 
and T 12, we find the number series 9 days, 3 chuens (or units of the 
second order), and 13 ahaus (or units of the third order) — or 13-3-9 — 
which, reduced to the lowest denomination, gives 4,749 days. Count- 
ing this number of days, according to the Mayan calendar, from 13 
Lamat, G Xul, the date given in S 10, T 10, and mentioned above, we 
reach the date 2 Caban, 10 Xul, which is the date given two lines 
below at S 14 and T 14, That is to say, the number in the numeral 
series is the exact time included between the immediately preceding 
and the immediately following date. This is proof positive that there 
is a connection between the date at S 10 and T 10 and that at S 14, 
T 14. Nor does the connection series end here. Glyph S 15 is a 
short-number series of 123 days which connects the date 2 Caban, 10 
Xul, of glyphs S 14, T 14, with the date 1 Ahau,-3 Zip of glyphs T 
17 and U 1; or, omitting names, it connects the last preceding with 
the next following date. 

Dropping from consideration the names of the days and months, 
introduced to avoid blanks or explanatory phrases, the important fact 



CENTRAL AMERICAN HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING. 



715 



remains that tliere is a connection between date glyphs that stand some 
distance apart. 

It has been stated above that the Maya writing- included two types 
of numeral characters. One of these, consisting of dots and short 
lines and the use of position, has been explained. The other type con- 
sisted of face characters, some of which are shown in fig. 6. In order

to show how these are used, attention is called to fig. 7, which repre- 
sents part of the inscription on the east side of Stela (or statue) F, at 
Quirigua, Guatemala, as designated by Mr. Maudslay, from whose 
great work (Biologia Centrali- Americana, "Archseology "), part xii, 
pi. 40, our figure is taken.

As seen in this illustration (lig. 7), there is at the top or beginning a 
large quadruple glj" ph, below which follow, in the order of the num- 
bers 1, 2, 3, -i, 5, and 6 at the sides, (six double glyphs, each composed 

of two faces. There are other

double-face glyphs below, but the 
six will suffice for illustration. 
Omitting from present consider- 
ation the large character at the 
top, attention is directed to these 
six gl3"phs, from which we may 
learn something of the mistakes 
made in the attempts at decipher- 
ment. A little more than a dec- 
ade ago there was almost uniAcr- 
sal agreement among students .of 
the Maya hieroglyphs that these 
face characters, especially those 
in commencing series, as shown 
in fig. 7, were symbols of deities. 
Subsequent investigation, how- 
ever, has shorn them of their 
sacred character and reduced 
them to mere svml)ols represent- 
ing numbers. The left face of 
each of these six double glyphs 
is one of the smaller numbers (1 
to li>), which we have designated 
"Mayan digits;"" for instance, the 
left face in glyph number 1 de- 
notes 1>; that in glyph 2 stands 
for 16; that in ?> for 10; that in 
4 for (naught), and that in 5 
also stands for (naught). These 
are the numbers prefixed respec- 
tively to the syml)ols of the orders 
of units in the inscription repre- 
sented. The right face of num- 
ber 1 denotes the cycle or fifth 
order of units; adding the prefix 
9, the double glyph will signify 9 
cycles or 9 units of the fifth order. 
The right face of glyph 2 is the 
katun or fourth order of units; that of 3 the ahau or third order of 
units, etc. Glyph (3 is the day (1 Ahau) and glyph 12 the month 
(3 Zip), forming together the terminal date of the series.

CENTRAL AMERICAN HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING. 71 7 

Briefly stated, this series (fig. 7) and all those of like character are 
made up of niinibers and dates, and not of deities, as was formerly 
supposed. 

The differences in these face characters, by which their respective 
values are determined, have not in every instance been so clearl}" 
ascertained that they can be determined l)y inspection alone. In the 
left face of glyph 1 the circle of dots on the cheek forms the distin- 
guishing characteristic for 9, but peculiar markings of others are less 
distinct. The face characters representing the orders of units, as the 
cycle, katun, etc., can be determined by position alone. 

The great quadruple glyph at the top is the symbol for the sixth 
order of units (Goodman's ''great C3ade''*'), which seems to have repre- 
sented the limit of Mayan time counts, although according to Doctor 
Brinton their numeration in the regular Maya num))er S3^stem was 
carried a step higher; and Goodman intimates that their time counts 
reached an additional step in the scale, amounting at the extreme to 
280,800 years or 102,492,000 days. This large so-called "great cycle 
symbol," with the number characters and the immediately following 
date, form what Maudslay has termed an "initial series," as the large 
glyph is never found except at the commencement of an inscription. 

The month symbol which helps to make up the date in this instance 
is somewhat distant from the day symbol, five compound glyphs inter- 
vening; nevertheless thei'e is numerical evidence that the two are con- 
nected and that the date is part of the "initial series." Tiiere is also 
evidence that the initial series in the inscriptions at Copan, Quirigua, 
and some other localities where the numlier of cycles is 9, as in this 
case, start with the same date (4 Ahau 8 Cumhu), this date being 
apparently the beginning of an era wnth the priests and scribes of 
those sections. As this is but one instance of a number where the 
count in these initial series gives the proper terminal date in the 
inscription, the proof that thej' have been correctly interpreted seems 
to be complete. This conclusion necessarily carries with it the accept- 
ance of the interpretation given the glyphs and also the calendar sys- 
tem as above explained, though the native priests appear to have pur- 
posely used characters which would be understood only by their own 
class. 

The codices, as will be seen b}" referring to plate in, which is a 
facsimile of three of the four divisions of plate xxix of the Codex 
Troano, contain a much larger proportion of pictographic representa- 
tion than the inscriptions. Besides the pictures there are two classes 
of hieroglyphs; first, the ordinary numerals repl'esented by dots and 
short lines, which arc of two colors, black and red. The latter, which 
do not exceed 13 in value, are the numbers attached to or belonging to 
the days — the day, where the symbol is omitted, as in the lines of the 
alternate black and red numerals in this instance, being understood. 



718 CENTRAL AMERICAN HIEROGLYPHIC WRITINC4. 

The column at the left side of the lowest division consists of the symbols 
of 5 days, which form the basis from which the count by the ])lack and 
red numerals is made. The day columns for the two upper divisions 
are in a preceding- plate, the line of numerals running- through more 
than one plate. 

The two lines of black g'l.yphs running across the upper part of each 
division forms what may be termed the "text." These are read in this 
instance by groups of four, considering them two short columns, as 
those over the bird and personage in blue at the left side of the middle 
division, the order being the same as «, 5, <?, d in the diagram, fig. 1. 
But little progress has as yet been made in deciphering this so-called 
"text." 

So far as the writer is aware, but three characters of the text of this 
plate have been determined save in the manner mentioned below. 
These are the symbols of three of the cardinal points, and are the first, 
third, and fifth glyphs in the upper line of the upper division, counting 
across from the left. 

That the text in most instances contains reference to the figures 
below is quite evident. This is shown in plate iii by the fact that some 
feature of the pictures is represented by one of the four glyphs which 
stand above it, as in the middle section the bird's head forms one of 
the glyphs over the figure in which the bird appears; and likewise 
the dog-like animal and worm in the same division are represented in 
the glyphs of the text above. These would therefore seem to be 
simple abbreviated pictographs or conventionalized figures and not in 
any sense phonetic characters. In the lower division of the same figure 
the three persons to the right are holding in their hands something like 
the symbol for the day Ik (fig. 5) (which signifies ' ' wind " in the Maj^a 
language); the same symbol appears in the text above the head of each, 
but its signification in these places is unknown. We may surmise if 
we like, but the proof is wanting. 

As the glyphs in the middle division of the figure, on which the per- 
sons and other forms are sitting, appear to represent something out of 
which plants can grow and has the elements of the symbol of the day 
Caban (see fig. 5), it is possilile they denote earth (cal) in Maya signifies 
"earth"). In the upper division the Kan-like symbols (one of which 
a bird is pecking and another is bitten by a little quadruped) prob- 
ably represent grains of corn, supposed to be in the ground, the two 
to the right throwing out sprouts. If this interpretation be correct, 
this entire plate probably has reference to the cultivation of corn and 
the dangers it is sul)ject to. However, from what has been stated, the 
reader can judge as to the portion of this codex that has l)een deter- 
mined with certainty, which is but little, and as to what is as yet but 
theoretical. Of the text proper, scarcely anything, as before stated, 
has been a]>solutely determined. This failure to decipher is attribu- 



CENTRAL AMERICAlSr HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING. 7 19 

table in part to the fact that where the suggested signification may be 
absohitely correct, no means, except where numbers come into play, 
has been found to verify the conclusion. 

From what has been stated and the examples presented from the 
inscriptions and codices, it is apparent, notwithstanding the number 
of gl^'phs whose signification has been ascertained, that practically no 
progress has been made in determining the phonetic equivalents of these 
characters. In other words, no satisfactory evidence has yet been 
presented to show that any of these glyphs are phonetic, although 
there is sufiicient evidence that the language used was Maya. The 
nearest approach to proof on this point is in regard to a few symbols, 
such as tliat for the month Tzotz (fig. 4). The usual form of the 
gl} ph is the conventionalized head of the leaf -nosed bat, and in one 
instance (Stela D, Copan) the full form showing the wings and body 
is introduced as the symbol of the month. As tzotz is the Maya word 
for bat, it is possible the word relates to the symbol. Pop, the name of 
another month, signifies in Maya literally a mat, or rug, the refer- 
ence being apparently to the structure, and the chief feature of the 
symbol for the month consists usually of interlacing like basket 
work. These and a few other instances of similar character consti- 
tute the strongest indications of phoneticism that have been observed, 
but as the elements of these gl3^phs found where the character can not 
be determined by other means furnish no aid in decipering them the 
inference of phoneticism is doubtful. It is possible that some of the 
characters are phonetic, yet it must be admitted that no satisfactory 
proof thereof has 3'et been presented, although the author, with others, 
thought but a few years ago that continued investigation would soon 
produce this evidence. 

The general purport of the inscriptions has not been ascertained 
with certaint}^, yet the fact that half of them belong to the classes 
heretofore described — the numeral symbols, calendar symbols, etc. — 
leads to the conclusion that thej^ contain little, if anything, relating to 
the histor}' of the tribes by wdiom the}" were made. 

The indications that the Maya priests, by whom these inscriptions 
were doubtless designed, if not carved, recognized a prime or ruling- 
era from which a large portion of the initial time series are counted, 
are so strong that most recent authorities who have devoted attention 
to the subject have concluded to adopt the theory, at least tentatively. 
We might hope that further research will prove that this has some 
relation to Maya history were it not that the beginning was placed 
about four thousand 3'ears prior to the time when the inscriptions 
were made — a date so remote as to preclude the supposition that it 
related to any noted event in the history of the tribes. 



720 CENTKAL AMERICAN" HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING. 

The progress made in deciphering the text of the codices is less than 
that made in interpreting the inscriptions, as the number of numeral, 
time, and other s^ymbols in the former which have been determined 
is less in proportion to the whole than in the latter. However, this 
proportion is limited to the text of the codices and does not include 
the accompanA'ing numeral and day series. Nevertheless, the aid fur- 
nished by the figures which are introduced, together with the relation 
a large portion of the time series bear to the text and figures, often 
furnish some indication of the general purport of the plates, but all 
attempts to give the details have thus far failed, from the lack of means 
of verification. Two or three of the plates of the Dresden codex are 
devoted entirely to a single numeral scries. These can l^e followed 
throughout and the obliterated characters in most cases restored; in 
fact, some of them seem to be little else than the steps of the calcula- 
tion made by the original scribe. Possibly their relation to adjacent 
series may yet T)e ascertained and their signification determined. 
This lias been accomplished in regard to the series running through 
plates 40-5() of the Dresden codex." 

A brief answer to the question, What has the progress thus far 
made in deciplKM'ing this hiei'oglyphic writing added to our knowledge 
of the ancient history, life, and attainments of the Maya people? may 
properly close this brief article. 

That it has shown a greater advance in culture along particular lines 
than was previousl}^ known is certainly true. Much has Ijeen ascer- 
tained from the remains of stone structures and the sculptured designs 
thereon in regard to the advance of tlie Mayas along certain lines of 
art and their abilit}^ to form and to carry out comprehensive plans 
and designs; but the study of the hieroglyphs has brought to light 
evidence of mental capability and attainments of a higher grade in 
some respects than has been shown elsewhere. It would be some- 
what difficult for an3'one at the present da}^, except a mathematician, 
to calculate l)ack 34,059 years 9 months and 18 days from a particular 
day in the present year, using our Gregorian calendar, and determin- 
ing the exact month, day of the month, and day of the week that will 
be reached. Yet this was accomplished by the Maj^a priests according 
to their calendar and with their cumbersome vigesimal system. Not 
onl}" was it necessary to reduce the several orders of units (cycles, 
katuns, etc.) to the lowest denomination, but the sum had to be 
changed into years, months, and days. The modern mathematician 
has his liooks of tables, and his paper, ink, and pen and pencil, and a 
numeral system that is simple and easy to handle. How did the 
Mayan scribe solve the same problem with the means he had at hand? 
The study of the glyphs has brought these facts and this question 
before us. 

«The Maya Year, by Cyrus Thomas, Bureau Am. Ethn., 1894. 



CENTRAL AMERICAN HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING. 721 

The steps which have been made in decipherment have made it 
evident that the Maj^an priests had an understood era or a well-under- 
stood point of departure in their time counts. They also indicate 
that the inscriptions at Copan and Quirio-ua were carved in substan- 
tially the same period, the range, judging by the terminal dates of 
the initial series, being comprised in two hundred j^ears. But the 
attempts to connect the dates in the Mayan inscriptions and codices 
with dates in the Gregorian calendar have failed, though greater suc- 
cess has attended the efforts in this direction with the Aztec count. 
Another fact made prominent by the study of these glyphs is the 
uniformity in the system, art, and culture, along the lines indicated, 
in Chiapas, Guatemala, western Honduras, and with slight exceptions 
in Yucatan. The collection of hieroglyphs from the inscriptions of the 
latter section are not sufficient to determine whether they follow the 
Troano and Cortesian codices or the system of the inscriptions of 
Chiapas and Guatemala. 

Th(> study of the inscriptions and codices has made it evident that 
no adjustment between the Maya year and the solar year was made in 
any way that appears in the record or interfered with the calendar 
count. Although the efforts at interpretation have succeeded in few 
if any instances in tracing the connection throughout long inscrip- 
tions, they have made it evident that there is connection, or, in other 
words, that these inscriptions (with possible exceptions) are continu- 
ous records from the initial gl3q3h to the end, though it may consist of 
little else than number series and time counts. Both inscriptions and 
codices evidently relate very largely to ceremonies and priestly duties, 
more particularly the latter. 

Another result of the stud}' of the hieroglyphs is the clear distinc- 
tion it has estal)lished between the Maya and the Aztec symbolic 
writings. 

The Maya writing has been studied to a greater or less extent by

TRACES OF ABORIGINAL OPERATIONS IN AN IRON MINE 
NEAR LESLIE, MO.« 



Bv W. H. Holmes. 



Early in April, 1903, a comnmnic-ation was received hy the Bureau 
of American Ethnology from Dr. S. W. Cox, of Cuba, Mo., stating 
that evidences of ancient mining operations had l)een discovered in an 
iron mine operated by him near Leslie, Franklin County. This report 
was confirmed b}^ Mr. D. I. Bushnell and other St. Louis archeologists, 
and the present writer, who is especially interested in the quarrying 
and mining industries of the aborigines, repaired at once to Leslie to 
make a stud}^ of the interesting phenomena. 

It was found that the miners had encountered a body of iron ore, 
of unknown depth and horizontal extent, lying inmiediatel}' beneath 
the surface of the soil on a gentle slope reaching down to the banks of 
Big Creek, a branch of Bourbois River, and that the}^ had removed 
the ore from a space about 100 feet wide, 150 feet long, and to a depth 
at the deepest part of between 15 and 20 feet, as shown in plate i. 
In beginning the work traces of ancient excavations were observed 
penetrating the soil which covered the surface of the ore body to a 
depth of from 1 to 5 feet, and as the work progressed it was found 
that the ore had been fairly honeycombed by the ancient people, the 
passagewa3-s extending even below the present floor of the mine, as at 
the right of the figure in the plate. There w^ere many partialh^ filled 
galleries, generally narrow and sinuous, 'but now and then larger 
openings appeared, two of these being of sufficient dimensions to 
accommodate standing workmen. 

In the debris of the old excavations many rude stone implements 
were encountered, and upward of 1,000 of these had been gathered 
by the miners into a heap on the margin of the mine. (PI. ii.) 
These sledges are exceedingly rude, consisting of hard masses of 
stone or hematite weighing from 1 to 5 pounds, and roughly grooved 
or notched for the attachment of withe handles, no trace of the latter 
remaining, however. The great number of these implements made 
it certain that extensive operations had been carried on by the ancients,

but the exact nature of the work was not readily determinable. The 
first impression was that the compact masses of hematite were sought 
for the purpose of manufacturing implements such as Avere employed 
by the mound-building- tribes in many parts of the Mississippi Val- 
le}^, but examination revealed few traces of the shaping of this 
material, save that it had l)een used in making- the rude sledge heads 
or hammers found in the mine. In breaking- up the ore the white 
miners encountered small, irregular seams and masses of flint, but 
these were too limited in extent and too brittle in texture to have 
been utilized successfully in the manufacture of implements. Some 
workable flint was observed in the vicinity of the ore bod}^, and flakes 
and rojectage of blade making, as well as a number of well-flnished 
spearheads, arrow points, and leaf -shaped blades were intermingled in 
the fllling of some of the superficial pits, but this flint shaping appears 
to have been an incident only of the work on the site. The evidences 
of this shaping work are not suflicient to warrant the conclusion that 
the extensive tunneling was carried on for the purpose of obtaining 
material for that purpose. Besides, this flint is found in large bodies 
in man}" sections of the general region and could readil}" have been 
obtained in quantity by the Indians. 

It was o])served, in approaching- the mine, that the exposed surfaces 
of the ore and the ground about were everj'where a brilliant red. The 
workmen were red from head to foot, and anyone venturing to handle 
the ore soon found his hands smeared with red oxide, repeated wash- 
ing being required to remove it. The prevalence of the red color sug- 
gested at once the idea that the site had been an aboriginal paint mine 
and that the red and yellow oxides wore mined and carried away to 
be used as paint — an article of utmost importance in the aboriginal 
econom3^ 

As the charges of dynamite used ])y the miners l)roke down the 
walls of the mine it was observed that the deposits were of irregular 
hardness, that certain portions of the ore were very compact and flinty, 
containing much quartz, and of dark-bluish or purplish hue, while the 
larger part was so highly oxidized as to be easily broken up. Extend- 
ing- through the ore body in all directions were pockets and seams of 
soft red and yellow oxides, and in places there were irregular open- 
ings and partially filled ca\'ities. Two of these openings are shown 
in plate iii, a view of the face of the mine taken by Mr. Clark McAdams, 
of St. Louis. The miners would drill with great difiiculty through 
the hardest of ore, to have the drill drop suddenly into a cavity of 
unknown depth. This occurred at the spot shown in plate iv. It 
was difficult to discover just which of these openings and cavities were 
artificial, or whether or not they had been penetrated by the ancient 
workers, as changes are constantly taking place in such ore bodies. 
Percolating waters fill up or clear out the passagewa^' s. Generally,

however, as the walls were broken down by our miners the open- 
ing's were found to connect with the superticial pittings, as indicated 
in plate v. 

It appears certain that the larger tunnels or galleries in which the 
sledges were found had been opened up or enlarged by the ancient 
miners and that, in the search for other bodies of the desired product, 
thej^ had followed weak lines and partially filled passageways, removing 
the projecting masses of hard ore, where these interfered with the 
work, l)y means of the sledges. Sketches of these rude implements 
are sliown in fig. 1, and the specimens appear on plate vi. It is appar- 
ent that the sledges could have had no other function than that of 
crushing and breaking up the solid masses of ore to be used in the 
manufacture of implements or in opening new passageways through 
the ore body. Although these sledges were made in the main of com

pact bits of the ore and of the flinty masses associated with it, they 
correspond very closely in general characteristics with the bowlder 
sledges used in such great numbers in the copper mines of Lake Supe- 
rior. Nearly all appear to have been hafted for use, and the majority 
show the rude grooving or notching necessaiy for the attachment of 
the withe haft. It would seem that in the narrow passages of the 
mine the use of hafted implements would bo inconvenient if not 
entirely impracticable, and wo are left to marvel at the feat accom- 
plishi^l by the ancient workmen of penetrating a compact ore body in 
dark, sinuous passages hardly roomy enough to admit the body of a 
man, with the aid of rude bits of stone held in the hand. The char- 
acter of these openings is indicated clearly in plate iii, which shows 
the face of the mine as freshly exposed by the mining operations; and 
plate V indicates somewhat imperfectly the manner in which the tun- 
nels or borings penetrate the ore body connecting with the superficial

pity and extending- to unknown depths beneath the present tloor of the 
mine. Three of these borings are seen in the wall of the ijiine shown 
in plate vii. One is exposed at the right of the right-hand figure, 
and a second occurs beyond this, extending from the stump on the 
margin of the mine down to and beneath the feet of the man whose 
back is turned toward the observer, and a third passes down from the 
second stump, being the same opening as that shown at d d in plate v. 

Numerous examples of the implements found and specimens of the 
ore in its various phases, together with a large mass of the compact 
ore, one surface of which shows the markings of the mining tools of 
the aborigines, were presented to the U. S. National Museum by the 
proprietor of the mine. Dr. S. W. Cox. 

I have now examined mines and quarries of the aborigines in twelve 
distinct materials, and each new example has added to my former high 
estimate of the enterprise and perseverance of the native peoples when 
engaged in the pursuit of their normal industries.

LHASA AND CENTRAL TIBET.« 



By C;. Ts:. Tsybikoff.'> 



After a journe}^ of twenty-two days over the sparsel}^ populated 
north Tibetan phxteaii, onr caravan of pilgrims camped July 19/' 1000, 
on the banks of the San-chu, at the northern foot of tlie Bumza 
ISIountain. The caravan had been formed at the Kumlnun monastery 
in Amdo, and started April 24: on the way to Lhasa. There were 
about To persons in the party, almost all of them Amdo and IMongo- 
lian Lamas, and were quartered in 17 traveling tents. Alwut 200 mules 
transported men and baggage. 

We here first met inhabitants of Central Tibet. Close to the road 
was a great l)lack tent in which lived the local soldiery, an advance 
post on the lookout for foreigners. They had special orders to watch 
during the present 3'ear for P. K. Kosloff's Russian expedition, of 
which the authorities at Lhasa had received information as early as 
April. 

The guards immediately approached our camp, but seeing that it 
was an ordinary caravan of pilgrims, the men Avere soon busied in 
making trifling exchanges to supply their wants, our men keeping a 
watchful eye on articles that might readily be stolen. After four 
short marches from here we reached the Nakchu monastery, the resi- 
dence of two governors of the local nomads, appointed b}" the central 
government of Tibet. One of them belongs to the clerg}^ and is called

& " M. Tsybikoff is a Buriat by birth, and a Lamaist by religion, who finished his 
education at a Russian university, and, after having prepared himself for this journey, 
went quite openly, like so many other Buriat pilgrims, to Lhasa. There he remained 
more than twelve months, making an excursion to Tsetang (or Chetang) and visiting 
some of the most venerated monasteries, after having previously stayed, during his 
journey to Lhasa, in the Mongol monasteries of Labrang and Kumbum. During 
his stay at Lhasa he made, moreover, a most valuable collection of books, written by 
all the most renowned Lama writers during tlie last nine centuries. This collection 
represents 319 volumes on philology, medicine, astronomy and astrology, history, 
geography, and collections of ku-rims (praises, prayers, and incantations, and so on).

"Khambo," the other is a civilian, called " Nansal." They supervise 
the collection of taxes and decide important matters that arise between 
the natives; and also control the government stations between Nakchu 
and Lhasa. It also devolves upon them to stop Europeans bound for 
Lhasa and immediatel}^ to notify the central government about them, 
as well as about all suspicious persons. I was halted as belonging to 
the last category, due to the chief of our caravan, who, out of friend- 
ship to the Tibetans and possibly to shift responsibility from himself, 
reported that there were Buriats in the party. Although the Buriats 
had of late been freeh^ admitted, yet we were each obliged to pay 5 
taels (about $4), which at once excluded us from the suspicious class 
and opened our way to Lhasa. 

The Nakrhu monastery serves also as a custom-house. Here all pil- 
grims are ()])liged to pay a tax on each tent, the revenue being used 
for keeping the local pastures in grass. No penalty is imposed upon 
those who refuse to pay the toll, although an indirect punishment is 
inflicted ))y prohibiting tiie local residents from having anything to do 
with delinquents. 

After losing half a day here, the caravan left the monasterj^ situ- 
ated on the left bank of the small river Dre-chu," and 7 miles away 
approached the left bank of the Nakchu. In the rain}^ season, when 
the river runs deep and swift, it is impossible to cross without 
V)oats, which evidently the native nomads can not build. Thence the 
caravan reached the broad Sun-shan Valley, bounded on the north by 
Mount Samtan Kansar. From this valley, across the low crest of 
Chog-la, the road enters the Dam Valley, inhabited by descendants of 
Mongols brought into Tibet by the Khoshot Gushi Khan in the 
middle of the seventeenth century. The}^ are at present practically 
assimilated with the Tibetans, although some still use Mongol felt 
tents, and have not forgotten how to milk the mares and to make 
kumys. Mongol words have disappeared from their language, 
except ofticial titles and some special technical terms. The Dam 
Mongols are subject to the Manchu Amban, who resides at Lhasa. 
Their occupation is cattle raising. 

From Dam across Lani-la, or "double range," we enter a pass 
where we come to the first agricultural settlement of Central Tibet. 
It is more civilized here. The Pondo-chu is crossed by pedestrians 
over a bridge. In the rainy season baggage is taken across in skin 
boats, while animals ford the stream. On the right side of this swift 
river stands the castle Pondo-dzong. 

Twenty-seven miles farther on the journe\" we reached Penbu, or 
Penyul, one of the most thickly populated regions of Tibet. Cara- 
vans have from here a choice of two roads — one, without crossing the 
ridge, along the right bank of the U-chu, and the other, straight 

«Chu = river in Tibetan. 



LHASA AND CPJNTKAL TIBET. 729 

across the high ridge of Go-la. About ten miles from the top of the 
ridge lies the capital of Tibet, Lhasa, which we entered August 3, 
1900, after three month's journey from Kuml)um. 

Central Tibet — that is, the two provinces of U (Wei) and Tsang — has 
not been visited b}^ Eluropeans since 1845, at least the principal part 
of it, although the literature on Tibet in general has increased every 
year. No Russian traveler entered the country either before or 
certainly after the prohibition. But for the last thirty years Tibet 
has been annually visited by Buriats and Kalmuks, who are Russian 
subjects. • Many of these pilgrims made notes on Tibet, but thus far 
only the report of Zayaetf (eighteenth century), and the diary of the 
Kalmuk Baza-bakshi have been published. 

It must be borne in mind that having penetrated a forbidden country 
in the guise of an ordinary pilgrim, obliged to pose before the natives 
as one in search of salvation in the holy land, and constantl}^ in danger 
of suspicion as other than a pilgrim, the amount of information gath- 
ered under .'-uch circumstances could not ha\ e been great. I was well 
aware that several years ago an Indian penetrated Central Tibet and 
established connections with a certain ecclesiastic in Tashilhunpo, 
that through this lama's servant he received books at Calcutta, and 
that both lama and servant were executed at Lhasa for daring to allow 
the admission of a foreigner. 

Tibet is truly a land of mountains, and the natives apth' call it 
"Snowland." In the region we traversed while in Tibet there are two 
snow mountains, Samtan-Kansar on the eastern end of the Nvan-chu- 
tangla and the crest of Kar-la on the southwestern side of the circular 
lake, Yamdok. The mountains that did not reach the snow line were 
nearly all treeless and their tops bare. 

The upper lands of the river valleys are narrow and untit for culti- 
vation, but the middle and lower portions are wider and ena})le the 
industrious Tibetans to grow cereal crops. The steep and rocky 
mountains are the source of many swift streams during the rainy 
season, but most of them dry out when the rains cease. Many 
streams and springs, however, collect water at each rainfall in muner- 
ous irrigating ditches that keep the water mills busy. 

The year may be divid(>d into two seasons, rainy and dry. In li»Oo 
the dry season connnenced in Lhasa on Septend)er 13, when the last 
rain of the y(>ar fell. October and No\(Mnber were entireh^ dry. 
The first snow fell December 7, but melted the next day. It snowed 
once in Jaiuiary, in P^^bruary three times, in JMarcli four times. The 
first thunder was heard on March 14, and twice in April. The snow 
melted in the valleys immediately after falling, but remained for a 
time on the mountains. The first considerat)le rain fell on May 5, 
then on May 7. June 8, July 17, August 13, and twice early in Sep- 
tember. These rains were generally late in the evening or at night, 



730 LHASA AND CENTRAL TIBET. 

in scjualls and large drops, and in Ma}' and June were frequently 
accompanied Avitli hail. The clouds generally moved from west to 
east. 

Temperature o})servations were recorded at dawn, 1 p. m., and 9 
p. m. for two hundred and thirty-live da3\s. The average morning- 
temperature was 41.45^ ¥.; 1 p. m., 58.33° F.; 9 p. m./ 48.65° F. 
December was the coldest month, with an average morning tempera- 
ture of 18.3° F. ; noon, 34.5° F., and evening, 26.8° F; and June was 
the warmest month, with average morning temperature 58.6° F. ; 
noon, 73° F., and evening (53.3° F. The large rivers are entirely free 
of ice in winter, but the small ones are covered by a thin crust. The 
soil freezes onh^ at the surface. 

The total population of Tibet has been estimated from the fantastic 
33.000,000 down to 3,500,000, or even 2,500,000. The most reliable 
evidence indicates that Central Tibet has not more than about 1,000,000 
inhabitants. Reliable statistics of the whole population were not 
obtainable, but it is certainly not verj^ great, for the many narrow 
liver valleys between high, rocky mountains are unfit for agriculture 
and could not sustain many inhal)ltants. Besides, the numerous 
unmarried ascetic ecclesiastics of both sexes, and epidemics of small- 
pox and other fatal diseases against which the Tibetans are almost 
defenseless, not only retard an increase, but would appear to gradu- 
ally decrease the country's growth. More than 10 per cent of the 
population of Lhasa and neighboring monasteries died of smallpox in 
1900. Further evidence of the limited Tibetan population appears 
from the fact that only about 20,000 monks from all the monasteries 
in the vicinity gather at the so-called "great Monlam of Lhasa." 
This, remember, in the center of Lamaism, where the principal sanc- 
tuaries and the higher Tszanite schools are located, which to a consid- 
erable extent are supported b}^ the government! The native Tibetans 
call tliemselves Bo(d)-pa, and it is also customary to refer to people 
according to the names of particular regions. Thus the inhabitants 
of Tsang are called "Tsang-pa," etc. The floating population of the 
cities is composed of Chinamen, Ncpalesc, Kashmiris, and Mongols. 

Most of the Chinamen, especially the emigrants from Ssu-ch'uan, are 
emploA'ed in the garrison camps of the large cities, while those engaged 
in commerce transact their small trade with the local inhabitants, 
principalh' the women * * " . 

The Nepalese and Kashmiris, about equal in numbers, are merchants 
almost exclusively, though a few of the former are artisans. Accord- 
ing to tradition the Nepalese were for a long time the architects of the 
temples, the scidptors of the Buddha statues, and the ikon painters of 
Tibet, and they are still the most expert cloth dyers, and are skillful as 
gold and silver smiths, from small trinkets to the gilt roofs of temples. 
The Buddhist Nepalese, in distinction from the ruling caste, Gurka, in 



LHASA AND CENTRAL TIBET. 731 

their Kingdom, are called Ba(l)-bo. The}- avoid marriage with Tibe- 
tans, for such ties mean death in their native land, and they therefore 
remain permanently in Tibet. The Kashmiris, on the contrary, always 
marry Tibetans, whom they first convert to Mohammedanism, and rear 
their children in that religion. 

In administrative matters the Chinamen are responsible directly to 
the Amban, who resides and officiates at the southwest end of the cit}^, 
near the ruins of the old city wall. The Nepalese and Kashmiris are 
subject to their elders, who serve as deputies in affairs before the 
central government of Tibet, with its jurisdiction. The Mongols, 
about 1,000 of them, are all monks, and only temporary residents, 
about 15 per cent of their number changing annuall3^ They are dis- 
tributed over the various monasteries according to their parishes. 
The Russian subjects among them in 1900 numbered 17, being Buriat 
Lamas from the region across the Baikal, with one Kalmuk from the 
Astrakhan government. They are subject to the monastery regulations. 

The social classes are the nobility, the clergy, and the peasantry. 
The nobility consists of the descendants of former rulers of separate 
principalities and descendants of the fathers of Dalai Lamas and Pan- 
chens, who are invested by the Manchu court with the rank of prince 
of the fifth degree. 

The princes, together with the monasteries and their parishes, are 
large landowners, and the peasants are serfs to them. The central 
government, or the Dalai Lama, owns, of course, more land and serfs 
than the classes named.' 

There is apparently no distinct military caste. Military service 
accompanies the privilege of special land grants, but we could not 
secure detailed information a))out it. 

The houses are of stone or unburnt brick, cemented with clay. 
Most of those in the villages are one story high, while in the cities 
they are of two or three stories. The windows are Avithout panes, or 
hung with cotton curtains, though in winter oiled native paper serv^es 
as protection from the cold. Fireplaces are used only for cooking. 
The houses have no chimneys, the smoke escaping as l)est it luay 
through doors and windows, except that houses with upper stories 
have roof openings that somewhat alleviate the smoke nuisance, though 
equally a discomfort during rain. The principal fuel is dry manure 
of horned cattle and yaks. The clothing is of special design, made 
from native cloth in various colors. The poor classes wear white, the 
cheapest color; the richer people red and dark red, the soldiers dark 
blue, and yellow is used b}' higher dignitaries and princes. Women 
prefer the dark-red cloth. Of course, other colors are also met with. 
In proportion to their means, the Tib(>tans dress rather elegant!}'. 
Their jewelry is of gold, silver, corals, diamonds, rubies, pearls, tur- 
quoise, and other stones. 



782 LHASA AND CENTRAL TIBET. 

Tsamba, or roasted barley flour, mixed with either tea or barle}^ 
wine, is one of the principal foods. The conniionest vegetable is the 
radish. The favorite dish among- all classes is "tsamtuk," a soup 
made by boiling zamba in water and flavored with bits of radish. 
Tsamtuk is best when made into broth with crushed bones, but it is 
comparatively expensive, and only the well to do can afl'ord it every 
day. 

The Til)etans are fond of raw njeat, and when entertaining they 
serve meat either raw or not fully cooked. The principal meats are 
yak, mutton, and pig. Beef is not considered good, and ass and horse 
meat are not used at all. The poor classes also eat fish. We did not 
see the Tibetans use fowl as food, although they keep chickens for the 
eggs. Butter is much used, serving principally to whiten or flavor 
tea, and melted butter is burned in lamps before the idols. Sour milk, 
prepared also as thib-sho, is regarded as very noble food, and in poetry 
indicates something pure white. 

Both sexes of all classes are very fond of barley wine, and owing to 
its cheapness and slight intoxicating properties it constitutes the prin- 
cipal l)ev('rage of the poor. The men are heav}^ smokers of leaf 
tobacco in pipes, and the monks, while avoiding the pipe, consume no 
less tobacco in snufl'. Because of the high cost of tobacco, and to 
reduc^e its strength, the laymen mix it with the leaves of the plant 
"shol," and the monks use the ashes of ram and goat dung for that 
purpose. 

The principal characteristics of the Central Tibetan may be described 
as stupidity and flattery, doubtlessly explained b}^ the economic and 
political conditions of the country. They are also pious through fear 
of losing the protection of the gods or of angering them. On this 
account thev have frequent sacrifices, bowing and circling before their 
sanctuaries. They are very impressionable and superstitious, and at 
each new episode in their lives they seek explanation from Lama seers 
and prophets, and when sick they prefer to take barley grains blessed 
by Lamas and prophets, or to have curing prayers read to them, r-ather 
than resort to medicine, which, by the way, is less developed in Cen- 
tral Tibet than in Amdo or Mongolia. Despite all, the Tibetans seem 
to ])e inclined to joviality, which manifests itself in song and dance 
during their frequent sprees and pul)lic holidays. 

Li their family life polyandry and polygani}^ exist, and the marriage 
of several brothers to one woman or of several sisters to one man are 
regarded as ideal relations. * * * Women enjoy perfect freedom 
and independence and take an active part in business aftairs, often 
managing extensive enterprises entirely unaided. 

Agriculture is the chief occupation of the settled population. Bar- 
ley is the standard crop, from which tsamba is prepared; then comes 
wheat, for wheat fl.our; beans for oil, and peas, used by the poorer 



LHASA AND CENTRAL TIBET. 733 

class in form of flour, or crushed for horses, mules, and asses. The 
fleld work is done principally by "dzo'" (a cross breed of 3'ak and 
ordinary cattle), yaks, and asses. The principal beasts of burden are 
the small, hardy asses, and to some extent the ordinary horned cattle. 
Inhabitants of the highland regions are eng-aged in cattle raising, 
breeding yaks, sheep, and some horses. They use yaks for burden, 
and sheep in some places. The horse and mule are, to a certain 
extent, a luxury to the Tibetan, and are therefore kept only by the 
well to do. The native horses and mules are ver}^ small and homely, 
so that the rich people use only those imported from western China. 
In the stables of the Dalai Lama and Panchen there are blooded horses 
from India. 

Commerce consists in supplying the cities and monasteries with 
agricultural products in exchange for articles of insignificant local 
manufacture and foreign import. The excess of domestic products is 
exported. The Tibetan has very few wants, chiefly limited to neces- 
sities, although some inclination toward objects of luxury, expensive 
ornaments, objects of cult and home adornment may be observed. 
The standard money is a silver coin valued at about 1(> cents. 

The unequal distribution of wealth and the subservience of poverty 
to wealth are conspicuous. There is such little commerce that labor is 
very cheap, the most expert weaver of native cloth receiving about 8 
cents and board per da}\ while an unskilled woman or man laborer 
earns only 2 or 3 cents. The highest salary is paid to the Lamas, the 
prayer readers, who receive 10 cents a da}' for incessant reading. A 
house servant almost never receives pay bej^ond food and meager 
clothes. * * * 

I will now describe the more or less prominent cities and monasteries 
visited in Central Tibet. Chief of all, of course, is the capital, 
Lhasa, sometimes called ''Kadan" in literature, but both names have 
almost the same meaning — " the land of gods," or ''full of gods." Its 
origin dates from the time of Khan Srongzang-Gaml)o, who lived in the 
seventh century, a. d. It is said that this khan had among his wives 
one Nepalese and one Chinese queen, each of whom brought along a 
statue of the Buddha Sakyamuni, to whose worship temples were 
erected in Lhasa, and he settled on Mount Marbo-ri, where the palace 
of the Dalai Lama now stands. Lhasa is situated on a broad plain, 
bordered on one side by the river U-chu and on the other by high 
hills. If we disregard the Potala, or palace of the Dalai Lama, the 
city is nearly round, with a diameter of about a mile. But the 
numerous orchards in the southern and western parts, the proximity 
of the Potala wnth the adjacent medical college, the court of Datsag- 
hutuktu, and the summer residence of the Dalai Lama led to the 
belief that it was about 25 miles in circumference. As a matter of 
fact, the circular road along which the pious make their marches on

foot or in prostrate bows is about 8 miles long. When these bows are 
faithfully performed the circle is completed in two days, making about 
3,000 bows a day. 

The orchards and trees in the outskirts of the city are admired by the 
natives, and give the place a very })eautif ul appearance, especially in 
the spring and summer, when the gilt roofs of the two principal tem- 
ples glisten in the sun and the white walls of the many-storied build- 
ings shine among the green tops of the trees. But the delight of the 
distant view at once vanishes upon entering the city with its crooked 
and dirty streets. * * * 

A temple in which there is a large statue of Buddha marks the 
center of the city. The building is 140 feet square, three stories 
high, with four gilt roofs of Chinese design. The entrance gate 
faces the north. Each floor of the temple, with its blind external 
walls, is divided into numerous artificially lighted rooms, wherein 
stand various statues of Buddha. In the middle room on the east side 
stands the principal object of Vv-orship, Buddha Sakj^amuni, under a 
sumptuous canopy. This bronze statue difl'ers from the usual repre- 
sentations of the Indian sage in its head and chest ornaments of 
wrought gold set with precious stones, with a predominance of tur- 
quoise prepared and placed upon it b}^ the famous founder of yellow- 
hat teachings, Tsongkapa. The face of the statue ever since the days 
of that same Tsongkapa has been kept painted by devout worshipers 
with gold powder dissolved in liquid glue. Upon long tables before 
the god, melted butter, offered by the worshipers, ever burns in 
golden lamps. Two other statues in the temple connnand almost 
equal respect — the 11-faced bodisattva Avalokiteshvara, of which 
the Dalai Lamas are regarded as incarnations, and the statue Pal- 
Lhamo, the protectress of women. * * * Under the latter statue 
barley wine is being incessantly sprinkled and grains are freely scat- 
tered. Abundance of food and snug hiding places in the folds of the 
clothing of the statue have attracted numerous mice, that are here 
considered hol3^ * * * 

Besides the principal court of the temple there are two additional 
courts, in which the gatherings of the clergy of the neighboring 
monasteries are held. 

Another small statue of Buddha stands in a temple in the northern 
part of the city and is called " Jovo-ramoche," but l)oth temple 
and statue are inferior in proportions and ornaments to the main tem- 
ple, and there is a noticeable difference in the reverence of the 
worshipers. 

Within the city limits of Lhasa there are four courts or quarters of 
eminent Hutuktu incarnates, who were once Tibetan khans. They are 
the best buildings in the city, and as each has a certain number of 
pupils of the Lamas they are really small monasteries. Then, each

of the eminent incarnates has his own inherited house. All other 
buildings belono- either to the central government, or to the various 
communities of the neighl^oring monasteries. Buildings owned by 
private individuals are few and are mainlj" in the outskirts of the 
city. 

All these buildings are under the control of the palace of the Dalai 
Lama, Potala, about two-thirds of a mile west of the city, and built upon 
a rocky height. The foundation of the palace, tradition says, was laid 
by the above-named Srongzang Khan during the seventh century, but 
it was remodeled, with the addition of the main central portion, called 
" Pobrang-marpo"" (the red palace), during the life, and even after the 
death, of the fifth eminent Dalai Lama. It is evident that the palace 
and additions were planned to serve as a means of defense, and from 
this point of view Potala looms up as one of the old castles, of which 
many ruins abound in Tibet, and in the sad fate of which Potala played 
the preeminent role by subjecting them to itself. 

The palace is about 1,400 feet long and about 70 feet higii in 
front. The front and two sides are surrounded by a wall, the rear 
portion extending into the hill. In the construction of this palace the 
Tibetans displayed their highest architectural skill. Here are found 
the most precious treasures of Tibet, including the golden sepulchre 
of the fifth Dalai Lama, which is about 28 feet high. The treasures 
and apartments of the Dalai Lama are in the central portion of the 
temple palace, which is painted a tawny color and known as the "red 
palace" — Pobrang-marpo. The remainder of the building serves as 
quarters for various attendants or followers of the Dalai Lama, 
including a community of 500 monks, the so-called "Namgyaltsan," 
whose duty it is to pray for the welfare and long life of the Dalai 
I^ama. 

Near the hill arc the mint, the house for the Dalai Lama's subjects, 
the prison, and other structures. Upon the continuation of this hill 
stands the convent Miinbo-datsang, where GO monks devote themselves 
to the study of medicine at the expense of the Dalai Lama. A little 
farther north is the idol temple of the Chinese Buddhists, and at the 
northwest foot of the hill is the palace of the fifth eminent hutuktu 
Kundif-ling, and about two-thirds of a mile west of the latter is the 
summer palace of the Dalai Lama. 

There are in Lhasa two temples where mysticism is taught, with an 
attendance of 1,200 men. 

The civilitui population of Lhasa scarcely exceeds 10,000 persons, 
about two-thirds of them women, although the number maj' seem 
greater on account of the proximity of two large monastei'ies, the 
many transient visitors, and the gatherings of worshipers from lama- 
ite countries. As the political and religious center of Tibet, its sanc- 
tuaries an attraction for numerous worshipers, Lhasa becomes an 



730 LHASA AND CENTRAL TIBET. 

important business place, as well as the connecting link in the com- 
merce between India and northern Tibet and China with the East. 

The market place is located around the central or temple section, 
where all the ground floors of buildings and open spaces in the streets 
are occupied b}^ stores and small exhibits of merchandise. Women 
are preeminently the sales people, although in the stores of the Kash- 
miris and Nepalese men do the selling. 

About the town stand the principal monasteries of Tibet, Sera, 
Brebung, and Galdan, known under the common name Serbre yesum. 
Brebung, the largest, is about 7 miles northwest of Lhasa; next comes 
Sera, about 2 miles north of the city, and last, Galdan, about 20 miles 
distant to the left of the river U-chu, on the incline of the steep 
mountain Brog-ri. They belong to one ruling sect of Tsongkapa and 
were organized during his lifetime, at the beginning of the fifteenth 
century. The Dalai Lama is regarded as the head of them all. There 
are 15,000 to 16,000 monks in all, of which 8,000 to 8,500 are in 
Brebung, 5,000 in Sera, and 2,000 to 2,500 in Galdan. In the Galdan 
monastery there is a vice-Tsongkapa, under the name, the "Galdan 
golden throne," a position established inunediately after the death of 
the organizer, at the suggestion of his pupils and disciples. Li olden 
times that office was tilled by the choice of the Galdan monks, but 
on account of the confusion that followed elections the present method 
of installation was instituted, and the position is now tilled in six-year 
terms by two Lamas, or, more correctly, wandering ecclesiastics, 
•"'Chzhuds," in the order of their service in the higher positions of 
their temple. The present incumbent is the eighty-tifth superior 
since Tsongkapa, or the eighty-sixth superior of Galdan, counting the 
reformer as the tirst. 

Each of the monasteries has its laws and its own land, and they are 
thus independent of one another. The Brebung monastery is the most 
influential, l)ecause of its wealth and numbers, which are both the cause 
and the eflect. Much of this superiority is also due to the fact that 
Brebung monks were elevated to Dalai Lamas, to whose lot it soon fell 
to l)e at the head of the spiritual and civil government of Central 
Tibet. The lamaiste monasteries are now not so much places of refuge 
for ascetics, as schools for the clergy, beginning with the alphabet and 
reaching to the highest theological knowledge. 

It is true that the public school begins the instruction in religion, 
but the elementaries as well as the domestic occupations of adults 
are taught by private teachers chosen by the pupil. Nevertheless, 
every one, be he a boy tive or six 3'ears old or a mature and even old 
person, is regarded as a member of the congregation and receives 
maintenance by becoming subject to the monastery laws. The prm- 
cipal suliject taught is theological philosophy, which consists of tive 



LHASA AND CENTRAL TIBET. 787 

sections of dogma, compiled by Indian pundits and translated into 
Tibetan. After the Tsong-kapa reform, commentaries were made by 
various learned men upon those sections, which, according to the 
Lamas, do not differ in substance, all the commentaries adhering to 
the general idea of the teachings of the famous i-eformer. In the 
monasteries mentioned religion is taught from commentaries of six 
scholars in seven editions, each of which has a separate faculty. Three 
of these are Brebung and two each in Sera and Galdan. 

Beside these religious faculties the first two monasteries have a fac- 
ulty called "Agpa," to perform the mystic rites and to pray for the 
welfare of the monaster3\ The clergy is very unevenly divided in 
the various faculties. In Brebung, for instance, there are 5,000 men 
in one faculty and only 600 in the other. 

It must be admitted that the monastic communities seem more con- 
cerned in securing "dailv bread" than in the education of their mem- 
bers. Honors and degrees are conferred only upon those who endow 
the connnunity in some practical manner. High positions, too, are 
encumbered with an obligation to distribute gifts among the members 
of the community. The principal source of endowments comes from 
the incarnates; that is, the incarnates of the soul of some predecessor. 
Whosesoever soul he may incarnate, ho is recognized in the community 
as such only after he has distri})uted a certain amount of money and 
food. On the other hand, howsoever learned a monk ma}' be, he 
receives the degree only after he has made endowments. Conse- 
quently charity and scholarship are measured by the amount of gifts 
to the monastery communities. 

Each monaster}" has some specdal characteristic. Thus Brelnmg is 
famous for its prophets, Sera for its cells for the ascetics, and Gal- 
dan for various old curios. 

The cult of the prophets or oracles is in its turn based upon the cult 
of the so-called "Choichong," or the guardians of learning. Judging 
by historical tradition it may be presumed that Buddhism, introduced 
into Tibet in the seventh century A. d., could not be rapidly developed 
because of difficulty in conquering the native gravitation toward their 
former deities, to which the people were accustomed and which were 
dear to them because they were their own creation. Besides, the 
sorcerers or priests were no doubt defenders of the old cult. On the 
other hand, however, Buddhism was protected by the rulers of Tibet 
and was bound to spread, and in the hard struggle popular supersti- 
tion was granted some concessions. This compromise between Bud- 
dhism and sorcery was made, we are told, by a preacher of the ninth 
century, Padma-Sambava. He compelled the former local spirits to 
swear that henceforth they would defend Buddhist learning only, 
for which they were promised honors, rendered in the form of sacrifice 
of wine, barley seeds, etc. The highest of these spirits, which were 



788 LHASA AND CENTRAL TIBET. 

imported from India, are called "Idma,"" while those of lower rank 
are called simply "Choichong-," or "Choisrung-." The Choichong 
speak with the lips of the prophets whom they inspire. Only 
Choichong- of lower degrees thus descend to prophets. As pro- 
tectors and defenders of the faith the people imagine them to be 
horrible monsters in warriors' outfit. On this account the prophet, 
before the descent of "Choichong-" upon him, dons a helmet and 
arms himself with spear, sword, or bows and arrows. The sense of 
the descent is contained in the fact that the spirit guardian of 
learning becomes incarnated in the chosen prophet for the sake of the 
liv^ing being's. Of such spirit guardians there are many, and the 
prophets are correspondingly numerous. The superior among them 
is the one confirmed by the Chinese Government — the Prophet Nai- 
chung- Choichong, whose gold-crowned temple and church suite is in the 
shady gai;den southeast of the monastery of Brebung. He is appealed 
to for prophecies, not only by ordinary mortals, but by all the higher 
clergy, including the Dalai Lama. Their mutual relation is as follows: 
Lama is "the abode of learning," and Choichong, its "guardian," 
having sworn to defend the religion vigilantly, will be honored of all 
for it. The Lama, therefore, honors — that is, brings sacrifices to — the 
Choichong, and the latter forestalls all that threatens the religion and 
the Lama, its representative. The}^ constitute a check on each other 
and are allies at the same time. In this role of defenders of the faith 
the Choichong — or, more correcth", their prophets — wield a powerful 
influence over all classes. Their power is so great that even the Dalai 
Lama and the highest Hutuktu must reckon with them; they endeavor 
to incline all toward themselves. * * * 

The "ritods," who are particularly numerous at Sera, are ascetic 
monks, who have retired from the world and buried themselves in 
meditation, which is regarded as one of the six means of attaining 
holiness — its origin based on Gautama's a})dication of kingly luxuries 
in search of truth. The later ascetics choose obscure nooks in dense 
forests or dark caves in the rocks as places for meditation. More 
recently they have concerned themselves not only about their own 
attainment of holiness, but al)Out the good of others, and their peaceful 
existence became distracted by the care of enlightening fellow-men. 
The silence of the cell for solitary meditations was broken b}^ the 
cries of those hungry for knowledge, and to the lot of the ascetics fell 
the new care of their spiritual and material satisfaction. Then the 
idea of worldly vanit}^ and comfortable quarters enticed the ascetics, 
and the cells were converted into comfortable dwellings, with quarters 
for pupils. The ascetic was thus transformed into the full master and 
ruler of his servants. Later on, with the appearance of the incarnates, 
the ritods become the inheritable property of the incarnates of the 
organizer, and several are transformed into separate monasteries.

However, the people still revere the ritods, and the tombstones of 
some of them are coveted last resting- places for the dead; upon them 
the corpses are cut up for the distribution of the flesh and bones 
among the griflin-vultures. 

The relic curios, in which Galdan is rich, show us to what an extent 
the famous Tsongkapa took possession of the minds of his followers. 
His successor after his death sought memorials of the existence of 
the dear teacher, not content with his works. Ho did not believe that 
a teacher could pass away leaving no footprints, and search was made 
for these everywhere about the monaster\'^ he established^ — where he 
passed his last years. His searches did not end in failure, and in 
various groves and among the rocks he saw traces of the wonder of 
the teacher, and explained them by one or another incident in his 
biography, and, conversel}^, with his biography explained those traces. 
Frequently meditating about his idolized teacher, ho drew and chis- 
eled his image upon rocks, and the images of the Buddhas, his pro- 
tectors. In course of time all these signs and statues made by the 
closest of pupils of Tsongkapa under the known influence of supersti- 
tion began to be taken for wonderful relics and each worshiper began 
to venerate them. 

It is characteristic that such relics are being discovered u}) to the 
present time. Thus the present Dalai Lama obtained from a rock a 
treasure, consisting of a hat and other articles, ascribed to Tsongkapa. 
He deposited the treasure in a special chest and placed it for safe- 
keeping at the sarcophagus of Tsongkapa and on its phxce erected a 
monument. 

We will now briefl}^ describe the other prominent monasteries and 
cities we visited. They are Tashilhunpo, and the cities of Shigatsze, 
Gyantsze, Samye, and Tsetang. 

The monastery of Tashilhunpo is about 170 miles west of Lhasa, to 
the right of the river Brahmaputi'a, on the south side of a mountain 
peak that forms an arm between that ri^'or and its tributary, the 
Nyangchu, and was established in 1447 by a pupil of Tsongkapa, Ge- 
dun-dru, who is regarded as the flrst incarnation of the Dalai Lama. 
There are about 3,000 monks within this place, divided into three 
religious and one mystical faculties. The head of the monaster}'^ 
is the incarnation of "Panchen erdeni," who maintains the monks 
there. Five stone idols and gilt roofs in Chinese tityle constitute the 
ornaments of the monasterj^ 

About two-thirds of a mile northeast of Tashilhunpo, upon a sep- 
arate rock, stands the castle Shigatsze, at the foot of which grew up 
a city of the same name, with a population of scarcely above 6,000 
or 7,000. Here are stationed small Chinese and native garrisons. 
The castle itself is well known from the fact that during the conquest 
of Tibet in the middle of the seventeenth century by the Mongol 



740 LHASA AND CENTRAL TIBET. 

Gushi-khan it served as the residence of the governor of Tibet, 
Tszangbo, who, after a long resistance, was conquered and killed. The 
castle is now in a semideserted condition, and prisoners sentenced to 
die are thrown from its roof to the rock below. 

About 50 miles from Shigatsze, in the valle}" of the Nj^angchu, lies 
one of the old cities of Tibet, Gyantsze, which is a very convenient 
place on the commercial road to India from Lhasa and Shigatsze. 
From the religious standpoint it is famous for its great religious 
structure, Cho(d) den-gomang, five stories high, with many rooms 
and various objects of interest, especially ancient statues of Buddha. 
Commercially the city is known for the manufacture of rugs and 
cloths. 

Up to the recent past the Tibetans made rugs of only one-colored 
wool in narrow strips, but now they weave, according to Chinese sam- 
ples, continuous rugs with designs, which are much inferior in elegance 
to the Chinese, but in firmness much superior to them, as thc}^ are 
made of pure wool. We must assume that rug manufacture in Tibet 
could be considerably developed on account of the cheapness of labor 
and of sheep's wool. 

The monastery of Samye is on the U^ft bank of tlie river Brahma- 
])utra, about 05 miles southeast of Lhasa. It is the oldest of Tibetan 
monasteries, having been established at the beginning of the ninth 
century A. u. by the famous preacher of Buddhism in Tibet, Padma 
Samba va, and the Khan Tirsong-detszan. Its conspicuous feature is a 
five-story temple, a mixture of Tibetan and Indian architecture. The 
latter is evident by the fact that the top story is without columns, a 
feature so prominent in Tibetan style. This monastery, with its 300 
monks, is maintained at the expense of the Dalai Lama treasury, and 
the idols are distinguished for their comparative cleanliness and care 
in the make-up. 

About 20 miles east of Samye, on the right bank of the river Brah- 
maputra, at the mouth of the fruit-producing valley Yarlung, lies the 
city of Tsetang (or Chetang), famed for the production of cloths, knit- 
ting, and the 3^ellow monk hats. According to tradition, the first 
ruler of Tibet, Niatri-tszangbo, was found in the vicinity of this city 
and sot upon the throne. The place occupies a favorable point on the 
road from Bhutan to Lhasa, as it enters the valley of the river Tszang. 
On the border of Bhutan lies the city of Tszona, where there is a 
market each spring that attracts many merchants from Lhasa. 

Passing now to the government of Central Tibet, the dependence 
upon China is made evident by the Peking Court appointment of a 
Manchu resident to manage the highcn- government. At the head of 
the local self-government stands the Dahii Lama as the spiritual and 
secular head of Central Tibet.

The Dialai Lamas attained their spiritual importance at tlio time of 
the Lama Gedun-Gyamtso, the superior of the Brebung monastery, 
who lived from 1475 to 1542. He was the superior simultaneously 
of the two monasteries Brebung- and Sera, and during his life ac- 
quired such fame that he began to be regarded as the incarnation of 
his countryman, the famous organizer of the monaster}' of Tashi- 
Ihunpo, Gedun-dru. But the custom of finding incarnates in youths 
begins after his death, and one oflicer of the castle proclaimed his 
son as this prophet's incarnation. This is evidently the tirst instance 
of the proclamation of an incarnate, and when he succeeded to the 
rig'hts of his predecessor it was his fortune, worshiped almost from 
the cradle, to be invited by the Mongol, Altan-Khan, who gave him 
the title " Vajra-daradalai-lama," which was sanctioned l)y the " Ming" 
Emperor of China. The signiticancc of the Dalai Lama in Tibet, how- 
ever, was at ilrst not very great, which explains the recognition of 
the son of a Mongol prince as the fourth incarnate, wdio, it is true, 
was killed in the twenty-eighth year of his life in Tibet. The Mon- 
gols claim that the Tibetans killed him out of race hatred, and that 
they even cut him open as the Mongols kill sheep. His successor, 
Ag-vang lo-sang-(i3amtso, now called simply " Na-va-chenbo" — that 
is, the Fifth, the great — succeeded in acquiring the secular power, 
which at tirst was still only nominal. This Dalai Lama, in combina- 
tion with the tirst '' banichen,'' did not hesitate to invite ^Mongol arms 
to his country in order to conquer the detesta))le secular governors. 
Although they succeeded in accomplishing it, Tibetan atiairs began to 
be interfered with either by Mongol princes, or those recognizing the 
superiority of the Manchu dynasty, or those who struggled for inde- 
pendence. After the death of the fifth Dalai Lama, for a period of 
forty years, the Dalai Lamas became the pretense of political intrigue 
of various power lovers until a series of historical events destroyed 
the power in Tibet of the Mongol and native princes, and until finally 
in the year 1751 the Dalai Lama was accorded the dominating power 
in matters religious and secular. The election of the Dalai Lama, 
up to the year 1822, the year of the election of the tenth incarnate, 
was based upon the prophecies of the highest Lamas and decision of 
the prophets, which is equivalent to an election by influential persons. 
But when the tenth incarnate was elected the system of the Emperor 
Tsien-lung, the casting of the vote by means of the so-called '' serbum," 
or ''the golden urn,*" was first applied. In this system the names of 
three candidates, determined by the former arrangeniimt, are written 
upon separate tickets and placed in the golden urn. This urn is set 
before the statue of Jovo-Sakyanuuii, and services are held there by 
deputies from the monasteries, praying for a righteous election. It 
is then carried over to Potala, to the palace of the Dalai Lama, and 



742 LHASA AND CENTRAL TIBET. 

there in front of a board upon which the Emperor's name is inscribed, 
in the presence of the highest authorities of Tibet and a deputation 
from the principal monasteries, the Manchu Amban, b}^ means of two 
chopsticks, draws out one of the tickets. He whose name is written 
upon the ticket is pkiced upon the Dakxi Lama throne. The election is 
confirmed by imperial decree, and the fortunate or unfortunate young- 
ster is brought into the place with great honors. From this time on 
he is accorded appropriate honors and worshipers tlock to him. In his 
3^outh he is taught reading and writing under the guidance of a special 
teacher — ioiu-tszini — selected from among the most learned famous 
Lamas. Then he is given a purely religious education, following the 
aboye-mentioned fiye sections with all their seven commentaries. For 
practical disputes one learned Lama is detailed from each of the theo- 
logical faculties of the three principal monasteries. These instruc- 
tors are called Tszang-skab-khanpo. Our Buriat countryman, Agvan 
Dorchzheyev, was one of these with the present Dalai Lama. 

After finishing the course of instruction he receives the highest 
degree in theology in the same manner as the other Lamas, but, of 
course, with a more liberal distribution of money to the monasteries 
and more careful (Questions on the part of the learned Lamas who dis- 
pute with him and who are appointed in advance. After this, when 
21 to 22 years old, the Dalai Lama enters the ripe and independent 
existence. Since 1806 five Dalai Lamas have reigned. The present 
incumbent, the thirteenth, Tubdan-Gyamtso, was born in 1876, so that 
now he is 27 3^ears old. About six or seven years ago he had a 
struggle with his regent, most famous of Tibetan hutuktu, "Demo," 
and came out victor, which no doubt saved him from the fate of his 
four predecessors, who perished at various ages, frequently the result 
of violence inflicted by regents or representatives of other pai'ties that 
were striving to remain longer close to the "power." The present 
Dalai Lama accused Demo of organizing plots against his life, confis- 
cated his immense wealth, and placed him under tu rigid home arrest 
in a separate room, where Demo was discovered suflocated one beauti- 
ful morning in the autumn of 1900. The Dalai Lama assumed the 
head rule of Tibet, and one of his conspicuous acts is the abolition of 
capital punishment, which was practiced extensivel}' by the regents. 
It seems in general that he is very energetic, and inclined to be a good 
man, with considerable love for knowledge. 

The second person of the lamaist hierarchy is the Panchen-Erdeni, 
who lives in a monastery in the provice of Tashilhunpo Tsang. The 
first Panchen-Erdeni was the Lama Lobzang Choigyi-Gyaltsan, who 
was born in 1570. This earnest Lama was the instructor of the 
fourth and fifth Dalai Lamas, when he pla3^ed an important role in 
political afl'airs, which served to enhance the power of the Dalai Lama. 
The official title, Panchen-Erdeni, and the imperial diploma and seal was 



LHASA AND CENTRAL TIBET. 743 

granted only the third Panchen, Pande-yeshe, in 1870 at an audience 
at Peking. At present the sixth incarnate lives; he was born in 1882, 
and is therefore 20 years old. 

The Panchen is next to the Dalai Lama in official capacity, but in 
the supervision of the laniaists he is considerabl}^ above him. because 
of his holiness. Especially is he regarded as the future king of the 
holy world "Shambala," in which he will be the principal leader. 

It is customary to call the Dalai Lama also ''Chyab-gong tham- 
chiid-mkhen-pa" (the omniscient — the object of faith), but the Tibetan 
applies this name to every eminent Lama incarnate he respects, since 
the charm of the Dalai Lama, as a holy individual, is less effective 
upon the religious feeling simply because of his distance than that 
of a Lama more easily approached, to whom he can appeal more often 
with inquiries relative to his religious requirements. The Dalai Lama, 
therefore, is known at places distant from Lhasa only as the principal 
ruler of Tibet, wdiile the religious sentiment of the laymen is directed 
toward their patron, regardless of the sect to which he belongs. 

The teachings of Tsongkapa now reign supremo in Central Tibet, but 
after the struggle during the first period of their introduction they 
arc now entirely reconciled and to a certain extent are indifferent 
toward other sects. The contemporary lamaist in general and the 
Tibetan in particular regard the objects of faith of the various sects 
with exactly the same reverence. Even the central government of 
Tibet, with the Dalai Lama at its head, frequently bows before the 
representatives of the old red-hat sect (the j^ellow-hat sect predomi- 
nates now). The laity does this, of course, out of ignorance and super- 
stition, but such explanation docs not appl}^ to the higher representa- 
tives of the yellow-hats, who are guided by Tsongkapa's way of look- 
ing at the world and possess a knowledge of the difference in the 
views of other sects. We believe that the conduct of these men 
toward other sects is inspired by political motives, the desire to satisfy 
the superstitious requirements of the populace, and to be vindicated 
in case of popular suffering and unfortunate political events. 

The central government of the land is in the hands of a council pre- 
sided over by the Dalai Lama, called '' deva-dzung." The principals in 
this council are four " kalons," or dignitaries, appointed by the Chinese 
Emperor, and their meetings arc held in a special office — ''kashag," or 
(executive house. They arc appointed from prominent aristocratic 
families, three of them civilians, the fourth a clergyman. For the 
local administration governors arc sent from the " deva-dzung,'' usually 
two in number with equal powers — one a clergyman, the otiier a civil- 
ian. Districts are frequently leased, the lessee ruling according to 
established custom, l)eing obliged to })ay into the treasury a certain 
sum of money or to pay in kind. Usually these lessees arc members

of the higher administration, and they send their own representatives 
into the districts. 

Of late the central government has apparently begun to strive to 
accumulate land, for which purpose it takes away strips of land from 
the monasteries under various pretenses or makes purchases on 
installment from the annual income. 

The affairs of Tibet in general are ruled by the hereditary aristoc- 
racy, whether it be the son who inherits his father's rights or the 
incarnate who inherits the rights of his predecessor. As the born 
aristocracy lives in strict isolation, not mingling with the common 
people, the central government, despite its deliberative character, may 
be called an aristocratic oligarchy. 

We stated that the Dalai Lama is the head of the central govern- 
ment. The question arises, Who takes his place in the interim 
between his death and the election of a new incarnate and until the 
latter becomes eligible? This question arose for the first time in 
1757, after the death of the seventh Dalai Lama, and was solved by 
the appointment of a regent by the Chinese Emperor under the official 
name "the director of the Dalai Lama's treasury,"''' with the title 
'' nonuui-khan.'"' In writing, the Tibetans refer to him as '' the Khan's 
viceroy" and in their daily conversation simply "the Til)etan khan." 
The tirst man appointed to the regency was the very eminent hutuktu 
"Demo," after whom other hutuktu were appointed. 

The tribunal and, in general, all administrative affairs are based on 
bribery, court examinations, on torture 1)}^ means of lashes and 
similar methods, cauterization by means of l^urning sealing wax being 
regarded as the most severe. The punishments are execution by 
drowning, imprisonment, banishment with giving away into slavery, 
blinding, amputation of the tingers, lifelong fetters and foot stock, 
and lashes. 

The permanent army, maintained ])y the treasury, consists of 4,000 
men. Its armament consists of spears, matchlock guns, and bows. 
For the protection of the body tlu\y have a helmet ornamented 
with feathers, a small plaited shield, and some wear armor. They 
are ofhcered b}^ "daipons," appointed from the higher aristocracy. 
The soldiers usually live in their homes in the villages and only peri- 
odicall}^ gather at posts, where they are inspected and taught to tire 
blank charges, and the use of the bows. The army is divided into 
cavalry and infantry. Despite the tendency of the Tibetans in the 
eastern provinces to indulge in pillage and highway robbery, the 
central Tibetan dislikes to make war; he is much more peace loving 
and more inclined toward peaceful labors, on account of which he 
regards military duty as superfluous and interfering with domestic 
pursuits. One frequently sees soldiers on the way from an inspection 
spin wool, .stitch shoes, turn a prayer wheel, or repeat their chaplet.

Speaking about the East Tibetan robber tribes, we must saj' they 
try to ]:)rey upon the goods of others Avithout bloodshed, tlireatening 
only the cowards. As soon as they see that the intended victims are 
determined to show serious resistance, they escape to their quarters. 
If one band of robbers strips a victim of everything, another band 
will cU)the him and supply him with food. 

The monasteries are governed l)y their own laws, administered by 
their own elders, the highest of which in the principal monasteries are 
appointed by the Dalai Lama. Discipline and the whole regime is 
based on " the fear of the governors." This fear must be manifested 
even on the street; a monk must not show himself before them on the 
street. When, on very exceptional occasions, he does meet them, he 
must lie down, wrap his head in his hood, and lie motionless as if dead. 
Justice is also ])ased principally on bribery, and the punishment is 
banishment from the monastery with a tine of money and lashes. The 
material condition of plain monks in Tibet is so bad that the convicted 
always prefers the punishment of the lash to fines. 

The foreign relations of Tibet are conducted with British India 
through Bhutan; with Kashmir through Ladak, and directl}' with 
Nepal, (]hina, and Mongolia. 

Ti))et imports from India, English materials, principalh' cheap 
cloths, enameled vessels, teapots, plates, and cups; objects of luxur\", 
as coral, amber, brocade; medicine and d3'e stuffs; and various I^ng- 
lish trinkets, such as mirrors, beads, jars, matches, penknives, etc. 
All these articles are imported by native Bhutanese, Nepalese, Kash- 
mii'i, and Chinese merchants. In general, the Tibetans are of late 
l)ocoming more and more fond of English products; the English rupees, 
too, are beginning to compete with the local coinage. The things 
exported to India are yak tails, sheeps' wool, borax, salt, silver and 
gold, yaks to a certain extent, and horses and mules brought over 
from northern China. 

From China the Tibetans import tea, which they love so well, china- 
ware, cotton and silk fabrics. From northern China, nuiles and horses 
are imported, and, to a limited extent, breeding asses. 

For use by the Chinese, Tibet exports little, and the considerable 
amount of native manufactured articles, together with those imported 
from India, that are exported there go to satisfy tlu^ demands of the 
Mongol lamaists. 

The articles exported arc various objects of cidt, as small statues, 
))ainted iiuiiges, I'cligious books, and prints made from carved wooden 
blocks, incense candles, ribbons, peacock feathers, leaf-shaped seeds 
" tsampaka," and similar articles that bring high prices only because 
of the piety of the Mongol lamaist and his reverence for holy things 
from Tibet. The more famous the person that produces these articles 



74fi LHASA AND CENTRAL TIBET. 

the more eagerl}" thev are purchased and the higher is the price 
paid. But Tibet also has a trade in cloths, in knit goods, and in 
the 3^ellow hats of the ecclesiastics, and this class of traffic, which 
depends upon the relig-ious sentiment of the purchasers, as is the case 
with presents to Tibetan lamas, attains a considerable sum annuall}'. 
The commerce in ordinary merchandise, however, scarcely exceeds 
$60,000. 

Since objects of cult are exported to Mongolia and since only the 
treasuries of incarnates and monasteries possess capital, the commercial 
caravans are fitted out exclusively by the treasuries of the Dalai Lama 
or other rich incarnates and by monaster}^ conuiiunities. The respon- 
.sible officers of the caravans are called ''tsonpons." The ''tsonpons" 
sent out by the Dalai Lama must double the original capital in three 
^^ears' time, which capital is estimated at a very inflated appraisal of 
the goods. Each succeeding "tsonpou'"' is the auditor of his prede- 
cessor — that is, he sees that the contract is fulhlled. 

Here and there the merchants in Mongolia, besides their commercial 
operations, make collections of contril)utions for one or another enter- 
prise of a monaster}" or an incarnate. If we add to this those immense 
sums that are being collected by famous and infamous lamas, whether 
they be invited to Mongolia or are there of their own accord, we can 
safel}" say that Mongolia to a considerable degree enriches Tibet. 

Up to a ver}^ recent period there were no relations between Tibet 
and Russia, although Buriats, who are Russian subjects, have for a 
long time made secret pilgrimages to Tibet, fearing oppression from 
the Russian administration, and entered Tibet under the assumed name 
of "Khalkhas"" Mongols, fearing exclusion as foreigners. About 
fifteen years ago *' Khalkhas " and Buriats belonging to one community 
in Brebung quarreled for some reason, and the former called the latter 
" Oros,'' or Russians. The matter reached the highest authorities, and, 
thanks to the able management of the affair by the Buriat lamas, it 
was established that, although the Buriats are Russian subjects, they 
are followers of the yellow-hat religion. The Khalkhas who raised 
the matter, having lost the trial, was obliged to leave the monastery, 
and the others received warning that they would be fined 5 lans (about 
$4) every time they call the Buriats "Oros." Russia can hardl}^ hope 
to obtain a profitable market for her goods in Tibet, but it will pay 
her to establish relations with Tibet because it is the center of lamaism, 
to which are chained the thoughts of cojitemporary Mongols, of whom 
there are about half a million, under the names of Buriats and Kalmuks, 
who are Russian subjects. 



A JOURNEY OF GEOGRAPHICAL AND ARCII.EOLOGICAL 
EXPLORATION IN CHINESE TURKESTAN/' 



By M. A. Stein, Ph. D., 
Indian Educational Service. 



Ill June, 1900, the government of India placed me on a year's special 
duty in order to enal)le me to carry out a long-cherished plan of 
archaeological explorations in the southern portion of Chinese Turke- 
stan and particularly in the region of Khotan. Many previous antiqua- 
rian tours in Kashmir, the Puiijah, and on the fascinating ground of the 
northwest frontier of India, had taught me the necessity of close topo- 
graphical observation as an important adjunct of historical research 
in those iields toward which, as an Indian archteologist, I felt most 
attracted. It was hence clear to me that the task awaiting me in 
Chinese Turkestan would have to comprise also surveying operations, 
such as are required for the accurate fixing of the position of ancient 
sites, and generally for the elucidation of the historical topograph}' 
of the country. But in addition I was anxious from the first to avail 
myself of the opportunities the journey might oti'er foi- geographical 
work of a more general character in regions that had so far remained 
without a proper survej'^ or altogether unexplored. 

The generous aid accorded to me by the Indian survey department 
made it ])ossible to carry on a continuous S3^stem of surveys, by plane- 
table, astronomical observations, and triangulation, throughout the 
course of my journey. Its results have been embodied in maps which 
are shortly to be published In- the trigonometrical ])ranch of the 
survey of India. These maps, as well as the detailed report of my 
explorations on which I am at present engaged under the orders of the 
India government, will, I hope, show that 1 have spared no eft'orts to 
utilize the opportunities oti'ered to me in the interest of geographical 
sci(uice. In the meantime, it is a source of sincere gratification to me 
that I am enabled, by the courtesy of your council, to place this suc- 
cinct account of my journey and labors before the Roj^al Geograph- 
ical Society, which, since the days of those great scholars. Sir Henry 
Rawlinson and Sir Henry Yule, has done so much to clear the way for 
the critical study of the ancient geography of India and Central Asia.

748 EXPLORATION IN OHINESE TURKESTAN. 

The plan of archaeological explorations al)out Khotan, and of the 
jonrney that was to lead to them, was first suggested to nie in the spring 
of 1S9T, })y a series of remarkable antiquarian acquisitions from that 
region. Among the papers left behind b}'^ that distinguished but ill- 
fated French traveler, M. Dutreuil de Rhins, there were found frag- 
ments of ancient birch-bark leaves, which had been acquired in the 
vicinit}^ of Khotan, and which proved to contain a Buddhist text in an 
early Indian script and language. On pu])lication the}' were soon rec- 
ognized as the oldest then known Indian manuscript, going back to 
the first centuries of our era. About the same time the " British col- 
lection of Central Asian antiquities," which had been formed at Cal- 
cutta with the assistance of the government of India in the foreign 
department, and under the care of Doctor Iloernle, the eminent indol- 
ogist, received from the same region very notable additions consisting 
of manuscripts, ancient potter}^, and other remains. These objects 
had been sold to the political representatives of the Indian govern- 
ment in Knshgar, Kashmir, and Ladak, as tinds made by native "treas- 
ure seekers" at ancient sites near Khotan and in the neighboring 
portions of the Taklamakan Desert. A curious feature of these acqui- 
sitions was that, bedsides undoubtedly ancient documents in Indian and 
Chinese characters, they contained a large proportion of manuscripts 
and "blockprints"'' in a surprising variety of entirel3Mudvnown scripts. 
While the materials thus accumulated, no reliable information w\as 
ever foi-thcoming as to the exact origin of the tinds or the character 
of the ruined sites which were supposed to have furnished them. 

No part of Chinese Turkestan had as yet l)een explored from an 
archaeological point of view, and, however much attention these dis- 
coveries attracted among competent European orientalists, it was 
evident that their full value for the ancient history and culture of 
Central Asia could never be realized without accurate researches on 
the spot. The practica))le nature of such investigations was proved 
by the memora])le march whicli Dr. Sven Iledin had made in the win- 
ter of 1895-9<) through the Taklamakan Desert northeast of Khotan, 
and of which the first accounts reached me in 1898. It had taken the 
famous Swedish explorer past two areas of sand-buried ruins, and, 
though his necessarily short halt at each had not permitted of an}" 
exact evidence being secured as to the character and date of the ruins, 
this discover}' amply sufficed to demonstrate both the existence and 
comparative accessibility of ancient sites likely to reward excava- 
tion. * * * 

By the middle of April, 1900, I was at last able to leave steamy and 
overcivilized Calcutta for Kashmir, where I completed the outtit and 
transport arrangements needed for my caiup. The many tours I had 
made during pi-evious years through the mountains in and about 
Kashmir had furnished me with sufficient practical experience to enable 



EXPLORATION IN CHINESE TURKESTAN. 749 

mc to anticipate with fair aet-iiracy the coiidition.s of transport and 
supplies on a great part of the travels before nie. The government 
of India had granted nie permission to use the route through Gilgit 
and Hunza for the journey to Kashgar, which was to form my proxi- 
mate goal. By the end of May the snow on the mountain ranges 
between Kashmir and Gilgit had melted sufficientlj^ to make the 
attempt of crossing the passes with laden animals just practicable. 
By that time, too, the subsurveyor's little party, and another Turki 
servant sent by Mr. Macartney, the British political agent in Kashgar, 
had joined me, and all requisite stores and equipment had been duly 
collected and packed. Owing to the quantity of scientific instruments, 
photographic glass plates, etc., to be carried, and to the provision 
that had to be made for stores of all kinds in view of the distances 
likely to separate us thereafter from civilized "bases of supply," m}^ 
caravan numbered 16 baggage animals when it set out on the morning 
of May 31 from Bandipur, the little port on Volur Lake and the 
starting point of the "" Gilgit Transport Road." 

Though the snow still la}" deep and the weather was trying, the Trag- 
bal and Burzil passes (approximately 12,000 and 13,000 feet above the 
sea, respectively) were crossed without mishap. Pushing on l)y rapid 
marches through the Dard vallej^s of Astor, imposing in their barren 
grandeur, and across the rock-bound bed of the Indus near Bunji, we 
reached the Gilgit cantonment on June 11. Fresh transport arrange- 
ments necessitated a short halt at this last outpost of Anglo-Indian 
civilization. Thanks to the kind offices of Capt. J. Manners Smith, 
V. C, C. I. E., then political agent at Gilgit, I was there able not onl}'^ 
to make good various small defects in the equipment of mj^ caravan, 
but also to collect interesting information concerning the customs and 
traditions of the Dard p()]iulation inhabiting these valleys. The Dards 
deserve, indeed, to be treatinl with respect by the historical student 
and ethnographist, for their tri])es have clung to this forbidding 
ground of bleak rock}" gorges and ice-crowned ranges ever since tlie 
days of Ilerodotos. Ancient, like the mountains themselves, looks 
the race, with its sharply defined ethnic characteristics and language. 

On June 15 I started from Gilgit filled with a grateful recollection 
of the kind help and hospitality which I had enjoyed among the last 
British officers I was to see for some time. Marching round the mighty 
Imttresses of Mount Rakiposhi(with its highest needle-like peak soar- 
ing to an elevation of over 25,000 feet) and through mountain scenery 
that under a sky of dazzling clearness looked as grand as any I have 
ever seen in the Himalaya, we passcnl on the third day into the terri- 
tory of the chiefs of Hnnzaand Nagir. C-lose to the hill fort of Nilth, 
famous for th(» ])riiliant little campaign of LS1»1, I visited with interest 
the deep-cut gorge descending from a glacier of llakiposhi, where 
Captain Manners Smith climbed the most precipitous clifi's Avith his

handful of Gurkhas and Dog-ras, and. tinally breaking- the resistance of 
the Kanjuti hill men, won his Victoria cross. It was pleasant to note 
that the ]»rave mountaineers who were vanquished here looked bade 
upon this daring exploit of their (juondam foe and conqueror with 
almost as much pride as if it had been performed by their own side. 
A short distance higher up the valle}", near the village of Thol, I 
noticed a well preserved little stupa, a monument of those early cen- 
turies when this secluded valley, like the rest of the difficult hill tracts 
farther Avest, held a population attached to Buddha's faith. Was it 
the .same small Kanjuti race, puzzling by its complete isolation in 
regard to language and ethnic origin, which now occupies Hunza? 

At Aliabad, near the capital of the Huiiza chief, 1 spent two days 
busily occupied with the rearrangement of all loads for transport by 
coolies; for the difficult mountain tracks by which alone the Tagh- 
dumbash Pamii' can be approached during the sununer months, from 
the side of llunza, are absolutely impassable for any beast of burden. 
Acting on th(> instructions kindly sent in advance by the political agent 
at Gilgit, Wazir llumayun, the energetic chief adviser of Muhammad 
Nazim, the present Mir of Hunza, had made ample preparations for 
the trying route ahead. It was difficult to realize that this little 
mountain chieftainship was, until ten years ago, by reason of the free- 
booting and slave-raiding expeditions which it sent forth — and Wazir 
Humayun himself had led more than one successful raid of this kind — 
the terror of all neighboring regions. 

On June 20 I moved my camp to Baltit, where I i)aid a return visit 
to the INIir in his old and highly picturesque castle. 1 was interested 
to note in the carved woodwork of mosques and other structures dec- 
orative elements of ancient Indian type, while in the furniture and 
tittings of the Mir's residence modern central Asian and Chinese inliu- 
ences were plainly discernible. On the following day we commenced 
on foot the series of trying marches up the gorge of the Hunza River. 
The winter route, which crosses the river bed at fre([uent intervals, 
had ])ecome wholly impracticable, owing to the melting snows and the 
swollen state of the river. The |)recipitous mountain spurs and the 
great glaciers descending to the left bank of the river had daily to be 
crossed by tracks which may rightly be described as a succession of 
Alpine climbing tours of a decidedly tiring nature. They often led 
over narrow rock ledges and by rough ladder-like galleries (raflk) along 
the faces of cliffs, where the carrying of loads would be nervous work 
for any but such extraordinarily sure-footed and active hill men as the 
people of Hunza. Frequent enough were the places where even ray 
little fox terrier, accustomed to rough climbs from many a tour with 
his master, had to be picked up and carried. 

Toiling along these precipices, amidst scenery truly inspiring in its 
rugged splendor, I was often reminded of the vivid accounts which 



EXPLORATION IN CHINESE TURKESTAN. 751 

Fa-hien and other ancient Buddhist pilgrims from China have left us 
of their experiences on the journe}" through the gorges of the Indus. 
From Ghulmit, the second stage onward, the scanty settlers occupy- 
ing the few patches of cultivated ground in the valley proved to be of 
Iranian origin, speaking a Wakhi dialect closely allied to that which 
is used b}' the Wakhan immigrants found in Sarikol. Thus, in this 
part of the Hindukush, too, the line of contact between the great areas 
of the Indian and Iranian families of language does not completely 
coincide with the geographical watershed. 

After six days spent in more or less continuous climbing, Misgar, 
the northernmost hamlet of Ilunza, was reached, where I was able to 
discharge the hardy hill men who had carried our impedimenta without 
the slighest damage over such trying ground. On June 28 at last I 
crossed, by the Kilik Pass (circ. 15,800 feet above the sea), into Chinese 
territory' on the Taghdumbash Pamir, using the 3'aks of the Sarikoli 
herdsmen, who, by Mr. Macartney's arrangement with the Chinese 
authorities, had awaited me at tlie southern foot of the pass. 

From Koktorok, our lirst camp on the Taghdumbash, at an elevation 
of over 11,000 feet, we commenced our plane-table survey, on the 
scale of 8 miles to the inch. Throughout our travels in the mountains 
I endeavored to supplement it, as far as ni}" limited time permitted, by 
photogrammetric work, for which I used the excellent Bridges-Lee 
photo theodolite kindly lent tome by Mr. Eliot, the head of the Indian 
meteorological department. Systematic triangulation ])y theodolite 
was started at the same time with the help of the points supplied b}^ 
the surve3's of the l)Oundary commission and Captain Deasy, while 
regidar astronomical obser\'ations for latitude were made ])y Babu 
Ram Singh from here onward at all camps, the exact determination of 
which possessed topographical interest. The constant and direct super- 
vision which I exercised over the plane-table work enabled me to pay 
special attention to the local nomenclature. A good deal of })hilo- 
logical and historical interest attaches to the latter in regions like the 
Pamirs and a considera))le portion of Chinese Turkestan, over which 
have passed the waves of great ethnic migrations. I believe, there- 
fore, students interested in this part of central Asian geography will 
derive some advantage from the pains I took to correctly ascertain and 
to record with phonetic accuracy all local names throughout the terri- 
tories covered l)v our surveys. 

From the height of the Khushbel peak, the first •'hill station"' of 
our survey (close on 17,000 feet above the sea), I could simultaneously 
see the ranges which form the watershed between the drainage areas 
of the Indus, the Oxus, and the Yarkand rivers, and which politically 
divide the territories of British India, Russia, and China, Afghanistan 
(pi. i). Pressed for time, as I necessarily was in regard to all that 



752 EXPLORATION TN (!HTNESJ: TURKESTAN. 

touched my topoonipliical interest>^, I could not resist the temptation 
of pushing westward, at least as far as the Wakhjir Pass, which leads 
from the Taohdumhash Pamir to tlie headwaters of the Oxus. Camp- 
inij- cl()S(^ to the summit of the ^Vakhjir Pass (circ. ir),2<>0 feet), 1 visited 
on July 2 the head of the Ab-i Panja Valley, near the great glaciers 
which Lord Curzon first demonstrated to be tlie true source of the 
river Oxus. It was a strange sensation for me in this desolate moun- 
tain waste to know that I stood at last at the eastern threshold of that 
distant region, including Bactria and the upper Oxus Valley, which, as 
a fi(d(l of ex[)loration, has attracted me ever since I was a boy. It was 
the thi'cshold oidy 1 had reached, and I knew that this time there was 
no entrance for me into the forbidden land. Notwithstanding its 
great elevation the Wakhjir Pass and its approaches, both from the 
west and east, are comparativel}^ easy. Comparing the topographical 
features with the itinerary indicated by Hiuen Tsiang, the great Chi- 
nese pilgi'im, 1 am led to conclude that the route which he followed 
when traveling, aliout A. D. 649, on his return from India, through 
the \all(\v of Pa-mi-Io (Pamir) into SariUol, actually traversed this 
pass. 

As I marched down the gradually widening valley of the Taghdum- 
bash Pamir toward Tashkui-ghan, the chief place of the Sarikol dis- 
trict, I fully realized the contrast which its expanses of comparatively 
rich grazing ofi'er to the I'ocky destitution of the Hunza gorges. 
Increasing numbers of nomadic herdsmen, both Kirghiz and Wakhi, 
now frequent the valley, which was an utterly deserted waste, and 
rarely used, even as a route, while there were Hunza raiding parties 
ready to swoop down from the mountain fastnesses southward. 

I also felt glad to be once more on the track of Hiuen Tsiang, wdiose 
footsteps T had traced to so many a sacred Buddhist site of ancient 
Indiii. The position and remains of Tashkurghan were found to agree 
most closely with th(^ description which Hiuen Tsiang and the earlier 
Chinese pilgritn, Sung-yun, give of the capital of the ancient Kie-pan-to. 
The identification of the latter territory with the modern Sarikol, first 
suggested ])y Sir Henry Yule, was thus fully established. The ruined 
town, which extends round the modern Chinese fort of Tashkurghan, 
and still shows a (juadrangular inclosure of crumbling stone walls, 
"rests on a great rocky crag, and is backed by the river Sita"" (i, e., 
the Yarkand River), on the east, exactly as the ])ilgrims describe it. 
As a striking instance of the tenacity of local tradition, it deserves to 
})e mentioned that I found the curious legend which Hiuen Tsiang 
relates of the princess imprisoned in ancient days on a rock fastness 
still clinging to the identical locality of this valley. 

I believe that Tashkurghan, as an historical site, has claim to even 
greater anticiuity than that implied l)v the notices of Miucn Tsiang 
and Sung-yun. Nature itself has plaiidy marked it not only as the 



EXPLORATION IN OHINESK TURKESTAN. 753 

administrativo center for the \ iille3',s of the Sarikol region, but also as 
the most convenient place for trade exchange on an ancient and once 
important route connecting- great portions of Central Asia with the 
Far East and West. Judging from local observations, evervthing 
tends to support the view first expressed by Sir Henry Rawlinson that 
Tashkurghan, "the stone tower," retains the position as well as the 
name of the XiBivoc; nvpyoz^ which Ptolem}^ and, before him, ISIarinus 
of Tyre, the geographer, knew as the emporium of the extreme 
western frontier of Serike — i. e. , the Central Chinese dominions. From 
Tashkurghan the road lies equally open to Kashgar and Khotan, and 
thus to both the great trade routes which led in ancient times and 
during the Middle Ages from Turke.stan into the interior of China. 
At Tashkurghan, also, the two best lines of comnumication across the 
Pamirs converge, the Taghdumbash Valle}^ which gives access to the 
upper Oxus, being met here by the route which leads over the Naiza- 
Tash pass toward the "Great Pamir" and thence down to Shighnan. 

In order to extend our survey over ground that was geographically 
interesting, I chose for our further march to Kashgar the route which 
passes through the high valleys between the Russian Pamirs and the 
western slopes of the great transverse range of Muztagh-Ata. On 
flul}^ 13 1 had reached the shores of the "Little" Karakul Lake, at the 
northern foot of the "father of ice mountains," and about 11,000 feet 
above sea level, where I found a fairly large encampment of nomadic 
Kirghiz. The ample supply of sturd}^ yaks which we ol)tained from 
them greatly facilitated transport arrangements. It thus became pos- 
sible within the comparatively short time available to establish a series 
of excellent survey stations on various high spurs descending from 
Muztagh-Ata. They ena])led us to extend the triangulation brought 
up from the Taghdumbash to the great glacier-crowned ranges facing 
Muztagh-Ata from the north and northeast and overlooking the "Lit- 
tle" Karakul Lake. (PI. i.) 

Their main peaks, though rising to over 23,000 feet, remain below 
the elevation of Muztagh-Ata. Yet these mighty walls of ice and 
snow, stretching their crest line of dazzling whiteness for a distance 
of at least 24 miles, and streaked by numerous great glaciers, appeared 
perhaps even more awe inspiring than the grand ice-girt dome of 
Muztagh-Ata itself (pi. ii). Our stay in the midst of this mountain 
world fell in what was i)rob!ibly the most favorable season; yet the hours 
when any considerable portion of the panorama was clear of clouds • 
and driving rain or snow were few indeed. Notwithstanding the rapid 
changes of the atmos[)heric conditions and the difficulty of working a 
delicate instrument on heights ever exposed to cutting winds at tem- 
peratures that readily fell })elow freezing point, the Bridges- Lee photo- 
theodolite proved very useful for ri^cording topographical details. 
From the rounds of phototheodolite \iews which were secured by me 



754 EXPLORATION IN CHINESE TURKESTAN. 

at a scries of excellent survey stations, Lieutenant Tillard, R. E., of 
the trig'onometrical branch ofHce of the survey of India, succeeded in 
constructing- a map of the Muztagh-Ata region on the enhirged scale 
of 4 miles to the inch, which shows much additional detail. It will be 
published along with the general njap embodying our survey. But 
both the taking of the phototheodolite views and the working out of 
the results has absorbed a great amount of time and labor, and refer- 
ence to the plane-table sections has, I believe, often been found indis- 
pensable in plotting. 

For the purpose of the phototheodolite surve}'', and also in order to 
gain some closer personal experience of the ''father of ice-mountains," 
I made on July 18-19 two ascents on the western slopes of the central 
mass of Muztagh-Ata. The route chosen lay up the ridge which flanks 
the Yambulak glacier from the north, and, as seen from below, seemed 
to ascend unbroken to the northern of the twin peaks of the great 
mountain. It was by the same route that Dr. Sven Hedin, in the course 
of his explorations of 1894, had reached his highest point. But since 
the visit of the great Swedish traveler, the physical conditions on the 
surface of the ridge seem to have undergone a considerable change for 
the worse. At the time of his ascents the ridge appears to have been 
bare of snow up to an elevation estimated at over 20,000 feet, and 
consequently it had been possible to use yaks both for riding and 
transport. I found the ridge from about 1 5,500 feet upward enveloped 
by heavy masses of snow, which seem likely to transform themselves 
gradually into a mantle of ice, such as lies over the other elevated 
slopes of the mountain. Only on the very edge of the precipitous 
rock wall b}' which the ridge falls otf toward the Yambulak glacier 
small patches of rock protruded here and there from the deep snow. 
Above 17,000 feet even these disa[)pearcd, and at a])out the same 
height it was necessary to leave behind the yaks, which, foundering 
constantly in the deep snow, had become useless. 

On the opposite side of the glacier the. southern wall of rock is 
topped ))y a thick layer of ice to a far lower point, and consequently 
little avalanches would be seen gliding down from it as the day wore 
on. Luckily, on our side the glittering snow sheet over which we 
ascended seemed to rest as yet firmly on the rock. The weather was 
by no means favorable, and on the second da}" we had to contend with 
frequent gusts of violent wind, and with occasional showers of snow. 
The maxinumi elevation I then reached was, by the evidence of the 
hypsometrical readings, within a few feet of 20,000 feet. It had taken 
nearly eight hours of constant toil to attain it from my camp, pitched 
at an elevation of over 15,000 feet. The couple o,f Kirghiz who 
could be induced to set out with us were, curiously enough, first 
seized by mountain sickness, and had to be left behind with their yaks. 
At an elevation of about 19,000 feet, Ham Singh, the subsurveyor,

was obliged to stay behind, overcome by headache and lassitude. Next 
Ajab Khan, the active Puniali, who had accompanied me as an orderly 
from Gilgit, fell out, and ultimately only the two splendid men of the 
"Hunza levies," who had been selected for me by the Mir of Hunza, 
and had proved most useful as guides, plodded on with me. 

The previous da}", while engaged in phototheodolite work, 1 had 
sent them ahead to reconnoiter the ridge. Excellent climbers as they 
are, they had then reached a point apparently about 2,()0<) feet higher 
up. Their progress was there stopped by a sheer precipice of impass- 
able rocks descending to what I conclude to be a transverse glacier 
previously hidden from view, separating the great ridge we followed 
from the main mass of the northern summit, and communicating north- 
ward with the Kampar-kishlak glacier. Owing to the threatening 
aspect of the weather, I had to forego the attempt, which our bodily 
condition would have otherwise well permitted, of reaching this farthest 
accessible point of the ridge. I was thus unable to judge with my own 
eyes of the true mountaineering difficulties that would have to be faced 
in the event of a S3^stematic effort being made to climb the northern 
summit from this side. An ample allowance of time, a good Swiss 
guide or two, and a sufficient number of hardy Hunza mountaineers 
to carry loads, would seem to me indispensable provisions for such an 
effort. ^ 

As we descended, the clouds lifted toward the west and revealed a 
panorama vast and impressive beyond description. It extended prac- 
tically across the whole breadth of the Pamir region. Far away to 
the southwest it was bounded by glittering pinnacles, in which I could 
recognize the mountain giants that guard the approach to the Indus 
Valley. They had worthy rivals to the north in some towering masses 
of ice and snow, which I could not fail to identify with Mount Kauf- 
mann and other great peaks of the trans-Alai range. 

The night, which I passed uncomfortable enough in my tent, pitched 
with difficulty at an elevation of about 16,500 feet, brought fresh snow 
with driving gales, and after vainly waiting next day for a cliange, I 
was forced to descend once more toward Lake Karakul. Before 
leaving this inhospitable, yet so fascinating, neighborhood, I had the 
satisfaction to ascertain that the Kirghiz legend of a hoary saint (Fir) 
mysteriously residing on the inaccessible heights of the great ice moun- 
tain, still retains distinct features of the "old story" which Iliuen 
Tsiang heard of the giant Buddist hermit who was seen entranced "on 
a great mountain covoivd witii brooding vapors.'" evidentl}' identical 
with Muztagh-Ata. 

On July 23 I started down on to the ])hiins of KashgiU' by tlie route 
of the Gez deHh>. Owing to the collapse of one of the bridges in this 
remarkably narrow and difficult gorge, 1 was obliged to make a con- 
siderable detour, which entailed the crossing" of the huffe Koksel or 



756 KXI»L0RATI01Sr TN CHINESE TURKP:STA]S". 

Sarguluk g-lacier descending- northward from tlic groat range we had 
surveyed l)cfore from the side of Lake Karakul. The lower portion of 
the defile was rendered altogether impassable by the summer floods of 
the g'lacier-fed Yamanyar River. So 1 had to take to the difficult track" 
known as Tokuz-Dawan, "■ the Nine Passes,'" and barel}^ passable for 
laden animals, which crosses a series of steep transverse spurs descend- 
ing from the little-known eastern slopes of the great snowy range 
])ehind j\Iuztagh-Ata. Leaving the sub-surveyor and heavy l)aggage 
to follow by easier stages, 1 pushed on ])y rapid marches, and after a 
finishing march of some 50 miles from Tashmalik, on Jul}^ 2!) arrived 
at Kashgai'. 

There, under the hospitable roof of Mr. G. Macartney, C. 1. E., the 
political representative of the Lidian Government, the kindest recep- 
tion awaited me. After fully two months of fatiguing and almost 
incessant travel in the mountains I felt the need of some })odily rest 
before I could set out again for Khotan, the proper goal of my explo- 
rations. J5ut my four weeks' stay in Kashgar was mainly accounted 
for l)}^ other and more pressing- considerations. In view of the wide 
extent of the area that was to l)e covered by my travels within a period 
practically limited to one autumn and winter, the careful organization 
of my caravan was a nrdtter of nuich importance. In this respect the 
experienced advice of Mr. Macartney and the practical assistance of his 
establishment were of great value to me. It was essential to limit the 
baggage with a view to rapidity of movement, and at the same time to 
insure that all stores and equipment required during- prolonged travels, 
and under widely varying conditions, should be kept readily available. 
I found that, including riding animals for myself and followers, 8 
camels and 12 ponies would ])e needed for ni}^ caravan. The trouble 
taken a))out their selection was amply repaid by the result; for, not- 
withstanding the fatigues entailed ])y our subsequent travels, which 
covered an aggregate of over 3,000 miles, none of the animals 1 brought 
from Kashgar ever broke down. In the same way the numl)er of fol- 
lowers was kept down to the indispensable mininmm, the party includ- 
ing 2 camelmen, 2 pony attendants (one of whom had to act also as 
Chinese interpreter), a cook, and a personal servant for myself. Apai't 
from the subsurveyor's Rajput cook, who had accompanied us from 
India, all the men came from Kashgar or Yarkand. 

An important object of m}' stay at Kashgar was to familiarize the 
provincial Chinese Government with the purpose and character of ni}^ 
intended explorations. Mr. Macartney's eflbrts in this direction were 
entirely successful, owing mainly to the great personal influence and 
respect he enjoys among- all Chinese dignitaries of the province. The 
result showed that from the Tao-tai, or provincial governor, down- 
ward, all Chinese officials I came in contact with wei'e ready and 
anxious to render me whatever help la}- in their power. I look back 



EXPLORATION IN CHINESE TURKESTAN. 757 

to their invuriahle kindness and attention with all the more gratitude, 
as it was shoN\'n at a time when, as the}^ knew well, the conflict with 
European powers Avas convulsing the Empire in the East. 

Such imperfect explanations and illustrations as, with an interpreter's 
help, I could give of the historical connection of ancient Indian culture 
and Buddhist religion with Central Asia, probably helped to dispel any 
doubts and suspicions which might otherwise have been roused by the 
intended excavations, etc. In this respect I found m}^ references to the 
8i-yu-ki, the records of Iliuen Tsiang's travels, singularly helpful. 
All educated Chinese officials seem to have read or heard legendary 
accounts of the famous Chinese pilgrim's visit to the Buddhist king- 
doms of the "western countries." In my intercourse with them I 
never invoked in vain the memory of " the great monk of the Tang 
dynasty (Tang-Sen)," whose footsteps I was now endeavoring to trace 
in Turkestan, as I had done before in more than one part of India. 

Busily engaged as I was during my stay at Kashgar with practical 
preparations, I managed also to survey a number of instructive ancient 
remains, chietly ruins of Buddhist Stupas, in the vicinity, and to con- 
tinue my studies of Turki. On September 111 finally set out on the 
journey to Khotan. Choosing for the first portion of the march the 
track which crosses the region of moving sands around the popular 
shrine of Ordam-Padshah, I was able to fix the position of that curi- 
ous pilgrimage place more accurately than is shown in existing maps. 
From Yarkand onward I followed the ordinary caravan route, which 
leads along the southern edge of the great desert, and mostly through 
barren, uninhabited wastes of sand or gravel, toward Khotan. For 
me it had a special historical interest; a variety of antiquarian and topo- 
graphical observations which 1 was able to make proved beyond doubt 
that we were moving along the identical great thoroughfare by which 
in earlier times the trade from the Oxus and the Far West passed to 
Khotan and on to China. 

It is impossible to refer here in detail to au}^ of this evidence. But 
I may brief! 3^ mention at least the curious patches of ground frequently 
passed on the route beyond Guma, where the eroded loess is thickly 
strewn with fragments of coarse pottery, bricks, slag, and similar 
refuse, marking the sites of villages and hamlets long ago abandoned. 
Such debris areas, locally known as "tatis," are to be found in many 
places beyond the present limits of cultivation in the Avhole Khotan 
region; in some places they extend over whole scjuare miles. They 
exhibit everywhere most striking evidence of the powerful erosive 
action of the winds and sand storms which sweep over the desert and 
its outskirts for long periods of the spring and summer. The above- 
named fragments rest 011 nothing Init natui'al loess, either hard or more 
or less disintegrated. Having alone survived l)y tiie hardness and 
weight of their material, these fragments sink lower and lower as the

erosion of the ground beneath proceeds, while everything in the shape 
of mud walls, sun burnt bricks, timber, etc., as used in the construc- 
tion of Turkestan houses, has long ago deca3^ed or been swept awa3\ 

On October 12 I reached Khotan town, the present capital of the 
territory which was to form the special held for my archaeological 
explorations. I had entered the oasis on the preceding daj" with some 
feeling of emotion; for even before the discoveries that rewarded ui}^ 
labors there was much to suggest the important part played b}^ this 
little kingdom in that most fascinating chapter of ancient history which 
witnessed the interchange of the cultures of India, China, and the classi- 
cal West. 1 lost no time before commencing the local in([uiries which 
were to guide me as to the sites particularly deserving exploration. 
Apprehensions about possible forgeries, which experience proved to 
have been fully justitied, had prevented me from sending in advance 
information as to the object of my journey. I now found that some 
time would have to be allowed for the collection of specimens of antiq- 
uities from the various old sites which Khotan "treasure seekers" were 
in the habit of visiting. I was glad to utilize the interval for a geo- 
graphical task which I knew to possess special interest. 

That portion of the Kuen-luen Range which contains the headwaters 
of the Yurung-kash or Khotan River had never l^een properly sur- 
ve^^ed, the only availal)le information being contained in the sketch 
map of the route by which Mr. Johnson, in 1805, had made his way 
from Ladak down to Khotan. Colonel Trotter had alread}^, in 187.5, 
expressed the l)elief that the headwaters of the Yurung-kash were 
much farther to the east than shown in that map, and probably identi- 
cal with a stream rising on the high plateau south of Polu. Captain 
Deas}', working from the side of Polu, in 1898, succeeded in reaching 
the sources of this stream at an elevation of close on 10,000 feet, but 
was prevented from following it downward. Thus the true course 
of the main feeder of the Yurung-kash, together with most of the 
orograph}' of the surrounding region, still remained to l)e explored. 

On October 17 I started with the lightest possible equipment for 
the mountains. Pan-Darin, the am})an of Khotan, had, during the 
few days of my halt, done all that was needed to facilitate ni}' arrange- 
ments for transport and supplies, and to assure me local assistance. 
Subsequent experience showed that I had found in this amiable and 
learned mandarin a true and reliable friend, thoroughly interested in 
my work, and ever ready to help me with all that was in his power. 
I feel convinced that without his active cooperation, and subsequently 
that of his Keriya colleague, neither the tour through the mountains 
nor the explorations in the desert could have been accomplished. 

The valley of the Y^urung-kash becomes impassable within one march 
of its debouchure. There, near the small villages of Jamada and 
Kumat, the precious jade is dug, from which the river takes it name — 



EXPLORATION IN CHINESE TURKESTAN. 759 

'Svhite jado." Hence the route to Karanghu-tagh, the southernmost 
inhabited place, leads over a series of more or less parallel ranges that 
separate side valleys draining from the east. These outer ranges, 
rising in a succession of plateaus fissured bj'' deep winding ravines, 
exhibit in a most striking form the results of that extreme disinte- 
gration which is the characteristic feature of the whole mountain sys- 
tem. Nothing but loose earth, gravel, or conglomerate in the last 
stage of decomi)osition is to be seen on the surface of the hillsides; 
while their high elevation and the dryness of the climate prevent the 
growth of any but the scantiest vegetation in rare patches of low, 
tough grass. The effects of the dust haze which rises so constantly 
over the desert plains were still sufiicientl}' marked to prevent any distant 
view being obtained from the Ulugh Dawan, by which we crossed 
the Tikelik Kange at an elevation of about l-?,()()0 feet. But from the next 
range, between the valleys of Buj'a and Pisha, a very extensive pan- 
orama opened out before us. 

In a grand mountain mass raising its glacier-crowned head in solitary 
splendor to the southeast, it was impossible to mistake the '* Kuen-luen 
peak. No. 5," already triangulated from the Ladak side (pi. ii). Behind 
this great mountain, for which the tables snpplii^d by the survc}" depart- 
ment indicated a height of 28,81H> feet, to the south and southeast 
there was to be seen a magnificent line of high snowy peaks marking 
the watershed toward the westernmost portion of the Aksai-chin 
plateau of Tibet. It soon l)ecame clear that the Yurung-kash has cut 
its way between the main range and the great mass of " K5," or Muz- 
tagh ("the ice mountain," k^t'' fWoj/^K, as it is called by the few 
Taghliks of these valleys). Its course is indicated l>y a gap l)etween 
the stupendous spurs which descend from Muztagh, and from the 
almost equally high peaks on the watershed range, and could, in the 
remarkal)ly clear atmosphere that favored us, be made out for a con- 
siderable distance to the southeast. It was found to run exactly in 
the direction Avhere Captain Deasy had traced the real source of the 
river. In other respects, too, the orographical features actually before 
us differed strikmgly from those which the above-mentioned sketch 
map had led me to expect. 

The next outer range, which was crossed at an elevation of close on 
11,000 feet, offered a still better view of this magnificent piiiioiama. 
But vainly I searched the crest line for other peaks which could ])e 
identified with points already triangulated from the Ladak side, and 
which would thus secure to us the eagerly sought connection with the 
Indian trigonometrical system. The descent which followed, of some 
6,000 feet, to the deep rock-bound gorge of the Yurung-kash, was by 
its steepness and ruggedness an experience long to be remembered, 
especially as night overtook us. The track was almost impracticable

for our bagg-age ponies. Fortunately it was possible to replace them 
by yaks at Karangliu-tagh, a small settlement of herdsmen which, 
owing to its inaccessibility, is also used as a penal station for select 
malefactors from Khotan. * ' Karanghu-tagh " literally means ' ' moun- 
tain of l)linding darkness "' — a fitting enough name for this terribly 
bleak place of ])anishment. The Kash Riyer, on wdiich it lies, is fed by 
a series of great glaciers on the main range to the soutli, and joins the 
Yurung-kash a few miles below the hamlet. 

Leaving the ponies and whateyer of baggage could l)c spared at 
Karanghu-tagh, I endeayored to follow up the gorge of the Yurung- 
kash as far as possil)le toward the head of the river. The hilhnen 
knew of no track beyond a point known as " Issik-l)ulak/"' from its 
hot-spring. There the river, unfordable even late in the autumn, fills 
completely the narrow passage it has cut round the mighty southern 
buttresses of "Kuen-luen No. 5," and progress becomes impossible, 
even for yaks. Accompanied by Ram Singh and a couple of Taghliks, 
I penetrated, on Octolier 27, a few miles farther into the gorge, 
climbing with difficulty along the precipitous clift's which face the 
frowning ridges on the south. But no track could be discovered prac- 
ticable for load-carrying men, and ultimately I had to turn back. It 
was impossil)le for me to wait for the chance of the river getting com- 
pU'tely frozen. Even then I doubt whether a practicable passage could 
be secured, considering the rigors of the winter and the masses of 
fallen rock likely to be encountered. It is from the higli hut com- 
paratiyeh" open ground ni^ar the sources far away to the southeast 
that the uppermost portion of the rivi'r coui'se will have finally to be 
explored. 

From Karanghu-tagh we proceeded to the northwest by a difficult 
route, which forms the only connection of the valley with the outer 
world l)esid(\s that we had come l)y. It required a good deal of nego- 
tiation and "demiofficial"" pressure before the surh' hillmen of 
Karanghu-tagh would supply guides and j^aks for it. The inhospital)le 
mountain tract into which it took us had so far remained wholly 
unexplored. 

OA'er a succession of high transverse ranges we crossed into the val- 
leys of Nissa and Chash. By camping close to the passes we managed 
to clind) to some excellent survey stations, particularly on the Brinjak 
ridge, some 15,300 feet above the sea. The views I obtained there 
will show, better than any description could, the weird grandeur of 
this mountain scenery. Below a glacier-clad crest line, of an approxi- 
mate height of 20,000 feet, there rise in all directions fantastically 
serrated ridges, with deep gorges between them, like the waves of an 
angry sea. Exceptionally clear weather favored us; but the increasing 
cold and the exposure inevitable on such elevated ground made surve}'^ 
work, especiall}^ with the ])hototheodolite, very trying. (PI. iii). 



EXPLORATION IN CHINESE TURKESTAN. 761 

Be3'ond the Yagan-Dawan Pass, by which I crossed into the drainage 
area of the Kara-kash ("black jade'') Kiver, I had ample opportunity 
to observe the extraordinary results produced b^^ erosion on mountain 
formations subject to excessive disintegration (pi. iii). It appeared to 
me that only the erosive action of water could liave produced that 
perfect maze of deep-cut arid gorges through which we had to wind 
our wa3^ Yet in this very region the fall of rain and snow is now 
ver}" scanty, and the consequent absence of water is a serious obstacle 
for the traveler. Luckily, we could overcome it by the transport 
of ice. 

I had almost despaired of connecting our survey work with the 
Indian triangulation, when unexpectedly the last range we had to 
cross toward the plains revealed a view more extensive than any 
before. Among the many high snowy peaks visible southward, and 
also beyond the upper Kara-kash River, two more triangulated points, 
besides "Kuen-luen No. 5," could be identified with certainty. It 
thus became possible to determine our position on the Ulughat-Dawan, 
close on 10,000 feet above the sea, by theodolite and to measure angles 
to all prominent heights of the ranges within view. To the north 
there extended, boundless like the sea, the vast plain of the desert. 
The light dust haze covering it looked beautiful as it reflected the 
brilliant moonlight of that first night I spent on the pass waiting for 
the arri\al of water. The dinner for which it was needed, did not get 
ready till 2 a. m. I knew that a wind raising the haze would effec- 
tivel}" stop further surve}^ work. So I hurried to reach another high 
ridge farther east, with an equally extensive view, that would allow 
us to complete the triangulation. It was successfully climbed after a 
great detour that cost us two days, and just in time. As the work 
was approaching completion, a strong wind sweeping over the desert 
carried up a thick dust haze, and for weeks efl'aced all distant views. 
Some prominent [)eaks in the outer range of hills, which are visible 
from Khotan town when the atmosphere is clear, have been fixed by 
our work. With the help of these points it will be possible to connect 
Khotan with the Indian trigonometrical S3'stem, and finall}' to verify 
its longitude. But such occasions of dust-clear weather are rare, and 
of the only one which occurred during m}' subsequent short stay in 
Khotan, in April, full advantage could not l)e tak(Mi by mys(>lf. 
Thus this task is still left to a future traveler, who will he ai)le to 
atlord time for ])atiently awaiting his opportunity at Khotan. 

By the middle of November I had returned to Khotan, \\here, after 
our rough and rapid marches through th(> mountains, I was glad to 
allow my men and animals a well-earned shoi-t rest before starting 
once more for the wint(M-\s work in the desert. 1 myself was busv at 
work with the examination of the antiquities which the prospecting 
parties, sent out a month earlier, had brought back from various sites 



7ri2 EXPLORATION IN CHINESE TURKESTAN. 

in the desert. 1 also made a series of excursions for the purpose of a 
close survey of the old localities within the Khotan oasis itself. This 
enabled me satisfactorily to settle numerous questions bearing- on its 
ancient topooraph}^ and in particular to locate almost all the sacred 
Buddhist shi-ines which are described to us by the earl}^ Chinese pil- 
g-rims. Their positions were invariablj' found to be occupied now by 
Muhammadan Ziarats, or Saints' tombs, which form the object of 
populai' pilgrimage. Local worship can thus be shown to have out- 
lived the great change in religion consequent on the Muhammadan 
conquest. Its tenacity has indeed proved quite as useful for the study 
of the ancient topography of Khotan as it had proved to me before in 
Kashmir and other parts of India. 

I must restrict m3^self here to a few remarks only concerning the 
most interesting of those old localities — the site of the ancient capital. 
Its debris layers, which have furnished b}^ far the greatest portion of 
the Khotan antiquities, such as terra cottas, seals, coins, etc., acquired 
by former travelers, lie buried deep below the fields of the little vil- 
lage of Yotkan, some T miles to the west of the present town. Gold- 
washing operations, originating from an accidental discover}^ of gold 
some thirty-seven j^ears ago, have gradually led there to the excava- 
tion of an area over half a mile s<iuare. The careful examination of 
the banks thus laid bare showed me that the "culture strata," as I 
should call them, of Yotkan are composed of the rn))bish that gradu- 
ally- accumulated during the centuries while the site continued to be 
occupied by houses, from about the commencement of our era until 
after the advent of Islam (in the eleventh century of our era). These 
"culture strata," themselves 5 to 14 feet thick at various points, are 
covered by a layer of pure soil from 9 to 20 feet in thickness. This 
layer, which shows no sign of stratification, is manifestly due to silt 
deposit, the necessary result of intensive and long-continued irrigation 
such as prevails all over the oasis. Owing to the disintegrated condi- 
tion of the soil, all the water that is brought down from the mountains 
1)3' the Yurung-kash and Kara-kash rivers, and subsequently distrib- 
uted by innumerable irrigation channels, carries an excessive quantity 
of sediment. The silt thus deposited over all cultivated areas is amply 
s-ufficient to account for the gradual burying of the rubbish layers of 
the ancient capital and for other curious observations I have made as 
to the gradual raising of the ground level throughout the oasis. All 
antiquarian and ph3"sical evidence combines to oppose the assumption 
of a great flood or similar catastrophe, such as some earlier European 
visitors of the site have suggested. 

Among the ancient sites in the Taklamakan Desert which are fre- 
quented by Khotan "treasure seekers," and which the prospecting 
parties sent out by me had visited, none seemed to oft'er better oppor- 
tunities for systematic excavations than the one known to them as

Dandan-Uilik. Turdi, an old and, as experience showed, reliable 
member of that fraternit}', had brought me from there some interest- 
ing- relics, including fragments of Buddhist sculptures, an inscribed 
piece of fresco, and a small but undoubtedly genuine scrap of paper 
with ancient Indian Brahmi characters. Further inquiries made it 
certain that Dandan-Uilik was identical with the ruined site which 
Dr. Sven Hedin had seen on his march to the Keriya Darya, and 
which in the narrative of his travels is spoken of as "the ancient city 
Taklamakan." 

After hurriedly completing in Khotan the preparations for our 
winter campaign, 1 started on December 7 for Tawakkel, a small oasis 
on the outskirts of the forest belt which accompanies the Yurung-kash 
on its course through the desert. Thanks to the stringent orders 
issued by Pan-Darin, the kindly amban of Khotan, I speedily secured 
there the 30 laborers 1 wished to take with me for purposes of exca- 
vation, as well as a four- weeks' food supply. Owing to the reluc- 
tance of the village cultivatoi's to venture far into the desert, it would 
otherwise have been difficult to obtain sufficient labor, especially in 
view of the rigors of the winter. The ponies, for which the desert 
offered neither sufficient water nor food, were sent back to Khotan, 
while we set out on foot, the heavily-laden camels carrying the food 
supplies, together with the indispensable baggage. Marching in the 
drift sand was slow work, though the dunes amidst which we passed 
as soon as we had left the east bank of the river nowhere rose above 
15 feet. Within live days Turdi had safely guided us through the 
sandy waste to the area where the trunks of dead poplars, rising 
shriveled and gaunt from between low dunes, indicated the vicinity 
of ancient cultivation. On the following day (December 18) I had 
my camp pitched in the middle of the ruins I was in search of. 

1 soon found that the structural remains of the site consisted of 
isolated groups of small houses scattered over an area about 1^ miles 
from north to south and three-quarters of a mile broad. The walls, 
constructed throughout of a wooden framework covered with plaster, 
were either broken down within a few feet from the ground, if exposed, 
or, where covered b}^ low dunes, could be made out by the wooden 
posts of the fj'amework sticking out from the sand. The structures 
left more or less exposed had already been searched by native "treas- 
ure seekers." Their operations repeated in successive seasons had, 
together with the erosive action of the wind, caused great destruction 
among these ruins. But the scanty remains left on some walls of 
frescoes representing Buddhas, or Bodhisattvas, showed at once plainh^ 
that the ruins belonged to the Buddhist period, and that some of them 
must have served as Buddhist places of worship.

days, hence they had never l)een able to attack the ruins more 
deeply covered ])y the sand. Thus, when I commenced with m}' little 
force of laborers the systematic excavation of structures half buried 
by low dunes, most interesting archa3ological results soon began to 
reward me. From the cellas of little Buddhist shrines there came to 
light in large numbers stucco images and relievos, frescoes and painted 
wooden tablets, all showing representations of saints and legends of 
sacred Buddhist lore (pi. iv). In style and technical treatment they 
exhibit a close resemblance to that period of ancient Indian art which is 
best known to us from the latter Ajanta cave paintings. Wherever 
protected by the dr}' desert sand, the colors have survived in remarkable 
freshness. Here, then, were rising from their tomb long-lost relics 
of that Indian art which had found a second home in Buddhist Central 
Asia before spreading farther into the Far East. 

Great was my jo}- when, on excavating what must have been the 
ground-floor room of a small monastic dwelling place, the men came 
upon the first leaves of paper manuscripts. Carefully extracted with 
my own hands and cleared, thev proved to contain portions of a liudd- 
hist canonical text in Sanskrit. Judging from the palisographic char- 
acter of the writing, these and su))sequent finds of fragmentary 
tSanskrit manuscripts from Dandan-Uilik ruins may approximately be 
assigned to the sixth or seventh century of our era. In addition to 
such texts in the classical language of India, the literary discoveries 
of this site include a considerable num}>er of manuscript folia and of 
detached documents on paper, written in Indian Brahmi characters, 
])ut in a non-Indian language. Taking into account that the same 
strange language appears in inscriptions athxed to some frescoes, it 
seems probable that w^e have here records of the indigenous tongue 
actually spoken by the Khotan people of that period. Only the close 
study of all these documents — a task which may take years — is likely 
to lead to a decipherment, and thus to a solution of this interesting 
(juestion. 

In the meantime it is fortunate indeed that the discovery of Chinese 
paper documents in other small monastic dwellings permits us to 
determine with accuracy the period when the settlement represented 
by the settlement of Dandan-Uilik was finally abandoned. Among 
the neatly folded small paper rolls containing letters, records of loans, 
petitions, and similar matter, there are three at least which alreadv, 
on pieliminar}" examination at Kashgar, proved to be dated with pre- 
cision, the Chinese years indicated corresponding to the years 778, 
782, 787 of our era. There are good reasons for assuming that these 
petty records do not precede l)y any great length of time the date 
when the dwellings were abandoned. We thus obtained the end of 
the eighth century as the approximate chronological limit for the 
existence of Dandan-Uilik as an inhabited localit}^ This dating is

entire!}" supported by the evidence of the numerous old Chinese coins 
I found at the site, the latest bearing the symbols of the dynastic 
period which corresponds to the 3'ears 713-741 A. D. 

The three weeks I spent in continuous excavations, from the earl}'^ 
mornint^ until da3"lig'ht failed us, enabled me to explore all ruins trace- 
able under the sand. It was a happy time for me personally, though 
the ph3"sical conditions were trying. The severe winter of the desert 
had already set in when I started from Khotan. During my stay at 
Dandan-Uilik the temperature at night usually went down to a mini- 
numi of about 10'^ F. below zero. In the daytime it never rose above 
freezing point in the shade. The weather was cloud}^, but luckily 
there was very little wind. Its absence is an essential condition for 
all prolonged work in the desert. The dead trees of the little orchards 
which once surrounded most of^ the scattered groups of shrines and 
dwellings supplied fuel in plenty. Yet the men suffered from the 
exposure as well as from the badness of the water, the only available 
supply coming from a brackish well they had succeeded in digging in 
a depression of the ground over a mile from the main ruins. My own 
little tent, brought from India, though provided with an extra serge 
lining, was a bitterly cold abode at night. When the temperature had 
once gone to about 6° below freezing point, writing or reading became 
impossible, and I had to take to my bed, however anxious I might 
have been to study the manuscript finds of the day, etc. But, from 
long experience, life in a tent seems the one most congenial to me, 
and, with such fascinating work to occupy me, the four and a half 
months spent in the desolation of the desert were indeed an enjoyable 
time. 

During my stay at Dandan-Uilik, Ram Singh had again joined me 
from the direction of the Keri}^ River. L had dispatched him a 
month earlier on an independent survey of the high range which 
extends between "" Kuen-luen No. 5" and the mountains eastward 
where connection could 1)0 obtained with Captain Deasy's work about 
Polu. On comparing my own plane-table fixing for Dandan-Uilik 
with his, a gratifying surprise awaited me. NotAvithstanding that we 
had brought our survey from entirely different directions and over 
great distances of such deceptive ground as sandy [)lanes and dunes, I 
found that Ram Singh's ])ositi<)n diffci'od from my own l)y only about 
a mile in latitude and a iialf mile in longitude. 

My detaihnl survey of the Dandan-l'ilik site, together with other 
observations of a seniitopographical, semianti(iuai"ian nature which 
gradually ticcumulated during my (\\plorations at this and other sites, 
make it very ])r()hal)h> tiiat tlie lands of Danchui-Tilik were irrigated 
from an extension of the canals which had, down to an even later date, 
brought the water of the streams of Chiraand Culakhina to the desert 
area due south of the ruins. I nuist reserve for another occasion a

discussion of the archfeolog^ical evidence as to the causes which led to 
the abandonment of this advanced settlement. There is every reason 
to believe that this abandonment was a gradual one, and in no way con- 
connected with any sudden physical catastrophe. The Sodom and 
Gomorrha legends heard all over Turkestan about "old towns" sud- 
denly submerged under the sand dunes are more ancient than the ruins 
of Dandan-Uilik themselves and interesting as folklore. But where we 
have plain historical and antiquarian evidence to the contrary, scien- 
tific inquiry can have no concern with them. 

On January 6 I dismissed my Tawakkel laborers who had worked 
so valiantly, and after a three-days' march over truly forbidding 
ground, struck the Keriya Darya. The successive ridges of sand, 
rising to heights of about 200 feet, were the most formidable I ever 
crossed. A four-days' march along the hard-frozen river brought us 
to the oasis and town of Keriya, where Khon-Daloi, the amban, 
accorded me the heartiest welcome. There I first heard of the exist- 
ence of "an old town" — kone shahr, as all ruins are popularly called 
in Turkestan — in the desert north of the well-known pilgrimage place 
of Imam-Jafar-Sadik. The information was very scanty, and the dis- 
tance great. But certain indications pointed to a site of special inter- 
est; so I decided to set out for it after a few days' halt needed to rest 
my followers. 

At Niya, which is the easternmost permanently inhabited place of 
the district, just as in the days of Hiuen Tsiang, who notices it under 
the name of Ni-jang, I received most encouraging proof that 1 was on 
the wa}' to a site far older and hence more important than any 1 had 
examined so far. Owing to its great distance, the Khotan " treasure 
seekers" knew, luckily, nothing of it. An adventurous young vil- 
lager from Niya was the only man who in recent years had visited the 
ruins. From one of the ruined houses he had picked up two small 
wooden tablets. When they were brought to me 1 noticed at once 
that the wa-iting they contained was in the ancient Indian script known 
as Kharoshthi, and of a tj^pe that chronologically belongs to the first 
and second centuries of our era. I hid my delight as well as 1 could, 
and pushed on still more rapidly, after securing a suflicient number of 
laborers and the needful supplies for prolonged excavations. After a 
three days' march through the belt of thick jungle which lines the 
winding course of the Niya River through the desert, the curious 
shrine of Imam Jafar Sadik was reached. There the river finally 
loses itself in the sands, and as water can not be obtained by dig- 
ging, we had to depend for our further progress on what could be 
carried along from that locality. Fortunately the intense cold still 
prevailing througlithis and the following month (on January 20 I reg- 
istered a mininuun of 12- F. below zero) permitted its convenient and 
regular transport in the form of ice. 



EXPLORATION IN CHINESE TURKESTAN. 767 

After a march of about 30 miles through the desert northward, I 
arrived on the evening of eTanuary 27 at the southern edge of the 
wide area over which are scattered the ruins 1 was in search of. The 
subsequent explorations showed that it extends for over 11 miles from 
north to south, with a maximum breadth of about tti miles. 

Pitching- my camp near a small stupa half buried in the sand, I pro- 
ceeded next morning to the ruined house where Ibrahim, the young 
Niya villager alread}^ mentioned, had unearthed his inscribed tablets. 
He declared he had left more in situ. It was a moment of cheerful 
excitement when I approached the timber debris, rising like the 
remains of a wreck from the eroded ground around it. On the sandy 
slope I found at once some tablets actuall}^ exposed, and many more 
scattered about under a slight layer of drift sand within the small room 
where Ibrahim had originally unearthed them (pi. iv). The house 
which contained it had, like the rest of the buildings at this site, been con- 
structed of a wooden framework of massive beams and posts. Between 
the latter rose the walls of hard plaster, strengthened internally by thick 
mattings of rushes. These walls had completely decayed where not 
actually covered by sand, but the posts, now l)lanched and splintered, 
still rise high above the surface. In the building first explored, the 
sand, which during former centuries must have protected it, had largely 
drifted away. The remarkable state of preservation in which man}" of 
the inscribed tablets were found was hence all the more surprising. 
Over 100 were cleared from the little room already mentioned, and 
the excavation of a large room of the same building, on the day fol- 
lowing, more than doubled that number. Unfortunately the protect- 
ing la3^er of sand was here only about 2 feet deep, and in consequence 
all materials not lying quite flat on the floor had decayed completely. 

The present condition of this ruin, which originally appears to have 
been used as a monastic building, illustrates strikingly the destructive 
effect of erosion on this and other structures of the site. The actual 
remains of the building occupy a small plateau raised now 12 to 15 
feet above the immediatel}^ surrounding ground. The lower level of 
the latter is the unmistakable result of erosion. While the strip of 
ground actuallv protected by the debris of this and similar structures 
retains the original level, the open surface near by, consisting of mere 
loess, has been gradualh^ lowered by the action of the wind. The 
drift sand carried along this portion of the desert is not sufficient at 
present to All the depression thus created. From the geological point 
of view, not less than from the archaeological, it would })e interesting 
to study the exact conditions under which the power of the desert 
winds asserts itself in its two main lines of action — -erosion and the 
movement of drift sand. But I am convinced that it will take years 
of minute and systematic observation before any safe conclusions can

be arrived at as to the rate at which tlie woriv of these forces proceeds 
in various parts of the Taklaniakan. And even then there will ))e lit- 
tle to guide us as to the corresponding conditions prevailing during 
earlier historical periods. 

While most of the buildings of this important site had suffered from 
erosion, there were others where parts at least were still buried under 
deep sand (pi. v). From some of these m}" excavations brought to light 
many very interesting ol)je<'ts illustrating the industrial arts of the 
period. The articles of ornamental wood carving, which include elab- 
oratel}" worked chairs, small architraves and other achitectural pieces, 
etc., show decorative motives familiar to us from the relievo sculp- 
tures of the ruined Buddhist monasteries on the northwest frontier of 
India, the ancient Gandhara. The date thus indicated fully agrees 
with the chronological evidence of the Kharoshthi writing on the 
wooden tablets, apparently memoranda and lists, found scattered in 
various rooms of the same dwellings. Broken pieces of arms, house- 
iiold implements, a musical instrvuiient and similar o})jects of domestic 
use, all of wood, help vividly to liring before our eyes the conditions 
of everyday life of this distant region in the first centuries of our era. 

It was difficult for me to realize fully that so many centuries had 
passed since these dwellings were deserted while I traced the plan and 
arrangement of the orchards and gardens once surrounding them. 
Rows of fallen poplars, some 50 feet in liMigth, half covered ])y the 
sand, showed the position of avenues, such as are planted to this day 
everywhere along the roads and canals of Turkestan oases. The rush 
fences used then, as now, for the iiiclosures of gardens could bo seen 
sticking out from the sand. A little digging along them often revealed 
small heaps of dry leaves that must have accumulated there while the 
trees, now reduced to blanched and withered trunks, were still thriving. 
Among these my diggers had no difficulty in distinguishing various 
fruit trees, such as the peach, plum, apricot, mulberry, etc., Avith the 
wood of which they are familiar fi'om their own homes. 

The character and conditions of the articles found within the houses 
plainl}^ showed that they had been cleared by their last inhabitants, 
or soon after their departure, of everything that possessed value. 
Luckily, there were left behind the ru])l)ish heaps to reward me with 
finds of the greatest antiquarian interest. The richest mine of this 
sort was struck in a small and much-decayed building, one room of 
which proved to contain a consolidated mass of refuse, lying fully 
4 feet above the original floor. Among the layers of broken pottery, 
rags of felt and of woven fabrics, pieces of leather and other rubl)ish, 
I discovered thereover two hundred documents on wood, of all shapes 
and sizes. Besides tablets with the Indian Kharoshthi writing, which 
form the great majority, there came to light numerous narrow pieces 
of wood ])earing Chinese characters, and two dozen Kharoshthi docu-

nients on leather — a material one could hardly expect to find among' a 
Buddhist population with an Indian civilization. 

Many of the Kharoshthi tablets unearthed are in excellent preserva- 
tion, and still retain the original clay seals and strings with which 
the}' were fastened (pi. v). We are thus al>le to study exactly the t(>ch- 
nicalities connected with the use of wood as a writing material. This 
is not the place to discuss such details, but I may mention at least that 
each document intended as a letter or record of some importance, 
whether wedge-shaped or oblong, is provided with a carefull}" fitted 
covering piece or envelope bearing the address or "docket" entry. 
An ingenioush' designed system of fastening with a string and a neatly 
inserted cla}" seal, prevented unauthorized inspection of the contents. 

The remarkable series of clay seals discovered on these tablets is of 
exceptional interest, because it furnishes most convincing evidence of 
the infiuence which classical western art has exercised even in distant 
Khotan. A frequently recurring seal, probably that of an official, 
shows the figure of Pallas Athene, with shield and a^gis, treated in 
archaic fashion. Another fine seal is that of a well-modeled naked 
figure of pure classical outline, perhaps a seated Eros. On others, 
again, appear portrait heads showing classical modeling, though bar- 
barian features, etc. We know well how classical art had established 
its infiuence in Bactria and on the northwest frontier of India. But 
there was little to prepare us for such tangible proofs of the fact that 
it had penetrated so much farther to the east, to halfway ))etween 
western P]urope and Peking. I may note here, as an interesting dis- 
covery made while these pages are passing through the press, that 
Professor Karabacek has traced the remains of a (Ireek legend, appar- 
ently a magic fornuda, impressed on the edge of one of the claj^ seals, 
containing in its center the figure of Athene Promachos. 

From the contents of the documents themselves we may confidently 
expect nuich fresh light upon a chapter of Central Asian history and 
civilization which until now has seemed almost entirely lost. Owing to 
the great numl)er of the texts, the cursive character of the script, and 
peculiar difiiculties connected with the nature of the records, their 
complete decipherment will recpiire nmch time and lal)or. But it is 
already certain that, as I recognized in the course of my first examina- 
tion on the spot, the language of the documents is an early foi'm of 
Indian Prakrit, with a large admixture of Sanskrit terms. It is highly 
probable that most of them contain official orders, such as safe con- 
ducts, correspondence, etc., as well as private memoranda and records. 
Religious texts, prayers, etc., may be suspected in some of the long- 
tablets found in what seem to be shrines or monasteries. Many of 
the documents bear exact dates, in which the years are indicated with 
reference to the reigns of named rulers. These will (Miable us pi-obably 
to restore a portion of the historical chronology of this region. 



770 EXPLORATION IN CHINESE TURKESTAN. 

•But whatever revelations of interesting- detail may be in store for 
us, one important historical fact stands out clearly already. The use 
of an Indian language in the vast majority of these documents, when 
considered together with the secular character of most of them, strik- 
ingly confirms the old local tradition recorded by Hiuen Tsiang that 
the territory of Khotan was conquered and colonized about two cen- 
tuiies before our era by Indian immigrants from the northwestern 
Punjab. It is a significant fact the Kharoshthi script used in our 
tal)lets was peculiar to the very region of ancient Taxila, which the 
above tradition names as the original home of those immigrants. It is 
strange, indeed, that the ruined dwellings of a settlement far away 
in the barl)arian north, overrun ])y what Hindu mythology knew as 
the "great sand ocean," should have revealed to us, after nearly two 
thousand years, the oldest written documents (as distinguished from 
inscriptions), and of a type of which ancient specimens have never come 
to light as yet in India proper. It is equally strange, and 3^et easily 
explained by the historical connection of Khotan with China, that we 
should find buried along with them what are likely to prove the oldest 
written Chinese records actually extant. 

There is ample evidence to show that this remarkable site must 
have been deserted already within the first few centuries of our era. 
Apart from the Kharoshthi writing of the tablets and leather docu- 
ments, which agrees closely in its palteographic features with the 
Kharoshthi inscriptions of the Kushana kings of the first and second 
centuries, there is the eloquent testimony of the coins. The very 
numerous finds, extending over the whole area, which were made dur- 
ing my stay include onl}- copper pieces of the Chinese Han dynastj^, 
whose reign came to a close in A. D. 220. The use of wood as the 
only writing material, apart from leather, is also a proof of great 
antiquit}'. The use of paper for writing purposes is attested in Chi- 
nese-Turkestan from at least the fourth century A. D. onwards; yet 
among all the ruined houses and ancient rubbish heaps not the smallest 
scrap of paper was discovered. 

After three weeks of almost incessant excavation work I left this 
fascinating site which had yielded such rich antiquarian spoil in order 
to visit, farther to the east, ruins I had heard of at Niya. A march of 
about 100 miles through the desert, due east of Imam Jafar, brought 
us to where the Endere stream is lost in the sands. After a day's 
march farther to the southeast I found a ruined Stupa, and at some 
distance from it a small circular fort filled with sand-buried buildings. 

My excavations at what proved to be a Buddhist temple, situated in 
the very center, brought to light some interesting stuoco sculptures, 
and, besides, a considerable quantity of manuscript leaves on paper. 
They belong to a variety of texts in Sanskrit, Tibetan, and the 
unknown language written in Indian characters, already referred to in 



EXPLOEATION IN" CHINESE TURKESTAN. 771 

connection with Dandan-Uilik, Ttic Tibetan leaves, containing, as 
Mr. Barnett of the British Museum has ascertained, portions of a 
translation of the Salisthanil)asutra, a Buddhist canonical text, 
undoubtedly are the oldest written remains of tliat language as yet 
discovered. It was curious to note how the folia which originally 
belonged to a fairl}" large manuscript had been cut up and separately 
deposited, manifestly as votive offerings, at the pedestals of various 
images. A pious visitor of the shrine had evidently endeavored to 
propitiate with his text as many divinities as possible. To other curi- 
ous discoveries made there, such as Tibetan and Chinese Sgraffitti, 
small votive offerings of elaborately woven fabrics in silk and cotton, 
etc., I can only allude here. But as a point of chronological impor- 
tance it ma}^ be mentioned at least that in one of the Chinese Sgraffitti, 
of which I brought away photographs. Professor Douglas has since 
read a date corresponding to A. 1). 790. 

The proofs of Tibetan occui:)ation showed me that 1 had reached at 
Endere the easternmost limits of the territor}- with the archasological 
exploration of which I was concerned. So, on February 26 I could 
turn back w'ith a good conscience toward the west, where several sites 
yet remained to be examined. The journe}^ to Keriya, a distance of 
over 180 miles, was covered in seven forced marches. The energetic 
assistance of Khon-Daloi, the Amban, who had followed my move- 
ments with the friendliest care and interest, allowed me to set out at 
once with fresh laborers, transport, and supplies for Karadong, the 
ancient site in the desert, some 150 miles north of Keriya, which Dr. 
Sven Hedin had first visited. 

This so-called "ancient city" proved to contain little more than the 
ruins of a roughly ])uilt (juadrangular structure, which probably had 
served as a fortified sarai, or post, on the ancient route leading along 
the Keriya Darya toward Kuchar in the north. My excavations at 
this desolate spot were carried on under considerable difficulties. The 
height of the dunes which covered the interior of the great quadrangle 
was considerable, and daily we were visited by sand storms of varying 
degrees of violence. The finds, which were scanty, as I had expected, 
curiously enough included small quantities of remarkably well- 
preserved cereals, such as wheat, rice, pulse, etc., found embedded in 
the floor of what evidently was an ancient guard room. 

A series of Imrried marches brought me back once inoic lo the 
vicinity of the present inhabited area. Various anti(juarian and topo- 
graphical considei'atlons made me look out in the desert north of the 
oasis of Gulakhma for the remains of the town of Pi-mo, which Hiuen 
Tsiang visited on his way from Khotan to Niya, and which is probably 
mentioned also 1)}' Marco Polo imder the name of Pein. After a search, 
rendered difficult by the insufiicienc}' of guides and the want of water, 
I succeeded in tracing it in an extensive debris-covered site known as 



772 EXPLORATIOlsr TN CHINESE TURKESTAN. 

''Uzuii-Tati'' ("the distant Tati"), in the desert north of tlie oasis of 
Gulakhnia. Far-advanced erosion and tlie operations of treasure 
seekers from tlie neighboring- villages have left little of structural 
remains, but tlie usual debris of broken pottcny, glass, china, etc., was 
plentiful. 

A close inspection of the conditions under which cultivation is carried 
on in this vicinit}', along the edge of the desert, was very instructive 
from the point of view of historical topograph}". 1 found that, owing 
to a difficulty of conducting the irrigation water sufficiently far, some 
villages of this oasis had, within the memor}" of living men, l)een shifted 
as much as 6 to 8 miles farther to the south. The crumbling ruins of 
the old village homesteads, stripped of all that could be of use, are 
still to be seen. Over miles of ground, which the desert sand is slowlj" 
overrunning, the lines of empty canals, embanked lields, etc., can be 
made out with ease. It was the best illustration 1 could have of the 
process wdiich many centuries ago nmst have followed the abandonment 
of ancient localities like the Niya River site and Dandan-Uilik. 

Increasing heat ])y day and recurring dust storms warned me that 
the season was close at hand when work in the desert would become 
impossil)le. So, as soon as I had ret'urned to the outskirts of Khotan 
on April 5, I set out for the ancient sites whicli still renuiined to be 
examined in the desert northeast of the oasis. There a discovery of 
unexpected importance awaited me; for when, after examining Aksipil 
and other del)ris areas, I arrived at llawak, of which Turdi, ni}' hon- 
est old guide, had spoken merely as "an old house,''' 1 found l)efore 
me a large Stujxi, forming, with its inclosing (piadrangle, l)y far the 
most imposing of all extant ruins of this region. The excavations I 
at once conmienced along the massive walls of the great stupa court 
revi^ded a remarkable series of colossal statues in stucco, representing 
liuddhas or Bodhisattvas, with many smaller relievos between them 
(pi. vi). The walls were further decorated with e]al)orate plaques 
forming halos, as well as with fresco paintings. The whole of the 
relievo work had originally l)een painted. 

The careful excavation of this wealth of sculpture was a difficult 
matter. The interior framework of wood, which once su})ported the 
masses of stucco, had rotted away, and, deprived of this support, the 
heavy images threatened to collapse wdien the protecting sand was being 
removed (pi. vi). The risk was considerably increased l<ythe Burans, 
which were t)lowing with more or less violence during the whole of 
my stay. Extreme care was needed in clearing the statues, and their 
lower portions had to be covered up again as soon as they had been 
photographed. An attempt to remove the larger sculptures wascjuite 
impractical)le owing to the extremely friable condition of the stucco 
and the difficulties of transport. But of the smaller ones and of pieces 



EXPLORATION IN CHINESE TURKESTAN. 773 

found already detached 1 .succeeded in hrinoing- away a considerable 
number without mishap. 

The Kawak relievos show in style and most details of execution the 
closest affinity with the so-called Grieco-Buddhist sculptures of the 
ruined monasteries and shrines on the northwest frontier of India. 
This makes their close stud}^ with the help of the numerous photo- 
graphs I secured, a matter of great historical and artistic interest. 
Though no epigraphic or manuscript remains have come to light, the 
evidence of the numerous coins I found, deposited as votive offerings, 
goes far to prove that the sculptures of the Kawak Stupa belong 
approximatel}' to the same period as the ruins of the "Nij^a River 
site." 

The daily sand storms, together with the increasing heat and glare, 
had made the work of excavation at Ilawak trying to the men as well 
as myself. So I was g'lad when the completion of this task permitted 
us to withdraw from the desert. On m.y return to Khotan I was bus}^ 
with arranging my collections of archaeological finds and repacking 
them for their long journey to London. While thus engaged I suc- 
ceeded in clearing up the last dou))ts as to the real nature of the 
strange manuscripts and ''block prints" "in unknown characters" 
which had, during recent years, been purchased from Khotan in such 
remarkable numbers, and which had found their way not only to Cal- 
cutta but also to great public collections in London, Paris, and St. 
Petersburg. The grave suspicions which my previous inquiries had 
led me to entertain as to the genuineness of these supposed "finds" 
had gradually ))ecn strengthened almost to certainty by the explora- 
tions of the winter. Ample and varied as the maiuiscript materials 
had ])een which rewarded my excavations. 1 had utterly failed to trace 
tlie smallest scrap of Avriting in "unknown characters.'' The actual 
conditions of the sites explored also entirely dltl'ered from the condi- 
tions under which those ()ueer manuscripts and priiits ^\■ere alleged to 
have been discovered. There was good reason to Ixdicve that Islam 
Akhun, a native of Khotan, from whom most of those purchases had 
been made during the 3'ears 1895-1SU8, was directly concerned in the 
forgeries. 

After my return to Khotan I expressetl to Pan-Darin a wish for a 
personal examination of this inter(>sting individual. Some days later 
he was duly pi'oduced from a village of the Kei'iya district, where he 
had recently been practicing as a "medicine man."" Ishun Aklnin's 
examination proved a lengthy afi'air. He readily acknowledged his 
guilt in various recent frauds (including one practiced on Captain 
Deasy), for wliich he had received du(> punishment from local Chinese 
justice. But in the mattei-of the "old books"" heat Mi'st i)i'otest(>d com- 
plete innocence. His defense, however, collapsed in the course of a

prolonged cross-examination, and ultimately he made a full confession. 
The detailed explanations he then furnished of the circumstances which 
had first led to the conception of these forgeries, and of the methods 
and materials emploj^ed in their manufacture, were interesting enough, 
and proved, on comparison with the record which had been kept at 
Kashgar of the purchases, remarkably accurate. Notwithstanding the 
ingenuity displaj-ed in starting these forgeries, Islam Akhun and his 
factory " hands" had never succeeded in producing a text exhibiting 
consecutively the characters of any known script. Also, in other 
material respects, it is easy now, in the light of the experience gained 
through my explorations, to distinguish between his fabrications and 
genuine ancient manuscripts. There is, therefore, little fear that the 
forgeries of this clever scoundrel will ever cause deception thereafter. 
On April 28 1 bade farewell to Khotan town, and May 12 saw me 
once more at Kashgar, under the hospitable roof of my friend Mr. 
Macartney, the British representative. Since my departure, eight 
months earlier, Mr. Macartney had lost no opportunit}' to facilitate 
my labors. The assistance of the Chinese officials, which was essential 
for the success of my explorations, had been secured mainly through 
his influence and unfailing care. For all the help thus accorded to me 
I wish to express here my feelings of sincere gratitude. * * * 



FROM TKE SOMALI COAST THROUGH SOUTHERN 
ETHIOPIA TO THE SUDAN." 



Bv Oscar Neumann. 



In the sprino- of 1899 Baron Carlo von Erlang'er asked me to join 
an expedition to Sonialiland which he intended to undertake for the 
sake of spoi't and ornitholog-ical research. I agreed on condition that 
the journey should not be confined to Sonialiland, but should also 
extend to the countries of southern Ethiopia. The preparations took 
nearl\' half a j-ear. Meanwhile the revolt of the ''Mad Mollah" had 
broken out, and the western route proposed by myself proved to be 
the only one possible, as the foreign office was forced to recall its per- 
mission to penetrate the hinterland of Berbera, and we were therefore 
o})liged to set out from Zeila by the old caravan route to Hai"ar. The 
members of the expedition were Baron Carlo von Erlanger, Dr. Hans 
Ellenbeck as physician, Mr. Johann Holtermuller as cartographer, Mr. 
Carl Hilgert as taxidermist, and myself. 

We started from Zeila on flanuary 12, 1900, but an accident to Mr. 
Carl Hilgert, who nearh^ killed himself with a small Flaubert gun, 
stopped us at the wells of Dadab, only three marches from the coast, 
so that we did not arrive at Harar until the beginning of March. 

In the desert Baron Erlanger and myself preceded the caravan in 
order to meet Mr. Alfred Ilg, the foreign minister of the Emperor 
Menelik, who was on his way to the coast, and to whose valuable help 
a great part of the success of our expedition is due. But in the first 
place we have to thank the Emperor Menelik, that intelligent ruler 
and restorer of an ancient and great Empire, for his help and permis- 
.sion to pass through his countiy. In the second place oui' thanks are 
due for the kind assistance atl'ordcd by Major (now Lieutenant-Colonel) 
Harrington, H. B. M., agent in Abyssinia; Major Ci(5cadicola, the 
Italian envoy, and Mr. Muhle, postmaster and chief engineer of the 
telegraph and telephone lines between Adis Abeba and Harar. 

From Harar we made an excursion to the mountains of Gara Mulata, 
situated about three daA's to the southwest and not visited by any 
European since the time of Captain Hunter. The western slopes of

this r:ino-e are covered Avith thick forest, and therefore the fauna, as 
well as the flora, here contrast sharply with that wliich Ave had found 
in the dr\' Somali desert between Zeila and Jildesa, situated at the foot 
of the Harar Mountains. Returning to Harar, the lirst thing- we 
found was a prohibition to continue our journey to the south, as the 
countries of the Ennia and Arussi Galla were said to be in a state of 
rebellion, excited by that of the Somal; and only after a solemn decla- 
ration on our part to the effect that the Emperor ]Menelik should not 
be held responsilde for our safety, and thanks to the great assistance of 
Major Harrington, did we receive permission to continue our journey. 
Unfortunateh' we were again obliged to put otl' our departure, as a 
great many of our camels, wliich during oursojoui'n in Harar had been 
left at a place in the Erer Valley, had died there from the results of 
eating poisonous herbs and it was impossible to o))tain new animals for 
some time. We therefore inade a temporaiy camp at Gandakore, in 
the countr}' of Argobl)a. to the south of Harar. 

It is remarkable that, in spite of their proximity to Harar, next to 
nothing was known of the interesting Argobha people and their old 
stone buildings. The remains of this probably once powerful nation 
dwell on the eastern slopes of the Hakim, a mountain ridge situated 
to the south of Harar.. Their houses were ])uilt of stone, had high 
watciitowers in the centei', and were surroundetl by strong v/alls. 
They ai'e now mostly fallen into decay and are only partly inhabited. 
The old ruins overlooking the Erer Valley resemble medieval castles 
and present a picturesque appearance. Scattered amongst them are 
the straw huts of the Ala Galla, who form the greater part of the 
popuhition of to-day. Mysterious reports as to the Argoljlxi exist 
among the Harari and the (ialla. It is said that at certain festivals 
they devour human tiesh. It is certain that these rei)orts are untrue, 
as the Argo))ba are strict, even fanatical, jMoluunmedans, l>ut the}' seem 
to prove that the nation is of quite a dili'erent origin to the inhabitants 
of Harar. 

On May 22 we set olf southwaid from Gandakore, and on the next 
day we passed the village of Biaworaba. The Austrian explorer 
Paulitschke had pushed as far as this place in the year 1884, but since 
that time no European had reached it or explored farther south, as the 
Abyssinian Government had strictly forbidden any European to enter 
that country. South of Biaworaba we entered the country of the 
Ennia. This people is a mixed race of Galla and Somal. The}' speak 
a Galla dialect, but have followed the nomadic manner of living of the 
Somal. For one or two 3'ears the}' build for themselves square huts 
of cow dung, much resembling those I found during my journey in 
East Africa in use by the sedentary Masai, the so-called Wakwali. 
Besides these, they build for their cows and sheep peculiar huts, 7 to 8 
feet high, resembling a sugar loaf, likewise of cow dung. Sometimes, 



THROUGH SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA T<) THE SUDAN. 777 

but seldoui, they cultivate .suuill tracts of land. These people are 
rather poor, and they are therefore mostly left in peace In' the Abys- 
.siniaus. At the time of our visit they Avere in extremely poor cir- 
cumstances, as different parties of the Ogaden Somal had crossed the 
river Erer some months ])efore and had cai'ried off many of their cattle. 
On the whole, the countr}' is a high plateau, thickly grown with bush 
and intersected by two tributaries of the Wabbi, the Gobele and the 
Moyo, which have cut deep, canyon-like clefts in the tableland. On 
the banks of the Moyo we found some beautiful grottoes, and I must 
also mention the remains of some old towns which we passed during 
this part of the journe}". Here was formerly situated the Ethiopian 
frontier province of Daroli, which was devastated in the year 1528 b}' 
Mohanmied Granye, the Sultan of Tajura — the "Attila of Africa," as 
he has been called. I must also note, at this point, that the river 
Shenon, marked on former maps, was not to be found, and was not 
even known by name to the Ennia people. And further, we discov- 
ered at several places between Harar and the A^'ab])i, especially near 
Harrorufa and Achabo, strata of Jurassic age containing numerous 
fossils, mostly in a splendid condition. On June 10 we were able to 
cross the riv(^r called Wabbi by the Galla, but better known 1)v the 
Somali name Webi Shebeli — that is to say, the Leopard River. 

On the farther bank of the Wabbi an event occurred which might 
ha\e proved fatal to the success of our expedition. Our Somal, or a 
great part of them, had made up their minds to strike, as they feared 
our expedition would keep them too long from home. Perhaps they 
intended to go straight east and to join the revolting Ogaden tribes. 
By good luck I arrived just in time to stop the party from crossing the 
river with their rifles. They were afraid to return without them, and 
so, after a da^^'s considtation, they agreed to go farther west with us. 
We were now in the country of the Arussi, a large and once much- 
feared section of the Galla tribe. Near a place called Gurgura we 
struck the route of Dr. Donaldson Smith, the first explorer of these 
countries, and followed it as far as the hol\' Mohammedan town of 
Sheikh Husein. Here, on the southern banks of the Wabbi, the bush 
was not so dense as on the north, and game was in some places abun- 
dant. We often found the fresh tracks of elephants, and near a place 
called Luku there were large herds of zebra {Ef/uus grevyi)^ oryx and 
*gerenuk'' {Llthoci'anlus Sclateri)^ and plenty of the lesser kudu. 
'The town of Sheikh Husein is well known from the wonderful descrip- 
tion given in Dr. Donaldson Smith's book. When you approach it 
you already see from afar the white tombs of the sheikhs glistening 
in the sun. There are about twelve tombs altogether. In the middle 
there is a cemetery containing the tomb of the jNIohammedan saint 
who is said to have founded the town, and whose name it bears. The 
inhabitants tell many stories of the miracles he did — for instance, he is 



778 THEOUGH SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA TO THE SUDAN. 

.said to have piled up in one night a small mountain situated southeast 
of the town. The faces of the inhabitants show clearly that they are 
descended from old Arab colonists. Their chief is the Imam, a direct 
descendant of Sheikh Husein. The Christian Abyssinians, who for 
about ten or twelve years have been masters of these countries, treat 
the Mohammedans here and their traditions with much respect. Ever}^- 
thing in and near Sheikh Husein is hol\", and belongs to the dead 
sheikh. It is not permitted to cut wood near the town, no cattle are 
sold, and we were asked not to shoot birds. One of my Somal having 
caught two bats with a butterfly net in the holy tomb, a large assembly 
was held and the poor fellow and myself were cursed by the Imam 
imtil I gave him some dollars to appease the wrath of the dead sheikh. 
I will simpl}^ mention that, besides the tombs, there are other stone 
])uildings in Sheikh Husein which, in my opinion, are perhaps of a 
pre-Islamatic origin, such as a wall about 2 feet thick surrounding 
a small lake near the town. 

Prior to our arrival we had received messages from the Abyssinian 
dejasmach (General of the Center), Wolde Gabriel, the governor of 
these countries, ordering us, in the name of the Emperor Menelik, 
to proceed straight to Adis Abeba. Meanwhile we had lost so many 
camels ))y the rough roads in the Ennia and Arussi lands that we 
were compelled to leave here about half our stores. Directly west 
of Sheikh Husein there was no road practicable for camels, so we had 
to proceed two days in a southwesterly direction, crossing the beau- 
tiful and forest-clad chain which Dr. Donaldson Smith has called the 
Gillet mountains. The forests here show nothing of the character of 
a tropical African forest. Looking at the tall tir-like juniper trees, 
among which, in some places, the barley fields of the Arussi are 
scattered, the traveler might imagine himself in the Black Forest 
or in the forests of Tyrol. West of the Gillet mountains is an 
isolated mountain called Abunas, or Gara Daj, by the Arussi, which 
we ascended after some quarrels with the Abyssinian chief whom 
Wolde Gabriel had sent us as escort. This fellow seemed to be afraid 
that we might run away on the other side of the mountain. On the 
top of the Abunas there are ruins of a sanctum probably of pre- 
Islamitic age. The view here is splendid, and boundless on every side 
except the north, where Mount Abulkassim, about 900 feet higher 
than Abunas, is situated. From the summit we descended to the 
Wabbi, recrossed the river to the north, and camped about halfway 
up Mount Abulkassim, the holy mountain of the inhabitants of Sheikh 
Husein. 

This mountain, already seen from a very far distance fifteen years 
ago b}^ the Italian explorer Ragazzi, had never before been visited by 
any European. There is a good way leading upward to a high preci- 
pice, in which are about a dozen caverns, at some seasons of the year 



THROUGH SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA TO THE SUDAN. 779 

inhabited by Mohammedan pilgTims. In one of these we found a 
stool, a mortar with pestle, and a wooden pillow. Not far otf is the 
grave of KSheikh Abulkassim, a descendant of Sheikh Husein, made in 
an artiiicial bower situated in a wonderful tropical forest full of lianas 
and palms. The g-rave is cov^ered with glass beads and ornaments of 
copper and brass. Similar ornaments are also to be seen on some 
trees in the forest, and no visitor would dare touch these holy objects. 
Round the mountain there is no settlement whatever. 

From Abulkassim we proceeded west for aljout three da3's on the 
hills situated on the northern bank of the Wabbi. Near a place called 
Jaffa we were stopped by a largo body of Abyssinians sent by the 
dejasmach Lulsagit, through whose countries we had now to pass. It 
took us some trouble to get permission to proceed farther, as the 
dejasmach had had no notice of our arrival. Here we had to ascend 
the last step of the plateau, and found ourselves on a large grass- 
covered expanse, absolutely Hat and without any trees, called Didda by 
the inhabitants. On old maps this plain is called the Arussi i)lateaii. 
The Northwestern Arussi, who live here, are a pure Galla tribe, show- 
ing no mixture of Arab blood, as do the inhabitants of the Sheikh 
Husein district. The sight of these dirty, long-bearded men gallop- 
ing their small ponies, covered with })rass and iron rings, over the 
wide plain, reminds one of Mongolian or Tartar tribes rather than of 
an African people. Their huts are scattered in small groups of three 
to five all over the plain. The}^ do not cultivate much ground, l)ut 
have large herds of fine cattle. Just as we arrived here the rainy sea- 
son broke out with terrible vehemence, and the plain was soon changed 
into a large swamp, so that we here lost nearly half our camels. The 
crossing of this plain took us twelve daj's, after which we descended 
into the valley of the Hawash, which had overflowed its banks and in 
some places changed the valle}- into a large lake. I will here mention 
the church Georgis, in the district Sire, which was formed}- a Moham- 
medan mosque, but is now changed into a Christian church by the 
Abj'ssinians. It might have been supposed that the country between 
the Hawash and the Abyssinian capital was absolutely known, as many 
explorers, including the Italians Traversi and Ragazziand the German 
Stecker, had visited it. We were all the more surprised to find here 
a magnificent waterfall unknown before. The river Modsho, a small 
northern affluent of the Hawash, Avhich is here about 500 feet broad, 
falls over a precipice 40 feet in height.. We called this waterfall, 
which I consider to be one of the most bt^autiful in northeastern Africa, 
Menelik Falls. Passing by Lake Buchoftu, one of a group of five 
small crater lakes called the Adda lakes, we arrived in Adis Abeba on 
August 14. 

The Emperor Menelik |)romised us free permission to travel in his 
countries, and any assistance we might require. Owing to the fact that 



780 THKOUGH SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA TO THE SUDAN. 

our journey from Zeila to Adis Al)eba had taken us nearly doul)le the 
time wc liad at tirst calculated, Baron Erlano-er and I cauK^ to the con- 
clusion that it was impossible for us to accomplish tof^'ether all our pro- 
posed programme. We therefore decided to divide our caravan, in 
order to explore as large an extent of unknown ground as possible. 
Baron Erlanger proposed to return ])y another route to Sheikh 
Husein, and to strike thence to Lake liudolf by a new route, while 1 
made up my mind to tirst penetrate the highlands of Shoa proper, 
and afterwards to Und a new route somewhere westward to the Sudan. 

For the moment traveling was out of the question, it being the 
height of the rainy season; but as soon as the rain began to slacken 
I formed a small caravan and started for the unknown part of Shoa 
which lies l)etween the rivers Guder and Muger, two large southern 
affluents of the Blue Nile. Two days from Adis xVbeba I passed the 
place Ejere', then a small village, but soon to become the new residence 
of the Emperor Menelik under the name of Adis Halem — that is to 
say, the "new world," the scarcity of wood near the old capital Adis 
Abeba ("new flower") becoming each year more and niore^ apparent. 
Near Ejere, and still more in the district of Cheracha, there are mag- 
nificent large forests. After passing these I came to the district of 
KoUu, and stopped some days near a village called Aveve, as the place 
was noted for the presence of lions. I found some fresh tracks, but 
did not get a chance of seeing one. Here I found the source of foui' 
small ri\crs not previoush' known, the Urga, Gora, Taranta, and Bus- 
siyo, which afterwards unite under the name Taranta to form a rather 
large river, which then flows westward to the Guder. The Bussiyo 
forms the frontier between KoUu, belonging to Shoa proper and the 
province of Gindeberat, which belongs to Gojam, the land of tlu^ since 
deceased king Tekla Haimanot. 1 will here mention the interesting- 
basalt mountain called Badattino, on the top of which there are a vil- 
lage and a cluirch. From here to Abuye, an Abyssinian fort situated 
on the edge of the plateau, the country has the character of a l)eauti- 
ful English park. 1 had to leave the bulk of my caravan at Al>uye, 
as the road thence down to the Blue Nile was not practicable for fully 
laden mules, and descended with onl}^ seven men and a small tent. The 
dift'erence in height between Abu3"e and the Blue Nile is about .5,8(»0 
feet. The river was now in flood and turbulent, making it quite 
impossible to cross to Gojam. Great heat prevailed in the valley, and 
we were terribly bitten ])y mosquitoes. 1 therefore gave quinine to 
all my men, and it was interesting to And that one who refused to 
take it got an attack of malaria after six days. Having reascended 
the plat(»au, 1 returned b}^ the same wa}^ to Badattino, and thence 
took another route straight eastward. 

Near a village called Adaberga I arrived to witness the end of a 
religious ceremony of the Galla. The Galla are split up into some

large divisions, and these ai^^ain into smaller tribes, which are at the 
same time relio'ious connnunities. Each of these tribes has its hio-h 
priest, or Gailan, who resides near a sacred o-rove. On certain days of 
the year the Gailan shuts himself up in his house, and after working- 
himself into a state of ecstasy makes inspired communications to the 
people standing- around. The Christian Ab3\ssinians arc forbidden by 
their priests to attend these ceremonies; nevertheless, they believe in 
the mysterious power of the Gailan, whom they hold to lie in league 
with the devil. The Gallau here was an interesting-looking man, 
standing over 6 feet high, with long hair and beard. From Adaberga 
I went to Falle, a place given l)y the Emperor Menelik to Mr. Ilg, and 
here I stopped some days to observe and collect specimens of the black 
Jellada })aboon, a species not previously met with, which lives on the 
rocks of the steep precipices leading to the Muger River. After four 
weeks' absence 1 returned to Adis Abeba, and now prepared for my 
expedition to the Sudan. 

The route I chose did not lead directly westward, because the 
chain of lakes situated in the northern part of the great East African 
rift valle}" seemed to offer some interesting geographical problems, as 
the existing maps on that part pul)lished by the Italians Traversi and 
Bottego, by the Frenchman D'Aragon, by Donaldson Smith, by the 
late Captain Wellby, and a new one published by Count Leontieff, 
which came into my hands just before starting from Adis Abeba, could 
not be brought into agreement with each other. By the different 
position assigned on these maps to the lakes situated between Lake 
Zwa] and the large Lake Abaya, called Lake Margarita by Bottego, 
1 calculated that there ought to be one or even two lakes in that region 
not 3'et known. This calculation was afterwards contirmed by the 
discovering of Lake Langanna or Korre and the double Lake Abasi. 

I left Adis Al)eba on November l-i, and at Mount Zekwala met the 
caravan of Baron Erlanger, who had started some days previously. 
The HaAvash was now so low that we easily marched through it. From 
here to Lake Zwa'j the country is covered with typi<'al acacia bush, in 
the middle of which I found the grass and moss-covered ruins of an 
old Al)yssinian settlement. Round Lake Zwa], and on down the whole 
of the rift valley, as far as I followed it, game was plentiful. On the 
hills and mountains bordering the valley we have the large kudu, while 
farther south, at Lake Abaya, there is the lesser kudu. We saw on 
the plains the East African zebra {J{quus f/ranti), hartebeest {Buhalls 
smaynei)^ and Grant's gazelle; in the forests, elephants and rhinos. 
Tlie reeds Ijordering the lakes are inhabited l)y large herds of water- 
buck and reed-buck. 

The region near Lake Zwaj is very interesting from a geological 
point of view. We an* here at the northern end of the great East 
African rift valle}-, which extends south to the mitldle of German 



782 THROUGH SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA TO THE RTTDAlSr. 

East Africa, finishing near Mount Gurui. The mountains ])ord8ring' 
the valley at this northern part consist mostly of obsidian and other 
volcanic vitrified rocks. Some smaller rocky hills standing out in 
some parts of the valley also consist of the same material. The river 
Suksuk joins Lake Zwa] with the more southerly situated Hora 
Shale. Lake Hora, as it was called by the late Captain \Vellb3', is 
wrong-, for Hora means " Salt Lake;" Hora Shale, "Pelican Salt 
Lake." South of it is the Hora Lannna, the water of which, as we 
were told b}^ the Galla, has the same salty properties as has the Hora 
Shale. There is onl}^ a small neck of land between these two lakes, 
in the middle of which lies Mount Fike, a volcano of the t3^pical 
horseshoe form, with its opening turned northward. Southeast of 
Lake Zwa] lies the Alutu, a mountain which consists in its upper 
parts almost entirely of a greenish- black obsidian-like rock. 1 made 
^he ascent and saw from the top, east of Hora Shale, a lake previously 
unknown, Avhich was called by the Arussi who accompanied us Hora 
Langanna, or Hora Korre. This is the most beautiful of the lakes, 
as the southern slopes of Mount Alutu fall in picturesque contour into 
the water. There is a connection between this lake and Hora Shale, 
which is called Daka by the Arussi. 1 reached the Hora Korre on the 
next day. Its waters are only slightly brackish. South of Hora 
Korre J found the most magnificent euphorbia forests I ever saw in 
Africa. Near a great market place called Alelu 1 marched for about 
five or six hours, hardU" seeing an}- other tree. Arriving at Lake 
Abassi (which, although seen bv d'Aragon, is not to be found on any 
recent map, probably because it was considered identical with the 
Lake Lamina of Captain Wellby) my caravan and that of Baron 
Erhmger were stopped by the Balaml)aras Abite, a subchief of the 
Dejasmach Balcha, the Abyssinian governor of these countries. In 
spite of the permission given in the Emperor Menelik's letters, we 
had to send messengers ahead to the dejasmach in order to ask his per- 
uussion to come to his residence. It took them five days to return. 
1 used that time in making investigations of the hot springs which 
are situated at the eastern corner of the lake. Some of these had 
formed hills of tuti' 10 feet high. The substance is about the same as 
that of the Karlsbad-Sprudelstein. The hot water bubbles out at the 
sunniiit. 

Here we entered a new ethnological region, that of the Sidamo peo- 
ple. The Sidamo form one group with the Jamjam, Walamo, Borodda, 
Kosha, and Malo people on the banks of the Omo River. This is a 
group of a prol)ably very remote origin, l)ut more or less mixed with 
conquering Galla tribes. Ascending from the north we had to pass 
wonderful forests covering the western slopes of a high mountain 
chain, till we reached the plateau covered with alpine marsh and bam- 
boo forest on which Abera, the "Katania," or residence of the Dejas- 



THROUGH SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA TO THE SUDAN. 788 

mach Balclui, is situated. Abera lies about 10,000 feet above the sea 
level and is three hours north of the old capital Daressa, visited by 
d'Arao'on. Looking northward one has good views back as far as 
Lake Abassi; looking- westward 3^ou have glorious views of Lake 
Aba3'a or Margarita, with the mountainous countries of Walamo, 
Borodda, and Gamo on its western shore. 

The reception the dejasmach had prepared for us was most magnifi- 
cent. Hundreds of horsemen dressed picturesquely came out to meet 
us. Between our camp and the bamboo palace of the dejasmach there 
was a double line of Abyssinian warriors in full attire, dressed with 
silk skirts interwoven with gold or .silver, or covered with lion and 
leopard skins. Hundreds of shields, covered with gold and silver 
ornaments, glistened in the sun. The dejasmach wished us to con- 
tinue our journey by the great Abyssinian road running south along 
the ridge of this large mountain chain, but 1 intended to descend to 
Lake Abaya, in order to have some shooting, and to visit one of the 
large islands in the lake. It was long before the dejasmach would 
give permission for this. Pie told us dreadful stories of the bad roads, 
the absence of food near the lake, and the immber of people killed by 
lions there. The reason for these stories probably was that he was 
afraid that we would shoot too many elephants, of which we after- 
wards found large herds on the shore of the lake. Descending I 
passed the country of the Gudji, or Uata Dera, who in their physiog- 
nomy reminded me very nuich of the Wandorobo tril)e of East Africa. 

Quite a different population called Gidicho live on the largest island 
of the lake. The Gidicho have good-looking, Somali-like faces. iVh' 
Somal found, to their great astonishment, that a great part of the 
Gidicho expressions were almost identical with their own; as, for 
instance, the words for the various parts of the body and for the best- 
known animals, such as lion and leopard. 1 consider this discovery to 
be of great importance from an ethnological point of view, as the 
Somal were always thought to be the last Intruders in Northeast 
Africa, and here we find an isolated tribe sui'rounded by a population 
of an apparently older origin. The boats of the Gidicho are very 
inter(>sting. They are rather rafts in l)oat form, being made of the 
very light w^ood of a species of ambach. The liovv is often ornamented 
like that of the Venetian gondolas. Formerly there were constant 
quarrels and wars between the inhabitants of the islands and those of 
the shore, ])ut now. under Abyssinian rule, all live in peace with each 
other. 

At Lake Abaya my caravan sepai-ati^i from that of Baron Erlanger, 
who had to return to Abera and Sheikh Husein. South of Lake 
Abaya lies Lake Ganjule, whose water has a wonderful dark azure blue 
color, and may be compared to the most beautiful lakes of Switzer- 



V84 THROUGH SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA. TO THE SUDAN. 

land. I had resolved to pass along- the eastern shore of Lake Ganjule, 
in order to solve the problem of the sources of the river Sagan, the 
largest affluent of Lake Stefauic, which was supposed to flow out of 
Lake Ganjule. This 1 found to be not the case. The sources of the 
Sagan lie east of the south end of Lake Abaya. But there is a broad 
channel connecting Lake Ganjule with the Sagan. The bed of this 
channel was dry at the time, but there were some large and small 
water pools scattered over it. When the water rises in Lake Ganjule 
for about 5 inches, which will probably take place every year at the 
beginning of the rainy season, a large river will run from Lake 
Ganjule to the Sagan. On the upper Sagan I again found some hot 
sulphurous springs. It was impossible to follow the coui'se of the 
Sagan, as it runs at some places through densest forest, the haunt of 
rhinos and bufl'aloes, the tracks of which were to be seen everywhere. 
I went round the south corner of the lake and ascended the mountains 
of GarduUa, which I reached in the second week of January, 1901. 

The Gardulla were the iirst people of Bantu stock that I met. The 
difference can be seen at tirst glance in their heavier and stronger built 
tigures and their nearly black skin. While working in the tields the 
men go quite naked, in the villages they wear skins and cotton stuft's. 
Cotton is the principal cultivation of Gardulla and of most countries 
northward to Koslia and Konta, while farther north Kaffa and Jimma 
are the first coffee lands of Africa. As the hills of Gardulla are very 
stony, the inhabitants range the stones in terraces, so that a Gardulla 
hill has the aspect of a vineyard on the Rhine. They have their houses 
and the walls surrounding them made of broad, plain planks, and on 
the top of the reed roof there is as ornament a red earthenware vase. 
The land was formerly under a queen, who still lives in a place called 
Gidole. The Abyssinians still allow her to exercise her authority in 
petty affairs, but she has no further influence whatever. The true 
ruler of the land, the Futarari Wolde, is a subchief of Futarari Afta 
Georgis, to whom the Emperor Menelik gave these countries when 
conquered, ])ut who prefers to remain in Adis Abeba. The Gardulla 
wear bi'oad necklaces of brass or copper. The women wear bracelets, 
necklets, and rings round Angers and toes, made of small red and blue 
])eads. In Gardulla I saw the flrst camels since my departure from 
Adis A))eba. Futarari Wolde has a large herd of these animals, 
ol)tained from the countries of the Bovana and Tertale, near Lake 
Stefanie, which are kept in a place at the foot of the mountains. 
Westward of Gardulla there is a large uninhal)ited plain, called by the 
Abyssinians ' ' Adoshcbai. " 

The spirit Adoshebai of the Ab3^ssinians combines the qualities of a 
devil and patron saint of the huntei's. They call upon Adoshebai when 
they have killed a lion, elephant, rhino, giraffe, or })uff'alo, and even a 
poor Shankala — that is to say, any of theii' large game. I may here 



THKOUGH SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA TO THE SUDAN. 785 

mention that the Abyssinians call Shankala not only the tril)e called 
Beni Shonf^ul ])y the Arabs, living on the western banks of the river 
Dal)us, but all the Sudanese and black people living in the countries 
round Lake Rudolf and near the Omo. That is all dark-colored people 
with the exception of the Sonial and the Galla. 

There is a legend that, when the Abyssinians conquered this country 
a])outseven years ago, two elephant hunters were descending from the 
'' Katama" Gardulhi to the large plain to the west. They had tiie luck 
to kill one of the large pachyderms near a small hill, and called on 
their patron saint, when suddenly the hill ])egan to dance and sing. 
"Adoshe])ai, Adoshebaif. " 80 they now look upon the plain as the home 
of this spirit. The Abyssinians had also told me of a dangerous disease, 
which would kill all our nudes and horses, by which this plain is haunted. 
Nevertheless, I determined to cross it, as otherwise I should have had 
to follow" hence, as far as the Omo, the route taken by Captain Bottego. 
But 1 marched straight on without spending much time in hunting the 
game, which was abundant here. Elephants, rhinos, buffaloes, large 
herds of zebras, and hartbeests of a species new to science, were 
seen. In the night we were disturbed by the roaring of the lion. 

After two da3^s' marching we came to a river called Shambala by 
the Abyssinians of our escort. (3n the other side we saw natives run- 
ning away from their cotton fields in terrible fright. We were here 
in the country of the Male, which may be identical with the Mela 
mentioned by Donaldson Smith. The Male are not yet absolutely 
subjected by the Abyssinians. I gave presents to some old men and 
women, who were not quick enough to run away, and sent them back 
to their fellows, but I was not able to have any intercourse with the 
people, as the next da}^ nobody appeared. Here I found, for the first 
time, bows and poisoned arrows, while in all the countries passed l)efore 
the spear and sword were the only arms. Crossing the Barsa, another 
river flowing, like the Shambala, into Lake Stefanie, we came to Uba, 
a part of the equatorial province given by the Emperor Menelikto the 
Abyssinian count and Dejasmach Leontiefi'. There is a good fort in 
Uba, built by the brothers Seljan, now officers of Count Leontieff, 
formerly nuisicians and professional pedestrians. Neither of the two 
brothers were here, as they were recalled to Adis Abeba by the 
p]mpei-oi- on accoinit of some differences they had had with the natives. 

In Uba the illness which the Abyssinians had feared in tiie plain of 
Adoshebai" broke out among the mules. I had thought before that it 
might l)e the tsetse^ (ly disease, ])ut it now became clear that it was (he 
giand(M's. This disease seems to be endemic on all the northern aflluents 
of Lake Stefanie, as is shown by the experience of the late Captain 
Weilby, who lost most of his animals after passing th(> same ri^gion. I 
descended into the beautiful valley of the river Zenti, covered with 



786 THEOUGH SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA TO THE SUDAN. 

thick forest and magnificent palm trees, which separates Uba from 
Gofa. The Zenti runs northward into the Omo. 

Every day more of my mules and horses became afflicted with the 
disease, and many of them died. The representative of Dejasmach 
Lamma, the governor of Gofa, who was at the time in Adis Abeba, 
sent me native porters, who helped me to carry the baggage up the 
mountains of Gofa, which reach an altitude of about 10,000 feet above 
sea level. At a place call Gadat, near the capital Jala, I stopped for two 
weeks, and, in order to master the disease, isolated the sick animals 
and divided the others into small bodies. After that time 1 had saved 
al)out 25 out of 60. Meanwhile I had sent m}^ Abyssinian headman with 
a small escort to Adis Abeba, with orders to buy new nudes and horses 
there, and to come back as quickly as possible to Anderacha, the cap- 
ital of Kafl'a, which I had designed to be my starting point for the 
utdvnown lands in the west. From Gofa to Kafl'a the expedition w^ent 
on very slowly, because I was now dependent on native porters, whom 
I got by order of the Abyssinian governors from the smaller native 
chiefs, and who had to be changed when we came into the land of 
another chief, which was always after one or two days' short march. 
Crossing the rather bare valley of the Ergino, another afiluent of the 
Omo, I came to the country of Doko. 

The Uba and the Gofa, through whose countries I had passed, until 
here belong to the Wallamo tribe. The Doko are typical Bantu, and 
seem to be nearly related to the Garduila. The men walk about abso- 
lutel}^ naked, the women wear an apron made of cut banana leaves. 
They know how to weave cotton stufl's well, but seldom use them 
themselves. North of Doko is the country of Malo, inhabited by a 
Wallamo tribe. Hence, 1 descended to the Omo, which I managed to 
cross within two da3's, on rafts resting on inflated goatskins. In this 
region there is not much forest on the shores of the river, as the banks 
consist of gigantic gneiss blocks. At no place in Africa have I seen 
so many hippos as here. Walking down the banks I saw in half an 
hour more than a hundred heads appearing above the surface of the 
water. Every stony bank in the river was occupied by a family of 
these clumsy animals. They are not hunted here, and therefore not 
at all shy. 

North of the river lies the country of Kosha. Kosha and the neigh 
boring Konta are the only provinces 1 found in Abyssinia wdiere the 
slave trade is in full swing. At the large weekly markets you can see — 
besides cotton, coffee, flour, goats, and sheep — children sold in small or 
large lots. It is probable that this trade is due to the great famine 
by which these countries have been stricken during the last two or 
three years, and the children all seem to be quite happy at becoming the 
property of richer men, with Avhom they will be better fed. The 
houses of the Kosha chiefs are very interesting. They are long barn-

like .structures, about 15 feet high and 50 to f)0 feet long-, entirely 
covered in with grass. Here the rainy season was ushered in by 
terrible tempests, and for the next two months we had thunderstorms 
nearly every day. Near a place called Dereta we passed the " Kella" 
or gate of Kaffa. 

These south Ethiopian kingdoms — Kaffa, Jirama,Gera, and P]lnarea- 
of which we have still but an imperfect knowledge from the journeys 
of the Italian Cecchi and the Frenchmen d'Abbadie and Borreli, are 
separated from each other by an interesting system of fortitication. 
Where the countries are not bounded by high mountain chains, diffi- 
c-ult to cross, they are surrounded b}^ deep ditches and strong fences, 
which can onl}' be passed by means of a guarded gate called the 
"Kella." The Abyssinians, after having taken these countries, retained 
this system of fortification and the custom duties between the different 
countries. The export of slaves is absolutely forbidden, that of cattle 
onh" allowed bj^ permission of the governor. The whole south of 
Kaffa is one large forest; there is a broad road leading from the Kella 
to Anderacha, the new capital. It is absolutely impossible to pene- 
trate tlie forest which l)orders the road without using axes or bush 
knives. Scattered in clearings in the forest are the villages and coffee 
l«)lantations of the inhabitants, the Kaficho. These are said to be the 
descendents of the. old Ethiopians, who were isolated when Mohammed 
(Tran3re, Sultan of Tajura, smashed the old Ethiopian Empire, in the 
3^ears 1528-43. It is a fact that most of the Kaficho were Christians 
when the Emperor Menelik conquered Kaffa, about five years ago. Also 
tlie " Gez," the ecclesiastical language of the Abyssians, was still in 
use, but the language used l)y the Kaficho of to-da}" has noaftinity what- 
ever with the modern Abyssinian. Kaffa was f orpierl}^ ruled bypower- 
ful independent kings, to whom also nearly all the countries west of 
the Omo were subject. The last king, Savo Teheno, who had sub- 
mitted some 3^ears ago to Menelik, revolted, was defeated by the 
Abyssinians, and brought as prisoner to the old Abyssinian ca])ital 
Anivober, where he still lives. Kaffa and all the countries south of 
the Gojeb and west of the Omo were given to Ras Wolde Georgis, one 
of the favorites of Menelik. Kaffa was forraerh' the principal coffee- 
producing land in Africa, but when the Abyssinians took the countr}' 
many of the plantations were destroyed, and it is now inferior in that 
respect to the Kingdom of Jimma. The national dress of tlie Kaficho 
f ormerl}' consisted of long capes of reed, grass, or hemp. The men 
wear hats made of goat and colobus monkey skins; the M^omen conical 
hats of bast. These national costumes are now seldom seen in Kaffa, 
where the inhabitants dress like the Abyssinians, but they are still 
exclusivelv used in the trilnitary land of Gimirra, in the west. 

My headman reached Anderacha ten days after my arrival, and 
brought with liim some new men and some mules; but now my most

terril)lG time beo-an. Nearly all the Abyssiiiiaiis, and also my 13 
Somal, .stnu-k and refused to proceed to the iiidviiown countries 
westward, where the}' said they would all be killed. They went to 
the Abyssinian chiefs swearing* that they had only l)een enoaoed up to 
Kaffa. The small Al)yssinian chiefs (Has Wolde (ireoro-is and his chief 
officials being- in Adis Abel)a at the time) sympathized with my men, 
as, in spite of the Emperor's permission, they were afraid to let a 
European go out of the country. Much patience, much money, and 
many promises were needed to persuade m^^ Somal and al)out half of 
my Abyssinians to remain Avith me. As 1 was, therefore, in want of 
new men and also new mules and horses, I had to make an excursion 
to Jinnna, adjoining Kalfa on the northeast, and separated from it by 
the river Gojeb, an affluent of the Omo. Api)roaching the Northern 
Kella of Katfa, 1 found everywhere evidences of the last war with the 
Abyssinians. Near the road I saw strong fences and deep ditches, 
while the forest was virtually honeycombed with holes about 10 to 12 
feet deep, with a pointed stake in the middle of each. 

Jimma is almost the richest land of A])3^ssinia. The inha])itants are 
pure, well-])uilt (jalla. They are nearly all Mohammedans, as well as 
their king, Al^a Jifar, a very clever man, who at the right time sub- 
mitted to Menelik, and therefore retained his country. King Aba 
Jifar. who helped the A))yssinians very nmch in conquering Katfa, is 
now in great favor with the Emperoi'. The capital of Jinnna is Jiren, 
the most important market place in Abyssinia. I estimate that the 
Thursday market in Jiren is visited l»y nearly twenty to thirty thou- 
sand persons. From all the countries bordering the river Omo, and 
even from Adis Abeba, and other lands in southern Ethiopia, the 
Nagadis or Abyssinian merchants meet in Jiren to sell their wares. 
All the products of southern Ethiopia are sold there, in many double 
rows of stalls about a third of a mile long. 

Having enlisted 20 strong men and bought some dozens of mules 
and horses, I returned to Anderacha and started thence in the first 
week of April. Gimirra, which we reac^hed first, is a tributary land 
to Katfa; the people seem to be Kaficho, perhaps with a mixture of 
Nilotic blood. Their old king, Chotatu, and some of his companions 
are nearly 6^ feet high. They wear the national dress of Katfa, 
already described. The men often wear necklaces, with a string of 
Hyrax teeth hanging down their chest. In Gimirra is the last Ab3^s- 
sinian post. The people of Binesho, which we passed next, are in 
friendly relations Avith the Abyssinians, who will probably soon take 
possession of the countrj'^; the people of Shekho, which lies west of 
Binesho, are only another branch of the Binesho, but are absokitely 
independent, and the land is often plundered by Abyssinian razzias. 

The Binesho and the Shekho are of the Bantu stock, but are, per- 
haps, the most interesting tribes I ever met. Their language is hard

and sliiui) sounding'. Their ti<>iiros mv l)r()iid :ind luuscular; tiicv have 
diti'ei'eiit kinds of tattooing- on the chest and on the ])ack, hut tiieir 
most interesting- tattooing- is on the forehead, in which they cut verti- 
cal slits, Avhich gives them the aspect of wearing a horn. Tliey often 
wear capes made out of grass, like those of the Gimirra, and also 
capes made of cut hark, and, to my great astonishment, I also found 
clothes woven of hark, simihir to those worn in Uganda and Usoga. I 
never saw a woman, either in Shckho or in Hineslio, prol)al)ly l^ecause 
they are hrst placed in safety as the object most desired by the Ab3^s- 
sinians. I had to he very much on my guard h(n-e, as the Shekho 
were always lurking- in the bushes, trying to cut otf my men and kill 
them singly. Once they speared one of my horses while grazing, 
nevertheless I succeeded in avoiding any actual lighting. 

In Shekho I found a large river running w^estward. I believed 
this river to be the Gelo, discovered near its junction with the Ajul)a 
)>y the Italian Bottego, an opinion which Avas confirmed afterwards. 
Traveling- became very difficult here. The western slopes of the South 
Ethiopian plateau are cut b}" many deep ravines; the roads therefore 
were narrow and bad, and many of my mules became wounded and 
useless. As it flows westward, the river Gelo is lined on both sides 
l)y the densest forest. I could march only about 2 or o miles each 
day, and to cover that distance the men had mostly to cut the w^ay 
with axes and bush knives from morning till noon, after which the 
caravan was able to proceed. The inhabitants of this forest are the 
Mashango, who were very seldom seen, but we often found large 
traps made for hippos and water bucks, and loops made of creepi^-s 
for monkeys and other small animals going to the Avater. Already in 
Gimirra I had seen, far away to the west, a long mountain chain run- 
ning from north to south, called by the Galla "Gurafarda" — that is to 
sa}^, "horse's ear," from a sharp double peak in the middle. It took 
more than three weeks from Gimirra to reach the point where the 
Gelo pierces the mountains, forming- magnificent cascades. Some 
days after passing this gap, I saw from a bamboo-covered hill in the 
west a boundless bush and grass-covered dead flat, the plain of the 
Sobat and the beginning of the Sudan. Only a few granite hills arc 
scattered over it. Ascending one of these, I saw, far away, a large 
lake — Lake Tata — through Avhich the river (tcIo runs. Here we 
found the first villages of the Jambo, or Anyuak, who were the first 
true Nilotic people I met. They are a division of the great Shilluk 
tribe, which is spread over the whole eastern Sudan, and extends 
southward to the east shore of Lake Victoria. The few samples I 
obtained of their language show that it is scarcely distinguishable 
from that of the Kavirondo peoples on the east shores of Lake \'ictoria, 
whose country I passed on my first African journey in iHVi, 



790 THROUGH SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA TO THE SUDAN. 

Th(> land now beciinio more and more swampy. The Anyuak, 
poA^erty stricken through many Abyssinian razzias, live hidden away 
on small islands in these swamps. A large part of the people have 
migrated westward, and live in a state of semislavery nnder the pro- 
tection of the more powerful Nuar near the Egyptian fort of Nasser, on 
the Sobat. Approaching Lake Tata, the swamps became so numerous 
and deep that I turned south and marched tothe Akobo, or Ajuba, which 
river I reached near the village Gneum, where I struck Bottego's route. 
The attempt to march along the northern bank of the Akobo failed, 
because we stuck fast in the swamps, where 1 lost many of my mules; 
so, after two days, I marched back to Gneum and crossed the Ako])o. 
The country on the left shore of the river, which had here a north- 
westerly direction, was drier. 

As at that time I had only the maps of Bottego and Wollby, I 
concluded that the Akobo of Bottego and the larger Kuzi of Wcllb}^ 
must be one and the same river. I therefore hoped to get from here 
to Nasser dry-shod, but, instead of turning to the north, as I expected, 
the course of the river after a few days took a due westerly direction, 
winding in and out over an immense grassy plain. I was now in a 
ver}^ bad plight; my cattle and Hour had been a long time exhausted, 
the countr}^ was nearly uninhabited, and game, which had been plenti- 
ful on the first days on the river Akobo, became scarce. Glanders had 
broken out again, and every day more of my animals succuml)ed. 
Suddenly I reached the right bank of a slowly flowing river, full of 
crocodiles. It was now apparent to me that this was the Ruzi of 
Wellby, or, as it is called by the Nuar, the Pi])or. It was impossil)le 
to cross the Pibor \Aithout boats; so I recrossed the smaller Akobo in 
the hope that, marching on the right ])ank of the Pil)or, I might find 
A'illages with boats. iNIy situation liecame now desptM-ate; out of 05 
animals with which I had left Gimirra, I had only 13 nudes, 2 horses, 
and 2 donkeys left. 

All the stores not absolutely necessary were thrown into the I'iver. 
The same was done with all the tents except ni}^ own, as well as with 
my ])ooks and clothes, the only part of my belongings which 1 con- 
trived to bring safely home being my collections, photographs, diary, 
and route books. The day after we had passed the Akobo, I had 
alread}^ dug a hole in which to hide an o])ject which for tiie moment 
was only a useless weight — the tusks of an elephant 1 had shot in the 
(iurafarda Mountains — and 1 was just looking round my tent to see 
what more I could dispense with, when suddenly a great tunudt arose 
in the camp. I snatched up my rifle, as 1 thought an elephant or a 
girafie had come near the camp, ])ut my chief Somali jumped in, cry- 
ing, "Marka, marka."'* Abyssinians, Galla, and Somal were scream- 

" " Steaiiier, steamer."

ing', crying, dancing, and tiring tlieir gnns, all looking down the river. 
There wh.s a .steamer in .sight, slowly approaching and tilling nearly half 
the river bed. The Egyptian tlag wa.s ti\nng from the ma.st and two 
Europeans stood at the l)ow\ The steamer stopped alongside our 
camp and I welcomed the tirst of the P^uropeans in English, l)ut on 
hearing my name he answered me in pure German. It was Sir Rudolf 
Slatin,and the other gentleman Colonel Bluett, the mudir of Fashoda. 
1 went on hoard and everything was soon explained. Slatin Pasha and 
Colonel Bluett had come on a journey of inspection to Fort Nasser, on 
the Sobat, and thence they had had to proceed to a village called Kara- 
dong, on the Pibor, in order to settle some quarrels between two intlu- 
ential Nuar chiefs. On arriving here they had heard that a European 
was approaching with a large caravan and had decided to steam up the 
river in order to bring me assistance if recpiired. They had found me 
when 1 was just at the last extremit}'. Had I come two or three days 
later I should have been forced to make my way to Nasser by land, 
which would have been a ditficult task, considering the diseased state 
of my nudes and the probable hostility' of the Nuar, who had formerly 
been I'obbed by the Abyssinian raiders. There are still the ruins of a 
large Abyssinian fort near the junction of the rivi'rs Akobo and Pibor. 
As one of my Somal had the day l)efore shot a large bull girati'e, and 
in}' men had therefore provisions for four days, Slatin Pasha was kind 
enough to take me on board, w-ith all my men and my collections. 
The surviving mules were given to the Nuar of Karadong. 

The n(\\t day the steamer passed the point where, on the map of this 
region published by ]\lajor Austin in the (leographical Journal. 1!M)1,

having passed Lake Tata; the northern branch, wiiicii is possibly the

Passing the small Egyptian fort Nasser and the famous Fashoda, 
one of the sorriest-looking places in Africa, W(> steamed down to 
Khartum. Broad green, fertile plains alternated with acacia-covered 
scrub steppes. On the ])anks of the river we saw villages of the Nuar, 
the Dinka, and the Shilluk, with their lai'ge rounded huts. P]very- 
where we saw absolutely naked women and men, the latter mostly 
painted white, boisterously greeting the steamer. Tiiere were large 
herds of cattle, sheep, and goats, and in the Arab districts of the lower 
White Nile, c;im(ds, horses, and donkeys. A picture of peace and 
plenty is the Egy[)tian Sudan of to-day. We arrived at Khartum on 
June 15, and I there enjoyed tluMliarmlng hospitality of the sirdar.

PRIMEVAL JAPANESE." 



By Capt. F. Bkixklev. 



There are three written records of eTapan's early hi,stor3\ The 
oldest^ of them dates from the beginning- of the eighth centur}" of the 
Christian era, and deals with events extending back for fourteen hun- 
dred years. The compilation of this work was one of the most 
extraordinary feats eyer undertaken. The compiler had to construct 
the sounds of his own tongue by means of ideographs deyised for 
transcribing a foreign language. He had to render Japanese pho- 
netically by using Chinese ideographs. It was as though a man 
should set himself to commit Shakespeare's plays to writing b}- the aid 
of the cuneiform characters of Babylon. A book composed in the 
face of such difhculties could not conyey a yer}" clear idea of contem- 
porary speech or thought. The same is true, though in a less degree, 
of the other two*" volumes on which it is necessary to rel}'^ for knowl- 
edge of ancient Japan. 

It might reasonabl}' be anticipated, arguing from the analogy of 
other nations, that some plain practical theory would exist among the 
Japanese as to their own origin; that tradition would have supplied 
for them a proud creed identifying their forefathers with some of the 
renowned peoples of the earth, and that if the progenitors of the nim- 
ble- witted, active-bodied, refined, and high s})irited people now bid- 
ding so earnestl}' for a ])lace in the comity of great nations had 
migrated originall}^ from a land peopled ])y men possessing qualities, 
such as they themselves have for centuries displayed, many aimals 
descriptive of their prim(;val home would have l)een handed down 
through the ages. There are no such theories, no such aniial^. no 
such traditions.

794 PRIMEVAL JAPANESE, 

When the Japanese tii'st undertook to explain their own origin 
in the three books spoken of above, so unfettered were they by genuine 
reminiscences that they immediately had recourse to the supernatural 
and derived themselves from heaven. Reduced to its fundamental 
outlines, the legend they set down was that, in the earliest times, a 
group of the divine dwellers in the plains of high heaven descended to a 
place with a now unidentifiable name, and thence gradually pushing- 
eastward, established themselves in the " land of sunrise," giving to 
it a race of monarchs, direct scions of the goddess of light (Amate- 
rasu). Man}^ things are related al:)out these heaven-sent folk who 
peopled Japan hundreds of years before the Christian era. They are 
things that uuist be studied by any one desiring to make himself 
ac(|uainted with the essence of her indigenous religion or her pictorial 
and decorative arts, for they there play a picturesque and prominent 
part. But they have nothing to do with sober history. Possibly it may 
be urged that nations whose traditions deal with a Mount Sinai, a pil- 
lar of cloud and tire, and an immaculate conception, have no right to 
reject everj^thing supernatural in oriental annals. That superficial 
retort has, indeed, been made too. often. But l)ehind it there undoubt- 
edly lurks in the inner consciousness of the educated and intelligent 
Japanese a resolve not to scrutinize these things too closely. Whether 
or not the ''age of the gods" — kaminoyo — of which, as a child, he 
reads with implicit credence, and of which, as a man, he recognizes 
the political uses, should be openly relegated to the limbo of absurd- 
ities; whether the deities had to take part in an immodest dance in 
order to lure the offended sun goddess from a cave to which her 
brother's rudeness had driven her, thus plunging the universe in dark- 
ness; whether the god of impulse fought with the god of fire on the 
shores of the Island of Nine Provinces; whether the procreative divini- 
ties were inspired by a bird; whether the germs of a new civilization 
were carried across the sea by a prince begotten of the sunshine and 
born in the shape of a crimson jewel — these are not problems that 
receive very serious consideration in Japan, though neither a Colenso 
nor a Huxley has 3^et arisen to attack them publicly. They are 
rather allegories from which emerges the serviceable political doc- 
trine that the Emperors of Japan, being of divine origin, rule by 
divine right. It is the Japanese historian's method, or the Japanese 
mythologisfs manner, of descril)ing an attribute claimed until very 
recentl}" by all occidental sovereigns, and still asserted on behalf of 
some. As for the foreign student of Japan's ancient history, these 
weird myths and romantic allegories have induced him to dismiss it as 
a purelv imaginary product of later-day imagination. The transcen- 
dental elements woven into parts of the narrative discredit the whole 
in his eyes. And his scepticism is fortified by a generally-accepted 
hypothesis that the events of the thirteen opening centuries of the 



PRIMEVAL JAPATTESE, 795 

story were preserved solely l).y oral tradition. The three volumes 
which profess to tell alioiit the primeval creators of Japan, about 
fJimniu, the first mortal ruler, and about his human successors during 
a dozen centuries, are supposed to bo a collection of previoHsly unwrit- 
ten recollections, and it seems onl}" logical to doubt whether the out- 
lines of figures standing at the end of such a long avenue of hearsa}" 
can be anything but imaginary. Possibly that disbelief is too whole- 
sale; possibly it is too much to conclude that the Japanese had no kind 
of writing prior to their ac(iuisition of Chinese ideographs in the tifth 
century of the Christian ci-a. Rut. there is little apparent hope that 
the student will ever be in a position to decide these questions con- 
clusively- He must be content for the present to regard the annals of 
primeval Japan as an assemblage of heterogeneous fragments from the 
traditions of South Sea Islanders, of Central Asian tribes, of Manchu- 
rian Tartars, and of Siberian savages, who reached her shores at vari- 
ous epochs, sometimes drifted b}^ ocean curi'ents, sometimes crossing 
by ice-built bridges, sometimes migrating by less fortuitous routes. 

What these records, stripped of all their faliulous features, have to 
tell is this: 

At a remote date a certain race of highh^-civilizcd men — highly civ- 
ilized by comparison — arrived at the islands of Jaj^an. Migrating 
from the south, the adventurers landed on the southern island, Kiu- 
shiu, and found a fair country covered with luxurious vegetation and 
sparsely populated by savages living like beasts of the field, having 
no organized system of administration and incapal)le of offering per- 
manent resistance to the superior weapons and discipline of the invaders, 
who established themselves with little difliculty in the newly-found 
land. But on the main island two races of men very dift'erent from 
these savages had already gained a footing. One had its headquarters 
in the province of Izumo and claimed sovereignty over the whole 
countrj'. The other was concentrated in Yamato. Neither of these 
races knew of the other's existence, Izumo and Yamato being far apart. 
At the outset the immigrants who had newly arrived in Kiushiu imag- 
ined that the}" had to deal with the Izumo folk only. They began In- 
sending envoys. The fii'st of tliese, l)ribed by tiic Izumo rulers, made 
his home in the land he had been sent to spv out. The second forgot 
his duty in tiie ai'ms of an Izumo l)eauty whose hair fell to her aidcles. 
The third discharged his mission faithfully, but was put to deatii in 
Izumo. The secjucd of this sonunvhat conunonplace series of events 
was war. Putting forth their full sti-ength, the southern invaders 
shattered the power of the Izumo court and rec(Mved its su])missi()n. 
P)ut tliev did not transfer tlieir own coui't to tiie conciuered province. 
Ignorant that Izumo was a mer(> fraction of the main island, they 
imagined that no more regions I'emained to be su])jugated. By and 
bv thev discovered their mistake. Intellis-ence reached them tiiat far 



796 PRIMEVAL JAPANESE. 

away in the northeast a race of highly-civilized men, who had origi- 
nally come from ])eyond the sea in ships, were settled in the province 
of Yamato, holding- undisputed sway. To the conquest of these colo- 
nists Jimmii, who then ruled the southern immigrants, set out on a 
campaign which lasted fifteen years 'and ended, after some tierce light- 
ing, in the Yamato ruler's acknowledging their consanguinity with the 
invader and abdicating in his favor. 

^^^l(^tiler Jinunu's story be purely a figment of later-day imagina- 
tion, or whether it consists of poetically eni])ellislied facts, there can 
be no question about its interest, since it shows the kind of hero that 
subsequent generations were disposed to picture as the founder of the 
sacred dynasty, the chief of the Japanese race. The 3^oungest of four 
sons, he was nevertheless selected by his "divine" father to succeed 
to the rulership of the little colony of immigrants then settled in 
Kiubhiu, and his elder brothers obediently recognized this right of 
choice. He was not then called "Jimmu;" that is his posthunms 
name. Sanu, or Hiko Hohodemi, was his appellation, and he is repre- 
sented in the light of a kind of viking. Learning of Yamato and its 
rulers from a traveler who \dsited Kiushiu, he embarked all his avail- 
al)le forces in war vessels and set out upon a tour of aggression. 
Creeping along the eastern shore of Kiushiu, and finally entering the 
lidand Sea, the adventurers fought their way from point to pointy 
landing sometimes to do battle with native tribes, sometimes to con- 
struct new war junks, until, after fifteen years of fighting and wan- 
dering, they finally emerged from the northern end of the Inland Sea 
and established themselves in Yamato, destined to be thenceforth the 
imperial province of Japan. In this long series of campaigns the 
chieftain lost his three brothers. One fell in fight; two threw them- 
selves into the sea to calm a tempest that threatened to destro}^ the 
flotilla. Such are the deaths that Japanese in all ages have regarded 
as ideal exits from this mortal scene — deaths ])y the sword and deaths 
of loyal self-sacrifice. To the leader himself, after his decease, the 
posthumous name of Jimmu, or "the man of divine bravery," was 
given, t^^pifying the honor that has always attached to the professfon 
of arms in Japan. The distance from this primitive viking's starting 
point to the place where he established his capital and consummated 
his career of conquest can easily be traversed by a modern steamer in 
twice as many hours as the number of years devoted by Jimmu and 
his followers to the task. That the craft in which they traveled were 
of the most inetficient type may be gathered from the fact that tlie 
N'iking's progress eastward w^ould have been finally interrupted by the 
narrow strip of water dividing Kiushiu from the main island of Japan 
had not a fisherman seated on a turtle emboldened him to strike sea- 
ward. Thenceforth the turtle assumed a leading place in the mythol- 
^ST of Japan — the type of longevit}^, the messenger of the marine 



PRIMEVAL JAPANESE. 797 

deity, who dwelt in the crystal depths of the ocean, his palace peopled 
by lovely maidens. The goddess of the sun shone on Jimmn's enter- 
prise at times when tempest or fog- threatened serious peril, and a kite, 
circling overhead, indicated the direction of inhabited districts when 
he and his warriors had lost their way among mountains and forests. 

How much of all this was transmitted b}- tradition, written or oral, 
to the compilers of Jimmu's history in the eighth century; how much 
was a mere reflection of national customs which had then become 
sacred, and on which the political scholars of the time desired to set 
the seal of anticiue sanction, who shall determined If Sanu and his 
warriors brought with them the worship of the sun, that would ofl'er 
an interesting inference as to their origin. If the aid that they 
received from his light was suggested solely b}^ the grateful homage 
that rice cultivators, thirteen centuries later, had learned to pay to his 
beneficence, then the oldest written records of Japan nuist be read as 
mere transcripts of the faiths and fashions of the era when they were 
compiled, not as genuine traditions transmitted from previous ages. 
But such distinctions have never been recognized by the Japanese. 
With them these annals of their race's beginnings have always com- 
manded as inviolable credence as the Testaments of Christianit}" used 
to command in the Occident. From the lithographs that embellish 
modern bank notes the sun looks down on the semidivine conqueror, 
Jiunnu, and receives his homage. From the grand cordon of an order 
instituted by his hundred and twenty- seventh successor depends the 
kite that guided him through mountain fastnesses, and on a thousand 
works of art the genius of the tortoise shows him the path across the 
ocean. If these, picturesque elements were added by subsequent 
writers to the outlines of an ordinary armed invasion by foreign 
adventurers, the nation has received them and cherishes them to this 
day as articles of a sacred faith. 

The annals here briefl}' summarized reveal three tides of more or 
less civilized immigrants and a race of semibarbarous autochthons. 
All the learned researches of modern archaeologists and ethnologists 
do !iot teach us nnich more. It is now known with tolerable certainty 
that the so-called autochthons were composed of two swarms of 
colonists, l)otli coming from Siberia, though their advents were 
separated by a long inter\al. 

The tirst, archteologicallv indicated by pit dwellings and shell mounds 
still extant, were the Koro-pok-gui'u, or ''cave men." They are 
believed to ))e represented to-day l)v the inhabitants of Saghalien. the 
Kuriles, and southern Kamschatka. 

The second were the Aiiui, a flat-faced, heavy-jawed, hirsute people, 
who completely drove out their predecessors and took possession of 
the land. Th(> Ainu of that period had much in common with animals. 
They burrowed in the ground for shelter; thev recognized no distinc-

tion of sex in apparel oi- of coiisaiiyii-iiiity in intorcourse; they clad 
themselves in skins; they drank blood; they practiced cannibalism; 
they were insensible to benefits and perpetually resentful of injuries; 
they resorted to savao-ely cruel forms of punishment — severing the 
tendons of the leg-s, boiling the arms, slicing off the nose, etc.; they 
used stone implements, and, unceasingly resisting the civilized immi- 
griinfs who subsequently reached the islands, they were driven north- 
ward bv degrees, and finally pushed across the Tsugaru Strait into the 
island of Yezo. That long struggle, and the disasters and sufferings 
it entailed, i-adically changed the nature of the Ainu. They became 
timid, gentle, submissive folk; lost most of the faculties essential to 
survival in a racial contest, and dwindled to a luere renmant of semi- 
sa\'ages, incapable of progress, inditi'erent fo improvement, and pre- 
s(Miting a jnore and more vivid contrast to the energetic, intelligent, 
and iMubiti'ous Japanese. 

But these Japanese — who were they originally i? Whence did the 
three or more tides of inunigration set which ultimately coalesced to 
form iho race now standing at the head of Oriental peoples!* Strangely 
varying answers to this question have been furnished. Kampfer per- 
suaded himself that the primeval Japanese were a section of the build- 
ers of the Tower of Babel. Hyde-Clarke identified them with Turano- 
Africaiis who traveled eastward through Egypt, China, and Japan. 
Macleod recognized in them one of the lost tribes of Israel. Severjil 
Avriters have regarded them as Malayan colonists. Griffin was content 
to think that they are modern Ainu, and recent scholars incline to 
th(^ ))elief that they l)elonged to the Tartar-Mongolian stock of Central 
Asia. Sonu'thing of this diversity of view is due to the fact that the 
Japanese are not a pure race. They present sevei-al easily distinguish- 
able types, notably the patrician and the plebeian. This is not a 
question of mere coarseness in contrast with refinement; of the degen- 
eration due to toil and exposure as compared with the improvement 
produced by gentle living and mental (-ulture. The representative of 
the Japanese plebs has a conspicuously dark skin, prominent cheek 
bones, a large mouth, a robust and heavil}' boned physi([ue, a flat nose, 
full straight eyes, and a receding forehead. The aristocratic type is 
symmetrically and delicately built; his complexion varies from yellow 
to almost pure white; his eyes are narrow, set obliquely to the nose; 
the eyelids heavy; the eyebrows lofty; the mouth small; the face oval; 
the nose aquiline; the hand remarkably slender and supple. 

Here are two radically distinct types. What is more, they have 
))een distinguished by the Japanese themselves ev(>r sini-e any method 
of recording such distinctions existed. For from the time when he 
first ])egan to paint pictures, the Japanese artist recognized and repre- 
sented only one tyi)e of male and female beauty — namely, that dis- 
tinguished in a marked, often an exaggerated, degree by the features 



PRIMEVAL JAPANESE. 799 

enumerated a))Ove as belonging to the patrician class. There has Ikhmi 
no evolution in this matter. The painter had as clear a conception of 
his tj^pe ten centuries ago as he has to-day. Nothing seems more nat- 
ural than the supposition that this higher type represents the iinally 
dominant race of immigrants; the lower, their less civilized op])<)nents. 
The theory which seems to tit the facts best is that the fFapanese are 
compounded of elements fi'om Central and Southern Asia, and that 
they received their patrician type from the former, their plebeian 
from the latter. The Asiatic colonists arrived via Kon^a. But they 
were neither Koreans nor Chinese. That seems certain, though the 
evidence which proves it can not be detailed here. Chinese and 
Koreans came from time to time in later ages; came occasionally in 
great numbers, and were absorbed into the Japanese race, leaving on 
it some faint traces of the amalgamation, l^ut the original colonists 
did not set out from either China or Korea. Their ])irthplace was 
somewhere in the north of Central Asia. As for the South- Asian 
immigrants, they were drifted to Japan by a strange current calh^d 
the "Black Tide*" (Kuro-shiwo), which sweeps northward from the 
Philippines, and bending thence toward the east, touches the promon- 
tory of Kii and Yamato before shaping its course permanently away 
from the main island of Japan. It is true that in the chronological 
order suggested })y eai'ly history the southern colonists succeeded the 
northern and are supposed to have gained the mastery; whereas among 
the Japanese, as we now see them, the supremacy of the northern 
type appears to have been established for ages. That may b(^ 
explained, however, by an easy hypothesis — namely, that although 
the onset of the impetuous southerns proved at first irresistible, they 
ultimately coalesced with the tribes they had conquered, and in the 
end the principle of natural selection replaced th(> vanquished on theii* 
proper plane of eminence. But this distinction, it must be observed. 
is one of outward form rather than of moral attributes. Neither 
history nor observation furnishes any reason for asserting that the 
so-called "aristocratic," or Mongoloid, cast of features accompanies a 
fuller endowment of either ph^'sical or mental qualities than the vul- 
gar, or Malayan, cast. Numericall}' the patrician typo constitutes 
only a small fraction of the nation, and seems to have been lacking in 
a majority of the country's past leaders, as it is certainly lacking in a 
majority of her present publicists, and even in the very creme do la 
crerae of society. The male of the upper classes is not generally an 
attractive product of nature. M(^ has neither commanding stature, 
retinement of features, nor weight of nuiscle. On the other hand, 
among the laboring populations, and especially among the seaside 
folk, numbers of men are found who. though l)elow the average 
Anglo-Saxon or Teuton in bulk, are cast in a perfectly synuuetrical 



800 PRIMEVAL JAPANESE. 

mold and suggest great possibilities of muscular effort and endurance. 
In siiort, though the aristocratic type has survived, and though its 
superior beauty is universall}^ recognized, it has not unpressed itself 
completely on the nation, and there is no difficulty in conceiving that 
its representatives went down before the first rush of the southern 
invaders, but su))sequently, by tenacity of resistance and l^y fortitude 
under suffering, recovered from a shock which would have crushed a 
lower grade of humanity. 

Histories that describe the manners and customs of a people have 
been rare in all ages. The compilers of Japan's first annals, in the 
eighth century, paid little attention to this part of their task. Were 
it necessary to rely on their narrative solely for a knowledge of the 
primeval Japanese, the student would be meagerly informed. But 
archeology comes to his assistance. It raises these men of old from 
their graves, and reveals many particulars of their civilization which 
could never have been divined from the written records alone. 

The ancient Japanese — not the Koro-pok-guru or the Ainu, but the 
ancestors of the Japanese proper — buried their dead iirst in barrows 
and afterwards in dolmens. The barrow was merely a mound of earth 
heaped over the remains, after the manner of the Chinese. The dol- 
men was a stone chamber. It had walls constructed with blocks of 
stone, generally unhewn and rudely laid, but sometimes hewn and 
carefully titted; its roof consisted of huge and ponderous slabs. It 
varied in form — sometimes taking the shape of a long gallery only, 
sometimes of a gallery and a chamber, and sometimes of a gallery and 
two chambers. Over it was built a mound of earth which occasionally 
assumed enormous dimensions, covering a space of TO or 80 acres, 
rising to a height of as many feet, and requiring the labor of thousands 
of workmen. The ])uilders of the barrows were in the bronze age of 
civilization, the constructors of the dolmens in the iron age. In the 
barrows are found weapons and implements of bronze and vessels of 
hand-made pottery; in the dolmens, weapons and implements of iron 
and vessels of wheel-turned pottery. There is an absolute line of 
division. No iron weapon nor any machine-made pottery occurs in a 
barrow, no bronze weapon nor any hand-made pottery in a dolmen. 
Are the barrow builders and the dolmen constructors to be regarded 
as distinct races or as men of the same race at different stages of its 
ci\ilization? Barrow and dolmen bear common testimony to the fact 
that before the ancestors of the Japanese nation crossed the sea to 
their inland home the}^ had already emerged from the stone age, for 
neither in barrow nor in dolmen have stone weapons or implements been 
found, though these abound in the shell heaps and kitchen middens that 
constitute the relics of the Koro-pok-guru and the Ainu. But, on the 
other hand, l)arrow and dolmen introduce their explorer to peoples 
who stood on different planes of industrial development. 



PRIMEVAL JAPANESE. 801 

The progress of civilization is always gradual. A nation does not 
pass, in one stride, from })urial in rude tumuli to sepulture in liighh' 
specialized forms of stone vaults, rior 3'et from a l)ronze age to an 
iron. It is therefore evident that the evolution of dolmen from bar- 
row did not take place within Japan. The dolmen constructor must 
have completely emerged from the bronze age and abandoned the 
fashion of barrow burial before he reached Japan. Otherwise search 
would certainly disclose some transitional form between the barrow 
and the dolmen, and some iron implements would occur in the bar- 
rows or bronze weapons in the dolmens. If, then, the barrow builder 
and the dolmen constructor were raciall}' identical, it would seem to 
follow that the latter succeeded the former by a long interval in the 
order of immigration and brought with him a greatl}^ improved t} pe 
of civilization evolved in the country of his origin. 

The reader will he naturally disposed to anticipate that the gecr- 
graphical distribution of the dolmens and the barrows furnishes some 
aid in solving this problem. But though the exceptional number 
found on the coasts opposite to Korea tends to support the theory that 
the stream of Mongoloid immigration came chiefly from the Korean 
Peninsula via the island of Tsushima, there is not any local difl'erenti- 
ation of one kind of sepulture from the other, and, for the rest, the 
grouping of the dolmens supplies no information except that their 
builders occupied the tract of country from the shores opposite Korea 
on the west to Musashi and the south of Shimotsuke on the east, and 
did not penetrate to the extreme northeast or to the regions of moun- 
tain and forest in the interior. 

Here another point suggests itself. If the fashion of the Japanese 
dolmen was introduced from abroad, evidences of its prototype should 
survive on the adjacent continent of Asia. If the numerous dolmens 
found on the coasts of Kiushiu and Isumo facing Korea are to be taken 
as indications that their constructors emigrated originally from the 
Korean Peninsula, then Korea also should contain similar dolmens, and 
if an ethnological connection existed between Japan and (Jhina in pre- 
historic da3\s, China, too, shoidd have dolmens. But no dolmens have 
hitherto been found in China, and the dolmens of Korea differ radi- 
cally from those of Japan, being "merely cists with megalithic cap- 
stones"' (Gowland). It has been shown, further, that dolmens similar 
to those of Japan are not to be found in an}' part of continental Asia 
eastward of the shores of the Caspian Sea, and that western Europe 
alone offers exacth' analogous types. In short, from an ethnological 
point of view, the dolmens of Japan are as perplexing as the dolmens 
of Europe, and the prospect of solving the riddle seems to be equally 
remote in T)oth cases. All that can be affirmed is that the dolmens 
offer strong corroborative testimony to the truth of the Japanese his- 
torical narrative which represents Jimmu as the leader of the last and 



802 PRIMEVAL JAPANESE. 

most liighlj civilized among the bjinds of colonists constituting the 
iincestors of the present Japanese race. Thus the "divine warrior," 
after having been temporarily erased from the tal)lets of history I)}' 
the modern sceptic of the West, is projected upon them once more 
from the newly opened graves of the primeval Japanese. It is true 
that there is an ai'itluiietical difficulty. It has ])een supposed that the 
dolmens do not date from a period more remote than the third century 
l»efore Christ, whereas Jimnufs invasion is assigned to the seventh. 
But no great eti'ort of imagination is required to effect a compromise 
between the uncertain chronology of the Japanese annals and the 
tentative estimates of modei'n archeologists. 

Some of the l)urial customs revealed by these ancient tombs resem- 
ble the hal)its of the Scythians as descrilx'd by Herodotus. The Japa- 
nese did not, it is true, lay the corpse of a chieftain between sheets of 
g'old, nor did they inter his favorite wife with similar pomp in an 
adjoining chamber; ])utthey did deposit with hiiu his weapons, hisorna- 
UKMits, and the trap})ings of his war horse, and in remote times they 
followed th(» l)ar])arous ]-ule of burying alive, in the inuiiediate vicin- 
ity of his sepuk'lier, his personal attendants, male and female, and 
prol)a1)ly also his steed. To the abrogation of that cruel rule is due 
nuich information al)Out the garments worn in early epochs, for in the 
century immediately preceding the Christian era a kind-hearted 
emperor decided that clay figures should be substituted for hutuan 
victims, and these tigures, being modeled, however roughl}', in the 
guise of the men and women of the time, tell what kind of costumes 
were worn and what was the manner of wearing them. Collecting all 
the available evidence, the story shapes itself into this: 

Prior to the third, or perhaps the fourth century before the Chris- 
tian era, when the dead were interred in barrows, not dolmens, the 
Japanese, though they stood on a plane considerably a])Ove the gen- 
eral'level of Asiatic civilization, did not yet understand the forging of 
iron or the use of the potter\s wheel. They were still in the bronze 
age, and their weapons — swords, halberds, and arrowheads — were 
made of that metal. Concerning the fashion of their garments not 
much is known, but they used for purpose of personal adornment, 
quaintly shaped o})jects of jasper, rock crystal, steatite, and other 
stones. Then, owing probably to the advent of a second wave of 
immigration from the continent, the civilization of the nation was sud- 
denly raised, and the country passed at once from the bronze to the 
iron age, with a corresponding development of industrial capacity in 
other directions, and with a novel method of sepulture having no 
exact prototype except in western Europe. The newcomers seem to 
have been, not a race distinct from their predecessors, but a second out- 
growth of colonists from the same parent stem. Where that stem had 
its roots there is no clear indication, but it is evident that, during the 



PRIMEVAL JAPAN ESE. 803 

interval between thetii'.standtlie second inignitions, the mother country 
had far excelled its colony in material civilization, so that, with the 
advent of the second band of wanderers, the condition of the Japanese 
und(>r\vent marked change. They laid aside their bronze weapons and 
began to use iron swords and spears, and iron-tipped arrows. A warrior 
carried one :?wordand, perhaps, a dagger. The sword had a blade which 
varied from 2^ feet to over '4 feet in length. These were not the 
curved weapons with curiously modeled faces and wonderful trench- 
ancy wliich becanu^ so celebrated in later times. Straight, one-edgt'd 
swords, formidable enough, but considerably inferior to the admirable 
katana of medieval and modern eras, they were sheathed in wooden 
scal)l)ards, having ])ands and hoops of copper, silver, or iron, by means 
of which the weapon was suspended from the girdle. The guards 
were of iron, copper, or l)ronze, often coated Avith gold, and always 
having holes cut in them to render them lighter. Wood was the 
material used for hilt as well as for scabbard, but generally in the 
former case and sometimes in the latter a thin sheet of copper witii 
gold plating enveloped the wood. Doul)le bart)s characterized the 
arrowhead, and as these projected about 4 inches beyond the shaft, a 
bow of great strength must have been uscxl, though of only medium 
length. Armor does not seem to have l)een generall}' worn, or to 
have served for covering any part of the body, except the head and 
the breast. It was of iron, and it took the shape of thin bands of 
metal, riveted together for cascjue and cuirass. Neith(>r brassart, 
visor, nor greaves have been foiuid in any dolmen, and thougii sole- 
rets of copper are among the objects exhumed, they appear to iiave 
been rather ornamental than defensive. As to shields, nothing is 
known. No trace of them has been found, and it seems a reasonable 
inference that they were not used. Horses evidently played an impor- 
tant part in the lives of the second batch of immigrants, for horse 
furniture constantly appears among the ol)jects found in dolmens. 
The bit is almost identical with the common "snaffle''' of the Occident. 
Made of iron, it has siderings or cheek pieces ot the same metal, elab- 
orately shaped and often sheeted with gilded copper. The saddle was 
of wood, peaked before and behind and braced with metal bands, and 
numerous ornaments of repousse iron covered with sheets of gilt or 
silvered copper were attached to the trappings. Among these orna- 
ments a peculiar form of bell is present, an oblate hollow sphere, hav- 
ing a long slit in its shell and containing a loose metal pellet. Stirrups 
are seldom found in the dolmens, and the rare specimens hitherto 
exhumed bear no resemblance to the large, heavy, shoe-shaixnl atlairs 
of later ages, but are rather of the Occidental type. 

The costume of these ancient Japanese had little in conunon with 
that of their modern descendants. They wore an upper garment of 
woven stutt' fashioned after the manner of a looselv lifting tunic, and 



804 PRIMEVAL JA.PANESF. 

conlined at the waist b}' a girdle, and they had loose trousers reaching 
nearly to the feet. For ornaments they used necklaces of beads or of 
rings — silver, stone, or glass; finger rings, sometimes of silver or gold, 
sometimes of copper, bronze, or iron, plated with one of the precious 
metals; ring-shaped buttons; metal armlets; bands or plates of gilt 
copper, which were attached to the tunic; earrings of golcf, and tiaras. 
Not one item in this catalogue, the tiara excepted, appears among the 
garments or personal ornaments of the Japanese since their history 
and ha])its began to ))e known to the outer world. No nation has 
undergone a more radical change of taste in the matter of habiliments 
and adornments. The earring, the necklace, the linger ring, the brace- 
let, and the band or plate of metal attached to the tunic — all these 
passed completely out of vogue so long ago that, without the evidence 
of tlie contents of the dolmen, it would be impossible to conceive the 
existence of such things in Japan. One of the most noteworthy 
features of the people's iiabits in medieval or modern times is that, 
with the solitar}' exception of pins and fillets for the hair, they eschew 
every class of personal ornament. Yet the dolmens indicate that per- 
sonal adornments were abimdantly, if not profusely, employed by the 
ancestors of these same Japanese in prehistoric days. Indeed, the 
only features connuon to the fashions of the Japanese as they are now 
known and the Japanese as their sepulchers reveal them are the rich 
decoration of the sword hilt and scabbard and of the war horse's 
trappings. 

As to the food of these early people, it seems to have consisted of 
fish, rtesh, and cereals. They used wine of some kind, though of its 
nature there is no knowledge, and their household utensils were of 
pottery, graceful in outline, but unglazed and archaicalh* decorated. 
Whether or not they possessed cattle there is no evidence, nor yet is 
it known what means they employed to produce fire, though the fire 
drill appears to be the most probable. 

That they believed in a future state is evident, since they buried 
with the dead whatever implements and weapons might be necessary 
in the life beyond the grave; that ancestral worship constituted an 
important part of their religious cult is proved by the otterings period- 
icall}' made at the tombs of the deceased; and that idolatry was not 
practised or superstition largel}' prevalent may be deduced from the 
complete absence of charms or amulets among the remains found in 
their sepulchers. 



THE KOREAN LANGUAGE.^ 



By Homer B. Hulbert. 



The Korean language belongs to that wideh' disseminated family to 
which the term Turanian has" sometimes been applied. This term is 
sufficiently indefinite to match the subject, for scholarship has not yet 
determined with any degree of exactitude the limits of its dispersion. 
At its widest reach it includes Turkish, Hungarian, Basque, Lappish, 
Finnish, Ouigour, Ostiak, SamoiA'ed, Mordwin, Manchu, Mongol (and 
other Tartar and Siberian dialects), Japanese, Korean, Tamil, Telugu, 
Canarese, Malayalam (and the other Dravidian dialects), Malay and a 
great number of the Polynesian and Australasian dialects reaching 
north along the coast of Asia through the Philippine Islands and 
Formosa and south and east into New Guinea, New Hebrides, and 
Australia. 

The main point which differentiates this whole family of languages 
from the Aryan and Semitic stocks is the agglutinative principle, 
whereby declension and conjugation are effected b}" the addition of 
positions and suffixes and not b}- a modification of the stem. In all 
these different languages the stem of a word remains as a rule intact 
through ever}^ form of granuiiatical manipulation. That Korean belongs 
to this family of languages is seen in its strictly agglutinative char- 
acter. There has been absolutely no deviation from this principle. 
There are no exceptions. Any typical Korean verb can l)e conjugated 
through its one thousand different forms without finding the least 
change in the stem. A comparison of Korean with Manchu discloses 
at once a family likeness and at the same time a comparison of Korean 
with any ont> of the Dravidian dialects discloses a still closer kinship. 
It is an interesting fact that not one of the Chinese dialects possesses 
any of the distinctive features of this Tui'anian family. There is more 
similarity l)etween Chinese and English than between Chinese and any 
one of the Turanian languages. In other words, China has been even 
more thoroughly isolated linguistically than she has socially; and the

806 THE KOREAN LANGUAGE. 

eAndence ^oes to prove thut at some period eiionnoiisly remote, after 
the original Chinese had effected an entrance to the mighty um[)hi- 
theater Ix'tween the Central Asian mountains on the one hand and the 
Pacitic i)n the other, they were surrounded l>v a suhsecjuent race who 
impinged upon them at every point and con({uered them not once or 
twice, but who never succeeded in leaving a single trace upon her 
unique and primitive language. This surrounding family was the 
Turanian, and Korean forms one link in the chain. Korean bears 
almost precisely the same relation to Chinese that P^nglish does to 
Latin, English has retained its own distinct grammatical structure 
while drawing an immense number of words from the romance dialects 
for the purposes of embellishment and precision. The same holds 
true of Korean. She has never surrendered a single point to C'liinese 
gi'ammar, juid yet has borrowed eagerly from the Chinese glossary as 
convenience or necessity has recjuired. Chinese 'n^ the Latin of the 
Far East, for just as Rome, through her higher civilization, lent thou- 
sands of words to the semisavages hovering along her borders, so 
Ciuna has furnished all the surrounding peoples with their scientitic, 
legal, })hilosophical, and religious terminology. The development of 
Chinese grammar was earl}^ checked by the ijifiuence of the ideograph, 
and so she has never htid anything to lend her neigh])ors in the way 
of grammatical inflection. 

The granunars of Korea and Japan are pi'actically identical; and 
yet, strange to say, with the exception of the words they liave l)oth 
borrowed from China theirglossaries are marvelousl}^ dissimilar. This 
forms one of the most obscure philological problems of the Far East. 
The identity in graunnatical structure, however, stamps them as sister 
languag(\s. 

The study of Korean grannuar is rendered interesting ])v the fact 
that in the surrounding of China by Turanian peoples, Korea was the 
l)lace where the two surrounding ])ranches met and completed the cir- 
cuit. Northern Korea was settled from the north by Turanian people. 
Southern Koi'ca was settled from the south by Turanian people. It 
was not until 1!»3 b. c. that each became definitely aware of the pres- 
ence of the other. At first they refused to acknowledge the relation- 
ship, but the fact that when in (>90 a. d. the southern kingdom of 
Sil-la assumed control of the whole peninsula there remained no such 
line of social cleavage as that which obtained between the English and 
the Norman after 1()(!6, shows that an intrinsic similarity of language 
and of racial aptitude quickly closed the breach and made Korea the 
unit that she is to-day. 

Korean is an agglutinative, polysyllabic language w hose develo))- 
ment is marvelously complete and at the same time marNclously sym- 
uietrical. We find no such long list of exce])tions as that which 
entangles in its web the student of the Indo-European languages. In 



THE KOREAN LANGUAGE. 807 

Korean as in most of the Turanian languages the idea of gender is ver}^ 
imperfectly developed, which argues perhaps a lack of imagination. 
The ideas of person and number are largeh^ left to the context for 
determination, but in the matter of logical sequence the Korean verb 
is carried to the extreme of development. 

The Korean's keen sense of social distinctions has given rise to a 
complete system of honorifics, whose proper use is essential to a 
rational use of the language. And yet numerous as these may l)e their 
use is so regulated ])y unwritten law and there are so few exceptions 
that they are far easier to master than the personal terminations of 
Indo-European verbs. The granunatical superiority of Korean over 
many of the western languages is that while in the latter dift'erences 
of gender, nuiuber, and person, which would usually be perfectl}' clear 
from the context, are carefully noted, in the Korean these are left to 
the speaker's and the hearer's perspicacity and attention is concentrated 
upon a terse and luminous collocation of ideas; which is often secured 
in the west onl v by a tedious circumlocution. 

The genius of the language has led the Korean to express every pos- 
sible verbal relation by a separate modal form. The extent to which 
this has been carried can be shown onh' by illustration. Besides 
having simple forms to express the different tenses and the different 
modes, indicative, potential, conditional, imperative, infinitive, it has 
simple forms to express all those luore delicate verbal relations which 
in English require a circumlocution or the use of various adverbs. 
For instance, the Korean has a special mode to express necessity, con- 
tingency, surprise, reproof, antithesis, conjunction, temporal sequence, 
logical sequence, interruption, duration of time, limit of time, acqui- 
escence, expostulation, interrogation, promise, exhortation, impreca- 
tion, desire, doubt, hypothesis, satisfaction, propriety", concession, 
intention, decision, probability, possibility, prohibition, simultaneity, 
continuity, repetition, inf requency, hearsa}', agenc}^, contempt, ability, 
and many other relations. Each one of these ideas can be expressed 
in coimection with an}" active verb by the simple addition of one or 
more inseparable suffixes. By far the greater number of these suffixes 
are monosyllables. 

To illustrate the delicate shades of thought that can be expressed bj' 
the addition of a suffix, let us take the English expression ''1 was 
going along the road, when suddenly !"' This, without any thing- 
more, implies that the act of going was interrupted by some unfore- 
seen circumstance. This would be expressed in Korean by three 
little words n{i-ga="I,'' kil-e = "along the road," ka-ta-ga=*' was 
going, when suddenly ." The stem of the verb is ka and the sud- 
den interruption of the action is expressed by the ending ta-ga; and, 
what is more, this ending has absolutely no other use. It is reserved 

SM 1903 52 



808 THE KOREAN LANGUAGE. 

soleW for the purpose of expressing- succiiictl^y this shade of thought. 
The little word kal-ka of which ka is the stem, meaning- "go," con- 
tains all the meaning that we put into the words "I wonder now 
whether he will really go or not." Someone asks you if you are going, 
and all you need to say is "'ka-na'' to express the complete idea of 
•• What in the world would I be g'oing- for? Absurd!" 

Another thing which dilferentiates Korean from the languages of 
the west is the wide ditference between book language and spoken 
language. Many of the g-rammatical forms are the same in both, but 
besides these there is a full set of grammatical endings used in books 
only while at the same time there are many endings in the vernacular 
that could never be put in print. The result is very unfortunate, for 
of necessity no conversation can be written down ver})atim. It must 
all he changed into indirect discourse, and the vernacular endings 
must largely be changed to the book endings. This must not be 
charged up against the Korean, for it came in with the Chinese, and 
is but one of the thousand ways in which their overpowering intlu- 
ence, in spite of all it has done for Korea, has stunted her intellectual 
development. V^e would not imply that these literary endings are 
borrowed from the Chinese, for such is rarely the case; but as Korea 
has little literature except such as has grown up beneath the wing of 
China, it was inevitable that certain endings would be reserved for the 
formal writing of l)ooks while others were considered good enough 
only to be bandied from mouth to mouth. It is of course impossible 
to sa}' what Korea would have accomplished had she been given a free 
rein to evolve a literature for herself, but we can not doubt that it 
would have been infinitely more spontaneous and lifelike than that 
Avhich now obtains. 

From a linguistic standpoint the Koreans are proljably far more 
homogeneous than any portion of the Chinese people \jin^ between 
equal extremes of latitude. There is in Korea no such thing as dia- 
lects. There are diti'erent "brogues" in the peninsula, and the Seoul 
man can generally tell the province from which a counti'vman comes 
by his speech. But it would be wide of the truth to assert that 
Koreans from different parts of the country can not easily understand 
each other. To be sure there are some few words peculiar to indi- 
vidual provinces, but these are mutual I3' known just as the four words 
"guess," ''reckon," "allow," and "calculate," while peculiar to cer- 
tain definite sections of the United States, are universal!}" understood. 

A word in conclusion must be said regarding the laws of Korean 
euphony. No people have followed more implicitly nature's law in 
the matter of euphon3\ It has not been done in the careless manner 
that changed the magnificent name Caesar Augustus to the slovenly 
Saragossa, but the incomparable law of the convertibility of surds 
and sonants which is characteristic of the Turanian languages is 



THE KOREAN LANGUAGE. 809 

worked out to its ultimate end in Korean. Tlie nice adjustment of 
the organs of speech whereby conllicting sounds are so modified as 
to blend harmonioush' is one of tlie unconscious Korean arts. Who 
told them to change the labial surd "p" of Ap-nok to its corresponding 
labial nasal "m'' before the following nasal, which leaves the eupho- 
nious word aimok: or to change the lingual nasal ""n" of in-pi to its 
coi'responding labial nasal "m'' l)efore the labial surd ''p," giving the 
phoneticallj" correct impi i The evidence goes to show that the 
euphonic tendency in Korea has not broken down the vocabulary as 
is sometimes the case. Prof. Max Midler speaks of the law of pho- 
netic deca}^; and rightl}^ so, when the romance languages are under 
discussion, but in Korea this law would better ])e called one of phonetic 
adjustment. When rough stones are put together to form a roadbed, 
if they are of good qualit}" they work down together, get their cor- 
ners knocked off, and form a solid and durable surface; but it' the 
stone is poor the pieces will mutually pulverize each other and the road 
will be worthless. The former of these processes represents phonetic 
adjustment while the latter represents phonetic decay. The compar- 
ative virility of French and Italian speech, in spite of phonetic decav, 
is brought about by the compensating law of dialectic regeneration, but 
the Portuguese language, for instance, shows no such vitality. Cross- 
breeding is as necessary to the vitalit}" of a language as grafting is to 
the production of good fruit. 

Another feature which specially characterizes Korean speech is the 
great number of . mimetic w^ords, or, as the}^ are sometimes called, 
onomatopoeia. As Korean colors are drawn directlv from nature, so 
a great number of its words are phonetic descriptions. And the rea- 
son why such primitive nature-words are still found intact in a lan- 
guage so highly developed as the Korean is because the principle of 
reduplication, common in all the Turanian languages, is carried to the 
extreme in Korean. A reduplicated mimetic word carries on its 
very face its mimetic quality, and consequently the ver}^ conspicuous- 
ness of this quality has prevented change. Its very raison d'etre 
being its phonetic description of the object or the act, a change in the 
sound is rendered very unlikely. For instance, the Korean word 
t'ul-biik fill bilk means precisely what an English or an American Ijoy 
would express b}^ the word "ker-splash!"' which is itself keenly 
mimetic. In Korean the syllable t'iil, and in English the "ker" rep- 
resents the sharp spat with which a heavy body strikes the surface of 
the water, and the Korean buk represents the heavy sound which fol- 
lows when the water comes together over the object. In P^nglish the 
splash represents rather the spray thrown up by the impact of the 
water. It will readily ])o seen that tiie I'eduplication of the t'ld-buk 
would tend to secure permanency in the proiuuiciation. Mimetic 
words in English have so often lost their evident mimetic (piality; as 



810 THE KOREAT^ LANGUAGE. 

in the word "sword," which was orioinally pronounced witli the "w," 
in imitation of the sound of the weapon sweeping- through the air, but 
having lost the w sound it now has no phonetic signiticance. One 
hardly needs a dictionary to learn the meaning of Korean onomato- 
poeia. AVhat could "jing-geu-rung jang-geu-riing"" mean but the 
jingle-jangle of })ells or of the steel rings on the horses' bridles^ So 
again mulsin nudsin means soft to the touch, based on the same idea 
as our word ■'mellow'' in which the softest sounds of human speech, 
•' m" and •"l." are used. On the other hand bak-bak means hard, 
stiti'. unyielding, after the analogy of our word "brittle,"" which 
is doubtless mimetic. The Koi'ean word whose stem is ch'i means to 
strike or hit, and is the phonetic equivalent of our vulgar word 
"chug."' whose mimetic origin cannot be doubted. One nmst con- 
chide that the prevahmce of mimetic words in all lang-uages forms a 
serious obstacle to the studv of philology, for attempts on the part of 
widely separated people to produce a phonetic description of an o})ject, 
tpiality. or act that is common to them both is most likely to result in 
similar sounds. And these, later, form dangerous traps into which 
the eager and unwary philologue is prone to fall. 

It may l)e asked whether the Korean language is adapted to public 
speaking. We would answer that it is eminently so. For, in the 
first place, it is a sonorous, vocal language. The Koreans say that in 
any syllable the vowel is the ""mother"" and the consonant is the 
"child."' showing that they have grasped the essential idea that vowel 
sounds form the basis of human speech. The sibilant element is much 
less conspicuous in Korean than in Japanese and one needs only to 
heal- a public speech in Japanese and one in Korean to discover the 
vast advantage which Korean enjoys. Then again, the almost total 
lack of accent in Japanese words is a serious drawl)ack from the point 
of view of oratory. So far as Ave can see there is nothing in Korean 
speech that makes it less adapted to oratory than English or any other 
western tongue. In common with the language of Cicero and Demos- 
thenes. Korean is composed of periodic sentences, by Avhich we mean 
that each sentence reaches its climax in the verb, which comes at the 
end; and there are no weakening addenda, such as often make the 
English sentence an anticlimax. In this respect the Korean surpasses 
English as a medium for public speaking. 



THE REPUBLIC 0¥ PANAMA. « 



By Prof. Wm. II. Burr, 
Of till' Isthmian Canal Commissio7i. 



The 3'ouno-est of the American i-epublics has ahiiost the oldest history. 
The Caribl)can coast hne of Cok)iiibia and of Panama was one of the 
earliest localities visited by the old Spanish navigators. One of them, 
Alonzo de Ojeda, visited a number of places along- this coast in 1499 
and 1501, while Columbus visited Porto Bello, 25 miles northeast of 
Colon, and other places in 1502, during his last A^oyage. From those 
dates onward all this portion of the Spanish main was constantly visited, 
explored, and apportioned among Spanish officials. ]\lany expeditions 
of discover}' w^ere made inland, until all that north westerlv portion of 
South America which has so long been known as Venezuela. Colombia, 
and Ecuador was complete!}' explored and a fair knowledge of its 
resources, mineral and otherwise, obtained. 

One of the most important incidents in these exploring expeditions 
occurred when Vasco Nunez de Balboa, governor of the province in 
Darien, first set out southward from his capital, Santa Maria de la 
Antigua, prompted by what the Indians had told him, and from an 
elevation on the divide north of the Gulf of San Miguel, discovered 
the Pacific Ocean on the 25th day of September, 1513. Many of the 
earliest historical events of the Republic of Panama are associated with 
this intrepid explorer. He was on the Isthmus but a short period, 
but his restless energy was ever prompting him to new enterprises of 
exploration and aggrandizement of territory for his home government. 
His remarkable career wns cut short in 1517 by his execution at Ada, 
on the Caril)bean shore of the Gulf of Darien, by a jealous governor 
of the province, who feared that Balboa's fruitful enterprises might 
give him sufficient eclat to make him the head of the new Spanish 
territory in place of himself. 

The Spanish discoverers found all this countrv. like others of South 
and Central America, peopled with large numbers of Indians. 

The territory constituting the present Republic of Panama, as well 
as the northwesterly portion and west coast of South America, was 
carefully scoured in search of the precious metals of w Inch fabulous

812 THE EEPUBLIC OF PANAMA. 

stories were related by the natives, many of which were justitied by 
subsequent results. Ball)oa himself yisited the Pearl Islands in the Ba}^ 
of Panama. These operations of the early Spaniards inyolyed fre- 
quent crossing of the Isthmus, and eyen before the death of Balboa 
it ))ecame evident that the most practicable line of transportation was 
that which is now known as the Panama route. 

Many attempts were made to find other practicable routes across 
the Isthmus l)etween the Atrato River, emptying into the Gulf of 
Darien, and the Chagres River, emptying into the Caribbean Sea 8 
miles west of Colon, but the advantages of the Panama route were 
promptly recognized by the Spaniards. 

A ten-itory, consisting largel}^ of the present Panama, Colombia, 
and Venezuela, was formed into the province of Tierra-tirma. It was 
the governor of this province, Pedro Arias de Avila, who, to 
strengthen his authority, brought charges against Balboa, and after a 
form of trial executed him at Ada. By the middle of the sixteenth 
century large numbers of Spaniards had migrated to this country and 
created flourishing centers of trade. About this time, in order to 
secure a more suitable government for his colony, the Spanish emperor 
created the presidency of New Granada, which was subsequently 
raised to the rank of a viceroyaltv in 1T18, then including not only 
Colombia and Venezuela but Ecuador also. The territory of the 
Isthmus formed the northwestern arm of this Spanish appanage. 

Like that of most Spanish colonies, the government of the country 
was corrupt, l)eing administered largely for the ])enetit of the favored 
few in authority; but on the whole the country flourished, the popula- 
tion increased, and trade extended along the lines of production of the 
country. 

THE REVOLUTION AGAINST SPANISH AUTHORITY. 

The course of afl'airs in the viceroyalty continued without much 
change until 1811. Many features of the Spanish rule had long borne 
heavily upon the people and aroused such feeling that at last they broke 
out into an insurrection against the home government. A continuous 
war against the Spanish forces sent to put down the insurrection con- 
tinued until 1821, when Spanish authority disappeared. Meantime 
the Venezuelan patriot, Simon Bolivar, born in the city of Caracas in 
1783, made his way into prominence in national affairs, and in 1819 
completed a mi ion of the three divisions of the country into the first 
Republic of Colombia. This republic was short lived. Venezuela 
withdrew in 1829 and Ecuador in 1830. The creation of the Repulilic 
of New Granada followed in 1831, but its constitution was not formed 
until 1832. Under it the territory was divided into eighteen provinces. 
The president of the new republic held office four 3'ears. The course 
of afli'airs was much disturbed, and a civil war broke out after one or 



THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA. 813 

two presidential terms and did not close until 1841. In IS-iO the prov- 
ince of Cartag-ena seceded from the new republic, and immediatel}" 
thereafter the neighboring- provinces of Panama and Veragua took the 
same step. This was the tirst period of independence of the Isthmus 
of Panama. The revolting States were soon reunited under a consti- 
tution reformed in 1843. The Republic of New Granada enjo>'ed little 
tranquillity, being su])ject to domestic disturbances of greater or less 
magnitude almost continuously, but various measures signif3'ing gen- 
eral advancement in civilization were adopted from time to time. 
Among those was one by which slavery was entirely abolished in 
1852. 

An important alteration of the constitution took place in 1853, 
under wdiich the provinces were merely federated into the Republic, 
each l)eing granted the right to assume its independence at any time. 
This right under the constitution was asserted by Antioquia and 
Panama in 1856 and 1857, this being the second independence of the 
Province of Panama. Stornn^ times followed these national upheavals, 
and the independence of the provinces was not long undisturbed. A 
congress at Bogota established a republic under the name of the 
United States of Colombia in 1861. adopting a new federal constitu- 
tion for the purpose of including all the territor}^ hitherto held by 
the Republic of Colombia, including the Isthmus of Panama. The 
opposite party, however, victorious in the western portion of the 
countr}", declined to acknowledge the authority at Bogota. Internal 
disturbances of all degrees, including the assassination of leaders and 
bloody battles, constituted the programme until 1862, when the oppos- 
ing parties came to terms to a sufficient extent to permit the appoint- 
ment of a provincial government and the drawing up of a constitution. 
At this time another attempt, not successful, was made to reestal)lish 
the former Republic of the three countries — Venezuela, Colombia, and 
Ecuador — but under the constitution adopted May 8, 1863, the Republic 
of Colombia was erected, and it has endured to the present time. Insur- 
rections and internal disorganizations prevailed for a number of 3'ears, 
and the history of the Republic has been accentuated by frequent 
revolutions, many of whicli have taken place in Panama. 

EXTENT OF THE PRESENT REPUBLIC. 

This brings us to the consideration of tiie Repu))lic of Panama as it 
now stands, having declared its independence on November 3, 1903. 
The Republic of Panama is identical in territorial limits with the 
Department of Panama of the Repul)lic of Colombia. This Depart- 
ment extended from Costa Rica on the west to a line drawn lirst nearly 
due south from Cape Tiburon at the southern limit of the Gulf of 
Darien, then southwesterly to a i)oint on the Pacific coast a short dis- 
tance southeast of Punta Cocalito. This last or eastern limit of the 



814. IHE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA. 

Department of Panama is almost entirely" along- the divide Ijetween the 
Atrato River and the watershed draining into the Gulf of San Miguel. 

The Republic of Panama lies between the parallels of 7- 15' and 9-" 
north latitude, and also between TT-^ 15' and 82^ 30' longitude west 
from Greenwich. Approximately speaking, therefore, its extreme 
length east and west is about 350 miles, and its extreme width north 
and south 120 miles. Its population is not well determined, but it 
pro))ably does not exceed 300,000. This population is largely com- 
posed of people of Spanish descent, but there are also large numbers 
of negroes, who have come chielly from Jamaica during the construct- 
ing work conducted by the old Panama Company. A few Chinamen 
have also found their way to the Isthnms and become permanent resi- 
dents. The native Indians are also occasionallv seen on the zone of 
population between Panama and Colon. These races have been min- 
gled in all conceivable proportions, so that the features or racial 
characteristics of one or more, or even all of these various national- 
ities, may be traced in the face of a single individual. Some of the old 
Spanish families have still retained the purity of their blood and are 
among the prominent people of the Isthmus. Its entire area is about 
31,600 square miles, or about the area of the State of Indiana. 

The Cordillera forming the main mountain ridge extending from 
South to North America and constituting the continental divide run-s 
through the entire length of the Republic of Panama, in the eastern 
portion the divide being nu;ch nearer the Caril)bean Sea than the 
Pacilic Ocean, while in the western portion its location is more nearly 
central. The low notch or saddle in the Cordillera near the city of 
Panama, with a summit elevation about 300 feet above sea level, the 
lowest throughout the Central American Isthmus except at Nicaragua, 
ati'ords the railroad location built upon nearly fifty 3'ears ago and the 
reconunended route for the Isthmian ship canal. 

Not less than one-half of the entire territory of the Republic is 
mountainous and covered with luxuriant tropical vegetation, including 
heavy forest trees, some of which are among the highly valuable woods. 
These forests are practically trackless. Tribes of Indians, not in large 
numbers, live along the Caribbean coast between Panama and Darien, 
and also on the southern slopes. Some of these Indians preserve 
jealously their isolation, and have never acknowledged the sovereignty 
of any government. 

rANA3IA RAILROAD. 

The most prominent feature of the Republic of Panama is the 
Panama Railroad and the partially constructed canal, with the adjacent 
strip of territory, including the cities and towns, with their aggregated 
business or industrial centers, along the line from Colon to Panama. 

This railroad, a single-track line of 5 feet gauge, was built nearly 
fiity years ago. It is but 19 miles longj and it is conducted practically 



THE EEPUBLIC OF PATiAMA. 815 

as an American railroad corporation, althoiioh it is owned by the new 
Panama Canal Compan3\ The principal offices of the company are in 
the city of New York. This company does not confine itself wholly to 
railroad business, but owns and conducts the line of steamers running 
between the ports of New York and Colon under the name of the 
Panama Railroad-Steamship Company. 

The railroad forms a line of land transportation to which converges 
mai'ine conunerce from many widely separated ports of the world. 
On the Pacific side steamship lines plying- up and down the west coast 
of South America, and the Pacific mail steamships touching along the 
North and Central America coast from San Francisco southward, 
together with other ships approaching from the Pacific Ocean, have 
made Panama their terminal port for many years. The port of Colon 
has an equally extensive ocean shipping business, with not less than 
nine or ten steamship lines from Spain, France, England, Germany, 
Italy, and the United States, making it either a terminal port or port 
of call. In addition to these ocean steamship lines there is a little 
coasting trade of a local character on both sides of the Isthmus carried 
on in small sailing vessels. 

The Panama Railroad has always been a prominent transportation 
line, along which currents of commerce and streams of passenger traf- 
fic, fed by the steamship lines on the two oceans, have continuously 
flowed. Latterly a considerable banana trade has also sprung up along 
the railroad line. 

KELATIOX OF THE ISTHMUS TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. 

The location of the Isthmus is markedly central to that portion of 
;:he through commerce of the world which would be served by the 
Panama Canal. It is practically a halfway station between the ports 
of eastern Asia, Australia, and the islands between and the ports of 
Europe. It is believed that the opening of the canal will create a 
highly stimulating influence upon the trade between the west coast of 
South America and the ports of the Cnited States — a business which 
has hitherto been developed chiefl}" with foreign ports. The geograph- 
ical relation of the Republic of Panama to some of the principal ports 
of the world is shown by the following statement of the distances in 
nautical miles to be sailed by steam vessels on the respective trips

816 THE KEPUBLIC OF PANAMA. 

RESOUKCES OF THE REPUBLIC. 

The mineral resources of the Republic of Panama are practicallj^ 
undeveloped, although it is known that there are consideral)le deposits 
of coal of fair (piality — perhaps of excellent quality — not far from the 
railroad and Canal Zone. The precious metals are found in small 
quantities at mau}^ points, with indications of greater value; hut these 
resources, like many others of the new Republic, are in such an unde- 
veloped stage that no definite statement can be made as to their poten- 
tial value. 

The agricultural resources of the country are greater than ordinar- 
ily supposed. There is excellent grazing land near Colon, along the 
Panama Railroad, and within a few miles of the city of Panama. 
Farther west, in the Chiriqui district, and on the Pacific side of that 
portion of the Isthnuis, there are extensive stretches of country well 
adapted to agricultural purposes, both for grazing and for the raising 
of all those tropical products which grow in such luxuriance through- 
out the fertile portions of Central America and the Isthmus. Fine 
grades of stock in substantial numbers are already found on some 
portions of the Tstlnnus, and dairy farming is alreadv conducted in the 
vicinitv of Panama. 

Large stretches of native forests of valuable timber, such as mahog- 
any, both light and dark, and other similar woods are found throughout 
the Republic, l)ut are yet practically undeveloped. Such valua])le 
tropical products as cacao, bananas of all kinds, sugar cane, indigo, 
cotton, tol)acco, vanilla, corn, rice, and other similar products grow 
in abundance, and conditions of systematic industry only are needed 
to develop them into sources of great wealth to the country. Under 
the encouraging infiuences of a stable government, where life and 
property are respected, the national resources of the Republic of 
Panama v/ill be productive of an amount of wealth which, if stated in 
a quantitative way, would now^ be incredible, in view of the crude and 
depressed conditions of industry which have prevailed from the begin- 
ning of its history to the present time. 

COMMUNICATION. 

There are pract'cally no roads found in the Republic except those of 
a crude and ill-kept kind near to the cities or towns along the line of 
the Panama Railroad Company between Colon and Panama. The only 
marked exception to this statement is the old so-called Royal road 
built between Cruces, on the upper Chagre.^, to Panama, a distance of 
al)out 17 miles. This old road, formerly a crudely paved way, was 
traveled by passengers crossing the Isthnms before the construction 
of the Panama Railroad. This traffic found its way up the Chagres 
River to the small native town of Cruces, now containing a few scores 



THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA. 817 

of people, unci then passed overland from that point either on foot or 
horseback, or by such crude vehicles as the countrv afforded, to Pan- 
ama. It was by this route that many people went to California during 
the gold excitement of 1849 and the years immediately following. 
This road has been abandoned for many years, as has the ancient road 
from Portobello to Panama. 

The greater portion of the territory of the Republic is of small 
elevation, with many large marshes along the seacoast. Even the 
mountainous portions east and southeast of the railroad, forming the 
Darien country, are not high, probably in no case exceeding an eleva- 
tion of 2,800 feet. The arable land on either side of the Isthmus is 
mostly ground of low elevation. 

CLIMATE. 

The climate of the Isthmus is thoroughly tropical in character, but 
it is by no means entitled to the l)ad name which is so frequently given 
to it. In speaking of this climate, all business and social activity in 
the Republic of Panama is so centered in the vicinity of the railroad 
line, which is also practically the proposed canal route, that observa- 
tions as to climatic or other conditions apph" strictly to this vicinity, 
although they are practically the same for other parts of the Republic. 

At Panama the Isthmus is scarcely more than 40 miles wide. The 
proximity of the two oceans necessaril}- affects the climate in a marked 
manner. The continental divide at this location is low, rising to an eleva- 
tion but little more than 300 feet above mean sea level. Winds there- 
fore blow across the entire Isthmus almost unobstructed. Under the 
tropical sun the evaporation from the two oceans is rapid, and the conse- 
quence is an atmosphere highly charged with aqueous vapor at nearly 
all times. The high temperature of the tropical climate is therefore 
accentuated with great humidity, which is enervating to a marked 
degree to those who have been bred in a temperate climate. 

The tem})erature at Colon, on the Caribbean side of the Isthmus, not 
often rises above 90'^ F., although it occasionally reaches 98" or even 
a little higher, as in December, 1885 (98.2°), and January and March, 
1886 (98.2 ), the latter year l)eing an unusually hot one. The mean 
of the maximum monthh' temperature that year was 95.2° F. The 
usual maximum monthly temperature ranges from about 85 F. to 
about 91° or 92"^ F. The minimum monthly t(>nq)eratur(> usually 
ranges from about 60° F. to about 75 F., the mean minimum monthly 
temperature being l)ut little under 70° F. The mean temperature 
throughout the year is not far from 80° F. The interior points of the 
Isthmus, such as (lamboa and OI)ispo, about halfway across the Isth- 
mus on the railroad line, generally experience maximum temperatures 
perhaps 2 or 3 degrees higher than at Colon, and mininumi tem])era- 
tures perhaps 3 or 4 degrees lower than at that point. On the Pacilic 



818 THE EEPUBLIC OF PANAMA. 

side the temperature may run a degree or two higher than at Colon. 
For all ordinary purposes it may be stated that there is no sensible 
difference in temperature on the two sides of the Isthmus, nor in other 
climatic conditions except the rainfall, which differs sensibl3\ On the 
high ground at Culebra, Avhere the canal and railroad lines cut the 
continental divide, and where the elevation is from 200 to 300 feet 
above sea level, the air is cooler and dryer than at either seacoast. 
These figures show that the ruling temperatures on the Isthmus are 
not so high as those shown by the hottest weather of a New York or 
Washington summer; l)ut the temperatures, such as they are on the 
Isthmus, continue without material abatement. 

The low latitude of the Isthmus of I^anama, the farthest point north 
lying in latitude 9'^, brings the sun at the zenith twice during the year, 
once at noon on April 13 on its journey northw^ard, and the second 
time at noon on August 29, on its return southward toward the win- 
ter solstice. At the summer solstice its elevation above the north 
horizon is 75- 41' and 57^ 24' above the south horizon at the winter 
solstice. These conditions introduce an approach to uniformity in the 
temperature of the varying seasons, as they also produce opposite 
prevailing winds in different portions of the year. As the direct rays 
of the sun tend to cause the hot air to rise vertically under it during 
those portions of the year when the sun is north of the zenith, the 
prevailing winds arc southerly or soiithwT\sterly, but when it is south 
of the zenith the same causes make the prevailing winds from north 
or northeasterly. It is in this portion of the j^ear when at rare inter- 
vals the northers blow into the harlior of Colon with such severity as 
to require ships found in it to put to sea for their safety. 

The year on the Isthmus is divided into the dry season and the wet 
season. The dry season covers the four months of January, Febru- 
arj, March, and April, during which little or no rain falls. The wet 
season is composed of the remaining eight months of the ^^ear, the 
wettest portions being usually in May and in Octol)er. The rainfall 
on the Caril)bean side — i. e., at Colon — is considerably greater than 
either in the interior or on the Pacific side, its annual amount usually 
ranging from about Aij to nearly 1.55 inches, with an average of about 
125 to 13<> inches. In the interior, as at Gamboa or Bas Obispo, the 
annual precipitation varies ordinarily from about 75 to nearly 140 
inches, with an average of 90 to 95 inches. The total precipitation at 
Panama, however, may vary from about 45 to about 85 inches per 
annum, with an average of al)out QQ to »J7 inches. As the average 
annual precipitation in New York or Washington may vary approxi- 
mately from 40 to 50 inches, it is seen that the wet season in the 
Republic of Panama exhibits relatively high rainfall, although not 
more than about one-half of that which occui's at Greytown, in 
Nicaraoua. 



THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA. 819 

During the wet months there are some phenomenal downpours, 
with the effect of turning- rivers into torrents, and this is particularly 
the case with the Chagres River, the principal river of the Republic, 
which empties into the Caribbean Sea about 8 miles west of Colon. 
Passing up this river from its mouth, its general course lies southeast 
for a distance of nearly 30 miles to Obispo. Still passing upstream, 
its course at this point turns sharpl}' to the northeast. From Obispo 
for a distance of about 23 miles downstream the course of the Panama 
Railroad and the line of the proposed canal follow the Chagres River 
to the lowlands adjoining the Caribbean coast. In the other direction, 
however, both the railroad and the canal leave the river at Obispo and 
cut through the continental divide toward Panama, the Panama end of 
the canal being about 20 miles from Obispo. 

VARIOUS PRO.JECTS FOR A SHIP CANAL. 

At the present time the greatest interest centering on the Republic 
of Panama, aside from the remarkable unanimity with which the 
people of the Isthmus as a unit declared and secured their independ- 
ence through a single, effective, but bloodless effort, is that which 
attaches to the proposed ship canal connecting the two oceans practi- 
cally along the line of the Panama Railroad. The project of an 
isthmian ship canal is almost as old as the discovery of the Isthmus, 
for it is nearl}' -ioO years ago that the Spaniards themselves seriously 
discussed this enterprise. As early as 1520 the Spanish monarch, 
Charles V, directed a survey to be made for the purpose of determin- 
ing the feasibility of an isthmian ship canal. From that time until 
this the project of a ship canal across the Isthmus has been actively 
discussed, although as a result of that early survey the Spanish gov- 
ernor declared ''that such a work was impracticable, and that no king, 
however powerful he might be, was capable of forming a junction of 
the two seas, or of furnishing the means of carrying out such an 
undertaking." The followers of the Spanish governor were less 
easily discourged than he. 

The ship-canal enterprise gathered advocates from one centurj- to 
another, until, during the nineteenth centurj' and the first 3'ears of the 
twentieth, man}' careful surveys of possible routes across the Isthmus 
were made. The principal of those lying in the Repul)lic of Panama, 
beginning with the most easterly, are the Caledonia route, the San 
Bias route, and the Panama route. The Caledonia route has at times 
attracted nmch attention on account of the highly colored but a))so- 
lutely false accounts rendered of it by one or two early explorers. 
The northern extremity of this route, at Caledonia Bay, is about 165 
miles east of Colon, and crosses the Isthnuis in the main in a south- 
westerly direction. The surveys of the Isthmian Canal Commission 
showed that the elevation of the divide at this point and the heavy

work to he done along- its line were far too g-reat to permit its feasi- 
bility being- considered in comparison with that of the Panama route. 
The San Bias route, the Caribbean end of which is on the Gulf of San 
Bias, is about 60 miles east of Colon. This route has the distinguish- 
ing characteristic of being located on pi'obably the shortest line 
between the tide waters of the two oceans on the Isthnuis, this distance 
])eing scarcely 30 miles. The short length of this line has secured for 
it a number of earnest advocates. It also was subject to surve}" by 
the engineering parties of the Isthmian Commission. The elevation 
of the divide at this crossing is so great as to necessitate the consider- 
ation of a ship tunnel from 5 to 7 miles long, the canal being planned 
as a sea-level waterway. The great cost of a canal on this line and 
the hazards attending such a construction as a ship tunnel rendered 
this route, like the Caledonia line, neither practicable nor feasible, 
compared with the Panama route. 

Many surveys and examinations have been made at different cross- 
ings of the Central American isthnuis between Tehuantepec, in Mex- 
ico, and the eastern limit of the Republic of Panama. As earnest and 
as enthusiastic as the supporters of other routes have been, the most 
complete and exact surveys and estimates have shown that the Panama 
route embodies the greatest number of advantages of any line ever 
considered for a ship canal between the two oceans. It is a tribute to 
the sagacity and good judgment of the old Spanish explorers that they 
also settled upon practically this route as the most feasil)le and prac- 
ticable for the same purpose. 

The proposed Panama line, favorably reported upon by the Isthmian 
Canal Commission and now adopted as the basis of the treaty being 
negotiated between the United States and the Republic of Panama, 
begins at Colon and extends in a southeasterly direction to a point on 
the bay of Panama near the city of that name, and has a total length 
of 49.07 miles between the six-fathom curves in the two oceans. At 
the present time the citv of Colon has a population of probably about 
3,000 people, while the city of Panama has a population of perhaps 
2.5,000 people. The population scattered along the line of the railroad 
may add 10,000 to 15,000 more, making a total of perhaps 1:0,000 to 
1:.5,000 people in the 10-mile strip of territory between the two oceans 
within which the railroad is found and the canal will be built. 

THE PLAN OF DE LESSEPS. 

This canal route is that which was adopted at the International 
Scientific Congress convened in Paris in May, 1S79, luider the auspices 
of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the concession for the canal having been 
obtained from the Republic of Colom))ia in the preceding- year by 
Lieut. L. N. B. Wyse, a French naval ofhcer. This congress not only 
selected the Panama route, but also decided that the waterway to be

constructed should be a sea-level canal. A compan}^ entitled "Com- 
pag-nie Universelle du Canal Interoceanique," and commonly known as 
the Old Panama Canal Compan}^ was immediately organized to con- 
struct the work. After various efforts it linanced the enterprise and 
began work, which was prosecuted until May 15, 1889, when the com- 
pany went into bankruptcy, and its effects were put into the hands of 
ii liquidator — an officer of the French court corresponding closely to 
the American receiver. 

Prior to the bankruptcy of the old compan}^ the project for a sea- 
level canal was temporarily abandoned in the hope that the funds, 
available might be sufficient for the construction of a lock canal. 
After various vicissitudes the new Panama Canal Company was organ- 
ized on the 20th of October, 1891. Work was resumed on the canal 
immediately thereafter, and has been continued until the present time, 
the force employed, however, being small. The old company raised 
by the sale of stocks and bonds not far from $216,000,000, and it has 
been stated that the number of persons holding the securities was over 
200,000. 

When the concession for building the Panama Railroad was secured 
from the Colombian Government, control of all available transporta- 
tion routes across the Isthnuis in the territory of the present Republic 
of Panama was covered by it. The construction of the ship canal by 
the old Panama Canal Company was, therefore, subject to the rights 
conveyed in the Panama Railroad concession. In order to control this 
feature of the situation, therefore, the old Panama Company purchased 
nearly the entire stock of the railroad company, which thus became a 
part of the assets of the new Panama Canal Compan3\ 

KECOMMEXDATIOXS OF THE ISTHMIAN COMMISSION. . . 

When the Isthmian Canal Commission made its first visit of investi- 
gation of the canal routes four years ago, it found a large amount of 
excavation and other work done along the line of the canal,' as well as 
a large amount of land, buildings, structures, and many plans and 
papers, all constituting a part of the property of the new Panama 
Canal Company. All this property was situated on the Isthmus, 
except a mass of plans and papers in the office of the canal company 
at Paris. The Commission, in its report under date of November 16, 
1901, recommended, in case of selection of the Panama route, payment 
of $40,000,000 to the new Panama Canal Company for all its property, 
rights, and concessions connected with the unfinished canal. That 
offer, as made by the United States Government, has since been 
accepted b}' the French company. 

The Isthmian Canal Connnission adopted the French line for its 
estimates, but made some material changes in the plans for the work. 
The canal as plamied by the Connnission is a lock canal, its typical or 



822 THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA. 

standard section for firm eartli liaving- a bottom width of 150 feet, a 
minimum depth of water of 35 feet, and a top width of 269 feet. This 
section is suitably modified for harbor sections, for sections in soft 
o-round, for sections in rock and in hikes and wherever required bj^ 
unusual conditions. These adopted sections would afford ample water- 
way for the greatest ships afloat at the present time, as required b}" 
the law creating- the Commission. 

The locks for this canal are great masonry constructions, having a 
usable length of T-iO feet with a clear width of 84 feet, more than 
large enough to accommodate any vessel now afloat or planned to be 
built. 

Beginning at the 6-fathom curve in the harl)or of Colon, the canal 
is planned to l)e excavated for a distance of 7 miles through the low, 
marsh}' grounds in that vicinity to Gatun, where the line meets the 
Chagres River. From that point to Bohio, about 17 miles from Colon, 
a little east of south from the point of starting, the canal would be 
excavated generalh' along the marshy lowlands through which the 
Chagres River flows in that vicinity, cutting the course of that river 
four or five times. This 17-mile section of the canal is a sea-level 
section, but at Bohio is found a comparatively narrow place in the 
valley of the Chagres River with I'ock outcroppings on one side and 
at which a dam may be built. At this point it was the purpose of the 
French company also to build a dam, but the Isthmian Canal Com- 
mission provisionall}" located its dam at a site nearlv half a mile 
downstream from that of the French dam. and proposes to build it 
materially higher. 

GREAT DAM AT BOHIO. 

This dam would retain behind it the waters of the Chagres River at 
an elevation varying from 85 feet to !M) or 92 feet above mean sea level, 
thus forming what has been called Lake Bohio. It would back up the 
water of the Chagres River for a distance of about 20 miles, through 
about 11 of which the course of tlie canal would l)e laid. Lake Bohio 
would constitute the summit level of the canal, and would be reached 
by two great masonry locks built together, i. e., in series near one 
end of the dam at Bohio, the lift of each one of these two locks being 
45 feet as a maximum. These locks would be built as twin structures, 
so that if an accident should happen to one side the other side would 
still be available foi- use, and thus save the operation of the canal from 
being broken. A great ledge of rock afl'ords an excellent site for the 
construction of these locks. 

The building of this great dam at Bohio, with its top nearly 100 
feet above the water in the river in its normal condition, is one of the 
great works of the entire canal construction. As the safety and oper- 
ation of the canal would depend entirely upon the stability of this 



THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA. 823 

dam, the Commission recommended a plan of construction In- which a 
masoni\v core wall 3<t feet thick at the bottom and 8 feet at the top 
w^ould be built up from the rock beneath the bed of the river to the 
top of the dam, thus efficiently preventing- all leakage of water through 
the porous sand and gravel, of which large portions of the substrata 
beneath the river bed are composed. 

As the top of this daui would have an elevation of lot) feet above 
the sea, and as the highest water in Lake Bohio would l)e S feet lower 
than that elevation, no water would ever overflow this dam, but the 
surplus of flood waters of the ('hagres River would be discharged over 
a masonrv spillway about 3 miles from the dam. The spillway weir 
would be of masonry' and about 2,000 feet long. Its location is in a 
notch or depression in the ridge between the headwaters of a small 
tributarv of the Chagres called the Gigante and the valley of the C'ha- 
gres River. The crest of this 2,000-foot-long overflow would be 8.5 
feet above sea level. It is estimated that with the greatest flood pos- 
sible in the Chagres River the depth of water on the overflow weir 
would not be greater than T feet. During a great flood, therefore, 
the river would discharge into this lake, and its waters would accumu- 
late there until deep enough to run over the masonry spillway. With 
the flood in a rising stage, the amount flowing over the spillway would 
increase up to the greatest flood height, after which the rate of dis- 
charge over the spillway would decrease. This regulation of the 
Chagres floods, therefore, takes care of itself. It requires no atten- 
tion. After discharging over the spill wa}", the flood waters would 
flow through an artiflcial channel down into the Chagres River beyond 
any of the canal works and where no damage would be done. 

About 10 miles up the Chagres from Obispo, at a point called Allia- 
juela, there is an excellent site for a dam. It has been proposed to 
build at this Alhajuela site a great masonry dam for the purpose of 
impounding flood waters of the Chagres River to the extent of the 
storage capacity behind the dam, and so reduce the flood eft'ects in 
Lake Bohio. This storage reservoir would also act as a source of feed 
water for the canal, should the traffic on it in the future become so 
large as to require this additional supply. 

CULEBRA CUT. 

From C)l)ispo, oO miles from Colon, the canal line runs toward the 
southeast through tlu> continental divide^ in a direct course toward 
Panama, and for nearly 7 miles fi'oni Obispo a great cut has to be 
made through the high ground forming that divide. For a distance of 
about 5 miles from Obispo this is known as \ho Emperador Cut, 
beyond which lies a mile and a half known as the Culebra Cut. The 
greatest depth of this cut at Culebra is al)()ut 250 feet, and the amount 
of material to be removed in this stretch of 7 miles of canal excava- 

SM ltt03 53 



824 THE KEPUBLIC OF PANAMA. 

tion is about 43,00(1,000 cubic ^^ards. It is the greatest single feature 
of the entire canal construction. 

The summit of Bohio Lake level ends ata point called Pedro Miguel, 
about li miles southeasterly of the Culebra Cut and 38 miles from 
Colon, where is located a flight of two locks arranged in twin plan like 
the others, each one of the pair having a lift varying from 27 to 31 
feet, according to the varying height of water in Lake Bohio. By 
means of these two locks the water surface in the canal is brought 
down to an elevation about 28 feet above sea level. The last lock on 
the line is at a point called Miraflores, a little less than a mile and a 
half from the Pedro Miguel locks. From Miraflores to the end of the 
canal, at a point called La Boca on the Bay of Panama, is less than 5 
miles, and this portion of the canal constitutes what may be called the 
Pacific section or level. 

The water of this Pacific section of the canal rises and falls coinci- 
dental ly with the tides in the Bay of Panama, and as the range of tide 
in that bay is about 20 feet, the oNIiraflores lock is largely a tidal lock. 
Its mininnun lift, therefore, at high tide, is 18 feet, while the maxi- 
nuun lift at low tide is 38 feet. It is obvious from these tidal condi- 
tions that if the canal were constructed as a sea-level canal a tidal lock 
would be needed at or near its Pacific end. That part of the canal 
line between ^Miraflores and the Bav of Panama is located closely along 
the course of the Rio (xrande, which is mainly a tidal river, its two 
principal tributaries above ^Mirafloi-es being Rio Pedro Miguel and 
Rio Caimitillo, ])oth being small and insignificant streams. 

The length of the canal between the shore lines is about 44 miles, 
although the length between the 6-fathom curves on the two sides of 
the Isthnms, as has alread}' been stated, is 41) miles. 13 of which lie in 
the artificial Lake Bohio. The creation of Lake Bohio would necessi- 
tate the relocation and rebuilding of the railroad between Bohio and 
Oliispo. throwing it back upon higher ground. 

. No canal with locks can be operated without provision for the water 
used in taking boats through the locks, for evaporation, for seepage, 
and for other purposes incident to the maintenance and operation of 
the canal. At each lockage on the Panama Canal a lock full of water, 
representing a volume nearly 750 feet long, 84 feet wide, and 45 feet 
deep, would be used in the Bohio locks and about two-thirds as much 
in the Pedro Miguel locks. This requires a large supply of water, 
which the Isthmian Commission computed for all purposes to be 1,070 
cubic feet per second for an annual traflic of 10,000,000 tons passing 
through the canal. This water supply is afforded b}' the Chagres 
River, and without it or its equivalent the canal would not be possible. 

In view of the complete s^^stem of self-control of the Chagres floods 
by the Gigante Spillway, the Chagres River, instead of being an insur- 
mountable obstacle to the construction and maintenance of the canal, 



THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA. 825 

as has at times been apprehended, is actuall}^ a gracious feature of the 
canal environment, and by that automatic control it has been chang-ed 
from a sinister agent to a friendly power. Furthermore, while the 
average discharge of the Chagres River is nearly three times the 
quantity required for feeding the canal, there are times in the dry 
seasons when the discharge of the river is not more than two-thirds of 
the quantity required for that purpose. This deficiency is abundantly 
made up by the storage in Lake Bohio until the traffic exceeds 
10,000,000 ton« annually' At that time the storage in the Alhajuela 
reserv^oir Avill give an additional supply for an increase of traffic three 
or four times as great as the volume whicli can be accommodated ))v 
the storage in Lake Bohio. 

ABOMINABLE SANITARY CONDITIONS. 

The sanitary conditions of the Isthmus are at the present time 
wretchedly bad. Neither Colon nor Panama has either a system of 
water supply or a sewer systeuL The water used in ranania for 
potable purposes is brought into the city in casks mounted on wheels 
and drawn by mules from some more or less polluted source outside 
of but near the city, or caught in cisterns from the rain water flowing 
from roofs during the wet season, or in some other crude and usually 
insanitary way. 

There are a few drains in the cit}^ of Panama, constructed innue- 
diatelv under the surface of the streets, with little or no regard to 
grades. The water or sewage and decaying matter collecting in the 
low portions of these drains and remaining there under the high tem- 
perature of the climate make them far worse than no drains at all. 
The lack of care and proper disposal of household and other refuse 
creates the most unsanitary conditions imaginable. Those observations 
ma}" be emphasized for the smaller towns and villages between Colon 
and Panama. As a consequence, yellow fever is probably always 
present, and at times assumes epidemic form. Malarial fevers and 
other similar diseases are also continually present under aggravated 
forms. These conditions, however, are completely remedialjle by 
means well known and available at the present time. 

The entire Isthmus can be placed in a completely sanitary condition 
so that its healthfulness shall be assured by resorting to methods and 
means which have now become practically standard in the sanitation 
of cities and towns. It is absolutel}' essential that waterworks, sup- 
plying potable and wholesome water, be established for the cities and 
larger towns, and concurrently therewith there nuist be established 
suitably sewer systems with rational and sanitarx' disposal of sewage. 
All these results are now perfectly practicable of attairmient without 
unreasonable cost or material difl^iculty. It will l)e imperative, how- 
ever, that sanitary regulations be created, enforced, and maintained 



826 THE KEPUBLIC OF PANAMA. 

with the rigor of iiiilitary di.scipline. Under such reasonable sanitar\" 
conditions as it is entirely practicable to attain, and with proper 
quarantine regulations, there is no reason wh}' the Isthmus may not 
be maintained entirely free of yellow fever or from other tropical 
epidemics. 

COST OF THE CANAL. 

The United States Government has entered into a provisional 
agreement to purchase the entire property of evejT description 
and the rights of the new Panama Canal Company for the sum of 
$40,000,000. The cost of completing the Panama Canal under the 
plan of the Isthmian Canal Commission is estimated 1)y that Commis- 
sion at $144,233,358. The sum of these two amounts— 1184,233, 358— 
represents the total cost of the construction of the Isthmian ship canal 
by this route, to which should be added such additional costs as are 
required to be incurred in securing the additional rights and con- 
cessions necessary to ena])le the United States Government to enter 
upon the Isthmus and l)egin the work. 

The consunmiation of this great work is apparently close at hand. 
The creation of the Republic of Panama has solved the difficulties 
which had gathei'ed about the negotiations of the requisite treaty, and 
it will probably be but a short time before this, the greatest engineer- 
ing work of the world, will be undertaken and carried to completion. 
This achievement w^ll not only create new lines of ocean commerce 
and stimulate some of the older lines into new life, but it will also 
bring the Atlantic and Pacific shores of the United States into much 
closer conununication than before, thus strengthening those )>onds of 
mutual interest and natural sympathy which lie at the foundation of 
best national life. In this part of the world's development the new 
Republic of Panama becomes the center of the material activities 
through wdiich these great results will be accomplished, thus attaining 
the fruition of four hundred j^ears of effort. She is to be congratulated 
in marking her entrance among the nations of the eartli by opening 
the way to the attainment of this world improvement and giving the 
work the impetus of her national sanction.

CongTess, in the spring* of 19t»2, following the recommendations 
made by President Roosevelt in his first message, took up the matter 
of the reclamation of the arid West and on the 17th of June, a day 
celebrated in American history, the President signed the bill known 
as the reclamation law, setting aside the proceeds from the dis])osal 
of public lands in thirteen Western States and three Territories for

attracted little attention other than from those who were interested in 
the measure. It was thought to l)e simi)ly a western scheme which

leaders of l)oth parties. As time has _o-one on the people of the coun- 
try have beo'un to appreciate more and more the importance of the 
law not only to the West but to the country as a whole. It is now 
appreciated that if that law is well administered it will mean much to 
the future dcvelo])ment of our country, and a complete change in some 
physical and economic features. 

As geouraphers we are interested in the development of the country 
and in the changes that take place, and as citizens of the United States 
we are concerned in seeing that every resource is put to its best use, 
and that the country is developed to the fullest possil)le extent. The 
ol)ject of the reclamation law is primarily to put the public domain 
into the hands of small land owners— men who live upon the land, 
support themselves, make prosperous homes, and become purchasers 
of the o'oods manufactured in the East and the cotton raised in the

'South. At the same time this is to l)e done in such a May (hat it will 
not become a l)urden to the taxpayers. 

The money for the reclamation fund is from the disposal of public 
lands in the West. This money is returned again to the fund l)y 
repayment by the persons who are directly benetited. This matter of 
refunding is one of the most essential features of the law. Many con- 
sidered this provision as trivial. 1)ut the more the effect of the law is 
studied the more thoroughlv is it demonstrated that this repayment is 
one of the Ijest safeguards of the law, keeping the administration 
clean and business like. The requirement that each project must be 
worth what it costs is a safeguard both in public and in private 
luidertakinps. 



THE KECLAMATIOX OF THE WEST.

Attacks upon llic l:iw have been made under the niisconcei^tion that 
the eastern farmer is taxed to make western farms valuable, and that 
the Government will be victimized by the lands passing into the hands 
of great corporations. These attacks would not be made if the men 
who utter them would read the law. It is carefully guarded in eyery 
respect, putting the lands into the hands of small owners and refund- 
ing to the treasury the cost of reclaiming the land. 

This matter of irrigation and of western reclamation is by no means 
new. It has been discussed most thoroughly and persistently ))y one 
of our prominent members now gone before, John Wesley Powell. 
"The ]\rajor,'' as we all called him, in his early years made extensive 
expk)rations in the West, studying its topograph}', geograph}', geol- 
ogv. and ethnok:)o-v. In the course of those researches he became

greatl}' impressed with the great opportunitiesfor development of this 
western arid land. He talked this matter in season and out of season, 
and man}' of his friends have said, "Now, Major, if you will only 
stop this irrigation talk we will do anything you want, but we can 
not have that.'' "\\'e are glad that he lived to see this law passed, and 
though it was not exactly on the lines he sketched in his original 
thesis, yet it follows his ideals. His report, written in 1876, is still 
one of the classics to which all refer. " 



BROAD I'KOA'ISIONS OF KECLA^IATIOX LAAV. 

The reclamation law is short and (juickiy read; its terms are general 
and it commits to executive discretion nearly all of the details which

make a law a success or a failure. It sets up a few large aud impor- 
tant safeguards, and says in effect to the Secretary of the Interior, 
"Here is this money; take it and spend it for this purpose; get it back 
in the Treasury and do the best you can with it.'' That is unquestion- 
ably the ideal condition, and the men who are working under it must 
make it a success. They have no excuse for a failure. Congress has 
been liberal, has given the Secretary wide discretion, and we have no 
apparent excuse for not obtaining the l^est results which the conditions 
will permit. 

1 have spoken of two or three of the large safeguards imposed, 
namely, the putting of the land into the hands of small owners who 
will live on it and ciUtivate it, and the refunding of the money to the 
Treasury, the money to be used over and over again in a I'evolving 
fund. When the law was passed the matter did not seem very impor- 
tant. Th(> amount of money involved did not seem large and the 
opponents of the bill liad little appreciation of the situation. It cov- 
ered into the Treasury funds for the year 1901 and succeeding years, 
as follows: For 1901, $3,o»»0,000; for 1902, $1,000,000 more, and for 
l9o;> about $8,000,000; in all, now about |15,00o,0OO. The fund at the 
present time is increasing rapidl}'. 

THE RECLAMATION SERVICE. 

The Secretary of the Interior, to whom the whole matter is com- 
mitted, in commencing the work, decided to put it in the hands of a 
man and an organization in whom he had and has confidence. Hon. 
Charles D. Walcott, Director of the United States Geological Survey, 
is the man whom the Secretary holds responsible for this work. He 
in turn is assisted by several men who since 1888 have been measuring 
the streams of the West, studying the water supply, and making an 
examination to ascertain how the lands can be reclaimed by irrigation. 

The Geological Survey has for years been making a topographic 
map of the United States, and on that map are shown the streams, the 
reservoir sites in or near the mountains, and many other facts which 
are essential to a practical knowledge of the su))ject. 
~ In addition to the topographic branch, the hydrographic division 
has been measuring the waters which may be used or stored in these 
reservoirs. It was practicable at the beginning of the work to take 
experienced men out of the corps existing in the Geological Survey 
and to add to these from time to time, through civil-service examina- 
tions, men who are experienced in the actual construction and opera- 
tion of irrigation systems. Now, there is an engineer corps of a])out 
200 men, mostly young and active. A few have obtained age and 
maturity of judgment and will hold these younger men in check. The 
men are grouped in districts. At the head of each district is a man of 
experience who has been State engineer, as in the case of Idaho, or 



THE RECLAMATION OF THE WEST. 831 

has had large practice in irrigation work. To him are assigned men 
who have had more or less technical training. The plans made by 
these engineers are submitted to a board of consulting engineers, 
comprising men of wide experience and national repute. 

The work extends over thirteen States and three Territories. These 
sixteen political divisions comprise the largest of the United States 
excepting Texas. Texas came into the Union as an independent 
repu})lic, owning its vacant lands, and hence the land laws of the rest 
of the States are not applicable, nor is the law of June IT, 1902. All 
of the large western States are included. Thus the development of 
nearly half of the United States is resting upon the best execution 
of this law. 

The problems are not merely those of engineering and constructing 
great works. It is not sufficient to build canals and bring the water 
where the people can get it; but, more than this, there are an inlinitude 
of problems to be solved, and great tact must be used with people. 
AVhen it comes to the question of dealing with water, men may be good 
citizens, ])ut the}" can not be implicitly trusted when it comes to the 
question of water distribution. In Idaho they have the term ''winter 
friendship.'' During the sunnner every man is at war with his neigh- 
bor over the division of water, but in the winter these troubles are 
forgotten and everyone is on friendly terms. Summer is the time of 
storm and strife in water afi'airs. So, in ever^^thing having to do with 
Avater and its distribution, engineers must have not only knowledge 
l)ut good sense, tact, and tirnmess. To deal with the interests which 
are concerned in the distribution of water and the reclamation of land, 
it is necessar}" to organize the people into associations. Tliese asso- 
ciations under the law must ultimatel}' control and operate the works; 
through them the Secretaiy of the Interior can deal directly with a 
l)ody of people, and they can divide the water among themselves 
and settle minor matters as l)est thev can. The reclamation of the 
West is not only a scientific prol)leni. l)ut. for idtimate success, invohes 
great tact and skill in administration. 

thp: public laxds. 

The public lands are of many kinds, from densely forested areas 
extending far up on the slopes of the high mountains of the Rockies 
down to the vast low plains and wide spreading, trackless deserts. 
Particuhir interest is attached to these high mountains and the forested 
slopes, for upon these depend to a large extent the future i)rosperity 
and the utilization of the agricultural lands of the West. 

The extent of the forests is shown by diagram 5. In northern Cali- 
fornia and along the Pacific coast in western Oregon and Washington 
are the greatest for<'sts remaining in the United States. Around the

Yellowstone National Park and in the Kocky Mountain reo-ion in <^'en- 
eral are other important forests. In considering- any question con- 
cerning' the forests we must bear in mind that the word forest com- 
prises a great variety of tree growth. In the East it usually means a 
dense growth. Out in Colorado or Wyoming you can sometimes see 
a half mile throug-h what is called a forest. Thus, when we discuss 
forests on the public lands there must be some explanation of what 
kind of a forest we are talkiiig al)()ut. if we are to be correctly under-

vain, to secure permanent settlement, and thousands of industrious and 
hard-working settlers have been forced to leave by starvation. This 
is due to the fact that the rains are erratic in character, and, on an 
average, are just sufficient to produce good crops. In one year, or 
series of years, large crops may be raised, and the report is widely 
spread that here is the "promised land;'' no sooner has settlement 
been established than the rains decrease slightly, or come at the wrong 
season, crops are lost, and the settlers are forced to migrate. 

This is also called the countr}' of the ""rain belters," the phrase 
originating from a popular belief that bj" the building of railroads, the 
stringing of telegraph wires, the breaking up of the sod, and by otlier 
human agencies the belt of permanent rainfall is extended westward. 
This popular delusion has ensnared many emigrants, and even now it 
is repeated )\v those whose hopes lead them to the belief that the rain- 
fall is actually becoming more stable. 

AHEA WHICH CAN BE RECLAIMED. 

The area of land which can be reclaimed by ii-rigation is relatively 
small. If 2 or 3 per cent of the vast extent of arid lands of the United 
States are ultimately reclaimed and put under cultivation it will 
mean a population in the western half of the United States almost as 
great as that now in the eastern half of the countr3\ Figure 6 shows 
the areas where it is proljable that irrigation can be carried on, or 
wdiere it is now being carried on, and where it can further be extended. 
If the West is developed to the extent that all these patches indicate 
we will have a wonderful change in the social and connuercial relations 
of the United States as a whole. 

The comparatively regular distribution of these irrigable lands in 
each State is notable. The entire extent of irrigation development 
in each State is, of course, very small, but, if I am correctly informed, 
the proceeds from the small irrigated area in Colorado are alread}" 
greater than from the mines. 

The vacant lands of the arid West may be considered under three 
distinct categories: (1) The irrigable land, which alwavs will be rela- 
tively insignificant as regards area, but of first importance as to 
A'alues; (2) forested areas, where the land has relatively little value 
for agriculture, l)ut is of great importance in producing perpetual 
crops of wood or timber, and in protecting the water supply — this area 
comprises probably from 1(» to 20 per cent of the arid West; (3) the 
great bod}^ of arid land which would be productive with water, but for 
Avhich an adequate supply can never be had — this includes 80 per cent 
of the entire West, and is commonly spoken of as "desert," although 
nearh' every acre has some value for stock-raising purposes at one 
time or another. 



THE RECLAMATION OF THE WEST. 835 

The ii'rit>able land is being- utilized thi'ouo-h individual or corporate 
enterprise, and through the reclamation law. The forested areas are 
being* protected by the activities of the Bureau of Forestry, but there 
remain the great tracts of grazing lands whose proper handling and 
control is still a matter of doubt. 

A thorough knowledge of the location, extent, and capabilities of 
this vast grazing- area uuist be had, and on the basis of this knowledge 
wise statesmanship must be shown in either holding- this land perpet- 
ually, under suitable regulations, as an open conuuons for grazing- or 
of disposing of it to individuals in such a way as to form permanent 
settlements and to create the largest numl)er of homes. The grazing 
IDroblem is the third and last of the great puldic land questions, the 
one which is still unsolved, and which, when satisfactorily settled, 
will lead to increased prosperity for the entire countr3\ 

THE RECLAMATION FUND. 

The reclamation fund comes from the disposal of lands in 13 States 
and 3 Territories, and the amount is widely different in the different 
States. The law jjrovides that so far as practicaljle the amount shall 
be spent in the State where it originates, but in fact the available 
funds are almost always inversely apportioned to the needs of any 
one State. 

From Nevada, the Stat* having the largest opportunity for develop- 
ment, the amount of money is rei)resented by a small amount, while 
from North Dakota there has come an enormous fund. In the latter 
State there is little possibility of general development l)y irrigation 
because of the dithculty of linding irrigable lands and an adequate 
water supply. North Dakota and Oregon and Oklahoma have large 
funds. In Oklahoma, with its subhumid climate, there is little need 
of irrigation, and in fact it is almost impossible to find any reclamation 
project of considerable luagnitude in that Territory. 

PRESENT RECLAMATION WORK. 

Examinations leading- to construction are being- carried on widely. 
At the points where dams may be erected for water storage the 
foundations must be studied, and for this purpose diamond drills are 
used to ascertain the character of the l)ed rock. ^Vork of construction 
has been begun in two localities — one in Nevada and the other in 
Arizona. In Nevada the work in hand is that on a canal to take water 
from Truckee River into lower Carson i-eservoir site. Lake Tahoe, 
at the head of the Tr-ackee lliver, is the highest large lake in the 
United States and in many r(>spv:'cts is an ideal reservoir site, and its 
waters, if wisely used, will go far to promote the prosperity of Nevada. 



83G 



THE KECLAMATIOX OF THE WEST. 



In California, over the State line from Nevada, are opportunities for 
water storage. In the mountains are little valleys in which water can 
be held. It is impossible for Nevada, as a State, to utilize these reser- 
voir sites, as it can not go across the State line. The National Gov- 
ernment is alone capable of doing this work. 

A dam put across Carson River near its lower end will flood back 
the water and make an immense reservoir capable of supplying sev-

eral hundred thousand acres of land which is now- absolutely desert 
and almost impossible to cross. 

The interstate character of these problems of reclamation is exceed- 
ingly complicated. The Kio Grande, rising in Colorado and flowing 
through New Mexico, forms the boundary between Texas and Mexico: 
the Arkansas rises in Colorado and flows through Kansas. Oklahoma.

intervention in reclamation, as well as tlie fact of Federal ownership 
of the vacant lands. 

In Colorado the largest project now in construction is that of tak- 
uig the Ciunnison River into the Uncompahgre Valley. This river 
flows in a narrow canyon 2,000 feet deep. Tiiis can\"on has been 
regarded as impassable, but Mr. A. L. Fellows, one of the engineers 
of the reclamation service, and an assistant went througli in IUO'2 at 
the risk of their lives. The attempt liad been made a number of 
times to tio down it bv boats. l)ut without success. These men did it

l)y means of swinmiiiiy- and ])y usinu- a pneniiiatic mattress or rubber 
bed as a raft. They put in small rubber ])ags the necessary food and 
a little underwear. In ten daj's, by floating, swimming, and climb- 
ing, they succeeded in getting through and locating the point at which 
may be placed the headworks to take the water out l\y a tunnel into 
Uncompahgro Valley . 

The tunnel, heading in the steep clifi's, passes under the mountain 
to the valley beyond, a distance of nearly 5 miles. Careful surveys 
and examinations are being made, and it is believed to be feasi))le to 
Imild the tunnel, if enough irrigable land can be found to justify the 
undertaking. 

Another project which has l)een under examination is that in south- 
ern Wyoming on the North Platte River, at what is known as the 
Devils Gate, on Sweetwater River, a short distance above the point 
where it 'enters North Platte River. Unfortunately the amount of 
water available at this point is small, and after careful examination 
there is now ])eing considered another reservoir site known as the 
Pathlindor, at a lower point, where there is ample water for storage 
purposes. This is on North Platte River itself, below the mouth of 
Sweetwater River. 

The water stored in the Pathlinder reservoir in AVyoming will be 
turned doA\'n North Platte River to a point near Guernsey, where it 
can be diverted and taken out upon land in Avhat is known as the 
Goshen Hole, in eastern W^'oming, adjacent to Nebraska. It is prol)- 
able that the canals can ))e extended to cover ])road areas in western 
NeT)raska on both sides of the river. 

In northern W} oming there is another reclamation project, that on 
Shoshone River, which here flows through a granite range. Surve3"s 
are being made to demonstrate the practicability of diverting this 
river and carrying it out to the broad plains of the Big Horn basin 
east of the town of Cody. 

One of the greatest works in the United States is the utilization of 
the great Colorado River of the West. The headwaters come from 
W3'oiuing and Colorado, flow through Utah and northern Arizona, 
and the river Anally enters the Gulf of California. Along this stream 
are lands capal)le of high cultivation, as the soil is rich and the climate 
semitropical. 

The rank growth on the bottom lands shows that wherever water 
is found the vegetation is extremely dense. It is, in fact, almost 
impossible to pu.sh one's way through this vegetation. The illustration 
shows some of the broad l)ottoms that can' be reclaimed. 

The river itself is constanth' changing, shifting over a very broad 
extent of channel. Last Christmas a party of us took a trip down the 
river in a boat. We floated, paddled, and at times waded for 400 
miles down that stream, under the most delightful climate in the

United States. It Ava.s a rare experience. AVe Avould ))e sailing under 
a good breeze at an exliilarating rate, and everybody would be gay, 
when suddenh^ we would slide up on a mud bank; then all would go 
overboard to tug and finally push off into deeper water, and then on 
until we brought up in another nuid bank. 

Plate IV shows where it will be possible to build dams similar to 
those built by the British engineers on the Nile. The river, although 
a quarter or a half a mile wide above, here 1)ecomes narrow, hardly- 
wide enough for a steamer to pass, and at this point it would be possi- 
ble to erect dams holding back the water. The great difficulty is the 
fact that the mud carried ])y the river would till the reservoirs verv 
rapidl3\ 

Another project under consideration is in Arizona, on Salt Kiver. 
This dam, if constructed, will be one of the greatest in the world, 
being 230 feet from foundation to top. The lands to be reclaimed 
along the Salt Hiver are in the vicinity of Phoenix and are capable of 
a high degree of cultivation, producing crop after crop throughout 
the year. There are sometimes as many as seven crops a year raised. 

In southern Idaho are vast tracts of desert land, to which water 
may be brought from Snake River. At the head of this river is 
Jackson Lake, situated at the foot of the (rrand Tetons. By closing 
the outlet of this lake all the water can be held, storing a sufficient 
supply for tens of thousands of acres along Snake River, in Idaho. 

Under present conditions the water supply in Snake River dwindles 
to such an extent that during the summer the channel is dry at points 
along its course. This river, which appears to be inexhaustible, is, 
as a matter of fact, nearh^ dry at points in eastern Idaho for several 
months when the water is most needed. 

In a portion of the course of Snake River in southern Idaho it has 
1)een found practicable to divert the water upon vast tracts of fertile, 
level land. Here, near the railroad station of Minidoka, it is pro- 
posed to build across Snake River a substantial masoniw dam and take 
out water on both sides with gravity canals, irrigating the sagebrush- 
covered plains. A large amount of water can be allowed to pass 
through or over the dam, and it is proposed to generate power, util- 
izing this to pump water to some of the higher lying tracts which can 
not be reached by gravit}-. 

A great project under consideration is that of taking water out of 
some of the tributaries of the Columbia. Millions of acres suscep- 
tible of irrigation are below the level of the headwaters of Columbia 
River, but in order to convey these waters to the dry lands it is neces- 
sary to traverse mile after mile of steep side slopes. The cost of the 
project runs up into the millions of dollars; so that Avhile the Govern- 
ment may execute it in the future, the })roject of reclaiming the great

arid lands of the State of Washington is one which is ahnost impos- 
sible for the present time. 

In the region of the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming- 
are numerous small projects. Many streams flow outwardly from the 
liills through narrow canyons. By closing these gaps it is possible to 
hold water in various places around the Black Hills. Beyond are vast 
stretches of rolling country susceptil)le of reclamation. In the north- 
ern part of the region is one of the largest and best bodies of public 
lands to which it is practicable to take water. Here on Belle Fourche 
River are man}' thousand acres of public land which may be irrigated. 

In New Mexico the problems of reclamation are quite difficult, owing 
to the character of water supplv and the large extent of the old 
Spanish land grants, taking in much of the best land of the Territory. 
The principal stream is the Rio Grande, a perennial river in the north- 
ern part of the Territory, but in the southern part a dr}', sandy channel 
throughout much of the 3"ear. Its waters must be stored, and to do 
this pro))lems of silt must be successfully solved. In the eastern part 
of the Territory is Pecos River, a stream flowing through a vast extent 
of country underlaid in part b}^ soluble gj^psum, and here the con- 
struction of storage reservoirs is rendered difficult bv the waters per- 
colating through the gypsum and finding channels of escape through 
underground passages. 

In Utah the central State of the arid region where irrigation devel- 
opment has proceeded vevy rapidh', the problems are extensive and 
far-reaching. The well-distributed streams coming from the moun- 
tains have enabled the Mormon farmers to build up extensive commu- 
nities, but the small irrigating systems are not always economical of 
water, and there remains to put in practice a large, comprehensive 
system which, through better water conservation and distribution, will 
enable an extension of the irrigable area. Utah Lake seems to offer the 
greatest opportunity, for here, in this broad, shallow depression, four 
or live times as much water is lost hy evaporation as is utilized in culti- 
vating the soil. By reducing the area of this lake the extent of culti- 
vated lands may be accordingh' increased. Bear Lake, also on the 
northern boundary of the State, affords similar opportunities for 
conserving water. 

In the far northern part of the arid region, in Montana, in the broad 
valley of Milk River, are opportunities of storing the short, intermit- 
tent floods of that stream. It is proposed toreenforce these, if practi- 
cable, b}' water held in the glacial lakes at the foot of the Rocky 
Mountains and put to use the streams which now flow northerly into 
Canada. 

In Oregon, the Umatilla River, which flows into Columbia River, 
may be utilized by the construction of a large canal, catching its floods

and taking- them out into suitable basins where they can be held until 
they are needed on the broad extent of arid land south of Colorado 
River. In the eastern part of the State, on the Malheur River, are 
other localities where the floods may be stored and where thousands of 
acres of arid land can be converted into small farms sufficient to sup- 
port a family in comfort. 

The theory of reclamation is to conserve the flood waters that other- 
wise go to waste and hold them until such time as they are needed. 
There remains in the various States a vast extent of arid lands to 
which the flood waters can be carried and which, when watered, is 
capable of producing large crops and furnishing homes for prosperous 
farmers.

ROBERT HENRY THURSTON. 



Bv Prof. W. F. DuRAND. 



The splendid legacy of material civilization which the nineteenth 
century has bequeathed to the twentieth is due in principal measure to 
the achievements of the engineer and the scientist, and among- those 
whose names and influence are written large on the practice and the 
achievements of the latter part of the last century, the name of Prof. 
Robert Henry Thurston will hold an assured and a1)iding place. Suc- 
cess as a scientist or engineer is a complex result of many factors, 
natural capacitv, industry, devotion to high ideals, persistence, faith, 
with some measure of opportunity". These and others might be speci- 
tied, and all of them in high degree were joined in the character and 
personality of Professor Thurston. 

Robert Henry Thurston was born in Providence, R. I., October 25, 
1839; son of Robert L. Thurston, one of the pioneer steam engineers 
of the country. He spent much time in his father's engine works, 
Thurston. Green & Co. and Thvirston, Gardner & Co., where he 1)ecame 
acquainted with the engineering practice of the day, especialh' in rela- 
tion to the design and construction of steam boilers and engines, and 
in general power-plant practice. 

At the age of 16 he entered Brown University, where he graduated 
in 1859 with the degrees of Ph. B. and C. E., and later received from 
the same institution the degrees of A. M. and LL. D., and from 
Stevens Institute the degree of doctor of engineering. 

He first entered business with his father's firm at Providence and 
was later their representative in Philadelphia, where he was located 
at the outbreak of the civil war in ist;!. At this time, when the ques- 
tion of duty to country was pressing in upon the hearts and thoughts 
of all serious men, he decided early in the summer to oft'er himself 
for service in the Engineer Corps of the Navy, believing that in this 
branch of the national service he would find the best scope for his 
natural genius and personal tastes, and would furthermore thus be 
able to render service in Avhich his previous experience might be of 
some ready value. In reply to his letter to the Secretary of the Navy 
he was ordered to report for examination to the naval examining

board, then in session at Philadelphia. This he did on Jnly 9, 1861, 
and was in due course examined on fJuly 2.5 and found well qualified 
for the naval service. His first connnission as third assistant eng-iueer, 
U. S. Navy, was made out under date of July 3(», 1S61, but it was not 
until about a month later, or on August 25, that he was called into 
active service and ordered to the V. S. S. UnddlUa^ fitting out at the 
Brooklyn Navy-Yard for service on the southern blockade. The ship 
was put into commission September 3() and sailed October IS for Port 
Royal, S. C, where she was attached to the squadron under Rear- 
Admiral Dupont. After active service in these waters for about a 
year the VnadUla was ordered North to New York for repairs, return- 
ing again to her station in October, 1S62. During the following- 
winter the Princess Royal., a valuable merchant steamer, was taken as 
a prize, and due to the skill and valuable help rendered in connection 
with securing this prize. Assistant Engineer Thurston was ordered 
home in lier, in charge of the engineers department. The prize was 
taken North to Philadelphia, and after turning over his department 
at the navy -yard. Assistant Engineer Thurston was detached and 
ordered on February 11, 1863, to examination for promotion to the 
rank of second assistant engineer. This examination was passed suc- 
cessfully, and he was then placed on waiting orders, where he remained 
till the following June, when he was ordered to the Chijypeiva at Port 
Royal, S. C, in charge of the engineer's department. He remained 
on duty in this capacity for about a year, when the ship returned 
North to Philadelphia, and he was detached and placed on waiting 
orders. On July 11, 1864, he was ordered to the Maumee, which was 
fitting at the Brooklyn Navy-Y"ard, but a few weeks later was detached 
and ordered to the Pontoosuc for more immediate service, this vessel 
having been assigned to duty as consort to a Pacific mail steamer en 
route to Aspinwail and return. On October, 18, 1864, he was detached 
from the Pontoosuc and ordered to the Dictator, then fitting out and 
making preliminary trials in New Y'ork Harbor. This ship, contain- 
ing machinery of Ericsson's design, had experienced great difficulty 
in meeting- on trial the conditions specified in the contract, and it was 
feared that without extended change in the de-sign and installation of 
the machinery she would be unable to satisfactorily meet the contract 
requirements. Assistant Engineer Thurston threw himself into this 
problem with his accustomed insight and zeal, and with minor changes 
and under his charge, the requirements were fulfilled to a point which 
formed the Ijasis of a settlement satisfactory to the Government on 
the one hand and the designer on the other. 

On June 6, 1865, he was ordered to examination for promotion to 
the grade of first assistant engineer, and received his commission as 
such the following month. Shortly after, the war being over, he was 
detached from the Dictator and placed on waiting orders, and in the 



EGBERT HENRY THURSTOIST. 845 

following December was ordered to the Naval Academy as assistant 
professor in the department of natural and experimental philosopliy. 
He remained on this dut}- for the next tive years, activel}' occupied in 
his duties at the Acadeni}^ and in developing his invention of a type of 
magnesium lamp intended for use in a proposed S3"stem of military 
and naval signals. 

In ISTO he was invited by President Morton, of Stevens Institute, to 
take part, as professor of mechanical engineering, in the organization 
of that newl}" founded educational enterprise. It was here that Pro- 
fessor Thurston, on 1>road and practically independent lines, first 
entered on his career as an engineering educator, and in which he 
won so large and enduring a place in the modern development of tech- 
nical education. There were then existing no technical schools to 
serve as guides or precedents, especially in higher engineering work, 
and these early developments were largely pioneer in character. In 
all of the earh' work of organization and development Professor 
Thurston took a leading part as head of the department of mechanical 
engineering. He earh^ organized a laboratory of mechanical engi- 
neering, the first of its type in the country, and thus sounded a new 
keynote in higher technical education. Now every technical school 
of approved standing has its engineering laborator3% and work of this 
character is yearl}" assuming an increasing importance in all lines of 
technical education. His earh^ plans for such a laborator}' were first 
published in 1871 and later amplified in 1875. In Europe work of 
this character had been inaugurated in a few institutions in 1870 and 
1871, or only slightly earlier than the initial organization by Pro- 
fessor Thurston. He has said that the need of such a laboratory and 
of opportunities for such instruction had been strongly impressed on 
his mind when a boy in his father's workship, and during his entire 
career as an educator he gave much prominence to such work and much 
time and effort to the constant improvement and extension of the 
equipments of the laboratories over which he exercised supervision. 

In addition to his Avork in Stevens Institute, Professor Thurston 
found time during these yesLvs to serve on several important commis- 
sions and juries. He was a member of a United States commission 
on boiler tests; was- member of an international jur}' and United 
States Commissioner at the Vienna Exhibition in 1873, and edited the 
report of the commission on that exhibition, comprising four large 
volumes, and writing one of them, on manufactures, as his own con- 
tribution. He Avas also an active member of the American Society of 
Civil Engineers, and in the proceedings of that society reported fre- 
quently the results of his investigations on the strength of materials. 
In 1875 he was appointed member of the United States ))oard for the 
testing of iron, steel, and other metals, and took for many years a 
leading part in the work of that board. 



846 ROBEET HENRY THURSTON. 

The tremendous drain of enero-y required for the work accomplished 
between 1871 and 1876 was more than his physical streng-th could 
safely be called on to furnish, and for the next three or four years he 
was in poor health, and on duty only a part of the time. In 1880, 
however, his health was again restored, and from that time for the next 
twenty-three 3'ears he enjoyed, in the main, excellent health, and lost 
no time due to serious illness. 

In 1885 he was invited by the trustees of Cornell Uniyersity to 
undertake the work of organizing and developing a college of mechan- 
ical engineering on the foundation provided by Sibley College, which 
had been founded at about the same time as Stevens, but had devel- 
oped on less distinctively engineering lines. Professor Thurston 
brought to this w^ork all his native enthusiasm and force of character, 
with the experience he had acquired during the preceding fifteen 
years in similar work at Stevens Institute. The results of the organi- 
zation which he brought about, and of the new life which was thus 
instilled into the work of the college, were speedily seen in a gen- 
eral elevation of the quality of instruction -and of the student 
body at large, and in a rapidl}'' increasing number in attendance. On 
taking charge, in 1885, the total attendance in all classes was about 00, 
with a total teaching, force of 7, while at his death, in 1903, these 
figures were, respective!}^, 960 and 43. Professor Thurston saw clearly 
the possibilities of a great engineering school at Cornell University 
and labored unceasingly for its development and perfection along these 
lines. ^1 his ideal he included a system of schools of engineering and 
of the mechanic arts, offering in the fundamental departments expert 
instruction in tlie foundations of all principal dei)artments of industry, 
and laying a broad foundation for successful work in all lines of 
industrial activity; joined with these a system of schools of the indus- 
tries in which the use of the essential apparatus and equipment of these 
industries should be exhibited by expert teachers and discussed with 
reference to their fundamental principles and their relation to broader 
and more fundamental principles; again, a s3'stem of schools of the 
constructive professions of engineering, and then, correlated with all, 
a department of experimental research, in which the many problems 
which arise in these various lines of engineering and industrial activity 
might receive careful stud}- at the hands of expert investigatoi's, and 
wherein the student might gain that vital contact with the actual 
materials of engineering construction, and with the various mechan- 
isms which he is to construct or employ, which alone can give him 
theactual knowledge that the .successful prosecution of his professional 
work will demand. 

Naturally, not all of this ideal has been attained. Lack of funds has 
prevented more than the blocking out of a part of the work, and that 
on broad lines, and in developing some few of the special lines w-hich 



ROBERT HENRY THURSTON. 847 

seemed most timel\^ Sibley College as now organized, and as thus 
expressing- the purposes of Professor Thurston so far as he was able 
to realize them, comprises a general line of undergraduate work cov- 
ering the foundations and the broad middle ground of mechani- 
cal engineering work, together with three departments in which is 
given the essential characteristic instruction related to three special 
fields of engineering practice — namely, electrical engineering, marine 
engineering and naval architecture, and railway mechanical engineer- 
ing. Many other special branches had long been in the programme, 
but the necessary limitations of space and funds have so far pre- 
vented the extension of the development beyond the extent specified. 

Throughout the eighteen years of his work in Cornell his own 
teaching was in the subject of thermod}' namics and steam engineering 
and in the economics of power generation and of manufacturing estab- 
lishments. In the first subject a required course was given for two- 
thirds of the 3'ear, while in the latter two elective courses were given 
during the remaining one-third. 

His policy regarding organization was distinctively generous in 
relation to the various heads of department. He believed in giving 
to each liead of department a large measure of independent initiative 
and in holding him responsible for results. Rarely did his supervision 
extend to an}' control over details of internal department administra- 
tion, and thus each head was left to work out his own problems 
in accordance with his special environment and to administer his 
department in detail as he might judge best. 

In addition to his regular work in the university. Professor Thurs- 
ton found time while at Cornell to serve on several important boar4s, 
among them the New York State commissions on voting machines and 
on the selection of a firearm for the National Guard, and the United 
States connnissions on postal-pneumatic service and on safe and vault 
construction. 

He also made during these years his most important contributions 
to the literature of engineering, and in particular wrote his exhaustive 
works on the steam engine and steam boiler. 

In addition to his books. Professor Thurston prepared and pul)lished 
a vast number of papers on a wide range of engineering subjects. His 
papers on the materials of engineering and on thermodynamics and 
steam engineering are especially numerous and important, and nuich 
of his best thought and efiort has gone into the preparation of these 
monographs and shorter publications. 

A list of his larger works, written both at Stevens Institute and at 
Cornell, shows that his activities maybe grouped under three difi'erent 
heads. The first one of these is made up of works on the materials of 
engineering, the second of works on the steam engine and the steam

boiler, and in the third we find publications more purely philosophical, 
historical, and biographical." 

In the field of invention Professor Thurston has made several con- 
tributions to engineering art, the more important being lamps burn- 
ing magnesium, navy signal apparatus, autographic testing- machines 
for iron, steel, and other metals, testing machines for lubricants, and 
improvements in steam engines and in scientific engineering" apparatus. 
He also did much work in scientific research and in the investigation 
of important engineering- problems, among which may be mentioned: 

The determination of the useful qualities of the alloys of copper and 
tin, copper and zinc, and copper, tin, and zinc. 

Sfudies of boiler explosions. 

Researches regarding the laws of friction and lubrication. 

Laws of variation of engine wastes and studies in the econoni}' of 
the steam engine. 

Professor Thurston was a member of the leading engineering and 
scientific societies of this country and of Europe. He was the first 
president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and suc- 
ceeded himself for the following- term as well. He was three times 
vice-president of the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science, vice-president of the American Institute of Mining- Engineers, 
and Officier de ITnstruction Publique de France. 

Professor Thurston possessed to a remarkable degree the capacity 
for rapid and intensive work. This was due in no small measure to

hi.s powers of concentration and to an excellent memory tilled as a 
storehouse, either with facts or with the location of facts and where 
successful search for them might be made. These powers joined to a 
sympathetic nature led him to cover an unusually broad field of activ- 
ity with his professional writings, and to show an aggregate result of 
astonishing magnitude. It is. not in his books and papers, however, 
that his chief monument is to be found, but rather in his direct educa- 
tional work, and particularly in the organization and development of 
Sibley College, and in the men who have gone forth into the various 
fields of active engineering practice so largely indebted to him either 
for -direct personal instruction or inspiration, or for the oppoitunities 
which came as the result of the organization and administration of the 
college under his direction. 

Personal!}" Professor Thurston was s^nnpathetic, warm hearted, and 
optimistic, and an inspiring friend and leader. He was never dis- 
couraged by an appearance of failure and believed steadfastly that the 
great purposes which he was directing and which he was endeavoring 
to shape to his ideals would all one day work out to the best and 
highest uses of mankind. As a rule he was rapid in his judgments on 
matters of a scientific or engineering character, but when the human 
element was involved, and on matters of l)road policy, he was more 
slow in forming a final judgment, but. once formed, was tireless in 
carrying it forward to realization. 

Professor Thurston died suddenly on the evening of October 25, 
1903, on his O-tth birthday, in the midst of his great work in Sible}^ 
College, in the full possession of his normal strength and mental 
activities, and with apparently man}" years yet of fruitful labor before 
him. 

While it may be too soon to estimate with exactness his place in the 
galaxy of the great minds which the nineteenth centur}' produced, yet 
among those whose work adorned the latter part of this century the 
name of Robert Henry Thurston will have an assured and abiding place. 
As an engineer, a scientist, an educator, a writer, an investigator, an 
expert and counsellor, as a pu1)lic servant in many capacities, and 
as a man and good citizen; all of these fields of activity have been 
enriched with his lat)ors and with his unswerving spirit of devotion to 
scientific truth. He has left to the new generation a rich legac}' in 
work actually accomplished and the example of a scientific man and 
engineer faithfid and true to the highest principles and standards of 
life. 



THEODORE MOMMSEN.« 



Bv Emil Reich. 



On November 1 (Sunda}^), at 8.45 in the morning, Mommsen died, 
and in him the world of erudition has lost one of its very greatest rep- 
resentatives. It is no exaggeration to say that what Joseph Sealiger 
was to the world of scholars at the end of the sixteenth and in the 
beginning of the seventeenth century Mommsen was to all the students 
of Roman antiquity in our own time. The name "Roman antiquity" 
must be taken in its widest sense. Mommsen made personal and inde- 
pendent researches into every aspect of Roman civilization, history, 
law, and private life. In a series of works, which already in 1887 
counted 949 numbers, representing 6,8^4 folio pages, 1,402 quarto, 
and 19,319 octavo pages, the great scholar investigated all the prob- 
lems of Roman political history, chronology, numismatics, law, reli- 
gion, etc. In fact, of him it may have been said what with less justice 
was said of eJustus Lipsius: ""Felicem hominem, qui per ea qure rep- 
perit qua' disposuit qute scivit, et vixit antequam nasceretur, et ita 
natus est ut nunquam sit moriturus." 

Mommsen's life was as simple, and with few exceptions as unevent- 
ful, as that of most scholars. He was born November 30, 1817, at 
Garding, in the Duchy of Holstein. His father was the vicar of the 
place and had destined him for the study of philology and law. From 
1844 to 1847 Mommsen, aided by a stipend from the Berlin Academy, 
made an extensive archaeological journey through France and Italy. 
In 1848 he received a call as professor of law to Leipzig. However, 
on account of his participation in the revolutionary movement of the 
time, he was dismissed from his post. Two years later, in 1850, he 
became professor of Roman law at Zurich, and in 1854 he taught 
Roman law at the University of Breslau. Finally, in 1858, he was 
appointed professor of ancient history at Berlin. Within a year or 
two before his death he continued to teach ancient history at the tirst 
Universit}' of Priissia, and he must, at the lowest calculation, have

delivered over 10,000 lectures to the students of Berlin. In his mar- 
ried life he was eminently successful, and his very numerous children 
(he had 14, we believe) caused him no particular trouble. Recognized 
as the head of the great historical school of Roman antiquity in Ger- 
many, honored and venerated, not to say worshiped by sovereigns, 
princes, scholars, and men of the world alike, he passed the last thirty 
3^ears of his life in a position of exceptional dignity and influence. 

Even in his conflict with the Iron Chancellor he conducted his trial 
in person and with success. The courts finally acquitted him of the 
political crime imputed to him by Bismarck. He traveled exten- 
sively, and especially in the last twentN'-five years of his life lie devel- 
oped a perfect passion for the hunt of manuscripts. Printed liooks 
seemed to have lost their charm for him. What delighted him was a 
manuscript. He was a very frequent guest at the Bodleian and the 
British Museum, at the Bibliotheque Nationale, and at the great libra- 
ries in Italy. Even manuscripts of the early Middle Ages— thatis, man- 
uscripts reflecting only the last dim rays of the sunset of antiquity — 
excited his interest in a very high degree; and the number of authors 
that he edited with the minutest care was ver}^ considerable. His mind 
was influenced chiefly by the aims and methods of the philologist and 
the attitude and ability of the student of law. Now that we may 
clearly overlook the wdiole career of that extraordinar}^ man, it becomes 
more and more manifest that, although Mommsen is known to the 
general reader only or preeminently as the historian of Rome, as the 
author of a famous historv of Rome, yet, on impartial and closer 
examination of the case, it will be found that Mommsen in reality had 
neither the passion nor the highest capacity of the historian proper. 

His was the genius of anal3'sis rather than of synthesis. He excelled 
in monographs very much more than in works putting together in 
their final expression a vast array of facts. This seems to be in utter 
contrast to the fact that Mommsen has published great treatises both 
on Roman public or constitutional law. on Roman chronology, and on 
Roman criminal law. However, applying to Mommsen the strictest 
measure of criticism, we cannot but see that every one of those great 
treatises is rather a collection of monographs than a work giving a 
direct and full insight into the working principles of Roman institu- 
tions. Mommsen classifies, shelves, labels, and numbers both neatl}^ 
and well; he enlightens but little. 

The danger of a man like Mommsen is the false impression under 
which thousands of scholars, and through them the general public, 
have been about the real problems and the real importance of Roman 
history. The massiveness of Mommsen's information, the mere bulk 
of the works he has published to almost the last day of his life, the 
tone of finality and strict formality pervading every line he ever pub- 
lished, has naturally engendered the idea that he has not onh^ furnished 



THEODORE MOMMSEN. 853 

the vastest amount of material, l)ut also the only method and the only 
guiding- aper^'us in the study of ancient Rome. It is time to say that 
while he has done the former he has not done the latter. He has, 
indeed, through the publication of the Corpus of Latin inscriptions, 
and similar very useful collections of material, very much increased 
our means of studying Roman histor}^ more especially of writing more 
numerous books thereon. It is, however, equallv true that his 
influence, the undoubted authority that he enjoyed both in and out of 
the Fatherland, has in a measure sterilized the study of the histoi-y of 
Rome. Thus in the last twenty odd years exceedingly few independ- 
ent and elaV)orate works on the ensemble of Roman history have 
appeared either in England or on the Continent. The scholars of the 
world seem to be under the ban of Mommsen. To abandon his 
method, to doubt the essential correctness of his Roman constitutional 
law {Roeinisches Staatsrecht) seemed, and still seems, to be not on\j 
impossible but indecent. In England, if we except a few short works, 
more particularlv the brilliant and suggestive study on Roman history 
by Mr. T. ]M. Taylor, no attempt has been made to rewrite the history 
of the great empire-nation, which in so man}- ways is so essentially 
similar to the Britons. In fact, it is part of the irony of things that 
the English have so far devoted great attention and great industrv to 
Greek history rather than to Roman, although the}' are, from the 
nature of their own history and modern constitution, less apt to seize 
and clear up the factors and powers that made Greece; while they are 
eminently adapted for clearing up some of the most difficult problems 
of the history of Rome. Using expressions somewhat untechnical, yet 
precise, we may sa\' that Greek histor}' ought to be written by the 
French, and Roman by the British. In ^modern Great Britain alone 
can we still see institutions, the essential identit}' of which with those 
of the institutions of Rome ought to suggest to Britons in the first 
place, or to such as are intimately acquainted with Great Britain, some 
of that insight into the real nature of ancient Rome without which all 
study of history is blind. 

It is almost impossible for a German scholar living in Germany to 
find any of those modern analogies to events and institutions in Rome 
without which we moderns are absolutely excluded from a real knowl- 
edge of Roman history. Mommsen's Roman History has accordingly 
very much more charm than real insight. Mommsen was a great 
artist; his st3'le, like that of a few other North -German writers, is 
both compact and fluent, clear-cut, plastic, and packed with infor- 
mation. It flows on majestically and resembles one of the Roman 
aqueducts; perhaps in more senses than one. There can be no hesita- 
tion in saying that, as a mere piece of reading, Mommsen's history is 
by far the best book ever written on Roman history. Mommsen — 
who shared all the passions and ideals of the revolutionary period in 



854 THEODORE MOMMSEN. 

Gorman V, and who viewed Roman events in the litifht of the events he 
had lived to see in Germany in the forties and fifties of the last 
century— Mommsen was almost driven to write a Roman history both 
intensely interesting and essentially un-Roman. For the Roman world 
within the times of the Republic or in the times of the Empire was so 
utterly difierent from anything" that had developed or gTown up in 
Germany, that no diligence in research nor any philosophical effort 
of the self-sustained mind could enable a German to write up events 
utterly different in character and drift from those of his own country 
and time. It is well known how bitterly Mommsen has fallen foul of 
Cicero: how in the passages relating to the great orator and statesman 
Mommsen tried to excel in that Schnodderigkeit or caddishness with 
which great men of letters who were also statesmen have always been 
treated by the recluse scholar. I^ord Bacon, Ednumd Burke, Adolphe 
Thiers, and others are naturally hateful to the politisirenden Philolo- 
gen, as Monmisen himself called them. No Frenchman or Englishman 
could have committed such an a))surdity. Boissier in France and 
Professor Tyrrell in Dublin, the latter in his magnificent edition of 
Cicero's letters, the former in his exquisite book, Ciceron et ses Amis, 
have long shown the inaccuracy and falsehood of all that Drumann 
and Mommsen had said about Cicero. 

Both the British and the French scholar had from the history of 
their own countries been well acquainted with historical types not 
luisimilar to that of Cicero. The German had no such type to 
enlighten him. And as in this case, so in cases of far greater impor-" 
tance. Take, for instance, Mommsen's historic judgment on the most 
important institution of Rome — on the tribunate. 

It is well known that the tril)unate is at once the strangest and the 
most important institution of ancient Rome. The strangest, because 
no modern nation has at any time thought of investing an}- magis- 
trate, whether a pope, a king, a minister, or a judge, with powers as 
extensive, as comprehensive, and dangerous as the Romans did with 
regard to their tril)une.>. The tribune was enabled, if unchallenged 
by one of his nine colleagues, to stop any wheel of any part of the 
Roman State machinery. The senate as well as the assembly, the law 
courts as Avell as the religious institutions were, as it were, at the 
mercy of an irresponsible tribune. This, it must l)e admitted, is posi- 
tively incomprehensible, and such of us as want to derive from the 
study of history more than a mere mass of names and dates, can not 
t)ut approach the Roman history of Mommsen with the hope and 
expectation to find some reasonable explanation of the fact that the 
Romans, that is, an eminently practical and sober nation, permitted 
their tribunes to wield a power greater and more irresponsible than 
that commanded by even the mightiest pope of the middle ages. , 



THEODORE MOMMSEN. 855 

This is how Mommsen disposes of the problem of the tribunate. 
He calls that institution a strange magistracy (seltsame Magistratur); 
and the introduction thereof he calls a foolhardy experiment {ver 
wegenes Experiment) or a pis aller (Nothbehelf)," In other words, 
Mommsen disposes of the whole problem b}- sneering at it. In spite 
of the innnensity of his studies of Roman constitutional law, he has 
never so much as approached the only question that is both interesting' 
and instructive for us moderns. If the tribunate be so strange, 
abnormal, inorganic, as Mommsen, Schwegler, L. Lange, and all the 
other German writers declare it to ha^•e been, why then was it the 
only one of the institutions that even Sulla, in spite of the boundless 
power he wielded, did not dare to abolish? Why did the tribunate 
not become obsolete b}" the middle of the fourth century B. C, when 
the plebeians had obtained practically all the rights that the tribunes 
had been introduced to protect? To all this Mommsen does not vouch- 
safe us the slightest reph\ The reason is that Monmisen, absolutely 
unacquainted with magistracies whose powers are remotely similar to 
that of an ancient Roman tribune, could not possil)ly rise to a real 
grasp of that central institution of ancient Rome. In England alone, 
of all modern countries, there has been in the last three or four 
hundred 3'ears a magistracy whose power and character are essentially 
that of Roman magistracies. The groat difference between modern 
constitutions and that of the Romans is the simple fact that we mod- 
erns attach the greatest importance to and invest with the greatest 
powers the members of the national assembly, whereas the Romans 
attached the greatest importance to and invested with the greatest 
powers the incumbents of a few high magistracies. Or, to put it 
even more shortly, the whole Roman constitution was ])ased on per- 
sonality. In England alone we lind a similar principle at work, 
not indeed in every department of the British constitution, 3'et in 
the department of law. Law in England, that is, common law, was 
intrusted to a few great judges who both administered and made it. 
When in the times of the Tudors, and probal)ly before them, the 
incumbents of those great law offices abused their powers, it became 
natural to check and combat them ])y the introduction of a counter 
judge, likewise invested with unbounded power. The power of the 
justices of common law l)eing purely personal and practically irre- 
sponsible, it became inevita])le to check them by the establishment of 
the lord chancellors as judges, who likewise created the law of eciuit}- 
of their own good will, and practically without any respousibilit3\ 
Lord Ellesmere, chancellor under »Iames I, "plainl}- claimed power 
to determine new cases on new principles, even against the law, and to 
legislate on individual rights." (Kerly, D. M., "Historical Sketch of 

«R. G., p. 276 (8th t'dition). 
SM 1903 55 



856 THEODORE MOMMSEN". 

the Equitable Jurisdiction," p. 1'6.) The same relation, then, that we 
can follow and observe between the lord chief justices and the lord 
chancellors in Eno-land; the same relation was on a wider scale and 
more comprehensivel}^ that of the tribune to the other magistracies 
in Home. Just as the chancellor was the natural complement and 
check to the lord chief justice, and not an abnormal or inorganic 
institution in the s^ystem of English law; just as John Selden's (per- 
haps good-natured) sneer at the chancellor's law is based on a total 
misconception of the real and inevitable function of that English 
magistrac}", even so Mommsen's sarcasms and sneers at the Roman 
tri))unate only prove his total misconception of this the most important 
institution of ancient Rome. The tribunate, far from being "" al)nor- 
mal " or "inorganic," "strange," or a "pis aller," was the most 
natural, the most organic, the most inevitable of all Roman institu- 
tions. It stood in the domain of Roman public law in the same rela- 
tion to the other magistracies as does in the domain of Roman private 
law a res facti to a res juris; or as does in the system of Roman private 
law the interdictum to the actio, or any Frretorian legal institution to 
an institution of the jus civile. 

On taking a broad view of Roman history and assuming, as all of us 
do, that a study of that famous nation ought to be not only attractive 
but also instructive, we soon see that there are especially three points, 
in Roman history that appeal more particularly to our interests. 
These points are, in the first place, the marvelous political and military 
success of the Romans, in virtue of which they became the conquer- 
ors and rulers of an empire such as had never been before and has 
never been after — an empire consisting of the most civilized nations in 
the world; secondly, the surprising fact that the Romans, who held 
trade and commence in disdain, should have succeeded in building up 
a system of law which, especially in its sections dealing with trade and 
commerce, has proved to be of the same surpassing excellence that we 
admire in Greek art; and, thirdly, the Roman political constitution, 
which both from the success of ancient Rome and from the imitation 
of that constitution by the mightiest body politic of mediajval and 
modern times — by the Catholic Church — calls upon our closest atten- 
tion and awakens our deepest interest. 

If, now, we turn to Mommsen to obtain from him light on these 
three subjects, we are disappointed in every one case. The problem 
of Roman law he dismisses witli another sneer, saying, literall}^ that 
there is nothing amazing in the fact that "a sound nation had a sound 
law," although he himself points out that the Romans did not excel in 
criminal law, in spite of their "soundness." As to the second problem, 
the military and political success of the Romans, we derive little, if 
any, light from the treatment of Mommsen. We still stand before 
the Fortuua Romanorum as before the Sphinx, and we do not even 



THEODORE MOMMSEN. 857 

knoAv whether the decrepitude of the nations conquered was not greater 
than the fortitude of the Romans. We are still ignorant of the strange 
connection of facts which permitted ever}" single nation of antiquity 
to defeat the Romans in more than one pitched battle, and 3-et in the 
end be compelled to submit to the Roman yoke. We still inquir(> won- 
deringl}" into the great problem why the Romans alone not onl}" trans- 
mitted their own idiom to the conquered nations, but also rapidly 
promoted what the Greeks or Byzantines in the East could never do — 
the rise of neo-Roman languages. 

When at last we try to obtain some real insight into that Roman 
constitution which Mommsen in his series of volumes has tabulated, 
formulated, classified, and systematized, we get from him indeed a 
number of useful schedules similar to the official lists or annuaires 
published by modern governments, enlivened by much juristic and 
legal formulation. It is not denied that the Roman officials and 
magistracies may rightly and legitimately be formulated from juristic 
standpoints, such as we apply in canonical law to the officials of the 
Catholic hierarch3^ The juristic person of a bishop or an archbishop 
is a great, important, and interesting subject. However, it is equally 
certain that the most refined legal systematization of the Catholic or 
the ancient Roman hierarchy or magistracy does not advance us at all 
with regard to a true insight into the historic life and political drift of 
those officials. What is wanted is historic systematization, and not 
juristic. It is like in church history — we must not mix up dogmatics 
with church history. What Professor Mommsen has done to Roman 
constitutional history is precisely what his colleague, Harnack, of the 
Berlin University, has done to the history of Christian dogmatics. 
While Ilarnack's work is deeply engaging and learned, it advances 
only little our insight into the church history proper. Mommsen's 
book would have been an inestimable manual for the officials of the 
first century of the Roman Empire, but it does not help us very nuich 
in the comprehension of the Roman constitution as a product of living- 
history. 

The preceding remarks, no doubt, appear both harsh and ungrate- 
ful. However, a little further consideration will show that it is, we 
take it, necessary to say, and to say very frequently, what man}" a 
serious student outside Germany has long felt to be the case. Wc 
mean the overestimation of German Wissenschaft, of German meth- 
ods of research, more especially of German ways of writing history. 
This overestimation is not likely to ])e felt as such unless it is shown 
up, especially in cases where German scholars have done real and 
great services to the interests of knowledge. The greater the real 
merit, the greater the danger that the mei-it will be exaggerated. 
Just because Mommsen has done so nmch, and has laid all students 
of Roman history under an obligation hard to overrate, we must

ti-}^ to g-et at ji ]ust appreciation of his more constructive work, of the 
thought of his liistorical work, lest by considering it in the same light 
of unconditional admiration as we do his work as a collector of material 
we fall into an imjustiliablc attitude of micritical adoration. The 
Germans chiefly lack what man}" a British and French scholar is amply 
provided for — experience with the realties of life. If it he true that 
knowledge in the first place nuist come from our senses, although in 
the latter stages our sense impressions are worked up to concepts, it 
is undeniable that of past events, such as Roman histor}", we can no 
longer have any sense-impressions proper. 

The oidy way to replace those impossible sense-impressions is to 
stud}'^ modern and contemporary institutions rather than events that 
have a real and essential analogy with those of ancient Rome. By the 
careful selection and study of those analogies alone we may hope to 
derive suggestions if not solutions toward a right and living under- 
standing of Roman institutions. The Germans being practically 
excluded from this, the only method of supplementing the study of 
the Roman and Greek sources and of arriving at a true comprehen- 
sion of ancient history, we can not possibly admit that their innumer- 
able theses, monographs, essays, handbooks, etc., advance our real 
knowledge of Roman history beyond what any British historian might 
very well do b}^ selecting and studving carefulh' the undoubted analo- 
gies in British life and in the British constitution with Roman life and 
the Roman constitution. Surel}^ we are all grateful to Monmisen and 
his rare idealism, his combination of the charms and power of the 
artist with the learning and indefatigable industry of the true scholar, 
are models for all the world, especially for the younger generation. 
On the other hand, it is impossible to suppress a voice of warning 
against the overestimation of methods of historical study, of which 
Theodore Monnusen has been the most illustrious representative, and 
which, we hold, increase the number of books of a purely archaeolog- 
ical interest rather than augment the amount of real historical 
knowledge.
