REPORT UPON THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE

IN CHARGE OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

UPON 



THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM 
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1908. 



Richard Rathbun, 

Assistant Secretary uf the Siiuthsuidaa Institution, in charge of tlic U. S. National Museum. 

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 

Tlie United States National Museum had its origin in the act of 
Congress of 1846 founding the Smithsonian Institution, which made 
the formation of a museum one of the principal functions of the 
hitter, and provided that — 

Whenever suitable arrangements can be made from time to time for their recep- 
tion, all ol)jects of art and of foreign and curious researcli, and all objects of natural 
history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United 
States, Avhich may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever custody they may 
be, shall be delivered to such persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents 
to receive them, and shall be so arranged and classified in the building erected for 
the Institution as best to facilitate the examination and study of them; and when- 
ever new specimens in natural history, geology, or mineralogy are obtained for the 
museum of the Institution, by exchanges of duplicate specimens, which the Regents 
may in then- discretion make, or by donation, which they may receive, or otherwise, 
the Regents shall cause such new specimens to be appropriately classed and arranged. 

The principal and accumulated interest of the Smithsonian fund 
amounted at that time to about $750,000, a sum considered ample to 
meet the needs of the various operations in which it was proposed that 
the Smithsonian Institution should engage. In 18-t6 probably not 
more than one or two universities or learned establishments in Amer- 
ica had so large an endowment, and it was apparently the idea of 
Congress that the fund was sufficient both for the erection of a build- 
ing and for the care of the collections which would be turned over 
to it or acquired by the national surveys, and in other ways. The 
Museum thus began as an integral part of the Institution, coordinate 
with its library, and was required b}' law to provide for the Govern- 
ment collections which had previously accuumlated, a duty which the 

3 



4 REPORT OB' NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Institution did not sec its way clear to fulHU until 185S, when Con- 
uress l)eo-un to make small yearly appropriations to aid in this purpose. 
So inadeiiuate, however, were the sums voted that for many years the 
slender income of the Institution contiiuied to be drawn upon to insure 
the maintenance of what was then justly called the 'Smithsonian 
Museum, since the building was paid for out of the Smithson fund, a 
con8idera))lo portion of the collections was and still is the property of 
the Institution, through exploration and gift, and a number of the offi- 
cials connected with the Museum were employed at its expense. 

The tir.st scientitic collection to come into the possession of the Insti- 
tution—and, in fact, it accompanied the bequest— was the small but 
valuable mineralogical cabinet of James Smithson, the founder, who 
was himself a chemist and mineralogist of repute and a Fellow of the 
Royal Society of London. 

The nucleus of the National Museum was, however, virtually acquired 
by the National Institute, a society organized in Washington about 
1840, having for its avowed purpose the direction of the Smithson 
bequest and the pursuit of objects in consonance with the terms of that 
foundation. One of these objects was the gathering of historical and 
natural history specimens from both official and private sources, most 
prominent among the former having been the United States Exploring 
Expedition around the world from 1838 to 1842. Rooms in the Patent 
Office building were secured for the museum of the society, which was 
practically recognized as the appropriate place of deposit for all Gov- 
ermncnt collections retained in Washington. Another important serv- 
ice rendered b}' the society was, as the late Dr. G. Brown Goode has 
said, in the direction of educating public opinion "to consider the 
estabh'shment of such an institution worthy of the Government of the 
United States."' Failing, however, to secure the public recognition at 
which it aimed, it became inactive upon the establishment of the Smith- 
sonian Institution in 1846, and its charter, which expired in 1861, was 
not renewed. The Government collections in its possession, which 
came practically under the care of the Commissioner of Patents, were 
turned over to the Smithsonian Institution in 1858. Other material 
directly under the control of the National Institute remained at the 
Patent Office until 1862, and a part of the historical objects were held 
there until 1883. 

Previous to 1858, however, important materials for a museum were 
being accumulated at the Smithsonian Institution, at its own cost and 
through the activities of its assistant secretary, Prof. Spencer F. 
Baird, beginning even before his appointment to that office in 1850. 
The personal bent of Professor Baird was toward the collection of 
natural history specimens for purposes of study. With the approval 
of Secretary Henry he put into operation plans for the accomplish- 
ment of this object, which, fostered and encouraged, were soon yield- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5 

ing regular and abundant returns. Professor Baird's own vacations 
were spent in field ^oi'k. Officers of the Arm}' and Nav}' and of other 
branches of the (rovennnent service, fishermen, fur traders, private 
explorers, and such powerful organizations as the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany and the Western Union Telegraph Companj', were enlisted in 
the work and rendered valuable assistance. The influence exerted by 
these beginnings has been lasting and widespread, as shown in the 
extensi\'e natural history operations of subsequent National and vState 
surveys, the organization of the Fish Commission and Bureau of Eth- 
nology, and the support given to scientific collecting by many other 
bureaus of the Government. 

The discussion of plans for the organization of the Smithsonian 
Institution, which devolved upon the first Board of Regents, led, in 
Januar}'^, 1847, to the unanimous adoption of the following resolution 
expressing approval of the museum feature as one of its important 
functions: 

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress establishing the Institution, 
and in accordance with the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that 
one of the principal modes of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of 
collections of specimens and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the 
gradual formation of a library of valuable works pertaining to all dej^artments of 
human knowledge, to the end that a copious storehouse of materials of science, 
literature, and art may be provided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learn- 
ing among men, and shall assist the original investigations and efforts of those who 
may devote themselves to the pursuit of any branch of knowledge, ^f- 

The policy thus announced has prevailed to the present day. 

In 1879, when most of the existing Government surveys, whose 
work included the collecting of specimens in the field, had been estab- 
lished. Congress deemed it important to practically reenf orce the pro- 
visions of the act founding the Institution, in order that there might 
be no doubt as to the proper disposition of the material certain to 1)e 
derived from these various sources, by the following enactment in the 
sundry civil appropriation act for 1880: 

All collections of rocks, minerals, soils, fossils, and objects of natural history, 
archeology, and ethnology, made by the Coast and Interior Survey, the Geological 
Survey, or by any other parties for the Government of the United States, when no 
longer needed for investigations in progress shall be deposited in the National 
Museum. 

Although the name "National Museum" was sometimes used in the 
earlier reports of the Smithsonian Institution, it did not appear in an}' 
of the laws of Congress until 1875. Its general employment may be 
said to date from the time of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition 
of 1870, the first exposition in this country in which the Government 
participated, and the first to make known to vast numbers of the 
people of the United States the existence of national collections at 

"Report of Committee on Organization, p. 20.

Washington, as well as new methods of installing and exhibiting 
nniseuni materials, differing radicalb" from the older calnnets ot col- 
U«<.e or local museums, which had prevailed up to that period. Atter 
its close the Government exhibits brought back to Washington, 
too-ether with the extensive gifts made to the United States by private 
p(M-s()ns and foreign governments, rendered necessary the early.erec- 
tion of a new and separate building, devoted entirely to musemn 
purposes. Since that time Congress has mainly provided for the 
maintenance of the Museum, but its management remains, by the 
fundamental act, under the authority of the Regents of the Smithso- 
nian Institution, administered through their Secretary, who is ex ((jjjclo 
the keeper— a form of government insuring a consistent and uniform 
policy and a nonpartisan administration of its affairs. The greater 
part of the Smithsonian building is still used for museum purposes, 
and the Institution, as well as most of the scientific ])ureaus at Wash- 
ington, cooperate, ])oth through men and material, in enlarging and 
caring for the national collections. 

The scope of the National Museum as defined by law^ comprises 
practically all branches of science and of the arts w^hich admit of 
museum treatment. With exceedingly limited means for making pur- 
chases, and therefore almost entirely dependent as to the character 
of its collections upon Cxovernment explorations, personal donations, 
and exchanges, its different departments have had a very unequal 
growth. The subjects best represented are American ethnolog}^ and 
archeology, geology, zoology, and botany. A fair beginning has been 
made in the exceedingly important l)ranches of the industrial arts 
and xVmerican history, and scarcely more is required to place these 
two departments on a proper basis than sufficient room to displa}' 
the necessary collections, which are certain to be received, in greater 
part through gratuitous contributions, when it is known that the 
Museum is prepared to care for them. In the department of the fine 
arts the collection is still very small, but the subject is one which 
nuist sooner or later receive earnest consideration by the Government. 

The specimens in all branches are classified in two series; one, com- 
prising the ])ulk of the material, being arranged for the purposes of 
scientific research and reference in laboratories and storerooms, to 
which students are freely admitted; the other, selected with regard to 
their general educational value and public interest, and accompanied 
by descriptive labels, ])eing displayed in glass-covered eases in the 
public halls. The duplicate specimens not required for exchanges 
are made up into sets for distribution to schools and colleges, as 
opportunity offers. Papers descriptive of the collections, both tech- 
nical and popular, are published for gratuitous circulation to the 
extent of three or more volumes yearly, and, finally, the Museum 
has come to be regarded as a bureau of information in respect to all 



KEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7 

sul)ject.s with which it is even in the remotest degree concerned, the 
correspondence whicli tliis involves now constituting one of its heaviest 
tasks. 

The liistory of the Museum, as pointed out by the kite Dr. Goode, 
may he divided into three epochs, whicli he characterized as follows: 

First, the i>eri()il fruiu tlic fouiulatiuu of tlie Sinithsoiiian Institution to 1857, dur- 
ing wliich time specimens were eollecte<l solely to serve as materials for research. 
No special effort was made to exhibit them to the jjuhlic or to utilize them, except 
as a foundation for scientific description and theory. 

Second, the period from 1857, when the Institution assumed the custody of the 
"National Cabinet of Curiosities," to 1876. During this period the Museum became 
a place of deposit for scientific collections which had already been studied, these col- 
lections, so far as convenient, being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable, 
made to serve an educational purjiose. 

Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the IMuseuni has 
undertaken more fully the additional task of gathering collections and exhibiting 
them on account of their value from an educational standpoint. 

During the first period the main object of the Museum was scientific research; in 
the second, the establishment became a museum of record as well as of research, 
while in the third period has been added the idea of public education. The three 
ideas — record, research, and education — cooperative and mutually helpful as they 
are, are essential to the development of every great museum. The National Museum 
endeavors to promote them all. 

In the same connection. Dr. Goode also defined the scope and objects 
of the Museum in the following concise maimer: 

It is a museum of record, in which are preserved the material f(jundations of an 
enormous amount of scientific knowledge — the types of numerous past investigations. 
This is especially the case with those materials that have served as a foundation for 
the reports upon the resources of the United States. 

It is a museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in the highest 
degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scientific investigation. Research 
is necessary in order to identify arid group the objects in the most philosophical and 
instructive relations-, and its officers are therefore selected for their ability as iuAesti- 
gators, as well as for their trustworthiness as custodians. 

It is an educational museum, through its j^olicy of illustrating by specimens every 
kind of natural object and every manifestation of luiman thought and activity, of 
displaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and of distributing its 
publications and its named series of duplicates. 

AS A MUSEUM OF RECORD. 

In its function as a museum of record the growth of the National 
Museum has been unprecedented, due mainly to the rapid exploration 
and development of a rich and extensive country under the liberal 
and progressive polic}' of the Government. From scientific institu- 
tions throughout the world, from foreign governments, and from indi- 
viduals abundant stores of great value have been received, either as 
gifts or through the medium of exchange of specimens, and a small 
appropriation in recent years has permitted of some purchases to 
supply desiderata. 



8 KEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

The principal sources of the collections may be briefly summarized 

as follows: t ., j ^i 

i The explorations carried on more or less directly under the 
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, or by the Institution ni con- 
nection with educational institutions or commercial establishments, 
and the efforts, since 1850, of its officers and correspondents toward 
the accumulation of natural history and anthropological material. 

2. The United States Exploring- Expedition around the w^orld from 
1838 to 1812, the North Pacitie, or Perry, Exploring Expedition from 
1853 to 1856, and many subsequent naval expeditions down to and 
including the recent operations in the West Indian and Philippine 

waters. 

3. The activities of members of the United States diplomatic and 

considar service abroad. 

1. The Government surveys at home, such as the Pacific Railroad 
surveys, the Mexican and Canadian boundary surveys, and the surveys 
carried on by the Engineer Corps of the U. S. Army; and the activi- 
ties of officers of the Signal Corps, and other branches of the Army 
stationed in remote regions. 

5. The explorations of the U. S. Geological Survey, the U. S. Fish 
Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of American 
Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, and other scientific branches 
of the (jovernment. 

6. Donations and purchases in connection with the several exposi- 
tions at home and abroad in which the Museum and Fish Commission 
have participated, among these having been the Centennial Exhi])ition 
at Philadelphia in 1876, the International Fisheries Exhibitions at Berlin 
in 1880 and at London in 1883, the New Orleans Cotton Centennial 
Exposition in 1881 and 1885, the Cincinnati Exposition of 1888, the 
World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, and the expositions 
at Atlanta in 1895, at Nashville in 1897, at Omaha in 1898, and at 
the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. The returns from the World's 
Fair in Philadelphia were of greatest extent, comprising, besides the 
collections displayed by the United States in illustration of the animal 
and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of the native 
races of the country, valuable gifts from thirty of the foreign gov- 
ernments which participated, as well as the industrial collections of 
numerous manufacturing and commercial houses of Europe and 
America. 

7. Exchanges with foreign and domestic museums and with indi- 
viduals. 

Inmiediately preceding the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, when the 
collections were entirely provided for in the Smithsonian building, 
the number of entries of specimens in the Museum record books was 
alxHit 235,000. In 1881, when the additional room afforded by the new 
building gave opportunity for taking a provisional census of the large 



REPOKT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9 

accessions received from Philadelphia and from other sources, the 
number had grown to 1,471,000. At the close of the year covered b}^ 
this report the total niunber of recorded specimens was 5,654,864, 

While these figures convev nO impression of the bulk of the collec- 
tions, when it is considered that by 1885 all of the space in both build- 
ings was completely filled, and in fact so overcrowded that a third 
building was already being asked of Congress, some conception may 
be had of the conditions now existing. The storerooms are packed to 
their utmost capacity, making it difficult to gain access to the speci- 
mens or to provide adequately for their safety. For many ^^ears most 
of the objects received have had to be stored in outside and unsafe 
structures, where they are mainly piled up in the original packing- 
boxes, and where has already accumulated enough material of great 
intrinsic and scientific value to fill an additional ])uilding as large as 
that now occupied b}^ the main collections. 

AS A MUSEUM OF RESEARCH. 

In order to permit of their examination and study, as provided in 
the act of establishment, the collections of the Museum are, to the 
extent of its accommodations, arranged systematicalh" and in a manner 
convenient for reference. Access to the reserve or stud}' series, so 
called, consisting of the main body of the collections and as complete 
in all the groups as the accessions have made possible, is given to all 
properly qualified persons engaged in original research. The oppor- 
tunities thus afforded are widely availed of, the Museum being visited 
ever}^ year l)v many investigators, some of world-wndc distinction, 
coming from the scientific centers of European and other foreign 
countries, as well as from all parts of the United States. Material is 
also occasionally sent out to representatives of other institutions 
having the means of providing for its safe-keeping, when required in 
the working up of special subjects, or for comparison in connection 
with their own collections. 

The custodianship of the collections being the first and most impera- 
tive duty devolving upon the scientific statf of the National Museum, 
its members find comparatively little time during ofiice hours for 
advancing knowledge, though they are mostly well cpialified for such 
work, being selected with special reference to their ability to identif}' 
and classify the specimens under their charge in accordance with the 
latest researches. As a matter of fact, however, the staff does pro- 
duce every year a large number of papers descriptive of the collec- 
tions, which together constitute an important contribution to scientific 
literature. 

Among the honorary officers having their laboratories at the Museum 
are a number of assistants emploj'^ed by other scientific bureaus to con- 
duct investigations on material kept here in their charge, and in whose 
results the Museum shares. 



H^ REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Many ocllections have, from time to time, been transferred by the 
Gcokx-'ical Survey, the Fish Commission, the Department of Agricul- 
ture, iuul other iManches of the Government to the custody of the 
I^IuscHun in advance of their iinal working- up, in order to provide for 
their safe storage and to secure the better facilities for study here 
afforded. Under this arrangement the amount of research work car- 
ried on in the ^Museum buikling has been greatly increased. 

Though having litth' means to expend for field work, members of 
the Museum statF are occasionally given opportunities to participate 
in the explorations of other Government luireaus or of private expedi- 
tions, in connection with which special researches may be carried on, 
though the cliief ad\antage results from the acquisition of new and 
valual)le material and a knowledge of the conditions under which it 
occurred in natui'c. 

AS AX EDUCATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The educational side of the Museum is intended to consist mainly 
of an exhibition of all the classes of objects which it represents, so 
mounted, installed, and labeled as to directly interest and instruct the 
general public. The principal difficulty incident to the proper instal- 
lation of such a collection, conceding all the space required, lies in the 
selection of its parts, so that while enough is displayed to convc}^ the 
amount of information which it is intended to impart, the visitor shall 
not be overburdened or confused with details. While this policy is 
being followed in the National Museum so far as its means permit, 
the lack of room has always prevented a complete or satisfactory 
development of the plan, and every succeeding year the conditions in 
this respect glow worse instead of better through the increased crowd- 
ing of the halls. The advances in recent years have been chiefly in 
the methods of display, in the character of individual and group 
mountings, and in the labeling, in all of which directions exceptional 
progress has been made. 

Two years ago it was announced that all of the halls designed for 
public use were then for the first time permanently open, though none 
were above addition or improvement, while in some the arrangement 
was entirely provisional. This was only accomplished by the transfer 
of large quantities of material to outside storage, but during the past 
year it has unfortunately been again necessary to shut ofi' one of the 
most attractive halls in order to furnish increased space for work- 
rooms. 

In this connection it seems appropriate to refer to the work of 
Doctor Goode, than whom no museum administrator ever had a better 
understanding of the public needs. He labored earnestly and con- 
scientiously to make this a museum for as well as of the people, and 
the plans now being carried out are, in all their essential features, of 
his making. While the assistants might be relied upon to arrange and 



■REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 11 

maintain the study series in a manner acceptable to the specialist, the 
interests of the j)ublic always remained in his inmiediate charge. He 
was ever occupied in devising wa^^s for so presenting the features of 
nature and the activities of mankind that l)y the very force of his sur- 
roundings the visitor was bound to receive and carry with him some 
definite impressions, some new bit of knowledge. Doctor Goode's 
lal)ors in this field ranged from the planning of the general scheme to 
the most minute details of case architecture and fittings. His official 
connection with nearly' all the important expositions of the past quar- 
ter of a century and his exhaustive studies of all the principal museums 
of Europe and the United States gave him exceptional opportunities 
for observation and experiment. Though a young man when he died, 
none other had acquired so ripe an experience and none is more worthj^ 
of being followed. 

An incidental though very popular educational feature of the 
Museum, having for its purpose the promotion of scientific teaching 
throughout the country, has been the distribution to schools and col- 
leges of its duplicate specimens, properly identified and labeled, and 
put up in carefully selected sets. Inadequate means have prevented 
this measure from being carried out on the scale which the resources 
of the Museum would admit of, but many hundreds of such sets have 
already been given away. 

Scarceh' a year passes that some exposition, either at home or 
abroad, is not occupying the attention of the Museum, and through 
this means its existence and aims are brought constantly and promi- 
nently before the public. These expositions have of late followed one 
another so closely and have required such extensive preparations as 
to interfere greatly with the ordinary work of the Museum, ])ut the 
practice of introducing new and varied features, of showing a fresh 
series of objects or improved groupings in connection with each one, 
insures a substantial gain, as the collections are returned to Washing- 
ton, besides fulfilling the important function of making museum 
methods known to the people of the United States and stimulating 
the growth of nuiseums in many quarters. 

Though mainly technical and most useful to the investigator, the 
publications of the Museum can be classed, in a general way, as 
belonging to its educational side, being the medium through which 
the nature and extent of its collections are made known. The Annual 
Report, first printed as a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report 
in ISSi, and now in its twentieth volume, consists, besides the admin- 
istrative part, mainly of semipopular papers on interesting portions of 
the collections. The Proceedings and Bulletins are almost exclusively 
technical, the shorter papers being assigned to the former and the 
larger and more exhaustive works to the latter. Of the Proceedings 
twenty-four complete volumes have been issued, and of the Bulletins 
fifty-two numbers. 



12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

AN ADDITIONAr, MUSEUM BUILDING. 

For over two decades a few paragraphs in this report have been 
auiiually devoted to an account of the crowded and unsafe condition 
of the national collections, and the consequent impossibility of further 
complyino- with the law for their proper classification, arranoement, and 
care. " Fortunately these conditions are soon to be remedied through 
the erection of an additional building, having a capacity far exceeding 
that of the existing structures combined, wdth exhibition halls to the 
extent of nearly 5 acres, and facilities for all kinds of museum work. 

In the last report it was announced that Congress had authorized 
the preparation of plans for this new building, which was to be con- 
structed of brick and terra cotta at a limit of cost of $1,500,000, and 
to occupy a site on the north side of the Mall opposite the Smith- 
sonian Institution. Such a building, though large enough to relieve 
the immediate demands for additional space, would provide very 
inadequately for the growth of the collections, and the material named 
for the fronts w^as not considered entirely suitable for a structure of 
the character proposed. Nearly a year was occupied in examining 
into the requirements of the collections and in studying the principal 
features of other museums. During the winter of 1902-3, a series 
of tentative plans was prepared, and accompanied by a supplementary 
report Ijy the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution was submitted 
to a special committee consisting of the Congressional Regents, "to 
represent to Congress the pressing needs of additional room for the 
proper exhibition of specimens belonging to the National Museum." 
On January 23, 1903, the same papers were transmitted to Congress 
and printed as Document 314 of the House of Kepresentatives. 

The plans provided for a large rectangular building, four stories 
high including the basement, which was to be in all essential features 
the equivalent of a story, well lighted and entirely serviceable for 
museum purposes. The cost of the whole building, constructed of 
brick and terra cotta, was estimated at $3,000,000, but one-half of the 
structure, in symmetrical form, could be built for $1,500,000, thus 
meeting the requirements of the act of 1902. The special committee 
of the Regents above mentioned adopted the report of the Secretary, 
though urging the larger building, in the following resolution: 

That under the limitations of the law the committee hereby report to Congress Plan 
B for a new National Museum building as the best obtainable for the amount men- 
tioned; but, in the judgment of the committee, the larger plan, A, is believed to be 
the one which should be adopted, and we therefore ask that Congress shall make 
the appropriation for it instead of for the smaller plan. 

Hearings followed before the Committees on Appropriations of 
both the House and Senate, and a plea was made for the use of granite 
instead of brick and terra cotta. The House took no action, but a bill 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13 

for the erection of the entire building in granite, at a limiting cost of 
$3,500,000, was adopted b}^ the Senate, and the measure in this shape 
was finall}' agreed to in conference between the committees of the two 
Houses. The bill as passed, being an item in the sundry civil act for 
1904, was as fellows: 

Building for National Museum: To enable the Regents of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion to commence the erection of a suitable firei^roof building with granite fronts, for 
the use of the National Museum, to be erected on the north side of the Mall, between 
Ninth and Twelfth streets, northwest, substantially in accordance with the Plan A, 
prepared and submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution 
under the provisions of the act approved June twenty-eighth, nineteen hundred and 
two, two hundred and tifty thousand dollars. Said building complete, including 
heating and ventilating apparatus and elevators, shall cost not to exceed three mil- 
lion five hundred thousand dollars, and a contract or contracts for its completion is 
hereby authorized to be entered into subject to appropriations to be made by Con- 
gress. The construction shall be in charge of Bernard R. Green, Superintendent of 
Buildings and Grounds, Lil)rary of Congress, who shall make the contracts herein 
authorized and disburse all apjiropriations made for the work, and shall receive as 
full compensation for his services hereunder the sum of two thousand dollars annually 
in addition to his present salary, to be paid out of said appropriations. 

At a meeting of the Board of Regents held on INIarch 12, 1903, a 
connuittee to represent the Board in connection with the work of con- 
struction was designated by resolution as follows: 

That the Secretary, with the advice and consent of the Chancellor and the chair- 
man of the executive committee, ])e authorized to represent the Board of Regents so 
far as may be necessary in consultation with Bernard R. Green, to whom the con- 
struction and contracts for the new Museum building are committed by Congress in 
the act making an appropriation for that purpose. 

Messrs. Hornblower & Marshall, of Washington, who made the ten- 
tative plans, were selected as architects and before the close of the 
fiscal year their part of the work was well under yvay. It is expected 
that about four or live years will be required for the construction of 
the building. 



SUMMARY OF THE OPEBATIONS 0¥ THE YEAR. 



APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENDITURES. 

The CongTessional appropriations for the inaintenance of the National 
Museum during tlie iiscal year ending- June 3l», 11)03, amounted to 
$281,^:00, a decrease of $8,000 as compared with the previous year, the 
chang-es being as follows: The bill for 1902 contained three specific 
appropriations, one of $5,000 for the construction of two galleries, one 
of $6,000 for electrical installation, and one of $12,500 for new boilers, 
while the appropriations for 1903 comprised a new item of $7,000 for 
preparing and printing the Contributions from the U. S. National 
Herbarium, heretofore published by the Department of Agriculture, 
$5,000 for the preparation of plans for an additional Museum building, 
and an increase of $2,500 in the appropriation for furniture and 
fixtures.

BUILDINGS. 

At its last session, ending March 4, 1903, Congress authorized, in 
the sundry civil act for 1903-4, the construction of an additional fire- 
proof building of granite for the National Museum, at a cost not to 
exceed $3,500,000, and appropriated $250,000 for the requirements of 
the first year. The preparation of the final plans was begun near 
the close of the fiscal year, and the work will be pushed as rapidly as 
possible. 

^ The roofs on the several sections of the Museum building have con- 
tinued to give troul)le, as new leaks develop during every heavy rain 
and snow storm. This is more especially the case with the slate cov- 
erings over the main halls, but the tin roofs are also in bad condition 



EEPOKT OF ASSISTANT SECEETARY. 17 

and both demand constant attention and repair, at some expense. 
Before many 3'ears a new roof will become absolutely necessar}^ but 
in the meantime it is proposed, should the regular appropriations suf- 
fice for the purpose, to gradually replace the slate coverings with bet- 
ter material, as only in this manner can the more pressing difficulties 
be even temporarily overcome. 

The leaks w^hich have occurred through many years, and the fre- 
quent repairs to walls and ceilings, had so defaced the interior of the 
greater part of the Museum building as to render it unsightl}" in the 
extreme. At the beginning of the fiscal year it was decided to remedy 
these conditions so far as possible by painting those parts of the build- 
ing which required it, in accordance with a simple but artistic scheme 
of color. The rotunda and main halls were first completed, and next 
three of the courts, leaving only one of the latter to be done during 
the current j^ear. The ranges do not call for any changes in this 
respect at present. With this improvement the building has now 
been placed in a far more presentable condition than ever before. 

Another improvement in the Museum building has been the arrange- 
ment of inner screen doors at the eastern or freight entrance, so as to 
close off from the public or exhibition halls the vestibule in which 
packages are received. Some of the rooms over this same entrance, 
used by the Division of Plants, have also been modified and enlarged. 

The archeological hall in the Smithsonian building has been closed 
to the public during nearly the entire year. In September, 1902, so 
manj^ large pieces of plaster fell from the ceiling that its condition was 
declared unsafe, and though all of the loose plaster was subsequentl}" 
removed, yet the appearance of the hall does not justify its reopening 
at ji resent. It is expected, however, to make such temporary repairs 
before the close of another year as will permit of its being again made 
accessible. 

ADDITIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS. 

The number of accessions or separate lots of material received dur- 
ing the year was 1,643, being 231 more than in 1902. They comprised 
about 236,580 specimens of all kinds, bringing the total number of 
specimens in the several departments of the Museum up to about 
5,651,861. There were also received for identification 886 lots of speci- 
mens, the most of which were returned to the senders with the infor- 
mation requested. 

The most constant and important sources of material are the national 
surveys and explorations, whose collections are, by law, transferred 
to the custody of the Museum as soon as the necessary studies upon 
them have been completed. The bureaus which figure most promi- 
nently in this work are the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, 
the Biological Survey, and the Divisions of Insects and Plants of the

18 BEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Department of Aoricultiirc, and the Bureau of American Ethnology of 
the Smithsonian Institution, though valuable contributions are occa- 
sionally obtained from other In-anches of the Government service, and 
officers of tlie Army and Navy stationed in the new possessions have, 
in their individual capacity, been rendering much assistance. A very 
large share of the additions to the collections is, however, received 
from private individuals and establishments through donation and 
exchange, and the exhibition series derives many of its attractive 
feature's from loans or deposits. Field collecting l)y members of the 
Museum staff is almost prohibited by the lack of funds, and the acqui- 
sition of specimens by purchase is seriously restricted because of the 
small amount appropriated for that purpose. 

A complete list of the accessions foi- the year is given in Appendix 
11, and the important ones are described in the reports of the head 
curators. Only some of the more noteworthy ones will, therefore, be 
referred to in this connection. 

The total number of specimens added in the Department of Anthro- 
pologv was 24,319, of which 16,181 specimens belonged in the Division 
of Prehistoric Archeology, 4,517 in Ethnology, and 1,502 each in 
History and the Graphic Arts. One of the most valuable acquisitions 
consisted of material recently collected by Dr. AV. L. Abbott in 
Sumatra and the Straits Settlements, and illustrated the native arts 
and industriesof a region but poorly represented in American museums. 
The many objects, numbering over 1,500, secured in the Philippine 
Islands b}" the late Col. F. F. Hilder, of the Bureau of American 
Ethnolog}^ for the Government exhibit at the Pan-American Exposi- 
tion, have been turned over to the Museum by the Government Board. 
This collection is of especial interest in that it furnishes much author- 
itative information regarding the life and customs of the natives of 
the largest of our new possessions. Dr. Frank Russell, formerly of 
the Bureau of American P^thnology, secured important material from 
'the Pima Indians of southern Arizona, which, together with many 
ethnological objects from other sources, have been transferred by the 
Bureau to the custody of the Museum. Several collections made by 
Lieut. G. T. Emmons, of the United States Navy, illustrating the arts 
of the Chilcat and other Alaskan tribes, have also been acquired. 

An extremely noteworthy collection deposited in the Museum by 
Mr. S. S. Rowland, of Washington, D. C, consists of objects repre- 
senting Buddhist religious art, such as bronze and wooden images of 
Buddha and Buddhist saints, shrines, temple lamps, and sacred writ- 
ings on palm leaves, and also of several oriental manuscripts in 
Hebrew, Arabic, and other languages. Miss Eliza R. Scidmore, of 
AVashington, also deposited a number of examples of Buddhist and 
Hindu religious art. Twenty-eight Jewish ceremonial objects from 
North Africa were obtained from Mr. Ephraim Deinard, of Kearney, 
New Jersey, one of the most interesting })ieces being an ark of carved

"wood, containing a parchment scroll of the Pentateuch. The Egyp- 
tian exploration fund has presented some valuable Grseco-Egyptian 
papyri. 

Among the accessions in the Division of Prehistoric Archeology 
were a collection of implements and other objects obtained by Mr. 
W. H. Holmes from near Kimmswick, Missouri, with the assistance 
of Mr. Gerard Fowke, who also transmitted a number of hammer- 
stones, flint nodules, and other objects from ancient quarries near 
Carter, Kentucky, and a series of implements and specimens of ore, 
which had been mined for use as paint, from aboriginal mines at 
Leslie, Missouri, collected by Mr. Holmes. About 3,000 specimens of 
stone implements, gathered by the late Mr. Frank Hamilton Gushing, 
including spearheads, arrowpoints, harpoons, and tools of various 
kinds, and a very important collection made l)y Dr. J. Walter Fewkes 
in Porto Rico and Santo Domingo were received from the Bureau of 
American Ethnology. The material from Santo Domingo comprises 
many types new to the Museimi, while that from Porto Rico contains 
several stone rings or collars, sculptured pillow stones, the remains of 
human skeletons, and various other objects. 

A collection of stone implements of various types, pottery, bowls, 
vases, etc., chieflj^ from the Mississippi Valley and the Pueblo region, 
was obtained from Mr. E. O. Matthews, of Parral, Mexico, and many 
objects illustrative of the stone age in Uruguay were received in 
exchange from the Museo Nacional at Montevideo, through the cour- 
tesy of Seiior Luis A. de Herrera, secretary of the Uruguayan lega- 
tion at Washington. Mr. H. W. Seton-Karr, of London, England, 
presented a series of paleolithic quartzite implements selected from a 
collection made by him in the Lateritic deposits near Madras, India. 

A series of models of United States war vessels, including gunboats, 
monitors, protected cruisers, and rams, deposited in the Museum by 
the Navy Department, forms a very attractive exhibit, being- of espe- 
cial interest to the pul)lic. The War Department has also deposited a 
large number of models of heavy seacoast cannon, mountain howitzers, 
and other types of ordnance formerly used by the Army, and examples 
of small arms. 

Many relics of General and Mrs. U. S. Grant, of great intrinsic as 
well as historic value, have been presented to the Museum by their 
children, through Brig. Gen. Frederick D. Grant, U. S. Arm3\ 
They include clothing worn by General Grant during the civil war, 
commissions to different ranks in the Arnn' , a cabinet present to Mrs. 
Grant by the Empress of Japan, said to be one thousand years old 
and valued at $20,000; several Japanese vases presented by the 
Emperor of Japan, a lady's toilet set in gold from the King and Queen 
of Siam, and numerous other objects. 

Eight hundred and thirty-seven gold, silver, and copper coins were 
donated to the Museum by Mr. E. ^I. Chapman, of New York City. 



20 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Casts of th(^. Neandcrtlial and Prague ancient crania were purchased 
for the newly established Division of Physical Anthropology, which 
has also secured five valuable head-hunter's skulls from New Guinea, 
and a large series of crania and parts of human skeletons from the 
Army Medical Museum, the U. S. Fish Commission, and other sources. 

The Department of Biology received about 110,000 specimens, of 
which approximately one-third were botanical. In zoology the Division 
of Insects led with 37,684 specimens, followed by marine invertebrates 
with 12,471 specimens, mammals with 7,435 specimens, mollusks with 
6,332 specimens, and birds with 3,800 specimens. 

The zoological specimens contributed by Dr. W. L. Abbott con- 
sisted of a large mimber of deer, squirrels, porcupines, and a new 
ape, collected in Sumatra and on the adjacent islands, and in the Riou 
Linga Archipelago, south of Singapore. Many of the species are new 
to science. The donations made by Doctor Abbott, as the result of his 
recent extensive explorations in the East Indies, now comprise about 
2,500 mammals and nearly 4,000 birds, besides several thousand speci- 
mens in other branches of natural history. 

Large collections of bird skins and eggs, fishes, corals, mollusks, 
crustaceans, and other marine invertebrates, obtained during the 
expedition of the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross to the 
Hawaiian Islands and to Samoa, have been transmitted to the Museum 
and will be referred to more in detail in the next report. They 
include interesting series of the birds of the Laysan Islands. 

Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, presented a quantity of mammals 
from the Yellowstone National Park and from Fort Snelliug, Minne- 
sota, and the Hon. B. S. Rairden, United States consul at Batavia, 
two undescribed species of Tragulus from Java. An important collec- 
tion of bats was obtained from Mr. William Foster, of Sapucay, 
Paraguay; and one of bats and rodents from Mr. T. Tsuchida, of 
Misaki, Japan. A valuable skeleton of the porpoise, Pseudorca 
c?r(ssidens, from the Hawaiian Islands, the first reported from that 
region, was contributed by Prof. C. H. Gilbert, of the Leland Stan- 
ford Junior University. 

Several rare birds of paradise and other valual)le specimens, includ- 
ing a pair of flightless cormorants, from the Galapagos Islands, were 
received from Mr. A. Boucard, Isle of Wight, England, and a Javan 
jungle fowl, a black- winged peacock, and other birds from Mr. Homer 
Davenport, Morris Plains, New Jersey. The Bishop Museum, of 
Honolulu, presented about 40 bird skins, including several species not 
previously represented in the Museum collection, and 295 interesting 
specimens from Chiriqui, Costa Pica, including a number of cotypes, 
and 52 bird skins from Honduras were obtained from Mr. Outram 
Bangs, of Boston, partly as a gift and partly in exchange. The most 
important accession to the oological collection was a fossil eg(r of 
Aepi/or?iis maximus from Madagascar. Valuable birds' eggs from

Giacomo Cecconi, of Florence, Italy, and 29 snakes from Jamaica and 
Michigan were donated by Prof. H. L. Clark, of Olivet College, 
Michigan, 

The accessions to the collection of fishes were numerous and impor- 
tant. Dr. O. P. Jenkins, of Leland Stanford Junior University, 
donated 42 types of Hawaiian fishes, constituting a second installment 
of a series of types the first of which were transmitted in 1901. A 
valuable collection of types and cotj'pes of Japanese fishes was received 
from Dr. David S. Jordan, president of the same univ^ersity. A large 
salmon, weighing about 50 pounds, taken at Cascapedia, Canada, was 
presented by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia. A deep-sea 
pelican fish, captured at a depth of between 2,000 and 3,000 fathoms, 
during the survey for the Pacific cable, was transmitted by the officers 
of the U. S. S. Av^/'o, and a large conger eel was received from Mr. 
Louis Mowbray, of Bermuda, through the New York Aquarium. 

Besides the mollusks obtained by the Fish Commission expedition to

donations during the past year, transmitting- a series of plants from 
the West Indies and Central America. 

The collections in the Department of (xeology were increased b}- 
about 102,000 specimens, of which 97,000 were fossil invertebrates. 
As in past j^ears, the principal accessions were from the U. S. 
Geological Survey. Among the more important ones were a series of 
minerals, rocks, and ores, constituting a portion of the exhibit made 
by the Survey at the expositions recently held in Buffalo and Charles- 
ton, and a collection of rocks from Arizona, California, Idaho, Colo- 
rado, Oregon, and Washington. An interesting lot of tourmalinitic 
quartz from Little Pipestone district, Montana, of which some of the 
specimens are covered on one side with parallel layers of amethysts of 
different hues, accompanied the former. 

A valuable series of massive and cut polished stalactites and stalag-

important additions to the meteoric collections. 

A small piece of the only known specimen of footeite was donated 
by Mr. Warren M. Foote, of Philadelphia, and man}^ very desirable 
minerals, some of which were not previously represented in the 
Museum collection, were obtained from different sources. 

The largest and most valuable addition to the Division of Strati- 
graphic Paleontology was the second installment of the E. O. Ulrich 
collection of Paleozoic bryozoans, comprising about 75,000 specimens 
and 2,500 microscopic slides. The collection as a whole is the most 
extensive of its kind in existence and contains many unique specimens. 
About 11,000 corals, crinoids, mollusks, and other fossil invertebrates 
from the Mississippi Valley Paleozoic were received from Dr. Carl 
Rominger, of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Many of these have been figured 
and described in the reports of the Geological Survey of Michigan. 
The Andrew Sherwood collection of Penns3dvania Upper Devonic 
vertebrate and invertebrate fossils is also entitled to special notice. 
It was brought together by Mr. Sherwood, and includes many choice 
slabs filled with large brachiopods and mollusks, besides about 3,000

EXPLORATIONS. 

Fewer explorations than usual were carried on last year directlj^ by 
the Museum, owing to insufficient means for that purpose. Field work 
under the Bureau of American Ethnology, which 3'ielded interesting 
collections of objects, since deposited in the Museum, as before men- 
tioned, was conducted by Mr. William H. Holmes, Mr. Gerard Fowke, 
and Dr. J. Walter Fewkes. Mr. Holmes visited the aboriginal hema- 
tite mines at Leslie, Missouri, and Doctor Fewkes an ancient quarry 
in Carter County, Kentucky, while Doctor Fewkes also spent consider- 
able time in Santo Domingo and Porto Rico. 

The important explorations of Dr. William L, Abbott in Sumatra 
and the adjoining islands, as well as on the mainland of the Straits 



26 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Scttleinents, have already been referred to under the heading of 
"Additions to the CoOections/' These explorations, which are carried 
on entirely at the expense of Doctoi- Abbott, have now been in prog- 
ress for several years, and through his generosity the National Museum 
has been the fortunate recipient of the very large and extremely valu- 
able collections that he has made. 

In the spring of 1903 Mr. F. A. Lucas, accompanied by Mr. William 
Palmer and Mr. J. W. Scollick, all of the Museum staff, visited one of 
the stations of the Cabot Steam Whaling Company on the coast of 
Newfoundland in the interest of the St. Louis Exposition for the pur- 
pose of securing as complete a representation as possible of a large 
sulphur-bottom whale. He was entirely successful, returning with a 
perfect skeleton of a specimen measuring about 78 feet long, and with 
molds of the exterior, from which a cast of the entire animal will be 
made. These specimens at the close of the exposition will l)e exhib- 
ited in the Museum. 

Through the courtesy of the (jeographical Society of Baltimore, the 
Museum was enabled to send Mr. B. A. Bean and Mr. J. H. Riley with 
an expedition to the Bahama Islands, W' here they were to make collec- 
tion of the fishes and land animals of that region. The party was still 
absent at the close of the year. 

Dr. H. G. Dyar, with Mr. Rolla P. Currie, of the National Museum, 
and Mr. A. N. Caudell, of the Department of Agriculture, accom- 
panied an expedition to British Columbia under the auspices of the 
Carnegie Institution, and it is expected that they will bring back a 
large and important collection of insects. 

Mr. S. Ward Loper, of the U. S. Geological Survey, made for the 
Museum an interesting collection of Triassic plants in Connecticut and 
Massachusetts, and through arrangements with the Director of the 
Survey, Hon. Charles D. Walcott, Mr. Charles Schuchert, of the 
Museum staft', spent several weeks in Virginia and Georgia with 
the special view of determining the geological horizons of the southern 
part of the Appalachians. Incidental to this study he collected many 
fossils. Several weeks were spent by Mr. R. S. Bassler in Ohio, 
Indiana, and Kentucky collecting invertebrate fossils. A small collec- 
tion of natural history specimens, obtained about Franz Josef Land 
by the Baldwin-Ziegler expedition of 1902 to the Polar regions, was 
presented to the Museum by Mr. William Ziegler. It is hoped that 
the second expedition, now in progress under the same auspices, will 
result in additional accessions from that little-known region. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE OF SPECIMENS. 

The number of specimens furnished to specialists outside of the 
Museum for study was 12,529, almost twice as many as during the 
previous year, while the sets of d':plicates distributed to educational

esta])lishmcnt,s in this countiy, together with those used in making- 
exchanges with individuals and institutions both at home and abroad, 
comprised 33,228 specimens. The educational series consisted of 
marine invertebrates, fishes, and geological material illustrating the 
results of rock weathering and soil formation.

RESEARCHES. 

Under the act of Congress founding the Smithsonian Institution the 
Museum staff is charged with the classification and arrangement as well 
as with the care and preservation of the national collections, and 
although many of the accessions have been previously worked up, the 
greater number reach the Museum unstudied and unnamed. 

In selecting the assistants in every grade, therefore, it has been 
necessary from the beginning to consider their qualifications with 
reference to expert knowledge of the groups of specimens to be placed 
under their charge, and in this manner a very effective though small 
staff of paid scientific workers has been assembled. The greater part 
of the time of these assistants has, naturally, to be given to the routine 
duties attendant upon the receipt, assorting, labeling, cataloguing, and 
disposition of the collection as received, but by working outside the 



EEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 29 

official hours, a characteristic of ever}^ zealous man of science, the}" 
are to be credited every year with important progress in classification 
and in other studies. Besides the paid assistants, however, there are 
nearly as many volunteer or honorary members of the scientific staff, 
tilling positions for which the appropriations are insufficient to make 
provision, and from these also extensive results in the elaboration of 
collections are obtained. But notwithstanding these facts the Museum 
depends to a large extent, for the study of its collections, on the 
cooperation of scientific men belonging to other institutions, their 
work being done gratuitously, and frequent calls are made upon its 
resources to aid in researches conducted under other auspices. 

In the Department of Anthropologj^, Prof. O. T. Mason, the Acting 
Head Curator, was mainly occupied in completing his revised paper 
on aboriginal basketry which is to appear as an appendix to the 
Annual Report for 1902. Dr. A. Hrdlicka, Assistant Curator of 
Physical x4.nthropology, made a study of the Lansing skeleton, includ- 
ing an examination of other material. A description of the Parsee 
creed and ceremonials represented in the collections of the Museum 
was prepared b}^ Dr. I. M. Casanowicz and published in the American 
Anthropologist. Dr. Cj^rus Adler and l^r. Casanowicz continued their 
work on a bibliography of Assyriology. 

Among the investigators from other places who were given facilities 
for making studies on anthropological subjects were M. Pittier, head 
of the National Museum of Costa Rica; Dr. Carl von den Steinen, of 
Berlin; Dr. Hjalmar Stolpe, director of the Royal Museum of Sweden 
at Stockholm; Prof. Hartmann, of Stockholm; Dr. A. B. Hunter of 
Raleigh, N. C; Dr. E. A. Bogue, of New York City; and Dr. Walde- 
mar Bogoras, of the American Museum of Natural History \ Doctor 
Bogoras's visit was made in the interest of his explorations among the 
tribes of northeastern Siberia and for the purpose of ascertaining 
whether any material of Siberian origin was contained in the extensive 
Eskimo collection of this Museum. 

In the Department of Biology Mr. G. S. Miller, jr.. Assistant Cura- 
tor of Mammals, gave special attention to the working up of Doctor 
Abbott's collections of East Indian mammals, in which he has already 
discovered IT new species of mouse deer (genus Tragulns), 16 new 
species belonging to other orders, and one new genus {LenofJirlx). 
In the Museum collection of American bats, he has found 20 unde- 
scribed species, diagnoses of which have been published in the pro- 
ceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. He has 
also prepared notes on a number of species of bats and rodents. Dr. 
E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, made a study of the ocelots, the results of 
which were printed in the Museum Proceedings. Dr. M. W. Lvon, jr., 
has completed a list of the t\'pe specimens of mammals, exclusive of 
cetaceans, in the collections of the Museum, which number 469 species 



30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

and yubspccies. Thotograplis of the types are still to be prepared. 
Doctor Lyon has also pursued investigations on the osteology of the 
rabbits, and has pu])lished two brief notes on other mammals. The 
head curator of biology, Dr. Frederick W. True, completed an enten- 
sive and important monograph on the North American and European 
species of whalebone whales, his manuscript being su})mitted for pub- 
lication toward the close of the year. He also prepared papers on 
Doctor Philippi's species of Chilean porpoises, on a killer whale 
stranded on the coast of Maine, and on a species of Prodelphinus 
obtained at Honolulu; and notes on the name of the common porpoise 
of the genus Tursiops^ and on the occurence of the pollack whale, 
Balaenoptera horeaUs^ in American waters. 

The second volume of Mr. Robert Ridgway's manual of North and 
Central American birds, containing 854 pages of text and 22 plates, 
was issued during the 3'ear. It deals with the families of Tanagers, 
Troupials, Honey Creepers and Wood Warblers (Tanagridw, lcterida3, 
Coerebidje and Mniotiltidse), comprising 77 genera and 433 species 
and subspecies. The preparation of the third volume, covering 15 
families, is well advanced, about 400 pages being now in type. A 
paper by Dr. Charles W. Richmond on the birds collected by Doctor 
Abbott and Mr. C. B. Kloss, in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands has 
been published, and Doctor Richmond has also spent much time in 
working up the Abbott collection of birds from the west coast of 
Sumatra, and a collection from the South Paciiic. He has likewise 
made considerable pi-ogress with the card catalogue of the genera and 
species of birds. Dr. William L. Ralph continued the preparation of 
material for a volume on the life-histories of North American birds 
with special reference to their nests and eggs, supplemental to the 
unfinished work of the late Major C. E. Bendire, U. S. Army. 

Dr. Leonhard Stejneger completed his report on the reptiles of 
Porto Rico and has been engaged in the investigation of the reptile 
fauna of Eastern Asia. Papers by Doctor Stejneger on Holbrook's 
salamander and on the reptiles of the Huachuca INlountains, Arizona, 
were published by the Museum during the year. 

In connection with an extensive work on the Tertiary mollusks 
of Florida, Dr. W. H. Dall prepared reviews of the recent species of 
Venerid*, Carditacea, Cyrenacea, and Astartidfe. Mr. Bartscli con- 
tinued his studies on the Pyramidellida?, which were nearly linished at 
the close of the year. 

Dr. W. H. Ashmead continued his work upon the classiiication of 
the Chalcid-flies, which is now in course of printing ])y the Carnegie 
Museum, and published several papers on the wasps of the groups 
Vespoidea, Proctotrypoidea, and Cynipoidea. Ho had also in course 
of preparation monographs on the North American Braconidte and the 
Japanese Ilymenoptera, and a catalogue of North American Hvme- 



UEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 31 

noptera. Mr. D. W. Coquillett was occupied in identifying and arrang- 
ing the Diptera and completed a revision of the genera of the family 
Empididte. A paper by him descriptive of 4 new genera and 94 new 
species of North American diptera was printed in the Proceedings. 
Mr, Nathan Banks published 1 6 papers on spiders and other entomo- 
logical subjects. A paper on dragon-flies and one on ant-lions, b}^ 
Mr. Rolla P. Currie, were published b}^ the P^ntomological Society of 
Washington. Mr. Currie continued work on a catalogue of North 
American Ncuropteroid insects, and on a monograph of the ant-lions. 
Mr. August Busck published two papers on the codling-moth and one 
on a new species of the family Yponomentidic, and also a revision of 
the American moths of the family GelechiidjB. The Museum Proceed- 
ings for the year contained a paper by Dr. H. (j. Dj-ar on the larvfe 
of moths from Colorado, and an additional section of Dr. John G. 
Smith's monograph of the moths of the family Noctuida?. 

The researches ])y Dr. J. E. Benedict included a revision of the 
genus Lepidopa^ descriptions of new Galatheid*, Albuneidtv, and 
Dromida\ and studies upon the Anomuran crabs collected in Japanese 
and Hawaiian waters by the Fish Commission steamer Alhatro-ss^ and 
upon several interesting annelids. Miss M. J. Rathbun continued 
work on a monograph of the fresh-water crabs based on the collec- 
tions of the U. S. National Museum, the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, 
Paris, the Museum of Comparative Zoology of Harvard Universit}^, 
and other institutions. She also prepared five short papers on 
crustaceans which were printed during the year. 

Miss Harriet Richardson completed reports on the Isopod crustace- 
ans collected in Hawaii and Japan by the Fish Commission steamer 
Alhatross, and in Japan by the U. S. S. Palos in 1881, and by Dr. 
D. S. Jordan and J. O. Sn3^der in 1900, and also on some cymothoids 
collected b}^ Dr. C. H. Gilbert on the west coast of Central America, 
and on the American Epicaridea in the U. S. National Museum. 

Dr. C. W. Stiles, Custodian of the helminthological collections, 
made an extended investigation of a parasitic disease prevalent among 
the i^eople of the Southern States, which he found to be due to the 
attacks of an undescribed species of hook-worm, Uncinaria americana, 
and carried on inquiries'regarding the frequency of the occurrence of 
parasites in men. He published twelve papers during the year relat- 
ing to parasitolog}", three of these having been prepared conjointly 
with Dr. Albert Hassall and Mr. Charles A. Pfender; and also the 
first three parts of an index-catalogue of medical and veterinary 
zoology, with Doctor Hassall as coauthor. 

In the Division of Plants, an unusual amount of routine work, espe- 
cially in connection with the rearrangement of the collections, pre- 
vented the accomplishment of much scientific research. A third 
section of Dr. J. N. Rose's studies of Mexican and Central American 
plants, and a paper liy the same author in conjunction with Mr, 



32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

W. B. Hemsley on tlie ^enus JuUania Avere printed. Doctor Rose also 
continued work on the Crassulacete of North America conjointly with 
Doctor Britton, and completed a preliminary paper relating to that 
group of plants. Mr. C. L. Pollard contributed a number of notes 
to the Plant World, and described two new violets from the United 
States. With Mr. T. D. A. Cockerell lie also published descriptions 
of four new plants from New Mexico. Mr. W. R. Maxon continued 
his studies on the Museum collection of ferns, and Mr. Edward S. 
Steele completed a monograph on a section of the genus Lacinlaria. 

Access to the collections in biology were accorded during the year 
to a considerable number of visiting naturalists. The meetings of 
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Society 
of American Naturalists, and other affiliated societies during convoca- 
tion week brought together in Washington many prominent investi- 
gators, and while their time was limited, some of them took advantage 
of the opportunity to examine specimens in the line of their specialty. 
The committee on nomenclature of the American Ornithologists' Union 
during its meeting from April 16 to 18 made extensive use of the 
bird collection in determining the status of North American species. 
Among individual ornithologists to whom the same privilege was 
given were Prof. W. W. Cooke, Mr. E. W. Nelson, Mr. H. C. Ober- 
holser, and Mr. W. H. Osgood, of the Department of Agriculture; 
Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston; Dr. J. Dwight, jr., of New York City; 
and Mrs. Florence Merriam Bailey, of Washington. 

Mr. Thomas Barber, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, was here for 
some time studying the Old World chameleons, which he proposes to 
monograph. Among students of entomology who conducted work 
at the Museum were Dr. W. J. Holland, Director of the Carnegie 
Museum, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania; Prof. John B. Smith, of Rutgers 
College, New Brunswick, New Jersey; Dr. James A. G. Rehn and Mr. 
J. Chester Bradley, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Mr. H. H. Ballou, 
of Amherst, Massachusetts, and Dr. Walter Horn, of Berlin, Germany. 

Prof. W. P. Ha}^ of Howard University, Washington, continued 
his studies upon crayfishes and other fresh-water crustaceans, and 
completed descriptions of the species collected by himself at Mam- 
moth Cave, Kentucky, and Nickajack Cave* Tennessee, and by Dr. 
C. H. Eigenmann in Cuba. Prof. G. I. Hamaker, of Trinity College, 
Durham, North Carolina, examined the specimens of Cerianthus; Miss 
Katherine J. Bush, of the Peabody Museum of Yale University, cer- 
tain type specimens of Annelids, and Dr. S. J. Holmes, of the Uni- 
versity of Michigan, certain species of Amphipod crustaceans. 

The principal visiting botanists have been Dr. N. L. Britton, Direc- 
tor of the New York Botanical Garden; Dr. L. M. Underwood, of 
Columbia University, New York City; Mr. Theodor Holm, of Brook- 
land, District of Columbia; and Dr. E. L. Greene, of the Catholic 
University, Washington.

The herbarium has also been constantly utilized by the botanists of 
the Department of Ag-rioulturc. 

A large amount of material from the Department of Biology was 
lent to specialists for study or sent to them for working up in the 
interest of the National Museum. The Biological Survey of the 
Department of Agriculture had the use of many specimens of mam- 
mals, and specimens of the same group were sent out of the city as 
follows:

State paleontologist of New York, 

PROGRESS IN THE INSTALLATION OF THE EXHIBITION COLLECTIONS. 

The overcrowded condition of the public halls which began a num- 
of 3^ears ago precludes an}" extensive additions to the exhibition series, 
and this must continue until the completion of the new building 
recently authorized by Congress. Small objects can be given a place 
here and there, but any considerable ch'anges are rendered possil)le 
only through the withdrawal and transfer to storage of collections 
alread}^ on display. During the past 3'ear the principal progress made 
in this connection has had reference to improvements in the methods 
and details of installation. 

In the Department of Anthropology temporary accommodations 
have been furnished on the gallery of the north-west court for the 
important ethnological collections from the Philippine Islands dis- 
played at the Pan-American Exposition. The entire Eskimo collection 
has been gone over, and the large series of specimens secured ])y the 
Museum-Gates expedition has been arranged in the storage-cases of 
the Pueblo court. The labeling of the historical collections has been 
completed, and new case laliels have been prepared for the Divisions 
of Historic and Prehistoric Archeology and for the section of historic

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 37 

The work of completing- the exhibition series in several of the divi- 
sions of the Department of Biology, and of improving their appearance 
by changes in methods of installation, has been vigorously pushed. 
Progress in this regard was most noticeable in the halls devoted to 
mammals, marine invertebrates, insects, and fishes. About 200 case 
labels have been added to the exhibits of mammals, birds, reptiles, 
batrachians, insects, and the lower inv^ertebrates, and a series of case 
labels for the collection of comparative anatomy has been completed. 

The interiors of the wall-cases, in the galleries of the south hall 
containing Old World mammals, have been repainted in a color simi- 
lar to that used in the corresponding cases on the main floor, and this 
change has resulted in displaying the specimens to much better 
advantage. A similar change has also been made in regard to the 
floor cases in the gallery containing small mammals. Three new 
cases have been constructed against the south wall of this hall. One 
contains the North American weasels and related forms; the two 
others, the smaller South American mammals. The cases on the 
main floor of the south hall have been furnished with new fittings, so 
that they are now uniform in design and color. The labeling of the 
American small mammals has been greatly improved, while the labels 
for the Old World series have been revised and very largely replaced 
with new ones. 

Considerable improvement has been made in the appearance of the 
exhibition of marine invertebrates, which occupies the west hall in the 
Smithsonian building. The interior of all the wall-cases has been 
repainted in black, as furnishing a better background for the corals 
and sponges than the maroon formerly employed. The display of 
insects in the next adjoining hall or corridor has been enlarged by 
extensive additions to the systematic series of North American insects, 
which it is hoped to complete during the coming j^ear. 

The wall cases in the south-east range of the Museum building have 
been reconstructed, and the systematic collection of casts of North 
American fishes has been rearranged and installed to much better 
advantage than formerly. A number of casts of large and striking- 
species have been repaired and repainted. The labeling of the casts 
of reptiles and batrachians exhibited in floor cases in the same range 
has also been largely revised. 

The bird groups displayed in the main hall of the Smithsonian 
building, sixteen in number, have been partly renovated, and one of 
them, consisting of three fine specimens of the Argus pheasant, pre- 
sented to the Museum some years age by Dr. W. L. Abbott, has been 
entirely remounted, making it the most striking feature of the room. 

Many important changes have been made in the halls containing the 
geological collections. The exhibit of geographic ores in the south- 
west court has been carefull}" overhauled, the cases being thoroughly 



38

cleaned and the specimens rearranged. The nonmetallic minerals, 
exhibited in the galler}- of the same court, have been similarly worked 
over. The cases in the Avest- south range containing the stratig-raphic 
and historical collections have been reconstructed and the specimens 
rearranged. The collection of fossil plants has been partially rear- 
ranged, and new labels have replaced the temporary ones on the Pale- 
ozoic specimens. Labels have also been printed for the Triassic plants. 
To the exhibition of vertebrate pajeontology will soon be added a 
specimen of Claosaurus, the preparation of which has occupied nearly 
a 3^ear, and the mounted skeleton of a mastodon obtained at Church, 
Michigan, in 1901. 

VISITORS. 



There was, during the past year, a large increase in the number of 
visitors to the national collections. The total number of persons 
admitted to the Museum building was 815,307, against 173,888 for 
1902, an increase of 81 per cent; and to the Smithsonian building 
181,174, against 144,107 for the previous year, an increase of about 26 
per cent. 

The following tables show, respectively, the attendance during each 
month of the past year, and during each year beginning with 1881, 
when the Museum building was first opened to the public:

MEETINGS AND LECTURES. 

In accordance with the custom of previous years, certain scientific 
societies and other bodies were allowed the use of the lecture hall in 
the Museum building for the purpose of holding meetings and giving 
lectures, as follows: 

On September 26, 1902, the associates and friends of Maj. John 
Wesley Powell gathered here to commemorate the life and services of 
this distinguished public man, the founder and director of the Bureau 
of American Ethnology and for some time Director of the Geological 
Survey, whose lamented death occurred but three days before. 

From November 18 to 20 a national conference of the various Audo- 
bon societies of the United States was held, in conjunction with the 
American Ornithologists'' Union. 

On November 22 Prof. John Ritchie, jr., of the Yerkes Observa- 
tory, delivered under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution an 
interesting lecture on Recent Celestial Photography. 

On November 25 Dr. L. O. Howard, Entomologist of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture and Honorary Curator of Insects in the National 
Museum, lectured on the subject of Entomology before an audience 
composed largely of officers of the United States Army and Navy. 



40 KKrORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

On Doceuibor 27 several interesting talks, illustrated with lantern 
slides, were given by members of the Society for the Preservation of 
Wild Flowers. 

In the evening of January 1, 1903, an informal reception was ten- 
dered to the members of the American Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science, the American Society of Naturalists, and other 
affiliated societies, then in session in this city. 

During February and March a course of free Saturday afternoon 
lectures was given, under the auspices of. the Biological Society of 
Washington, as follows: February 14, An entomologist in China and 
Japan, by Mr. C. L. Marlatt; February 21, Ancient birds and their 
associates, by Mr. Frederic A. Lucas; February 28, Views of Liberia, 
by Prof. O. F. Cook; March 7, The making of new plants, by Mr. 
H. J. Webber; March 14, Three summers in Alaska, by Mr. Wilfred 
H. Osgood. 

On April 4 the lecture hall was used for the graduating exercises of 
the Naval Medical School, and on April 14 for those of the Array 
Medical School. 

The National Academy of Sciences held its annual meeting from 
April 21 to 23, 1903, the business meetings taking place in the offices 
of the assistant secretary, and the reading of papers in the lecture 
hall. 

CORRESPONDENCE. 

One of the most onerous duties which has devolved upon the 
Museum from the time of its establishment has been the furnishing 
of information in response to inquiries from the public at large upon 
all the various subjects within the scope of its several departments. 
The letters received containing such requests average several daily 
throughout the 3^ear, and are rarel}^ confined to a single subject, often 
relating to collections of greater or less size which are transmitted 
for identitication. Nearly 900 lots of specimens were received under 
these conditions during the past year. These communications also 
have reference, in many cases, to the building up and maintenance of 
collections, the construction of cases, the installation, labeling, and 
cataloguing of specimens, and other topics connected with museum 
administration. Every communication of this character, made in 
good faith, is responded to as promptly as possible, although the 
labor involved draws very heavily upon the time of both the scien- 
tific and the clerical staffs. 

A considerable proportion of the work of furnishing information 
is accomplished through the medium of Museum publications, of 
which more than 20,000 volumes and pamphlets were distributed 
during the year, besides the sendings to regular correspondents. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 41 

PUBLICATIONS. 

The publications of the Museum have consisted of an annual report, 
comprising the second part, or volume, of the annual report of the 
Smithsonian Institution; of a series of Proceedings for the ordinary 
technical papers, and of a -series of Bulletins for the longer technical 
papers or monographs. In 1894 the National Herbarium, which, for 
lack of space, had been held at the Department of Agriculture since 
1869, was returned to the National Museum, but the publication con- 
nected with it and entitled ''Contributions from the National Herba- 
rium" established in 1890, continued to be issued by the Department 
of Agriculture until this year, when Congress, upon the recommenda- 
tion of the Secretary of Agriculture, transferred its management to 
the National Museum, in accordance with the following item in the 
sundry civil act for 1908: 

For printing and publishing the contributions from the United States National 
Herbarium, the editions of which shall not be less than three thousand copies, 
including the preparation of necessary illustrations, proof reading, bibliographical 
work, and special editorial work, seven thousand dollars: Provided, That one-half of 
said copies shall be placed on sale at an advance of ten per centum over their cost. 

Under this provision volumes ii and vii previousl}^ published and 
entitled respective!}" Botany of Western Texas, by J. M. Coulter, and 
Systematic and Geographic Botany and Aboriginal Use of Plants, by 
Coulter, Rose, Cook, and Chesnut, the editions of which had become 
exhausted, were reprinted, and also the following new Contributions, 
parts 1, 2, and 3 of volume viii, consisting of Studies of Mexican 
and Central American Plants, by J. N. Rose; Economic Plants of 
Porto Rico, by O. F. Cook and G. N, Collins; and A Study of cer- 
tain Mexican and Guatemalan species of Polypodmm, by William R. 
Maxon. 

Of the Bulletins of the Museum the most important one issued was 
the second volume of Robert Ridgway's extensive monograph on the 
Birds of North and Middle America, covering the families Tanagrida? 
(Tanagers), Icterida? (Troupials), Cffrebidfe (Hone}" Creepers), and 
Mniotiltidse (Wood Warblers). The third volume, sent to the printer 
before the close of the fiscal year, treats of the Motacillida3 (Wagtails 
and Pipits); Hirundinid^e (Swallows), Vireonida? (Vireos), Ampelidite 
(Waxwings), Ptiliognatidse (Silken Chatterers), Dulida? (Palm Chat- 
terers), Laniidiv (Shrikes), Corvidaj (Crows and Jays), Parida? (Tit- 
mice), Sittida? (Nuthatches), Certhiida^ (Creepers), Troglodytidee 
(Wrens), Cinclidj^ (Dippers), Chamasiid^ (Wrentits), and Sylviidge 
(Kinglets, etc.). 

Another noteworthy bidletin was that by Dr. Harrison G. Dyar, of 
the Division of Insects, entitled A List of North American Lepidop- 
tera and Key to the Literature of this Order of Insects. It is num- 
bered 52, and comprises 723 octavo pages. 



42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

The interest manifested in tiie history and anthropolooy of our 
Philippine and other insular possessions rendered desirable the issu- 
ance of instructions for the guidance of collectors of objects in these 
branches, and to secure this purpose there has been printed an addi- 
tional part of Bulletin ?>9 (Part Q), prepared by Mr. W. H. Holmes 
and Prof. O. T. Mason, under the title Instructions to Collectors of 
Historical and Anthropological Specimens. 

The twenty-fourth volume of Proceedings, printed in bound form at 
the beginning of the fiscal year, contains thirty-four papers (1241 to 
1274, inclusive), all of which were issued in the form of separates dur- 
ing the preceding year. Fifteen of these papers were prepared b}^ 
members of the Museum staff, ten ])y Dr. David Starr Jordan and his 
assistants, being mainly descriptions of Japanese fishes represented in 
the Museum collections, and the remainder by other correspondents 
and collaborators of the Museum. 

Papers numbered from 1275 to 130.5, constituting volume xxv, 
and those numbered from 1306 to 1332 of volume xx^i, were also 
printed by June 30. It is expected that numbers 1333 to 1349 will 
soon be published, and that volumes xxv^ and xxvi will appear in 
bound form during the summer of 1903. 

There is a continuous demand for certain of the Museum publica- 
tions no longer in stock, but the means this year have permitted the 
reprinting of only the following: Mr. Robei't Ridgway's paper on the 
Humming Birds, from the Museum Report for 1900; Dr. Stejneger's 
paper on The Poisonous Snakes of North America, from the Report 
for 1893; Bulletin 37, entitled A Preliminary Catalogue of the Shell- 
bearing Marine Mollusks and Brachiopods of the Southeastern Coast 
of the United States, by Dr. William H. Dall; parts F, G, H, I, J, K 
of Bulletin 39, containing directions for collecting insects, shells, min- 
erals, rocks, specimens illustrating the aboriginal uses of plants and 
fossils, and the first volume of Bulletin 47, entitled Fishes of North 
and Middle America, l)y Doctors Jordan and Evermann. 

All the publications of the Museum are distributed by the Oflice of 
Correspondence and Documents, and it is estimated that during the 
year not less than 10,000 volumes and 35,000 separate papers were 
sent to libraries and individuals in the United States and foreign 
countries. 

Appendix IV of this report contains a list of the publications of the 
Museum, of the members of its staff, and also of outside colla])orators 
to the extent that the papers of the latter were based on Museum 
material. The number of authors is 90, and the total number of 
papers mentioned by title is 277.

LIBRARY. 

The assignment to the library of two of the galleries erected last 
year, one in the west-north, the other in the north-west range, has 
added a considerable amount of space, which has long been needed. 
This area has been fitted up with convenient stacks, permitting a gen- 
eral overhauling and a more systematic rearrangement of the books 
and pamphlets. During the latter part of the summer of 1902 the 
library was closed for a time to enable this work to be carried out. 
Its contents were classified and a large number of volumes belonging 
to the Smithsonian deposit were turned over to the Institution for 
transmission to the Library of Congress. 

The increase of the library has been mainly due to two very impor- 
tant gifts — the Hubbard and Schwarz and the Dall collections. The 
former, consisting of 300 books and 1,500 pamphlets, was brought 
together by Mr. H. G. Hubbard and Mr. E. A. Schwarz (Custodian 
of Coleoptera in the Museum), while carrying on their studies more 
or less conjointly, and forms an accessory to their large collection of 
insects, presented by them to the Museum several years ago. It is 
an entomological library, having reference mainly to the American 
Coleoptera. The contribution by Dr. "William H. Dall, Honorary 
Curator of Mollusks, comprises about 1,600 bound volumes and about 
2,000 pamphlets on the mollusca, a special library of great value, which 
has been accumulated by Dr. Dall during many years of research. It 
is accompanied by a card catalogue covering the literature of Con- 
chology, both recent and fossil, down to about 1860, though materially 
added to since then. 

The above collections and also the Goode library, purchased in 1898, 
have been provided with book-plates. 

The Museum library now possesses 19,161 bound volumes, and 
32,063 unbound pamphlets, periodicals, etc. The cataloguing done 
during the year comprised 916 books, 1,571 pamphlets, and 9,838 parts 
of periodicals, and 3,316 cards were added to the authors.' catalogue. 

The number of books, pamphlets and periodicals borrowed from the 
general library was 18,750, while the nuinber assigned to the sectional 
libraries was 4,833. There has been no change in the sectional libra- 
ries, which are as follows: .

PHOTOGRAPHY. 



Mr. T. W. Smillie, photographer of the Museum, reports that 1,689 
negatives, 3,367 silver prints, 307 phitinum prints, 49 lantern slides, 
and 1,016 blueprints have been made, and a large number of prints 
have been mounted. Under Mr. Smillie's direction much photographic 
work has also been done for the National Zoological Park and the 
Astrophysical Observatory, an assistant having been furnished by 
those bureaus for that purpose. 

Mr. Smillie has continued to act as chairman of the board of exam- 
iners in photography for the U. S. Civil Service Commission. 

COOPERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT. 

The Museum has received, as usual, important assistance from 
several of the Departments and Bureaus of the Government. Its rela- 
tions to the U. S. Geological Survey, the U. S. Fish Commission, the 
Biological Survey, and the Divisions of Entomology and Botany of the 
Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of American Ethnology, 
especially in regard to the transmission of collections, have been 
referred to elsewhere. Officers of the Army and Navy stationed in 
the new possessions have made valuable contributions, and representa- 
tives abroad of the Department of State have been instrumental in 
securing interesting material. The Departments of War and of the 
Navy have rendered generous help toward building up the collections 
of history and of the implements of war, having presented and 
deposited' during the year many objects of exceeding interest and 
value. The Army Medical Museum has cooperated most liberally in 
promoting the welfare of the recently established Division of Physical 
Anthropology, and special acknowledgments are due to the Quarter- 
master's Department of the Army for many courtesies in connection 
with the transportation of specimens and outfits to and from distant 
points. 

THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE EXPOSITION. 

An act providing for the celebration in the city of St. Louis, Mis- 
souri, of the one hundredth anniversary of the acquisition by the 
United States of the "Louisiana Territory," purchased from France, 



46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

was approved by the President of the United States on March 3, 1901. 
The sundry civil bill for the year ending June 30, 1903, carried an 
appropriation of $800,000 to enable the Executive Departments, and 
also the Smithsonian Institution and its bureaus, the U. S. Fish Com- 
mission, the Department of Labor, the Library of Congress, and the 
Bureau of the American Republics, to prepare suitable exhibits for the 
occasion. Out of this appropriation the sum of |110,000 was allotted 
to the Smithsonian Institution. Congress also appropriated $450,000 
for the construction of a building for the display of the Government 
collections. 

Dr. Frederick W. True, Head Curator of Biology, has been desig- 
nated by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to represent the 
Institution and its bureaus on the Government board. The exposition 
is expected to open on April 30 and to close on November 30, 1904. 
The preparation of the exhibits under the Smithsonian Institution was 
well under waj^ at the close of the year, and it is intended that the 
display made shall surpass any previous efforts by this branch of the 
Government. 

ORGANIZATION AND STAFF. 

The organization of the Museum comprises an administrative office 
and three scientific departments, as follows: Anthropology, with 9 
divisions and 4 sections; Biology, with 9 divisions and 13 sections, 
and Geology, with 3 divisions and 3 sections. This shows an increase 
of one division in Anthropology and of one section in Biology, the 
former relating* to physical anthropology, the latter to the lower alga?, 
which have been separated from the higher alga?. At the close of the 
year the scientific staff consisted of 3 head curators, 17 curators, 13 
assistant curators, 15 custodians, 12 aids, 4 associates, and 2 collabo- 
rators, a total of Qi) persons, only about one-half of whom were under 
salary from the National Museum, the others, mainly employees of 
other Government })ureaus, serving in a volunteer or honorary 
capacity. 

Mr. W. H. Holmes, Head Curator of the Department of Anthro- 
pology, having been appointed Chief of the Bureau of American Eth- 
nology, Prof. O. T. Mason, Curator of Ethnology, was on November 
15, 1902, placed in charge of the Department as acting head curator. 
Dr. A. Hrdlicka, whose researches on the physical characteristics of 
man are widely known, was on May 1, 1903, designated as assistant 
curator of the newly organized Division of Physical Anthropology. 
Dr. G. T. Moore, of the Department of Agriculture, was appointed 
custodian of the section of lower alg« on May 25, and at the same 
time the designation of Mr. W. T. Swingle was changed to custodian 
of the section of higher alga\ 

On December 31, 1902, Mr. Charles T. Simpson resigned his posi- 
tion as principal aid in the Division of Mollusks, being succeeded by

NECROLOGY. 

It is P-ratifying to note that during the past year no deaths have 
occurred in connection with the Museum staff, though among its 
friends there have been several losses, only two of which will be men- 
tioned here. ^ ■ ^ a 
The tirst was that of Maj. J. W. Powell, explorer, geologist, and 
anthropologist, for some time director of the U. S. Geological Survey, 
and the founder and director of the Bureau of American Ethnology 
An account of his life and work will be found in the hrst volume of 
the Smithsonian report for 1902, and it need only be recalled here^that 
in nearlv all the varied subjects of his personal studies and of his 
administrative oversight he was brought into close relations with the 
Museum, which is indebted to him for valuable collections, for wise 
suo-o-estions, and for a continued interest in its welfare. 

The second loss resulted from the death of Dr. James Gushing 
Merrill of the United States Army, which occurred in Washington 
on October '>7 1902. Doctor Merrill was born in Cambridge, Massa- 
chusetts, in 1853, and after attending school in Germany, he entered 
the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania, from which 
he was oraduated in 1871. About a year later he was appointed 
assistant%urgeon in the United States Army. While stationed at 
various military posts in the west and southwest, he devoted much 
time to the studv and collection of birds and eggs, generously giving 
away his collections, the National Museum being one of his favored 
beneficiaries. The accession records show that between 18 i 5 and 189b 
no less than 28 separate lots of specimens were received from him 
these including a large number of valuable skins, eggs, and nests of 
birds, besides mammals, fishes, and other natural history material. 
Doctor Merrill was elected an active member of the American Orni- 
thologists' Union at its first congress in 1883. He was a caretul and 
accurate observer of the habits of birds and mammals, and also con- 
tributed several important papers to scientific literature Two ot 
these were published in the Proceedings of the National Museum, 
their titles being as follows: Notes on the Ornithology of Southern 
Texas being a list of birds observed in the vicinity of tort Brmv-ii, 
Texas', from February, 1876, to June, 1878, and On the Habits ot the 
Rockv Mountain Goat.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY 
FOR THE YEAR 1902-3. 

By Otis T. Mason, 
Acting Head Curator. 

During- the year a number of chang^es have taken place in the 
personnel of the Department of Anthropology. When Mr. W. H. 
Holmes, the Head Curator, Avas made Chief of the Bureau of Ameri- 
can Ethnolog}", Prof. O. T. Mason, Curator of Ethnology, was desig- 
nated as Acting" Head Curator, Dr. Walter Hough, Assistant Curator, 
became Acting Curator of the Division of Ethnolog-y; and Mr. Paul 
Beckwith, Aid in the Division of History, was temporaril}^ assigned 
to the Assistant Curatorship of Ethnology. Owing to continued fail- 
ing health, Mrs. Fanny Dinsmore, stenographer, was compelled to 
resign, and in January Mr. W. E. Wilson was selected to till the 
place, in January- Mr. H. W.'Hendle}', who had assisted the Depart- 
ment in preparing its exhibit for the Pan-American Exposition, was 
appointed preparator in the Department, and in February Dr. Ales 
Hrdlicka was called to the position of assistant curator in the newlv 
established Division of Physical Anthropology. 

The work of the Department during the year has consisted largely 
in cataloguing, caring for, and installing the collections received, 
although the preparation of an exhiliit for the Louisiana Purchase 
Exposition has called for a large share of attention. This work is in 
charge of Mr. W, H. Holmes, who has undertaken to collect a series 
of exhibits illustrative of the highest artistic achievements of the 
American aborigines. 

Until the present year the Department has been devoted entirely to 
the culture side of the science of man, collections illustrating the 
phj'sical characters of the race, normal as well as abnormal, having 
been cared for in the Army Medical Museum; but a large part of this 
material has recently been transferred to the National Museum, and a 
laboratory for the stud}^ of this branch has been established under the 
curatorship of Dr. Ales Hrdlicka. Thus, for the first time in its his- 
tory, the National Museum embraces the whole subject of anthro- 
pology, physical and cultural, so far at least as this branch can be 
represented and illustrated by material objects. 

51 



52 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

GIFTS. 

Among the numerous gifts received in the Department during the 
year the following maj' be especially mentioned: 

1. Collection of ethnological material from Svnnatra and the Anda- 
man and Nicobar islands, presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Phila- 
delphia, who is one of the most generous benefactors of the Museum. 
These collections number some 500 specimens, and illustrate the native 
arts and industries of various primitive peoples of whom little is gen^- 
erall}^ known. Their value is greativ enhanced l)y the fact that they 
were obtained directly from the natives by a trai)ied collector, and are 
accompanied by all essential historical and descriptive data. 

2. A large collection made by the late Col. F. F. Hilder, of the Bureau 
of American Ethnology, in the Philippine Islands for the Pan-American 
Exposition, and presented to the National Museum by the Government 
board of the exposition. It includes upward of 1,500 specimens, and 
illustrates in an effective manner many of the native industries of the 
islands. 

3. A small series of ethnological specimens collected among the 
Tlinkit Indians of southeastern Alaska by Lieut. G. T. Emmons, 
U. S. Navy. These specimens have especial value, because of the 
careful record of tribe, manufacture, and use furnished by the collector. 

4. A series of stone implements, believed to be of paleolithic age, 
from the lateritic deposits ntnir Madras, India, presented by Mr. H. 
W. Seton-Karr, of London, England. 

5. Relics of General and Mrs. U. S. Grant, consisting in large part 
of objects presented to General and Mrs. Grant during their trip 
abroad, as follows: Cabinet presented to Mrs. Grant by the Empress

CAKE OF THE COLLECTIONS. 

The numerous accessions of the year, especially the large collections 
of Abbott, Hilder, and others, have made it necessary to contract the 
exhibition space in order to make room for the ever-growing study 
series and for laboratory purposes. The demands of the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition and of the newly -established Division of Physical 
Anthropology for space have increased the embarrassment. The con- 
gestion has been somewhat relieved by fitting up the galleries over 
the south-west and west-north ranges, but overcrowding is still every- 
\\ here apparent. 

The usual watchfulness over the ethnological collections to protect 
them from insects and rust has been exercised, and Mr. Joseph Palmer 
has devoted a large part of his time to the work of overhauling, reno- 
vating and poisoning. 

Until additional exhibition space is provided the installation of new 
material is practically at an end, excepting where exhibits that have 
been long before the public are replaced by others of greater interest. 



KEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 



57 



The work of labeling the exhibits has been carried forward with all 
possible energy during the year, and great advance has been made 
over previous years, especially in the labeling of the larger units, such 
as halls, alcoves, groups of exhibits, and cases. 

In the Division of Ethnology the Philippine collection has been 
temporarily arranged in cases in the north-west court gallery; the col- 
lections obtained through the Museum-Gates expedition in Arizona 
during the previous year Have been placed in good order in the storage 
series of the Pueblo "^court, and Mr. Thomas W. Sweeny has classified 
and rearranged the large Eskimo study collection in the storage bases of 
the north-west range. ^Mr. Joseph Palmer and Mr. Charles Luscombe 
have been engaged in mending, modeling, making facsimilies of 
specimens, and allied lal^oratory work. 

During the entire fiscal year the hall of prehistoric archeology has 
been doused on account of repairs, but the work of cataloguing and 
caring for the collections has gone on without interruption under the 
supervision of Mr. E. P. Upham. 

A large collection of Washington relics, transferred to the Museum 
from the Patent Office, has been installed in the hall of American history 
in connection with cognate exhibits, under the supervision of Mr. 
A. H. Clark and Mr. Paul Beckwith. The exhibition series in this 
division is all labeled^ and the crowded condition of the study series 
has been greatly relieved by removing portions of it to the new gal- 
leries. It has long been felt that a suitable catalogue of the historical 
collections should be prepared for publication by the Museum, and 
during the year this work was initiated by the employment of Miss 
Elizabeth Bryant Johnston, who has completed a descriptive catalogue 
of the personal relics of George Washington. 

In the Division of Physical Anthropology there is as yet no exhibition 
series, the time of the new curator. Doctor Hrdlicka, having been 
devoted to organizing the division and fitting up a laboratory of 
anthropometry. 

In the sections of historic religious ceremonials and classical arche- 
ology, few changes have been made save that the labeling has been 
carried practically to completion. 

In the Division of Medicine the curator has been engaged in prepar- 
ing a card catalogue of the collections. Each specimen, whether on exhi- 
bition, in the study series or in storage, has an individual card, giving 
name, nmnber. collector, mode of acquisition, etc. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

During the year a very limited amount of field work has been under- 
taken by members of the Department\s stafl'. Mr. W. H. Holmes 
continued his explorations in archeology on behalf of the Bureau of 
Ethnology. Under his direction numerous mound relics and fossd 



58 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

bones of ancient mammals were obtained near Kimmswick, Missouri, 
by Mr. Gerard Fowke. and extensive collections were made in ancient 
flint quarries and worksliops in Carter County, Kentucky, and in Har- 
rison County, Indiana, illustrating all the phases of flint working. 

Mr. Holmes, aided by Mr. Fowke, made investigations in a hematite 
mine at Leslie, Missouri, obtaining the collections referred to on a 
preceding page. 

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, of the Bureau of Ethnology, concluded 
important explorations in the islands of Santo Domingo and Porto 
Rico. It has long been known that the latter island was in some way 
a sacred retreat of the ancient inhalntants of the Antilles. Many 
years ago a large collection of objects of stone was presented to the 
Museum by George Latimer, and Doctor Fewkes was successful in 
supplementing this with valuable material, adding many new forms. 
In addition to his archeological explorations. Doctor Fewkes made 
careful studies of the natives, including the whites, blacks, and rem- 
nants of ancient aborigines. 

Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, has continued his explorations 
in the northern portion of the island of Sumatra and the small islands 
adjoining, and the mainland in the Straits Settlements, contributing 
the valuable collections already described. 

RESEARCHES. 

One of the chief aims of the Department of Anthropology has always 
been to favor and encourage research, not only on the part of members 
of the staff but of investigators elsewhere. Much attention has been 
paid during the year to correspondence on every topic connected with 
anthropology, and to obtain, if possible, for the friends of the Institu- 
tion information that is not within their reach. Literature published 
by the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum on anthropo- 
logical subjects has been freely distributed. This remark applies 
equally to the ethnology of America, the Philippine Islands, and inci- 
dentally to other parts of the world. The curators have been almost 
daily importuned for information concerning the nature and use of 
archeological relics. 

A collection of Indian shields was sent to Mr. James Mooney, Mount 
Scott, Oklahoma, for study in the held. 

In the Division of History questions arise constantly as to the mean- 
ing of inscriptions and the readings on coins and medals. Already, in 
the new Division of Ph^^sical Anthropology a beginning has been 
made in supplying special instructions to observers and students. In 
the Division of Ceramics errors with reference to the age and sources 
of pottery are corrected. With the public, great interest is mani- 
fested in the "Synoptic Series" of the Museum, and teachers are con- 
stantly receiving instructions with reference to the development of

STORAGE. 

Numerous specimens have been stored in buildingfs outside of the 
Museum, but it has been the policy of the Department not to send out 
of the building- any specimens which can not be replaced in case of loss. 
As a result of this policy, the crowding of the halls has become more 
embarrassing. Even the offices of the curators are l)eing used as 
receptacles of valued material for which there is no present place of 
storage. 

Since the death of Dr. Thomas Wilson, Curator of the Division of 
Prehistoric Archeolog}' , in 1902, Mr. Holmes has given especial atten- 
tion to the interests of this division and has been faithfully assisted 
by Mr. E. P. Upham. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY 
FOR THE YEAR 1902-3. 

By Frederick W. True, 
Head Curator. 

The principal features of the year covered by tliis report were the 
improvement of the installation of the exhibition series, brought 
about largely b}^ placing the supervision of the work in the hands of 
a single officer, and the enlargement of the quarters for the National 
Herbarium, In the majority of classes the number of specimens 
added to the collections was less than last 3^ear; but in scientific value 
there was no appreciable decline. The number of zoological speci- 
mens added was not less than 70,000, of which 9,000 were vertebrates. 
About 35,000 botanical specimens were also received. Some important 
improvements were made in the installation of the great zoological 
study series, but the need of more space and better facilities were 
keenl}^ felt. Preparations for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. 
Louis, 1904, were actively begun, and were in an advanced condition 
at the close of the ^^ear. 

EXHIBITION COLLECTIONS. 

With the consent of the Assistant Secretary, Mr. F. A. Lucas, 
Curator of the Division of Comparative Anatom\', was placed in tem- 
porary charge of all exhibition work of the Department, November 
1, 1902, and all the taxidermists and other natural history preparators 
were directed to report to him. By this change the work has l^een 
much better coordinated than hitherto, and the results obtained dur- 
ing the year have been very satisfactory. The curators of the several 
divisions are still called upon to select specimens for the exhibition 
series, to furnish technical information for labels, or for the use of the 
preparators, etc. , but they are not expected to regularh^ supervise the 
work of the preparators or to install collections in the exhibition 
cases. There has been a growing recognition among the curators of 
natural history museums of the fact that the needs of the general pub- 
lic and of the special student and investigator are quite diverse, and 
that endeavors to combine in one series collections of interest to both 
are little better than a waste of time. The general public and the gen- 
eral student are only confused by a nuiltiplicity of specimens repre- 
senting small variations of one species, or illustrating small steps in a 

61 



52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

single vital process, while the special student and investigator never 
has too many specimens, and can seldom make much progress with 

scant material. 

The principal improvements during the year were in the halls 
devoted to mammals, marine invertebrates, insects, and lishes. The 
interior of the wall-cases of the South Hall gallery, containing Old 
World mammals, was repainted to correspond in color with the cases 
on the main floor and to set off the specimens properly, the color of 
the unpainted l)urlap background having proved too dull. At the 
same time the floor cases on the gallery containing the small mammals 
were refitted to correspond with those below. The result has been 
a great improvement in the general appearance of the cases and visi- 
bility of the collections. The very attractive group of African horse- 
tailed monkeys, Colohus caudatus, prepared some time ago with 
specimens presented ))y Dr. W. L. Abbott, was placed in a new 
case especially adapted for properly displaying it. The specimens 
were cleaned and the accessories renovated by the chief taxidermist. 
On the main floor, devoted to American mammals, the south wall-cases 
mentioned in last year's report were finished and filled with South 
American mammals, which are now installed in a satisfactory manner. 
No room has as yet been found, however, for such large forms as the 
tapir, pampas deer, etc. The majority of the floor-cases were furnished 
with new fittings, uniform in design and color. The group of Rocky 
Mountain sheep made originally for the World's Columbian Exposi- 
tion, 1893, was taken from storage and erected at the northwest cor- 
ner of the hall. The artificial rock- work was cut down and partially 
remodeled and the specimens renovated by the chief taxidermist. 
This completes the representation by groups of the principal large 
ruminants of North America, except that space has not been found for 
tbe White Goat group. The intention is to let this take the place of 
one of the two caribou groups. Numerous small mammals were 
added to the general North American series. A number of large 
mammals were mounted during the 3'ear for the St. Louis Exposition, 
but will not be displayed in Washington until the close of the exposi- 
tion. New uniform printed labels for the entire American series of 
small mammals, revised and brought up to date as regards nomencla- 
ture, etc., were printed and placed with the specimens during the 
year. The labels for the Old World series were also revised, and, 
where necessarj^, new ones were prepared, printed, and put on the 
specimens. The entire mammal exhibit, therefore, with a few excep- 
tions in some groups, is now thoroughly and satisfactorily labeled. 
The Indian rhinoceros, which had been on exhibition for man}^ years, 
was withdrawn, as it had become unsightly through the cracking of 
the skin and could not be repaired satisfactorily. 

In the hall in the Smithsonian building devoted to the lower inverte- 
brates the interiors of all the wall-cases were repainted. As these 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 63 

cases, for the most part, contain corals, it was decided to use black for 
the backg^roiind as best suited to bring- the specimens into relief. The 
corals and sponges were rearranged and some specimens added to the 
general North American series. 

In the insect hall the exhibit of North American species was extended 
by the addition of representatives of the orders Lepidoptera, Euplex- 
optera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera, and Diptera. 

Aftef the collection of fishes exhibited at the Pan-American Expo- 
sition, Buffalo, 1901, was returned, a reclassification of all the casts 
was made, the series being divided into two sections — marine fishes 
and fresh-water fishes. The cases standing against the walls were 
reconstructed and furnished with large glass and paneled bases, so as 
to present a uniform appearance around the hall. A large shark and 
several other fishes of ver}' large size were placed on top of the cases 
and provided with new framed labels. The descriptive labels used at 
Buffalo were mounted on standards of uniform design and placed 
beside the species to which they refer. The series now exhibited, aside 
from the small representation of deep-sea fishes, is entirely North 
American. While it is desired to exhibit various series from other 
parts of the world, there is not suflicient room for this purpose in the 
present quarters. For this reason the South American fishes preserved 
in formalin have been temporarilj^ withdrawn. These preparations 
were in quite good condition when last examined, but they are not 
entirely satisfactory for exhibition on account of the bleaching of the 
colors, dullness of the eyes, etc. Experiments were made during the 
year in casting from formalin specimens. The results were quite satis- 
factory, and it is believed that a series of casts made in this way and 
painted might prove best for a permanent exhibit. A number of 
molds of fishes and some casts of large fishes, which have been used by 
the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries in connection with 
various expositions, were transferred to the Museum by the Commis- 
sioner. Several of these casts were repaired and placed on exhibition, 
as already mentioned. 

All the labels for the reptiles and batrachians were reprinted in the 
same style as the mammal labels, the object being to have all the faunal 
labels uniform as regards matter and general appearance. Instead of 
the particular locality in which a specimen exhibited was obtained, 
these labels contain a brief statement of the geographical range of the 
species represented, together of course with the common and scientific 
names, the catalogue number of the specimen, and in the case of gifts, 
the name of the donors. Specimens received from Government sur- 
vevs are labeled with the names of the organizations which transmitted 
them. 

Few changes of importance were made in connection with the 
exhibits of birds and mollusks, but copy was prepared for new labels 
for the entire North American series of birds. The labels had not 



64 EEPORT OK NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

been printed when the year closed. The groups of birds, 16 in num- 
ber, which were originally made for various expositions, were over- 
hauled, and the cases made dust tight as far as possible and provided 
with new framed labels. Under present conditions it is not deemed 
expedient to build new cases for these groups. The beautiful speci- 
mens of the Argus pheasant presented some time ago by Dr. W. L. 
Abbott, were brought together by the taxidermists in the form of a 
group, with ground-work, and j^laced in a new case. This group is one 
of the most attractive and interesting objects in the entire exhibition 
series. The baseboards of all the large alcove-cases were repainted. 

In order to find room for the enlargement of the National Herba- 
rium it became necessary to abandon the limited space on the East 
Hall gallery previousl}^ allotted for botanical exhibits. This was done 
most reluctantlv, but in view of the necessities of the case it was 
deemed unavoidable. With this change the Museum definitely aban- 
doned making botanical exhibits for the present, but with the hope 
that after the new building provided for by Congress is erected, abun- 
dant room will be found for such collections. 

During the year each of the exhibition halls was provided with a 
large sign, calling attention in a few words to its contents, as for 
example, "Lower Invertebrates," "American Mammals," etc. In 
addition, uniform framed case labels, about 200 in number, were 
provided for all the cases containing mammals, birds, reptiles, 
batrachians, insects, and lower invertebrates. The series of case 
labels for the exhibit of comparative anatomy was also completed. 

A considerable number of requests we^-e received during the year 
for photographs of various groups and single objects in the exhibi- 
tion series, chiefiy for purposes of publication. The Bureau of 
Engraving and Printing made photographs and sketches of the 
mounted bison as a basis for the figure of that animal placed on 
the new ten-dollar bill. An American eagle was mounted in a special 
attitude for a similar purpose. Prof. M. M. Metcalf, of the Woman's 
College of Baltimore, made a number of photographs of skeletons 
and other objects for a forthcoming work on evolution. Dr. D. G. 
Elliot, of the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago, obtained photo- 
graphs of certain whale skulls for a work on the mammals of Central 
America. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

In the spring of 1903, Mr. F. A. Lucas, accompanied by Messrs. 
William Palmer and J. W. Scollick, visited one of the stations of the 
Cabot Steam Whaling Company, Newfoundland, to obtain a large whale 
for the St. Louis Exposition. Toward the close of the fiscal year Mr. 
Lucas reported that the skeleton and casts of the exterior of a sulphur- 
bottom whale, about 75 feet long, had been obtained. By invitation 



REPOKT OF ASSISTANT SECEETAKY. 65 

of the Geographical Society of Baltimore, Messrs. B. A. Bean and 
J. H. Riley accompanied the expedition of the society to the Bahamas 
to collect aquatic and land vertebrates. By invitation of Dr. L. O. 
Howard, Dr. H. G. Dyar, accompanied by Mr. R. B. Currie, of the 
National Museum, and Mr. A. N. Caudell, of the Department of Agri- 
culture, made an expedition to British Columbia to collect insects, and 
especiall}^ mosquitoes, under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution. 
Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., spent a few weeks in collecting small mammals 
in the vicinit}^ of Hampton, Virginia. Messrs. Richmond, Ashmead, 
Bartsch, and Currie spent some days in Philadelphia in the study of 
the zoological collections of the Academy of Sciences, and Dr. Rose 
visited the Museum of the New York Botanical Garden. Mr. W. R. 
Maxon spent two months in Jamaica (April and May, 1903), where 
he made a very large collection of plants, and especially of ferns. 
He also obtained some line examples of the large white ant nests found 
in the island. 

ACCESSIONS. 

The accessions of the year, considered as separate lots of varying 
sizes received from different sources, were considerably less than last 
year, except in. the Division of Plants and the Section of Birds' Eggs. 
The accessions of plants were greater in number than in any year since 
1895, being in all 575, but the number of specimens comprised in them 
was less than in the previous year, viz, about 53,500 specimens ii\ 
1902, and about 35,000 in 1903. The accessions of birds' eggs, on the 
contrary, aggregated more specimens than in 1902. The whole num- 
ber of zoological specimens received during the 3"ear was, as already 
stated, about 70,000; of plants about 35,000 specimens. A notable and 
most important feature of the accessions was an increase in the num- 
ber of types and cotypes presented, wdiich comprise insects, fishes, 
birds, and crustaceans. Among the largest zoological accessions 
received w^ere a collection of" al)out 19,000 gall wasps and parasites 
made in Canada, and transmitted by the U. S. Department of Agricul- 
ture; about 4,000 Costa Rican insects, purchased from Mr. P. Schild, 
of Hamburg, Germany; a))out 2,000 Chilean insects, presented by 
Mr. E. C. Reed, of Concepcion; a collection of about 2,000 tish, birds' 
eggs, mollusks, and other marine invertebrates from the Hawaiian 
Islands, transmitted by the U. S. Fish Commission; a collection com- 
prising about 1,500 birds' eggs, insects and mammals from Paraguay; 
the East Indian collections of Dr. Abbott, consisting of more than 
1,200 mammals, birds, reptiles, etc. Considering the character of Dr. 
Abbott's collections, which contain hundreds of mammals, they should 
perhaps have been mentioned first, as it is obviousl}^ more difficult to 
assemble large numbers of these animals than of any other class. The 
largest collection of plants received during the year was one made by 

NAT MUS 1903 5 



06 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, in the Yellowstone National Park. It 
comprises about 5,:^00 specimens, and was very generously donated to 
the Museum by the collector. This is probably the largest scientific 
collection of plants ever made in the park. Next in size was the col- 
lection made by Mr. William R. Maxon, of the Museum staff, in 
Jamaica, comprising about 2,000 specimens, chiefly ferns. 

It is a pleasure to record the continued activity of Dr. W. L. 
Abbott in the exploration of the East Indies. The collections received 
during the year were chiefly from the coast and islands of northwest- 
ern Sumatra, as far south as Siboga, and from theRiou Peninsula, just 
south of Singapore. The}^ comprise, as already mentioned, mammals, 
birds, reptiles, and batrachians, fishes, and insects. The Sumatran 
mammals, about 500 in number, were studied by Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., 
who discovered among them a new ape {Macacns fuscus), four new 
species of mouse deer (genus Tragulus), nine new squirrels, a new genus 
and five new species of mice, and a new porcupine {Tricky s macrotis). 
The birds from the same region also comprised about 500 specimens, 
representing 152 species, of which 19 were found by Dr. C. W. Rich- 
mond to be new to science. The collections from Pahang and the 
Riou Archipelago have already yielded four new species of mouse 
deer, and are probably as important as the preceding one for the light 
they will throw on the distribution of Malayan species. The National 
Museum has received from Dr. Abbott, since the beginning of his 
explorations in the East Indies, no less than 2,500 mammals, 3,1)00 
birds, 800 reptiles and batrachians, besides very numerous specimens 
of other classes. 

In 1902 the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Alhatross was sent to 
the Hawaiian Islands for the purpose of continuing the investigation 
of the fisheries. In the course of this work large collections were 
made in various branches of natural history and transmitted to the 
Museum. Those received during the year covered by this report were 
a valuable collection of birds' eggs, about 1,500 marine moUusks in 
alcohol, many new to the Government collections, and about 100 species 
apparently undescribed; a collection of corals, and a second lot of 
crustaceans. The Commission also transmitted a collection of 85 birds, 
mainly from Laysan Island, north of Hawaii, including the type of a 
tern, ProceJsterma saxatilis Fisher. From the Alhatnm Samoan Expe- 
dition of 1902 were received corals and crustaceans in addition to the 
specimens transmitted last year. The Commission also furnished 
about 800 specimens of the commoner species of marine invertebrates 
of Woods Hole, Massachusetts, for distribution to educational estab- 
lishments, together with a small collection of fishes from the same 
locality, a specimen of the Tile fish {LopholdtUus), from 70 miles ofl' 
Nomans Land, the type and cotype of a new species of white-fish 
{Coregonus stanleyi), from Aroostook County, Maine, and a cotype of 
a new fish {Hadropterus evermanni), from Tippecanoe Lake, Indiana. 



EEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 67 

Prof. T. I). A. Cockerell, of East Las Vegas, New Mexico, pre- 
sented eight lots of insects of different orders, containing many new 
species, and including types and cotypes of species described by him; 
also three lots of amphipod crustaceans and leeches, the former rep- 
resenting a new form foimd in a warm spring. 

An interesting collection of reptiles and batrachians from northern 
Mexico and North Carolina was purchased from Brim ley Brothers, 
Raleigh, North Carolina. It contained a series of a salamander 
{DesnwgndthuH qaadrlniaGidata)^ which had not been recognized since 
Holbrook's time. From the same source was obtained a small collec- 
tion of North Carolina fishes, one of which was found to be unde- 
scribed and was named Notropis hrlmleyi by Mr. B. A. Bean; also 
eight specimens of the very rare skipper, Pamphlla Carolina Skinner. 

Among the most important purchases of the year were the zoological 
collections made by Mr. William Foster in the vicinity of Sapucay, 
a small town near Ascuncion, Paraguay. They comprise about 800 
insects, 600 birds' eggs, and 350 small mammals. The mammals were 
Drincipally bats. The specimens were all carefully prepared and 
labeled and filled important gaps in the Government collections. 

Mammals. — In addition to Dr. Abbott's East Indian mammals and 
uhose from Paraguay just mentioned, the Museum received several 
other accessions which deserve mention. Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. 
Army, added to his generous donations of previous years two collec- 
tions of small mammals, one from the Yellowstone Park, comprising 
about 300 specimens, and the other from Fort Snelling, Minnesota, 
comprising about 200 specimens. The collections of European small 
mammals, already very rich, was increased by two collections, one 
from Switzerland and one from Norway. An excellent series of 
Japanese rodents and bats, purchased during the year, represents the 
first well-prepared collection of mammals received by the Museum 
from that country. Mr. B. S. Rairden, United States Consul at 
Batavia, Java, obtained for the Museum two specimens of a Javan 
mouse-deer, which proved to be an undescribed species of much inter- 
est, and was named Tragtdus focalinus by Mr. G. S. Miller, jr. A 
somewhat imperfect but very valuable skeleton of a peculiar porpoise 
from the Hawaiian Islands was presented b}^ Prof. Charles H. Gilbert 
of the Stanford Universit3^ It represents the species Pseudorca cras- 
sldens, a form intermediate between the killers and blackfish, which 
has not been obtained hitherto from the vicinity of the Hawaiian 
Islands. 

Birds.— My. Homer Davenport, of Morris Plains, New Jersey, pre- 
sented to the Museum during the year 22 large and valuable birds 
from his extensive aviary, among which were an Australian Goose, a 
Javan Jungle-fowl, a Black-winged Peacock, Pavonigripennis., regarded 
by some zoologists as a distinct species, and several beautiful pheas- 
ants, including Diard's Fire-back Pheasant, Lopkura diardi. From 



(>8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Mr. A. Boucard were purchased two rare birds of paradise, Paradisea 
gxulielmi and Bhijndomis ijuiUdmi-IIL A pair of rare flio-htless 
cormonints from the Galapagos Islands, and about 300 birds from 
this group and the islands ofi' the west coast of Mexico, including a 
series of Wei<omiimis trifasciatus, were also purchased. The Bishop 
Museum, Honolulu, presented a collection of the birds of Guam, com- 
posing about 44 specimens, representing species not previously con- 
tained in the Government collection. Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, 
presented about 50 desirable Honduras birds, and about 300 specimens 
from Chiri({ui, Costa Rica, were obtained from him in exchange. The 
I>iological Survey, U. S. Department of Agriculture, transmitted a 
line collection of birds' eggs from diii'erent parts of North America. 

Reptiles and, hat rack lans. — Messrs. Brimley and Sherman presented 
a fine series of salamanders from North Carolina, and Mr. H J. Brown 
a number of rare reptiles from southern Florida. In a siuall collec- 
tion from Cocos Island, Costa Rica, presented by Prof. P. Biolley, 
were five specimens of a new gecko, described by Doctor Stejneger 
under the name of SplixTodactylus jMcificxLS. 

Fishes. — The accessions of fishes w^ere remarkable on account of the 
number of type specimens and cotypes included among them. An 
especially important accession consisted of 42 types of species of 
Hawaiian fishes, collected in 1889 and described l)y Dr. O. P. Jenkins, 
of Stanford University. These were donated to the Museum by Doc- 
tor Jenkins, and are a continuation of the series presented in 1001. A 
collection of Japanese fishes, comprising- 75 species, of which 3 were 
represented b}^ t3^pes and 16 by cot3'pes, was presented by Stanford 
University. The}'^ were collected by President D. S. Jordan, by the 
University of Tokyo, and by K. Otaki. Included with them were the 
t^'pes of Bryostemvia tarsodes and JJryolophus lysi/mcs, two species 
obtained near Unalaska Island by the Alhat^'oss. The types of the Jap- 
anese species Draconetta xenlca and Cyttojjsis itea were also received 
during the year. 

Among single specimens of interest should be mentioned a very large 
pipe-fish, Fistularla taljaccaria., 4i feet long, from Campeche Bank, 
Mexico, presented by E. E. Saunders & Co. Dr. S. Wier Mitchell 
presented a large salmon weighing 47 pounds, taken by him at Cas- 
capedia, Quel)ec. Casts of this fine fish and of the pipe-fish were made 
for the exhi))ition series. A deep-sea pelican-fish, genus Gastrostomus., 
was received during the year from the U. S. S. Nero. It was obtained 
during the survey for the trans-Pacific cable at a depth of between 
2,000 and 3,000 fathoms. Mr. Louis Mobray, of Bermuda, obtained 
a living specimen of the large Conger eel, Channomur»na vlttata, and 
sent it to the New York Aquarium. Upon its death, which occurred 
in a few months, it was sent to the Museum by the director of the 
aquarium, at the suggestion of Prof. C. L. Bristol. Dr. J. C. Thomp- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69 

son, IT. S. Na\\y, presented a small l)ut interesting collection of fishes 
from the Dry Tortiig-as, Florida. The accessions from the U. S. 
Fish Commission and from JVIr. H. H. Brimley have been alread}' 
mentioned. (See pp. 65 and 67.) 

Jfollusks. — In addition to the collections of the U. 8. Fish Commis- 
sion, already referred to, mention should be made of the donations of 
two constant contributors to the Museum, Mrs. T. S. Oldroyd and 
Rev. H. Loomis. Mrs. Oldroyd presented about 150 marine shells 
from California in exceptionally line condition, and Mr. Loomis's 
specimens of about 50 species from Japan and the Loochoo Islands 
included man}^ desiderata. California shells were also presented by 
Mr. F. A. Woodworth, of San Francisco, and Hawaiian land shells 
by Mr. H. W. Henshaw, of Hilo, Hawaii. A second consignment of 
land and fresh-water shells from central Asia was received from the 
Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg-, Kussia. Among single 
specimens of special value should be mentioned a tine Voluta mamilla^ 
a large and very rare shell from Tasmania. A collection of Australian 
land and fresh-water shells, comprising species not previously repre- 
sented in the Museum, was purchased. 

Insects. — The three largest accessions of insects — the U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture collection from Canada (18,947 specimens), the 
Costa Rican collection purchased of P. Schild (4,000 specimens), and 
the collection from Chili presented by Mr. E. C. Reed (2,021 speci- 
mens) — have already been mentioned. Man}^ of the remaining acces- 
sions, 254 in number, contain material of great interest and value, but 
it is obviously impossible to refer in detail to more than a few of 
them in this report. (For a complete list see Appendix II.) One 
of the most important was a collection of African butterflies received 
in exchange from the Royal Natural History Museum, Stockholm, 
which included examples of many species described by Doctor Auri- 
villius. Another important exchange was efl^'ected with the American 
Entomological Society, through which the Museum received examples 
of about 100 species of Mexican and Central American Hymenoptera, 
many of them cotypes of species descri])ed by Mr. Cresson. Prof. 
Charles Robertson, of Carlenville, Illinois, presented cotypes of 19 
species of Hymenoptera described ])y him. A similar collection of 
Coleoptera, presented by Prof. H. C. Fall, of Pasadena, California, 
contained 34 cotj^pes of his species. A collection of mites, containing 
types and cot3^pes, was presented by Prof. Ro])ert H. Wolcott, of the 
University of Nebraska. 

L&icer invertebrates. — The accessions of lower invertebrates, like 
those of fishes, are noteworthy on account of the number of types and 
cotypes included among them. The collections transmitted by the 
U. S. Fish Commission have been alread3" mentioned. From the 
Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France, was received a valuable 



70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

exchange comprising- a))out 50 species of fresh-water crabs, nearly all 
of which were previously unrepresented in the Government collection. 
Many of the specimeny were cotypes. The Stanford University pre- 
.sented a series of desirable specimens of Japanese crustaceans col- 
lected by Doctor Jordan and Mr. J. O. Snyder in 1900. It included 
several species previously iindescribed. A small but interesting col- 
lection of crustaceans from the Maldive Islands, including several 
cotypes, was received in exchange from the Museum of Comparative 
Zoology. They were collected by Doctor Agassiz and party in 1901-2. 
Dr. S. J. Holmes, of the University of Michigan, presented 11 lots of 
New England amphipod crustaceans, among which were types of sev- 
eral species. Two smaller lots, with representations of other orders 
of crustaceans from Costa Kica and Cocos Island, were presented by 
the Museo Nacional, of San Jose, Costa Rica. Among them were 
types of species of amphipods described l)}^ T. R. R. Stebbings. Four 
lots of isopod crustaceans, including types, were presented by the 
Harriman Alaskan expedition. Dr. C. H. Eigenmann, of the Indiana 
State University, presented specimens of 4 species of crustaceans from 
Cuba, including types of 3 species. 

A valuable collection of European parasites, comprising trematodes, 
cestodes, and nematodes, was received by the Bureau of Animal 
Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture, and catalogued in the 
section of helminthological collections. National Museum. The Mu- 
seum received a collection of parasites of fishes from Prof. Edwin 
Linton, of Washington, Pennsylvania. The study collection of para- 
sites is considered the finest scientific collection of the kind now existing 
in the United States. 

Plants. — The total number of accessions to the National Herbarium 
during the year was 595, a number which has not been reached for the 
last eight years. Of this number, 120 accessions, comprising about 
5,000 specimens, were received through the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture. 

Doctor Mearns's large collection from the Yellowstone National 
Park, which constituted the most extensive accession of the year, has 
already been mentioned. Probably next in interest is the collection 
made by Mr. W. R. Maxon, of the Museum staff, in Jamaica, which 
comprised about 2,000 specimens, chiefly ferns. Two important col- 
lections from the Philippine Islands, comprising about 1,400 specimens, 
were received in exchange from the Insular Bureau of Agriculture, 
Manila. These are believed to be the first collections from the islands 
made by American botanists. Another collection of Philippine plants, 
comprising about 1,000 specimens, was received from the Royal Botani- 
cal Gardens, Kew, England, in continuation of an exchange with that 
institution. Capt. J. Donnell Smith has continued his valuable dona- 
tions of West Indian and Central American plants. He presented 
during the year a sixth series, consisting of 375 specimens. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY, 71 

Purchases of plants to the amount of $1,000 were made during- tlie 
3"ear. The most important items were continuations of the California 
collections of Mr. A. A. Heller (1,055 specimens) and the Nevada col- 
lection of Prof. C. F. Baker (481 specimens). Other purchases were 
as follows: Plants in the United States (3,223 specimens), viz, Maine 
(639), California and Arizona (989), Georgia (497), Ohio (405), Missis- 
sippi (693); plants from Central and South America, viz, Mexico (296), 
Costa Rica (452), Venezuela (256). 

Of the plants transmitted by the U. S. Department of Agriculture 
during the 3"ear, the most important are the collections of Messrs. 
F. A. Walpole and W. W. Gorman from Alaska (1,323 specimens) and 
those of Messrs. F. V. Coville, V. K. Chesnut, David Griffiths, and 
others, from Washington, Oregon, and California (1,368 specimens). 

WORK ON THE STUDY SERIES. 

In the Division of Mammals about 3,000 skulls of small species were 
cleaned during the .year, two-thirds of which were those belonging to 
specimens in the collection of the Biological Survey, U. S. Department 
of Agriculture. All the large skulls of the regular Museum series, 
with the exception of about 100, have been cleaned, but about 1,500 
small skulls still need cleaning. Little could be done toward continu- 
ing the rearrangement of the skins of small species for lack of room 
and cases, but the work of making ov^er skins which were deteriorating 
on account of faulty preparation progressed satisfactoril}', about 400 
skins having been renovated during- the year. It is a cause of much 
regret that nothing could be done toward improving the condition of 
the large skins in vats and in the cases of the upper .laborator}-, many 
of which are in imminent danger of destruction. There are known to 
be from 1,000 to 1,500 of the size of a wolf and upward which need 
attention. Some of these are large antelopes and other important 
mammals which are now difficult to obtain. The collection of mam- 
mals in alcohol was thoroughly overhauled, and is in an excellent con- 
dition as regards both preservation and arrangement. The large 
storage case behind the wall case in the South Hall, used for the storage 
of mammal skulls, was roofed over to exclude dust, and provided with 
shelving. It is intended to fit the alcoves with standard racks and 
drawers next year for the better installation of the valuable series of 
skulls kept there. 

The laboratories of the Division of Birds are much overcrowded, 
and many devices have to be resorted to in order to accommodate the 
collections. It has been found necessary to place different parts of 
the collections in rooms widely separated, which greatly increases the 
difficulties of admhiistration. Some little improvement was made in 
the arrangement of the collection of large birds in the west basement, 
but progress was slow on account of insufficient help and space. It is 



72 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

a satisfaction to report that the Passerine birds, which are the ones 
most consulted, arc at present well arranged and entirely accessible. 
About half the study collection, comprising, perhaps, 05,000 specimens, 
is without standard Museum labels, and many of the water birds need 
new labels. Some progress in replacing worn out labels was made 
during the year. 

The condition of the collection of birds' eggs is very satisfactory. 
For a collection of such great size the proportion of perfect specimens 
is remarkabl}^ large. Considerable progress was made in the rearrange- 
ment of both eggs and nests, but more new cases will be required 
before it can be completed. 

The curator of the Division of Reptiles and Batrachians was without 
assistants this year until April, and progress in the rearrangement of 
the study series was necessarily slow. A considerable advance has 
been made, however, and the collection is now in good condition and 
its accessibility increased. 

In the Division of Fishes, the principal operation was the prepara- 
tion of a series of 50 sets of specimens for distribution to educational 
institutions. These sets average about sixty species each, making a 
total of some 3,250 individual specimens in all. Until the staff of this 
division is increased, little can be done beyond keeping the collection 
from deteriorating. 

The study series of mollusks is all in fairly good condition and is 
accessible, so that anj' specimens wanted can be brought to hand in a 
few moments. The collection of Naiades was put in perfect order, 
and the cataloguing and numbering of the boxes of duplicates brought 
up to date. The remainder of the Jeffreys collection of shells is now 
most in need of attention. On account of the intricacies of the case 
the work can not be done rapidly. As in other divisions the need of 
more space is keenly felt. 

The great systematic collection of insects of all orders, with the 
exception of the Rhynchota, is at present in excellent condition, well 
arranged, and accessible to students. The curator of the Division of 
Insects, Dr. L. O. Howard, reports as follows on the work of the 
division: 

Tlie insect collections are in excellent condition, increasing rapidly in the differ- 
ent orders, and all being rearranged in the standard insect drawers,^ in systematic 
order. It is believed, if the same liberality is continued in supplying us with these 
standard insect drawers as last year, that tbe valuable collections in the different 
orders will be soon safely secured and permanently rearranged. 

The Lepidoptera are now all arranged in these drawers and this order is in excel- 
lent shape. This work has been done almost entirely by Doctor Dyar, who deserves 
great credit, not only for making many additions to the collection through his friends 
and correspondents, but also for putting the collection in such admirable order. 

Mr. E. A. Schwarz still continues the rearrangement of the beetles, and during the 
past few months has rearranged several families down to the Lampyridaj. It will, 
however, be a long time before this large order can be rearranged, and Mr. Schwarz 



REPORT OP ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 73 

will require many more drawers before his task is completed. In a few days he will 
begin arranging the material from the Philippines, West Indies, and South America. 

Dr. Ashmead is almost continuously at work on the Hymenoptera, and has rear- 
ranged the ChaVcidoidea and part of the Cynipoidea. If room No. 3, now occupied by 
him, is fitted up with racks to contain standard insect drawers he could, the com- 
ing year, rearrange this whole order in these drawers. He considers it important 
that this be done immediately to more securely conserve the many hundreds of val- 
uable types and cotypes represented in the collection. 

The Schmidt boxes, in which many types are still kept, he considers unsafe for 
keeping valuable types. Hundreds of types and cotypes are now being sent to us 
from all over the world and proi^er facilities must be provided for the present pres- 
ervation of all types intrusted to the Museum. 

Mr. Currie still continues his work on the Neuropteroid insects and has made some 
important additions to the orders Odonata, Neuroptera, and Trichoptera. 

The Orthoptera have been removed to Dr. Dyar's room and have l)een rearranged 
into the standard insect drawers by Mr. Caudeli, who has done much work on these 
insects, made large additions of specimens, and is substantially in charge of the order. 

Mr. Coquillett also continues his work on the Diptera with indefatigable industry 
and has worked up, named, and rearranged several families. The additions to the 
family Culicidae, or the mosquitoes, are especially large and noteworthy. 

Very little work is being done in the other orders of insects not mentioned, 
although Mr. Heidemann finds time to do something occasionally with the Rhynchota. 

Our collection of Rhynchota, or bugs (Hemiptera and Homoptera), is large and 
valuable, and should be placed immediately in charge of a competent specialist. 

In the Division of Marine Invertebrates a special cataloo-uer was 
emplo3'ed for four months to bring up the cataloguing of the crusta- 
ceans, holothurians, etc. , which had fallen behind on account of lack of 
sufficient clerical assistance. One hundred new sets of duplicate inver- 
tebrates were prepared for distribution to accademical establishments. 
Some small sets were also prepared to meet special demands. The 
extensive collections in alcohol were thoroughh^ overhauled, the bot- 
tles replenished and new labels added where necessary. This impor- 
tant part of the zoological collections is now in good condition. 
Additional shelving was provided for the collection of anomuran crus- 
taceans and worms in the rooms assigned in the north tower of the 
Smithsonian building. The Museum benefited by the gratuitous 
services of Mr. T. W. Vaughan, of the U. S. Geological Survey, who 
rearranged the collection of corals so as to make room for the reception 
of recent additions. 

The scope of the Section of Helminthological Collections, under the 
custodianship of Dr. C. W. Stiles, was enlarged during the year by 
the introduction into the catalogues of the collections of the U. S. 
Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service. The collections of the 
Division of Zoology, Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department 
of Agriculture, are also catalogued in this section of the Museum. 

The need of enlarging the quarters for the National Herbarium was 
so urgent that the space allotted for an exhibition on the east hall bal- 
cony was, as already stated, added to the laboratory. One hundred 
and eleven new standard insect-proof cases were added during the year, 



74 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

iiiiiking- a total of 225 now in use. About 125 additional cases will be 
required to complete the reinstallment of the herlmrium, and it is 
hoped that these can be provided next year. The Honorary Curator, 
Mr. F. V. Coville, reports as follow^s regarding- the work done on the 
collections during the year: 

During the year we have added 111 standard insect-proof cases, making 255 now 
in use. It is hoped that some 125 new cases will be built during the coming year, 
which will about complete the installation of the collection. It will then be in a 
better condition than ever before. Very few insects are to be found in our new cases. 

At the time the herbarium was actually transferred to the National Museum, July 
1, 1894, we began to stamp every herbarium sheet added to the collection. It was 
assumed that there were then not less than 200,000 sheets in the herbarium, and the 
stamp therefore was set at 200,000. The number of specimens stamped and added to 
the herbarium since then is 220,000. Of these 17,055 have been added this year. 

The work of recording the old part of the herbarium has almost ceased and speci- 
mens are only stamped in cases where they are sent away as a loan. This record 
extends from 1 to 27,218. In addition to this, 125,001 to 156,835 have been stamped. 

It was decided at the close of the year that all the herbarium sheets 
hereafter printed should bear the legend "United States National 
Museum" as well as the impress of the nimibering stamp, which bears 
the words "United States National Herbarium." 

Blueprints of the standard herbarium cases adopted by the Museum 
were sent by request to the chief of the Insular Bureau of Agriculture, 
Manila. 

At the suggestion of Dr. C. W. Stiles the matter of imperfections in 
the red labels used inside of receptacles containing type specimens of 
animals preserved in liquid was taken up by a special committee. 
The committee submitted a report recommending the sole use of 
labels printed with a permanent ink containing sulphide of mercurv. 

LOAN OF COLLECTIONS AND COOPERATION OF SPECIALISTS. 

The loan of specimens to specialists in the United States and in 
foreign countries for purposes of scientific research continued during 
the year as usual. Onl}^ the more important transactions of this char- 
acter can be noticed in this report. As explained last year, the Museum 
usually benefits quite as mucli by these transactions as the persons who 
obtain the use of the material, as the specimens are studied, identified, 
and also quite conmionly labeled. The results of the investigations 
are sometimes puldished by the Museum, sometimes by the scientific 
organizations to which tlie specialists belong, and sometimes under 
private auspices. 

In the Division of Birds, 11 loans were made, comprising 188 speci- 
mens. Mr. Frank M. Chapman, of the American Museum of Natural 
History, obtained the use of 68 specimens, chiefly shore larks, genus 
Otocoris. Forty-five specimens of warlders, genus Dendroka,. were 
sent to Mr. Joseph Grinnell, of Palo Alto, California, to assist him 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 75 

in deterniinino; the California forms of D. aestiva. Dr. Jonathan 
Dwight, jr., obtained tlie loan of 29 specimens of plovers (genus 
Aeglalitls) for use in connection with his studies of the molting- of 
birds. All the lots sent out, with one exception, were returned dur- 
ing the year. The loans of mammals were more numerous, amounting 
in all to 29 lots, comprising about 300 specimens. Dr. J. A. Allen 
obtained the use of 110 specimens of seals and other mammals for use 
in his work on the mammals of eastern Siberia. Fortj^-one specimens 
were sent to Mr. J. A. G. Rehn to assist him in the preparation of a 
report on the mammals of southern New Mexico and western Texas, 
and 14 bats, of the genus ]Sfyctlno7rmH, for use in identifying bats of that 
genus from the Bahama Islands. Dr. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Colum- 
bian Museum, borrowed 35 specimens in connection with his work on 
Central American mammals. Other loans were chiefly to the scientific 
assistants in the Biological Survey, Department of Agriculture. The 
majority of the material was returned during the year. The mollusks, 
of the family AchatmeUidx^ loaned to the late Alpheus Hyatt, were 
transferred after his death to Prof. A. T. Mayer, who is engaged in 
completing the work left unfinished by Professor H3^att. Of insects, 
9 loans were made, the most important being a collection of 626 
Orthoptera and Dermaptera, which was sent to Mr. J. A. G. Rehn, of 
Philadelphia. Dr. Philip P. Calvert, of Philadelphia, received 285 
specimens of dragon flies (Odonata), and Dr. E. P. Felt, of Albany, 
New York, 106 specimens of ophionid hj^menoptera. The material 
loaned was, for the most part, still in the hands of the specialists at the 
close of the year. Of marine invertebrates, exclusive of mollusks, 9 
loans were made, 2 of which deserve mention. Prof. H. Coutiere, of 
the Ecole Superieure de Pharmacie, Paris, received the crustaceans of 
the family Alpheidse collected by the Hawaiian and Samoan expedi- 
tions of the Fish Conmiission steamer A/hatrosfi, and also the general 
Museum collections of that family for report. All the specimens of 
the so-called Holotliuria atra were sent to Prof. Charles L. Edwards, 
of Trinit}" College, in connection with his studies of variation. The 
stomatopod crustaceans, collected by the stafl' of the steamer Albatross 
in Hawaii and Samoa, were sent to Dr. R. P. Bigelow, of the Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology, who volunteered to report on them. 
Three lots of ostracoda were sent to Mr. R. W. Sharpe, of Wilmette, 
Illinois, who has undertaken to report on this group for the Museum. 
A number of skulls of mammals were sent to Dr. J. M. Ingersoll, 
of New York, who is engaged in a comparative study of the sinuses of 
the nose. Plants were loaned during the year, chiefl}' to the botanists 
of the Ames Botanical Laboratory, North Easton, Massachusetts, the 
Biltmore Herbarium, the Gray Herbarium, Harvard University, the 
New York Botanical Garden, and to Dr. C. E. Waters, Mr. Karl W. 
W'iegand, and Mrs. Caroline W. Harris. 



76 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

DISTKIBUTIOX OF DUPLK^ATES. 

As already stated, 1(K) new sets of marine invertebrates from the 
iluplicate collections, were made np during- the year, for distribution 
to educational establishments, in accordance with the long-standing- 
practice of the Museum. Each set contained about 200 specimens, 
representing- fi-om 92 to 99 species, making in all about 20,000 speci- 
mens. During the j'ear 50 of these sets were distributed. About 
one-half of them were sent to high schools and other pulilic schools 
throughout the United States, and the remainder to various universi- 
ties, colleges, normal schools, public libraries, seminaries, academies, 
training schools, and science clubs. 

About 50 sets of fishes were also made up for distribution. 

A series of 60 skins of monkeys, and some other mammals which 
were without data as regards localities, etc., and hence of no especial 
value in the study collection of the Division of Mammals, were dis- 
tributed to four colleges, which signified their desire to make use of 
the material in teaching. 

LABORATORY USE OF COLLECTIONS BY INVESTIGATORS. 

The collections of mammals, birds, insects and plants were frequently 
consulted by the naturalists of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, 
as in previous j^ears. Mrs. Vernon Bailey pursued studies of birds in 
connection with her book on birds of the Western United States. 
Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, examined the collections of neotropi- 
cal birds, and the committee on nomenclature, of the American Orni- 
thologists Union, examined a large amount of material for the purpose 
of ascertaining, as in past years, the status of newly described North 
American species. The series of Old World chameleons was studied 
by Mr. Thomas Barber, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, who has in 
preparation a monographic work on these reptiles. In an endeavor 
to establish the i-eal status of the snake, known as Trojndonotnf< erythro- 
gaster^ Prof. H. L. Clark, of Olivet College, Michigan, made compari- 
sons of specimens in the Museum. Comparisons of insects were made 
by the following entomologists: Prof. John B. Smith (Noctuidae), 
Dr. W. J. Holland (Moths), Dr. J. A. (^. Rehn (Orthoptera), Mr. J. C. 
Bradley (parasitic hymenoptera and sawflies), Mr. H. H. Ballon 
(Specidae). Dr. Walter Horn, of Berlin, Germany, examined the 
collections of Coleoptera and identified some of the exotic material. 
He spoke highly of the work of the late Martin L. Linell, who was for 
many years an aid in the Division of Insects. 

As for some years past, Dr. N. L. Britton, director of the New York 
Botanical Garden, was a frequent visitor to the herbarium. During 
the past year he was principally interested in studying the Crassula- 
ceae. Dr. E. L. Greene spent much time in reviewing certain of the 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. I i 

Papaveraceae, and Mr. Theodor Holm, the Cariccs. Dr. L. M. Under- 
wood, of Columbia Universit}', examined the collections of ferns. 

Inquiries were received from Stanford Universit}^ concerning the 
methods of cataloguing and labeling employed in the Department, and 
Avere answered as fully as circumstances would permit. 

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES AND PUBLICATIONS. 

This veiy important l)ranch of the work of the Department, the founda- 
tion, indeed, and the tinal aim of all its other activities, was carried on with 
no less ardor than in previous years. The segregation of work on the 
exhibition series, explained in a preceding page, left the scientific 
staff somewhat more time in which to pursue investigations, while the 
activity of systematists in various parts of the country, involving the 
use of the Government collections, showed no abatement. 

It is only possible in this place to mention some of the more impor- 
tant investigations carried on by the members of the scientific staff of 
the Museum. A complete list of all papers based on the Museum col- 
lections published by the staff for the year will be found in Appendix II 
of this volume. It is interesting to note that the articles exceed 150 
in number, and appeared in about thirt}^ different journals, including 
the following: Proceedings of the U. S. National Museum, Bulletin of 
the U. S. National Museum, Proceedings of the Biological Society of 
Washington, Proceedings of the Philadelphia Acadeni}^ of Natural 
Sciences, Science Yearbook of the Carnegie Institution, The Auk, 
Naturen, Nautilus, American Journal of Pharmacy, Journal of Con- 
chology, Smithsonian Report, Biographical Memoirs of the National 
Academy of Sciences, Canadian Entomologist, Journal of the New 
York Entomological Society, Psyche, Proceedings of the Entomolog- 
ical Society of Washington, Entomological News, Transactions of the 
Entomological Society, Country Life in America, Bulletin of the 
Museum of Comparative Zoology, Zoologischer Anzeiger, Public 
Health Report, Report of the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. 
Department of Agriculture, American Medicine, Bulletin of the 
Hygienic Laboratory, U. S. Public Health Service, Journal of Com- 
parative Medicine, Contributions from the National Herbarium, Annals 
of Botany, Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, Plant World, and 
Fern Bulletin. 

The second volume of Mr. Robert Ridgway's extensive manual of 
North and Central American birds, containing 854 pages of text and 
22 plates, was published during the year. It deals with the families 
of Tanagers, Troupials, Honey Creepers, and Wood Warblers (Tana- 
grida?, Icteridic, Coerebida>, and Mniotiltida?), comprising 77 genera 
and 433 species and subspecies. 

The preparation of the third volume, covering 15 families, was in an 
advanced stage at the close of the year, about 400 pages being already 



78 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Ill type. Dr. Charles W. Richmond's paper on the birds collected by 
Doctor Abbott and Mr. C. B. Kloss in the Andaman and Nicobar 
Islands was published by the Museum during the year. Doctor 
Uichmond sj^ent considerable time in identifying the Abbott collection 
of l)irds for the west coast of Sumatra and in working up a collection 
from the South l*aciiic. He continued work on the <:'ard catalogue of 
the genera and species of birds. Two papers on South American birds 
in the Museum collection, by Mr. H. C. Oberholser, appeared during 
the 3'ear, and also one by Dr. W. K. Fisher on a new tern from the 
Hawaiian Islands. Dr. William L. Ralph continued the preparation 
of material for a supplementary volume on the life histories of North 
American birds, Avith special reference to their nests and eggs, to com- 
plete the important work left unfinished bj'^ the death of Major C. E. 
Bend ire. 

Dr. L. Stejneger completed his study of the reptiles of Porto Rico, 
and handed the manuscript in for publication in November. It is 
hoped that means will be found for its pu))lication at an early date. 
"When the year closed he was still engaged in the investigation of the 
herpetological fauna of eastern Asia. Papers by Doctor Stejneger on 
Holbrookes salamander and on the reptiles of the Huachuca Moun- 
tains, Arizona, were published by the Museum during the 3^ear. 

In accordance with the arrangement made with President D. S. 
Jordan, the Museum published during the 3^ear 14 papers on Japanese 
fishes, prepared by himself and conjointly with other ichthyologists. 
Two papers on the osteology of fishes, by Mr. E. C. Starks, were pub- 
lished, and a brief paper by Dr. Theodore Gill on the use of the name 
"torpedo." 

In connection with an extensive work on the Tertiary mollusks 
of Florida, Dr. W. II. Dall prepared reviews of the recent mollusks 
of the groups Veneridae, Carditacea, Cyrenacea, and Astartidge. Dr. 
Bartsch continued work on the Pyramidellidae, and had nearly com- 
pleted the investigation at the close of the year. 

The researches carried on by Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., had for their 
principal object the elucidation of Doctor Abbott's collections of East 
Indian mammals. As stated on a previous page, he found in the col- 
lec-tion studied 17 new species of mouse deer, genus Tragulus, and 16 
new species in other orders, together with a new genus, Lenothrii: 
In going over the Museum collection of American bats, he detected 20 
undescribed species, diagnoses of which are published in the Proceed- 
ings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. He also pre- 
pared^ a number of notes on different species of bats and rodents. 
Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, made a study of the ocelots in the 
Museum collection and in other collections, the results of which were 
published in September, 1902, as Proceedings paper No. 1286. Dr. 
M. W. Lyon, jr., completed and handed in for publication his list of 



EEPOET OF ASSIST AJSTT SECRETARY. 79 

type specimens of mammals, exclusive of cetaceans, in the collections 
of the Museum, xls photographs of the types are to })e prepared, this 
catalogue has not yet been published. It records the presence of type 
specimens, or type material, of 469 species and subspecies. (This is 
exclusive of the type specimens in the collection of the Biological 
Survey, U. S. Department of Agriculture, which are probably at least 
as many.) Dr. Lyon has also pursued investigations relative to the 
osteology of the rabbits, and published two brief notes on other mam- 
mals. The Head Curator completed his comparison of North American 
and European species of whalebone whales, and toward the close of 
the year submitted a manuscript of about 1,000 pages, with 50 plates. 
He also prepared papers on Dr. Philippi's species of Chilean porpoises, 
on a killer whale stranded on the coast of Maine, and on a species of 
ProdeJphin us obtained at Honolulu; and notes on the name of the com 
mon porpoise of the genus Turslop.s, and on the occurrence of the 
pollack whale, BalabiiopteTa horealis^ in American waters. 

Doctor Ashmead continued his study of the classification of the 
Chalcid tlies, which was in course of publication by the Carnegie 
Museum at the close of the year, and a series of papers on the wasps 
of the groups Vespoidea, Proctotrypoidea, and Cynipoidea, was pub- 
lished in the Canadian Entomologist and other entomological journals. 
He continued work on his monographs of North America Braconidse, a 
Philippine Hymcnoptera, Japanese Hymenoptera, and also a catalogue 
of North American Hymenoptera. Mr. D. W. Coquillett was occupied 
in identifying and arranging the Diptera, and completed a revision of 
the genera of the family Empididre. A paper by him describing four 
new genera and U4 new species of North America diptera appeared in 
the Museum Proceedings in September, 1902. Mr. Nathan Banks 
published 16 papers on spiders and on other subjects of a more general 
character. A paper on dragon flies, and one on ant lions, by Mr. R. P. 
Currie, were published by the Entomological Society of Washington 
during the year. Mr. Currie continued work on a catalogue of 
North American Neuropteroid insects, and on a monograph of the ant 
lions. Mr. August Busck published 2 papers on the codling moth, 
and one on a new species of the family Iponomentidae. His revision 
of the American moths of the family Gelechiidae was published by the 
Museum during the year. The Museum Proceedings for the year also 
contained a paper by Dr. H. G, Dyar on the larva of moths from 
Colorado, and an additional section of Dr. John B. Smith's monograph 
of the moths of the family Noctuidae. Dr. J. E. Benedict published 
descriptions of new species of Galatheidae, and completed a revision of 
the genus Lejndojxi., and descriptions of other new Albuneidae. He 
also engaged in the study of the anonmran crabs from Japan and the 
Hawaiian Islands, collected by the xUhafross^ some new crabs of the 
familv Dromidae, and some interesting annelids. Miss M. J. Rathbun 



80 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

continued work on a monoorapli of the fresh-water crabs, based on the 
collections of the National Museum, the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, 
Paris, th(; Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, and 
other institutions. She also published live short papers on crusta- 
ceans during- the year, one of which, describing new Hawaiian crabs, 
appeared in the Museum Proceedings. Dr. Harriet liichardson pub- 
lished descriptions of two new isopods. Two papers on crustaceans 
collected in and near Mammoth Cave and Nickajack Cave, by Prof. 
W. P. Hay, were published by the Museum. 

Dr. Charles B. Wilson completed his study of the collection of 
North American copepod crustaceans of the family Argulidaj, the 
results of which were pu])lished by the Museum as Proceedings paper 
No. 1302. It occupies 107 pages, and includes a review of all the 
species of the family and a bibliography, and is accompanied by 20 
plates. 

Dr. C. W. Stiles, Custodian of Helminthological Collections, made 
an extended investigation of a parasitic disease prevalent among the 
people of the Southern States, which he found to be due to the attacks 
of a new species of hookworm, TJncinariaamericana. He also carried 
on investigations regarding frequency of the occurrence of parasites 
in men. He published nine papers relating- to parasitology during 
the year and three others along the same line conjointl}^ with Dr. 
Albert Hassall and Mr. Charles A. Pfender; also the first three parts 
of an index catalogue of medical and veterinary zoology, Doctor Has- 
sall l)eing a coauthor. The statf of the National Herbarium was too 
fully occupied during the j^ear with routine work and the rearrange- 
ment of the collections to devote a great deal of time to investigations. 
A third section of Doctor Rose's studies of Mexican and Central 
American plants was published, and a paper in joint authorship with 
Mr. W. B. Hemsley on the genus Julian la. He continued work on 
the Crassulacese of North America conjointly with Doctor Britton, 
and completed a preliminary paper relating to that group of plants. 
Mr. C. L. Pollard published a number of notes in the Plant World, 
and described two new violets from the United States. He also pub- 
lished conjointly with Mr. T. D. A. Cockerell descriptions of four 
new plants from new Mexico. Mr. W. R. Maxon continued studies on 
the Museum collection of ferns, and Mr. Edward S. Steele completed 
a monograph of the genus Laclnaria. 

EXPOSITIONS. 

As stated in the last report, a part of the collections displayed at 
the Pan-American Exposition at Buti'alo, 1901, were later transferred 
to the Charleston Exposition, which closed May 31, 1902. The 
exhibit made at the latter place was returned to Washington in June. 



EEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETAKY. 81 

In the meantime preparations were begun for the Louisiana Purchase 
Exposition, St. Louis, 1904. The scliedule of exhibits for this expo- 
sition, approved by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 
includes the displa}^ of a series of specimens of the large game mam- 
mals of the world, the cast of an adult sulphur-bottom whale (the 
largest existing animal), a series of the largest and most attractive 
birds, such as the ostriches, pheasants, birds of paradise, etc. ; large 
reptiles, such as the crocodiles, alligators, boas, pythons, cobras, and 
the like; a series of models of deep-sea hshes; a systematic series of 
invertebrates, arranged with the special view of illustrating modern 
methods of museum installation and labeling; a series of the eggs of 
vertebrates; a collection of l)utterflies. An exhibit from the National 
Herbarium, and some minor exhibits, will probabl}'^ be decided upon 
later. A representation of the Children's Room, showing the methods 
to interest children in the study of animate nature, will also be made. 
A report on the Pan-American Exposition was submitted during this 
year, and will be found in the Assistant Secretarj^'s report for 1900- 
1901, pp. 177 to 231. The Head Curator, having been in charge of 
the exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum at 
the Charleston Exposition, also submitted a report in that connection 
wliich w^ill 1)e found in the Assistant Secretary's report for 1901-2,

82 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUESUM, 1903. 

Mr. W. E. Scollick was uppointed preparator in the Division of 
Mammals, May 14, 1903, and was assigned to the work of cleaning 
skulls of small mammals. 

Mrs. K. E. Earll, assistant in the National Herl)ariuni, was given 
leave of absence without pa}- from JuW 1 to October 1, 1902. 

Miss L. V. Schaeffer, preparator in the same division, was trans- 
ferred to the library, July 1, 1902. 

jSliss J. Ilarvie served as a volunteer assistant in the Division of 
Marine Invertebrates for about nine months. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY 
FOR THE YEAR 1902-3. 

By GEORC4E p. Merrill, 
Head Curator. 

The year that has just closed compares very favorably with those 
immediately preceding-, both as to the number and value of the acces- 
sions. The Department is to be particularly congratulated on acquiring 
the Rominger and Sherwood collections of vertebrate and invertebrate 
fossils; another large portion of the Ulrich collection, and three entire 
meteorites from Kentucky and North Carolina, as noted below. The 
tine example of the Shergott3% India, meteorite, secured through 
the courtesy of Dr. T. H. Holland, and a fragment of the celebrated 
diamond-bearing meteorite from Novo Urei, Russia, are also worthy of 
mention. 

ACCESSIONS. 

The total number of accessions received by the Department is shown 
in tabular form below, those for 1900-1901 and 1901-2 l)eing also 
given for purposes of comparison:

specimens, 

3. The Andrew Sherwood collection of Pennsylvania Upper Devonic 
vertebrate and inverto])rate fossils. This contains many choice slabs 
tilled with large bi-achiopods and molhisca, besides about 8,000 small 
specimens. 

4. Collections of trilobites with limbs {Tnarf/iru.s heckl) studied by 
Doctor Walcott and descril)ed in the Proceedings of the Biological 
Society of Washington, 1894; of Little Metis sponges, and some 
twenty boxes of Paleozoic fossils, from the U. S. Geological Survey. 

5. One large slab containing 18 fine specimens of melonites and some 
185 labeled specimens from the Marcellus limestone; received from 
Dr. C. E. Beecher, of Yale University. 

SECTION OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOCiY. 

1. Casts of mandibulai- rami; teeth oi Mastodon humholdfl q.\\(\ 2f<is- 
todon cordillennii; recei\^ed from the British Museum.

collection. 

2. A small series of fossil plants, from the Permian of Ohio. 

3. Four hundred and eighty-eight specimens of Triassic plants, from 
Connecticut and Massachusetts; received from the U. S. Geological 
Survey. 

ROUTINE. 

During the year under consideration the geographic exhibit of 
economic minerals in the southwest court has been largely overhauled 
and cases and specimens cleaned and rearranged. The collection of non- 
metallic minerals on the balcony has likewise undergone rearrange- 
ment. The case containing the stratigraphic and historical collections, 
against the south wall in the west-south range, has been entirely recon- 
structed and the collections reinstalled. In the course of this work 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 87 

some 2,500 blocks constructed on a new plan were introduced. These 
are made of a tripartate veneering and only about one-fourth inch in 
thickness. 

In six floor upright exhibition cases and one wall-case, double doors 
have been replaced by single, thus more than doubling the size of the 
glass. The improvement is so great as to suggest the advisability of 
carrying out the work in all the cases of this type. 

The collections on the west front of the Museum have been over- 
liauled and many specimens removed to storage, whereby the appear- 
ance of the west front is considerably improved. The work has, as 
usual, been done under the direct supervision of Mr. Newhall. 

Manuscript for about 1,300 lal)el8 has been prepared and sent to the 
Government Printer. Upward of 6,000 specimen and reference cards 
have also been prepared, and an equal number of specimens numbered. 

The work of preparing the type catalogue has progressed but slowly, 
only about 3( »0 slips having been written. The large influx of new and 
especially type material, has made it seem advisable to postpone the 
immediate publication of this list. This work, together with the gen- 
eral stenographic and clerical work of the department, has remained 
in the hands of Mrs. Jouy and Miss Graves. 

In the section of invertebrate paleontology a large amount of work 
has been done in arranging the new materials, particularly those of 
the E. O. Ulrich collection. During the year there were identified or 
placed in final nniseum condition upward of 16,000 specimens. These 
are recorded in the registers, but, on account of lack of clerical help, 
have not been numbered, nor have cards been made for the card 
catalogue. 

Dr. Peale reports that work on the paleobotanical series has con- 
tinued along the same lines as last year. The exhibition series has been 
partially rearranged and new labels have been printed and exchanged 
for the temporary labels of the Paleozoic portion of the collection. 

Work in the section of vertebrate paleontology has proceeded but 
slowly, owing to the small force engaged. Mr. Stewart has been at 
work during almost the entire year upon a mount of the Claosaurus. 
The work is now nearly completed, and it is expected that during the 
coming fall this very interesting vertebrate fossil will be placed on 
exhibition in the southeast court. The hind limb of a B rontosaurus 
has been prepared and placed on exhibition during the time under 
consideration. 

No explorations have been carried on during the year at the expense 
of the Museum. Messrs. Schuchert and Bassler and the Head Curator 
have been in the field on various occasions, but either at their own 
expense or that of other organizations. Much valuable material has 
thus been obtained. 



88 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

EXCHANGES AND LOANS. 

There have been sent out from the Division of Geology during this 
period, to various individuals and students, some 1,262 individual 
specimens and 1,288 pounds of miscellaneous material — this entirely 
aside from such materials as are ordinarily loaned for study and inves- 
tigation. For the last-named purposes there have been loaned during 
the 3'ear, from the Division of Geology: 

To T. Nelson Dale, Pittstield, Massachusetts, 6 specimens of roofing 
slates and thin sections. 

To George I. Adams, U. 8. Geological Surve}^ 9 specimens of 
gypsum. 

To George F. Barker, Universit}" of Pennsylvania, 3 specimens of 
uraninite. 

From the Division of Mineralogy, material has been furnished to 
the Chemical and Physical Department of the U. S. Geological Sur- 
vey, to the Division of Koads of the Department of Agriculture, and to 
the Bureau of Soils of the same Department. Samples of the Putnam 
County, Georgia, and Admire, Kansas, meteorites were sent to Dr. 
E. (yohen, Greifswald, Germany, for use in his researches on meteoric 
ii'on. 

From the Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology there were loaned 
to Dr. C. E. Beecher 43 specimens of Upper Carboniferous insects. 
To A. W. Grabau, Colural)ia University, 8 crinoids. To Dr. M. Coss- 
niann, Paris, 16 Cretaceous gastropods. To Prof. S. W. Williston, 
University of Chicago, 257 specimens of Tertiary insects. To Dr. 
John M. Clarke, State paleontologist, Albany, New York, a large lot 
of Lower Silurian graptolites; and to the Royal Austrian Museum 
(Dr. Handlirsch), 562 Carboniferous insects. 

Portions of collections in the section of vertebrate paleontology 
have been studied by Dr. E. C. Case, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Prof. 
S. W. Williston, University of Chicago; Dr. J. B. .Hatcher, Carnegie 
Museum, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania; Prof. H. F. Osborn, of the Amer- 
ican Museum of Natural History in New York City; and Dr. John 
M. Clarke, State paleontologist of New York. 

The paleobotanical collections, as usual, have been contiiuially 
availa])le to the paleobotanists of the U. S. Geological Survey. In 
addition. Dr. Arthur Hollick, of the New York Botanical Gardens, 
has on several occasions visited the Museum in connection with his 
work on the island series of the Upper Cretaceous. 

PRESENT CONDITION OF (X)LLECTIONS. 

It may be safely stated that, as a whole, the collections are in better 
condition than ever before. The improvement has been constant, and 
though not as rapid as one could wish, is fairly satisfactory— perhaps 
as satisfactory as can be expected in the present building. Naturally

there must be a constant weeding out of old material and the insertion 
of new in ordm- that the collections may be kept up to date, but expan- 
sion alon<.- any lines other than that of vertebrate paleontology is 
practically prohibited through lack of space. The work which is now 
beino- done in connection with preparations for the Louisiana Pur- 
chase Exposition will, on the assumption that the collections return to 
us in safety, till the halls to their utmost extent, and it will unques- 
tiona])ly l)e necessary to store a considerable amount of less desirable 

material. . i z-ii i 

Mention may be made here of the mounted skeleton ot the Church, 
Michigan, mastodon, collected by Mr. Alban Stewart in tlie spring of 
1001, which is now in an advanced state of preparation. This gives 
the Museum its iirst complete mounted representative of this interest- 
ing group of quadrupeds. 

The acquisition for the workshops of a one-half horsepower^motor 
with flexible shaft and fittings for drilling and cutting, and a "Jenny 
Lind" polisher, together with a renewal of the large grinding l)ed and 
the remodeling of the reciprocating stone saw, have greatly facilitated 
the work of the preparators. 

The work of the year, as on previous occasions, has been compli- 
cated by preparation for an exposition. 

RESEARCH. 

Various influences have prevented the Head Curator from taking an 
active part in research in connection with the Museum collections. 
Numerous brief papers have been published, but as they were not, for 
the most part, based upon Museum materials, they need not be men- 
tioned here. 

In connection with Mr. Tassin, investigations have been made upon 
the meteorite collections, but the results as yet are far from ready for 

publication. 

The Head Curator has in course of preparation a work upon the 
History of American Geology. This is as yet so far from complete 
as to need no special notice at this time. 

Mr. Schuchert has continued his studies on Lower Devonic fossils, 
as reported last year. A report to be published l)y the Geological 
Survey of Maryland on this subject is progressing satisfactorily, and 
it is expected will be ready for the printer some time during the com- 
ing year. 

Mr. Schuchert has also completed a study of the Cystidea ot tlie 
Manlius and Coey mans formations. The paper is about ready for pul >- 

lication. 

Mr. R. S. Bassler has in preparation studies on the Bryozoa and 
Ostracoda. A paper reviewing the entire Bryozoa of the Rochester 
shales will, it is expected, be completed during the coming winter. 



90 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Mr. Phalen has made a study of rocks collected by Messrs. Schuchert 
and White in Greenland in 1S97. 

Papers b\^ meml)er.s of the U. S. Geolog-ical Surve}^ upon materials 
in the section of paleobotan}^ are noted in the bibliography. 

The personnel of the Department remains the same as last j^ear. Mr, 
J. W, Coleman, skilled laborer in the section of vertebrate paleon- 
tology, who had i)een away on \enve of absence, returned to work on 
8eptoml)or li>. H>(>!2, but tinally severed hisi connection with the 
Museum dui'ing the lattei- i)art of June.

The etymology and singular form of the 
word Mammalia have been erroneously given 
in all dictionaries as derived from the Latin 
adjective »na»i«7 o/(.s and as cognate with vari- 
ous words in living European languages. It 
is contended that the name was first given by 
Linnseus in 17.58, and that he formed it in 
analogy with Animalia and derived it directly 
from the noun Mamma and added the suffi.x 
-alia. A history of the use of the word is 
given.

GILL, THEonoKE. The hot^ts of Argulids 
and their noinenchittire. 

Science (new series), xvii. No. 4is, Jan. 2, 
1903, p. 33. 
The names of the fish-hosts of many of the 
species described in the " Monograph of North 
American Parasitic Copepods of the family 
Argulida?," by C. B. Wilson, are corrected 
and the fishes identified. 

The bones of the shoulder girdle 

of fishes. 

Science (new series), xvii. No. 424, Feb. 
13, 1903, pp. 255-256. 
The most characteristic system of bones of 
the pisciform vertebrates is manifest in the 
shoulder girdle, and the classes of selachians 
and typical fishes, or teleostomes, have been 
segregated under the name Lyrifera, on ac- 
• count of the character of this girdle. The 
consideration of the bones, liowever, mili- 
tates decidedly against the acceptance of the 
views generally held. Scapula and coracoid 
were given originally to the composite bone 
and Its process familiar from manifestation 
in man. The bones of fishes to which the 
nam.es have been given are certainly not ho- 
mologous. They, in fact, are only developed 
as such in fishes specialized as toleosts and 
very remote from the primitive stock of the 
terrestrial vertebrates. A special nomencla- 
ture is therefore necessary. The so-called 
scapula has been designated as hypercoracoid, 
the coracoid as hypocoracoid, and the Span- 
genstuck, or precoracoid, as mesocoracoid. 
The mesocoracoid disappears in most fishes, 
all the acanthopterygians and offshoots from 
that stock being deprived oi that ossicle. 

The systematic relations of the 

fish genus Lampns. 

Science (new series), xvii, No. 424. Feb. 
13, 1903, pp. 256-257. 
Recently the foremost ichthyologist of Eu- 
rope, Doctor Bouienger, reexamined the 
osteology of Lampns, and especially the 
shoulder girdle, and attained novel concep- 
tions as to the athnitiesot thai genus. The 
number oi bones in the shoulder girdle of 
Lamprib is tne same as in ordinary acanthop- 
terygian fishes, but two of them have been 
interpreted Irom a different standpoint than 
by bis predecessors (1) The very large bone 
which occupies tne lower and posterior part 
of the girdle was considered by him to be a 
peculiar bone, named mterclavicle, and 
hopioiogizea with a homonymous bone of the 
hemibranchs, and (2) the smaller one imme- 
diately above it ana behind the bones sup- 
porting the pectoral fin was regarded as a 
'■coracoid' or nypocoracoid. Therefore he 
considered it as the representative not only 
of a peculiar iamiiy (Lamprididse), but of an 
independent higher group named Selenich- 
thyes and coordinated with the Hemibranchii 
and Lophobranchii,the three being associated 
together as representatives of a suborder to 



GILL, Theodore — Continuea. 

which the new name Catosteomi was given. 
To test this conclusion the skeleton of Lampns 
was submitted to renewed examination. 
That examination forced the author to ac- 
ceptance of the principal ideas of the older 
ichthyologists; four actinosts, or pterygials, 
are recognized, and the coracoid of Bouienger 
is identified with the fourth. The hypocora- 
coid is found in the interclavicle of Bouien- 
ger. As a consequence, the genus is restored 
to the group of acanthopterygians. Never- 
theless, the differences between Lampris and 
all other fishes are sufticiently great to entitle 
it to rank as the type of a family (Lampridi- 
dae), as well as a special superfamily (Lani- 
pridoidea). 

Origin of the name Monotremes. 

Science (new series), xvn. No. 428, Mar. 
13, 1903, pp. 433-434. 
It is shown that the name Monotremes was 
given by E. Geoffroy as an ordinal designation 
(in French form only) in 1803, the order 
(ordre) diagnosed, and the genera " Onii- 
thorhinchus" and "Echid7ia" referred to it. 

Homologies of the anterior limb. 

Science (new series), xvn, No. 430, Mar. 
27, 1903, p. 489. 
It is contended that Polypterus gives us a 
key to the problem in question, as has been 
already urged Dy the writer in 1872, 1878, and 
1882. This view, after long neglect, was 
independently urged later by others, especi- 
ally Emery and Pollard, but with differences 
of detail. Tbe humerus, radius, ulna, carpal, 
and metacarpal bones are found in a recog- 
nizable condition in Polypterus. That genus 
is the nearest oi the living fishes in relation- 
ship to the amphibians and (onsequently all 
terrestrial vertebrates

p. 86. 
The name Ficus? hcaperia lias been used in 
the Bulletin of the U. S. Geological Survey on 
the Flora of the Montana Formation, for a 
plant from the North Fork of Button Creek in 
the Laramie Plains, Wyoming, and also for a 
different species from the vicinity of Ashland, 
Oreg., in the 20th Annual Report of the U. S. 
Geological Surve;,', and as the former ante- 
dates the latter, the change to Ficusf applega- 
tei is made. 

Notes on the fossil fruits and lig- 
nites of Brandon, Vt. 

Bull. Torrcy Bofan. Club, No. 29, Nov., 1902, 
pp. 635-641, pi. 25. 
The occurrence and geological position of 
the lignites are described and the conclusion 
reached that in age they are younger than 
the Eocene. These Brandon lignites are also 
determined to be largely coniferous. Selected 
specimens upon examination were found to 
be only varietally different from Schmaul- 



KNOWLTON, Frank H.— Continued, 
hausen's Pitoxylon microporosum, and for the 
Brandon form the name Piiyoxyloninicroporo- 
sum brandonianum is proposed. One small 
specimen was determined to be dicotyledo- 
nous, probably allied to Betula. The author 
had intended making an exhaustive micro- 
scopic study of the structure of the fruits so 
abundant in those lignites, but was prevented 
from completing the work, and therefore pre- 
sents only some scattered notes on a few of 
the species, to one of which he gives the new 
name Cncumites lesquereurii.

Btdl. Torrey Botan. Club, No. 29, Dec, 1902, 

pp. 705-709, pi. 26, fig. 1 (in text). 

In this paper four species are enumerated, 

among them one that is new — Tillia treedii — 

and the age of the beds in which they occur 

is given as the Fort Union Tertiary. 

Fossil flora of the John Day basin, 

Oregon. 

Bull. U. S. Geol. Surv., No. 204, 1902, pp. 
1-113, pis. i-xvii. 
The ,Tohn Day basin lies in nortli central 
Oregon between the north and south ranges 
of the Blue Mountains, covering an area of 
approximately 10,000 square miles, drained by 
the .John Day River and its tributaries. The 
flora of the basin, as set fortli in this paper, 
comprises 150 forms distributed among 37 
natural families and the anomalous group of 
Phyllites. Of the 150 forms enumerated, 24 
have not been specifically named, and 44 
species and one variety are described as new, 
the previously known .species numbering 81. 
The beds are all of Tertiary age, ranging from 
Lower Eocene to Upper Miocene. The con- 
ditions prevailing in the John Day basin in 
Tertiary times extended into central Wash- 
ington, northwestern Idaho, and western 
Oregon.

The present part of this monograph deals 
with four exclusively American families of 
Pas.seres (Tanagrida-, Icteridse, Cterebidfe, 
and Mniotiltid»), embracing 77 genera and 
■433 species and subspecies. The treixtment of 
species is similar to that followed in the first 
part of the work. Brief descriptions of the 
known plumages are given, followed by 
measurements, the geographical ranges, and 
a full synonymy. The following forms are 
introduced as new: P?i€enicothraupis rubicn 
nelsoni (p. 145), Compsothlypis americana ra- 
malinx (p. 486), Geothlypis incompta (p. 677),

1902, pp. 696-610, pis. 3, 4. 
The principal specimens described in this 
paper, which was published in the Report of 
the State Paleontologist, are from the Che- 
mungstrataof East Windsor, Broome County, 
N. Y.,and are referred to a new genus, Tham- 
nodadus, and are named Thamnodadus 
darkei. The new genus i.s differentiated from 
Buthoireplm, Psilophyton, and HaUserites, to 
the latter of which specimens of the new 
genus have hitherto been referred. The 
name Txniocrada is proposed for the mem- 
branaceous algoid plant conforming to the 
genus HaUserites as defined by Penhallow. 
The type species is said to be Tivniocrada 
lesqiiereuxii, formerly illustrated as HaUserites 
dechenianvs.

The following references to papers by Dr. Theodore Gill, published between Sep- 
tember, 1899, and May, 1902, were not furnished in time to be included with tlie 
bibliographies accompanying the reports for those j'ears, and are therefore printed 
in connection with the Museum Inbliography for 1903, at his request. 



GILL, Theodore. Desirability of exten- 
sion of study of eggs. (Editorial. ) 
Osprey, iv, No. 1, Sept., 1899, pp. 9-10. 
The desirability of extending the .study of 
eggs beyond their shells is urged. The in- 
vestigations of Valenciennes and Fremy on 
the contents of the egg, published in 1854, are 
referred to, and the difference between the 
reaction to boiling is indicated in the case of 
the albumen of the Lapwing. Data are asked 
for as "to the absolute and relative time re- 
quired by the white and yellow to become 
hard in boiling, the degree of hardness ac- 
quired, and the behavior of white and yellow 
to reagents." It is also added that "the edi- 
bility and taste of eggs of different kinds would 
also be interesting subj ects for investigation ." 

Popular ignorance of birds. (Ed- 
itorial. ) 

Osprey, IV, No. 3, Nov., 1899, pp. 43-44. 
The wide publication of a note on "A bird 
with a monkey face" is taken as the text of 
an editorial on the general ignorance of com- 
mon birds. The bird in question was a com- 
mon Barn Owl. 



GILL, Theodore. The largest birds, 
(pjditorial.) 

Osprey, iv. No. 4, Dec, 1899, pp. 57-59. 
The opinion of J. E. Harting that the Dinor- 
'iiis miLtimus was "the largest known bird 
that had ever lived" is noted. The Ttirasae- 
tus harpyia, or Harpy Eagle, is declared to be 
apparently the largest bird of prey, weighing 
28 to 30 pounds. Attention is called to the 
overlooked fact that the common Turkey 
may be "the largest bird that flies," as it 
sometimes may exceptionally attain a weight 
of 70 pounds. Such a turkey, however, could 
scarcely fly. 

Esthetic ])irds: The Bower P.irds 

of Australia and New Guinea. 

Osprey, IV, No. 4, Jan., 1900, pp. 67-71. 
A summary of the knowledge acqtiired re- 
specting the nesting habits of the Bower 
Birds, or Ptilonorhynchinse, is given and the 
"bowers and playing grounds" as well as 
"nests and eggs" of species described and 
illustrated by 3 figures representing the 
Satin Bower Bird and its nest and eggs, as 
well as the Bower of the (jreat Bower Bird.

The origin of the Hawaiian fauna 

(editorial. ) 

Osprey, iv, No. G, Feb., 1900, pp. 90-91. 
A continuation of a former editorial article 
on the same subject, in which the land shell- 
bearing Gasteropoda are considered. The 
conclusion is reached that "the extent of 
differentiation and segregation of the pre- 
dominant Achatinellines almost compels us 
to believe that their progenitors came upon 
the islands very early. With the present fee- 
ble light to guide us, it seems to be more 
likely that these progenitors came from the 
westof the islands." This is in contrast with 
the indications furnished by the birds as at 
present understood. We are thus left in an 
unsettled condition, and must await future 
more detailed studies. 

Mercantile value of eggs. 

Osprey, iv, No. 7, Mar., 1900, pp. 109-110. 
In response to an inquiry why a great auk's 
egg should be considered more valuable than 
that of an Aepyornis, the circumstances regu- 
lating value in the nature of demand and 
supply are indicated.

Science (new series), xi, June 8, 1900, pp. 
900-901. 
An abstract of "a communication to the 
National Academy of Sciences made April 18, 
1900." It is contended that the African fauna 
" has two sides, facing in opposite directions, 
and it can not be understood without taking 
both into consideration." The association of 
Africa with Asia or Europe is "illogical and 
falsifies the record." "Whatever facts a 
classification may be intended to embody, 
the African fauna must be isolated. If we 
wish to express, in our terminology, a former 
condition of affairs, Eogsea is a term adapted 
to do so."

Significance and etymology of the 

word mammal. 

Osprey, iv, No. 10, June, 1900, pp. 157-159. 
The etymology imagined in the Century 
Dictionary and others is shown to be errone- 
ous. The name mammalia is declared to have 
been formed by Linnaeus in analogy with 
Animalia, from the word mamma with the 
suffix alia. The singular, con.sequently, 
should be mammal and not mammale. The 
history of the anglicized form mammal and 
Mammifer is also indicated.

Bdellostoma or Heptatrema. 

I'voc. V. S. Nat. Max., xxiii, No. 1234, 
June 6, 1901, 735-738. 
The name Heptatrema is traced back to its 
origin and the history of the nomenclature of 
the genus detailed. It is shown that the 
earliest name was Eptatretus (1819) and that 
consequently the family name should be 
Eptatretidie. 

Note on the genus Hollandia of 

Karsh. 

Science (new .series), xiii, June 14, 1901, 
pp. 949-050. 
The name Hollandia, having been applied 
in 1892 to one genus, could not be given to a 
second, and consequently the genus of but- 
terflies named Hollandia by Karsch in 1897 
is renamed Hollandella. The family Holan- 
diidx is degraded to the rani: of a subfamily 
named HoUundeUinse.

Alewives. 

Notes and Queries (9), viii, No. 200, Nov. 
30, 1901, pp. 451-452. 
In answer to a previous inquiry (Vol. vii, 
p. 406) the etymology and true name of the 
American Alewife are given. In correction 
of the great New England Dictionary it is re- 
marked that Alewife was and still is a name 
applied in .some places in England to one of 
the Shads, and quite naturally it was brought 
over to the United States by the immigrants 
from England. Aloof e, given as an etymon 
and an Indian name, is nothing but Aloose, 
the antique s having been mistaken for an f. 
Aloo.se, Alose, and Alice, as well as Alewife, 
are derivatives from the old Latin Alosa.

THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM: 

AN ACCOUNT OE THE BUILDINGS OCCUPIED BY THE 

NATIONAL COLLECTIONS. 



By Richard Rathbun, 
Assistant Secretary of the Sialthsonian Institution, in charge of the U. S. National Museum. 



INTRODUCTION. 

The object of this paper is to In-iefly describe the history and 
character of the several building's in which the science and art collec- 
tions belonging- to this Government have })een housed and cared for, 
the time for such an account seeming especiall}" opportune, in view of 
the recent beginnings of an additional, larger, and more elaborate 
structure to meet th(^ demands for increased space. No attempt is 
made to contrast the present accommodations with those provided 
elsewhere for a like purpose, only such criticisms l)eino- offered as 
are directl}^ suggested by the buildings themselves. 

The scope of the U. S. National Museum, as defined by acts of 
Congress, is exceedingly broad, including, besides natui'al historj^ 
geology, archtiDology and ethnology, the various arts and industries of 
man. Its development, resulting largely from Government explora- 
tions, has been greatest in the four subjects first mentioned. The 
collections illustrating the industrial arts, though now mainly in 
storage, are nearly as extensive in the amount of exhibition space 
required, and they can be rapidly enlarged and perfected as soon as 
a place is found for them. 

Since the seventh decade of the last century the Museum has been 
continuously in a state of congestion, and with ever increasing- acces- 
sions, it earl\' )>ecame necessary to resort to outside storage, in which 
the amount of material is now extremely large. The demand for 
additional room, therefore, dates back over twenty years, being based 
partly on the need of placing these valuable collections under safe 
conditions and partly on the important requirement of bringing them 
into service by classification and arrangement. Last j^ear an impor- 
tant step in this direction was realized — the passage of an act of Con- 
gress under which a more commodious and worthy building- will 

speedily be secured.

182 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

As to the saitiil)ility for inuseuin purposes of the existing buildings 
it may be said that the Smithsonian building was erected l)efore 
nuich was known of museum needs, and it was moreover designed 
onl}' in part for nuiseum use. Its public halls,* though exhibiting 
man}' important defects, have as a whole served their purpose well. 
The acconnnodations for laboratories and the storage of reserve collec- 
tions are, on the other hand, ver}' poor, being mainly found in base- 
ment and small tower rooms, inconvenient and badly lighted. 

The Museum 1)uilding, constructed soon after the Centennial Exhi- 
bition of 1S76, primarily for the extensive collections brought to 
Washington from that source, was put up hastily and cheaply, and 
therefore not as substantially as was advisable. It is practically one 
great exhibition hall, since its partition walls are pierced at frequent 
intervals with broad and high arched openings. The lighting in the 
main is not unsatisfactory, though with a different roof construction it 
could be much improved. Here again, however, fault is to be found 
with the space available for workrooms and storerooms, since, having 
practicall}^ no basement, these rooms are confined to the towers and 
pavilions. 

In planning the new granite building an opportunity is offered for 
correcting these faults. Good and convenient laboratories and storage 
rooms have been provided for, and it is intended that the exhi))ition 
halls shall show a decided improvement over those in the older 
structures. 

The history of the buildings is briefly as follows: 

In 1840 a society was organized in the city of Washington under the 
name of the National Institution, afterwards changed to the National 
Institute, among whose objects was the direction of the Smith- 
son bequest, then under discussion by Congress, and the bringing 
together of collections in natural history, ethnology, and such other 
subjects as fall within the scope of a general museum. Its member- 
ship included man}^ prominent persons, among them members of the 
Government and of Congress, which gave to the society a recognized 
position and secured to its purposes extensive quarters in the building 
of the Patent Office. Here w'ere assembled the many valuable speci- 
mens brought home by the famous United States Exploring Expedition 
around the world, as well as others derived from both Government 
and private sources, which formed the nucleus of the present national 
collections, soon to pass under other control. 

Under date of December 6, 1838, the President announced to Con- 
gress the receipt in this country and the investment of the Smithson 
bequest, amounting to a little more than half a million dollars, and 
also invited the attention of that body to the obligation devolving upon 
the United States to fulfill the objects of that ))equest. During the 
seven and three-quarters years which ensued to the time of the actual 



NATIONAL MU8EUM BUILDINGS. 183 

foundation of the Smithsonian Institution, this matter was constant!}^ 
before Congress, the subject of numerous propositions and of extended 
debates. By the will of Smithson the city of Washington was to be 
the home of the establishment, but the character and extent of its 
buildings, as well as their site, depended upon the policy which 
Congress might adopt for carrying out the wishes of the benefactor, so 
tersel}' yet wisely expressed. 

The bill which was finally passed and received the approval of the 
President on August 10, 1816, gave to the Smithsonian Institution the 
custody of the national collections, and provided for a site and building 
in the following terms: 

AN ACT To establish the "Smithsonian Institution," for the increase and diffusion of knowledge 

among men. 

Sec. 4. And he it further enacted, That, after the board of regents shall have met and 
become organized, it shall be their duty forthwith to proceed to select a suitable site 
for such building as may be necessary for the institution, which ground may be taken 
and appropriated out of that part of the public ground in the city of Washington 
lying l)etween the patent office and Seventh Street: Provided, The President of the 
United States, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of 
War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Commissioner of the Patent Office, shall 
consent to the same; but, if the persons last named shall not'consent, then such loca- 
tion may be made upon any other of the public grounds within the city of Washing- 
ton, belonging to the United States, which said regents may select, by and with the 
consent of the persons herein named; and the said ground, so selected, shall be set 
out by proper metes and bounds, and a description of the same shall be made, and 
recorded in a book to be provided for that purpose, and signed by the said regents, 
or so many of them as may be convened at the time of their said organization; and 
such record, or a copy thereof, certified by the chancellor and secretary of the board 
of regents, shall be received in evidence, in all courts, of the extent and boundaries 
of the lands appropriated to the said institution; and, upon the making of such rec- 
ord, such site and lands shall be deemed and taken to be appropriated, by force of 
this act, to the said institution. 

Sec. 5. And be it further enacted. That, so soon as the board of regents shall have 
selected the said site, they shall cause to be erected a suitable building, of plain and 
durable materials and structure, without unnecessary ornament, and of sufficient 
size, and with suitable rooms or halls, for the reception and arrangement, upon a 
liberal scale, of objects of natural history, including a geological and mineralogical 
cabinet; also a chemical laboratory, a library, a gallery of art, and the necessary 
lecture rooms; and the said board shall have authority, by themselves, or by a com- 
mittee of three of their mem1)ers, to contract for the completion of such building, 
ui)on such plan as may be directed by the board of regents, and shall take sufficient 
security for the buil.ling and finishing the same according to the said plan, and in 
the time stipulated in such contract; and may so locate said l)uilding, if they shall 
deem it proper, as in appearance to form a wing to the patent office building, and 
may so connect the same with the present hall of said patent office building, 
containing the national cabinet of curiosities, as to constitute the said hall, in whole 
or in part, the deposit for the caliinet of said institution, if they deem it expedient 
to do so: provided, said building shall be located upon said patent office lot, in the 
manner aforesaid: Provided, however, That the whole expense of the building and 

enclosures aforesaid shall not exceed the amount of , which sum is hereby 

appropriated, payable out of money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated,

on the Mall, but alono- its northern edg-e, directly facing the Smith- 
sonian building. Upon its completion, the Museum will be in occu- 
pancy of a group of throe buildings, counting a part of the Smithso- 
nian as one, and it ma}' safely be predicted that none will long contain 
any \acant space. 

THE SMITHSONIAN GROUNDS. 

In a bill for the organization of the Smithsonian Institution, pre- 
pared by Representati\e John Quincy Adams, and presented to the 
United States Senate on February 18. 1839, " provision was made for 
an astronomical obserxatory, to be erected under the direction of the 
Secretary of the Treasury upon land belonging to the United States, 
which, after its selection, should be g-ranted for the purpose and con- 
ve3'ed as a deed of gift to the trustees of the Institution. The locality 
known as Camp Hill, near the banks of the Potomac River and the 
mouth of Rock Creek, opposite Analostan Island, seems to have been 
under consideration at that time. It was the same site that Washing- 
ton had designated for the National University, and was sul^sequentl}' 
used for the object Mr. Adams had in mind, but under the direction 
of the United States Naval Establishment. 

In another bill, introduced in the Senate by Lewis F. Linn, on Feb- 
ruary 10, 1841/' it was proposed that the entire tract known as the 
Mall be appropriated for the uses of the Smithsonian Institution, with 
the provision that the buildings should be erected in accordance with 
plans prepared by and under the supervision of the National Institu- 
tion, to be approved by the President of the United States. In bills 
submitted to the same body in June and December, 1844, by the 
Library Committee, consisting of Senators Rufus Choate, Benjamin 
Tappan, and elames McP. Berrien, appeared the first detinite charac- 
terization of the building, which was to l)e placed upon a site to be 
selected in that portion of the Mall lying west of Seventh street. 

The bill for the establishment of the Smithsonian Institution which 
finally passed Congress and received the a])proval of the President on 
August 10, I84t),^' was drafted by Representative Robert Dale Owen. 
The sections relating to the site and building are quoted on pages 183 
and 184 of the introduction. 

Ui)on the organization of the Board of Regents attention in regard 
to the site seems first to have been directed toward the Mall, and here 
its location was finally established, though not without some difficul- 
ties and delay, the choice being subject to approval by the President 
of the United States, the Secretaries of State, the Treasury, War, and 
the Navy, and the Commissioner of Patents. At a meeting- of the 
Regents on September l>, 184(3, the chancellor, the Secretary, and the 

« Senate bill 293, 1839. ''Senate bill 245, 1841. f Statutes IX, 102. 



186 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 190H. 

executive committee, live in all, were con.stituted a committee on 
grounds and buildings, whose iirst report, su))mitted on November 80 
of the same year, resulted in the passage of the following resolution: 

That the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution do select and adopt as a site for 
their buildings so much of the Mall, in the city of Washington, as lies between 
Seventh street and the river Potomac, if the consent of the persons named in the 
fourth section of the act to establish the Smithsonian Institution for the increase and 
diffusion of knowledge among men be obtained thereto; and that upon such consent 
V)eing obtained in due form, the Secretary is hereby instructed to cause the said 
ground so selected to be set out by proper metes and bounds. 

On Decem])er 1 following .the Board amended the above resolution 
by adding the following clause after the word Potomac: 

Subject to the power of Congress to grant any portion of the same west of Four- 
teenth street to the Washington Monument Society for the purpose of erecting a 
monument thereon. 

As consent to this proposition was not obtained, it was resolved by 
the Regents on December 9: 

That a committee of three be appointed by the chancellor to confer with the 
President of the United States and the other persons name<l in the fourth section of 
said act, and ask their consent to the selection by said Regents of that portion of 
said reservation lying between Seventh and Twelfth streets west, in said city, as the 
site for the necessary buildings of said institution; and, if such consent be given — 

It is further resolved, That said buildings be located thereon, and at least two hun- 
dred and fifty feet south of the centre thereof. 

The committee designated consisted of Representatives Hough and 
Owen and Senator Evans, but failing in the object of their mission, 
the Board resolved, on December 23: 

That the Regents of the Smithsonian do select and appropriate as the site for 
their buildings the south half of so much of the "Mall," in the city of Washington, 
as lies between Ninth and Twelfth streets. 

The consent to this choice by the President and other persons 
"named in the fourth section of the fundamental act was conmnmicated 
to the Board on January 20, 1847, and the further provisions of the 
act were then carried out, namely : 

And the said ground so selected shall be set out by proper metes and bounds, 
and a description of the same shall be made, and recorded in a book to be provided 
for that purpose, and signed by the said Regents, or so many of them as may be 
convened at the time of their said organization; and such record, or a copy thereof, 
certified by the chancellor and Secretary of the Board of Regents, shall be received 
in evidence, in all courts, of the extent and boundaries of the lands appropriated to 
the said Institution; and upon the making of such record such site and lands shall 
be deemed and taken to be appropriated, by force of this act, to the said Institution. 

After the close of these proceedings, however, which at the time 
seemed to be conclusive and did tinally prevail, the subject of a site 
was again reopened' and led to further inquiries and considerations. 
These can best be told in the words of the late Dr. George Brown

After the present site had l)een selected there appears to have heen some dissatis- 
faction in regard to it; nor is this to be wondered at, since at that time the Mall was 
remote from the inhabited portion of the city, being a part of what was then known 
as "The Island," now called South Washington. This portion of the city was cut 
off by an old and unsightly canal running to the Potomac and crossed by simple 
wooden bridges at four 2)oints lietween the Capitol and the Potomac River. It was 
unfeneed and waste, occupied from time to time by military encampments and by 
traveling sho^nnen. After the completion of the east wing in 1850, when the first 
lectures were held in the Institution, the Regents were oljliged to build plank walks 
for the accommodation of visitors. Indeed, with the exception of the Capitol 
grounds and those surrounding the Executive Mansion, the open places in the city 
were entirely unimproved. 

Soon after the selection of the present site the question was reconsidered by the 
Board, and a committee appointed to obtain, if possible, another location. In the 
bill as it finally passed Congress permission had been given to locate the building 
on the space between the Patent Office and Seventh street, now occupied by the 
building used for the offices of the Interior Department. This was partly to enable 
the Institution to utilize for its collecti(ins the large hall in the Patent Office then 
assigned to the "National Cabinet of Curiosities," partly, no doubt, to secure a more 
central location. To obtain this ground, however, it was necessary to have the 
approval of the President of the United States and other public officials, which was 
not found practicable. The committee fixed upon Judiciary Square, an open space 
of rough ground, in which at that time the city hall (a portion of the present struc- 
ture), the infirmary, and the city jail were located. Though the adjoining streets 
were entirely vacant, this site was regarded as much more accessible than the ]\Iall. 

A proposition was submitted to the common council of the city of "Washington, 
that the site of the city hall should be resigned for the use of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution upon its offering to pay to the city $50,000, a sum deemed sufficient to erect a 
building for the use of the city government upon the site south of Pennsylvania 
avenue, between Seventh and Ninth streeis, now occupied by the Center Market. 
A bill was introduced into Congress, authorizing the Regents to purchase the city 
hall, but the common council refused to consider the proposition and the site of the 
Mall was used. 

That part of the Mall appropriated to the Institution has been known 
as the Smithsonian reservation, while to the entire square between 
Seventh street and Twelfth street, west, includino- the reservation, 
the name Smithsonian Park has been commonly applied. 

At their meetings of December 4, 184:6, and January 28, 1847, the 
Regents appropriated a total sum of $1,000 for grading, la3dng out, 
and planting the grounds of the Institution, tinder the direction of the 
building committee, which was also authorized to expend not over 
$10,000 in the construction of a permanent fence around the grounds. 
The latter, however, was erected for less than $500. 

In 1818, the building committee entered into a contract with John 
Douglas, of Washington, to the extent of $1,050 for inclosing the 
reservation with a hedge and for planting trees and shrubs. The

188 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

architect of the building marked out the paths and roads and indicated 
the positions of the trees and shrubs, to comprise about 100 species, 
principally American, The surrounding hedge was to consist on each 
of the four sides, respectivel\% of pyrocanthus, osage orange, cherokee 
rose, and hawthorn. Although considerable progress in this work 
seems to have been made during the year, the contract was considered 
not to have been properly complied with, and it was canceled in 1819. 
The same .year, for the convenience of those who attended the lec- 
tures in tlie east wing of the Smithsonian building, a walk was built 
from Seventh street to the eastern gate of the grounds and the path 
from the Twelfth Street Bridge was repaired. In speaking of the 
considerable expense which such improvements outside the reservation 
entailed upon the Institution, Secretary Henry, in his report for 1810, 
said : 

It is hoped that the authorities of the city of Washinijjtoii will cause bridges to 
be erected across the canal and walks to be constructed through the |)ublic grounds, 
to facilitate the approach to the building, and that the Institution will not 1)e expected 
to provide accommodations of this kind. 

In their report for 1850, the building committee stated that up to 
the end of that year $3,747.51 had been spent upon the grounds, and 
that probably little more expenditure on that account would be neces- 
sary. Portions of the roads about the building had been graded and 
man}' trees and siirubs set out. An appropriation having been made 
b}" Congress for the purpose, Mr. Andrew J. Downing, at the request 
of the President, was then preparing a plan for converting the entire 
Mall, including the Smithsonian grounds, into a landscape garden. If 
this plan were adopted, tiie Smithsonian lot would form part of an 
extended park, of which the Smithsonian building, by its site and 
picturesque style of architecture, would be a prominent and attractive 
feature. 

In 1851, according to the report of the same committee, the Mall 
was in course of rapid improvement under Mr. Downing, The cor- 
poration of the city appropriated $^,500 for an iron bridge across the 
canal at Tenth street, and a gravel walk was carried thence to the 
building. The Smithsonian reservation of It) acres had been inclosed 
with a fence and planted with trees at an expense to the Institution of 
about $1,000, but the execution of Mr, Downing's plan, at tlie cost 
of the General Government, would, in the view of the committee, 
render unnecessary any further disbursements by the Institution. 
Without surrendering the right of use of the reservation appropri- 
ated to the Institution, the partition fence between it and the other 
part of the Mall had been removed and the whole given in charge of 
Mr. Downing. 

Although relieved at this period, and at its own request, of the care 
and improvement of its gi-ounds, which have since remained under the 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 189 

supervision of the oflScer in charge of public grounds, the Institution 
has always maintained a deep interest in the condition of its surround- 
ings, and has in fact aided materially toward their betterment, as fre- 
quently noted in the reports of Secretary Henry and his successors. 

In 1855 Professor Henry wrote that since the death of the lamented 
Downing but little had been done to complete the general plans of the 
improvement of the Mall proposed by him and adopted by Congress, 
although an annual appropriation had been made for keeping in order 
the lot on which the Smithsonian building is situated. Regret was 
expressed that Congress had not made an appropriation to promote 
the suggestion of Dr. John Torrey and other botanists of establishing 
here an arboretum to exhibit the various ornamental trees of indi- 
genous growth in this country. 

This scheme was never more than tentatively carried out, but in 1899 
the Secretary of Agriculture revived the subject, in his annual report, 
from which the following extract is taken: 

One of the needs of the Department is an aboretnm in which can be brought 
together for study all the trees that will grow in the climate of Washington. The 
need of such an establishment was felt early in the history of the capital and was 
brought forward more than fifty years ago among the various plans proposed for the 
use of the Smithson bequest, which was finally devoted to the founding of the pres- 
ent Smithsonian Institution. In the report of the building committee of that Insti- 
tution for 1850 the following statement occurs: 

"Mr." Downing, the well-known writer on rural architecture, at the request of the 
President, is now preparing a plan for converting the whole Mall, including the 
Smithsonian grounds, into an extended landscape garden, to be traversed in different 
directions by graveled walks and carriage drives and planted with specimens, prop- 
erly labeled, of all the varieties of trees and shrubs which will flourish in this cli- 
mate." 

This admirable plan, apparently from lack of financial support from Congress, was 
never systematically prosecuted, and the plantings at first made were so neglected 
that the nurse trees themselves are now being rapidly broken down and destroyed 
by storm, disease, and decay. When the grounds of the Department of Agriculture 
were laid out, in 1868, Mr. William Saunders, then, as now, horticulturist of the 
Department, established a small arboretum commensurate with the size of the 
grounds. An arboretum in this climate, however, requires an area of several hun- 
dred acres. The time has come when the economic needs of the Department and 
the education and pleasure of the people demand a rich collection of trees planted 
so as to secure the best effects of landscape art, furnishing complete materials for 
the investigations of the Department of Agriculture, and so managed as to be a 
perennial means of botanical education. We are now engaged in introducing useful 
trees from all parts of the world, such as those producing fruits, dyes, nuts, oils, and 
tans, those useful for ornamental purposes, and especially those promising shade, 
shelter, and fuel in the arid region. 

At the present time we have no central place in which to plant and maintain a 
series of these trees for study and i)ropagation. The importations must be sent out 
as fast a they are received, without any opportunity for our investigators to make 
any observations on their behavior under cultivation, and in the case of small and 
valuable importations subjecting the whole stock to the possibility of total loss. In 
view of these conditions, I wish to bring to the attention of Congress the importance 



190 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

of placing at the disposal of this Department an area of suitable size and situation 
for a comprehensive arboretum. In order to give a si)ecific basis for considera- 
tion of this project, I suggest that the area known as the Mall be set aside for this 
purpose. 

"No part of the public domain," said Professor Henry in 1856, "is 
more used than the reservation on which the Smithsonian building 
stands, but as 3 et no special appropriation has been made by Con- 
gress for continiung the improvement of the grounds, and it is to be 
regretted that years should be suffered to pass without planting the 
trees which are in the future to add to the beauty, health, and comfort 
of the capital of the nation." In the same connection mention is made 
of the beautiful monument erected that year near the Institution by 
the American Pomological Society to the memory of Downing — a just 
tribute to the worth of one of the lienef actors of our country. The 
adoption of his ornamental plan for the ]^ul)lic parks of this city was 
in part due to the example of the Regents in embellishing the grounds 
around the Smithsonian building. 

In 1858 Professor Henry remarked that — 

The proposition to supply the public grounds with a complete series of American 
trees has long been contemplated, but as no appropriation has been made by Con- 
gress for this purpose, the Patent Office, conjointly with the Institution, has taken 
the preliminary steps by issuing a circular asking for seeds of every species of our 
forest trees and shrubs that would be likely to thrive in this latitude. This circular 
has been widely distributed, and it is hoped will meet with a favorable response from 
all who are interested in making more generally known, and in introducing into more 
extensive cultivation, the natural ornamental products of our own soil. The seeds 
are to be sent by mail to the Connnissioner of Patents and placed in charge of the 
officers having the care of the public grounds. 

In 1862 Professor Henry reported that the trees and shrubbery in 
the grounds were growing finely under the care of the commissioner 
of public grounds, 13. B. French, esq. He also called attention to 
the city canal forming the boundary of the Smithsonian grounds on the 
north, and across the basin or widest part of which most of the visi- 
tors to the Institution had to pass. This basin, 'since the introduction 
of Potomac water, had become the receptacle of the sewage of the 
city, and was then an immense cesspool, constantly emitting noxious 
effluvia prejudicial to the health and offensive to the senses of all who 
approached the locality. Certain methods of abating the nuisance were 
suggested. 

As before noted, the fence and hedge which originally marked the 
outlines of the Smithsonian reservation were removed in the time of 
Downing, thus destroying all visible traces of its limits. On the 
south this reservation is bounded by B street south, on the west by 
Twelfth street west. Its depth from B street is 759 feet 9 inches 
and its length from Twelfth street 1,086 feet 8 inches, its eastern line 
coinciding with the western line of Ninth street. Its area, therefore, 
amounts to about 825,590 square feet, or a little less than 19 acres. 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. IVU 

The Smithsonian building occupies a central position in the reserva- 
tion, its main entrance being on the axis of Tenth street extended. 
The Museum building, finished in 1881, stands 50 feet to the eastward 
of the Smithsonian ))uilding, with its front face nearly on a line with 
the rear face of the latter. It extends back to B street south, and on 
the east overreaches by about 65 feet the limits of the reservation. 
There still remains at the southwest corner of the reservation, border- 
ing on B and Twelfth streets, sufficient space for another structure of 
smaller size than the Museum building, should it ever be considered 
advisable to make such use of it, but otherwise all new buildings must 
be placed outside of the reservation. 

The Army Medical Museum, erected in 1880, at the corner of B 
and Seventh streets southwest, is the only other structure in the 
Smithsonian park, and further extensive building operations within 
this square must be carried to its northern side. Such action has been 
necessary in regard to the additional large building for the National 
Museum authorized by Congress in 1903, the center of which, like 
that of the Smithsonian building, will be on a line with the axis of 
Tenth street. 

As to the present condition of the park it ma}" be said that all traces 
of the old canal and creek have long since disappeared, and fairly 
good paths and driveways now lead to the Smithsonian and Museum 
buildings. Unfortunately, however, no improvement can be noted in 
regard to the trees and shrubs, which were to be made so prominent 
a feature. None have been planted for many years, and the older 
ones are dying out or being destroj^ed by natural causes, much injury 
having been produced by severe storms. There has been a constant 
trimming and cutting down, but no attempt to add or build up in this 
direction, and the general effect is of a park lacking care and culti- 
vation. 

THE SMITHSONIAN BUILDING. 

HISTORICAL ACCOUNT. 

In his account of the Smithsonian building and grounds, ^'^ the late 
Dr. George Brown Goode has said: 

That the Smithsonian Institution, before it could begin active, operations, must 
have a liome of its own, wcnild doul^tless have been regai-ded as a necessity by any 
one considering the requirements of tlie future. Richard Rusli, liowever, ajipears to 
have Iteen the tirst to state this idea in words, wliich lie did in a letter addressed, 
November 6, 1838, to the Secretary of State, in response to a request of the President 
for suggestions in regard to the proper manner of carrying out the bequest. * * * 

In bills introduced in the Senate in June and December, 1844, by the Library 
Committee — Rufus Choate, Benjamin Tappan, and James McP. Berrien — appeared 
the first definite characterization of the building, which was to be plain and durable, 

«The Smithsonian Institution, 1846-1896: The History of its First Half Century, 
pp. 247 et seq. 



192 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

without unnecessary ornament, and to contain provisions for cabinets of natural 
history and geology, and for a library, a chemical laboratory, and lecture rooms. 
* * * The cost was at that time limited to 180,000. In 1846, however, the bill of 
Dr. Robert Dale Owen, without change of phraseology from those which had pre- 
ceded it in regard to location and character of the structure, was adopted, but the 
limit of the cost was increased, and $242,129, the exact amount of the Smithsonian 
interest which had at that time accrued, "together with any additional interest 
which might remain after paying the current expenses of the succeeding years," was 
designated for that purpose. * * * 

From the very beginning Doctor Owen was the chief advocate of a large and 
showy building. In this matter he was supported by the sympathy of the people of 
Washington, and especially INIr. William W. Seaton, mayor of the city and one of the 
Regents, whose interest in the realization of the plan of 8mithson undoubtedly did 
much at last to secure action from Congress. Outside of Washington there was much 
opposition to an expensive building, owing partly to the manner in which the 
bequest of Stephen Girard had been rendered for many years inoperative by the 
action of its trustees. * * * Dr. Owen, nevertheless, more than any other person 
at that time concerned in the establishment of the Institution, seems to have felt 
that much of its future success depended upon the erection of a building which 
should perform a legitimate duty in dignifying and making conspicuous the work of 
the organization to which it belonged. Scarcely anyone can doubt that Doctor 
Owen was right and that the usefulness of the Smithsonian Institution has been 
materially aided by the fact that' its building has for fifty years been one of the chief 
architectural ornaments of the national capital. 

1846 and 1847. 

The first formal action of the Board of Regents, in respect to the 
building called for in the fundamental act, was the passage of a reso- 
lution on Septeml)er 9, 1846, authorizing aud instructing the Chan- 
cellor, Secretary, and executive committee — 

to take such measures as may be deemed by them most proper to obtain plans 
for the erection of buildings, fulfilling all the conditions in reference to them con- 
tained in the law organizing this institution, and that said committee report such 
plan as they may approve to this Board at its next meeting; and, further, that said 
committee specially report in regard to the best material for said buildings, and to 
the best modes of warming, lighting, and ventilating the same, with estimates of the 
cost when constructed of different materials, etc. 

The committee so organized consisted of Vice President George 
M. Dallas, chairman; Representatives William J. Hough and Robert 
Dale Owen, Gen. Joseph G. Totten, and W. W. Seaton, mayor of 
Washington. 

A notice to architects, inviting competitive designs, was published 
in the Washington newspapers of September 22, 1846, and with the 
object of accumulating information that might guide the Board in the 
choice of a plan for the building, a subcommittee, consisting of Messrs. 
Owen, Hough, and Totten, visited the principal cities of the United 
States; examined many of their most noted structures; had confer- 
ences with several eminent architects; collected specimens of the best 
stone material, and obtained data regarding the cost of construction. 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDIN(4S. 193 

This .subcommittee reported the results of their inquiries on Novem- 
ber 30, 1846. After which the full- 
committee unanimously selected out of thirteen plans that were submitted to them 
by some of the principal architects throughout the country, two by ]Mr. James Ren- 
wick, jr., of the city of New York, the architect of Grace Church, the Church of the 
Puritans, Calvary Church, and other structures in and near New York; and they 
recommended to tiie Board for adoption one of these, being a design in the later 
Norman, or, as it may, with more strict propriety, be called, the Lombard style, as 
it prevailed in Germany, Normandy, and in southern Europe in the twelfth cen- 
tury. The design comprises a center building, with two wings, connected with the 
main building l)y low ranges and a cloister. The entire front is 421 feet, and the 
extreme depth in the center, including the carriage porch, 153 feet. The height of 
the principal tower is 145 feet, and that of the main building, to the summit of the 
battlement, 58 feet. The design includes all the accommodations demanded by the 
charter, to wit: A museum, 200 feet by 50; a library, 90 feet by 50; a gallery of art, 
in the form of a T, 125 feet long; two lecture rooms, one of which is capable of con- 
taining from 800 to 1,000 persons, and the other is connected with the chemical 
laboratory; a committee room for the Board of Regents; a Secretary's room; a room 
for the effects of Mr. Bmithson; a janitor's room, etc. 

At a meeting of the Regents on January 23, 1847. the following 
resolution from the committee was brought up for consideration, but 
no action upon it was taken, namel}': 

That the Norman j^lan of a building for the Smithsonian Institution, furnished by 
James Renwick, jr., of New York, substantially as amended, agreeably to the sug- 
gestions of the committee, is approved and adopted liy this Board. 

On January- 26, 18-47, the chancellor submitted the following reso- 
lutions, Avhicli were read and laid upon the table: 

Resolved, That in view of the vast field of knowledge, to the increase and diffusion 
of w'hich the act of Congress directs the efforts and funds of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, this Board deem it inexpedient and hazardous to appropriate to the erection 
of a building a larger sum than one hundred thousand dollars. 

Resolved, That John Haviland, of Philadelphia, architect, be recjuested to state in 
writing, formally to this Board, whether he will undertake to erect a building upon 
the model of the central structure he has already planned and furnished to this 
Board, with slight changes of arrangement, which will embrace all the chief objects 
expressed in the act of Congress, for the sum of one hundred thousand dollars; said 
building to be of granite or sandstone. 

Resolved, That the committee of three, hereinafter appointed, be authorized to 
(confer with Mr. Haviland, and that, upon this Board receiving from him the written 
and formal undertaking mentioned in the foregoing resolution, they be authorized to 
engage his services as architect for the execution of his plan and to complete all the 
necessary contracts. 

Mr, Alexander D. Bache, one of the Regents, submitted to the 
Board on January 27, 1847, two resolutions of similar import, the 
consideration of both of which was deferred. One of these was as 
follows: 

Resolved, That in tlie opinion of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion it is unnecessary and inexpedient to expend, in erecting a building to meet the 
requirements of the act creating the establishment, from the principal of the fund of 
NAT >us 1903 13 



194 REPORT OP^ NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

two hundred and forty-two thouisand one hundred and twenty-nine dollars referred 
to in the first section of the act, a sum exceeding one hundred thousand dollars. 

The resolutions tinally iulopted preliminary to the work of building- 
were agreed to by the Regents on fTanuary 2S, 1847, nearly all being- 
offered by Mr. Owen. The most important follow: 

Resolved, That the Norman plan of a building for the Smithsonian Institution, 
furnished by James Renwick, jr., of New York, substantially as amended and 
reduced agreeably to the suggestions of the committee, is approved by this Board. 

Resolved, That a building committee of three members of the Board, as provided 
in the fifth section of the act of Congress, be appointed, who are hereby authorized 
and empowered, on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution, to enter into contracts for 
the completion of the buildings; and that said connnittee have jiowerto employ one 
or more persons to superintend the erection of the buildings and the fitting up of 
the rooms of the institution; and that the work shall l)e done to the entire satisfac- 
tion of the said superintendent or superintendents; and that the said superintendent 
or superintendents shall have power, and shall be required, to reject any of the 
material proposed to be employed, and also to object to inferior or insufficient work, 
and to direct its change, at his or their discretion. 

Resolved, That in the performance of the duty intrusted to them, the building com- 
mittee of three hereinbefore referred to shall give the contracts to the lowest bidder 
of good reputation, who shall give unexceptionable security, to the entire satisfac- 
tion of the committee, for the performance of said contracts; and such security shall 
in all cases be taken. No advance shall in any case be made; and fifteen per cent. 
of all payments shall be retained until the faithful performance of the work. 

Resolved, That the building committee, after taking counsel with the Secretary, 
shall carefully revise the specifications of the plan furnished to this Board by the 
architect before entering into any contract; and if, after such examination, they 
shall be of opinion that any modifications of the said plan and specifications are nec- 
essary for the safety, durability, or better adaptation of the structure, the)' may 
incorporate these in the said specifications; but no addition to the dimensions of the 
building shall be made, nor any ornament of any kind added; and the said modifi- 
cations shall have sole reference to the safety, duralnlity, and adaptation of the 
building. And the whole amount of the contract for the said building, including 
the modifications alcove provided for, shall, under no circumstances, exceed the 
amount of the original estimates of the architect, to wit: the sum of two hundred 
and two thousand dollars, with a percentage not exceeding ten per cent, on the said 
sum. 

Resolved, That the building committee be also authorized to contract for the warm- 
ing and lighting of the building; provided that the contract for the above objects 
shall not exceed five thousand dollars. 

Resolved, That the building committee be also authorized to contract for the fitting 
up and furnishing of the building of the institution; provided that the contract for 
the same shall not exceed twenty thousand dollars. * * * 

And it Ijeing on the one hand desirable that a portion of the buildings to l)e 
erected by the institution be ready for use at an early day, and on the other hand it 
is essential to the solidity and durability of a structure of the size required to 
embrace all the objects specified in the act of Congress that its erection l)e gradual 
and not too rapidly hastened forward: Therefore — 

Resolved, That the building committee be instructed to arrange the contracts for 
the buildings of the institution so that the wings of said buildings may be completed 
in two years from the ])resent time, and the whole completed in five years. 

Resolved, That the building committee be instructed, in the arrangement of the 
buildings, to extend the gallery of art throughout the western range and western

wing, and to arrange two lecture rooms, and no more, in the building. Temporary 
arrangements shall be made to receive in the west wing of the building the library 
of the Institution, until the library proper be completed. 

2. Resolved, That the building committee invite proposals for the construction of 
the exterior walls of the building of upper Potomac sandstone, of marl)le, of granite, 
and of blue gneis.s, respectively, and adopt that one of these four named materials which 
shall be deemed to combine the requisites of clieapness, beauty, and durability. 

The manner of providing for the cost of l)uildino- and other matters 
relating thereto were explained by Secretar}" Henry in his report for 
1850, in which he say.s that — 

The law of Congress incorporating the Institution, while it did not forbid the 
expenditure of a part of the income for other objects, authorized the formation of a 
library, a museum, and a gallery of art, and the erection of a building, on a liberal 
scale, for their accommodation. It was, indeed, the opinion of many that the whole 
income ought to he expended on these objects. The Regents did not consider them- 
selves at liberty to disregard the indications of Congress and the opinion expressed 
in favor of collections, and after much discussion it was finally concluded to divide 
the income into two equal parts, and after deducting the general expenses, to devote 
one-half to the active operations set forth in the plan just described and the other 
to the formation of a library, a museum, and a gallery of art. 

* * * It therefore became absolutely necessary that the income should be 
increased, and in order to do this it was proposed to save the greater part of the 
1242,000 of accrued interest which Congress had authorized to be expended in a 
building, l)y erecting at a cost not to exceed $50,000 the nucleus of an edifice which 
could Vje expanded as the wants of the Institution might require, and to add the 
remainder to the principal. 

ITnfortunately, however, for this proposition. Congress had presented to the Insti- 
tution the great museum of the exploring expedition^ and a majority of the Regents, 
sui)posing it necessary to make immediate provision for the accommodation of this 
gift, had taken preliminary .steps, previous to my appointment, to construct a large 
building, and, indeed, a majority of the committee to w hich the matter was referred 
had determined to adopt the i)lan of the present edifice. Strenuous opposition was, 
however, made to this, and as a compromise it was finally agreed to draw from the 
United States Treasury $250,000 of accrued interest, and instead of expending this 
immediately in completing the i)lan of the proposed building to invest it in Treasury 
notes, then at par, and to finish the l)uilding in the course of five years, in part out 
of the interest of these notes, in part out of the sale of a portion of them, and also in 
part out of a portion of the annual interest accruing on the original bequest. It was 
estimated that in this way, at the end of five years, besides devoting $250,000 to the 
building, the annual income of the Institution would be increased from $30,000 to 
nearly $40,000, a sum sufficient to carry out all the provisions of the programme. 

It is t(j be regretted that * * * instead of the plan of a costly building there 
had not been adopted the nucleus of a more simple edifice, which could have been 
modified to meet the wants which experience might indicate. 

The original estimate for the l)uilding, furniture, and improvement of the grounds 
was $250,000, and could the actual cost have been confined to this sum all the results 
anticipated from the scheme of finance which had been adopted would have been 
realized at the end of five years. During the past year, however, it has been found 
necessary, for the better protection of the collections, to order the fireproofing of 
the interior of the edifice, at an increased expense of $44,000. This additional draft 
on the funds can only be met by extending the time for the completion of the build- 
ing, and even this will require the appropriation of a portion of the income which 



196 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

ought to be devoted to other purposes. The active operations will suffer most by 
this draft on-the income, since it will be made for the better accommodation of the 
library and the museum. 

On February .5, 18-1:7, it was resolved by the Regents — 

That the building committee, in conjunction with the Secretary, be authorized to 
publish, in such form as they may deem most appropriate, one thousand copies of a 
brief treatise, to be entitled "Hints on Public Architecture," and to be illustrated 
with designs of the plan of the building adopted for the Smithsonian Institution, 
and, at the option of the committee, with any other designs that are the property f)f 
the Institution, provided that the cost of the same shall not exceed one thousand 
dollars, which sum is hereby appropriated for that purpose. 

This allotment was subsequently increased to $1,200. The work 
was prepared by Doctor Owen, with the assistance of Mr. Renwick, 
and was published in 1849, under the title "Hints on Public Archi- 
tecture, containing-, among other illustrations, views and plans of the 
Smithsonian Institution, together with an appendix relative to build- 
ing materials. Prepared on behalf of the Building Committee of the 
Smithsonian Institution, b}' Robert Dale Owen, Chairman of the Com- 
mittee." It is quarto in size, but does not belong to an}" of the regu- 
lar series of Smithsonian publications. 

The first building committee of three members, appointed on Feb- 
ruary 5, ISiT, consisted of Mr. Robert Dale Owen, Mr. W. W. Sea- 
ton, and Gen. Joseph jj. Totten. Changes were made in the compo- 
sition of the committee from year to year, and after a brief period 
none of its early members reiuained. Reports were submitted annu- 
ally to the Board of Regents up to the close of 1857. The w^ork of 
the committee during 1847 was extremely arduous, comprising the 
selection of the stone for the building, the preparation of specifica- 
tions, the making of contracts, etc., all of which was accomplished 
within an incredibly short space of time. Forty-one meetings were 
held during the year. 

Various marble, granite, and freestone quarries within a moderate 
distance of Washington were examined, with the gratuitous assistance 
of David Dale Owen, a brother of the regent and a prominent geolo- 
gist, and nuich information regarding them and the ([uality of their 
products was obtained. The in(iuiries embi-aced the chief marble and 
granite quarries of Maryland; the freestone quarries of Aquia Creek, 
Virginia, where the material for the older part of the Capitol, the 
White House, Treasury, and other pul)lic buildings in Washington 
had been secured; and the freestone quarries of the upper Potomac 
River, mostly in the vicinity of Seneca Creek, on the banks of the 
Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, about 28 miles above Washington. 

The mar))le (juarries of jMaiyland (mostly in the vicinity of Clarks- 
ville, about lo miles from Baltiiuore) were found to yield two (luaii- 
ties of stone — one tine grained and of excellent quality, the other 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 197 

somewhat coarse, liiohly crystalline, and inferior in quality, known as 
"alnni liniestono." 

The quarries in the neiohborhood of AN'oodstock, Mar3'land, fur- 
nished a granite equal to that of Quincy, and not excelled for beauty 
of appearance, compactness of structure, and uniformity of color, 
texture, and composition by any other granite quarries in the United 
States. There was no objection to this stone except on the score of 
expense, unless it be considered that in this material the effect of lioht 
and shade from projecting surfaces is in a measure lost, while in marble 
and good tinted freestone ever}'^ shadow is sharply marked. 

The Aquia Creek freestone was not to be trusted, ])eing pervaded 
b}' dark specks of the protoxide and peroxide of iron, which, in per- 
oxidating, acquire a yellowish or reddish color, and hav^ing occasional 
clay holes, such as disfigure the Treasury and Patent Office ))uildings. 

The freestone from the upper Potomac, in the vicinity of Seneca 
Creek, was considered the best and most durable of all the Potomac 
freestones. The lilac-gray variety found in the Bull Run quarrv, 23 
miles from Washington, was especially recommended and pronounced 
to be equal, if not superior, to that supplied for Trinity Church, New 
York, from the quarries of New Jerse3\ It has a quality that specially 
recommends it to builders. When first quarried it is comparatively 
soft, working freely before the chisel and hammer; but, by exposure, 
it gradually indurates, and ultimatelv acquires a toughness and con- 
sistency that not only enables it to resist atmospheric vicissitudes, 
but even the most severe mechanical wear and tear. It can, there- 
fore, be worked at less expense than granite or marble and was the kind 
selected for the building. 

All of the above varieties of stone were subjected to tests for dura- 
bility under exposure to the weather, etc., by Prof. Charles G. Page. 
Their cost per cubic foot, delivered in Washington, in accordance 
with the lowest prices quoted b}^ quarry owners, was as follows: 

Cents. 
L Coarse-grained marble or alum limestone, according to quality 50 to 60 

2. Fine-grained marble 70 

3. Granite 46 

4. Aquia Creek freestone 40 

5. Seneca Creek freestone, lilac-gray variety, from Bull Run quarry 20 

Bids for the construction of the building were received up to March 
15, 1817, and were opened on March IH. Several were found to be 
proposals for doing oidy a part or some jiarticular kind of the work, 
l)ut for the erection oF the entire building there were fourteen bids, 
varying in amount fiom $IVM;.()0(» to $818,000. James Dixon t'c Co., 
of Washington, were tli(> lowest bidders for S(Mieca freestone laid in 
rubble masonry, and also for ashlar finish, as follows: 

Marble ashlar $228, 500 

Seneca freestone ashlar 205, 250 



198 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

The committee decided that regularly coursed ashlar was best suited 
to the design and would make a more substantial piece of work than 
rubble. They also concluded that, with a doubt whether Seneca free- 
stone did not assort even lietter with the Lombard style of architec- 
ture adopted than marble, it was inexpedient to expend $23,000 addi- 
tional for the latter. The bid of James Dixon & Co. (consisting of 
James Dixon, of Washington, and Gilbert Cameron, of New York), 
at $205,250, was therefore accepted. Mr. Dixon retired from the 
firm on June 1, 1847. 

The contract was signed on March 19, 18-17. It included the most 
expensive part of the furniture, such as the shelving, cases, desks, 
drawers, and tables in the lal)oratory and apparatus room; the book- 
cases, large tables, and alcove desks in the library; the glass cases in 
the museum; the seats in the lecture rooms, elevators, toilet rooms, 
rain-water cisterns; the chairs and tables in the Regents' rooms, flues 
for heating and lighting, etc., but not the heating and lighting plant 
nor the drainage. 

One condition of the contract was that the work should extend 
through five 3^ears, or to March 19, 1852. It was also stipulated that 
the building should be erected in such proportions during each year 
as the conuuittee might direct, but so that the pa3uuents to the con- 
tractor in each of the first four years of the contract should not exceed 
$41,000 annually, and that the wings and connecting ranges should be 
completed in two years from the date of the contract. 

It was subsequently appended to the contract that in case the Reg^^nts 
should thereafter determine to make important alterations in the plan 
of the building or in the time of its execution, the contractor was to be 
paid pro rata according to the prices in the contract for work executed, 
and reasonable damages if the nature of the case should justly demand it. 

The architect, James Renwick, jr., who resided in New York and 
made approximately monthly visits to Washington, was paid at the 
rate of $1,800 a year, with traveling expenses amounting to about $300 
more. An assistant architect and superintendent, Mr. Robert Mills, 
was also employed on the grounds, at $1,000 a year. 

The probable cost of the building had been estimated as follows: 

Contract for building .' $281, 000 

Fitting up and furnishing 20, 000 

Warming and lighting 5, 000 

Superintendence ($3,000 annually ) 15, 000 

Drainage 1, 350 

Supplying water to building 650 

Total 273, 000 

Owing, however, to the contract being lower than was expected, and 
to other facts, the conuuittee judged that the expenditures for the 
building for the five years would amount to only about $236,000. 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 199 

The location of the building was fixed in the middle of the Smith- 
sonian reservation as to north and south, the center of the main 
structure being upon the axis of Tenth street southwest. 

Toward the close of the year 1847, as stated in the committee's 
report, the contractor was covering in the east connecting range, and 
hoped still to cover in the east wing before the frost interfered. He 
had also begun to la}" the foundations of the west wing and connecting 
range, but nothing had yet been done toward the erection of the main 
building. 

The corner stone was laid on May 1, 1847, with imposing Masonic 
ceremonies, the day being regarded in Washington in the nature of a 
public holidaj'. A procession over a mile in length, composed 
of the various lodges of Free and Accepted Masons of the District 
of Colum])ia, with a large delegation of Masons from Baltimore and 
Philadelphia, the District militia, and three militar}- bands, having 
formed at the city hall, proceeded to the Executive Mansion, where 
it was joined by the President, heads of Departments, members of 
the diplomatic corps, etc., and thence to the Smithsonian grounds. 
The marshal in chief was Mr. William Beverly Randolph. After 
prayer l\v the grand chaplain of the Grand Lodge of MarA'land, the 
ceremony of laying the stone was performed by Grand Marshal Ben- 
jamin B. French, assisted by Col. James Page and Mr. Charles Gilman, 
grand masters of Penns3dvania and Marvland, respectively. An 
address was then delivered by Hon. George M. Dallas, chancellor of 
the Board of Regents. A national salute was fired by the Columbia 
Artillery and one of the bands played a national air. The ceremonies 
closed with the benediction, pronounced b}^ Rev. Frank S. Evans. 
The gavel used and the apron worn b}^ the grand marshal were the 
same that had been used by Washington in conducting the Masonic 
ceremonies upon the la_ying of the corner stone of the national Capi- 
tol. In a cavity of the stone were deposited, in a leaden box and 
leaden casket, many articles appropriate to {he purpose, and among 
them an engraved plate, inscribed with the names of the members of 
the establishment, the officers and Board of Regents of the Institution, 
the building committee, and the architects. The ceremonies were 
witnessed by at least 6,000 or 7,000 persons. 

1848. 

At the close of 1848 the building connnittee reported that the east 
wing and adjacent range would probably be ready for occupation early 
in January. The interior of this part was at that time finished except 
the shelving of the cases for the apparatus and the furnaces and ven- 
tilating apparatus. Battlements, not in the original plan, had been 
added to the eastern cloister, as the roof seemed too conspicuous. 



200 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSETTM, 1903. 

The west wing and connecting range were completed externally, and 
the hall of the gallery of art (intended to be used teraporaril}^ for the 
library) was well advanced. Work upon the bookcases was in prog- 
ress. The foundations of the main part of the building, including 
the towers, were laid, and the superstructure carried about 5 feet 
high. The campanile, octagonal towers, and two smaller corner 
towers of the center building were 30 feet above their foundations. 

1849. 

The entire Smithsonian building, according to the annual statement 
of the building committee for 1849, was under roof before winter, the 
work having been pushed to protect the large amount of masonry and 
woodwork. The central front towers and four corner towers of the 
main ))uilding were carried up as high as the walls of that l)uilding, 
and the central rear tower 30 feet high. The work of fitting the west 
wing and connecting range for temporary library purposes was still 
in progress. The east wing was taken possession of for the uses of 
the Institution April 10, 1849. 

The following changes were made during the year: The lecture hall, 
as originally constructed, in the east wing, proving entirely too small, 
the adjoining apparatus and laboratory rooms were removed and the 
entire wing formed into one large lecture hall provided with seats for 
1,000 persons. The proposed lecture room in the lower main hall 
was given up, and the space thus obtained was divided, a room 65 ])y 
50 feet being assigned as a depository for physical apparatus, the 
remaining space being allotted to the library. The east range was to 
be used for the laboratory and working apparatus rooms, connecting 
on the one side with the lecture hall and on the other with the 
apparatus museum. 

The two stairways, which in the original plan were carried up 
between the two north front towers and the main building, were 
dispensed with and the place the}^ occupied added to the library, 
as was also the central hall, and, as before said, a portion of the 
proposed lecture hall. The space for the library was thereby nearly 
doubled in size, and the staircase was to occup}' the interior of one of 
the front towers. A clerestory to the long upper room, or museum, 
of the main l)uilding was adopted by the committee, but was never 
constructed. 

Secretary Henry's part in the above changes is thus referred to in 
his report for 1849: 

The plan of the Smithsonian building wan designed l)y the architect and recom- 
mended to the Board by a committee of the Regents before the programme of organi- 
zation was adopted. It is not strange, therefore, when the building came to be 
occiipied, that changes in the internal arrangement should be deemed advisable, 
which would better udaj^t it to the wants of the Institution. Such changes, at my

suggestion, have been made; and for the propriety of these I am responsible. They 
are [.lincipally, however, those of simplification, and in themselves add nothing to 
the cost of the edifice. An increased expense, however, will arise out of the furnish- 
ing of new rooms which have been acquired by the alterations. 

1850. 

The operations during- 1850, as shown hy the bniklincr committee's 
report, were mainly directed toward the completion of the exterior. 
The central buildino- was roofed and slated, and inclosed in such man- 
ner as to he perfectly protected from the weatliei-. The principal 
front tower was carried up to a height of 122 feet and covered in 
temporarily for the winter. The lower central tower was completed. 
The campanile and northeast corner towers were roofed in. The cen- 
tral south tower was carried to a height of 40 feet, and the southeast 
and southwest corner towers were l)uilt to the height of the cornice of 
the cell of the main building. 

At this time Secretary Henry reported on the general state of the 
finances as follows: 

After all the expenditures which have 1>een made on the building, grounds, publi- 
cations, researches, purchase of books and apparatus, not oidy is the original bequest 
untouched, but there is now on hand upward of $200,000 of accrued interest. This 
will be sufficient to finish the exterior of the building, including all the towers, the 
interior of the wings, ranges, and a part of the interior of the main edifice; which 
will afford sufficient accommodation for some years to come, and leave $150,000 to 
be added to the principal. 

On February 26, 1850, a portion of the interior framing and floors 
of that part of the main building intended to contain the museum of 
apparatus, fell into the basement, and a meeting of the building com- 
mittee was immediately called to examine into the conditions. This 
accident also led to a meeting of the Regents on March 2, at which the 
following resolution was adopted: 

Resolved, That the building committee be requested to take under consideration the 
reports of the architect, superintendent, and contractor, on the suljject of the late 
accident; that they associate with them Professor Bache, General Totten, the Secre- 
tary of the Institution, and some competent and entirely impartial architect or archi- 
tects; that they make a survey of the whole building, report the manner, faithful- 
ness, and security in which the l)uilding contract has hitherto been executed, and 
upon the i)lan most i)roper, in their estimation, to repair the damages and finish that 
portion of thi' Imildiiig in whii-h the acci.lent happened and other unfinished por- 
tions thereof. 

The committee so d(?signated reported on July 3, 1850, its principal 
conclusions and reconunendations being as follows: 

1. That the workmanship of the cut stone of tlie exterior is good, and the masonry 
generally, tliougii in some respects not of the best <iuality, is of a passable character 
with reference to the terms of the contract. 

2. That the interior of the main building is defec^tive in the kind of materials orig- 
inally adopted, and to a considerable degree in the quality of the materials employeil. 



202 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUREUM, 1903. 

These consist principally of wood, and are not of a proper character for a building 
intended to contain valuable deposits, many of which will be donations to tlie insti- 
tution, presented with the implied condition that they are to be properly secured 
against danger from fire. This mode of construction was probably adopted by the 
original building committee, in order to lessen the cost of the edifice and to !)ring it 
within the sum appropriated by the Board. 

3. Although the committee are anxious to save the accrued interest, and to devote 
it to objects more in accordance with the spirit of the original bequest than the erec- 
tion of a costly building; yet, they would recommend that the interior work of the 
center building, as now existing, be removed, and that there be substituted for it a 
fireproof structure, in accordance with the plan recommended in the reports of Mr. 
Renwick and of the commission of architects. 

4. The completion of the building on this plan, according to the estimate of the 
commission, requires an additional outlay of about $44,000. To meet this additional 
expense, the committee recommend the adoption of the suggestion of their chairman. 
Colonel Davis, that the exterior of the building and the interior of the towers be com- 
pleted in accordance with the plan and within the time specified by the contract, 
and that the remainder of the interior be finished agreeably to the new plan, in the 
course of a number of years, and in such portions as can be jiaid for out of the annual 
interest of the Smithsonian fund, not otherwise appropriated. The object of this 
part of the proposition is to prevent the derangement of the plan of finance origi- 
nally i)roposed by Doctor Bache and adopted by the Board of Regents, viz, of saving 
out of the accrued and accruing interest, after paying for the building, the sum of 
$150,000, to be added to the principal. 

5. By the addendum to the contract, the Regents have the power of stoptping the 
building at any stage of its progress on paying the contractor jjro rata for the work 
done, according to the prices specified in the contract, and allowing for reasonable 
damages if the circumstances require the payment of them. The estimates in this 
case are to be made by the architect of the institution or other architects selected 
by the Regents. But with reference to the quality of the work which has been 
done, it is the opinion of the legal adviser of the committee that the decision of the 
architect of the building is final, both with regard to the Regents and the contractor. 

6. In accordance with the forementioned stipulations of the contract, the commit- 
tee have requested Mr. Renwick to furnish an estimate pro rata for completing the 
whole exterior of the l)uilding and the interior of the towers, making deductions 
for materials and workmanship which he would have condemned had the building 
been completed according to the original plan. The following is tlie decision of the 
architect, which has been agreed to by the contractor, with the understanding 
that nothing is to be paid him on account of profit on work omitted by the proposed 
change, viz: 

For finishing the whole exterior of the building, all the interior rooms of 

the towers and of the wings, the sum of $18.5, 154 

7. The committee recommend to the Board of Regents that they agree to this 
proposition, and that a resolution be adopted directing the contractor to proceed with 
the work in accordance therewith. In recommending this course to the Board, the 
committee act in conformity with the advice of two of the commission of architects, 
viz: Mr. E. B. White and Mr. J. R. Niernsee, who undertook the examination in 
detail of the parts of the building, and gave an estimate as the basis of an eciuitable 
settlement. 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 203 

8. By adopting the above sum of $185,154 as the amount to be paid to the con- 
tractor, Mr. Renwick gives the followiiig estimate of the cost of finishing the building 
in accordance with the fireproof plan, viz: 

Amount of proposed contract. |185, 154 

Expense of fireproofing the entire (;enter building according to plans and 

estimates of the architects 44, 000 

Expenses common to both plans: 

Plastering center building $8, 000 

Gallery fronts ^ 2, 000 

Staircase of library and Museum 425 

Furniture of librarj' and Museum 4, 700 

15,125 

Extra cartage 200 

Materials now on the grfnind, but which may not be useil 1, 000 

Total expense of the building, including fireproofing 245, 479 

9. The original contract, with the addition made to it by direction of the 

building committee, is 209, 810 

Add the estimate of fireproofing 44, 000 

Thus we have for the cost of the building, according to the estimate 
of the commission 253, 810 

Note. — The foregoing estimates are exclusive of the salaries of the architect and 
superintendent; also of the cost of the improvement of the grounds and part of the 
furniture. 

This last sum is greater than the preceding by $8,331. The difference, according 
to the statement of Mr. Renwick, is due to the various deductions he has made on 
account of defective materials, imperfect workmanship, and changes in the plan. 

In conclusion, the committee are fully of opinion — and in this they are sustained 
by the commission of architects — that, by adopting the plan of fire-proofing proposed 
by Mr. Renwick and the proposition of the contractor, the building will be ren- 
dered safe and durable at a very reasonable cost, considering the amount of work 
which has been bestowed upon it. 

The committee do not consider it necessary to offer any remarks on the cause of the 
accident which led to these investigations. If these recommendations be adopted, 
the whole structure of the interior of the main building in which the accident 
occurred will be exchanged for one more in accordance with the permanence and 
utility of the edifice, and in this case they will consider the accident as a fortunate 
event. 

1851. 

In view of the report of the special committee followino- the acci- 
dent in 1S,50, the Regents found it necessary to deviate from their 
origitud intention, and to order the removal of the woodwork which 
had been erected in the interior of the main build ing and dii-ect that 
its place be supplied I)}' fireproof materials. During LS51 all the exte- 
rior of the building, including the towers, was completed. Some 
minor changes in interior construction, insuring l)etter tireprooting, 
was also arranged for. 

At a meeting of the Regents on Febniary 27, 1851, it was resolved 
that the executive committee be requested to incpiin' into the feasi- 
bility of providing buildings for the residences of the officers of the 



204 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Institution on the Smithsonian gronnds or other convenient location, 
and, if they deem expedient, to report plans and estimates for such 
buildings to the Board at their next meeting. The reply of the execu- 
tive committee, made on May 1, 1852, was as follows : 

That after due reflection they liave come to the conclusion that it would conduce 
very much to the interests of the Institution if the officers were provided with 
houses on the Smithsonian grounds, so that they might be present on all occasions 
and be as much as possible at all times identified witli the operations of the Institu- 
tion; yet at present, while the main edifice is unfinished, they do not consider it 
advisable to incur the expense of additional buildings, and would therefore recom- 
mend that in lieu of the rent of a house $500 be added to the salaries of Professors 
Jewett and Baird, to be paid from the ])eginning of the present year. 

1852. 

In this year the contract with Gilbert Cameron, including the linish- 
ing of the exterior of the entire building and the interior of the winos, 
connecting ranges, and towers, was declared completed, leaving the 
whole interior of the main building to be linished. All the woodwork 
and plastering of the interior of the main building was, by resolution 
of the Board, to be removed and its place supplied by fireproof mate- 
rials. Mr. Renwick withdrew his services, as it was not thought best 
to continue his salary, and Capt. B. S. Alexander, U. S. Corps of 
Engineers, was employed to prepare detailed drawings and plans for 
the balance of the work. 

Referring to this subject in his report for 1852, Secretary Henry 
wrote : 

From the report of the building committee it appears that the contract for finishing 
the interior of the wings and ranges and the rooms of the towers has been completed. 
The whole interior of the main building, comprising a rectangular space of 200 feet 
long, 50 wide, and about 60 high, remains to be finished with fireproof materials. 
It is proposed to divide this space into two stories and a basement. These stories 
will be devoted to the library, the museum, and a large and convenient lecture 
room. 

The business of the Institution would be much facilitated were this part of the 
building completed. Since Congress has authorized the establishment of a library 
and museum, it will be well to place all the objects of interest to the public in the 
main building and make this exclusively the show part of the establishment, devot- 
ing the wings and ranges and rooms of tlie towers to the Inisiness operations and 
other purposes of the Institution. In the present condition of affairs there is no part 
of the edifice to which the public has not access, and, consequently, business has to ])e 
transacted amidst constant interruptions. The loss of time and effective life to which 
all are exposed who occupy a position of notoriety in the city of Washington is truly 
lamentable, and where this is enhanced by facility of access to gratify mere curiosity 
the evil becomes scarcely endurable. Progress in business under such circumstances 
can only be made by an encroachment on the hours usually allotted to rest, and 
that, too, at the expense of wasted energies and shortened days. 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 205 

1853. 

Mr. Gilbert Cameron was given the contract for completing the 
structure in accordance with his previous terms, and the building- 
committee kept constantly in view the idea of rendering the main 
building entirel}' fireproof and of constructing it in the most durable 
and substantial manner. These changes of arrangements delayed 
work until June 13, 1853, from which time onward it was actively 
prosecuted. The committee found great ditiiculty in deciding upon 
a proper position and plan of a large lecture room, but finally con- 
cluded to place it in the second story in the middle of the main build- 
ing, where the greatest width could be obtained. 

1854. 

At the close of 1851 the building committee reported that the main 
or center building was finished, with the exception of a few unim- 
portant additions. Many changes had been required for the better 
security and adaptation of the building, and they involved an addi- 
tional expense. 

1855. 

During this year the entire edifice was completed, and the final 
report of the architect was approved by the committee. The follow- 
ing account of the interior of the building at this time is taken from 
Secretary Henry's report for 1855, with some annotations from the 
report of the building committee: 

The building is at length completed, and its several apartments are now in a c-on- 
dition to be applied to the uses of the Institution. As various changes have been 
made in the original plan, the following brief description may not l)e inappropriate at 
this time. It consists of a main edifice, two wings, two connecting ranges, four large 
projecting towers, and several smaller ones. Its extreme length from east to west is 
447 feet, with a breadth varying from 49 feet to 160 feet. The interior of the east 
wing is separated into two stories, the upper of which is divided into a suite of rooms 
for the accommodation of the family of the Secretary. The lower story principally 
comprises a large single room,« at present appropriated to the storage of publications 
and the reception and distribution of books connected with the system of exchange. 
The upper story of the easteVn connecting range is divided into a numl)er of small 
apartments devoted to the operations in natural history, and the lower story is fitted 
up as a working Ial)oratory. 

The interior of the main edifice is 200 feet long by 50 feet wide^ and consists of 
two stories and a basement. The upper story is divided into a lecture room capable 
of holding 2,000 persons '' and into two additional rooms, one on either side, each 50 

« Seventy-five feet by 45 feet. 

*And 60 feet high from the basement floor to the upper ceiling. 

<'The lecture room, the optical and acoustic properties of which are probably 
unsurpassed by any apartment intended for the same purpose in the United States, 
occupies one- half of the upper story of the main building, besides a portion of the 
front and rear towers. Its precise length is 96 feet and extreme width 62 feet. It 
will comfortably seat 1,500 persons, and when crowded will contain upward of 2,000. 



206 iip:port of national museum, 1903. 

feet square, one of which is appropriated to a musenni of apparatus and the other, 
at present, to a gallery of art. Both are occasionally used as minor lecture rooms 
and for the meetings of scientific, educational, or industrial associations. 

The lower story of the main building consists of one large hall, to be appropriated 
to a museum or a library. It is at present unoccupied, but will be brought into use 
as soon as the means are provided for furnishing it with proper cases for containing 
the objects to which it may be appropriated. « 

The ])asen)ent of this portion of the building is used as a lumber room and as a 
receptacle for fuel. 

The west wing is at present occupied as a library, and is sufficiently large to 
accommodate all the books which will probably be received during the next ten 
years. The west connecting range is appropriated to a reading room. 

The principal towers are divided into stories, and thus furnish a large number of 
rooms of different sizes, which will all come into use in the varied operations of the 
Institution. A large room in the main south tower is appropriated to the meetings 
of the "Establishment" and the Board of Regents; three rooms in one range, in the 
main front towers, are used as offices; and two rooms below, in the same towers, are 
occupied by one of the assistants and the janitor; other rooms in the towers are used 
for drawing, engraving, and workshops. There are in the whole building, of all 
sizes, 90 different apartments; of these 8 are of a large size, and are intended for 
public exhibitions. 

The delay in finishing the building has not only been attended with advantage in 
husbanding the funds, but also in allowing a more complete adaptation of the inte- 
rior to the purposes of the Institution. It is surely better, in the construction of 
such an edifice, to imitate the example of the mollusk, who, in fashioning his shell, 
adapts it to the form and dimensions of his V)ody, rather than that of another animal 
who forces himself into a house intended for a different occupant. The first point 
to be settled in commencing a building is the uses to which it is to be applied. 
This, however, could not be definitely ascertained at the beginning of the Institution, 
and hence the next wisest step to that of not commencing to build immediately was 
to defer the completion of the structure until the plan of operations and the wants of 
the establishment were more precisely known. 

* * * The whole amount expended on the building, grounds, and objects con- 
nected with them is f318,727.01. This exceeds considerately the original estimate 
and the limit which was at first adopted by the Regents. 

The excess has been principally oi'casioned by substituting fire-proof materials for 
the interior of the main l)uilding instead of wood and plaster, which were originally 
intended. 

* * * We should not forget that the ordinary expenses of the Institution have 
constantly increased, and that, while the nominal income has remained the same, 
the value of money has depreciated; and, consequently, the capability of the original 

«The ceiling is supported by two rows of columns extending the whole length. At 
the middle of the space corresponding to the principal entrances are two wing walls, 
by which, with the addition of screens, the whole space may be divided into two 
large rooms, with a hall extending across the building between them. This story 
may be used for a library or a museum, or for both, as the wants of the Institution 
may require. It is finished in a simple but chaste style and has received general 
commendation. Indeed, it is, perhaps, in appearance one of the most imposing 
rooms in this country, apart from adaptation to its purposes. The floor through 
the middle part is formed of cut stone, that of the other parts is of wood, which, 
resting on the arches beneath, without space between to contain air, is considered 
sufliciently fireproof and not subject to dampness from the variation of temperature 
9,nd humidity of the atmosphere.

bequest to produce results has been abridged in a corresponding proportion. Besides, 
when the l)uilding is entirely occupied, the expense of warming, attendance, etc., 
must necessarily be much increased beyond its present amount. The repairs, on 
account of the peculiar style of architecture adopted, will ever be a heavy item of 
expenditure. The several pinnacles, buttresses, and intersecting roofs all afford 
points of peculiar exposure to the injuries of the weather. 

1857. 

In 1857 the building- committee stated that at its last session Congress 
had appropriated $15,000 for cases for the collections belonging to the 
Government. These were then finished and formed a beautiful addi- 
tion to the large hall on the first floor, being apparently well adapted 
to the purpose intended. The west wing, devoted to the librar}-, had 
been furnished with alcoves and a gallery extending around three 
sides of the room, an arrangement serving to increase greatly the 
accommodation and security of the books. 

No report was made by the building committee after this year. 

1858. 
In his report for 1858 Secretary Henry states that — 

In order to increase the capacity of the large room appropriated to the collection, 
the cases have been arranged in two stories, forming a series of alcoves and a gallery 
on each side. By the adoption of this plan space can lie provided for douljle the 

number of specimens which were exhibited at the Patent Office. 

******* 

Comparatively few repairs have been required during the past year on the 1)uild- 
ing, though the changes which have been necessary to accommodate the increasing 
operations of the Institution have involved considerable expense. The corridors, 
which were entirely open to the northwest wind, have been inclosed with glazed 
sashes; a large amount of space has thus been rendered available, and a considerable 
jiortion of the interior of the building protected from the inclemency of the weather. 

During this 3^ear the (jovernment collections at the Patent Office 
were transferred to the lower main hall of the Smithsonian building, 
in accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress of August 
10, 1816. 

FIRE OF 1865, AND RESTORATION OF THE BUILDING. 

On Janiuuy 21, 1865, the building of the Smithsonian Institution 
was visited by a destructive fire, which burned out the upper story of 
the main building and the large towers at the north and south 
entrances. The following account of this disaster is taken from Sec- 
retar}^ Henry's report for 1865: 

The most important event of 1865 was the destruction of a part of the building and 
its contents by the fire of January 24. This event must continue to form an epoch 
in the history of the Institution; and though it can not but be considered a most 
serious disaster, it may yet lead to changes of importance in the correction of ten- 
dencies which might ultimately have al)sorl)ed the aimual income and neutralized 
the more liberal policy which has thus far iH'en pursued. In view, tiierefore, of tiie 
character of the event, as v.ell as the continuity of the history, it is deemed expe-

client, before proceeding with an account of the operations: of the year, to repeat 
triefly the facts connected with the origin and results of the tire. 

It may be well, however, for the better information of those not acquainted with 
the Smithsonian building, to premise in regard to it the following particulars: It 
consists of a main edifice 200 feet long and 50 wide, with two large wings and two 
connecting ranges, having in all an extreme length, in an east and west direction, 
of 450 feet. In front and rear of the middle portion are projections, terminated l)y 
high towers, two on the north and one on the south side; moreover, on each corner 
of the middle building is a smaller tower, and also one on each of the two wings. 

The whole of the first story of the main building, in a single room, is devoted to 
tlie museum; the upper story, in three apartments, was assigned to the lecture room, 
the gallery of art, and the cabinet of apparatus. The west wing is entirely appro- 
priated to the library; the east wing to the residence of the Secretary and a store- 
room for publications and specimens of natural history. The east connecting range 
contains the laboratory and office rooms; the west range is an extension of the 
museum. In the large towers were the Regents' room, the offices of the Secretary, 
storerooms, and workshop. 

Though the original jjlan was mucli admired for its architectural effect, it was 
soon found that, in relation to the means at the disposal of the building committee, 
it was too expensive to admit in its construction of the exclusive use of fire-proof 
materials; hence, while the exterior was to be constructed of cut freestone, it was 
concluded to finish the interior in wood and stucco. Fortunately, this plan, which 
was carried out in regard to the wings, the connecting ranges, and the towers, was 
abandoned before the completion of the main building. After the exterior of this, 
including the roof, had been finished and the framing of the interior was in place, 
the latter suddenly gave way and was precipitated into tlie cellar — a mass of broken 
timber. The attention of the Regents having been called by this accident to the 
insecurity of the woodwork, they directed that the further progress of the building 
should be stopped until means could be accumulated for finishing the remainder of 
the edifice in a more stable manner and with fire-proof materials. In accordance 
with this direction, after an interval of several years, the construction was recom- 
menced under the direction of Capt. (now Gen. ) B. S. Alexander, of the Engineer 
Corps, and the whole of the main building, except the inside of the towers and the 
framing of the roof, which had previously been completed, was finished in a sub- 
stantial manner in iron and brick work. The architect advised the removal of the 
roof, but as this would have swelled the cost of the l)uilding still further beyond the 
estimate and the means at connnand, and as the covering was of slate, the framing 
under it was thought to be in no danger from fire. This, however, was destined to 
be the part on which the first attack of the element was to be made. Through a 
mistake in some workmen, the i)ipe of a stove which had been temporarily used in 
one of the ui)per rooms was introduced through the wall into a furring space resem- 
l)ling a Hue, but which discharged the heated air from the combu.stion into the loft 
immediately under the roof, instead of into the air through the true chimney. « 



^Previous to the fire the large room partly occupied by the Stanley collection of 
Indian portraits had been fitted out with about 200 feet of cases around the walls to 
receive the ethnological specimens in the possession of the Institution. While 
engaged in rearranging the pictures above these cases, the workmen, with a view to 
their own comfort, unfortunately placed the pipe of a stove in a ventilating flue 
which opened under the roof, and thus caused the conflagration which destroyed 
the ujjper part of the main building. Fortunately, none of the ethnological articles 
had been placed in this room, and consequently these specimens, with those of the, 
nuiseum and of the general collections, have been preserved. (Secretary Henry. 
Report for 1864, p. 31. ) 



NATIONAL Ml'SEUM BUILDINGS. 209 

The rafteri^ were net on lire, and before the burning was discovered tlie entire wood- 
work under the covering was in flames. The progress of tlie fire was so rapid that 
but few of the contents of the upper rooms could be removed before the roof fell in. 
The flames soon extended to the large towers, and, as these acted as high chimneys, 
they greatly increased the intensity of the combustion. The conflagration was only 
stayed by the incoml)ustible materials of the main building. Had the original plan 
of constructing the interior of the edifice in wood and plaster been fully carried out, 
the whole structure would have been destroyed and the valuable library and rich 
collections of specimens of natural history entirely lost. 

The aperture which deceived the workmen was probably made ])y those who origi- 
nally plastered the building. It occupied a middle point between two windows, and 
from its position would naturally lead to the infei'ence that it was designed to con- 
duct the products of combustion directly into the chimney, from which it was only 
separated by the thickness of a single brick. For what reason it had not been 
placed in the middle between the two windows is unknown. It is remembered that 
some ten years previous to the fire this opening was during several weeks* used for 
the insertion of a stove pipe, without suspicion of accident at the time; but in the 
interval the wood had undergone a process of drying which rendered it more com- 
Inistible. 

Constantly impressed with the fact that the interior of the two w'ings and the con- 
necting ranges were constructed of combustible material, I have always felt great 
anxiety on account of the liability to conflagration of these parts of the building. 
The rest of the edifice, with the exception of the interior of the towers, was sup- 
posed to be secure from injury of this nature. A night watch was constantly kept, 
barrels and buckets filled with water were placed at suitable points, and strict rules 
were adopted prohibiting the carrying of exposed lights, as well as the practice of 
smoking, in any part of the edifice. That these precautions were unavailing has been 
seen, the fire having been communicated at a point where danger was least sus- 
pected, and in a manner which rendered its occurrence sooner or later almost 
inevitable. 

The weather at the time was extremely cold, and before the engines could be 
brought into operation the whole of the roof was in flames. Commencing at the 
west end of the center building, the flames were driven by the wind, which blew 
from that direction eastwardly, and, fortunately, away from the library, in the west 
wing. The destruction of the roof of the main building involved that of the con- 
tents of the rooms immediately beneath it and also those of the three principal 
towers adjacent. In the former were the Indian portrait gallery, the lecture room, 
an<l the apparatus room. The first of these contained the large collection of paint- 
ings by Mr. Stanley and a series of Indian portraits belonging to the Government. 
The lecture room was constructed on acoustic and optical principles, and not only 
answered perfectly the ends for which it was immediately intended, but had served 
also as a model for lecture rooms in various parts of the country. The apparatus 
room contained the principal part of the articles presented by the late Dr. Robert 
Hare, and a large number of instruments of recent construction intended both for 
ilhistrationand original research. 

The losses in the south tower were, first, the contents of the Regents' room, 
including the personal effects of Smithson; second, those of a large room above it, in 
which were stored the private library of Reverend Doctor Johns, of \'irginia, and the 
public library of Beaufort, South Carolina, deposited thereat the request of Hon. Mr. 
Stanton, for preservation until the end of the war; and, third, in the attic, a targe col- 
le(;tion of public documents and i-omplete sets of the Smithsonian Reports, intended 
for distribution. The effects of Smithson had but little intrinsic value, and were 
chiefly prized as mementos of the founder of the Institution. They consisted of a 
number of articles of chemical and physical apparatus, such as were used by him in 

NAT MLS 1903 14 



210 REPORT OB^ NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

his perambulatory excursions, two small cabinets of minute specimens of minerals, 
a silver-plated dinner service, and a trunk tilled with manuscripts. The portrait 
of Smithson while a student at Oxford, a medallion likeness of him in bronze, his 
library, consisting of 1 50 volumes, and a small jiainting were saved. The marmscripts 
consisted principally of notes on scraps of paper, intended apparently for alphabetical 
arrangement in a commonplace book, after the manner of a philosophical dictionary. 

The losses in the north towers were the contents of the offices of the Secretary, 
including the records and copies of the correspondence of the Institution, the wood- 
cuts to illustrate the publications, the steel plates of an expensive memoir, several 
boxes of stereotyi)e plates, a large number of manuscripts of the Secretary on scien- 
tific subjects, four memoirs accepted for publication, about a hundred volumes of 
valuable books fi-om the library, used for constant and immediate reference; a large 
number of copies of the Smithsonian Reports and (lu])licate documents; the contents 
of the workshop, consisting of a lathe, forge, a full set of tools, and an assortment of 
hardware and materials for the construction and repair of apparatus; and of the 
upper ro'om of the highest tower, including the clockwork of an anemometer for 
recording the direction and force of the wdnd. Not only was this instrument itself 
lost, but all the records which had been obtained by the use of it for the last seven 
years. Fortunately, nearly all the other meteorological records, which were in a 
lower room, were saved. 

The Indian portraits, as far as they were the likenesses of particular individuals, in 
most cases can never be reproduced, but we are gratified to learn that the extensive 
collection of Mr. Catlin of a similar character has been purchased in Europe by Mr. 
Harrison, of Philadelphia, and will be rendered accessible to the student of ethnology. 
Besides this, there are in existence, particularly in Canada, other portraits sufficient 
in number and variety fully to illustrate the characteristics of the race. At the same 
time the loss has fallen very heavily upon Mr. Stanley, the painter and owner of 
this collection. It was the result of the labor of many years among the Indians; it 
constituted the pride, as it has been the crowning effort, of his life, and he ardently 
desired that it might be transmitted to posterity as a monument of his enterprise and 
industry. The ho^je is entertained that the Government will see fit to give him an 
order to paint a picture for the Capitol, in which the principal figures of this collec- 
tion and the characteristics of the Indian race may be portrayed. 

The apparatus presented by Doctor Hare was interesting on account of its associa- 
tion with the history of the advance of science in this country. The collection con- 
tained most of the articles invented by the donor, and which are described in the 
scientific journals of the first half of the present century. Among the chemical 
implements were those used by that distinguished chenust in procuring for the first 
time, without the aid of galvanism, calcium, the metallic basis of lime. A number 
of the articles of apparatus presented by Doctor Hare, though injured by the fire, 
may be repaired, and I have taken measures for their restoration. 

Among the articles of historic interest which were lost is the lens used by Priest- 
ley for the evolution of oxygen from the oxide of mercury, and by means of which 
the first distinct recognition of this elementary substance was effected. It had been 
presented to the Institution ])y the nephew of the celebrated philosopher, as was 
also the apparatus employed by Priestley in his experiments on bodies in condensed 
atmospheres. The latter was but slightly injured and can readily be repaired. The 
other articles of apparatus may be replaced at an expense of about $10,000. 

The most irreparable loss was that of the records, consisting of the official, scien- 
tific, and miscellaneous correspondence, embracing 35,000 pages of copied letters 
which had been sent, at least 30,000 of w^hich were the composition of the Secretary, 
and 50,000 pages of letters received by the Institution; the receipts for publications 
and specimens; reports on various subjects which have been referred to the Institu- 
tion; the records of experiments instituted l)y the Secretary for the Governmeiit; 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 211 

four manuscrii)ts of original imx'stigations which had Ijeuu adopti'd by the Instilii- 
tion for pubhcation; a large number of papers and scientific notes of the Secretary; 
a series of diaries and memorandum and account ])ooks. Fortunately, however, a 
detailed history of the general operations of the Institution is preserved in the 
printed reports, and a large amount of correspondence connected with natural his- 
tory and meteorology was saved. 

Since the occurrence of the fire all the operations have been carried on in the lower 
story of the east wing of the building (the upper part still continuing to be the resi- 
dence of the Secretary) and in the several rooms of the adjoining east range. Con- 
nected with an office in the latter, the lower story of the tower attached to the 
southeast corner of the main building has been converted into a fireproof vault, in 
which all the valuable papers and records are constantly kept, except for the usually 
short time they are required for consultation. To insure the wakefulness and fidelity 
of the watchmen we have introduced the use of an instrument called a "detector," 
which records the number and the times of his visits to the several parts of the 
building. For this instrument, which has rendered good service during the past 
year, we are indebted to the liberalitv of its inventor, Mr. J. E. Bauerk, of Boston, 
who, in consideration of the loss which the Institution has sustained by fire, kindly 
presented it free of charge. 

A circumstantial account is given by the building committee of what has been 
done toward the reconstruction of the edifice. From this it will l)e seen that the 
plan adopted contemplates not merely the repair of the damage by the fire, but the 
restoration of the several parts in firejiroof materials, and with such alterations in 
the division of the interior space as will better adaj)t it to the uses of the Institution. 

The plans have been jirepared and the work superintended l)y 'Mr. Adolph Cluss, 
an architect who v,-as w'armly recommended by the mayor of Washington as having 
been successful in designing and erecting the public schoolhouses of the city, as well 
as a number of churches and other buildings. These plans have been critically 
examined and, in some cases, modified by the chairman of the building committee. 
General Uelafield, who, by his knowledge and experience in the line of engineering, 
has rendered the Institution valuable service. 

No appropriation has yet been made by Congress to aid in the restoration of the 
building. Considering, however, the large amount of Government property intrusted 
to the care of the Institution, it can scarcely be doubted that in a normal condition 
of the national finances, an appropriation for such purpose would have been readily 
granted. 

In consideration of the extraordinary outlay required for the reconstruction of the 
building, an effort has been made to reduce as much as possible the miscellaneous 
expenses, and to engage in no enterprise that is not absolutely necessary to the con- 
tinuance of the general operations. So many articles, however, of furniture and 
stores of hardware and stationery were to be replaced that we have not Iwen able to 
reduce the expenditures to as low a point as we could wish; yet it will be seen that 
they fall somewhat below those of the preceding year. * * ^ 

The cost of the restoration of the building in fireproof materials without changing 
the external appearance has, as formerly stated, been far greater than was antici- 
pated. Whether the portion of the work yet to be executed will much exceed in 
cost that which has already been completed will depend upon the price of materials 
and of labor. The Institution may in time be able to finish this work without 
encroaching on its present capital, provided the Secretary of the Treasury shall 
recognize the inadetjuacy of the i)ayments of interest whii'h for three years were 
made in the depreciated currency of the time. If this allowance be not made and 
no as;?istance be received from Congress, then, in order to secure the l)uildiiig and 
its contents from injury by the weather the Institution will be obliged to sacrifice a 



212 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

portion of its extra fund, and to the extent of this forever diminish its power to 
"increase and diffuse knowledge among men." 

* * * As the public museum of the Institution occupied the portion of the 
l)uilding constructed of fireproof materials, it escaped destruction by the fire, yet the 
smoke and water to which they were exposed caused some damage to the specimens, 
and much labor and expense were requisite to restore them to their proper appear- 
ance. 

The report of Secretary Henry immediately following the tire con- 
tains some important statements, which, though made before those 
aboA'e quoted, can better supplement them. They are partly as 
follows: 

Although greatly to be regretted on account of the losses incurred, the accident is 
not without compensation in considerations of a different nature; thus it has served 
to call forth the expression of a large amount of kind feeling in regard to the Institu- 
tion and to direct the attention of Congress to the character and importance of its 
operations. 

* * * Two grave errors were committed in the adoption of the present one 
[building] ; first, the plan was but little adapted to the uses to which the edifice was 
to be applied; second, the style of architecture recjuired a far greater expenditure 
than the amount to which the cost of the building was limited. For the purpose of 
architectural effect the interior was very inconveniently divided. The buttresses, 
turrets, and towers, while they add very little to the accommodation of the building, 
greatly increased the cost. To have constructed the building in a substantial 
and durable manner in strict conformity with the Lombard style of architecture, 
which was adopted, would have required an expenditure of at least double the 
amount of the sum appropriated for the purpose. It was therefore necessary, in 
order that the exterior might be constructed of freestone, that the interior should be 
finished in wood and stucco, and that thus recourse should l)e had to the presenta- 
tion of a falsehood to the eye in the very inauguration of an enterprise for the 
advancement of truth. The two wings and the two connecting ranges were com- 
pleted in this manner. The main building, which is 200 feet long and 50 feet wide, 
embellished with six towers, was also in process of completion, the framing of the 
interior having been finished, when the underpinning gave way and the whole of 
the woodwork fell to the ground. 

After the occurrence of this accident a commission of architects appointed to 
examine the building reported that the exterior walls were well built, both in 
regard to construction and materials, but that the plan of finishing the interior 
in wood and stucco was improper for an edifice intended to contain valuable articles. 
It was therefore recommended that fireproof materials should be employed for the 
portions of the work which remained to be constructed. In conformity with this 
recommendation the interior of the main building was completed in iron, stone, and 
brick, with the exception of the roof, which, being covered with slate and not sup- 
posed to be exposed to danger from fire, was suffered to remain. It was this change 
in the mode of constructing a portion of the edifice which, during the late fire, saved 
the contents of the whole from destruction. It however increased the cost of the 
building to upward of $300,000, leaving the remaining parts of the interior of the 
structure in perishable materials. 

* * * Nothing definite can be said at present as to the financial arrangements 
for the repair of the building. The subject is still before Congress, and although the 
idea has been confidently entertained that an appropriation would be made for the 
purpose, yet, from the discussion Avhich took place in the meeting of the joint com- 
mittee of the two Houses ap])ointed to consider this matter, I do not think a resolu- 
tion authorizing such an appropriation wall be adopted. 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 213 

The first meeting of the Regents after the fire was hold on -lanuar}^ 
1^8, 1865, liaving been caUcHl principally in consiMiiuMU'O ol" that event. 
The Secretary' presented a brief account of the lire, and of the stejw 
immediately taken, through the Secretary of War, to place a tempo- 
rary roof over the main building. This work was done under the 
Quartermaster's Department of the Army, which furnished the neces- 
sary materials and men, the expense being subsetj-uentl}^ refunded by 
the Institution. This roof w^as adequate to protect the building fioni 
storms without interfering with the construction of a permaniMit 
covering. 

It was announced that the committees on Public Buildings and 
Grounds of both the Senate and House had already been directed to 
inquire into the origin of the lire, the approximate loss to the Gov- 
ernment and to private persons, the means necessary to preserve the 
remaining portions, etc. In anticipation of the work of these com- 
mittees it was thought advisable that a special committee be appointed 
to report directly to the Board, Mr. R. Wallach, a Regent, and Pro- 
fessor Henry, the Secretary, being designated as such committee, 
under the following resolution : 

That a committee be appointed to inquire into the origin of the fire, to ascertain 
the extent and character of the loss sustained, and to make suggestions as to what 
measures should be adopted for the. repair and improvement of the building. 

The report of this committee, submitted at a Board meeting on 
February 2, 1865, after reciting the origin of the fire and explaining 
the losses sustained (amounting, besides the damage to the building, 
to about $20,000 for the Institution and $26,000 for individuals), as 
well as the parts saved from injury, all of which have been sufliciently 
described above, made the following suggestions as to what they con- 
sidered should be done. 

There can be no hesitation in adopting the conclusion that steps should be imme- 
diately taken not only to repair the injury, but to improve the condition of the 
building. 

1. The main edifice should be provided with a metallic roof. 

2. For the wooden conical terminations of the towers should be substituted metallic 
coverings. 

.3. All valuable articles belonging to the Institution or deposited in it, including 
the library, should be placed in the main building, which should 1)e cut off from the 
wings by iron doors. 

4. Provision sliould l)o ma<le for a thorough heating of tlie whoie building by steam 
or hot water. 

5. Suggestions should be requested from competent arcliitects and engineers as to 
work to be done, and those which are adopted should be eml)odied in working i)lans 
and drawings. 

6. A building committee of the Board should be appointed to have charge of the 
work. 

No very exact estimate can as yet be made as to the cost of the repairs, etc., for it 
has not been possible, without erecting a scaffolding, to determine whether it will be

necessary to take down the high northern tower. Colonel Alexander, of the Engineer 
Corps, however, has informed the committee that he thinks $100,000 will be required 
to make the necessary repairs and improvements. 

The committee can not conclude without adding that, in their opinion, the occur- 
rence of the fire ought not to l)e allowed to interfere with the active operations of 
the Institution, on whicli essentially depends the reputation it has established 
throughout the world and its efficiency as an instnunent for "the increase and dif- 
fusion of knowledge among men." To the support and extension of these opera- 
tions, therefore, the annual interest from the original fund should, as far as possible, 
continue as heretofore to be conscientiously applied. 

At the same meeting measures were discussed for the repair and 
improvement of the building", and the opinion was expressed by the 
Congressional Regents present that an appropriation for the purpose 
would be made by Congress without opposition, ))ut such relief was 
not obtained. 

The joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, 
above referred to, made its report to Congress on Februar}^ 21, 1865, 
after visiting the building, having adopted the report of the Smith- 
sonian committee. At a subsequent meeting of the joint Congressional 
committee Secretary Henry was requested to describe his connection 
with the Institution, to give an account of its objects and operations, 
the origin of the building, and such other facts as might be of public 
interest. Secretary Henry's statement, together with the report of 
the committees and of the testimony, were printed conjointly as Senate 
Report No. 129, Thirty-eighth Congress, second session, February, 
1865. 

At a meeting held on March 1, 1865, it was resolved by the Regents: 
"That the whole subject of the repairs and reconstruction of the 
building * * * be intrusted to the Chancellor, the Secretary, and 
the executive committee." This committee reported annually during 
the three years from 1866 to 1868, inclusive, and the following extracts 
are from that source: 

1865. The first step toward the reconstru(;tion of the building was to secure the 
services of a competent person as architect and engineer to prepare plans and super- 
intend the work. For this purpose Mr. Adolph Cluss, who had designed and 
directed the building of the principal schoolhouses of the city, was employed. 

The next thing to be done was the making of a critical survey to ascertain the 
actual state of the walls, and to determine what parts it was necessary first to rebuild. 
This survey forced uj)on the committee the conviction that the original construction 
of the building, as a whole, was very defective, and, in many respects, unsuited as a 
receptacle of records and other valuable articles, the loss of which could never be 
repaired. The exterior of all the walls consists of a facing of red sandstone, bound 
to an irregular backing of l)]uestone of verj^ bad workmanship. In the main build- 
ing and in the lower jiortion of the large south tower was inserted a 4-inch brick 
lining separated by an air space from the main walls. This lining is not bound to 
the walls, and, therefore, does not add to their strength. It is merely a furring, 
intended to prevent dampness by the condensation of moisture from the atmosphere. 
This furring is open at the toj), and it was into this Ihat (he stovepipe was inserted 



NATIONAL MUSEUM — BUILDINGS. 215 

which led to the accident l)y fire. In all the other rooms of the towers the plaster- 
ing was upon the rough rubble work. 

The heavy projecting cornice of the south tower was mereh^ set in place without 
fastening, and, consequently, could not withstand any disturbing action. 

The parts of the building which were not injured by fire, namely, the two wings 
and connecting ranges, as far as the committee have had the opportunity of examin- 
ing, are defective in materials and construction. The floors, in some cases, though 
covered with flagging and filled in with deafening, rest upon 1)eams of pine wood, 
which is decayed, and in the course of a iew years the interior of these parts will 
recjnire renewal. 

It is proper to state that the foregoing remarks on the character of the materials 
and the construction of the building are not applicable to the work on the main edi- 
fice, subsequently executed under the superintendence of Gapt. (now General) B. S. 
Alexander, of the United States Engineers. This work, which principally consisted 
in the arching of the basement and the main story of the upper building, was exe- 
cuted in fireproof materials and prevented the extension of the fire, and, conse- 
(]nently, the destruction of the entire edifice and all its contents. 

From the foregoing account of the original construction of the building, it will not 
be surjirising that the effect of the fire was found to be much more serious tlian pre- 
\i()us to tliis survey it had been su]iposed, and that the work to be done could not 
be confined to the mere repairing of the injury caused by the fire, but would include 
also the rebuilding of a considerable part of the edifice; and this was particularly the 
case on account of the decision of the Board that the restoration should be in all 
parts indestructible by fire. 

The heavy projecting cornice of the south tower had fallen down, in part, and the 
remainder was unfit to receive a new roof. 

The high brick columns, extending from the cellar to the eaves of the main building, 
and supporting the northern wall of the south tower, were so nuich damaged l)y the 
fire as to require to be removed, and consequently, with them the above-mentioned 
wall itself. The lining of the upper story of the main building was also so much 
injured that the greater portion of this will require renewal. But the most unstable 
portion of the building, and that which gave rise to most anxiety, was the prin- 
cipal northern tower. This, which is 140 feet high, starts from a square base, and 
is gradually transformed into a regular octagon of smaller dimensions. Four sides 
of this octagon rest upon the sides of the original square, but jtroject into the inte- 
rior, while its other four sides extend diagonally across the angles of the square, 
and are supported by rough and imperfect corbel work, consisting of masses of blue- 
stone very seriously affected by the fire. The tower was originally divided into a 
series of stories by transverse wooden beams and plank floors, which were entirely 
destroyed. The anxiety in regard to this tower was increased by observing a vertical 
crack extending a considerable portion of the height of the tower, but whether this 
had previously been produced by unequal settling, and had merely been increased 
by the unequal expansion of the exterior and interior walls, due to the fire, or 
entirely produced l)y the latter cause, could not be definitely ascertained. As this 
part of the building imperatively demanded innnediate care, the architect was 
dii-ected to give it his first attention. After a due consideration of its then present 
condition and its future use as a receptacle of iieavy articles, it was considered neces- 
sary to erect within it a lining of solid brickwork 9 inches thick, laid in cement, 
from the bottom to the top, firndy unite<l to the original wall, and serving as the 
support to iron beams of the brick floor. And, furthermore, it was concluded to fill 
up in brickwork a numl)er of the high, narrow windows in each story, which would 
add to the strength of the structure without affecting externally its architectural 
appearance. 



21(» REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

A ^liiiiilar eonstriu-tioii was directed in the otlier principal nortli tower, and the 
work in Imtli lias l)een executed in such a manner as to give assurance that these 
])arts of the building will not merely be restored, but will also be rendered more 
stable than they were before the conflagration. The crack above mentioned has been 
found, by the undisturbed condition of a thin stratum of plaster placed over it, to 
have remained the same, and the walls, for several months previous and during the 
winter, have not undergone any perceptible change. 

While the work immediately required for the safety of the front towers was in 
progress, plans were discussed and prepared for the interior of these as well as for 
that of the south tower, with a view to their better adaptation to the wants of the 
establishment. 

The original plan of the building included four principal staircases leading to the 
upper story of the edifice, one on each side of the north entrance, and a similar 
arrangement on the right and another on the left of the south entrance. As these 
occupied a large portion of useful space, it was thought best to increase the size of 
those at the north entrance, dispense with those on the southern, and so arrange the 
heights of the stories of all the towers as to render them more available for the 
])usiness operations of the estal)lishment. 

The work which has been done on the southern tower consists in the removal of 
the north wall and a considerable part of the upper portion of the other three walls; 
the preparation of a part of the freestone, from which to reconstruct the exterior 
wall; the greater portion of the l)rickwork of the basement, and the furnishing of 
the cast-iron columns intended to replace the brick piers which supported the 
northern wall of this tower. * * * 

This temporary roof, covered with felt saturated with tar, has served the purpose 
intended. It will, however, rapidly deteriorate, and, consequently, the first object 
of the committee, during the coming season, will be to decide on the character of 
the roof, and to hasten its completion as rapidly as the work can properly l)e 
accomplished. 

In the restoration of the building the committee have been governed by the 
following considerations: 

First. To render the work entirely stable, both in regard to material and mode of 
construction. 

Second. To render it thoroughly fireproof. 

Third. In view of the great cost at present of material and workmanship, and the 
condition of the funds of the Institution, at first to do such work as should be 
necessary to preserve the stabiUty of the several parts of the building, and prevent 
injury to the property by the weather. * * * 

1866. The restoration of the building has been prosecuted during the last year as 
rapidly as the funds at the disposal of the committee and the character of the work 
would permit. * * * 

The large south tower was so much injured that 30 feet of the upper portion had 
to be taken down and rebuilt, the cost of which was much enhanced by the neces- 
sity of recutting a large amount of new stone for the facing. This tower has been 
divided into six stories, affording as many large rooms, the lower for an extension 
of the museum, an upper one for the meetings of the Kegents, and the others for 
storage, etc. The offices for the accommodation of the Secretary and assistants will 
be in the nothern tow'ers and connecting space. 

The principal access to the second story of the main Iniilding is l)y two large iron 
staircases, one on either side of the northern entrance. These have been completed. 

All the towers and connections with the main building have been covered with 
substantial roofs. After much inquiry and personal investigation, it was concluded 
to adopt the plan for the roof of tiie main Iniilding of wronght-iron framing and slate 



NATIONAL MTf^EUM Hl'ILDINfiM. 217 

covering, the latter secured in place by wire to iron |iur]incs and pointed iniderneath 
b}' a coating of cement. 

The inside lining of the walls of the .second story of tiie })nilding, which had l)een 
much injured by the fire, has ])een removed and its place supplied by a new 9-inch 
brick wall laid in cement, securely tied, and clamped to the outer stonework. 

The chairman of the committee has given personal attention to the work in its 
progress and can state from actual knowledge that the plans, material, and work- 
manship are of a satisfactory character, alike creditable tf> the talents and careful 
supervision of Mr. Cluss, the architect. 

1867. Jt was statetl in the report presented to tlu- Boanl at its last sessi(in that it 
was proposed, during the year 18B7, to roof the main building and towers and finish 
the interior of all the rooms, halls, staircases, and )nain entrance, leaving the large 
room of the upper story over the museum unfinished until funds could be provided 
for the purpose and its future use be determined. 

In accordance witli this proposition the ironwork of the roof over the museum 
was erected early in the spring, and covered with slate, fastened to the iron purlines 
with wire and jylastered inside witli wall plaster. The iron gutters, as well as the 
roof, were found perfectly secure from leakage during the hardest summer rains. 
The severe test of ice and snow during the present winter has-shown the necessity 
for additions in the arrangements for conducting the water from the roof. Plans for 
this purpose are now under discussion with the architect for persevering in the orig- 
inal plan, or adopting some additional security that the late severe season has indi- 
cated to be advisable. 

The adaptation of new to old work in restoring the building from the destructive 
effects of the fire by substituting incombustible materials for wooden partitions, 
floors, and roofs, has been attended, as was foreseen, with much labor and expense, 
as well as making additional means indispensable for rendering the roof surfaces, 
valleys, and gutters water-tight in winter, when covered with snow and occasionally 
ice, as well as the summer rains. Like the public l)uildings generally in this citv 
(and we may say elsewhere) where Ijattlements extend above the eaves, with gutters 
behind them upon the roof, or resting upon the walls, much inconvenience, and at 
times damage, arises from leaks the result of such a system. It is experienced in 
the Smithsonian building in consequence of the stone battlements capping all its 
exterior walls. The present architect's original design, approved by the committee, 
is set forth in his report of the operations of the year annexed hereto. Neither 
time nor the funds of the Institution would permit his carrying this part of his plan 
into operation; and until it is done, together with some additions that the late 
inclement season has pointed out as advisable and necessary, the building is not 
secure, nor the property within it, from dampness and moisture. 

The introduction of the propo.sed warming apparatus for all the apartments is 
the next most essential particular to be undertaken, to he commenced whenever the 
funds of the Institution will justify. 

The security of the several apartments and contents are in a great measure depend- 
ent upon such an apparatus as a substitute for the stoves temporarily in use, and for 
which no permanent smoke flues or other arrangements were jirovided. 

All the rooms in the north tower, forming three suites of three in each, with two 
rooms on the entrance floor, one for the janitor and the other for a reception room 
for visitors, have been completi'd and are now used and occupied as offices for con- 
ducting the operations of the Institution. The several apartments in this north 
tower above these offices have also been completed. The rooms and apartments in 
the south tower have also been finished and are now occupied. The lower one, or 
that on the first floor, forms a part of the general museum and is now devoted to the 
reception of the larger and most weighty articles of ethnology, such as the stone 
images from Central America and the stone sarcophagus from Syria. 



218 REPORT OE^ NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

The apartments on tlie next story have been fitted up with shelves, bins, and other 
fixtures for the transaction of the business of the hterary and scientific exchanges, 
j)acking and distributing the same. 

Tiie apartments next above have been finished for the meetings and convenience 
of the Board of Regents, and tliose on the three remaining floors have also been fin- 
ished and appropriated to storage and sucli otlier purposes as may become necessary. 
In this tower are also provided an elevator with convenient mechanical power for 
removing books, specimens, etc., to and from the basement and four stories above 
it, etc. * * * 

To increase the accommodation two additional floors have been added to the 
original subdivision of the stories of the north and south towers. To furnish ligiit to 
the new rooms in the south tower, circular windows have been opened through the 
walls, without interfering with the original architectural effect of the exterior, thus 
furnishing sufficient liglit for the purpose for which these apartments are intended. 

The cost of the roconstructioti during 1865, 18(56, and 1867 amounted 
to $119,528.01, all of which was paid from Smithsonian funds, except 
the sum of $8,883.69 taken from the Congressional appropriation for 
the preservation of the Government collections. 

At the Regents'' meeting of January 27, 1868, it was resolved that 
the great hall of the second story of the building and such other rooms 
as are not required for the regular operations of the Institution be 
devoted to the preservation of the scientitic collections. It should l)e 
explained in this connection that before this time the library of the 
Institution had been transferred to the Library of Congress, thus 
increasing the amount of space available for museum purposes. 

A resolution was also adopted at the same meeting that a committee 
be appointed to report to the Regents at their next meeting what 
amount of appropriation should l)e asked of Congress for the care of 
the Museum and for fitting up the great hall for the safe-keeping and 
exhibition of specimens. Ofi May 1, 1868, as a result of this action 
the following tnemorial was presented to Congress: 

To the honorable the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress asseinhled: 

In behalf of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, the undersigned' 
beg leave respectfully to submit to your honorable body the following statement, 
and to solicit such action in regard to it as may be deemed just and proper: 

******* 
It is true that Congress, at the time the specimens were transferred to the Institu- 
tion, granted an appropriation of $4,000 for their care and preservation, that being 
the ecpiivatent of the estimated cost of the maintenance of these collections in the 
Patent Office, where they had previously been exhibited. But this sum, from the 
rise in |)rices and the exj^ansion of the museum by the specimens obtained from 
about fifty exploring expeditions ordered by Congress, scarcely more than defrays 
at the present time one-third of the annual expense. In this estimate no account is 
taken of the rent of the part of the louilding devoted to the museum of the (iovern- 
ment, which at a moderate estimate would be $20,000 per annum. 

Besides the large expenditure which has already been made on the liuilding, at 
least $50,000 more will be required to finish the large hall in the second story, 
necessary for the full display of the specimens of the Government. But the Regents 
do not think it judicious further to emiiarrass the active operations for several years 
to come by devoting a large part of the income to this object, and have therefore

concluded to allow this room to remain unfinisheil until other means are provided 
for comjileting it. 

It is not by its castellated l)uilding nor the exhibition of the museum of the Gov- 
ernment that the Institution has achieved its present reputation, nor by the collec- 
tion and display of material objects of any kind that it has viudicated the intelligence 
and good faith of the Government in the administration of the trust. It is by its 
explorations, its researches, its publications, its distribution of specimens, and its 
exchanges, constituting it an active, living organization, that it has rendered itself 
favorably known in every part of the civilized world, has made contributions to 
almost every branch of science, and brought more tlian ever l)efore into intimate 
and friendly relations the Old and New Worlds. 

******* 

The Board of Regents are confident that upon a full consideration of the case, your 
honorable body will grant an adecjuate support for the collections of the Govern- 
ment, and also an ap})roi)riati()n for finishing the repairs of the building. 

******* 

In conclusion, your memorialists beg leave to represent on behalf of the Board of 
Regents that the usual annual appropriation of |4,000 is wholly inadequate to the 
cost of preparing, preserving, and exhibiting the specimens, the actual expenditure 
for that purpose in 1867 having been over ?12,000; and they take the liberty of 
respectfully urging on your honorable body the expediency of increasing it to 
$10,000, and that a further sum of $25,000 be appropriated at this session of Congress 
toward the completion of the hall required for the Government collections. 

And your memorialists will ever pray, etc. 

S. P. Chase, 
Chancellor Smithsonian Institution. 
Joseph Henry, 
Secretary Smithsonian Institution. 

In his report for the same and the succeeding- ^^ear. Secretary 
Henry explained that the only exhibition rooms to which the general 
public had had admission since the fire were the large hall on the first 
floor of the main building and the adjoining apartment in the south 
tower. This large hall, containing rich collections in ornithology and 
ethnology, presented to the eye a succession of large pillars, which 
obstructed the view of the cases. In fitting up the room of corre- 
sponding dimensions in the second story, an opportunity would be 
afforded of adopting arrangements far better suited for a comprehen- 
sive display of the vast number of objects with which in time it would 
be furnished, as it was intended that the ceiling of this hall should be 
attached to the long iron girders which span the space from wall to 
wall, thus obviating the necessity for introducing cohnnns. In addi- 
tion to the above the west connecting range was provided in 1868 with 
cases for ethnological specimens and opened to the pubJc in 1869. 
The west wing was at this time temporaril}^ appropriated to the alco- 
holic specimens and miscellaneous purposes. 

During each of the years 1870 and 1871, Congress appropriated 
110,000 for the fitting up of the large second-stor}- room and other 
work of reconstruction. Those sums, together with about $9,000 from 



220 REPORT OB^ NATIONAL MUSEUM, 190:^. 

the income of the Smithsonian fund, |25>,00() in all, were expended for 
that purpose in the latter year. 

A readjustment of quarters in the Smithsonian buildinjj- was 
announced by Secretary Heniy in his report for 1871, as follows: 

Arrangements have been made for appropriating the east wing and range to the 
business which may be considered as belonging exclusively to the essential objects 
of tlie Institution, and devoting the main building, west wing, and towers to the 
Museum. For this purpose the large room on the first floor of the east wing, which 
was formerly used as a museum laboratory and storeroom, has been fitted up with 
bins and conveniences for assorting and packing the literary and scientific exchanges 
to be sent to foreign countries. Preparation has also been made for removing the 
chemical laboratory from the first floor of the east range to the space immediately 
below it in the basement, and for applying the whole of the first floor of this part 
of the building to the business offices of the Secretary and his assistants in the line 
of what are called the "active operations." 

For the special accommodation of the Museum the large room in the west wing, 
formerly occupied by the library, has been prepared for the reception of cases for 
mineralogical and geological specimens, while the great hall, 200 feet by 50, in the 
second story of the main building, has been completed and is now ready to receive 
the cases for the anthropological and other specimens. 

Estimates are now before Congress for fitting up these rooms with cases for the 
reception and display of the Government collections, and it is hoped that in the 
next report we shall be able to chronicle the commencement, if not the completion, 
of the work. 

The changes consequent upon the extension of the Museum mentioned made a 
rearrangement necessary of the greater part of the basement, so as to obtain addi- 
tional security against fire and greater convenience for the storage of fuel, packing 
boxes, and specimens. A floor was laid through the basement, and new passage- 
ways opened, furnishing better access from one extreme of the building to the other. 
In introducing the fireproof floor into the west wing, advantage was taken of the 
opportunity to increase the height of the room below it, and to convert it and the 
adjoining rooms in the west range into laboratories and storerooms for natural 
history. 

Furthermore, for better security, the fireproofing of the floors of the four towers 
on the corners of the main building has been commenced. The rooms in the towers 
furnish studies and dormitories for the investigators in the line of natural history 
who resort to the Institution, especially during the winter, to enjoy the use of the 
library and the collections for special researches. 

******* 

For defraying the exi)enses of the care and exhibition of the National Museum, 
Congress has annually, for the last two years, appropriated $10,000. Although this 
appropriation was more than double that of previous years, still it fell short of the 
actual expenditure. The amount of items chargeable to the Museum during the past 
year, independent of the rent which might have been charged for the rooms occu- 
pied, or for repairs of the building, was a little more than $13,000. Deducting from 
this sum the $10,000 appropriated by Congress, there remains $3,000, which was paid 
from the income of the Smithson fund. 

A statement of this deficiency has been presented to Congress, and we trust that 
the sum of $15,000 will be appropriated for the same purpose for the ensuing fiscal 
year. 

By the completion of the large room in the second story and the appropriation of 
the west wing and connecting range to the same purpose, the space allotted to the 



Report of U. 5. National Museunr., 1 903.— Rathbun. 



Plate 7. 




NATIONAL MUSEirM BUILDINGS. 221 

Museum in the Smithson building has been increased to about threefold. It is pro- 
posed, as was stated in the last report, to devote the room in the west wing to speci- 
mens of geology and mineralogy, and the large room in the second story to specimens 
of archaeology and paleontology. As preparatory to the fitting up of these rooms, 
a series of designs has bt'en prepared at the expense of the Institution l)y B. Water- 
house Hawkins, the well-known restorer of the ancient animals which illustrate the 
paleontology of the Sydenham Palace, near London. 

ALTERATIONS AND REPAIRS SUBSEQUENT TO 1877. 

On December 10, 1877, the President of the United States trans- 
mitted to Congress the report of a commission, consisting of Lieut. 
Col. Thomas L. Casey, U. S. Army, the Supervising Architect of the 
Treasur}^,^ and the Architect of the Capitol, appointed b}^ him on 
September 27, 1877, to examine the several public buildings in this 
city and determine the nature and extent of their security against 
conflagrations and the measures to be taken to guard the buildings 
and their contents from destruction or damage by fire. This com- 
mission recommended in respect to the Smithsonian building that — 

All the combustible materials used in the construction of the museum portion of 
the building should be removed and the parts renewed of fireproof construction, 
and the openings connecting with other parts of the building should be supplied 
with fireproof doors. 

On the same date the Secretary of the Interior submitted to Con- 
gress an estimate "to provide additional security against tire in the 
Smithsonian building for the Government collections, $3,000," and on 
March 27, 1878, Secretary Henry wrote as follows to Senator A. A. 
Sargent: 

I have the honor to inform you that shortly after the fire at the Patent Office the 
Smithsonian building was visited by the Government committee of inspection and 
suggestions made by them as to the fireproofing of the portion of the edifice devoted 
to the collections of the National Museum. These suggestions were at once acted 
upon, at an expense of $2,803.29, as per detailed memorandum herewith, and I 
write to beg that you will kindly consider the propriety of having an item intro- 
duced into the deficiency bill whereby the Smithson fund may be reimbursed for this 
outlay. 

The action taken was described as follows: 

Attention having been specially called to the condition of the public buildings in 
this city on account of the destruction by fire of part of the Patent Office, it was 
deemed advisable to give additional security to the valual)le collections deposited in 
the Smithsonian edifice. The main building, which contains the National Museum, 
is entirely fireproof, but the connecting ranges and the two wings are not so. It 
was therefore highly desirable that the main building should be entirely isolated 
from the ranges and wings. For this purpose the large windows facing the wings 
were bricked up and all the doorways leading from the museum into the ranges 
either bricked up or fitted with iron instead of wooden doors. The carpenter's and 
machinist's shops were removed to the main basement and inclosed in brick walls. 
The storage rooms were made fireproof by replacing wooden partitions and fioors 
by those of brick. In the high central tower brick partitions have been constructed 
on the stairways, to prevent the passage of fire from one story to another. 



222 REPORT (»F NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Secretary Baird also refers to this subject as follows in his report 

for 1880: 

The Smithsonian building was one of those carefully examined )jy the commis- 
sion, and it was recommended that iron doors should be placed in the passageways 
between certain rooms. An appropriation of $3,000 was subsequently « made by 
Congress for this purpose; and a contract for its execution was accordingly entered 
into with Mr. George L. Damon, of Boston. After considerable delay in the per- 
formance of this contract, the doors were delivered and put in place by Mr. Damon, 
to the entire satisfaction of the executive committee. This arrangement has greatly 
promoted the safety of the building and its contents from the risk of the spreading of 
any fires which might accidentally occur within its walls. A few additional changes 
are still desirable to give still further security to the public property placed in the 
charge of the Institution. 

In his report for 1879 Secretary Baird writes that during- the year 
other alterations had been made in order to increase the efficiency of 
the building and reduce the expense of superintendence and mainte- 
nance. The document room had been enlarged and refitted. The east- 
ern wing, formerly used by Secretary Henry as a residence, had been 
converted into a series of offices. Eleven large fireproof doors had 
been placed in the building to isolate the different wings and floors. 
The laboratory had been rearranged and many other improvements 
made, and it was believed that the building was then in a condition of 
thorough efficiency and adaptation to its scientific purposes. 

In each succeeding report mention is made of necessary repairs and 
alterations of greater or less extent, at the cost of the Smithsonian 
fund, but the annual expenditure for these purposes was generally 
small. Secretary Baird reported in 1881 that — 

At no distant time some expensive work of renovation will be required upon the 
ceiling of the great hall in the second story of the main building, as in some places 
the plaster appears in danger of falling off and injuring the cases and specimens on 
exhibition below. 

In 1882 somewhat extensive changes were made at the west end of 
the building. The basement under the west wing, which had pre- 
viously been occupied indiscriminately for the preservation and elabo- 
ration of the collection of birds and fishes, was subdivided, and each 
subject confined strictly to its own section. 

The western corridor was also at this time fitted up as an exhibition 
hall for fishes. 

At the meeting of the Board of Regents held January 18, 1882. 
Secretary Baird called attention to the combustible and insecure con- 
dition of the eastern portion of the Smithsonian building, and pre- 
sented plans, prepared at his request by the architects, Messrs. Cluss 
& Schuize, which, without materially changing the architecture of 
the building, would provide largely increased accommodations for 



a Sundry civil act for 1880. 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 223 

offices and workrooms, the storage of publications, the exchange 
system, etc. 

The Board unanimously adopted a resolution, instructing the Secre- 
tar}' and executive committee to present the subject to Congress and 
request an appropriation for the purpose. The Secretary, in accord- 
ance with this instruction, sent the following letter on the 13th of 
March to the Speaker of the House of Representatives: 

Hon. J. W. Keifek, 

Speaker of the House of Representatives. 

Sir: By instruction of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, I have 
the honor to transmit to Congress the following resolution, adopted at the last meet- 
ing of the Board, January 18, 1882, and, in doing so, beg that it be referred to the 
appropriate committee of the House of Representatives and receive that attention 
which the urgency of the case requires: 

"Resolved, That the Secretary and executive committee present a memorial to 
Congress showing the importance and necessity of rendering the east wing of the 
Smithsonian building fireproof, requesting an appropriation therefor, and, if the 
means are furnished, to proceed with the work." 

It will be remembered that in Januarj', 1865, a fire occurred in the Smithsonian 
building, which destroyed a large portion of the main edifice, with its adjacent 
towers, and a very large amount of valuable public and private property. 

The main building was restored with fireproof materials, but the east wing, composed 
entirely of wood and plaster, and which had escaped injury, remains in its previous 
dangerous condition. Originall}' a lecture room, it was fitted up many years ago 
with apartments for the residence of the late Secretary and his familj-. This applica- 
tion of the wing, however, was discontinued after Professor Henry's death; but the 
rooms thus set apart are entirely unsuited to the operations of the establishment, 
and, while in every way objectionable, the timbers have decayed and no arrange- 
ments are provided for proper lighting, heating, and ventilation. 

The main building and western extension are occupied by tiie collections of the 
Government; the east wing embraces the offices of the Secretary, chief clerk, corre- 
sponding clerk, and registrar, and also accommodations for the extensive operations 
of the department of international exchanges, the benefits of which accrue not only 
principally to the Librarj' of Congress, but to all the public lil)raries and scientific 
societies throughout the United States. The rooms are filled with the archives, files 
of correspondence, original scientific manuscripts, vouchers, the stock of Government 
and Smithsonian publications for distribution at home and aljroad, etc., and their 
destruction by fire, to which they are constantly exposed, would he greatly detri- 
mental to the interests of the Government and the general pulilic. 

In addition to this, an extensive fire in the east wing would endanger and possibly 
destroy the main portion of the Smithsonian building, the upper and lower halls of 
which contain rare specimens belonging to the Government, and most of which 
could not be replaced. 

Congress has recognized the importance and propriety of gradually reconstructing 
the interior of the Smithsonian building, in fireproof materials, by making appro- 
})riations for the purpose at various times between 1870 and 1875; and the last Con- 
gress, in 1879, appropriated 8;?, 000 "for providing additional security against fire in 
the Smithsonian building." 

It is now proposed to remodel the interior of the east wing, so that without dis- 
turbing its present architectural stylo, the internal capacity will be doubled by a new 
arrangement of floors, partitions, and roofs, and all the rooms be adapted to the etli-

to its management l)y Congress. 

Inclosed I beg to send a copy of the report of the board of fire inspectors (appointed 
by the District Connnissioners) upon the condition of the Smithsonian building. I 
have the honor to ask, in the name and on behalf of the Board of Kegents that the 
following a2)propriation l)c made at the present session of Congress, viz, " For con- 
tinuing and coinjileting the tireprooting of the Smithsonian Institution, $50,000."

Gentlemen: The commission to inspect buildings in the District beg leave to sub- 
mit herewith report No. 5. 

By invitation of Professor Baird, the east wing and connecting corridor to the main 
building of the Smithsonian Institution was visited and Inspected. In this portion 
of the building are all the records and valuable documents belonging to the Institu- 
tion. The interior is entirely of wood and illy arranged, making it especially unsafe 
and liable to accident from tire, thus endangering the entire building. As a matter 
of safety, this wing and corrider should be completely cleared out and rebuilt of fire- 
proof material and furnished with improved modes of communication and egress. 
Official extract furnished Prof. S. F. Baird.

The above memorial received favorable consideration by the Forty- 
seventh Congress, resulting in the passage of the following item in the 
sundry civil act for 1884: 

For completing the reconstruction, in a fireproof manner, of the interior of the 
eastern portion of the Smithsonian Institution, $50,000. (Stat. XXII, 628.) 

The preparation of plans, the details of construction, etc., were 
placed in charge of Messrs. Cluss & Schuize, architects. Proposals 
were asked and the bids opened on April 26, 1883. The removal of 
the contents of the east wing and corridor was soon eli'ected, the offices 
of clerks and others were transferred to the large adjacent exhibition 
hall, and accommodations for storage were provided ])y the erection of 
a temporary shed on the south side of the Smithsonian building. 

In 1883 Secretary Baird reported that — 

The appropriation was found sufficient to secure the fireprooting of the building, 
but a number of other desirable objects remain to be secured, such as a heating 
apparatus, a passenger elevator, a freight lift; the introduction of speaking tubes, 
electric l:)ells, telephones, a concrete floor in the basement, an underground communi- 
cation between the Smithsonian and the new Museum buildings, etc., for which an 
additional appropriation of $15,000 has been asked. 

Two subsequent appropriations were granted by Congress with 
reference to these changes, as follows: 

For finishing, heating, gas fitting, plumbing, and comj)letely furnishing the eastern 
portion of the Smithsonian Institution, and for finishing the fourth and fifth stories, 
including liabilities already incurred, $15,000. (Sundry civil act for 18S5. )

For rniisliin>j and completing th(^ furnii^hing of the eastern portion of the Smithso- 
nian Institution huililing, $5,600. (Sundry civil act for 1886.) 

In his report for 1884 Secretary Baird announced the expenditure 
of the appropriation of $15,000 in fitting up the two upper stories of 
the building-, which had been necessarily left unfinished for lack of 
funds. This included the introduction of iron furring and iron lathing 
for the ceilings immediately under the roof, and the fitting up of many 
of the rooms for their special requirements. The rooms in the recon- 
structed portion were then all occupied for the general purposes of 
the Institution, notably the departments of administration, of interna- 
tional and miscellaneous exchanges, of the reference library, of trans- 
portation, and of publication, the chemical laboratory, etc. 

In transferring the offices back to the east end considerable changes 
were made in the lower hall of the main building, including the 
removal of all exhibition cases in the galleries, which have since been 
used exclusively for laboratory and storage purposes by several 
departments of zoolog3\ Telephones, speaking tubes, an accurate 
time service, and other minor conveniences were also introduced at the 
eastern end. 

The report of the Secretary for 1885 notes the completion of the 
alterations in the east wing and corridor in a thoroughl}^ fireproof 
manner, with twice the original number of available oflice rooms, and 
with every facility for doing the work mentioned in the best possible 
manner. It also calls attention to the unsightl}' and dilapidated con- 
dition of the remainder of the building, used by the Museum, which 
will soon require extensive repairs. 

In accordance with estimates subuiitted, the sundry civil act for 
1888 provided "for urgent and necessary repairs to central and west- 
ern portions of the Smithsonian Institution building, $15,000." In a 
letter to the chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, 
dated December 11, 1886, and in his annual report for 1887, Secretary 
Baird explained the reasons for the proposed changes, stating that 
the floors, ceilings, and roof of the west corridor were the same as in 
the original construction and not fireproof, being in fact very com- 
Inistible. Nearly all of the large alcoholic collections of the National 
Museum and the Fish Commission were in or adjacent to this part of 
the building, so that should a fire break out it would result not only in 
serious damage to the building, but also in the entire destruction of 
extensive and valuable portions of the national collections. He also 
called attention to the fact that, though the Smithsonian building was 
constructed at the expense of the Smithsonian fund, it had since 1858 
been almost wholly given over to the purposes of the l^ational 
Museum. 

NAT MUS 1903 15 



226 KEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Tlie firoproofino- was intrusted to Messrs. Cluss & Schulze, archi- 
tcets, from whoso report the following- account of the work is taken. 

The reconstruction extended over the curtain l)et\veen the main l)nil(hn.<; and the 
west wing, a ])uil(Hn<!: of GO feet in length and 54 feet in width, with an adjoining 
turret containing stairs. It contains a basement where alcoliolic specimens are 
kept. 

The main story is mostly occupied by an exhil)ition hall, extending up into the 
roof, with a clerestory. Along the north front was originally an open cloister, 
which had been for many years temporarily fitted up by framework for offices. 

Permanent provision was made for these purposes, and a mezzanine story formed 
liy the insertion of a fireproof upper floor. 

Besides the old, rotten, cond)ustible floors and roofs, a complicated system of 
decorative hollow columns and vaults, framed of wooden scantlings, boards, and 
lathed plastering, had to be carefully removed, so as not to injure the outside walls, 
consisting of a thin cut-stone facing, backed by ordinary rul^blework. 

In the reconstruction the Romanesque general character of the building was pre- 
served with the greatest simplicity compatible with the surroundings, and also made 
a necessity by the limited appropriation in conjunction with the increased cost of 
decorations in the fireproof materials. 

The fact that the west wing and the central part of the Smithsonian 
])uilding had never been made entirel}^ fireproof was communicated to 
the Regents by Secretary Langley in his report for 1888, in which 
attention was also called to the proximity of much inflammable mate- 
rial. He likewise explained that for certain reasons the fireprooting 
of the west wing was the luore urgent. References to this subject were 
again made in the Secretary's reports for 1889 and 1890, and the 
importance was urged of gaining additional light in the center of the 
main building b}^ the construction of a skylight in the roof and a well- 
hole through the second floor. 

As these parts of the building were used for the National Museum, 
an appropriation for the proposed changes was asked of Congress, 
beginning in May, 1888, Senator Morrill, a Regent of the Institution, 
pressing the matter with his customary energy. The first bills, relat- 
ing mainly to the west wing, were passed by the Senate twice during 
the Fiftieth Congress (ending March -l, 1889), but failed of action in 
the House. 

The question was again brought up in the Fifty-first Congress (1889- 
1891), originating in the Senate, and was discussed in several forms. 
The most comprehensive measure and the one carrying the largest 
appropriation was Senate bill No. 2033, reported on January 27, 1890, 
by Senator Morrill. Its wording was as follows: 

That, for the purpose of fireproofing the roof of the main hall, and that of the 
so-called chapel in the west wing of the Smithsonian building, and to put in a sky- 
light and a wellhole to admit light into the central portion of the lower hall of said 
building, and also to replace some woodwork of the towers, and other repairs, said 
work to be done under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol with the approval 
of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, flic sinn of $45,000 shall be, and

hereliy is, appropriated out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appro- 
jiriated. 

Oil March 6, 1890, Secretary Langley addressed a letter to the 
chairman of the House Conmiittee on Public Buildinj^^s and Grounds, 
on the subject of the a])ove bill, in which he says that the $45,000 is 
asked to complete the lireprooting and repair of a part of the build- 
ing which for a long period has been almost entirely given over to 
Government purposes rent free. Following are quotations from the 
same letter: 

The portions of the building which are not fireiiroof are — 

The roof of the so-called "chapel" in the west wing, which contains collections 
whose mere money value is estimated at over $250,000, but whose value to science is 
inestimable. This is also the only portion of the building wliich is suitable to devote 
to donations of art objects, which may be expected when the Government provides 
a safe depository for them. 

The ceiling and part of the roof of the main exhibition hall, now occupied bj' prolv 
ably the most extensive and valuable archpeological collection in the United States, 
is of combustible material and in urgent need of repairs, the ceiling threatening to 
fall, in part, and crush the cases and their valuable contents and possibly endanger 
the safety of visitors and einployees. Both roofs are leaking, and these changes 
involve the replastering and repainting of the walls. 

The floor of the main hall, 200 l>y 50 feet, is worn out and needs renewal, and all 
this implies special temporary provision for the collection. 

The lower hall is now very dark, and in replacing the roof and ceiling of the 
upper story it is desirable that a large skylight and wellhole be inserted, which 
would greatly add to the comfort of visitors by increasing the light and providing 
better ventilation. 

The rooms occupied by the Bureau of International Exchanges are in less need of 
repair, but some portion of the amount asked is intended to be devoted to the 
extreme east wing, occupied l)y these offices. 

In addition to what has been mentioned, there are wooden floors and other wood- 
work in the towers which are a source of danger, and it is to be observed that, owing 
to the crowded condition of the Museum, it has been necessary to erect a paint shop 
tilled with combustible material immediately against the south wall of the building 
and close to the roof, whose dangerous condition has just been described. The 
present state of things is one of continual menace. 

The bill as finally enacted into law, as an item in the sundry civil 
act for 1891, was as follows: 

For fireproofing the so-called chapel of the west wing of the Smithsonian build- 
ing, and for repairing the roof of the main building and the ceiling and plastering of 
the main hall of the building, $25,000, said work to be done under the supervision 
of the Architect of the Capitol, with the approval of the Regents of the Smithsonian 
Institution, and no portion of the appropriation to be used for skylights in the roof 
nor for wellhole in the floor of the main building, $25,000. (Stat. XXVI, 383. ) 

In his report for 1891 Secretary Langlc}^ announces gratifying 
progress in the changes and repairs up to June 30, 1891, consisting in 
the entire replacement of the roof of the west wing with a sul)stantial 
construction of iron and slate and the repairing of the roof and of 



228 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

the oeilino- and plastering of the upper hall of the main building-. By 
the close of the fiscal year 1892 this work was practically completed, 
though with the expenditure of only a part of the appropriation, and 
in his report for that year Secretary Langley states: 

I would especially urge that the balance of this appropriation, unexpended by 
reason of a limiting clause introduced in the act, on account of which the money is 
not available for certain repairs originally contemplated, should be now made avail- 
able by Congress for increasing the storage room in the east wing of the building, 
and at the same time that certain rooms be fitted for the special needs of the Gov- 
ernment Exchange Bureau, now occupying rooms in the main building urgently 
needed for other purposes. 

This request was granted by Congress in the sundry civil act for 
1894, as follows: 

For completing the repairs upon the Smithsonian l)uilding, and for such other 
work as is needed to protect the l)uilding from further deterioration and to place it 
in proper sanitary condition, any unexpended balance remaining to the credit of the 
appropriation for fireproofing, etc., shall l)e availal^le for the purposes above stated; 
this work to be done under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol and in accord- 
ance with the approval of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. (Stat. 
XXVII, 582.) 

The use made of the unexpended balance ai)ove referred to is thus 
described in the report of the Secretary for 1893: 

A restrictive clause contained in the appropriation of August 30, 1890, for repairs 
to the Smithsonian building w as removed by a clause in the sundry civil act for the 
year ending June 30, 1894, so that a portion of the amount unexpended became avail- 
able for making necessary repairs to the roof of the eastern wing and improving the 
sanitary condition of the building, as well as for increasing the space available for 
storing documents and handling the Government exchanges. The plumbing in the 
eastern part of the building has been thoroughly overhauled and a suite of dark and 
damp rooms in the basement, on the south side, has been transformed into well- 
lighted and comfortable offices, thus freeing several rooms upon the first floor, needed 
for other purposes, and making it possible to handle more expeditiously the great 
number of books passing through the exchange office, though even with these new 
rooms additional storeroom for the Government exchanges will be called for at no 
distant day. 

Other small changes at the east end of the building, made mainly 
at the expense of the Smithsonian fund, are described as follows in the 
reports for 1894 and 1895: 

The narrow windows and the small diamond panes of glass admit so little light 
that in winter days some of the rooms where clerical work is carried on need to be 
artificially lighted, and in all cases the occupants lose the advantage of w^hat ought 
to be abundant light, considering their open surroundings in the middle of a park. 
I think it well to state that while I should have made many more changes in the 
interest of the comfort and health of the clerical occupants of the building if I had 
had the means to do so, I have never felt at liberty to alter the external appearance 
of the building when alteration could possibly be avoided, and I have therefore never 
authorized the enlargement of any of the apertures in the stone w'ork or made any 
changes of this kind which could be understood as modifying the structural features 
(except in improving the sanitary conditions of the basement), and when any change

is mentioned here it will always be understood that it is essentially the work of the 
carpenter in providing for larger inside frames and larger lights in the sashes and in 
like alterations. 

Tims, in the east wing of the building, in the fourth story, a room for containing 
the archives of the Institution has been provided, which is well lighted by one of 
the few large windows the building possesses and which has been fitted for more 
convenient reference to the records of the Institution. The second floor has been 
made brighter by repainting and by some additional floor lights in the third floor, 
and the windows in the room especially set ai)art for the safe-keeping of the engrav- 
ings and books of art belonging to the Institution have been thus enlarged, while 
some of the rooms on the second floor have been improved by slight alterations in 
the window frames. On the first floor additional quarters were provided for the 
library in the rooms which were vacated by the transfer of the (exchange department 
to the lower floor. 

In continuing much-needed improvements in the east wing of the Smithsonian 
building, especially with a view to better light and ventilation, the lighting of the 
rooms on the first floor occupied by the library has been greatly improved by 
enlarging the window frames and replacing the small diamond panes by single 
sheets of glass. Similar changes have been made in the Secretary's office, on the 
second floor, as well as in some of the rooms on the third and fourth floors. Several 
rooms on the fourth floor, heretofore of no use except for storage, have been made 
habitable and have proved useful for various needed purposes. 

The sanitary condition of the building has been improved by the removal of cer- 
tain objectionable features and by the installation of a comprehensive system of ven- 
tilation by which pure air at an equable temperature is assured in most of the office 
rooms. Work upon this was well advanced at the close of the year. 

Another great improvement added during the year is the introduction of electric 
lights in all tJie offices of the east wing, the electric power being supplied by a spe- 
cial plant, which, with the ventilating apparatus, has been placed in the basement 
of the south tower, where considerable changes were made for their accommodation. 

Since the above dates the only alterations which need ])e mentioned 
in this connection have been the replacement of the wooden floor in 
the lower main exhibition hall with a terrazzo pavement, the fitting 
up of the children's room on the main floor of the south tower, the 
improvement of the conditions on all the other floors of the same 
tower, and the construction of a tunnel between the Smithsonian and 
Museiun buildings, which, while intended primarily for the heating 
pipes, electric wires, etc., has been made sufliciently large to serve as 
a general passageway. 

On the other hand, it is to be noted, with regret, that the upper 
main exhibition hall, devoted to prehistoric archieolog}-, had to be 
closed in 1902 because of the loosening and fall of plaster over a large 
part of the ceiling and walls. The room was at once recognized to 
be unsafe for the admission of the public, and its appearance was 
extremel}^ unsightly. Provisional repairs, to the extent possible from 
the regular appropriation, have recently been completed, and the hall 
will soon again be made serviceable, but a considerable expenditure 
would be required to place it in thoroughly good condition. 



230 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

SMITHSONIAN BUILDING. 
DESCRIPTION. 

Exterior. — The building erected for the Smithsonian Institution, in 
accordance with the design prepared b}^ Mr. James Ren wick, jr., 
architect, of New York City, is in. the later Norman or, as it may with 
more strict propriety be called, the Lombard style, as it prevailed in 
Germany, Normand}", and southern Europe in the last half of the 
twelfth centurj", the latest variety of the rounded style, as it is found 
immediately anterior to the merging of that manner in the early 
Gothic. In the general design and most of the details the architect 
adhered to the period to which this style is referable. The general 
feeling, however, which permeates the design, especially in the upper 
towers, is that of a somewhat later era, when all lingering reminis- 
cences of the post and lintel manner had been discarded and the ruling 
principles of arch architecture were recognized and carried out. The 
semicircular arch stilted is employed throughout in doors, windows, 
and other openings. The windows are without elaborately traceried 
heads. The buttresses are not a prominent feature and have no sur- 
mounting pinnacles. The weather moldings consist of corbel courses, 
with bold projection. The towers are of various shapes and sizes. 
The main entrance on the north, sheltered by a carriage porch, is 
between two towers of unequal height. 

In his description of the plan in Hints on Public Architecture, 
Doctor Owen states: 

I am not acquainted with any actual example yet remaining from what has been 
variously called the Lombard, the Norman, the Romanesque, and the Byzantine 
school, with which the Smithsonian building will not favorably compare. In so far 
as the architect has permitted himself to innovate upon ancient precedents from the 
style in which he designed, he has done so, in my judgment, with discretion and 
advantage. * * * I esteem myself fortunate in being able in this book to refer 
to an actual example, at our seat of government, the architect of which seems to me 
to have struck into the right road, to have made a step in advance, and to have 
given us in his design not a little of what may be fitting and appropriate in any 
manner (should the genius of our country hereafter work such out) that shall 
deserve to be named as a national style of architecture for America. 

The design as originally carried out consisted of a main central 
building, two stories high, and of two lateral wings of a single stor3\ 
connected with the main building by intervening ranges, each of the 
latter having a cloister, with open stone screen, on the north front. 
The only important changes since made have been the reconstruction 
of the east wing and range, which are now four and three stories 
high, respectively, the closing in with stone of the western cloister 
so as to adapt it to laboratory purposes, and the completion of the 
lireproofing of the building. 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 231 

The extroim^ IcMioth of the buildino- from cast to west is 447 feet. 
The nuiin structure is 205 feet Ion*;- by ,57 feet wide and 58 feet lii^h 
to the top of its corbel course, though, including- the main north and 
south towers and the carriage porch, it attains at the center an extreme 
width of 160 feet. The east wing is 82 by 52 feet, the west wing, 
including its projecting apse, 81 by 40 feet and 38 feet high, while 
each of the connecting ranges is 60 by 49 feet. 

The main Ijuilding has in the center of its north front two towers, 
of which the higher reaches an elevation of 145 feet. In the middle 
of the south front is a single massive tower 37 feet square, including 
Ijuttresses, and 91 feet high. At its northeast corner stands a double 
campanile, 17 feet square and 117 feet high to the top of its tinial, at 
its. southwest corner is an octagonal tower finished with open work 
above, and at its southeast and northwest corners are two smaller 
towers. There is also a small tower at the northwest corner of the 
west wing. 

The location of the building is the center of the original Smith- 
sonian reservation, or the southern and higher part of the so-called 
Smithsonian Park, about 20 feet alcove the average level of Pennsyl- 
vania avenue. The material of which the building is constructed is a 
fine grade of freestone, of the lilac-gray variety, obtained from quar- 
ries in the new red sandstone near the mouth of Seneca Creek, a trib- 
utary of the Potomac liiver, about 23 miles above Washington. The 
faces of the building are finished in ashlar, laid in courses from 10 to 
15 inches high. 

At the present time it would not be considered appropriate to design 
a building of this character for museum purposes, because, while most 
of the exhibition halls are more or less adapted to their requirements, 
there is too much waste space, too many dark places, wholly inade- 
quate accommodations for storage, and few rooms suitable for labora- 
tories, the latter also being mainly inconvenient of access. The 
windows were glazed in the beginning with small square pieces of 
glass, set diamond shape in wooden frames, quite in keeping- with the 
style of architecture, though admitting less light than larger panes. 
This manner of glazing has been retained, except at the eastern end, 
where, at the time of reconstruction, single lights were mainly 
substituted. 

The building was originally constructed in what seemed to l)e a 
thoroughly substantial manner, but these qualities were mainh' con- 
fined to the outer walls and the floors. Subscijuent reconstructions 
have greatly tended to increase its stability, and the building through- 
out is now practically fireproof. This has resulted from the introduc- 
tion of fireproof construction and of iron doors, by means of which 
any part of the building' can readily be cut oti' from the remainder. 



232 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

The foundutioiifs ure very substantial and the walls of the building 
very thick, as would be necessary in a structure of this kind. The 
roofs, except on the connecting ranges, are slated. 

Interior. — As tirst planned, the Museum was to occupy only the large 
upper main hall in the Smithsonian building, the room now and for 
many 3'ears past used for the exhibition collections of prehistoric 
archaeology. The corresponding hall on the main floor was to be 
divided equall}^ between the library and a large lecture room, while 
the west hall and connecting range were specially constructed for the 
galler}' of art. The east hall and range, one stor^^ in height, contained 
the smaller lecture room, laboratories, and rooms for apparatus. 

During the progress of the work of building and fitting up, how- 
ever, all of these proposed arrangements were changed, either perma- 
nently or temporarily, the assignments of space at the time of the fire 
of 1865 having been as follows: The east wing was separated into two 
stories, the upper of which was divided into a suite of rooms for the 
accommodation of the Secretary and his family. The lower story con- 
sisted principally of a single large room, appropriated to the storage 
of publications and their reception and distribution in connection with 
the system of exchanges. The upper story of the eastern connecting 
range contained a number of small apartments devoted to the opera- 
tions in natural history, and the lower story was fitted up as a work- 
ing laborator3\ 

The upper story of the main building was divided into a lecture 
room, capable of holding 2,000 persons, and two additional I'ooms, 
at the ends, 50 feet square, one of which contained a museum of appa- 
ratus and the other a gallery of art. Both were occasionally^ used as 
minor lecture rooms and for the meetings of scientific, educational, 
and industrial associations. In 1868, after the rebuilding made neces- 
sar}^ by the fire, this entire story was assigned to the Museum by a 
resolution of the Board of Regents. The lower storj^ of the main 
building, consisting of one large hall, was unoccupied at first, but as 
the means for furnishing were provided it was utilized for the exhi- 
bition of natural history and other collections, the specimens from the 
Patent Office having been mainly transferred to these quarters in 1858. 

The west wing was occupied by the library until its transfer to the 
Library of Congress in 1866, while the west range was used as a read- 
ing room. The tower rooms were utilized for various purposes, one 
large room in the south tower being assigned to the meetings of the 
Establishment and the Board of Regents, and three rooms in the north 
tower to the offices of the Secretary. 

Since the fire of 1865 there have been even greater changes, as 
detailed in the foregoing historical account. By 1871 the adminis- 
trative offices had become practically segregated in the east wing and 
range, commonly designated together as the "east end," which was

fireproofcd and considerabl}' eularg-ed at the time of its rebuilding in 
1884. In ISTI nearly all the remainder of the building was given 
over to the purposes of the National Museum. 

At the east end are now the offices of the Secretary and of the 
parent institution, as well as those for the general administration 
of the Government branches under the direction of the Institution, 
the offices of the exchange service and of the international catalogue 
of scientific literature, and rooms for that part of the Smithsonian 
librar}^ which is retained at the Institution. In this part of the build- 
ing are also several rooms used conjointly with the Museum, such as 
the disbursing office, the quarters of the registrar and the shipping 
clerk, and apartments for the storage and distribution of documents. 

Immediately inside the principal or northern entrance of the main 
building is an octagonal vestibule between 17 and 18 feet across, at 
each side of which is a small room about 15 feet square occupied bj' 
the watch force and as an office of suj^erintendence. Next follows 
a long and high hall containing two iron stairwa3's leading to the 
upper stories. The main lower hall, which measures about 200 feet 
long b}^ 50 feet wide and 23 feet 8 inches high, might be expected to 
present exceptional advantages for the exhibition of collections, yet it 
has several very marked defects. The large windows (14 feet 10 
inches high by 4 feet 5 inches wide), reaching from about 4 feet 5 
inches above the floor to within the same distance of the paneled ceil- 
ing, ati'ord abundant light at the ends, but in the center of the room 
on both the north and south sides there is a long blank wall necessi- 
tating artificial lighting over a considerable space. Furthermore, the 
ceiling of the room is supported by two rows of very heav}'^ orna- 
mental columns (3 feet 3 inches wide, 8 feet 9 inches apart, and about 
14 feet distant from the walls) which unite in a series of arches above. 
Between these cokuuns and the outer walls, at a height of 8 feet from 
the floor, are four galleries, 15 feet wide, which extend from the ends 
of the hall to the central dark area, and both these columns and gal- 
leries are further means of darkening the middle aisle of the room. 

Except at the sides of the entrances, where they are arranged in a 
large quadrangle illuminated by incandescent electric lamps, the cases 
forming the main series in this hall extend from pillar to wall and 
from the floor to the galler}" so as to form successive baj^s or alcoves, 
each lighted by a single window. In some of the alcoves there are 
also small square cases, with groups of specimens, and all of the 
above are used for the exhibition of birds. Extending through the 
central aisle is a series of unit cases, with sloping and upright tops, 
for the displa}' and storage of mollusks. 

A passagewa}^ from the middle of the hall leads to a small room, 
about 25 by 23 feet, forming the main floor of the south tower, the 
exterior entrance to which has been closed. This room has been 



234 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

transfoniK'd into the so-called childicMrs rooiu, with a mosaic tloor, 
the walls painted in several tints of ^reen, and the ceiling- covered 
with an arbor and vine. Low, light-colored cases, almost wholly of 
glass, contain a series of specimens, mostly animal, chosen to excite 
the wonder of children, besides which there are several paintings 
upon the walls and two aquaria with living fishes. 

Adjoining the main hall on the west is the west range (60 by 37 
feet), one story high, but surmounted by a clerestory. The side roofs 
are supported by two rows of columns, similar to those in the main 
hall but not so heavy, being 6 feet apart and about 8 feet 2 inches 
from the side walls. The windows are confined to the south wall. 
Upright cases form alcoves along the sides of the room, while Hat- 
topped table cases occupy the central aisle. This range has recentl}^ 
been given over to the exhibition of insects. It previously contained the 
fishes and was originally connected with the librarv as a reading room. 

The western hall follows and has for a numl)er of years been devoted 
to the display of marine invertebrates exclusive of the mollusks, with 
extensive provisions for the storage of specimens. It has the appear- 
ance of a chapel, by which name it is often designated. It is rela- 
tively very high, with an arched ceiling and skylight, and terminates 
at the northern end in an apse. Its dimensions, not including the 
apse, are: Length, about Q6 feet; width, 35 feet; greatest height, 37 
feet 8 inches. There are windows well up on the south and west sides 
and lower ones in the apse, but none on the east. High up on the 
south wall is a handsome rose window. This room, together with the 
adjoining range, was planned to contain the gallery of art, but from 
the time of its completion until 18<)6 it was occupied by the library. 
Now upright cases of black walnut occupy the wall space on all sides, 
except in the apse, which contains a synoptical collection displayed 
in small cases. The body of the hall has three rows of flat-topped 
and high, square cases, on unit bases fitted with storage drawers. 
The small adjoining tower is also used for the storage of marine 
invertebrates. 

The old cloister to the north of the west range, originally open at 
the front, was inclosed with wood at an early date; but when this part 
of the building was tireproofed, the woodwork was replaced with stone. 
The room thus gained is divided into two well-lighted apartments, 
used as laboratories for fishes and marine invertebrates. 

The second flo ••, as designated on the plans, contains the galleries 
of the main lower hall already described. At the head of the first 
flight of stairs from the main entrance are three small rooms used as 
natural-history studies, and at a corresponding height in the south 
tower is a room fitted up by the Smithsonian Institution for its collec- 
tion of apparatus. There is also a low second-story room over the 
western cloister, used for the storage cf fishes.

Pi'operl}'^ speaking, the third floor, so named on the plans, is, for the 
main part of the buildino-, onl\' the second floor. It consists of a 
single large room of the same size as the lower main hall, being thus 
about 200 feet long by 50 feet wide and 29 feet 3 inches high. For- 
merly it contained the picture gallery, a lecture hall, and a museum 
of apparatus, but soon after the restoration succeeding the fire of 
1865 it was turned over to the department of prehistoric arcliEeolog}^, 
which has occupied it ever since. It is one of the finest halls in the 
possession of the Museum, but for a long time it has been in bad 
condition, owing chiefly to the loosening and fall of plaster. The 
extensive repairs made necessary on this account have, however, 
recently been finished. As the ceiling is supported from the roof, 
the hall contains no pillars, and there are no galleries, so that the 
space is entirel}- clear; and while the windows bear the same relations 
to the central space as in the loAver hall, the light is more freely dis- 
tributed. The cases are of several old patterns, not permitting of a 
satisfactory installation, especially considering- the height of the room, 
which, with proper treatment, could be made exceedingly efl'ective. 
In the north tower on this h^'el are three small rooms used as the 
laboratories for prehistoric archaeology, and in the south tower is the 
Regents' room. 

The floor of the north towers and intervening space next above the 
archieological workrooms comprises a suite of three similar room^, 
occupied as laboratories for conchology. Three succeeding floors in 
the same towers, containing- six rooms in all, are utilized as storerooms 
for mollusks and other marine invertebrates. Above these in the 
taller tower are still six stories, but their high position renders them 
practicall}" unserviceable. The three floors which succeed the Regents' 
room in the south tower are all used for the storage of publications. 

While the basement is of good height, only the eastern part is in 
proper condition, the central and western parts requiring to be thor- 
oughly renovated, including the building- of broad areas along the 
exterior to assist in the lighting and ventilation. The heating plant 
is near the center of the basement, but now serves only in a supple- 
mentary capacity. In the north tower are the toilet rooms. To the 
eastward from there the basement is mainly used b}' the Smithsonian 
Institution and the International Exchange Service; to the westward 
all the available space is given over to Museum storage. There are 
seven small rooms and one large room, one of the former being used 
for supplies, while all the remainder are overfilled with specimens in 
the several groups of birds, fishes, mollusks, and marine invertebrates. 
With the exception of the birds, the specimens are mainl}^ alcoholic. 
These collections are very large and of great value, but they require 
at least twice the present amount of .space for their saf^ arrangement, 
and the darkness and dampness of the rooms unfit them for purposes 
of study. 



236 EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUHEUM, 1903. 

NATURAL-HISTORY WORKSHOP. 

Ill order to provide more extensive and more suitable quarters for 
the preparatory and photographer of the Museum, with immediate 
reference to preparations for the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibi- 
tion, a small two- story brick l)uilding" was constructed in 1875 on the 
Mall, a short distance west of the southwestern corner of the Smith- 
sonian building'. It consists of a main structure, about 30 by 2Ti 
feet, and of two wings, each about 28 by 17 feet, on the east and west 
sides. The latter have been used as a stable and a carriage house and 
were somewhat enlarged in 1901 and 1902 at the expense of the 
Smithsonian fund, their present dimensions lieing those given above. 
The original Congressional appropriation for this building amounted to 
$3,000, but, proving inadequate and in order to hasten its completion, 
the Institution advanced an additional sum of ^3,927.84, which was 
refunded by Congress in 1877. 

The upper part of the main building was iitted up as a photographic 
laboratory, the remainder of the main building, with its basement 
and the rooms over the carriage house, being assigned to the work 
of taxiderm}^, preparation of skeletons, modeling, the painting of 
models, etc. In the course of a few j^ears the accommodations which 
it furnished were greatl}- outgrown, and certain divisions of the work 
were transferred elsewhere. At the present time onl}^ the upper story 
is occupied for any of these purposes, and principalh^ by the bird 
taxidermists. In 1881 the department of photography was removed 
to the Museum building, and the old rooms were allotted to the use of 
the photographers of the U. S. Geological Survey and the Bureau 
of American Ethnology, who remained there until 1881. 

ARMORY BUILDING. 

This building, assigned in 1877 to the purposes of the National 
Museum and now occupied as the headquarters of the U. S. Fish 
Commission, is located at the southern end of that part of the Mall 
lying between Sixth and Seventh streets. It was erected under an 
appropriation of $30,000, granted in the civil and diplomatic act for 
1856, for the use of the local volunteers and militia and as a place of 
deposit for the military trophies of the Revolutionarv and other wars, 
and for newly invented and model arms for the military service. It 
is a rectangular brick structure, with many large windows, measuring 
about 102 feet long, 58 feet wide, and 1(3 feet high to the gable. It 
has four stories, including an attic, which afford a combined floor 
space of over 20,000 scpiare feet. The building remained dedicated to 
its original uses until after the close of the civil war, when, the militia 
of the District not being organized, it was left unoccupied. 

The use of this building was granted to the Smithsonian Institution, 
in order to provide for the temporary storage of the large collections 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 237 

which were expected to be received from the Centennial Exhibition 
at Philadelphia, b}- the following provision in the sundry civil act for 

1877: 

For repairing; ami fittintr.up the so-callod Armory Imildiiifj;, on the Mall between 
Sixth and Seventh streets, and to ena])le the Smithsonian Institution to store therein 
and to take care of specimens of the extensive series of the ores of the precious 
metals, marbles, build in<i stones, coals, and numerous ol)jects of natural history now 
on exhil)ition in l*hiladeli)hia, including:;: other objects of practical and economical 
value presented by various foreign governments to the National INIuseuni, $4,500: 
Provided, That the said sum shall be expended under the direction of the Secretary 
of the Smithsonian Institution. 

The collections, when brought to Washington from Philadelphia and 
stored in this building in their original packing cases, together with 
other collections from national surveys, filled it completely from the 
ground floor to the attic. The sundry civil act for 1878 provided for 
the completion of the interior arrangements and for maintenance in 
the following terms: 

For fitting up the Armory building for storage of articles belonging to the United 
States, including those transferred from the international exhibition and expense of 
watching the same, $2,500. 

For 1879 and 1880, the same sum was granted "for expense of 
watching and storage of articles/' etc. An identical amount was 
appropriated for 1881, in which year the National Museiun building 
was completed, and the following clause added: "and for transfer 
to the new National Museum." 

Some of these collections, with others from the Geological Survey 
and the Bureau of Ethnology, and several workshops were retained, 
however, at the Armory building for a number of 3'ears longer, when 
certain quarters, including the main floor, were appropriated to the 
use of the U. S. Fish Commission, of which the Commissioner, Spencer 
F. Baird, was also keeper of the Museum. The following was the 
wording of the act for 1882: 

For expense of watching, care, and storage of duplicate Government collections 
and of property of the United States Fish Commission, $2,500. 

The text of the sundry civil items for 1883, 1884, and 1885, was 
identical, except for the insertion of the word "ground" in two 
instances and its omission in the others, and was as follows: 

For care of the Armory building (and grounds) and expense of watching, preser- 
vation, and storage of the duplic-ate collections of the Government and of the prop- 
erty of tlie United States Fish Gonnnission contained therein, including salaries or 
compensation of all necessary enii)loyees, $2,500. 

In the corresponding hill lor 1886, "the property of the National 
Museum" was su])stitut(Hl tor "the duplicate collections of the 
(lovcriunent."" 

During the succeeding thice years no apjnopiiutions were made 



238 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

directly for the Ai'inorv building. It bccuino more extensively used 
1)3" the Fish Commission, the Museum retaining only a few workshops 
and some storage quarters on the third floor. The expenses of main- 
tenance and repair were paid by the C-ommission. In 18SS the newly 
appointed Fish Commissioner recjuested that the entire building be 
turned over to the Fish Commission for othce and hatchery purposes. 
Opposition arising, however, the matter was settled for the time ])y 
the following item in the sundry- civil act for 1889: 

That the building known as tlie Armory building, Washington, D. C, whall be 
occupied as at present, jointly by the United States Commission of Fish and Fish- 
eries and the National Museum. 

The act for 1890, however, wdiich is as follows, extended the privi- 
leges of the Fish Commission: 

Fish Commission: For altering and fitting up the interior of the Armory building, 
on the Mall, city of AVashington, now occujiied as a hatching station, for the accom- 
modation of the offices of the United States Fish Commission, and for general repairs 
to said building, including the heating apparatus, and for repairing and extending 
the outbuildings, $7,000, or so much thereof as may be necessary, th<i same to be 
innnediately available and to be expended under the direction of the Architect of 
the Capitol; and for the purpose above named the Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution is hereby required to move from the second and third stories of this 
building all properties, except such as are connected with the workshops hereinafter 
named, under his control; and the workshops now in the second story of said build- 
ing shall be transferred to and provided for in the third storj^ thereof. And the 
Architect of the Capitol is hereby directed to examine and make rejiort to Congress 
at its next regular session as to the practicability and cost of constructing a basement 
story under the National Museum building. 

In his report upon the National Museum for 1890, Doctor Goode 
states that — 

In the Armory building there are at the present time several hundreds of boxes 
containing valuable material which has never been unpacked, since there is no 
space available for the display of the specimens. Many of the boxes contain collec- 
tions which were brought to the Museum through the medium of special acts of 
Congress. 

Realizing, however, the inconvenience to the Fish Commission of 
retaining these undesirable features in the midst of the ofiice quarters 
then in course of construction, a compromise was ettected where))}' the 
balance of the material in storage was transferred to a large adjacent 
shed erected by the Commission and the workshops to a location near 
the Museum. Some parts of these sheds are still used for the same 
purpose. 

THE MUSEUM BUILDING. 

HISTORICAL ACCOUNT. 

At the beginning of 1S7T the Board of Regents made its first request 
to Congress for means to erect a museum building supplemental to 
the Smithsonian building, which for over twenty years had housed the 



Report of U. S. National Museum, 1 903.— Rathbun. 



Plate 12. 




NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 239 

collections of the Government in conformitj^ with the act establishing 
the Institution. By this time all of the available space in the Smith- 
sonian building was overcrowded with specimens, and the need of 
additional, spacious quarters had suddenly' arisen, mainly through the 
acquisition of exceedingly large collections of great value, donated to 
the United States In' foreign governments and other exhibitors at the 
Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of ISTO. At their meeting of 
rbinuary 24-, 1877, the question was under discussion ))y the Regents, 
when, on motion of Doctor Parker, the following preamble and reso- 
lution were adopted, and the Secretary was instructed to transmit 
them to Congress: 

Whereas Congress, in tlie organization of the Smithsonian Institution, directed 
that it should make provision on a liberal scale for a museum to contain all the 
objects of natural history and of curious and foreign research, then belonging to or 
hereafter to l)elong to the United States Government; and 

Whereas, in accordance with this direction, the Institution has developed and for 
many years principally supported this National Museum, the collection being 
the property of the Government, while tlie building was erected for their accommo- 
dation, at a cost of $500,000, out of the income of the Smithson fund; and 

Whereas, on account of the appropriations of Congress for a national exhibit at the 
Centennial, and the liberal donations which have been made by several States of 
the Union, by individuals, and especially by foreign governments, the National 
INIuseum has suddenly increasecf to fourfold its previous dimensions and far beyond 
the capacity of the Smithsonian building to contain it: Therefore, 

Resolved, That Congress be respectfully requested to provide accommodations for 
these additional collections by the erection of a suitable building in connection with 
the present Smithsonian edifice. 

This resolution was presented to the Senate on January 26, 1877, 
and to the House of Representatives on February 2 of the same 3'ear, 
being referred in the former bod}' to the Committee on Public 
Buildings and Grounds and in the latter to the Committee on Appro- 
priations. 

Under date of Februar}- 5, 1877, the Regents also transmitted to 
Congress a memorial on the same subject, which, besides defining the 
legal objects of the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution and the 
origin and extent of its collections, contained the following paragraphs, 
e(iually pertinent to the needs for added space: 

By an act bearing date July 31, 187(5, additional duties were laid upon the Smith- 
sonian Institution as custodian, and $4,500 were appropriated "for repairing and fit- 
ting up the so-called Armory building, on the Mall between Sixth and Seventh 
streets, and to enable the Smithsonian Institution to store therein and to take care 
of specimens of the extensive series of the ores of the precious metals, marbles, 
building stones, coals, and numerous objects of natural history now on exhibition in 
IMiiladelphia, including other o1)jectH of jiractical and economical value jiresented by 
various foreign governments to the National INIuseuni. 

As a fruit of this act of th(! General (Jovermiient, the Smiths(mian Institution finds 
itself the custodian of enormous collections that had been displayt'd at the Centen- 
nial Exi)osition and on the closing of that exhibition had been presented to the 
United States. These donations are made by individuals among our own citizens, 



240 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

])y foreign exhilntori^, and ])y several of the States of tlie Union, and there is scarcely 
a power in the civilized world in any region of tlie globe which has not taken part in 
these contribntions, and some of tlieni with the largest generosity. Men of science, 
most competent to pass judgment, pronounce them to be of immense value and are 
of opinion that, including the gifts from States of the Union and the exhibits of the 
United States, they could not have been brought together by purchase for less than a 
million of dollars. 

******* 

Their adequate exhibition requires an additional building which shall afford at 
least four times the space furnished by the present edifice of the Institution. 

The (Tovernment of the United States is now in possession of the materials of a 
museum exhil)iting the natural products of our own country, associated with those 
of foreign nations, which would rival in magnitude, value, and interest the most 
celebrated museums of the Old World. 

The immediate practical question is, Shall these precious materials be for the most 
part packed away in boxes, liable to injury and decay, or shall they be exhibited? 

It was the act of Congress which ordered the acceptance in trust of these noble 
gifts to the United States. The receiving of them implies that they will be taken 
care of in a manner corresponding to the just expectations of those who gave them; 
and one of the prevailing motives of the donors was that the productions of their 
several lands might continue to be exhil)ited. The intrinsic value of the donations 
is, moreover, enhanced by the circumstances under which they were made. They 
came to us in the one hundredth year of our life as a nation, in token of the desire of 
the governments of the world to manifest their interest in our destiny. This con- 
sideration becomes the more pleasing when we bring to mind that these gifts have 
been received not exclusively from the great nations of Europe from which we are 
sprung, or from the empire and republics on our own continent beyond the line, l)nt 
that they come to us from the oldest abode of civilization on the Nile, from the time- 
honored empires and kingdoms of the remotest eastern Asia, and from the principal 
states which are rising into intellectual and industrial and political greatness in the 
farthest isles and continent; from states which are younger than ourselves and bring 
their contributions as a congratulatory offering to their elder brother. 

We have deemed it our duty to lay these facts and reflections before both Houses 
of Congress and to represent to them that if they, in their wisdom, think that the 
unequaled accumulation of natural specimens and works interesting to science, the 
evidence of the good will to us that exists among men, should be jilaced where it can 
be seen and studied by the people of our own land and by travelers from abroad, it 
will be necessary to make an appropriation for the immediate erection of a spacious 
building. Careful inquiries have been instituted to ascertain the smallest sum which 
would be adequate to that purpose, and the plan of a convenient structure has been 
made by General Meigs, the Quartermaster-General, U. S. Army. We beg leave 
further to represent that to accomplish the purpose there would be need of an appro- 
priation of $250,000. This amount is required not as a first installment, to be fol- 
lowed by others, but as sufficient entirely to complete the edifice. 

Should this appropriation be made at an early day, the ))uilding could be ready for 
the reception of articles before the next session of Congress. 

This memorial was referred in })otli Houses to the Committees on 
Public Buildinjj's and Grounds and met with general favor. A bill 
meeting the requirements was passed by the Senate on February 22, 
1877, but a corresponding bill offered in the House on March 2 was 
defeated b}' objection, possibly because of the lateness of the session, 
less than two days remaining before the close of Congress. The 
debates were brief but interesting.

NATIONAL MUSEUM— BUILDINC4S. 241 

Senator Morrill, on February 0, 1877, remarked: 

As I have stated in years past, it has seemed to be a necessity that we should pro- 
vide for a national museuin. It has been the opinion of the Committee on Public 
Buildings and Grounds on the i)art of the Senate, I believe unanimously, for some 
years that we ouglit to take all of tlie squares next east of the public grounds, 
throughout the length and breadth of the north and south range of one s(|uare, taking 
one square in depth and the whole length, for the purpose of a national museum 
and Congressional Library, and evidently this matter should ])e provideil for at once. 
* * * There are, as I am informed, at least fifty carloads of articles that have 
been given to us by foreign governments. Tlurty-two or thirty-three out of the forty 
nationalities abroad have given us their entire exhibits at the Centennial Exhibition. 
Their money value is scarcely computable, but if it were to be computed it exceeds 
our own, as large as our exhibits were there and as credital)le to the country. Our 
own, I believe, in money value, have been computed at $400,000. These foreign 
exhibits are computed, at least in money value, at the sum of $600,000, but in his- 
torical and scientific interest they perhaps surpass anything that has been assembled 
in any national museum on the globe. 

Senator J. W. Stevenson, on the same day, made the following 
statement: 

It is known to the Senate that the Smithsonian Institution was represented at the 
late Centennial Exhiliition at Philadelphia. At the close of that exposition a number 
of the foreign pov/ers there represented and who contributed to that grand display, 
at its close generously donated to the Smithsonian Institution most of their articles 
and products there exhibited. * * * The motive which prompted these dona- 
tions to the Smithsonian Institution was unquestionably one of amity and respect 
entertained by the foreign powers donating them for the Government of the United 
States. But unquestionably these donors expected that this Government would, 
through the agency of the Smithsonian Institution, keep these articles thus donated 
on public exhibition, and in this way the respective products of each country would 
become known to the people of our entire country. 

The articles donated are valuable, rare, varied, and occupy much space. * * * 
The Smithsonian Institution has no building in which they can be either exhibited 
or safely preserved. They must remain, therefore, in boxes, subject to injury and 
to decay, unless Congress shall take some immediate action toward the erection of a 
building in all respects suitable for their exhibition and preservation. The capacity 
of such a building is estimated by competent architects to be four times as large as 
the Smithsonian building. A plan of such a structure has been already drawn by 
General Meigs. * * * 

Professor Henry assures me that with the erection of the contemplated building 
on the plan of General Meigs, with the articles now on exhibition in the Smith- 
sonian Institution with those just donated, we shall have the nucleus of a national 
museum which, in a few years, will equal any in the world. 

In presenting- the memorial to the House on February 7, 1877, 
Representative Hiester Chnner said, among other things: 

It may not be disputed that the acceptance of them [the collections from Phila- 
delphia] by the Government imposes an obligation that they shall be preserved and 
exhibited for the gratification and instruction of the people. Their preservation and 
exhibition nuist be confided to the National JNIuseum, of which, by law, the Regents 
of the Smithsonian have tlie custody. They have presented for our consideration 
the necessity for erecting a suitable building for the purposes I have indicated, giv- 
ing an estimate of its proJiable cost.

242 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

The bill which passed the Senate as an item in the sundry civil 1)111, 
but failed of action in the House, in this the second session of the 
Fort^'-fourth Congress was as follows: 

For a lireproof building for the use of the National Museum, 300 feet square, to he 
erected under the direction and supervision of the Regents of the Smithsonian 
Institution, in accordance with the plan of Maj. Gen. M. C. Meigs, now on tile with 
the Joint Committee of PuT)lic Buildings and Grounds, on the southwest corner of 
the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution, the sum of $250,000 is hereliy appro- 
priated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated; said building 
to be placed west of the Smithsonian Institution, leaving a roadway -between it and 
the latter of not less than 30 feet, with its north front on a line ])arallel with the 
north face of the buildings of the Agricultural Department and of the Smithsonian 
Institution; and all expenditures for the pui-poses herein mentioned, not including 
anything for architectural plans, shall be audited by the proper officers of the 
Treasury Department. 

The necessity for a new Museum building was brought to the atten- 
tion of the President of the United States through the following 
communication, dated Octobers, 1877: 

Sir: I have the honor, in behalf of the Boai'd of Regents of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, to invite your attention to the propriety of recommending to Congress the 
memorial of the Board of Regents (a copy of which is herewith inclosed), asking 
that an appropriation be made for a building to accommodate the valuable collec- 
tions presented to the United States through this Institution at the late international 
exhibition in Philadelphia. 

As explanatory of this request it may be proper to state that the Smithsonian 
Institution was authorized by Congress to receive and take charge of these collections, 
and that they were presented with the expectation on the part of the donors that 
suitable provision would Ije made for their disi)lay at the seat of government. They 
consist of full series of articles illustrative of the economic jwoducts, the natural his- 
tory, and in many cases the manners, customs, and arts of the foreign countries 
represented at the Centennial Exhibition, and are of great importance to the 
advancement of science, education, and manufacture. Besides these are the objects 
collected by the Smithsonian Institution and U. S. Fish Commission of the animal, 
mineral, and fishery resources of the United States, also of public interest. 

These articles now constitute, by law, a part of the National Museum, which has 
been placed by Congress in charge of the Smithsonian Institution. This Museum 
has hitherto been accommodated in the building erected for the purpose at the 
expense of the Smithson fund, in accordance with the direction of Congress. This 
edifice, however, is filled to overflowing, while there are elsewhere, in storage, from 
the donations previously mentioned, collections of greater magnitude than those in 
the Smithsonian building. 

It is evident that an appropriation for an additional building can not justly he 
taken from the Smithson fund, and therefore the Board of Regents have made the 
application mentioned in their memorial. This memorial was presented to Congress 
at its last session, when the appropriation asked for was granted by the Senate unani- 
mously, and when, in all i)r()l)al)ility, it would have been granted l)y the House 
could the proposition have been brought to the consideration of that body. 
I am, with sentiments of high esteem, your obedient ser\ant, 

JosKi'ii IIenky, 
Secretary Smithsonian Institution. 

Hon. RuTHEKFOKu B. Hayes.

NATIONAL MTTSETTM BUILDINGS. 243 

In his message to the Forty-Hfth Congress, first session, December 
3, 1877, the President recommended " that an adequate appropriation 
be made for the establishment and conduct of a national museum under 
their [the Regents] supervision." 

Acting upon the basis of information supplied during the previous 
session, the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives 
(H. R. 2662) on Januar}^ 21, 1878, by Senator Case}' Young. It was 
referred to the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, which, 
through Mr.' Young, submitted a report (No. 211) upon the measure 
on Februar}' 25, 1878. On March 6 following, the bill was again 
brought up, referred to the Committee of the Whole and placed on 
the Calendar, but no further action was taken. A similar bill (S. 1320) 
was su])mitted in the Senate by Senator Justin S. Morrill on May 27, 
1878, and referred to the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. 

The report of the House committee (No. 241) briefiy sets forth the 
history and requirements of the Museum and the steps taken to secure 
the valua])le collections exhibited at Philadelphia, and closes as follows: 

The collections in the Smithsonian bnildinjj; now open to the public occupy about 
30,000 square feet of floor space. It is (juite within bounds to estimate that the articles 
stored away will require for their satisfactory exhibition between three and four 
times that area, even allowing for a great reduction of the objects by the elimination 
and distribution of the duplicate specimens. There is no provision whatever at 
present for the display of these articles, and unless Congress furnishes the means 
this magnificent property of the people will go to decay and destruction in the course 
of time, the animal products being destroyed rapidly by insects and many objects of 
a mineral or metallurgical character by rust. 

As every day of delay in arranging and exhibiting this collection is accompanied 
with the question of erecting a suitable building for its acconnnodation and has 
occupied the attention of the Smithsonian Institution, a plan has been devised which, 
it is believed, will furnish the facilities required in the shortest possible interval of 
time and at the minimum of expense. 

To erect an edifice of the necessary magnitude, in the style of architecture hereto- 
fore adopted by the Government for its use in Washington, would involve an 
expenditure of many millions of dollars, and it could not be completed and available 
for occupation in a shorter period than from five to eight years. Nevertheless, on a 
simple plan originally suggested by General Meigs, a l)uil(ling somewhat similar in 
character to those erected for the National Exposition, 300 feet square, or having an 
area of 90,000 square feet — something over two acres — perfectly fireproof, amply 
lighted, and properly adapted for all its objects, can be constructed for about 
$250,000, and can be ready for occupation within ten months, or at most a year, from 
the time of its commencement. 

By the plan contemplated everything would be on one floor, without any stairways 
or second story, no cellar or fireproof floor being reijuired. The single floor of the 
building to be of concrete, and thus water and vermin proof; the walls and other 
portions of the building of brick, and the beams, rafters, and framework of the roof 
of iron, without a particle of wood. 

It is therefore nnich to be desired that the means be fnrnisiied at an early day for 
the construi'tion of this building, so that the rich material now belonging to the 
United States Government can be utilized. 



244 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

It is belicvod tliat when properly arranged the National Museum of the United 
States will take rank as one of the great industrial and economical displays of the 
natural resources of the globe. The accommodation will then be afforded for the 
exhibition of the mineral wealth of every State and Territory, and the display of 
samples of every new mine, with all the appliances for rendering the study of the 
whole interesting and profitable. The coals, the marbles, and other ornamental 
minerals will be exhibited systematically; the useful and ornamental products 
and derivatives of the animal kingdom will be shown — not only such as relate to the 
United States, but with illustrations of the whole subject in other parts of the world — 
which can not fail to suggest new and important applications in this country. 
Illustrations of th(> food and other fishes of this and other countries, the best meth- 
ods of securing them and of preparing them for the requirements of mankind, and 
the varied productions of the aboriginal races of North America can also be displayed 
on a proper scale. 

During the second session of the same Congress the bill for a new 
building was again brought up in both Houses. Brief remarks were 
made in the Senate and the bill slightly amended in regard to the 
wording relative to location. It was passed as an item in the sundry 
civil act for 1880 in the following terms: 

For a fireproof building for the use of the National Museum, 300 feet square, to be 
erected under the direc/tion and supervision of the Regents of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, in accordance with the plans now on file with the Joint Committee of Public 
Buildings and Grounds, on the southeastern portion of the grounds of the Smithso- 
nian Institution, $250,000: said building to be placed east of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, leaving a roadway between it and the latter of not less than 50 feet, with its 
north front on a line with the south face of the l)uildings of the Agricultural Depart- 
ment and Qf the Smithsonian Institution; and all expenditures for the purposes 
herein mentioned, not including anything for architectural plans, shall be audited 
by the proper officers of the Treasury Department. 

The following extracts from the report of the building commission, 
submitted January 19, 1880, give a summary of the building opera- 
tions for 1879: 

Anticipating the early action of Congress in the premises, the Board of Regents, 
on the 17th of January, 1879, adopted the following resolution: 

"Resolved, That the executive committee of the Board, or a majority thereof, and 
the Secretary be, and they are hereby, authorized and empowered to act for and in 
the name of the Board of Regents in carrying into effect the provisions of any act of 
Congress that may be passed providing for the erection of a building for the National 
Museum." 

Accordingly, on the 7th of March, 1879, Hon. Peter Parker and Gen. W. T. Sherman, 
the resident members of the executive committee, with the Secretary, met in the office 
of the Institution, and after organizing under the title of "National Museum Build- 
ing Commission," of which Gen. W. T. Sherman was chosen chairman, proceeded 
to adopt such measures as in their opinion appeared best calculated to realize, with 
the least possible delay, the intention of Congress. 

The committee at the outset invited Gen. IVI. C. Meigs, Quartermaster-General 
U. S. Army, to act in the capacity of consulting engineer to the commission, and 
also selected Messrs. (/luss & Schulze, whose plans for the new building were those 
approved by Congress, as suiierintending architects. Mr, Daniel Leech was a])pointed 
secretary of the commission.

NATIONAL MUSKITM BUILDINGS. 245 

To remove as far as possiV)le any <loubt. as to the sufficiency of the appropriation 
for a building in accordance with the plans approved hy Congress, l\Ir. Edward 
Clark, Architect of the Capitol, and General Meigs, after carefully considering the 
provisional estimates of the architects, informed the connnission that in their o{)inion 
the amount was sufficient for the purpose. 

To obtain a clear understanding of the intent of Congress in making the appro- 
priation, as well as to ascertain how far, if desirable, the commission might be 
authorized to depart from the plans before the Committees of Public Buildings and 
Grounds when the act was passed, the chairmen of the respective committees (Hon. 
H. L. Dawes and Hon. Philip Cook) were consulted; whereupon these gentlemen 
officially informed the commission "that, provided the general design be retained, 
it was not their intention, nor that of their committees, to confine the Board of 
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to the minor details of the aforesaid plans, 
but to authorize any modifications that might appear to them desirable in the interest 
of economy or for the better adaptation of the building to its object." 

On ascertaining that the appropriation could be made immediately available under 
%he clause directing that the accounts should be audited liy the proper officers of the 
Treasury Deiiartment, the Secretary of the Treasury was, on the 27th of ]\Iarch, 
requested to ilesignate some one of his force to act as disbursing officer. Accord- 
ingly Maj. T. J. Hol)bs, disbursing clerk of the Department, was selected, and pay- 
ments were authorized to be made by him on vouchers approved by the Secretary 
of the Smithsonian Institution as provided for in the following resolution: 

' ' Resolved, That the commission appointed by the Board of Regents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution to superintend the construction of a new fireproof building for the 
National Museum hereby authorize Prof. S. F. Baird, Secretary of the Institution, to 
act as their agent to approve for payment by Thomas J. Hobbs, all bills for services and 
supplies from such funds as are placed in the hands of the latter by said commission 
for such purposes, and the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby respectfully requested 
to instruct Thomas J. Hobbs, disbursing agent, to jiay any bills when thus certified 
and found to be otherwise technically correct." 

Having thus prepared the way to a commencement of active operations, specifica- 
tions were at once prepared and proposals invited for carrying on the work. Ground 
was broken on the 17th of April, 1879. 

The concrete foundations were begun on the 29th of April, and the brickwork of 
the walls on the 21st of May, the main walls being completed on the 1st day of 
November. 

In consequence of the low prices of the more important building mate^-ials, very 
favorable contracts were made, especially for the brick required and for the ironwork, 
since the i)rice of iron advanced very materially within a few months from the date 
referred to. The same is true with regard to glass, bricks, and in fact almost all 
building materials. 

* * * * * * * 

The estimate of $250,000 for the construction of a museum building did not include 
the heating apparatus. As the work progressed, however, it became evident that all 
the underground piping for water, gas, and steam, at least, could be obtained from 
the fund. 

In anticipation of an appropriation for the purpose, it was deemed best to obtain 
provisional 1)idsfor a steam-heating apparatus. Accordingly jjroposals were invited: 
First, for the underground pipes; second, for the boilers; third, for the radiators. 
The aggregate of the estimates for the three items varied from $i;^,940 to |55,tJ80. 

The lowest bid w-as rejected on account of inadequacy of the supply of heat. The 
next to the lowest was that of Messrs. Baker, Smith & Co., for $19,768, which was 
accepted, and a contract made for the underground pipes for $5,770. 

An appropriation of $30,000 has been asked of. Congress for the completion of the 



246 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSETTM, ]9(W. 

heating upi)ariituK throughout, for the gas and water fixtures antl the ekictrie appa- 
ratus required for clocks in the building, for signals, alarms, etc. 

Before the building can be occupied it must of course be furnished and fitted up 
with cases, of which, as might be expected, a large provision is required. According 
to a calculation, the cases that will be needed, if placed end to end, will extend to a 
distance of more than <S,000 feet, witli a total of slielving surface of al)out 75,000 scpiare 
feet. The frontage of the cases will be over 14,000 feet, so that, allowing for the cross- 
ing from one case to another, a journey of at least 3 miles will be recpiired even to 
take a cursory glance at all the objects in the collection. 

The question of the best material for the cases has not been definitely settled, 
the choice lying between iron and hard wood. In order to assist in determining this 
question satisfactorily, arrangements have been made to obtain working plans of the 
cases used not only in a number of museums in the United States, especially in Cam- 
bridge, Boston, and New York, l)ut also in pyurope. The new building now being 
erected for the collections of the British Museum is one where it is supjjosed the 
best experience has been made use of in the plans of the cases, and arrangements 
have been made to obtain copies of the same. The new iron cases of the national 
museum at Dresden are also under investigation. Iron is more expensive than wood, 
but involves less danger of decay, and there is also an especial advantage in the fact 
that the material may be so much thinner as to increase the interior space, while the 
objects in the cases are less obscured. Of course it must not be forgotten that the 
National Museum is expected to discharge its functions for an indefinite period of 
years. 

The provision of Congress directed that the new building should be placed to the 
east of the present Smithsonian edifice, at least 50 feet from its southeastern corner. 
The question was considered of having the interval greater than this minimum, but it 
was found that this would involve the extension of the building beyond the boundary 
of the Smithsonian reservation and carry it to the unassigned portion of the square. 
Although there was nothing in the act to prevent this encroachment, yet in view of 
the possibility that the southeastern portion of the public land between Seventli and 
Twelfth streets would l)e required for some other purposes, jjerhaps for a Congres- 
sional Library, it was thought best to encroach upon it as little as i>ossible. 

In addition to its answering the purpose for which it was primarily intended, it is 
confidently believed that the new National Museum building will exercise an 
important function in serving as a model for similar establishments elsewhere. 

Of course in a city where the cost of land is a matter of important consideration, 
the one-story plan can not always be carried out, the usual position of story above 
story being necessary to secure the desired space. Most colleges and universities, 
however, have ample grounds belonging to them, the occupation of which by large 
l)uildings is allowable. Under such circumstances the same amount of fireproof 
space can Ije had for from two-thirds to one-half the usual cost. 

The office of member of the building connnission has been by no means a sinecure, 
weekly meetings having been held, with scarcely an interruption, from the first 
organization, as shown by the full reports kept of the proceedings. General Meigs, 
as consulting engineer, until his recent departure on a tour of duty, was present at 
every meeting and contimially aided the commission by his advice, rendered so 
valuable by his long familiarity with building operations on a large scale and with 
the whole question of the proper construction of contracts. He visited the grounds 
nearly every day and closely inspected the progress of the work. To liim are also 
due valuable suggestions on the methods of covering the roofs and on other details. 

Two sii}).seqiient reports were made b}' the building- commisyion — one 
coverino- the yeav 1880, the other 1881. In these the progress of the 
work and the dates of completion of important parts of the building

were noted. The roofs were liiii.shed in April, 1880, and the phister- 
ing- by the latter part of July. In the interest of economy in heati^ig 
all outside windows were furnished with two panes of g'lass. Wooden 
floors were laid in 1880 in all the halls, exeept the four courts, the 
four main halls or naves, and the rotunda. Congress was asked for 
an appropriation to def ra}^ the expense of a marble or tile floor for the 
naves and rotunda, and $26,000 was allowed for this purpose, becoming 
available in the summer of 1881. The rotunda was then supplied with 
a floor of encaustic tiles and the main halls with floors of marble tiles. 
The approaches to the building were constructed out of the original 
appropriation. 

The final report of the commission, dated Januar}' 2, 1882, closes as 
follows: 

In closing this its third annual report, the National Museum building commission 
congratulates the Regents that the new l)uilding for the National Museum is so far 
completed as to be ready for occupancy, and in now asking the Board to take charge 
of the edifice the commission begs to refer to the important fact that, while a build- 
ing is presented equal in every respect to what was anticipated in case provision 
should be made for additional quarters for the national collections intrusted to the 
care of the Smithsonian Institution, instead of incurring a deficiency, the fund has 
been so yianaged as to have to its credit at the present moment an availal)le l)alance 
of some thousands of dollars. 

Having fulfilled the duties with which it was charged by your resolution of Janu- 
ary 17, 1879, the commission would respectfully ask to be discharged and to be author- 
ized to turn over to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution the building itself, 
and to the United States Treasury w'hatever balance of money may remain after 
liquidating the last liability on account of the construction of the edifice. 

The appropriations which had been made for the building- were as 
follows: 

Building $250, 000 

Steam heating apparatus 25, 000 

Water, gas, and electric apparatus 12, 500 

Marble and tile flooring 26, 000 

Special sewer connection 1, i)00 

Total 315, 400 

The subjects intended to be represented in the new building were 
stated by Secretary Baird, in his report for 1879, to be as follows: 

The period of complete installation of collet^tions on hand and the opening of tlie 
building to the public will depend upim the amount of the appropriation and the 
rajiidity with which the contractors may complete their work. The new building 
will l)e devoted more particularly to industrial exhibits, intended to show the 
animal and mineral resources of the United States and their practical ai>pli(ations 
to the wants or luxuries of iiiuu. Tiie department of anthr()[)()i()gy will also be 
largely represented. How far natural history can find a place in the building will 
depend upon the space required for the collei'tions mentioned. It is confidently 
expected that this l)uilding when finished will be one of the most attractive objects 
of the kind extant and but little inferior to the celebrated museums of foreign 
countries. 



248 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

In lii.s report for 1880 he says: 

1 now have the pleasure of stating that the work liaa been in the greater part 
completed during the j^ear 1880 and that a portion of the building is already occu- 
l)ied for its legitimate objects. 

The details of progress and completion will be given in full in the report of the 
building committee and of the architect, to which I would refer. It will be suffi- 
cient to say here that the work has all been done within the estimates and that it 
promises to be even more suitable to its purpose than was anticipated. All the 
requirements in regard to liglit and heat are fully met, and in this respect and in 
that of its slight cost in proportion to the space obtained, the building is believed to 
have no parallel in the country. Including the l)uilding i^roper, the steam heating 
a])paratus, the gas and water fixtures, and- all their accessories, the cost has 
amounted to less than $3 per square foot of ground floor and to about 6 cents per 
cul)ic foot of entire capacity. 

The first use of the building was for the inaugural reception to 
President Garfield on March 4, 1881, which was granted in accordance 
with the following resolution of the Regents at a meeting held on 
December 8, 1880: 

Whereas the new Museum building is unfinished and not ready for occupancy of 
the Government collections, and whereas such a contingency will not again occur, 
and that no precedent is to be given for the use of the building for other purposes: 

Remlred, That the use of the new National Museum building be granted for the 
inaugural reception of the President of the United States on the 4th of March, 1881, 
and that the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution be authorized to make all 
necessary arrangements for this purpose. 

In 1881 Professor Baird stated that the building might then be con- 
sidered as completed and ready for its final occupation by the various 
departments which have been assigned to it. Some small additions and 
alterations were still required to be made, but they did not interfere 
with the general use of the structure. In the beginning certain oflice 
and lal)oratorv quarters were granted to the United States Geological 
Survey, especially in the northeast pavilion, and they continued to be 
so used for several years. 

It was soon recognized that the building was too small topix)vide all 
the necessary accommodations, even though the Museum continued in 
possession of the same space in the Smithsonian building as before, 
and the inconvenience from this source increased rapidly with time. It 
thus also resulted that not all of the halls could be used for exhi))ition 
purposes as intended, and until lately some of them have always been 
closed to the public, that they might be employed for storage, for 
unpacking, or for workrooms. 

There have been from the beginning many changes in the assign- 
ment of space to the different dejxirtments, but transfers from one 
building to the other have been few since the occupation of the newer 
structure. The clearing up of the exhibition halls, which were never 
in as good condition as now, has ])een mainly accomplished by the 
heroic method of sending large (juantities of specimens to outside stor- 



Report 0? U. S. National Museum, 1 903— Rathbun, 



Plate 17. 




KATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 249 

ajre and b}" the fitting up of a few outside workrooms. Another factor 
in this direction has lieen the construction of a nunibei' of galleries, 
as explained below. 

Secretary Baird says, in his report for 1882, that — 

The Museum building was received from tlie hands of the architects in so complete 
a state that but Httle remained to be done beyond the tinting of a portion of the 
walls and the filling up of some of the alcoves with canvas frames, etc. There is 
yet much to be done, however, in the construction of the necessary cases for the 
accommodation of collections. 

The building of cases has, in fact, never ceased, for, while the more 
urgent needs were early supplied, cases of one description or another 
have been added from year to year. Many cases used at national 
expositions have been returned in so defaced a condition that it has 
been necessary to reject or rebuild them, and cases of new and im- 
proved patterns have replaced many of the older ones. 

In 1883 Professor Baird remarks that the "building continues to 
preserve the reputation it has acquired as representing the maximum 
of convenience and adaptation to its purposes with the minimum of 
original cost and expense for repairs;" and in 1885 he states that the 
''building is in excellent condition and has required comparative!}' 
little in the way of repairs." 

After not many years, however, certain weak points began to 
develop, and these have been the cause of nmch concern and have 
necessitated almost continuous repairs, though seldom at great expense. 
The w^alls are essentially substantial, but the roof was constructed at too 
little cost and is far below the standard of the brickwork. Its weak- 
ness and incompleteness is evident both in the supporting framework 
and in the covering. The framework has given way in places under 
heavy falls of snow, and the covering has developed numerous leaks, 
most commonly about the breaks in the roof, but elsewhere as well, 
and the constant attention of one mechanic has been insufficient to 
keep these leaks under control. While it is intended soon to renew 
the worst of this covering, it is now quite certain that a considerable 
part of the roof must be Avholh^ rebuilt before many 3^ears. 

The leaks from the roof have so constantly defaced the inside walls 
of the naves and courts that only recently has it been deemed advisa- 
ble to repaint them, a work which was mainly accomplished during 
1!»02 and 1!)08, and which has greatly improved the appearance of the 
exhibition halls. 

The principal other changes in the interior of the building, in the 
nature of permanent improvements, have been the replacement of the 
wooden floors with cement, the building of galleries in nearly all 
the halls, and the addition of some skylights. The first has improved 
both the conditions and the ap})earance of the halls, and as the floors 
were without proper foundation the foriner wooden covering was 



250 REPORT OF NATIONAL MITREFM, 1903, 

inadc((ujite to keep out the moisture or impurities froui tiie soil. The 
«;alleries have materially increased the amount of space, and the new 
skylights were rendered necessary by their introduction. These fea- 
tures ma}' be briefly referred to as follows: 

In some of the preliminary drawings for the museum building a tier 
of galleries is shown in each of the exhibition halls, but in the plans as 
finally adopted and presented to Congress these features were not 
represented. The height of the several halls, however, was made 
sufiicient to permit of their introduction at any time. In view of the 
failure to secure earl}^ action by Congress toward the erection of a 
third building, it was decided to urge the construction of these gal- 
leries, in order that some additional space might be acquired. The 
entire sum needed for such a purpose was not requested at once, but 
the estimates for 1893, 1894, 1895, and 1896 each contained an item of 
$8,000, These failed to receive favorable consideration by Congress, 
but the amount named was appropriated in the sundry civil act for 
1897, and other aj^propriations followed, namely, $8,000 in 1898, 
$10,000 in 1899, and $5,000 in 1902, making a total of $31,000 for this 
purpose. From this amount galleries were erected in all the halls, 
courts, and ranges, except the north hall and the northeast and east- 
north ranges. In the southeast range the galleries have been extended 
so as to form a complete second floor. Though intended primarily 
for exhibition purposes, it has been necessary to assign certain of the 
galleries to the storage of reserve collections and as workrooms, as 
elsewhere explained. 

The only substantial floors laid in the beginning were those in the 
rotunda and the four main halls, as already described, the former 
being of encaustic tiles, the latter of marble squares. The remaining 
floors in all parts of the main building were of wood. The latter 
were allowed to remain until thoroughly worn out, being graduall}^ 
replaced by more durable material. These changes began in 1891 and 
were not completed until 1900, The first of the new floors, and, in 
fact, the greater naml)er, were constructed of cement, granito, and 
granolithic; the last four were made of terrazzo pavement, small 
irregular pieces of marble, laid in cement, and are the most satisfac- 
tory , in appearance at least. 

The other work of repair and alteration, conducted at the expense 
of the general appropriation for this purpose, need not be analyzed 
here. It has produced, as a whole, many marked improvements, 
though for the most part it has been directed toward maintaining the 
building' in as fair a condition as the funds have permitted.

NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDING. 

DESCRIPTION. 

In describiiif,^ the present Museum buildino-/' the architects, Messrs. 
Chiss & Schulze, spoke of it as follows: 

A modernized Romanesque style of architecture was adopted for the new building 
in order to keep up a relationship with the Smithsonian building, which is designed 
in Norman, a variety of this style. To modernize this style was found necessary 
on account of the different building material, and to do justice to the purj)Oses of the 
building with its modern demands of perfect safety and elegance of construction, of 
greatest possible available floor space, of easy communications, efticient drainage, a 
well-calculated and pleasing admission of light, free circulation of air, and all other 
hygienic dicta. 

The external architecture is based upon the general arrangement of the interior, 
and shows plainly the prominence of the four naves and the careful management of 
the light for the central portion of the building. The main entrances are in the 
centers of each facade between two lofty towers of 86 feet height, which act as but- 
tresses for the naves. Between the towers, and receding from the doorways, there 
are large arched windows set with ornamented glass, and above those the gables of 
the naves are formed; they contain inscrij^tion plates, and are crowned by allegorical 
groups of statuary. The group over the northern gable, designed by C. Buberl, of 
New York, already in position, introduces Columbia as the protectress of science and 
industry. * * * 

On the whole, the one-story plan which has prevailed among experts ever since 

he Paris exhibition of 1867 has been adopted. But by the introduction of upper 

stories on those outlying sections reserved for offices, ample office room has been 

secured without encroaching materially upon the floor space within the square of 

300 feet to which the building was primarily limited. 

Whatever ma}^ be the style of architecture represented, the exterior 
of the building- can not lay claim to dignity of appearance or to any 
degree of esthetic merit, although by a symmetrical arrangement of 
towers and payilions some relief is giyen to the low outer walls, and, 
viewed a short distance off, the tops of the former mingle with the 
roofs and lantern skylights to produce a not unpicturesque, though 
crude, effect. The walls are of brick, the roofs principally of iron 
and slate. The former were well constructed, and should long remain 
in good condition, ])ut the latter were early found to be, in greater 
part, unsuita})lo and insecure. These defects were largely due to the 
smallness of the appropriation, only $250,000, which did not permit 
of the best class of workmanship and material, and the failure to pro- 
duce a Ijetter architectural effect can probably also be accounted for 
in the same way. 

The interior is plain, and its walls are frequently defaced through 
the imperfections of the roofs, but the many criticisms which, from 
the beginning, have been directed against the arrangement of the 
building are entirely unwarranted. For the purpose for which it 
was erected, the exhibition of specimens, it probal)ly has no superior

in this country and few, if any, abroad. The critics have simply con- 
founded cheapness and crudeness with inadaptation to purpose. It is 
a square Imikling of a single story, consisting of four large naves 
and a central rotunda in the shape of a Greek cross, with ranges and 
covered courts filling in the corners, so as to produce a solid or 
continuous structure every part of which, under the original plan, 
was well lighted. The ranges have large windows, and the naves and 
courts both skylights and clerestory' windows. It is the plan so often 
adopted for exposition buildings, and also at times for permanent 
structures, and is especially convenient to the visitor, in that he has 
no stairs to climb. There has at no time in the past been any difficulty 
in so installing the display collections that they could be distinctly 
seen and the labels read. Within a few years, however, galleries have 
been built in nearly all the halls, as it was necessary to increase the 
amount of space. The height of the halls has permitted this to be 
done without injury to the general effect, but to some extent the light- 
ing has been interfered with, though not so much but that it can be 
remedied. 

This building was planned, as above stated, essentiall}^ for exhibi- 
tion purposes. The space available for laboratories and storage 
quarters, however, is wholly inadequate, though convenient and well 
lighted. This may be considered as one of the main defects of the 
interior, as it is the one most noticeable to the specialist who wants 
working room, and seldom refers to the exhibition series. A remed}' 
for this condition, I'ecommended and urged upon Congress by Pro- 
fessor Baird, was the erection of a smaller fireproof building nearby, 
entirel}'^ for laborator}" and storage needs, and especiall}" for the safe- 
guarding of the alcoholic collections. His ideas were never carried 
out, but it is hoped that in the new building all of these requirements 
will be provided. 

The building has, moreover, served an excellent purpose as an 
object lesson, since the experience gained in its construction and fur- 
nishing, and in the installation of its collections, has been invaluable 
in the preparations for the newer structure. It will undoubtedly con- 
tinue to l)e occupied for many years to come, and its complete repair 
will prol)abl3' be undertaken as soon as the new 1)uilding is finished. 

The l)nilding under description stands on the southeast corner of the 
reservation granted to the Smithsonian Institution b}' the fundamental 
act of 1846, and, in fact, overreaches its eastern boundary to about 
the extent of the width of Ninth street SW. Its north or front face is 
about on a line with the south face of the Smithsonian building, from 
which its nearest corner is distant about 50 feet, while its rear face 
adjoins the sidewalk on B street south. 

The main part of the building is about 300 feet square and one stor}^ 
high throughout, though of very different elevations. In the center

of each front, at the sides of the entrance, are two tall towers, and at 
the corners are large pavilions, all of which project about 12^ feet 
from the main walls, thus making" the extreme linear dimensions of 
the l)uilding al)out 325 feet. The amount of ground covered is 97,786 
square feet, or about 2i acres. 

The primary feature of the plan consists of four naves or main 
halls, the largest in the l)uilding, which radiate in the form of a Greek 
cross from a central rotunda to the towers above mentioned. Follow- 
ing the outer walls and extending from the naves to the pavilions are 
a series of eight ranges, two on each side. This arrangement leaves 
four courts, inclosed by the naves and ranges, which are roofed over 
and form parts of the actual building. There are, therefore, 17 halls 
in the body of the building, all designed for exhibition purposes. 
These halls are separated })y heavy brick walls, having numerous 
broad arched openings reaching nearly to the ceiling. The lower part 
of these openings both from the floor and from the galleries are tilled 
in with cases or screens, excejit where needed as passageways. The 
main halls open broadly into the rotunda. There is one entrance into 
each court, and one at each end of the several ranges for the circula- 
tion of the public. 

The central rotunda attains the greatest height. It is octagonal 
below, with a maxinmm diameter of 65 feet, and is surmounted by a 
16-sided polygon, 67 feet in diameter, which contains a tier of large 
windows, and is covered with a slate roof rising to a central lantern. 
The height is 77 feet on the side walls, and 108 feet to the top of the 
lantern finial. The four main halls, extending from the inner walls of 
the towers to the rotunda, are 117 feet long by 65 feet wide, their 
height being 42 feet to the top of the side walls, and 56 feet to the 
ridge of the roof. The courts are about 63 feet square and of the 
same wall height as the main halls. The ranges are all a little less than 
50 feet wide. Those on the north and south sides of the building are 
89 feet long, and those on the east and west sides 63 feet long, the 
lesser length of the latter being due to extensions from the adjoining 
pavilions. They are covered with lean-to roofs, their interior height 
being 26^ feet at the outer walls and 31 feet at the inner. 

The several divisions of the building are clearly indicated on the 
exterior by the unequal heights of the walls and roofs. A description 
of these features as seen when approaching the north front will answer 
for the other sides, as all are essentially alike. In the center of the 
north front is the main entrance, bordered In- a tall, arched frame- 
work of Ohio sandstone. Above and back of the entrance are the face 
and gable end of the north hall, reaching to a height of about 55 feet 
above the ground, bearing a stone plate with the inscription "National 
Museum, 1S79."' and surmounted by an allegorical group of statuary 
representing Columbia as the protectress of science and industry. At 



254 IlEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903, 

each side of the entrance is one of the towers above mentioned, about 
27 feet square and three stories high, topped by a steep roof, with 
small dormer windows toward the base. The extreme heights of these 
towers is 85i feet to the top of the tinial. 

Extending on each side from the towers to the corner pavilions are 
curtain walls, 27i feet high and 87 feet long, with seven broad, arched 
windows, 8 feet 10 inches wide and 13 feet 7 inches high, the glass in 
the latter being arranged in three vertical series. Between the win- 
dows are narrow buttresses, uniting above in arches. The pavilions 
are about 40 feet square and 36i feet high to the eaves, the roofs being 
nuich lower and flatter than on the towers. They are divided into 
three stories, besides a basement, each lighted by eight large, arched 
windows, except the upper story, which has three small windows 
grouped in the center on each side. The top of each pavilion has a 
large lantern sk3dight. 

From the curtain walls the lean-to metal roof rises over the ranges 
with moderate slope, and abuts against the higher walls of the courts 
and main halls, both of which have a row of clerestory windows on 
each side facing the ranges, those of the main halls extending back only 
as far as the courts. The courts have a large square lantern, from 
Avhich the roof descends on all four sides to the level of the gutters on 
the main halls. The main halls have plain hip roofs about the same 
height as those of the courts, with elongate lantern skylights in the 
middle. The dome of the rotunda, as before explained, rises above 
all other portions of the roof, being the most conspicuous feature of 
the top of the building. All the roofs are covered with slate except 
those of the ranges, which are of tin. The slates are nailed to small 
pieces of wood, fitted into small L-shaped pieces of iron, and the plas- 
ter of the ceiling is laid directly upon the rough inner surface so 
formed. Besides the lanterns before mentioned, a number of small 
skylights and ventilators have been built over some of the ranges and 
courts, especially where the recently constructed galleries have inter- 
fered with the lighting. 

The entire framework, as well as the inner sheathing of the roofs, 
are exposed to view, this plan having been followed in the interest 
of economy. The roofs of the main halls, the rotunda, and the courts 
are supported ])y iron trusses of the Pratt pattern ; those over the 
ranges by triangular girders of rivited angle iron. In 1894 some of 
the purlines in the main halls near the rotunda l)egan to l)uckle and 
were reenforced with angle iron. By 1900 all of the iron work over 
the main halls had begiui to show" sigiis of weakness, caused l)y alternate 
expansion and contraction, thus producing msuiy leaks in the slate 
co\ering, and the entire framework was accordingly braced and 
strengthened by means of angle steel. The woodwork about the lan- 
terns was also replaced by irou; and other improvements were made. 



NATIONAL MITSKUM BUILDINGS. 255 

The inner surface of all tlie roofs was originallj^ covered with a thin 
coat of plaster. In the ranges the metal top was underlaid h}^ fireproof 
gratings, to which the plaster was applied. As the keying proved 
insufficient or the plaster not strong enough, large pieces began to 
give way at the very beginning, and to eliminate this source of danger 
all the plaster was removed in the ranges, leaving the gratings uncov- 
ered. After })eing painted, however, the appearance of the ceiling 
proved not to be out of keeping with its surroundings. In one range 
the ceiling was at the same time covered with corrugated iron, leaving 
an air space between it and the tin roof above, and it was thought by 
the architects that this arrangement would tend to regulate the tem- 
perature of the halls. Nothing further, however, has been done in 
this direction. 

Through failure to secure additional space b}^ the erection of a new 
building, galleries began to be added in the present building in 1896, 
and their construction was continued from year to 3'ear until 19(»2. 
They are now contained in all the halls except the north hall and the 
north-east and east-north ranges, while in the south-east range the}" 
have l)een united so as to form a complete second story. The main 
entrances to the galleries are from the rotunda, and nearly the entire 
series ma}" be traversed without descending to the floor. The width 
of the galleries is from 10 to 14 feet and their height above the floor 
1<) feet. The}" are of very simple construction, consisting of plain 
iron pillars and girders, with brick archways and cement floors. The 
area gained by this means has amounted to 25,828 square feet. 

All of the masonry of the exterior walls above ground, except as 
noted below, is of red brick laid in black mortar, with numerous hor- 
izontal courses of black brick, and a considerable quantity of bufl' 
brick in courses and designs to relieve the monotony of color. A 
number of blue brick were originally employed in connection with 
the buff, but they were subsequently painted black. There is a base 
course of granite around the entire Imilding, but the window sills, 
copings, etc., are of gray Ohio sandstone. 

The interior walls are plastered in a sand finish, and were originally 
covered with a gray water-color paint, poorly adapted as a background 
for installation. The exhibition cases have been mainly constructed 
with mahogany frames, for which maroon was found to be a most har- 
monizing and efl'ective surrounding, and since about 1883 most of the 
walls have been painted this color to a height of about 12 feet from 
the floor, the original color remaining for the most part above. The 
only decorations were stenciled figures on the walls of the rotunda 
and over the archways at the inner ends of the main halls. In 1S>02, 
however, experiments were made looking to a change of color, with 
what is regarded as very satisfactory results. The colors used in the 
main halls and courts are a light red to a height of 15 feet, followed 



2f){^ rp:i'()KT ok national museum, ii»03. 

by a deep ivory, tho ceilings being of ti lighter ivory. In the rotunda 
the colors range from olive ])elow to ivory above, with stencil decora- 
tions as shoAvn in the plates. This color scheme has not' been extended 
to the ranges, which have been repainted from time to time in various 
colors. 

In connection with the original construction of the building, though 
undci- a special ap])r()priation, a floor of encaustic tiles was laid in the 
I'otunda, and tioors of marble squares of various colors in the four 
large halls or naves. The mar])le tiling is surrounded by a frieze of 
dark-blue slate, of sufficient width to bridge the ducts containing the 
steam pipes, wires, etc., while around the frieze is a border of parti- 
colored Portland cement. The floors in all the other halls were con- 
structed of yellow pine, partly in preparation for the Garfield inaugu- 
ral ball of March 4, 1S81, out of the local fund for that purpose. 
These floors were laid upon a concrete base and began to decay after 
a very few years, requiring frequent and extensive repairs. In 1.S91 
it became necessary to replace several of them with more substantial 
material, and this continued down to 1808, when the last of the wooden 
floors disappeared. The substitutes have l)een cement, granito, and 
finally terrazzo, the last being the most pleasing and apparcMitl}- the 
most durable. Other floor changes have consisted in the laying of 
mosaic pavements in the vestibules of the main entrance and the north- 
west entrance. In the pavilions and towers the different stories are 
separated by arches of l^rick and concrete, supported by iron beams, 
the floor covering being of Florida pine. Thus the building has been 
rendered essentially fireproof in all parts of its' construction. 

An octagonal fountain basin, 20 feet in diameter, composed of a rim 
of molded polished granite and cement floor, occupies the middle of 
the rotunda. From its center rises the original plaster model of the 
goddess of liberty which, in bronze, surmounts the Dome of the 
United States Capitol. 

As before stated, the building was constructed with four main 
entrances, one at the center of each front, but only two of these are 
now used as such, that on the north side being for the public and that 
on the east side for the delivery of supplies and specimens. The 
entrances on the south and west have been closed and, together with 
the adjacent space, converted into headquarters for the departments 
of biology and anthropology, respectively. There is also a small 
entrance on the south side of the northwest pavilion leading directly 
to the administrative offices. 

The north, or main, entrance has two sets of double doors of l)lack 
walnut paneled wMth h(>avy plate glass, the large arched space above 
being filled in with a latticework of walnut set with glass. In front 
of the entrance is a mosaic platform, bordered by granite coping, and

a|)i)i'Oiiched by four low oninitc stops 37 feet lonj^, which urc flanked 
by molded base blocks cariying large candelabra. 

The sinallness of the original appropriation prevented the construc- 
tion of a basement under the main building, which would have added 
a large amount of space for storage and workrooms. Small cellars 
were built, however, under the southwest pavilioti for the heating 
boilers and th(^ supply of fuel and under the northwest and northeast 
pavilions for miscellaneous storage. Advantage was taken of the 
changes in the heating plant in IDOl to construct an underground tun- 
nel, leading from the northwest pavilion of the Museum building jO 
the east wing of the Smithsonian building, primarily to convey the 
heating pipes, electrical conduits, etc., but of suitable dimensions to 
serve as a passageway' for individuals, being 7<> feet long, 5 feet wide, 
and 7 feet high. It has proved of great convenience in stormy weather, 
l)ut tills a much more important purpose at night 1)V giving the small 
watch force a ready means of communication between the two buildings. 

The building is exceedingly well lighted, considering its solid, one- 
stor}' construction. The ranges are amply provided with large win- 
dows, the higher naves and courts have both skylights and clerestory 
windows, and the naves also receive much light from the large win- 
dows between the central towers. The exhibition collections can, 
therefore, as a rule, be readily seen, though the galleries are responsible 
for the creation of some dark places which did not formerly exist. 
The lighting of the rooms in the towers and pavilions is also excellent. 
The windows are practically all of the same general pattern, and in 
the beginning all were glazed with double panes of glass, the better 
tj retain the heat in winter, but about half of these double panes in 
the towers and pavilions have been made single. Ventilation is pro- 
vided for b}^ means of movable panes of glass in the side windows and 
lanterns, many sashes being pivoted in iron frames for that purpose, 
and also in places by ventilators in the roof. 

In 1881 the Museum was presented by the Brush Electrical Company 
with a number of storage cells and a dynamo suitable for operating 
between 30 and 40 incandescent and ir)-candle power lamps in the 
lecture hall when evening meetings were held. In 1895 the basement 
of the south tower of the Smithsonian Institution was furnished with 
a gas engine and d3'namo of sufficient power to maintain a small system 
of incandescent lamps in the Smithsonian offices and in a number of 
workrooms and other dark places in both buildings. This plant was 
totally inadequate for the requirements, however, and Congress 
appropi-iated $3,500 in I'.tOl, and $5,000 iji 15H)2, for a complete instal- 
lation of electric wires and iixtures throughout the Museum building, 
which was practically finished in the latter 3^ear, the work being done 
by empk)yees of the Museum. This installation extends to the public 
halls, offices, laboratories, storerooms, and workshops, but in the 
NAT MUS 1903 17 



258 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Smithsonian building it reaches only some of the offices and corridors, 
a few storerooms, and the dark center of the main exhi})ition hall. 
The current for lighting is taken from the mains of one of the city 
companies at the southwest corner of the Museum building. On only 
a few occasions has the entire Museum building been lighted at night, 
and regular night opening for the public can not be undertaken without 
an additional appropriation to cover the extra expense of electric 
current and watchmen. 

All of the cases in the cxhiliition halls containing especially valu- 
able specimens, as in the historical and gem collections, are supplied 
with electric burglar alarms. There is also a system of electric call 
boxes distributed through both l)uildings, which must be visited every 
hour during the night watches, any failure to perform this service 
being at once automaticallv announced at the office of the IVIutual Dis- 
trict Messenger Company in the city. For the prompt conduct of 
l)usiness it has likewise been found necessary to make extensive use of 
the telephone system for conmiunication between offices in different 
parts of the building and with the city. 

The heating of the Museum building was until 1901 accomplished 
t)y means of four 60-horsepower steam boilers. In the latter year 
these were replaced by two 150-horsepower high-pressure tubular 
boilers, whose capacity is sufficient to heat both of the large buildings 
and the smaller adjacent Iniildings on the Mall. The boiler room is in 
the basement of the southwest pavilion. There are also two boilers of 
48-horsepower in the basement of the Smithsonian building, which 
can be used in case of emergency. The new plant is ver}' satisf actor}", 
and much more economical than .the old one. 

Soon after the Museum building was completed, the north-west range 
was set apart as a temporary lecture hall, being furnished with a plat- 
form, lantern screen, and several hundred folding chairs. This was 
one of the smaller ranges, and proving inadequate for the require- 
ments, its fittings, somewhat improved, were transferred to the west- 
north range, which continued to be assigned to this purpose, though 
sometimes used for the preparation of exhibits, until the increasing 
demands for exhibition space caused it to be turned over to the Depart- 
ment of Anthropology. It was found, however, practically essential 
to have some place for scientific meetings, and by placing material in 
storage it became possible to vacate for this purpose the east- north 
range, immediately to the cast of the main entrance, and thus equally 
as convenient as the former range. The hall remains in a condition 
suitable to be turned over to exhibition uses at any time, but its 
fixtures for lecture purposes are more permanent in character than 
before. The walls and ceiling have been painted in several tints of 
green. There is a large speaker's platform and a lantern screen, and 
on the opposite side a smaller platfoi'ui or balcony, where the lantern

can be pernianently installed. Movable armchairs arc used For seats, 
and a series of screens are in readiness to reduce or enlaroe the lecture 
si)acc, iiccordino- to the reciiiirenients. The furniture is entirely of 
oak. The preparation of this new lecture hall was accomplished in 
1J*(>1, under a special Cong-ressional appropriation. 

The thre(> Hoor i-oonis of the east tower soutii of tiie entrance, with 
a slio-ht addition for kitdien purposes, were utilized for a lunch room 
until iJXtl. In that year, however, the addition referred to was 
extended southward to a total length of 77 feet, thus somewhat enlarg-- 
u)<4- and inii)rovin.o- the conditions, but there is no way of providing a 
suitable lunch room in the present building, important as this feature 
is to the employees and to such visitors as spend nuich time about the 
Museum. 

In connection with the plans of the building (pp. :^lH)-8()2) a list is 
given of the halls and of all the rooms contained in the several towers 
and pavilions, together with their sizes and an explanation of the uses 
to which each is put. The exhibitions in geology and in anthi-opology, 
except the single division of arclKoology, are entirely in this building.' 
In biology only the mammals, reptiles, fishes, and comparative anat- 
omy are represented here, the remaining divisions being provided for 
in the Smithsonian building. All of the galleries as well as the halls 
were designed for exhibition purposes, but three or four of the former 
are now used for storage, and one for the library. The administra- 
tive offices and the head(juarters for the three scientific departments 
are in this building, as well as most of the scientific laboratories. 

BUILDING FOR THE ALCOHOLIC COLLECTIONS. 

Professor Baird stated in his report for 1S.S4 that— 

The presence of alcoholic sjiecimens in larjie nnmbers, so important in a scien- 
tific point of view, fircatly endangers the safety of mnseiun Iniildings and their con- 
tents, and most of the e8ta1)lishments in Europe have lately taken the precaution to 
construct separate buildings peculiarly adapted for the purpose. An application was 
nia.le at the last session of Congress for an appropriation to put up a similar build- 
ing in the grounds of the Institution, but it was not acted upon favorably. 

The estimate was as follows: 

For the erection ..f a fireproof brick storage building east of the National Museum, 
for receiving, unpacking, a.ssorting, and storing the natural-historv collections of the 
Government, to replace the wooden structures now used for the puri^ose, $10,000. 

The estimates were renewed for 1S8H and 1887 in the following 
terms: 

For the erection of a fireproof building f,.r storing the alcoholic .•oUections of the 
National ^luscum, Sl.5,000. 

(Note. -The safety of the interior of the National Museum and the Smithsonian 
building IS en<langer..d by thr large nunil)er of alcoholic specimens kept therein, and

have a sepandc l)nilding for tlieir reception and preservation. There are at present 
no suitable accommodations for these collections. ) 

In 1885 Secretaiy Baird remarked that — 

Although the present building is ])ractically tirei)roof, yet shoul<l a tire b(^ started 
in the vicinity of these [the alcoholic] specimens it is probable that much damage 
would be done by the ignition of the many thousands of gallons of alcohol, and the 
destruction of the specimens and of the jars in which they are contained. 

Again in 1886 he refers to the danoer of tiie destruction not only of 
the alcoholic specimens themselves, but of other near-by collections 
should fire break out among the former. All of these propositions 
failed to receive consideration and the matter was not renewed, as it 
was then expected to make provision for the alcoholic specimens in the 
proposed new Museum building. 

In connection with the appropriations for I8t)9, however, an esti- 
mate was submitted to Congi'ess for a larger fireproof building to 
serve essentially the same purpose, fronting on B street south, ])etween 
the National Museum and the Army INIedical Museum, ap])r()priate in 
appearance to the former l>uil(lin^-. It was designed to be 130 feet 
longb}^ 50 feet wide, and intended to be used for both workshops and 
storage purposes, thus replacing all of the temporary liuildings then 
in use. It failed to receive favorable action, however. The wording 
of the item was as follows: 

For the erection of a fireproof building for workshop and storage purposes for the 
National Museum, said l)uilding to be constructed mider the direction of the Super- 
intendent of the Library of Congress in accordance with the approval of the Secretary 
of the Smithsonian Institution, $50,000. 

TEMPORARY AND RENTED BUILDINGS. 

The crowded conditions in the Smithsonian and Museum buildings 
have necessitated the erection from time to time of small frame struc- 
tures on the Smithsonian and Armory squares, and the renting of build- 
ings south of B street south, for the requirements either of workshops 
and storage, or of the preparation of exhi})its for expositions. The 
use of the Armory building and the erection of a brick laboratory have 
already been referred to. 

In 1882 a shed was built to the westward of the Armory building, a 
part of which was used for the shelter of Fish Commission call's, and 
the remainder filled with the collections received from the permanent 
exhibition l)uilding in Philadelphia. A second shed was subsequently 
added for the purposes of the National Museum, but only one of these 
now remains and is utilized by the Museum. 

The larg(> amoimt of work incident to the preparation of collections 
for the exhibitions at Cincinnati, Louisville, and New Orleans made it 
necessar}' to put up a s|)ecial frame building, which was done at the 
expense of the exposition fund during the summer of 1884. It meas-

urcd iil)t)ut ion by 50 feet, unci was located alono- B Street south, a 
short distance to the east of the Museum buildiii*^-. Jt was also made 
to serve for the temporary storage of the material brougdit back from 
those exhibitions. Some small additions were made and a loft con- 
structed. It remained in use imtil 1887. when it was torn down and 
the materials of its construction were utilized elsewhere. During- 
more or less of the period of its existence it furnished accommodations 
to the taxidermists, and osteoloo-ists, and to other preparators, includ- 
ing- those of the Bureau of Ethnolog}-. In it were also stored large 
quantities of specimens, especially geological and ethnological. 

In 1887 two low sheds were ))uilt along the south side of and close 
to the Smithsonian building, one on each side of the south tower, and 
extending nearly the entire length of each facade. They were con- 
structed largely of material from the ])uilding last al)ove mentioned, 
and were both unsightly and dangerous in their proximity to the 
Smithsonian building. The west shed was at tirst cut up into 
seven workshops and storage compartments. The east shed was, for 
a time, given over to living animals, but when these were I'emoved to 
the Zoological Park it was used for the storage of easels and supplies. 
Both sheds wen* more or less employed in the preparations for the 
World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago. Their removal was 
effected in 1898, under the provisions of an act of Congress giving 
$2,500 for the purpose. The material derived from them was used 
partly in building a shed at the Ninth street annex, referred to below, 
and partly in the erection of the so-called south shed on the Mall 
directly south of the south tower of the Smithsonian building. 

The National Zoological Park grew out of a small assemblage of 
living animals gathered at the National Museum. The first part of 
this collection was received from the West in 1887 and was installed 
in one end of the eastern of the two sheds along the south side of the 
Smithsonian. Additional specimens obtained in the early part of 
1S88 madjc it necessary to utilizt* the entire building for this purpose. 
Later in the year yards were constructed in the grounds south of the 
Smithsonian building for ])uli'alo and deer, and several small buildings 
were also erected. During 1S91 the li^■ing animals were transferred 
to th(> park, and the inclosures and buildings which they had occupied 
\v(ir(> all removed except the eastern shed and one small shed farther 
out on the grounds which was modified into a paint shop. 

In the winter of l881>-90 the first of the frame buildings now con- 
stituting the Astrophysical Observatory was erected south of the 
eastern end of the Smithsonian })uilding. It was subsequently slightlv 
enlarged, and thn^e other smaller structures were added in 1893 and 
189S. The fence inclosing this cluster of buildings has recentlv been 
enlarged to afford sonn* open-air space for experimental purposes, the 
extent of the area now covered being about 170 by 78 feet. 



262 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Ill i8!*S ti frame buildiiit;' of two ytories, called the "south shed," was 
built on the grounds south of the south tower of the Smithsonian 
buildin<;\ ))eing- separated from it b}' the roadway and a strip of lawn. 
It is about 53 feet long, -iO feet wide, and 23 feet hig-h to the eaves. It 
contains the taxidermists' laboratories for mammals and various work- 
shops. 

The only structures now standing on the Mall near the Smithsonian 
and Museum liuildings are the laboratory and stable building, the soutii 
shed, and the buildings of the Astrophysical Observatory. This clear- 
ing of the grounds, however, has onl}^ been rendered possible through 
the appropriation of funds by Congress for the renting of outside 
l)uildings, chiefly south of B street south, and not far distant from the 
Museum, as follows: 

Louisiana avenue near Tenth street NW., from March 15, 1894, to 
June 30, 1895, a period of lifteenth months and sixteen days, at $75 a 
month. 

A part of the old Belt Line street-car stable, corner of B and Third 
streets SW., from Juh^ 1, 1895, to March 31, 1896, nine months, at 
175 a month. 

No. 431 Ninth street SW., from April 1 to June 30, 1896, three 
months, at $75 a month; from July 1, 1896, to date, at $166.66 a month, 
the increase being due to extensive improvements in buildings. 

No. 217 Seventh street SW., August, 1898, at $90 a month; Septem- 
ber 1, 1898, to June 30, 1899, ten months, at $120 a month; July 1, 
1899, to date, at $90 a month. 

No. 313 Tenth street SW., August 1, 1898, to June 30, 1901, thirty- 
five months, at $50 a month; July 1, 1901, to date, at $sO a month. 
The increased rental in this case was due to the erection of an addition 
to the original l)uilding. 

Rear of No. 915 Virginia avenue SW., August 1, 1898, to June 30, 
1899, eleven months, at $50 a month; July 1, 1899, to date, at $30 a 
month. 

The total amounts paid annually for rental of the above buildings 
were, therefore, as follows: 

1894 $263. 71 

1894-95 900. 00 

1895-9(5 900. 00

NEW NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDING. 
HISTORY. 

In his report for 1882 Secretary Baird discussed the inadequacy of 
the Museiuu ])uilding-, then scarcely more than a year old, to house the 
rapidl}' increasino- national collections or to provide for the Museum's 
own activities and those of the Geological Survey, the latter at that 
time l)eing partly carried on under the same roof. It was proposed 
that a third buildino- be erected on the southwest corner of the Smith- 
sonian reservation for the g-eolog'ical and mineralogical divisions of the 
Museum and for the accommodation of the Geological Survey. Sec- 
retary Baird's remarks t)n this su))iect were as follows: 

Large and capacious as is the new Museum l)uilding, it has proved already inade- 
quate to the existing requirements of the National Museum. Tiiis building was 
designeil primarily to acconunodate the vast number of industrial and economical 
exhibits i)resented to the United States by foreign governments at the close of the 
Philadelphia Exposition of 1876. A special appropriation was made bj- Congress for 
their transfer to Washington, and the armory building in the square between Sixth 
and Seventh streets was assigned for their reception. It required nearly sixty large- 
sized freight cars to transport the mass. 

Before the building was completed in 1881 and available for its purposes, almost 
equally enormous additions had l)een made to the (rollections of the various (Jovern- 
ment expeditions and of the Ethnological Bureau, wliich, together with many thou- 
sands of objects previously in charge of the Smitlisonian Institution, but for which 
there was no room in the old building, constituted a much larger mass than waa 



264 REPORT OF ISATIONAL MUP:rtUM, 1903. 

originally estimated. It is well known that at the close of the Centeiuiial Exjjosi- 
tion a company was organized to take charge of a large portion of the collections 
exhibited on that occasion, and with these and such additional articles as might 
be obtained to establish what was known as the "Permanent Exhibition" in the 
main Centennial building, which covers nearly 18 acres. This organization, after 
struggling for existence for several years, finally became unable to continue the effort 
and the collections in its charge were speedily scattered. Many of these had been 
presented to the National Museum with the understanding that they were to be left 
with the Permanent Exhibition Company for a period of at least a few years. ( )tliers, 
however, including many of the most valuable series, were obtained for the National 
Museum through the efforts of Mr. Thomas Donaldson. All these collections were 
carefully packed under his charge and stored in a building erected by him adjacent 
to the Centennial building. 

An appropriation was made by Congress to meet the cost of packing, shipping to 
Washington, and storing the collections in question. About twenty cars were 
required to transport them. They are now contained in a wooden Iniilding adjacent 
to the armory, tliere being absolutely no space for them in the National Musi'um. 

In addition to this a cabinet of at least doul)le the magnitude, made by the Insti- 
tute of Mining Engineers and deposited with the Pennsylvania Art Museum of I'hil- 
adelphia, has been offered to the Government simply on the condition of transfer to 
Washington and proper exhibition. This is an extremely important collection, illu- 
strating the mining resources and metallurgy of the United States and foreign coun- 
tries, and will constitute a most important addition to the means of instruction at the 
conunand of the Government. An appropriation will be asked, and it is hoped 
o])tained, for the purpose of transferring the collection to Washington; but some 
measures must be taken for its ultimate display. 

An even greater mass of additional material to be provided for wiin)e found in the 
industrial collections of the United States census of 1S80, and in the collections of tlie 
LI. S. Geological Survey. The census collections embrace more particularly the 
building stones of the country, the ores (especially of the precious metals), the com- 
bustibles, such as coal, petroleum, etc., and the forest timber. 

All these collections are of great magnitude, representing as nearly as possible a 
full series from all parts of the country. They ai'e carefully lal)eled and recorded, 
and will be accompanied by full descriptions. 

The building-stone collection is especially valuable, consisting, as it does, of many 
thousands of samples of marl)le, granite, sandstone, and other substances, for the 
most part dressed in 4-inch cubes, each of the faces showing a different surfac and 
treatment. 

It is not believed that any established quarry remains unrepresented in this series, 
while many extremely valuable deposits of ornamental and building stones are pre- 
sented therein for the first time. Preparations are in progress for testing the strength, 
resistance to torsion and crushing force, and economical properties of all these sam- 
l>les. The collection is now so far advanced that when a public l)uilding is to be 
erected either by the States or the General Government it will be possi])le to show 
specimens of all the best Imilding stones in the vicinity of the locality involved, and 
to present all the necessary data as to availability, durability, cost of production, etc. 
Much use has already been made of the collection by the commissioners of State caj)- 
itals, county court-houses, etc., as well as by agents of the General Government. 

The collection of ores made by the census agencies is also very extensive, that of 
iron l)eing particularly large. Nearly every iron mine of any prominence in the 
United States has been visited and samples carefully selected by experts. These 
have l)een analyzed undiT the direction of Professor Pumpelly, and reports presented 
as to their chemical and metallurgical properties and economical value. All tiie 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 265 

orifrinals of this research are in charge of the Smithsonian Institution awaiting exhi- 
bition. The same may l)e said of similar researches in regard to the ores of all the 
other metals. 

The work of the V. S. Geological Survey, also of enormous magnitude— l)egun 
under Mr. Clarence King and continued under Maj. J. W. Powell— has resulted in 
the accmuulation of several tons of specimens of fossils, rocks, minerals, ores, and 
the like. Very few of these can at i^resent be exhil)ited for want of the necessary 
space. The survey requires a large number of experts and assistants, and is at pres- 
ent viTy badly accommodated. .Some twenty rooms in the new Museum building 
have l)een assigned as quarters for the Director of the Survey and his assistants. 

This, however, causes great inconvenience to the other work of the Museum, and 
as the survey now occupies a large building in "Washington, for which it pays con- 
siderable rental, and for want of <iuarters in Washington is obliged to scatter its 
stations over various parts of the United States, it is thought desiral)le to ask CVrti- 
gress for an appropriation to erect a second nuiseum building corresponding in general 
character to the first, l)ut on the opposite side of the square, along the line of Tweh'lh 

street. 

This building it is proposed to devote almost entirely to the mineral department 
of the National .Museum; and when completed to transfer to it everything of a geolog- 
ical and mineralogical nature, and also to prepare a portion of it especially for the 
accommodation of the (Geological Survey, which is at present so inconveniently pro- 
vided for. By way of economy it is proposed at first to construct what will repre- 
sent the western side of the building, in which oflice rooins and chemical and otlii-r 
laboratories can be provided for. 

It had been proposed to erect a separate building for the Geological Survey, dis- 
connected from the National Museum; but there being no ground available for this 
purpose, it was thought expedient to ask for an appropriation to furnish the required 
(piarters on the Smithsonian reservation, which is at present ample for the purpose. 

( )n the 10th of April last the following bill was accordingly introduced into the 
House of Representatives and referred to the Committee on Public Buildings and 
Grounds. The subject is still before that conunittee, and it is impossible to state 
what will be its fate during the present session. I would recommend action on the 
part of the Board of Regents in this connection, since long before the edifice can be 
completed the need for it will liecome extremely urgent. 

•'A. BILL (H. R. No. 57Sl)fi)r the erection of a fireproof building on the south portion of the Smith- 
sonian reservation, for tlie accommodation of the United States Geological Survey, and for other 
purposes. 

" Be it enacted, etc., That the sum of two hundred thousand dollars be, and hereby 
is, appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for 
the erection of a fireproof building on the south portion of the Smithsonian reserva- 
tion for the accommodation of the United States Geological Survey, and for other 
purposes: rrovUJed, That the consent of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution 
be first obtained thereto, and that the building be under their direction when com- 
pleted: And provided further, That tlie building be erected l)y the Architect of tlie 
Capitol, in accordance with plans approved by the Director of the United States 
(Geological Survey, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and the Arcliitt'ct 
of the Capitol acting as a board therefor." 

At the animal meeting of the Board of Regents on January 17, 
1883, Secretary Baird presented the report from which the above 
extract is taken, called attention to House 1)ill 5781, introduced in 
April, 1882, and urged the necessity for speedy action in relation to 



266 REroRr of national museum, l9on. 

!iii udditioHiil Imildiiiu' for the iis(» of the Musntiii and the Geological 
Survev, whereupon the loIlowinL;" resolution was adopted: 

Eesvlved, That the Board of Regentss of the Smithsonian Institution recommend to 
Congress to enlarge the National Museum, so as jn'opt'rly to cxiiihit the mineral, 
geological, and other eoUeetions already on hand and increasing each year, by the 
erection of a fireproof building on the southwest corner of the .Smithsonian reserva- 
tion, similar in style to the present N tional Museum; and they request an appro- 
priation of $;500,000 therefor, to be expended under the direction of the Regents of 
the Institution. 

It was also resolved — 

That the chancellor, General Sherman, and the Secretary be, and they are hereby, 
authorized and empowered to act fo and in the name of the Board of Regents in 
carrying into effect the provisions of any act of Congress which may be passed pro- 
viding for the erection of an additional building for the Nat'onal ^luseum. 

Further strong- reasons for the erection of an additional ])uilding 
were given iji the report of Secretary' Baird for 1SS8, in which he 
says : 

No better illustration can be hail of the increase in the collections of the National 
Museum than the fact that an additional l)uildiug is urgently required for their 
proper accommodation, as explained in the last report (1882). 

In 1875 the collections then in i-harge of the Smithsonian Institution were comfort- 
ably acconnnodated within the limits of the Smithsonian building, in rooms having 
an aggregate area of oO,000 s(juare feet. They consisted prini'i pally of specimens of 
natural history and etlmology; contini-d almost entirely to North America, with the 
exception of objects of Polynesian juanufacture, forming ])art of the "Wilkes collec- 
tion. 

In 1875 an appropriation was made by Congress to enable the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution and the Fish Commission to i)rei)are an exhibit of oljjects illustrating the 
resources of the United States, as derived from the animal and mineral kingdoms, 
and, with tlie assistance of a special appropriation to the Indian Bureau, of a collec- 
tion of No)-th American anthrcjpology. A large sum of money was expended in the 
preparation of this exhibit, which was forwarded to Philadelphia in 1876, and (!on- 
stituted a part of the Government disjjlay which attracted much attention. 

At the close of the Philadelphia exliibition veiy large donations were made to the 
United States by foreign I'ountries, including both the official commissioners and 
individual exhibitors. Many objects of much interest were contributed on the same 
occasion from American dis])lays. These collections, tilling some fifty freight cars, 
were brought to Washington and were stored for a time in the Armory Building, 
assigned l)y (-ongress for their reception. 

After several fruitless efforts, an appi'opriation of $250,000 was obtained for the 
purpose of ])utting up an ini'xpensive edifice for the storage of the.se articles, and 
their transfer was liegun in the autumn of 1881, but little more than two years ago. 

Since then large nundjcrs of collections of very great importance have come to 
hand, chief among them being the gatherings of the U. S. Geological Survey and of 
the Ethnological Bureau, made on a scale of unexampled magnitude and well 
befitting the operations of a nation like the United States. The many scientific 
explorations, ma<le either separately by the Smithsonian Institution or conjointly 
with the ITnited States Signal Service or other bureaus or bodies, the work of the 
Fish Commission, and the enormous aggregate of many smaller collections, have 
tended largely to increase the material to Ije provided for. 



NATIONAL MFSEFM — RTTILDTNGS. 267 

In ailditiiiii ti> this, the cxhihitiun liy the riiitcil States at Lomloii of ilhistrations 
of its fisheries (the freight Imlk nf w hirli am<iinite<l to not less than 24,000 cuVjic feet, 
and consistinji, in very large part, of new objects and articles obtained at the 
expense of the appropriations of Congress for that purpose) must also Ije provided 
for; a.s also the very valuable and extensive collections in mineralogy, geology, and 
njetallurgy made by the American Institute of ^Mining Engineers, and j)resented to 
the United States, but stored in i'liilaclel])liia awaiting an appropriation for its 
transfer. 

It may be stated in brief, therefore, that, at the present time, the vast building, 
finished scarcely more than two years ago, is now filled to overflowing; while there 
is additional material enough on hand belonging to the t:lovernment to occupy fully 
half of a second building of the same size, and Avith a probability that the entire 
space will be required lx»fore the construction can be accomplishe<l, even supposing 
that it is begun at the earliest possible time. 

The Smithsonian Institution lias always acted in hearty cooperation w itli the allili- 
ated scientific l)ranches of the Government even where no oflicial relationship 
existed, this being notably the case in regard to the U. S. Geological Survey. This 
important Bureau, in the rapid increase of its work, has been greatly hampered by 
want of the necessary accommodations; and it was with much gratification that the 
Institution proffered a share of the new building to the Director, jNIajor Powell, for 
the accommodation of his coUecticms, and for the office and laT)oratory work. It 
was, however, unable to do as much as was desirable, owing to the inadequacy of 
quarters for the purjiose. 

Should an approjiriation be made for the new building, for which the Board 
authorized application to Congress, it is intended to share it with the Geological Sur- 
vey so that it may have all the facilities required for its important work. 

It will be remembered that Congress in the act of 1846 set aside for the use of the 
Smithsonian Institution 20 acres in the southwest corner of the square bounded by 
Seventh and Twelfth streets and north and south B streets, the center of the Smith- 
sonian building being exactly in the middle of the square. It was in the southeast 
quarter of this reservation that the new Museum building was erected, forming a 
very unsymmetrical annex to the original Smithsonian building. It is now proposed 
to take the southwest corner of the reservation for the new edifice, which, when 
completed, will l)e essentially of the general character of the present Museum build- 
ng, and will restore the proper architectural balance. 

Congress has now been asked to make an a])proi)riation for one wing of this jiew 
building to be specially fitted for the use of the officers and laboratories of the 
National Museum and f)f the Geological Survey; and, if the amount' can be obtained 
at the present session, occupation of the building can be assured within eighteen 
months from the commencement of operations. The vacating of the rooms now 
occupied by the Geological Survey will also fnrnish nuich-neeiled accommodation to 
the Museum; possibly enough until the remainder of tlie building can be ])rovided 
for. The jirojxised wing, however, will be complete in itself, arrhiteeturally, and 
will not involve any addition for its proper harmonious effect.

appropriation hills for iSS5, hut failed to ho roportod to either House:

dermy, etc.; and for the offices and laboratorit's of tiie U. S. Geological Survey, 
to be erected under the direction and supervision of the Regents of the Smithsonian 
Institution, on the southwest corner of the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution, 
$200,000. 



268 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1908. 

From ISS'i uiilil ihv present time the necessity for ji ne^v Imilding- 
luis never ceased to bo the subject of greater or less attention by the 
Regents and the Secretary. In 1885, after noting the previous steps 
taken, Professor Baird remarked: 

The need is now much greater than before, as there is eudugli material in tlie way 
of vaUiable specimens of economical interest to till a second building the size of the 
])resent one. This unexhibited surplus is now stored in several buildings, some in 
Washington and some elsewhere, and consists of important illustrations of the econom- 
ical geology, metallurgy, and other resources of the United States. In addition to 
what has been on hand for some time, very large collections were presented to tlic 
Government at the New Orleans exhibition, which embraced a great deal of intrinsic 
value as well as of popular and scientific interest. It is earnestly to be hoped that 
this requirement will be met by Congress by the speedy appropriation of an amount 
suitable for the jmrpose. 

In 1886 Secretary Baird stated that as special provision was desired 
for laboratories and offices, and to give suital)l(^ (piarters to the U. S. 
Geological Sui'vey and the Bureau of Ethnology, an estimate had been 
made of the sum of $25O,t)O0 for the purpose of constructing one wing 
and pavilion of the new building, leaving the remainder to be con- 
structed hereafter, should Congress so approve it, at a cost of, per- 
haps, an additional $250,000. This estimate, submitted in 1886 for 
the sundry civil bill for 1888, varied but slightly in wording from the 
estimate of 1883. It received no consideration by Congress and was 
as follows: 

For commencing the construction, in a lireproof manner, of an additional museum 
building to receive tlie collections and laboratories in ciiemistry, geology, mineralogy, 
metallurgy, taxidermy, etc., and for othces and laboratories of theU. S. Geological 
Survey, to be erected under the direction and sui)ervision of the Regents of the 
Smithsonian Institution on the southwest section of the grounds of the Smithsonian 
Institution, $250,000. 

The following extract is from the Museum report of the same year, 
by Doctor Goode: 

The National Museum is now approaching an important crisis in its history. Its 
future will depend ui)on the action of Congress in granting it an additional building, 
for without more room its growth can not but be in large tlegree arrested. From 
this time forward it will he impossible to develop the collections satisfactorily witli- 
out additional space. The laboratories and worksho])S are already entirely inade- 
quate for the storage of the unexhibited collectionR and the acconnnodation of the 
])reparators and mechanics, and the exhibition halls do not afford suitable ojipor- 
tunity for the display of the materials already in order for public examination. 

At the annual meeting of the Board of Regents on January 11, 1888, 
the first Ixdd after the appointment of the present Secretarj^ of the 
Smithsonian Institution, Mr. Langley brought to the attention of the 
Regents the necessity of continuing the efforts toward securing an 
additional nuiseum building, and spoke of the legislation previously 
proposed. The Board renewed its reconuncnidation to Congress of 
January 17, 1883, and discussed the matter of pi'oviding quarters for 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 269 

the Geolotjficiil Survey in tlic now hiiildino-, pursuant to the wording 
of House bill No. 5781, presented to CoHj,a-ess in ISSI, and of the 
several estimates subsequently submitted. The chancellor stated as 
his opinion — 

That it was desirable tliat new luuseuin buildings should l)e erected in any ease, 
l)ut that since by act of Congress a certain part of the public ijrounds had l)een set 
apart and appropriated absolutely and exclusively to the Smithsonian Institution, 
lie for one did not want to see anything else placed on these grounds. 

He further said: 

If the Sniithsouiau Institution is to grow, it will need them all, and whatever is put 
upon them should be under our exclusive cfmtrol. 

The following extract from the report of Secretary Langley for 
1888 has reference to this subject: 

Among other matters discussed at the last meeting of the Regents was the erection 
of a new INIusemn building. On this occasion the Regimts tacitly reafhrmed their 
resolution of 188:^, recommending to Congress the enlargement of the National 
Museum by the erection of a fireproof building on the southwest corner of the 
Smithsonian reservation, similar in style to the present National Museum; but on 
viewing the sketch plans, which had been prepared subsequently to the resolution, 
so as to include offices for the Geological Survey, they added an expression of their 
opinion that the new building should be planned exclusively for Museum purposes. 

It was not at first intended to take action in this matter during the present year, 
but the overcrowded condition of the Iniilding, on account of which not only the 
current work but the proper development of the collections is greatly impeded, 
seemed to render innnediate action necessary. A still more urgent need appeared to 
be the unsatisfactory sanitary condition of the new ^Museum building. A commit- 
tee, consisting of Dr. J. H. Kidder, chairman. Dr. James M. Flint, U. 8. Navy, and 
Mr. J. E. Watkins, was appointed on April 14, to make a careful study of the water 
supply, ventilation, and drainage, and in May submitted a preliminary report, from 
which it appeared that an alarming amount of sickness and mortality has been mani- 
fest among the employes since 1881 — a mortality which can not be attributed to the 
location of the building, which has sometimes been pronounced unsanitary, since 
there has been no corresponding percentage of ill health in the old Smithsonian 
building adjoining. The number of days lost bj- employees on account of sickness in 
1886 was 796; in 1887, 875; and in 1888, up to May 10, 2\3, by far the largest part of 
this loss of time being attributed on the books of the ^Museum to miasmatic diseases. 
The committee states that there is no reasonable doubt that some, if not all, of the 
ten deaths since 1881 were hastened or induced by the unwholesome condition of this 
building. The committee suggested repairs and modifications of considerable extent, 
including the construction of continuous cellars under each of the four sides of the 
building, which, in addition to the other necessary expenses, would cost in the neigh- 
borhood of $40,000. This state of affairs seemed to demand decided action, and it 
being absolutely impossible to make any changes in the present building without 
entirely vacating a portion of it for a considerable period of time, the exigency for 
more accommodation seemed a great deal more urgent than had been at first 
supposed. 

While it became evident, on study of the question, that for the ultimate needs of 
the Museum, a building of but one story, occupying the same area as the present 
Museum, would be insufficient, the question of immediate action was unexpectedly 
brought up in May by one of the senior Regents, a member of the Senate, who, when 



270 KKPORT OF NATIONAL MUSETTTVI, 1903. 

Yisilinji tlie INlusenin with some frieiuls, noticed its crowded and unsatisfactory con- 
dition. Havinj;; learned from me of the mortality and sickness of the employees, he 
in((nin>d as to tlu^ feasibility of erecting a new building, and offered to use his influ- 
ence to procure an api)ropriation, if I could obtain for him a set of sketch plans 
within a week, time being, as lie stated, a very essential condition. After consulting 
with the chairman of your executive committee, I had no liesitation in accepting 
such an offer, but a diliicnlty arose from tlie fact that the sketch plans which had 
been laid before the Regents in 1882 were in part for purposes which the Regents had 
at their last meeting disapproved, and that hence they could not be used. By great 
diligence, however, plans for a building to be devoted exclusively to Museum pur- 
poses were prepared within the time mentioned. These w^ere l:)ased upon an exten- 
sive accunuilation of notes and drawings, eml)odying the record of the best recent 
work of museum construction in this country and in Europe, and they were for a 
building, as far as was consistent with these improvements, like the existing Museum. 
The report submitted by Senator Morrill, to accompany Senate bill 3i;^)4, .contains 
the correspondence on wluch action was taken, and I have discussed the acts therein 
presented elsewhere under the proper heads. 

The following bill was introduced by Senator Morrill on June 12, was passed by 
the Senate on June 20, and at the end of the fiscal year was in the hands of the 
House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds: 

"A BILL for the erection of an a(l<iili()Uiil fireproof l)uiklinj,' for the >ise of the National Museum. 

"JSe it enacted by the Senate and Houseof Reprcxenlatlrcs of the VnUed Staler of America 
in Congress assembled, That the sum of five hundred thousand dollars is hereby 
appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise approjiriated, or so 
much thereof as may be necessary, for the erection of a fireproof building for the use 
of the National Museum, to cover three hundred feet square, and to consist of two 
stories and basement, to be erected under the direction of the Regents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, in accordance with the plans now on file with the Committee on 
Pul)lic Buildings and Grounds of the Senate, on the southwestern portion of the 
grotmds of the Smithsonian Institution. vSaid building to l)e placed west of the 
Smithsonian Institution, leaving a roadway between it and the latter of not less 
than forty feet, with the north front on a line with the south face of the building of 
the Agricultural Department and of the Smithsonian Institution; and all expendi- 
tures for the purpose herein mentioned shall be audited by the proper officers of the 
Treasury Department. ' ' 

The building, as proposed, covers the same area as the present Museum, and is of 
the same general style, so far as is consistent with the introduction of a second story, 
thus affording nearly three times as much accommodation under the same area of 
roof as the building now in use. The arrangement of the interior of the proposed 
new structure is, however, consideral)ly modified, as the result of the experience of 
seven years' occupation of the present building. The eighteen exlubitiou halls on 
the two main floors are completely isolated from each other, "and are capable of sub- 
division into smaller halls. The lighting will be equally as good as in the present 
building, the ventilation will be much better, and in other important respects the 
sanitary arrangements will be far more satisfactory. 

A l)asement story is absolutely necessary, not only with a view to jiromoting the 
(;omfort and health of visitors and employees, as well as for securing greater dryness 
and better preservation of the specimens, but also for the purpose of providing large 
apartments for storerooms and workshops. These proposed improvements in 
arrangement will not, however, interfere with the possibility of constructing a build- 
ing which shall conft>rm in the essential jjoints of exterior proportion with the main 
features of the present building. 



NATIONAL MUSETTM BUTLDINGS. 271 

The present l)uil(liri^ contains about S(),()00 S(|nare feet of floor space available for 
exhi})ition and storage. Tlie buildinj^ proposed will contain about 220,000 srpiare 
feet. The anioinit of room for offices and laboratories would be about the same in 
each. The net area in tlie new building available for exhibition, storage, and office 
rooms, as estimated, would be between five and six acres. 

For the construction of the present Museum building an appro[)riati()n of $250,000 
was made. This sum was supplemented by the following special appropriations: 
$25,000 for steam-heating apparatus, $2(1,000 for marl)le floors, $12,500 for water and 
gas fixtures and electrical apparatus, and $1,900 for sjiecial sewer connections. The 
total amount expended on this l)uilding was therefore $315,400, and it is generally 
admitted that tlie cost of its construction was considerably less than that of any 
other similar l)uilding in existence; in fact, jierhaps too cheap to secure the ^uest 
economy. 

The proposed structuri' can be erected at a proportionately smaller cost. I have 
obtained from responsible l)idders, who are willing to give bonds for the completion 
of the work in acconlance with the bids whit'h they have submitted, estimates for 
the erection of the l>uilding complete, with steam-heating apjiaratus and all other 
essential appliances, excepting the electrical equipment, amounting in the aggregate 
to $473,000. These bids, upon which the estimates of cost have been made, were 
not competitive, and it is possible that something may be saved through competi- 
tion. It is, however, necessary to provide also for the architect's superintendence, 
and for the removal and reconstruction of the Smithsonian stable, which now occu- 
pies the site. I therefore think it advisable to make request for the smn of $500,000, 
in onler that these additional items and other contingencies may he covered. 

The ]ilans, thoiigh drawn in the limited time imposed, represent the results of an 
exhaustive study — which has extended over several years — of plans of the best 
modern museum buildings in Europe and America, nearly all of which have been 
personally inspected l)y officers of the Bmithsonian Institution. 

Senate bill No. 813-1:, above ((noted, when presented to the Senate 
on June 12, 1888, was aet'onn)anied b}' a favorable report from the 
Senate Committee on Public Building's and Grounds (No. 1539), and 
contained two letters from Secretary Ijangley, dated June 2 and 8, 
1888. The former referred mainly to the plans for the proposed 
])uilding, the latter to the collections and needs of the Museum. On 
June 21. an effort was made to have this bill attached to the sundry 
civil bill, an amendment to that effect being proposed b}^ Senator 
Morrill, but no progress was gained l)y this action, and the bill went 
over to th(^ next session. 

On January 17, 188t), Senator ]\lorrill again su])mitted the measure 
as an amendment to the sundry civil l)ill for 1890, and it was referred 
to the Connnittee on Appropriations, ))ut no action was taken. In his 
report for the same year Secretary Langley shows the increased 
necessity for additional spac(\ in that Congress at its previous session 
had graided the Armory building to the Fish (^onnnission as its head- 
(|uarters, re([uiring the Museum to remove therefrom all but a few of 
its preparator's workrooms. 

On December 10, 1S88, and December 19, 1889, bills were intro- 
duced in both houses of Congress for the erection of a fireproof 
building for the U. S. Geological Survey independently of the National

Musoitin, on the .south .side of the Mall between tlie Museum buildinf,^ 
and that of the Army Medical Museum, the amount requested for the 
pur})ose varvin*;" in the several ]:»ills and amendments thereto from 
1300,000 to $S()0,0<»0. Both of these measures failed to pass. The 
report of the House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, 
su))mitted February K), 1889, contains a letter from the Director of 
the Survey, from which the following extracts, interesting in this 
connection, are taken: 

111 addition to the rooms in the rented [Hooe] building, through the courtesy of 
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution the Survey is permitted to use twenty- 
two rooms in the National Museum, and these are all crow(le<l in such manner that 
work is seriously ol>structed. The rooms in the National Museum were temporarily 
given to the Survey at a time when there was no pressing necessity for their use by 
the officers of the Museum; but at the present time the entire Museum is so crowded 
that the Secretary of the Smithsonian and the Director of the Museum are anxious 
to have these rooms surrendered for their use. * * * 

The building planned does not provide for museum space. The statutes now pro- 
vide that the collections of the Geological Survey, when no longer needed for 
investigations in progress, shall be deposited in the National Museum. The plan 
contemplated in the bill before your committee provides that the building for the 
Geological Survey shall be near to the National Museum— between that building and 
the Army Medical Museum building. Such an arrangement of buildings will be 
highly advantageous to the Survey, as the offices of the Survey Avould be adjacent 
to the National Museum, and the materials stored in the Museum building would be 
accessible for reference and comparison, as constantly needed. 

In his annual report for 1890, Assistant Secretar}^ George Brown 
Goode, in charge of the Museum, made the following statements 
regarding the necessity for a new building: 

The necessity for additional room is constantly increasing, and several of the c(j1- 
lections, to wit, transportation and engineering, fishes, reptiles, birds' eggs, mol- 
lusks, insects, marine invertebrates, vertebrate and invertebrate fossils, fossil and 
recent plants, are in some instances wholly unprovided for, and in others only in a 
very inadecjuate degree. 

In the main hall of the Smithsonian building is still exhibited the collection of 
birds. A few cases containing birds' eggs and shells have recently l)een arranged 
along the center of this hall. 

Eleven of the departments in the National Museum have no space assigned to 
them in the Museum building, solely on account of its crowded condition. The col- 
lection of prehistoric antliropological objects remains installed on the second floor 
of the Smithsonian building. The collections of the remaining ten departments 
can not be exhibited or even properly arranged and classified without more room. 
These collections are at present stored in the attics and basements of the Smithso- 
nian and Armory buildings, and are inaccessible for study and for the other purposes 
for which they were obtained. The specimens comprising these collections are not 
simply objects of natural history, possessing an abstract interest to the student, but 
represent the application of natural objects to the industries, and, as such, are of 
great importance. There are several collections of ores, minerals, building stones, 
and of objects representing various arts and industries, which are of very great value, 
since they furnish to the American manufacturer and designer information of inesti- 
mable importance. 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 273 

The increase in the national t-ollections (hiring the last eight years may perliapg 
be best described V)y tlie statement that in 1882 the total number of specimens 
recorded in the Museinn was about 183,000; while in 1890 the records indicated the 
possession of nearly 3,000,000 specimens. Tt is ])roper to say in this connection that 
the actual increase was not so great as shown by the records, sinc(^ during this period 
a large amount of material previously received had l)een brought luider control and 
placed on the I>ooks of the Museum. It should also be l)orne in mind that the pres- 
ent Museum building was planned with reference to the reception of the material in 
its custody at the time of its construction. 

During- the Fifty-first Cong-ress the question of a new building was 
frequently under discussion, but without result. On February 19, 
1890, Senator Morrill, from the Committee on Public Buildings and 
Grounds, reported Senate bill No. 2740, which provided: 

That for an additional fireproof building for the use of the National Museum, 300 
feet square, with two stories and a basement, to be erected under the direction of 
the Architect of the Capitol, with the approval of the Regents of the Smithsonian 
Institution, in accordance with plans now on file with the Committee on Puldic 
Buildings and Grounds, on the southwestern portion of the grounds of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, there shall be appropriated, out of any moneys in the Treasury 
not otherwise ai>proiiriated, the sum of '$500,000; said building to be placed west of 
the Smithsonian Institution, leaving a roadway between it and the latter of not less 
than 50 feet, with its north front on a line with the south face of the Agricultural 
Department and of the Smithsonian Institution, and constructed as far as practicable, 
after proper advertisement, by contract or contracts awarded to the lowest responsi- 
ble bidder, and all expenditures for the purposes herein mentioned shall be audited 
l)y the proper officers of the Treasury Department. 

On April, 9, 1890, the same bill was submitted to the House and 
referred to the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. These 
bills were again brought up in the second session of the same Congress, 
in the House on January 9, 1891 (where it was committed to the Com- 
mittee of the Whole), and in the Senate on February 9, 1891, as an 
amendment to the sundry civil bill for 1892. The House bill, differ- 
ing somewhat in wording from the Senate bill, was as follows: 

That for an additional fireproof building for the use of the National Museum, 300 
feet square, with two stories and a basement, to be erected by the Supervising Archi- 
tect of the Treasury, under the direction of the Regents of the Smitiisonian Institu- 
tion, in general accordance with plans now on file with the Counnittee on Public 
Buildings and Grounds, on the southwestern portion of the grounds of the Smithso- 
nian Institution, there shall be appropriated, out of any moneys in the Treasury not 
otherwise appropriated, the sum of $500,000; said l)uilding to ])e i)laced west of the 
Smithsonian Institution, with its north front on a line with the north front of the 
present Museum building, and constructed as far as practicable, after proper adver- 
tisement, by contract or contracts awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, and all 
expenditures for the purposes herein mentioned shall be audited by the proper 
oflacers of the Treasur\' Department. 

Letters in support of the measure were transmitted to Congress b}' 
Secretar}^ Langley, and some arguments were presented on the floor.

274 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

The report to the Senate Committee on Public Buildinu.s and (iround- 
b3^ Secretary Langley, dated January 21, 1890, was mainly as follows: 

I send you herewith ii set of sketch plans intended to show, in a general way, the 
extent and chararter of u Ixiilding such as would seem to be necessary for the aticoni- 
inodation of the Museum collections in the present and immediate future, and respect- 
fully reijuest for them your attention and a recommendation to Congress of the 
necessary means for such a building. 

These plans and sketclu-sare provisional, hut although not presented in detail they 
represent the results of studies, extending over many years, of the i)lans of the best 
modern museum buildings in Europe and America, nearly all of wliich have been 
inspected by officers of the Smithsonian Institution. 

The proposed building covers the same area as that finished in 1881. It is intended 
to consist of two stories and a basement, except in the central portion, which consists 
of one lofty hall open from the main floor to the roof, the height of which will be 
!)0 feet, galleries l)eing placed on the level of the second floor in other parts of the 
building. Its interior arrangements are, as you will see, different from those in the 
actual Museum, all the changes having been ])laimed in the light of the experience 
of nine years' occupation of the present building. It will afford between two and 
three times as much available si)ace for exhibition and storage under the same area 
of roof. The fifteen exhibition halls are completely isolated from each other, and 
may readily be subdivided, when necessary, into smaller rooms. The light will be 
as good as in the old building, and the ventilation ])erhaps still better. The sanitary 
arrajigements have been carefully considered. 

The necessity for a basement is especially great. In this, place has been provided 
for many storage rooms and workshops. The existence of a basement will promote 
the comfort and health of visitors and employees, and by increasing the dryness of 
the air in the exhibition halls will se»'ure the better preservation of the collections. 
These proposed changes in the internal arrangements will not interfere with con- 
formity with the other points of the present Museum building in the essential 
features of exterior proi)ortion. The total capacity of this present building in avail- 
able floor space is about 100,000 scpiare feet; that of the new building somewhat 
exceeds 200,000. The present Museum building contains al)Out 80,000 feet of floor 
space available for exhibition. That proposed will i-ontaiu about 103,300 squai-e feet 
for exhil)ition. The space devoted to offices and laboratories would not be much 
more, but the area available for exhibition halls, storage rooms, and workshops far 
greater. The appropriation for the construction of the present building was $250,000. 

The estimates of cost on this building vary greatly with regard to details of con- 
struction on which I do not here enter further than to say that the whole should be 
absolutely fireproof throughout, and in view of the further great variation of the 
cost of building materials within the past two years, T am not prepared to state the 
sum which wouM be necessary for its completion. It is certain, however, that 
$500,000, if not sutticient to complete it, would 1)e all that would he required to l)e 
expended during the present year, and I would respectfidly rejiresent the desirability 
of an appropriation of this amount for the purpose in question. 

Your attentif)n is directed to certain facts in regard to the character of the mate- 
rials for the accommodation of which this building is desired. The collections of 
the Smithsonian Institution and of the Government are especially rich in collections 
of natural history, which may be grouped in three general classes: The zoological 
collections, the botanical collections, and the geological collections, including not 
only all the geological and mineralogical material, but the greater portion of that 
belonging to i)aleontology, the study of fossil animals and plants forming an essential 
part of modern geological work. 



NATIONAL MfTSEtTM BUILDTNOR. 275 

Besides the iiatiinil history coUections, tliere are eijually iniportaiit anthropological 
eolleetioiis whieli ilhistrate tlie liistory of niankind at all periods and in every land, 
and which serve to explain tiie development of all hinnaii arts and industries. In 
everything that relates to the j>riinitive inhabitants of North America, Eskimo as 
well as Indian, these collections are by far the richest in the w'orld, an<l with the 
necessary amount of exhil)ition space the material on hand will be arranged in a 
manner wdiich will produce the most impressive and magnificent effect, the educa- 
tional importance of which can not be overestimated. Again there are collections 
of considerable extent wliich illustrate the processes and products of the various arts 
and industries, as wi-U as what are termed the historical collections, which are of 
especial interest to a very large number of the visitors to the ]\Iuseum on account of 
the associations of the o])jects exhi))ited with the personal liistory of representative 
men or with important events in the history of America. 

The collections illustrating the arts and the art industries are relatively small, and 
although in themselves of great interest and value, not to be compared in importance 
with those in natural history and ethnology. 

In a letter addressed on June 7, 1888, to the Hon. Justin S. Morrill, ami which 
will be found in a report of June 12 of the same year from the Senate C'onnnittee on 
Public Buildings and (irounds, I maile a statement of the rapidity of the recent growtli 
of the Museum, mentioning that in tlie five years from 1882 to 1887 the number of speci- 
mens in the collection have multiplied no less than sixteen times, and endeavored 
to give an idea, though perhaps an inadequate one, of the extent to which the 
pressure for want of space was felt. The evil has grown rapidly worse, and, as I 
have had occasion to mention, it has been felt in the last year in a partial arrest of 
the growth of the collections, which emphasizes the demand for more room. The 
present Museum building is not large enough even for the natural history collections 
alone, a number of which are without any exhibition space whatever. The proposed 
building will afford accommodations for the ethnological and technological material 
already on hand and for a large part of the natural history material also. The collec- 
tions are still increasing, and the number of specimens, as estimated, is now not far 
from 3,000,000. 

Unless more space is soon provided the development of the (Government collec- 
tions will of necessity be almost completely arrested. 

So long as there was room for storage, collections not immediately rerpiired «(iuld 
be received and packed away for future use. This can not longer be done. 

The Armory building, since 1877 assigned to the IMuseum for storage and work- 
shops, is now entirely occupied by the U. S. Fish Commission, with the exception 
of four rooms, and by some of the Museum taxidermists, who are now working in 
Very contracted space, and wliom it is impossible to acconiinodatt> elsewhere. 

Increased space in the exhi))ition halls is needed, the educational value of the col- 
lections being seriously diminished by the present crowded system of installation. 
Still more necessary, however, is room for storage, for rearranging the great reserve 
collections, for eliminating duplicate material for distribution to college and school 
museums, and for the use of the taxidermists and preparators engaged in preparing 
objects for exhibition. Space is also required for the j)roper handling of the costly 
outfit of tlie museum cases and appliances for installation, of which there is always a 
considerable amount temporarily out of use or in jirocess of construction. 

In summarizing what has just been said, it may be stated in general terms that the 
amount of space already retpiired for exhil)ition })urposes alone, being 207,500 feet 
as against 100,675 now occupied, and this being exclusive of the 108,000 square feet 
needed for other objects, the acicumulations have now reached such a point of con- 
gestion tliat the actual space needs to be doubled, even indt'iiendently of future

increase; and I ))og to ivpoat that, unless more apace is provideil, the development 
of the Government collection, which is already partly arrested, will he almost com- 
|)letely stopped. 

The bill was passed by the Senate as a separate iiieusurc on April 5, 
1890, and as an amendment to the sundry civil bill for 1891 on July 
19. In the House no action was secured, tliouo-h the bill was favor- 
ably reported by the Committee on Public Building-s and Grounds. 

The question of placing a basement story under the existing- Museum 
building, which had been under consideration at this time and was 
referred to the Architect of the Cajiitol, was reported upon to the 
House, under date of March 3, 1890, as follows: 

Architect's Office, United States Capitol, 

WashirKjton, D. C, February ^8, 1890. 

Sir: In compliance with the requirements of the act providing for the sundry civil 
expenses of the Government, approved March 2, 1889, 1 have examined the National 
Museum, and have estimated the cost of constructing the basement story under that 
building. 

It is thought that the only portion of the basement available for workshops and 
suitable for storage would be a cellar running around the outer walls of the build- 
ing and extending inwards 30 feet, so that the rooms thus obtained may have light 
and air. 

These rooms should be roofed with brick arches supported by iron beams. Pro- 
vision is made in the accomi>anying estimate to floor with tiles the entire rooms 
under which these basements come, in part, as the present wooden floors of these 
rooms are now in bad condition and will soon be unfit for use.

I will say that by reason of the sewer, -steam, and gas pipes running undei- the 
present floors the work of constructing these basement rooms, though practicable, 
will l)e extremely difiicult. 

I beg to say that I am of the opinion that a site for a storehouse and for work- 
shops required may be purchased in the neighborhood of the Museum and a fire- 
proof building erected thereon with a capacity as great as these proposed basement 
rooms for a sum less than will be necessary to construct this basement. 

Very respectfully,

NATIONAL MUSETTM BUILDINGS. 277 

On January 28, 1891, in view of the possibility of the passage h} 
Conjj-ress of a bill for a new building-, the Regents — 

Resolved, That the executive comuiittee of the Board of Regents, or a uiajorit>- 
thereof, and the Secretary be, and they are hereby, authorized and empowered to 
act for and in the name of the Board of Regents in carrying into effect the provisicms 
of any act of Congress that may l)e passetl providing foi' the erection of a new build- 
ing for the United States National Museum. 

In the Fifty-second Congress a bill identical with that su))mitted at 
the beginning of the previous Congress passed the Senate on April 11, 
1892, but in the House it went no further than the Committee on 
Public Buildings and Grounds. In the Fift3'-third Congress the same 
measure was again introduced, but failed of action. 

In all the reports of the Secretar}^ from 1892 down, attention was 
called to this ever-pressing subject. The exhibition space in l)oth 
buildings was overfilled. Small specimens could be crowded in here 
and thei"e, but extensive changes meant that old collections must be 
sent to storage for the benefit of something more important or of a 
better class of preparations. Extra stoi-erooms and workrooms were 
imperative, but they could only be provided by renting outside quar- 
ters, with the full understanding that such structures were unsafe, and 
that collections to the value of hundreds of thousands of dollars might 
any day be destroyed through the merest accident. Year after 3^ear 
the extent and value of the material thus unsafely housed has been 
rapidly increasing, and the conditions prevailing have also influenced 
disadvantageously many owners of \ aluable and rare specimens, the 
donation or loan of which could easil}^ have been effected were there a 
safe phice for their installation. It is known that the Museum has 
been deprived of many large and important accessions from this cause 
alone. 

These circumstances have been explained time and again, but while 
the ai'guments presented have excited much interest and have secured 
the influence of strong and devoted friends, they have never, until 
within the past two years, obtained the recognition they merit. 

The building of galleries in the Museum building, begun in 1897, 
has afforded slight relief, but the total extent of these additions has 
increased Init little the former area of the two ])uildings, and in no 
wa}^ lessened the need of a new one. 

In the Fifty-fourth ('ongress Senator Morrill made his tinal effort 
toward securing the appropriation so much desired by introducing in 
the Senate, on December 10, 189,5, bill No. 698, which differed but 
slightly in wording from former measures, except that tiie cost was 
reduced fi-om $r)00,0(lO to $2.5( ),()()(). It was as follows: 

Thatfor an additicmal fire{)n)(il' Idiilding for the use of the National Museum, 300

Arcliitect of the Capitol, witli tlu^ approval of the Regents of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, in liarmonj' with the present National jVIuseum l)nil(linjr, on the sonthwestern 
portion of the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution, there shall l)e appropriated, 
out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise ai)i>ropriated, the sum of $250,000; 
said l)uil(lin<r to be ])hu'ed west of the Smithsonian Institution, leaving a roadway 
])etween it and tho latter of not less than 50 feet, with its north front on a line 
with the south face of the Agricultural Department and of the Smithsonian Institu-

or contracts approved by the Secretary of the Treasury and awarded to the lowest 
responsible bidder; and all expenditures for the purpose herein mentioned shall be 
audited by the pro])er oflicers of the Treasury Department. 

This ])ill was referi-ed to the Committee on Public Building-s and 
Grounds, l)ut on Fcbfuaiy 27 followino- Sonatoi* Morrill reported an 
amendment, which consisted in substitutino- for the "Architect of the 
Capitol " the name of Bernard R. Green to have direction of the con- 
struction. It was submitted l)y the conunittee on March 23, 18!)6, 
with a report (No. 540), consistinj>- of material supplied b\' Secretar}" 
Langle}^ and Assistant Secretary Goode. The following, by Mr. 
Langley, is extracted from his report for 1895: 

In my last annual statement I i)ointed out three conditions which are operating to 
seriously retard the growth of the National Museum: First, the lack (jf s])ace for the 
installation of ol)jects which should be placed on exhibition; second, the unsyni- 
metrical growth of the collection; and, third, tlie fact that the storage of collections 
in the wooden sheds south of tlie Smithsonian buililing, as well as in the basement 
of the building itself, is most undesirable and dangerous. Tlie sum of |900, allowed 
for 1896, will be necessarily expended in the rental of shop and storage room in 
place of the "Armory building." The actually dangerous wooden sheds must there- 
fore remain occupied imtil a sum of money is provided which will enable me to 
discontinue their use altogether by renting other (juarters removed entirely from 
proximity to the Smithsonian building. 

The problem of even providing shelter of any kind for the vast amount of material 
daily received from persons interested in the growth and work of tlie Museum still 
remains inisolved. The Institution is place<l in an embarrassing ])osition. It has 
l)een designated by law as the only depository of colU'ctions offered to or made 
under the auspices of the Government, and can not, under tlie law, refuse to receive 
them. The fact remains, however, that when act-epted there is no suitable i)lace in 
which to store them, and no space in the Museum building to exhibit such of the 
objects as should properly be shown to the public. As I havi' already pointed out, 
there is probaljly no nuiseum in the world in which so small a proportion of the 
objects worthy of exhibition is visible to the public, or in whi(!h the ol)jects exhibited 
are crowded together so closely. It is now more true than ever that if another 
museum buililing as large as the jiresent one were provideil it couM be at once tilled 
with specimens already on hand. 

Following are some of the more important parts of Mr. Goode's 
statement: 

The Smithsonian Institution is the custodian of the National Museum, which is 
the only lawful i)lace of dejtosit of "all objects of art and of foreign and curious 
research, and all objects of natural history, plants, and geologitud and mineralogical 
specimens belonging to the United States." The imcleus of the collections con- 
sists of the specimens brought home by the Wilkes and other exploring expedi- 



NATIONAL MTTSEUM BrTTLDINOS. 279 

tions, but for many years the Museum was supported entirely at tlie expense of the 
Smithsonian fund, and a considerable portion of the c:olle(!tions is the property of the 
Institution. 

Professor Huxley defines a nmseum as "a consultative library of objects." The 
National iNIuseum is such a consultative hbrary, and it is a great deal more. It is an 
agency for the instruction of the people of the whole country, and it keeps in mind 
the needs of persons whose lives are not occupied in the study of science, as well as 
those of the professional investigator and teacher. 

Its benefits are extended without cost or reserve fo hundreds of thousands of 
visitors from all parts of the I'nited States who pass through its doors each year. 

It is also accessory to jiublic education through the distribution of the duplicate 
specimens in the Museum, which are made up into sets, accurately named, and 
given to public institutions in all parts of the country. 

The history of the Museum is divided into three i)eriods: First, that from the 
foundation of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, during which time specimens 
were collected purely and solely to serve as materials for research, no special effort 
having been made to publicly exhibit them or to utilize them except as a foundation 
for scientific description and theory. Second, the period from LS57, when the Insti- 
tution assumed the cu.stody of the "National Cal)inet of Curiosities," to LS76. Dur- 
ing this peri(xl the Museum became a place of deposit for scientific, material which 
had already been studied, this material, so far as practicable, being exhibited to the 
public, and thus made to serve an educational purpose. Third, the present period, 
beginning in the year 1876, during which the Museum has entered upon a career of 
active work in gathering collections and exhibiting them on account of their edi;ca- 
tional value. 

During the first i)eriod the main object of the Museum was scientific research; in 
the second the establishment became a museum of record as well as of research; 
while in tiie third period there is growing up also the idea of public education. 

The three ideas, record, research, and education, cooi)erative and mutually helpful 
as they are, are essential to the development of every great nmseum. The National 
Museum endeavors to promote them all. 

It is a museum of record, in which are preserved the material fjundations of an 
enormous amount of scientific knowledge, the types of numerous ])ast investigations. 
This is especially the case with tliose materials that have served as a foundation for 
the reports upon the resources of the United States. 

It is a nmseum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in the highest 
degree as a stimulus to iiKjuiry and a foundation for scientific investigation. Research 
is necessary in order to identify and group the objects in the most philosophical and 
instructive relations, and its oHicers are therefore selecte<l for thcii- al)ility as investi- 
gators as well as their trustworthiness as custodians. 

It is an educational nmseum, through its policy of illustrating by specimens every 
kind i)i natural object and every manifestation of human thought and activity, of 
displaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and of distributing its 
puI)lications and its named series of duplicates. 

The collections are installed in part in the Smithsonian building and in part in 
the large Ijuilding adjacent, covering 2", acres of ground, which was erected in 1881 
to afford temporary ai'conmiodations for the overflow until such time as an adequate 
new building could be constructed. 

The intrinsic value of such collections as these can not well be expressed in figures. 
There are single specimens worth hundreds, others worth thousands, of dollars, and 
still others which are unique and priceless. Many series of specimens which owe 
their value to their completeness and to the labor which has been expended on them 
can not be rei>la(ed at any i)rice. The collections at a forced sale would realize 



280 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, ]903. 

more than has been expended on them, and a fair appraisal of their \ahie wonld 
amount to several millions of dollars. 

In the direct purchase of specimens but little money has l^een sjjent, less, perhaps, 
in fifty years than either France, England, (Jermany, or Austria ex])ends in a single 
year on similar ol)jects. The entire Museum is the outgrowth of ( Jovernment expe- 
ditions and expositions, and of the gifts prompted by the generosity of the vVmerican 
people. 

If there were more sjtace it would be possible to devote a special hail to the col- 
lections illustrating the life of the races of the Far North — the P^skimos and their kin. 
A large hall might be tilled with the wonderful groups of models of the races of ma'n- 
kind, and particularly of the different tribes of the North American Indians, clothed 
in their characteristic costumes and engaged in the arts and occupations i)eculiar to 
each. These groups are recognized in Europe as having no equal, and are now tem- 
porarily placed in the lecture room and in various out-of-the-way corners where 
their effect and usefulness are largely lost. No other museum in the world has such 
rich material in this field, but at present only a small number of exhibition cases can 
be devoted to them and the remainder of the material is stowed a^way in drawers 
and packing boxes. 

The magnificent mounted groups of the larger animals of America, unsurpassed by 
anything of the kind in the world, are now so crowded together in the midst of other 
collections that they are scarcely visible, and some of them are packed away. The 
great fossil vertebrate animals of North America, of which there is a magnificent 
series. A considerable j^ortion of this collection is now stored in the basement of the 
museum at Yale College for lack of room to receive it here, although it is much 
needed by the geologists of the Geological Survey for purposes of study. 

Another hall is needed which might well be devoted to economic geology, illus- 
trating the wonderful material wealth of our country and its utilization; and still 
another is needed to illustrate the material resources of the country, classified by 
States. With the present accommodations the materials and ores of each State are 
confined to one or two small cases. A hall of proper extent, arranged upon this 
geographical plan, would he one of the most impressive display's of the kind to be 
seen anywhere in the world. 

The building devoted especially to the Museum was erected after the Centennial 
Exhibition in Philadelphia as a temporary accommodation for the collections given 
to the United States by the foreign governments and private exhibitors represented 
on that occasion. It is the cheapest public building of a permanent character ever 
erected, having cost only $2.25 a square foot of floor space available for exhibition. 
The museum buildings in Central Park, New York, have cost from $80 to $40 a 
square foot. 

The building in Washington has served a good purpose, but is deficient in one of 
the most important particulars; it has no cellars whatever, and very little provision 
for workshops and laboratories. In consequence of this it has been necessary t(.) use 
all kinds of devices for storing material which can not be exhibited in the exhibition 
halls in the bases under the exhibition cases, in small recesses, so ingeniously con- 
trived that their presence is not suspected. It has been necessary to do this, but the 
result has been to still fm-ther increase the crowded condition. 

Another disagreeal)le result is that much noisy work has to be done in the Museum 
halls in sjtaces shut off from the public by screens, and that when preparations for 
exhibitions or unpacking are going on, not only are a portion of the collections 
closed to tlie public, l)ut there is a constant and unpleasant noise of hammers. 

A temporary relief was secured some years ago by placing the great herbarium, 
one of the most important collections of American plants in the world, in the cus- 
tody of the Agricultmal Department; but last year the Secretary of Agriculture 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDINGS. 281 

found liimself unal:)le to longer give these collections house room; and since the 
building in which they were kept is not fireproof, and the destruction of the collec- 
tion would be an incalculable loss to science, there was nothing to do but to receive 
this, and up to the present time a considerable portion of the collection still remains 
in danger of destruction by fire, at the Department of Agriculture. There is also a 
large amount of other material which ought to be arranged for public exhibition in 
a lirei)roof building which is now in the inflammable wooden structure adjoining the 
Dt'partnient of Agriculture, and which the Secretary is desirous of transferring, if 
accommodation can be found for it. 

All the collections of the (ieological Survey are stored in this building, and a con- 
siderable number of the scientific experts employed by the Survey have office room 
and accommodations to enable them to study in tlie Museum building. These 
accommodations have become absolutely inadequate, and there is no more room to 
receive the collections which the Director of the Survey deems absolutely necessary 
to have here in AVashington in connection with his investigations of the material 
wealth of the country. 

The crowded condition of theexhibiticm halls has been dwelt upon, but that of the 
storage rooms is still more congested. In the basement of the old Smithsonian 
building, in its towers, and in various small rooms about the new building, there is 
a space equivalent to perhaps 200,000 cubic feet, crowded to its utmost capacity with 
boxed material. This material is all carefully recorded, and the location and con- , 
tents of every box is definitely fixed, so that wlien necessary any desired object can 
be referred to; but satisfactory use of the collections is impossible. In one basement 
room, for instance, ■ re crowded 50,000 skins of birds, and 50,000 in an adjacent gal- 
lery, altogether tw^elve times as many as are shown in the exhibition hall. So 
(tlosely are they crowded that it is impossible even to rearrange tliem, and their 
study is attended with great difficulty. It is desired to separate from among the.se 
the duplicates for distribution to the colleges and si-hools throughout the country, 
and an attempt has been made to accomplish this, but it has been found practically 
impossible. 

The great collection of alcoholic fishes (the result in part of the explorations of the 
Fish Commission), the most extensive in America, and one of the most extensive 
in the world, is stored in two basement rooms and only accessible with the greatest 
difficulty. Furthermore, the crowding of such a mass of alcoholic material in a 
small space is very dangerous, and in case of fire would lead to <lisastrous results. 
Properly equipped museums, like the British Museum in London, have a special 
firejjroof building for collections of this kind, separate from other buildings, and 
provided with special devices for the prevention of fire. 

In addition to the storage within the fireproof buildings there are a number of 
sheds whose capacity is roughly estimated at 170,000 laibic feet, which are packed 
with valuable material, and in which most of the workshops are placed. Two of 
these are immediately south of the Smithsonian building, another at the southeast 
corner of the Museum building, two others to the southwest of the old Armory build- 
ing, and another, temporarily hired, halfway between the Museum and the Capitol. 
Until 1888 two floors of the old Armory building were used for the storage of Museum 
material. It then became necessary to give up one floor to accommodate the increas- 
ing necessities of the Fish Commission, and in 1894 to give it up entirely to the Com- 
mission. At that time an appropriation was made to rent storage rooms in the city. 
Suitable storage rooms can not be rented; we have had to move twice and are now 
being forced to a third move. These moves are destructive and expensive. 

The two sheds adjoining the Armory building are getting old and some of the 
timbers are rotting away. They can not be repaired because there is no place to put 
the material they contain while the work is being done, and they are so crowded 
that temporary readjustments for this i)urpose are not possible. 



2S2 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

All of the wooden storage t^hedw are in eonstant danger from destruction by fire. 
This is a matter especially serious in connection with two long sheds near the Smith- 
sonian building. Tn his rei)ort ti) tlie Regents, i>resente<l to Congress in bS94, .Secre- 
tary Langley made an earnest apja'al for relief in the following words: 

"I have the assurance of experts that a tire conmmnicated to these rooms would 
sweep througii the entire length of the building, and although the building itself is 
fireproof as against any ordinary danger, it may well Ik- il(>ul)ted whether any of the 
collections therein exhibited can ))e regardeti as safe if the rooms immediately below 
should be exposed to so peculiarly severe a conflagration as would be caused by the 
ignition of these large quantities of inflammable material. Besides this, these wooden 
sheds, which (as I have already intimated) are used not only for storerooms, but for 
workshops, for the preservation of specimens, and also as sheds for. the carpenters, 
are likewise liable to cause serious losses should a fin* be kindled in any of them, 
and all of these, I repeat, are inunediately under the windows of the Smithscmian 
building. 

"In a report recently submitted by one of the inspectors of the Association of Fire 
Underwriters, in response to a request from me for a statement as to what insurance 
rates would be fixed upon the sheds in question, the Smithsonian building is referred 
to as an undesirable risk, owing solely to the presence of all this inflannnable mate- 
rial umlerneath and in the adjoining sheds, on which latter insurance can not be 
placed for less than |40 per $1,000. This is, I am informed, nearly ten times the 
rate which would l)e charged on an ordinary warehouse. The chief danger, how- 
ever, is not to the sheds themselves or their contents, but to the adjoining collec- 
tions, which, without reference to their scientific interest but merely to their intrinsic 
value, represent a very large sum of money." 

The result of all this crowding and lack of facility for work is that what is accom- 
plished for public education by the Museum requires unnecessary and unusual effort, 
and that the fullest results are not realized from the a])propriations which are made 
for this branch of the pul)lic service. 

Another result is that the value of the collections, the property of tlie nation, is 
not increasing as rapidly as it would otherwise do. The amount of valuable mate- 
rial presented and beciueathed to the Museum is not as great as it seemed likely to 
be a few years ago. Nothing which is offered is refused, but the authorities of the 
Museum do not feel at liberty to ask for gifts when they can not assure the givers 
that they can be suitably cared for; and persons having collections to give, being 
aware of the lack of room, naturally prefer to place their gifts in institutions where 
there is room to receive them. 

Notwithstanding these hindrances to the Museum's j)rogress, the increment from 
legitimate sources, especially from the various Departments of the (iovernment, 
which are required by law to deposit their aci-unndatiotis here, was during the year 
1895 about l:i7,000 specimens. In 1894 the accessions were more nmnerous, the 
total exceeding 171,000. This large increase was in part at least due to the fact that 
a large number of collections were acquired at the close of the World's Fair in 
Chicago. These were almost without exception collections which had been ])re- 
pared by foreign exhibitors with the Smithsonian Institution in mind as the ultimate 
place of deposit. 

It would have been possible to have ol)tain('d an immense nund)er of specimens 
on this occasion, but it was deemed i)roper to refrain from efforts in this direction, 
not only because of the cousideraticms just referred to hut also on aci-ount of the 
desire of the people of Chicago to retain such objects in tiieir own city as a begin- 
ning toward a great civic nuiseum whicdi might serve as a permanent memorial of 
the World's Columbian Expositicm. It has always been the policy of the Smith- 
sonian Institution to encourage the develojiment of such institutions throughout the 
United States, and to assist in developing them, and on this account many proffers

of specimens were deeliueil, with the recomineinlatioii tiiat they be offered to the 
Cliieago iiiuseuni, and, ho far as it was possible to do so, tlie attention of exhilntors 
who had collections to disj)ose of was directed toward that institution. 

A census of the number of specimens now contained in the various departments 
of the Museum shows that the total is alxjut IJ.riOCOOO, almost all of which have 
l)een acquired l)y tr'ft' i'l excluuiuje for other specimens, or as an e(jni\alent for 
|)ul)lications. 

On April 14, 18!M), Senator Mon-ill })ropo.sed his bill (Senate No. 
»it>8 as amended) as an aniendineiit to the sinidrv civil ])ill for 1897, 
and it was refei'ivd to the Connnittee on Appropriations. He spoke 
upon the measure in the Senate on April 1»>. prefacing his remarks as 
follows: 

Mr. President, when the Smithsonian Institution, designed for "the increase and 
diffusion of knowledge among men," was put into practical operation, it was discov- 
ered tliat a national museum would be a large contributor to the great purpose of 
the founder, and that the nation was destitute of such an institution. The Smith- 
sonian buililing accordingly early Ix-gan to l)e temporarily crowded with many gifts 
anil objects of rare value, and sul)sequently a separate building for a nuiseum was 
found to be indispensal)le. l*atronized as was this collateral enterprise of the Smith- 
sonian by the Government, through many of its Executive Dei)artments, and guided 
by the Smithsonian Institution in a scientific and educational direction, as well as in 
the practical diffusion of knowledge, it was sure to become an important but inex- 
pensive .institution of public education, with a constantly increasing collection of 
imjiortant materials worthy to be intrusted to the custody of a national museum, ' 
where they might be forever preserved and thus increase in value with every 
succeeding generation. 

His closing words were signiticant and prophetic: 

The additional ])uilding now earnestly sought will be equal to the preservation 
and exhibition of a \ery large amount oi accumulated material now unhap})ily 
stored away, and will also provide some space for future accumulations that should 
not longer he neglected. 

The agents of great museums abroad are reported to be regularly employed here, 
with authority to purchase any American curios and anticiuities, and in some direc- 
tions they are sujjposed to have already o])taine<l better specimens for exhibition 
than have been left for us to find. 

The New World, of which the United States forms so imjiortant a part, in its 
l)rairies and mountains, hills and forests, with their I'xtensive mini'rals, rocks and 
marldes, lakes and rivers, with the animals, game, liirds, and lish, the story of the 
lirehistoric race, the legends of tlie Indian tribes, as well as the notable modern 
lustory and life of the present inhabitants, all seem to have distinctive features of 
tiieir own Avhich belong almost exclusively to the western half of the globe dis- 
covered by Cohnubns. This vast and (-omparatively ungathered continental field, 
with its abounding American treasures, should be harvested by our National INIuseum 
and not surrendered to the more <liligent foreign explorers to adorn and enrich only 
European nuiseums. 

As long as it shall 1h' conducted by the Smithsonian Institution its broad non- 
partisan rei)utalion as a national museum of tlic bigliest charactei- will not b(> likely 
ever to be <lisi)uted or imi)eached. 

While this additional building, with its additional story and cellar, will more than 
double the capacity of the i)resent nuiseum, it is i)rol)able as the yeai-s go by that it 
will be necessary to keep step with the research, progress, and record of the .Ameri- 
can people, and as early as li»2t>. when our jioijulation will be not less than 1 40, (UK), 000, 



284 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

it may l)e expected that another and (grander building in the rear of the Smithsonian, 
facing (in south B street and ct)nnecting the two wings, will l)e required to mark and 
illustrate the age. 

Oil April '25, ISl^O, in tlio absence of Senator Morrill, Senator Georoe 
(irray, also a Smitlisonian Reoent, moved the amendment to the sundry 
(•i\ il hill, saying- in support of the measure that — 

The Senator from ^"ernlont is one of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution. 
I also liave the honor to be one of that body, and I know something in that w'ay of 
the necessities for the building provided for in this amendment. There is a large 
amount of exceedingly valuable scientific material which is housed there in temporary 
wooden sheds, exposed to the peril of conflagration, and which would entail if it were 
destroyed incalculable loss, not only upon the Government of the United States, but 
upon the scientific world. There are matters there now thus insecurely housed that 
could not be replaced. We all know what a credit the Smithsonian Institution is to 
the ccjuntry and to the science of the country. There is no department of tlie Gov- 
ernment tliat is bettei- conducted, more conscientiously administered in all of its 
branches, and from which there are so many benefits, direct and indirect, diffusing 
themselves among all the people of the country. 

The amendment was then agreed to by the Senate, but the House 
disagreed, and on May 21 the Senate receded from its amendment. 
Although the bill was again introduced in the Senate at the beginning 
of the second session of the Fifty-fourth Congress (January 28, 1897), 
"the subject obtained no further consideration. 

In 1897 several expedients were suggested for the relief of the 
national collections, none of which had relation to the contemplated 
new building. In Januaiy of that year inquiries made by the House 
Committee on Appropriations were replied to by Secretary Langley 
as follows: 

I have delayed this reply till I could consult a trustworthy architect as to whether 
the walls of the Museum Ijuiiding would bear the additional strain if otiier stories 
were added. It appears to l)e his opinion that the cost of enlarging the present 
stru("ture by additional height would not be warranted l)y the result, and that the 
gain in exhibition space would be largely offset by its loss below from the interfer- 
ence with light. 

As regards your inquiry about the building known as the Army Medical Museum, 
I have to say that this is located at the corner of Seventh and B streeets southwest, 
and covers about 21,000 square feet of ground. The center building on B street is 
112 feet in length and 54 feet 8 inches in width, exclusive of ornamental and other 
projections. It has a 1)asement, and is three full stories in height. A fourth story 
is over the main entrance on B street. The structure is flanked by two wings on 
each side, 60 by 131 feet, with basement. The heights of the stories are as follows: 
Basement, 11 feet; first story, 15 feet; second story, center Ijuilding, 14 feet, wings, 
32 feet; third story, center building, 13 feet; fourth story, center building, extends 
to the roof. The total floor space, if the floor were completed at the thinl story, 
would be nearly 90,000 square feet, including the basement, and though all the 
building as now arranged is not adapted to museum exhibition purposes, it could 
be used so as to be a very great help. 

At a meeting of the Regents on January 27, 1897, the Secretarj'^ 
announced that he had been asked by the Joint Connuittee on the 



NATIONAL MUSEUM l?UILDrNOP. 285 

Li})rary what the Niitional Muscnim had which would serve to decorate 
the new Library buildino-, whereupon it was resolved — 

That ill tluM)pini()u of the Board of Ri'j;;enta of the HiiiithHoiiiaii Institution it will 
not be expedient or wise to interfere with the integrity of the National INIusenni l)y 
lending, for the decoration of the Library building, any of the articles or property 
now in its care. 

At a subsequent meeting- of the Boai'd, Februar}' 1, on the sugges- 
tion of Dr. Charles D. Walcott, in his capacity as Director of the 
U. S. Geological Survey, it was resolved — 

That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution look with favor upon 
the proposition to estabhsh a museum of practical and industrial geology in the 
neighborhood of the National Museum. 

It has, however, since ])een arranged that this special feature shall 
remain a part of the National Museum. 

In his report for 1898, as Acting Assistant Secretary in charge of 
the National Museum, Doctor Walcott discussed as follows the neces- 
sity for a new building: 

The present National Museum building was erected with the view of covering the 
largest amount of space with the least outlay of money. In this respect it may be 
considered a success. It is, in fact, scarcely more than the shadow of such a massive, 
dignified, and well-finished building as should be the home of the great national 
collections. There is needed at once a spacious, absolutely fireproof building of 
several stories, constructed of durable materials, well lighted, modern in equipment 
and. on such a plan that it can be added to as occasion demands in the future. A 
site for such a building is already owned by the Government; only the building 
needs to be provided for. What the Capitol building is to the nation, the Librarj"- 
building to the National Library, the Smithsonian building to the Smithsonian 
Institution, the new museum building should be to tlie National Museum. * * * 

The growth of the U. S. National Musuem was rapid under the successful charge 
of the late Dr. G. Brown Goode. When the character of the building and the funds 
available for its maintenance are considered, it compares favorably with any modern 
museum. It has received large collections from the scientific departments of the 
Government, and through private contribution (with some additions by purchase 
and exchange), all of which have been accommodated as well as could be in the 
inadequate laboratories, storerooms, and exhibition space. The galleries just com- 
pleted have added 16,000 sipiare feet of floor space, which will help to a certain 
extent to relieve the crowded condition of the exhibition halls and courts below. 
As an illustration of the present conditions and the necessity for more room, atten- 
tion is called to the anthropological collections, which illustrate the development 
and progress of man and his works. If the material now in the possession of the 
Government in this department should be properly placed on exhibition, it would 
occupjf the entire space in the present Museum building. The great collections in 
zoology, botany, economic geology, general geology, and i)aleontology should be 
entirely removed and jilaced in a building properly constructed for their study and 
exhibition. 

In the present building there is a great deficiency in laboratory facilities. Cura- 
tors and assistants are liampered for want of room in which to lay out, arrange, 
classify, mount, and laliel specimens. There should also be rooms in which students 
could bring together and compare various series of objects, and have at hand books 
and scientific apparatus. The present Museum building contains a few room^ suita-

ble for the i)uri)oseH inciitioiu'd, ))at the majority liave to he iiHed as storerooms, 
laboratories, and offices, and are therefore too mucli crowiled to serve in any one 
of these capacities. Owinuj to the pressure for .si)act', courts, halls, and galh'ricH 
intended for exhibition purposes, both in the Smithsonian building and in tiic 
Museum building, are unavoidably occupied to a considerable extent as lal)oratorieH 
and storerooms. Tliis lack of laboratory space is extremely detrimental to the 
interests of the Museum. 

Beyond six small basement rooms imdertwoof the corner j)avilions the present 
building has absolutely no provision in the way of basement or other rooms for the 
storage of collections which come in from dav to day from Government field collect- 
ors or private donors, or such as are separated for distribution or held for the use of 
students. To remedy this defect many expedients have necessarily Ijeen resorted 
to, such as placing storage cases (faced with mahogany to make them presentable) in 
the exhibition halls, hiring storage rooms in private ])uildings, and filling up offices, 
entrances, staircase landings, and passageways not aljsolutely indispensal)le. The 
ingenuity which lias })een exercised in this direction by some of the curators is very 
great, and the annoyances that are daily enchn-ed in tlie interest of preserving the 
collections deserve notice. What is needed is a series of spacious fireproof ))asements 
for the less perishal)le objects, the collections preserved in alccihol, and the ordinary 
stores and tools, and equally spacious dry lofts and rooms for those collections and 
stores which require protection from dampness. 

The present Museum building, though large in extent, is overcrowded. It was 
built with the cheapest materials and under the cheapest system of construction. Its 
lack of an'hitectural dignity and the indifferent character of the materials of which 
it is constructed give it the ajipearance of a tenqiorary structure and tend tocheajjen 
the effect of the really good cases and the very valuable collections which it contains. 
The visitor is everywhere confronted with rough walls, unfinished ceilings, and 
obtrusive trusses and supports. It should also be rememl)ered that a considerable 
portion of the collections are still in the Smithsonian building, where the crowding 
is scarcely less than in the Museum building. 

The following arc pr()])ii))ly the last ])ul)lislied remarks l)y Senator 
Morrill on the Hii))ject t(^ whicli so iniicii of iiis oiiero y had been given. 
They were made at a meeting- of the Board of Regents on f January 2i\ 

1898: 

As some of you know, I have ])een urging a new Museum building for about ten 
years. The bills I have introduced have passed through .the Senate several times, 
but never through the House. I may say now that I shall not live long enough to 
get the measure completed. It was heretofore contemiilated that there should be a 
Museum building on the west of the Smithsonian building, in a position correspond- 
ing with the present Museum building, and these two were to be connected by a 
building on B street, thus making the largest museum in the country. I have now 
about decided to abandon that ]ilan and try to secure the building on B street first. 
I merely state this in order to ascertain whether the change of plan is favored by the 
Board of Regents. 

The suggestion was adopted l)y the Board, but was subse(j[uently 
abandoned when the present plans were started. 

The report upon the V. S. National Museum for ii>Oi contains the 
following condensed accoiuit of the condition and requirements of the 
collections, b}^ the present assistant secretar}' in charge: 

Attention has repeatedly been called to the inadequacy of the present accommo- 
dations for the national collections. The Smithsonian building had become fully

occupied sduic twt'iity-live years afjo, when the larj^e contril)ati(ms to the (iovern- 
ment from exliihitors at tlie Philadelphia Centennial Exhil)ition led to the erection 
of the ]\In,«eniii hnildin>r, completed in 188L By 1883 this structure was also filled, 
and thoujrh numerous efforts have since been made to secure more ample quarters, 
all have met with faihnv. In ISSS, 1890, and 1892 the Senate voted $500,000 for a 
new building', and in 189(>, Si'50,000, but none of these measures was even considered 
in the House of Representatives. 

There has been no abatement in tlu' nund)er of collections received annually, but 
in fact a general increase from year to year, and a severe task has thus devolved 
upon the ]\Iuseum authorities in arranging for their disposition. New specimens 
have I'onstantly been added to the exhibition halls and storage rooms until both are 
overcrowded to the extent that in the one the objects, as a rule, can not be properly 
viewed by visitors, and in the other their classification has become impossible, and 
they are for the most j)art practically inaccessible for study. But so extensive have 
been the accessions that only a part could be disposed of in this manner, and it 
became necessary, several years ago, to resort to outside storage, which is now pnj- 
vided for in an old wooden shed upon the ]Mall and in several rented buildings. 
None of these buildings is of fireproof construction, though they contain collections 
of great value and in large part not replaceable. They also lack facilities for the 
classification and arrangement of the specimens, which are packed away in shipping 
boxes, and for the time serve no purpose of any kind. 

The collections made by the Government surveys, of which the ^Museum is tlie 
legal custodian, can continue to be received and housed, as a<lditional storage build- 
ings may he lease<l, if necessary, though the further provision of the law to make 
them at all times available for study and examination can no longer be carried out. 
The same applies to specimens ol)tained by purchase or exchange and to such dona- 
tions as are given without condition. The Museum is in fact being resolved into a 
mere storehouse of material which comes to it mainly without solicitation, and its 
larger purpose, while never lost sight of, is becoming more and more difficult to 
maintain. Its reserve or record collections in every branch should be so systemat- 
ically arranged that any spei'imens desired for study could inunediately 1)e found; 
the public exhibition shouhl comprise the entire range of JMuseum subjects, and be 
installed effectively and withont crowding, and there shouhl be ample and well- 
appointed working (juarters, in which all the activities of the establishment could 
be conveniently carried on. 

With the conditions as they now are, it is not to be wondered at tiiat the National 
Museum lacks that character of support which has done so much for many other 
museums. Its donations are generally small and relatively unimportant. The 
possessors of large and valuable collections will not present them where they can 
not be at once displayed or well arranged. Such inducements can now rarely be 
offered here, but many of tlie larger museums elsewhere owe their principal growth 
to generous gifts from wealthy patrons of science and the arts. Specific meu- 
tipn coidd be made of several large collections which their owners would have 
preferred to place at the national capital, but which have been given to or depositeil 
in other museums, because in Washington they would have to be packi-d away for 
an indefinite period, at great risk of injury and destruction. 

The amount of floor space occupied by the national colU'ctions is ver\^ much 
smaller than would appear to the casual visitor. The two main buildings contain, 
in fact, only 195, 48(5 square feet, to which the outside buildings, mostly rented, add 
43,203 square feet, making a total of 238,689 square feet. The latter are partly occu- 
pied by workshops, but are mainly used for the gross storage of specimens, and in no 
case for exhibition or for the arrangement in classified order of the reserve series. 

In London the subjects represented by the Fnitecl States National i\Tuseum arc 
distributed among several nuiseums, such as the British Museum, leaving out the 



288 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Library, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Museum of Practical Geology, 
which now have an agfj;regate of 989,388 K(]uare feet of floor space, soon to be 
increased by 400,000 or 500,000 square feet in the new addition to the Victoria and 
Albert Museum. In Berlin seven of the national museums relating to natural his- 
tory and the industrial arts possess some 575,000 square feet of area, and the new 
National History. Museum of Vienna has over 350,000 square feet alone. In our own 
country, the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, which, when 
completed, will cover a ground area of over 5^ acres, already has 356,800 square feet 
of floor space availa1)le. 

A study of the conditions in Washington has shown that to properly arrange the 
national collections and provide for the growth of perhaps fifteen or twenty years 
would require additional floor space to the extent of something like 400,000 or 
500,000 square feet. If this were obtained through the construction of a new build- 
ing having that amount of room, it would still be necessary to utilize both of the 
present buildings, and this seems the preferable course to pursue. 

The efforts of Senator Morrill, though so persistent and well 
directed, were not to bear their fruit, as he himself had intimated, 
until after his lamented death, -and, in fact, there was to be a lapse of 
five years before the culmination of his wishes was definitely assured. 
His large share in the final result must not be forgotten. Four times 
did he secure a majority vote in the Senate, and his influence in the 
House is shown by the favorable consideration given his bills by the 
committees to which the}^ were referred. His part, it is now recog- 
nized, was in the direction of educating, of impressing upon Congress 
the needs of the national collections, which he did by keeping the sub- 
ject continually alive for over ten years, through the frequent intro- 
duction of bills, the presentation of reports in which the requirements 
of the Museum were set forth in detail, and his own impressive 
remarks upon the floor. It came, therefore, to be not a question of 
whether the Museum should have additional and more worthy quarters, 
but rather one of finance; could the necessary funds, in the opinion of 
Congress, be granted for the purpose? 

Accordingly, the following request, which appeared in the Book of 
Estimates for 1908, occasioned no surprise: 

Plans for additional fireproof building, National Museum: For the preparation, 
under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, of preliminary 
plans for an additional fireproof building for the United States National 3Iuseum, to 
be erected on the Mall between Ninth and Twelfth streets west, including the 
expense of collecting necessary data, said plans and such recommendations thereon 
as the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution may deem necessary to be transmitted 
to Congress at its next regular session, five thousand dollars, to be immediately 
available. 

Note accompanying estimate. — In 1879 Congress appropriated $250,000 for the erec- 
tion of a building to meet the urgent needs of the National Museum. The structure 
then put up, and completed within the appropriation, was practically only a large 
storehouse, with few of the facilities demanded by a large museum, and was at the 
time expected to fill but a temporary want. It has in fact, however, been made to 
serve a most useful purpose and should continue so to do, but its accommodations 
have in all respects been long outgrown. By 1885 its exhibition halls and storage

rooms were already tilled; by 1890 they were in a congested condition. Sinci; tlicn 
it iias been necessary to lease temporary quarters for the incoming collections, these 
(juarters being increased from year to year until they now hold as much in quantity 
as the Museum building itself. In these places the collections are in constant dan- 
ger from tire, and being stored in packing cases, are subject to deterioration. 

The National Museum is constantly in receipt of large and important collections 
from private sources, which add to its wealth of treasures. The collections are 
mainly, however, the product of the Government surveys, ol)tained at great cost and 
constituting the material records of all national explorations. They are, therefore, 
jjractically not replaceable. All collections from these sources were by Congressional 
acts of 1846 and 1879 committed to the custody of the Smithsonian Institution, with 
provision for their scientific classification and arrangement. Under the conditions 
existing it becomes impossible to carry out either the spirit or the letter of the law. 
It is recommended that the sum of $5,000 be appropriated for the preparation of 
plans for a new Museum building. 

Certain tentative sketch plans had previously been prepared, in 
order to indicate to the Eegents the general style and approximate size 
of a building which it was thought would best meet the requirements. 
The cost of such a building in stone was estimated at from $5,000,000 
to $6,000,000. The matter was discussed with the Committees on 
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, the Secretary and others 
appearing before them in support of the measure. A dehnite sum for 
the cost of the building had not been fixed, nor were the tentative 
plans considered as entirely appropriate to be followed. It was 
explained that the amount named in the estimate was required to per- 
mit of a inore careful study of the conditions, and that the plans to 
be prepared would embod}" onl}' the actual needs. The item was not 
reported by the House committee, but passed the Senate with a clause 
limiting the cost of the building to $2,ot)0,0(M>. In conference, how- 
ever, this limit was reduced to $1,500,000, the bill as passed, in con- 
nection with the sundry civil act for 1908, ])eing as follows: 

Plans for additional building, National Museum: For the preparation, under the 
direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, of preliminary plans for an 
additional fireproof steel-frame brick and terra cotta building, to cost not exceeding 
one million five hundred thousand dollars, for the United States National ]\Iuseum, 
to be erected, when appropriated for, on the Mall, between Nintli and Twelfth 
streets west, said plans when completed to be transmitted l)y the Secretary of the 
Smithsonian Institution to Congress, five thousand dollars. 

The i)reliminary plans called for by the above act were completed 
during the following winter and on January 22, 1903, they Avere pre- 
sented, together with an explanatory report, to a special committee of 
the Board of Regents, appointed the previous year, "to represent to 
Congress the pressing necessity of additional room for the proper 
exhibition of specimens belonging to the National Museum." This 
committee, consisting of the six Congressional Regents, namely, Sen- 
ators O. II. Piatt, S. :\r. CnUlom, and F. :M. C^ockrell. and Representa- 
tives R. R. Ilitt, Robert Adams, jr., and Hugh A. Dinsmore, after

a full di.sciif^sion, })iiss('d the follow'mj;- I'osolution, which was subse- 
(|uently transmitted to Congress: 

That under the Hinitations of the law the eoniinittee hereby report to Congress 
Plan B for a new National Mnsenni l)uilding as the best ol)tainal)le for the amonnt 
mentioned; but in the judgment of the connnittee the larger plan, A, is V^elieved 
to be the one wliich should ])e adopted, and we therefore ask that Congress shall 
make the appropriation for it instead of for tlie smaller plan. 

On January !23, 1903, the plans and report wore transmitted to Con- 
gress and printed as Document No. 314, House of Representatives, 
Fifty-seventh Congress, second session. The arguments presented in 
the report have practically all been set forth in previous pages of this 
paper, and therefore only such extracts need be quoted here as relate 
to the plans and to the questions directly concerning their preparation. 
Of the plans themselves only two are given, one, marked "A,'' show- 
ing the outlines of the entire building as then designed, the other, 
marked " B," showing the half of the building, which it was estimated 
could be erected for the sum of f>l, 500,000, the limit of cost first 
established. Following tire the extracts from the report prepared by 
the assistant secretary in charge of the Museum: 

The plan contemplates a rectangular building al)out 486 feet front l)y about o-15 
feet deep and about 80 feet high including the basement. The building is designed 
for four floors, and will afford about 400,000 square feet of floor space, the first and 
second floors to be used for exhibition, the basement and upper floor for storage, 
workrooms, and other purposes necessary to the conduct of a museum. It could be 
erected in substantial form as a fireproof building for a sum not exceeding 13,000,000. 

The plan has been designed in such a manner that approximately one-half of the 
building could be constructed at once, presenting the appearance of a completed 
building and suitable for the Museum needs. This half would consist of the main 
or south wing and the middle wing, and is exhibited in a separate drawing. Whilst 
it would in no way provide for the growth of the Museum, it would relieve the 
present congested condition of the exhibition halls, render possible a proper classifi- 
cation of the reserve collections, and remove the necessity of employing any rented 
buildings. 

The plan of the liuilding lias been drawn after a study of all important existing 
museums, both in this country and abroad, and eiid)odies their useful features and 
avoids defects which have been revealed in the course of time. It is expected that, 
should this building ])e authorized, it would be superior for museum purposes to any 
building in this country or al)road, and it is respectfully recommended that the sum 
of $1,500,000 be appropriated for the construction of substantially so much of the 

building as is exhibited in Plan B. 

* * * * * * * 

The National jNIuseum occupies the ])uilding erected for its use in 1881, the greater 
part of the Smithsonian building, parts of three detached l)uildingson the Mall, and 
several renteil buildings south of B sti'eet SW. The area represented, together with 
the general use to which the several floors of the larger l)uildings and each of the 
smaller l)uil(lings are devoted, is shown in the following table:

An inspection of the several buildings shows conditions which are exceedingly 
deplorable for the National Mtiseum of a great country. Every branch is seriously 
liampered by the total inadequacy of the space assigned it, and the proper disposition 
of specimens long ago became impossible, with the result that year after year valu- 
able collections, often of large size, have had to be paiked away in insecure rented 
buildings, where they are also inaccessible. While the Museum building is not ill 
adapted to exhibition ]>urposes, it is much too small to serve the ])resent needs. Its 
halls are overcrowded, the cases being generally placed so near together that two 
persons can scarcely pass between them and no effective view of their contents can 
be obtained. An increase in space of one-half to two-thirds at least would be nec- 
essary to i)roperly display the present contents of these halls. 



292 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Having practically no l)ayenient, the only space available for the reserve storage, 
workrooms, and offices is the small rooms of the central towers and corner paviMons, 
except that some of the galleries designed for exhibition have from necessity been 
turned over to these purposes. In these quarters the specimens are packed almost 
solidly, in cases generally reaching to such a height as to make access to the upper 
ones extremely inconvenient. The workers have scarcely room in which to place 
their tables, and there is little space any where for the spreading out of specimens for 
purposes of study and classification or of preparation for exhibition. 

In the Smithsonian building, which was originally designed to l)e used only in 
small part for museum purposes, the conditions are similar. There are four exhi- 
bition halls, three used for zoology and one for prehistoric archaeology. The latter, 
occupying the entire upper floor of the main building, has, through the loosening 
and fall of large areas of plaster from the ceiling, been pronounced unsafe and closed 
to the public until funds can be obtained for its repair and renovation. The large 
corresponding room on the ground floor has four galleries extending nearly its entire 
length, which some fifteen years ago were turned into work and storage quarters 
for several branches of zoology. They are overcrowded with cases and tables and 
are, moreover, extremely unhealthful places for the assistants stationed there because 
of the impure air arising from the exhibition floor below. 

In the basement is stored the greater part of the valuable alcoholic collection of 
the Museum, in a series of dark, damp rooms, wholly unsuited to the purpose, and 
where a great deal of work has to be carried on. The other workrooms and store- 
rooms in the Smithsonian building, besides two or three small ones on the main 
floor, are in the north tower, which is utilized for these purposes up to the height of 
the seventh story. It is scarcely necessary to explain that many of these rooms, all 
of which are very small, are inconvenient of access, and that specimens can be car- 
ried to and from them only with difficulty. 

Many of the activities of the Museum and much the greater part of its storage have 
for a long period had to be provided for in outside buildings, partly on the Mall and 
partly rented at an annual expense of over $4,000. The taxidermists are quartered 
in the upper pait of the Smithsonian stable and in a temporary frame structure back 
of the Smithsonian building. On Armory square, adjoining the Fish Commission 
building, is an old, dilapidated wooden shed filled with specimens. On Ninth street 
SW. there is under lease a large area of land covered with wooden sheds containing 
an immense amount of valuable collections and much other Museum property. The 
greater part of the so-called Marsh collection of vertebrate fossils, which has been 
valued at above $150,000, is still stored in a rented building at Tenth street and Mary- 
land avenue, which also provides space for several preparators' workshops. Two 
other rented buildings are likeM'ise required to accommodate the extensive carpenter, 
paint, and glazing shops which are required for the making of furniture and for the 
repairs about the main buildings. 

In order to carry out the purposes for which it exists, the National Museum requires 
a greatly increased amount of space and that any additional space provided be better 
adapted to its wants than that now occupied. 

For the exhibition collections a connected series of relatively large rooms or halls _ 
is needed to permit of the arrangement of the specimens and groups of specimens 
(many being of considerable size) in such manner as will best adapt them to the 
comprehension of the public and, by the avoidance of crowding, allow them to be 
viewed effectively. 

The record collections, commonly known as the reserve or study series, comprising 
the bulk of the material in most departments, while demanding such a convenient 
disposition as will insure the ready examination of specimens, require relatively less 
space than the exhibition collections, as they can be much more compactly arranged 



NATIONAL MUSEUM BUELDINGS. 293 

in drawers and on shelves. Yet their extent is so great that the question of their 
accomniodatioii is one of the most important ones for consideration. Tliey have 
lit't'n mainly derived from the Government surveys of the past sixty years and rep- 
resent a very large expenditure of pulilic money. 

For the activities of the Museum are needed many well-lighted and well-appointed 
rooms to serve as laboratories for classifying collections and for scientific research 
and as workshops for the prejiaration of specimens for study and for exhibition. It 
sliould be noted in this connection that tiie Museum is called ujjon to furnish work- 
rooms for several of the scientific bureaus, whose collections are partly studied there, 
and that, by a recent act of Congress, it is incumbent upon the Musemu U) pro\ide 
facilities for such students and investigators from any part of the country as may 
choose to visit it for purposes of research. 

Finally, space must be provided for certain general and miscellaneous purposes, 
such as the mechanical workshops and storerooms, the heating plant, public-comfort 
rooms, the library, a lecture hall, the administrative offices, etc. 

An estimate of the amount of space needed ha.* been reached by a careful consid- 
eration of the several requirements as set forth below, namely: 

(1) To relieve the present very congested condition of the exhibition halls. 

(2) To provide for the display of f)bjects now in storage which are suitaljle and 
intended for public exhibition. 

(3) Convenient and systematic storage for the vast reserve or record collections, 
which are now for the most part inaccessible for examination. 

(4) Suitable scientific lal)oratories, preparators' workshops, etc. 

(5) The mechanical worksho{)S required in making repairs to buildings and in the 
construction and repair of cases and other furniture and fixtures. 

(6) Offices necessary for administrative and other purposes common to all the 
branches of the Museum. 

(7) The space required for the heating plant, the library, a lecture hall, public- 
comfort rooms, and other miscellaneous purposes. 

(8) Provision for future growth. The limitation of cost fixed by the sundry civil 
appropriation act of June 28, 1902, prevents the carrying out of any extravagant 
views in this regard; and if the building erected have only the area contemplated by 
the plans svabmitted the National Museum will again be crowded and in need of 
room certainly before the end of another ten years and probably of five years. 

The growth of the Museum for a number of years past has been mainly through 
the receii)t of material whii-h by law it must receive and care for. The amount of 
material declined or diverted elsewhere during the last ten or fifteen years because of 
the lack of room would have occupied a very large proportion of the present exhi- 
bition space and have greatly increased the money value of the collections. The 
same c*onditions have prevented the Museum authorities from soliciting large contri- 
butions, Imt with adequate facilities many extensive exhil>it,s can be had for the 
asking. The department of arts and industries, the more ]>ractical side of the 
Museum, has perhaps sufferetl most from the lack of accommodations, l^arge exhibits 
have had to be removed to storage, and the growth of this most important and 
striking branch was necessarily stojiped some time ago. It should l)e made here, as 
it has l)een in all the larger cai)itals of the world, one of the most important features 
of tlie national collections, and its increase, once stimulated, would go forward rap- 
idly and at relatively small expense, as generous donations might l)e exjiei-ted from 
all quarters. 

Using the above topics as a basis for calculations, the amount of space imme- 
diately required has been worked out for each of the departments. This information 
is summarized in the following table, which gives also for each sul)ject the space 
now ot'cu]>ied. With regard to the present storage areas, it should be borne in mind

With regard to the space now occupied, there are certain areas which, for various 

reasons, slfould be abandoned, namely: 

Square feet. 

Rented buildings (area) 34, 115 

Outside buildings on the Smithsonian reservation and Armory square, which 
have been used only as temporary expedients and are for the most part 
insecure structures (area) 9, 088 

Space used for storage and some other purposes in the basement, in the upper 
part of the north tower, and at the east end of the Smithsonian building, 
being partly unsuitable and partly inaccessible (area) 12, 885 

Total 56,088 

Deducting this area from the total area now occupied (238,689 square feet) leaves 
182,601 square feet as the amount of space now actually available and appropriate 
for the future needs of the Museum. Again, deducting this amount from the total 
space named above as required for the Museum (670,000 square feet) leaves approx- 
imately 487,000 square feet to be provided for in a new building. The sum named 
in the sundry civil act of June 28, 1902 ($1,500,000) as the limit of cost for the pro- 
posed new building will not, however, permit of the erection by any method of 
construction of a building having that amount of space. 

Several jilans have been drawn in an effort to reconcile the needs of the Museum 
with the limitation of cost proposed by Congress, but none succe.ssfully. The last 
l)lan, contemplating the smallest size of building thi^t it has been judged advisable 
to recommend, is the one herewith presented. It rei)resents a rectangular build- 
ing, having a frontage of about 486 feet, a depth of about 345 feet, not including 
projections, and a height above the ground at the front of about 70 feet. There will 
be two open courts. The building is designed to have four floors, inclusive of the 
basement (which will underlie the entire structure), and will afford about 400,000 
square feet of floor space. The first and second floors are intended to be used for 



NATIONAL MTTSET^M BUTLDTNGS. 295 

the public exhi))ition ('(illections and the baseiiiciit and n]>iicr floor for the reserve 
or record collections, workrooms, ofliccs, and otliei- general ami miscellaneous pur- 
poses. This is an approximately equal division of the space between the public 
halls and the other requirements of the Museum. The plan shows entire simplicity 
of design, and has been drawn with reference to the use of brick and terra cotta in 
the construction of the outer faces, although stone could lie substituti'd ior these 
materials if so ordered. 

The interior arrangement al)ove the basement is a cond)ination of large and small 
halls, the three largest halls l)eing lighted from above and having two series of gal- 
leries of sufficient width to permit of their being screened off and made into series of 
separate rooms for exhibition and other purposes. This arrangement has been 
adopted as practically furnishing the largest possible amount of well-lighted floor 
space in a building of the size ])ro[)(ised, and as presenting many other important 
advantages. It is felt that a building i)ut up on these lines would in many, if not in 
all, respects prove sui)erior for museum purposes to those of any existing museums, 
either at home or abroad. 

The cost of erecting a building in accordance with the plan submitted in a most 
simple though substantial manner has been estimated at about $3,000,000. The 
plan has been so designed, however, that approximately one-half the building can 
be constructed separately, with practically the appearance of a completed building 
and suited to the different kinds of museum requirements. This half would consist 
of the main or south wing and the middle wing, as represented in a separate draw- 
ing. While this part would not provide for future growth, it would relieve the 
l^resent congested condition of the ^Museum, make outside storage unnecessary, and 
render possible a safe disposition and essentially t-onvenient arrangement of the 
present collections. 

This half section of the building as planned could be erected for $1,500,000. 

At the hearing'' before the House Committee on Appropriations, on 
Januar3' 23, 1903, the question of legislation for the new building- was 
thoroughly discussed. It was not douT)ted that half the building could 
be erected within the limit of $1,500,000 fixed hy the act of the previ- 
ous ,year, and the entire building for not exceeding $3,000,000, ])ut in 
either case the fronts would require to be constructed of brick and 
terra cotta. There was no objection to the use of these materials on 
the score of durability, but in view of the lavge size of the building, 
its conspicuous position, and the fact that it would be expected to rank 
among the prominent pu})lic structures at the capital, it was urged 
upon the connnittee that stone fronts would produce a more dignified 
effect, and that the change in this respect would not add extravagantly 
to the cost of the building. Estimates showed, in fact, that if stone 
were employed the entire building could be erected within the sum of 
$3,500,000, and one-half tlu; building within $1,()25,000. 

The matter was not reported to the House in any form, ))iit in tlu^ 
Senate the granting of the full siun was favorably considered, and the 
bill as there passed was finally agreed to in conference as an item in 
the sundry civil act for the year ending June 30, lOO-l. It is as follows: 

I'>iiilding for National .Museum: To enable the Regents of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion to commence the erection of a suitable fireproof building with granite fronts, for 
the use of the National Museum, to be erected on tlie north side of the ^hdl, between 



296 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Ninth and Twelftli streets northwest, suljstantially in accordance with the Plan A, 
prei)ared and .submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Smitlisonian Institution 
under tlie {)r()visions of the act approved June twenty-eighth, nineteen hundred and 
two, two hundred and lifty thousand dollars. 8aid building com2:)lete, including 
heating and ventilating apparatus and elevators, shall cost not to exceed three million 
live hundred thousand dollars, and a contract or contracts for its completion is hereby 
authorized to be entered into subject to appropriations to be made by Congress. 
The construction shall he in charge of Bernard R. Green, Superintendent of Build- 
ings and Grounds, Lil)rary of Congress, wlio shall make the contracts herein author- 
ized and disburse all aj)propriations made for the work, and shall rec^eive as full 
compensation for liis services hereunder the sum of two thousand dollars annually 
in addition to his present salary, to be paid out of said appropriations. 

At a meeting- of the Board of Keg'ents on March 12, 1903, the passage 
of the above act was announced, and it was resolved: 

That the Secretary, with the advice and consent of the chancellor and the chair- 
man of the executive connnittee, be authorized to represent the Board of Regents so 
far as may be necessary in consultation with Bernard R. Green, to whom the con- 
struction and contracts for the new Mu.seum building are committed by Congress in 
the act making an appropriation for that purpose. 

Some little time was consumed in the preliminar}^ arrangements, 
which included the selection of Messrs. Hornblower & Marshall, of 
Washington, as the architects of the building. The}^ had made the 
lirst tentative sketches and the preliminary plans previously mentioned, 
and it may also be said that for a number of j^ears they have acted 
fof the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum in all matters 
requiring architectural advice. They have likewise recently visited 
many of the prominent museums of Europe, which has given them an 
invalua])le experience in museimi requirements. 

At the time of writing the general plans, showing the several floors 
and fayades, are nearing completion. 

DESCRIPTION. 

It is imposi5ible at the present time to describe more than the lead- 
ing features of this structure, since, though work upon the foundation 
has begun, the plans are not entirely completed. The building will 
be rectangular in shape, and faced with granite on all sides. It will 
liavo a length of 551 feet, a width of 318 feet, exclusive of projections, 
and a height of stonework above the basement floor of YT feet. There 
will be four stories including the ))asemeiit, which, beginning above 
tiie level of the adjoining street, will be well lighted and entirely 
available for use. Tlu> main and second stories will contain tlu^ exhibi- 
tion collections, while the basement and upper story will l)e allotted to 
the many other requirements of a large nuiseimi. 

In a general way it may l)e said that the building will consist pri- 
marily of a main part in the shape of a l)i-oad T, comprising three 
wide wings or sections diverging at right angles from a large rotunda 
at the southern or princij)al entrance. Ranges of narrower width.

one on each side and two at the north, will connect the three ends of 
the T or main sections sous to inclose two lar^e open courts (each 12S 
feet square), and thus complete tiie (piadrangle. The two south sec- 
tions, which, with the rotunda, comprise the front part of the build- 
ino-. will project slightly at each end beyond the w^alls of the side 
ranges. 

The new^ structure will he located on the north side of the Mall, in 
the so-called Smithsonian Park, about midway between Ninth and 
Twelfth streets, directly in front of the Smithsonian building, and with 
its center, like that of the latter, on the axis of Tenth street. While 
the main front and enti'ance wdll face southward, or toward the mid- 
dle of the park, there will also be a commodious entrance by wa^- of 
the basement on the north, as an approach from Tenth street. The 
northern fayade will be about 78 feet from the sidewalk of B street 
north, while the central projection thereof, containing the entrance, 
will reach about 25 feet nearer to the street. 

As the land rises rapidl}^ southward from B street, it has been 
planned to have the basement floor slightl}' above the le\'el of that 
street, but at the south the top of the basement will be nearly on a 
level with the ground, Suita})le embankments will be built along the 
sides of the building, inclosing a Inroad area, Avhich will also extend 
along the south front, thus making the basement equivalent to a full 
story for at least workroom, lalioratory, storage, and heating purposes. 
Its height will be 14 feet. 

The first and second stories, intended for the public, will be 20 feet 
and 19 feet .5 inches high, respectivelv. The windows will measure 11 
feet 9 inches high in the tirst and 12 feet high in the second, the cor- 
responding ones in the two stories occupying the same embrasure, 
though separated by ornamental metal work. These window^s will be 
about Hi feet wide, and the intervening wall space about 7 feet wide, 
giving a unit for the installation of exhibits of 18 feet 6 inches. 

The third story will ])e 12 feet in height, with windows aljout 7 feet 
high l)y 5 feet 3 inches wide, thus furnishing am])le light for all the 
requirements of the laboratories and storerooms. In the three main 
sections of the building thiu'e will be still another low story a])ove the 
last, suitable for the storage of dried specimens. 

The relativeh' small amount appropriated for this large building 
has demanded simplicity of design and the omission of all extrava- 
gant decoration. The lines and proportions have been so well phvnned, 
however, that the structure can not fail to be onv of great dignity 
and beauty and a worthy addition to the public buildings in Wash- 
ington. The granite will be laid in ashlar courses, but the entrances 
will be worked up with a certain amount of elaborateness. A metal 
dome, with skylight, will cover the rotunda, and there will also besky- 
iijihts a'vono- the main roofs for liiihtino- the laroe halls. 



298 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903, 

Tho rotunda at the south, or main, entrance will be about 116 feet 
scjuarc, and lighted entirely from above. It will connect directly 
with the three great halls, which are to be similar in character and 
of the same length and width, about 20J) by 116 feet, all provided 
with galleries except at the inner ends adjoining the rotunda. The 
galleries along the sides will be 32 feet wide, leaving an interspace of 
50 feet width. This central or open part of the main halls will be lis 
feet long and reach to ceiling lights imder the skylights, a distance 
of ()() feet, while the galleries and sides of the tirst story will receive 
their light from the large windows of the fronts and courts. The 
galleries of the second and third floors are intended to be entirel}' 
screened off from the central halls and treated as space that can be 
divided to suit the requirements. The space under the galleries may 
be treated in the same way or left open, as circumstances may dictate. 

The remainder of the building, consisting of the ranges on the east, 
west, and north, will be 5,5 feet in interior width and have solid floors, 
one above the other, their light being entirely obtained from windows. 

The main and second floors will, as before stated, be used Avholly 
for the public exhi])ition collections, while the upper floor will he 
divided into laboratories and storage rooms for the reserve collections. 
The basement will have the same dimensions as the first floor, but 
under the main halls it will require to l)e lighted artificially. The side 
areas will bo of sufficient width for teams, which may enter the build- 
ing at both ends of the south front. One of the south wings of the 
basement will be utilized for the boilers, power plant, mechanical 
workshops, etc, ; the other, as well as the ranges, probably for labora- 
tories and for the storage of specimens in such lines as can best be 
accommodated there, though some parts of the ranges may ])e availed 
of for exhibition purposes. 

The northern entrance will be b}^ way of the basement, into a large 
vestibule with elevators and stairways. There will also be passage- 
ways leading in all three directions, the central one commimicating 
directly with a small lecture hall occupying the center of the middle 
section of the basement. On each side of this hall will be a series of 
small rooms, some of which can be used for connnittee meetings. 

The net floor area of the building will be about 111,37-1 square feet, 
or about 9.14 acres, subdivided as follows: Basement and main floor, 
each about 110,732 square feet; second and third floors, each about 
88,955 square feet. 

FLOOR SPACE OCCUPIED BY THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The following is a detailed statement of the space occupied ])v the 
Museum on January 1, 1901, arranged mainly in explanation of the 
plans of the two principal existing buildings (Plates 21 and 29). Fig- 
ures are also given for the outside buildings, but the plans for these 
are omitted as being unim])()rtant.

STUDIHS OF THE MUSFUMS AM) KIXDKI'D INSTITUTIONS OF

A. — Museums and Kindked Institutions of New York City, 
Albany, Buffalo, and CHicACio." 

INTRODUCTION. 

The authorities of the Roj^al Collections of Art and vScience in 
Dresden coninii.ssionod me in 1899 to visit the niuseiinis and kindred 
institutions of the United States so far as they relate to inuseuni affairs, 
and to pay special attention to the preservation of the collections from 
fire. In the time at my disposal 1 could master only a portion of 
what might properly have been studied. I was moreover obliged to 
confine myself to the eastern part of that great countiy; even then 
I had to turn aside from a miml)er of cities and scientific centers well 
worthy of study, and I was far from able to exhaust the subject ev^en 
in those places that I visited. This will explain many omissions in 
my report. I was in New York from the Sth to the 26th of August 
and from the 19th to the 31st of October, in Albany from the ^Oth to 
the 29th of August, in Buttalo on the 29th and 30th of August, in 
Chicago from the 5th to the 13th of Septem}>er, in Washington from 
the llth to the 27th of September, in Philad(>li)hia from the 27th of 
September to the Sth of October, and in Boston and Cambridge from 
the 5th to the 19th of October. 

The parts of my report here presented include studies in New York 
('ity, Albany, Bulialo, and Chicago, and it is intended that other parts 
shall l)e printed as soon as possible, giving results of my studies in 
Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, and Cambridge. 

In the United States a sharp distinction can not always be made 
between museums and libraries, since many of the latter also include

collections of art and .science; })ut apart from this the libraries have 
ill oeneral already attained a higher degree of development than the 
museums, and for that reason I was the less able to pass them by. 
All things considered, the American libraries perhaps excel those of 
p]urope in art'hitecture and in administration methods, whereas this is 
not yet so decidedly the case with the museums. As both the libra- 
ries and the museums of the United States are almost unknown to us, 
I have assumed this lack of acquaintance in my report. However 
great the ignorance of Americans regarding Germany may be, it is at 
all events exceeded by the ignorance of the Germans regarding the 
United States. Although 3'ear after year more than a thousand 3'oung 
Americans study in German schools and thousands of men and women 
of the educated classes of the Union annually visit the "Fatherland," 
as Germany is affectionately called, proportionately few educated 
Germans go to the United States merely for the purpose of becoming 
acquainted with that country, with the exception of those Avho go to 
America to recuperate in the sharp atmosphere which stirs there. 

Although German colleagues who had visited American museums 
and Americans who came to Germany told me that " we had not much 
to learn there," still the authoritative opinions of men like Zittel, Ball, 
and Wallace indicated otherwise. In 1888 the well-known paleon- 
tologist of Munich expressed the opinion that the Americans had ])egun 
to make their natural history treasures accessible to the public and to 
specialists in a manner worthy in many respects of admiration and 
imitation. In 1885 the late director of the Science and Art Museums 
in Dublin was particularly impressed with the methodical planning, 
thoroughness, and order prevailing in the majority of the American 
museums. Many, though of recent date, already displayed an astound- 
ing development of strength, and the American people were looking 
forward with great and joyful hopes to a giant increase of their spheres 
of usefulness. Finally the distinguished English naturalist declared, in 
1887, that the Museum of Comparative Zoology of Harvard University, 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Avidely known as the Agassiz Museum, 
far excelled all European museums as an educational institution for 
the public, for students, and for the special investigator. That, how- 
ever, was half a generation ago, a period which in America counts for 
as much as half a century or more with us; in fact, during tlie last 
twenty years many imposing libraries and museums have been estab- 
lished in the United States. New York, above all, shows the evident 
tendency to ))econie the " first city of the world." It will at all events 
])ecome the greatest by its natural power of expansion and its location. 
The ardent desire of everyone's local patriotism is to accomplish the 
])ost, and I believe that this aim will in time be attained. We P^uro- 
peans must, each in his place, exert all our strengtli to avoid being 
outstripped. The other great cities of the eastern part of tlu> I'liited 



rtTUDIKS (►N MUSKUMS AND KINDRKI) INSTITUTIONS, M28 

States wliicli were all J was able to visit, likewise oti'ercd material 
beyond my expectation in the iield of my studies. 

I was considerably impressed with the capacity of Americans in this 
department, and am inclined to maintain that museum affairs in gen- 
eral are on a higher plane than in Europe. This is irrespective of 
material, and refers more to scientific than to art institutions. So far 
as the buildings and administrative affairs are concerned, Europeans 
have few good and matiy ordinaiy and even bad museums. The Ameri- 
cans, on the other hand (I speak only of the eastern part of the coun- 
try visited by me), have man}' more good and fewer ordinary or bad 
museums. These inferior nniseums, however, improve rapidly, cor- 
responding to the pace maintained in that country, whereas in Europe 
the rate of improvement is hopelessly slow. 

The unparalleled rapid development of affairs in the United States 
as compared with the Old World repels a critical method of examina- 
tion ])v the observer, not only because what has been accomplished is 
in a high degree worth}^ of respect and admiration, nay, is often even 
overwhelming, but also because such criticism would, in many cases, 
l)e forestalled by changed conditions, so that the critic in judging the 
rapidly changing conditions must keep in mind the future not less than 
the present, and must even regard the projected as already accom- 
plished. I therefore confine myself in the main portion of my report 
more to making conspicuous the positive, the instructive, and what is 
new to us, and relegate any critical remarks to footnotes, in order 
not to mar the general impression of my statements. With regard to 
these criticisms, I must guard against referring to European or even 
Dresden museums as if things were better in these. On the contrary, 
things are generally not done as well on this side of the ""pond," as 
tiie Americans call the Atlantic Ocean. 1 should, therefore, have pre- 
ferred to suppress such remarks entirely, but where there is light 
there are generally shadows also, and, honor to truth, I pi'omised 
American friends and colleagues not to do so. It was thought that 
something might be gained here and there by criticism. Hut, although 
this may not come to pass, 1 wished to show my gratitude, in some 
measure at least, since the reception accorded me by all those interested 
in similar subjects with whom I had the pleasure of becoming closely 
acquainted was so <)])liging and overcoming that I ciin hardly (^xpress 
my feelings in words. There Jire no men more leady to help or more 
amiable than the learned citizens of the Union, and I hope that they 
will regard my report oidy as a "tribute of admiration and gratitude."

EFFORTS OF THE AMERICAN NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUMS TO 
INCREASE THEIR USEFULNESS." 

[The foUowiii!^ observations, written by Doctor Meyer since the above introduction to the present 
work was printed, are added as of interest herein.] 

Thci-0 arc in the United States 8,000 public lil^rarie.s containing 
60,(»00,00<) volumes. Sixty of these libraries contain over 100,000 
volunuvs each, and four of them have 500,000 each.'^ The increase in 
the luunbei' of public museums does not keep pace with this amazing 
increase in the number of- libraries, although it has often been recom- 
mended that a small popular nuiseum be attached to each public library.'^ 
There are 350 public museums, of which 250 are natural history muse- 
ums.'' Germany has perhaps 500 or more, among them 150 natural 
history museums.' Of the latter, France has 300,-^" and Great Britain 
250. f'' Of the 250 natural history nuiscums in the United States, 175 
ttelong to schools and universities, 30 to learned societies, 30 are State 
museiuns, and 15 are maintained by private individuals or are sup- 
ported b}^ municipal funds. The State of New York, with 7,000,000 
inhabitants, has thirty-one natural history museums; Pennsylvania with 
(5,000,000, nineteen; Massachusetts with 3,000,000, seventeen; Illinois 
Avith 5,000,000, fifteen; Ohio with 1:,000,000, fourteen; California with 
1,500,000, ten;'' etc. The natural history museums, therefore, by 
virtue of their number, already play an important part not only as 
scientific museums, but also as a means of popular education, when we 
consider the efforts being made to serve the entire community. This 
will be evident from the following l)rief account:

tho lirst to carofully consider .surli a ])laii," had dovelopod the princi- 
ples on which he meant to separate an exhibition collection for visitors 
from a scientific collection for investigators in the museum of compara- 
tive zoology, which he was to establish at Cam))ridge in the United 
States. He actually carried out these plans a few years later. It was 
a long- time before his ideas were adopted in Europe; but all new 
museums in the United States, at least, were similarly arranged from 
that time. In 1881 the U. S. National Museum at Washington adopted 
as of prime importance the general principle 'Ho place no object on 
exhibition which had not some special educational value and which was 
not capable of attracting and instructing a large proportion of the 
visitors.'"* The U. S. National Museum, therefore, definitely adopted 
the principles which subsequently determined to a greater or lesser 
degree the mode of operation of all natural history museums in the 
United States. Consequently, the visitor to a museum is not tor- 
mented Avith endless series of like or similar objects, and he need not 
himself laboriously^ pick out from an excess of material the objects 
which are to him comprehensible, instructive, or entertaining. They 
are placed before him without any annoying and tiresome labor on his 
part. The carrying out of this principle, essential to an exhibition 
collection, is in general made easy for the American museums by the 
circumstance that means are willingly furnished them for the purpose. 
Every month at the New York Natural Histor}^ Museum they place 
on exhibition those migratory birds which occur in the vicinity at 
that particular time. This fact is mentioned as a characteristic example 
of the way in which museum authorities strive to incite the public to 
a direct observation of nature. A. R. Wallace, the well-known Eng- 
lish naturalist, as far back as 1809, descri])ed how a public museum for 
the people should be constituted;'' but such an attempt, or even one 
approximating it, has not yet been made anywhere, though much has 
been said and written on the suliject. 

Departnu-iiU for children. — In the large museums, a section ma}'^ 
generally be found specially adapted to the comprehension of children. 
All, or nearly all, large libraries also have sections for children; thus, 
for example, the Brooklyn Museum of Arts and Sciences,'' whose 
children's department was visited in the year 1902 by more than 
84,000 children. This children's museum pu))lishes a small illustrated

monthly nuioazine, the Children's Museum Bulletin, in which may be 
found much elementary instruction. Instructive lectures, illusti-ated 
by objects from the collections, are also given there for young teach- 
ei's of both sexes. The children's library contains about 3,000 titles. 
Similarly in the National Museum in Washington. This Museum is 
under the direction of the celebrated Smithsonian Institution, which 
was founded in 184(5 '' for the increase and diffusion of knowledge 
among ujen,"' not alone, like our academies, for the advancement of 
"science" in its more restricted sense. The Smithsonian Institution 
is the most renowned scientific institution in the United States. Its 
director, the noted physicist and astronomer, S. P. Langley, though 
not specially occupied with museum affairs, took personal charge of 
the estal)lishment of this children's room in the great Museum and 
worked out the details with loving care. All labels are worded in such 
a way as to be readily understood by children. The object was to 
develop the minds of the children and inspire them with a love for 
nature, as had been proposed by Agassiz. This, it was thought, could 
best be accomplished by withholding from them the confused mass of 
objects to be found in a scientific collection, so that they might be 
attracted and interested, but not oppressed and repelled. Langley 
lias admirably expressed himself upon this subject and with the humor 
characteristic of Americans." 

Prises for school ehildren. — Direct efforts are made to induce pupils 
of both sexes to visit the museums by offering prizes for essays 
adapted to the different classes. This custom has been carried on 
especiall}^ at the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburg, since 1896. The report 
on the subject for the year 1902 occupies 41 pages. ^ At the last com- 
petition 47 prizes of from five to twent3^-five dollars were offered. 
The subjects proposed were (1) bird life, as illustrated in the museum; 
(2) minerals and gemstones in the museum; (3) why I like the Car- 
negie Museum. No composition was to exceed 1,200 words in length. 
The contest lasted four weeks. Even the teachers whose pupils show 
the best training are suitabl}^ rewarded. Last year 813 children took 
part in the contest. The award of prizes is always made the occasion 
for a great popular gathering and resembles a kind of public jubilee. 
The best two essays on bird life are printed in the above-named 
report. They were submitted by boys 13 and 17 years of age. That 
of the younger boy is particularly well done. 

Lectures. — Great influence is exerted by public lectures. Tw« 
striking examples of this may be given. The American Museum of

Natural Histoiy in Now York i.s divided into 12 departments. The 
department of public instruction stands at the head of the list, a cir- 
cumstance which indipates the main object of the museum. The director 
of this department constantly keeps in stock, so to speak, 400 lectures on 
200 difierent subjects. One series is especially prepared for teachers, 
another for the general public, a third for members of the museum 
and their families. A person may become a member b}^ the annual 
payment of $L0. In the j'ear 1902, 90 lectures were delivered before 
27,000 persons." The Institute of Arts and Sciences in Brooklyn holds 
annually more than 4,000 meetings with lectures, exhibitions, and 
instruction for more than 250,000 persons.^ A considerable part of 
these lectures and exhibitions devolves upon the museum of the insti- 
tute which is established upon a very large scale. It would be a mis- 
take to suppose that upon this account the scientitic affairs of the 
above-named museums are neglected. These are more in the hands 
of other officials. 

Pojxdar piMlcations. — Many museums publish guides and pam- 
phlets on various subjects. In this respect again, the American Museum 
of Natural History in New York takes the lead. We may recall, for 
example, guides to the collection of })irds, guides to the geological 
and paleontological collection; also, a quarterly museum journal, in 
which all news relating to the museum is published in popular form; 
and, finally, pamphlets such as The Butterflies of New York and Vicin- 
ity, The North American Ruminants, The Collection of Minerals, and 
many others. All are profusely illustrated and thousands of copies 
are sold at moderate prices. 

Lending of collections. — In different museums, collections are lent 
to public schools for educational purposes. For example, in the New 
York Natural History Museum a large number of such collections of 
50, 100, or more specimens each are laid aside and lent for varying 
periods to the schools which apply for them. This is also done by the 
New Y'ork State Museum at Albany and others. In the tirst-named 
museum, school children with their teachers are allowed to study more 
carefully certain reserve collections and even to handle the specimens. 
Exceptional ability is, of course, required for the administration of 
such establishments, but the American citizen now demands that the 
museums make themselves useful in as many ways as possible, and 
continually provide some incentive to o))servation and study. 

Time of open in </. — The American museums are almost universally 
open daily from morning till evening, free of charge. On the other 
hand, the number of custodians is small as compared with P^ui-opean 
museums. The citizen of the United States rarely steals public prop-

<n-tv, since ho rooai'tls it as bolont»-ino- to him personally, whereas here 
in (Icrinany, the authorities as proprietors antagonize the visitor, who 
is treated more or less as an intruder, and deports himself in an unas- 
sumino" manner. 

From the t'oreg-oing- it will be seen that the Americans assign a lead- 
ing part in the activity of their museums to the exhibition collections, 
which they arrange for wide circles of the educated, half -educated, 
and uneducated classes. At the same time, they foster the interests 
even of little children, and try to stimulate the older ones by offering- 
prizes; they make the museums contribute directly to the cause of 
education by series of lectures, by popular publications, and by lend- 
ing collections; and they keep the doors of their museums open to 
everybody from morning till evening. How far all this could be 
adapted to German conditions is a question which ought to be discussed 
in a separate article. 

I.— THE CITY OF NKW YORK. 

[Population 8,440,000, or, including its surroundings, 1,000,000 inhabitants.] 
1. AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY. 

In comparison with other cities of the Union, New York was very 
slow in organizing a natural history museum, but when, in the year 
1869, it was decided to establish one, a project on the grandest scale of 
all was adopted and collecting was inunediately begun in a compre- 
liensiA^e wa3^ 

The building occupies a detached position alongside of Central Park 
near great business streets, and has a richly molded fayade of red brick, 
syenite, and granite, with towers, jutties, balconies, roofs, etc., in mod- 
ern Romanesque style, approaching the French castle type, which was 
introduced into P^ngland some decades ago. This style has flourished in 
the United States chiefly through the influence of the architect Rich- 
ardson. The museum serves for anthropology, ethnography, arche- 
ology, zoology, paleontology, geology, mineralogy, and botany. The 
architects were, and still are, Vaux, Cady, Berg, and See. The inner 
building, 183 feet long, G5 feet wide, and 101 feet high, the first to be 
completed, was occupied in 1877. The existing collections were in the 
meantime accommodated in the old arsenal in Central Park. The 
height of the first floor is 18' feet; the second and third floors are 
together 30 feet, consisting in reality of only one floor and a gallery, 
the latter with a separate row of windows; the fourth floor 22 feet; 
and the fifth, 16 feet. The dimensions of the halls are 85 by 85, 155 
l)y 75, 172 by 90, and 183 by 65 feet. In America they still reckon 
by feet, equal to 0.305 meter. 

About one-sixth of the projected building is now erected. The 
entire building when completed, which may not be for generations,

will occupy 13 acres," and will form a quadi'anj'lc with four courts, 
each 218 feet s([uare. A doni(>-like central towiM- 'MH) feet luj(h is also 
planned.'' The south side of this quadrangle, TriO feet lono- and 75 to 
90 feet wide, was completed in 1S99, in addition to the previously 
built south arm of tlie central cross and the ground floor of the central 
building, as mentioned, and forms a palace six to seven stories high, 
including cellar and ground floor — from cellar to roof 127 feet high — 
which has already cost, together with furniture, $2,800,000,'' and 
atfords 148,000 square feet of exhibition space. The building and 
furniture are paid for by the city by authority of the government of 
the State of New York. The city also owns the ground. In the year 
1900, $150,000 was available for continuing the construction of the 
building. When the future completion of this enormous building is 
considered it ma}" well be asked whether so great a show museum for 
natural history can still attain its objects. 

The value of the existing collections is estimated at $2,800,000, and 
the library contains about 44,000 volumes.'' The annual expenses of 
$136,000 are borne l)y the city, under authority of the government 
of the State of New York; $93,000 of these expenses are made up of 
salaries and wages. In the year 1899, $48,000 additional was raised 
by private contribution. Of the 71 employees 14 are scientists. A 
president who serves without salary is at the head of the institution, 
under a board of trustees of 24 members, mostly patrons of the 
establishment. Together with the president, who is a layman, a 
zoologist or paleontologist looks after the general scientitic inter- 
ests of the nmseum,*^ which are discussed with the higher officials 
as in a university facult3\ The institution is divided into six depart- 
ments:' (1) Public instruction; (2) geology, mineralogy, concholog}', 
and marine invertebrates; (3) vertebrates; (4) vertebrate paleontology; 
(5) anthropology (physical anthropology, archeology, and ethnog- 
raphy); (6) entomology. 

Each department is under the direction of a curator. Three of 
these curators have only two assistants each; one department has one

of the British ISIuseuiii, which, however, now occupies only 8 acres with its buildings, 
and as great as the ground area of the Natural History -Museum in London, of which 
oidy 4 acres are now occupied by the building itself, (575 feet long, or four times as 
large as the old market in Dresden. 

''It is still a (juestion whether this will be erected. The towers of the Natural 
History Museum in London are 192 feet high.

assistant — in fact, there is too little 




.scientitic help for so great a 
lULiseuni. It is under the 
formal control of the regents 
of the university of the State 
of New York in Albany (see 
under Albany). The work- 
ing hours of the scientists 
are from 1) or 10 a. m. to 5 
p. m,; those of the other 
employees, from T or 8 to 5. 
For the increase of the col- 
lections $95,000 is appropri- 
ated annually, including the 
^ cost of expeditions. This 
g sum is derived from private 
■S contributions, $18,500 of 
m which is interest on a fund 
>. thus established. 
I Besides this, about 110,000 
are received from member- 
ship fees, and $1,400 from 
admission fees. In 1899 the 
trustees expended $75,000 to 
make good a deficit caused 
by purchases. The museum 
is open daily from 9 to 5^' 
(Monday and Tuesday on 
payment of 25 cents entrance 
fee), Sunday from 1 to 5, and 
Tuesday and Saturday even- 
ings from 8 to 10. Children 
under 8 or 9 years are admit- 
ted only when accompanied 
by grown persons. In 1899 
the visitors numbered over 
458,000 persons.^ Umbrellas 
and canes are checked free — 
voluntary fees for this serv- 
ice are not customary. In 
1898, 71 public evening lec- 
tures were given in a room 
on the ground floor, which is 



«From such constant exposure to light, which, nevertheless, is usual in American 
museums, many itortions of the collections rapidly go to ruin. 

''This number has probal)ly not int-reased after three years, for in 1902, 460,000 
visitors were recorded; in 1900, 523,522; and in 1901, 461,026.

105 feet square, and accommodates 1,000 persons. A new lecture 
room, 1.30 by 130 feet, desig-ned to accommodate 1,500 ])orsons, has 
been completed. It is situated under tiie projected central tower. 
These lectures were given by assistants in the museum, professors of 
Columbia Univ^ersit}^ in New York, and other scholars. There is a 
more extensive series, intended especially for teachers, for which the 
State of New York appropriates $12,000. The entire series of lectures 
in 1899 was attended by more than 66,000 persons, of whom 13,500 
were teachers. There are also evening receptions and exhibitions of 
scientific societies. 

The museum publishes annual reports (the thirty-first, for 1899, has 
11 plates and 96 page.s); octavo bulletins, with scientific papers and 
plates, of which 12 volumes have appeared; and quarto memoirs^ of 
which 3 volumes are in print. There have also been published several 
illustrated guides for certain departments; and an illustrated monthly, 
The American Museum Journal, has been started. The museum 
sends out series of scientific expeditions, which are constantly- bringing^ 
in a mass of fresh material, including- valuable purchases. In the year 
1899, 2 zoological, 3 paleontological, and 8 anthropological expeditions 
were in progress. These 8 expeditions, devoted to the anthropological, 
archeological, and ethnographical researches in the country, added to 
the museum 50,000 specimens. 

The building- is fireproof, of brick and iron, the floors being covered 
with tile and marble mosaic. The furniture is of wood. There are 
almost 20,000 lineal feet of cases and desks, for the increase of which 
an additional $75,000 was available in 1900. The plant for heating, ven- 
tilating, and lighting is now in the cellar, but is, however, to be removed 
to one of the courts on account of the marked shaking of the building. 
This will require an expenditure of $40,000. The heating is by steam. 
Ventilators, driven by steam power, force fresh air through the shafts 
into the building. Electricity and gas afford illumination. The rooms 
in the cellar and garret are spacious and light. Broad, slate-covered 
iron steps, in well-iightcd staircases, lead from the })ottom to the top 
of the building, but are little used, since large electric elevators, with 
a capacity of fifteen persons each, are constantly going- up and down. 
The architectural and color ornamentation of the interior is simple 
throughout, often, one might say, scarcely present — a feature which 
distinguishes this from many European museums in a most advanta- 
geous manner. The painting of the interior is white or of a uniform 
light color. 

Since the buildings as they now stand were erected separately during 
a period of over twenty-five years, something was necessarily gained 
by experience. The newer parts are more perfect than the older, 
and there can be no doubt that the remaining five-sixths of the 
nuiseum to be constructed will be still l)etter;. since in such a complex 
mass of structures it is not necessary to maintain perfect uniformity in

and liftings, as also with regard to the electrie illumination direetly 
from the ceiling. It may be strongly recommended that in other 
similar buildings attention be paid to what has here been accomplished. 
Each floor is provided with very long lines of fire hose, which are 
connected with steam engines; moreover, portable tire extinguishers 
are to be found everywhere.

The collections are still unequally developed, a fact which may be 
explained by their recent acquisition. America, however, stands in 
the foreground in regard to collections, rah^ontology shows a certain 
preponderance. North American miimmals and reptiles are especially 
well represented. The series showing the development of the horse 
and the rhinoceros deserve especial attention, as also the giant reptiles —

attention is paid to the art of stuffing and mounting- animals.*^ Exam- 
ples of this may l)e found in the great groups of tlie Ameriean elk and 
bison, surrounded by artiticial foliage and the like, in cases 32 feet long, 
18 feet wide, and 14 feet high; and also in different groups of birds, 
as for example, the pelicans. There are 55 such groups of birds and 
20 of mammals displayed in as man}" separate cases, independent of the 
systematic collection. 

In a section of the local ))ird collection the residents are separated 
from the migrants, and the latter are arranged in such a manner as to 
show those occurring in the neighborhood in different months, an 
arrangement that stimulates oliservation of nature. There are alto- 
gether about 12,000 stuffed birds in the collection. Particular atten- 
tion should be called also to the room devoted to North American 
woods, especially to sections of the trunks, with the foliage, blossoms, 
and fruits in water color. Almost every forest tree north of Mexico 
is represented. The comprehensive collections of skeletons, displaj^ed 
on the fifth story in a long corridor lighted from above, are practical 
and readily accessible. They lie in open, interchangeable, sliding 
drawers in cases with glass doors, so that the contents are readily 
accessil)le. The collections of 15,000 mammal skins and 70,000 bird 
skins are kept in separate and well-closed tin cases of three different 
sizes, standing one aljove another, with light, interchangeable sliding 
trays— an arrangement to be recommended in case of lack of space. 
Disinfection is accomplished b}" means of hot air (127° C), and also by 
bisulphide of carbon and b\' formalin.* 

Of the ethnographic and prehistoric collections, the American series 

f'The first preparator, J. Rowley, has published a book on the subject, The Art 
of Taxidermy (New York, D. Api)leton & Co., 1898), in whicli may be found fur- 
ther information re.ijarding some special methods. 

^ Some additional details regarding the collections may lie given here. In the pale- 
ontological s(>ction are to be found the North American invertebrates of James Hall 
(see also under Albany), with theii- many types, which were purchased in 1875 for 
$70,000; the North American mammals, reptiles, amphibia, and fishes of E. I). Cope, 
as well as his pampas mammals; the Terrell collection of fossil fishes from Ohio; a 
fine series of inoa skeletons, and the rich returns of. the expeditions which the 
museum sends out every year. Besides what has been mentioned, we may also refer 
to the series of TUanoUiermm species and the Tylomurus dyapelor (Cope), over 30 feet 
long. The entomological section contains one of the foremost general collections of 
insects in America, with about 400,000 specimens (Dresden has 280,000) and espe- 
cially rich in types. The concliological section is conspicuf)US. The collection of 
mammal and l)ird skins is limited almost entirely to America. It contains the 
ornithological collections of Prince Max von Wied from Brazil, with many tyjies; 
that of G. N. Lawrence from North America, and D. G. Elliot's collection of lium- 
ming ]>irds. The mineralogical section is very large and especially rich in jeivcls, 
which were collected ))y G. E. Kunz, the mineralogist of the well-known New York 
firm of Tiffany & Co., for the Paris Exixisition of 1889. Another collection by the 
same mineralogist has just been pui'chased from the recent I'aris Exposition for 
$50,000 and presented to the museum. [.Mr. J. P. Morgan presented in 1901 the 
celebrated Bement collection of minerals, worth .'?L'0{),()00.] Einally, special mention 
may be made of a great collection of American building stones.

series, the latter particularly with regard to ornament and develop- 
ment of >st>"le in the artistic manifestations of the Indian tribes. The 
Mexican sculpture hall is equall}^ rich and still more imposing. Here 
are casts, some of them colored, of monoliths, stehe, idols, altars, pil- 
lars, walls, etc., of the ruins of Mexico and Central America, the origi- 
nals of which still lie, with few exceptions, in the tropical thickets 
among the remains of ancient temples. There are also original stone 
sculptures from Copan and Yucatan, as well as ceramic and kindred 
collections relating to ancient Central American civilizations. Among 
these I may mention particularly the great series of nephrite, jadeite, 
and chloromelanite specimens. "^ 

«The finest ami most comprehensive collection of such nephrite and jadeite from 
all parts of the earth is in possession of H. R. Bishop, 881 Fifth avenue, New York, 
who has prepared a great work concerning them; it cost $40,000 to prepare the illus- 
trationn alone. In 1908, after the death of Mr. Bishop, this collection was incorporated 
in the IMetropolitan ]\Iuseum of Art in New York, which has thus acquired an ines- 
timal)]e treasure. 

I add here a more detailed description of the ethnographic-archeological collection. 

Two rooms on the first floor are devoted to ethnology, one on the second floor to 
North American archeology, particularly collections from the Pueblo region; the 
third floor (gallery) contains South American collections; the fourth, collections 
from Mexico and Central America. Four additional rooms in the southwest corner 
of the museum, which has just been completed, are to be devoted likewise to anthro- 
pology; on the first floor a continuation of the ethnological collections; on the sec- 
ond, of the collections of North American archeology; on the third, of the collections 
of South American archeology; on the fourth, continuation of the Mexican collec- 
tions. The ethnographic halls contain especially quite complete collections from the 
North Pacific coast of America, from the Eskimos from northeast America, from the 
islands of the Pacific Ocean, among them a series of old specimens in particularly 
good condition from New Zealand, Hervey, Fiji, Samoa, etc. (such as may also be 
found in Cambridge, Boston, and Salem), and excellent collections from Mexico. 
Africa and Asia (excepting the Ainos) are as yet scarcely represented. [There have 
since been received large collections from China.] The annual report for 1899 says, 
on i)age 18, "Our collections from Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and many of the 
South Sea Islands are very poor." 

The collections from the North Pacific coast depict the life in its different aspects. 
A group of four figures of natural size shows the domestic life of the Indians of this 
region, and at the same time the important part which the cedar plays in then- 
economy. Alongside of it the employment of natural products is represented. 
Then comes a row of cases to represent the following categories: Art and industry 
products, household utensils, travel and transportation, hunting and fishing, war, 
clothing and ornaments, trade and exchange, music, decorative art, totemism, and 
religious ideas In this row of cases are brought together the general characteristics 
of the North Pacific culture. Then follow cases sliowiug the particular cliaracteristics 
of the Tlingit, Ilaida, Tsimshian, Kwakiutl, Nutka, and the Salish tribes of British 
Colund^ia and the State of Washington. 

The collection is nnportant for an understanding of the artistic style of the Indians, 
particularly on account of the already well-explained objects from the North Pacific 
coast, for an understanding of the basket making of the States of Washington and 
California and of the style of ornaments of the Indians of the plains and western 
Mexico, etc 

Toward the close of 1899 the Mexican sculpture room was openetl, of which I have

It may be assumed with certainty that this nmseum will develop 
during the twentieth centur}' into one of the foremost natural history 
institutions of the world; and its president, Morris K. Jesup, under 
whose personal, self-saeriticing," widely influential direction it has been 
since 1881, is thereby setting up for himself a lasting monument.'^ 

</\ven an illustration in Plate II and plan on p. 335. It was described in Science, XI, 
U»00, p. 20, by F. W. Putnam, the head of the department (and also director of the 
Peabody Museum of Archeology in Cambridge, Massachusetts). He considers this the 
most important collection in existence for the study of ancient Mexican and Central 
American civilization. I present herewith an abstract of his description. 

Near the entrance the so-called "Great Turtle of Quiriqua" attracts attention. 
Beside it stands the " Dwarf," the smallest of the stehe from the ruins of Quiriqua. 
A cast of the largest of these monoliths, 2.5 feet high, is in the hall below. On the 
right of the hall is a restoration of the sanctuary of the "Temple of the Cross," 
in Palenque, showing the po.sition of the bas-relief known as the "Tablet of the 
Cross," with the officiating priests and an hieroglyphic inscription. Attached is an 
illustrated label explanatory of this temple. In the adjoining table case are several 
pieces showing hieroglyphics and figures made in stucco, which was widely used. 
The great "Calendar Stone," the most I'emarkable of ^Mexican sculptures, is on the 
south wall. On the opposite side of the hall are many tine l)as-reliefs from ruins in 
Guatemala, Honduras, Palenque, and Yucatan. Over a case at the east end of the 
hall is a group of slabs from Palenque upon which are many columns of hieroglyphs. 
Near by are casts of slabs from the ruins of Chichen Itza in Yucatan, also sculptured 
stone posts of a doorway, upon which rests a carved wooden lintel. To the right of 
this is shown the sculptured wall of a portion of a room in a temple at Chichen Itza, 
on which are many human figures and a feathered serpent. There is evidence that 
this and many of the other sculptures were formerly painted in several colors, of 
which red, yellow, and blue predominated, as, for instance, the statue of Chac-]Mools 
from Chichen Itza. 

There are also on exhibition Tarascan terra cotta figures and stone sculptures, 
original sculptures in stone from Copan and Yucatan, pottery from the ruins of Casas 
(irandes, illustrating a culture approaching that of the ancient Pue])lo people of 
Arizona and New Mexico; and also jadeite ornaments, copper implements and orna- 
ments, carved stone yokes, a large terra cotta human figure, and pottery vessels of 
many forms, all illustrative of the cultureof several of the ancient Mexican peoples. 
There are collections made by Doctor Seler in Mexico and Guatemala, and valuable 
ter.a cotta figures found in a mound at Xoxo, a cast of the inscribed stone lintel of 
the door of this tomb, and many vessels and skeletons. Finally, in a center case 
are various facsimiles of Mexican and Maya manuscripts in European collections. 
Compare also Ehrenreich's statements of the year 1898, regarding this department of 
the New York Museum in Zeitschri/t fur Etlwolocjie, 1900, pages 4-8, with three 
figures. ( See also, opening of the anthropological collection in the American Museum 
of Natural History, Science, 1900, pp. 720-722.— 1903. ) 

«In the year 1899 alone, INIr. Jesup gave $30,000 to the museum. In the course 
of almost twenty years, during which he has officiated as president, he has expended 
enormous sums on it. The Berlin (Teographical Society recently made him an 
honorary member in recognition of his services for the advancement of the sciences, 
lie is at the same time still actively engaged in the l)anking business. 

''In conclusion, let me add a few more detailed remarks: 

The orientation of the entire building would have been more favorable if its diago- 
nal had been turned on its central ])oint about 11 degrees, so that the facade, now 
completed, would face toward the southwest instead of toward the south-southwest.

2. MUSEUM OF THE BROOKLYN INSTITUTE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES. 

Brooklyn, with more than 1,250,000 inhabitants, has formed part of 
(Jreater New York since 1897. The Brooklyn Institute of Arts and 
Sciences dates from l.'^24, and received its present name in 1887. Its 
principal aim is the diffusion of knowledge by means of lectures, 
instruction, and museum collections. Its motto is from Washington's 
celebrated farewell address: . "Promote as an object of primary 

111 that cai^e the long side would be less exposed to the direct rays of the sun. It 
would then have been unnecessary constantly to protect the collections on exhibition 
by window curtains, which, umler the direct rays of the sun, change the proper color 
(»f the objects and make conditions for exhibition unsuitalile. This fact is usually 
lost sight of in connection with museum buildings, to the disadvantage of the collec- 
tions installed in them. In the case under consideration the lines of the existing 
streets Avere followed. The unconformity which would have occurred by a slight 
turning of the building could, however, have been masked by planting groups of trees 
;uid the like. The building is massive and imposing, with a rich moulding, added 
solely with a view to architectural effect. The arrangement of individual rooms 
resulting from it is in many cases unsuited. As is very often the case with muse- 
ums, this one was not built solely with reference to its needs; that is, t'onstructed 
from within outward and the outer form of the building made to conform to the inte- 
rior design. Thus, for exaiuple, the great projecting central part of the building 
darkens the iialis lying behind it; the i^rojecting towers produce inconsistency and 
irregularity in a number of the iniier rooms; the crossbars of the windows and the 
window posts are too wide, and thereby unnecessarily reduce the light in the interior; 
in certain stories the windows themselves ought to have been liigher and not extended 
down as far as the iloor, for, had this been the case, the only advantageous method 
of lighting, l)y upper side light, etc., would have been secured. 

The proportions of length, breadth, and height of some halls, and the width of the 
spaces between windows in relation to the width of the windows, are often extremely 
well worked out, so that indiviilual portions of the museum, rather than the whole 
building, make the best impression. 

The furniture, cases, and desks are of wood, with heavy fraiiiew(U-k, generally with 
many crossbars and relatively small panes, and they are not dii.st proof, except in the 
large show cases without doors. It is the more astonishing that they have not intro- 
duced iron t-ases, such as are to be found in many European museums, since .\merica 
is far in advance of Europe in fitting out libraries and archives with iron furniture, and 
understands how to install it in a niore jierfect manner than we have yet attained. 
Objection may also be made to the dimensions and to the ])eculiar shape and the 
position of many of the cases with regard to the source of liglit. Too little regard 
has been paid to the architecture in its bearings upon the lighting arrangements; 
thus several of the fine large groups of animals (the bisons, among others) are con- 
siderably injured by reflections from the glass panes, which are distributed carelessly 
without consideration of the source of light. This, however, could easily be remedied. 
For the sizes of the cases and their distribution, it would have been more advantageous 
if the iron-supporting columns had stood farther toward the middle of the halls. 
These columns also run directly into the ceiling. The richly ornaniented capitals 
in some halls do not harmonize with the prevailing simplicity of the interior decora- 
tions which in a great degree are worthy of imitation, except that in some of the 
older ])arts of tlui building they are too rough. 

I have already mentioned that the lumiber of scientific workers employed iii this 
nm.seum, which is advancing with giant strides, is entirely inadeijiiate. The mass

importance institutions for the increase and ditlusion of knowlcdj^e.*' 
The society which composes the institute has about 0,000 members," 
who pay $5 entrance fee and annual dues, and is divided into 27 
scientific and artistic sections, which meet in different buiidinos. At 
the head is a president with a board of 52 trustees and 11 different 
committees. The members also are organized into a council and 8 
committees. The whole establishment is under the nominal control of 
the University of the State of New York (see under Albany). It 

of material which is continually flowing in from the many expeditions, donations, 
and purchases, can not he j)roperly attended to nor scientifically treated. The 
enijiloyees are therefore overburdened, m\ evil which 1 encountered in many of the 
American museums. Their outward splendors are out of proportion to the number 
and position of the scientists employed in them. The relatively small salaries usual in 
the United States, the instability of the positions (even under political influence), 
and the absence of the pension system contrast unfavorably with the conditions pre- 
vailintr iu Europe, where museums are better regulated and the positions more secure, 
and are more in consonance with the principles of fairness. Certainly museum 
employees do not command the same respect and enjoy the same rights in the Union 
as in the Old World. The employee is at a disadvantage against the influential 
powers who furnish to the museums the means of existence, is too nmch dependent 
upon them, and too nmch restrained in his rights. So much the more worthy of 
unstinted admiration are the idealism and the splendid achievements of many scien- 
tific men working under unfavorable conditions. 

The lack of a central expert administration m the New York ^luseum [a director 
has since been nominated. — 1903] is evident from the fact that all possible colors of 
l>ackgrounds and labels are met with, as well as greatly varied methods of mounting, 
which are by no means all worthy of imitation. 

The animal groups are excellently mounted. The accessories of leaves and flowers 
are carefully cast in wax and consecpiently transparent and very true to nature, but 
somewhat obtrusive. There is too muchof this good work, for the attention is diverted 
from the object of the exhibition. 

Tiie manner of preserving the great skin collection in single tin boxes, with light 
traj's of wood and ])asteboard piled high one upon another, is inconvenient in the 
narrow rooms in which they are kept, although these boxes, whose lids can betaken 
I iff or tightly fastened with bolts, may in themselves be very practical. These travs 
are disinfected with bisulphide of carbon, which must often be renewed, and can be 
neither agreeable nor wholesome for the employees. 

The butterflies of the exhibition collection are displayed in desks in a peculiar 
way, each specimen in a little pasteboard box by itself, covered with glass, on a thin 
gypsum plate adapted to its form — an arrangement which requires much si)ace and 
produces, on the whole, a monotonous effect, however pretty each specimen may 
look. On page 32 of the Animal Report. for 1899 there is an illustration of such a 
clumsy l>utterfly case. The makers of this method of preparation, Denton Brothers, 
of Wellesley, Mass., received at the Paris Exposition of 1900, a gold medal for their 
"collection and preservation of butterflies." 

I ,do not, liowever, wish to be misunder.«tood. The American .Museum of Natural 
History offers .something (piite extraordinary and stands relatively upon a very high 
plane, .«o that one not only may, but willingly does, overlook minor defects. Besides, 
what mnseuin can be called faultless. I am convinced that this magniflcently 
founded institution, ni its further development, will in every respect be worth 
imitating.

inaintaiiis also a biological laboratory on the seashore, with 12 employ- 
ees, as well as a larger museum for children in Bedford Park, the 
latter with 8 employees, one of whom is a naturalist." The art build- 
ing on Montague street, worth about $125,000, stands financially and 
otherwise in close relation to the institute. The library includes 
27,000 volumes. From June 1, 1898, to May 31, 1899, 3,80H meetings 
were held, including lectures, demonstrations, and class reunions, 
which were attended by over 360,000 persons. The Institute has an

« The museum for children is designed for young people from 6 to 20 years of age, 
and includes all human endeavors and interests, so far as they are comprehensive for 
youth or can serve for their education. The objects cho.«en all bear a detinite rela-

of models, animals, plants, anatomical preparations and meteorological instruments, 
as well as a lecture loom wliich will accommodate 40. On the first floor are the 
library and administration rooms. The rooms are prettily decorated, and the cases 
are low enough to enaV)le children to see everything .\ell. Many things are here 
brought together which are of interest also to grown persons. I may mention a 
so-called type collection, such as is used in elementary schools in France. It con-

The cost of building and furnisliing is borne by the city. Though 
not quite as large as the Natural History Museum in New York, it is 
planned on a great scale. The building ground is at the southwestern

partly-wild park of the same name, where 12 acres of land (750 l>y 725 
feet) are resei'ved by the city for the museum. The collections com-

den. It will have four covered courts and three .storie.s, exclusive of 
the basement, and in the central axis a fourth floor, the upper stories

The foundation was laid in 1895, and in 1897 the first portion, the 
right wing of the north section, was completed (with exception of the 
statues of the chief frieze). This wing is 193 feet long, 43 by 64 feet 
wide, and 95 feet high (above ground). It is fireproof throughout, 
excepting a few wooden window frames on the ground floor (all others 
of iron), and a few oaken doors. The floors are supported by iron

vklual sections with tlicir suhordiiuitcs. The workino' hours nve from 
9 to 6 on week days and the afternoon of Sunday; there is a weekly 
half holiday. The number of visitors in 1898-99 was about 93,000. 
Admission is free on Wednesday, Thursday, Frida}', Saturday, and 
Sunday, even when these are holidays; on Wednesday and Saturday 
from 9 to 6; Thursday and Friday from 7.30 a. m. to 7.45 p. ni., and 
Sunday from 2 to 6 p. m. On IVIonday and Tuesday from 9 to there 
is an admission fee of 25 cents; children under !(> years, 10 cents, and 
children under 14 years are only admitted when accompanied b}^ a 
grown person. LTmbrellas and canes are checked free, voluntary gifts 
for this service not being customary. The Institute publishes an 
illustrated Yearbook (the eleventh for 1898-99 has 422 pages), as well 
as an annual prospectus, which contains reliable information regard- 
ing the lectures, demonstrations, and instruction. The prospectus for 
1899-1900 contained 181 pages. The museum has as 3'et published 
only one catalogue of paintings (in two editions, 1898 and 1900), and 
an illustrated catalogue of the Goodj^ear collection of photographs of 
Italian architecture and sculpture (1896), which were taken on one 
of the museum expeditions (1895)." Other scientific expeditions are 
projected. 

The distribution of space and the lighting of the portion of the 
building now^ standing are excellent.'' As in the Natural History 
Museum in New York, the halls are almost without ornament. The 
walls and ceilings are white or of a uniform color, the lobbies and 
staircase light gray. This deserves special mention because the 
collections of so many museums, at least in Europe, are rather 
injured than benetit^d l)y too much decoration, or ])y the style of the 
decoration of the galleries. The engines for heating, ventilating, 
lighting, and electric power are located in the basement, and cause a 
shaking in certain portions of the building. The steam radiators 
are placed mostly under the windows or near them. A hot-air plant, 
besides, run by the steam engine, heats all the halls through openings 
about two-thirds above the floors. Ventilation is accomplished by 
means of an electric ventilator in the roof, but this does not seem 
free from objections. The problem is seldom well solved in large 
buildings. In the axis of a well-lighted, spacious, spiral staircase 
(iron steps overlaid with slate) an electric elevator runs to the roof, 
from which, on account of the high situation of the building, ma}- be 
enjoyed a fine, extensive view, with the Botanical Gardens and Pros- 
pect Park in the foreground. The basement is 25 feet high and con-

The first story is devoted to sculpture. The great hall, where are 
found Greek and Roman statuary, is excellently lighted from the 
north side by means of upper side windows. The white casts are 
tastefully mounted on dark green pedestals against a light olive-green 
background. The ceiling is white, the window frames are a very 
light ocher, and the floor is gray mosaic, as are the other floors. The 
south side consists of a solid wall without windows, on the upper part 
of which the Parthenon frieze is displayed. Comfortable benches

G. Semper, are nearly 50 feet high; they are, in fact, much too high, and the sky-

invite the visitor to prolong his stay. In tiiis section is tiie inagniti- 
cent collection of Italian photographs of Professor Good3'ear. 

The second floor is devoted to natural history and prehistoric objects 
with special reference to America. The large hall is lighted excel- 
lently from l)oth sides except when the sun shines in from the south. 
The cases stand at right angles to the wall spaces between the windows, 
by which the liest possil)le etfect of lighting is attained. The walls 
are cream colored, the ceiling white, and the window frames ocher. " 

The paintings are on the third floor (lighted from above), most of 
them provisionally loaned. The great gallery is not yet ovortilled, 
and is furnished with comfortable benches. The walls are light 
Pompeian red, the ceiling white. Picture galleries are seldom seen in 
which the examination of the works of art are so little disturbed by 
the surroundings. The collection is, for an American collection, rich 
in landscapes of the seventeenth century and other works of the old 
masters, as also in pictures of the French school of 1S30. I give in 
alphal)etical order the names of the artists who are represented by 
luore noteworthy paintings: Corot (4), Cortese (2), Courbet (3), Cuj^p, 
Daubigny (8), Decamps (3), Diaz (5), Dupre (3), P^tty (2), Fyt, (Gains- 
borough (2), (xericault (2), V. (loj^en (2), Hals, Hobbema, Lorrain, 
Mariliiat, ,]. Maris (3), W. Maris (2), Mauve (7), Metsu, Michel (3), 
V. Mieris, Millet, Morland (3), Pannini (3), Rembrandt, De Reyn, 
Rosa (3), Rousseau (3), Ryckaert, Stork,. J. Vernet (3), Vollon (2), 
Wilkie, AVilson (3). 

The collections, noteworthy as they alread}^ are, may still be regarded 
merely as a beginning of nuich greater achievements. One might well 
wish to live to see the completion of the entire building, since it 
promises to be a highly creditable accomplishment, and the devotion 
of the citizens of this rich city guarantees that the nuiseum will not 
lack good collections.

In a building where everything is fireproof — which even has iron window frames, 
something very hard to find anywhere else — it is strange that the kindred idea of 
introducing iron furniture did not occur to the builders. 

The collection is still une(iually developed. We may make special mention of tlie 
butterfly collection of nearly 100,000 specimens, with more than 1,200 types (the 
Dresden Museum has about 40,000 specimens, includhig about 8,000 species). No

end, of I'urnishino- popular instriu-tion and locreation,"" the Metropoli- 
tan Museum ot" Art has been planned, to occupy several detached 
buildinys covering more than 18 acres of ground in Central Park, 
about half a mile from the Natural History Museum. Up to the 
])i'(\sent one building has been completed." It is 3-i5 feet long, 3'25 
feet wide, and between 1876 and 1898 was erected in four sections 
by the elder Hunt on sloping, and, partly for that reason, deep-lying 
ground. It has four courts, a cellar, ground floor, and one additional 
story, and is constructed of red brick with gray granite trimmings, 
which looks very attractive, particularl}^ in summer when the park is 
o-reen. The older portion is in Italian gothic, the newer in renaissance 
style. The principal entrance is on one of the narrow sides. The cost 
amounts to |500,000, with $65,000 additional for interior furnishings 
and $90,000 for the power house. There is, besides, an imposing tire- 
proof building of gray sandstone in the best renaissance style, 305 feet 
long, 103 feet wide, and 88 feet high, connected with the former on its 
rear side l)y a middle wing 107 feet long and i'A feet wide. This build- 
ing was not tinished, however, at the time of my visit.* The architect 
of the new building is the younger Hunt. It cost $1,000,000; the 
interior furnishings and the power house $220,000 additional. The 
city donated the ground and also, by authority of the government 
of the Stat(>. of New York at Albany, bears the cost of building and 
makes an aimual appropriation of $100,000 for the running expenses. 
These amount to about $130,000, of which $90,000 go for salaries and 
wages. The balance is paid l)y the corporation that founded the 
museum in 1870, from the interest on its funds, which amount to 
$580,00(>,'' and from private donations and special sources of income, 
such as annual dues (about $20,000 from 2,000 members at $10), 
entrance fees (on two days of the week, $5,000), sales of catalogues 
($3,000), etc. 

Until 1879 the collections were stored, one after another, in two 
private houses. Patrons gave, and continue to give, the means fcM- 
purchases, and donations and bequests were received in such profusion 
that the large halls of the present museum, comprising together 
almost 3f acres of space, were overcrowded after the first twenty 
years. They are now relieved by the removal of a portion of their 
contents to the new building, and the great hall of the latter is to be 
devoted specially to sculpture. The library has over 6,000 volumes. 
The value of the collections is estimated at more than $9,000,000. The 
l)uilding is open on week days from 10 to 6, Monday and Friday for 
nonm<nubers at an admission fee of 25 cents; also on these two days

tors in 181>y was 540,000, of whom about 200,000 came on Sundays. 
P^ntire schools of 300 pupils often come and spend the whole da}' in

The center of the building- is occupied by a hirge hall with skylight 
and galleries. In itn four corners are somewhat narrow and steep 
wooden staircases, running to the second floor and to the cellar. In 
the latter are located a restaurant, and other conveniences. In the 
halls of the ground floor the windows are placed so high that cases 
can stand against the walls beneath them, an arrangement that looks 
well, but which does not appear everywhere to answer the purpose on 
account of the reflections and the deflcienc}^ of light. The floor is of 
white marble. Almost the whole second story is unsatisfactoril}^ 
lighted by skylights, and in the picture galleries the light is further 
impaired by the plate glass, with which all the pictures are cov^ered. 
The floor is made of parquetry, with an underlayer of cement one foot 
thick in the picture galleries as a protection against fire. In the sum- 
mer the ventilation seemed insuflicient. All the rooms can be lighted 
by electricity. The heating is by steam. The power house is located 
in a separate l)uilding. 

In the middle hall is displa3'ed a collection of casts and models of 
antitjue and medit\?val architecture — among them, on a large scale, the 
Pantheon, Parthenon. Temple of Karnak, Notre Dame (this model cost 
^20.000), Guild of the Butchers' House in Hildesheim, and many others, 
mostly with single parts of natural size beside them, and in every case 
])h()tographs of the whole. In the other halls of the ground floor the 
collections from the Cyprian excavations are specially important. 
These demonstrate the Oriental influence on Gneco-Roman art in 
vases, terra cottas, glasses, g?'eat stone sculptures, bronzes, etc. This 
most complete provincial collection shows in series the transitions from 
the prehistoric time, 1,2(>0 years B. C. and earlier, to the Koman and 
Christian period of the fifth century, and is consequently very instruct- 
ive. It cost $<)O,(»00. A precious collection of glasses from the most 
reniote times to the present also deserve particidar mention. 

On the second floor the modern portion of the picture gallery is 
first to claim the attention. A collection of e<[ual value is not to be 
found in Europe. Only the following names need be mentioned: 
The two Achenbachs, Bastien-Lepage, Benjamin-Constant, Rosa Bon- 
heur (Horse Market — which cost $60,000 and was a gift to the 
Museum — and others), Bonnat, Bouguereau, Breton, Cabanel, Corot, 
Courbet, Couture, Defregger, Detaille (Defense of Champigny and 
others), Diaz, Gainsborough, Gallait, Gerome, Hel)ert, Henner, Isa- 
bey, Israels, the two Kaulbachs, Knaus, Leighton, Makart, Manet, 
Max, Meissonier (Friedland 1807— which cost $69,000 and was a 
gift to the Museum — and others), Menzel, Millet, Munkacsy, Piloty, 
Re3'nolds, Richter, Sargent, Schefier, Stevens, Troyon, Turner,

classitiod l)y the .schools of art represented because individual collections 
must remain intact in accordance with testamentary provisions. The 
systematic arranj^^ement of such collections is rig-htly considered as of 
less importance than their acquisition. Frequently, also, larj>-e sums 
are beciueathed for their preservation. In the other halls of the 
second story may also be noted the great collection of nnisical instru- 
ments of all peoples and periods (concerning which a profusely illus- 
trated work by M. E. and W. A. Brown appeared in 1888),«' the 
ceramic collection, particularly from China and Japan, as also the 
C^'prian g-old ornaments on exhibition in a room, which includes only 
precious articles of every kind.

of volumes of photographs without exposing them to injury, should 
])e mentioned. The books lie in glass desks, and when one wishes to 
turn over the separate leaves it is necessary to reach through an opening

The value of this Museum (I have only laid stress upon a portion of 
it) is. notwithstanding its vouth, very great, and its further develop- 
ment will be still more remarkable, as more objects of art are constantly

history of Europe and Asia, the collection.s of the United States may 
not in the future be overlooked.* -

4. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY— ASTOR, LENOX, AND TILDEN 

FOUNDATIONS. 

This library orit^inated in 1895 by combining the Astor Library, 
which was founded in 1849 and opened In 1854, and the Lenox 
Librar}', which was founded in 1870 and opened in 1878, with the 
IMlden bequest (1887) of $2,100,000 and 20,000 volumes for a pul)lic 
library. From plans drawn by Carre re and Hastings there is now 
being erected in the best part of the city (Fifth avenue) a magnificent, 
monumental building, which is to be completed in about four years, 
:it a cost of $2,000,000 to be paid by the city through authority of 
the government of the State of New York in AUtany. Five hundred 
thousand dollars were made av^ailable for the purpose in 1899 as a first 
instalment. As the two libraries named will soon disappear as such, 
only a few remarks concerning them will suttice. 

The Astor Library, in Lafayette place, near the busiest portion of 
the principal street (Broadway), is supported by the bequests and 
donations of the Astor family, amounting to ^1,750,00(1. It is located 
in a two-story (in the middle portion three-stor}') building of red brick 
in Romanes(|ue style, 200 feet long and 100 feet wide, which was l)uilt 
in three sections ))etween 1853 and 1881. The Tilden Library is also 
installed here. Th(> li])rary consists of al)out 350,000 volumes, most 
of them of rather a general character, and 100,000 pamphlets, l>esides 
incunabula, manuscripts, and autographs. One peculiarity is note- 
worthy, that the Itooks, arranged on the shelves according to subjects, 
are. accessible to the public with certain limitations; but at present this 



especially on account of the arched eeilin":, like that of a railroad staticiii, which is 
iKit relieved by the ileeorations. The unsystematic arraiijrenient and the incomplete- 
ness of the collections is fully explained by their newness. C'onsiderin<r the magniti- 
ci'iice of the collections it would be ungracious to dwell upon their faults, particularly 
as these ol)jectional)le conditions are iijiproving from day to day. 1 mention the lack 
of good arrangement because it may ]iartly be explained from tlie fact that many gifts 
have to be accepted and placed on exhibition in order not to lose [)atronage — an evil 
which is met with in many American museums. Such elements as do not tit in a col- 
lection can only be culled out after the lapse of many years. 

The importance of the comprehensive and celebrated Cyprian collection can not 
be fully appreciated on account of its unscientific arrangement. The Hnds are sep- 
arated (they pnjbably were never kept together) and there exists no chronological 
sequence at all. The Oriental, Grecian, and Cyprian types in the vases, terra cottas, 
glasses, and stone sculptures are everywhere mixed together. Unfortunately no 
information whatever is given the visitor by labels. I le does not get much more from 
the handbotJvs, since these are limited to brief descriptions. They are, indeed, 
w elcome but not sufficient for an understanding of such objects, (^ne must, there- 
fore, regret not being able to derive the full benefit from this tine collection, even 
after several visits, which it should be capable of affording. The unsystematic 
arrangement of the collection is also particularly striking in the room on the second 
story devoted to pre<'ious ornaments. On the other hand, care has been bestowed 
upon harmony of arrangement in the entire museum, so that the general impiessi«in 
l)rodnce(I is one of pleasure and grandeur.

The Lenox Library occupies a detached position in the best part of 
the city on Fifth avenue opposite Central Park. It contains also col- 
lections of different sorts. It is of two stories, fireproof, of white 
sandstone, with two one-story wings projecting at right angles. In 
the style of the Ecole des Beaux Arts, it is recognized as one of the 
best specimens of later Pari.sian architecture, being of imposing 
appearance within and without, with the exception of the great cov- 
ered steps leading to the entrance. The l)ook stacks are of iron.

a small collection of statuary and prints; and, finally, some minerals,

museum was 34,000." 

The Lenox Library pul)lished or printed between 1879 and 1893, 
seven Contributions to a Catalogue of the following contents: The 
Hulsius collections of voyages; the Jesuit relations; the voyages of 
Thevenot; the Bunyan, Shakespeare, Milton, and Walton collections; 
also the letter of Columbus on the discovery of America (1-492), as 
well as catalogues of paintings of the Lenox and Stuart collections, 
and twelve short title lists. 

The new library, which cml)races the two justdescribed and the Lenox 
collection, and has ))een administered as the new library since 1896, is 
controlled b}' a director, under a board of trustees of 21 members, 
with a president at its head, and also 5 committees, nominally con- 
trolled by the l^niversity of the State of New York. (See Albany.) 
All the following applies to the Astor, Lenox, and Tilden libraries 
together. The New York Public Library will soon be increased by a 
great distribution section, which will include all the public libraries 
belonging to the city. New York has too long been without such a 
central library. More than 600,000 books and pamphlets are now 
accessible and about 7.5,000 are not yet installed.'' In 1899 more than 
115,000 readers called for over 500,000 volumes, without including 
the reference library — an average of 347 readers daily. In the year 
named the extraordinarily large increase of almost 165,000 volumes 
and pamphlets was recorded. The average annual increase is now 
estimated at over 50,000 numbers; 3,925 periodicals were received,'" of 
which 1,207 were American and 909 German; 819 of these were dona- 
tions. There were 148,000 parts of periodicals consulted during last 
year, an average of more than 500 daily.'' The annual increase 
amounts to 6,400 numbers, including 48 dailies, 543 weeklies, 1,075 
monthly and 580 yearly papers.' All of these are purchased. In 1899 
more than 91,000 volumes and pamphlets were catalogued on 225,000 
cards. The catalogue of the reading room, accessible to all, contains 

"New York has three public picture galleries: Those of the Metropolitan Museum, 
Brooklyn Institute, and Lenox Library. Of prominent private galleries I may 
mention those of (". T. Yerkes, II. O. Havemeyer, (t. AV. Vanderbilt, U. (Jouhl,

''In 1902 there were 777,768 books and pamphlets in the library. The Berlin 
Library has over 1,000,000 volumes and manuscripts, the Paris Library nearly 
3,000,000, the British JNIuseum from 4,000,000 to 5,000,000.

iiio'the inclination of the Americans towanl <;reatness, it need scarcely 
be said that the new buildini^" has been planned on a corresponding- scale. 
It is about 350 feet long, 250 feet wide, 6^ feet high in front, 98 feet 
in the rear (that is, about the size of the (lei'iuan Reichstag ])uilding), 
with two open courts, each 81 feet square. It consists of three stories 
and a basement, connected with one another by elevators and stairs. 
It is tireproof throughout. This library differs from many others in 
not having the main reading room situated centrally in a loft}', 
spacious hall, as is generally the case, but in the back part of the 
topmost story, occupying, in several sections, almost the entire length 
of the building." It is also noteworthy })y having the iron book- 
stacks, seven stories high, located imder this main reading room, 
beginning in the basement. They are 270 feet long, 72 feet wide, 
and altogether 53 feet high, afl'ording space for 1,250,000 volumes, 
while another quarter of a million can be provided for elsewhere. 
The deliver}^ desk for these is located in the middle of the main 
reading rooms, connected with the underhung bookstacks by means 
of book lifts. The rooms for lending books outside of the building- 
are situated in one of the courts in the basement and groimd floor. 
A possible extension of the library to a capacit}' for 5,000,000 volumes 
is provided for by the park hang behind the building. There will be 
about 800 seats in the main reading room, besides a))out six special 
study rooms in the third story and seats in the special libraries (Gov- 
ernment publications. Oriental literature, sociology and political econ- 
omy, mathematics, i:)hysics, chemistry, maps, music, Bibles). There is 
also a reading room for children and a newspaper and periodical room 
in the second stoiy. The whole manuscript section is as a safe for 
itself. The power plant will be located outside of the building. The 
other details may be seen in the ground plans. 

The land, buildings, and books of the united libraries are worth 
about $3,600,000. There is, besides, an invested fund of $3,000,000, 
yielding $125,000 interest, seven-eighths of which is applied to 
administrative purposes. After the completion of the new building, 
however, ample provision will be made by the city for running 
expenses.'' 

There can })e no doubt that the New York Public Lil)rary, under the 
administration of Dr. John S. Bilhngs, who has been director since 
ISIM), will become a model institution, and, supported by the liberality 
of the rich New Yorkers, it will be a magnificent ornament to the 
great city. 

«This is also the case in the Chicago Public Library. 

^ Since Mr. Carnegie has, in 1901, presented $5,200,000 for 65 branch libraries in 
New York, the task of the {)nblic library has been enornionsly increased, as they are 
all to be under the administration of the New York Public Library. Already, in 
1902, 2,000,000 hooks were in circulation for home use from 17 branch lilnaries. 



358 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSP^UM, 1903. 

5. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. 

The founding of King's College by royal patent of George II dates 
back to 1754 — before the Declaration of Independence of the United 
States of America, in 1776; therefore the university is one of the 
oldest organizations in New York. In 1897 it was removed to Morn- 
ingside Heights, in the northern part of the city, between One hun- 
dred and sixteenth and One hundred and twentieth streets and Tenth 
and Eleventh avenues, except that the medical faculty (College of 
Physicians and Surgeons, founded in 1807), and incorporated in 1891, 
remained in its three buildings in Fifty-ninth street, 3 miles away where 
it had in 1887 acquired model new buildings and furnishings, pro- 
vided almost entirely by the Vanderbilt family at a cost of $2,500,000, 
among them an anatomical laboratory for 400 students, a model of its 
kind. I here treat only of the new university, which was erected in a 
uniform style from maturely considered plans, and, besides many 
other advantages, already before completion, possesses two especial 
attractions — the power house and the library. The university occu- 
pies its third location since it was founded as King's College, almost 
one hundred and fifty years ago, and the medical faculty its sixth. 
This frequent removal might at first sight appear to be a disadvan- 
tage, but has in fact proven to l)e a great advantage, because, pushed 
farther and farther outward by the growth of the cit}^, the new build- 
ings could in their new locality always be made to conform to the 
altered conditions, whereas elsewhere such new buildings can gener- 
ally be acquired only after long periods. 

The university occupies an isolated position on an eleyated tract, 
where presumably it will suffice the wants of the next generations, and 
even after the adjacent portions of the city are more closely built up, 
it will still occupy a comparatively open position, not in direct contact 
with the city's noise and traftic. It occupies historical ground, as a bat- 
tle was fought there in 1776 during the war of the Revolution against 
England. In 1812, also, fortifications were erected here during the sec- 
ond war with England. After 1825 an insane asylum occupied the site. 
In 1892, at a cost of $2,100,000, an area of 16i acres was acquired by the 
university on this rocky hill for a new site. The nature of the ground 
admitted of making a plateau 750 l)y 575 feet — that is, somewhat more 
than three-fifths of the entire tract — 150 feet above the near-by Hud- 
son, and 25 feet above the streets; in size a})Out the same as the Dres- 
den "Zwinger,"''' with its surrounding gardens. It is, therefore, not so 
very large and is smaller than the site of the Natural History Museum, 
2 miles away. In 1893 the university purchased at the Chicago 
World's Fair for $3,500 the university plans sent there by the Prussian 
educational department, which now hang on the walls of the architec- 
tural section of the libraiy; and in 1894 it accepted the building plan

sity. A liandsoiiio model of Uuivor.sitv Hall is exhibited in the Met- 
ropolitan Museum of Ai't, a mile and a half away. Only the front 
part of the hall rests on the plateau itself, the main portion of the 
building extending- along the back slope of the plateau, which has a 
steep descent of 88 feet, so that in the rear the structure rises to an 
imposing height of ISO feet, while in front it is <i9 feet high. These 
lower-lying portions of the site, affording a park-like green with 
old trees, are to be inclosed by four doi-mitories." The buildings are 
69 feet high, the outer ones having four stories and two basements, 
which is made possible by the sloping nature of the ground. 

Four of the great outlying buildings for lecture rooms, laboratories, 
and collections are completed; also the library and the power plant of 
the universit}' hall, and the gymnasium with its l)aths. The foundation, 
stairs, balustrades and the like are of granite; the librar}- is of white 
sandstone; everything else is of red-brick construction with sandstone 
trimmings. The walks are paved with red brick. The whole makes 
an imposing as well as an agreeable impression, gay in summer from 
the green color of lofty trees and grass plats. Ever^'thing is fireproof; 
the framework is of iron; the tioors, walls, and roofs are of hollow 
brick; the stairs are of stone or of iron and stone. The iron pillars 
rest in sheet-iron sockets, which are tilled with loose asbestos. The 
doors and window frames are of wood; the windows are of plate glass. 
Everything is done according to the expressed principle that the best 
is not too good and is in the end the cheapest. 

The buildings hitherto erected cost $4:, 250, GOO;'' those yet to be put 
up will require $5,500,000. The total cost of the university build- 
ings will amount to $15,000,000,'' and they will accommodate 6,000 
students and 600 teachers. Already the aggregation of buildings — 
Columbia University, National Academy of Design, Grant Mausoleum, 
St. Luke's Hospital, and St. John's Cathedral— splendidly situated on 
the high bank of the Hudson in the midst of caref ulh^ tended parks, is 
regarded as the future ''Acropolis of the New World." 

Columbia is exclusively an endowed university, and although it has 
the authorization of the State of New York for its founding, it has 
never received a State appropriation. That such a considerable sum 
for a universit}' can be raised entirely l)y private subscription is char- 
acteristic of Americans and is an argument for the social justitica- 

«See illustrations in Columbia University Quarterly, I, 1899, p. 149. Two five-story 
buildings are i)laiino(l 156 feet in tength, and two 200 feet in length and 40 feet 
wide, which will accommodate altogether about 450 students, and will cost about 
$750,000. 

&An exact statement of the cost maybe found in the report of the president of 
October 3, 1898, re])rinted in report of the Commissioner of Education, 1897-98, II,

tion of their provorhiiil vvejilth." In America tlic oblioatioiis imposed 
by the position of wealth are well discharged. Colum})ia is governed 
privately by self -chosen trustees, and is only nominally subject to the 
control of the regents of the University of the State of New York in 
Albany. It now has an annual income of $400,000 from its endow- 
ment of $12,000,000, and tuition fees amounting to $375,000. Its 
current expenses amounted in 1899 to $837,500'^; such a deficit of 
$62,000 is, however, of no consequence, since persons are always 
found who make it good. Nor is a momentary debt of $3,000,000 
very oppressive, as it will soon be paid. In 1899 a number of bene- 
factors together contributed $75,000 for current expenses alone and 
$500,000 for endowment funds, besides a hospital worth over $500,000 
with an endowment of $375,000. The current annual expenses of the 
University of Berlin amount to $750,000; those of the University of 
Leipzig, $625,000, of which $500,000 are appropriated by the Royal 
Saxon Government. The city of New York, with its 4.000,000 popu- 
lation, has about the same number of inhabitants as the Kingdom of 

« I cite only a few of the great university endowments. The dates given in paren- 
theses indicate the year of founding of the universities mentioned. The Stanford 
family gave $30,000,000 (1891 ) ; Johns Hopkins (1867), $3,750,000; J. G. Clark (1887), 
$3,000,000; W. C. de Pauvv (1837) and J. B. Colgate (1819), $1,500,000 each; J. N. 
and II. Brown (1764), $750,000 each for the university bearing the name of these 
founders; J. D. Rockefeller (1866), $10,000,000 for Chicago; 8. Cupples and K. S. 
Brookings (1900), $5,000,000 for Washington in St. Louis; the Vanderbilt family, 
$3,750,000 for Vanderbilt University (1872) and Columbia, in New York; J. Rich 
and A. Packer, $2,000,000 each for Boston (1869) and Lehigh, in South Bethlehem 
(1866); J. C. Green, $1,750,000 for Princeton (1746) ; Seth Low and J. Loubat, 
$1,500,000 and $1,250,000, respectively, for Columbia (this university received in the 
last ten years endowments amounting altogether to $7,000,000); E. Cornell, H. W. 
Sage, and O. H. Payne, $3,500,000 for Cornell (1865); J. Lick, $750,000 for Berkeley 
(1868). Yale, in New Haven (1701), received $5,000,000 from different donors; 
Wesleyan University, in Middletown (1831), $2,000,000; Cincinnati (1819), $1,500,000; 
Harvard, in Cambridge (1636), receives on an average $1,000,000 to $1,250,000 every 
year (last year $1,625,000), etc. G. Peabody gave $6,000,000 for various scientific 
institutions; D. B. Fayerweather, $5,250,000. This makes a total of between 
$100,000,000 and $125,000,000, and yet is only a fraction of such gifts for universities 
and scientific institutions, as may be seen from the list given in the New York 
World Almanac, 1900, p. 310. In the year 1899 alone about $75,000,000 were 
donated for universities, colleges, schools, and libraries. E. D. Perry (Education 
in the United States, edited by N. M. Butler, Albany, 1900, p. 304) says: "It is 
truly encouraging for the future of education in America that so many of her mil- 
lionaires are willing to give freely of the fortunes that they have accumulated, and 
that those who give the most should set the example of intrusting the application of 
the funds to those who best understand the needs to be inet." [The above lists 
were made up in 1900, but would be considerably enlarged to-day. Mr. Carnegie 
alone has given away $100,000,000.] 

^'These figures are only approximate. I may mention for comparison that the 
annual current expenses of Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, amount to 
only $200,000. 



362 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Saxony. Loip.sic has 3,500 students, Columbia University about 4,000, 
of whom, however, only about 2,000 correspond to our students. 
These remarks are merely thrown in without any desire to compare 
the two universities. 

There is an extraordinary ditt'erence amonj^ American universities. 
About twelve or fifteen correspond to our twenty-one German uni- 
versities, and even these can not be compared without hesitation, 
because they combine with the university to a greater or lesser degree 
some of our ""gymnasium" classes, and stand, moreover, upon quite 
different stages of development. Almost every American university 
has a college," which in its first two or three years corresponds some- 
what to our "obersecunda" and "prima," and only in its last years 
to the first year of our universities. On leaving college the student, 
after passing an examination, receives a degree of bachelor of arts, or 
the like, and, if he so chooses, then enters the university proper, which 
is organized into faculties ('^schools") as among us. The individual 
who leaves college in order to begin his life work possesses, therefore, 
a higher education than our young men who leave the gymnasium for 
the university. After attending the university for two years the 
student obtains the degree of master of arts, or the like, and after one 
or more additional years of study, the degree of doctor. The students 
at American universities nre accordingly divided into undergraduates 
(in the college), graduates or postgraduates (university students in the 
more restricted sense), and special students. The latter are either 
nongraduates or persons who, after completing their college course, 
pursue no regular faculty studies, but inmiediately apply themselves 
to special studies, which lie without the scholastic organization. The 
American student is permitted to pursue special studies earlier than 
the German student, and the students in general have a relatively free 
choice of their lectures, as in the German universities, which is 
also already more or less the case toward the close of the collegiate 
course. 

A person thoroughly acquainted with German and American uni- 
versities. Prof. H. Miinsterberg, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, once 
declared {Der Western, Chicago, December 3, 18!;>3), with regard to 
Harvard, that the examination for the degree of doctor of philosophy 
as the last period of the graduate school (that is, the philosophical 
facult}') represents a stage of scientific maturity far above the level of 
the average German doctor; that the examination for doctor in Har- 
vard was more like the German examination, which admits the .young 
scholar to the office of an academical teacher ("Priv^atdocent"), than 

" Lately students have been admitted to Columbia without knowledge of the Latin 
language, so that there the rudiments are also taught. 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 363 

like the German oxaiuination for the degree of doctor." Tliis (Mjuality 
with (Terinan universities applies, however, only to a very small i)i-o- 
portion of the 150 Ameriean s(;holastic institutions that call them- 
selves universities, to say nothing- of the 350 eoUeges.'^ Besides 
Harvard in Cambridge it may perhaps apply to the following: Chi- 
cago, Columbia in New York, Yale in New Haven, Cornell in Ithaca, 
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Michigan in Ann Arbor. Wisconsin in 
Madison, California in Berkeley, and Stanford in California. Johns 
Hopkins in Baltimore has virtually dispensed w ith a "gymnasium "-like 
collegiate preparation, and consequently most nearl}^ resembles a 
German university^ to imitate whose organization an avowed tendency 
exists in many Ameriean universities. Princeton, indeed, possesses a 
college, but only a philosophical and theological faculty. The twelve 
here mentioned (Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Yale, Columbia, Cornell, 
Chicago, Stanford, California, Princeton, Michigan, Wisconsin, and 
Pennsylvania) have quite recently formed a closer union. Clark Uni- 
versity in Worcester comprises a philosophical faculty with 11 teachers 
and 3-1: students (1900), and recognizes the pursuit of science as its iirst 
object, with teaching as somewhat subordinate.'" Thus ever}' one of 
the American universities ought to be especially characterized. We 
can not in general speak of the universities of the United States as we 
do of the German universities. These matters are known to every 
educated American, and nothing is more preposterous than to look at 
all of these universities of the Union as alike. I must let the matter 
rest here with these few general remarks, but refer the reader partic- 
ularly to the chapter The American University in the work entitled 
Education in the United States, edited by N. M. Butler, Albany, 
J. B. Lyons Company (1900), I, pages 219-319. 

Columbia University has the following six special faculties to govern 
Columbia College: 

Juridical faculty, school of law, for connnon law.*^ 

Medical faculty, school of medicine. 

Philosophical faculty, school of philosophy, for philosophy, philol- 
ogy, literature. 

« Quite recently, and after a longer experience in America, Professor Miinsterberg 
confirms this statement in the following words: I have no doubt that the doctor 
degree in Harvard ranks higher than in any German university. It occupies a 
medium place between the German doctor examination and the examination for the 
position of academical teacher, in part also corresponds to the German civil-service 
examination. (Znhnijt, No. 35, 1900, j). 389.) Prof. P. Haupt, of Baltimore, in a 
letter addressed to me confirmed this with reference to Johns Hopkins. 

^ For a better understanding of this subject, Miinsterberg's remarks in the above- 
cited excellent paper, American Universities, in Zukunft, No. 35, 1900, p. 3S5, may 
be consulted.

roliticiil ccoiioiny fai'ult\ , school of political science, lor Iiistoiy, 
national economy, public law. 

Natural science faculty, school of pvire science, for mathematics and 
natural science. 

Technical faculty, school of applied science, for mining- and metal- 
lurjj-y, chemistry, engineering, architecture," 

Here, therefore, we have a technical high school combined with the 
university. The tendency to spread out in this direction has recently 
developed more or less among our German universities. Columbia 
College is not strictly separated from Columbia Universit}'. Under- 
graduates — that is, students of the college — ma}^ take certain courses 
of the university. 

Two other institutions are closely connected with Columbia, namely, 
Barnard College and Teachers' College.* Both are near by, separated 
only by the width of a street, but on their own ground. Barnard 
College is intended for women, and corresponds to Columbia College 
for men. Teachers' College is a seminary for male and female teachers 
on a university basis. Barnard College was founded and endowed in 
1889 ])y former President Barnard of Columbia. It is an independent 
corporation, but the courses of instruction and examination are pre- 
scribed by Columbia, and Columbia professors lecture in the institu- 
tion besides others appointed by Columbia. Students of Barnard Col- 
lege maj^ also attend certain advanced lectures in the university and 
take university degrees. Teachers' College was founded in 1888 and 
united with the university in 1898. Certain lectures may also be 
attended by Columbia students. These two colleges, therefore, form 
part of the universit}', have the university president as president of 
each, but are financially quite independent. Their budgets are not 
included in the figures given above. ^ Their students, however, are 
included in the foregoing estimate. Barnard College has 317 students, 
and Teachers' College 365, besides 750 whose relations to the establish- 
ments are not so intimate, while their professors also lecture outside 
of the colleges. The university itself had in 1899-1900 2,456 students, 
of whom 460 were undergraduates, 1,996 graduate students, and 3<» 
nongraduates, making a grand total of 3,888. 

Columbia is less intimately connected with the Union Theological 
Seminary on Sixty-ninth street, about 3 miles distant; with the 
American Museum of Natural History, where, among others, the 
laboratories for anthropolog\^ and paleontology are located, with the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art, both in Central Park, about 2 miles 
distant, and with the New York Botanical Gardens in Bronx Park, 
about 5 miles from the university buildings, where also the her-

])uriiiin and a portion of the hotiinical lit»rarv of tli(» university arc 
deposited, and where the more advanced botanical hil)oratory courses 
are held. In Juh' and Aut>-u.st summer courses of thirty lectures 
each on ten topics are delivered in the universit}'. At the instance of 
the New York Chamber of Commerce, a conunercial high school will 
soon be org'anized. Finally, during- the winter, the professors give 
free public courses of lectures in the two museums above mentioned 
and in Cooper Union, a great free institution for the dissemination of 
learning, with 3,500 students and 2,000 daily readers in the liljrary 
connected with it. Numerous scientific societies hold sessions now 
and then in the rooms of the university, such as the National Acadenu' 
of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science, with its nine sections, and also the American Astronomical and 
Astrophysical Society, the American Chemical Society, the American 
Mathematical Society, the American Physical Society, the Geological 
Society of America, the American Entomological Society, the Ameri- 
can Forestry Association, the American Society for the Promotion of 
Engineering Education," and others. It is, therefore, a center of 
greatly divergent and broad intellectual interests. 

At the head of the university is a president, under a board of 22 
trustees, who form a self-perpetuating bodv and appoint the president. 
At the same time 5 committees on finance, buildings, promotions, 
instruction, and library ofiiciate. The university employs 85 regular 
and 14 special professors,^' 240 assistants, etc., and 12 administrative 
officers, besides 150 persons under the superintendent of buildings, 

« New York itself is the seat of many scientific societies. Only the following need 
be named (from Education in the United States, edited by X. M. Butler, Albany, 
II, 1900, p. 872): The New York Academy of Sciences, founded in 1817^ whose four 
sections (astronomy and physics, geology and mineralogy, biology and anthropology, 
and psychology and philology) meet monthly. (On the 23d of October, 1899, I 
attended an interesting session of the section for anthroiwlogy and psychology, 
which was held together with the Anthropological Club, with Prof. Franz Boas as 
chairman.) The academy also holds general sessions. Every year a reception is 
given, with demonstrations of scientific progress. It publishes octavo annals and 
quarto memoirs. Its library contains 18,000 works. A scientific alliance includes 
tlie academy and the following local societies: Torrey Botanical Clul), New York 
MiiToscopical Society, Linnean Society of New York, New York IMineralogical Club, 
American ^Mathematical Society, New York section of the American Chemical 
Society, and the New York Entomological Society. It is the intention to erect a 
central building for this scientific alliance. The Preliminary List of American 
Learned and Educational Societies, published by the Bureau of Education in 1896, 
enumerates 62 scientific societies in New York. 

''The position of the "Privatdocent" is not known in Columbia, nor in any 
American university. I may mention that the professors of American universities 
generally take a year's leave of absence on half pay every seven years, but may divide 
such leave of aV)sence through several years. This may liave turned out to be a 
necessity, inasnuich as a i)rolon^'ed jounu'y in Europe is of the irreatest iiiiportancc 
to most of them. .V similar privilege ought, however, also to be granted to the 
European jirofessors. 



366 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

among them ((M-hnologists, since a portion of the new installations 
and the greater jxirt of the repairs are made on the premises. The 
university, therefore. emplo3's a stati of over 500 persons, all told. 

Each student pays W-25 to $200 annually for all instruction. The 
university authorities estimate his annual expenses in New York at 
between $375 and $825, according to his requirements — $550 for 
medium acconunodations." Eighty-live fellow\ships and scholarships 
are bestowed aniuially, amounting to almost $60,000, and whoever has 
attained the degree of doctor of philosophy in Columbia may continue 
his work in the hiboratories free of charge. These fellowships and 
scholarships vary between $125 and $850, most of them $500, and the 
holder of fellowships need pay no college fees. A committee of pro- 
fessors aids poor students in order that they may support themselves 
while pursuing their studies as private teachers, translators, writers, 
evening school instructors, traveling companions, stenographers, type- 
writers, etc. The student who asks this aid is respected all the more 
for it by his colleagues. 

The university annually publishes a catalogue, which contains 400 
to 500 pages of accurate information, a report of the president, of 
over 100 pages, catalogues of lectures of each faculty with all possible 
special data for the students, comprehensive pamphlets of 100 or more 
pages; and also, beginning in 1899, a Quarterly, which treats only of 
affairs relating to the universit}^ proper. A bulletin appeared from 
1890 to 1898. In 1897 a small album of 48 pages was published with 
many illustrations and plans, entitled ""Columbia University," which 
gives an excellent idea of the whole establishment. Finally, from 
1894 to 1900, 16 volumes of a scientific character have appeared in 
quarto, octavo, and duodecimo (each volume complete in itself), 
together with serial publications of eleven different departments 
(contributions, memoirs, or studies), and five periodicals, which are 
conducted by members of the faculty. 

The i)ower 'plant. — It was planned to build a power house for heat- 
ing, lighting, ventilating, water, electricity, mechanical power, com- 
pressed air, etc., directly on the banks of the Hudson River, but a 
short distance from the university in a straight line, in order that coal 
could be unloaded directl}^ from the vessels into the boiler house. 
The pipes and cables were then to have been led up through a tunnel, 
but this project was not permitted by the cit}' authorities as the near- 
by residents thought themselves damaged by such a plan. In conse- 
quence of this a handsome boathouse was erected on the ground already 

« In Harvard the expenses are estimated at 1500 to $600, in Yale $700, in Philadel- 
phia $450. Each stndent costs the American universities from $125 (at Vassar 
College for women) to $400 (Leland Stanford Junior University); in the German 
universities the cost averages $175, as estimated from a total expenditure of about 
$5,750,000 for 33,500 students.

purchased on the banks of the river, the gift of a patron, and the 
engine hou.se was built luider the University Hall in a room 165 feet 
long-, 100 feet wide, and 33 feet high. For this purpose, together 
with great tunnels to connect all the ])uildings, the drains, cellars, coal 
bunkers, and ground floors, more than 80,000 square yards of rock had 
to be quarried. The machinery is driven by a 4,000 horsepower 
engine, that requires 13,000 tons of coal a year, 4,000 of which can be 
stored at one time. In order to protect the buildings from the vibra- 
tions of the powerful engines, their foundations were all united on a 
single wall base separated from the foundations of the buildings; this 
had the desired result. 

The steam-heating apparatus is installed according to the so-called 
direct-indirect system (that is, radiant heat and warmed ventilating 
air), and goes through thousands of feet of pipe. The exhaust steam 
from the engines suffices for heating the library and the University 
Hall. Automatic thermostats regulate the temperature of all the 
rooms. The ventilator drives 1,250,000 cubic feet of air a minute 
through the building. Nowhere is it renewed less than six times an 
hour, in some rooms twelve times. The piping for water, gas, com- 
pressed air, vacuum, etc., is unusualh^ extensive, the chemical institute 
alone having over 6,000 discharge pipes and connections. Equally 
enormous is the length of wire conduits for light, power, telephone, 
electric clocks, signal clocks, watchmen's time detectors, electric ele- 
vators, etc. The cost of the machinery, without counting the prepa- 
ration of the foundations, was $200,000, that is, $50 for each horse- 
power. The power house itself under the University Hall, including 
tunnel and coal bunkers, cost $350,000. The heat, light, and electric 
appliances for the buildings still to be erected will cost $550,000. 
The whole power system, therefore, will cost about $1,125,000. 

The entire power plant was most carefully planned and executed in 
the highest style with regard to solidity and neatness. Tne subter- 
ranean rooms are excellently lighted and are models of cleanliness — 
the whole a work of art comparable to the power plant of an immense 
modern ocean passenger steamer. It should also serve as an object 
lesson for the technical department of the university. It is managed 
by 18 men, who work in three relays of eight hours each, and receive 
$10,000 in wages. Th«> annual expenditure for coal amounts to 
$14,000.'^' After all the buildings are completed the expenditures for 
coal will increase to $27,500 and wages to $15,000.'' 

The library will some day form the center of the entire university — 
an excellent idea. It is situated at the top of a gently rising ground 

«They are not allowed to burn soft coal in New York, a police regulation which 
would be very appropriate for Dresden.

3(>8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

at the head of hroad Hiohts of steps. In Romane.squc architecture 
according- to thir French conception, magnificent with its tine pillared 
portico and dome rising above the whole, it is worthy of comparison 
with the best modern buildings of P^uropean capitals. Three stories 
surround an imposing central hall, and the whole rests upon a raised 
ground floor 200 feet square. The center of the dome is 137 feet 
above the surface of the ground. 

The library also acconunodates those faculties whose equipment 
consists only of books and who, as yet, have no building of their own. 
Thus, the northern wing belongs almost exclusively to the law faculty. 
On the second stor}- is the section of the library belonging to that 
facult}^; on the third the reading room, with 140 seats; on the fourth 
an auditorium for 240 hearers; all three, like the raised ground floor, 
containing side rooms for administration, seminars, professors, and 
students; constituting, so to speak, a building for the law faculty 
within the university library." They are, however, already thinking 
of erecting a special law ))uilding. 

The schools of political science and philosoph}^ are in like manner 
accommodated in the western and eastern wings; only that here, 
instead of the reading room on the third floor, eight seminary rooms 
are to be divided into library sections which will serve for the corre- 
sponding schools; that is, for philosophy, pedagogics, literature, phi- 
lology, political economy, pu))lic law. and liist()r3\ Two such seminary 
rooms for Latin and Greek are located on the second floor. This is an 
ingenious arrangement, which, so far as I know, has nowhere else been 
carried out in this manner. A half story of the entire wing forms a 
single room, the inner three-fifths of which are occupied by 26 book- 
stacks, for the most part 20 feet long, while the outer two-fifths are 
empt3\ One can therefore look through from one end to the other, a 
distance of 110 feet. In the partition planes of the two-sided book- 
stacks of 12 by 12 feet run massive sliding doors of oak, reaching to the 
ceiling, of such dimensions as are perhaps seldom seen. These, how- 
ever, may be easily handled, and by their means the outer open space 
may be divided into as man}^ larger or smaller single rooms as may be 
desired, up to eight each. Every such room is provided with tables 
and chairs, so that one may sit secluded in the library of any par- 
ticular })ranch. This arrangement seems to me as original as it is 
practical. The library is not so much a storehouse for books as a 
laboratory for study with books. Exactly as much care has been 
bestowed upon the reader as upon the books. On the fourth floor of 
each of those two wings there are four auditoriums, each accommo- 
dating 85 to 58 persons, as w(>Il as administrative and other side 
rooms. In the south wing, moreover, there are two auditoriums,

surrounding region may be enjoyed, as is also the case from the other 
university buildings. 

The library has a total capacity for 1,500,000 books. It contains at 
present about 300,000, and about 30,000 pamphlets. The increase of

$15,0()(> was received for the purchase of books. It is estimated that 
the amiual average increase will reach 1S,00(). Tiie lH)okstacks are 
distributed in three stories, two stacks always standing one upon 
another; that is, arranged in each story indep(Midently of the others.

velvet. 1 am not acquainted with such excellent work of this kind in 
Europe.

ning without any intention of utilizing the daylight. On the ground 
floor there are special fireproof vaults for rare books, a provision

the galleries of which are supported by 16 costly green granite pillars 
29 feet high, with gilded Ionic capitals, there are 158 seats. In its 
entire design and in its artistic ornaments, although the decoration is 
not yet entirel3' finished, the rotunda constitutes a great attraction.

at the Columbia University library by another. This, however, is not the case. I was 
told that they were satisfied with the system and that they could get along very well 
with it.

prepared, is accessible to everybody. The reading- room is open on 
week days (with only four exceptions duriiio- the year) from 8.30 
o'clock in the mornino- till 11 o'clock at nij^ht; during the summer 
holidays (July to September) till 10 o'clock. The library is enviably 
easy of access. Up to a late hour in the evening everyone has 
unlimited freedom of reference in all rooms open to the public. 

The order cards are forwarded ])y pneumatic tubes, the books 
return on small lifts driven by compressed air. In the evening the 
lofty reading room, in addition to the direct electric lighting, suffi- 
cient in itself, is brightened up by a so-called "moon," that is, a great 
globe suspended in the middle, on which electric light is thrown from 
the eight corners of the upper galleries and retlected from it. Beside 
the central hall is located a special library with its own reading 
room — the architectural library with 10,000 volumes. The valuable 
folios are kept in a horizontal position in separate iron repositories on 
copper rollers, and are thus very easily handled without injury to the 
binding. This ai'rangement is as perfect and as artistic as that of 
the above-mentioned bookstacks. 1 may note also among the special 
sections, a Goethe library of 1,200 volumes and a Kant library of 600 
volumes. 

The books are consulted chiefly by professors and students, who are 
permitted to take them away. Last year more than 77,000 volumes 
were thus taken out by about 8,000 persons. No record is kept of the 
attendance within the library, but all the seats in the reading rooms 
are usually occupied. Outsiders may consult books only in the library 
itself. Mine librarians and 22 assistants and cataloguers attend to the 
needs of the library, together with 29 copyists and messengers. 
Altogether 67 persons are emploj^ed, including 33 women. 

The building itself is of fireproof construction throughout, but has 
wooden furniture (except most of the })ookstacks) and wooden doors 
and window frames. The floors are stone, covered parth" w^ith par- 
quetry and corticine, a very elastic kind of linoleum. 

A wonderful spirit of care and order is everywhere apparent. 
Even in the anterooms the same elegant solidity prevails as in the 
sumptuous main rooms. Very few institutions of the kind could be 
compared with this one. 

The cost of the library amounted to $1,250,000, $600,000 of which 
were for the interior furnishings. It was opened in l.s!>7. 

I must refrain from describing in detail the four following build- 
ings with their institutes already completed, and must limit myself to 
short accounts: 

1. The building for natural history and psychology (Schermerhorn 
Hall) is 215 feet long and 85 feet wide. The two basement floors, the 
first story, and half of the second story are devoted to mineralogy and 
geolog}^; the other half of the second stor}- to psjx'hology, with labora-

tories after the Wiuult pattern. Rsychology is diligently fostered in 
the universities of the United States even more than in Germany, and 
Columbia University ranks among the tirst in this respect. Quite 
recently ,). D. Rockefeller gave $100,000 primarily for the better 
endowment of this chair. The third story contains seven other rooms 
for psychology, the remainder for l)otany. The fourth flour is devoted 
to zoology. Each of these sections has its museum for instruction, its 
reference library, its laboratories and lecture rooms (the large one for 
250 persons), and the necessary anterooms. This was not carried out 
according to a fixed plan, but no pains have ))een spared to adapt every 
detail to its special objects and to work each out as completely as pos-

sihlc. Toward this object advantage has been taken of the experience 
not only of America but also of Europe. The Prussian university 
plans at the Chicago World's Fair, the purchase of which was men- 
tioned on a })revious page, were of special value in this connection. 
The buildings, which are situated entirely on the plateau, have four 
stories above the ground floor; those erected on its edge have six on 
the outer side. The entire furnishings, including the cases containing 
the collections, the doors, and the window frames, are of wood; in 
other respects the construction is quite fireproof. The floors of the 
corridors, the laboratories, and the stairs are partly of marble, partly 
of other stones, marble mo.saic. or asphalt; the floors of the lecture 
rooms, otfices, etc., are of fireproof material, with parquetr}^ of pine

or oak. In the reading and college rooni.s the parijuctry is eov^ered 
with corticine. 
The above remarks apply also to the following three buildings: 

2. The building for ph^'sics, astronomy, mechanics, English, and 
rhetoric (Fayerweather Flail) is 155 feet long and 6i) feet wide. On 
the two basement floors, and on the lirst and second stories, physics 
is taught, the large lectui-e room having a capacity for 152; on the third 
floor is the section for English language and rhetoric with a lecture 
room for llO students, and four rooms for 60 each, and the fourth is 
devoted to astronomy and mechanics, with one lecture room for 100, 
and three for 50 each. 

3. The building for chemistry and architecture (HaA^eraeyer Hall) is 
215 feet long and 85 feet wide. On the two basement floors, metallurgy 
is taught; on the tirst to the third stories, chemistry (the lecture room 
for 325); on the fourth, architecture, with a large drawing room for 
about 150 students and a library, nmseum, lecture rooms, and special 
study rooms. 

4. The technical building (engineering building) is 155 feet long and 
60 feet wide, with museums, laboratories, workshops, lecture rooms, 
the largest for 146, drawing room, etc. The fourth story is almost 
entirely occupied by a large room for drawing, containing 78 tables. 
The workshops in the neighl)oring Teachers' College are also utilized 
by the students of the mechanical section. 

These buildings cost between 1300,000 and $600,000 each, altogether 
about 11,750,000. Three of them bear the names of their founders. 
Eight similar ones are still to be erected; among them, one each for 
the law faculty, for philosophy and pedagogics, for history and polit- 
ical economy, and for philology. There will also ])e a college building, 
costing $312,500. Between these structures, to the east and west of the 
library, a chapel will be built, for which quite recently an anonymous 
patron donated $100,000, and a student's clubhouse, which is already 
in course of construction." Two older buildings. West Hall and Col- 
lege Hall, erected in 1878 and 1882, formerly used for different uni- 
versity and college purposes, than at present, will be torn down as 
soon as they can be replaced by buildings provided for in the plan. 
It would, therefore, not be worth while to describe them more minutely. 

Finally, the gymnasium under University Hall is especially worth 
seeing, on account of its fltness and elegance. It has, perhaps, hardly 
an equal of its kind. Manly sport plays a still greater part in America 
than in England. The main room, which occupies two-thirds of the 
building in the rear, is of apse form and measures 35 feet in height, 
168 feet in length, and 134 feet in width, with an area of 16,000 square 
feet, vv^here athletic, gymnastic, and calisthenic exercises may be con-

ducted. An olliptical miiniiig track, constructed with extraordinary 
care, and which also extends through the front third of the })uilding, 
is 11 feet broad and 555 feet long." Its ends are slanting with the 
outer edge 28 inches higher than the inner edge. In a mezzanine 
story are located rooms for fencing, boxing, and hand ball. There 
are 32 shower ))aths with marble walls, as well as 1,(500 iron lockers. 
Half of the room under the gymnasium is occupied by a swinmiing 
tank in apse form, 100 feet long, 50 feet broad, and 4 to 10 feet 
deep, with a capacity for nearly 2«)(>,00(> gallons. The water is 
constantly renewed, twice filtered, heated to 68' F., and then cooled. 
Electric currents radiate through it from the edge beneath the surface. 
Around the tank are placed four large dressing and rubl)ing rooms, 
42 private dressing rooms of thick opaque glass, and 20 plunge baths, 
shower baths, and tub baths. In spite of its location below ground 
everything is brilliantly illuminated by light shafts from large win- 
dows. Each student paj^s $T a year for exercises, baths, and a 
locker. On entering, he is subjected to a rigid physical examination, 
receives advice and instructions according to the state of his health, 
and is afterwards directed in his exercises. The gymnasium is open 
from 10 a. m. to 7 p. m. One or more men in authority are always 
present. Instruction is given very systematically, and it is compul- 
sory for the younger students, in order that everyone may have an 
opportunity to learn the elements of self-preservation and defense. 
With this object in view, chiefly boxing, fencing, wrestling, and 
swimming are practiced. To go further here into the details of the 
carefully considered methods of exercising would carry me too far. 
The gymnasium cost about $500,000. 

Upon the lower stories described, an additional stor}- is now being 
built, which is to contain eating rooms, club rooms, and administrative 
rooms, as well as a hall, capable of accommodating 1,500 persons, for 
the religious and social life of the students.* 

Unquestionably Columbia University has a great future before it. 
It will pursue its victorious career in the foremost ranks of the cham- 
pions for the dissemination of culture and the advancement of science, 
and it will the better perform its task if it keeps at its head men of 
lofty intellectual (qualities, of eminent talent for organization, and of 
far-reaching personal influence. The presidents of the leading univer- 
sities of the United States hold a prominent place in the public life of 
the great country; everybody knows them as everybody knows the 
ruling statesmen and politicians, and they are respectfully heard on 
questions affecting the public weal. Thus President Low, of Colum- 
bia, represented the Government at The Hague Peace Congress of 
1899. The presidents exert a much greater influence over everything

coiK'erning- the university" than the ch{inj»ing rector of the (ierman 
universities who is subordinate to a government department, and their 
})o\ver of initiative is ([uite different. That lepuhlican Americans 
love monarchical powers is shown bv their railroad kinj^s, their direc- 
tors of great rings and trusts, and also by the authority of their 
Presidents, despotic for the time being. Scth Low,'' doctor of laws, 
was mayor of Brooklyn and an authority on the su))ject of municipal 
administration. In 1889 he was placed at the head of Columbia, and 
since then a new epoch has been inaugurated in th(> development of 
this university.^ He has- not only placed his vast energy and his far- 
reaching influence at the service of the university, but he also sets an 
example by his self-sacriflcing devotion. He erected the wonderful 
library of the university, that ornament and model of its kind, by a 
personal expenditure of $1,260,000, and he ranks in other respects 
among the most active patronw of the great institution upon which he 
has left the impress of his mind.'' 

THE PREDOMINANT INFLUENCE OF THE GERMAN OVER THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES. 

Upon the predominating influence of the German universities over 
the American, and in consequence over the whole intellectual life 
of the Union, all voices appear to be unanimous. Thus, among 
others, David Starr Jordan, president of Leland Stanford Junior 

«The difficulties of these positions are excellently described in an anonymous 
article in the Atlantic Motxthly (April, 1900, pp. 483-493), on The Perplexities of a 
College President. 

ft Mr. Low retired in 1901 when he was elected mayor of .the city of New York. 
Columbia then had 38.5 teachers, 4,500 students, 9 faculties, a library of 311,000 vol- 
umes, and its property amounted to $18,000,000, of which Mr. Low had given 
$1,500,000—1903. 

''The author of an article "What is a University?" in the Spectator, London, Feb- 
ruary 12, 1898, p. 230, say?, among other things: "Columbia is one of the best 
appointed institutions of learning in the world." A Riedler ("Amerikanische tech- 
nische Lehranstalten," Verhandlungen zur Beforderung des Gcverhefleisses, 1893, p. 
422) expressed the opinion seven years ago that Columbia would probably become the 
foremost institution of learning in the United States. Columbia University and 
Teachers College were each awarded a gold medal at the Pari? Exposition of the year 
1900, the former for photograi)hs, publications, and psychology, the latter as a 
higher normal school. 

''It might interest (Ierman readers to know that CoUmdiia University in 1889 
bestowed the degree of doctor of laws upon Carl Schurz. The promoter said, among 
other things, on that occasion: "We must congratnlate ourselves that in honoring 
liim, we help to strengthen the bond which unites Germany and America; that we, 
in honoring him, also honor the great land which is his i)arent country and the 
original home of all those in whose veins flows English blood." 

At the same time a Carl Schurz donation to the amount of $20,000 was given to the 
university by his friends on condition that the interest on one-half the amount 
sliould l)e applied to I'stablishing a fellow.«hip in German and the other hah' be 
devoted to purchases for tlie Germanic section of the library. A knowledge of Ger- 
man is now one of the reiiuirements for admi-ssion to Columbia University, and in 
mo.st of the universities tlie degree of doctor is bestowed only ujion the candidate 
who is able to read printed German fluently and to translate it into English at sight. 



376 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

Universit}^ of California, in an article on ''The urgent Need of a 
National University in Washington,"" observes: 

The great revival of learning in the United States, which has shown itself in the 
growth of universities, in the rise of the spirit of investigation, and in the realization 
of the value of truth, can he traced in a large degree to Germanic influences. These 
influences have not come to us through German immigration, or through the pres- 
ence of (Tcrman scholars among us, l)ut through the exjierience of American scholars 
in (iermany. If it l)e true, as Mr. James Bryce says [American Commonwealth, II, 
1889, p. 694, 3 ed.], that "of all institutions in America," the universities, "have 
the best promise for the future;" we have Germany to thank for this. It is, how- 
ever, no abstract Germany that we may thank, but a concrete fact. It is the existence 
in Germany of universities, strong, effective, and free. 

Even English voices lay stress upon this fact. Thus, in an article 
in the Sjjectator oi February 12, 1898, on ''What is a University?" 
in which, in consideration of the establishment of a universit}^ in Lon- 
don, live types of modern luiiversities are characterized, the French, 
German, English, Scotch, and American (p. 231). it says concerning 
the American types: 

We come now to the American universities, by which we mean the greater insti- 
tutions of culture, not the hundreds of petty colleges to be found in all parts of 
America. Some of these, in our judgment, come nearer to the ideal of a true uni- 
versity than any of the other types. Beginning on the old English collegiate system, 
they have broadened out into vast and splendidly endowed institutions of universal 
learning, have assimilated some (irerman features, and have combined successfully 
college routine and discipline with mature and advanced work. Harvard and 
Princeton were orignally English colleges; now, without entirely abandoning the 
college system, they are great semi-German seats of learning. Johns Hopkins at 
Baltimore is purely of the German type with no residence, and only a few plain 
lecture rooms, library, and museums. Columbia, originally an old English college, 
is now perhaps the fir.'^t university in America, magnificently endowed, with stately 
buildings, and with a school of political and legal science second only to that of 
Paris. * * * The quadrangles and lawns of Harvai-d, Yale, and Princeton almost 
recall Oxford and Cambridge; their lecture rooms, laboratories, and postgraduate 
studies hint of Germany, where nearly all American teachers of the present genera- 
tion have been educated. 

I myself received the impression that the majority of the professors 
of the universities which I visited in New York, Chicago, Philadel- 
phia, Boston, and Cambridge, with whom I became acquainted and 
there were not a few of them — had studied in German}' or had at least 
spent some time there, of course excepting the few Germans who 
tilled positions in the imiversities named. 

When, in January of this 3' ear, the faculty and students of the Uni- 
versity of Chicago gave a formal reception in Chicago to the German 
ambassador, the professor of political economy, Mr. Laughlin, deliv- 
ered the address of welcome, from which I take the following sen- 
tences (Illinois StaaU-Zettung, Janiiar}^ 25, 1900, p. 5): 

There is no American university which is not imbued with the fire of German 
intellectual activity. We have attended in crowds the lecture halls of the universi-

tifsaiul lighted the liuiii) of our knowledge at their altai>. The Aiiiericauy have 
found the love of truth, tlie naered yearning after knowledge and poetry in Heidel- 
berg, Gottingen, Tubingen, etc. When we look down npon the red roof.s and towers 
of Gottingen, as ujjon the red marvel-flower of wisdom as it lies there surronnded 
by a garland of lindens standing on the old walls, we find there not only the student 
(|uarter9 of Bismarck but also the places where Bancroft and Longfellow intrenched 
themselves behind their books. To be sure the German universities have not served 
as models for our own, l)ut we have adapted the spirit of their knowledge to our cir- 
cumstances. * * * Our debt to German science is great; we can not repay it. 

T heard these very words, that the debt of gratitude could never be 
repaid to German^^, from the mouth of one of the professors of the 
Technical High School in Boston, when, upon niy thanking- him for 
the very obliging reception which 1 had met with, he refused to accept 
m}' thanks. 

(In the lil^rary of Edison's pri\'ute laboratory at Orange, near New 
York, I found, as artistic ornaments, the bust of Alexander von Hum- 
Itoldtand the portraits of Bunsen, Helmholtz, Kirchhotf, Kopp, Liebig, 
and Magnus, but of no other scientists. When I told Edison how 
pleased I was to see that he surrounded himself with the portraits of 
German scientists, he told me of his friendship with Helmholtz and 
Siemens, and mentioned that he had that very morning to consult a 
treatise by Wohler.) 

The present ambassador of the United States to the German Empire, 
A. D. White, at a banquet given in July of this year to the American 
Mechanical and Civil Engineering Association in Berlin, expressed 
himself in the following terms: He looked back with great satisfaction 
to the time, thirty years before, when he had studied the conditions of 
the high schools and the technical schools in Berlin, he had been able, 
on his return to America, to point to these institutions as worthy of 
imitation. As a consequence Cornell University, of which, for a 
quarter of a century, he was the first president, and other special and 
technical schools were founded. Many of his countrymen had received 
in German}' the impulse and the knowledge for the establishment of 
institutions of learning in their own land. He had returned to Amer- 
ica with love and reverence for his teachers. He, w^th man}- of his 
countrymen, regarded Germany as his second fatherland. 

L. Triang said, in a lecture on "Germany in the American univer- 
sities," recently delivered before the German Society' of Columbia 
University {Zeitgeist, March 5, 1J)()()): 

The student who, after completion of the studies usual in his country, wishes to 
perfect himself in his profession and carry on sjieciai studies, almost invariably goes 
to Germany, where a great propoi'tion of the entire body of American teachers have 
received their final education and imbibed the German spirit of learning and the 
German scientific faithfulness. 

Prof. Harry Thurston Peck, of Columbia University, and, as editor of the Boolc- 
innn, one of our most prominent critics [I quote from an article by M. Groszmann 
in The Open Court ((^hicago), October, 1899, p. 620], showed in a recent article that 
the old traditions of American education have been wiped out by German infiuenc-e; 



378 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

tliat a vivid interest in German j)edagogy i« asserting itself more and more, and that 
German langnage and literature are crowding out other foreign iutiuences. He went 
ao far as to say, "(ierman in.lluenee has already altered the raeial charaeter of our 
people. ' ' 

In Volume II of the report of the Commissioner of Education for 
the 3'ear 1897-9S (Washington, 1899), in tlie chapter entitled Foreign- 
ers in Universities of Europe," page 1702, and in other places of this 
great work, may be found the following statements: American students 
preferably attend Jena, Leipzig, Heidelberg, and Berlin, owing to the 
courses at these universities. In 1895, 3,362 foreigners were matricu- 
lated at German universities, of whom 514 were Americans, but it is 
estimated that at least an equal nimiber studied by attending lectures, 
so that altogether an annual quota of over 1,0(>0 Americans may be 
estimated. At the same time only 108 Americans were matriculated 
in Austrian institutions and 65 in Swiss institutions. In 1895 Berlin 
had 159 Americans out of -1,018 students, Leipzig 53 out of 2,798, 
Gottingen 30 out of 878; Paris, on the other hand, had only 32 out 
of 10,915.« 

James Bryce (American Commonwealth, 3d ed., II, 1899, p. 682) 
says, giving reasons therefore, that "extremely few" of the American 
students go to Oxford or Cambridge in England. With reference to 
France, it is stated in an article by F. C. Newcombe, "Opportunities 
for biological study in Paris and the requirements for the new doc- 
torate," in Science (May 11, 1900, p. 740): 

Why do these men in American universities advise their students to go to Ger- 
many? Why are the scientifie lil)raries in this country so much better stocked with 
German literature than witli French literature? I can not help feeling, though I 
have no statistics, that on the whole (Termany has, within the past forty years, pro- 
duced more scientitic men and more scientific literature than has France. It is doubt- 
less true that we neglect unduly French scientific literature in this country, but it 
is probably also true that to-day, as forty years ago, we justly look to Germany as 
the seat of the leading spirits in the progress of biological science. 

E. D. Perry, professor of Greek in Columbia University, says:* 
"It is the glory of Germany that she has seen more clearly than 
other nations how true it is that the highest scientific training is none 
too good for her public servants." Compare his very plain statement 
concerning the influence of the German university on the develop- 
ment of American imiversities, pages 288 and 289. Although S. 
Sherwood (University of the State of New York, Regents' Bulletin 
No. 11, Albany, 1893, p. 269) ascribes to the "revolutionary France 
the greater influence in shaping the character of the entire modern 
system of education of Europe and America, nevertheless he freely 
admits that the German systems are now "models for the world."

eiR-e in the ehaptei' Notes on the History of foreign InMueiu-e upon 
Kdueation in the United States of the al)ove-eited education report 
{I, p. 603-029). Among other things he there gives a list of the 
Americans who studied in (iottingen from 1789 to 1851, in Halle from 
1826 to 1849, in Berlin from 1825 to 1850, and in Leipsic from 1827 
to 184:0. Supplementary to this, Pi'ofessor Perry, who has already 
been quoted, remarks" that after 18-48 a noticeabl(> numl)er of Ameri- 
cans, including many of the most eminent scholars the country ha.s 
produced, obtained degrees in Germany, and that after 1870, hundreds 
visited Germany amuially, which, together with the opening of the 
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in flanuary. 1876, on an avow- 
edly German plan, gave a mighty impulse. 

In the same periodical (p. 6) II. A. Todd, professor of romantic phi- 
lology in Columbia University, states that prior to the last twenty years 
American students abroad attended almost exclusively German univer- 
sities. To-day, therefore, the American universities are manned pre- 
eminently by professors who have been in close contact with the leading 
minds of Germany. Although it is now customary to advise American 
students to study for a year in Germany, Professor Todd can, "with 
prophetic eye, foresee the time when it will become of interest to an 
increasing number of European students to seek part of their training 
in the United States."' I think time will show that he is right. That 
so large a percentage of the active professors of the American univer- 
sities have studied in Germany may perhaps be in part explained by 
the fact that the men who sought to complete their education in 
Europe were a very select intellectual band. Onl}- the best fitted and 
the most ambitious young scientists felt the desire to extend their 
circle of vision. Their knowledge and their views were essentially 
widened in Europe, and thus they returned predestined to fill positions 
as teachers. 

Prof. H. Miinsterberg, of Harvard, has recently expressed the opin- 
ion * that, although the spirit of American universities has for the past 
fifty years been determined by men who have studied in Germany and 
))rought home with them enthusiasm for German science, these rela- 
tions are now changing. The number of students, he iia.ys, who after 
a couple of years of study return from Cfermany deeply disappointed, 
is increasing in a striking manner, and everN^where the advice is heard 
to finish one's ordinary studies in America and to seek further inspi- 
ration in Germany only after having obtained a degree. Such a change 
would show that the former conditions of dependence no longer exist 
to their former extent, and that the time when Professor Todd's 
prophecy will come true is already approaching.

the sake of greater security against tire, are turning more and more to 
iron furniture, which is preferable to wood also on account of its 
general appearance. Iron is prepared for this purpose with much 
better machinery than among us, and is, in consequence, in spite of 

higher wages, much cheaper than 
in Germany. It has at the same 
time the advantage of an elegant 
exterior. Especially perfect is 
the varnish, which is obtained by 
triple burning. B}' its use the 
iron becomes as if enameled. It 
is, moreover, adorned with 
bronze, brass, marble, painting, 
and the like. 

There are several larger firms 
of the same sort in the United 
States, as, for example, Snead &

Kentucky, which, among other 
things, constructed the remarka-

cases and record cases in course of construction for the court-house in 
Baltimore, parts of an order for $60,000. The iron book stacks of 
this firm pleased me particularly on account of their simplicity, as 
compared with the ditlorent models which I saw in the libraries of New 
York, Alban\', Butl'alo, Chicag'o, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, 
and Cambridge. The figured case for folio volumes which rest upon

With regard to fireproof rooms and their fitting up with iron furni- 
ture, we in Europe are, at all events, far behind America, and I can 
not too strongly recommend adopting in our museums and other public 
buildings such contrivances which are already in very general use

there. One of the aliove-mentioned tirm.s has the motto, •"Anything 
in metal from a building to a box." It is the more surprising that the 
American museums have as yet no iron, l)ut only wooden cases and 
desks for their collections," whereas the former are already i^sed to 
some extent in Europe. There can be no doubt that the Americans, 
when once they shall have decided on iron furniture for museums, will 
be in a position to construct it in a much more perfect manner than 
we have as yet succeeded in doing in Europe, since their experiences 
with other iron contrivances have alreadj^ carried them ver}^ far. 

«They have since begun to fit with such the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, 
and, I believe, other places.

It is difficult to induce the firms mentioned to execute small orders

At the establishment of F. Pollard (3;V3T Bethune street. New York

cases and glass desks without framework except on the back, and of 
excellent workmanship. My attention was tirst atti'acted to very large 
show windows of this kind whose plate glass panes were not fastened 
in iron or wooden frames, but were held by metal screws which 
pressed the edges of the glass together, with only a thin layer of cloth

between to make them tit tightly. These cases are, so far as I am 
aware, as yet nowhere used in museums. They now serve only for 
show cases in business houses, but are excellenth' adapted for public 
collections on account of their elegance and absence of framework on 
the show sides. Cases completely proof against dust, which have not 
as yet been manufactured, could easily be attained. They are opened 
and closed at the back b}' means of glass doors in wooden or white 
metal frames; socle or base of marble or of any other material. 1 
give a figure of a case of the kind which, with lower socle, could be 
used as a desk top, and which may be had up to five meters in length. 
I ol)tained a sample of such a case of smaller size for the Dresden 
Museum. At the Industrial Exposition in Philadelphia I saw similar 
very elegant glass cases manufactured by the firm of F. X. Ganter, 
Leadenhall and Stockliolm streets, Baltimore, with l)ranch houses in 
Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington. These cases were 
made tight by means of silk bands. The business is now turned into 
a joint stock company, the Crystal Show Case and Mirror Compan}^, 
which is to go over "the whole earth."-

In New York very man}^ fireproof and l)urol?„r-proof buildinjr^ niay 
be found. I inspected amono- others the niagniticcnt building" erected 
by Gibson in 1896 for the New York Clearing House Association 
(Cedar street), whose balances amount annuall}- to $35,000,000,000'* 
and where millions in gold are constantly stored. Everything is done 
here to guard against robbery, fire, and insurrection. The diff^erent 
rooms are separated from one another by grates and doors; the iron 
cases for valualiles are so constructed that they may be instantly closed 
by a grasp of the hand; the (;ash vaults may be submerged, and the 
whole may be turned into a kind of fortress with cannon and muskets. 
Electric l)ells to summon aid from without are to be found every- 
where. The vaults could be reached by dynamite only in case one 
were willing to l)ury himself under the ruins, since undermining it 
from without is practically impossible on account of the deep founda- 
tion. Elsewhere iron armor plates have been employed as a protection 
against cannon balls. It does not appear from without that the 
clearing house is so formidably protected. Such contrivances would, 
indeed, not be applicable to museums, but some of them might be 
introduced to protect certain objects of value or sections of the 
museums.'' 

I take at random among others, as an ol)ject well worth seeing, the 
recently completed fireproof building of the University Club (Fifth 
avenue and Fifty-fourth street), five stories in front and eight stories 
in the rear, constructed by McKim, Mead & White. It is a Floren- 
tine fortress-palace, 125 feet in height, ornamented among- other 
things with the arms of eighteen American universities in stone. 
The club has 3,000 members, all of whom must possess a learned 
degree in order to be admitted, and contains a librar}- of 20,000 vol- 
umes. A higher standard of solidity, fitness, and carefully planned, 
practical utilization and distribution of space, with taste and elegance 
in execution, could scarcely be imagined. The flat roof, which ati'ords 
a fine view, serves in summer evenings as a pleasant resort. In the 
cellar there is a gymnasium. All mechanical contrivances are of a 
high degree of pei-fection, embodying all possible modern inventions, 
and many of them would be applicable to buildings for collections. 
The whole is a model and unicjue structure of its kind and compar- 
able only to a prince's palace. The cost of the ground, building, and 
furnishings amounted to over $2,125,000. 



«The average daily balances in 1901 were $254,193,638; on May 10, $598,537,409, 
The average daily balance in gold and bank notes was $1 1,600,784. 

6 In the basement of the Swiss Landes Museum at Zurich there is a fireproof an(l 
burglar-proof room, lighted f)nly by electricity and handsomely installed, for all the 
precious things of the collection and where they are exhibited t" the public in iron 
desks.

With i-oi^anl to the fii'cprootino' the t'oUowinj^ inj^y be speoiiilly 
noted: The outer walls are of brick and granite; all the inner parti- 
tions of hollow terra-cotta blocks. The ceilings are suppoited by 
wrought-iron columns, which are covered over with hollow terra-cotta 
blocks. The joists are of steel, and the dome ceiling is constructed in 
even arches of hollow terra-cotta blocks. Ther space between these 
blocks and the joists is filled with concrete. In this concrete are placed 
the beams, to which the flooring is nailed. This and similar ceiling 
construction is indeed known and used among us, but is not in such 
general use as in America. 

For protection against lire, two -i-incli pipes run from the roof to the 
cellar, where they are connected with a steam pump, and continue out 
to the street, so that the hose belonging to the city Hre department 
may be attached to them. In each story there is a branch pipe with 
hose coupling, hose, and mouthpiece. The hose is wound around a 
wheel. The roof is Hat and completely covered with glazed ]>ricks. 

In the rooting of lireproof buildings special attention should be paid 
to protection against iiying cinders, which ma}- extend much farther 
than is generally supposed. Some years ago a fire broke out in a pri- 
vate residence on Fifth avenue between Sixty-seventh and Sixty-

eighth streets, opposite Central Park, in the best part of the city, by 
which thirteen persons lost their .lives. The sparks flew over two cross 
streets and ignited the roof of another private residence, resulting in 
the loss of two additional lives, and yet the houses in this locality all 
look like solid stone structures. The distance was from 600 to 650 feet. 
This shows the danger of leaving biuldings containing collections in 
the middle of the city, as some of them are located in Dresden, without 
very carefully planned protection against fire, especially in the upper 
portions. Fire has often been known to cross a street more than 65 
feet wide. 

In describing the institutions of Chicago I shall return to the sub- 
ject of fireproof buildings and (|uestions connected with them. 

The heating and ventilating apparatus in the model building of the 
University Club may also be described somewhat more in detail: 

The exhaust steam of the electric light and power plant suffices for 
heating the entire })uilding with low-pressure steam. Every radiator 
has its own supply pipes and return pipes, and the main return pipes run 
into the cellar below the water level of the l)oiler, in order to afford 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 387 

safer and iioiiseless circiilatioii. The condensed .steam is forced back 
to the boilers by self-reoulatino- steam pumps. 

The temperature in the main rooms is automatically regulated by 
Johnson thermostats. This apparatus was invented by Professor 
Johnson, of Milwaukee, and perfected to its present successful applica- 
tion. The flohnson Temperature Regulating* Company, Fourth avenue, 
New York, has already set up such apparatus in hundreds of buildings. 
The most essential portions of the apparatus consist of diaphragms and 
cut-ott" valves to control the source of heat, moved by compressed air, 
and thermostats, which regulate the flow of compressed air to the 
valves by the movement of a compound ))and. This band is to be 
adjusted so that the desired range in the temperature may thereby be 
attained. The ventilating sj^stem is independent of the heating, so 
that it may be set in motion according to the need of the different 
times of day. The fresh air is warmed a little so that it does not dis- 
turb the equilibrium of temperature in the rooms. This warming 
is also regulated 1)}" thermostats. The S3\stem of ventilation insures a 
thorough circulation, l)ut at the same time prevents a draft. All the 
main rooms are sufficiently provided with fresh air, which is changed 
on an average six times an hour. The exhaust air is drawn off' accord- 
ing to the need. The cloak rooms, toilet rooms, etc., the kitchen, 
which is fftted up in a specially ingenious manner, and the laundry 
have exhausters only. The air is here renewed from ten to fifteen 
times an hour. 

The fans which supply the air are centrifugal blowers, which are 
driven by direct-acting, high-pressure engines. These fans, the 
engines, and the heaters occupy a special room in the cellar. The 
exhausters on the roof are discoidal ventilators, which are driven by 
direct-acting electromotors. 

LKillTING OF INTERIORS. 

I saw for the first time in the Boston Art Museum a lighting of 
rooms l)y windows with prismatically-ribbed panes, which made it 
possible to illuminate otherwise somewhat dark wall surfaces in such 
a manner by daylight that they were thereby adapted to the hanging 
of pictures. When on('(^ my attention Avas attracted to this matter 1 
fomid such pi'ismatic panes in use in many other places. I hunted up 
the business office of the American Luxfer Prism Com])any, !•>(> Fifth 
avenue, New York, a company which originally had its headciuarters 
in Chicago, but which now has its central office in London under the 
name General Luxfer Piism Company, with branches in Chicago, 
Toronto, London, Paris, and Berlin. In the United States the Ameri- 
can Luxfer Prism Company has its offices in seventeen other cities — 
an extensive industry whose products are widely distributed. 

It is tlu> more astonishing that nuiseums have not yet directed their 
attention to this matter, for nowhere did 1 iind this glass in use except

in the l^ostoM iimsoinn incntioiicd, unless it eseaped my notice, while 
scarce!}^ a building- for collections exists which is not capable of 
improv^ement in this respect. The company makes (JO different kinds 
of pi'isniatic panes and single prisms, the latter for skylights, wdiich in 
the United States arc used very nuich in rooms under the pavements 
of the streets, since these rooms belong to the cellars of the adjacent 
houses. The ribbed panes, of the uniform size of 10 square centi- 
meters, are electrol^^ticall}^ glazed between liat copper bands," and are 
then fireproof, which offers another great advantage and permits their 
employment as window shutters, doors, etc., for closing- entire stories, 
and the like. 

A similar company is the Mississippi Glass Company, with agencies 
in Boston (Boston Plate and AVindow (llass Company). Prof. C. IT. 
Norton, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, made a report 
on this subject in 1898. based upon experiments (The Diffusion of

department of the Dresden Museum. 

because I consider the subject important for museums so long as they have not 
learned to build them with ail rooms eciually well lij^hted: 

Everybody has perhaps noticed that rooms on the ground floor, under most cir- 
cumstances poorly lighted, in winter, when the window panes are thickly covered 
with frost, have an agreeable, uniform light. They have perhaps also noticed that 
at other times, when the panes are clear and dry, only a small space near the window 
is really well lighted and the other parts of the room remain more or less in shadow. 
In the case of the frost a peculiar diffusion of the light is noticeable, the sharp con- 
trast between the part near the window and the imier i)art has disappeared, and 
only very gradiaally does the intensity of the light dinnnish toward the back part of 
the room. 

For lighting a room !)y daylight by means of its windows, the bit of open sky 
which looks in through the windows is more important than anything else. The 





Fio.30. Fig. 31. 

amount of light derived by reflection from other objects is, on the other hand, very 
small. The nearer opposite buildings are to the windows of a room or the higher 
those buildings are, the smaller will be the bit of sky which can look into tlie room 
and light it up. Why, then, under the same conditions of light, does such a room 
ai^pear ))righter — that is, more uniformly lighted — when the windows are frosty than 
when they are clear? 

The window is struck by a bunch of rays which goes through the plane i)arallel 
glass with(nit changing their direction (fig. 30), and the more obliquely they fall 
the smaller will be the surface of floor which they strike and illuminate. The light 
which illuminates the rest of the room is derived by reflection from this small spot. 

The particles of frost on tiie windows consi.st of crystallized water, of an iuunense 
nui^iber of small hexagonal prisms. Every ray of light which strikes one of these 
small prisms is refracted and takes another direction. Since the nund)erless i)risms 
lie in every conceivable direction on the surface of the glass, the rays of light strik- 
ing them are also turned in every possible direction. They will not fall parallel (ui 
the floor as l)efore, but shoot into the room in every direction. The room is no 
longer filled with the scanty reflected light which comes from the lighted sjjot on the 
floor, but with light direct from the sky (fig. 31). 

This observation has led to a discovery which is of the greatest importance in 
lighting dark I'ooms liy daylight. 'I'hc pi'oblcm to solve was nu'rcly to replace the 



390 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 



DISTANT HEATING. 



The distances which in Dresden are taken into consideration in the 
establishment of the distant-heating- phmt for the museums, etc., hold 
a middle place between American district-heating systems and distant- 
heating estal)lishments, but incline more toward the former. 

The New York Steam Company has established a great district 
steam heating system with several boiler houses in the lower part of 
the city almost from the Battery to the other side of the city hall, 
1,500 yards up Broadway, extending about half that distance east and 
west in the side streets; altogether about 8 miles of pipe. Among 
other great buildings included in this system are the post-office. Mills 
Building with ten stories, and Manhattan Life Building with its 350- 
foot tower. The amount of steam furnished (including power) is said 
to be satisfactory, but the returns are not considerable. Such district 
heating establishments are to be found iii Lockport, Detroit, Phila- 
delphia, Washington, Hartford, etc., but all except one are out of 
use, as they did not prov^e a success. On the other hand, district 
heating S3'stems have lately been combined with electric plants by 
utilizing the exhaust steam, as in Springtield, Illinois, and in other 
cities. For the financial success close proximity of the heated district 



ife prisms of the frozen windows by glass prisms and to give the glass prisms a regular 
arrangement in place of the irregularity of the ice crystals. Another part of the 
problem to solve was to regulate the direction of the rays falling in at random. 
Everything was already fully accomplished by the Fresnel lenses in the light-houses. 
It was therefore only necessary to remodel this costly contrivance so as to adapt it to 
other uses and to cheapen it enough to bring it within reach of the general public. 
This the Luxfer Prism Company succeeded in doing. It manufactures out of plain, 
colorless, hard-glass mold small, strong window panes, with one surface plain, but the 
other fluted with deep parallel grooves. By means of these furrows they obtain 
strong strips of glass, to which are given the form of distinct-angled, three-sided 
prisms. The jirisms have a common basal surface, parallel to the plane surface of 
the plane, and their corresponding surfaces are likewise parallel. (See fig. 28.) 

If rays of light fall upon the plane, they are not conveyed on in the same direc- 
tion, as in the case of ordinary window glass, but are refracted to an angle bearing a 
definite relation to the angle of the prisms. (Fig. .31.) 

If we take a window consisting of nothing but prism panes, all of whose prisms 
lie parallel, all rays of liglit will strike into the room in a parallel direction. It is 
easy to understand that by a different arrangement of the prism panes or certain 
portions of them, rays can be conducted into any desired parts of the room. 

But all poorly lighted rooms do not have such spacious windows as supposed in 
the above description. A very large number of rooms lie below the level of the 
street. Their small windows and the poor light of the generally large rooms limit 
their use to a great extent. These windows, whicli are placed in a narrow shaft and 
often scarcely rise above the level of the street, ex(;ludes the use of those prism panes 
becaust- the amount of lighi (-oming in trom the sky is entirely too narrow. This 
difficulty has been ol)viated by the construction of a i)articular kind of prism. 

The mass of light would become greater if the liglit shaft could be made larger, 
l)ut traffic on the street forbids that. 

It therefore became necessary to find some contrivance which would make it 
possible to enlarge the light shaft without interfering with the street traffic. The 
light shaft is covered Ity a i)late consiHting of i)risms. This plate is composed of very

to the power station and also a certain size of the district is requisite. 
In St. Joseph, Missouri, a block of Inisiness houses, with a room space 
of over 300,000 cubic yards, is heated by the exhaust steam from the 
electric station situated a mile awa}'. 

On the other hand, it has l)een discovered that the special heating 
apparatus is more advantageous for very large buildings and single 
groups of buildings, although the expenditure of coal is not thereby 
diminished. Of such, there are ver}^ many in Ameri(;a. Most large 
buildings have their own power plants for electric lighting, electric 
and hydraulic power for elevators, ventilators, etc., and for the manu- 
facture of ice and the like, in which the working engines afford steam 
for heating almost without cost. Chimnej^s project but little above 
the roofs and never give forth such smoke as among us, especially as 
in Dresden. In America better coal is burned. Relatively few high 
chimneys are seen in the cities and they do not attract so much atten- 
tion on account of the height of the buildings. 1 have already men- 
tioned the distance-heating of Columbia University. The Grand 
Hotel on Broadway possesses a plant for electric lighting for four 
blocks of houses," and the exhaust steam from the engines suffices to 



large single prisms (see fig. 29, p. 388), which receive light direct from the sky on 
their entire basal surface. They then throw this maximum mass at a fixed angle 
against tlie perpendicular or oblique, stationary or movable windows of the room, 
whence prism panes, instead of the usual window glass, di8tril)ute the rays. 

In order that the ideas which we have just traced, and which rest upon physical 
principles, might l)e put into prai-tice with a result api)roaching as near as possible 
to the theory, one more invention was recpaisite, namely, that of galvanic glazing. 

Whereas formerly, and still almost universally, the panes are fastened to the 
framework of windows l)y means of putty or strips of lead, galvanic glazing employs 
electrolytically precipitated, and therefore to a certain extent plastic, copper as a 
cement. The single panes, with a framework of thin c(ii)i)er strijjs, are tied to plates 
of fixed size, and thus placed in the copper bath. In about thirty iiours electrolytic 
copper is precipitated upon tlie copper strips and this binds the i)anes to their 
frames firmly and immovably, making them absolutely air proof. 

The advantage of this electrolytic glazing is great. In the first place, the strips 
separating the panes can be made considerably narrower, which is equivalent to a 
smaller loss of light; and then such windows are more elastic and much more capa- 
ble of resistance than puttied windows, and show themselves to be fireproof to an 
eminent degree. 

While windows glazed in the usual manner immediately iMirst and fall out on 
being heated, these windows have shown their absolute stabiHty during very many 
trials. If, while heated, they are struck by a stream of water from the hose, they 
burst, to be sure, but never fail out. Electro-glazing is therefore to be u.sed especially 
in elevator and light shafts, since the latter, witli their glazing so little capal)le of 
resistance, are not only incapable of opposing the devouring element in the different 
stories, but generally open the way to it. 

«In New York among most of the straight long and cross streets a block east of 
Fifth avenue is in general from 400 to 420 feet long and 200 feet wide, the long 
streets from 75 to 140 feet wide, and the cross streets (JO feet witle; west of Fifth 
avenue a l)lock is gent'rally SOO feet long and 200 to 204 feet wide, tiie long streets 
being 100 feet wideand the cross streets (SO or 100 feet wide. If you ask the ilistam-e

heat the hotel. Most of the great hotels in the United States have 
their own power plants. 

In installing the plant it is of the greatest importance to protect the 
hot pipes from the outside water. This may be accomplished ])y 
proper drainage. 

It is also important, by the insertion of expansive joints of special 
construction and tixed in a particular way at proper distances, to com- 
pensate for the expansion of the pipes and to keep them in position. 
In this case it is always advantageous to place the ])oilers deeper than 
the building to be heated. Finally, the pipes should be isolated. This 
is best accomplished by laying them in cemented conduits easily 
inspected, and by wrapping them in asbestos paper, hair felt, and 
linen, to prevent loss of heat so far as possible. The pipes then 
remain serviceable from live to tifteen years, according to the temper- 
ature to which they are subjected; furthermore, those protected by a 
covering of incombustible mineral wool last still longer. This ques- 
tion has been made the subject of an extended series of experiments. 
Hot water has the worst effect on iron, whereas steam is harmless." 

What I have said is certainly far from exhausting the subject of 
what New York has to show with reference to buildings for collections 
and technical scientific contrivances, in their bearing upon museum 
interests. Lack of time, however, has compelled me to limit my 
observations, nor can I in making my report discuss everything that 
I have seen.

This university was founded in the year 1T84 l)y the State of New 
York, by which it is maintained and governed. It is, however, not a 
didactic university, but a kind of supervising administrative depart- 
ment of instruction, unique of its kind, and traceable to the influenceof 
the French philosophers of the eighteenth century.^ The institution,

perhaps, most resenibles the "'Universite clc Franco," founded h^' 
Napoleon in 1808. It is trj'ing to solve the universal problem of 
extending culture, and has supervision in the State of New York over 
34 universities and academic- high schools (colleges of liberal arts), 76 
professional technical schools, 139 academies, and 559 high schools 
(that is, secondary schools) with 101,630 scholars, over 183 libraries, 
museums, and the like, as well as over 5'23 organizations which are 
affiliated with it — that is, over 1,514 in all. " Its activity embraces not 
only the lield of work of academies, colleges, univiu-sities, professional 
and technical schools, but also that of libraries, nuiseums, courses of 
lectures, and the like." It is governed b}^ nineteen unpaid regents 
(who are elected in the same manner as Senators of the United States, 
and who are the only life-tenure officers in the State of New York), 
together with the governor, the lieutenant-governor, the secretary of 
State, and the superintendent of public instruction, with a chancellor 
and vice chancellor at the head, who are likewise elected and serve 
without pay. 

The university confers degrees after examinations, as well as 
licenses to practice medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine in the 
State of New York. It annually aids the institutions named to the 
extent of $250,000, provided each of these institutions raises a similar 
sum for the same purpose, and it aids public libraries to the extent 
of $50,000, on the same condition. Its annual budget amounts to 
$500,000 (1899). Like other States of the Union, the State of New 
York has a department of public instruction which directs the 
elementary schools (free common schools), and nine-tenths of all the 
children attend these schools; but no other State of the Union has a 
department which attends solely to the interests of higher instruction. 
As such this department exercises jurisdiction over the institutions 
which are placed under its control. It holds annually a congress for 
higher instruction, which is attended by delegates from other States 
and universities, and whose proceedings are published.'^' It was latel}^ 
proposed to establish in the State of New York a department of 
education, which was to embrace the university and the department 
of public instruction, \vith the chancellor of th(> universit}' as respon- 
sible, executive, and administrative head. Init the project has so far 
not been carried out. 

The universit}' is organized into six departments: Administration, 
colleges, high school, home education, lil)rary, and nuiseum. It has 
its offices in the capitol. The administrative department incliKh^s the 
executive, the general supervision, the finances, and the duty of 
making reports.^ The college department conducts the examinations

branches. Tliey are held in the above-mentioned 7H0 institutions of 
learning- themselv^es, as well as at different central localities, where ten 
or more candidates appear.'* The high school department organizes 
instruction and lectures in wider circles.'' The home education 
department has six subdivisions: Extension teaching,'' study clubs,'' 
exchanges, traveling libraries, public libraries,'' and lil)rary school. 
The State li])rary department manages the library; the State nuiseum, 
the museums. 

In the following pages I shall confine myself to the last two institu- 
tions, and shall, moreover, consider only the traveling libraries, the 
exchange S3^stem, and the library school, since these are connected with 
the library.-^ All three belong to the Home Education Department.

up local libraries and advancing their interests in every manner. It does this by 
counsel, by making up lists of the ]>est books with remarks, by cash appropriations 
up to $200 a year each, the latter not only to public, but also to all other free libra- 
ries, as well as to any 25 taxpayers who ask for it together in places where no 
libraries exist. An equal amount must be raised by the institutions or persons con- 
cerned. The budget of this sul)division amounts 'to $50,000. See also Extension

York was establish<»d. This s^urvey at that time embraced entomology 
and botany within its scope. In 1857, jointly with the New York 
State Agricultural Society, a buildinj^ was erected for the grow- 
ing collections and called the Geological and Agricultural Hall. In 
1870 it received the name State Museum of Natural History. It is 
now called the New York State Museum. In the course of years the 
space became inadccjuate, so that a portion of the great paleontological 
collection had to be placed in the old State House, the entomological, 
botanical, and ethnological collection in the capitol; but a great new 
building is planned for the State librar}^, which will also accommodate 
the museum collections until a special building shall become necessary 
for them also. There is a prospect that the plan will soon be carried 
out, since present conditions are untenable. 

The annual l)udget amounts to $40,000. The director is State geol- 
ogist. There is also a State paleontologist, a State entomologist, and 
a State botanist. Each of these has one assistant, and there are also 
six other employees. In summer, however, a large number of per- 
sons, mostl}^ young scientists, are appointed in the geological surve3^ 
The collections are open dail}' except Sunday from 9 a. ra. to 5 p. m. 

The State museum and the geological and natural history survey 
have published since 1842: Natural Histor}' of New York, 30 quarto 
volumes on zoology, botany, mineralogy, geology, agriculture, pale- 
ontology (mainly), with man}" plates and maps; annual museum reports 
since 1889; geologist's annual reports since 1881; botanist's anunal 
reports since 1869; entomologist's annual reports since 1882; seven 
volumes of museum bulletins, in 34 numbers, since 1887; three vol- 
umes of museum memoirs since 1889; an economical and geological 
map of the State in two editions, and some handbooks, such as: 5, New 
York State Museum (28 pages); 13, Paleontology (8 pages); 15, Guide 
to Excursions (120 pages); IB, Entomology (12 pages); 17, Geology. 
All these valuable publications relate onl^' to things found in the State 
of New York, and are to-day even more zealously continued. Since 
1836 more than $1,500,000 has been expended on the geological survey. 

The nuiseum is a provincial museum in the best sense of the word, 
which in its way reminds one of the Stuttgart Provincial Museum. 
Its most renowned constituent part is the great geological and paleon- 
tological collection of James Hall, for many years State geologist, who 
had already in the eighties sold a portion of his private possessions, 
the collection of type specimens, to the American Museum of Natural 
History in New York for the sum of $68,725, and whose property left 
at his death, especially rich in fossil invertebrates, will perhaps be 
purchased for the State museum for $60,000. Since the exhibition 
will not be maintained nnich longer in the overcrowded main museum 
and in the other buildings mentioned, I call particular attention only 
to the excellent order prevailing throughout, and mention as especially 
belonging to the j)i-()vin('i:\l collection the great transparent grindings 



89(> REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

of stones; minerals and fossils; the fossil invertebrates; the collection 
of general mineralogy and lithologic g-eology; the selected specimens 
of nuunmals and birds (also the other animals of the State); an excel- 
lent assortment of domestic fowls, with their eggs shown alongside; 
the Gould collection of shells; and, linally, the relief maps of the State 
(1 mile to the int-h). 

The furniture for many years has been of wood. 

As a special feature 1 may mention that schools in the State of 
New York may borrow for a short time small collections for purposes 
of instruction." 

The New York State Museum, established in a spacious up-to-date 
building, will certainly in the future assume a connnanding place 
among the museums of the country. 

NEW YORK STATE LIBRARY. 

The New York State Library is located in the third, fourth, and 
fifth stories of the west wing of the capitol, and ought to atlord space 
for 3,000,000 of 1)ooks. The space has, however, from time to time 
been otherwise occupied, so that now 150,000 volumes have to be 
stored in boxes. The library consists of 300,000 volumes, 125,000 
bound duplicates (over 200,000 unbound), 250,000 manuscripts,'' and 
150,000 pamphlets — a total of over 1,000,000. As already remarked, 
plans have been drawn for a great new building for the liln-ary and 
nmseum combined. The university, together with the librar}^ and the 
other collections, now occupies about one-third of the great capitol 
building, which I must first mention for it holds a place among the 
most remarkable buildings of the United States. 

E. A. Freeman, of Oxford, writes:'' 

But on the whole the American city which struck nie most was Alljany. Rising 
grandly as it does on both sides of the noble Hudson, it suggested some of the ancient 
cities on the Loire. It has the advantage, rather rare in American cities but shanMl 
with Albany by the Federal capital, of having one dominant building. The general 
look of the city carried me so completely into another part of the world that, if any 
one had come up and told me in French, old or new, that the new capitol was "le 
chateau deMonseigneurle due d'Albanie," I could almost have believed him. * * * 
The building has a most successful contour; in its details it is a strange mixture of 
styles, not so much confounded as used side by side. This is accounted for by tlic 
history of the building, and by the employment of more than one architect. * * * 
There are parts which I can not at all admire; but there are other parts, those in 
which the column and round arch are employed, which certainly pleased me as 
much as any modern building that I have seen for a long time. When I say that 
the arches of the senate chamber seemed to me, as far as their general conci'ptiim 
goes, worthy to stand at Ragu.sa, some will understand that I can saj^ no more. 

« See the small handbook of the Home Education Department: Loans to academies, 
p. 4, section of Museum illustrations (1898). With the loans of books and i)lioto- 
graphs mentioned in the chai)ter on traveling libraries these loans of objects are 
connected.

Albany is a hilly city. The hill on which the eapitol is situated 
rises 150 feet above the Hudson, 51 feet al)ove the level of the wide 
main street, which runs up from tiie river. The building is 300 feet 
long, 400 feet wide, and 108 feet high, and will have a tower 800 
feet higJi. (The Reichstag building in Berlin is 395 feet long, 254 feet 
wide, awd 81 feet high.) The inner court is 92 feet long and 137 feet 
wide. A straight staircase, witli four landings and seventy-seven 
steps, the lower sixteen 100 feet wide, extends outward 16G feet from 
the building. The whole occupies 3 acres. It is built of white granite 
in the. free renaissance st^de with wonderful stone masonry.- The 
three staircases are of reddish sandstone, the western being particu- 
larly etiective. Eleven elevators render access easy from one part of 
the l)uilding to another. The basement contains 144 rooms for heat- 
ing, lighting, ventilating, storage, etc. The administrative rooms and 
the governor's magnificent state hall are on the first and second floors. 
These two floors combined include over 120 rooms. On the third 
floor are the magnificent halls of the two houses, the court of ai)peals, 
the historical collection, the lil)rary, together with over 50 rooms. 
The fourth story contains over 40 rooms, among them the offices of 
the university, the entomological, botanical, and ethnological collection 
of the State museum (the latter with rich archeological finds from the 
State of New York and its vicinity). There are also on the fourth 
and fifth floors additional librar}' rooms. The building was begun in 
1867, occupied in 18T9, and finished all to the central tower in 1898. 
Its cost was originally estimated at $4,000,000, but over $25,000,000 
have already been spent upon it. The architects were Fuller, Laver, 
Eidlitz, Richardson, and Perry. 

The library, with its api)llances ])lanned and executed in the most 
minute detail, some of them in beautiful and artistic st>de, is particu- 
larly worth seeing. It is open daih^, except Sunday, from 8 in the 
morning until 10 in the evening; lighted in the evening l\y electricity. 
On Saturdax's. holidays, and from July to September, it closes at 6 p. m. 
It is accessible only from the third story. Until recently the director 
was also secretary of the university. He has under him 31 li])rarians, 
archivists, assistant librarians, assistatits, etc.; 51 employees in all, and 
among them 37 women. The annual ])udget amounts to$75,0(»0. The 
west wing of the capitol may )>e said to form on the third story a 
single roouj 290 feet long, 40 to 00 feet wide, the middle of which is 
occupied ])y the great reading room, 53 feet high, 07 feet long, 40 feet 
wide, wliich is cormected with fi\e additional reading rooms on the 
right and five on the left, all occupied wit!) bookstacks, altogether 
with more than 3oo seats. There are, moreover, two administrative 
rooms. The reading rooms are in pai't adorned with palms and other 
living plants. C>n the window side one may glance along the entire 
suite of lune rooms, 290 feet long, which, together with the fine view 
of the country and the distant mountains Avhich may be enjoyed from

the windows, makes u very pleasiiio- impression. On the foui'th and 
tiftli Hours the same amount of spaeo is at the disposal of the lil)rary, 
making in the two stories combined forty-one additional rooms, for 
the libraiv school, the section of public libraries, the duplicate section, 
the lil)rary museum, the bindery, the children's reading- room, etc. 
The library school has a lecture room in the seventh stor}- of a corner 
pavilion. The muscMun contains a collection relating to library l)uild- 
ings and library administration of several thousand books, pamphlets, 
samples, formularies, models, etc., which aie very exactly classified 
and catalogued. The collection is unique of its kind and extremely 
instructive. " 

In the New York State Library particular attention is paid to law 
(60,000 volumes, princi})ally American codes),'' medicine (25,000 vol- 
umes),'" sociology (3(),000 volumes), instruction (16,000 volumes), his- 
toiy and kindred subjects (40,000 volumes), genealogy, bibliography, 
and Americana, as well as everything relating to the State of New York. 
It contains also a special collection of female authors and of books for 
the blind (of whom there are 5,000 in the State of New York) and for 
children, as well as for the State officials residing in Albany, About 
2,200 periodicals are received by su])scription or donation. 

The building is fireproof. Some rooms contain extinguishers, lines

'' In the excellent annual report of the director for 1898 it is stated on p. 2S that 
the time is near at hand when every prominent lawyer of the State of New York 
will l)e connected with the library by telephone. 

'The report of the director for 1898, p. 35, expresses the opinion that the time 
is at hand when most of the physicians, also, of the State of New York will be con- 
nected by telephone with the library. In both cases a fee of 25 cents per half hour 
is to be paid when more than half an hour is required to give the information called 
for. The medical library is also used in the State of New York as a circulating library 
in the same sense as the organization of the traveling libraries described on a following 
page. 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 809 

of hose, and alarm indicators. Only a part of the floors are covered 
with linoleum. Tlicy are mostly of parquetr}' or brick, with strips 
of carpet. Some of the book rooms proper have iron grates. The 
bookstaf-ks and bookshelves are mostly of iron, the other furniture 
of wood, both strikingly elegant. There have recently been intro- 
duced sheet-iron waste-paper baskets with covers, because one of the 
ordinary waste-paper baskets was once set on tire. The folio volumes 
lie in their stacks on rollers, like those mentioned in connection with 
Columbia University. The cases for maps and photographs are con- 
structed in a very practical manner. The separate drawers drop when 
drawn out to an angle of 75 degrees, so that the sheets may not only 
be conveniently examined as if on a slanting desk, but may also be 
placed for closer inspection- on a lattice which covers the drawer. 
The books are bound in twelve colors, corresponding to the principal 
languages of the globe; for example, black represents German. This 
applies to all books which ai'e l)ound for the library or in the library 
itself, and makes it easier to find them quickly. Current periodicals 
are kept in pasteboard boxes. Movable stacks for transporting books 
are constructed in a very practical manner. 

For the library proper two extra elevators arc in use. They are 
installed in a very ingenious manner, provided with electric bells and 
telephone. There are also staircases, partly of iron, partly of wood. 

The arrangements for the care and use of the books show the great- 
est skill and attention to every detail. 

The arrangement of the entire libi'ary is strictly ac<'ording to the 
system devised by IMelvil Dewey, who has been director since 1888. 
According to his ingenious decimal system, the figure signs contain 
the title of the book in a nutshell, and the books are arranged strictly 
according to the tigure series. Each book has, therefore, its definite 
place and its prescribed sign. The system, which is followed else- 
where only in Columl)ia University and in smaller libraries, has here 
completely demonstrated its value. The card catalogues are made 
very accurate. The}^ have in America extremely practical arrange- 
ments for such card catalogues. Even the price of the book is given 
on the later printed catalogue cards, which are furnished by the 
Library Bureau in Boston. Up to the present time there are over 
300,000 cards in use, the greater portion arranged according to authoi's. 
Author and sul)ject cards are kept separate, but in cases standing- 
side by side; the author catalogue is in l-iO drawers, each containing 
1,200 cards; the subject catalogue is in 112 drawers. They are both 
made in duplicate. There is also an alphabetical list of all the authors 
represented in the library. In the accession catalogues one ma}' find 
all possible data relating to any l)ook. 

The library publishes the following: Annual reports since 181J>(the 
eighty-first, of 1898, has 105 pages and is illustrated); bulletins with 
reports since 181U; additions to the bulletins since 181H>, -1 numbers;

mountain-side library, young people's libraries, a library for the blind, 
etc., in 56 and more numbers; annual lists of best l)ooks since 1895, 
and others; also many historical publications. In 1898, all told, 
365,000 copies of such pu])lications appeared. 

This is further distinguished from mau}^ other libraries by the divi- 
sions for traveling libraries, exchange of duplicates, and the library 
school. 

Tr(welin<j Ubrarles division. — The special traveling libraries division, 
which has existed since 1892, contains about 45,000 volumes. Lots of 
25, 50, 75, or 100 of the best books are lent for six months to pu))lic 
libraries, to any twent3^-rive taxpayers who meet in one place, to 
schools, associations for instruction (extension centers), study clubs, 
reading circles, as well as to any other organizations which are regis- 
tered as such at the university and need books, for which security is 
to l)e given, and from 50 cents to $4 each is paid for transportation 
expenses. One hundred volumes are, for example, divided into riction 
(22 per cent), history (18 per cent), biology (13 per cent), travels (11 
per cent), science and useful arts (9 per cent), sociology (5 per cent), 
religion and ethics (4 per cent), rine arts (3 i)er cent), other literature 
(15 per cent). There are forty-one such miscellaneous sets, several 
of which have been duplicated ten times. The percentage of each sub- 
ject represented is, of course, not always the same in the different sets. 
There are, moreover, seventeen collections of 25 or 50 volumes each on 
special subjects, such as political econom}^ finance, agriculture, French 
history, history of the United States, literature, etc. For these sets 
the best books in the English language are selected. There are also 
collected and lent out small libraries which relate not only to a spe- 
cial subject, but which also include what is more remotely connected 
with this subject and which therefore encourage the student to con- 
sider and stud}" any particular question from every point of view. 
Such assortments of books are called environment libraries. Teachers, 
study clubs, and reading circles may themselves select books from 
the lists to a total value of $100 (combined libraries) and take them 
on the same conditions. For purposes of instruction teachers may 
also get as many copies of one and the same book as they may need 
for their pupils. The average price of each book may be placed at 
al)out ^\. The books are sent out in handsome locked oak cases, 
which cost about $14 for every hundred volumes. Exact statistics 
regarding their use are returned to the library, which incloses in each 
book a card for this purpose. In 1899, 557 series were sent to 420

hooks, which passed thi"oug"h the hands of a lar<>"e number of readers. 
In spite of their being instructive I can not here go into details with 
statistics on this subject.^' A writer on this peculiar and, so far as I 
know, unique arrangement sa^'s:^ 

The State of New York i-an well afford thiK offer of books to her citizens. The 
plan is at once generous and, in the highest sense, profitaljle, and is confidently 
commended to the consideration of other States. 

In a like manner the State library lends from its great collection 
for purposes of instruction, photographs of paintings, portraits, build- 
ings, and the like, including glass and frames, when desired. It also 
sends out wall pictures with magic lanterns.'' A small fee is charged 
to cover the expense of shippage. Plate 12 represents a room of the 
librar}' where such pictures are hung. 

The division of exchanges^ a peculiar establishment, is also connected 
with the library. There are 350,000 duplicates. Every libraiy of the 
State of New York, every school, everv' lecture circle, eveiy study club, 
every reading societ}^, which is registered as such at the university 
and is organized according to the prescribed rules (we saw above that 
there are now in that State 1,511 such centers, large and small), may 
deliver to the university books for which they have no further use. 
In return for these they receive others of equal value, according to 
the -choice of the recipient. About 20,000 volumes and pamphlets are 
now annually exchanged in this manner. This may, therefore, be 
regarded as an exchange book trade, which conducts its business with- 
out expense to the persons interested, who do not even have to bear 
the expense of transportation. All the surplus copies of the govern- 
nient publications of the State of New York are also placed in this 
duplicate collection, as well as the surplus stock of the works, books, 
pamphlets, handbooks, bulletins, reports, etc., printed b}^ the univer- 
sity itself, for free distribution. Of the latter, hundreds of thousands

Library school. — It is now almost a ruh' in the United States that 
everj'one who seeks employment in a li))i'ary shall have attended one 
of the seven library schools which are located in Albany (New York 
State Library), Brooklyn (Pratt Institute), Philadelphia (Drexel Insti- 
tute), Champaign (Illinois State Library School, University of Illi- 
nois), Washington (Columbian University), Madison (University of 
Wisconsin), Los Angeles, California, Amherst, Massachusetts, and 
Cleveland, Ohio. The four latter are only summer schools. Regular 
lectures on Inbliography and library science are also delivered in a 
number of universities and colleges (Bowdoin, California, Colorado, 
Cornell, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Wellesley). 

The first school of the kind to which all others are more or less 
indebted for their existence was founded in 1887 at Columbia Uni- 
versity, New York, by Melvil Dewey, who was at that time director 
of the university library, and removed to Albany in 1889. It includes 
a faculty of ten instructors, each of whom represents and teaches par- 
ticular branches of library science. Six of the instructors are women, 
an example of the great attraction this branch has for women in 
America. The special l)ranches are : Library economy, cataloguing, 
lending system, reading, ))ibliography, classification, history of li])ra- 
ries, advanced cataloguing, reference work, binding, library printing 
and editing, dictionary cataloguing, library building, indexing. The 
number of pupils is limited to 50. For admission an examination or 
the possession of a certain college degree is required. Pupils under 
20 years of age are not received. The course is for two years, and 
lasts for thirty -eight consecutive weeks in the year. The weeks con- 
sist of five working days of eight hours each. Every pupil receives a 
table with all lil)rary appurtenances, at which he may work from 8 
o'clock in the morning until 10 in the evening. The tuition fee for 
two years amounts to from $80 to $100. The expense of one year's 
attendance at the library school in Albany, including tuition fee, room, 
board, books, official study, travels, etc., amounts to from $325 to $625. 

Instruction consists of the following: (1) Lectures by prominent 
librarians, publishers, booksellers, printers, bookbinders, and the like, 
and by the instructors of the school. (2) Reading and reports from 
books belonging to the special library school on the subjects of study. 
(3) Solving of difficult problems relating to cataloguing, bibliography, 
aids to readers, and the like, with debates. (4) Seminary exercises. 
(5) Practical training in the State library itself, as well as in the small 
libraries of tlie city. (0) Visits for the purpose of study to the libra- 
ries of New York, Boston, etc., to the great publishers, printing offices, 
bookbinderies, art institutes, bookstores, book auctions, secondhand

V)ookstores, etc. (T) ()l)ject lessons: Evervtliing' referred to in the 
lectures is, when possil)le, exhibited in the original or in models, plans, 
or drawings. Thus, for example, one may see ten dill'erent kinds of 
American and European lil)rary book stacks in jnactical use beside one 
another, and by actual trial become accpiainted with the best. Differ- 
ent portions of the library are tittcd up according to different models, 
in order that the students may learn ])y comparison. (8) Finally, the 
pupils are made acquainted with the alioye-described educational 
methods of the New York State University, as they are in many respects 
related to library interests. 

In the first year the following subjects are treated: Exercises in cata- 
loguing for beginners, elementary bibliography, accession department 
work, dictionary cataloguing for beginners, classifying for beginners, 
shelf work or disposition of books, systems of lending, and of ])ook- 
binding. For students of the first and second years together, course 
of reading, scope and founding of libraries, goyermnent and service, 
regulations for readers, library buildings, reading, literary methods 
and book making, library bookkeeping, librar}^ museum, personal col- 
lections. In the second year, are taught bibliography for advanced 
students, reference work, exercises in cataloguing for advanced stu- 
dents, dictionary cataloguing for advanced students, classifying for 
advanced students, history of libraries, and original bibliography. 
Finally, a dissertation is required, and then, after an examination 
has been passed, a degree is conferred (bachelor, master, or doctor of 
librar}" science). The best scholars receive scholarships and fellow- 
ships, up to $500, and may look forward to an earh' appointment in 
Albany, Up to October, 1898, the library school had filled 6-i2 posi- 
tions with its pupils. Summer courses are also held during the holidays; 
and private instruction and instruction by means of correspondence 
are also given." 

The existence of such schools explains the advanced condition of 
librarA^ science in America.* 

It is recognized ''that the influences of the New York State Li])rary 
are as yet the strongest that exist to raise the standard of librarian-

^ In Germany a chair for library science (" Buch-und Schriftwesen ") exists only 
in Gottingen and Leipsic. (In Leipsic, however, the professor does not lecture.) 
Other lectures on library science in German universities are s})aring and more of the 
archeologic-historical kind. In Prussia, after a voluntary service of two yeare in a 
library, an examination must be passed before appointment, but not in Saxony and 
Bavaria. The German library employees are, however, mostly scientists. In Amer- 
ica there are but few in this ]>articular branch, while among us there is rather a lack 
of si)ecially educated mmor employees. I think tliat more attention should be paid 
to library science in the (ierman universities than is now the case. If liliraries are 
intellectual eating houses, care should be taken that the dishes are well served.

send every book where it will do the most good. I left this institu- 
tion carrving- with me the highest respect for its director's talent for 
organization. 

The University of the State of New York contributes an astonishing 
amount to the universal distribution of knowledge in a manner quite 
peculiar to itself. I am convinced that a great future lies before it. 
Its work, however, has already received the greatest recognition, as 
shown by the circumstance that at the Paris Exposition of this 3^ear 
(lOOO) it received the remarkable numl)er of three first prizes ("grand

lications, a second to the library specially for the establishment of 
traveling libraries and the home-education department, and a third to 
the college department for technical education.

8. BUFFALO PUBLIC LIBRARY. 

In the year 1836 the Young Men's Association of the City of Buffalo 
was founded as a nuinicipal library. In 1885 a house of its own was 
erected, the Buffalo Library, which, in 1897, was reorganized as 
the Buffalo Public Librar3^ The building, also called Library and 
Art Building, is massive and fireproof, in the Romanesque style 
of architecture, with triangular ground plan, about 300 b}' 250 by 175 
feet in size, and cost nearl}'^ $375,000 — about the same amount as the 
site. Situated on Lafaj^ette place in the midst of the l)usiness houses 
of a great industrial city, the exterior is already badl}- discolored by 
smoke. It is now occupied by the following: 

In the basement, the museum of the Buffalo Society of Natural 
Sciences; on the raised ground floor and the second stor}', the public 
library; also on the second floor, the collections of the Buffalo Fine 
Arts Academy and the Buffalo Society of Artists; on the third floor, 
th&collections of the Bufi'alo Historical Societ3\ Within a short time, 
however, the entire building will be given up to the librar^^ The 
Natural History Museum will secure a home of its own from a bequest 
of about $250,000. The Art Academy, which was founded in 1862, 
will, together with the Society of Artists, with which the Art Students' 
League is also connected, move into the Albright Art Gallery, now m 
course of construction,* for which $500,000 are to be expended by 
private individuals. Finally, the collections of the Historical Society, 
which was also founded in 1862, were to be exhibited in connection with

the Piin-Aiiierican Exposition in Buffalo in 1901/' As all this would 
make a radical change in the museums mentioned, 1 limit myself to a 
few words concerning- the Natural Histor}'^ Museum, and speak of the 
lihrar^^ in a somewhat more detailed manner/' 

MUSEUM OF THE BUFFALO SOCIETY OF NATURAL SCIENCES. 

The Natural Histor}^ Society of Buffalo was founded in IS^Il. It is 
under the formal control of the University of the State of New York, 
in Albany, and its object is the advancement and the study of the 
natural sciences. Lately it has devoted itself particularly to making- 
collections of the local fauna and flora, and for this purpose is divided 
into fourteen sections. There is a president at the head of the institu- 
tion. In 189S it had at its disposal an income of $3,500, of which $625 
were derived from membership fees, $250 appropriated by the city, 
$1,250 interest money, etc. 

The present director of the museum is a woman (conchologist). 
The different sections are presided over by professional scientists or 
amateurs, who serve without paj^. The best parts of the collection 
are the minerals, the fossils, the shells, and the her])arium. A larger 
series of deformed mound skulls should be noted. The museum con- 
tains, all told, about 60,000 natural history specimens; the library, 
4,300 books. It is open daily from 9 to 5, Sundays from 2 to 5; 
admission free. The number of visitors last Aear was 105,000. The 
society has 250 members, who pay $2 or $5, and 160 corresponding 
meml)ers. The publications are as follows: Annual reports (the one 
of 1898, with 18 pages; the earlier reports were longer, but none 
appeared in 1899), bulletins with illustrations (6 volumes); see also 
'•charter and bv-laws * * * together with the will of Dr. George 
PI Hayes * * * 1890." Regular lectures are delivered and meet- 
ings of the society' are held in one of the larger rooms. The Buffalo 
Field Naturalists' Club of the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences, 
founded in 1880, is affiliated with it. There is also a Buffalo Micro- 
scopical Club, founded in 1876, which publishes Transactions. 

While the unfavorable exhibition space in the basement, which is 
only 14 feet hig-h, and the limited means at the disposal of the societ}^ 
have hitherto prevented it from displaying its already considerable 
collection to the best advantage, it can hardly be doubted that the 
Natural History Museum of Buffalo will, in its new location, receive

collections. For information concerning the Historical Society the Annual Report 
for 1898 (104 pages, with illustrations) may be consulted. The object of this society 
is to study, collect, and preserve everything relating to the history of the western 
part of the State of New York and to the city of Buffalo in partit'ular.

an impetus corresponding to the importance of this populous and wide- 
awake city of the future, to its handsome and favoral)le geographical 
position, and to the patriotism of its intelligent inhabitants, who will 
not remain behind other cities of the Union. 



The main library is arranged on iron bookstacks with wooden 
shelves in a hall 164 by 47 feet and 21 feet high. This hall is located 
on the raised ground floor, which contains several handsome, spacious, 
well-lighted reading rooms, as does also the second story. The 
library is excellently fitted up, though not with the elegance of the 
Columbia University library in New York or the State library in 
Albany. Under municipal control, as well as under the supervision of 
the University of the State of New York, in Albany, it is governed by 
a board of directors, consisting of 10 members, with a president and 
a superintendent, who is the actual director. It derives its principal 
income from the city, amounting to four-lifths of four one-hundredths 
of 1 per cent of the whole taxable property of the cit}^ of Buffalo. 
That amounted to $8,250 in 1899.« Its total income is $90,750. Of 
this sum, $40,500 w^ere needed for the salaries of 79 employees. Sixty- 
seven are employed in the library itself, 12 in the building, including 
45 women. One of the higher female employees receives $900 
a 3^ear. 

There are 150,000 volumes in the library, together with 10,000 pieces 
of music, etc. There are subscribed to, or received as donations, 285 
periodicals and 73 newspapers. The increase for 1899 amounted to 
21,000 volumes, which cost $21,725, and 1,500 donations. Nearly 
seven thousand dollars was needed for binding. The books are cata- 
logued and arranged according to the Dewey system, which works 
excellently. There are three special catalogues in use: (1) The dic- 
tionary catalogue for the public, which includes the author, title, and 
subject cards in one alphabetical series; (2) an author and title card 
catalogue for the employees; and (3) a shelf list. The number of 
cards of these three catalogues are for each book about four, two, one, 
respectively; therefore for each book about seven. The dictionary 
catalogue is well advanced, and replaces a subject catalogue, which is 
still in use, and which is a shelf list with many references. 

The entire force of employees follow with the greatest zeal the one 
aim to make the library as useful as possible for popular instruction. 



a Boston, with 550,000 inhabitants, in 1897, in a similar manner, gave for like pur- 
poses, $275,000; Chicago, with 1,700,000 inhabitants, $250,000; Philadelphia, witli 
1,200,000 inhabitants, $125,000; Cleveland, with 385,000, $75,000; St. Louis, with 
650,000, 175,000; Pittsburg, with 290,000, $67,500; Indianapolis, with 185,000, $42,000, 
etc. In nearly every Massachusetts town the dog tax is devoted to the supi)()rt of 
the public Hbrary. "The more bark, the more book" (American Review of Rericir.%

conse(}uentl y the gToate.st imag-inable liberalit}' prevails, together with 
exemphiry and painstaking order. An}- resident of Butialo may bor- 
row any book for fourteen days free. A neglect to follow any of the 
rules is punished by tines, which in 1899 reached a total of $2,750." 
The librar}" is open dail}" from 8.30 or 9 a. m. to 9 p. m. (with electric 
lighting); also on Saturda3^s and holidays from 11 a. m. to 9 p. m., 
I)ut on these da3's books are not loaned out. The children's depart- 
ment is open on school days from 2.30 p. m. until or 7 p. m., and 
on Saturdays and holida3^s, that is to sav% days on which the schools 
are closed, from 9 a. m. until 6 or 7 p. m.; Sunda\^ from 2 p. m. until 
6 p. m. 

Each room has direct telephone communication with ever}^ other 
room. The building being fireproof, it is thought sufficient to depend 
upon vigilance without any other precautionary measures. The heat- 
ing is by steam. The engines are located in a separate house. 

A characteristic feature of this library, which, indeed, exists else- 
where, though only in a few places, is the open-shelf department. A 
collection of 17,000 volumes, in wall cases in a room 70 by 30 feet 
large, is here, under supervision, directly accessible to the public, not 
only to read on the spot, but particularly to choose for home use. 
Anyone can go right up to the shelves and take the books out. This is 
not a so-called reference library, such as every important lil)rary pos- 
sesses in reference works, dictionaries, and the like (there is also sucii 
a reference librarj' of 2,000 volumes), but the section was established in 
order to afford the reader an opportunity to select the books them- 
selves instead of by title only. This method is so popular that in 
1899 each book was loaned out on an average sixteen times. The col- 
lection also includes German (S77) and French l)ooks. Of the 17,000 
volumes, 10,000 relate to fiction. 

In 1899, 888,000 volumes, all told, were loaned out to 57,000 per- 
sons in three hundred and live days,* of which 67 per cent were fic- 

f' A book may l)e taken out for fourteen daj's and once renewed for an equal length 
of time. Some new books are lent for one week only. Whoever keeps a book over 
time is Hned two cents a da}'. The comparatively large total of fines is composed 
almost entirely of fines for one, two, or three days. Compensation must be made 
for damages, and lost books must be replaced. Whoever fails to meet his obligations 
receives no more l)ooks. 

In the New York State Lil)rary at All)any (previously referred to) there is a fine of 
one cent a day for keeping a book over time. For taking a book out of the library 
without having it entered the fine is 50 cents. The rules are here very detailed in 
their conception (see Eighty-first Annual Rei)ort of the New York State Library, 
1899, pp. 63-67). Formerly in a small town of Ontario, Canada, a borrower was fined 
a half a farthing per shilling of its value for every drop of tallow which lie allowed 
to fall on a book. This rule is so curious tliat I can not refrain from, mentioning it. 

''The Boston Public Library lent out 1,200,000 books in 1898, the public library 
in Chicago 1,P.00,000 (1899, 1,700,000), that in Philadelphia 1,600,000, that m Cleve-

tion,'^ 8 per cent literature, 6 per cent history, 3i per cent travels, 3 
per cent natural sciences, etc. As many as 684,000 volumes were 
borrowed from the main library, and 204,000 from the seven deliver}^ 
stations in the city, which have been established for the convenience 
of the public, or indirectly through schools or travelino- libraries (see 
below). In the reading- room, moreover, 37,000 volumes were called 
for from the main librar3\ Since the opening of the pu])lic library, 
out of 2,000,000 volumes loaned, about 1,000, to the value of $725, 
have been lost in two years and a half; the present rules, however, 
encourage the hope that the number will diminish with time. Oth(n' 
special arrangements are the following: 

Series of books are loaned to schools for a considerable time, accord- 
ing to the choice of the teacher. The children take these books home 
with them. Thus in 1899, 22 primary and secondar}^ schools, with 
358 classes, received 153,000 volumes and 5,000 pictures. Further, 
well-selected series, called traveling libraries, are likewise loaned to 
certain institutions. Thus in 1899, 127 series, with over 1,000 books, 
were loaned to 28 fire-engine houses, to 7 police stations, and to 5 hos- 
pitals (for the employees), which in all brought 8,600 into circulation. 

Especial care is also bestowed upon a children's library, which is 
much frequented. It is for children under 11 years of age. When they 
come with dirty hands they are sent into the wash room. In a pleas- 
ant, well-lighted room, with pictures on the walls and adorned with 
growing plants and cut flowers, 9,000 books are displa3'ed in open wall 
cases, freely accessible, under proper supervision, to everybody. Four 
thousand of these books are fiction. In 1899, 115,000 volumes were 
lent out of this department for home use. Even colored picture 
books are lent to small children. On Saturday mornings and Sun- 
day afternoons the assistant in charge spends an hour reading to the 
children or telling them stories. At Christmas time an exhibition, of 
l)ooks Avhich are suitable for presents is held and printed price lists 
tire distri})uted; for example, see List of Books recommended as 
appropriate for Christmas (iifts to young Folks (November 28, 1898, 
6 pages), in which is noted the age for which each book is suitable. 
A library assistant is in attendance to give advice on tiiis matter to 
visitors. There are also printed reading lists — for example, Ameri- 
can History for young Folks (4 pages). 

About once a month lists of the new acquisitions are posted on bulle- 
tins and larger lists are from time to time printed; for example, " No. 
17, July 1, 1899, recent additions: History and biography, sociologj', ■ 
science and arts, philosophy and religion, general literature, fiction" 

«The fact must not be lost sight of that such books maybe read much more 
(luickly than others, and that only good ones are procured. See explanatory 
remarks on this subject by Herbert Putnam, North American Review, CLXVl, 1898, 
p. 664.

pul)lished, for example, Good books on Electricity for popular Read-

Buffalo Public Library (149 pages, on handmade paper), July, 1891>. 

Every year there appears an annual report, the third one for 181>1>, 
with 55 pages and a map of the city, on which all delivery stations, 
also the schools, fire houses, and police stations, to which the libi'ary 
gives books, are designated in red. The last annual report of the 
Buffalo Library appeared in 1897, as the sixty-first (with 90 pages), 
and the last annual report of the Young Men's Association, in 1886, 
as the fiftieth (with 51 pages). The first report of the i^ufl'alo Library 
counts, therefore, from the fifty-first, while the public library since 
its establishment in 1897 has numbered its reports from one, and states 
on the title page that it is at the same time such and such a 3'ear of 
the Buffalo Library. The third was the sixty-fourth 3'ear. 

Branch libraries are now being established in the city. 

With the wise administration which we have described, and the active, 
constantly increasing patronage of the people on the one hand and the 
prospective great development of the city and the devotion of its citi- 
zens on the other, a much wider sphere of activity and a future rich in 
blessings may confidently be predicted for the Buffalo Public Library." 

"In the State of New York there were, in 1898, 408 pnl)Hc Hbraries with a ratio of 
1,800,000 books to 7,000,000 inhabitants; altogether 98;i Hbraries with 5,400,000 
books (Extension Bulletin, No. 27, University of the State of New York, 1899, pp. 
48 and 50). 

In the State of Massachusetts, in 1899, there were for 3,000,000 inhabitants 344 
public libraries with 3,-700,000 hooks, each of which were lent on an average more 
than twice. During the last lifty years $8,000,000 in cash have been donated or 
be(iueathed for the buildings and books, besides i>resents of books and other collec- 
tions. In 1899 only 7 towns with less than one-half per cent of the total poj>u- 
lation were without a public library. In 1895 Massachusetts had in all its libraries 
combined over 7,000,000 books, to the value of !5!10,000,0()0 (9th Report Massachu- 
setts Free Public Library Committee, (luoted in American Ixei'lcir of licrieivs, Sep-

In the State of New Hampshire public libraries, like public schools, are obligatory. 

In the United States, with its 70,000,000 iuhubitants, there were, in 1896, 4,020 
public libraries, society libraries, and school libraries of over 1,000 volumes each, 
a total of 38,500,000 books aud pamphlets, of which 2 libraries had over half a mil- 
lion books, 4 between 300,000 and 500,000, 28 between 100,000 and 300,000, (19

libraries with over 3,000 volumes there were 627, witli a total of 9,000,000 books, 
which were loaned out for home use on an average three times a year (United States 
Bureau of Kducation No. 232, 1897). 



410 KEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

IV.— CHICAGO. « 

Chicago, on the sliore of Lake Michigan, is the metropolis of the 
State of Illinois, which, with a population of 4,800,000, ranks as the 
third largest State in the United States. In 1890 Chicago numbered 
1,700,000 inhabitants, a population surpassed b^^ but one city in the 
entire country. In 1837 the place was still in the midst of a marsh, 
with only 4,000 residents. In 1871, when the population had grown 
to 300,000, the city was almost blotted out by tire, so that we might 
be justitied in dating its real foundation from that time. 

Its architecture exhibits more evidence of an American national 
style than is seen in the other great cities of the eastern part of the 
country. In originality, in youthful vigor, and in the astonishing 
rapidity of its development Chicago excels all, with the prospect of a 
yet greater future. The motto "I will" is often found on the alle- 
gorical tigure of the city, and the words appear to me most suitable 
to indicate the energetic, aspiring character of its citizens. 

9. FIELD COLUMBIAN MUSEUM. 

The Field Colum])ian Museum is a private association, established 
in August, 181>3, during the World's Columbian Exposition, under the 
name of the "Columbian Museum of Chicago" for "art, archaeology, 
science, and history."''' In June, 1894, it was rechristened in honor of 
Mr. Marshall Field, of the immense wholesale and retail establish- 
ment of Marshall Field & Co., who, immediately after its foundation, 
presented to the uniseum $1,000,000, on the condition that a sum equal 
to half that amount should be given b}' others. This condition was 
fulfilled within a few weeks by the generosity of some 1,200 persons, 
who subscribed from $1 to $100,000 each. A fund amounting to about 
$250,000 from these gifts is invested. 

The chiefs of the different departments of the Columbian Exposi- 
tion, especially those of mining, metallurgy, anthropology (in its 
widest sense), and transportation, had sought, in accordance with a 
plan devised as long ago as 1891, to bring together materials for a 
permanent museum. In this enterprise Prof. F. W. Putnam, now of 
the Peabody Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was especiall}" 
active, and at the breaking up of the exposition there was a most 
favorable opportunity for obtaining all kinds of collections. '-' This

''The corporation was especially founded "for the accumulation and dissemination 
of knowledge and the preservation and exhibition of objects illustrating art, archie- 
ology, science, and history." 

e For instance, there were bought, at the close of the exposition, the collections of 
Paraguay, Peru, Java, and Samoa, as well as those of the dealers in natural history, 
Hagenbeck, of Hamburg, and Ward, of Rochester, New York, the last costing 
$100,000. Large collections were given l)y Russia, .Japan, Corea, Ceylon, .Siaui, 
British India, Mexico, Central America, and all the States of South America.

peculiar genesis explains tlie vast scope of this Chicago institution, 
perhaps eni])racino- too wide a tield, as we shall see, and accounts 
for the astonishing repletion of its overcrowded cases, as well as 
for the fact that the museum, in true Chicago stj'le, could, from its 
very beginning, claim a place among the leading museums of the 
world, an apparently solitary example in the history of such institu- 
tions. There was also the extraordinary advantage of having available 
among the exposition buildings one of more substantial construction 
than the rest, the one provided for the exhibit of line arts. It is a 
wide-spreading structure in Ionic style of the Spanish t3^pe, designed 
by Charles B. Atwood. It has about 6 acres of ground space avail- 
able for exposition purposes, or almost double the space of the old 
market at Dresden, and stands ])v itself in Jackson Park, an area 
of 521 acres, immediateh" on the shore of Lake Michigan, which 
is nearly as large as the Kingdom of Bavaria. The main front of 
the building faces north toward the citj^; the south front (Plate 15) 
faces a large pond; the east side is toward the lake. Its orienta- 
tion is of no importance to the collections within as the building is 
lighted throughout from above. The ground plan (fig. 32) shows two 
naves, 110 feet wide, 77 high, and 556 and 333 feet long, crossing 
each other at right angles. To these are adjoined transverse and longi- 
tudinal halls. A central rotunda is 140 feet high. There is annexed 
to the north front on either side, a pavilion 223 feet long b}" 133 feet 
wide, divided into separate rooms. The building with its classical 
style presents an imposing effect from a distance, but on near approach 
its beauty is marred by the dilapidated aspect of the exterior, for the 
white covering of the brick wall is here and there damaged and broken 
away. The simple division of the interior is very favorable for finding 
one's wa3nn the extensive building. The naves are provided with galler- 
ies (fig. 33), but the ordinary character of an exhibition hall, in which 
most heterogeneous objects are placed near together,'* generall}^ prevails, 
and there is lacking that intimate charm which can only be afforded by 
a building designed for its special purpose. Although it would be easy 
to imagine a better building (the American Museum of Natural History 
in New York, already described, being incomparably l)etter) yet there 
are in Europe new museum buildings nuuh inferior to that of the Field 
Columbian Museum. Its principal faults are defective sk3"lighting in 
some portions and insecurity from fire because of the large amount of 
interior woodwork. It is to be hoped that it may continue to be spared 
the disaster of a conflagration. The extraordinar}^ quantity of mate- 

« For instance, a few steps from the collection of shells there stands furniture 
belonging to the Danish jwet, Hans Christian Andersen, and also stocking and glove 
machines from Chemnitz dating from 1884. This must somewhat perplex the lay 
public, irrespective of the fact that the gri'en ui)holstere(l sofa with two similar stools, 
even though it belonged to a celebrated poet, impresses a visitor strangely in a 
nuiseum of hiuii standard.

Chicago would thereby ])e doing an admirable deed." With such a 
condition of affairs and with the rapid development of everything in 
that country, it is not worth while to give a detailed description of the

the tire service, which is unexcelled in careful precautions. 

No one is allowed to smoke even in the vicinity of the building, and 
within it almost no tire is permitted. When, for example, a prepara- 
tor needs tire for his work, permission must be had from the director 
and the tire is managed with extreme precautions. All woodwork is 
coated with tireproof paint. In some instances, cases containing objects, 

a Quite recently (1903) it is understood that Mr. Marshall Field has given |1 0,000,000

ployed were previously in the service during the exposition, and may 
be considered as veteran tiremen. The electric conduits in the l)uild- 
ing, which supply -ID arc lamps, are carefully inspected daily and put 
in order. In each of the four wings of the principal building the 
following apparatus is distri])uted: 2,500 feet of hose upon racks and 
reels, together svith a hose carriage; -i 25-foot tire ladders; T tire poles 
of various lengths, with iron points and hooks to ])reak through ceil- 
ings or to pull them down; 2(1 tire axes and 145 tiiv ])uckets. There 
are 8 tire hydrants within the principal building and 12 on the exter- 
ior, also 4 hose reels upon the galleries and I in each of the two side 
l)uildings. '^Phere are also ])rovided and distributi^d 1 large chemical

hose, to reach every portion oi the building; 42 chemical hand extin-

giii.shers, each of 4 oallons capacity, and 148 tilled ))uckets with auto- 
matic covers — KK) of them on the roof, tilled with about 442 j;allons 
of water. There is also available the special high-water pressure 
system of the park, and detinite arrangements are made with the city 
tire department for such extra service as may l)e needed. Fourteen 
tire alarms are distributed throughout the building, which give sig- 
nals, both in the room of the tire watch and in the distant room of the 
director. The offices in the upper story are provided with a mer- 
curial automatic tire-alarm system. Upon the roof a series of mer- 
curial thermostats have been placed which, at a temperature of 175° 
F,, give the signal of alarm in the room of the tire watch, so that the 
situation of the tire is at once known." 

On account of the isolated location of the nuiseum, everything that 
ingenuity can devise has been done to diminisli the danger from tire, 
liable on account of the combustible nature of the building and furni- 
ture, and to meet accidents that may occur. I have described this 
svstem in such detail to show how careful people have })ecome in a 
city which has burned down within the memory of man. But with us, 
too, just as much care is desirable, for it is nuich more important to 
prevent a lire in museums, or to stop it wdien tirst started, than to 
extinguish it witii the aid of the tire department, for the water thrown 
])y engines is as destructive as the tire itself. A proof of this was 
given in January, 1901, at the tire in the old pathological institute of 
the Berlin University, in charge of Professor Virchov, where valuable 
material was destroyed ])y the w^ater thrown to extinguish the fire. 

It impresses a German to find in America that generally no light- 
ning rods are in use — none at all, for example, on this museum. In 
Saxonv there are very stringent police regulations in this regard. On 
inquiry about this matter in the United States I was told that the elec- 
tric wires served the same purpose.^ Considering the great dryness 
which exists in summer, together with the high degree of heat in the 
United States— I myself, on September 5, 1S;»9, at 5 p. m., endured a 
temperature of 98° F. in Chicago^ — I believe that in spite of all the 
careful precautionary regulations, the expensive collections of the 
Columbian Museum are seriously endangered in this building, and I 

« For security against burglary a watchman in the halls of gems, as well as one at 
the entrance, must give assurance of his presence by a bell signal every (juarter of 
an hour. There are also electric alarms in the same hall. 

'' I much doubt the accuracy of this view, for the protecting effect of lightning 
rods can not, in many cases, be denied, though nowhere in the United States are 
they retiuired l)y police regulations, and what is more to the point, the tire insurance 
companies do not demand them; while on the other hand, mortgagees frequently 
demand security of l)uildingH against cyclones. 

c This is blood heat. The highest observed temperature within a short time before 
was 100° F., on July 16 and 17, 1887. This was first exceeded on July 11, 1901, when 
it was 102° F.

would congratulate the city .should it become able to place this collec- 
tion in a tireproof structure. 

When the museum was established the following seven departments 
were provided: Anthropology, geology, botany, zoology (exclusive of 
ornithology), ornithology, industrial arts, with two sections of trans- 
portation and railroads, and Columbus memorials. In 1896 there was 
added to this the department of monographic collections with the two 
sections, that of printing and graphic arts and musical instruments. 
In 1897, however, the departments were reduced to five: Anthropol- 
ogy, botany, geology, zoology (exclusive of ornithology), and orni- 
thology. Under anthropology is now embraced eveiything that was 
formerly in anthropology, industrial arts, transportation, railroads, 
Columbus memorials, printing and graphic arts, and musical instru- 
ments. That there exists any essential reason for creating a depart- 
ment of ornithology distinct from zoology is not apparent. The 
anthropological department occupies the entire east win^ (1-18, eth- 
nography; 81-94, America), the entire central pavilion (Europe, Asia, 
Africa, and America and statues in the rotunda), a portion of the west 
wing (30-33 industrial arts), and the entire east portion (transporta- 
tion). The botanical department occupies all the galleries (fig. 33); 
the geological department the entire west pavilion and two halls of 
the western wing (35-36); and the zoological, including the ornitho- 
logical department, the greater portion, or two-thirds, of the west 
wing (19-27, 95-108). The installation is mentioned somewhat more 
in detail in the legend to fig. 32. 

The administrative organization is as follows: A board of 15 trus- 
tees, 6 of whom constitute a quorum, is divided into four committees, 
executive, finance, l)uilding, and audit. To this board are subject the 
salaried officials of the museum, at whose head stands the director 
who, up to this time, has not been a trained scientific man. Each 
section has a curator. Besides this, the anthropological and zoolog- 
ical sections have each an assistant curator, and the geological two 
assistant curators. The assistant of the anthropological section has 
special charge of ethnology. One of the geological assistants has 
charge of paleontology. There are altogether nine professionally' 
trained employees, a number entirely insufficient for this large niuseum. 
Finally, there is a librarian, a recorder, and 79 subordinates, including 
2 collectors, 1 osteologist, 3 taxidermists, 20 preparators, writers, ste- 
nographers, etc., 2 modelers, 1 inspector of ))uildings, 4 engineers, 6 
cabinetmakers, 4 painters, 12 doorkeepers, 5 laborers, 16 attendants, 
and 3 tire guards. 

The force is emploj'ed from 8.30 a. m., in some cases from 7 or 8, 
until 5 p. m. or till 5.30 p. m. in June, July, and August, with an 
hour for luncheon. The hours of labor in American museums are 
usually longer than in those of Europe.

In 1899-1900 the total receipts were $125,052, of which $85,000 was 
obtained from the sale of securities. The interest on investments had 
dropped from $21,589 in the previous year to $8,034. 

The rich merchants of Chicago would do well to so endow the Field 
Colum])ian Museum that it would not be necessary to encroach upon 
its capital for its ordinary running expenses, but if not the cit}^ fathers 
will certainly undertake this duty. I do not in any case doubt, how- 
ever, but that the finances of the museum will be put on a sound basis 
through the generosity of Chicago millionaires. 

The museum is open to the public from 9 a. m. to 4, or until 6 p. m. in 
June, July, and August. On Saturdaj^s and Sundays admission is

Natural History in New^ York, with a population of 2,200,000, has 752 members 
paying $10 each.

250,000. In 1898-99 the number of visitors was 223,801; in 1899-1900, 
266,899;'^ 21,117 and 28,110 of whom paid admission fees, and on the 
pa}^ days there were also admitted free 9,711 and 15,210 during those 
years. On Saturdays there came 51,190 and 50,717, and on Sundays 
137,053 and 166,856. The highest numbers on any single day were 
6,709 and 6,839; and the minimum, in 1898-99, was 5. I am convinced 
that the number of visitors would be much greater if the museum were 
more accessible. From. the central portion of the city, it takes an hour 
and a half by carriage, or half an hour by the electric or elevated roads, 
to reach the vicinity; or by rapid-transit road, running along the lake 
shore, ten minutes. For most visitors, however, it means a da\"\s trip, 
foi' the cit}' of Chicago covers 187 square miles.'' Surely the number 
of museum visitors would also be increased if the entrance fee was 
abandoned. In 1898-99 the fees amounted to not more than one- 
twentieth of the entire budget, the average attendance on the 260 pay 
days being only 82 persons, while in 1899 and 1900 this average was 
1 OS visitors for whom the entire apparatus of surveillance must be 
put in operation and the entire collection be submitted to the injurious 
influence of light. Thus it happens that a greater number of persons 
annually visit the incomparably smaller museum of the Academy of 
Sciences in Lincoln Park (see below), which allows free admission and 
is centrally located. In 1897 a patron of the nuiseum endeavored to 
make it useful also for public instruction, and to excite the interest of 
youth, b}' offering forty prizes of from $5 to $5(», amounting in all to 
about $300, to the pupils in the public schools of Illinois, for the best 
essay of 2,000 to 3,000 words, made without assistance, describing the 
museum or single portions of it. The result was " very satisfactorv" 
and the attendance to the nmseum naturall}' increased.'' 



" The American jMuBeum of Natural History in New York was visited in 1899 by 
4oS,451 person?; in 1900 by 528,522 persons. (See also p. 330.) 

''It has three streets tliat are each 25 miles lonjr, or as far as from Dresden to

mately equal population— 1,700,000— an idea can be obtained of the scattered arran<re- 
ment of the greater part of Chicago. Dresden covers 18 square miles for a popula-

418 REPORT OF NATIONAL. MUSEUM, 1903. 

In March, April, October, and Novenil)er, lectures are jriven on 
Saturdays, usually by foreign men of science, but also by the nuis(Mun 
employees, for the most part illustrated by projections, for which pur- 
pose, in 18!>!»-L900, 2,022 lantern slides wimv provided in the nuiseum 
collections. Some of the emplo3'ees of the museum, as the curators 
for botaii}", geology, and zoology, are at the same time teachers in the 
L'^ni versify of Chicago. 

The publications, undertaken on a large scale, were begun in 189-4. 
There are six series, the volumes being issued in parts or pamphlets: 
The annual reports, and series on anthropology, botany, geology, 
zoology, and ornithology. Up to the end of September, 1900, 8 vol- 
umes, comprising 50 single treatises, were almost completed, the 
greater part being zoological material. The museum also published 
in 1899 a quarto work of about 400 pages on the birds of eastern North 
America, by Charles B. Cory, with man}' hundreds of illustrations, 

plates." It was open only to pupils of the secondary schools and the two sections 
(fourteenth and thirteenth grades) of the uppermost class of the Pittsburg grammar 
schools. The prizes were especially assigned for each class; 1 each for the fourth, 
third, second, and first year of the secondary schools and 1 each for the fourteenth 
and thirteenth grades of the grammar schools. (I refer to my remarks upon the 
American schools in the chapter on The University of Chicago. ) There were awarded 
in 1899 thirty-eight prizes, ranging in value from $^ to |25, having a total value of 
about $250. The subject was "What I learned from five objects in the Carnegie 
Museum." The essay nmst not exceed 1,200 words, and Sj weeks' tune was allowed 
for writing it. The pupils were advised to obtain information about the museum from 
their parents and friends; they could also use books, and the teachers were specially 
directed to further the matter, but it was a point of honcjr that in the composition of 
the essay itself no help should be received. There were 401 essays handed in, of which 
245 were by girls, who also, with but one exception, won the first prizes. The prize 
winners were from 12 to 21 years of age. The Indian groups were selected 173 times; 
the flamingos 120 times, the mummies 121 times, the camel group 86 times, the 
mastodon 64 times, etc. In all 220 different objects or groups of objects were treated. 
The boys inclined to choose themes which treated of war, sport, or business activity; 
the girls, those having historical signiticance and birds. In the above-cited publi- 
cation the names of the competitors were pu1)lished as well as the essay which won 
the first prize. This was by a young girl 18 years old, and was entitled "Fragments of 
Creation." 8he had treated of the following five subjects: The human skull, arm, 
and hand in the animal series, the gar pike, the Rosetta stone, and the meteorites. 
The introduction and conclusion as well as the transitions between the different parts 
were conceived in a religious spirit. In 1900 there were obtained for a similar prize 
competition 843 essays. (See W. J. Holland, The Carnegie Museum, in the Popu- 
lar Science Moufhh/, LIX, 1901, p. 19.) Pittsburg had, in 1899, among 321,616 
inhabitants, 46,2()6 school children, of which 1,823 were in the three secondary 
schools. As these essays came chiefly from the secondary schools their proportion 
to the 1,823 pupils was something enormous. In the three secondary schools tliere 
were 23 male teachers and 41 female teachers. In the 79 elementary schools there 
were 27 male teachers and 878 female teachers. The schools cost the city in 1899 
$875,000. ( Report concerning the public schools for 1897 to 1 900, Pittsl)urg, 1900^ 123 
pages, with tables. ) [These prize-essay contests were also continued in 1901 and 1902 
with great success. ] 



STUDIES ON MUSKUMS AND KINDRKU INSTITUTIONS. 419 

A Guide appeared in lt»0(i, in its sixth edition. ITt) pa«^es, with many 
plans; it could be made more useful to the visitor by indexes. From 
the sixth annual report, forming a volume of 512 pages, with 51 plates, 
together with the Guide and a little pamphlet entitled An Historical 
and Descriptive Account of the Field Columbian Museum. 90 pages, 
with illustrations and plans, a good idea can be obtained of the origin 
and condition of this great museum. 

The library contains 24,000 volumes, and is excellently catalogued 
upon cards alphabetically and systematically arranged according to 
Dewey's system somewhat modified (see p. 399 of this paper). 
There is even a topical catalogue of the most important papers in 
scientific journals and in the publications of scientific societies — an 
unusual but very useful thing. The library also has a duplicate card 
catalogue of the John Crerar Library (see p. I'ol), with 23,000 titles, 
arranged alphabetically with its own cards — an excellent plan for the 
scientific worker in Chicago. 

The catalogues of the collection are kept in the most scrupulous, 
careful, and exemplary order, for which purpose extra clerks are re- 
quired. In the archives are preserved all the original documents of 
the collections, which are each provided with a permanent number, 
and receipts are alwa^'s taken when these documents are delivered to 
one of the department employees. Besides, the registers are kept in 
books and on cards. Up to October, 1900, there were 94 volumes 
of the catalogue, with 215,000 entries, as well as 75,000 cards." 

The method of cataloguing, to which I paid especial attention in the 
anthropological dei)artment, is as follows:* Every newly acquired col- 
lection, immediately upon its arrival, is assigned a number and given 
an accession card. This card bears, in addition to a serial number, the 
name of the collector, the manner of acquisition of the collection bv 
the museum, the place and date of the collection, the numbers assigned 
to the specimens, and a general statement of the nature of the collec- 
tion. This card, together with any lists or correspondence that relate 
to the collection, is deposited in a stout envelope made for the pur- 
pose, which also bears the name of the accession. This envelope forms 
part of the historical Hie of the department. Both accession card and 
envelope, together with all correspondence, are made out in duplicate, 
one set being retained in the ofiice of the curator, the other being sent 
to the recorder's ofiice. Fach object in the collection is then num- 
bered to correspond with the number on a card which bears the name 
of the ol)ject, with a drawing of the same if deemed necessary, the 
tribe or locality whence the specimen came, the name of the collector, 

"Seethe American A)ilJn-oi)ologi.'<t, n. s, I, 1899, p. 47.S.

and. Hiially, tlic location of the specinicii in th<> nmscuni — wh(^tluM' it be 
on exhibition, and, if so, where, or whether it has be(>n phu'cnl in the 
temporary or exchange storage room. The information contained on 
the (^ai-ds is next transferred to the department i inventory books under 
the appropriate numbers. P^ach card, as well as each entry in the 
inventory, also bears the accession number. The cards are then col- 
lectively tiled in a card cabinet under the accession number, each group 
of cards being provided with an index card. The collection is finally 
indexed in a single large volume und(M- the name of the collector, the 
locality, and the tribe. The advantages of this system are many and 
obvious. It can be determined at a glance what collections are in pos- 
session of the department from any locality or tribe in the world, as 
well as ascertained what collections the department may possess from 
any individual, as collector or donor or througli purchase. From the 
accession number under any of these entries one can refer to the his- 
torical file for the lists or for the correspondence; or with the same 
accession number he may turn to the inventory book oi* to the card 
catalogue for a description or for the exact location of the specimens 
themselves. On the other hand, from the number of any given speci- 
men, reference may be made at once to the inventory book foi^ its 
locality or tril)e; or, from the accession numhei- there giv(Mi, the cor- 
I'espondence in the historical file I'elating to the collection as a whole 
may })e consulted. The method of cataloguing used in the botanical 
department is also very complete in its way; it is described in the 
Annual Keport for 18{>9-19(»0, pages 440— 142. 

In such a complicated system there is naturally much clerical work 
necessary, but the expense of this is more than repaid by the saving 
of time which the excellent arrangement occasions. One can with the 
greatest ease obtain information concerning anything, and on the basis 
of its documents prepare exchange catalogues, of which already several 
extensive ones have appeared. In 1899-1900 the increase was ()4.921 
numbers in 286 entries; in 1898-99, 17,348 in 305; in 1897-98, 74.200 
in 362. 

The officials undertake many extensive collecting tours, the expenses 
of which are usually defrayed l)y ])atrons of the museum. When I 
was there in September, 1899, I met only a few of the museum staff'. 
The curatoi" of the zoological department was on the Pacific Ocean; 
that of the ornithological department, with his assistants and a prepar- 
ator, were in Honolulu: the curator of the botanical department had 
that year made a voyag-e to the West Indies; the assistant curator of 
the zoological department had, among other collecting tours, made 
one to the Pacific coast; the curator of the anthropological department 
had made a tour to northwest America and other regions; and the 
assistant curator of paleontology had made explorations in Wyoming. 
In the 3'ear 1896 the, curator of the zoological department had under-

taken a journey to Africa for the purpose of collecting specimens for 
the museum. 

The labeling- of the collection is carried on with the greatest energ}-, 
and everywhere one gets the impression of a museum well provided 
with descriptive and instructive labels, particularly well printed. 
The tendenc}^ to instruct the public in this respect is, in America 
generally, more marked than with us. The printing establishment of 
the museum prepared in 1898-09 over 7,000 labels, some very large, 
3,500 of them for the anthropological department, and furnished also 
95.000 other pieces of printed matter. In 1899-1900 nearly 8,000 
labels were printed in the museum, 2,700 of which were for the 
zoological department, and there were also furnished 100,000 copies 
of other printed matter. 




Fig. 34.— Field Columbian Museum. Case with movable partition. 

The photogi-apliic establishment of the museum in 1S98-99 prepared 
548 negatives, 2.S0 prints, 253 lantern slides, and other material: in 
1899-1900 the corresponding figures were 1,148, 1,075, and 343. 

The arrangement and installation of the entire nuiseum gives, in 
general, a pleasing impression, especially in the geological and botan- 
ical , departments, which offer many* models, notwithstanding that in 
particular cases the methods and kinds of installation do not always 
come up to strict requirements. It should be remembered, however, 
that the whole work has been accomplished within a few years, and 
that some appliances already existing had to be accepted. There are, 
for instance, remaining from the exposition of 1893 many cases and 
desks with clums}' wooden frames and sides; but neither does the

recently })rocured furniture meet the rigorous reijuircMnents of to-day. 
notwithstanding- pains have been taken to invent some new types of 
cases. In the ethnological section, for example, are seen large glass 
cases with wooden frames and clumsy supports, entirely destitute of 
doors, the sides being made of plate and the top of ground glass. 
One of the narrow sides of the frame can be unscrewed. The objects 
are now hung either directly or by supports on >)oth sides of a mov- 
able partition provided with a foot piece, which is then shoved into the 
case. As these partitions are frequently not as high as the case itself, 
they do not look well. They can also be used as backs bv shoving 

them in along the side (tig. 3-i). 
If an object must be changed, or 
is recpiired for study, the great 
frame nuist be unscrewed with 
the aid of several persons. As a 
similar but much more elegant 
and entirely dust-proof case with 
iron framework and doors can 
now l)e furnished, the principle 
of the screwed frame that pre- 
vailed fifty or one hundred years 
ago can not b(^ reconmiended.^ I 
also give an illustration of the con- 
struction of the case top, with its 
disproportionately heavy wood- 
work in which, for stiti'ening, 
there is riveted an inset of 
wrought iron, half an inch thick 
and -i inches wide, together with 
an illustration of the wooden par- 
tition (fig. 35). This partition is 
11 feet long, 1^ inches thick, 5 feet 
high ; its foot piece isl'-2 feet long, 
1 foot 6 inches wide, 1 foot high. 
The glass cases for the many large and often very remarkable and 
beautifully displayed zoological and ethnographical groups also have 
no doors, but nevertheless they have similar clumsy framework and 
bases. In the horizontal show cases the ))ase has, indeed, the appear- 
ance of a closet, but the space is hollow and unused. Other types of 
glass cases in use in this museum are shown in figs. 86-37; fig. 30 is a 
neat stjde; the supports are of gas pipe of from three-eighths to a half 
inch in diameter, ))ut the small panels of the top injure it; fig. 37 shows 
hanging shelves. Style fig. 38 is the hollow base and the inner 

" If this is compared with what the curator of this department says concerning 
tiie cases in Euro])ean nniseums (G. A. Dorsey, Atnerican Anllirojiologid, n. s., I, 
1899, p. 471), one can only exclaim: De (jiistihits mm cxt dii^jrHtandnin!

ari'iiiij^vinent of a case or stand inclosed l)y glass doors and especially 
constructed for lightino- f i-oin at)ove; it is about t> feet long, 1 foot broad, 
and T feet high, its base being '2 feet high; the woodwork is clumsy 
and the arrangement of the shelf supports, with four standards, is 
obstructive. Similar stands are used throughout the museum and do 
not generally add to its beauty; when, however, the exhi})its do not 
need to be inspected on all sides, these stands are arranged as a four- 
sided well-lighted pyramid that excellently answers the purpose for 
which it is constructed. The new cases are of mahogan}' or of other 
wood polished black. In showing the collection of skeletons, black 
backgrounds are often employed, as in several P^uropean museums, 
but the setting of the skele- 
tons contrasts disagreeably 
with this black background 
and their mounting is some- 
times rude. 

While some of the great 
mammal and bird groups 
are displayed in a strikingly 
beautiful manner, there were 
many of inferior character, 
for example, in the ornitho- 
logical department, although 
the museum is developing 
so rapidly that perhaps even 
these may now have given 
place to better ones. 

In the botanical department 
there were found very prac- 
tical herbarium cases which 
showed a good utilization of 
space (fig. 39). They are 
nearly 7 feet high, 3 feet 4 
inches wide, and have each 

45 compartments, 5 inches high, and 3 sliding shelves. They stand in 
pairs, back to back, with sufficient intervening space for the doors to be 
pushed l)ack out of the way. The doors slide on tracks, which also hold 
each pair of cases rigidly together. The door is hinged at </</, hung to 
the wing piece {EE)^ which slides to and fro with it on the track, and 
during this movement the door is always supported bj' a noiseless 
castor which is screwed into a block of hard wood, //, that serves as a 
check to the door when pushed back and as a foot press when locking it 
after closing. The door is opened as widely as the wing piece will 
allow and then shoved back. In closing, one pulls the kev of the lock, 
the door is run along the track us far as the rolling pins </</ permit,

and then swiino- slmt. These cases offer many advantajjfes and are 
inoeniously designed, hut the}- should he made of iron instead of wood, 
for they would then he more secure against dust and tire. (See also 
Keport for 181)9 and 1900, p. 450, Plate XLVl.) This remark will 
apply likewise to the wooden cases of the entire museum. In this con- 
nection maj^ be mentioned the pasteboard boxes still used, instead of 
tin, for the display of minerals and the like. I do not doul)t but that 
the Field Ck)lund)ian Museum will in time haye recourse to iron cases, 
be it onl}^ as a security from fire, and that then excellent desig-ns will 
be brought forth by the adyanced technical skill of America." Better 
cases are also to be desired on account of security against dust, for in 
the great halls of this palace, designed for a former exposition and 

all communicating with each 
other, the dust spreads un- 
impeded oyer eyerything and 
is yery troublesome. 

A collection of coins is sus- 
pended between glass plates — 
a yery pretty method, but 
somewhat clumsily executed 
here. 

The oyercrowding of the 
exhil^ition space already men- 
tioned is occasioned partly by 
the fact that far too nuuh 
is exhibited. Objects nuist 
often be displayed because 
the donors demand it, and the 
result is that there are fre- 
quently hundreds of almost identical specimens, as in the ethno- 
graphic diyision, which are yaluable for study but quite superfluous 
in a puldic collection, the more so as light fades them. Besides, by 
reducing the number of exhil)its space could be found for work- 
roojus, now quite insufficient throughout. There haye been proyided, 
as in the American Museum of Natural History in New York (see page 
388 of the earlier portion of this paper), yery practical, tight-closing 
tin boxes, wdth easily sliding compartments, for the preseryation ol

«From the criticipm made l)y L. P. (iratacap in his article, The Makiiit^; of a 
IMnseuin, in the Architectural Record, IX, li)00, p. 398, on iron cases, both ujni^ht 
and horizontal, as "clunisy and ngly forms" (ti<f. 17), which are the only ones witli 
which he is acqnainted, one would not tlunk the prospect of such a reform in America 
was very favorable. The lionored curator of the mineralojiical section of the Ameri- 
can Museum of Natural History in New York, who luis an interest in and knowl- 
ed>,'e of the technical side of museum aihiiinistration possessed by few experts, 
would certainly chani^e his view if he became aware of tlie better results in this line 
in Europe.

skins, plants, etc., 80 inches long, 20 inches high, and IS inches deep, 
nia(h^ by the American Can Company, Bowlino- (ireen Building, New 
York and C'hicago, and costing $10. These are also made in various 
other dimensions. They often stand piled in the workrooms to the 
ver}' ceiling. 

In conclusion I will hastily sketch the museum collection, though 
from its great profusion I can give the reader ])ut a feeble idea of its 
exhibits. I must limit myself to enumerating a few principal objects. 

Antliropnhxi'ival depart t a ent.^'^\\K\ archeology and ethnology of 
North America stand in the foreground. Among the most interesting, 
archeologically, is the collection of the Hopewell Mound group in 
Ohio, with a large series 
of copper, stone, and bone 
ornaments and imple- 
ments, among which is a 
deposit of 8,000 stone 
implements. Well repre- 
sented in a prehistoric 
wa}^ are Illinois, Arkan- 
sas, Wisconsin, Michigan, 
New Jersey, Tennessee, 
California, New Mexico, 
and Arizona. There is 
also a large collection of 
casts from the sculptures 
of Yucatan. 

In the ethnological field 
there are very complete 
representations of the 
Kwakiutl and Bellacoola 
of the northwest coast, 
the Kulanapan of California, the Hopi of the Southwest, the Sioux and 
Algonkins of the Plains. 1 further mention houses, totem poles, and 
the other ethnographical eiiuipment of the Haidas of Alaska, Eskimo 
materials from North Greenland, Alaska, and Eastern Sil)eria, group 
exhibits of the villages, houses, and industrial occupations of the Zuni, 
Hopi," etc., with life-size figures. One of the seven Hopi villages, 
Oraibi, in Arizona, is— so to speak — here reproduced complete, so as 
fully to show the interior and household life of the Indian of to-day. 
To this is added a collection of over 4,000 pieces of prehistoric pot- 
tery from the ncar-))y Hopi ruins. Further, there are exact imita- 
tions of nine altars and sand mosaics as they are used in ceremonials 
of the Hopi, whose religious life is especially well represented.

The ethnology of South America is iliustnited l)v extensive collec- 
tions from Colombia, Venezuela, British Guiana, and the region of 
the Gran Chaco; the prehistoric, by similar ones from Colombia, 
Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. Melanesia is the best represented in the 
South Sea division. Asia is at present represented from its eastern 
coast alone; the Korea collection is especially t^ood; Java and Ceylon 
also offer some very notable objects used for theatrical and dramatic 
performances. Africa is I'epresented ouly by special regions, such as 
the Congo basin and Portuguese Southwest Africa." In European 
archeology there are shown many reproductions of the bronzes in the 

Naples Museum, as well as 
bronzes and wall decora- 
tions from Boscoreale and 
(irecian, Roman, Etruscan, 
and Ph(i?nician originals. 
Al)out a thousand objects 
from the Swiss lake dwell- 
ings are shown, and some 
also from prehistoric Eng- 
liind. I can not, however, 
begin to enumerate all. 

The section of transpor- 
tation is given a prominent 
place, and one may sav that 
no age and no land has been 
disregarded. It l)egins by 
showing how prin:'itive 
peoples carry their chil- 
dren and their goods, shows 
all sorts of litters, pack ani- 
mals, and other beasts of 
burden, carriages with 
solid and spoke wheels, and 
at last illustrates the entire 
development of the locomotive. It is impossible to touch upon every 
thing in a linuted space. The peoples of America from Alaska to 
Brazil are especially well represented. So, also, the development of 
railway travel, shown with great completeness, is of historic interest. 
Serial cards indicate how the railways of America have increased 
every ten years. The water and wagon transportation is also shown 
in just as complete a manner. One may see a "Scythian"' cart

The physico-anthropolooical collection is very notable, and is among 
the best in the world. It must >)e the richest in human skeletons, 
although only in American ones. I did not get the exact number of 
skulls and skeletons, l)ut there must be several thousand. Many hun- 
dreds of skulls and skeletons are from the tribes of the northwest 
coast, the Blackfoot, Algonkin, and allied Indians, from the mounds 
in Ohio and the prehistoric graves in New Jersey. The Flatheads of 
the Columl)ia River arc represented b}" a series of complete skeletons, 
with 100 artificiallj'^ deformed skulls; Peru with over 150 complete 
skeletons and many skulls. There are also 90 skulls from New Guinea, 
some Maoris, and a small series from many regions of the earth. An 
instructive exhibition is made in 33 cases of selected pieces from 
the large collection. There is one case devoted to each of the follow- 
ing: Craniometric nomenclature, sexual variation in the skeleton, 
variation in the cranial sutures; varieties at the glabella, pterion, and in 
the orbits; variation in the nasal region and degrees of prognathism; 
variations in the intermaxillary suture, mastoid process, shape of 
palate, and direction of palatine sutures; variations in the lower jaw, 
lachrymal bones, and occipital condyles, the clavicle and scapula, 
the dentition, the sternum and bones of the pelvis, the humerus and 
the tibia, the femur; skulls of difl'erent capacity and various cephalic 
indices; skulls showing variations in the orbital, nasal, and dental 
indices; in the facial, palatal, and bizvgo-stephanic indices; variations 
in the scapula, lumbar, sacral, and pelvic indices; pathological skulls, 
artificially deformed skulls, trephined skulls from Peru. Six cases are 
devoted to disarticulated skeletons showing pathological or anomalous 
characters; one to models of the brain; one to casts of cranial cavities, 
including those of animals; two to skeletons of gorillas and men of vari- 
ous races; two to the chemical constituents of the human bod}-; one to 
life masks of the races of eastern Asia and of Oceania. There is added 
to this an anthropometric laboratory, with the needful instruments. 
This department was specially organized by Dr. Franz Boas, a Ger- 
man, now at the American Museum, in New York, and professor in 
Columbia rniversity. I have described the physico-anthropological 
collection with more relative fullness because a similar one can hardly 
be found elsewhere, and it ma}' perhaps lead to imitations. The pres- 
ent competent curator of this department, after a visit to European 
museums, expressed the opinion that as to the exhibit of physical 
anthropology none of them could compare with the Field Columbian 
Museum in Chicago," wherein I agree with him.

Botaiitaii depariiiit'ut. There wa.s obtainetl from the \\'()rlcr,s Fair, 
l)oautifully installed both in g-eographic sequence and in a nionogi'aphic 
manner, an unusually extensive collection of woods, t'oi'est prod- 
ucts, such as fruits, resins and the like, tibers, and other economical 
plant Droducts, in a profusion that is, perhaps, without a parallel. 
Especial attention is given to products having a domestic and practical 
value, such as cotton, tobacco, hemp, grains, tea, coffee, spices, dye- 
stuffs, etc. Forestry is illustrated by monographic exhibits. From 
one and the same tree there are shown blocks, leaf-bearing branches, 
and flowers; photographs of the species at various ages; pieces of its 
bark, cross sections of the stem, planks in various stages of working up 
to a polished condition; besides a colored chart of the geographic distri- 
l)ution of the species, statistical data concerning its weight, hardness, 
density, and heating value, so that any one, from his own standpoint, 
may ol)tain information and instruction. In this way "" Latin "" Amer- 
ica is especially well represented, and there are economical botanical 
products from Russia, Japan, Korea, Ceylon, British India, Johore, 
North America, Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica, British Guiana, Venezuela, 
Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, Paraguay, and the Argentine Republic. 
Recently there has been installed a complete collection of the timber 
trees of North America. The herbarium contained, in October, liHK), 
about 80,000 plants, and is, like the whole vast department, especially 
well organized. Particular attention is paid to American plants, and 
the collection is rich in North American and West Indian species. 

Geological department. — The collections are arranged in two series — 
one systematic, the other economic. The systematic is divided, as is 
usual, into paleontological, mineralogical, lithological, structural and 
dynamical sections. The paleontological section is chronologically, and 
within each period zoologically arranged. Much attention is given to the 
collecting of fossil vertebrates of the w^estern United States, a region 
specially rich in this regard. I will name, as an example, the material 
obtained in South Dakota in 1898 relating to Titanotlierlum ingenx 
Marsh, a mammal resembling a rhinoceros and nearly 1(5 feet long, and 
the extensive material collected in 1899 in Wyoming relating to land 
reptiles (dinosaurs) known ^'& Brontosaurns, Oreosaiirus., Oampto,s-a>/n(s\ 
Morosaiiru.s., etc. , the last named having a fenmr over 5 feet long.^' The 
mineralogical section is arranged according to Dana. In the section 
of structural and dynamical geology there are shown, among other 
things, cave products (stalactites, stalagmites, and the like), in a 
great cave naturall}' arranged. The economic series illustrates the 
occurrence of minerals and ores which have economic importance, 
the processes by which they are extracted, and their application in the 

" Recently there have come to the Cohinibian IMusenin dinosaur remains of yet 
lartfer animals, among which is a femur over 6 feet 6 inches in length. (See E. S. 
Riggs, in Science, Ajjril 5, 1901, p. 549.)

arts and industries. These economic collections are arrant^ed in sys- 
tematic series with geographic subdivisions. Because of the profusion 
of this material I can only mention a small part: Comprehensive 
exhibits of combustible minerals of the I'^nitc^d States according to 
their occurrence, their composition, their economic value, etc.; the 
building and ornamental stones of the United States; the kinds of mar- 
ble and such like, also those of many European countries (in cases like 
fig. 38); the metallurgy of the precious and base metals, the metal- 
lurgical process being represented Iw groups, in which pieces of the 
ore, the smelted product, and the combustible materials used are dis- 
played with the help of labels and converging and diverging lines 
showing what materials go into the furnace and the resulting products, 
"with all the intermediate stages; their composition, peculiarities, uses, 
etc., are given in printed descriptions, so that anyone seeking infor- 
mation can get all the necessary data at once. A striking collection 
of precious and decorative stones, and a collection of meteorites which 
fills an entire room, are conspicuous. 

The vast and copious collection of this department is remarkable 
for its instructive and often elegant installation. I would have been 
glad to include illustrations of entire rooms like those shown in the 
annual reports of the museum. I should certainly not neglect to 
mention the model of the moon, 18 feet in diameter. 

Zoohxj'ieal iind ornithologhal department . — The most striking feature 
of this department is, first of all, the excellent representation in large 
glass cases of groups of animals, such as orang-outangs, chimpanzees, 
nose apes, musk oxen, black sheep from Alaska, gazelles, antelopes, 
leopards, hyenas, herons, etc. Sometimes the secondary work of 
artificial foliage and the like is somewhat obtrusive, but these groups 
excellently fulfill their object of attracting the general public, though 
they also require much space. The systematic collection has not yet 
received the same consideration, for the proper preparation and instal- 
lation of a large series of animals can not be accomplished in a short 
time. The skeletons stand in a room adjacent to the systematic collec- 
tion. About 10,000 species of shells are shown in horizontal cases of 
not especially pleasing construction. 

The Field Columbian ^Museum would do well to somewhat contract 
its programme and lop ofi' several brandies which have led it too far in 
its attempt to embrace all possible lines of human interest, so that it 
may devote itself in a scientific wa}^ to the natural sciences and to 
ethnography still more than it does now. There is still clinging to it 
too nuich unimportant material from the World's Fair, but one can 
only look with real admiration at this museum, w^hich has sprung out 
of the earth in so short a time. If it secures, as is expected, a new 
building. I do not doubt but that it will, astonish the world by its 
ability anfl compete with the first nuiseums for precedence. 



430 KKPOKT OF NATIONAL MI'SKUM, 1903. 

10. CHICAGO ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. 

In the year 1857 an association "'to promote science" was organized 
under the name of "'The Chicago Academy of Natural Sciences." It 
began at once to make collections, but the conmiercial crisis of that 
year was unfavorable to the development of the enterprise. 

In 1859 and 1865 the association was incorporated under the name 
"The Chicago Academy of Sciences." Encouraged personally l)y L. 
Agassiz, they laid in 1863 the foundation of a scientific museum, which 
was deposited in a house near the present city hall. The collections 
were enlarged with the help of expeditions, but in 1866 some of them 
were destroyed by fire, after which accident the academ}^ began the 
construction of a fireproof building 50 feet long 55 feet wide, and 50 
feet high, not far from the present Auditorium. 

In 1868 the first meeting was held in the new building, which was 
of brick, the floors of iron and tiles, the .stairs and main doors of iron, 
and the windows with iron shutters. The museum was in the upper 
story, 28 feet high, a large space with broad galleries, and was soon 
filled with precious collections, including 10,000 glasses with crustaceans 
and 8,000 species of marine shells, and the library was also largely 
increased. 

In 1871, at the great conflagration, howev^er, everything was 
destroyed, although at the beginning of the fire they had trusted in the 
supposed security of the building, but not the least thing was left of 
the collections. Not more than twelve days after this disaster it was 
decided to erect a new building on the same spot. In that building 
the first meeting was held in 1873. but in consequence of pecuniar}' 
difficulties the academy w^as obliged to leave these quarters in 1886 and 
store its collections. 

In 1891 a plan was considered of associating with the new Univer- 
sity of Chicago, but the members preferred not to sacrifice their inde- 
pendence, and when a rich citizen, M. Laflin, ofl'ered to spend ^75,000, 
and the Lincoln Park board ofl'ered a space and $25,000 for a new 
building, the architects, Normand S. Patton and Reynolds Fisher, of 
Chicago (now the firm Patton. Fisher & Miller), were charged with 
making the plans. They designed a building of 750 feet frontage and 
a dome 130 feet high, of which plan, however, only the northern- 
side building could be executed (Plate 16). It lies isolated in Lincoln 
Park, in the northern part of the city, at the lake near the zoological 
garden and the hothouses of the park, and called after its patron, who 
died in 1897, the '-Matthew Laflin Memorial Building." The nuiseum 
was opened to the public in 1894. This wing (part) is 133 feet long, 
61 feet wide, and 70 feet high, and is fireproof. The wooden floors 
are laid on cement; the, cases, desks, and other furniture, the doors 
and sash are of wood, AVith respect to the tireproof construction I

TO<'('i\o(l th'^ folloAvino- infornuition from Mr. Patton, whoso acqilaint- 
aiu'o 1 liad ma(l(> at the Fnion Loa^-ue CM) of Chicago: 

\s to the materials of coiistniction, the iri)ii i-oluinns are covered with porouw 
a cotta and finished \)y i)lasteriny witli Keene's cement upon the terra cotta. 
Tiie fireprooting of the imildiiig in general is effected by application of hollow tile 
known nmler the name of "soft tile," or "porons terra cotta." They are prepared 
()i ;■ Hiixtnre of clay with sawdust in the kiln. The sawdust is destroyed and the 
clay becomes porous or spongy by this process. 

The floor arches are of 6 by 6 inch tile, segmental in form, and of about 11 feet 
span, an<l resting upon iron beams which run from the outside piers to the corre- 
sponding columns of the interior. 

The plaster is laid directly upon the under side of the tile arches, so that the 
ceilings consist of a row of arches. 

The roof is constructed of iron supports which, like rafters, run up and down the 

;'e at intervals of about 5 feet. On the upper side of these rafters T supports, 2^ 
ini > broad and of the same height, are laid horizontally at intervals of 2 feet, upon 
V rest hollow tiles that have the form of books and therefore are called book tile. 

•ook tile form a continuous surface upon which the roof tiles are laid. First 
i..e book tile are covered with a waterproof mass and then the so-called "Si)anish 
style" of roofing is applied, where the roof tiles are nailed directly down upon the 
book tile that let the nails enter easily and also hold them firmly, as they are of 
pv s clay. All parts of the iron frame of the roof are made fireproof by a cover of 
plastered hollow tile; there is no uncovered metal in the whole building. The 
security against fire of the vaulted ceiling over the central hall of the museum is 
effected in the following way: This ceiling is made of a steel frame covered by 
expan<U'd metal lath, and plastered from l)elow with hard cement mortar. After 
this plaster has become hard, the exterior (upper) side was plastered the same way, 
so that the ceiling consisted of a solid mass of plaster about 2 inches thick, in the 
midst of which the expanded metal is embedded. Thereby it was made so solid 
t' I person could walk on it. 

ine interior walls of the building are covered with vertical wooden furring 18 
inches apart; this is covered with expanded metal lath that is plastered. Here the 
wooden furring would not allow a fire to spread, because it is inclosed in front by 
the plaster, on the back by the brick wall, and above and below by the fireproof 
ceiling. 

The staircases are of iron. 

In many buildings colunms are treated as disagreeable necessities, which are spaced 
as far apart as possible with little regard to anything except to make them incon- 

' nous. In this building the columns are treated as the most important feature in 
ii-.- interior architecture. The design of the building proceeded from the interior 
outward. In the first place, it was determined what should be the proper dimen- 
sions of the cases in which exhibits are to be placed. It was found that 8i feet was 
the most economical and effective width for the double cases, and that 60 feet 
between the cases gives an ami)le width of alcove; therefore it was arranged so that 
there should be a case against each pier, and the piers are to be placed 10 feet on 
centers, and the columns are to be exactly opposite the piers. To this arrangement 
the exhibition cases fitting in between the columns and the piers on the outside 
walls, form a part of the architecture of the building; and the windows coming, in 
every case, in the alcoves l)etween the cases give a most perfect lighting to the speci- 
mens. This arrangement of columns will give to the interior an effect of size much 
greater than reality, and will iirovent tliat appearance of emptiness which mustMun 
buildings are apt to have. 

.\s we predict that the exterior of the building will be a prominent landmark in 
Chicago's architectm-e, we venture the assertion that the interior, small though it be.

RKPORT OF NATIONAL MTTSEUM, litO.'J. 



\\\\\ irttract much attention from tliose interested in museums. Tlieri' are many 
museums wliicli ajjpear to have been erected on the theory that they were simply 
storage wareliouses for the safe-keeping of specdmens. This Iniilding is designed on 
the theory that a museum is a plaee for the effective display of specimens; in which 
case it is important to bear in mind that bare white walls and mean architectural 
surroundings will belittle the value of whatever is contained therein; while a rich 
architei'tural setting w'ill give to the public a true impression of the value of the col- 
lections displayed for their benefit. " 

The plan of this tinishod wini( is one of the best that I ever liave 
seen in a museum, and it is to be regretted that only such a small part 
of the whole could be executed. The construction was developed from 
within, since the most perfect use of space was based upon those 
dimensions of the cases and the space between them that are con- 
sidered the very best, and not until then were the interior and exterior 
architecture fitted to these demands. Therefore, as can be seen in 

the plans of the first floor 
and part of the second or 
gallery floor, figs. 40,41 , the 
cases all around stand ex- 
actly between the columns 
and th(^ piers between the 
window^s, and they all re- 
ceive their light from the 
side except two of them, 
that could just as well have 
l)een placed in some other 
position. This is, 1 l)elieve, 
the most correct principle, but the dimensions, without exception, 
have all been made too small; from this fact, besides some others, the 
people crowd too nuich in the spaces between the cases. But this only 
happened because the means were so limited that the architects were 
compelled to use minimum measures. Otherwise they would have 
l)uilt on })roader ])lans. 
The building has the following horizontal divisions (fig. 42): 
1. A high basement for la})oratory work, packing, heating, store- 
rooms, etc.. and a dark chamber, partly cemented and furnished most 
practically. 

«Mr. Patton (juite recently, 1903, wrote me in respei't to these remarks: 
It is a matter of no small satisfaction that my prophecy should come true only 
ten years later, and that your description would recognize the scientific method 
which had been applied to the planning of this building. I realize that the dimen- 
sions are all minimum, and should be increased, if possible, for any i)uilding likely 
to have such large crowds as visit this building, but when visiting New York City I 
was struck with the enormous waste of floor area from the lack of attention given to 
the spacing of the windows, so that comparatively few exhibits could be i)laced in a 
given space, and my object was to give the maximum capacity consistent with proper 
lighting and access.

3. Second or main floor which, to^vther with the third floor, forms 
a large hall with light from above (Phite 17). This hall has in its cen- 
ter a room for largo animals (mammoth, glyptodon, gorilla, ])ison, 
nmskox, American elk, groups of lions, etc.); in the cases all around, 
the verte))rates; also some ethnographical specimens. 

■i. Third floor or galler}'^: All around the railings of the gallery are 
horizontal cases for insects (in the illustration, Plate IT. are seen some 
other objects in these cases, 
the pictures having been 
taken some years ago); in 
the cases at the window sides 
ai'C mollusks and lower ani- 
mals, paleontology, geology, 
and mineralogy. 

5. The attic, which runs 
all around the vaulted ceil- 
ing with skylight, perfectly 
illuminated, and at the out- 
side w^alls of which stand 
storage cases with l)irds, 
shells, lower animals, fos- 
sils, and minerals; this attic 
is perfectly fireproof, Avhich 
fact I especially emphasize, as this is rarely the case in Germany. 

It would be difficult to devise a better and more practical use of 
space. Beside the stairs an elevator runs from the })asement to the 
gallery. 

Adopting a combination of ceiling and side light (if for any reasons 
the first one had to ])e employed too), the main advantage of the ])uild- 
ing lies in its being exceedingly well lighted. 

The height and width of the windows and the walls between are so 
excellently arranged that the light flows thi-ough all the rooms, and the 
effect of the ceiling light, which is relatively small, could almost l)e 
spared. Besides the reflection of the horizontal cases at the gallery 
railing, which as everywhere with ceiling lights is very annoying, is 
diminished by the light flowing al)undantly in from all sides. I know 
a number of similarly built museums, but they either use only or 
almost entirely the ceiling lights, which arrangement has many dis- 
advantages, or the side light is not made use of either so profitably or 
so completely. 

The wooden cases and desks witli their sharp yellow wood color are

not up to very strict reciuirciiionts, ])ut everything was done to make 
them dust tight, as far as wood will allow it. Some of the larger cases 
have no doors on hinges, hut the frames ai'e tightly screwed on, which

respects is totally fireproof, ;ind after th(>, stid cx])ei'ience of the two 
conHagrations, it would ((M-taiidy have been more advisable to use 
iron furniture instead of wooden. 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDKKD INSTITUTIONS. 4'^^) 

Since, as \vc said al)()VO, tho diineMsioiis of the cases iiave without 
exception ])een proportioned to the dimensions of the entire l)uilding-. 
and as I believe this to he the only correct view in buildings of this 
kind, I shall dw(dl upon this point a little more explicitly. Generally 
the architect plans a museum without considering,'' the consequences 
that are connected with the breadth of the windows and the spaces 
between, nor does he reo-ard the proper length iind depth of the 
cas(>s. Very often the officers of the nuiseum do not suppoi-t him suf- 
iiciently, since most of them do not care for these specialties; besides, 
the architect o-enerally does not ask their advice at all. In this way 
most museum structures are erected schematically, and then the dimen- 
sions of the cases must be arranged according to the dimensions of 
the building, instead of vice versa. In such cases it very often hap- 
pens that the show cases are set up without consideration of the 
existing distril)ution of light. Examples are odious, but it would 
really be hard to mention a nuiseum at the erection of which the pro- 
ceedings were as judicious as at the erection of the Academy of Sci- 
ences in Chicago, although the dimensions were necessarily too small 
on account of insufficient funds. 

After n)ature deliberation, the architect had decided for cases of 8^ 
feet depth, and a mininuun free space between them of 6i feet. This 
gave a result of 1() feet mininuun as the distance between the centers 
of the piers, and a breadth of 5 feet for the windows. The free spaces 
in the central portion and at the corners are more lilx^-al in size. In the 
gallery the depth of the somewhat low cases is almost exactly equal to 
the })readth of the walls betw^een the windows, as seen from tig. 41, 
and, according to ui}" opinion, is the most suita})le proportion. 
Although in this instance the intervals are very narrow, the typical 
4ength of the cases, which was varied only now and then, w^as deter- 
mined at 10 feet lO inches, with a breadth of ?> feet 6 inches, and a 
height of 7 feet T inches, with one door 3 feet 2 inches in breadth and 
6 feet in height, having one plate of glass for each of the three divi- 
sions of the length. I do not want to criticise these dimensions, but 
mention them only to . show how considerately the architects ])ro- 
ceeded, and how much one dimension depends upon the other, if once 
established. 

According to need, a partition and shelves are put into the cases, 
and 1 only have to say that the shelf brackets are adjustable, so that 
horizontal or slanting shelves may be used; there are also arrange- 
ments mad(> to separate the case divisions from each other by parti- 
tions, according to the doors. Therefore, all the cases, as well as 
their interior ai langements, can easily be inttM-changed. All these 
things seem N'cry simple and self evident, l)ut such a care foi- details 
we find but randy, if ever, among our museum of architcu-ts. 

The length of the cases determined exactly the position of the iron

coluimis thiit nm tlirouoh from the ])as(Mnent to the top and are, as we 
have said, Hi'eproof covered. They all .stand (see tig. 40) at the 
interior side of the cases. This also seems to be simple, natural and 
evident, but oidy look at the museums in regard to this point! At the 
American Museum of Natural History in New York City, that mod- 
ern, magnificent edifice, the front was constructed without taking into 
consideration the dimensions of the cases — a mistake that, as stated 
above, is made almost everywhere — and the columns inside in the halls 
do not correspond with the piers between the windows, so that the 
columns and the show cases come into conflict with each other. With 
how many museiuns is this the case! In the Academy of Science of 
Chicago the cases determine the interior architectual divisions, and 
this is the only correct principle. In the same way, the gallery rail- 
ing, with its desk cases, is organically connected with the architecture, 
not attached externall}^ as we so often find. 

I again emphasize my opinion that 1 do not consider the chosen 
dimensions to be the most happy ones, although they were directed 
by the narrow space available. I only tried to show the rational 
principle that was hereby followed and was worthy of imitation. 
The ])uilding, situated in a v^ery much frequented public park at one 
of the greater tratiic streets, must be ])uilt to oft'ei' a pleasant view 
externally, and therein the architects were very successful with a 
modern Frencii RtMuiissance style. For the same reason the front 
nuist be made of a good material (limestone), and as the means were 
not sufficient to make it longer, the height was necessarily proportioned 
to the dimensions of the available ground, and conse({uently the height 
of the single stories had to be reduced to a mininunn measure, or else 
it would have iK'en too uniformly square. If the architects had not 
thus been hindered their intellectual planning would have produced 
still better results. 

Since the distribution of light is so very excellent in the building, 
1 think it to be an advantage to mention the height of the single 
stories and the situation and size of the windows.

The .spiU'c under the liori/oiittil eases is provided with cases with 
drawers for seientitie eoUections; it is not hollow and covered in, as 
at the Field Columbian Museum. The arrangemnt with interchancre- 
able drawers is o-ood. Excellent order exists everywdiere. 

Great care is applied to the art of taxidermy, but some of the older 
specimens are not ornamental to the museum. 

The labeling- is with instructive d(vscriptions printed at the museum, 
and the work is executed in general with the greatest care and a great 
deal of pains, as shown in fig, 43, the interior of the case of fossils. 
In the drawers the objects lie loose in cardboard boxes, and in the 
exhibit collections they rest upon labels of cardboard with paper 
pasted on, therefore there is no permanent arrangement such as could 
be attained with thin metal plate; but the streng-th of the cardboard 
and the color of the paper are selected after nuich experimenting, and 
the appearance of the tablets is excellent, at least for the present.

museum is open to the public daih' from i> a. m. to .5 p. m. (on Sunday

that they must become injured sooner than ncces.-^ary. The labels are 
3, (), and 8i- inches long, and 2, 4, 6, and 85^ inches wide, not to mention 
extra sizes. They are either printed directly on the cardl)()aid or on 
paper of the same color, and pasted on the board. The printing types 
are especially attractive. The paper used is called ''star manila;" the 
cardboard is a seventh of an inch thick, with a border of black gummed 
paper, and covered with the man i la paper so that a black rim remains. 
If a black background is required for the objects, the 3'ellowish ])ap(M- 
is again covered with ])lack paper, as on paper boxes. The whole 
arrangement is neat, ancl aou rarely find so nuich care taken in other

institution roinpri.sini,^ :ili l)ian(lu\s of lettei'8 and science, while the 
Chicag-o institute is an association that has for its object "'"to improve 
and propatfate scientific knowled<^e b}'^ lectures and publication of 
original essays, by a library and museum, as well as by such measures 
as are adapted to awaken interest and promote scientitic research," In 
this(|uotati()ii the words "scientific" and "science" mean almost exclu- 
sively natural science. In former times Americans used high-.-sounding 
titles eveiywhere, as in hundreds of lower-grade schools that called 
themselves "universities," and the '"Academy of Science in Chicago" 
thus bears an improper title that was accepted in 1H57. I think the 
correct name would Ik> "Natural Histor}^ Society of Chicago," and 
so it should be changed. The academy is divided in six divisions: 
Astronomy and mathematics, photograph}, chemistry, g-eology, ento- 
mology, and biology. The association has ordinary and extraordinaiy 
mem])ers, who pay a fee of $5 a year (the ordinary also pay an entrance 
fee of $10); life members, who pay a single fee of $500, and ])atrons, 
who pay $2,500 at one time. It also has honorary and corresponding- 
members. The board consists of a president, a vice-president, a sec- 
retary, and a treasurer, with ten trustees, among them the president 
of the Lincoln Park board. Only eight persons receive salaries — a 
curator, the secretary, a preparator, a clerk, a supervisor, three jani- 
tors, which, even for this small museum, is an unsatisfactory number 
of officers. With the supervision of the building during the time 
visitors aiv admitted, only two persons are charg"ed; the public, in 
general, controls itself. The curator of the museum, a professional 
man, is in all his plans dependent upon the decisions of the trus- 
tees, who are nonprofessionals; a fact that is not very fayorabl(> to 
the progress of the museum. This kind of obstacle does not exist to 
such a degree in (Termany, unh'ss it l>e in certain "purchase commis- 
sions." The impairing influences, however, are even here not want- 
ing, but lie more in those who have to do with assigning the moneys, 
and who ar(^ less appreciative of the educational value of the museum, 
and thus, as is the case in America, they economize at the wrong- end. 

The annual revenues of the academy are $5,000 from the Lincoln 
Park administration, spent for salai'ies, and the fees of the nuMubers, 
amounting to $1,500, spent for administrative expenses. The park 
boai-d also pays for heating, illumination, cleaning, and repairs of the 
building, and pays the three janitors. If more mone}" is needed for 
administi'ative or for purchasing purposes, or for expeditions, etc., 
appeal is made to the liberality of the members or the public, and 
always successfully, though until now in very modest limits compared 
with other similar institutions in Ani(>rica. In VMH). $S.(»(>0 was 
expended. 

A special division with its own |)ublications, the Natural History 
Sur\ev of CM)icago and environs or \icinit\', was established in 1892.

Fho iiojicUMiiy issues Transactions (two vols, in (juarto, with 85 plates, 
1867-1870), Bulletins (two octa\<) volumes since iss:!), Aiuuial Reports 
(1895-1897), Catalouues for exeluiiioe, and Bulletins of the Natural 
History Survey (formerly (leolotiical and Natural History Survey), 
four of which were issued and sevei'al others are in preparation. 
'I'hese ])i'blicatious are treatises especially on the bmnches of paleon- 
tology, zoology, iind botany of the country. The library is almost 
exclusively augmented by exchanging the al)o\'e })ublications, the pub- 
lications of more than i*<)0 other institutions, aiui contains 10,000 vol- 
umes and several thousand pampldets. 

The meetings of the academy in which scientific lectures are given 
take place monthly, and besides these, weekly popular scientitic lectures 
ar«» given during the winter season. In liMM) twenty-five such lectures 
took place and were patronized by 7,000 persons. The lecture hall 
holds about 800 persons. 

The nuiseum had 300,000 visitors in 1900, from 25 to 6,000 daily. 

The increase in the collections amounted to 7,600 specimens in 1900, 
1,000 of which were by exchange. The entire number of specimens 
w^as 150,000, among- them 75,000 mollusks, HO.OOO arthropodes, paleon- 
tolog'ical and botanical objects, 15,000 each, 5,000 mineralogical objects, 
and -1,000 birds. 

The museum of the Chicago Academy of Science will certainly develop 
itself from these existing lieginnings, for it contains even now many 
original and suital)le features, and tln^ building itself nuist be consid- 
ered as a model of a smaller nmseum building. On account of the 
careful planning of the wliole, and (^specially on account of the practical 
views the architects so preeminently followed, it would be greeted with 
the greatest satisfaction if the I'ich citizens of Chicago who patronize 
nuiseum interests would at this time not oidy favor the Field Colum- 
bian Museum and the Art Institute, but also help the academy to such 
a success as it deserxcs by I'eason of its modest yet praiseworthy accom- 
plishments, compared with other great American institutes. A city 
like Chii-ago. with its extensive area, should not oidy have two great 
museums for natural science, but they are really a necessity. There- 
fore a "'crescat, Horeat'' is certainly in its place,

The Chicago Historical Society was founded in 1856, and in 1857 
incorporated by the State of Illinois. Its object is to institute and 
encourage historical in(|uiry, to collect and preserve the materials of 
liistory, and to spi-ead historical information, especially with regai'd 
to the Northwestern States, In 1868 it occupied its own building, 
whose construction had cost $()0,00(>, l)ut the great Chicago fire in 1871

objects, books, etc., haviiig a total value of $1<H),()()(). In 1872 the 
societ}" was reorganized, but in 1874 a second time lost its collections 
1)V fir(>. In 1877 it was oro-anized anew and soon installed in a tempo- 
I'ar}' building. Its present structure at 142 Dearborn avenue, not very 
far from the Academy of Sciences (see p. 430) and the Newberry Library 
(see p. 459), was begun in 1892 atid the society moved into it in 1896. 
It was designed by Heniy Ives CobI), architect of the Newberry Library 
and of the Universit}" of Chicago, in a Romanesque st3de, and cost 
$190,000, whicli was contri))uted ])y tlie mem))ers. Unfortunately a 
ground plan of it could not be obtained. The collection contains pic- 
tures, including 75 portraits in oil, manuscripts, historical reminiscences 
of Chicago and the Northwest, prehistoric o])jects, together with a 
library of 26,000 volumes and 60,000 pamphlets, relating chiefly to 
historical matters. This library is placed in the back part of the second 
story, where the high windows are seen in Plate 18. ' The nuiseum is in 
rooms on the ground floor and on the second floor. In the right wing 
in the illustration is a large and lofty lecture hall. All of the rooms 
are particularly well lighted. 

What makes this structure uncommonly interesting and wherein it 
is unique, as far as I am aware, is the fact that, made wise by two 
grievous disasters, an absolutelv fireproof building has been produced, 
in which the use of wood has been entirel}^ avoided. All is of stone, 
brick, cement, and the like — iron and glass. The only combustible 
things that I saw there, besides the books, papers, and collections, 
were the curtains and carpets in the auditorium. The entire structure 
consists almost wholly of large intercommunicating rooms, each of 
which can be closed ofl' l)y iron doors, so that it forms a "safe" by 
itself. The city furnishes the electric light. It is heated by natural 
gas brought from a distance of over 150 miles. The large, open, 
heating rooms in the basement, besides, are entirely isolated. Window 
frames, doors, stairways, book stacks, show desks, and similai" stru(v 
tures are made of iron and stone, as are also all utensils and furniture, 
such as writing desks, tabh^s, chairs, and the like. The shelves to the 
ii'on book stacks are stone slabs. Th(» neighboring houses, some of 
which are very high, as will be seen from l*late 18, can, on this account, 
hardly be considered as a danger, although one would be glad to see 
them farther a\\ay. 

The right conception here shown of a secure building seems to me 
well wortliy ol" imitation. For 1 am of the opinion tliat in this way, and 
no other, should umseums and libraries be l)uiltand furnished. What, 
indeed, hinders this, except the prejudice which exists in man}- quar- 
ters (even in (yhicago, as we shall see in the New))errv Lil)rary) against 
iron, except the designs of those architects who continually build from 
the same "ready-made" plans, formal and without originality, and 
except the lack of proper qualifications in those to whom nmseuni

interests jiiv intrusted!! Ever since the 3ear 187S, when I became 
ac(iuainted witli tlie Royal Library in Stockhohn, which stands isolated 
upon a spacious plaza and is a fireproof buildino- of stone and iron, I 
have advocated this principle for museum ])uildin«;s. but for the first 
time in the })uilding of the Chicago Historical Society 1 found my 
idea absolutely carried out, for even in Stockholm the}' have not 
l)r<)ceed(Hl with such thorouohness. 

In the ironwork itself the historical museum does not excel. The 
iron is not adequately treated, it rusts at the window frames, under 
the tal)les, etc., because the proper materials were not used m paititing 
and varnishing." Resides, the iron furniture is clumsy and often over 
oiiiamented, although now, at least in America, iron furniture is pro- 
duced of ornamental and tasteful design (as already mentioned, p. 
'^)S()), whose extiM'nal appearance exacth' simulates wood, flust as 
clumsy are the iron show desks, provided as they are with a primitive 
arrangement for raising the lid that allows the dust to sift in. 
Upright cases are not used. The iron book stacks, too, do not show 
the neatness usually seen in such work in America (see pp. 871, 882, 
899 of this paper), and as 1 shall describe hereafter, in the Pu))Iic 
Library of Chicago. Hook shelves of sheet iron would be preferable 
to those of heavy stone, whicli look clumsy. 

In spite of these criticisms 1 can ord}' again urge that the general 
arrangement is in principle entirely correct, in execution excellent, 
failing only in a slight degree to meet rigorous requirements, so that as 
a whole it is to be most earnestly recommended to all museums for imi- 
tation. In mj^ eyes, at least, the Historical Society of Chicago has per- 
formed a great service in that it has carried out the idea and especialh^ 
that it has created a model. There is at present no published descrip- 
tion of the structure, but one is contemplated. 

Since 1S82 there ha\'e appeared four octavo volumes of Collections 
besides Proceedings and Amuial Reports.'' There ai'c four regular sit- 
tings during th(^ year.

\-J. ART INSTITUTK OF ClIICAdO. 

Fi-oiii !ui iirt school founded in iStJO ro.se The Chicago Academy of 
l)c>sion, wliich until 1SS2 was the only nota))le art center of the city. 
Ill 1S79 it was organized anew as the Chicago Academy of Fin(> 
Arts, and incorporated l)y the State "for the founding and mainte- 
nance of schools of art and design, the formation and exhibition of 
collections of objects of art, and the cultivation and extension of the 
arts of d(^sign, by a])propriate means." In 18S3 it was giA'(Mi its pres- 
ent name. 

Fii'st i.istalled in rented rooms the society obtained in 1882 and 1885 
(obliquel}' across from its present home) a large piece of ground, upon 
a part of which it built, but in 188() it erected there a tine museum, 
100 feet long and 87 feet wide, of a Romanesque style, after i)lans of 
,1, W. Root (Plate 21). As this soon became too small it was in 1892 
sold for $400,000 to the Chicago Club" in order that there might be 
erected in 18U3 the present si)acious ])uilding, near the edge of the lake, 
in the extensive Lake Front Park. 

The origin and history of the present building is not without interest. 
It shows what advantage a great exposition may be to the development 
of a city. We have seen this already in the Field Columbian Museum. 
Butialo, also, in this year (1901), doubtless will obtain important ])ene- 
tits thi'ough the Pan-American Exi)osition (see p. 40;")). The Chicago 
Fx ;)<)sition in 1893 needed a building for holding congresses, and by 
nuitual Mgreement with the art institute this one was built upon a site 
b(4()nging to the city, on the lake front, near the busiest section. The 
exposition paid $200,000, the art institute $500,000, and the city gave 
the site, 425 feet long, on the broad Michigan avenue under the con- 
dition that the proi)erty rigiits in the building should belong to it, bid 
that the art institute should occupy it rent free, so long as they use 
it for its present purposes. The art institute therefore presented it to 
tile city. The plans wer(> made by the arcidtects, Shepley, Rutan c*c 
Coolidge, in Italian renaissance style, the details "classic and of Ionic 
and Corinthian orders." The magnificent bronze lions of E. Kemeys 
tlaiik the broad stairway of approach. The building is 850 feet long, 
1S5 to 225 feet wide (the Dresden gallery of paintings occupies only 
about half the space), and 75 to 85 feet high from basement up. It is 
lir(>proof, being built of liedford limestone and brick, but the floors 
and window frames, doors, skylights,* and furniture are of wood, and 
in s()me cases the partitions are wainscoated with it. The steam-heating

whieh is rather unsig-htly. 

The tii"e service is especially well oro'anized. Tlie huiidino- and the 
eolleetions are insured hy a company whi(di maintains a watch sei'vice 
for all its laro(> customers. In every room tiiere is an alarm. The 
watclnnan. who carries a lantern and does not use the electricity which 
is installed throughout the huilding-, strikes this alarm hourly throuiih- 
out the niuht, and thus a direct telegrajjhic conmmnication is esta]>lished 
with the watch room of the insurance company, and the otticial tliere 
knows whether each room has heen inspected every hour. If the sig-- 
nal is ojiiitted at any time some one immediately appears at the Ijuild- 
iiig- from the fire-insurance company. Each morning" a card showing 
the night report is sent to the director of the art institute. Through 
these precautions, in the special interest of the insurance company, 
^reat security is obtained, an arrangement certainly worthy of imita- 
tion. It is intended, however, to stop the insurance, which is practi- 
cable liecause of the isolation of the fireproof building — on the one side 
facing the lake, on two sides entirely free, and on the side toward the 
city 175 feet from the nearest building's, which are also fireproof. 
Behind the nniseum, however, the railroad runs along the lake front, 
which, with its vast commerce, may well occasion some troul)l(\ 

For economical reasons ventilating apparatus was not provided. In 
the second story, however, panes of the lower skylight can l)e opened 
and fresh air admitted through wintlows below the roof (see tig. 44, 
arrow) into the empty space between these skylights and the fixed 
glass roof. On the ground floor air may be admitted by opening the 
large plate-glass windows, without crossbars, which (urn xtTticailv 
iiround an axis, a practical arrangement worthy of imitation, by means 
of w hich ciossbars sind their injurious eti'ects are sivoided." It can be 
easily understood that this kind of ventilation is insutticient when th<> 
Imilding is crowdetl with visitors. In the smoky atmosphere of Chi- 
cago, where soft coal is l)urned, the exterior of the beautiful museum 
is defaced in an ugly manner (as are the buildings in Dresden), and 
this also occurs in the interior, especially on the plaster casts. This 
last drawback could at least be avoided by \ entilating with purified 
air and closed windows, as I have found done in \ arious buildings in 
America (see for example the remarks ludow on the Cliicago Public 
Librar}'), an arrangement with which we are unacquainted intiermany. 

" The panes are 10 feet higli and 7 feet wide. Only every fsecond window can be 
opened. To fit tightly i^onie material is attached. Double windows are not consid- 
ered necessary. Neither frost nor condensed vapor have any bad effects in winter, 
owing to tiie effective heating. During my visit one of these great window panes 
was shattered ))y a football hurled against it during a game in the adjoining park 
meadow.

At the head of the institute is a board of trustees of 23 persons, who 
from their muul)er select a president and a vice-president, as well as an 
executive conuuittee of seven and an art conniiittee of live members. 
The society had, in June, 1900, 245 "governing members,"^ who are 
elected and who pay an entrance fee of $100, and $25 annually; 2,140 
annual members who pay a yearly fee of $10; 84 life members who pay a 
fee of $100 at one time, which must be inrested; and 8 honorary members. 
The museum is controlled by a director, with a secretary, a treasurer, 
a librarian, and some assistants. There are ))esides 4 clerks, 1 engi- 
neer with assistants, 1 attendant with assistants, 1 janitor. 1 house 
servant Avitli assistants, 1) watchmen for da\' and night service — alto- 
gether 30 salaried employees, exclusive of the teachers at the art school. 
But as the director has also to conduct the art school and lecture there 
(he is besides a teacher in the University of Chicago), there is placed 
upon him an enormous burden of work. The necessary subordinate 
heads of divisions are wanting, and thereby the scientific use of the 
material of the museum is not assured, a state of things which can not 
last. A museum that does not publish lives onlj' for the narrow circle 
of its visitors and not for the rest of the world, but since it is wholly 
dependent upon and receiving from this outer world, it is morally 
bound to give an adequate equivalent. In America, as I have already 
several times said, there is generally too groat parsimon}- in museum 
service, and the employees are thereby o\erworked. It is also worthA' 
of remark that an eniplo3^ee in America can not, as in European insti- 
tutions, withdraw and intrench himself behind "'official l)iisiness," but 
he nuist always be ready to talk to anyone and be at anyone's service. 

The collection is open week days from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m., and Sun- 
days from 1 to 5 p. m. Admission is free on Wednesdaj-s, Saturdaj's. 

(' Such a deficit is always quickly made up. For instance, there was in the pre- 
vious year !?4,000 due for interest on borrowed capital, but upon appeal there was, 
within ten days, $110,000 raised from HO persons, in sums from $500 to $1,000. Since 
the organization of the society, $500,000 in cash has been given. Various legacies, 
amounting to from $200,000 to $225,000, are not yet available, but are to be kept as 
capital. Up to the present time $100,000 is capitalized, for the gn-ater part for 
sjiecial purposes, such as the i>urchase of pictures, scliolarships, etc.

tion which drew a oood many.) The g-reatest number on any one day 
(Sunday) was 10,759; the smallest, 54, on a pay day. Tliis large nund)er 
of visitors is very remarkable, for the great Field C'olumbian Museum 
in the same city had in 1899-1900 only 2<)6,899(in 1898-9!> even less, 
223,304), chiefly, indeed, because of its distant location. In New York, 
with double the population, the Metropolitan Museum in 1899 had 
540,000 visitors, and the American Museum of Natural History had, in 
1900, 523,522.'' The reasons for this lie, first, in the favorable location 
of the art institute, near the heart of the city, and then in the excellent 
and instructive installation and labeling of the entire collection (([uite 
a contrast to the New York Art Museum), and perhaps, also, in the 
active and aspiring spirit of the inhabitants of Chicago. Besides, the 
frequent temporary exhibitions attract a considerable attendance, an 
arrangement adopted either not at all or only to a limited extent b}^ 
the museums which I have compared a])()ve. There are also com- 
prised in the total number 20,000 persons who attended the lectures, 
and 80,000 represent art school students who are counted each day; 
V)ut in any case this comparatively lively interest which the people 
take nuist atl'ord just satisfaction to the men who have devoted their 
time and thcMr means to advance the interests of the art institute. 

The collection of sculpture appears, from the catalogue of "sculp- 
ture and painting,'" of September, 189S, to consist of (532 nund^ei's, 
almost all of which are casts. Modern sculptors are also represented — 
for instance, Barrias, Bartlett, Barye, Cain, Chapu, Daillion, Dela- 
planche, Donoghue, Dubois, Elwell, Ericksson, Falgujere, Fremiet, 
French, Gelert, Gerome, Hasselberg, Houdon, Idrac, Joy, Mass^oulle, 
Mercie, Molin, Peterson, Potter, Rodin, St. Gaudens, St. Marceaux, 
Thornycroft, Tilden, Wuertz, and others,'' three of these with orig- 
inals. In 1893 the French Government sent to the Chicago Exposition 
an extensive historical collection of architectural casts, unique of its 
kind, which was assigned to the art institute. It will ])e exhibited in 
its entirety in hall No. 20 when that is completed. I will also mention 
109 facsimiles in bronze, after originals in the Naples Museum, from 
Pomjjeii and Herculaneum, which were also sent to the exposition; 
Grecian, Roman, and Egyptian antiques, among the last a most rich 

«"lt is the earnest wish of the trustees that every man, woman, and cY Id in Chi- 
cago should enjoy the educational advantages afforded by the institute, juid for this 
object the galleries are open free on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday." The insti- 
tute has the declared purpose of serving the people. 

ftThe British Museum had in 1900 only 689,249 visitors (4;^,S92 on Sundays), with 
a population in Tjondon of about 5,000,000; the Museum of Natural History had only 
485,2S8; and the South Kensington Museum 846,489 (87,854 on Sundays).

and extensive collection of .scariiban, also a large collection of nephrites," 
117 in number (Plate 23), which is, perhaps, only excelled by the col- 
lection of Mr. Bishop in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New 
York City. Industrial arts are also notabh' represented. 

The principal attraction of the museum, however, is the gallery of 
paintings, with some 500 pictures l\y over 300 artists, part of which, 
indeed, are only lent, but most of them will later become the property 
of the institute. Among them are several pictures for which the for- 
mer owners paid $30,000 to $40,000, and many for which $10,000 to 
$20,000 were paid, almost all being large gifts or legacies. While 
with us most collectors sell their i)ictures already during their life- 
time, or their heirs do it after their death, the rich Americans take 
pride in bequeathing theirs to a public institution. 

The modern portion of the collection, especially pictures of the 
School of Fountainebleau, has hardly its equal in P^urope, only the New 
York collections (see pp. 345, 350) being compara))le with it. Of French 
artists there are exhibited Benjamin-Constant, Besnard, Rosa Bonheur 
(3), Bonnat, Bouguereau (3), Jules Breton (6), Cabanel, Cazin (6), 
Corot (S), Courbet, Couture, Daubigny (7), Decamps (3), Degas, Dela- 
croix (4), Detaille, Diaz (8), Jules Dupre (9), Fragonard, Fromentin 
(3), Gerome (2), Greuze, Gudin, Hebert, Henner (2), Isabey (2), Jacques 
(4), Lhermitte (3), van Marcke, Meissonier (2), Michel, Millet (3), 
Monet, de Neuville (3), Puvis de Chavannes, Robert, Rousseau (5), 
Roybet, Troj^on (9), Ziem, and 31 other masters. 

Of American artists I will name (partly represented by free-hand 
drawings, etchings, etc.,) Abbey (2), Bierstadt, Blum (3), Bridgman (2), 
Bristol, Bursh (2), H. and W. Chase (3), Church (5), Thomas Cole, 
Cox, Dannat, Charles Davis, Durand, P^lliott, Fuller, Gibson, Gifl'ord, 
de Haas, Thomas A. and B. Harrison, Hart, Hitchcock, G. Inness (8), 
G. Inness, jr.; Kappes (2), Leutze, Lungren, Martin, Murphy, Neal, 
Parsons (4), Pearce, Pennell (4), Reinhart (3), Richards, Sargent, Shir- 
law (5), Stuart, Thayer, Vedder, Weeks, and J. A. M. Whistler.* 

Among the recent painters of other nations tliata^-e exhibited (partly 
in free-hand drawings) are the following: A. andO. Achenbach, Brozik, 
Chierici, Constable (2), Fortuny y Carbo, Gainsborough, Griitzner 
(2), Israels (2), Jettel (3), Knaus, Koekkoek (4), Lawrence, Lenbach 

«This collection was presented in 1900, together with oil paintings, water colors, 
porcelains, crystals, etc., 1,300 objects in all, vaUied at $800,000. See the catalogue 
of The Nickerson (Collection, 147 pages, with over 1,000 numbers. 

&The American artists are treated by R. Muther in his Geschichte der Malerei ini 
XTX .Tahrhundert, ITT, 1894, pp. 866-405. He makes much use therein of K. Koeh-

der Sch()nen Kiinste in den Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerika, and closes with 
the words, "America, therefore, has an art. * * * The American, artists are the

The collection of old masters is certainly not large, as indeed lies in 
the very nature of things, but it is worthy of attention. From the 
Demidotf auction in 1880 13 selected pieces, mostl}'^ of the Dutch 
school, were withdrawn, which in 1890 the art institute was able to 
buy; these were portraits of Rembrandt, Rubens, van Dyck, Franz 
Hals the elder, and Holbein, the Guitar Lesson of Ter Borch, a Family 
Concert of Jan Steen, an excellent landscape of Hobbema, the Jubilee 
of Ostade, as well as pictures of Teniers the younger, Ruisdael and 
A. and W. van de Velde. There are also examples of L. and H. Back- 
huysen, Berchem, Brueghel the elder, van Croos, Aelbert Cuyp, 
Fouquieres, Frans Francken the younger, Ghirlandajo, van Goyen, 
Guardi, de Keyser, W. van Mieris, Mor, Murillo (2), A. van der Neer, 
Perugino (4), Rembrandt, H. 8aft-Leven, Sorgh (2), Teniers the 
younger (2), Ter Borch, Titian, P. Veronese (2), Wouverman. 

I have given this enumeration somevvhait at length for the reason 
that in Europe, even in art circles, we are hardly at all aware that 
Chicago can show so much in this held. 

Besides this permanent collection the art institute holds yearly, in 
addition to exhibits of single fine pictures from private collections and 
school exhibits, a considerable number of temporary exhibitions (23 
in 1900) for which catalogues are issued, distinguished by their taste- 
ful appearance, the following, among the more recent, for example: 
Catalogue of the Thirteenth Annual Exhibition of Oil Paintings and 
Sculpture by American Artists, October 30 to December 9, 1900 (281 
numbers, 48 pages); Catalogue of a Loan Exhibition of Selected Works 
of Modern Masters, Januar}^ 8 to 27, 1901 (63 numbers, 24 pages, 
among them a series of eminent masterpieces such as it would hardly 
1)0 possible to get together in Dresden); Catalogue of an Exhibition 
of Works by Chicago Artists, January 31 to February 24, 1901 (198 
numbers, 40 pages); Catalogue of Works of Dagnan-Bouveret, March 
1-24, 1901 (29 numbers, 16 pages); Exhibition of Works of Elihu 
Vedder, March 28 to April 15, 1901 (49 numbers, 24 pages); Catalogue 
of the Thirteenth Annual Exhibition of Water Colors, Pastels, and 
Miniatures by American Artists, April 25 to June 9, 1901 (376 num- 
bers, 51 pages), and others. 

The librar}^ contains only 2,263 volumes, but including, however, 
many expensive works, besides over 16,000 of the large Braun auto- 
types. It is open daily, except on Sundays and holidays, from 9 a. m. 
to 5 p. m.; on three days also until 7 p. m. for the accommodation of 
the pupils of the art school. 

In 1900 there were given in the lecture hall for members and their

friends 90 lectures on art, also on music with musical performances; 
besides -11 lectures for the art students and 24 for other art associations. 
I will brietly mention the art school. It is one of the most fre- 
quented in the United States. In 1900 it had over 1,900 students, 
740 regular day students, 500 evening students, 794 Saturday students. 
In the day classes in 1899 there were 25 teachers, including prominent 
persons from without, whose services were temporarily secured, 10 in 
the evening classes and 85 students, who received a total compensation 
of $29,000. The models cost $3,000, heating and lighting $1,750 (see 
also Circular of Instruction of the School of Drawing, Painting, Mod- 
eling, Decorative, Designing, and Architecture, 1900-1901, 191 pages, 
with many illustrations, 1900). 

It is estimated that the collections of paintings, sculptures, antiquities, and other 
objects ■>( art belonging to the art institute are of the value of al)out ?.S50,000. The 
cost of the building has been $708,000. The land, 400 feet, estimated on the basis of 
the property opposite, on Michigan avenue, is worth not less than $1,600,000, a total 
of $3,158,000. The loan collections constantly exhibited are probably of the value 
of $300,000. The total amount of cash subscriptions paid into the Art Institute since 
its organization in 1879 is about $500,000. 

It is, in fact, admirable and worthy of respect, that so important a 
work as that achieved and presented by the Chicago Art Institute 
should have been accomplished without great, private benefactions — I 
mean "great" in the American sense, as they are made to other insti- 
tutions in America" — and without aid from the State or city; and it is 
difficult, for us at least, to understand why the city, as such, is not 
sufficiently ambitious to feel it a duty to support an art society that 
has already attained so high a rank, in order that it may compete with 
the first in the world. We can only suppose that the cit}^ fathers do 
not appreciate the educational worth of art. 

In one of the last annual reports it is said, "The Art Institute has 
accomplished something; it aspires to accomplish much more." The 
present beautiful product is regarded only as the beginning of a greater 
one, and the}' are already thinking of either adding lateral wings or of 
bridging over the railroad and erecting a second building in the park 
beyond, nearer the edge of the lake. Who, indeed, who has learned 
on the spot to know and admire the enterprising spirit of Chicago, can 
have the least doubt but that the future development will go far beyond 
such plans? 

13. JOHN CRERAR LIBRARY. 

The history of this library is as simple as it is unusual and brief. In 
1886 John Crerar, a merchant who had lived in Chicago since 1862,'^ 

« For example, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York recently obtained 
a legacy of $8,000,000. 

^Of Scotch extraction, born in New York. See Appleton's Cyclopedia of Ameri- 
can Biography, new edition; also ^I. Kirkland's History of Chicago, 1895, and Will 
of John Crerar, who died in Chicago, October 19, 1889, 23 pages. 



452 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

bcHjucathed the greater part of his propert}^, after deducting- numerous 
private and public legacies/' for founding a "fre'e public library" in 
the southern part of the city, as the northern part was already pro- 
vided with such an one in the Newberry Library (see p. 459). He 
desired the erection of a tasteful, solid, fireproof building. Only such 
books and journals w^ere to be included as might create and sustain a 
health}^ moral and Christian sentiment in the community; all offensive 
and immoral works were to be excluded. Concerning such books, he 
said: 

I do not mean by this that there shall not be anything but hymn books and ser- 
mons, but I mean that dirty French novels and all skeptical trash and works of 
(juestionable moral tone shall never be found in this library. I want its atmosphere 
that of Christian refinement, and its aim and object the building up of character. 

In 1889 the excellent man died. In 1894 the library was incorpo- 
rated by the State, in 1895 organized, and in 1897 opened. I said 
above that its history is short, but it nevertheless contains much that 
is instructive and worth noting. • 

The testator himself had named thirteen of his friends as "direc- 
tors," two of whom were his executors. They cooperated with the 
other principal libraries in Chicago so that the Crerar Librar}' was to 
give special attention to the natural sciences exclusive of medicine, to 
the social sciences, and technology; the Newberry (see p. 459) to medi- 
cine, history, art, and the humanities; the university (see p. 491) to 
philology, and the Public Library (see p. 473) to the whole, more pop- 
ular literature for household reading. The idea that by a cooperative 
division of this sort the institutions above named would attain the 
greatest possible use for the general good is as wise as it is rare, and 
will certainly be productive of the most excellent results. The exact 
programme of the Crerar Library is as follows: 

I. General vxirks. — Bibliography, library economy, cyclopedias, 
general periodicals, general societies, exhibitions and museums, ps}^- 
chology, logic, historj'^ and geography, cartography. 

II. Social sciences. — Ethics, statistics, political science, political 
economy, administration (including public documents), associations and 
institutions, education, commerce and communication, customs, folk- 
lore, etc. 

III. Physical sciences. — Mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemis- 
try, and mineralogy. 

IV. Natural sciences. — Geology, paleontology, biology, botan}^, 
zoology. 

«The last-named legacies amounted to $1,000,000 for ecclesiastical, benevolent, 
and educational purposes, among which were $100,000 for a Lincoln statue, and 
$25,000 for the Chicago Historical Society (see p. 439). The will was contested by 
the relatives, but without result, concerning which a series of papers, some of which 
were quite extensive, were published in 1892.

It was concluded, awaiting the time when sufficient capital should 
he collected to admit of building a house, to rent quarters, and very 
suitable ones were found in one of the many great business houses in 
the heart of the cit}". There was chosen the sixth story of a new 
addition to the wholesale house of Marshall Field & Co. ,*^ near the 
principal business centers, the public library, and the art institute. 

Recently (in 1900) a portion of the tifthstor}- was added. The nine- 
storied building, designed by the architect D. H. Burnham in 1893 (Plate 
24), is a vast rectangle 148 feet long and 100 feet wide, with an inner 
court. The entire floor was specially fitted in an extremely convenient 
manner for the John Crerar Library b}^ the architects Shepley, Rutan 
& Coolidge, who designed the art institute and the public librar3^ The 
reading room (Plate 25), looking toward the east, is 85 feet long b}' 50 
feet wide and has 75 seats; the principal library hall (Plate 26) is 88 
feet long by 42 feet wide and looks toward the south. The inner court 
being- of too small dimensions (72 by 40 feet) for the height of the 

« The complete scheme has under these 5 divisions 77 subdivisions instead of the 
39 here mentioned. It is based on the Dewey decimal system. 

'' The proprietor of this vast business is Mr. Marshall Field, the ]Msecenas of the 
Field Columbian Museum, which bears his name (see p. 410), and one of the 
iM?ecenates of the University of Chicago (see p. 491). The house carries on a retail 
and a wholesale business, the latter in an enormous building in Adams street, made 
after the plans of Richardson with striking architectural features, the former on a 
corner of State and Washington streets, the new building in which the Crerar library 
is installed and which is connected with the old building, being on the corner of 
Washington street and Wabash avenue. In the wholesale department 5,000 persons 
are employed; in the retail bazaar 4,000, which number, after the completion of a 
second new building, is to be increased by 2,000. The fittings and furniture of the 
rooms are prominent, the mahogany cases are of the best make; order and neatness 
prevail. The building is fireproof, with external iron shutters except for the ground 
fioor. One may judge of the refinpment that rules here by the fact that extra articles 
of food for diabetics can be found on the tastefully designed menu card of the lunch 
room which is frequented by hundreds of persons and open daily from 8.30 to 5 
o'clock, and where Ijoth hot and cold articles of food can be obtained (there are more 
than 150 dishes and nonalcoholic beverages, from 5 cents to 40 cents). At the pres- 
ent thne the firm is erecting on the corner of State and Randolph streets, adjoining 
the old building, corner of State and Washington streets, after the design of the 
Architect Graham, a palace of 12 stories out of white granite, so that the State street 
front of the establishment will be 425 long. This front will be ornamented with 
granite Ionic pillars from 30 to 70 feet high, and the vestibule will be lined with 
Carrara marble. The cost will reach $1,500,000. Everything will be fitted up with 
the most recent improvements. [Now completed, 1903.] During my visit in 1899 
tlu' firm had half of the street in front of the house (about 3S feet broad) asphalted 
at its own expense, because the pavement, as is usual in Chicago, was bad antl the 
city would do nothing. ]\Iarshall Field & Co. wished in this way to give an 
example for the emulation of others and also to remind the ofiujals of their duty.

building', which was phmncd for other purposes, the lighting is not 
in all parts sufficient. Including the rooms in the fifth story there 
are accommodations for C^}5,000 books. It w^ould be a mistake to sup- 
pose that the elevated situation of the sixth story makes it difficult of 
access, for there are three elevators in operation^' by which the sixth 
floor can be I'eached sooner than by clim])ing- the stairway even to the sec- 
ond floor. The building is fireproof and, like many American houses, 
has fire-escape ladders on the outside; within only extinguishers are used 
for security. The floors are covered with cork linoleum of the best 
quality, about a third of an inch thick. The house furnishes steam 
heat and electric light. There is no special arrangement for ventila- 
tion,* the high rooms, large windows, and elevator shafts sufficing to 
change the air. In a later building it is proposed to seal the windows 
hermetically and to force in filtered and purified air, a system now 
api)lied in many places, as in the Congressional Library at \\'ashing- 
ton, and of which I shall speak more fully under the Pu])lic Library 
of Chicago. Recently there has been established a small auditorium 
for 30 persons, which can also b^ used by scientific societies, such as 
the Bibliographical Society, the Entomological Society, the Mycological 
Societj^ the Illinois Association of Public Accountants, and the Insti- 
tute of Education. There is a special lunch room for employees. 

The book stacks are of iron, the other furniture of wood. In spite 
of the excellent examples in Boston, New York, and elsewhere, and 
notwithstanding the rigorous application of this principle in the 
Chicago Historical Society (see p. 489), wooden furniture has been 
employed, and this will always offer a point of attack for fire. The 
iron book stacks, as well as most of the wooden library furniture, 
were furnished by the Librar}^ Bureau of Boston, a grand institution 
which I hope to be able to describe in the course of ni}^ reports. 
Their model for book stacks, however, is not as satisfactory as many 
others (see p. 382). It is less stable and the ends are overornamented, 
creating a bad impression when a number are taken together. The 
shelves are of white wood veneered with oak, instead of iron. The 
newer racks in the fifth story are, as I have recently been informed, 
steadier, less ornamented, and smoother, whereb}^ the books are less 
liable to injury. A practical form of book support '^ is used to prevent 

« There is also one for freight. Two of the three passenger elevators go directly to 
the John Crerar Library, without stopping at the intervening floors; they are the 
so-called "express trains." 

^ Except that in the window frames of the reading room there is provided a small 
ventilating apparatus which the American Ventilator Company has patented and called 
the " sash ventilator and lifter combined." It consists essentially of perforating the 
lower window frame with holes through which air may enter if it is desired.

the books falling- down when the shelf is not full. The vertical arm 
has two rounded wings standing out at right angles to it. When 
books are quickly put up these prevent the thin plate from passing 
between the book leaves and injuring them, as often occurs when 
other kinds of supports are used. If an employee of the library takes 
a book from a case for his own temporary use he puts a red card in 
its place; the books that are given out to the public are recorded only 
in the office. 

The li])rary now contains 70,000 volumes. The normal yearly 
increase has hitherto been about 10,000 volumes. In 1900 there were 
of general works, 13, .590; social sciences, 16,106; physical sciences, 
10,380; natural sciences, 9,131, and applied sciences, 16,435. It ma}^ 
be remarked that the 14 per cent devoted to the natural sciences cost 
three times as nuich as did the 24 per cent devoted to the social sciences. 
According to the agreement which was previously mentioned there 
were bought from the Newberr}' Library 8,023 volumes on natural 
science for $16,000, besides 300 special ornithological works for $4,.5O0. 

The library is catalogued according to the rules of Linderfelf* and 
classified according to the system of Dewey,* with independent ampli- 
fications. The lettering and the numbering are printed with gold 
directly upon the backs of the books. The greatest care has been 
given in the selection of bindings, and the edges of many volumes are 
gilded in order that thej^ may be more easily cleaned in the dusty and 
sooty atmosphere of the center of the cit3\ Pamphlets are simph^ 
bound and provisionally kept in cases. In 1900 there were 5,431 vol- 
umes bound at a cost of $5,570, or at an average of about $1.19 a vol- 
ume. The printed card catalogue, directl}^ accessible to the public, 
contained in 1900 over 90,000 cards, 41,000 of them author cards and 
49,000 subject cards, among which were also a small number of those 
published b\^ the American Library Association.'^ There are also 
about 30,000 cards to which are added bibliographical information — 
from the Concilium Bibliographicum in Zurich, from the American 
Library Association, from the Torrey Botanical Club, from the Depart- 
mentof Agriculture in Washington, from the Bibliographic des Sciences 
Mathematiques in Brussels, and some others. This bibliographic 
information, accordingly, relates to zoology, agriculture, American 
botanical literature, names of new botanical genera and species, math-

eniatics, and photoj^raphy. The card cataloo-uo proper of the John 
Crerar Library is distinji^uishe'cl ])y its exact and beautiful execution 
and by the originalit}^ of its arrangement, which is said to be 
unique of its kind. It is arranged in three parts: (1) alphabetically, 
according to authors and titles; (2) according to subjects, numer- 
ically in the decimal classification, and at the same time chronolog- 
ically; (3) an alphabetical subject index to No. 2. « Twent}' copies 
of the cards are printed, for besides their use for the various cata- 
logues, sets are sent gratis to the Armour Institute of Technology, 
the Public Librar}^, the Field Columbian Museum, the New])erry 
Ltibrsiry,'^ and the Universit}^ of Chicago, also to the Northwestern 
Universit}^ in Evanston, Illinois, and the University of Illinois, in 
Champaign, Illinois, under the condition that they shall be arranged 
and made accessible to the public. Each title costs the John Crerar 
Library 50 cents, including^ the electrotype. (See below.) The regular 
issue of special catalogues is planned and has been begun with a list of 
the librar}' placed in the reading room (A List of Books in the Read- 
ing Room, January, 1900, 251 pages, Lex., octavo). In the reading 
room are about 3,000 volumes. The printing of this catalogue was 
made from electrotypes. From the type setting of the card is formed 
a thin cast, which costs 6 cents. These casts, numbering 23,354 in 1900, 
are preserved in regular order, and in their prescribed serial order,^ 
are used for printing. In this wa}^ both manuscript and corrections 
are spared. This catalogue must be the very first book to be pro- 
duced in this manner, a plan which was suggested half a century 
ago b}^ C. C. Jewett, the librarian of the Smithsonian Institution 
in Washington, who proposed that a central catalogue bureau should 
make such casts, from which every library could print their own cata- 

- «See, for more exact information, the Second Annual Report of the John Crerar 
Library, 1896, p. 10 (1897), also the Third Report, 1897, p. 18 (1898). The library 
also has a fourth kind of card catalogue, the so-called "official catalog" for the 
employees, which contains in one alphabet everything that concerns any work that 
is extant or taken into consideration, including notices of it, etc., a complicated, 
ingenious, and very useful device, a more detailed description of which I do not 
give here. A ' ' dictionary catalog, ' ' that is to say, one in which everything is arranged 
alphabetically according to authors and subjects as in a dictionary, is not provided.

''The Newberry Libi-ary has recently declined to receive them, perhaps becaiise 
the arrangement and care of 6,000 cards annually occasioned too great an ex[)ense 
considering the slight use made of them by the public, or ])ecause tlieir size did not 
fit their "indexer," to which I shall recur below. The six other libraries, however, 
upon inquiry, desired to continue to receive them.

logue/' The printino- is finely executed. Electrotyping is cheaper 
than printing-.'' A page co.sts a little over a dollar, or with a large 
edition it is reduced to about 55 cents. The titles are arranged .sys- 
tematically in 9 divisions and 67 subdivisions; within these, however, 
they are also systematically, not alphabetically, arranged. The alpha- 
betical index at the end, with 2,000 entries, contains, beside authors, 
also certain titles. The catalogue is sold in the li))rary for a nomi- 
nal price of 2<) cents; by mail, 30 cents. There are also printed six 
instructive reports, distinguished among similar publications for their 
clearness and completeness; a list of current periodicals, 1897, 20 
pages, linotyped; the ))y-laws of the library, 1898, 11 pages, and a few 
circulars. In 1900 the library received 2,017 periodicals, at an expend- 
iture for subscriptions of J^l,261.27 (396 were presented).'" In accord- 
ance with its progrannue it offers an unusually rich collection of 
scientific journals and publications of learned societies. The entr}^ 
book for these is very practically arranged. 

The library is opened on week days from 9 a. m. till 1<» p. m., and 
is closed on Sundays. The books in the reading room may ])e con- 
sulted without formality ])y anyone, but after use are to be left on 
the tables. The current periodicals may be consulted in the periodical 
department or obtained for use in the reading room, like the books, by 
putting in a card for them. These are returned, after use, to the 
desk. The arrangement, according to the Dewey system, is such a 
practical one that on the average only a minute and thirty-eight seconds 
are required to place any book in the hands of the person asking for 
it. Books are lent out only in extraordinary cases, and then for but a 
short time, and only such books as are seldom called for. in case of 
special researches certain persons personall\' known to the director are 
allowed to take the books directly from the stacks. For that purpose 
permanent passes are issued. In 1900, 12 persons had such passes, and 
32 used them 287 times. Besides, there w^ere issued 730 single permis- 
sions to take books directly from the shelves. These ])ooks must be 
left lying upon the tables. Everything is recorded exactly, so that 
not onh^ is the number of books used known, but also to what particular 
divisions the}^ belong. In 1900 over 95,000 volumes and periodicals 
were used. Very valuable and rare books may be consulted only in 
the presence of an attendant. The tracing of plans, etc., is allowed 
onl}^ on celluloid tablets, which can be obtained in the library. 

As is everj'where evident, it is the one endeavor of the administra- 
tion to make the library as useful as possible. A greater lil)erality than 
is here practiced can not be imagined, and it gives great satisfaction to

know that, notwithstanding- tho absence of all such obstructions as are 
usually employed in Europe, the library since its foundation has lost 
only 14 volumes, and some of these, moreover, may 3^et be found, for 
an English library has recentl}^ reported the return of a volume that 
had been missing for forty-five years/' During the year 1900, 41,097 
persons used the library, more than 20 per cent of them women; that 
is to say, an average of 134 daily (maximum 282, minimum 35). The 
daily average of evening visitors from 5 to 10 o'clock was 30. Order 
cards to the number of 32,653 were issued. 

There are 28 employees, 10 of whom are women — 5 librarians, 1 
treasurer (and secretary), 13 assistants, 4 attendants, 3 pages, and 2 
janitors. The hours of service in summer are from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m.; 
in winter till 5.30 p. m., with ah hour for luncheon. From 5 to 10 in 
the evening another shift of employees comes on. 

While the chief librarian is the actual leader and soul of the whole, 
the institution is controlled ])y a board of 13 directors, who from their 
own number choose a president, 2 vice-presidents, and a secretary. 
The directors, excepting the president, are also formed into four com- 
mittees of 3 persons each, on finance, administration, buildings and 
grounds, and books. 

The resources of the John Crerar Librarv, on the interest of which 
it is supported, in 1900 were 13,400,000; the reserved building fund is 
$319,000; the reserve book fund, $131,000, and besides there is a secu- 
rity reserve fund of $16,200. The assets are, therefore, almost 
$4,000,000. When the building fund reaches the necessary sum the 
erection of a special building will be taken up. Quite recently the 
chances for this have been much improved, and there is now a prospect 
for obtaining a favorable building site.* The financial course has been 
very sound from the beginning. It was determined that the capital 
should never be touched, neither for the purchase of a site, for the 
structure itself, nor for an3'thing else whatever, but that all expendi- 
tures should be made entirely from the interests of the funded, 
bequeathed capital. 

The expenditures in 1899 were for rent, light, etc., $13,331; salaries 
and wages, $25,006; printing, $2,303; books, $17,587; periodicals, 
$4,468; binding, lettering, repairs, $8,403; miscellaneous, $6,895, mak- 
ing a total of $77,994. As, however, the income from the interest 
reached $139,944, $61,950 could be applied to the building fund. The 
library is insured for $107,000. 

The organization of the John (3rerar Library is as exemplary as it 
is original. The library is, with the exception of those of the univer- 
sities, one of the few purely scientific libraries in the United States. 
With its great wealth and its wisely restricted policy it will doubtless

in time advance to a hig-h rank and by the liberal principles of its 
administration become of great use. We may well l)e anxious to know 
how its librarian, Mr, C. W. Andrews, will solve the great problem of 
a new building after the many notable attempts in this line that have 
been made in the United States. 

14. NEWBERRY LIBRARY. 

This li1)rarv, like the John Crerar Library, owes its existence to the 
generosity of a rich citizen of Chicago, Walter Loomis New])erry/' 
who died in 1S68. In a will made in 1860'^ he left half of his prop- 
erty after the death of the direct heirs for a "free public library'' 
in the northern part of the city, and directed his two trustees to use a 
portion of the bequest for buildings, but to invest the remainder as 
they might think proper "for the growth, preservation, permanence, 
and general usefulness of such librar}'." After the direct heirs died 
in 1885, the property in question amounted to over $2,000,000,' and 
in 1887 there was $67,778 income available, so that steps could be 
taken toward its foundation. The two trustees took counsel with 
some other gentlemen, and it was decided to establish a reference 
library whose })ooks should not be lent out — like the John Crerar 
Library, which has adopted that plan — as distinguished from a circu- 
lating library from which the books may be taken out. In the same 
year the erection of a temporary building on the site of the testator's 
residence in the northern part of the city was taken in hand, some 
rooms were rented for immediate use, and there was appointed a 
librarian, W. F. Poole, who for fourteen years had occupied a similar 
position in the public library of Chicago and was one of the leading 
librarians of America (among other things he founded in 1853 the 
Index to Periodical Literature which is still continued), and two other 
emplo3"ees. Forty thousand dollars was appropriated for books and 
pamphlets. In the spring of 1888 some 14,000 volumes were installed 
in the provisional building, and the library was opened to the pul)lic. 

At the beginning of 181>u a removal was made to another provisional 
building not far from the tirst one and near the site on which it was 
intended to build the final structure. This was a one-storied, fireproof

1630. He lived subsequent to 1833 as a banker in Chic-ago, possessed a fine library, 
belonged among others to the Chicago Board of Education, and was president of the 
Historical Society. From 1857, because of his health, he spent every winter in 
southern France. Not only is he renowned for his own magnificent benefaction 
which keeps his memory permanently green, but his example induced the founda- 
tion of the John Crerar Library in another part of the city (see p. 451).

hoiiso, ])uilt for the purpose, 175 feet lono- by 65 feet wide, capa))le of 
holdino- 20(),()(H) voluiiie.s. The transfer of over !)0,000 books, pam- 
phh'ts, etc., was completed in a week. The ])uiklin^ contained an 
auditorium in which up to the year 1892 1:2 lectures had been g-iven 
to audiences varying from 220 to 550 persons, under the auspices of 
an association that had been formed with the name the Newberry 
Library Center for Universit}- Extension. In the same year the 
library, then managed by a single surviving trustee, was incorporated 
])y the State under the name of the Newberry Lil)rary, and the 
trustee mentioned nominated a board of 13 trustees that had the power 
to elect its own president. ELleven of these tirst ti'ustees or directors 
still retain their office. They are all men of wealth and prominence in 
the city, all are at the head of great affairs, some of them of interna- 
tional reputation. At the end of 1893 the new library building was 
ready, the transfer of over 150,000 books, pamphlets, etc., being com- 
pleted in ten da3^s. 

The general plan for the building was already settled upon in 1888, 
as follows: It was to provide sufficient room to meet the demands of 
at least twenty-live 3^ears and to be so constructed that additions to the 
original plan could be built from time to time; it must avoid " the con- 
fessed errors of the conventional stjde, it nmst have the eiiuipment of 
what is in the highest sense an educational institution — an audience 
room, reading rooms, study rooms, and every arrangement that would 
make the resources of the library availa))le to those seeking its treas- 
ures. It must have also the conveniences for administration, for 
study, and for the storage of books, which the concurrent experience 
of modern times demands." This tine problem, conceived according 
to the ideas of W. F. Poole, was in 1888 confided to the architect, 
Henry Ives Col)b. In 1889 the site was selected, about one and a half 
acres, in a small park, midway between Lake and Lincoln parks, not 
far from the shore of the lake, in a region comparatively free from 
smoke and near a great artery of travel with an electric railway. The 
building, ])egun in 1890, required an expenditure of over $500,000, 
which was defrayed from the accumulated interest and a part of the 
capital. The great structure is three-storied,^ built of pink Milford, 
Connecticut, granite and presents an imposing as well as a tasteful 
appearance, especially in summer, under the high old trees of Walton 
Place. The present structure, however, is only a third of the contem- 
plated one, which is to form a great quadrangle with a court in the 
center. Internal convenience to a certain extent has been sacrificed 
to architectural beauty. The basement is 10 feet high, the first floor 
20 feet, the second and third floors 26 feet each, and the fourth floor 



<i In America it if^ called five-storied, as the basement and ground floor are each 
counted as a story, but often, also, as in this case, the ground floor is counted as the 
(irst story and the basement not included in the enumeration of stories.

15 feet. These heij^hts so greatly exceed the heights of the book 
stacks, which are 7 feet 6 inches high, and which can be used without 
ladders, that a large free space remains above them, and the books are 
also lighted laterally from above. This has been done to give them 
"light and breathing space," but I am not aware that books suffer 
even in closed cases, and it contradicts the principles of modern library 
arrangement, according to which the books should be compressed into 
as narrow a space as possible, which, owing to the rapid increase of 
books in our prolific times, is the only possible method of preventing 
a too wide extension of the building. For this reason stacks are piled 
directly on stacks with hardly any free space between. Sufficient air

for " breathing" is afforded by good ventilation, and the electric light 
to-day affords means of temporary illumination of the darkest corners, 
while the daylight, bleaching everything that it falls upon, can not be 
considered in any case as the most desirable. The book stacks are 10 
inches deep. ^ 

In March, 1901, there were in the library 229,361 books, pamphlets 
(71,859), maps, manuscripts, etchings, and autographs (of which 56 
per cent were in languages other than English), an average for the 
fourteen years of 16,000 numbers a year, so that at the end of 1901 
there will be almost one-quarter of a million. The present building 
has room for 900,000; with the prospective later building there would 



462 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 



be room for 3,000,000, which, at the present rate of increat^o, would 
.siifKcc for two hundred years, but with the modern arrano-ement of the 
book stacks, like those in the Congressional Library at Washington, 
for example, the building would certainl}^ hold double that number, if 
not many more: The Newberry Library has therefore a chance for 
unchecked development in this direction.

The floor plans shown in figs. 48-52 give, with the legends, an idea 
of the arrangement of the rooms. Perhaps it would have been more 
judicious to have avoided the running of a corridor along the inner 
wall of the building, as it cuts off the light to the book rooms from 
this side and, besides, makes the access more difficult, ])ut the halls, 
with their absolutely plain light decoration in greenish walls and white 
ceilings, and the antehalls, decorated with paintings and busts, make 
an excellent, charming, and pleasing impression, and they should 
undoulotedl}^ ])e considered as very successful. The tirst story has a

halls where they are not allowed to work unmolested. The machines 
and ventilators are set up in the basement, whereby injurious tremors 
and disturbing- noisi^s arc occasioned in the building. The electric 
light is furnished l)y the Edison Company. The ventilation was at 
first so arranged that no air could enter through the. windows, which 
were tightly screwed down, it being forced into the building already 
washed and purified. However, one "couldn't breathe there," so it is

gressional Library at Washington and elsewhere. I shall speak more 
fully of this important subject when I treat of the public library (see 
p. 473). While the books could, with the ventilation that was designed, 
be kept free from dust or nearly so, now they arc soiled without hin-

situation of the Newberry' Ijibrary is not so unfavora])le for soot and 
dust as that of the Crerar and public libraries, these bad conditions 
are notably present. 

The building its(>lf was constructed throughout in a tircproof man- 
ner, with nothing combustible except the window frames and doors. 
Clumsy wooden book stacks have, however, been installed, although, 
almost ever}' where these have in recent times given place to iron ones, 



464 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 



which are more elegant and in every respect to be preferred, as I 
have mentioned on previous pages and shall mention again. Wooden 
cases were chosen "because iron rusts in the damp climate of Chicago, 
because it is cold to the hand and is ugly." That iron easily rusts in 
Chicago is shown by the fact that in midsummer a pair of steel scissors, 
if not cleaned daily, soon becomes covered with a coating of rust, 
exactly as in the moist heat of the Tropics, but if the iron is suitabl}" 
covered with a coat of varnish it does not rust, as is clearly shown by 
the examples of iron work in John Crerar I^dbrary and the public 
library in Chicago. The other objections made to the use of iron are, 
if possible, still less tenable. The other furniture is also made of Avood, 
and not of iron, as in the building of the historical society. 

A very remarkable peculiarity of the installation of the Newberr}^ 
Librar}^, is that each principal science is assigned a room by itself, with 
facilities for reading, so that any one who wishes to read on a subject 
can go at once to the division relating to it, get his book very quickly 
and proceed to work. This is certainh', in many cases, a great advan-

tage, but often the division in which the book is to be sought is not 
known, and related subjects may sometimes be so distributed in vari- 
ous divisions that complications can not be avoided. For earnest 
students, well acquainted w ith the library, the arrangement is certainly 
of the very greatest use. Under this arrangement, besides the prin- 
cipal reading room with 100 places, in the second story, there are two 
reading rooms (medicine), with 32 places, each in the first stor}^, 3 in 
second story (philosophy, history, art, and literature), with a total of 
104 places, and two in the third story (genealogy and music, natural 
sciences), each with 40 places, making a grand total of 316 places. 

As alread}' briefl}- mentioned, under the John Crerar Library, the 
Newberry Library principally confines itself to certain classes of sub- 
jects, and therefore sold to the former institution, in 1896, a part of 
its scientific stock, namely, 6,331 volumes and 1,483 pamphlets, for 
|116,000. The Newberry Library has the following 6 divisions: Medi- 
cine, bibliography, history, philosophy, art and literature, science, and it 
is strongest on the subjects of medicine, bibliography, American local 
history, genealogy, music, and in periodicals and papers of societies- 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 465 

On the first floor is the division of medicine (20, 21), with a special 
room named after Dr. N. Senn, professor of surger^^ in Rush Medical 
College in Chicago, who, three days after the library moved into its new 
building, promised a great part of his medical books, on the ground 
that it was a fireproof structure, and wlio also did much afterwards for 
the Newberry Library. He has also bought and presented the library 
of E. du Bois-Roymond, comprising 10,200 volumes and pamphlets, « 
and that of Surg. W. 15. Baum, of Gottingen. The Senn collection 
by itself embraces 23,400 numbers. The division of medicine com- 
prised in May, 1001, ,33,972 books and 27,583 pami)hlcts, among which 
were 459 periodicals. It will therefore compare with the largest 
medical libraries in New York and Philadelphia. The medical library 
of the United States Army Medical Museum in Washington has 
352,000 books and pamphlets and contains 1,500 medical journals. 
The nucleus of the medical portion of the Newberry Library was 
formed by a stock of 17,000 volumes and pamphlets, which had been 
deposited b}' 4 medical societies of Chicago in the public library, and 
were transferred from thence in 1890. There is besides this, in the 
first story, bibliography (39), which is represented best; office rooms 
(31, 34, 38), and a nuiseum (24). This museum held in May, 1901, 153 
manuscripts,* 315 incunabula, 212 volumes, specimens of artistic book 
bindings, 53 various other book bindings, 96 illustrated manuscripts 
from the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries, 113 Aldines, 97 Elzevirs, 
27 Estiennes, Giuntas, etc., 150 Americana in first and rare editions, 
autograph copies and editions de luxe, '" and 213 various volumes for 
showing methods of illustration and of modern typograpli}' — all pro- 
vided with descriptive labels. The collection of fine bindings extends 
from Maioli (1549) and the Groliers (1550-15(35) to the Frenchmen 
Bouzonnet-Trautz and the Englishman Bedford, and others (nineteenth 
century). From the sixteenth century there are 25 examples, from the 

«I found in this, papers from my own pen, which I hud sent to liim, my former 
teacher, out of respect. 

^ The oldest is a Greek manuscript of the evangelists, from the twelfth century, 
that E. J. Goodspeed has described in the American Journal of TJieologij, 1899. 

<^ American history has been espei-ially kept in view in the Newberry Lil)rary from 
the beginning, and in 1S95 it came into the possession of a collection of 5,000 volumes 
relating to the earliest times, which had been collected l)y one of the trustees, E. E. 
Ayer. At ])resent a thorough descriptive catalogue is being prepared of the entire 
7,000 works of rare Americana, which contain a great deal on the North American 
Indians, and also rare, early maps of the American Continent. On this catalogue 
there are working, at the expense of Mr. Ayer, about 10 specialists of rank in the 
United States, the library, itself, however, assuming the conduct of the matter and 
the bibliographical arrangement of the entire material. It has also drawn up a com- 
prehensive sclu^me for tlie coworkers, by which they proceed according to common 
points of view. This \ei-y comprehensive critical catalogue ju'omises to be a work 
of eminent bibliographic significance. It is fortunate in obtaining the special support 
of the gentlemen lueutioned.

seventeenth 14, from the eighteenth 22, and from the nineteenth 109 
English, 187 French, and 40 various. All are chronologically arranged, 
so that they can be studied according to periods, countries, and individ- 
uals. The walls of the museum are, like the antehalls, decorated with 
pictures and busts. As early as 1888, the American painter, G. P. A. 
Healy, living in Paris, presented a collection of nearly 50 oil portraits, 
painted by himself since 1841, among which are portraits of Lincoln, 
(xrant, Sherman, Sheridan, the founder Newberry, and the painter 
himself; of busts there are, in the same place, Dante, Shakespeare, 
Newberry, and Henry Clay. In the antehalls there are busts of 
Blaine, Thiers, Guizot, Lesseps, Liszt, Stanley, and others, as well as 
reliefs of Demosthenes, Shakespeare, Wagner, Handel, and Men- 
delssohn, and also three high reliefs by J. Gelert, each 13 feet long 
by 5 feet wide, representing La Salle's expedition through Illinois, 
1680, Fort Dearborn in 1812, and a scriptorium — Benedictine monks 
working on manuscripts, 1456. All these constitute the beginning of 
an art collection whose special advancement will be deferred to a 
future time. 

In the second story is a large reading room (48) with 100 seats, 
where there are immediately accessible to the public 340 volumes of 
general reference works, encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc. ; 801 volumes 
of current periodicals and papers of societies, 94 Rudolph indexer 
books, with shelf catalogues for philosophy, sociology, and religion, 
which subjects are to be found in the neighboring hall, No. 44; 133 
Rudolph indexer books, with author catalogues for general works, and 
finally, a map case, with 10 maps on rollers. Nearby (49) are periodi- 
cals. In 1900 there were 1,260 periodicals taken, among which, as 
already mentioned, were 459 on medical subjects, the others being 
distributed, by nationalities, as follows: 569 American, 246 German, « 
215 English, 126 French, 3T Italian, 12 Belgian, 11 Swedish, 8 Cana- 
dian, 7 Swiss, 6 Dutch, 5 Spanish, 3 each of Norwegian, Danish, Rus- 
sian, Japanese, 2 each of Chinese and Bohemian, and 1 each of Mexican 
and North American Indian. Further, history (42), with subsection 
of history, biography and genealogy, geography and travels, antiqui- 
ties, and manners and customs; also philosophy (44), with the subsections 
philosophy and religion, sociology,^ and instruction. 1 will mention a 
collection of 88 rare old Bibles from 1476 on, as well as an example 
of the 16mo. "Caxton" Bible of 1,052 pages, which on June 30, 1877, 
was printed within twelve hours at Oxford, in an edition of only 100 
copies, as well as finely bound in London. '^ There is also a large and

rare collection of American and English hynni books. Finall}^ art 
and humanistic sciences (50, 51), with subsections of art, literature, 
and languao-es." I will mention 324 lexicons in " almost all languages." 

In the third story is the department of science (71), with subsections 
of natural science, Congressional documents, bound newspaper files, 
and special collections. The union of such a mixture under a depart- 
ment of science is not exactly happy. I will mention as specialties 
1,200 volumes on China, 1,882 numbers on fishes, fish culture and 
angling, Egyptian and sporting collections. There is also found in 
the third story genealogy, and the musical library (57), with scores of 
the great composers, works on the history and theorj' of music, as 
well as on instruments, together with critical papers, journals, biog- 
raphies; also lexicons and cyclopedias in "alP' languages, and finally, 
works on the early Greek music and the early Italian writers. The 
principal item of interest is the musical collection of Count Pio Resse 
in Florence, which was bought in 1888. Recently the well-known 
American musician, Theodore Thomas, gave to this institution his 
great musical library. Finally, there are in the third story three lec- 
ture rooms (63-65) that hold 100 persons each, and a hall (56) which is 
temporarily assigned to the Friday Club, the most exclusive literary 
and social woman's club in Chicago. 

In the fourth story is the well-appointed bookbinderv (78) — ever}^- 
thing is bound in the building. The rest of the rooms, except one for 
duplicates (73), are vacant. 

On either side of the principal stairway there is a passenger eleva- 
tor from the basement to the fourth story, besides a book elevator at 
another place, as shown in the plans, figs. 48-52. 

The installation and marking of the books is done according to Cut- 
ter's seventh system '^ with some modifications. Ever}- section has the 
Cutter letters and numbers and to this is added an author's number 
according to a special list of the Newberry LibraiT. The books stand 
in the order of their numbers, as in the Dewey decimal system. 

The method of cataloguing of this librar}^ is quite peculiar and 
extremely ingenious, and is according to the system invented by the 
assistant librarian, A. J. Rudolph, a Hungarian, who from 1879 to 
1894 was assistant librarian in the San Francisco Free Public Librar^^

Louis Lucien Bonaparte, who died in 1891. It contsiined 15,000 vohinies on 
European languages. Negotiations for this lasted two years. It is a most important 
acquisition.

door opened. The titles of the books are placed upon strips of card- 
board 4 inches long and 1 to 6 inches or more in width, as ma}^ be 
necessary; these are shoved into a thin tin plate or frame grooved at 
the sides, 15 inches long and 4i inches wide, so that each such plate 
nui}'^ contain 30 to 50 titles. In order to lighten the plates they are 
perforated with 18 holes of one-eighth inch diameter in two rows. 
The plates are hung with their long edges together like an endless chain, 
which runs over two drums and can be turned either to the right or 
to the left. As the strips of cardboard are easily moved new titles 
may be put in as needed. A case holds 1,000 frames with 30,000 to 
50,000 titles which can })e passed in review, either quickly or slowly 
at will. A Rudolph continuous indexer, with 500 frames for 15,000 to 

25,000 titles, costs $150 and can be 
furnished by Thomas Kane &Co., 137 
Wabash avenue, Chicago. A quite 
similar arrangement is the Rudolph 
indexer book, lig. 51. This is 12^ 
inches long and 8 inches wide and con- 
tains 10 stiff leaves for from 000 to 800 
titles. It costs at the house just men- 
tioned $5.75, and is also prepared in 
other lengths and thicknesses. Leaves 
may be shoved in and out at will, or 
a volume that has l)ecome too thick 
may l)e divided into two. These two 
methods are extensively used in the 
New])erry Librar}' — 1,075 Rudolph in- 
dexer books, 103 being for the genea- 
logical catalogue, and 012 for the shelf 
and principal catalogue. 

A further specialty of this library 
is the "Rudolph pamphlet binder,'' 
bound on the same principle as the Rudolph indexer book shown in fig. 
51, a practical and ver}" tasteful although somewhat expensive way of 
binding a series of pamphlets together. A cheaper and good way of 
binding single pamphlets is afforded by the ""Newberry binder,"' a 
simple cover of enameled cardboard with a linen back, rather neatly 
made up. 

The cards for the indexer are manifolded upon the typewriter, but 
if many are recjuired, they are now multiplied by means of Rontgen 
rays, according to a method invented b}' Mr. Rudolph but not yet 
published." The titles are written, one after the other, upon sheets 

« Mr. Rudolph in this way manifolds both print and illustrations by means of the 
Rontgen rays. He also uses a device, as simple as it is effective, for splitting apart 
leaves that are printed or illustrated on both sides, in case it is desired to use both

by the typewriter, pasted upon cardboard, and then cut apart to slip 

into the indexer. 

All that can be done by the l)ookbinder, like the mounting of cards, 
the preparation of the lludolph indexer books and the covers for the 
pamphlets, the pasting and cutting of strips for the indexer, repairs, 
etc., is done in the bindery of the library. All books are stitched 
with from four to seven threads which are often of silk, the backs are 
covered with binder's gauze and provided with linen guards stitched 
on. All plates are attached to muslin guards, uuich-used volumes 
have parchment corners, and all are gilded on the upper edge. All 
parts of yet incomplete volumes of journals, and works issued in parts, 
are temporarily bound in Rudolph binders. The cover of one of these 
binders costs the library 30 cents, and the appliances for holding each 
pamphlet, 10 cents, so the cost of a volume of five pamphlets would be 
80 cents, certainly a relatively heavy expense, but such a volume is 
extremely solid and very elegant. If a pamphlet is to be bound by 
itself, the simple Newberry binder is used, which costs the library 
4i cents. The production of the Rudolph indexer books costs the 
library, for the size 12i by 10 inches, with 10 stiff leaves, or 19 by 10 
inches with 15 flexible leaves, $2.20 each. 

sides of the same leaf. A further very remarkable manifolding process in blue- 
print is used by Mr. Rudolph for the formation of catalogues. For instance, the 
Newberry Library in 1899 prepared 10 copies of a folio volume of 500 pages, which 
bears the title: "British Museum. Catalogue of Printed Books. Accessions, Janu- 
uary, 1880, to March, 1899. Academies, with an Index." It ig an alphaljetically 
arranged register, comprising some 5,000 titles (with an index of about 3,000 entries) 
of accessions concerning "Academies" acquired by the British Museum from 1880 
to 1899; these titles were contained in 446 single publications of the British Museum, 
so that it was difficult to find anything in them. They were cut apart, arranged in 
al])habetical order, and manifolded by blueprinting, which is very quickly done and 
very cheap. A page of 25 titles costs 4 cents exclusive of labor, a volume of 500 
pages therefore costs $20 a copy. It w^as contemplated to combine in 40 such vol- 
umes, alphal)etically arranged, the 900,000 titles of new accessions to the British 
Museum from 1880 to 1899, but this was stopped after the first volume, because the 
British Museum had, in the meantime, the prospect of a more speedy publication of 
its supplementary catalogue of printed books. The method employed by the New- 
berry Library is, however, so remarkable and promising that I did not wish to leave 
it unmentioned. Mr. Rudolph had the great kindness to jaresent me with a copy of the 
10 that had been produced, as well as to provide me with examples of the various 
stages of the work, wdiich I will be glad to show to any who are interested. On the 
method itself he has published an article in the Li hrari/ Journal, XXIV, 1899, ]ip. 
102-105, "The Bluei)rint Process fur Printing Catalogues." I will further say that the 
leaves of the catalogue I have mentioned have blueprinting on both sides, hut which 
is only apparently effected by pasting together, back to back, two very thin leaves 
printed only on one side. Blueprinting can only bedone on oneside, and the originals, 
too, must not bear print upon the back. Since this is the case with 200 of the first 
leaves of the British Museum Catalogue just referred to, which later has been pub- 
lished, printed on only (me side, it has been necessary, before their reproducti()n by 
blueprint, to S[)lit them apart, whicli for this purpose has also been accomplished. 
Mr. Rudolph's ingenuity has been successful in overcoming all difficulties.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 



The following catalogues are kept: 

1. Two copies of an author's catalogue (exclusive of medicine), one 
of which is upon cards for use of employees, and the other in 138 Ru- 
dolph indexer book's for the public in the large reading room (48) of 
the second story. 

2. A (jeneral dictionary catalogue (exclusive of medicine) in Rudolph 
continuous indexers and in Rudolph indexer books for the public 
in the large reading room. In this, therefore, are found authors, 
titles, subjects, and references arranged in a single alphabetical series. 
This catalogue contains 450,000 to 500,000 entries and when complete 
will fill 10 Rudolph continuous indexers and 500 Rudolph indexer 
books. For practical well-considered reasons, which I have no space 
to enter into here, all of the strips which have 10 or more typewritten 
lines are arranged in the books, and all shorter ones in the indexer.

that is, a subject catalogue of all independent works, with exception 
of those relating to medicine, in 392 Rudolph indexer books — one copj^^ 
for the employees, and one distributed through the various divisions 
of the library for the public.

6. A genealogical index of American families, with over 500,0(»<> 
entries, which contain far more than a million references, in 463 
Rudolph indexer books. This very comprehensive catalogiie owes its 
origin to the circumstance that everywhere in tlie United States peo- 
ple are veiy much given to genealogical researches, everyone seeming 
eager to show that his ancestors belong to the early colonists, whose 
footsteps leading from the ancestral home are traced out with the 
greatest zeal; therefore all sorts of family and local histories have 
been purchased which could be procured in America, and the index in 
question is almost an index for the existing American, and for man}- 
English, family records. It includes over 200,000 families with their 
branches from the year 1565 on to the present time. The catalogue 
was begun in 1897. Four persons work on it uninterruptedl}", and it 
is to be printed. There are, to be sure, printed indices of the kind, 
such as those of Whitmore and Durrie (1895), but the former contains 
only 12 notices under Smith, the latter only 196, while the Newberr}- 
index contains 976. A more detailed description of this undertaking 
is found in the Lihrary Journal^ XXIV, 1899, pages 53 to 55.

These show relatively large variations, together with a general 
decreasing number of readers and a corresponding decrease in use, 
})ut the figures are nearly constant in the last three years. Compared 
with the John Crerar Library the relatively large attendance of women 
is striking, a difference which may be owing to the departments kept 
up by the Newberry Library — art, literature, music — for "popular" 
books are hardly kept. During my visit I saw a couple of quite young- 
girls, still children, working there, and when I asked what they were 
doing, was told they were probably reading up for a school task that 
had been set them for home work. I mention this because it is so 
entirely contrary to our German practice, for if such tendencies should 
occur at all we would, though mistakenly, certainly curb thiMU. 

No lunches may be eaten in the library rooms, but at a delinite time 
a room {<dS) is open for this purpose. 



472 ' REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

In the three lecture halls of the third story lectures are t^iven l)y 
professors of the University of Chicago (see also, p, 460). 

The number of employees is 53, as follows: 1 librarian, 1 assistant 
librarian, 21 assistants and cataloguers, 7 pages, 3 clerks, 9 book- 
binders, 6 attendants, 1 engineer, 2 checkers, 2 watchmen. As far as 
one can judge from the annual reports, which are brief and indefinite, 
the library had spent up to the close of 1899, $391,843 for ])ooks, pei'i- 
odicals, and fittings; about $340,000 for purposes of administration — 
that is, for fourteen years about an annual average of $28,000 for 
books, etc., and |24,000 for administration, there being an annual 
average increase of about 17,000 numbers, about one-third of which, 
however, were gifts; these in 1900 were 3,675 numbers. In 1900 the 
income from the Newberry bequest — and no other income is availa- 
ble «— amounted approximately to $108,000, of which about $31,000 
was used for salaries, about $10,000 for books, about $1,200 for 
heating and lighting, about $4,800 for bookbinding, including that of 
the catalogues, about $35,000 for repairs, etc., to the houses ow^ned 
by the library, for insurance, postage, freight, printing, etc. The 
remainder of over $25,000 is probably held in reserve, as there is no 
information concerning it. 

The first librarian. Doctor Poole, died in 1894, and in his place was 
appointed J. V. Cheney, who since 1887 had been head librarian of the 
San Francisco Public Library, from Avhich he brought to Chicago 
A. J. Rudolph, his right-hand man, and here introduced with him the 
Rudolph methods of cataloguing.* 

The library has thus far published nothing except short annual 
reports. 

Only quite exceptionally are books allowed to be taken from the 
building. They are then sent to a library that is nearer to the scholars 
who may require them, such as the University of Chicago, the Field 
Columbian Museum, the Northwestern Universit}^ at Evanston, etc. 
The question as to whether a reference or a circulating librar}^ is the 
most useful form is well worthy of ijivestigation; there must certainly 

«The city levies no taxes on the library itself, though it does on the buildings, 
from which the institution derives a great portion of its income, and this tax amounts 
to over $25,000 annually. This seems astonishing when the public utility of the 
Newberry Library is taken into account, l)ut, as with us, in the matter of taxes all 
generous feelings are al>andone<l. For example, the Royal Dresden museums, wiiich 
are exclusively kept up by the State, must pay taxes on articles imported from for- 
eign countries, only objects for the collections themselves being free; neither do tliey 
enjoy free postage, as is the case with all university institutes and many similar 
museums in other German States.

be many local conditions which bear upon the matter. In our small 
German university cities, for example, where learned men use the 
books for exhaustive study, and the same liooks are rarely wanted by 
difl'erent persons at the same time, and where besides there is hardly 
any outside public that uses the library, a reference library is certainly 
not to be preferred to the lending- library system now in use. But in 
cities where a great, general public has need for books, it appears to 
me that the lending principle adopted l>y us is less called for, but cer- 
tainly in this case such means ought to be adopted as obtained in the 
American reference libraries. The libraries uuist be opened to ever}^ 
one from morning until evening without onerous conditions, and 
sufficient opportunity nmst be afforded for undisturbed reading. The 
catalogue nmst be, as there, made practical and accessible, the books 
must he placed according to an easily intelligible system, access must 
be had to the bookshelves: above all there must be employees who are 
exclusively at the service of the public and make it their principal 
business to attend to readers — arrangements, in short, which, with some 
exceptions, we are not at all acquainted with in (jermany and do not 
even anticipate. 

The Newberry and the John Crerar libraries are a noble pair, twin 
children of civic patriotism. In spite of their being a mile and a 
quarter distant from each other they may be considered as a unit, since 
their field of work is more or less limited with regard to each other. 
Chicago has in them, a 1)eautiful, excellentl}^ arranged, most freely 
accessible, scientific, public reference library, in two separate build- 
ings, already comprising 325,000 numbers,'* and the total collection of 
the two libraries will, Avithin twenty-five years, at the present rate of 
increase of 27,000 numbers a year, amount to 1,000,000. The Berlin 
library has a round million, the Paris librar}^ 3,000,000, and the London 
4,000,000 to 5,000,000 numbers. Chicago, however, loves to make 
unexpected leaps in its development, and who knows how quickly 
fortune maj^ confound such a calculation. The noble contest between 
the Newberry Library and the John Crerar Library will certainly 
produce the most elaborate results. 

15. CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY. 

The idea of a public library, conceived by BcMijamin Franklin in 
1732, has received a most magnificent development in the United 
States, while in Germany the slight beginnings that have been made 
are hardly worth mentioning. "America has taken tlu^ h^ad in develop- 
ing the usefulness of public libraries,'' said Thomas Greenwood in 1894,

Libraries: A History of the Movement and a Manual for the Organiza- 
tion and Manag-cment of Rate-supported Libraries (598 pp., London). 
But since then the rise of the public libraries in the United States has 
been even more extraordinary, and as a crowning achievement of the 
entire movement the public libraries of Boston and Chicago bear wit- 
ness, and this will soon be further exemplified in New York, as men- 
tioned in Part I of this paper. 

In 1899 there were in the United States 7,184 public libraries, with 
35,000,000 books." Each village, as one may say, possesses one,^ and 
their influence upon general culture is perhaps as great as that of the 
schools. These public libraries are maintained, some of them by the 
community, some by private persons, and some by both. Andrew 
Carnegie alone has, since 1886, founded 66 libraries, costing $8,500,000, 
and quite recently he has founded 65 more in New York City, at a cost 
of $5,200,000.'' The Boston Public Library, with 15 branch reading 
rooms and 14 delivery stations, costs the city yearly $288,641, or over 
50 cents each for a population of 561,000. The Chicago Public Library, 
with 6 branch reading rooms and 65 delivery stations, besides stations 
in the public schools,*^^ costs the city $263,397 — that is 15^ cents annu- 
ally each for a population of 1,700,000. Massachusetts has most com- 
pletely developed the public-library system, and it is a mark of honor 
on the escutcheon of the State. However, the Chicago Public Librar^^ 
stands foremost in the world in lending each year, without charge, 

«X. M. Butler, Education in the United States, 1900, p. 30. According to E. I. 
Antrim, The latest Stage of Library Development, in the Forum, XXXI, p. 337, 
1901, there are now 8,000 libraries, with 50,000,000 books; according to the United 
States Bureau of Education, No. 232 (Public, Society, and School Libraries), 1897, pp. 
340 and 367, there were, in 1896, 4,026 public, society, and school libraries of 1,000 vol- 
umes and over, with 33,000,000 books and 5,500,000 pamphlets, of which there were 
2 having over 500,000, 4 having over 300,000, 28 having over 100,000, 69 having over 
50,000, 155 having over 25,000, 411 with over 10,000, 630 with over 5,000, 2,727 with 
over 1,000, and 3,167 with over 300. The number of German books in American 
libraries has been discussed recently by L. Triang in an interesting article in the 
Berliner Tagehlatt of May 7, 1901 (Parlament's edition). 

& Recently traveling libraries have been established for farmers living in isolated 
situations (see p. 400 of this paper). These go from village to village (see Antrim, 
Forum, XXXI, p. 338). In the New York parks books are lent free. 

c Besides this he has founded 18 in Great Britain, at a cost of $720,000 (University 
of the State of New York, Home Education Bulletin, No. 31, May, 1900, p. 69). 
Further, lie gave $1,660,000 for other scientific endowments (Rejiort Commissioner 
of Education, 1898-99, 1900, Pt. 1, p. 1054, and Scknce, November 23, 1900, p. 816). 
He writes, incidentally, concerning his gift — one can not call it a princely gift, for 
princes have not sufficient money to do it^o the director of the Public Library in 
New York, Dr. J. S. Billings: "I should esteem it a rare privilege to be permitted 
to furnish the money as needed for the buildings, say, $5,200,000" (Bulletin, New 
York Public Library, V, 1901, p. 85). (Up to 1903 Mr. Carnegie had founded over 
1,000 libraries and given away nearly $100,000,000. See the Chicago Sunday Trib- 
une, May 17, 1903, p. 37.

As the great lire in October, 1871, practically destroyed all li])raries,

with books, and there quickly came in this way, from Great Britain 
and the rest of Europe, and from America, a total of 7,000 volumes, the 
nucleus of the public li])rary which was founded in January, 1872. In 
January, 1873, a reading room was opened temporarily in the city hall, 
and in March, 1874, the library, with over 17,000 volumes, was estab- 
lished not far from its present location. From 1875 on it was again

1897, with about 230,000 books, it was transferred in .six and one-half 
days to its present palace," and fourteen days thereafter, on October

pu))lic. Ill 1803 the corner stone of the edifice was laid, not fai' from 
the former Fort Dearborn, whose garrison was butchered l)y the 
Indians in IS12, and wliich was the first permanent settlement in the 
swamp upon whicli Cliicago hiter arose. The building comprises a 
quadrangle between Washington and liandolpli streets and Michigan 
avenue, its long east front facing a park along the lake. The site is 
immediately adjacent to the principal business center of the city, and 
occupies about li acres of ground, the building itself l)eing 330 feet 
long, 146 feet wide, and 100 feet high above the pavement (exclusive of 
the balustrade). It is well orientated as to the sun, in that the free, 
long side faces toward the east: but opposite the remaining sides are 
high houses. The funds for the building were raised from 1891 to 
1896 by six annual tax levies, amounting to $2,000,(K)0, which was 
borne most willingly by the people of Chicago, an example of the 
public spirit of that city often unjustly charged with worldliness.^

The disposition of the interior was more or less determined ))y the 
rights of the adjoining property holders, who stipulated that the 
entrance should be on the narrow side, but especially by the fact that 
the building must include a large memorial hall with many accessory 
rooms for the (xrand Army of the Kepublic, the memorial hall in per- 
petuity, the accessory rooms to be devoted to this use for some 50 
years. 

The hands of the architects were somewhat tied by these and .several 
other restrictions. The location within the cit}', where sulphurous 
gases arise from soft coal used, forbade frescoes and other usual kinds 
of decoration. As it was not wished to renounce rich external orna- 

« Frederick Harrison, one of the most eminent English historians and writers, says, 
in the report of his recent visit to the United States {Niuetee^itlt Century, June, 
1901): "Chicago struck me as l)eing somewhat unfairly condemned as devoted to 
nothing but Mammon and pork. Certainly during my visit I heard of nothing but 
the progress of education, university endowments, people's institutes, libraries, 
museums, art schools, workmen's model dwellings and farms, literary culture, and 
scientific foundations." 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDUKD INSTITUTIONS. 477 

mont, but on the contrary' to use this for the pleasure and refinement 
of the people, therefore mar})le and mosaic work were chosen, in the 
hope that it might wear as well as that which Justinian in the fifth 
century employed in the church of St. Sophia at Constantinople. As 
prime necessities it was stipulated that there must be security from 
fire and plenty of light. The books must also be placed centrally in 
order to be easily accessible, and it was further prescribed, among 
other things, that there should be convenient public access to the 
rooms, spacious book delivery and reading rooms, and such furni.shing 
and arrangement of all the rooms that they could easih' be kept clean. 

C. A. (^oolidge, of the firm of architects Shepley, Rutan & Cool- 
idge, of Boston and Chicago, who also built the Art Institute, solved 
this great prol)lem in a most satisfactory manner. In modern Europe 
I would not know where to find anything similar in this line; the new 
German library buildings certainly can not compare with it. The 
original estimates were not exceeded, the total cost of the building 
being, in round numbers, $2,125,000, including architects and builders' 
fees of about $112,000. It is a Renaissance structure, with Greek and 
Roman motives, the exterior of limestone with a base of granite, the 
stairway, on the southern side, like the entrance to an imperial Roman 
palace, or, b}^ electric light, it appears as a fair}^ castle of the Arabian 
nights, built of white Carrara marble with mosaics of colored glass, 
mother-of-pearl, and shell. The halls, saloons, and rooms are lined 
with marble. Ten different kinds of American and European marble 
were used. The walls and ceilings in some cases are overdecorated 
and florid; simplicity would here have been preferable in my opinion. 
The plain structure cost about $()00,000, the interior decoration about 
$500,000, independentl}^ of the decoration of the memorial Grand 
Army hall, which cost $75,000. I am quite unable, within the limits 
of this report, to give a description of the lavish magnificence here 
displa^'ed, and must also restrict m3^self as to ni}" illustrations, which 
would otherwise give the reader a better idea of it. 1 must content 
myself with saying that as a whole, whatever might be said of single 
portions, the structure is an imposing artistic creation, to which justice 
can not be done in a few words." 

The floor plans, figs. 55 to 57, show the arrangement of the 
rooms. The principal entrance, from Washington street, lies toward 
the south; the principal front, Michigan avenue, toward the east. 
The book stacks extend partly through three stories, there being six

plement, January, 1898; the Quarterly Book Rerleit!, December, 1897; Puhlic Libraries, 
November, 1897; The Outlook, October 2, 1897. It should be mentioned that nine- 
tenths of all the work was done in Chicago itself, certainly a testimony to the splendid 
ability of the industrial arts there. I have used especially the publication first cited, 
which is richly illustrated.

decks, one above the other. They are immediately l)ack of the deliv- 
er}^ room on the second story (Plate 30). 

This room, 144 feet long and 53 feet wide, runs across the entire 
building- and opens immediatel}' upon the principal stairway, consti- 
tuting- with that stairway the most splendid feature of the building. 
It is decoi-ated in the richest manner with marble and glass mosaics, 
especially in the high central cupola, which is 38 feet in diameter at 
its base and 11 feet high (36 feet abov^e the floor). Perhaps nothing 
similar to it has been produced since the fourteenth century. At the 
northern end of the second stor37^ are the rooms for the veterans 
(memorial hall, assembly hall, etc.). There is here inserted a mezza- 
nine story. Over this, in the third story, is the great reading room for 
current periodicals and newspapers (Plate 31), which, like the deliv- 
ery room, runs across the entire ])uilding, together with the reference 
room. The reading room has 415 seats and about 1(>() standing places 
at the newspaper racks, and the reference room, including the adjoin- 
ing rooms, has 225 seats; ^' the former is 36 feet high, 144 feet long, 
and 60 feet wide; the latter is 33 feet high, 144 feet long, and 42 feet 
wide. The collective area covered by all the rooms of the library, 
throughout all the stories, amounts to two and a half acres. At various 
places, as has been already mentioned for the north end of the second 
story, mezzanine stories are inserted, which has been ingeniousl}^ done 
without injury to the facade (Plate 28) b}^ placing the floor of the 
mezzanine behind the crossbar of a window and covering it, at the 
same time painting it dark below, so that from without it is almost 
invisible. The arrangement and designation of the remaining rooms 
are shown on the ground plans. The rear court, on the western side, 
which is open as an entrance for carriages to Garland place, is later to 
be built over, so that in the place of the now open right angle which 
appears in the plans of the second and third stories, there will be built 
three stack rooms which will di recti}' adjoin similar rooms in the flrst 
stor}" behind the delivery room. 

The vast machinery plant is placed in the basement. The public 
library is entirely independent, in that it supplies its own electric 
powe-r, heat, and light (26 arc and over 7,000 incandescent lamps), and 
it also has its own water reservoir, rendering it independent of the 
city supply, if necessary' , and suflicing for its normal wants for thirty 
hours. The arrangements of this underground world of machinery 
are admirable. Even in these regions there rules a high degree of 
elegance and magnificence. It is a faulty however, that the powerful 
engines stand in the building itself, and therefore shake it. In the 
evening, when they are working with their full power, there is at 
certain places a strong tremor not only disagreeable to feel, but very 

«A total of a thousand persons can work at the same time in the public library.

injurious to the buildincr itself, as, for example, to the mosaic floors, 
which already have sufl'ered at various places." If the engines must 
stand in the house itself, they should be isolated, as in Columbia Uni- 
versity, already mentioned, although this would be more difficult in 
the swamp3^ ground of Chicago than in the rocky region of Columl)ia 
University. Eight electric elevators serve for the incessant demands 
of visitors. The stairs are but little used. 

The problem of a fireproof building has here been perfectly solved. 
In Chicago, as well as elsewhere in America, it is customary, when 
constructing large buildings, to first of all erect a steel framework or 
skeleton, which runs from top to bottom and across the building (see 
fig. 58), and into this frame are set the walls of brick or stone (as with 
us a framework of wood is filled out with stones and clay) and the 
building can then be carried on from above downward, instead of the 
opposite, since each story is independent from the others and rests on 
its own foundation. In the public library this has been avoided, for 
if in such buildings stores of combustible goods begin to burn, the 
steel beams bend and the whole structure falls together like a house 
of cards. In the public library the steel construction rests upon the 
walls of the building, not the reverse, and steel supporting columns 
are entireh'^ avoided. The great spans between the walls are mostl}' 
bridged over with box girders, but also with plate and lattice girders 
between which are iron beams. The span of the box girders is 66 
feet. Fig. 59 gives a representation of the steel construction of the 
floor. The spaces between the floor beams are filled in with large 
porous terra-cotta blocks. The steel beams and supporting columns 
are also encased with terra cotta, which makes them absolutely fire- 
proof. The floors are laid in cement, upon which are set marble 
mosaics, glazed tile, or parquetry, the last, however, only in offices 
and workrooms, where it is covered with corcacin, to the value of 
about $3,500. The gang plates at the book stacks are made of hard 
glass or tile. The walls are wainscoted or lined with marble. Window 
casings and sashes,- as well as book stacks, are of iron (costing about 
$30,000), the other furniture (costing about $66,000) and the doors 
are of wood. On the latticework, doors, and elsewhere much rich 
bronze work is used. For important documents and rarities special 
fireproof vaults with iron cases are provided, as shown in fig. 60. 

On account of the swamp}' foundation of Chicago the librar}- rests 
upon 2,400 piles, each 55 feet long and of 12 inches diameter, that are 
driven to an average depth of 75 feet below the level of the street 

« Whether or not this is to be ascribed to the strong shaking alone I will not state 
I^ositively. It is also possible there is some fanlt with the cement base. In any 
event, however, tliese tremors can do no good to tlie building. I even see that they 
endanger its permanence, and that ultimately an engine room will have to be built 
outside.

Long length.s of tire hose are distributed everywhere. A'^er}^ ingenious 
and important also is the instalhition of the water sj'stem on the three 
sides of the building with houses opposite, by which, from the roof 
downward, a screen or veil of tiowing w^ater can be set in motion in case 
of tire, an arrangement that has already on one occasion practically 
proved its usefulness, and which is certainl}- worthy of imitation. The 
accessory stairways are of iron. The delivery room can be shut otf 
from the adjoining })ook stacks by steel roller shutters. No tire is 
allowed except that for heating in the basement. In the book bindery 
and in the rooms reserved for emplovees at the noon hour, etc. , electric 
heating apparatus is used. Everything, in fact, is done to reduce the 
danger from tire to a minimum. If one wished to be rigorously crit- 
ical, it might be adversely mentioned that the furniture, such as tables,*^ 




Fig. 00.— Chicago Public Library. A fireproof vault. (See p. 479.) 

stools, etc., as well as doors and elevators, are of wood, although there 
is no real danger, as the woodwork is very massive. Notwithstanding 
this, the building has recently been insured for $500,000, at an annual 
premium of $1,000, for the special reason that the adjacent buildings 
to the westward are c{uite near. The night service consists of a watch- 
man and engineers, the latter working in shifts of eight hours. The 
cleaning is for the most part done during the night, using the electric 
light (there is no other) as is needed. 

In an equalh^ successful manner the architects have solved the prob- 

a The table tops are unusually massive, but have the disadvantage of warping, so I 
found a great nunil)er of them, on this account, put aside for repairs. In the work- 
ing and office rooms some of them are, as an experiment, covered with linoleum. 
Iron tables Avith linoleum cover would certainly be preferable. There is, too, excel- 
lent iron furniture for rooms, made in America (see remarks on this subject, p. 880 
et seq.).

lem of everywhere providing abundance of liolit/ The hio-h, broad, 
closely spaced windows and the court (see plans) everywhere admit so 
much dajdight that nothing l)etter could have deen devised. This is 
especially the case on the eastern and northern sides; also in the 
delivery room with its large windows at both ends and the glass cupola, 
as well as in the reading rooms frequented by the public and at the 
book stacks. Oidy a few inner rooms of the ground floor are so dark 
that artificial light is necessar}" in the daytime. 

The demand for convenient access to the pul)lic rooms has also been 
successfully met. The delivery room of the second story, frequented 
daily by thousands, is convcnientlj^ reached by the magnificent stair- 
way of the south entrance unless it is preferred to use one of the four 
elevators near b}^, while the reading rooms of the north and east sides, 
which likewise are dail}^ visited b}^ thousands, can be directly reached 
by four elevators, by the south stairway, or by the central stai^wa3^ 
It is a special and novel architectural characteristic of this library that 
the reading rooms are situated at the top, while elsewhere the}' are 
ordinarily placed in a central hall, at ground level, and lighted from 
above, an arrangement that occupies a large ground area and has, 
besides, many other disadvantages, as is well known to ever^^one 
from experience. For this reason the new public library in New 
York, as already mentioned, adopted the plan of putting the reading 
rooms in the third story. Besides, the rooms can be much more 
([uickly reached by elevators than by stairways, only as in the Chicago 
Public Library, there must ])e a sufficient number at the disposal of 
the public. The greatest care has been given to these elevators. 
They are operated by electric power, therefore run ((uickly and noise- 
lessly, can be easily stopped or started, and their doors open and 
close automatically ])y atmospheric pressure. They are perfect. The 
grill work of the elevator openings at each story is of bronze, and the 
elevators themselves are ornamented with much ))eautiful bronze work. 
Besides the eight elevators for the public, there are two for the internal 
administration and six smaller ones for transporting books to and from 
the stacks. The elevators cost about $21,000. 

The heating is effected by a direct-indirect system with steam-heat- 
ing coils for use in cold weather and hot-air blast for milder weather. 
It is kept up entirely by the exhaust from the engines, and its cost is 
therefore relatively slight. Recently the so-called smokeless coal has 
been used, whereb}^ about $6,500 a year have been saved. The tem- 
perature is in some cases regulated automatically by thermostats, but 
usually on the spot l)y the opening and closing of heating flues. 

Ventilation. — In the basement seven fans draw out of the building 
327,000 cubic yards of air an hour through gigantic sheet-iron pipes 
and seven others blow in 280,000 cubic yards of fresh air. This air 
is warmed in cold weather, washed by passing through sprays of water,

again wanned, if necessary, by passing over hot pipes, and is forced 

into each room near the ceil- 
ing and drawn off near the 
floor. It can be independ- 
ently shut off or turned on 
for any of the rooms. At 
first none of the windows 
were arranged for opening, 
the plate glass being set in 
solid iron frames with cross- 
bars. By this arrangement 
only purified air could enter, 
except such as streamed in 
through the doors which 
open onto the street. This 
was very essential for keep- 
ing the interior of the build- 
ing and the books clean; but 
the apparatus did not work 
satisfactoril3^ The rooms 
were often too hot, and con-

opened, and thus the entire 
excellent!}^ devised system 
was rendered useless. At the 
time of the ver}^ high tem- 
perature that prevailed in 
Chicago at the beginning of 
September, 1899, I found the 
rooms intolerably warm, es- 
pecially those with an east 
and southeast exposure, in 
spite of the open windows and 
many electric fans placed 
everywhere. It could not 
have been w^armer with the

being like a bake oven. Much

ventilating" system, I visited the operating room of the Chicago Tele- 
phone Company in the seventh story of a Iniilding on Washington 
street, where a similai system has been going on for three years. 
It was put in because dust 
was injurious to the electric 
contact. 1 found there 120 
women crowded closely in a 
relatively small room where 
daj" and night they do nothing 
but make and break connec- 
tions, a slavery indeed. " The 
ventilation, however, had not 
been operating for a fortnight, 
as a wing to the building was 
under construction and the 
windows were open, so that 
the noise of the street was 
very anno3'ing. I learned that 
the women who had complained 
of the ventilation S3'stem since 
its installation three years before, had during this fortnight when it 
was not working, wished for its restoration. This reminded me of 
the experience which I had in the Dresden Museum twenty -five years 

ago, when the hot w^ater heat- 



ing plant was installed there. 
The emploj-ees complained 
that they were accustomed 
to heating by stoves and 
charged their indisposition 
and illness to the new system 
of heating. It was only the 
novelty of the method and 
their own prejudice that set 
them against it, as in Chicago, 
wdiere, however, after experi- 
ence it became evident that 
the new arrangement was the 
l)etter. It will, therefore, 
be retained by the telephone 
company. In figs. 61-641 give 
the plan adopted for the installation of the apparatus, w^hich was given 
me by the chief engineer of the company, who explained the matter 
to me with the courtesv which is evervwhere shown in the United

States. In the public library it has meanwhile been recognized that 
the reason for the ineffective working of the apparatus lay, among other 
things, in the insufficient speed of the fans, and it is decided to replace 
the motors by more powerful ones, as well as to set up two new spray 
chambers. Perhaps, too, the air could not be sufficiently cooled by the 
existing machines, since by proper apparatus for passing it over ice it 
may be kept at a temperature of 18'- F. lower than the external air. 
As I have already mentioned, in speaking of the New berry Library, the 
system works excellently in the Library of Congress at Washington. 
Further experiments in the Chicago Pu})lic Library will, however, be 
important, for if the system should ultimately be perfected it may be 
introduced into museums in smoky cities, such as Dresden, where it 
would bring about an extraordinary improvement, for there is now no

end to the cleaning and renovating. Some of the collections are even 
closed twice a year for a fortnight for thorough cleaning. 

The books themselves are installed in a most complete manner. 
They are placed directly behind the delivery room (see Plate 30, where 
behind the arches two rows of book stacks may be seen), in whose 
immediate neighborhood are placed 75 per cent of the books in 
most demand, so that mechanical devices for service at the stacks, 
such as I expect to describe in the Washington and Boston libraries, 
can be dispensed with. The stacks are of iron and are made b}'^ 
the Art Metal Construction Company (former Fenton Metallic Manu- 
facturing Company) in Jamestown, New York, referred to above, 
which firm also made the excellent repositories for the library of 
Columbia University in New York (see p. 371). The stacks stand with 
interspaces of 40 inches, and are arranged in from 3 to 6 decks, each 
7 feet to 7 feet 6 inches in height. Thov are 1 foot 3^^ inches wide and

into five sections, each 2 feet 9 inches long. The passageway is 4 feet 
3 inches wide, and the side passages about 40 inches wide. The 
stacks in the public liljrary are of a light blue color, covered with a 
lacquer which feels like velvet, so that the books can not be injured; 
all anoles in addition are rounded. The shelves, of iron, are easily

ble above, prevent the books from falling down on shelves not entirely 
full (tio-. 65). The space between the shelves is usually about 9 inches. 
The stacks arc entirely open, so that air can circulate freely, which is 
considered important for the ventilation of the books. Whether expe- 
rience has shown that books on open shelves are preserved better than 
those in closed cases is unknown to me. Around the bottom of the 
stacks (see tig. 66) and along the walls run ventilating slits. Pig. bb

the books lie upon rollers and slide from right to left, so that any 
iiijui'v to the hindino- is avoided. This is a very excellent although 
costly ap[)aratus, especially used in case of valua))le works upon art, 
in which the library is not poor, and which aie nuich used. The wires 
for electric lights run inside of the hook stacks in protected conduits 
which above are ))i'<)ught out into the aisles and bear the incandescent 
lamps (see figs. 66 to 68). 




Fig. 67. — Chicago Public Library. Closable alcove. 

Elevators driven by electric power carr}^ the books between the 
repositories, up and down, and into the reading rooms of the third 
story. On the southwest side of the ground floor are the rooms from 
which books are sent out to the 65 delivery stations of the city. The 
book stacks are connected with these rooms by pneumatic tubes of 3 
inches diameter, speaking tubes, and telephone, as well as by two 
service elevators. 

The telephone system of the liV)rary is very extensive; 24 rooms can 
be connected with each other, and the head bureaus also, with the city 
system, through a connnon switch board placed in the central station 
of the building, which must in every case be called up. There are

also 29 electrically regulated clocks distributed throughout the library. 
The electric lighting and all other electric appliances require about 25 
miles of wire. 

In the year 11)0(1-1901 (the tiscal year extends from June 1 to May 
31) there were on hand 272,276 ])ound volumes and 49,805 unbound 
pamphlets, as well as over 6,000 duplicates. The following catalogues 
were kept up with the greatest care: (1) An accession catalogue with 
running numbers; (2) a shelf catalogue according to a special system 
founded on Cutter's classification, with letters indicating subjects and 
with running numbers according to which the books are arranged 
(the tags are pasted upon the backs); (8) an alphabeticjil card cata- 
logue of authors, titles, and subjects combined (dictionary catalogue), 
there being two copies of this, one for the use of the employees

and one for the })ublic, in the room adjoining the book room of the 
third story. Each catalogue is kept in a wooden case with 500 draw- 
ers" that hold nearl}^ 500,000 cards; 200,000 in each are alread}^ in use. 
The cards for use by the public are perforated and strung on a metal 
rod so secured (in the well-known manner) that the user can not remove 
them. The catalogue for use by employees is not so confined. All 
the cards in use in American libraries are of a uniform size of 3 by 5 
inches. In the Chicago Pul)lic Library some of the cards are written 
with the pen, some with the typewriter, but many are bought ready 
printed. Printed catalogues, which for the small sum of 3 to 15 cents, 
can be bought in the library itself, and in all branch stations, are pre- 
pared for the use of the public* 

"Such card catalogue cases are also made in America, out of iron, especially by 
the Art Metal Construction Company, of Jamestown, from which the Dresden Zoo- 
logical Museum obtained a small one. 

6 In his full report Doctor Meyer gives details of the catalogues and statistics of 
the contents of the library, which arc omitted from the present translation. 



490 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSETTM, 1903. 

The public library contains books for home reading, reference works, 
periodicals, public documents, and books on the fine and decorative 
arts, the total in 1900 aggregating 258,498 books. 

The present book stacks suffice for 300,000 volumes, but about 
111,000 is now being spent in constructing additional ones that will 
accommodate 90,000 more, and there is room enough for stacks to 
accommodate 300,000 besides, but if the structure referred to above is 
built over the west court and the rooms now used by the Grand Army 
of the Republic become free to the library, the building may contain 
2,000,000 volumes. There is, therefore, space available for a long 
period of future growth. 

In the great periodical reading room of the third floor 1,030 current 
periodicals and newspapers are displayed. 

The reference room adjoining is as unrestrictedly accessible as is 
the large hall. It contains, in its wall repositories, dictionaries, ency- 
clopedias, bibliog-raphies, handbooks, etc. (2,000 volumes in all), that 
the public can use directly without application at the desk. It is not 
possible to state how many volumes are here consulted, but it is cer- 
tainly many hundreds of thousands. In 1900-1901, 121,709 persons 
visited the reading room and used 336,103 volumes which, at thtMr 
request, were given to them from the library. 

In 1900-1901, 1,772,741 books were lent to 79,605 persons, averaging 
5,813 on week days, 284 on Sundays and liolidays, the maximum 
being 10,005 on February 23, the minimum 4,424 on September 12. 
Sixty -six per cent of these lent books, 1,164,320, came from 65 branch 
stations in the city. 

More than 4,000,000 volumes, including pamphlets, parts of period- 
icals, and newspapers, are annually iised in the Chicago Public Library. 
In 1900-1901,1,800,000 were lent out and 600,000 (estimated) were 
used in the library and its six branch reading rooms. The number of 
books, periodicals, and newspapers consulted or taken from the open 
shelves, and of which no record was taken, must be estimated at not 
less than 1,600,000, based on the number of daily visitors given above. 

All of this will give an idea of the all-embracing activity of the 
public library. That so great an organization, which does so much 
good, can not be cheaply maintained is obvious. In 1899-1900 the cost 
of the maintenance, defrayed by the city, was $263,397. There was 
paid out for salaries in 1900-1901 the sum of about $136,000; in 1899- 
1900 the branch stations cost $23,717 and the fuel $8,068. 

The library has 208 employees, 59 of whom are women, and include 
1 librarian, 1 secretary (also treasurer), 3 assistant librarians 8 heads 
of departments (circulating, delivery stations, reference, binding, read- 
ing room, registry, ordering, patent department), and 110 assistants. 

At the head of this powerful and admirable institution is a board of 
9 directors. The mayor of Chicago annually names three of these 



Report of U. S^ National IVlus<;um, 1903.— Meyer 



Plate 32. 




STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 491 

directors, who serve for three years, the appointments being confirmed 
by the city council. The board of directors reorganizes itself yearly, 
chooses its president and vice-president and appoints six committees: 
On the library, administration, delivery stations, buildings and 
grounds, finance, and by-laws; the secretary of the library acts as 
secretary to the board. Unstinted praise is due these men, who, with 
the active stafl' of the public librar} ,, devote their energies to so great 
a task and solve it in so successful a manner. I am sorry that I am no 
longer 3^oung enough to assist in establishing a similar institution in 
Germany. In the public library of Chicago one learns how much we 
have to do in this field. Our schools may be better than those of 
America; of that, however, I am not in a position to judge; but the 
means which we furnish adults, by which the}^ can, without expense 
and without difficult conditions, further educate themselves, are 
entirely insufiicient. We need an intellectual counterpoise for the 
purpose of freeing men from pot-house living and women from back- 
stairs literature, and for this a free public library of the best type is a 
powerful lever. 

In my account of the Chicago Public Library I have only been able 
to touch upon the principal matters, being obliged to omit many 
interesting and instructive details. 

. 16. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. 

[Founded by John D. Rockefeller.] 

The University of Chicago was opened in 1892. It possesses a rec- 
tangular piece of ground about 35 acres in extent, 2,075 feet long, 875 
feet wide, covering six city blocks " in the southern part of Chicago, 
between Jackson and Washington parks, distant two-thirds of a mile 
from the former and one-fourth of a mile from the latter, on the Mid- 
way Plaisance, a strip of park that unites the two. The original plans 
contemplated the establishment of a great museum, but as the Field 
Columbian Museum arose in the near vicinit}^ that idea was abandoned 
and, instead of forming a great collection for public exhibition, it con- 
fines itself more to scientific collections for teaching purposes. Those 
at present provided, independent of the collections of the separate 
institutions, are displayed in two museums, the Walker Museum and 
the Haskell Oriental ^luseum. Both were designed, as were all the 
buildings of the university,'' by Henry Ives Cobb, the architect of the

& I could not give all the study to these that they deserved, and have, in the fol- 
lowing remarks, consulted the annual registers of the university and the annual 
reports of the president, as well as an article by Prof. F. Starr, in AppIcUm's Popu- 
lar Science Monthly, October, 1897, pp. 784-805; also taking from the latter some 
illustrations. During my visit to the university, as I was endeavoring to obtain 
some information at the oftice, a student heard me, constituted himself as my guide 
and accompanied me everywhere during the whole day. This shows the uncom-

building- for the Historical Society and of the New])eiTy Library (see 
p. 459), in the English Gothic stylo, the material being a tine-grained, 
gray sandstone, the treatment being very pleasing and agreeably 
diversified, and, in spite of the avoidance of superfluous decoration, 
not monotonous. 

WALKER MUSEUM. 

The Walker Museum, named after the donor, is a three-storied 
building that cost about $180,000 and was opened in 1893. It lies 
with its broad sides toward the north and the south, which is unfavor- 
al)le to the entire south side, for, as an excess of light thus comes from 
that quarter, the lighting of the cases would be improved if some of 
the windows were closed. It is seldom that a museum is too well

lighted. It occurs here because of the narrowness of the window 
piers and from the circumstance that the principal hall, on the ground 
floor, forms an undivided room, and therefore the light falls into the 
relatively small hall from all four sides, thereby causing annoying 
reflections. The building is fireproof throughout, and is heated by 
steam from the university plant. The ventilation is insufficient. The 
cases are of wood, with broad frame work and doors that slide up and 
down; they are primitive, and not dust proof. A practical arrange- 
ment is used for the consultation of maps which are kept in large 

monly helpful disposition which characterizes the Americans, and which I have 
already pointed out at a former occasion. This obliging gentleman was a geologist, 
a bachelor of science, H. V. Hibbard by name, and I remember with pleasure and 
gratitude his attentions to me, by which I was saved much time.

drawers that run in grooves screwed upon the inner side of the doors 
of the cases. These doors open only far enough to make right angles 
with the case, so that when drawn out the drawer serves as a ta))Ie. 

The museum contains between 400,000 and 500,000 specimens, and 
is open all day on week days. The collections embrace anthropolog3^ 
geolog}', geography, mineralogy, petrography', and historical ])aleon- 
tology (illustration of the succession of the faunas and floras in the 
history of the earth), with many models, casts, maps, photographs, 
etc. Upon the ground floor are exhibits relating to the above-named 
sciences, as well as to Mexican anticjuities. Upon the second floor are 
the collections for study (for the most part in drawers), besides work-

rooms, a lil)rary, and lecture rooms. On the third floor are the col- 
lections for study in anthropology, with instruments for measuring, 
maps and graphic representations relating to the a})origines. with 
collections from ^Mexico and Peru, from the pueblos of New ^Mexico, 
the clitf-dwellers of Colorado, the Moki Indians of Arizona, the 
Aleutes, and the northwestern coast of America. Japan, etc. 

The nniseum is managed b}'^ the professors of the University, with 
a few assistants. 

II.\SKELL OKIEXTAL MUHF:UM. 

The Haskell Oriental Museum is dedicated by the donor to the 
memory of her husband. It is a three-story building, costing $100,000, 
and was opened in 1896. At the present time the second floor oidy is 
devoted to the museum collections', which include a biblical exhibit; 



494 



EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1908. 



one of comparative religion; an A.ssyrian exhibit, consisting mostlj^of 
casts, and an Egyptian collection. The objects relating to the Japanese 
Shinto religion should be especially mentioned, !is they are very seldom 
seen in other museums. The greatest space is devoted to the Egyptian 
collection, to which new material is constantly being added by the 
Chicago Society of Egyptian Research, founded in 1897. The lighting 
of the rooms is excellent, being more satisfactory than in the Walker 
Museum, as the building lies with its broad sides to the east and west. 
The remaining stories contain, temporarily, lecture rooms, seminary 
rooms, library, and the like, but they will later be used for collections. 
The founder established two lectureships at $20,000 for lectures on 
the relations of Christianity to other religions, one series of which is

delivered annually at the university, the other delivered in alternate 
years in cities of India. In 1899 the subject for the first was Chris- 
tianity and Buddhism in six lectures between August 6 and 22. 
Because of the recent establishment of all the institutions of the 
imiversity it follows that they satisfy the most modern requirements 
and are models of their kind. The buildings are fireproof through- 
out, but with wooden furniture and stair coverings, as well as wooden 
door and window casings, which might as well have been avoided, at 
least in those buildings where there is danger from fire because of the 
kind of work carried on therein. I must confine m3\self to brief 
notices of these several buildings, accompanied b}^ illustrations, for if 
I were to treat them as fully as they deserve I should far exceed the 
limits set for this report.

KENT CHEMICAL LABORATORY. 



The Kent Chemical Laboratory was named for the donor of the 
building". It cost about $240,000, and was opened in 1894. It has three 
stories. On the o-round floor are four lecture rooms, the largest hold- 
ing 300 persons, a museum, and some workrooms; in the second story 
there are laboratories for advanced students, and a library. In the 
third are laboratories for beginners. I mention, in all cases, only the 
principal rooms. Six private laboratories are provided for the pro- 
fessors and teachers. For ventilation several fans drive in air of a 
constant temperature below, and one fan expels above. 



RYERSON PHYSICAL LABORATORY. 



The R3"erson Physical Laboratory was named by the donor of the 
building in memory of his father. It cost $225,000 and was opened in 




Fig. 72. — University of Chicago. Ryersoii rhy.sical Laboratory. 

1894. It has four stories, and is of especially heav}^ and solid construc- 
tion, in order to diminish tremors. The walls are wainscoted with 
marble, and the wall shelves of heavy slate on piers of masonry. In 
the walls and floors arc a system of ducts and channels, so that pipes 
and wires may be laid from one part of the building to another with- 
out difliculty. The heating is automatically regulated according to 
the direct-indirect system. Injurious eflfects are produced by the 
engines, three dynamos, and workshops in the basement. On the 
ground floor are la})oratories for advanced students, mechanical work- 
shops, etc. In the west wing are rooms free from iron devoted to

researches in electricit}' and magnetism. On the second floor there is 
a large general optical and chemical laborator}^, a large lecture hall, 
and other rooms. On the third floor is a laboratory for beginners, a 
lecture hall, and other rooms. Here also is provisionally established 
the mathematical and astronomical department of the university. 
The central part of the fourth floor forms a hall for experiments 
re([uiring a large space. The roof above this is flat and suitable for 
observation in the open air. 



HULL BIOLOGRAL LAB( )KATOKlE.S. 



The Hull laboratories (tig. 73) are four buildings, erected according 
to a common plan, connected partly by covered cloisters, and forming

three sides of a large court. They were given by Miss Helen Culver and 
named in memory of her uncle. They were opened in 1897. In the 
letter of presentation it was said that the whole sum of 11,000,000 
should be devoted " to the increase and spread of knowledge within 
the field of the biological sciences," and that a portion of it should be 
applied for sustaining an inland experimental station and a marine 
laboratory and to the regular delivery of popular lectures upon the 
advances of science in sanitation and hygiene. It was also provided 
that only one-half of the sum should be used for the erection of 
buildings, but that the interest on the other half should be applied to 
the support of research, instruction, and publication. In accordance 
with this plan a zoological, a physiological, an anatomical, and a

hotaiiiciil institute luivo been built, eac-h specially adapted to its own 
ends, and it should be particularly mentioned that the architect has 
not allowed himself to sacrifice either space or light to the require- 
ments of the Gothic style. The open side of the court is turned 
toward the center of the Universit}' grounds. 

The Hull Zoological Laboratory, shown in tig. 74 on the left, has 
four stories, 130 feet long and 55 feet deep. In the basement there 
is an aquarium, vivaria, preparators' workrooms, and the like, as 
well as a room for paleontological material, as paleontology in the 
Chicago University, is distributed in a rational and progressive way 
among the biological sciences. On the first floor is a musinuii, a general 
))iological library, and the laboratory for beginners. On the second 
floor are only zoological laboratories. Upon the third floor there is a 
laborator}" for comparative anatoni}^ and embryology and one for 
cellular biolog}', as well as single zoological workrooms. Upon the 
fourth floor are laboratories for bacteriology,'' as well as rooms for 
paleontology. 

In summer, work is also carried on at the marine biological station 
at Woods Hole, Massachusetts (Marine Biological Laboratory), which 
is allow^ed the pupil in reckoning his prescribed hours of work, 
although the station is not ranked as belonging to the Chicago Univer- 
sity. The director of the zoological laboratory of the university is 
also director of the Woods Hole station, which is an hour and a half 

« During my visit there were undertaken here exitensive researches, begun in the 
early part of 1899, upon the water of the Mississippi, and the IIHnois and its tributaries, 
as it was desired to discharge the sewage from Chicago by that route. Up to that 
time it had been discharged partly through the Chicago River into Lake Michigan, 
which not only changed that river into a reeking sewer but also polluted the pota- 
l)le water supply of the city. In spite of the fact that the lake water was pumped 
from the lake, 4 miles away, through subterranean channels, Chicago remained 
unhealthy, Avith frequent cases of typhoid fevers and other diseases. Now, through 
a canal 30 miles long, reaching as far as Lockport, a union has been effected with 
the Desplaines River, and through that with the Illinois and the Mississippi, and the 
city thus freed from noxious materials without, it is alleged, injuring the dwellers 
upon the other rivers, as the sewage is extraordinarily diluted by bringing the 
water of the lake into the canal (11,000 cubic yards a minute, which could be raised 
to 22,000 cubic yards). The question has even arisen whether, through this enor- 
mous withdrawal of water, the level of the Great Lakes will not become permanently 
lowered, so that the aiiipping interests, which are very active, may be injured 
thereby. The canal, which was finished in seven years and opened in 1900, also 
serves for ship transport. It is 175 to 317 feet broad, from 16 to 22 feet deep. It 
cost the city about $35,000,000, but this was not too high a price to pay for the 
I)enefit which it wrought. The Hull Bacteriological Laboratory has been especially 
adapted for this task, and has, among other things, already undertaken a great 
tmmber of chemical and bacteriological researches in order to prove whether any 
appreciable effect will be produced by the introduction of the diluted sewage into 
the canal and the great river system involved.

by rail from Bo.ston, therefore more than a twenty-four hours' journey 
from Chicajj'o. It is supported by several universities of the United 
States and publishes, among- other things, biological lectures of a more 
or less popular character, which are given there. The U. S. Fish 
Commission of Washington also has a station at Woods Hole. 

The Hull Botanical Laboratory^ shown at the right in tig. 74, has four 
stories, and is 112 feet long and 56 feet wide. The rooms of this 
building are also especial!}^ well lighted. The greenhouse is 75 feet 
long, 33 feet wide, and easily reached by an elevator. It affords space 
for growing plants under different conditions (tropical, arctic, desert, 
aquatic) in order to experimentally determine their influence over the 
organism. The temperature and moisture can be exactl}^ controlled. 
Underneath, in the fourth story, are rooms chiefly for the study of 
plant physiology, a chemical laboratory, a woi'kshop, and others. In

the third story are studied the taxonomy and morphology of crypto- 
gams. In the second story are the great herbarium, an excellent 
library, laboratories, etc., and on the ground floor the lecture rooms 
and the large general laboratories for beginners. Parts of the base- 
ment and of the ground floor are temporarily occupied by the printing 
establishment of the university. 

The Hull Physiological Lahoratory, seen in fig. 75, has four stories, 
is 112 feet long and 55 feet wide, and is connected with a green- 
house for the rearing of insects and plants. In the basement are a 
cold-storage room, a marine aquarium, a vivarium with excellent 
appointments, a workshop, etc. On the first floor is the laboratory 
for beginners, a lecture room, a photographic room, and galvanometer 
room. In the second story is the large lecture hall, with a practical 
arrangement for lantern projections, the library, an optical room, two

the eti'ects of monochroniatic light upon living organisms, etc. In the 
third and fourth stories are laboratories for ph3^siological chemistr}', 
vivisection rooms, etc. In the institute special attention is given to 
the study of comparative physiology, and the completeness and excel- 
lence of its appointments for this purpose can not easily be surpassed. 
The Ilxdl Anatomical Lahoratory has four stories, and is 131 feet 
long and 55 feet wide. The studies here embrace human anatomy, 
histolog}, histog-enesis, microscopic anatom}^, embryologj', and espe- 
cially neurology and experimental psychology. In the ])asement is 
a cold-storage room, a cremator}', a bone room, etc. The first story

Germans), and many others, and to histology. There is also a photo- 
graphic workroom, etc. In the second story are other rooms for

YERKES ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY. 

The Yerkes Observ-atory is situated about 75 miles from Chicago on 
Geneva Lake, Wisconsin, and about 1\ miles from Williams Ba}', a 
little town on the lake. It was founded in 1894 by Charles T. Yerkes,

ut a cost of $800,000 and was opened in 1897. In spite of its youth 
it has ah"eady obtained a world-wide reputation under the direction of 
Prof. G. E. Hale. As I have not visited it I can only give a notice 
compiled from various sources. As early as 1892 Charles T. Yerkes 
conferred with Messrs. Harper and Hale concerning- its foundation, 
and the latter in 1893 had the plans drawn up. The site was selected 
with care so as to be as free as possible from disturbances. It is 220 
feet above the lake and 1,300 feet above sea level. About 50 acres of 
woodland are included in the site. The building, likewise designed by 
Henry Ives Cobb, is T-shaped, its principal axis (361 feet) lying east

objective of 33 inches, is at the western end and is 98 feet in diameter. 
This great telescope" is moved by an electrical apparatus, and the floor 
of the observing room, 82 feet in diameter, can be elevated and is 
movable through a range of 26 feet by means of electrical motors 
(tig. 77). A spectrograph, a photoheliograph, as well as a stellar and 
a solar spectrograph are attached to it. In the eastern wing, which 
runs north and south, is the heliostat room, 108 feet long and 13 feet 



« It was exhibited in Chicago in 1893, and was until up to within a short time the 
largest in existence. One was made for the Paris exposition of 1900 having an 
objective 1.25 meters in diameter, and recently an American has offered one to the 
Pope that is still larger.

room, laboratories, photographic rooms, offices, etc. In the basement 
also are similar rooms, as well as an excellently^ eciuipped workshop. 
The power house is isolated from the observatory.

Besides this the university has within its own grounds at Chicago 
a small astronomical observatory for the instruction of beginners, and 
about a mile and a half north of it in the city a second one, the Kenwood 
Observatory, for the instruction of advanced students in physical and 
practical astronomy and astrophysics, for which it is completely 



equipped. 



502 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 



Since 1893 the library has been temporarily installed in a nonfire- 
])roof building," situated in the northeast corner of the universitj'^ 
grounds. This is entirely insufficient and extraordinarily crowded, so 
that the building of a second temporary building was contemplated 
when J. D. Rockefeller, on Christmas eve, 1900, made a preliminary 
donation of $100,000 for a new structure. The university had already, 
ill 1891. bought for about $17,000 the Calvary secondhand bookstore 
in Berlin, which was estimated to contain 280.000 volumes and 120,000 
pamphlets, but was indeed much less and not as valuable as was 
expected; and it had also obtained in 1891 the entire library of the 
Baptist Union Theological Seminary, of Chicago, in 40,000 volumes. 
In 1899 the entire number of books possessed by the university 
amounted to 325,000 volumes'' and 1.50,000 pamphlets (estimated), 
71,235 volumes of which were in the 25 departmental libraries of the 
various institutes and seminaries, where, however, they are adminis- 
tered from the central library by a superintendent, an inspector, and 
four assistants. These reference libraries are completely catalogued 
according to authors and partially according to subjects. They con- 
tained in gross, in 1900, the following numbers of volumes: Theolog}", 
9,350; biology, 7,(585; political economy, 6,181; English, 5,432; his- 
tory. 5,433; German, 4,920; Latin, 4,415; geology, 4,260; sociology, 
3,703; philosophy, 2,914; romance languages, 2,905; political science, 
2,651; and mathematics, 2,503. 

COBB LECTURE HALL. 

The Cobb Lecture Hall (tig. 78) was founded in 1892 by S. B. Cobb, 
at a cost of $225,000. A structure for a lecture hall was alread}' in 
process of erection, so that on October 1 of that year the official open- 
ing of the universit}' was celebrated in it, and it has remained its 
central point. It is 170 feet long, 82 feet wide, and 55 feet high, up to 
the roof. There are 23 lecture halls that hold a total of 800 persons — the 
largest, 7S by 45 feet, holding 40() persons; the second in size, 45 by 33 
feet — besides the offices of the university. It is aboutto be united with 
the central heating plant. 

GYMNASIUM. 

The gymnasium is a temporary structure that in 1892 was built on 
the north, near the l)uilt-up portion of the university grounds, at an 
expense of about $18,000. The portion for men is 220 feet long and 
55 feet wide, the hall 154 feet long by 55 feet wide; 420 lockers serve 
for depositing clothing. There is a miming track 440 feet long, laid 
with linoleum. The portion for Avomen is 100 feet long and 55 feet

ph3'sical culture and athletics is a widely embracing one, correspond- 
ing- to the g-reat part which athletic games play in American univer- 
sities, too great, as appears to me," in comparison with the too slight 
part given to it in Germany. In spite of the consideral)le receipts of 
the division, amounting to about $35,000, of which about $30,000 
alone were derived from admission fees to the football games, paid 
by the public, there was in 1898-99 a deficit of $250. 

POWER nousK. 

A central power house for heating and for electrical supply was 
erected as long ago as 1892 alongside the universit}^ grounds, separated 
from them by a street. It is 131 by 138 feet in size. The engines are 
fed by coal oil jjrovided by J. D. Rockefeller, the founder and 
chief supporter of the university. The present house is, however, no 
longer sufficient, and there has been begun the construction of a new 
larger centi-al power house for electricity, heating, and water, from 
which subterranean conduits will l)e led to all the buildings of the uni- 
versity. It will be 300 feet long and 50 feet wide at the ground level, 
with a chimney stack 115 feet high, and will include a workshop for 
repairs. It will contain, among other things, an electric crane, for 
handling of coal and the like, that can be moved along the entire 
building.^ 

DORMITORIES. 

The outer fronts of the four corners of the four southern blocks of 
the university groimds, taken as a whole, are devoted to dormitories. 
Here they stand, isolated, with great lawns that serve as plaj^grounds, 
the quadrangles in front planted with trees and decorated with beds of 
flowers. Only one portion is now built. There are four such quad- 
rangles — one for women and one for graduate students, and two for 
the undergraduates. The row of houses in fig. 79 represents some of 
the dormitories for male students. On the right hand (near the Cobb 
Lecture Hall, fig. 78) is the north hall, especially for graduate stu- 
dents, and therefore formerl}" called the graduate dormitory . This 
row of houses corresponds to those seen at the left in Plate 32. Up to 
the present time there have been established four dormitories for men 
and four for women, the former being able to accommodate 230, the 
latter 220 students, a total of 1-56. The number of students in the 
university in the 3'ear 1899-1900 was 1,734 men and 1,149 women, a

total of 3,188, and in 1900-1901 there were 3,612, but it should be 
remembered that the maximum number of residtmt students at any one 
time during- the latter year was only 2,0(><>.

The university builds and manages the dormitories and rents the 
rooms to the students. Within the dormitories there is, however, an 
official superintending- organization called the university houses and 
bearing the name of the dormitory, as Snell house, Green house, 
South divinity house. North house, etc. The term ' ' house " is generally

used for dormitory instead of hall. All the inmates of a dormitory 
make up such a house, which has a head appointed by the president 
of the universit}^ a woman in the case of the women's houses.^'

life of the students which are omitted from the present translation. 



5()<) REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 15H)3, 

The yearly expenses of iriainteiiance at the University of Chicago 
are officially stated at $287 for a minimum and $655 as a liberal allow- 
ance, $396 as an average for thiity-six weeks' work. The honorarium 
for tuition is always the same, $120, the price for rent and care of room 
varies from $42 to $225, the board from $100 to $225, laundry from 
$15 to $85, text-books and stationery from $10 to $50. Still one may 
live more cheaply, for a room near the university may be had for $1 a 
week, including heating and lighting, or with board for $4.50, and 
board alone in student clubs for $2.75 to $8.50 a week. 

I may also mention that the house of the president of the university 
stands near the south westei-n corner of the grounds, therefore near the 
dormitory for women (extreme right of Plate 33). The president holds 
regular receptions, whereby the social life of the university is kept up. 

As appears from the plan of the buildings of the university grounds 
and their vicinity, which is attached to the annual register, it was the 
intention to line the four ])locks originally assigned to the university 
somewhat symmetrically with buildings. 

In the middle transverse zone is the universit}^ hall and library, '^ 
together with the chapel; at the four corners are the dormitories, with 
large rectangular lawns in front of them; in the middle longitudinal 
zone are variously shaped large, ornamental plots; and the remaining 
portions are more or less symmetrically tilled with buildings of which 
there were 52 planned in all. Besides some provisional structures and 
the o])servatory at Lake Geneva, 17 of these have ))een completed, 
namel}', 2 museums, 6 natural history institutes, 1 lecture hall, 8 dor- 
mitories; 21 are contemplated or in course of construction, 3 for 
modern, 2 for ancient languages, 1 for geology, 1 additional museum, 
2 additional lecture halls, 7 more dormitories {one in course of con- 
struction), a hall with a library, a dining hall (building), the chapel, the 
gymnasium (building), the power house (building), and finally 11 whose 
special purposes have not yet been determined. In this original 
scheme of buildings, however, there are not included the two northern 
blocks, which, in 1899, Mr. Marshall Field, together with Mr. J. D. 
Rockefeller, presented to the university at a cost of $830,000. But 
after the Rush Medical College,^ that is to say, the medical school, 
with nearly 1,000 students, which up to this time, situated in West 
Chicago, has been oidy externally associated, has begun to settle down 
with the university,'" and, further, after the Pedagogical Institute of 
Chicago, funded with $2,000,000, has been transferred to the univer- 
sity,*^ a rapid advance will probably be made in the erection of addi- 

« This plan has since been abandoned.

HISTORY Ol'^ THE UNIVERSITY. 

If we take into account tiie l»uildings and installations pstal>lished, 
created from nothing, since ISDO, when the university was planned, 
up to 1899, we can only regard with astonishment the "phenomenally 
rapid growth"' of Chicago University, as it is generall}" spoken of; yet 
those far-seeing men at its head have still greater aims in view which 
the\' will also attain. 

The University of Chicago is all-embracing in the sense that it seeks 
to compass for both sexes the entire, broad domain of knowledge from 
the elementary school up to induction into independent research. But 
before I attempt to sketch its complicated organization, which differs 
in many points from that of other American universities, it may be 
proper to review its brief and eventful history, especially with i-egard 
to certain outside matters/' 

A '• l^niversity of Chicago" was fountlod as long ago as 1857, l)ut it 
was obliged in 1886 to close its doors on account of financial difficul- 
ties. It sprang from the bosom of the Baptist Church, which also 
again took steps for the founding of a new university. In 1888 J. D. 
Rockefeller, of New York, conferred with Dr. W. R. Harper, profes- 
sor of Semitic languages at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, 
in regard to the reestablishment of the imiversit}" in Chicago, as this 
appeared to him the dut}^ of the Baptist denomination of the countr}', 
and also entered into communication with the American Baptist Educa- 

«How true this remark is may be illustrated by the fact that while I was revising 
my manuscript (in July, 1901), 1 received news from President Harper that corner 
stones for the following l)uildings had recently been laid: The press building, a 
dormitory for undergraduates (Hitchcock Hall); the universit)' dining hall, with its 
kitchen; the University tower; the clubhouse for university students, an assembly 
hall (Mandel assembly hall) and the school of education. I also learn from news- 
paper notices, that L. Mandel, of Chicago, gave $100,000 for the assembly hall; J. J. 
Mitchell, of Chicago, $50,000 for the tower; the executors of J. Reynolds, in Chicago, 
$80,000 for the clubhouse, and a great business man, who wishes to remain anonymous, 
$100,000 for the dining hall. The school of ethication will cost $1,000,000. 

'^In 1897 H. Moissan wrote a brief sketch of the University of Chicago, which was 
translated and i)u]jlished in the Report of the Commissioner of Education for the year 
1897-98 (Washington, 1899), II, pp. 1448-1447. He there relates, among other things, 
that a professor at a university, without any ceremony, presented him from the col- 
lection a piece of fossil wood that pleased him, and that was neither numbered nor 
catalogued. He instinctively looked around to see if they were observed. He adds: 
" It is only in America that one sees such things." With regard to this I might 
properly say that one will hardly find anywhere such careful cataloguing as in the 
American museums, and that if that professor gave him the specimen he was doubt- 
less authorized to do so. 



508 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

tion Society, which was founded in Washington in 1888. The result 
of the conferences which the society carried on was that in 1889 
Rockefeller contributed 1600,000 as an endowment fund, the income 
onh" of which could be used for current expenses, and under the con- 
dition that within a year $400,000 should be given by other parties for 
the purpose of purchasing land and erecting huildings thereon. This 
condition was fuUHhnl in 1890, and in addition Marshall Field, of 
Chicago, presented land for half of the site, the other half being 
bought for $182,r)()(i, altogether three blocks, to which, in 1S91, a 
fourth block was added, costing $160,000, and in 1898 a fifth and sixth 
block, costing $310,000, toward which Mr. Field again contributed 
$185,000 and Mr. Rockefeller the remainder. The cost of the land 
aggregates, therefore, up to the present time, over $750,000. 

On September 10, 1890, the University of Chicago was incorporated 
as such b}' the State of Illinois, its objects, as set forth, being to serve 
for the higher education of both sexes on equal terms, its man- 
agement being contided to a board of 21 trustees, two-thirds of whom, 
as well as the president of the university, must l)e members of regu- 
lar Baptist churches, the universit}'^ to have, however, a purely literary 
and scientific character, and no professorship or place of any kind to 
be dependent upon a religious test. A few days thereafter Mr. Rock- 
efeller again gave, to be invested, $1,000,000, four-tifths of the pro- 
ceeds to be used for the general purposes of instruction and one-fifth 
for the theological faculty, and Prof. W. R. Harper was appointed 
president. The latter accepted the ofiice on Jul}^ 1, 1891, and has ever 
since been the active force of the whole enterprise, as in fact he had 
been since 1888, constantly maintaining the view that it ought to be a 
real universit}^ and not a nominal one, as are so many in the United 
States. It was further arranged that the Theological Seminary of the 
Baptist Union in Morgan Park, Chicago, estaldished since 1860, be 
constituted the theological faculty of the university (divinity school) 
under this condition, among others, that a dormitor}^ costing $100,000 
should be erected for the accommodation, without charge, of the theo- 
logical students, in consideration of which the acadeni}- of the univer- 
sity should be established in the buildings at Morgan Park. With the 
seminary the universit}' also obtained a theological library of 40.000 
volumes, as previousl}^ mentioned. 

From January, 1891, to May, 1892, there were six bulletins pub- 
lished on the plan of organization of the university which had been 
previously submitted to the criticism of more than 50 American insti- 
tutions for higher education. In 1891 the heirs of the first mayor of 
Chicago, W. B. Ogden, endowed a faculty of natural sciences (Ogden 
Scientific School) for physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and asti'on- 
omy. This was under a provision of his will that prescribed that 70 
per cent of his property should be devoted to charitable purposes. 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 50U 

Up to 1898 1300,000 of this had been li(iuidatod and $200,000 more are 
expected. In the .same year occurred the purchase of several hundred 
thousand books and pamphlets comprising the librar}- of the C.'alvary 
Antiquariat at Berlin. In 1892 S. A. Kent, of Chicago, gave $235,000 
for a chemical laboratorj^, Mr. Rockefeller another endowment of 
$1,000,000, and Mr. Field $100,000 for buildings, under the condition 
that within three months an additional sum that should raise the total 
to $1,000,000 should ])e secured for the same object from other parties. 
This was done in Chicago itself; the sum was even exceeded, and man}' 
complained that they had not been asked to contribute. S. B, Cobb had 
given $150,000 especially for a lecture hall; G. C. Walker $130,000 for 
a fireproof museum; M. A. Rj^erson $150,000 for a phj^sical laboratorj^ 
(to which he added in 1894 $75,000 more) and $50,000 besides; Mrs. 
N. S. Foster gave $60,000; Mrs. E. Kelly and Mrs. J. Beecher each 
$50,000, and other ladies $18,000, all for dormitories for women; 
Mrs. A. J. Snell $50,000 for a dormitory for A'oung men students, 
and in addition to this there were 20 leading business men of the city 
who together guaranteed $100,000 in case the required sum was not 
forthcoming. 

In order to show the farsightedness that animated the men of the 
university, I will mention that in June, 1892, when there had already 
been a large staff of teachers appointed, though as yet there was not 
a single student, and when everyone had his hands full with organiza- 
tion and installations, $250 was granted for the American School of 
Classical Studies at Athens. 

On October 1, 1892, the university was opened to students with a 
ceremony exclusively of a religious character. Only the lecture hall 
and three dormitories were read}'; for everything else rooms had to 
be rented in the neighborhood. As a slight recognition of the indebt- 
edness which was felt toward Mr. Rockefeller it was voted that the 
words "Founded by John D. Rockefeller'' be added to all official 
reports, publications, and correspondence of the university. In the 
same year this founder gave still another sum of $1,000,000 as an 
endowment for the compensation of instructors. On elanuary 1, 1893, 
the university had a teaching corps of 172 persons, of whom there 
were 73 professors (4 German) and 61 fellows for 594 students, nearly 
one-fourth of them being women. In 1893-94 a fund amounting to 
$1,000,000 was formed for the general equipment of the university, of 
which Mr. Rockefeller contributed half, M. A. Ryerson, of Chicago, 
$100,000, the remainder coming from various sources. In 1894 Mrs. 
C. E. Haskell, of Chicago, established an oriental museum at a cost of 
$100,000, adding $40,000 for lectures on comparative religion, and 
Charles A. Yerkes, of Chicago, founded an observatory with $300,000. 
In 1895 the total number of students was already more than 2,000. 
From 1893 to 1896 Mr. Rockefeller had given for various purposes, 



510 KEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

})eside,s the bequests already mentioned, |400,0()0, and in 1895, for the 
fourth time, he made an endowment of $1,000,»)00, and promised 
$2,000,000 additional in case a like sum was contributed from other 
sources by 1900, and this was also done.'^ Further, Miss H, Culver, of 
Chicago, in 1895 gave $1,000,000 for biological sciences (see above, 
p. 496), and Mrs. A. Hitchcock, of Chicago, gave in 1900 $200,000 for 
a dormitor}^ for young students and the endowment of i:)rof essorships. 
The gifts in the year 1898-99 — the school year runs from July to 
July— reached a total of nearly 1750,000, $500,000 of which were 
from Mr. Rockefeller. Besides his $2,000,000 gift which was due 
April 1, 1900, he gave in the same year another $1,000,000 for capital 
stock and $500,000 for immediate use, with the desire that $100,000 
of it should be employed for a building for the library and press. In 
all, the university had obtained up to the end of 1900,^' $13,000,000 
from private subscriptions,'' but not a penny from the city, State, or 
General Government; of this amount Mr. Rockefeller alone has given 
$9,000,000, and all but $1,000,000 of the remainder he has in a man- 
ner incited, in that a condition was attached to his gifts that such 
and such sums must be raised from other sources.'^ In 1899, 

« Concerning this transaction the most fantastic statements were pubhshed in the 
German papers. Thus, a BerUn paper informed its readers that the university would 
have ])een bankrupt had not tliis sum been forthcoming; a Dresden one, on the con- 
trary, said that President Harper raised it in twelve hours, while he had been four 
and one-half years doing so, even this being a most astonishing performance. 

6 See New York Weekly Tribune, December 20, 1900. 

c At the decennial celebration held June 18, 1901, President Harper said, among 
other things, that w^hile one could see now what it was possible to do with $10,000,000 
to $12,000,000 for the establishment of an institution for higher education, yet before 
half of the new century had elapsed the world would know what $50,000,000 could 
do for that purpose. (Chicago Record- Herald, June 19, 1901, p. 2.) 

f' Besides, Mr. Rockefeller by no means confines his benefactions to the University 
of Chicago, and by his example has perhaps done more than by his gifts them- 
selves. Quite recently Andrew Carnegie, of Pittsburg, has surpassed him in gifts 
for educational jiurposes (see j). 474), crowning these during this year (1901) by 
giving to the four universities of his native land, Scotland, $10,000,000 in order to 
elevate them and to assist the students. In 1902 Carnegie gave the same sum 
for an Institution for Scientific Research in the City of Washington, 1903. John D. 
Rockefeller was born in 1839; his father was already living in the United States. 
Disparaging statements are made here and there as to the way in which he 
acquired his wealth (for example by F. de Norvins: Les Milliardaires Americains, 
Paris, 1900, p. 100 et seq.), but more shrewd than the robber knights of the middle 
ages, to whom many of our first families owe their wealth, he has certainly not kept 
up his practices, and it can therefore likewise be said for him: non olet. In America 
to-day a rich man may not keep his money or leave it chiefly to his relatives. Public 
opinion compels him to other methods of disposal. In Boston it is epigrammatically 
said that no one would dare to die without leaving something to Harvard University, 
and a minister in Brooklyn humorously remarked that he would not preach the 
funeral sermon of any rich man until he knew what his will was. It is unjust to 
inveigh against great fortunes when their possessors support our hospitals, libraries, 
and universities (see The Justification of Wealth in The Nation, LXX, 1900, p. 66).

$5,500,000 of the total fund of $13,000,000 were invested, yielding a 
secure annual income of $210,000, or 25) per cent, toward the ])ayraent 
of the total expenditures of $730,000, the students contributing 
$270,000 (37 per cent), while Rockefeller gave $200,000 (28 per cent), 
and the small remainder was derived from various sources. The 
expenditure for salaries of the insti'uctors was, in round sums, $390,000 
(54. 7 per cent), stipends "$00,000 (8. 5 per cent), for printing- and publish- 
ing $50,000 (♦).8 per cent), for expenses of buildings and grounds 
$83,000 (11.5 per cent), for books $14,000 (1.9 per cent), the remaining 
16.6 per cent for general expenses. 

According to a statement which occupied ahnost an entire closely printed folio page 
of the Chicago Tribune, January 1, 1901, p. 17, there was given liy private persons in 
the United States in 1899 $80,000,000 for educational purposes, libraries, museums, 
(•harital)le objects, churches and religious enterprises, as well as to cities for the pub- 
lic benefit and entertainment, sums under $1,000 not included. In 1900 the total 
was $62,500,000, of which there was applied to educational institutions, museums, and 
libraries $40,000,000, Washington University, in St. Louis, obtaining $5,000,000, the 
Carnegie Museum, in Pittsburg, $3,500,000; the University of Chicago, $2,600,000; 
Clark University, in Worcester, Mass., $2,400,000; Yale University, in New Haven, 
$1,300,000; Brown University, in Providence, $1,000,000; the Cooper Union, in 
New York City (see p. 366), and the University of Syracuse each $830,000; Har- 
vard University, in Cambridge, $730,000; Drake University, in Dea Moines, $530,000; 
Columbia University, in New York, $500,000, and so on. During the year 1901, besides 
he donations amounting to $1,300,000 already mentioned, there were known to 
me the following great gifts from Chicago alone: Dr. D. K. Pearsons, who from 
1890 to 1900 had already given $2,500,000, almost wholly for educational objects, in 
sums of from $15,000 to $300,000, disposed during his lifetime of the remainder of his 
property, amounting to $1,500,000, for the same objects, having especial regard to the 
small colleges of the W^est, retaining only for himself and his wife an annuity of 
$30,000; and J. O. Armour, together with his mother, gave to the Armour Institute 
(school of engineering) $1,250,000, after his father had founded the same with 
$4,000,000. According to the American Montldy Review of Reviews, August, 1901, 
p. 152, the endowments for American colleges and universities in June of this year 
were greater than ever before. Among others. Brown University, in Providence, 
obtained $2,000,000, and Harvard University, in Cambridge, $1,000,000 for its med- 
ical faculty. "The best of all uses of public benefactions is not for charity to the 
poor or even to the sick and defective, * * * not for lower education or religion, 
* * * but rather for affording the very best opportunities for the highest possible 
training of the very best minds in universities, because in training these the whole 
work of church, state, school, and charity * * * is raised to,a higher level, and in 
his service all other causes are at the same time best advanced." (The Nation, LX X, 
1900, p. 229.) This, too, has always been the German principle, and to that end the 
governments of single states and the representatives of the people have cherished the 
universities with the greatest care, so that in Germany the most and best universities 
are found. In America this is sought to be attained partly through state and partly 
through private universities, and there can be no doubt but that it will also be 
attained there. 

** These are the so-called scholarships and fellowships, the first for junior students, 
the last for those who have attained the doctorate. They vary from $125 to $440. 
In consideration of this the recipients have to perform a service at the University of 
from one and one-half to two hours dailv. 



512 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

In l899-liK)0 the university had 3,183 students, of which 1,449 were 
women, and in 1900-1901, 3,612 students with 240 teachers and 25 
administrative eniplovees (11 women, 4 with title of professor), who 
receive salaries varying from $400 to 17,000. Among the instructors 
were 12 Germans, and 53 had studied in Germany. In 1900-1901 
there were 1,200 lectures, mostly arranged in courses of three months' 
duration, corresponding to what, as we shall see, is known in Chicago 
University as the quarter system. 

FEMALE STUDENTS. 

The number of female students in Chicago University has increased 
from year to year. In 1892-93 it was 24 per cent; 1893-94, 33 per 
cent; 1894-95, 35 per cent; 1895-96, 36 per cent; 1896-97, 37 per 
cent; 1897-98, 38 per cent: 1898-99, 43 per cent; 1899-1900, 45.5 
per cent, in a total of 3,183 students, there being 1,449 females and 
1,734 males." The dean of the women says, in the introduction to a 
highly interesting annual report,'' that in the University of Chicago 
these relations are much more simple than in most other institutions 
for conmion instruction. From the beginning each and every one of 
the women has stood on the same terms as the men; never in the world 
was the work of women as scholars less hampered, and nowhere is it 
easier for women to obtain a university training. The woman student 
on entering the university is subject to the same rules as the man stu- 
dent, proceeds in exactl}' the same manner in respect to choice of 
studies and business relations and shortly finds herself in class room, 
laboratory, and library, working side by side with men, and with no 
question as to her right or privilege. 

QUAKTEK SYSTEM WITHOUT VACATIONS. 

Another essential characteristic feature of the University of Chicago 
is its quarter system almost without vacations, which has introduced 
an entirely new principle into university instruction, which thus con- 
tinues on unbroken. The quarter is the unit of reckoning, as is the 
semester in Germany. The academic year begins on July 1 and is 
divided into four quarters, which begin respectively on the 1st of 
July, October, January, and April, and last twelve weeks, there being 

« In the winter semester of 1900-1901 there were at the 21 German univ-ersities 
among 34,363 students and some 2,000 auditors (summer semester, 1901, 35,552 
matriculate students), 1,029 women, 12 of whom were matriculate and probably 
about one-third of whom were foreigners (it was only at Jena that no female students 
were allowed, but they are now admitted — 1903). In the United States in 1898-99 
there were 109,659 males and 37,505 females who enjoyed the higher education, of 
which 18,948 women were at universities and colleges for both sexes, 4,593 at higher 
women's colleges, and 10,866 at such of lower grade, 1,339 at technical schools, 1,759 
at professional schools. (Report of Commissioner of Education, 1898-99, II, 1900, 
p. 1582.)

STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 513 

a recess of one week at the end. Each quarter has two q([uh\ terms 
of six weeks. The courses are classified as majors and minors. A 
minor calls for four to five hours of class-room work (or its equiva- 
lent) each week for six weeks; a major requires the same for twelve 
weeks. Eight to ten hours work a week is called a double minor 
or double major. The prescribed amount of work for each student is 
three minors, or one major and one minor in each half quarter. One 
major and two minors will also be allowed if it is evident that a stu- 
dent is properly using his time. Naturally the courses in a particular 
science usually last over several terms, six weeks is only the unit, but 
they nuist })e so adjusted that anyone, without disadvantage to him- 
self or the subject, can begin at the beginning of a <iuarter. 

Each instructor teaches thirty-six weeks during the year, ten hours 
or its equivalent a week. He enjoj's a quarters vacation, and is 
free to choose it whenever it can be arranged, or he ma}" take two 
vacations of six weeks each at different times of the year. If he 
voluntaril}" teaches according to agreement more than the normal 
amount he can obtain for it either a pro rata in salary (two-thirds the 
usual amount) or an extra vacation (full pro rata). Here, also, the 
custom prevails of allowing a so-called sabbatical year to the professors 
(see p. 367) but under more favorable conditions than are allowed in 
the other universities. Whoever lectures throughout three years of 
forty- eight weeks or six j^ears of forty-two weeks receives, a 3'ear's 
leave of absence with full pay. 

RELIGIOUS FOUNDATION. 

A third characteristic of the University of Chicago which deserves 
to be mentioned, at least in a comparison that most nearly concerns 
me — namely, that with the German universities — is the religious foun- 
dation which underlies the entire institution. As we have alread}^ 
seen, the university owes its origin to the religious feeling of 
J. D. Rockefeller, who regarded it as a duty owed to the Baptist 
Church, of which he was a member, that something should be done for 
the elevation and instruc^tion of the people, and although he did not 
in the beginning have something grand in view, yet through the influ- 
ence of prominent men he was soon brought to consider it. 

Although the articles of incorporation require that the president 
of the university and 14 of the 21 trustees shall be Baptists, yet it 
was stipulated from the beginning that the university should bear a 
pureh' literary and scientific character, and that no position of an}' kind 
should be dependent upon a religious test. This has been strictly 
adhered to, and, besides, in 1S99 the university congregation, which is 
a governing body composed of over 200 members, meeting quarterly 
or oftener, made the following public announcements: 

1. That the principle of the complete freedom of teaching for all 

NAT MUS 1908 33

and every one has prevailed in the Chicago University since its begin- 
ning as a fundamental proposition, as is shown by the conduct of the 
president and of the trustees and in the actual practice of the presi- 
dent and the })r()fessors. 

2. That this principle shall never, neither now nor in the future, be 
put in (|uestion. 

3. That it is desirable, in order to be alwa3^s clear upon tliis subject, 
that the university, as such, should not take part in public affairs and 
that public expressions by the professors relative to public matters 
shall be regarded as personal. 

ORGANIZATION OF THE UNIVERSITY. 

It remains to sketch the organization of the university. This is not 
yet fully completed, for it has, as yet, only a theological faculty 
(divinit}^ school), with an annex of an English theological seminary, 
a Scandinavian theological seminary, a philosophical faculty (graduate 
school of arts and literature), and a faculty of natural sciences (Ogden 
Graduate School of Science). There will later be organized, as soon as 
means allow, a law faculty, a medical facult}^," a faculty of engineering, 
a technological facult}", a pedagogical faculty^ — one for the fine arts 
and one for music. 

The universit}^ includes live divisions: (1) The schools, colleges, and 
academies; (2) the university extension; (3) the university libraries, 
laboratories, and museums; (4) the university press; (5) the univer- 
sit}' affiliations. 

The first division includes the faculties which have just been men- 
tioned (schools), the colleges for art, literature, natural science, com- 
merce, and administration and university college. Each of these 
colleges is again divided, as is usual, into a junior and a senior college. 
Finall}^, there is the academy in Morgan Park, a secondary school. 

The second division, the university extension, directs the work of 
students who can not attend the daily exercises of the university.^ It 
conducts lectures at places more or less distant from the university 
(lecture study department), study by correspondence (even in foreign 
countries), examinations for outsiders, and the library; that is to say, 
the utilization of the library for students not at the university itself. 

« Recently the whole of Rush Medical College of Chicago has been transferred to 
the university, and part of the medical lectures will be held there. This, then, now 
constitutes the medical faculty. 1903. 

''This faculty is now constituted by the recent transfer to the university of the 
Chicago Pedagogical Institute. 1903. 

''The English call this extension of university instruction the People's University, 
for its benefits are open to all. It rightly is regarded as absurd if anyone considers 
that he has ended his education at any definite time, for it can only be ended by 
death. Alexander von Humboldt was not ashamed to attend lectures even when 
an old man. I must refrain from giving here a special description of the Chicago 
University Extension. 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 515 

The third division includes the j^eneral library and all the depart- 
mental libraries, the general and special niuseiuns, the laboratories, 
apparatus, and all other material used for instruction. 

The fourth division includes the publications of the university, the 
j)rinting office, the purchase and selling of books, ai)paratus, and other 
means of instruction, as well as the literar}- exchange. 

The fifth section includes the relations with institutions which, with- 
out l)elonging organically to the university, have aflSliated themselves 
more or less with it. 

The ofticers are the president, the chaplain, the recorder, the regis- 
trar, the deans, the directors, the professors, and the teachers. They 
are arranged, for the administration of the university, into the uni- 
versity congregation, the senate, the council, seven faculties, « and six 
university l)oards,* each of these bodies with a prescribed function 
which I will not particularize here. Over all are the 21 trustees, who 
choose from among themselves a president, a vice-president, a treas- 
urer, a comptroller, and a secretary'. 

The follov.'ing sciences were, in 1899-1900, taught in the University 
of Chicago, each constituting a department: Philosophy, pedagog}', 
political economy, political science, history, archeology, sociology, 
anthropology, comparative religion, Semitic languages and literature, 
biblical and Patristic Greek, Sanskrit and Indo-European comparative 
philology, the Greek language and literature, the Latin language 
and literature, the Romance languages and literatures, the Germanic 
languages and literatures, the English language and literature, includ- 
ing rhetoric, literature, mathematics, astronomy-, physics, chemistry, 
geology, zoology, anatomy, physiology, neurology, paleontology, 
botany, rhetoric. Old Testament literature and interpretation. New 
Testament literature and interpretation, biblical theology, systematic 
theology, church history, homiletics, church polity, and pastoral 
duties. At the same time there are 25 seminaries and scientific 
institutes.'' 

« These are nt^t taken in the sense of the faculties at the German universities. The 
seven faculties of the University of Chicago are: (1) the faculty of the Morgan Art 
Academy (elsewhere, instead, the faculty of the teachers' seminary is mentioned); 
(2) the faculty of university extension; (3) that of junior colleges; (4) that of senior 
colleges; (5) that of the graduate school of arts and literature; (H) that of the Ogden 
(graduate) School of Science; (7) that of the divinity school. Only the three last 
correspond to faculties in the German sense. 

''Administrative board of the university press; administrative board of the uni- 
versity libraries, laboratories, and museums; administrative board of the university 
athliation; administrative board of physical culture and athletics; administrative 
board of student organizations, publications, and exhibitions; ailministrative ])oar<l 
or the recommendation of teachers. 

<'In Leipsic there are 54, of which, however, 16 are in the medical faculty wliii'h 
is just about to be established in Chicago. 



516 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 



ELEMENTARY AND SECONDAKY SCHOOLS. 



As characteristic of the University of Chicago, there deserves to be 
mentioned the secondary school connected therewith (university acad- 
emy in Moro-an Park.) It was opened in 1S92 in the former theological 
seminar}^ that was merged with the university, and, like all the sec- 
ondary schools of the United States, was for both sexes. Recently, 
however, girls have been excluded because the pupils all live in the 
house itself and not, as in many other secondary schools, in their 
families." The school is about 7i miles distant from the university, 
and consists of a row of buildings, a library with 5,000 volumes, dor- 
mitories for 170 pupils, etc. The academy is attended for from four 
to five 3^ears, preparation for college being thus attained. The 
instruction includes Latin, Greek, French, German, mathematics, 
history, physics, chemistry, botany, and geography. This secondary 
school belongs to the pedagogical department, as does also an elemen- 
tary school situated near the university, which accommodates 100 
children of an age from 4 to 14 3"ears, and costs |13,000 annually. 
These are considered as necessary for the pedagogical department, and 
are, so to speak, laboratories in which problems of elementary and 
secondar}^ education are to be worked out. " No work can commend 
itself more heartily to the attention of the investigator than the study 
of the growth and development of the mind of the child, and the adap- 
tation of educational theories to such growth." A similar establish- 
ment on a larger scale has recently been organized at the Columbia 
University in New York,* and at the Chicago Universit}^ there has 
recently been laid the cornerstone of a school of education for which 
$1,000,000 are available, and which will contain an elementary school 
for kindergarten instruction and for instruction in beginnings, a sec- 
ondary school (academy) provided with a manual training school, and 
a normal school. 

UNIVERSITY EXTENSION. 

The university extension concerns itself chiefly with lectures in 
Chicago and in neighborhoods more or less remote, on philoso- 
phy, pedagogics, political econoni}", history, sociology, anthropology, 
Semitic languages and literatures, Greek language and literature, 
Romance languages and literatures, English language and literature, 
astronomy, geolog}^, zoology, neurology, botan}^ music, art. Old and 
New Testament literature and interpretation, and in this the director of 
the art institute and employees of the Field Columbian Museum take 
part; these also are docents in the university. In 1898-99 there were 
125 such courses held. Besides this, the university extension gives 

« There are many secondary schools in the United States in which pupils of both 
sexes live in the school itself. These are the so-called boarding schools.

Mann School, by S. T. Button.

instruction })y means of corrospondenoe in the above-named sciences, 
as well as in theological seminary work, for such as have not attended 
any college. In 1898-99 1,019 persons availed themselves of such 
correspondence courses. It has been shown that man}- of the best 
students of the universit}' have been brought to the universit}' by 
means of correspondence study, and that man}'^ of the best students 
have been carried along- in this way while necessarily absent from the 
university. 

UNIVEKSITY AKKI I.IATIONS. 

The university permits certain institutions to affiliate themselves 
with it in order, through their influence, to favora})ly affect primary 
and secondary schools, as well as colleges, with a view to raising them 
to a higher level. This affiliation occurs in four forms — organic mem- 
bership in the university, semiorganic union with the university, alli- 
ance between the university and completely independent institutions, 
and tentative affiliation. 

UNIVERSITY PRESS. 

The publishing division of the university deserves special mention, 
especially as it is destined to great development. Quite recently the cor- 
ner stone of a new building for its use has been laid." The Universitj'^ 
Press consists of four departments: Publications (offices now estab- 
lished in the botanical laboratory building); printing (now established 
in the gymnasium); purchase of books and apparatus for the entire 
universit}', entirely done through this office, and bookstore and 
stationery for students and teachers (now established in Cobb lecture 
hall). The following are regularly published: The Annual Register, 
a comprehensive annual publication in quarto, which gives much infor- 
mation concerning the university; The President's Report, an annual 
publication in quarto; The University Record, a weekly paper; Cir- 
cular of Information of the Graduate Schools and Colleges in the 
Departments of Arts, Literature, and Science; Circular of Infor- 
mation of the Divinit}^ School; University Handbook; Circulars of 
Information of the Universitv Extension Division; Calendar of the 
Morgan Park Academy; Departmental Programmes. The following 
periodicals: Journal of Political Economy ((luarterly); American 
Journal of Sociology (bimonthly); American Journal of Semitic 
Languages and Literatures (quarterly'); Biblical World (monthly); 
Astrophysical Journal (10 numbers per year); Journal of Geology 
(bimonthly); School Review (10 numbers per3'ear); Elementary School 
Record (monthl}'); Botanical Gazette (monthly); American Journal of 
Theology (quarterly). Besides there are the following, which appear 
from time to time: Contributions to Philosophy (I-IV); Px'onomic 
Studies (I-IV); Studies in Political Science (I-III); Studies in Class- 

« Now ready, 1903.

ical riiilology (1-V); Germanic Studies (I-III); Englisli Studies (I); 
Physioloo-ical Archives (I); Anthropological Bulletins (l-lll)/' In 
1898-99 there were expended for these about $41,000, al)out |(),500 of 
which was for salaries. In the printing- office there were 20 to 40 
typesetters employed, but the forms were sometimes printed outside. 
Besides the above-named official publications, the printing office also 
issued in 1898-99: Proceedings of the National Educational Associa- 
tion; Fifth Herbart Year-Book; Smith: Chemistry Outlines; Report 
of the New England Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools; 
Report of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools; Proceedings of the Southern State Association; S. W. 
Burnham: Catalogue of Double Stars, I (publication of the Yerkes 
Observatory); J. Dewey: School and Societ}^ (already in its 3d edi- 
tion); Manual Training Magazine. In the book and stationery store 
there were sold in 1898-99 articles to the value of about $39,000. It 
is an unusually convenient arrangement for the professors and students 
that they can enjoy, within the university itself, a w^ell -assorted book- 
store, where they also receive a considerable discount. 

CONCLUSION. 

As I stood one beautiful clear evening in Indian sunmier upon the 
tower of the lofty Masonic Temple of Chicago, fanned })y soft ])reezes, 
my glance swept far to the eastward over the unlimited expanse of 
smiling Lake Michigan, overarched by the blue heavens; on the west, 
however, the dark red sun laboriously struggled through the unsightly 
vapor that poui-ed from the smoking, steaming Babel, from the mil- 
lion-mouthed monster of a city, a hell — yet looking out upon a 
seductive paradise! 

"Chicago is the young giant among the cities of the earth, and is 
only at the threshold of its destiny," says a recent English observer. 
" We hope that during the coming years there will l)e removed from 
the way many of the stumbling blocks that we all very well know 
still exist to-da}^ in this new and luiequally developed city; but 
Chicago sixty years ago was only a prairie, with a few thousand men 
on it," so wrote to me recently one of my friends from there. 

In the description of the institutions which has filled the previous 
pages I could do justice to only a portion of the intellectual life of 
this city, perhaps the most interesting one of the whole earth, espe- 
cially because of its great contrasts; for to me the view from the lofty 
building appeared symbolical," and most interesting for a further rea- 
son — because so much is still to be expected from its development more 
than from any other city^ — that it promises to become one of thfe future 

« There are also published by the students: The University Weekly and the Cap and 
Gown (a yearly publication).

"wonders of the world." Tlie oe mis for this can he seen shooting 
up everywhere. 

Man}' things 1 have been unable to include within the scope of my 
studies. Among these are the technical schools (Armour Institute and 
Mechanics' Institute), the medical schools, the hospitals, the cit}^ hall 
and count}' court-house, and others. The last named, double building, 
cost $5,000,000, and certainly offers much that is instructive in many 
ways as regards museum interests, as do, for example, the correspond- 
ing buildings in Boston, which I hope to be able to describe. Recently 
Mr. J. E. DuBois, from Dubois, in Pennsylvania, gave $1,000,000 
for a Chicago medical school of homoeopathic practices, with a hos- 
pital, which led me to lament that this large sum was not applied to 
efforts more scientific in character than those of homoeopathy. I 
mention this in order to show how all possible interests find there a 
ready advocate. Perhaps there had deserved to be included in my 
report a description of a building like the "Monadnock'" (named for a 
mountain in New Hampshire about 3,200 feet high), which is only 
100 feet long and 70 feet wide, but is seventeen stories high and contains 
1,200 business offices, with 6,000 persons constantly employed therein, ** 
It constitutes, by itself, a postal district with 11 employees, who daily 
handle 15,000 pieces of mail and sell stamps amounting to $2,000. 

Although not in this connection, I might, however, in order to illus- 
trate the specially developed talent of the Chicagoans for organization, 
as is shown in the incredibly rapid establishment of their museums, 
libraries, and universities, mention one interesting installation among 
many others, namely, that of the city railway. 

Chicago, the city of so many technical surprises, possesses a very remarkable 
arrangement of its city railways. From a center where almost the entire business 
life is crowded together in 20-story houses within a space of a few square miles, there 
radiate toward the south, the north, the southwest and the west, four great electric 
lines, elevated on iron viaducts, each 10 to 15 miles long. On the eastern side the 
business portion of Chicago is limited, as is well known, l)y Lake Michigan. The 
uniting member and turning place for all the elevated lines, giving at the same time 
an opportunity of transfer from one line to another, and yet constituting a line by 
itself, is the so-called Union Loop in the center of Chicago, perhaps the most remark- 
al)l(' and most fretjuented piece of railway in the world. The loop is a double-track 
viaduct about 2 miles long, that surrounds a rectangular area of a portion of the 
chessboard-like blocks of the business center. The area is live blocks wide and 
seven blocks long, and its seven stations are so arranged that from any point in the 
business center it will take not more than three minutes to reach the nearest one. 
In this way it is possible to reach a railway going in any direction, for the trains of 
all four of the elevated roads, as soon as they get to the business part of the city, 
nuist pass over the loop and stoj) at its eleven stations before they can again come to 
their own line and i)ass out toward the suburbs. The travel on this loop is enor- 

« Life in such a colossus is depicted by H. B. Fuller in his readable romance, The 
Cliff Dwellers, which at the time created so unpleasant a sensation in Chicago, 
because in it the author unsparingly exposed some of the dark .«ides of social life 
among the swarming millions of the city. 



520 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

mous. Ou an average day there are 1,000 trains or 4,000 cans used, and during the 
busy hours of the day there are always 30 trains at a time upon this short line, 
indeed on special occasions, caused by excessive crowding, the tracks of the loop are 
literally covered with trains; they often run at intervals of less than one minute 
apart. Although the loop is provided with a double track yet all the trains go in 
the same direction; the lines that join the loop at three of its four corners are dis- 
tributed upon the two tracks, according to their frequency. In the first 14 months 
after it was established this remarkable railway was used by 80,000,000 of passengers. 
The great business houses situated near the stations have already hegun to build 
stairways from their second stories connecting directly with the gallery of the station 
in order to spare their visitors the trouble of descending into the street. At each 
station there is also a special stairway for the trains of each line and a reserved space 
is railed off along the track, so that the loop may really be said to have 44 stations. 
The whole loop might properly be considered as a single gigantic terminal station 
for all four elevated roads, and as the grandest effort hitherto made to unite several 
railway lines in a single center. (Newspaper notice). 

In conclusion I will name a few of the scientific, literary, and art 
associations of Chicago, as far as I heard of them, as these characterize 
the intellectual life of the city: Chicago Astronomical Society, Hum- 
boldt Club, Illinois Audubon Society, Audubon Ckib, Entomological 
Society, Mycological Society, Polytechnical Society of Chicago, West- 
ern Society of Engineers, Literary Club, Kavenswood Historical 
Society, Chicago Societ}^ of Egyptian Kesearch, Altura Library Asso- 
ciation, Chicago Library Club, Bibliographical Society, Book Club, 
Central Art Association of America, Chicago Art Association, Art Stu- 
dents' League of Chicago, Society of Western Artists, Illinois Chapter 
of the American Institute of Architects, Chicago Architectural Club, 
Chicago Ceramic Association, Altura Ceramic Art Club, These, how- 
ever, by no means exhaust the list of such societies. 



B.— NOTES ON SOME EUROPEAN MUSEUMS AND KINDRED 

INSTITUTIONS. « 

INTRODUCTION. 

After visiting, during the autumn of 1899, some of the museums 
and libraries of the eastern section of the United States, concerning 
which I made a partial report, it seemed to me desirable to revisit 
some of the principal museums of Europe, and to examine others for 
the first time, in order to have a just measure for estimation of the 
American establishments, which profoundly impressed me. The gen- 
eral direction of the Royal Collections of Art and Science in Dresden 
also commissioned me to do this in view of the proposed, though

recently deferred, erection of a new museum building in Dresden, and 
I now report on the result of my observations. 

I could not, in the case of cities like London and Paris, undertake 
to make as detailed a report as I attempted for New York and Chicago, 
and as I hope to do for Washington, Philadelphia, and Boston (includ- 
ing Cambridge), for that would require nuich more time than I had at 
my disposal. There is, indeed, no necessity for this, for the museums 
and allied institutions of London and Paris are known to every one 
who has to do with museum administration. I could only endeavor 
to discuss what is new and worthy of imitation there, and what would 
be valuable for solving our problem in Dresden. 

Although probably no one will take exceptions to my noting the good 
features that I Hnd, yet in case of blame some one is certain to sa}^ that 
'' those who live in glass houses should not throw stones." Of course 
I am aware of the inadequacy of my own efforts, and I know that in 
many instances the deficiencies are to a greater extent the fault of the 
circumstances than of the persons, for one individual has little con- 
trol of the man}^ combinations on which the historical development of 
museums and similar institutions depend. It is rare, at least in 
Europe, though possible in America, that anyone has an opportunity 
to commence at the beginning and build up an establishment from the 
foundation. My censure, therefore, can not and will not be personal, 
})ut will deal rather with the conditions that are beyond the control of 
the individual. If I am blamed for recounting my experiences princi- 
pally in the form of personal impressions, the reader may be assured 
that I do so only for the purpose of allowing others to share them, for 
which purpose I can not avoid the subjective method of statement. 

The arrangement indicates the course of my travels during Septem- 
ber and October, 1901. 

Photographs were in most cases difficult to obtain, and my illus- 
trations are consequently not uniformly distributed, and in some cases 
unsatisfactory. To the gentlemen who were so good as to place orig- 
inals at my disposal, and who were in other ways of much assistance to 
me, I here make acknowledgment of my sincere obligations.

In its contents the Natural History Museum in London unquestion- 
ably occupies the first place among all such nuiseums of the world. 
The portion to which the public is admitted is unusually extensive and 
is open daily from morning until evening. The visitors are not counted

very few seats for visitors. There is a restaurant in which one can 
dine at a reasonable price.

Th(> airhitect was A. Waterhouse." Plate 38 shows the exterior of

selves concerning both of these defects, and are certainly the best judges 

«The construction extended from 1873 to 1880. In 1886 the installation of the 
collections, which were formerly in the British Museum (Great Russell street), was 
completed. The building is 675 feet long and has two towers 190 feet high, while

of the lirst one. The very high entrance hall (Plate 34) appears to me to 
be too churchlike and empty. That it looks very dingy is, of course, 
due lirst of all to the London atmosphere, but perhaps also it is due to 
the character of the building- materials and the yellow color, being of 
terra cotta, ornamented with animal representations in high relief." 
The side galleries with skylights (fig. S3) give somewhat the impression 
of factory rooms. The installation is in some respects excellent, but 
in many cases is capable of improvement, notwithstanding the fact that 
enormous sums have been expended on it. Some groups of birds, for 
example, cost as much as $250 or more. Rather too nuich has been 
done in this respect to the greater neglect of other things. The cases 
are of mahogany, clumsy and unprepossessing; some of the back- 
grounds are green. The labels have been prepared with much care 
and taste. The arrangements for lighting are in part deficient. An 
anthropological gallery has recently been installed, which promises in 
time to be very attractive, but otherwise there has been but little 
general change in the twelve years since 1 last visited the museum. 
The number of visitors on the three occasions when I was at the museum 
was not great, and one can scarcely feel that there is justification for 
exposing these valuable collections to the light from morning till 
evening, when it is evident that they will ])e ruined thereby. If the 
shades are drawn, however, it becomes so dark that one can see but 
little. Everywhere in England the collections are exhibited during 
the entire day, and it is said that this custom must continue, for other- 
wise the money for expenses will not be forthcoming. I think, how- 
ever, that this is an error. If the officials themselves were onl}^ 
convinced that the collections intrusted to their keeping are really 
being injured they would be able to impress this fact upon the trus- 
tees, but they fail to consider the subject, or at any rate have neglected 
it until very recently. The public would soon become accustomed to 
shorter hours of opening if there were some way of making them gen- 
erally known. This is not the case now, everyone knowing that he 
can gain admittance from morning until evening. 

There are no double windows, these always being omitted in English 
museums. There is no necessity for them, however, for no annoy- 

the large entrance hall is 170 feet long, 95 feet wide, and 72 feet high. Regarding 
the style the architect says (General Guide to the British Museum, Natural History, 
1888, p. 12) that it is "earlier Romanesque, which prevailed largely in Lombardy 
and the Rhineland from the tenth century to the end of the twelfth century." 

"The architect says ((hiide to the Museum, p. 14): The Museum is the largest, if 
not indeed the only modern building in vvhich terra cotta has been exclusively used 
for external facades and interior wall surfaces, including all the varied decoration 
which this involves. On the western side of the building, where it is intended that 
the zoological collection shall be placed, the ornamentation of the terra cotta (which 
will be found very varied both within and witliout the building) has been based 
exclusively on living organisms. On the east side, where geology and paleontology 
find a home, the terra-cotta ornamentation has been derived from extinct specimens.

ance is caused l)y frost and melting- ice. In most respects the climate 
is milder than with us, though single windows are found also in manj^ 
other European museums as well as in the large museums of the 
United States, where the winters are very cold. In the newly-con- 
structed Natural History Museum in Brussels, however (see p. 597), I

found double windows with a very considerable space between the two 
lights. The Director was of the opinion that the great hall (S-t by 30 
meters) could not be heated without the doul)le windows. I do not 
share this opinion, for in the present day any room can be well heated. 



526 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 190.3. 

and moreover, double windows are just as likely to become frosted. 
These are not, therefore, necessary in a new building, unless we prefer 
them bocauso the movement of air and conseciuenth" of dust can be 
diminished ])y their use, and because the dust from the street is less 
likely to enter, except when, as we shall see below, the windows are 
closely secured and dust-free air is brought in through other openings. 

The museum can not be said to be entirely fireproof. Much super- 
fluous wood is used, and the location of the heating apparatus is 
unfavorable. 

The museum has four departments — zoology, geology, mineralogy, 
and botany. Its annual expenditure is about $250,000. Each depart- 
ment has a keeper who receives from $3,500 to $4,000, and there are 
assistant keepers with salaries of $2,600 to $3,200; assistants of the 
first class, with salaries ranging from $1,500 to $2,500, and of the 
second class, from $750 to $1,500. 

Special mention should be made of the publication by the museum, 
at its own cost, of systematic descriptive catalogues aggregating con- 
siderably more than 200 volumes, with thousands of iUustrations. In 
this undertaking the British Museum is preeminent and by it has put 
deeply in its debt every student of natural science. It excels all other 
museums of the earth so markedh^ in this respect that they sink into 
insignificance by comparison. It woidd be useless even to attempt to 
compete with England in this regard. These catalogues are not only 
catalogues of the collections of the museum, but monographs in which 
all known species are described, whether the}^ are represented in the 
museum or not. There is, however, little that is lacking in the collec- 
tions of the British Museum, for, as has already been said, no col- 
lections in the world can be compared with them in completeness. It 
is not my purpose here to describe in detail this famous collection. 
The most notable exhibits are, perhaps, those in the mineralogical and 
paleontological departments, and in the so-called "Index Museum"" 
of the main hall, which serves as an introduction to zoology and is an 
original creation of the former director. Sir William Flower. Many 
museums have endeavored to imitate this feature to some extent. 
The catalogues mentioned are distributed liberall3^

[(ireat Russell street, Bloomsbury.] 

In the British Museum on this occasion I confined my attention 
chiefly to the ethnographic collection. It contains many valuable old 
specimens, l)ut has not kept pace with its sister collections. While 
Berlin has since the seventies built up an ethnographical collection 
which is scarcel}' to be surpassed, and good collections have been 
brought together in many cities of Europe and America, London has 



STUDIKS ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 527 

made little prog-ress in the latter half (»t" the last ceiitiiiy. The former 
director, Sir AugHistus Franks, a man of European reputation, and 
durinji;- the time of his administration (1860 to l.SSO), the best authority 
on ethnographical matters — one might say the teacher of the older gen- 
eration of ethnographers — gave in the latter part of his life less atten- 
tion to the broader pro])l(Mns of ethnography. However, on account 
of the world-wide rule of the English Government, it is naturally and 
nuist continue to be the task of the British Museum to lead in eth- 
nography, since that nuiseum has greater opportunities than any 
other. This collection nevertheless has not made much progress, 
and the contents of the ethnographical department of the British 
Museum make no better showing than many of the continental 
nuiseums, not to mention the Berlin collection. In this stepmotherly 
treatment of ethnography the British Museum does not set a good 
example to the other museums throughout that country, while the 
Berlin Museum, for example, has had and continues to have a fruitful 
influence throughout the whole of Germany. In London the antiqui- 
ties resulting from the English explorations in the Pacific Ocean (the 
British Museum was established in 1753) are, however, still unex- 
celled. The arrangement, classification, and labeling leave something 
to be desired. The exhibits in halls lighted from above are crowded 
and not pleasing. 

In this respect England has allowed herself to be surpassed, but this 
fault may be found with all of her ethnographic collections, excepting 
that at Oxford (see p. 533). 

While much has been generallv done in the British Museum in the 
wa}^ of explanatory labeling, this can not be said of the ceramic col- 
lection, which, however, still excels in that respect some of the conti- 
nental collections. 

The famous librar}' of the British Museum, although it possesses 
such magnificent features, can not as a building or in man}^ of its 
installations and contrivances compare with the new American libraries. 
It recjuires, for example, from a half to three-quarters of an hour to 
obtain a book, and, besides, the facilities for reading- are not entirely 
convenient. Books are not allowed to be taken home. The printed 
catalogues, on the other hand, are unequaled, ])eing — considering the 
riches of the collections, for the most part bibliographies, while they 
contain also a large number of cross references — admirable works. 
G. A. Criiwell " calls them "a milestone in the history of catalogue 
making.'' In 1875, the manuscript catalogue having increased to 2,000 
volumes and being too unhandy and cumbrous for use, its printing- 
was undertaken, and was completed in twenty years, from 1881 to 
1!>00, about 400 quarto parts at a ])rice of ^150. The increase, how- 
ever, is so extraordinary that tlM> printing has been continued, and

there has been published, for example, a three- volume subject catalogue 
in octavo, embracing the additions from 1880 to 1895, comprising over 
120,000 works. The library receives all volumes cop3^righted in Great 
Britain and Ireland and in the British colonies, and expends about 
$50,000 yearly each for purchases and for binding. As to the number 
of volumes erroneous reports are generally circulated. It is claimed 
that the National Library in Paris is the largest, with 3,000,000 volumes; 
then follows the British Museum, with over 2,000,000; then the Berlin 
RoA^al Librar}', with 1,000,000. As a matter of fact the British Museum 
is the richest, with from four to five millions, of which perhaps half 
a million are periodicals that occupy 12 straight miles and embrace 
over 30,000 different journals (exclusive of newspapers), in which 
respect no other library in the world even approximately approaches 
it. In wealth of books, therefore, the library of the British Museum 
in London is unequaled, though the number of readers is compara- 
tively small— in 1899, 188,551.« 

The total number of visitors to the British Musenm in 1900 was 
689,249 persons, of which 43,892 came on Sundays.* 

19. OTHER LONDON MUSEUMS. 

MUSEUM OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OP SURGEONS OF ENGLAND. 

This famous museum of comparative anatomy, whose directors in 
recent times have been, in succession, Owen and Flower, can perhaps 
be regarded as the best natural-science museum in the world, even 
though it does not entirely correspond to the modern standard. It 
consists of a series of large halls with skylights and two or three gal- 
leries one above the other (Plate 35 represents one of these halls). On 
account of this arrangement the light is sometimes insufficient; there 
are corners and spaces underneath the galleries which are completely 
dark, and the reflection from the glass desk cases in the galleries is 
very annoying. The general effect, however, is noble and beautiful. 
Much stress is laid upon the admirable method of installation, though 
it does not alwaj^s in every respect I'epresent the highest advances. 
The anthropological collection is, in particular, not so carefully and 
scientificalh" installed as far-reaching demands would necessitate, and 
the whole museum could be kept much cleaner. There is, however, 
not a sufficient labor force for this purpose. 

Although the disadvantage of high halls and galleries lighted from 
above was known, in order not to depart from the uniform plan of the 
interior of the museum a similar large hall has lately been added. 
The cabinets and cases are, as is almost uniformly the case in England, 
constructed of mahogany — antiquated and clumsy, and not dust proof.

The soot from the iiii' of the city does not penetrate too much into the 
huildino-, since, with the exception of the skylights, there are no win- 
dows in the halls; a double glass roof, moreover, otfers considerable 
protection. The ventilation arrangements are primitive. 

The library comprises 50,000 volumes and does not incorporate any 
books relating to systematic zoology. There is a card catalogue 
arranged by authors and subjects. 

The collections contain upward of 11,000 comparative-anatomy 
preparations, among them upward of 3,700 fossil and nearly 2,700 
pathologico-anatomical. Excellent printed catalogues concerning 
them are published, among others a Descriptive Catalogue of the 
Osteological Series contained in the Museum of the Royal College of 
Surgeons of England (2 vols., London, 1853, quarto, xlv, 914 pp.); 
a Catalogue of the Specimens illustrating the Osteology and Dentition 
of Vertebrated Animals, recent and extinct, coptained in the Museum 
of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, I-III (London. 1879-1S91, 
octavo, Ixvii, 1036 pp.); a Descriptive Catalogue of the Teratological 
Series in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of P^ngland 
(London, 1893, octavo, xxiii, 192 pp). The collection is, first of all, 
scientific, and as such is a true ornament to the nation. 

The illustration given is reproduced from the Souvenir of the Cen- 
tenary of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, 1800-1900 (Lon- 
don, 1900, quarto, 33 pp.). 

SOUTH KENSINGTON OR VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM. 

This famous museum of art and industry is unsuitable as a building, 
the lighting being in some parts very bad and the installation much 
too croAvded and not well adapted for inspection.^ The labeling is 
ver}" good throughout, though the cards are printed in such small type 
that in the insufficient light the}' are often quite illegible. On the 
other hand, the former India Museum (Indian section), that now" 
belongs to it, is installed in a primitive, unsystematic manner, and 
insufficiently labeled. Furthermore, the ethnographic section, part of 
which is ver\' valuable, is not well arranged. The management of the 
oriental art collections, which, with the Indian one just mentioned, are 
now located in the adjacent Imperial Institute (which, intended in the 
first place for collections, is now occupied by the university), is not 
entirely satisfactor3^ New halls, however, are now being erected for 
both these large collections. It is impossible for me to do justice to the 
tremendous whole of the South Kensington Museum in the space of 
this report. Besides, it is generally known. Its excessive abundance 
of objects quite oppresses the receptive faculty of the most alert sight-

seer." This ovcmbuncUince constitutes an especial vice of museuin 
science. Only the best should be readily accessible. Here also the 
collections are daniac^ed by being exposed to daylight (also to electric 
light) from morning until evening, which is the more regrettable since 
a large portion of the exhibits are of such a nature as not to endure 
the light at all. The exposure is, therefore, scarcely justifiable. 

The number of visitors to the museum in 1900 was 846,489, of which 
87,854 came on Sundays. Umbrellas and the like are not deposited 
at the door. Visitors are at a disadvantage on account of the small 
number of trained attendants. The majority of attendants in nearly 
all English museums are policemen, who are engaged oidy temporarily. 
One is therefore unable to obtain information of an}^ value concernirig 
the collections, and on account of the size of the whole exhibition a 
study of the "guides" and "handbooks" is not to be thought of 
unless one is pursuing a single tpiestion. Even if a person wishes, for 
example, to obtain information about some certain object, it requires 
at least an hour or more, on account of the extent of the collection. 

The annual expenditure for 1897-98 amounted to $420,000, of which 
$70,000 was devoted to the purchase of specimens, $190,000 to sala- 
ries ($60,000 to the policemen), $60,000 for cleaning, and |26,000 for 
heating and lighting.* Some very instructive data relating to the 
internal affairs of this museum may be found in the second report 
from the select committee on museums of the science and art depart- 
ment, with the proceedings of the committee, ordered by the House 
of Commons to be printed July 29, 1898 (folio, 105 pp.). 

NATIONAL (iALl-EKY. 

The National (jallery, with its famous collection of paintings, lacks 
intimate charm in the st^de of its building and in the installation of 
the pictures. This is emphasized by the great influx of the general 
public. Umbrellas, etc., are required to be deposited. In 1901 it was 
visited by 478,346 persons on 204 free days, besides 35,704 on 30 Sun- 
day afternoons, and 42,177 on Tuesdays and Frida3's for an admission 
fee of six pence, making a total of 556,227. (The Dresden Galler}-

WALLACE COLLECTION. 

This famous collection of paintings and works of art is installed in 
a palace (Hertford House), which, though it has been to some extent 
adapted to its present purpose, yet possesses many disadvantages as a 
museum. It is one of the greatest attractions of its kind in London.

"The arrangement of the building is as follows: Connected with 
some smaller halls, which are first entered, is a larger one about 108 
by 60 feet and 42 feet high, with skylight, and encircled above with 
a gallery 6 feet 6 inches broad. These spaces constitute the front 
half of the building, and contain a systematically arranged ethno- 
graphical collection, chiefly of personal ornaments, which are installed 
in the gallery in cabinets. In the rear half of the building, on the 
ground fioor, the ethnographical collection is continued. The hall is 
not provided with any light, and when anyone is admitted it is illumi-

'^ Extracts from a report which was placed at my disposal by Dr. O. Richter, 
assistant in the Dresden Ethnographical Museum, who visited the Horniman Museum 
in Fel)ruary, 1902. I did not find time to visit this museum, on account of its dis- 
tance in Forest Hill. From a ilescription by the director, R. (^uick, in the Reporl 
of the Miwums AsmcHithm, 1900, pages 58-63 (compare, also, the Horniman Free 
Museum, in The Sfiidio, XXIV, pp. 196-202, with 5 illustrations, 1901), I note that 
this museum of art and science was l)uilt in 1899 by C. H. Townsend, in free Renais- 
sance style, fireproof, of red bricks, with limestone front, in which is introduced acrystal 
mosaic picture 36 feet long and 11 feet high, after the design of A. Bell. The building 
has a bell tower 33 meters high, which contains a water reservoir for supplying the heat- 
ing apparatus. The museum is, in its entirety, about 280 feet long and 65 feet wide. 
The collections were formerly installed in the residence of Mr. F. J. Horniman, wlio 
had zealously collected them in his travels around the world during forty years, and who 
allowed his residence to be torn down to make room for the museum. Since 1891 it 
has been open to visitors on three days in each week. Between 1891 and 1898, when 
it was demolished to make room for the new building, it was visited by 455,591 per- 
sons. Since 1891 the director has issued, annually, a brief report, with illustrations. 
The library contains 6,000 vohunes. There are 7 officials. The entire cost of main- 
tenance is defrayed bv Mr. Horniman.

level with the gallery of the front half, and consists of a hall (natural- 
history collections) with a skylight, about 108 by 60 feet and 42 feet 
high, with galleries about it (insects, minerals). 

"The main portion of the ethnographical collection is arranged by 
classes, as in the museum at Oxford (see p. 533). The cases are of 
mahogany, and also black, with panes of plate glass, 8 feet high, -iO

and similar shelves, which show up the contents very distinctly. The 
labels are printed in black letters on a white ground pasted on a red- 
bordered card. Nearly every specimen has a label. The exhibit is 
very clean, intelligible, and elegant. The entire museum can be lighted 
by electricity, a portion of the lights being supported by brass mount- 
ings in the modern pendant style. In the dark adjoining room are 
placed apparently such parts of the ethnographical section as could 
not find place in the main hall without injuring its fine general effect, 
or whatever was unsuitable for exhibiting. This room represents 
the storehouse of the exhibition series. Eastern Asia and India are 
especially well represented, but there is also a fine Benin collection 
(see Seventh Annual Report, 1897, pp. 18, 19, Plates ii-v), as also some 
things from New Zealand. 

"In the zoological collection there are three fine animal groups, 
the elk, the walrus, and the polar bear." 

BRITISH FIRE-PREVENTION COMMITTEE. 

I should not omit mentioning an institution, praiseworth}' and of 
unusual importance to museums, namely, the British fire-prevention 
committee, Avhich has issued publications since 1898. These may be 
obtained at the oftices of the committee (No. 1 Waterloo place. Pall 
Mall, London). The contents of the volumes bear upon the com- 
prehensive functions and purposes of the society, as may be wit- 
nessed by a few of the titles here given: I (ten articles with many 
illustrations, 1898, $2). Fire-resisting fioors used in London; Lessons 
from fire and panic; How to build fireproof structures. II (ten arti- 
cles with many illustrations, 1900, $5). Fire tests with unprotected 
columns; Fire tests with floors; Fire tests with ceilings. Ill (ten arti- 
cles with many illustrations, 1900, $5). Fire tests with doors; Fire 
tests with partitions; Fire tests with glass." The chairman of the 
committee and the publisher of its reports is Architect E. O. Sachs, 
London. 

It will be seen that I have treated in the above pages only a small 
portion of the London collections, and that portion only in the most 
cursory manner. 

« There appeared also in 1902 two volumes, with 219 and 226 pages and very many 
plates, under the title Facts on Fire Prevention: The results of fire tests oonduL-ted

VI.— OXFORD. 

' 20. UNIVERSITY MUSEUM, ETHNOGRAPHICAL DEPARTMENT (PITT 
RIVERS COLLECTION). 

In Oxford, that famous old university town, which I visited first in 
1S78, the chief attraction for me this time was the famous ethnograph- 
ical collection presented to the Oxford Musemn in 1884 by Col. Lane 
Fox (later (xeneral Pitt Rivers), who died in 1900. Subsequently 
Colonel Fox founded a new collection in Farnham (AViltshire), not far 
from Stoneheno-e, which has ])ecome quite as noted, but which, as it 
was too far away for me, I did not visit. The ethnographical collec- 
tion is in an annex added in 1887 to the university museum, a modern

gothic structure (1857-1860). I pass over the natural-science collec- 
tions, as I have no special remarks to make regarding them." The 
ethnographical collection, however, is distinguished from all other 
similar ethnographical collections in the world by the manner of its 
installation. 

''In all ethnographical museums a geographical classification is 
adopted as the principal basis of arrangement, whereb}' all objects 
from the same region are grouped together — a system obviously 

"Prof. E. Ray Lanke.ster, of the British ^luseuni, .said in 1S97 oonrerning the build- 
ing of the Oxford Universit}' IMuseuni: "Our great university inuseuiu building is 
simply an absurdity." lieport Froceedlnys ^fuseumtl Associatiou, 1897, pp, 21-22 (1903).

advantaji'eoiis from many points of view, and especiall}' to students of 
comparative ethnology, as showing at a ghmce the condition of culture 
to be found in any tribe, race, or district. In the i^itt Rivers Museum, 
on the other hand, the primary basis of classification which is adopted 
and which distinguishes it from other kindred museums, is one like 
that employed in the arrangement of most natural-history museums, 
the objects being grouped according to their morphological affinities 
and resemblances (as it were), all objects of like form and function being- 
brought together into groups, which again are subdivided into smaller 
groups — into genera and species, as one might almost say." (See Bal- 
four's remarks in Report Museums Association, 1897, p. 51.) There is 
only one larger natural-history museum that is arranged geographic- 
all}^ and that is the Agassiz Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cam- 
bridge, in the United States, which on that account became famous 
during the life of its originator. Its reputation can not now be 
claimed to so great an extent, since, although it is otherwise so 
impoi'tant in the scientific world, it has not in this one respect kept 
abreast with the times. There is, however, an example on a small scale 
of geographic classification of a zoological collection, which I shall 
mention beyond under Dublin. It is therefore possible to study in the 
Oxford collection, so to speak, the natural history and the phylogeny 
of the various arts and industries of mankind. To this end Pitt 
Rivers, so far as possible, associated in groups all like objects from 
the various parts of the world in which they occur. By means of 
such synoptic series, when fairly representative, geographical distri- 
bution of any class of implements, weapons, etc., may be seen and 
the relative condition and local variations of kindred or similar objects 
may be studied and views formed as to the important question of the 
monogenesis or polygenesis of certain widely distributed arts. The 
probable lines of dispersal where they have apparently emanated from 
one center, may be determined upon incidentally, of course, helping to 
throw light upon the migrations of races themselves. Moreover, by 
arranging the specimens in each group in progressive series — that is, 
by commencing with those objects which appear to be the most primi- 
tive and general in their class, and by leading gradually up to the 
higher and more specialized forms, the developmental history of the 
higher forms may be at any rate suggestively illustrated and material 
be supplied for the stud}^ of the growth of culture. We are enabled 
to form some conclusions as to the variations by which progress in any 
given art or industry has step by step been afl'ected." Inasmuch as 
the prehistoric status of civilized peoples, corresponding to that of 
our present lowly-cultured races is included, one learns to understand 
better the relics of former times that have remained to cultivated

man. P^thnography thu.s develops into an eminently liistorieal scienoe. 
Maps, such as show the geographical distribution of the bow, etc., 
explanatory sketches and photographs, contribute to a better under- 
standing of the specimens. Such an arrangement is unusually 
fascinating and suggestive, but it should not be without an adjoining 
collection geographically installed. Only a great ethnographic nmse- 
um like the Berlin Museum could carry out both classitications. A 
very limited representation of this could formerly be seen in the 
Dresden nephrite collection, and additional attempts have been made 
in the collection of the East Asiatic Ceramics from the shores of the 
Indian Ocean, as well as in the collection of ear and arm ornaments.

But imagine the great mass of ethnographic objects from all the 
peoples of the earth arranged in this manner. To present an idea 
of what this is I give below the principal groups of the .system, 
the fundamental principles of which were laid down })y Pitt Rivers, 
but which have since been developed by the present director. 11. Bal- 
four. The small subdivisions num))er man}" hundreds. Pitt Rivers 
originally had his (;ollection in his own private house (he was then 
called Ijane Fox, only changing his name upon coming into his father's 
estate), but as it increased he lent it to the Bethnal Green Museum in 
London, a branch of the South Kensington Museum, where I saw it 
in 187S. From there it was later transferred into the last-named

museum, until it was deposited in Oxford. In 1877 there was pub- 
lished a very vakiable printed catalogue by Lane Fox." 

Since then, however, the collection has increased, mostly through 
donations, and only slightly by purchase and exchange. The annual 
expenditure of the ethnographic section of the university museum is 
only f 1,000, from which also an assistant nuist be paid, and occasional 
smaller sums allotted for additional purchases. Under these circum- 
stances its progress is all the more remarkable. 

Figs. 84 and 85 give representations of the interior. The Gothic 
building with skylights is not very suitable and is in some respects 
unattractive and unadapted to museum purposes (see, for example, tig. 
85, part of a gallery). That the Gothic style is suitable for nmseum 
buildings is demonstrated b}- several American examples (University 
of Chicago, see p. 491), but it must be applied in a very different 
manner than in Oxford, where the typical Gothic halls are found 
without modification. 

The system is as follows:

OBJECTS collected DURING CAPTAIN COOK's VOYAGES. 

The valvmble Cook collections are still kept together in a special 
series, for which we should be the more thankful since there are but 
few traces found in museums of this earl}^ stage of ethnographic sci- 
ence relating to the time of the first contact of Europeans with the 
South Sea Islanders. 

The arrangement of the collection is of such a unique character that 
a thorough studj^, to be satisfactory, should ])e pursued for at least

soA^eral weeks. On iiccount of tlie wealth of its contents, and the 
thouohtfiil maimer in which everything- has ])een l)i'ought together 
and arranged, it is hard to portray it graphically. The collection is 
extraordinarily complete in typical specimens, as a continuous effort 
is made to till every gap. Ver}^ little has been published concerning 
these systematic series. The museum issues annual reports. The 
installation, arrangement in detail, and labeling still leave something 
to be desired, as is also true of the cases, which, being of the South 
Kensington pattern, are somewhat primitive. 

The Oxford Ethnographic Museum seems to me to be in the first 
rank of establishments of its kind. 1 confined my attention in Oxford 
to the examination of this museum. 

VII.— BIRMINGHAM. 
21. CORPORATION ART GALLERY AND MUSEUM. 

Birmingham has a population of more than half a million people. 
In the rear wing of the council house, built in 1878, in the Greek style, 
at a cost of $1,250,000, is located the Corporation Art Gallery and 
Museum. The rooms are large, insufficiently lighted with skylights, 
and in the largest hall is found a gallery. It resembles in its contents, 
arrangement, and general mode of administration, the South Kensing- 
ton Museum in London, which has served as the pattern for many 
English museums, and which also often lends its collections to these 
similar institutions. On account of the very great smokiness of this 
large manufacturing city the interior of the Birmingham museum is 
blackened and not very attractive. On four days of the week it is 
open from 10 a. m. to 9 p. m.; on two, from 10 a. m. to 6 p. m, or 4 
p. m., and on Sundays from 2 to 5 p. m. For several years, practi- 
cally all over England, the museums have been opened on Sundaj^s. 
That the exhibits are damaged by such a continuous lighting- is certain, 
though in this respect it only shares tbe fate of all English and Amer- 
ican collections. 

In 1900 a university was founded in Birmingham, for both sexes, 
having an endowment of $3,000,000 and an appropriation by the city 
and state of $55,000 annually. There is also a library, founded in 
1861, containing 260,000 volumes, with a yearly expenditure of 
$87,000, which daily circulates upward of 4,000 volumes. I devoted 
no time to these two institutions," since the university is hardly 
organized and the libraiy is not modern.

VIII.— MANCHESTER. 

Manchester is an incredibly sinoky city, with over three-cjuarters of 
a million inhabitants, Dresden, which suffers a like disadvantage in 
German}', is a veritable paradise in comparison with it. We are 
compelled to pity the development of culture which ripens under such 
circumstances, and which transforms human habitations into hells. 
A noble citizen of Manchester, T. C. Horsfall," took it upon himself 
to attempt to improve the conditions by both voice and pen, although 
there is no probability that he will be successful. 1 mention among 
others the following of his writings: The Relation of Arts to the Wel- 
fare of the Inhabitants of English Towns (1894, 26 pp.); The Govern- 
ment of Manchester (1895, 46 pp.); An Ideal for Life in Manchester 
Realizable if — (1900, 24 pp.), and The Use of Pictures in Education 
(1902, 28 pp.). In the second paper mentioned he writes on page 10: 

I do not think that in any other country so large a part of the race has been 
brought in stature and general build so far below the normal stature and l)uild of the 
race as has been the case in east and south London and in the jjoorer parts of all our 
large towns; b while the continued prevalence of drinking and licentiousness, and the 
rapid spread of betting and gambling show that the average mental and moral state 
is no better than the physical. * * * The vast Roman Empire fell for lack of 
men and the vaster British Empire, however numerous the British people may be, 
must also fall for want of men if we continue to allow the health of the bodies, brains, 
and hearts of the people of our towns to be sapped as they are now being sapped in 
a great part of Manchester. 

And in the last-mentioned paper, page 4: 

The condition of the town — the condition of all large English manufacturing 
towns — is simply terrible. * * * Ever since I went abroad, for the first time 
after reaching manhood, I have felt convinced that, whatever other reasons there 
may be for our not being loved, the light apparently thrown on the true nature 
of the belief, which England professes to hold, that she is the great civilizer of the 
world, by what the greater part of London is and what Manchester and all other 
large manufacturing towns are, and are allowed by the well-to-do classes in this, 
the richest country in the world, to continue to be, is in itself sufhcient reason for 
our not being loved or respected, and for our being regarded as the nation which 
is of all the most wishful to deceive itself and others. * * * With all that is 
sound in his (that is, theKingof Ashanti's " poor bloodthirsty KingPrempet") nature 
he would know that the life of an unsacrificed Ashanti is preferable to, and only 
nominally less civilized than, that of the Ancoats rough and of those rich persons 
who are willing to allow their countrymen to be Ancoats roughs. 

Ancoats is a suburb to the east of Manchester and has a nmseum — 
Manchester Art Museum at Ancoats — which, in imitation of the Beth- 
nal Green Museum in London, provides musical performances and

lectures for the poor people of this section of the citj^ and a primary 
school, for children from 10 to 14 years of age, in natural history, Eng- 
lish history, and physical geography. More is done in this direction 
in England than in Germany, although it does not appear to me that 
the population is thereby any more enlightened than ours. It is rather 
the contrar^^ At all events, our school education is a better one, and 
this can not be brought about by influencing the adults. 

All the buildings of the city are of a deep black, and this is coupled 
with a smoke-lilled atmosphere.^ For this reason a great portion of 
the population lives miles away about the town, and tens of thousands 
may be seen coming into town in the morning and going out in the 
afternoon. That the interests of museums must suffer under these 
unfavorable conditions is obvious, so I am the more pleased to be able 
to call attention here to some noteworth}^ features. 

22. MANCHESTER MUSEUM OF OWENS COLLEGE. 

Owens College was founded by John Owens, a Manchester mer- 
chant, who died in 1816. Opened in 1851, it has an endowment of 
$500,000. It is known as the University of Manchester, with 1,200 
students of both sexes and 80 instructors, and constitutes a part of the 
Victoria University, which embraces Manchester, Liverpool, and 
Leeds, but has its seat in Manchester.* A million dollars was collected 
b}^ subscription, and the aggregate property of the schools amounts 
to $3,750,000. In 1870, A. Waterhouse began the construction of a 
group of buildings in the Gothic style, which, as remarked under 
the heading of Oxford, is not well adapted for museums and the like, 
at all events, when it is not restrained. Mr. Waterhouse, who is one 
of the most noted architects of England, also designed the new town 
hall in Manchester, built during 1868-1877, at a cost of $4,000,000, 
and the assize courts, built in 1864 at a cost of $500,000, both in the 
Gothic style. In the town hall, which has 314 rooms and a tower 93 
meters high, one is at once convinced of the unsuitability of this arch- 
itecture when looking at the dark stairways and passages where artifi- 
cial lights must be employed even on bright summer days. The 
present museum building was constructed during 1886-88. I do not 
give an exterior view of the structure, which is in the same style as the 
other buildings. Quite recently a large hall (Whitworth Hall) has 
been erected adjoining this, at a cost of $225,000, for which, however, 
the Gothic style is in every way well suited. 

The Natural Science Museum of Owens College (the university), 
under the curatorship of W. E. Hoyles, embraces mineralogy, paleon- 

« Mr. Horsfall also speaks, in a paper published in 1903, of the horrible filthiness 
of the air.

tologT. botany, zoology, anthropology', archeology, ethnograph}^ 
(also numismatics), and is well administered. The large ground floor 
hall, 100 by 50 feet in dimensions, with side lights on the right and 
left and with cases at right angles with the walls, is well lighted 
by large windows (tig. 86). One is here again convinced that this 
is the only proper method of museum lighting, since the halls on the 
second floor, with .skylights and two galleries, one above the other 
(fig. 87), are poorly lighted and sutler under reflections from the 
glass of the cases. The main stairway leads only to this story with 
its large rooms, 100 by 50 feet floor space. 40 feet high, while the 
two galleries are reached by an inside stairway (flg. 87). The Gothic

architecture has a disturliing etfect and detracts from the impressive- 
ness of the exhibits, which it overshadows. Then again, because of 
the favado, a ditference in height, with steps, had to.be introduced in 
the interior, which is inconvenient. Thus in the rear of the main 
halls already mentioned there is a transverse hall about 7'2 b^' 30 feet 
in size. The terrazzo pavement is not especially suitable, since, as 
elsewhere, it becomes broken. Nonelastic stone floors in museums 
are fatiguing to visitors. The wooden cases and cabinets are hardh^ 
up to strict requirements, though generall}' great care and considera- 
tion has been given to the installation of specimens. 8o many labels 
have been provided for the benefit of students that this museum 
really, in some portions, ma}' claim to be "a collection of instructive

labels, each illustrated by a well-selected specimen," which is what an 
ideal museum should be according to the oft- repeated, clever, but para- 
doxical and erroneous, definition by G. Brown Goode in Washing-ton, 
In cosequence of this, it has little attraction for the general public, 
since the scientific atmosphere of the museum is not popularly pleas- 
ing. (During 1898-99 the attendance on week days was 30 to 372; on 
Saturdays and Sundays, 40 to 450; and the largest attendance for the 
year, on Easter Monday, was 952.) Especially well represented are 
the lower animals. The conchological collection is noteworthy. In 
the ornithological department I note, among others, 10,000 skins, the 
famous Dresser collection, which served as a basis for his ornitholoc--

leal works (Pahearctic Birds, Bee-Platers and Rakes). This is well 
installed by itself in cabinets with drawers, but is exposed to danger 
from fire by reason of being housed in the attic, which is not fire- 
proof and contains nnich wood. This attic has onl}' recently been 
added for the purpose. The ethnographical and anthropological col- 
lection is only in its infanc}^ (Egypt, Peru, etc.), and is as yet stingily 
treated, on account of lack of funds. The library of the museum 
comprises 4,000 volumes and has a printed catalogue. The library of 
Owens College has 62,000 volumes and the school of medicine has 
31,700 medical books. 

There are employed six trained scientific men, one printer, three 
assistants, and two attendants. There are no preparators, all stuffing

and the like being done outside the mu.seum by contract, which is the 
practice in most English museums (including the London Natural 
History Museum). The annual expenses are $13,500, of which $7,500 
is spent for salaries. 

From October to May about 25 popular lectures are given (admis- 
sion free), for the most part in the museum, principally on 
Saturdays and Sundays, on the subjects of archeology, geology, min- 
eralogy, zoology, and botany, some of which are intended for children 
(for example On the Struggle for ?]xistence in Nature). The total 
attendance at these lectures amounts, however, to only about 2,500 
persons. 

The museum has published the following: Reports (annual) from 
1895 on, six pence; Notes (six of these have appeared since 1896, but 
they are onh^ reprints of magazine articles); Scientific Guides, partly 
illustrated (reprints from journals), 12 of which have appeared at 
prices from 2 pence to 2j shillings; Popular Guides, general, with 
illustrations, in two editions, six pence, briefer, a penny; altogether 
3-1 publications, some of which are also called handbooks. In addi- 
tion, the museum has published labels such as those describing the sub- 
classes and orders of mammals (15 shillings). Families of Mammals 
(10'shilling6 pence), Families of Birds (10 shilling 6 pence). Families of 
Fishes (10 shilling 6 pence), Coleoptera (3 pence). Worms (six pence), 
and also maps showing geographical distribution (100 for six pence). 
This undertaking is deserving of much thanks, inasmuch as it saves the 
expense of printing to other museums; it is unfortunate that the German 
museums can make but little use of these labels, since they are partly 
printed in English. The Dresden collection, however, some time ago 
procured from them and installed the labels of bird families in Latin, 
printed in red. It has long been my desire to arrange for duplicates 
of the printed labels in the Dresden Museum for transmission to other 
collections so as to save them the trouble of preparation. The arrang- 
ing of labels for public exhibition requires much time, as they should 
})e brief, explicit, and complete. It is unfortunate that, up to the 
present time, every nmseum undertakes this vast labor of prepara- 
tion, instead of utilizing some of the work done by others. I know a 
(ierman museum that practically prohibits the copying of labels for 
use elsewhere. The English (regardless of the Manchester Museum) 
and the Americans have already begun to publish some of their 
printed labels."

644 REPORT OF l^ATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

The Manchester Museum of Owcn.s College is among the leading 
museums of England, and has apparently a great development before 
it. In this insufficiently lighted Gothic building, however, it will 
hardly develop fully. It is now an excellently arranged stud}" collec- 
tion, and in its present quarters can remain only such. 

This museum also is open daily from 11 a. m. to 5 p. m. (to students 
from 10 a. m. on) and on Sundays from 2.30 to 4.80 p.m., besides each 
first Wednesday of the month from 7 to 9 p. m. when it is lighted by 
electric arc lights reflected from the ceiling. It is closed only on 
Good Friday and on Christmas Eve. 

While no attention has been paid in the Museum building to venti- 
lation, a very notable method of ventilation has been installed in the 
new physical laboratory of Owens College," by which no air is admitted 
through the windows, but is brought in from the outside through 
tubes over an oil bed, which clears it of dust. This may be well 
thought out theoretically, but does not appear to hold good in prac- 
tice, and, besides, the windows do not close tightly, so that air carr^-^- 
ing dust and soot comes in through the crevices. These windows are 
also arranged for opening and are opened at times. The installation 
is therefore imperfect. There is, however, always a thick crust of 
dirt on the oil, the air passing through the tubes over it with force 
before it enters the room. I shall revert later on to the question of 
air cleansing. 

23. PEEL PARK MUSEUM IN SALFORD. 

Manchester is divided into two parts b}^ the river Irwell, the west- 
ern portion being called Salford, with its own separate incorporation. 
High above a park is a good sized museum building in the Kenaissance 
style, "for all," and a library (Ro3^al Museum and Libraries). This 
was established in l.S-lu and was extended in 1853, 1857, and 1878. 
The whole is so blackened and soiled with smoke that I was neces- 
sarily most unfavorably impressed. There are a number of hand- 
books for sale (Art, Mineralog3% Geolog3% 27 pp. ; Fine Arts Sec- 
tion: Marble Sculptures, Casts, Paintings, 32 pp.; Ethnography, 49 
pp.) and a Popular Guide (8 pp.)- All is done with the best inten- 
tions, but, owing to the lack of means, is of little avail. It is much more 
difficult in a manufacturing. and commercial city like Manchester than 
elsewhere to impress the people in authorit}'^ with the usefulness and 
value of good museums, so that they will grant the necessary funds for 
their maintenance.

24. VARIOUS ART MUSKUMS. 

WIIITWOKTII INSTITUTE. 

Tho Whitworth Institute is a luuseum of art and industry in Whit- 
worth Park. It contains a picture gaUery, a commercial museum, and 
the like. It is insufficiently lighted, but is not unattractive in its 
interior decorations. In the basement, engravinos, drawings, etc., are 
exhibited with excellent results by means of Lu.xfer ])risni window 
panes, the room l)eing lighted by a single row of windows. I have 
discussed this under New York (see p. 387), and have made an experi- 
ment with them in the Dresden Ethnographic Museum. This arrange- 
ment is also utilized to advantage in the Royal Armory in Berlin. 

MUNICIPAL SCHOOL OF ARTS. 
[Cavendish street. 1 

The Municipal School of Arts, established in 1842, has a small but 
verj^ tastefully arranged art collection, brought together in 1898 in a 
building erected by J. G. Sankey. The illumination from above is 
not, however, satisfactory. There are 1,300 pupils. 

CITY ART (iALLERY AND MANCHESTER ART MUSEUM. 

The City Art Gallery and the Manchester Art Museum, in Ancoats 
(a suburb), 1 could not visit. The museum lends framed pictures to 
elementary schools, generally in lots of 12 at a time, in every ca.se for 
ii half year. It possesses over 3,000 pictures for this purpose and sup- 
plies 92 schools, but is endeavoring to till also the wants of the remain- 
ing 215 elementary schools of Manchester. This nuiseum, under the 
direction of its founder, T. C. Horsfall, has a very far-reaching use- 
fulness. (See also T. C. Horsfall: The Use of Pictures in Education. 
Manchester, 1902. 13 pp.)" 

25. MANCHESTER MUNICIPAL TECHNICAL SCHOOL. ?> 

The Manchester T(M'hnical School is a very large and high structure, 
recently completed, of brick and terra cotta, with tasteful exterior, 
the main entrance in gra}' granite, designed by Messrs. Spalding and 
Cross, in free French renaissance st3ie of the time of Francis 1. It 
was erected at a cost of $750,0<l(», exclusive of the groiuid and furnish- 
ing. The building was begun in 1895. There are 5,500 evening 
pupils, 150 instructors, and 150 persons eniplo3^ed in other capacities. 
As a building it is very noteworthy. All of the rooms face the street,

and are ponsequently well lighted, while all corridor.s look out upon the 
courtyards. Its interior, treated primarily with regard to its useful- 
ness, is, nevertheless, decorated with the most marked artistic taste, 




and I note particularly the application of glazed bricks of a fine dark- 
brown color (Burniantoff's glazed bricks from the Leeds Fire Clay 
Company Limited, in Leeds), which are also employed at the base of the 
exterior of the building. In the P^nglish climate, which is mild as com- 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDKED INSTITUTIONS. 547 

pared with that of Germany, those glazed bricks stand exposure to 
the weather, and I believ^e that they would also stand our more 
vigorous winters, since thej^ are likewise used quite extensivel}^ in 
America, where the winters are even more severe than with us. On 
the interior brij^hter, light-colored olaz(^d bricks are used, but for 
economical reasons they do not extend the entire height of the 
rooms and corridors, the u})per portion being unglazed. The tire- 
places are made of Burmantoti's faience, supplied by the company 
already mentioned. Colored glazed bricks are used in Manchester 
and elsewhere in England to a considerable extent in monumental 
structures; at all events, uuu^h more than with us. In many cases 
exceedingly time effects are thus obtained, as in Manchester, for 
example, with the light-green and light-yellow brick from the Pilking- 
ton Company, in the building of the Tootal Broadhurst Lee Company 
(Limited), 56 Oxford street, and in some of the large new bank build- 
ings in the neighborhood of the town hall (National Provincial Bank 
of England, Merchantile Bank of Lancashire, both in York street, the 
latter furnished by the Malkin Company). I found these very attrac- 
tive when of uniform color, and there are also some that are really 
tasteful, in a simple manner ornamented with color. The technique of 
glazed brick has certainly progressed well in England. It is well to 
advise every architect who has a museum building to design to 
examine into these things. 1 obtained two illustrated catalogues and 
price lists from the following firms: The Malkin Tile AN^orks Com- 
pany (Limited), Patent Encaustic Tile Manufacturers, in Burslem, 
Staffordshire, 62 Market street, Manchester; and Pilkington's Tile 
and Pottery Company (Limited), Clifton Junction, near Manchester, 
37 Cross street, Manchester (these, in part, illustrated with some very 
artistic prints from drawings by Walter Crane, M. Mucha, J. K. 
Cooper, Lewis F. Day, John Chambers, C. F. A. Voysey, J. H. 
Rudd, and others). Another large factory is that of Doulton & Co. 
(Limited), Lam])eth, London. I believe these glazed bricks may be 
very well utilized in the interior decoration of a museum. In collec- 
tions, however, in which many objects nuist be hung on the walls, 
wooden appliances are needed, which are easily made. In the tech- 
nical school in Manchester very beautiful, not overdecorated colored 
glass windows are also employed. 

Of most decided importance is the method of ventilation employed 
in the new building of the technical school in Manchester. It is the 
same as referred to in my report on Chicago, see p. 484, and which 
rests upon the principle that oidy screened (washed and cleaned) 
air, permeated with steam and heated ad Uhituin^ is brought into the 
building (''plenum system"). This building is one of the few in 
Europe (some others will be mentioned in the course of this report) that 
has introduced this important method, the only proper and necessary 



548 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

one for imi.soiiiiis, and I deem it of the utmost importance that only 
this be employed in all new museum ])uildings. In the technical 
school, moreover, all the windows can be opened without any unclean 
air penetrating' from the outside, since the pressure of the air 
in the interior of the buildinj^- is always greater than that from with- 
out. I inspected the great shafts and ventilators (see tig. 88). It is 
here u})plied in a very elal)orate and expensive installation, such as is 
rcijuired for sanitar}" purposes in a largely attended school, but it 
is also to be reconuuended for museums and libraries for the same 
purposes, and esjiecially to preserve the collections from dust and 
other damage. In such an exceptionally smoky city as Manchester 
this installatiou is even of greater importance than elsewhere. 

The new technical school is in the first rank in every respect. The 
l)uilding cost the city $1,250,000. One of the highest American 
authorities on this subject (Edward Atkinson, in Boston, of whose 
labors I shall make mention in the continuation of my American 
Studies) recently referred to it in the following words:" 

I may add that I found in Manchester the most complete and well-devised build- 
ing for technical instruction in science, including special departments for the textile 
arts, that I have yet seen. 

Before the construction of this school a commission inspected the 
technical schools, institutions, and museums in Germany and Austria 
and published a report in 1897, in which, among other things, the 
following occurs (p. 16): 

There are not elsewhere in the whole world such splendid collections as are to be 
found in the British Museum and in South Kensington; but then you can hardly go 
into a continental, and certainly not into a German, town, even of minor importance, 
without finding a beautifully ordered and representative museum, suited to the needs 
of the city and its neighlxjrhocjd, and often not one merely, but another of a quite 
special character should circumstances require it. 

I believe, however, that in our German museums there is much 
that is capable of improvement. 

26. JOHN RYLANDS LIBRARY (DEANSGATE). 

The John Rylands Li))rary was donated to the city as a free library 
by Mrs. liylands in memory of her late husband, and opened in 1899. 
Built of red sandstone in the Gothic style, in 1890, by B. Champneys, 
it cost $1,500,000. It contains 70,000 volumes, valued at $1,250,000, 
including'' perhaps the ])est collection of incunabula in existence. It 
is the valuable library purchased by Mrs. Rylands in 1892 from the 
Count Spencer in Althorp, comprising the Althorp Li])rary, together 
with other treasures. The library has at its conmiand for the pur-

chase of books the sum of $24,000 annually, and from this fund the 
increase approximates 10,000 volumes yearly, but as the l)uildinit^ is so 
arranged that it can scarcely be extended, and as it is already filled, 
they hardly know how to meet this difficulty/' 

A more attractive building- is hardly imaginal)le, nor one less suited 
for a library, in which the readers must ])e supervised. Disregarding 
all the experiences gained by liliraries and all libi-arv princi[)ies, the 
architect, following the wish of Mrs. Rylands, designed a magnificent 
Gothic structure similar to the library of Mansfield College in Oxford. 
The entrance hall is a perfect forest of columns, uncommonly attractive 
artistically, but entirely useless, for the hall is so narrow and dark that 
it must be artificially lighted in the daytime.^ The entire building is in 
the style of a church, and, imposing as it appears in its main nave (23 
by 160 feet long, 50 feet high), in its side chapels, so to speak, or 
alcoves, in its galleries and transepts, it is so dark that at 3 o'clock in 
the afternoon in Septeml)er electric lights had to be turned on through- 
out. The books are not arranged in accordance with modern library 
methods, as one might expect, but in cases, the same as has been done 
from olden times, onl}" the reference library being directly accessible 
to the visitor. These cases, built of oak, with brass dooi- frames and 
plate glass, are delightful. Thej" close perfectly and are dust proof as 
long as the wood does not warp. Such an ideal and magnificent arrange- 
ment is certaiidy not to be found in many places; but, as I havealread}' 
remarked, the library is full, and, in view of the difficulty of adding to 
this building, it will in the course of time be necessar}' to abandon this 
elegant installation. The plate-glass doors of the cases are 10 feet high 
and 2 feet wide, and in the grooves are rolls of velvet with an 
inclosure of wool to make them dust proof. The librarian is of the 
opinion that in consequence of the complete air-tight closing of the 
cabinets, the majority of the costly books become moldy, and it is 
therefore necessar^^for him to ventilate the cases by leaving the doors 
open from time to time. I do not share his opinion'' and I believe, 

« F. J. Burgoyne, Library Construction, Arcliitectnre, Fitting?, and Furniture, 
London, 1897, p. 128, says, in the chaijter The Architectural History of the British 
Museum Library: The history of all lil^rary architecture is jiregnant with two 
especial morals — the need of building from the first upon some well-considered i)laii, 
so prepared as to admit of harmonious develoj)ment in the future, and the necessity 
of making extremely generous estimates in respect of space. Unless in the case of 
libraries devoted to special classes of books, or of branch libraries controlled from 
the parent institution, or of libraries where books no longer in general demand are 
systematically sold off, space, unless the most effectual measures have been taken at 
the very outset, nuist become the librarian's master. The architectural history of 
the British Museum is to a consiilerable extent a history of struggle against circum- 
stances created by neglect of these elementary princij)les.

moreover, that the l)ook,s mold because the building was occupied too 
soon and is not yet dry. Everywhere, even in the small workroom 
of the librarian, it smelled musty and gave the impression that the 

building is damp. I at- 
tribute the molding to 
this, and it may require 
3^ears before the building 
will be thoroughly dried 
out in the moist English 
climate. In addition, the 
cases are so built in that 
it is impossible to pro- 
vide air holes for them, 
but at all events it is 
important to definitely 
decide whether books 
are damaged in securely 
closed cabinets. 1 took 
occasion to incjuire about 
this in the Li bra r}^ Sainte 
Genevieve in Paris (see 
p. 594) Avhere 1 found 
the valua1)le incunabula, 
Aldines and P^lzevirs 
in cases, ])ut there the 
opinion is that the ])ooks 
are not injured by being- 
kept in this manner. The 
wooden cases, however, 
do not close so tightly, 
and the library is 50 years 
old; furth(U'more, Paris 
is not as moist as Man- 
chester, In the nuiseum 
under ni}" care we have 
had books since 1897 in 
air-tight iron cases, which 
give not the least indica- 
tion of damage up to the 
present time. A number 
of experienced librarians 
whom I have asked, state as their opinion that a book is not damaged 
])y being kept in an air-tight case unless the book be a freshly bound 
one, in which case it should be dried out for from one to two years 
before it is stored in this manner; yet, in the John Ry lands Library 




STUDIES ON MUSEtTMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 551 

tho very old bindings suffor in the same way. Books securely inclosed 
will not l)e more liable to damage than the stiitfed skins of animals, 
and though the latter are thoroughly poisoned, this is not the case 
with insect collections. At any rate, at the Dresden Museum, where 
the insect collection is installed in air-tight iron cabinets, no injury 
has been done to it up to this time. 

Still more interesting than this subject is that of the ventilation. 
The system installed is as in the technical school, so that on\y cleansed 
air is introduced into the building. Here the windows are arranged 
so that they can be opened; but too little pressure has been allowed for 
the incoming or outgoing air, and in consequence the rooms are stuffy. 
There appeared to be no remedy for this except to make casements or 
valves in the windows to let the air in from outside, and consequently 
the entire costly ventilating apparatus is rendered superfluous.'^' This 
difficulty could doubtless be remedied if the flues were altered, but 
only with great difficulty, since all of the tubes and shafts are so buried 
in the stone in the (xothic structure that it could not be accomplished 
without greath' damaging the entire building. As a result the ven- 
tilating arrangement was abandoned and unclean air is now admitted 
from the outside into this "jewel box," so that it will soon ])e damaged 
by smoke and soot, and the costly books with their precious old ])ind- 
ings will sufl'er. 

Hot- water heat is emplo3^ed, and the air which is forced in is strained 
through cotton. It is not, however, washed, though previously warmed 
as it passed over the hot pipes. An electric-light system throughout 
dispenses with the use of gas, which is so detrimental to ])ooks. 

The building is flreproof, constructed entirely of stone, and almost 
entirely vaulted. The floors have two fireproof layers with a space 
between, though covered with oak wood. So much wood has been 
introduced into the building itself, exclusive of the wooden cases, that 
a fire starting on the inside and not immediately detected might lead 
to the destruction of the valuable books. If the cases were of iron, 
even though the excellent American librar}" installation should not be 
adopted, and so much wood had not been utilized in the interior decora- 
tions for the purpose of increasing the testhetic effect, this danger 
would have been obviated. The location of the building in the center 
of the city, closely surrounded by houses, makes the danger still greater. 
The architect belonged to those who have foremost in their mind the 
building itself and not its purposes and contents. How justice can be 
done to the people and to the objects for which the building is designed, 
that is another question.'' 

One of the special features, besides the collection of 2,000 rare block- 
printed books and first impressions (nearl}^ all antedating 1480), is that

of the Bibles (said to be second only to the Bible collection of the Brit- 
ish Museum). Further, the collection of Aldines (over 800) is under- 
stood to be the most complete; and a collection of the earliest and 
rarest books relating" to America and the early explorations in general 
should be mentioned. It is used very little as a purely scientilic library 
in the great commercial city, and mostly by clerg-yiuen. It is open 
on week days from 10 a. m. to 6 p. m., Tuesdays and Fridays also from 
a. m. to 9 p. m., Saturdays only until 2 p. m., and is closed on Sun- 
days and on ten week days during the 3^ear. A 8-volume printed 
catalogue (1899) and various printed section catalogues have appeared. 
In England, as in America, organizations, societies, etc., are much 
more privileged than with us in visiting public institutions and in 
being shown through them. So it happened that on the da}" of my 
visit a societv of young men and women with religious tendencies 
called or was invited on Saturday afternoon at 8 o'clock, at a time 
when the librar}' is ordinarily closed. Several hundred persons pre- 
sented themselves. They assembled in the large, elegant, paneled lec- 
ture room, and the director made an address in which he explained to 
them something concerning the history and the contents of the library 
and instructed them in the use of the books. All that he could say, 
however, in this connection was that, since the library was a scientific 
one, they would iind help and encouragement for their religious 
interests only in the large collection of Bibles, and he advised them 
to use this section. The society was then permitted to wander at 
will about the large library. The visitors were attended by the 
director and other officials, and the noteworth}" and valuable things 
were pointed out. All parts of the building were well lighted with 
electricity. This has assuredly the advantage of broadening the 
horizon of a class of people who have no conception of such a magnifi- 
cent installation as a good library, and of inspiring one or another of 
them to go into the subject more profoundly. 

27. P^REE REFERENCE LIBRARY. 

There were in Manchester also many other things to learn and to 
report upon,*^' but ni}" time was limited and the sojourn in this factor^' 
town but little pleasing. 

So I did not visit the Free Reference Lil^rary in King street, 
which has been housed since 1878 in the old town hall (constructed 
in 1823-1825), which contains 124:,591 volumes, and in which during 
the last year 360,176 readers have consulted 4-1:1,074 volumes. The 
city would long ago have undertaken the establishment of a new 
up-to-date librar}', since ever3"thing is overcrowded, were it not for the 
fact that a debt of $25,000,000 was assumed in the construction of the

ship canal between Manchester and Liverpool, besides large expendi- 
tures for electric light and trams. F. J. Burgo3'ne" says: 

It is strange that the town which was the first in Britain to obtain parliamentary 
powers to establish a public library should be content with a makeshift building as 
a home for its splendid collection of books * * * ]\Ianchester has lagged behind 

I* * * 

This library has five branch reading rooms and distributes at thir- 
teen places in the city books for reading at home.''' It has altogether 
292,167 volumes, which were used in the aggregate during the last year 
2,181,596 times, a dailj' average of 6,128. There were taken home 
1,022,511 books by -16,456 persons provided with cards, and 657,121 
in the boj's' rooms, five-sixths of whom were Sunda}' visitors. Since 
the number of readers in the newspaper rooms aggregate 4,117,681, we 
arrive at a total annual patronage of 6,138,996 persons. Even if we 
omit the 4,000,000 newspaper readers, there still remains a formid- 
able num))er, and the proper administration of all this is certainl}^ a 
remarkable performance. The annual expenditure by the city for the 
library amounts to $108,000, of which $44,000 are allotted to salaries 
and $25,000 for l:)Ooks and periodicals.'" We nuist not overlook the 
fact that in the large number of books used as stated, of the 1,022,511 
lent for home reading, 841,198 related to fiction, of which there are 
62,915 volumes. In this respect all these libraries serve the same pur- 
pose as our German private circulating libraries, except that with us 
a fee must be paid, whereas with them the service is free of charge 
(compare also with the above what I have said in connection 
witli the Chicago Public Library). In the Jieference Librar}-, on 
the other hand, there is no fiction, but only books on theology, 
philosoph}^ (9,638 volumes), history, biography, travels (29,685), 
politics and trade (21,503), arts and sciences (22,422), literature 
(31,133), and patents (7,064). The consultation of 441,074 books by 
360,176 readers in the last 3"ear is, as already stated, not only note- 
worthy from a technical library standpoint, l)ut it may also l)e taken 
for granted that it has an influence on the education of the people of 
the city. At an}- event, nowhere with us in German}' are so man}" 
good books read b}" the people. The library has a printed catalogue 
and publishes periodical lists of its acquisitions. The "Manchester 
Public Free Libraries'' were established in 1852.'' Of the other 
libraries of Manchester may also be mentioned the Portico Library, 
with 80,000 volumes (English literature, English topography, books of 
the eighteenth century). All in all, the public libraries of Manchester 
comprise 800,000 volumes.

IX.— EDINBURGH. 

Edinburcrh, a city with more than 300,000 inhabitants, is a paradise 
in comparison with Manchester, but is itself more or less begrimed in 
consequence of the location of the great railway station in the center 
of the city. Were it not for this, Edinburgh, on account of its pictur- 
esque location, would perhaps rival the finest cities of the world. 
The toAvn has only a few factories.

The University of Edinburgh, with over 2,800 students and 170 
instructors," is located in a stately building erected at the close of the 
eighteenth century. A dome has since been added (Plate 38). The

library, at the loft, with 210,000 volumes, has an antiquated installation, 
Imt the main hall makes a magnificent impression. All of the public 
buildings of Edinburgh are conspicuous for their massiveness and 
strength. In this respect the students' clubhouse and the music school 
in the group of the newer university buildings (fig. 90) are noteworthy, 
and especially among these the Aula (McEwan Hall), which cost 
$.5.50,000, is one of the largest and finest buildings of the kind that 1 
know.'' The new university buildings are al)out ten minutes distant 
from the old university, adjoining the school of medicine, opened 
in 1844.

ANATOMICAL MITSEUM. 



I could not inspect everything, and the Museum of Comparative 
Anatomy, under Sir William Turner, possessed most that was to my 
interest to visit. In 172(1 Alexander Munro, then onh^ 22 years old, 
was professor of anatomy here; his son, Alexander Munro 2d, occupied 
the same position for fifty years, and Munro 3d until 1846. He was 
succeeded by John Goodsir, and tiie latter in 1S07 by A\'. Turner, all 
anatomists of world-wide reputation. The collection was founded Iw 
Munro 2d, and is unusually valuable. Turner, with R. Rowland 
Anderson, the architect of the entire School of Medicine, planned the 
new museum in 1876. It was designed and executed after the pattern

of the Roj^al College of Surgeons in London (see p. 528), and was com- 
pleted in 1885. It cost $57,000, and. in addition, its interior installation 
(cases, etc.), cost $42,000. It comprises a large hall, without colunuis, 
provided with a skylight, and two galleries, one above the other (tig. 
91), its interior dimensions being approximately 37 meters long, 13 
wide, and 14 high. The stairs to the galleries, one fligiit at each end, 
are narrow and steep, as in the Royal College of Surgeons in London; 
they are used only by students, for the great public visits the nmseura 
Imt little. The skylight consists of a horizontal layer of frosted glas.s 
panes, and above this a glass roof with a grating along thc^ middle and 
inclined sides. The space between these two sets of windows is so 



556 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

high that one can walk upright in it to clean the glass. The construc- 
tion of this hall indicates in one respect an essential advance over the 
halls of the RoA^al College of Surgeons in London, which as alread}' 
stated are too dark. Windows here are inserted on the ground floor, 
so that the galleries do not shade the hall below, as in London. The 
upper galler}" has, besides, a floor of hammered glass. This scheme 
of supplemental side lighting is A^er}^ essential where there are 
skjdights, but is in no way to T)e preferred to the lighting of 
large halls from two long sides, as it has many disadvantages. For 
instance, the reflections of the sk3dight on the desk cases along the 
rail of the galleries is verj^ annoying, as is true ever3^where in 
similar structures (Hamburg, London, etc.). The cases on the 
galleries are shallow wall cases, and those of the hall itself are 
mostly free-standing ones, at right angles to the window piers. These 
are consequently excellenth^ lighted, while, on the contrary, the wall 
cases on the narrow sides of the hall are dark. Though the superb 
mahogany cases, with plate glass, are on the whole very impressive 
when one enters the large hall, they do not, with their massive 
framework, answer to strict modern requirements. Furthermore, 
they do not close tightly, and the collection, therefore, must be cleaned 
yearly throughout. There are horizontal cases near the windows. 
The shelves in the cases are of plate glass or of iron lattice-work, 
which is less attractive. The museum contains on the main floor 
comparative-anatomy preparations. The upper gallery is devoted to 
pathology, as in the Koyal College of Surgeons in London. Doors 
lead from the galleries into the several departments of the medical 
school. The floor of the hall is on the level with the adjoining labo- 
ratories, preparators' quarters, the dissecting room, and lecture hall. 
Everything is excellent and spacious. The ample space between the 
cases, from the floor to the roof, is occupied by a rich collection of 
whale skeletons, making a striking picture. They are suspended by 
chains, which appear less massive than the iron rods emplo3'ed in the 
Koyal College of Surgeons in London. 

At one end of the great hall there is a room aljout 23 feet long, IG 
feet broad, and 20 feet high, with a gallery for the excellent series of 
racial skulls; among them, for example, over 70 Australian skulls. 
This collection rivals in importance that of the Roj^al College of Sur- 
geons in London. There is also an old phrenological collection, phre- 
nology having been zealously cultivated in Edinlnirgh at the time of Gall. 

In general, this museum, on account of the limited force of em- 
ploj^ees, as occurs in many English museums, is not sufficiently cared 
for or labeled. It ranks, however, among the best in the world, and 
Sir William Turner has made a worthy monument for himself." 

« Recently (190.S) Sir William Turner has been elected principal of the Universitj', 
and Prof. D. J. Cunningham of Dublin has become his successor.

29. MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND ART. 

The Museum of Science and Art (since 19()4 the Royal Scottish 
Museum), which from its size and variet}' might properly have been 
mentioned before the Anatomical Museum, is an old one. It was 
founded toward the close of the seventeenth century, when the 
renowned naturalists, Andrew Balfour and Robert Sibbald, laid its 
foundation, Sil)bald printed, as early as 1697, a catalogue of the col- 
lection of minerals, stones, metals, vegetable products, animals, art 
objects, manuscripts, and books. In 1854 the present location was 
purchased for $35,000. In 1861 the new, stately building was begun 
after plans by Fowke. In 1866 the first portion, in 1875 the second 
portion, and in 1888 the last portion, was completed. It is the National 
^luseum of Scotland, is supported by the state (Scottish Education 
Department), and is free of access to the university professors for

purposes of instruction. The building immediately adjoins the new 
university, and opposite stands Heriot-Watt College, an institute for 
instruction in technology, natural science, and art. Now (since 1900) 
F. (irant Ogilvie is the director of the whole," and R. II. Traquair 
(since 1873) the curator of the natund science department. There are 
30 othcials on its roster. In the manner of the South Kensington 
Museum, in London, it combines art, industry, and technologv, and in 
addition, the entire natural sciences, making a grand whole. It is 
divided into the following departments: 

1. Decorative art: Specimens of ancii^nt, classic, medireval, and 
renaissance sculptures, especialh" as applied to architecture; the indus- 

« Recently (1903) ]\Ir. Ogilvie became principal assistant secretary of the board of 
education in Loudon, and was succeeded by Prof. J. J. Dobbie as director in 
Edinburgh.

The museum is free on five days of the week from 10 a. m. to •! 
p. m., Saturdays from 10 a, m to 10 p. m., Wednesdays also from to 
10 p. m., Sundays from 2 to 5 p. m., on which account a large portion 
of the collection must nat- 
urally suffer. The build- 
ing consists of a spacious 
hall with skylight and two 
galleries — one above the 
other (figs. 95 and 96) and 
with ten large adjoining 
rooms partially supplied 
with sk3'lights and galler- 
ies. It measures in ex- 
terior 133 feet long and 
206 feet wide, and has 
122,000 square feet of ex- 
hibition floor space. It is 
in some parts insufhcientlj' 
lighted and has the defects 
of similar buildings. The 

cases are of wood with clumsy framework, and are black. To make 
them dust proof , velvet strips have been placed between the frames 
and the doors, but without grooves, and then the doors are screwed on 
to the outer framework; besides being locked up at several places.

To open them, one must get a ladder, and then with a screw-driver 
unscrew them in several places. No attention is paid to this incon- 
venience, however, since they are not accustomed to an3'thint«- hotter, 
and they even regard this metliod of installation as an ad\ance on that 
of other museums, since 
it prevents the warping 
of the wooden framework 
and makes the cases dust 
proof, which it evidently 
does Avhen the frames are 
screwed on. Notwith- 
standing all this, the cases 
and doors are quite small. 
Three hundred and fifty 
running feet of such cases 
were completed and in- 
stalled in 1899 alone. 

The labeling of the De- 
partment of Art and In- 
dustry is after the pattern 
of that of the South Kensington Museum. In the great Natural His- 
tory Department, which is by no means insignificant and which fills 
four great skylighted halls and six galleries (3 series of two galleries, 
one above the other), I did not notice any features deviating from the 

customary ones. Through- 
out the museum there is 
by far too much exhibited 
for the great public, and, 
in consequence, this not 
only tires the visitor, but 
the exhibits are damaged 
seriously b}' being con- 
stantly exposed to the 
light. This matter is sufii- 
ciently considered in but 
few nuiseums of the world. 
But I can not properly 
do justice to these large 
and extensive collections 
in a brief space. I found 
nothing that was directly worth imitating or particularly useful in 
planning for a new structure. The ventilation was primitive and the 
building was not adequatel}^ fireproof. 

A not unimportant ethnographic collection of over 10,000 speci- 
mens is remarkable, with more than one valuable old specimen; Benin

560 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 190.']. 

bronzes, too, are represented. The order and labeling was not satis- 
factory, but a new installation was just going on. 

The museum eontains also loan collections from the South Kensing- 
ton Museum in London. It was visited in 1901 by 375,179 persons, 
half of whom attended during the evening." The opening of the 
museum on Sundays begun only with April 1, 1901, and, on account 
of its departure from custom, aroused much opposition; but Sunday 
opening has since been introduced in Glasgow. The average attend- 
ance on Sunday's up to the present time has been 1,297 persons'* (in 
London. .s,.500; in Dublin, 5,000, in the corresponding nmseums). In 
1897-98 the aimual expenditure exceeded $75,000. 

30. NATIONAL MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES. 

The National Museum of Antiquities was founded in 1780 and has 
belonged to the nation since 1851. The new building, by R. Rowland 
Anderson, costing $250,000 and very notable and attractive in its 
exterior, was completed in 1890 and was a gift from John Ritchie 
Findlay. It is in the comparatively broad Queen street, in close prox- 
imit}^ to other houses. It is built in the Gothic style, not adapted for 
housing collections, and in parts is insufficiently lighted. The director, 
Dr. Joseph Anderson, himself regrets this, as well as the man}^ other 
defects of the building. I mention it only for the purpose of call- 
ing attention to the fact that museum buildings are almost universally 
badly planned, because the architects do not seek, as they should, the 
advice of experts. Unfortunately there are but few experts in such 
matters. 

The building is of brick, which is treated on the interior somewhat 
too roughly to be attractive. Light is obtained from both long sides, 
but the Gothic windows admit too little. It is fireproof; without 
proper ventilation; and heated by steam. The collection of antiquities 
occupies the right wing of the building; the left contains the national 
portrait gallery and a collection of casts and other objects relating 
to art. The center of the building is occupied b}^ a large entrance 
hall (with paintings), which takes up much room. The Museum of 
Antiquities consists of a very comprehensive, valuable, and attractive 
prehistoric and historic local (Scotch) collection, excellently arranged 
in chronological order. The upright and horizontal cases are primi- 
tive. The interior furniture cost $20,000. There is a considerable 
library in a hall, lighted from above; also a small ethnographic collec- 
tion, with valuable objects from the South Seas, some of which are old. 
The building is open daily from 10 to 4; on two days of the week 

« During 1902 there were 441,370 visitors, 148,796 of whom came during the even- 
ing. 

& During 1902; 1,501, together with 78,027; 1,165 on week days— together, 214,547.

there is an admission fee of six pence; it is closed -on Mondays. The 
numlier of visitors yearl}^ is about 20,000. A most excellent hand- 
book is the catalogue of the National Museum of Antiquities of Scot- 
land, 18!»2 (1 shilling), 380 pages, 752 illustrations. An annual report 
is pu))lishcd in the Proceedings of the Socict}' of Antiquities of 
Scotland. The museum has not sufficient means at its disposal. 




Fig. 97. — National Museum of Antiquities, Edinburgh, Seotland. 

31. VARIOUS OTHER MUSEUMS. 

I mention, in addition, the National Gallery, with a considerable col- 
lection of paintings, poorl}^ lighted from above; the Ro^-al Institution, 
with a collection of casts; the City Museum; the Fine Art Museum, in 
the university; and the Museum of the Ro3^al College of Surgeons. 
These establishments, excepting the first named, I omitted to visit, for 
I was told that they were not important and, moreover, other sights 
of interest in Edinburgh completely occupied my time. I beg to 
mention in closing, however, the magnificent Botanical Garden, with 
its spliMidid conservatories, containing, among other things, a col- 
lection of pitcher-plants (Nepenthaceaj), of surprising beauty and 
abundance. 

The administration of the Edinburgh museums will undoubtedly 
receive a great impulse from the gift of Andrew Carnegie (born in 
Scotland in 1837 and emigrated in 1848, with his family, to America), 
who donated 110,000,000 to the Scotch universities (as a first install- 
ment) for the ''advancement of education,'" a portion of which dona-

tiou may be devoted to the promotion of scientitic research through 
the establishment and equipment of museums." 

X.— GLASGOW. 

Glasgow is a seaport and manufacturing city, with upward of 
1,000,000 inhaliitants. Its street life is imposing; it is not so begrimed 
as Manchester, but still it is smoky to a very considerable extent. In 
Kelvingrove Park stands the great university building erected in 1870, 
by G. G. Scott, at a cost of $2,500,000 (the university was founded in 
1451), in the early English style with later Scotch-Flemish features. 
The building is 590 feet long and 321 feet wide, with a tower 328 
feet high.. The library contains 180,000 volumes, and tliere are 2,500 
students and 00 instructors. The annual expenditure for the univer- 
sity is $300,000. Inasmuch as 1 was informed that its collections are 
not very noteworth3', I did not inspect them, especially since the 
international exhibition in the same park fully occupied my time. 
My chief interest lay in the entirely new Museum of Art and Science, 
opened in 1901, and temporarily occupied by parts of the exhibition. 

32. CORPORATION MUSEUMS AND ART GALL?:RIES. ^' 

During the exhibition the building contained mostly loan collections, 
but at its close the not uniniporttuit gallery of paintings, the Corpora- 
tion Art Industrial Museum, and the Natural Histoiy Museum were 
installed there.'' This natural-history collection at the time of my 

« Andrew Carnegie earned at the age of 12 years $1.25 a week as spooler in a cotton 
factory; then he became fireman in a factory; then telegraph messenger; in his fif- 
teenth year a telegrapli operator, with a salary of |25 a month. At the age of 20 he 
became secretary to the director of a large railway; at 25, a snperintendent of mili- 
tary telegraphy of the Federal Govermnent; at 28, the owner of an oil well; at 30, 
a builder of iron Ijridges; at 45, the "steel king." It is said that he possesses a for- 
tune of $300,000,000, but has determined to give away his entire property in order 
to die "poor." He spends his summer in Skibo, Scotland. (See further mention of 
Mr. Carnegie and his gifts on previous pages.) 

''It is noticed that it is intended to change the name to Art Palace. We also find 
it styled in various ways — as. Corporation Art < Jallery and Museums, New Art (ial- 
leries and Museum, Corporation of Glasgow, Museums and Art Galleries, Glasgow 
Art Gallery and Museum (Kelvingrove), Corporation Cialleries, etc. The former 
Kelvingrove Museum had the following divisions: Fine-art section, ethnographical 
section, archeological section, technological section, local-history section, natural- 
history section, and book section. 

''I have indicated on the plan of the ground floor (fig. 98) the present distribu- 
tion of the collections. In the second story there are only paintings and art objects 
(see Tin' Mu)<ewns Journal, I, 1902, p. 317). The director expresses his regret (on 
page 324) that the natural sciences are not properly cared for, the very limited 
space affortling no opportunity for a strictly systematic arrangement and l)eing cut 
up too nuich. It is certainly unfortunate that in an entirely new building these 
difficulties must already be encountered.

vi.sit was, for the purpose of preparation, partly stored in the cellar of 
the new museum, so that I saw little or nothino- of it. Earlier years 
are covered by the Annual Reports: Corporation of Glasgow (parks 




department); museums and o-alleries. For example, r(^i)()rt for the 
year 1899, 16 pages. The Natural History Museum was visited in 1899 
by 232,000 persons.

The director of the whole Is now J. Paton and the curator of nat-

tion an entomologist is employed as an assistant. The superintendent 




of the building, who gave me the most detailed information concern- 
ing the new structure, and to whom I am therefore particularly 
indebted, is H. Cornish. 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 565 

The new buildiucr (Plate 39), by J. W. Simpson and E. 1. M. 
Allen (of London), ))egun in 1893, is decidedly cunihrons" though 
effective in its exterior. In the interior it is also ricld\' decorated, 
but not too much for its purpose. It is of red sandstone in the 
French Renaissance st\de, and is fireproof. The chief artistic decora- 
tion is b}' G. Frampton. Sir Walter Armstrong, director of the 
National Galler}^ in Dublin, sharply criticised* the selection of red sand- 
stone instead of white, since the red stone, on account of the smoki- 
ness of Glasgow, will soon become completely 1)lack. The architect 
of the John Rj^lands Librar}^ in Manchester (see p. 5i8), on the con- 
trary, maintains that the red sandstone withstands the effects of the 
smoke better than the white stone. I believe that the difference, if 
any, is scarcely perceptible. It would be a blessing if all of these cities 
were less smoky. The l)uilding is approximatel v -192 feet long and 164 
to 278 feet wide. It has a stateh^ main hall with galleries 137 feet long, 
62 feet wide, and 88 feet high, of cream-colored sandstone; and two 
lateral halls with skylight and galleries 110 by 65 feet. The six lateral 
and intersecting halls of the ground floor are lighted from the side; 
the six of the second story from skylights. The}^ are (approximately) 
110 feet long and 30 feet wide; those of the second story occupied by 
the art gallery, in the opinion of Sir Walter Armstrong (see above), 
are too low. There are four corner pavilions in e;uch story, the upper 
ones with skylights, making the ground plan quite diversified. Six 
stairways lead to the second stor}-. Above the southern front hall 
there is another large hall in the third stor3\ The lighting arrange- 
ments are good, with brilliant electric illumination in the evenings. 
The man}' towers, some of which are 186 feet high, are useless, and 
constitute a very questionable ornamentation to the building, since it 
lacks repose. The proceeds of the Glasgow Exhi))ition of 1888 (nearly 
$250,000) was the basis of the funds from which t\w cost of the build- 
ing was defrayed. To this were added voluntary donations (almost 
$375,000), and this sum not being deemed sufficient, the city under- 
took the construction of the l>uilding, which cost over $1,250,000. 
The proceeds of the Exhibition of 1901 ($500,000) will be devoted to 
the purchase of pictures. 

I would have little reason to dwell longer on this new nmseum, 
which is only a more or less slight departure from the usual pattern, *" 

" l^late 39 was taken dnriiij; the Exposition, for which reason we see various kiosks, 
paviUons, etc., which do not helong to it. 

I> Scots Pictorial, June 15, 1901, p. ISl. 

<^Sir Walter Armstrong characterizes the ground floor of the buildiui: "more suc- 
cessful than anything else of the same kind in Europe." I grant that it i.s magnifi- 
cent, but I doubt if it deserves so great a commendation. He remarks at- the i-lose 
of his paper: The Glasgow Gallery is incontestal)ly the finest in Europe outside the 
great capitals, and the director, J. Paton (the Museums Jounial, January, 1902, 
p. 315), goes so far as to say: (ilasgow can boast of having the most handsome and 
architecturally ornate museum building of any jjrovincial town in the United King- 
dom if not in the whole world.

were it not for the fact that it has one arrangement which in museum 
buildino-s marks an advance of the fi^reatest importance, namely, that 
for ventilation. It is like that described al)ove in the technical school 
and the Ry lands Library in Manchester, and which 1 also observed in

American libraries. Here in (xlaso^ow, however, the scheme has first 
been applied within my knowledge for museum purposes, at the same 
time as we shall see with that of the museum in Liverpool. I mark, 
with the erection of this building, a new epoch in the history of

museum construction, for it is of tho most vital importance tlmt in the 
future none shall be built in which provision is not made for the intro- 
duction of entirely clean air. The atmosphere outside, laden with 
dust and other injurious sul)stances, depreciates every collection in 
every possible way, and now 
that we have found a means 

to obviate this, this means j 

should be emplo3^ed. The in- j 

stallation of Acntilating sys- 1 

tems in Glasgow is on a large £ 

scale and I had an opportu- I 

nity to witness its satisfactory' £ 

operation. It is a serious ques- I 

tion in this connection whether S 

it is necessar}" to keep the win- ^ 

dows completely secured, so c 

that the}' can not be opened, ? 

as thej" are here, or whether I 

such an arrangement should i 

be adopted as in the technical '^ 

school in Manchester, which | 

permits of their being opened, < 

under the condition, however, g 

that the pressure of the air on i 

the inside is alwaj's greater " 

than that from without. This ^ 

is an indispensable prerequi- ^ 

site. This question is impor- E 

tant since the cleaning of se- ; 

curely closed windows from = 

the outside presents great diffi- l 

culties. In the Congressional ~ 

Library in ^^'ashington verj- = 

light, exterior iron galleries = 

are employed, from which the 2 

windows may be cleaned. An- ^ 

other, though more expensive, I 

arrangement would consist in i 

letting the windows revolve I 
about a vertical central axis 
and screw the frames on so 
that the}' are with not too great difficult}' accessible for cleaning from 
the inside. I believe this latter method is the better, for I fear that 

it would be hard to maintain at all times a higher pressure of air 
inside than outside. 

In the art school of Glasgow this method of ventilation has also

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 



been installed with securely closed windows. It will, however, be 
disctii'ded, since in modeling so much dust is stirred up inside that 
it is thought that the dust from without could not be objectionable. 

I should not think it 
proper, however, to 
discard the system 
merely for this reason. 
The installation of 
the ventilating appa- 
ratus is shown in figs. 
100-102. It cost $40,- 
000, without taking 
into account the ma- 
sons' work on the boil- 
ers and stacks, and was 
set up by the Sturte- 
vant Engineering Com- 
pany (Limited) from 
designs by Engineer 
Thomas Young, of 
Glasgow, based on the 
plenum system. A de- 
tailed description of 
the diagrams shown in 
the illustration may be 
found in The Engineer 
of September 20, 1901, 
p. 312. The outer air 
is drawn in at the top 
of a large tower, 10 
by 6i feet in cross sec- 
tion, filtered, washed, 
w a r m e d , and then 
forced into the rooms 
by means of electric 
fans. These fans make 
120 revolutions a min- 
ute and convey 5,000,- 
000 cubic feet of air 
an hour into the build- 
ing. The air that has 
been used is drawn out through conduits near the floor, which lead 
out above the roof. The entire arrjuigemeut has proved most satis- 
factory up to the present time."

years' experience, and Mr. Cornish favored me with the following reply, dated

33. TECHNICAL COLLEGE; MITCHELL LIBRARY. 

The great city of (Tlasgow, which enjoys the best government of 
any of the cities of the Island Kingdom, would certainly, on closer 
study, have offered many other things worthy of examination in rela- 
tion to museum matters, Init my time was too limited. 

1 shall mention, in addition, the Glasgow and West of Scotland 
Technical College, founded in 1886, with an annual expenditure of 
$100,000, (>00 day and 4,000 evening pupils, (JT instructors, and a 
library of 15,000 volumes; also the Mitchell Library, established in 
1877, with an endowment of $350,000 by Stephen Mitchell, an annual 
expenditure of $16,500, and 145,000 volumes. There are probabl}- 
500,000 volumes annually consulted, for the librar}?^ allows no books to 
be carried away. The daily attendance is approximately 2,000. To 
prevent a conflagration from flying sparks tubes are laid upon the 
roof with small apertures through which, upon the opening of a cock 
in the cellar, sufficient water flows to extinguish any fire. This is an 
arrangement very worthy of imitation. (See, concerning this excel- 
lent library, J. J. Ogle, The Free Library, 1897, pp. 288-293; and 
F. eT. Burgoyne, Library Construction, 1897, pp. 162-166.) 

XL— LIVERPOOL. 

Liverpool is a seaport and manufacturing town of nearly 700,000 
inha])itants; somewhat hilly, and notas highly smoked upas Manchester, 
but also black. For this reason the good efl'ect of the ver}' impressive 
principal square is injured. It is similar to the forum of a Roman 
city, with St. George's Hall, a building like a Greco-Roman temple, 
650 feet long and 200 feet wide, for public assemblages, concerts, etc., 
built in 1838-1854, at a cost of $1,500,000; a row of monuments, and 
a long, extending group of museum buildings in the Greek style. 
Outside of these Liverpool possesses very little of talue for my pur- 
poses. It has a university college, which is a portion of Victoria 
University, as mentioned j)reviousl_v (see paragraph on Owens College, 
in Manchester), with from 500 to 600 students and over loo instructors. 
There is also an observatory. 

Glasgow, November 24, 1903: I am glad to say the heating and ventilation is giving 
very good results and I do not think one can at present get a better or cheaper 
system to do the work required. One alteration I have made is that in place of 
washing the air at the screens I have put up scrim screens and filter the air through 
the cloth and so do away with the water, which was causing dampness in the buildings 
and doing harm to the old paintings and other ol)jects. When one considers that 
our large buildings can l)e kept at about 60" in the winter months by a daily supply 
of 7 tons of washed pearls 'screened dross,' costing at present 7s. Id. per ton, you 
will see that the system used is cheap as well as efficient. I may say the floor space 
of our building is as follows: Picture galleries, 21,450 .square feet; nmseuni galleries, 
21,330 square feet; central hall, courts, and corridors, which are marble, 45,000 square 
feet; grand total of floor space, 87,786 square feet.

84. LIBRARY, MUSEUM, AND ART COMMITTEE. 

The collection of buildings of the museums of art and science are 
maintained by the city at an expense of $200,000 and are administered 
under the "Library, museum, and art committee." They comprise 
the following- departments: (1) An art museum (Walker Fine Art Gal- 
lery), built in 1877, on the ground floor of which are plastic reproduc- 
tions, on the second floor paintings, excellent!}' lighted and pleasantly set 
off by tapestries and plants, so that a sojourn there is highly agreeable. 
(2) A library (Picton Reading Room) of 122,000 volumes exclusive of 
pamphlets, a reference library, principally contained in a great round 
building. (3) The main structure, called the "Free Public Library 
and Museums," a library of 95,000 volumes, with five branches in the 
city, for lending books, with reading and periodical rooms into which 
people pour from the streets, " and a museum of natural science, arche- 
ology, ethnography, industrial arts, and art (independent of those 
branches of art which the Walker Fine Art Gallery cultivates), known 
as the "Free Public Museums.'" In the lower stories of this nuiseum 
building is located the new technical school. 

35. FREE PUBLIC MUSEUMS. 

The Free Public Museums are open on five week days from 10 a. m. 
to 4 or 6 p. m., and in the winter, on Monday evenings, from 7 to 10 
p. m. In 1899, on 262 days, there were over 300,000 visitors; in 1898, 
on 264 days, over 350,000. At 12 public lectures on Mondav even- 

« I did not carefnlh' inspect these libraries, founded in 1852, since their arrange- 
ments are not modern. Their sphere of action, however, is great. The totals for 
1900 are as follows: 666,207 books and 728,128 periodicals were read in the library; 
612,386 persons visited the newspaper rooms, and 58,929 the 116 public lectures; 
819,317 books were carried home by 22,244 persons ("for the most part they belong 
to the working classes, and to persons of education but of very limited means"), of 
which, however, 643,842 were fiction and 132,535 were children's books. Altliough 
I particularly mention the fiction included in this total, I do not wish to depreciate 
the value of such books, for after the day's work thereare few recreations so refreshing, 
delightful, and even instructive to the thoughtful reader as is fiction, while we should 
not overlook the fact also that the pul)lic liliraries do not purchase any bad novels. 
In the Picton Reading Room alone, where no fiction is given out, 246,533 books were 
read, of which there were, for example, 41,863 technical, 49,748 collected writings, 
essays, etc., and 22,145 historical and biographical. The library possesses 15,913 tech- 
nical, 29,042 collected writings, essays, etc., 14,595 historical and biographical works. 
(Forty-eighth Annual Report Public Libraries, etc., Liverjwol, 1901, pp. 5-31; see also 
J. J. Ogle, The Free Library, 1897, pp. 165-173, and F. J. Burgoyne, Library Construc- 
tion, 1897, pp. 167-170. ) It is open on week days from 10 a. m. to 10 p. m. (Fridays 
from 10 a. m. to 2. p. m.). The annual expenditures are $100,000, half of which is 
expended for books, periodicals, and newspapers. Alxiut 80 persons are employed. 
The reference department has a catalogue in three volumes in quarto, 2,066 pages. 
In Germany we are very backward in this respect, though we far excel the English 
in the busy life at our hedge taverns.

ings, from January to March in 1900, there were 760 auditors, in 1899 
at 21 lectures, 2,470. The museum consists of two great collections: 
The Derby Museum of Zoology, Botany, (xeology, Mineralog}^ (also 
an aquarium), which has as its nucleus the mammal and bird collec- 
tion of the thirteenth Earl of Derby, who presented it to the city 
in 1851; and the Mayer Museum, covering the other departments 
mentioned. Joseph Mayer was a rich goldsmith of Liverpool, who 
in 1867 presented to the city his most valuable collection, consisting 
especially of pottery, Assyrian, Baljylonian, P^gyptian, Greek, and 
medifeval antiquities and manuscripts. I mention as most noteworthy 
the carved ivories, the collection of Anglo-Saxon antiquities, the 
Mexican Codex, ^' the miniatures, and the great Wedgwood and old

Liverpool ceramic collection. In 1860 Sir William Brown presented 
the present ])uilding to the city. At the end of 1897, the space having 
become too limited, a great wing was added (fig. 103), containing two 
floors (figs. 106 and 107), each with a single connecting room 36 
feet wide, undivided, horseshoe-shaped, 460 feet long, surrounding 
a courtyard. The lower floor, 20 feet high, is lighted on both sides; 
the upper, 30 feet high, with a skylight. As fig. 103 shows, the land

the Natural History Museum is the third of ttie building, since the 
three ])clow that (the basement, ground floor, and second floor) 
belong to the new Technical School, which is entirely separated 
from it and has its own entrance. The lower floor of the Natural 
History Museum (the third in the new wing) is, however, on a level 
with the ground floor of the old nniseum, with which it makes 
a complete whole (flg. 108). The height of the new wing is 100 feet 
above the street level. It is hard stone, constructed by E. W. Mount- 
ford, in the ''modern classic style of the nineteenth century;''' it is 206 
feet long and 177 feet wide, and has an area of 8,000 sc^uare yards. 
Between the seven windows of the lower museum stor}^ on the rounded 
portion are pairs of Ionic columns 83 feet high. Also, high up above 
the upper story of the nmseum are additional rooms for the Technical 
School, namely, a chemical laboratory and an observator3^ The 
school has 1,300 students. The entire new building cost $675,000, of 
which $375,000 falls upon the museum. The new large rooms are com- 
pleted (flgs. 100 and 107), and, being excellently lighted and spacious, 
the museum will, next to that of London, l)e the most comprehensive, 
and in all respects one of the l)est in (xreat Britain.'^ The lighting of 
the gallery on both sides, 36 feet wide, is faultless, and the only method 
suitable for a natural-history museum, since in that way wall cases 
placed opposite the light are avoided. The upper story could not be 
lighted in this manner, but it was necessary to depend upon a skylight, 
as the new wing had to correspond constructively with the exterior of 
the old museum. Here, likewise, the adaptability of the interior 
has been subordinated to exterior beaut3^ The skylight is not by any 
means bad, though side light would have been better. Besides, the

the Cases for, the Collections in the Free Public Museums (Liverpool, 1901, 8 vo., 
10 i>i>. ), Prof. II. O. F(jrbes developes the fundamental features of his plan of instal- 
lation. The future collections will consist of: I. The Aquarium; II. The Mayer 
Museum, that is subdivided into three great ethnographical divisions, in the Cauca- 
sian (white), the Mongolian (yellow), and the Melanic (black) races; III. The Lord

and Subdivisions of the Animal Kingdom, from mankind down to unicellular forms.

and drawings, ilhistrating the distinction between inorganic and organic ol>jects, 
between plants and animals, as well as the general formation and the physiology 
of animals. Associated with the living forms will be the fossil ones, so that by study- 
mg them together the development from the first to the last may be observed. Then 
will follow the mineralogical and the geological collections. Beyond this a represen-

never be kept clean. The electric illumination employed at night con- 
sists of arc lights retiected from the ceilings, of which a test was being 
made at the very time of my visit. It resulted successfully, even in 
the skylight floor. The iron cases for the collection Avill soon be com- 
pleted. There is allotted for the interior furnishing $125,000 (the 
interior arrangements of the Technical School cost $75,000).

The present portion of the old Museum nmst be less favorably" 
spoken of. The rooms are too dark; one with a sk3dight and galleries 
suffers much from reflections on the In'oad desk cases arranged along 
the rail. The vertical and horizontal cases are some of them very 
clumsy. I observed, however, a good arrangement upon horizontal 
cases, namely, a l)rass mounting on the anterior framework, on which 
the observer can lean while examining the objects in the case. The

collection, owing to the relnulding, is not well cared for at present; it 
is also overcrowded, but contains much valuable material. The new 
installation of the entire Museum will work great changes in this 
respect. This Museum suflFers, like others, from a lack of a suffi- 
cient corps of assistants. The newly installed anthropological hall is 
exceptionally fine in its clear arrangement and the choice of its

objects. It contains, for example, life-size photoj^raphs of the heads 
of ditlcrent races, enlarged from smaller negatives. The ethnographic 
collection, now temporarily installed in the basement is very consid- 
erable, containing man}^ old specimens and also a good representa- 
tion of Benin bronzes. The noted ornithological collection is rich in 
types, and contains among other things the famous collection of the 
ornithologist, H. B. Tristram. 

The principal reason why 1 dwell longer on this Museum, though its 
importance is of the future rather than of the present, is because in 
one respect, together with that of Glasgow, it excels all other nuiseimis 
of the earth, and that is as regards the new ventilating and heating

installation. When the large new wing for the technical school and 
the museum was designed, not only that, but also the old museum, 
the library, and the art gallery, were supplied with the ventilating 
and heating contrivance described in connection with the Glasgow 
Museum. Engineer W. Key, of Glasgow, superintended the installa- 
tion of this in Liv^erpool. There are four and a third miles of 3-inch 
tubes, whicli carry purified and warmed air into each room at the rate 
of 8,000,000 cubic feet an hour. The ducts through which the puri- 
fied, washed, and warmed air streams into the tubes, are so large that 
one can easily walk in them. The power is supplied b}' great dynamo 
machines. The future must demonstrate whether, being located in

This has vei'}' generally been avoided in America. 1 am not favorably 
disposed to the combining- of a technical school and its many laboratories 
in the same building- with a museum. The windows of the building 
can not be opened, and the collection has the i-are advantage in that 
no dust is brought in wdth the air to damage them; neither does any 
come in through the doors, since the pressure of air on the interior is 
somewhat greater than that from without. This system of ventilation 
is known as Kej^'s improved plenum method. It was a surprise to me 
that the authorities in the Liverpool, as well as in the Glasgow 
Museum, did not know that this same installation existed in the other

museum. I repeat that the two museums of Great Britain which I 
have mentioned excel in this respect all museums of the world, and I 
earnestly recommend that we adopt this arrangement and do not 
remain in the background. The Liverpool Museum appears to have 
reached this in connection with the construction of the technical 
school, while that of the museum in Glasgow was carried out inde- 
pendently. 

1 notice in a printed letter of the firm of William Key (works for 
ventilating and warming by mechanical means, Havelock street, Glas- 
gow) that such installations have already })een introduced into a great 
number of schools, hospitals, factories, hotels, private dwellings. 



576 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

municipal ])uilding.s, etc., in Eng-land and Scotland, and that it is also 
installed in the university and the public library in Aberdeen. The 
Key list enumerates more than 80 buildings. Great Britain has prob- 
ably outrivaled America in this respect, at least I found this installa- 
tion only in two large buildings in Chicago (see the second part of my 
American studies) and in one in Washington. In the pamphlet pub- 
lished in connection with the opening of the New Central Municipal 
School in Liverpool on October 26, 1901," the ventilating and heat- 
ing arrangements are referred to as follows: 

The air in the building is kept under a pressure slightly greater than that of the 
outside atmosphere. The air is taken in from the large area at the back of 
the building, and after being washed and filtered by passing through wet 
fiber screens, and warmed when necessary by means of a large surface of coils of 
pipes heated 1)y steam, it is propelled by four large fans into the main ducts in the 
su})basement and then by subsidiary ducts to each room in the building. The air is 
admitted to the rooms at a height of about 6 feet from the floor, and escapes at the 
floor level into the foul air ducts which lead to the outside through apertures pro- 
tected by valves. (The electric power is supplied by the city works). & 

From 1877 to 1891, the museum published, at irregular intervals, 
live Museum Reports relating to scientific subjects; since 1898 a 
Bulletin of the Liverpool Museums, in octavo, with plates, — a well- 
edited publication, of which three volumes have appeared; in addition, 
Annual Reports, of which the fort}^ -eighth, for 190(». has been pub- 
lished (37 pp.)i gwide books, such as Synopsis of an ari-angement 
of invertebrate animals in the Free Public Museiuu of Liverpool, 
18S0 (32 and 105 pp.); catalogues, such as Catalogue of the Mayer 
collection: Part I, The Egyi)tian, Babylonian, and AssArian Antiqui- 
ties, 1S79, ix, 83 pp., with illustrations; Part II, Prehistoric Antiqui- 
ties and Ethnology, 1882, xiv, 106 pp., with illustrations; Part III, 

«Sir William Forwood, chairman of the "Library, Museum and Arts Committee" 
of the city council, on the occasion of the laying of the corner stone on July 1, 1898, 
said among other things: "This building is intended for the higlier technical educa- 
tion — for educating the captains of labor, and not merely the artisans, in a way that 
would enable them to meet the competition of Germany. The Germans have had 
these superior schools for years, and have been turning out a large number of expert 
and scientific men such as did not exist in England." As in the great Technical 
School in Manchester, so also in Liverpool, they are striving to compete with Ger- 
many in technical matters. 

f>l inquired recently as to the efficiency of the heating and ventilation after two 
years experience, and Mr. Forbes, the director, favored me with tlie following reply, 
dated Liverpool Nov. 28, 1903: "In regard to the heating and ventilating system 
of the museums I am sorry to report not quite favorably. This, however, is not the 
fault of the system of Key, which, by the way, has been further perfected, but by 
reason of the intake aperture for the fresh air having of necessity, and unfortunately, 
to be placed in a 'well' (surrounded by walls 70 to 80 feet high) , with which the air 
from the galleries is discharged and necessarily so constantly being redriven into 
the Museum. We are thinking of changing the ' intake ' openings — a costly pro- 
cedure — and when this is done, I believe all we can desire would be attained."

XII.— DUBLIN. 

Dublin is a seaport with about 250,000 inhabitants, without factories, 
and consequently^ reasonably clean, though not free from soot. 

36. SCIENCE AND ART MUSEUM. 

The Science and Art Museum comprises, with the National Library 
(tig. 108), a large, imposing, and beautiful group of buildings, inclosing 
on three sides a courtyard, which is fenced b}^ a grill in front. The 
central building, the Leinster House (the former castle of the Duke of 
Leinster), is occupied by the Ro^'al Dublin Society. Here are also 
located the administrative offices of the museum. On one side of this 
is situated the museum and on the other the library (fig. 108), both 
erected nearly alike by T. N. Deane & Sons and opened in 1890. The 
natural history department has a wing to itself (fig. 109). In the rear 
is an extensive park, in which, near the library, stands the National 
(xaller3^ 

The Science and Art Museum is open weekdays, admission free, 
from 11 a. m. till 5 p. m. and closed onl}' on Good Friday and Christ- 
mas Eve. On Tuesdays the department of art and industry, and on 
Thursdays the natural science department, are open until 10 o'clock 
in the evening. The former is open on Sundays from 2 to 5 p. m. 
The number of visitors in 1900 was 425,884, of which 64,165 came on 
Sunday afternoons. 

This museum, like the one of the same name in Edinburgh, is copied 
more or less after the South Kensington Museum, with the addition 
of a natural science collection. This uniformity of the museums in 
the Island Kingdom corresponds to the uniformity of life there, which 
in Germany and France is much more varied. It is often said that 

NAT MUS 190o 37

individual freedom of development is greater in the Eng-lish than in 
the German, )jut this appears to me to ])e very questional)le. 

The interior of the museum building does not altogether harmonize 
with the beautiful and impressive exterior. There is a central, large 
lighted court with two galleries, one above the other in the style of 
a railway station, overdecorated, checkered,. and somewhat wanting in 
good taste, even in the eyes of the officials themselves (it is called 
there the "German" taste; that is, like the cheap, inferior wares that 
were formerly imported); adjoining is a great series of rooms, of 
which some are very dark, especiall}' the. one containing the ethno- 
graphic collection. The poor lighting could be much improved by 
the Luxfer prism glass, but this scheme has been adopted as yet to 
very limited extent by the museums of the Island Kingdom. 

The zoological collection, too, has a large hall, lighted from above, 
with two galleries superposed (fig. 110), but the lighting facilities are 
somewhat meager, the cases and desks primitive, and the installation

not very elegant. I mention especially a Shakespeare case, with birds 
trained for hunting, falcons, and the like, together with passages from 
the works of the poet. Very noteworthy is the representation of the 
geographical distribution of animals in seven sections; distribution in 
general and six geographical regions. I know only one museum in 
the world where the same thing is attempted, namely, the Museum of 
Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which I hope to 
describe in a future report. In Dublin this exhibition is not developed 
very extensivel}^ but it is highly commendable. The great museums of 
the world (London, Paris, Berlin, New York, etc.) have nothing similar 
to this, 3'et they onl}^ are in a position fully to carry out such a scheme. 
The S3'^stematic exhibit must necessarily be supplemented by a geo- 
graphic one. It is a matter of satisfaction that at least one European 
museum, too, has undertaken this important task, even though on a 
small scale." Very noteworthy also, and as I believe unique, is the

exhibition in the "History of Animals Collection." It represents the 
history or the ori_o-in of species, classification, variation, natural selec- 
tion, instinct, development, etc. 

A conspicuous feature of the larj^e collections is the one represent- 
ing- Irish archeoloo-y, with rich and rare series, among them a larj^e 
number of gold ornaments. The cases here are to some extent better, 
but they are closed by padlocks suspended on chains, the appearance 
of which is not very pleasing. The gold treasure is inclosed in a 
steel tire and burglar proof case, which is especially guarded. In 
this museum, too, the policeman plays a gi-eat role. A valuable 
antique gold ornament, discovered in Ireland in lS9f), was purchased 
by the British Museum, but is claimed by Ireland." 

Since the art and art-industrial collections of the museum cover all 
branches, as in the South Kensington Museum, I can not consider them

properly in a brief space. They are very notal)le (for exaniple, the 
historical portion), hut their exhibition offers few individual features. 
The ethnographic department, though it has many gaps, is rich in 
old South Sea oljjects, though it is not yet thoroughly arranged. I was 
nuu'h impressed with the good labeling in some of the cases. The large 
type used in printing the labels is conspicuously better than the small 
letters almost everywhere in use. They can be read without effort — 
not so with the " South Kensington labels," which are distributed over 
the entire country. , This use of large type is well worthy of imitation. 
Another arrangement which appealed to me as worthy of adoption is 
that in many of the cases there is hung a printed bibliography covering a

special subject. The valuable bulk of the ethnooraphic collection 
indeed is loaned by Trinity College (University), whose ownership, 
however, is only a matter of form (Catalogue, 1895, see p. 581). In 
this part of the collection are very rare pieces obtained by the Cook 




Oceanic explorations, besides others from New Zealand, Hervey, Fiji, 
etc. A description of those treasures, with illustrations, would be 
appreciated, since Dublin is not so easy of access. Each region is 
divided into eight groui)s — lire, war and the chase, music, clothing, 
house utensils, agriculture, religion, miscellaneous. 



STUDIES ON MfTSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 581 

In order to convey an intcllioont idea of the rich contents of the 
great collections I give, in conclusion, the principal divisions from the

Ill the wintor of 1900-11>01, '■2'2 five lectures were delivered by 14 
diti'erent gentlemen, admission by card, winch were attended by 755 
persons, a comparatively small number.

director of the Royal College of Science, the Metropolitan School of 
Art, the National Library and the Botanical Gardens. Other officers:

The annual expenditure in 1897-98 was $120,000. The administra- 
tion appears to be cumbersome; since, for example, in the ethno- 
graphic department, authority must be obtained from London (from 
the science and art department), for a purchase, even though it 
involves but a few pounds. Whether this condition exists in the other 
de|)artnients, 1 do not know. 

37. NATIONAL LIBRARY OF IRELAND. 

The National Library of Ireland is magnificent without, but within is 
not up to strict modern library requirements, though the building w^as 
completed onl}' in 1 890. The architect, as is so often the case, sacrificed 
interior adaptability to exterior appearance. The stack system (five 
decks) is made with floor plates of hammered glass and iron, but with 
Avooden racks. In man}^ places the stacks are so poorly lighted that 
electricity must be used even in daytime. The horseshoe-shaped 
domed reading room (68 by 65 feet and 52 feet high,) occupies nuich 
space in the middle of the second story. There are three smaller 
reading rooms. On either side of the rotunda are the book stacks, 
but only those in the right wing are as yet in use. Each is 110 feet 
long, 86 feet wide, and 54 feet high, with a capacit}' of about 200,000 
books. The middle one of the five decks of the book stacks is on a 
level with the great reading room. In each of these there are 26 
double racks, approximately 8 feet high, with an intervening space 
of 40 inches, each with 8 or 9 shelves. On the ground or first floor, 
in the center, are located, in addition to the broad entrance hall and 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 583 

the great stairway, the administrative offices. Whatever shortcom- 
ings this l)uilding may have, it has at all events been carefully thought 
out and not erected after the general pattern. It is surpassed, however, 
by the new American libraries. I received the impression that they 
strive to be successful, l)ut the means at their command are too limited. 
Annual reports and catalogues of the amiual accessions are published. 
The library increases rapidly through donations. It contains at pres- 
ent 150,()(U» volumes. It must be emphasized that the arrangement is 
after the Dewe}' system, this being, perhaps, the oidy large library in 
Europe which employs it. It works excellently, though the books, 
on account of the small force of assistants, have no outside markings. 
The Dewey classes are distinctly indicated by labels on the stacks and 
easil}' found. Within the classes an alphabetical arrangement is fol- 
lowed, and when there are more books than one can conveniently review 
at a glance a sequence of the letters is attached to the stacks. The gen- 
eral opposition on the part of librarians to the Dewey system is per- 
haps based principally on the inunense amount of labor involved in 
the reassignment and rearrangement of a lil)rary, which can not be 
undertaken without very considerable means, and then, again, other 
systems have also their good points. 

It is open from 10 a. m. to 10 p. m. During 1900 there were 
148,405 readei-s. 

(See also F. J. Burgoyne, Li))rary Construction, 1897, pp. 153-158, 
with ground plans and cross sections, and J. ,1. Ogle, The Free 
Library, 1897, pp. 191-192.) 

38. NATIONAL GALLERY. 

The National Gallery has just received the addition of a large new 
wing, with skylights, and side lights in alcoves; in these the walls are 
not at right but at obtuse angles, which is certainly preferable. The 
large building makes, by its simplicity, a very favorable impression. 
The old portion was constructed during 1859-1864, and cost $150,000. 
In 1898 there were on exhibition 464 paintings, 348 drawings, water 
colors, etc., 280 portraits, 16 busts, and a collection of casts. It is 
open on four week days from 12 to 6 p. m. (or until darkness sets in); 
on Sunda3^s from 2 to 5 p. m. (or until dark), admission free; on two 
week days it is open from 10 a. m. to 4 p. m., admission sixpence.

Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery, Ireland. Dublin, 8vo, 
1898, 361 pp.) 

39. ANATOMICAL INSTITUTE OF THE UNIVEESITY. 

I also visited the anatomical collection, on account of its anthro- 
pological department, but as the hall was just being rebuilt and 
the cases shoved together, J could see but little. The collection of

skulls appears to be not unimportant. The director is D. J. Cun- 
ninoham, professor of anatoni}', also well known as an anthropologist." 
The Anatomical Institute is excellenth' installed, the large dissecting 
hall ])eing light, air}^, and furnished with the most ])eautiful dissec- 
tions, which here are preferred even to the best colored pictures. 

UNIVERSITY (trinity colle(;e. ) 

The university (Trinit}^ College) consists of an extended group of 
buildings beautifully situated in a large park w^hich is quite within 
the city. I could not examine it, however, because it would have 
consumed more time than I had at my disposal. 

XIII.— PARIS. 

My remarks may well be somewhat brief, considering the abundance 
of matter and the fact that Paris is universally known. I contine 
m3^self to a few notes on my observations. 

40. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY IN THE BOTANICAL GARDEN. 

[Museum d'Histoire Naturelle au Jardin des Plautes.] 

The majority of the museum halls in the Jardin des Plantes are of 
the old-fashioned style, wdiich have been already criticised by J. Mar- 
cou in his book, well worth reading, De la Science en France, 1869. 
But in 1889 a large, new, zoological museum was completed, which, 
as I then saw it, was nearly filled and is now alread}^ overcrowded. 
Furthermore, there was built three years ago a paleontological, com- 
parative anatomical, and anthropological museum, as the first of a 
series of new galleries which are to be located adjoining each other on 
the Rue de ButJ'on, the southern boundary of the Garden, their long 
sides turned toward the Garden and the street. 

ZOOLOGICAL COLLECTION (gALERIES DE ZOOLOGIe). 

The Galeries de Zoologie is a large rectangular building, 100 meters 
long, 02 to TO meters wide, and a])out 25 meters high (without cupola), 
with a lighted court 70 meters long, -tl wide, and 20 high, and three 
galleries superposed. To say it is a failure is not mj- judgment alone. 
The exterior is in very good taste. The great glass-covered lighted 
court was designed by the architect, J. Andre, as a central space to 
be ornamented with plants, and was not intended for the collections. 
It is full of large mammals, mounted on too conspicuous wooden 
bases — an immense herd, all standing free and some of them impossible 
to inspect except at a distance. The entire space of the height of three 

«Mr. Cunningham has since been appointed professor of anatomy in Edinburgh, 
as successor to Sir William Turner. The director of the Anatomical Institute in 
Dublin is now Prof. J. Symington, formerly in Belfast.

stories from tlic floor to the g'lass roof is eniptj. It would be well 
adapted for the large whale skeletons, " but the}' are exhibited in the 
collection of comparative osteology. Besides, they would detract still 
more from the only source of light for the broad encircling galleries, 
for these o])tain their light only from above. In consequence of this 
tho}^, especiall}^ the lower ones, are much shaded, being in some 
places so dark that nothing can be seen. In the front (Garden) portion 
of the building are halls 53 b}' 10 meters, provided with light from 
one side; on the ground floor these are 7 meters high, in the second 
story 6, in the third stor}' 5, and in the fourth story, with the roof 
work, 7 meters. 

In examining this building one can learn, as in man}' others, how a 
museum should not be designed, A few of the special features of the 
building have been published by F. Monmorv.* The building cost 
$800,000, the fixtures $600,000. Photographs were not obtainable. 

The collection is installed in not verypleasing wooden cases, without 
great care. In addition the cases are in some instances overcrowded and 
filled to the top, where nothing can be discerned. There is still fol- 
lowed here the almost universally abandoned practice of exhibiting 
very many stufl'ed animals, reasoning that people who donate things — 
and much is here donated — wish to see where the objects are placed. 
This practice will necessarily have to be discontinued at some time, 
even though republican France is moi'e conservative than elsewhere. 
The working rooms of the oflicers and preparators are mostly in a 
separate old luiilding. far away in the Hue de Buff'on, which is very 
inconvenient. 

COMPARATIVE ANATOMICAL, ANTHROPOLOGICAL, AND PALEONTOLOGICAL COLLECTION. 
[Galeries d'Anatomie ComparOe et d'Anthropologie.] 

This collection Avas opened in 1898/' This building also has a taste- 
fid exterior of red brick, with light stone trimmings and artistic deco- 
ration. On the side facing the garden there are four bronze and 
eight marble reliefs, representing human and animal life, by Barrias, 
Marijueste, Coutant, and Gardet; in front of these, two statues by 
Fremiet. On the narrow side, where the entrance lies, is a tympanum, 
by Allar, representing the three kingdoms of nature. The building 
is about 86 meters long and 15 and 27 meters wide. It is fireproof, 
of iron, stone, brick, and cement. The protection against fire was 
considered to such an extent that the workrooms of the staff are located

in an old building- in the Rue de Buffon, half a mile away, which is 
very annoyino-, since in the present day complete security can be had 
without this inconvenience. As a further security against tire, elec- 
tric lighting is not used. The building with its furniture cost 
$025,000. The architect was F. Dutert. In the white entrance hall 
with columns there is a marble group by Fremiet, and animals in 
relief as capitals, the whole simple, in the refined taste characteristic 
of the French. On the right there is a charming little lecture hall 
w ith a ceiling picture ])y Cormon, The March of the Races of Men 
toward Light, and ten pictures illustrating prehistoric times. The 
building consists princi]jally of a ground liooi", lighted on both sides, 
and a second floor, lighted from above, with a gallery. The project- 
ing stairway hall is situated at the eastern narrow side, and is of four 
stories, with smaller rooms such as the lecture hall already mentioned 
and some rooms for collections adjoining. It is surmounted by a high, 
arched roof. The large hall on the ground floor (tig. Ill) is not parti- 
tioned, is somewhat narrow (1-i meters inside) compared with its 
length of 77 meters, and at the same time its ceiling is somewhat low 
(H.G meters)^' compared with its length, but its effect is excellent and 
imposing, and is a model as to its lighting. As regards the points of the 
compass, however, the building is as unfavorably located as possible. 
The long sides look toward the north and the south and the collections 
are consequently exposed to the sun during the entire day. For this 
especial collection it makes naturally very little difference, but the 
window shades must 1)e drawn on the south side when the sun shines, 
and this bathes ever^'thing in a colored light, an error which we 
observe in many museums in the world, but which should always be 
avoided. The windows begin at a height of 2.6 meters from the floor, 
and are -1 meters high, 3 meters wide, the window piers being 1.8 
meters wide. The cases, which are 2.4 meters high, stand against the 
wall under the windows, and therefore receive their light from the 
high wmdows on the opposite side. At the end of the hall on the 
narrow side is a gallery. In this large hall the osteological collection 
is installed, the larger animals in the center being uncovered — a mag- 
nificent view — the others being inclosed in wall cases. These, made 
with iron framework but wooden bases, though not answering the 

« The height of the halls I could not determine on the spot, but Mr. H. Sinding- 
Larsen, an architect of Christiaua, had the goodness later to give me these measure- 
ments, together with others, without, however, being able to vouch for their 
absolute accuracy. In this nniseum, as in almost all which I visited in Europe and the 
United States, it is very difficult to obtain inforuiation concerning the buildings, since 
the directors, however willing they may be, do not have the data in their possession, 
and the administrative and building authorities who have this information can only 
be approached by foreigners with great inconvenience and with a great loss of time. 
To obtain special information through correspondence is generally very difficult and 
often impossible.

strictest claims and not dust proof, are jet good and serviceable, 
except that tliey have too much framework and too small doors. The 
installation has been attended to with the greatest care and ever34hing 
carried out with a degree of excellence that we seldom find. 




In the second tloor (fig. 112) the large hall is also not partitioned, 
and is 10 meters high to the skylight; and to the galleries, 4.6 meters. 
In the open space under the skylight are the large specimens of the 
paleontological collection without cover, which likewise produce a 
splendid eticct. Along the walls, in cases 2.4: meters high, under the 
gallery, are the smaller skeletons and special exhibits of such a collec-

tion whoso extent, (latinj»; back to the beginning of the Paris Museums 
(founded in 1026), is very important. There is liere also an extremely 
imposing installation, everything being well worked out and labeled. 
The light in the wall cases is, however, not alwa3^s sufficient, since the 
main source is above, and only at greater intervals are there side win- 




dows. It would certainly have been better if the second floor, like 
the ground floor, had been arranged as a covered room with light from 
both sides, but the architect here, as so often happens, has subordi- 
nated the interior uses of the building to its exterior beauty. Light 
from above, which is perhaps best for a picture gallery, is not always

well suited for iiatuial history collections. The galleries are, for the 
most part, imperfect. 

The showy wroiight-iron railino-, about 250 meters long, which 
incases the stairs to the gallery, and the entire railing of the same, is 
very obtrusixe. It represents large fern leaves and is by itself a piece of 
art, but in this place it is too massive, too conspicuous, and conse(|uently 
distracting. In the gallery the anthropological collection is installed 
(fig. 11;^)) as far as the space allows, comprising the long-famous collec- 
tion of skulls, casts, pictures, etc., relating to physical anthropology. 
Besides this a prehistoric collection is in adjoining halls, above the 
lecture room on the ground floor. This anthropological department 
is not quite so elegantly exhibited and labeled as the paleontological 
and osteological collection.

Gallery of second floor of the "Galeries d' Anatomic." 

It is planned to place the "galerie" which is next to l)e built closel}' 
adjoining, so that the present collections can be extended, and room 
])e o])tained for those portions which belong to this section, which for 
lack of space can not now be shown at all, such as the remainder of 
the anthropological collection, the whale skeletons, etc. They here 
also l)uilt too sparingly from the beginning, Init were wise, however, 
to arrange the new museum so that it can l)e horizontally eidarged. 
The style of architecture does not permit of its })eing extended in a 
vertical direction. 

There is a i)arquet floor, very stylish to look at, but wearisome to 
the visitor, since scarcely anyone is accustomed to walking on smooth 
parquets without carpets IxMiig spread over them. 

The new "Galeries (rAnatomie" are, without doubt, a prominent 
production in the line of museum technic. The}^ exhi])it a rare taste, 
and the building closely approaches being a faultless model of its kind. 



590 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

It is in a most happy way different from the general pattern. Every- 
one who has a nmseum to build should study carefully this Parisian 
one and adopt its good features. This advice can be given with 
regard to but ver}' few museums. 

Photographs of the exterior were unobtainable. 

I am indebted to Dr. O. Richter, assistant in the Dresden Ethno- 
graphic Museum, for the following separate data recorded by him on 
his visit in February, 1902: 

Ground floor (see fig. 111). — Wooden cabinets, with iron doors without crossbars, 
set in wooden frames, the latter, however, only above and below, and laterally at 
the end of long rows of cases joined together. Doors with steel frames all approxi- 
mate 75 cm. wide. The numbers of the cases are indicated by raised metal figures 
on the bottom, inside; color, silver. The shelves are of glass, also the bases for the 
installation of individual objects on the slielves, so that glass rests upon glass. The 
stands for specimens are of German silver. The rails and brackets are of iron, the 
latter secured by screws. The labels are of gray paper or pasteboard in red and black 
round hand; tlie mountings are placed oblicpiely or horizontally; they are of dark- 
blue glass if the objects are light colored. The same api>lies to alcoholics, in bottles, 
presenting a dark-blue background. The closing of alcoholic bottles with tin foil is 
obtrusive. The wood of the cases (and horizontal cases, see below), the bases of the 
free-standing specimens, the floors and shelves, are uniformly light oak-brown. The 
rails and backgrounds of the cases, however, are reddish brown. 

Second story. — Here the mountings are also of wood covered with reddish-brown 
cloth; stands of brass, not of German silver. Horizontal cases with wooden drawers 
below, and narrow metal frames above; no plate-glass pannels, but with crossbars. 
The construction is as follows (see figs. Ill and 112): The wooden cases are surmounted 
by horizontal glass cases with gold-bronze metal frames on which are tongues for 
lifting the covers. The wooden drawers are supplied with massive round, button- 
like, wooden handles ( two to each ) , set in hollowed recesses. A row of these drawers, 
situated one above the other, may be locked at the same time, through a general catch, 
which is located in the upright between the several rows of drawers. 

Gnllerij. — Anthropological collection (see fig. 113). Skulls on black bases with 
four ball-shaped feet. The arrangement is a geographical one: skulls, skeletons 
(on light-brown wooden bases of the same form as the skull bases), casts 
of types, and illustrations, etc. ; illustrations of types arranged also in the shape of 
fans. Here the cases have drawers below, as in the horizontal cases already 
described. Labels: The general ones black on white and of larger size; special ones in 
black on green with green borders and black on gray with red borders. Casts of 
types (Scblagintweit Collection) also in the open, on the wall, in larger groups above 
the cases (see fig. 113); these types have the form of medallions. Similar typical 
heads in square frames and on gray backgrounds also in the cases. Some of the 
skulls are iinder glass, with light-brown paper strips on the edges. 

While in Great Britain and Ireland, as well as in America, the 
museums keep open later than they ought, the limitations in this 
regard in the collections of the "Jardin des Plantes" are very marked. 
Entrance is more or less beset with difficulties, and it is only by excep- 
tion that one can go al)out without hindrance. While in the former 
case they go too far, here, through lack of employees, they do not go 
far enough. 

The annual expenditure of the Jardin des Plantes (museums, zoo- 
logical and botanical gardens), is $200,000.

41. NOTES ON VARIOUS MUSEUMS AND LIBRARIES IN PARIS. 

KTHNOGRAPIIIC MUSEUM IX THE TKOCADEKO. 

I wsis coiiipellod to visit this niusciini twice, since in tlie iihsencc of 
the director I could not obtain access to all its departments on the 
occasion of uia' tirst visit. Since 18S5), when I saw it, it had not 
improved in its administration, thoug-h it had increased much in its 
possessions. The Asiatic collections have been removed and are now 
exhibited only in the Miisce Guimct which, since that time, has come 
into the possession of the Government. The halls of the Trocadero 
(formerly the Exposition Palace) are not well adapted for this collec- 
tion. The cases are of the most primitive kind (mostl}^ old exposition 
cases), the method of installation is no less so, consisting in part of 
trophies on the walls; the labeling- i.s incomplete and intended more 
for the general public. The collection is not much cared for, in short, 
it has fallen behind the modern museum technic. A lack of suflS- 
cient means is the cause for this. How surprising it is that the 
enlightened French Government is so parsimonious in this respect! 
Paris, which in many respects surpasses all ought not to retrograde 
in the matter of ethnography, but now a great efl'ort would be neces- 
sary to bring the collection up to modern standards. The sVnall num- 
ber of officials in charge of this rather extensive collection bears no 
relation to its present needs; on this account, also, onl}^ one of the 
various halls is opened at a time, and therefore no adequate publica- 
tion of the valuable materials can be made. The annual expenditure 
is only $4,500. 

GUIMET MUSEUM (PLACE D'jENA, ]). 

This is now a Government collection. This nmseum 1 was also com- 
pelled to visit twice for the same reason that I did the Trocadero. On 
account of lack of asi^istants it opens its halls only intermittently, and 
in the absence of tlie dii'ector admission can not be had to the closed 
portion. The plan of Mr. (iruimet, to establish a museum of compara- 
tive religions, has been limited to Asiatic religions and extended, on 
the other hand, to cover the general ethnography of Asia. In respect 
to east Asiatic religions, the museum is over rich and suffers from 
lack of space; in view, however, of the ditliculty of extending the 
already considerable building, it being hemmed in by other structures, 
a serious problem is presented — certainl}- an instructive circumstance 
for the consideration of those contemplating the erection of new muse- 
ums. Although the l)uilding was erected for the purpose, it does 
not meet the demands of modern museum construction, either in the 
relative position of the several halls to each other, which are intlu- 
enced by its triangular ground plan, or in respect to lighting, though, 
notwithstanding all this, it has many good features. (Photographs 
were unobtainable.) I nmst pass over here the history, the contents,

und the valiuihlo publications of this most jvistly famous museum, 
as it would lead me too far. Besides, Paris is easily accessit)le to 
everyone and a desirable place to visit. 1 will only remark that the 
exhibit, so far as the contracted space allows, is very good; the label- 
ing, however, is so deticient as to oblige one to purchase the guides 
and catalogues. The labeling of the ceramic collection is especiallv 
defective, although not in the same degree as in many other museums. 
Ground floor: Chinese and Japanese ceramics; Siam and Cambodia. 
Second floor: Indian, Chinese, Japanese religions; Indo-China. Third 
floor: elapanese paintings; Greek, Roman, and Egyptian antiquities; 
Korea. The departments relating to Japanese religions and the other 
Japanese collections impressed me as the most noteworthy and as most 
thoroughly worked up and labeled. The nephrite collection contains 
wonderful specimens. At all events the museum is in its field unex- 
celled, though it is capable of improvement as to technical museum 
arrangement. Theannual expenditure is $9, .500, nothing being allowed 
for purchases; Mr. Guimet has thus far himself provided for these in 
some cases. The increase in the collections, therefore, depends mostly 
on donations. 

LOUVRE. 

1 refer only ))riefl3' to the Louvre, which 1 also visited on two 
occasions. The collections are of exaggerated extent. The installa- 
tion is in general antiquated and little cared for; the labelling unsatis- 
factory. I received the impression that an energetic hand could 
improve the existing conditions. It apparently sufi'ers also from lack 
of means. While formerly (as late as 1889) umbrellas and canes could 
be carried among the collections, they must now be checked (without 
charge). The danger of tire in the Louvre is great. The most })eau- 
tif ul is the new Rubens Gallery, opened in 1900, and excellently lighted, 
which can not be said of the adjoining Van Dyck hall, also opened in 
1900, nor of most of the Louvre halls. The Marine and P^thnographic 
Museum on the third floor is in the same defective condition that it 
was when I saw it eleven years ago. It is in some respects very rich 
in specimens, })ut it is not scientifically fitted up, and its installation is 
as unfavorable as can be imagined. The collection of Japanese and 
Chinese porcelains (collection Grandidier), containing a])out 4,000 spec- 
imens, in a poorly lighted half story, is carelessly installed in cases, 
and it is entirely undetermined and unlabeled. I saw nothing in the 
Louvre in the way of museum construction or technique which would 
be worthy of reproduction in a new building. I do not wish, however, 
to put myself in the light of one overlooking the importance of the 
Louvre among the museums of the world. 

GALLIERA MUSEUM. 

The Musee de Galliera is a sumptuous building in the Italian renais- 
sance style, by Ginain, in the neighborhood of the Musee Guimet, 



STUDri:s ON museums and kindred INSTrTUTIONS. 593 

completed about twenty years ago. It i.s tasteful and grand alike in 
its exterior and interior. It contains a municipal art collection. In 
view of the fact, however, that this is yet too small to till the large 
building, it is partlv occupied also as show rooms for the sale of art 
industrial collections. It has magnificent, high, excellently lighted 
halls, constituting a monumental structure of a taste and solidit}^ seldom 
encountered among modern buildings outside of Paris. It is very 
well worth seeing and departs widely from customary museum models. 
It is fireproof. A large apparatus for heating by hot air is installed 
in the very spacious, light cellars. 

NATIONAL LIBRARY. 

The National Library gives evidence of the fact that an old library 
can also adopt new improvements. About a third of the 2,700,000 
volumes " is installed according to the stack system in five decks, each 
2.5 meters high, with passages which admit the light; though all this 
is not in so perfect a manner as in the great new American libraries, 
yet it answers the purposes for which it is intended. The reading room 
(salle de travail), 48 meters long, 34 wide, and 20 high, by H. Labrouste, 
with some 340 seats, is more attractive and more artistically arranged 
than that of the British Museinn with its 300 seats. The written cata- 
logues on the crescent-shaped northern end are easily accessible and 
excellent. The printing of the catalogue (alphabetically by authors) 
progresses slowly on account of lack of means, the first six volumes of 
about 1,200 pages (down to Bancroft) having been completed only 
after four j^ears' labor, according to which it would require sixty 
years more to finish the work, though it is expected to accomplish it 
in twent}" ^^ears, as additional means are hoped for. In so wealth}- 
a country as France it is surprising that so little assistance is given 
an undertaking of such general u"tilit3\ In this respect the British 
Museum is unrivaled. (I tested the manuscript catalogue and found 
there, among others, more than twenty of my writings, which speaks in 
my eyes for the great comprehensiveness of the library.) The public 
reading hall (salle de lecture), on the contrary, is dirty, ugly, and in 
the highest degree unattractive; it consists of several rooms. A new 
one, however, is about to be constructed. When all of the additions to 
the library which are in contemplation are completed it will be mag- 
nificent. I could onl}- cursorily examine the other rich and celebrated 
collections there. Here the installation, partl}^ antiquated, seemed to 
me to be historically justified and accommodated to the objects them- 
selves. The reading rooms are open from a. m. to 4 or p. m., but 
not in the evening, difi'ering in this respect from England and America. 
The annual expenditure is $162,500, of which, however, only $20,000 
may be allotted to the purchase of books and $20,000 to the printing 

«Also 250,000 copper-plate engravings, 150,000 coins and medals.

SAINT GENEVIEVE LIBRARY. 



The Bibliotheque Ste. Genevieve is an original and beautiful building 
(close by the Pantheon, in the neighborhood of the Sorbonne), con- 
structed in 1843-1850, by H. Labrouste, and also interesting to me 
because the celebrated Public Library in Boston — which I hope to 
discuss in detail in a future report — resembles it in its exterior. 
The Boston building, however, is a square of 75 meters, with a large 
court3'ard inclosed by four stories, while the Ste. Genevieve building 
is a rectangle 106 meters long, 27 meters wide, with two stories, having 
only four windows on the narrow side. It seems to me unjust to speak 
of this as a plagiarism, as has sometimes been done. The Paris Library 




cost $325,000, the Boston Library, $2,500,000. I include here for com- 
parison the fronts of the two buildings (fig. 114 and Plate 40). The 
ground plan of the second floor, a cross section, and a side view of 
the Ste. Genevieve Library is given in the AUgemeine Bauzeitung^ 

1851 (Plate 386); ground plan of the ground floor in the same journal, 

1852 (Plate 471). A photograph of the building was not obtainable 
in Paris, and I had to have the one which is here published made. 
On the ground floor, on the right and left of the somewhat dark' 
entrance hall, is installed the collection of books founded in 1626 
(250,000 volumes, as given by one of the librarians), according to 
methods which are not modern, on wooden shelves, the valuable speci- 
mens (incunabula, Aldines, etc.) in cabinets. A shallow stair hall, 
built on the back in the central portion, measures 2.5 by 9 meters. 
The large, very beautiful and noteworthy reading hall, with accommo- 
dations for 476 readers, and a comprehensive reference library, is located

in the second story, and has a gallery. It takes in the entire length 
and l)readth of the buildiiio-, i.s 100 meters long, 21 wide, 14 high, 
with iron groinings and pillars, and is decorated with objects of art. 
It is very homelike. It is open from 10 a. m. to 8 p. m., and from 6 
to 10 p. m.; lighted in the evenings by gas, electricity being not used 
on account of greater danger (?). The damaging influence of gas 
upon the books is overlooked. The total expenses are $23,250, of 
which $3,000 are for the purchase of books, $16,000 for salaries, and 
11,250 for administration. An abbreviated catalogue and a catalogue 
of the manuscripts (3,500) and first impressions have been published. 

I visited also the Pantheon, whose artistic decorations arc not effect- 
ive on account of poor lighting, and the Sorbonne, which in its new 
portions, decorated entirely in white, is very impressive. 

There are certainly still manj^ other things in Paris from which I 
might have learned something for my special purpose. This would, 
however, have required a much longer stay than the few daj^s which 
1 had at my disposal for investigating some of the man}^ features in 
that cit}' of cities. 

When one has spent live weeks in large cities of England and is then 
immediately transported to Paris, he feels as if he had come upon the 
center of a higher civilization. I had that same impression years ago. 
This remark relates naturally only to the external appearances of life, not 
to the intrinsic worth of culture, which are the same in England as else- 
where. But the lower classes in the large cities of the insular Kingdom 
appear poorer and more degraded, their outer bearing more repulsive, 
further removed from enlightment and humanity. At all events the}' 
enjoy life less. Compare the enjoyment of life of the French in the 
streets of Paris with that of the English in London, Manchester, 
Liverpool, Glasgow, etc., and you have a contrast as marked as that 
between day and night. If modern civilization under the influence of 
trade and manufactures tends to the result which has obtained in Eng- 
land, it is surel}' a regrettable departure, which is practically carrying 
us back to barbarism." 

«Dr. T. C. Horsfall, whom I have already' mentioned, says on page 3 of a very 
readable recent paper, The Use of Pictures in Education, Manchester, 1902: "What 
will become of England if towns like smoky, unhealthy Manchester continue to grow 
as they are now growing? * * * Our big towns already contain a very large and 
constantly increasing proportion of the English people, and a great majority of their 
inhabitants are living under conditions which make physical, moral, and mental 
health impossible. No one who knows what south and east London, Manchester, 
and indeed all our large towns are, can resist the conviction that, unless the majority 
of our people can soon be got out of such places, or unless the stati' of the towns is 
soon very greatly improved, England, now preeminently the land of cities; can not 
long retain her place among great nations. It would be as possible for a great cathe- 
dral to escape destruction should walls and columns be rotten, as for a great empire 



596 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

The marked difference between the external forms of life in England 
and on the Continent results from the fact that the Island Kingdom 
has always attended to its own affairs and adhered to its customs and 
usages, while the rest of the cultivated world has learned to make life 
more beautiful for itself. This exclusiveness has had as a consequence 
a remarkable inflexibility in the manner of living, which has been 
fully realized by enlightened minds there. So Matthew Arnold (died 
18S8), one of the most esteemed of modern writers, says that the 
English nation has remained hopelessly in the rear in comparison 
with the progress of other European peoples, and that what it needs 
is not personal freedom, not wealth, industry, and the blessing of 
children, but obedience, culture, and refined enjoyment of life. The 
Englishman troubles himself even less than a Frenchman concerning 
what goes on in the rest of the world. Manufacturing and trade 
interests, and the strife for money, in connection with the provision 
for so-called domestic "comfort," which, however, in the German sense, 
is not such, occupy in general the monotonous grind of life from 
which it is not decorous to depart. Amusements among the higher 
classes are of a dreary sort, and the external circumstances under 
which they seek them are often cheerless. As a result of this, the 
English often enjoy themselves much more on the Continent than the}^ 
do at home. The Englishman, who when abroad is most exacting, 
when at home is of a most touching modesty, so that the German in 
England appears to be exacting. 

I submit these few remarks merely for the purpose of explaining 
why it is that travel for study in the large cities of P^ngland is not 
associated with much pleasure, especially since the enjoyment of the 
hospitality, although extended in richest measure to strangers, is 
rather a task, both on account of the great distances in the cities and 
of the customs of the country, which make ease of intercourse difficult. 

to maintain its power, should most of its people be such as the inhabitants of large 
parts of London, Birmingham, Glasgow, and Manchester now are. Of the evil con- 
ditions affecting the life of the inhabitants of big towns those which receive most atten- 
tion are drinking, licentiousness, unwholsome dwellings, smoke-laden air. * * *" 
And on page 21: "Very little intelligence is needed, for seeing that, if we could 
raise the life of our towns to even as high a level as that of Geneva or of any German 
or Dutch town, and escape the shame we now feel at the preventable baseness of 
English town life, that would be a result which, though it cost him every year half 
of his income, would make every well-to-do Englishman ten times richer in all that 
is best worth having than the richest man now is. * * * I greatly fear that 
England is destined to fall, a land of starved schools, of playgroundless, treeless cities, 
and of well-supported hospitals, reformatories, and lunatic asylums. ' '

42. ROYAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY OF BELGIUM. 

[Mus(?e Royal d'Histoire Naturi'lle de Belgiqiu-.] 

The Ro^^al Museum of Natural History of Belgium, which has l)econie 
famous as reoards its contents and management under E. Dupoiit, 
was ten 3'ears ago moved from the interior of the city (Place du Musee) 
and installed in a rebuilt monaster}- in the suburbs, in a high and 
somewhat isolated position. This, however, was only done with the 
intention of erecting a new building close by. This has now been 
undertaken; the house is under roof and will be ready for opening in 
a year.« It is immediately adjacent to the present museum, and the 
buildings will communicate with each other. It is intended for the

prehistorical, paleontological, zoological, mineralogical, geological, 
and botanical collections of Belgium. I regard this new building as 
a model of its kind, and while it should not be imitated without modi- 
fication, since from the start it has been specially adapted to the col- 
lections to be exhibited, yet anyone can with profit adopt some of its 
features in constructing a new^ museum building. Fig. 115 represents 
a long side of the half-completed structure, wdiich adjoins the old 
building at right angles. It is on rising ground. Fig. 110 represents 
the narrow end, with the main entrance and stairway, as well as a 
perspective view of the other long side, likewise in a half-completed 
condition, and fig. 117 the main hall of the ground Hoor, half finished.

tlio center stands the framework of a new case (certain!}^ capable 
of improvement). The k^ft half of the hall corresponds with the 
long side shown in fig. 116. The orientation of the building appears 
to be not without advantage, but I am not fully informed on this point. 
The st}' le is simple and attractive. The exterior is of stone. The slope 
of the ground is indicated by three unobtrusive divisions of the facade 
into different levels (fig. 115). It is entirely fireproof in construction — 
of iron, brick, and cement. The interior decoration will be quite simple 
and of uniform color. The building is conspicuous from the very lim- 
ited wall sufaces, consisting, as it does, almost entirely of broad windows 
with l)ut little space between (fig. 115). The entire ground floor consti- 
tutes one large undivided hall (fig. 117), with windows on both sides, and,

as it was feared that it would not be possible to provide sufficient light 
from the sides on the right and left, one longitudinal half of the hall 
is, in addition, supplied Avith skylights, there being no stories above. 
This large hall has double windows, contrary to the custom in most 
museums, as it was thought that otherwise the room could not be suf- 
ficiently heated on account of its great amount of window surface. I 
think this fear is without foundation; but if the cost is to be disregarded 
it is manifestly better so — at all events, for the purpose of keeping 
out the dust, in case the new method of ventilation is not adopted. 
(See Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool above.) This is not con- 
templated, as the system was unknown here, and the steam heating 
apparatus is already installed. The second and third floors cover 
only one longitudinal half of the building (fig. 115). The third story 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 599 

is devoted to the collections; the second— practically only an interme- 
diate story— is allotted to many workrooms, which all adjoin one 
another. Such an excellent arrangement is seldom found in any other 
large museum. 

In the basement, separated by a corridor 6 meters wide, are located 
the preparators' quarters and storerooms, the first well lighted, the 
second not so well, but to be provided with electric lights. The whole 
length is 84.26 meters, the width 30 meters. There is one preparatory' 
room 24.8 meters long and 15 meters wide, and three, each 18.6 meters 
long and 15 meters wide. Corresponding to these are four storerooms, 
each 7 meters wide. The height of the ))asement rooms is 4.5 meters; 
the portion under the gallery of the ground-tloor hall, 5 and 7 meters. 




Fir,. 117.— Royal Museum of Natural History, Brussels, Belgium. Large lower hall. 



The large hall on the ground floor (to be devoted to the recent and fossil 
vertebrate animals of Belgium and its colonies) is 84.26 meters long, 
30 meters wide, and 7.2 meters high. It will, however, ))e lengthened 
by 18 meters, so that the entire length of the building with the stair- 
way hall in front will be 109 meters. The ceiling of this hall, in its 
entire width of 30 metei-s, is supported only by a central row of iron 
columns, of which there are 13, spaced 6.2 meters apart. Each half 
of the hall has, consequently, a clear, unobstructed width of 15 meters 
for the use of the collections— a width which, without columns, has 
been made use of in but few museums l)efore the present day. Even 
permitting, as is proved in this instance, a superstructure of stories,''

inusoum halls of such a width oiij^ht not to bo obstructed by columns, 
as is universally the case. On the window side of the half with a 
double-g-lass roof there is a gallery 3.25 meters broad (in its first sec- 
tion still broader), intended for the cave finds, as well as for the living 
and fossil fishes of Belgium and its colonies, A similar gallery runs 
along the rear narrow side of the hall. The four sections of the floor 
and ceiling, which are of different elevations, are 24.8, 18.6, 18.6, and 
21.8 meters long. In the second (intermediate) story are located for a 
length of 91.3 meters and a width of 15 meters, besides a stairway, hall, 
and two office rooms, 11 workrooms adjoining one another, each 9.8 
meters long, 6.2 meters wide, and 4.75 meters high. At the rear end 
there are three library rooms of the same dimensions. In front of 
these rooms there is a corridor 3 meters wide and 3 meters high, from 
which anterooms (without windows) 2.2 meters wide and 3 meters 
high lead into the workrooms. In the third story, again, there is an 
exhibition hall 84.26 meters long and 15 meters wide, for the recent and 
fossil invertebrate animals, the fossil floras, the minerals, and precious 
stones of Belgium and its colonies. It has five different elevations, 
rising like steps, and on each level horizontal cases underneath are 
intended. Therefore there are about 400 running meters of horizontal 
cases in five series, rising one above the other, with longitudinal pas- 
sages and cross ways between, the latter with stairs. The ascending 
of this hall afforded suflicient extra space in the second (intermedi- 
ate) story for workrooms. Its lighting is excellent; the long side at 
the foot of the step-like installation of horizontal cases is one com- 
bined glass window (glass partition wall). In addition, a row of upper 
windows on the opposite half of the roof throws light directly on these 
horizontal cases. The height of this hall varies between 2 and 7 
meters, being 2 meters at the top and 7 meters at the foot of the step- 
like construction. 

A better utilization of the space is hardly imaginable, and what 
should be particularly noticed is the fact that no superfluous space (nor 
likewise money) is expended on the stair hall, as is the case in most 
museums. This stair hall is built in front and not inside of the build- 
ing, and is only 17 meters long and 7.1 meters deep. Each story is 
directl}' connected with the old museum. 

I do not go into further detail on account of the unfinished condi- 
tion of the building, but I would advise ever}^ architect who has a 
museum to design to scrutinize closely that of Brussels. It is a 
departure from every other structure of its kind because it is adapted 
to the original exhibition plan of the director. Mr. E. Dupont has 
throughout his entire life had in view the establishment of a Belgian 
national museum based on the researches that have been made in 
that eountiT. so taking the national collections as a nucleus for this, 
he shaped his plans accordingly, the collections from other parts of 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDEED INSTITUTIONS. 601 

the world being utilized only so far as they are necessary to a proper 
understandino- of this nucleus. With this in mind he has coniprehen- 
siV'Oly arranged the researches according to a detinite plan, and has 
recently included the Kongo State as Belgian. He regards the work- 
ing up of the collections as a less important function of a nuiscnun 
than the procurement of the materials, in which latter respect he has 
been very successful, as is evidenced by the famous Iguanodons 8 
meters high, 10 meters long, the fossil crocodiles, tortoises, sharks, 
whales, elephants, giant deer, rhinoceroses, etc. All of these, in 
addition to the extensive cave finds, will be installed in an intelligent 
wa}' in the basement hall. In the rear portion of the hall of 84 meters 
length a herd of Iguanodons will be installed in many different posi- 
tions, for which purpose the model is already prepared. As a parallel 
representation of animals now living, there will be shown a herd of 
elephants from the Kongo. The difl'erent elevations in the hall, rising 
by steps, will be utilized for separating the different epochs of the 
earth's histor}" and the general view of the installation in this immense 
space promises to be most magnificent, provided it is not detracted 
from by the cases. 

In view of the fact that the staff of seven museum experts must 
divide its time between exploring tours and the conduct of the nniseum, 
the assistance of outside experts, who are paid $5 a da}' and travel 
ing expenses, is obtained to identity and work up the collections. 
For this same purpose many specimens are sent out of the nuiseum to 
receive attention. Scarcel}' any other natural history museum in the 
world is so uniformly planned and managed, but Mr. Dupont has been 
successful only after withstanding the greatest opposition and battling 
for decades. He insisted so tirmly upon his well-considered plans that 
at one time for a year and a half his authority as director of the 
museum was suspended because he would not submit to the regulations 
promulgated by the minister. Finally, however, he carried his point. 
He also had a desperate struggle to reserve to himself the choice of 
the architect, who has constructed the museum entirely in accordance 
with his own personal directions. The cost of the building has been 
estimated at $215,000, the cases, etc., $40,000 — remarkably small sums 
compared Avith the cost of construction of other nuiseums. 

The rooms of the old nmseum will later be used for the non-Belgian 
portions of the collections, but since they are manifestly not suited for 
nuiseum purposes, the erection of a second new building is even now con- 
templated, for which purpose — which is of the greatest importance in 
the development of ever}^ nuiseum — an abundance of space is available 
on the museum grounds. Little, however, can be said iti praise of the 
present museum. The reconstruction of the monastery could have 
been better arranged so far as regards the lighting. The cases are 
those of the old nuiseum, not answering modern requirements. The 



602 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

installation is as a whole not attractive, but in man}^ details worth 
imitating. The charts of geographical distrilnition, now found in 
many museums in the world, emanated from Brussels and have been 
elaborated here more than anywhere else. Especially noteworth}^ is 
the labeling and a large series of long descriptive and instructive 
placards. The minister at one time instructed the director to arrange 
for lectures in the museum for the benefit of the visiting public; the 
latter determined, however, to give these in the form of information 
on labels, arguing that in this way the information could l)e dissemi- 
nated much more widely. 

In this retired location the museum is visited annually by 80,000 
persons; in the city formerly by 150,000. It is opened daily from 10 
a. m. to 3 or -1 p. m., according to the time of the year — in my judg- 
ment, nmch too long a time for preserving the colors of the specimens. 

For the prevention of fire, extinguishers are everywhere installed, 
known as the Extincteur Instantane, Systeme Ad. Vandrooghenbroeck, 
Molenbeek-Bruxelles. 

The annual expenditures amount to $31,750, Publications are 
issued as follows: Annales (10 volumes in folio up to 1896), Bulletins 
(7 volumes in octavo up to 1888), and Memoires (since 1900 one volume 
in quarto). 

It is not eas}" in a brief space to do justice to this original and 
uniquel}^ organized museum. 

4?,. BRIEF NOTi:S ON VARIOUS COLLECTIONS AND BUILDINGS. 

I also visited in Brussels the House of the People (Maison du 
Peuple), designed by Horta, a remarkable, large, modern structure 
(completed in 1899) for the recreation and instruction of the working 
people, erected b}^ themselves at a cost of $160,000 and utilized also as 
a socialistic sales house. It is entirely' modern in style, fireproof, and 
especially noteworth}" on account of the interior iron construction of 
a hall, which accommodates 3,000 persons, used for asseml)lies, lec- 
tures, as a theater, and for concerts. It is artistically embellished, 
not in the style of a railway station, as is found in many museums — as, 
for instance, in the older part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 
New York, in the museums of Science and Art in Dublin and Edin- 
burgh, and in the Natural History Museum of London, etc. Architects 
who build nuiseums should inspect this hall. 

The Roj-al Museum of Modern Painting (Musee lioyal de Peinture 
moderne) is open daily from 10 a. m. to 3, 4, or 5 p. m., according to 
the time of the year. Its lighting is insnfticient, as in many picture 
galleries. The great number of watchmen who were sleeping or 
entertaining themselves was noticeable, as also the marked lack of 
visitors. 



STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 603 

The great Royal Museum of Ancient Paintings and of Sculpture 
(Musee Royal de Peinture anciennc et de Sculpture) made an excellent 
impression on me, with the exception that the halls are not well cared 
for. 

I did not at this time examine any other institutions in Brussels, 
partly because the}' were already well known to me and partly because 
they were said not to l)e yery important, as in the case of the Congo 
Museum in the somewhat distant Teryueren. ^ 

XV. HANOVER. 
44. PROVINCIAL ]\IUSEUM. 

The Proyincial Museum is a new, rather large, and isolated museum, 
near a park, for which a public competition had taken place in 1896. It 
was not quite completed in October, 1901, but opened in February, 1902. 
It was constructed between 1897 and 1902 by H. Stier, in a modified, 
Italian high renaissance style, at a cost of more than $500,000. The 
city contributed the site and 1137,500. It form.'s a rectangle 82 meters 
long and 61 meters wide, with its main front facing the southwest, the 
most fayorable orientation for a building practically square; other- 
wise it is better to have the narrow sides face the south and the north. 
For this purpose the triangular site which was ayailable, the main 
front being placed along its hypothenuse, would haye been utilized to 
the best advantage if the right perpendicular (Plank street) had been 
taken as the principal axis. In this case, then, the form of the ])uild- 
ing would not have been shaped after general architectural principles, 
but only Avith regard to the collections to be housed. The three- 
storied building incloses a courtyard measuring 48 by 28 meters. The 
average width of the wings is 16 meters; the ground-floor storA' is 3.6 
meters high; the second story 5.9, and the third story 6.5. On the 
ground floor and the second story there is throughout light from both 
sides (see ground plan of the latter floor in tig. 143); in the third story 
there are 11 rooms with light from one side and 11 rooms with sky- 
light. The total height from the street level to the cornices, 16.2 
meters; the four pavilions on the corners extending 4.45 meters above 
this, and the rotunda still 28.8 higher. The entrance hall on the 
ground floor is 9,5 high and !(> meters square with a branching stair- 
way to the second story, where again there is a large hall (with cupola) 
16 meters square— the main hall of the museum. 

The building is of flreproof construction throughout, except the 
cupola, which is of wood (for economy's sake). The roofs, however, 
are covered with copper sheets with iron bands and purlins. The 
exterior walls are of sandstone and tufa, with granite water tal>les; the 
carved ornamentation of the main front is of limestone; the sides facing 
the courtyard are cemented and painted with amphiboline color, and the

cornico and window sills are of sandstone. For the interior cast-iron 
columns and beams arc employed, covered throuohout with terra 
cotta and siliceous marl. The floor is made of xylopal (sawdust with 
white cement), supplied by Kiihl & Miethe, in Hamburg, which is 
applied moist upon the surface of a concrete foundation; it has a 
yellow tint and is elastic. In both halls and in some of the other 
rooms terrazzo combined with linoleum is employed. As shown in 
tig. 120, which represents a room in the second story, the interior 
decoration is simple except for the capitals, etc., which are more richly 
ornamented; ceilings and walls painted with light lime color. There 
is steam heating and no ventilating apparatus. 

The building cost $6.50 for each cubic meter of built space; the 
foundation, $5-4,500, or $13.50 for each square meter, there being 
approximately 3,900 square meters. The new fixtures cost $14,000.

I take these details from the readable and comprehensive description 
b}" the architect in the Zeitsclirift fur ArchiteMur und Ingenieurtoei^en, 
1902, Part I, 18 half pages, with four plates and five text figures, 
quarto. 

For a provincial museum this is a most noticeable work and much 
may be learned from it. The building had to serve for collections of 
all kinds, for art and science, ecclesiastical antiquities, mediaeval art 
objects, sculptures, paintings, coins, ethnography, archeology, zoology, 
paleontology, botany, mineralogy, etc., and contains also as a con- 
spicuous exhibit the so-called "Guelph" museum, which is held in 
trust by the joint house of Brunswick-Lime burg. It was necessary in 
designing the building to make it meet the most varied needs, and on 
that account the architect imitated famous models, avoiding, however, 
above all things, iusuflicient lighting, which is so often found. All

the rooms are light except the basement, which was properly not 
intended for collections, but which, on account of the necessity for 
abridging the original plans, for reasons of econoni}', had to be devoted 
to this purpose. Thus the ethnographic and prehistoric collection 
there exhibited is quite inadequately lighted. Only on the southeast 
and southwest sides may disadvantages arise from too nuich sun. The 
partition of the third story into 22 small rooms is not altogether advan- 
tageous, the natural sciences being crowded thereby. In addition, in 
this department, for economical reasons, old cases were used as well 
as new ones made after an entirely antiquated pattern, although good 
examples were at hand nearby in the collections of the veterinary

high school. The columns and beams of _ the second story are not 
adapted to the dimensions of the rooms and look heavy. Whether the 
columns could not have been omitted altogether in rooms of this lim- 
ited width is a question well worthy of consideration. In the Brussels 
Museum we learned of a hall 30 meters wide with only one row of 
columns in the center (see above), a span, therefore, of 1;) meters, while 
the rooms of this provincial museum are only 14 to 15 meters wide." 
As fig. 118 shows, much money has been spent in the artistic 
exterior decoration of the building, and not less for its two large halls,

Paris also has a width of span of 14 meters without columns.

on whicn acc^ount it was necessary to make the building smaller than 
was originally planni^l and demanded by the extent of the collections, 
therefore it became impossible to install the natural science collections 
according to modern requirements. Besides, the form of the entire 
structure admits of no extension. Though the building is onl}' just 
completed, the builder already calls attention, in his description, 
to the fact that the natural-history collections must have a separate 
building! No provision has l)een made for the introduction of dust- 
free air into the museum, therefore the most recent important 
improvements in this direction have not been considered. As the 
museum, when I inspected it, was not entirely completed, 1 am not in

a position to express a tinal opinion regarding it, though I l)elieve that 
here, in conjunction with some undesirable features, nnich that is 
good is to be found. 

45. VETERINARY HIGH 8CH00L : TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL. 

The Veterinary High School (Tierarztliche Hochschule) is a large, 
onh" recently completed building in a group of single houses. The 
annual expenditui'es are $32,500. There are about 300 students and 
IT teachers. I confined my attention to the anatomical institute, where 
there is a miiseiun which is good but offers nothing extraordinary, as 
there was only a limited sum available for the building and as there

likewise is for its maintenance. In the laro-c, light, clean dissecting 
hall is such an effective ventilating apparatus that when it is set in 
operation, as required, it obviates all odors. -The iron cases contain- 
ing the collection, located in well-lighted halls, are of the Dresden 
pattern, although not of the most improved, type. 

The Technical High School (annual expenditure $125,000), whose 
mineralogical collection I visited, possessed nothing worthy of men- 
tion from a technical-museum standpoint. 

CONCLUSION. 

In reviewing all these experiences of travel — to make clear what 
there was new to learn, independent of old and well-known matters, 
especially in connection with the building of a new museum in Dres- 
den — I note particularly two things that deserve especial mention: 

(1) The new ventilating and heating methods employed in the 
museums of Liverpool and Glasgow, originating contemporaneously 
though independentl}' of each other, and also installed in the technical 
schools in ]VIanchester and Liverpool, as well as in the Kylands Library 
in Manchester, elsewhere in use only in America — has hitherto been 
entirely disregarded in Germany, so far as I know; and 

(2) The plan of construction of the new Brussels Natural Histor^^ 
Museum, which, being accurateh' adapted to certain special purposes, 
ought not to be copied without modifications, is ver}^ instructive and 
worthy of imitation as respects its .lighting and utilization of space, 
and also as regards its low cost, which has not, however, been allowed 
to detract from its pleasing effect. It, therefore, appears to be most 
noteworthy. 

In general, notwithstanding the shortcomings that attach to most 
human things, the Natural History Museum and the Museum of the 
Koyal College of Surgeons in London remain in many respects at the 
head as models in the line of technic of natural science museums and in 
the scientitic usefulness of the collections. There is probably no 
museum official who has not learned more in those museums than every- 
where else. The method of installation in the Ethnographic Museum 
in Oxford is unique in its way, and in a high degree suggestive and 
instructive. The liylands Library, in Manchester, remains, notwith- 
standing its man}' shortcomings as a library building, a magnificent 
jewel box. Finally, the Galeries d' Anatomic in the Jardin des Plantes 
in Paris is a most remarkable production, not only as a museum 
structure, but also as an example of the art of exhibition, particularly 
the ground floor, on account of its excellent lighting and the simplicity 
of its plan. 

Although I particularize in these several respects in concluding this 
paper, 1 do not wish to cast in the background the many other good 
things that 1 have alreadv mentioned in their place and for which I 



608 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903. 

refer tlie kind reader to the several chapters. On the other hand, not- 
withstanding- all the good that I saw, the opinion forces itself upon 
me— and 1 do not wish to conceal it — that, taken as a whole, the art of 
constructing natural science museums is still in its infancy. In most 
cases such museums are defectively planned, and it is only exception- 
ally that we meet with beginnings that may be considered as the dawn 
of a new era in this field of human endeavor. Then, too, the art of the 
interior installation of such museums is, in general, still in a very bad 
state. The principal reasons for this appear to me to be that, on the 
one hand, whatever is displayed in a prominent locality is imitated 
without judgment and without wishing at all to better it, and on the 
other hand, attempts are made quite independently, without any effort 
to profit by the experience of others in such matters. In most cases, 
also, plans for natural science museums are carried out too rapidly. 
A new building is determined upon, money is available for its con- 
struction, and then sufficient time is not devoted to properly prepar- 
ing the plans in advance — presently a plan is selected and all of 
its shortcomings must be taken with it. With regard to the interior 
furnishing, however, the conditions are still worse. Usually the build- 
ing has cost more mone}^ than was anticipated and economy must then 
be exercised in the interior furnishing. Although this is no less essen- 
tial, yet much too little importance is attached nearly everywhere to 
the interior installations, and far too slight deliberation is bestowed 
upon them. 

I am convinced that the natural science museum of the distant 
future will be very different from that of the present, often very 
inadequate, attempts. On the other hand, art museums have already 
advanced to a much higher stage of progress, due perhaps to the fact 
that their contents are not so varied and that consequently the problems 
to be solved do not present such difficulties.
