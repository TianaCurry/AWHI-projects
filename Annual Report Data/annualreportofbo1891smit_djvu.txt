JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITH- 
SONIAN INSTITUTION. 



Smithsonian Institution, 
Washington, January 38, 1891. 

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Eegeuts of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, fixing the time of the beginning of the annual ses- 
sion on the fourth* Wednesday of January in each year, tlie Board met 
to-day at 10 o'clock A. M. 

Present, Chief-Justice Fuller, Chancellor of the Institution, Hon. 
J. S. Morrill, Hon. S. M. Cullom, Hon. E. L. Gibson, Hon. H. C. 
LoDciE. Hon. Joseph Wheeler, Dr. Henry Coppee, Dr. James 
C. Welling, Gen. M . C. Meigs, Dr. Andrew D. White, and the 
Secretary. 

The minutes of the last meeting (January 8, 1890) were read and 
approved. 

A letter from Dr. J. B. Angell was read, stating the reasons for 
his absence from the meeting. 

The Secretary informed the Board that the following resolution had 
been passed by Congress and approved May 22, 1890 : 

No. 23. Joint resolution to till vacancies in the Board of Regents of the Smith- 

souian Institution. 

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Zhiited 
States of Ameriea in Congress assemhled, That the vacancies in the Board 
of Kegents of the Smithsonian Institution, of tlie class other than mem- 
bers of Congress, shall be tilled by the appointment of Charles Devens, 
of Massachusetts, in place of Noah Porter, of Connecticut, resigned; 
and by the ai)pointment of James C. Welling, of Washington City, 
whose term of oflice has expired. 

Approved, May 22, 1890. 

Tlic Secretary read a letter from Judge Devens, September 20, 1890, 
declining the honor of the position of one of the Kegents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, on account of a provision in the constitution of the 
State of Massachusetts, that " Justices of the supreme judicial court 

*Resolution of the Board, January 8, 1890. 



Xn JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 

of the Commonwealtli shall not hold any other place or office, or receive 
any pension or salary from any other State, government, or j^ower 
whatever." 

Judge Devens stated that were it not for this provision of law " it 
would have aflbrded " him " sincere pleasure to have been associated 
with the Eegents and the Secretary in the administration of this great 
national trust for the diffusion of knowledge among men." 

The Secretary stated to theBoard that since the receipt of this decli- 
nation he regretted to announce the death of Judge Devens very sud- 
denly on the 7th of the present month. 

Dr. Welling, chairman, presented the annual report of the executive 
committee for the year ending 30th June, 1890. 

On motion the report was accepted. 

On motion the following resolution was adopted : 

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year end- 
ing June 30, 1892, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to 
be expended by tlie Secretary, witli the advice of the executive com- 
mittee, upon the basis of the operations described in the last annual 
re]3ort of said committee, with full discretion on the part of the Secre- 
tary as to items of expenditures properly falling under each of the 
heads embraced in the established conduct of the Institution. 

Doctor Welling, on the part of the Executive Committee, stated that 
he had a resolution to introduce, wliich he desired to preface by a few 
remarks. 

The resolution of the committee, after certain verbal alterations, 
was adopted and is as follows: 

Resolved, That the action of the Executive Committee, during the 
recess of the Board, in authorizing the Secretary of the Institution to 
act for and in the name of the Eegents in all matters pertaining to the 
National Zoological Park is hereby approved, and that the Eegents 
authorize and direct the Secretary of the Institution to sign in their 
name all requisitions on the United States Treasury for the money ap- 
propriated by Congress for the National Zoological Park, and to 
approve for payment by the disbursing officer of the Smithsonian In- 
stitution all bills for services and supplies for said Park. 

On motion, the following resolution was adopted: 

Whereas Congress in the sundry civil act, approved August 30, 
1890, made the following provision: " Eepairs, Smithsonian Building: 
For fire-proofing the so-called chapel of the west wing of the Smith- 
sonian Building, and for repairing the roof of the main building and the 
ceiling and plastering of the main hall of the building, $25,000, said 
work to be done under the supervision of the Architect of the Capitol 
with the approval of the Eegents of the Smithsonian Institution, and no 
portion of the appropriation to be used for skylights in the roofnor for 
wellhole in the tioor of the main building:" Therefore, 

Resolved, That the Eegents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby 
authorize the Secretary of the Institution to sign all requisitions on 
the United States Treasury for the money appropriated by Congress 
(sundry civil appropriation act, approved August 30, 1890) for repairs, 



JOUHNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIII 

Sniitlisonian Building, to approve of plans submitted by the Architect 
of the Capitol, and to certify to all vouchers for payments by the Treasury 
Department for work done or materials furnished for said repairs. 

The Secretary called attention to an estimate he had submitted to 
Congress at the beginning of the session in relation to an astro-physical 
observatory as follows : 

Astro-j)hysic((l Observatory, Smithsonian Institution. — Maintenance of 
astro-])hysi('al observatory, under the direction of the Smithsonian In- 
stitution, within the limits of the National Zoological Park, including 
salaries of assistants and the purchase of additional apparatus (Sub- 
mitted), $10,000. 

Note. — An astro-physical observatory and laboratory exists now 
under every considerable civilized government but that of the United 
States which has none, except tliat the Institution commenced one on 
the most modest scale in 1888, which now occui)ies a temporary struc- 
ture on the grounds south of the Smithsonian building. Private citi- 
zens have subscribed $10,000 for an astro-i)hysical observatory under 
the charge of the Kegents, in the hoj^e that Congress would maintain 
it, and the Smithsonian Institution proposes, in this case, to contribute 
tlu^ most recent ai)paratus to the value of $5,000 more. 

The sum now asked is to be applied to the completion of the plant 
and to pay the current expenses, including the salaries of three assist- 
ants, to be engaged in researches of great scientific and economic value, 
wliolly distinct in apparatus, methods, and objects from the quite 
otherwise important ones of those of the U. S. Naval Observatory. 

It seems jiroper to state that the present appropriation is not asked 
for as an introduction to a larger ofie later, but that owing to the scale 
on which it is i)roposed to ibund and maintain this small establish- 
ment, no larger api)ropriation is contemplated as necessary for many 
years at least. 

Restated that if Congress saw tit to make the appropriation asked 
for, even if it did not set apart a site in the Zoological Park for the 
observatory, it would be desirable for the Board of Eegents to take 
action in accordance with the suggestions made in his estimates and 
annual report. 

On motion, it was — 

Resolved, That if an appropriation should be made by Congress for 
the maintenance of an astro-physical observatory under the direction 
of the Smithsonian Institution, the Regents will expend for this pur- 
pose from money already donated to them $10,000 for the construction 
of buildings for said observatory whenever a suitable site shall be desig- 
nated by Congress and obtained for the purpose, and will present to it 
suitable apparatus of the most recent construction, now in their charge^ 
to the value of not less than $5,000. 

The secretary stated that the following bill had been i)assed in the 
Senate of tlu' United States on the 5th of April, 1890: 

AN ACT to provide for tho (Tectioii of au additioual fireproof building for the 

Natiowal Museum. 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Conf/ress assembled, That for an additional fire- 
proof building for the use of the National Museum, three hundred feet

square, with two stories and a basement, to be erected by the Super- 
vising Architect of the Treasury, under the direction of the Regents 
of the Smithsonian Institution, in general accordance with phins now 
on file Avith the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, on the 
southwestern i)ortion of the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution, 
there shall be appropriated, out of any moneys in the Treasury not 
otherwise appropriated, the sum of five hundred thousand dollars; 
said building to be placed west of the Smithsonian Institution, with 
its north front on a line with the north front of the present Museum 
building, and constructed as far as practicable, after proper advertise- 
ment, by contract or contracts, awarded to the lowest responsible bid- 
der, and all expenditures for the purposes herein mentioned shall be 
audited by the proi)er officers of the Treasury Department. 

The Committee on Public Buildings in the House of Representatives 
had made on the 9th of January, 1891, a favorable report on this bill, 
and it had been submitted to the House as follows : 

The Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, to whom was re- 
ferred the bill (S. 2740) for the erection of an additional fireproof build- 
ing for the National Museum, submit the following report: 

To demonstrate the pressing necessity for additional accommodations 
for the vast amount of materials which has been accumulated for ex- 
hibition in the National Museum it will, perhaps, be sufficient to pre- 
sent the communication of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 

It may also be stated that in view of acquiring a large quantity of 
the exhibit of the World's Fair of 1892, as was the case in the exhibi- 
tion of 1876, such material being presented by various foreign countries, 
the pressing necessities are clearly'demonstrated. 

Your committee therefore recommend t\m passage of the bill as 
amended. 



Smithsonian Institution, U. S. National Museum, 

Washington, April 29, 1890. 

Sir: I have the honor to lay before you certain considerations set- 
cing forth the necessity of an additional building for the National 
Museum and respectfully request your attention to them and your 
recommendation to Congress that the money necessary for this purpose 
be appropriated. 

A set of provisional plans for the proposed new building has already 
been prepared, and I understand that these are in the possession of 
your committee, Tliey ha^^e been prepared with the utmost care and 
represent the results of exhaustive study, which has extended over 
several years, of the plans of the best modern museum buildings in 
Europe and America, nearly all of which have been personally inspected 
by officers of the Smithsonian Institution. 

The proposed building will contain about 220,000 square feet and 
the net area available for exhibition space and for storage and office 
room Avould be between five and six acres. The exhibition space would 
thus be nearly three times as great as in the present buildings, in 
which only 80,000 square feet are available both for exhibition and 
storage puri)oses. 

The total cost of the present building was $315,400, including expen- 
ditures for steam-heating apparatus, marble floors, Avater and gas 
fixtures, and electrical apparatus. 



JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XV 

Tho ])ro]iose(l buildiiij;' (;aii, I believo, be constructed at a propor- 
tionately .smaller cost. 1 am not i)repared to .state the exact sum which 
woukl be necessary for its comi)letion ; but, from estimates already fur- 
nished by responsible contractors, I icel sure that $r)00,000, if not suffi- 
cient to com])lete it, Avoukl be all that wcmhl be required to be expended 
during: the ])rescnt year, and 1 woukl earnestly urge the desirability of 
appropriating: this amount for the purjxtse iu question. 

The necessity for a new jNIuscnm building- is caused by the large in- 
crease in the accessions to tiie collections. In 1882, the first year of 
active work in the present building-, the Museum contained less than 
lila.OOO specimens. This number has now been increased to nearly 
i-{,()U(),000 si)ecimens, and the increase during the past eight years has 
been more than half a,s large again as during the i)revious twenty-one 
years. 

The collections of the Smithsonian Institution and of the Govern- 
ment are especially rich iu representations of the natural history of 
this country. A careful estimate made at the end of the last fiscal 
year showed that there were at that time in the zoological collections 
1,850,721 specimens, in the botanical collections 48,037 specimens, in 
the geological collections 100,700 specimens, in tlie paleontological 
collections 172,5-10 specimens, iu the anthropological collections 051,808 
specimens, and in the various collections illustrating the arts and 
industries 4.'>,540 S]»ecimens. Since this estimate was made, it is prob- 
able that more than 50,000 specimens of all kinds have been received. 

The natural-liistoiy collections include the zoological collections, 
the botanical collections, and the geological collections, in which are 
contained not only all the geological and mineralogical specimens, but 
also the greater ])ortiou (»f the i^aleontological material, the study of 
fossil animals and x>lants" forming an essential feature of modern geo- 
logical work. 

The anthropological collections illustrate the history of mankind at 
all periods and in every land and also serve to explain the develop- 
ment of all human Jirts and industries. There are in addition consid- 
erable collections illustrating the processes and products of the various 
arts and industries, as well as the historical collections, which are of 
especial interest to a very large number of the visitors to the Museum 
on account of the associations of the objects exhibited with the personal 
history of representative men or with important events in the history 
of America. 

It is also noteworthy that among the accessions of more recent years 
many collections of great extent have been received. Among these are 
th(> beiiuest of Dr. Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, which contains 20,000 
specimens of shells, besides minerals and other objecrs; the Jeffries 
collection of fossil and recent shells of Europe, including 40,000 speci- 
mens ; the Stearns collection of mollusks, numbering 100,000 specimens ; 
the Kiley collection of insects, containing 50,000 specimens; the Catlin 
collection of Indian i);untings, and the collection of the American In- 
stitute of ]\Iiiiiiig Kngineers. 

In addition luiiy also be mentioned the extensive collection obtained 
at the Fisheries ExhibitK)ns at Berlin and London, at the 'New Orleans 
Cotton Centennial I^xposition, and at the Ohio Valley and Central 
States I'.xposition. To these may be added the collections received 
annually from LI. S. Fish Commission, the Creok)gical Survey, the 
IJureau of l"]thiiology, and from nmny other Government dei)artments 
and bureaus. These are very extensive and are yearly increasing in 
bulk and value. 



XVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 

There is in the present Museum Building no exhibition space avail- 
able for the collection of reptiles, mollusks, insects, marine inverte- 
brates, vertebrate and invertebrate fossils; and the space now afforded 
for the exhibition of the vast collections of fishes, birds' eggs, plants — 
fossil and recent — and the geological collections, aggregating not less 
than 350,000 specimens, is entirely inadequate. 

In a letter addressed in 1888 to the chairman of the Senate Commit- 
tee on Public Buildings and Grcmnds I endeavored to demonstrate the 
remarkable increase which had characterized the growth of the col- 
lections in the National Museum, and I there stated that in the five 
years between 1882 and 1887 the number of specimens in the collection 
had multiplied no less than sixteen times. Since 1887 the pressure for 
additional room has, of course, grown greater, and during the last year 
it has become necessary to decline many offers of collections for want 
not only of exhibition space, but even of storage room where they may 
be temporarily cared for. 

The armory building, which for more than ten years had been used 
by the Museum for storage purposes, is now entirely occupied by the 
U. S. Fish Commission, with the exception of four rooms, used by some 
of the Museum taxidermists, who are now working in very contracted 
space, and whom it is impossible to accommodate elsewhere. 

Every si)ace is now filled to its utmost capacity, and no more collec- 
tions of any considerable extent can be received until additional room 
is provided for their reception. 

In a few words it may be stated that for exhibition, storage, and 
laboratory space 316,400 square feet are needed instead of 100,675 
square feet, which now constitute the available area for all of these 
purposes. 

In conclusion, I reaffirm without hesitation that unless additional 
space is provided it will be impossible to take any further important 
steps toward the improvement of the Government collections. 
Your obedient servant, 

S. r. Langley, 

Secretary. 

Hon. Seth L. Milliken, 

Chairman of the Committee on Public Buildings 

and Grounds^ House of Representatives. 

In view of the probability of the passage by Congress of the bill 
providing for a new building for the Museum, it was — 

Resolved^ That the Executive Committee of the Board ofHegents, or

rized and empowered to act for and in the name of the Board of Regents 
in carrying into effect the i^rovisions of any act of Congress that may 
be passed providing for the erection of a new building for the United 
States National Museum. 

A memorial was read from Doulton & Co., of London, England, 
calling attention to the deposit in the institution in 1876 of certain 
articles of terra-cotta, the principal one being the colossal group 
"America," a copy of one of the marble groups by Bell on the pedestal 
of the Albert Memorial Moiuiment in Kensington, and asking that the 
Board of Regents be pleased to recommend to the Government that 
an appropriation be made for the i^urchase of the goods now in their 
possession.

Tlie wliole sul)i('ct liad been ciiretnlly eousideie<l hy (he Executive 
Coinmittee and was now submitted to tlie Board without recommeuda- 
tion. 

After scmie discussion and iiKiuiiies by nieiubers of the Board of the 
yecietary and Chaiiinaii of the Executive Committee as to the vahie 
of the articles as Avorks of art and tlie desirability of their acquisition 
for the Institution, it Avas — 

Resolved, That the memorial of Doulton & Co. be re-referred to the 
Secretary Avith power to act. 

The Secretary stated that he had been authorized by the President, 
the Vice-President, the Chief- Justice, and other members of the Estab- 
lishment to ask for legislation the effect of which would be to modify 
the organic act so that the '' Establishment" Avould consist of these high 
officials and of all the heads of Departments. 

The proposed change . . . is covered by the following Avords : 

Be it enacted, etc., That " An act to establish the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men," ap- 
proved August 10, ISIG, Kevised Statutes, Title Lxxiii, be, and the 
same is hereby, ameiuled in section ."ioTO of said act, by striking out 
the Avords, " the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the 
Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Xavy, tlu^ Postmaster-General, 
the Attorney-General, tlie Commissioner of the Patent-Oflfice, and the 
Governor of the District of Columbia, and such other persons as they 
may elect honorary nieml)ers," and inserting the Avords, ''the heads of 
Executive Departments," so that the section Avill read: 

Sk(;. 5r)7"J. The President, the Vice-President, the Chief-Justice, 
and the heads of Executive Departments are hereby constituted an 
establishment by the name of the " Smithsonian Institution" for the 
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men ; and by that name 
shall be known and have perpetual succession, Avith the powers, limi- 
tations, and restrictions hereinaft(;r contained, and no other. 

The Secretary stated that in accordance Avitli the instructions given 
him at the last meeting of the Board he had prepared the following 
memoranda relative to the reimbursement of money exj)euded by the 
Institution for the (xoverninental system of exchanges. 

[McnioraiKlum relative io the re-inibursement of the .Smithsonian fund for expeudi-

At a meeting of the Board of Kegents of the Smithsonian Institution 
on January 8, 1800, it was 

h'csolrcdj That the Regents instruct the Secretary to ask of Congress 
legislation for the repayment to the Institution of the amount advanced 
from the Smithsonian fund for Gov<'inmental service in carrying on tlie 
exchanges. 

In ])ursuance of this instruction the Secretary has the honor to sub- 
mit the following statement:

cliauge of the Transactious of learned societies and like works; but, in 
addition to such publications, it voluntarily transported between 1851 
and 1867 somewhat over 20,000 i)ackages of publications of the bu- 
reaus of the National Government at an estimated cost to the private 
funds of the Institution of about $8,000. This however was understood 
to be a voluntary service, and no request for its reimbursement has 
been made or is contemplated. 

Congress however in 1867, by its act of March 2, im^wsed upon the 
Institution the duty of exchanging fifty copies of all documents printed 
by order of either House of Congress or by the Uidted States Govern- 
ment or bureaus, for similar works published in foreign countries, and 
especially by foreign governments. 

The Institution possessed special facilities and experience for such 
work, the propriety of its undertaking which, in the interests of the 
Government, is evident; but it was hardly to have been anticipated 
that the Government should direct this purely administrative service 
and make no appropriation for its support. Such however was the 
case, and with the exception of a small (presently to be noted) sum, re- 
turned by some bureaus, it was wholly maintained during the next 
thirteen years, or until the first appropriation to the Institution for 
Exchanges in 1881, at the expense of the private fund of James Smith- 
son. 

From January 1, 1868, to June 30, 1880, 292,483 packages containing 
these official Government publications, having little to do with the 
object to which Congress devoted the Institution's private funds, were 
transported by the exchange bureau at a pro rata cost of $92,943,36, 
of which $29,706.85 accrued between 1881, when the first specific appro- 
priation was made, and 1886. Of this $92,913.3(), $19,302.35 was re- 
turned from various departments and bureaus, leaving a balance of 
$73,641.01 expended in carrying exclusively governmental publications. 

What has preceded refers to the transijortation of official documents, 
and not to that of Transactions of learned societies and other like works ; 
but it is now necessary to mention that in 1878 the honorable Secretary 
of State designated the Smithsonian Institution as the special agent 
of the United States Government for carrying out tlie provisions of an 
international convention at Paris, which made the respective Govern- 
ments assume the cost, not only of the transportation of official 
documents, but of scientific and literary publications between the 
States interested, and it would seem that Congress itself adopted this 
view of its responsibility, for from July 1, 1881, to June 30, 1886, while 
the Congressional and bureaucratic exchange represented a pro rata 
cost of $29,706.85, and the scientific i)ubli('ations $39,034.90, Congress 
appropriated directly $35,500 — somewhat more than the cost of the 
Government exchange, but leaving a balance of $3,534.90 for scientific 
and literary exchanges unpaid. This latter sum, $3,534.90, added to 
the $73,641.01 mentioned above, makes a total of $77,175.91 for which, 
in equity, repayment might be requested. 

In 1886, on the 15th of March, plenipotentiaries of the United States 
and various other nationalities signed a convention, more formal than 
that at Paris, by which the respective Governments definitely assumed 
the exchange of official documents and scientific; and literary publica- 
tions between tin? states interested. 

The Institution ju'efers to adopt the latter date as a basis for its re- 
quest rather than the earlier date, though, as mentioned above, equity 
would seem to allow it the entire sum expended for exchanges, at least 
since its official recognition by Congress in 1881 as the Government

exchange agent. Xo claim for the exchange of a purely scientific 
character is made for the years 1881 to 1886, so that the $35,500 that 
Congress appears to have appropriated for this end is treated as hav- 
ing a retro-active effect, and this amount deducted from the crude obli- 
gation of $73,04:1.01 leaves $38,141.01 as the amount due the private 
fiind of James Smithson from 1808 to 1880. 

Considering sejjarately the period from July 1, 1880, to June 30, 1889, 
we find that tlie amount expended in these years under the direction 
of the Smithsonian Institution on account of international exchanges 
was $17,120.50; of this sum $37,000 were paid by Congressional appro- 
priations, $3,091.75 were paid by Government Departments and others, 
and the balance, $7,034.81, by the Smithsonian Institution. 

The action of the Board of Regents contemplates the presentation to 
Congress of a re([uest to return to the Smithsonian fund the sums here 
shown to have been expended in the interests and by the authority of 
the National Government, namely, $38,141.01 in excess of appropria- 
tions advanced from January 1, 1868, to June 30, 1886, for the exchange 
of oflicial Government documents, and $7,034.81 in excess of appropri- 
tions from July 1, 1880, to June 30, 1889, advanced for the purpose of 
carrying out a convention entered into by the United States, or an 
aggregate of $45,175.82. 

DRAFT OF BILL. 

Be if enacted hy the Senate and Hoiifie of Representatives of the United 
States of A merica in Conyress assembled, That the following sums be, and 
the same are hereby, api)r(»priated, out of any moneys in the Treasury 
not otherwise approi)riated, in repayment of moneys expended from 
tlie Smithsonian fund in exchanging with foreign countries the official 
])ublications of the United States (Jovcrnment, and in carrying out the 
provisions of a i'onvention for the exchange of literary and scientific 
publications signed by a representative of the United States at Brus- 
sels, March fifteenth, eighteen hundred and eighty-six, namely: 

Sec. 2. For exchanging the official publications of the United States 
Government from eighteen hundred and sixty-eiglit to eighteen hundred 
and eighty-six, as provided for by resolution seventy-two. Fortieth 
Congress, second session, the sum of thirty-eight thousand one hundred 
and forty-one dollars and one cent. 

Sec. 3. For exchanging from July first, eighteen hundred and eighty- 
six, to June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and eighty-nine, official docu- 
ments and scientific and literary publications, as provided for by the 
"convention between the United States of America, Belgium, Brazil, 
and other nations," coni^luded at Brussels March fifteenth, eighteen 
hundred and eighty-six, the sum of seven thousand and thirty-four 
dolhus and eighty-one cents; in all, forty- five thousand one hundred 
and seventy-five dollars and eighty-two cents. 

The foregoing memoranda had been placed in the hands of one of 
Regents in the House of Representatives, to present whenever it was 
deemed advisable, but no action had as yet, so far as the Secretary 
was informed, been taken. 

The Secretary informed the Board that the executors of the late Dr. 
-lerome H. Kidder had refunded $100 to the Institution, which had 
])een iiaid by the latter for legal services in relation to the bequest of 
Dr. Kidder to the Smithsonian, and the family of tlie testator did not

desire that "tbe action of the Regents in regard to the bequest should 
be attended by any financial burden to the Institution". 

The announcement was made that a bequest of a medical library 
had been made to the Institution by Dr. Jonathan E. Bailey, of 01m- 
stead, Ky., but the books had not yet been received. 

A letter of thanks was submitted from Mrs. Cox, thanking the Board 
for the resolutions transmitted to her in regard to the death of her 
husband, the late honorable Samuel S. Cox. 

The Secretary presented his annual report for the year ending June 
30, 1890, which, in accordance with the instructions of the Board, had 
been jjrinted and distributed to the Regents. 

On motion the report was accepted. 

Dr. Welling presented the following: 

Whereas, The late George Bancroft was for several years a member 
of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and rendered 
useful service on its executive committee: Therefore, be it 

Beaolved, That while, for obvious reasons of propriety, we should 
abstain at this time and in this place from any full or formal commemo- 
ration of the manifold titles to distinction which clustered around the 
head of our late illustrious colleague, we can not forbear from testifying' 
the special gratitude we owe to him for the interest he ever took in the 
welfare of this Institution, nor can we forbear from associating our- 
selves with the grief of his fellow-citizens throughout the length and 
breadth of the land, now that, in the fullness of his years and in the 
fullness of his honors, he has been called to rest from the labors which 
brought to him such a revenue of fame, alike in the walks of high 
executive administration, of diplomacy, and of literature. 

The resolution was adopted by a rising vote. 
On motion, the Board then adjourned sine die.

The coraraittee lias examined the voncliers for payments made from 
tlie Smitlisonian inconu', during the year ending June 30, 1891, all of 
which bear the approval of tlie Secretary of the Institution, or, in his ab- 
sence, of the Assistant Secretary as Acting Secretary, and a certificate 
that the materials an<l services charged were applied to the i^urposes 
of the institution. 

The committee has also examined the accoun*s of the " International 
Exchanges," and of tlie "National Musenni,"' and of the "National 
Zoological Park," and finds that the balances above given corresi)ond 
with the certificates of the disbursing clerk of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, whose appointment as such disbursing oflicer was accepted and 
his bonds approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. 

The quarterly accounts-current, the vouchers, and journals have been 
examined and found correct. 

At the last session of Congress a change was made in the phraseology 
of the appropriation made for ethnological researches (or the Bureau 
of Ethnoh)gy). Heretofore the approjunation was placed under the 
direction of the "Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution," and the 
Executive Committee decided that it was not their province to examine 
the vouchers, although the abstracts of expenditures and balance sheets 
were exhibited to them quarterly. The expenditures were made by the

Tlu' appro]>riatioii for lS()()-i)l lias been jdaced by Congress "under 
the direction of the Sinitlisonian Institution," and the committee de- 
cided that the accounts and vouchers should be examined by them in 
the same manner as othcn- e.\i)enditures for which the Regents of the 
Institution are in any degree res})onsible. 

The disbursement of the balance of last year's aj^propriatiou has ccm- 
tinued in the hands of the disbursing clerk of the Bureau (Mr. J. D.

REPORT OF S. P. LANGLEY, 

SECKETAIIV OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 18U1. 



To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution: 

(jtENTLEMEN: I have the houoi- to submit herewith my report for the 
year ending; June 30, 1891, of the operations of tlie Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, inchuling,' the work phu'(Hl by Congress under its charge in tlie 
National Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the International Ex- 
changes, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-physical Observ- 
atory. 

I have spoken personally and briefly of matters of chief importance 
concerning tiiese various Bureaus, and have then added, for the sake of 
com])h't('iicss, detailed reports from the Bureau of Ethnology, the In- 
ternational Excliange Bureau, the Library, the National Zoological Park, 
an<l the Editor in charge of Publications, which are contained in the 
Ajtpendix. The Avork of the National Museum is reported on at length 
iu a separate volume by the Assistant Secretary in charge. 

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 

THE ESTABLISHMENT. 

I have to record a. change iu the establishment during the year, in 
the death of the Hon. William Windom, Secretary of the Treasury, 
on I2!)th January, 1891, and the appointment of his successor to the 
Secretaryship, the Hon. Charles Foster. 

THE BOARD OF KEGENTS. 

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents fixing the 
time of the stated annual meeting of the Board on the 4th Wednesday 
of January in each year, the Board met on January 28, 1891, at 10 
o'clock a. m. 

The Hon. (Uiarles Devens, of Massachusetts, whose appointment as a 

mend)erof the Board by Joint resolution of Congress on May 22, 1890, 

was noted in the report for last year, tormall>- declined the appointment 

,on account ()f a iirovision in the constitution of the State of Massachu- 

H. Mis. 334, pt. 1 1 



2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

setts whereby justices of the supreme judicial court of tlie Commonwealth 
are rendered incapable of holding any place or office from any other 
State, Government, or power whatever. I regret to add that Judge 
Devens died on the 7th of January, 1891. 

The vacancy in the Board has not yet been filled. 

The Hon. George Bancroft and Gen. William T. Sherman have died 
during the year. The lives of these two eminent men have made their 
loss a national one, so widely known, and accompanied by obituary no- 
tices so general and so complete, that to repeat them here would be a 
work of superfluity. Reference is made to them elsewhere in the nec- 
rologic notices only so far as relates to their connection with the Board 
of Eegents. 

Mr. Justice Miller, whose death occurred on the 16th of November, 
1890, is also to be mentioned here, having been, as acting Chief Justice, 
elected temi^orarily Chancellor of the Board. He served in this capac- 
ity from March 27, 1888, to January 9, 1889. It would be superfluous, 
as in the former cases, to do more than to note the fact and with it to re- 
call the sincerity of the respect and the warmth of the regard which all 
felt for him who knew him in this or in any other capacity of his eminent 
official life. 

ADMINISTRATION. 

I wish again to remark that the great extension of the interests con- 
fided to the Institution make the duties of the Secretary and his assist- 
a.nts altogether different from what they were in its early history. The 
change brought about by constant growth of its activities has been so 
uniform in its jirogression that there has been no X)articular moment at 
which it seemed j)ossible to say that the burden of the work had grown 
to transcend wholly the means for eftecting it. At present I feel confi- 
dent that I am justified in saying that such is the case, and that some 
provision must now be made for enabling the Secretary and his imme- 
diate assistants to have additional aid in this administration of the 
affairs of the General Government from some source not provided for 
out of the already insufficient funds of the parent institution. 

This institution administers large Government interests, while no ap- 
propriation has been made by Congress for the exj)ense of such admin- 
istration, such as is made in all other analogous cases, and this expense 
is directly represented by an increment of the expenditure of the parent 
institution, chiefly under the head of salaries, which are not needed for 
the purposes of the original fund alone. 

FINANCES. 

I have in a previous report referred to the fact that owing to the 
changing value of money, the purchasing power of the Smithsonian 
fund, in the language of a committee of the Eegents — 

"while nominally fixed, is growing actually less year by year, and of 
less and less importance in the work it accomplishes with reference to 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3 

th«^ immense extension of the country since tlie Government accepted 
the trust;" 

so that it seems most desirable that the fund should be enlarged, if 
only to represent the orijiinal ])ositionof its finances relativelj^ to those 
of tlie country and institutions of learning. 

Everything which has occurred since this was written increases the 
force of the observation, I only remark upon it here to say that I have 
taken some pains to invite the attention of those who are seeking a 
trustee for the disposition of means intended for the advancement of 
knowledge, to the especial guaranties for security offered by the admin- 
istration of the Regents. 

It is proi)cr to mention, in this connection, that I have during the past 
year come into communication with a gentleman who desires to donate 
$200,000 to the fund, provided he can do so on certain conditions, with 
regard to wliich I have not felt myself authorized to act without con- 
sulting the Eegents, and as, nevertheless, they can not be assembled 
during the present year, I have taken the unusual step, justified by the 
occasion, of telegraphing to each individual member of the body to ask 
his opinion. 

Favorable opinions have been received in answer to this from nearly 
all the Regents and I may anticipate a statement jjroperly belonging 
to a later report when I say that the sum in question has since been 
placed in my hands by the donor, Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, of Setau- 
k<'t. Long Island, to be tendered to the Regents at their next meeting. 

Tlu' inxestcd funds of the Institution are as follows, being in the 
same condition as in my last report: 

Bequest of 8mitlis(»ii, 18l(> $515, 169. 00 

Residuary legaey of Smitlisoii, 1807 26, 210. 63 

Deposits from saviims of income, etc., 18G7 108, 620. 37 

Hequest of James Hamilton, 1874 1, 000. 00 

Be«iuest of Simeon Habel, 1880 500. 00 

Deposits from proceeds of sale of bonds, 1881 51, 500. 00 

I'olal permauiMit Smitlisouian fund in the Treasury of tlie United 
.States, bearing interest at 6 per cent per annum 703, 000. 00 

At the beginning of the fiscal year the balance on hand was $30,192.05. 
Interest on the in\'estcd fund, amounting to $42,1S0, has been received 
from the Treasurer of the United States during the year, and from sales 
of publications ami miscellaneous sources, including repayments on ac- 
c(»unt of international exchanges, $0,702.37, making a total of $79,135.02. 

The totid expenditures, as shown in detail in the report of the exec- 
utive committee, have been $39,072.01, leaving an unexi^ended balance 
on June 30, 1891, of $10,002.11. This includes a sum of $10,000, the 
annmnt of a bequest of $5,000 from the late Br. J. H. Kidder and a 
donation of a like amount from Dr. Alexander Graham Bell personally 
to the Secretary for physical investigations, which was, with the donor's 
consent, deposited by the Secretary to the credit of the funds of the In- 
stitution subject to order. Xeither of tliese sums, then, forms a portion 



4 KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

of tlie invested fuucls, and both have been held in the hojie that Con- 
gress would later provide a site for a permanent building for the astro- 
physical observatory. The balance then available for the general 
puriwses of the Institution on July 1, 1891, was $30,002.11, but this is 
in part held against various liabilities for scientific purposes. 

The Institution Las been charged by Congress with the disburse- 
ments during the year of the following appropriations: 

For internatioual exchanges $17, 000 

For ethnological researches 40, 000 

For National Museum : 

Presei'vation of collections $140, 000 

Furniture and fixtures 25, 000 

Heating and lighting 12, 000 

Postage 500 

Printing 10, 000 

Perkin's collection prehistoric copper implements 7, 000 

For Smithsoniau Institution Building repairs 25, 000 

To these should be added the unexpended balance of the special 
appropriation of $92,000 made April 30, 1890, for the ISTatioual Zoologi- 
cal Park. 

The vouchers for the disbursement of these appropriations have been 
examined by the executive committee, and the various items of expend- 
iture are set forth iu a letter addressed to the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives in accordance with a provision of the sundry civil act 
of October 2, 1888, while the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund 
have likewise been examined and approved by the executive committee 
and are shown in their report. 

I may here call attention to a change in the phraseology of the sun- 
dry civil act making appropriation for ethnological researches, whereby 
the appropriation is placed "under the direction of the Smithsonian 
Institution," instead of in the charge of the "Secretary of the Smithson- 
ian Institution," as heretofore. The vouchers from the Bureau of Eth- 
.uology are therefore now scrutinized by the executive committee, as are 
all other expenditures of the Institution. 

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, forwarded to 
the Secretary of the Treasury under date of October 20, 1890, were as 
follows : 

International exchanges $32, 400 

North American ethnology 50, 000 

National Museum : 

Preservation of collections 180, 000 

Healiug and lighting 15, 000 

Furniture and fixtures 30, 000 

Printing and hinding 19, 000 

Postage 1, 000 

Customs duties on j lass, tin, etc 3, 000 

Replacing old boilers, etc 3, 000 

Replacing wooden floor with granolithic or artificial stone 5, 000 

National Zoological Park _ 101, 350 

Astrophysical observatory 10, 000 



EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5 

lUTILDlNGS. 

T must again urge ui)on the atteutioii of the Eegeuts the ever-increas- 
ing necessity for relief from the overcrowded condition of the National 
jNInscuni. The lack of more adequate accommodation has been even 
more forcibly presented than ever before in making the necessary prep- 
arations for the Museum exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition 
ill (Miicago. 

Tlie present Museum building was finished and occupied in 1881. The 
collections increased so rapidly that as early as 1883 the Kegents, at 
their meeting of January 17, recommended to Congress the erection of 
a new building. 

Since 1883 the collections have again increased to sucli an extent that 
a new building as large as the present one could now be practically 
tilled witli material held in storage, and I can only repeat with increased 
emphasis the closing sentence of my letter of January 21, 1800, to the 
Hon. Leland Stanford, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Public 
Buildings and Gnmnds, "that unless more space is i^rovided the de- 
velopment of the Government collection, which is already jiartly ar- 
rested, will be almost completely stopped." 

Plans for a new museum building of two stories and basement were 
laid bel'ore the Board in January, 1890, and on February li), 1800, a 
bill appropriating $500,000 was reported by Senator Morrill from the 
Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds and passed the 
Senate on April 5, 1890. This bill was favorably reported from the 
House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds January 9, 1891, 
but at the close of the session it had not come before the House for 
action. 

An appropriation of .$2."),000 for tire-prooting the so-called chapel of 
the west wing of the Smithsonian Building and for repairing the roof 
of the main building and the ceibng and plastering of the main hall of 
the building, having become available, ])lans for the conteni])lated im- 
provements were prepared by the Architect of the Capitol, as directed 
by Congress, ai^d work was begun in April, 1891. The old roof of the 
chapel was entirely removed and replaced tem])()rarily by a wooden cov- 
ering for the protection of the si)ei'imens contained in this part of the 
building. By the end of June gratifying progress had been made 
towaids the construction of a safe, substantial iron and slate roof 

Tliis a|)propriation of >'2."),000 was but a portion of the sum asked for 
to be used not only for lire-prooting the chapel and repairing the roof 
of the main building, but also for making other repairs upon the build- 
ing, more especially in making niorc^ suitable provision for storing and 
liandling the Government documents, the distribution of which Con- 
gress has intrusted to the Institution. Under the wording of the appro- 
l)riation act it was fimnd, however, that the expenditure of the appro- 
priation was confined to the two items mentioned above. I have referred 



6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

elsewhere in this report to the special needs of the exchange depart- 
ment, on account of the over-crowded condition of the store-rooms occu- 
pied by the Government. 

The new buildings erected or in process of erection for the collection 
of living" animals, being- all in the Zoological Park, are mentioned in the 
report upon the park. 

RESEARCH. 

I am gratified to report that it has been possible by reducing ex- 
penses in other directions to revert in some measure to an early x)rac- 
tice of the institution, eminently consonant with its founder's purpose, 
that of offering aid in original research to certain investigations of 
much importance which were hindered by lack of means. 

Among the special grants may be named that of |500 to Prof. A. A. 
Michelson, of Clark University, for continuing his important work upon 
a universal standard of measure founded on the wave-length of light; 
also a sum of $600 placed at the disposal of Prof. E. W. Morley, to pro- 
cure a special apparatus for determinations of the density of oxygen 
and hydrogen, an investigation requiring extreme precision and dehcacy 
of manipulation, and promising results of wide api)lication ; while $200 
was placed at the disposal of Dr. Wolcott Gibbs, for investigations 
at his laboratory in Newport ujDon chemical comi^ounds. 

To Prof. E. S. Holden, director of the Lick Observatory, California, 
a grant of $200 was made, to assist in perfecting his apparatus for 
securing photographs of the moon. The results of his studies in this 
field Prof. Holden has offered to place at the disposal of the Smith- 
sonian Institution for publication at some future day, should it seem 
desirable. 

Prof. Pickering, director of the Harvard Observatory, has also placed 
at the disj)osal of the Institution for i)ublication a very valuable series 
of photographs of the moon, which have been secured at the Harvard 
Observatory, and which will be supplemented by photographs to be 
taken at the Harvard Observatory high-altitude station in the moun- 
tains of Peru. 

The director of the Paris Observatory, Admiral Mc^ichez, has like- 
wise promised his co-operation in securing lunar photographs of the 
highest degree of excellence now attainable. 

With the aid of these three j)rominent observatories, which have given 
especial attention to the subject of lunar photography, it is jiroposedto 
prepare a volume representing upon a large scale the best results that 
can be secured, thus placing on record a detailed description of the 
lunar surface, the value of which for comparison with observations and 
photographs of the future can scarcely be over-estimated. 

In furtherance of the plan for the establishment of standard sizes of 
screws and of diameters of tubing, etc., for astronomical and physical 
api^aratus — a subject which has received the attention of committees of 
the National Academy of Science, as also of the American Association 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7 

for tlie Advancement of Science — a few standards have been tentatively 
adopted, and co])ies <^f tlicse are attainable hy all interested in secnring 
uniformity in this class of work. 

I have referred above to researches in physical science alone; the 
work of individual members of the Institution and of others in the nat- 
ural sciences is given in connection with the portion of the report relat- 
ing to the Museum. I may, however, state that certain physical inves- 
tigations, wliich have been made under the personal direction of the 
Secretary of the Institution at private charge and not at the cost of its 
funds, are about being published in a volume of its Contributions,* in 
aijcordance witli a policy long since counseled by the Board of Regents. 

Astro-plii/sicdl Observatory. — I may recall briefly here the circum- 
stances which have led to the establishment of an astro-physical ob- 
servatory as a part of the Smithsonian Institution. 

In the ftrst report that I had the honor to present to the attention of 
the Kegents in 1888 I stated that preparations had been made by the 
late Secretary, Prof. Baird, to establish an astro- physical observatory 
and laboratory, in order that renewed attention might be given to the 
study of physical science. It was there reported that, in view of the 
fact that the construction of delicate instruments would occupy a con- 
siderable tinu', orders had already been given for the most essential 
pieces of apparatus for conducting investigations in radiant energy. 

A special interest was taken in the proposed astro-physical observa- 
tory by the late Dr. J. TI. Kidder, formerly Curator of Exchanges in the 
Smithsonian Institution, and the sum of $5,000 was received from his 
executors for this purpose under circumstances detailed in my last re- 
port. A lite sum of 15,000 was presented personally to the Secretary 
by Br. Alexander (xrahani licll for prosecuting physical investigations, 
and particularly those upon radiant energy, and this sum was, with the 
consent and ai>proval of the donin*, placed to the credit of the Smith- 
sonian Institution upon the same footing as the Kidder bequest. 

A temporary wooden building of the simplest possible construction 
has lieen erected in the Smithsonian grounds just south of the main 
building, having been begun on the 18th of November, 1889, and finished 
about the 1st of [March, 1800. This building is not to be regarded as 
an entirely suitable or permanent housing for the instruments. Its 
location, close to travelled streets, is unsuited for refined physical inves- 
tigation, but the preliminary adjustnuMit of the instruments and cer- 
tain classes of work can be effectively and conveniently carried on here. 

The principal instrument is a specially constructed siderostat by Sir 
Howard (Irubb, of Dublin, lr(»land. This instrument is in position. A 
S])ectro-l)olometer, the outcome of many years' experience, has been 
made under my i)ersonal direction by William Grunow & Son, of New 
York, and has been received and mounted. A galvanometer, designed

8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

for the particular class of work iu view, lias been received, and was the 
last of the principal pieces of apparatus (provided for from the Smith- 
sonian fund) to be put in place. The outfit is now in the main com- 
plete. 

This country has no observatory devoted exclusively to astro-physical 
research, though Eugland, France, and Germany have maintained for 
a number of years at a considerable expense observatories for the study 
of the physical condition of celestial bodies. I therefore indulged 
the hope that, in i)resentiug the matter to Congress as previously re- 
ported, a request for a small annual appropriation for the maintenance 
of the observatory thus founded and equipped might meet with favor- 
able consideration. I may say that the amount asked for ($10,000 for 
annual maintenance) has been appropriated, and will be available dur- 
ing the coming fiscal year. 

In adjusting and determining the constants of the instruments, a work 
involving considerable labor, I have had the valuable assistance of Prof. 
C. C. Hutchins, of Bowdoin College, during a portion of the summer 
vacation. Ko iiermanent appointments of the assistants who will be 
required to carry on the investigations contemplated will be made until 
after the appropriation shall have become available. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

The explorations of chief importance carried on by the Institution 
have been conducted by the Bureau of Ethnology and by the National 
Museum, and to the reports of these departments reference should be 
made for details. 

PUBLICATIONS. 

The publications for the year have continued to represent the usual 
standard both in the number and in the general character of the sev- 
eral issues. 

Smithsonian Contributions to Kmyivlcdfje. — Mention may be made here 
of a publication embracing a collection of twenty-three colored plates 
illustrating the forest trees of North America, an unfinished work un- 
dertaken by the late Dr. Asa Gray, many years ago, which although in 
the quarto form of the Contributions to Knowledge, will not be in- 
cluded in volumes of that series. While no memoir has been actually 
published during the year, a paper presenting an account of some new 
exijeriments in aero-dyna;mics (already referred to) is in course of prep- 
aration, and will probably be through the press in August. It will not 
much exceed 100 quarto pages of letterpress, and will be illustrated by 
about ten plates. 

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collectioris. — A memoir on "The Corrections 
of Sextants for errors of Eccentricity and Gravitation," by Mr. Joseph 
A. Rogers, of this city, presents a good discussion of the subject, and

Olicniical Tufliieiu'c of Li<>lit," by Mr. Alfred Tuekermaii, belongs to tlie 
growing class of reference aids to investigators and students, rendered 
necessary by the rapidly increasing volume of scientific literature. 

In the Miscellaneous Collections for the year a number of articles 
from the general appendix to the annual reports, commonly prepared 
at the expense of the Institution, have been considered worthy of re- 
l)ublication as separate essays, and will probably find their place ulti- 
mately in volumes of this series. 

Sniithsoriian annual reports. — The annual report of the Regents to 
Congress on the ojjerations and condition of the Institution for the year 
ending ,1 une 30, 1888, was received more promptly than usual, and has 
been largely distributed. The annual rei^ort of the Regents on the 
operations and condition of the U. S. National Museum for the same 
period has also been received and widely distributed. The annual 
report of the Regents to Congress on the Institution, ibr the year end- 
ing June 30, 1880, has in addition been received and distributed, and 
the annual re])ort of the Secretary to the Board of Regents for the 
year ending June 30, 1800, has been issued during the year. 

^V full descriptive list of the Smithsonian publications for the year 
will l>c given in the appendix. 

SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE. 

Tlic work of the Smitlisonian luvstitution through which it is perhaps 
most widely known is its exchange service, whereby in a direct and 
tangible manner it eft'ects one of the objects of its founder, "the diffu- 
sion of knowledge among men." 

The exchange service was established very early in the history of the 
Institution, when conununication between scientific men, particularly 
between those of the Old and of the New World, was slow and expen- 
sive. Its object was to distribute the Smithsonian publications, and to 
furnish at the same time a channel through wiiich the publications of 
scientific men, societies, and institutions in this country might be sent 
to correspondents abroad, and similar publications from abroad might 
be received and distributed in America. The Institution received hearty 
cooperation in every direction. Tlie chief learned societies in different 
parts of the Wiu-ld offered their aid as distributing centers of exchange 
(hxMiments, and many of the larger steamship companies generously 
consented to carry exchange boxes free of freight charges; foreign gov- 
ernnu^nts gave their aid, and in 1854 Prof. Henry announced in his 
rei)ort that there was " no port to which the Smithsonian parcels are 
shii»ped where duties are charged on them, a certified invoice of con- 
tents by the Secretary being sufiicient to pass them through the custom- 
house free of duty. On tlie other hand, all packages addressed to the 
Institution arriving at the ports of the United States are admitted 
without detention, duty free. This system of exchanges is therefore 



10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

the most extensive and efficient which has ever been established in any- 
country." 

The service was immediately taken advantage of by the Bureaus of 
the United States Government, and between the years 1851 and 18G7 
it is estimated that over 20,000 packages of Government publications 
were carried by the exchange service, at an estimated cost to the pri- 
vate funds of the Institution of over $8,000. 

In 1867 Congress recognized the efficiency and importance of this 
branch of the Smithsonian work by assigning to it the duty of exchang- 
ing fifty copies of all documents printed by order of either House of 
Congress, or by the United States Government Bureaus, for similar 
works published in foreign countries, and especially by foreign govern- 
ments. This at once absorbed a very considerable part of the funds 
which it was deemed expedient to devote to exchange purposes; for 
nearly thirteen years the burden of the exi)ense being almost entirely 
borne by the Smithsonian fund. 

It is not necessary to repeat here the details of the exchange rela- 
tions with the Government, as they have been given at length in 
previous reports, but I beg to call attention briefly to the summary 
presented last year in these words : 

The following sums have been expended from the Smithsonian fund 
for the sup])ort of the international exchange system, in the interests 
and by the authority of the National Government, namely, $38,141.01 
in excess of appropriations advanced from January 1, 1868, to June 30, 
1886, for the exchange of official Government documents, and $7,031.81 
in excess of appropriations from July 1, 1886, to June 30, 1889, advanced 
for the purpose of carrying out a convention entered into by the United 
States, or an aggregate of $45,175.82. 

No account is here made of the rent value of the rooms occupied by 
the exchange bureau, though the rooms are urgently needed for the 
special purposes of the Institution. 

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Eegents, a memoran- 
dum setting forth the above facts was transmitted on the 20tli of May, 
1890, to the Hon. Benjamin Butterworth, a member of the Board, in 
the House of Representatives, for the purpose of taking the necessary 
steps to j)rocure a return by Congress to the Smithsonian fund of the 
sum last mentioned, namely, $45,175.82. 

The value of the exchange service having become widely known and 
appreciated, efforts were made by various countries to establish more 
formal international relations for the purpose of securing an increase in 
its benefits, and on the 15tli of March, 1886, plenipotentiaries from the 
United States and various other nationalities signed a convention at 
Brussels by which their respective governments definitely assumed the 
exchange of official documents and of scientific and literary publica- 
tions between the countries interested. 

Referring now more esj)ecially to the work of the exchange bureau 
during the past year and to its steady and rapid growth, it will be seen 
in the Appendix that no less than 100 tons of books passed through the

the number liandlcd during; the preceding year, IT])on the exchange 
books accounts of publications received and transmitted arekejjt with 
1S,S48 societies, institutions or individuals, 

The expenditures on account of the exchange service have amounted 
to .*! 1*0,382.21, of which 817,000 were appropriated directly by Congress, 
$3,.'301.12 were repaid l)y Government bureaus, and $9.95 were paid by 
State institutions and otliers, leaving" a small deficiency to be met by 
the Smithsonian Institution. 

While the expenses of the exchange service, it will be observed, are 
in the absence of rent charge now nearly met by the sum appropriated 
by the General Government, this end is only effected at the cost of 
dispatchj and even this sh)w freight is in many cases due to the 
liberality of the ocean steamship companies, a fact to which allusion 
lias been made in all recent reports. While there seemed to be no im- 
propriety in accepting the generosity of these companies when it was 
to be regarded as a direct contribution to the philanthropic aims of the 
Institution, it does not seem proper, where so much of the freight now 
carried is Government property and the service is conducted under an 
international treaty, that we should impose on this liberality further, 
yet if this privilege shcmld be withdrawn the service would be most 
seriously cripided. 

An iipprojunatiou is also needed to give effect to the treaty of Brus- 
S(»ls, Avhich calls for an immediate exchange of X)Jirliamentary annals. 
A bill making an appropriation of $2,000, estimated as necessary for 
this pur})<)se, passed the Senate, but failed to come up for consideration 
in the House of Eepresentatives. 

I may mention also that the difficulty of making provision for the 
storage of the suri)lus copies of Government publications intended for 
foreign exchange is each year becoming greater, and it is necessary to 
store many boxes of valuable documents in a basement which past es- 
])erience has shown is liable to be flooded Avith water. This fact I con- 
sider it my duty to bring to the attention of Congress that such action 
as it deems fit may be taken to iirotect this public property, 

LIBRARY. 

The accessions to the library have been recorded and cared for as dur- 
ing the last fiscal year. The following statement shows the number of 
books, maps, and charts received from July 1, 1890, to June 30, 1891 :

12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Of these accessions, 7,720 (namely 424 volmnes, 6,413 parts of volnmes, 
and 883 pamphlets) were retained for nse at the National Museum Li- 
brary, and 754 medical dissertations were deposited in the Library of tlie 
Surgeon-General, U. S. Army; the remainder were promptly sent to the 
Library of Congress on the Monday following their receipt. 

The reading room continues to be well used by those who have occa- 
sion to consult the current scientific literature. As the number of boxes 
available for holding periodicals is strictly limited by the size of the 
room the only way to make room for the installation of new and desirable 
journals is to remove those which are found to be least consulted or which 
have ceased publication during the year. This was done by the librarian 
during the spring of 1891. 

Four hundred and fifty-six boxes are now occupied, leaving sixteen 
to be filled by new accessions during the next fiscal year. Of the' 
journals removed from the reading room, such as would be of perma- 
nent use in tlie scientific work of the Institution were transferred to the 
Library of the National Museum ; the remainder were forwarded to the 
Library of Congress. 

It will be remembered that when I first became connected with the 
Institution as assistant secretary I formulated a plan, the details of 
which will be found in my report for 1887-'88, for enlarging the acces- 
sions to the library so as to cover more completely the field of scientific 
knowledge, and also for completing the series of scientific journals 
already in the possession of the Institution which for any reason are 
imperfect. 

As stated in my report for 1889, the work of executing the plan was 
commenced on June 1 of that year and has been assiduously carried 
on ever since. It is now rapidly approaching completion, and it is esti- 
mated that it will require but a few months of the next fiscal year to 
bring the work as originally planned to a termination. So rapid, how- 
ever, has been the advance of scientific thought in the interval since the 
preparation of the list that, although the utmost vigilance has been ex- 
ercised in watching for the appearance of new scientific journals, it is 
probable that very many such have newly appeared which have escaped 
notice. A certain amount of supplementary work will, therefore, be re- 
quired to make the exchange lists conform with the present status of 
the periodical literature of science and in a very minor degree of art. 

A list of the new exchanges will be found in the Appendix (Eeport 
of the Librarian), which also includes a list of important accessions 
outside of the regular serials. 

It may be remembered that in my report for 1887-'88, I spoke of a 
certain limited number of books, not forming part of the Smithsonian 
deposit in the Library of Congress, obtained by liurchase from the 
Smithsonian fund and retained at the Institution under the name of 
the "Secretary's Library." 

These books are mostly, but not exclusively, books of scientific refer- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13 

ence, certain art serials being included araonj? them, and though all are 
kept in the Secretary's office they are at the service, under certain neces- 
sary restrictions, of all connected Avith the Institution. 

This collection uund)ers at present nearly 300 volumes, and while it 
would be highly desirable to enlarge it still further, this is rendered 
almost iiii])racticable,becaus(^tlie Secretary's office is already filled nearly 
to its utmost capacity. It is not possible either to i)lace the collection 
of works of reference under the immediate charge of the librarian, as 
the rooms wliich lie occu])ics are already over-crowded, while the room 
on the same floor, whicli would naturally be the one to which the library 
would be extended, is occupied as a shipping office by the Bureau of 
International Exchanges. 

It is to be hoped in the interest of tlie library, then, as well as of the 
Bureau itself, that Congress will provide the additional quarters which 
have been asked for the latter. 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

Portraits of Rcf/enfft. — The Institution is under obligation to the Chief 
of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing for copies of engraved por- 
traits of several former Eegents of the Institution, which had been pre- 
pared for official j^urposes. 

Statue of Ixohcit Dale Owen. — A bill appropriating $20,000 for a statue 
of Hon. Bobert Dale Owen, of Indiana, who was among the first and 
most actively interested Regents of the Institution, was introduced 
in the Senate on December 9, 1800, by the Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees, and 
was passed on the same day by the Senate, but failed to secure favor- 
able action in the House of Representatives. 

Statue of Prof. Baird. — I have the honor again to call the attention 
of the Regents to the bill which was passed by the Senate in February, 
1S88, providing for a bronze statue of Prof. Baird in recognition of tlie 
distinguished services rendered Ms country, and I venture to express 
the hoi)e that this subject may receive the earnest consideration of his 
many warm friends in both Houses of Congress. 

Gapron collection of Japanese worlcs of art. — An appropriation of 
810,000 for the purcliase of the Capron collection, which has been for 
several years on deposit in the Museum, was included in the sundry civil 
act for the year 1891-'92, thereby securing this valuable collection of 
Japanese works of art to the Government. 

Perkins collection of prehistoric iniplenients. — The deficiency bill ap- 
proved October 1, 1800, contained an appropriation of $7,000 to enable 
the vSecretary of the Smithsonian Institution to purchase of Mr. Fred- 
erick S, Perkins his collection of prehistoric implements. This sum 
was duly paid to Mr. Perkins and the collection received and deposited 
in the National Museum. 

MeteoroUnjical records. — In accordance with arrangements made with 
the Chief Signal Officer, U. S. Army, Gen. A. W. Greely, the meteoro- 



14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY: 

logical records, forming- a portion of tlie archives of the Smithsonian 
Institution, and representing a considerable amount of work accom- 
plished by it in earlier days, have been temjiorarily transferred to the 
Signal Office, and deposited there in a fireproof vault for custody and 
storage. These records serve to carry back the meteorological obser- 
vations of the Signal Service as far as the year 1840. They consist of; 

346 bouHtl volumes of inontlily reports by observers from 1840 to 1873, inclusive, 

6 volumes of records made at the Smitlisouiau Institution. 
47 pasteboard boxes of miscellaneons records by locality. 
64 paper packages of miscellaneous records, scrajis, etc. 

15 miscellaneous note-books. 
1 large package of manuscript folio sheets, observations, survey northwestern 
lakes. 

7 royal octavo bound volumes, printed reports. 

Bequest of Br. J. B. Bailey. — Information has been received that Dr. 
J. R. Bailey, late of Olmstead, Ky., has devised his library to the 
Smithsonian Institution, and the necessary steps will be taken to 
acquire possession. 

Assignment of rooms for scientific worJc. — A basement room especially 
suited for delicate physical measurements on account of its freedom 
from tremor has been used by the officers of the United States Coast 
and Geodetic SurA'^ey for making pendulum observations. 

Stereotype plates. — Owing to the more urgent demands of current 
work, but little progress has been made in examining and re-arranging 
the stereotype plates of the publications of the Institution. I hoj^e to 
make arrangements during the coming year to push this work to an 
early completion. 

The stereotype plates and engravers' blocks are cheerfully placed at 
the disj)osal of publishers for supplementing or illustrating scientific 
works privately issued. 

U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

In my representations to Congress during recent years I have felt 
called upon to insist upon two points : First, that the collections have 
increased so rapidly that additional space is required for their proper 
administration, and that unless more space be provided, the growth of 
the national collections must, to a large extent, be interfered with; 
and secondly, that the collections, although growing rapidly in certain 
directions, are not developing in such a symmetrical and consistent 
manner as is essential to the necessities of the work. 

I feel justified in assuming that it is the intention of Congress that 
the National Museum of tlie United States shall be, as far as a museum 
can be, a worthy exponent of the natural resources and scientific 
achievements of the nation, that it shall be worthy of the attention of 
visitors to the capital, and that it shall perform its i)roj)er functions 
as one of the scientific departments of the Government, and shall also 



KEPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 15 

promote the scientific and e<liicational interests of the country at kirg-e. 
This being granted, it is essential not only that the (collections should 
grow, and grow rapidly, in order to keep pace with the material and 
intellectual development of the country, but also tluit a competent staff 
of curators should be constantly at work, developing by scientific study 
and publishing under the auspices of the Government the f^u'ts which 
are essential to the <3orrect understanding of the material under their 
charge, preserving the collections from destruction, and arranging and 
classifying them in such a manner that they shall be immediately ac- 
cessible to the students of science from all j)arts of tliis country and 
from abroad, wlio are constantly visiting Washington for the purpose 
of consulting the collections of the Government in connection with their 
own scientific studies. 

On this account it is a critical time in the history of the Museum. 
Such is the competition for material that the N^ational Museum of the 
United States is unable to hold its own not only with foreign govern- 
ments and with local museums in other American cities, but is even at 
a disadvantage when its collections are compared with those of many 
private collectors. For instance, there are in this country several pri- 
vate collections of minerals, archaeological objects, as well as of speci- 
mens relating to the various departments of zoology, the promoters of 
which can seemingly afford to pay more for any choice objects needed 
to complete their collections than can the Government of the United 
States. It is somewhat mortifying to see collections of American ob- 
jects, which a few years hence will undoubtedly be recognized by every- 
one as essential to be preserved in the National Museum of this country, 
taken away to foreign countries because their value is more highly 
appreciated there than at home. Whatever may be considered the 
l)roper functions of theXationnl Museum of the United States in regard 
to other matters, it will always be expected that in the national capi- 
tal the collections illustrating ethnology and the natural resources of 
this continent will be fully as imposing as in other similar establish- 
ments, and that tlie national collections should compare fiivctfably with 
those in other American cities, and will in respect to American material 
surpass those in any foreign capital. 

It is not juy wish to depreciate the importance of what has already 
been done by the Government for the advancement of scientific research, 
for in most of the fields in which really serious work has been accom- 
l)lislicd, the National Museum is at least equal, and often superior to, any 
other in the United States, but the eflbrtto maintain the collections on 
this footing will be nmch more difficult hereafter than in the past. It 
would be unfortunate if students of American natural history and ethnol- 
ogy, Nvho have hitherto been obliged to come to Washington in connec- 
tion with their studies, should hereafter find it more advantageous to 
consult private collections in other parts of this country. 

Growth of the collections. — The growth of the national collections 



16 KEPORT OF THE SECEETARY. 

since 1881, when the new building- was completed, has been probably 
H^inprccedented in the history of nuiseuuis ; and this has rendered it nec- 
essary to employ a force of men proportionately larger than is found in 
most museums, in order to utilize the material to the best advantage. 
-Notwithstanding this fact, the aggregate appropriation made by the 
United States for museum purposes is smaller tlianthat of many foreign 
governments. 

The Museum building 1ms now been occupied one decade, and during 
this time the total number of specimens of all kinds catalogued and 
ready for exhibition or study has increased from about 193^000 to more 
than 3,000,000. 

Guratorships. — The scieutiiic departments of the Museum are not yet 
all supplied with curators. The number of separate departments and 
sections is now 33, and less than one-third of this number is under the 
charge of curators paid from the Museum fund and able Therefore to 
devote all their time to Museum work. By far the larger number of 
the scientific departments is under the charge of of&cers of other depart- 
ments of the Government service (for instance, the Geological Survey, 
the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Ethnology, and the Fish 
Commission), who, although they render most important services in the 
way of supervision and general direction of the work, are necessarily 
so occupied with their own peculiar administrative duties, that they can 
not devote very much of tlieir time to the development of the collec- 
tions under their charge. Three important zoological departments have 
for a great many years been under the charge of oflicers of the Fish 
Commission. Under the administration of Professor Baird, who was 
at once Commissioner and head of the Museum, it was considered proper 
that they should give a considerable portion of their time to Museum 
work, which was directly tributary to the results which Professor Baird 
was desirous of producing in connection with the service under his 
•charge. Soon after the death of Professor Baird it became necessary 
for these men, although still retaining their positions as honorary cura- 
tors in the Museum, to devote nearly all of their time and attention to 
matters relating to the Fish Commission. If it were possible to em^jloy 
exj)erienced men as assistants in these departments, as well as under 
the other honorary curators, important advantages would manifestly 
result. At all events, it is absolutely necessary to have a curator or 
assistant curator appointed to take charge of the work in each depart- 
ment, in order that the material collected at considerable expense by 
the Government shall be properly arranged and identified, and that the 
results of the work shalll be published for the advancement of science. 
This, however, can not be done until Congress shall see fit to make 
more liberal appropriations for the maintenance of the Museum. 

Increase in correspondence. — Within the iDast three years there has 
been an astonishingly large increase in the number of calls upon the 



KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17 

Museum, very largely by Members of Congress iiud through them by 
their eoustitueuts, for scieutifle iuformatiou of all kinds, for collections 
in various dei)artmeuts of natural history (scientihcally arranged and 
named, for the use of schools and colleges), for books and services of 
many kinds, including the examination and identification of minerals, 
ores, animals, plants, etc. It is quite safe to say that during the last 
thi-ee or four years the correspondence of the Museum has quadrupled. 
Special pains have been taken not only to reply to all communica- 
tions in full and with great care, but to reply promptly, in accordance 
with the (constantly increasing demands for rapid action on the part 
of the public officers in Washington. 

Salaries. — The salaries paid to em])loyes, especially clerks, copyists, and 
skilled mechanics, are much less than those which are paid for similar 
services in the Executive Departments. Many of our most useful assist- 
ants have been drawn away from the staff and called to places in the 
Executive l)ei)artments, where, although the responsibilities are no 
greater, they receive much larger rates of pay. It is quite essential 
for the efficiency of the service that the stipend of persons of this class 
should be increased — not nec;essarily to the amounts curreu t in the Execu- 
tive Departments, but to such figures as will render it possible to retain 
useful employes after they have been laboriously trained and prepared 
for their work. Within a year or two, three stenographers and type- 
writers have been diawn away from the office of the Assistant Secretary 
in charge of the Aluseum. 

Meed of additional assistance. — It is absolutely necessary to have the 
collections taken care of as fast as they are received, and although they 
can not all be prepared for exhibition, owing to lack of assistance as well 
as want of exhibition space, yet the mere preservation of the specimens 
from d«vstruction implies very great labor, especially in the case of 
zoo logi(%d objects. Taking into consideration the fact that there are now 
about thirty-three distinct scientific departments in the Museum, to each 
of which, on an average, three persons at least are attached, it will be 
readily understood that, alter all the exi)enses have been met for the 
preservation, care, and exhibition of the specimens, very little remains 
for maintaining the administrative force. Tlie need of additional intel- 
ligent clerical assistance is felt in every branch of the administrative 
work. For instance, to the regular duties of tlie chief clerk's office has 
bi'cn necessarily added the management of the financial matters con- 
nected with the preparation of tlie exhibit for the World's Columbian 
Exposition. In the division of correspondence the increase of work has 
been very great, and no less than 10,000 letters are now required to be 
written where 2,500 sufficed only a very few years ago. A similar in- 
crease of work miglit be cited in all the other administrative offices, but 
the means for providing adequate assistance are not at hand. In this 
way it has happened that the appropriations have been largely used in the 
maintenance of the scientific departments to the great disadvantage and

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 



impairmeut of the administrative work of the Museum. These matters 
have already been represented in strong terms in previous reports, and 
the Secretary has taken every avaihxble means of calling attention to 
the dangers which beset the National Museum owing to the insufS- 
ciency of the appropriations made by Congress for its maintenance. It 
is only necessary to add in this place that the sum mentioned in the 
statement accompanying the report for 1889 (pp. 35-38), as then required 
for services, was prepared in response to a Senate resolution asking for 
a " schedule of the classified service of the officers and employes of the 
National Museum," and represented the needs of the Museum at that 
time. Since then there have been large increases in almost every de- 
partment of the Museum work, and if I were now preparing a similar 
statement, I should find it necessary to make a corresponding increase 
in the totals of the several divisions of the schedule referred to. 

The operations of the Museum in all of its departments for the fiscal 
year ending June 30, 1891, are fully discussed in the report of the Assist- 
ant Secretary in charge of the Museum, and therefore reference to the 
work of the Museum will here be restricted to some of the most impor- 
tant general features. 

Accessions. — Ten years ago the National Museum moved into a new 
building, and the present year thus marks the close of a very important 
decade in its history. The increase in the collections during this period 
has been unexpectedly large, the accessions from all sources now num- 
bering 3,028,714 specimens. In 1882, when the first census of the col- 
ections was made, the total number of specimens was estimated at less 
than 195,000. The totally inadequate space provided for this vast accu- 
mulation of material has been so frequently commented upon in pre- 
vious reports, that it is not necessary to reiterate the urgent recom- 
mendajiions which have been made to Congress for another building.

2 The actual increase in the collections during the year 1889-'90 is much greater than appears from 
aconipitiisiiii of' Mil' totals for 1889 and t'or IsiK). This is explained by the apparent absence of any 
increase in the DeiiartiiK^nts of Litholoiry ami Metallurgy, the total for 1890 in both of these depart- 
ments eoiiiliiiied showing a decrease of 4ti,:!U s]ieeinieus, owing to the rejection of worthless material. 

3 Although about 200 specimens have been received during the year, the total number of specimens 
in the collection is now less tlian that estimated for 1889, owing to the rejection of worthless material. 

* The collection now contains between 3,000 and 4,000 specimens. 

* No estimate of increase made in 1890 or 1891.

I Xo census of rollectitm taken. 

'•'The aitual inerea.se in the collections during the year ]889-'90 is much greater than appears from 
a comjiariscui of the totals for 1889 and for 1800. Tftis is explained by the apparent absence of any 
increase in the De])artinents of Lithology and Metallurgy, the total for 1890 in both of these depart- 
ments coniliined showing a decrease of 46,314 specimens, owing to the nyection of worthless material. 

* Included in the historical collection. 

*t)nlvasniall iiortion of the collection represented by this number was received during the year 
1889-'90. 

* Uj) to 1890 the numbers have reference only to specimens reieived throngh the Museum, and do 
not include sjiecimens received for the National Herbarium thrruigli t lie l)e]>artment of Agriculture. 

The Hgures given for 1890-'91 include for the tirst time tlw total iiunilier of spfcimens received both 
at the National Aliiseum and at the Itejiartment of Agricultmro for the National llerbaritim. 

* Collections coiuhiiu'd in October, 1SS9, uiuler Department of Geology. The ajiparent decrease of 
more than. "SO per cent of the estimated total for 1889 is accounted for (1) by tlie rejection of several 
thousands of speciuiiiis from the collection, and (2) by the fact that no estimate of the specimens 
in the re.servc and iluplicate series is included. Of the total for 1890, about 16,000 specimens consist 
cliietiv of petrograpliical material stored away for study and comi)arisou in the drawers of table cases. 

'Transferred to tlie Xaticuial Zoological I'ark. 

NoTU.— The fact that tbt^ ligiires for two suc<'essive years relating to the same collection are un- 
changed does not necessarily imply that there has been lio increase in the collection, but that for some 
special reason it has not been possible to obtain the figures showing the increase. 



20 KEPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 

The World's Columbian Exposition. — Mention was made in the last 
report of the provision made by Congress for holding an exposition in 
the city of Chicago in 1893 for the purpose of celebrating the four hun- 
dredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Colum- 
bus. Dr. G. Brown Goode was upon my nomination appointed by the 
President the representative of the Smithsonian Institution and the 
National Museum upon the Government Board of Managers and Con- 
trol. During the latter part of the year the Treasury Department de- 
cided that between $30,000 and 140,000 were available for expendi- 
ture in connection with the preparation of the Government exhibits. 
This sum was apportioned by the Board among the executive depart- 
ments, including the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum 
and the Fish Commission: the Smithsonian Institution, including the 
National Museum and the Bureau of Ethnology, receiving about 
$0,000. This amount is of course entirely inadequate, except as afford- 
ing the means of making a commencement, and would hardly suf- 
fice for the preparation of a satisfactory exhibit from any one depart- 
ment in the Museum. As soon as this money became available, how- 
ever, several of the curators in the National Museum commenced to 
prepare plans for the exhibits of their departments, and a small force 
of taxidermists and mechanics was engaged. Mr. E. Edward Earll 
was appointed chief special agent in April, and will act as the executive 
officer under the direction of the representative of the Smithsonian In- 
stitution. 

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. 

Ethnological researches among the North American Indians has been 
continued by the Smithsonian Institution in compliance with acts of 
Congress, during the year 1890-'91, under the direction of Maj. J. W. 
Powell, who is also the Director of the U. S. Geological Siu^vey. 

The work of the Bureau of Ethnology has been conducted during the 
year in accordance with the system before reported upon and explained. 
A noteworthy feature of it is that the officers who as authors prepare 
the publications of the Bureau personally gather the material for them 
in the field, supplementing it by study of all the connected literature 
and by the consequent comparison of all ascertained facts. The contin- 
uance of the work for a number of years by the same zealous observers 
and students, who freely interchange their information and -opinions, has 
resulted in their training with the acuteness of specialists, corrected and 
generalized by the factors of other correlative specialties. 

At the close of the last fiscal year specific exploration of the mound 
areaby theUnited States ceased, except so far as it wasfound necessary to 
correct errors and supply omissions. A large part of the results of the 
work of several past years is in print, though not yet issued. A plan 
of general archaeologic field work has been practically initiated by a 
systematic exploration of the tidewater regions of the District of Colum- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21 

bia, Maryland, Virginia, and the Ohio \'alley, which determined among 
other ])()ints of intere.st that the implication of great antiqnity to forms 
of stone implements of America wliich have liitherlo been classed with 
European palffioliths in age as well as in fabrication has not been sub- 
stantiated by the ascertamed lacts. 

Careful exploration of the Verde Valley in Arizona followed that be- 
fore made of other parts of the large southwestern region of the United 
States in which the presence of many extensive ruins has given rise to 
ftmciful theories. The data as classified and discussed has shown that 
the hypothesis of a vanished race enjoying high civilization, which has 
been proposed to account for the architecture of the ruined structures, 
is unnecessary. 

The attention already given to Indian languages has been continued, 
in recognition of tlie fact that some of them are fast passing beyond the 
possibility of record and study and that the ethnic classification of all 
of the Indian tribes can be made accurate only through the determina- 
tion of their linguistic divisions and connections. The studies u^jou 
aboriginal mythology and religious practices has also been continued, 
with special attention to the ghost dances and "Messiah religion," 
which have produced important consequences bearing upon the prob- 
lem of proper national dealing with the Indians. Official misconcep- 
tion of their religious philosophy, which has been forcedly transfigured 
by the absorption of Christianity so as to present more apj)arent than 
actual antagonism to civilization, has occasioned needless loss of life 
and treasure. 

Further details respecting the work of the Bureau will l^e found in 
the report of its director, given in full in the Appendix. 

]SrATIO:N^AL ZOOLOGICAL PARK. 

The primary object for which Congress was asked to establish a 
National Zoological Park was to secure the preservation of those 
American animals that are already nearly extinct, and this object it 
was thought would be best secured by the establishment of a large 
inclosure in which such animals could be ke])t in a seclusion as nearly 
as possible like that of their native haunts. It was believed that, 
except for initial exjienses for buildings and roads for the public, 
tins could be done with an outlay comparatively small, probably not 
exceeding $50,000 a year; for, after the necessary land was once acquired 
and fenced in, smaller inclosures and paddocks could be set off and 
inexpensive barns erected at about this yearly charge. 

It was, in the nature of things, inevitable that some provision should 
be made for the convenience of a curious and interested public, as well 
as for the care and well being of animals unaccustomed to the pres- 
ence of man. For the first of these it was intended to set aside a con- 
siderable area, on which the jirincipal buildings should be placed and 



22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

to wliicli slioulcl be taken, as was expedient, such of the animals as 
might interest the public, the larger portion of the park being still 
considered as a natiu'al preserve where animals need be disturbed by 
no unusual surroundings, and where it was hoped they might, after the 
time necessary for their acclimation, breed their young. 

The maintenance of a park devoted to these purposes, that is, pri- 
marily to useful and scientific ends, and secondly to recreation, seemed 
to those interested in its success a legitimate tax upon national re- 
sources, but when Congress decided that one-half of the necessary 
expense should be raised by local taxation it seemed only fit that the 
tax-payers should be heard in their wish to have prominence given to 
the feature that principally interested them, and their chief interest was 
naturally in the Park as a place of recreation. That this was recog- 
nized by a considerable body in Congress became evident from the 
subsequent debates. 

The moral right of the people of the District to ask consideration 
of their wishes for entertainment in return for the outlay which falls 
upon them can not be questioned, and so far as this could be recog- 
nized it introduced a tendency to provide an establishment more like 
an ordinary zoological garden, or permanent menagerie, than the com- 
paratively inexpensive scheme at first contemplated. 

In view of the circumstances an appropriation was asked of Con- 
gress, which was believed to be smaller than was consistent with the 
proper ultimate development of the park, but on an estimate which 
proposed to begin on the most economical scale. Thus, for the general 
maintenance of the collection, $35,000 was asked, which is about the 
same as the annual sum spent in the Central Park menagerie, JS^ew 
York, having an area of about 10 acres, and at least $10,000 less than is 
spent either at the zoological garden in Cincinnati or Philadelphia, each 
having an area of about 40 acres. When it is reflected that these 
latter enterprises are conducted for business purposes by business men, 
that they have their collections already nearly complete and purchase 
but few new animals, it will be seen that the sum asked for the main- 
tenance of the 167 acres of the National Zoological Park with all the 
expensive animals yet to be procured was certainly not extravagant. 
Congress reduced this estimate to $17,500, a sum for which as a year's 
experience has now shown the Park can not be maintained. 

For buildings, an appropriation of $30,850 was asked. In this con- 
nection it may be recalled that in the Philadelphia gardens the build- 
ings and inclosures cost $194,705. The sum estimated was intended to 
cover all inclosures and structures of every character indispensable on 
the modest scale proposed. Congress reduced this to $18,000. 

The average expense of preparing such uncultivated grounds in city 
parks elsewhere has proved to be at least $2,900 per acre. The sum of 
),500 was asked for that purpose, as no more than sufficient to fit 



REPORT OF THP: SECRETARY. 23 

siif'h iiortions of the i)aik as were necessary for the immediate accom- 
modation of the public. Congress reduced this to $15,000, 

These reductions have not only obliged me to retard the development 
on the lines that had been laid down, but have increased the ultimate 
cost; for where living creatures are in question it is plain that they 
have not only to be fed and guarded but to be housed^ and all this at 
once, under penalty of their loss. Congress has plainly intended that 
they sh(»ul(l be pi^served, and that some sort of roads and access for 
the public should be provided this year. 

The result has necessarily been, that with every effort to obtain per- 
manent results there has been a partial expenditure of the absolutely 
insufficient grant on enforced expedients of a temporary character, 
which are not in the interests of economy. 

It is extremely desirable that a sum for emergencies be secured in 
the next appiopriation. In carrying forward from the beginning novel 
and untried work of such varied character, unforeseen difficulties must 
inevitably arise, but no provision has been made for these, nor even for 
such readily antici]>ated emergencies as are caused, for instance, by 
floods in grounds traversed by a stream which has been known to rise 
G feet in less than half an hour. 

The difficulties which these conditions have imposed on the adminis- 
tration of the i)ark may ))e fairly called extreme, and the amount and 
character of what has been effected must be considered in this con- 
nection. In spite of these the result, I think, may be said to be, that at 
least as a source of interest and amusement to the people the park has 
exceeded the most sanguine expectations. 

As tlu^, available funds were small it was necessary to limit the area 
of the [)ark which should be first improved. It was found that the ani- 
mals ou hand could be accommodated within an area of 40 acres, and a 
tract of about that size was selected, extending along the main drive 
from Quarry road to Connecticut avenue through the most interesting 
portion of the park. This main road was laid out, graded, and metalled 
early in the fiscal year, and steps were taken to construct a ]iermauent 
bi'idge over Rock Creek at the place where the road should ])ass. As 
was anticijiated, the construction of the bridge presented serious en- 
gineering difficulties. Kock Creek is usually a quiet shallow stream, 
but becomes in times of freshet a powerful torrent. It was necessary to 
erect a structure that would witlistand these floods and desirable that 
it shoidd l)e one which would not mar the beauty of the valley. After 
a careful consideration of several designs, motives of economy com- 
])elled the erection of a bridge of wood and iron, resting upon stone 
j)iers I.~) feet above ordinary water level, sufficient as an engineering 
structure but having no <'laiin to beauty other than that of utility. At 
the close of the year these piers liad been erected and the superstruc- 
ture contracted for but not yet placed. In the meantime temporary in- 



24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

expensive wooden bridges have been in use. During tlie progress of 
the worli they have been several times swept away or seriously injured. 

A number of trees have been x)lanted in different parts of the park, 
in some i)laces for ornament, in otliers to secure the proper seclusion of 
animals. A considerable area of open land has been prepared for lawn 
and pasture grc^unds. 

The development of the park has proceeded steadily during the year, 
the minimum of change in the natural features of the picturesque region 
being made on principle and independent of any considerations of 
economy. As the approach from the city by the way of the Quarry 
road could be made available at the least expense to the park, that 
road is adopted provisionally as the main carriage entrance. At the 
request of the Secretary the Commissioners of the District of Columbia 
expended a sum of $1,000 in grading and repairing this road, but while 
it has served a useful purpose it is still far from satisfactory as a prin- 
cipal avenue of approach. The grade is steep, the carriage way nar- 
row, and the roadbed not sufficiently thick to endure heavy travel. 

The system of roads contemplates other means of approach, especially 
a bridle path by the way of Ontario avenue, a footpath (which will 
probably be enlarged to a carriage road as means may permit) by the 
way of Woodley Bridge, extending along the creek through the park 
as far as the Klingle Bridge, and a carriage road entering from Con- 
necticut avenue extended on the west side of the park, by which per- 
sons brought by the Kock Creek Railway can readily pass in. A wind- 
ing footpath from the Adams Mill road leads by means of rudely con- 
structed steps and a simple rustic bridge down the cliffs and across a 
narrow ravine into the occupied portion of the park. 

Before animals could be safely kept in the park, it was necessary to 
inclose it so as to insure control of all the territory within its limits. 
A boundary fence was therefore built, and experience has shown it to 
be absolutely essential to the safety and well-being of the animals as 
well as to the preservation of the trees, shrubbery, and property of the 
park. 

Near what is for the present the j^rincipal entrance is a disused 
quarry, from which arise precipitous cliffs and bold rocky ledges. It 
seemed particularly well fitted for the construction of dens and yards 
for bears. A series of caverns has been blasted in the rock and inclosed 
by a stout iron fence. Within the fence are large and commodious 
yards in which have been constructed bathing pools, with water flow- 
ing constantly from a large spring outside the park at the side of Quarry 
road. The result has been a place admirably adapted for the health 
and general welfare of the animals, as well as a most picturesque and 
striking feature. It has been found necessary, in order to protect the 
yards from falling dirt and debris swept down the cliffs by rains, to build 
a retaining wall on the ledge above the dens at once, and this has been 
done in part, for the reasons already stated, in such a manner as it is to 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. " 25 

be feared -^ill necessitat(? very early removal. It is most desirable that 
the boundary of the park, which now runs along the very edge of this 
precipice, should be carried back a few yards to thus avoid the expense 
of a costly permanent retaining wall. 

A house for the bison has been built and another for animals re- 
quiring warmer winter quarters is in course of construction, a portion 
of it being already occupied. It will not be possible to complete this 
house upon the original plan under the present appropriation, but it 
was deemed a wise economy to accept a design which could be par- 
tially completed and extended as the need for more room became 
])ressiMgiind other means should become available. 

Already the establishment in the United States of a National Zoolog- 
ical Park under the management and guidance of the Smithsonian In- 
stitution has attracted the attention of similar institutions and of nat- 
uralists in other countries, and liberal offers of gifts and exchanges 
have been made. 

Prom Sumatra, from the islands of the Pacific, from the shores of 
Alaska, ami from our own national jiarks, have come offers of gifts or 
terms of purchase, but 1 regret to say that it has been necessary to 
defer acceptance of all these offers owing to lack of funds even to pay 
transportation. 

NECKOLOGY. 

GEORGE BANCROFT. 

It seems unnecessary to give here more than a brief outline of the 
connection of the distinguished historiau, the Hon. George Bancroft, 
Mith the Smitlisonian Institution. 

Ur. Bancroft was elecjted by Congress a regent from the city of Wash- 
ington, December 11, 1874. He was appointed chairman of a special 
comnuttee to memorialize Congress for a building for the National Mu- 
seum; he served on a committee under whose direction a portrait of 
Prof. Henry was painted, and on January 20, 1875, was elected a mem- 
ber of the executive committee. He resigned from the Board in March, 
1878, after serving four years. JMr. Bancroft died on January 17, 1891. 

WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN. 

As in the case of Mr. Bancroft, any extended notice of the life of 
Gen. Sherman would seem entirely superfluous, but it is fitting that I 
should nu'ution here his interested and valuable services upon the 
Board of Kegents. 

Gen. Sherman was elected by Congress a regent from the city of 
Washington, January 30, 1871, and became a member of the executive 
committee of the Board, March i) of the same year. His resignation from 
the Board Avas presented November 12, 1871, on account of a change of 
residence from Washington to St. Louis. 



26 * REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

The following extract from his letter of resiguation expresses his deep 
interest in the Institution and his views as to its policy: 

In thus severing my official connection with the Smithsonian, I beg 
leave to express to you and your associates my sense of the noble task 
in which you are engaged, and of my earnest prayer that the institution 
under your management will continue to fulfill its magnilicent design. 

A knowledge of science, that is, of the laws of nature, is so intimately 
connected with the advance of higher civilization that Mr. Smithsou 
displayed unusual wisdom in so endowing his institution that it sliould 
give its principal labor to the increase of knowledge, to accumulating 
and securing new knowledge to be added to the old, which should be a 
special province of the universities of the whole earth. 1 therefore coin- 
cide with you perfectly in your special construction of the will, and hope 
that the Regents will continue to construe it literally as a legacy sacred 
in its nature and beneficial in the highest degree. 

I beg you will assure your associates that among the many causes of 
regret at leaving Washington none impresses me more than that which 
forces me to sever my relations with the Eegents of the Smithsonian 
Institution. 

Upon his return to the capital he was re-elected by Congress a regent 
from the city of Washington, March 25, 1878, and again became a mem- 
ber of the executive committee on May 17 following. He served as 
chairman of a special committee of the Board to make arrangements for 
the funeral ceremonies of Prof. Henry, May 13, 1878, and was elected, 
January 15, 1879, by the Board to make au address at the memorial 
services of Prof Henry in the United States Capitol. A few extracts 
from his address at the services on January 10, 1879, are eminently 
characteristic, and may be most appropriately quoted here : 

From the beginning the living have x)aid homage to the virtues of the 
dead; for immortality is the dream of man. From Agra to Washing- 
ton scarceacity, town, or village but contains some monument designed 
to perpetuate the memory of one who has passed from earth. Moun- 
tains have been excavated, pyramids built, temples have been erected, 
and granite, marble, and bronze shaped into every conceivable form to 
give expression to honor, respect, affection, and love for some dead hero, 
warrior, statesman, or philosopher. These earthly tributes can be of 
no service to the dead, but they form lasting records of deeds held 
honorable among men; are strong incentives to noble acts in the ijres- 
ent, and mark a steady progress toward that better condition which is 
the ultimate destiny of the human race. 

We are not assembled to-night to shape in marble, or granite, or 
bronze the human form of our countryman and friend, Prof Joseph 
Henry, but in order that those who knew him best may, by simple trib- 
utes of thought and feeling, bear public testimony to the merits of one 
who in our day stood forth a most resplendent tyi)e of moral and intel- 
lectual manhood, and who, with little thought of self, rendered eminent 
service in the cause of mankind. He needs no monument, for where- 
ever man goes or human thought travels the poles and continuous wires 
will remind him that to Prof. Henry of all men we are most indebted 
for the inestimable blessings of the telegraph. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27 

It was a soientific Iilntilisliinaii, a skillful analytical cliemist of Lon- 
don, who conceived the tiionuht and provided the means whereby Prof. 
Henry was enabled to accomplish so much furtlu'r good. Arts may 
have been lost or forgotton, because no longer needed, and the world's 
libraries and universities already possessed in abundance the vast 
accunnilations of knowledge which had for ages been garnered and 
stored away in these valuable repositories of learning, yet nature re- 
mained so i)ountiful that there could be no danger that her fountains 
would be(*ome exhausted, and Mr. Smithson provided for an institution 
Avhich accei)ts all the i)ast, and ])rovides oidy for the future. He en- 
dowed munificently the institution (which bears his name here in 
AVashington) tor collecting new knowledge, and for distributing it to 
all parts of the earth. Great was the conception, generous the endow- 
ment, and fortunate that the execution fell to the lot of Prof. Henry. 
******* 

For this reason the memory of his life and fame should be treasured 
by all as an example to the youth of our land to show that honor and 
fame may be earned in the school of philosophy as well as in the more 
tempting and active scenes of public life. 

j\Iany students, who at this moment are hard at work on their studies 
for the adv;intage of mankind, will feel themselves personally encour- 
aged and honored by the tokens of respect and affection thus paid their 
prototype, Prof. Henry; and their stimulated labors in the cause of 
that science he loved so well will erect to him a monument more lasting 
than of brass or marble. 

On January 17, 1870, Gen. Sherman was elected by the Board a mem- 
ber of the commission for erecting the National Museum building, and 
on March 7 he was chosen chairman of this commission. 

'^ The office of member of this commission," he says in his tirst report, 
presented January 10, 1880, " has been by no means a sinecure, weekly 
meetings having been held with scarcely an interruption from the first 
organization." 

The second report Gen. Sherman presented January 18, 1881, and the 
final report January 2, 1882. In the latter he " begs to refer to the im- 
portant fact that, wliile a building is presented equal in every respect 
to what was anticipated - - - instead of incurring a deficiency, the 
fund has been so managed as to have to its credit an available balance 
of some thousands of dollars." 

Gen. Sherman took a great interest in carrying into effect the act of 
Congress i^roviding for a, statue of Prof. Henry. He was active in in- 
ducing Congress to appropriate money to fireproof the east wing of the 
Smithsonian building, and he was elected January 17, 1883, by the 
Board with tiic chancellor and secretary upon a special commission "to 
act for and in the name of tlie Board in carrying into effect any act of 
Congress which miglit be passed providing for the erection of an addi- 
tional building for the National Museum." 

His second term as regent expired March 25, 1885, when he removed 
his residence to New York. He died February 11, 1801. For eleven 
years Gen. Sherman was diligent, active, attentive, and enthusiastic in 
bis devotion to the Institution.

APPENDIX TO SECRETARY'S REPORT. 



Appendix I. 

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY FOR THE 
YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1891. 

SiH: Ethnologic researches among- the North American Indians were continued, 
under the Secretary of the Smithsoniuu Institution, in compliance with acts of 
Congress, during the year 1890-'91. 

A report upon the work of the year is most conveniently presented under two 
general heads, viz, field work and office Avork. 

fip:ld wokk. 

The field work of the year is divided into (1) archaeology, and (2) general field 
studies, the latter being directed chiefly to religion, technology, and linguistics. 

Archwologic field work. — At the close of the last fiscal year general exploration of 
the mound region was discontinued and the archseologic field work was placed in the 
charge of Mr. W. H. Holmes. During the summer of 1890 he began the work of arch- 
teological exploration in the Atlantic coast States. The ancient quarries of quartzite 
bowlders and of steatite within the District of Columbia were explored and extensive 
excavations were made. This work was continued throughout Jxily, and in August 
a (juarry site near the new U. S. Naval Observatory on a ridge overlooking Rock Creek 
Valley was examined. The phenomena observed upon this site were practically iden- 
tical with those of Piny Branch described in the last annual report. A large area of 
the Potomac bowlder beds, 2 or 3 acres in extent, had been worked over to the depth 
of several feet by the aboriginal quarrymen aud all available bowlders had been 
utilized in the manufacture of leaf-shaped blades. These were probably the blanks 
subsequently specialized as spear aud arrow points, perforators, aud similar instru- 
ments. 

In August Mr. Holmes made a trip to the Mississippi Valley for the purpose of re- 
examining some mound groups not (explored with sufficient care by the assistants 
before intrusted with that work. A week was spent in Grant County, Wis., map- 
ping the remarkable groups of effigy mounds for which that region is noted. Sub- 
sequently he visited Pulaski County, Ark., aud made a survey of the Knapp mounds 
at Toltec Station, whence he proceeded to the vicinity of Hot Springs, Ark., to ex- 
amine the ancient novaculite quarries near that place. Apparently the early inhabi- 
tants had quarried this rock ou an extensive scale and had used it in the manufac- 
ture of spear and arrow points and other articles. The pittings were on a large 
scale, even surpassing those of the District of Columbia quarries, and had generally 
been attributed by white settlers to Spanish gold hunters of an early period. 

In September and October Mr. Holmes resumed his explorations in the District of 
Columbia and extended the work into the valley of the Potomac between Point of 
Rocks and Cumberland, Md., and into the Ohio Valley as far as Allegheny City. A 
trip was next made to the eastern shore of the Chesapeake, aud a very interesting 

29 



30 EEPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 

Indian village site on the Clioptank River, 2 miles below Cambridge,was examined. 
An ancient community of oyster dredgers had been established on a bluff about 20 feet 
above tide level. Subsequently this site was buried by wind-driven sand to the 
depth of 20 feet, and. more recently the waves have encroached upon the land, expos- 
ing a section of the bluff and its buried village site. The most important feature of 
this exposure was the section of an ossuary or burial pit 12 feet in diameter and 5 
feet deep, which had been dug upon the village site and filled with a mass of dis- 
connected human bones, all of which were in an advanced state of decay. They 
were not accompanied by objects of art. 

In April Mr. Holmes made a journey to Bartow County, Ga.., and to Coahoma 
County, Miss., to make necessary observations of the great groups of mounds at 
these points. The principal Bartow County mound belongs to the group known as 
the Etowah group, and is a splendid example of the work of the unidentified build- 
ers. The shape of the great mound is that of a four-sided truncated pyramid but is 
not wholly symmetric. It is 63 feet high and measures about 175 feet across the 
nearly level top. The measurements of the four sides of the base are 380, 330, 360, 
and 350 feet. The slopes are steep, reaching in places 45°, and are broken by two 
decided eccentricities of configuration. On the south is a terrace from 40 to 50 feet 
wide, sloping to the base level of the mound at the east and ending m a nearly level 
platform about 45 feet square at the west end. This platform is about 20 feet lower 
than the mound and does not appear to have had means of communication with its 
summit. This irregular terrace has been called a roadway, l)ut it has more the 
character of an addition to the great mound in process of construction. The other 
eccentricity alluded to is a graded way extending out to the east from the summit 
of the mound, and which to all appearances is the real roadway to the summit. 
This way is 20 or more feet in width, though somewhat broken down by erosion, 
and has a slope of only 21*^. There can be little doubt that this mound was the 
stronghold of the village and that its top was inclosed by a stockade. 

The Carson monnds in Coahoma County, Miss., form a group of unusual interest. 
There are four mounds of large size, two of them being oblong and with thin summits. 
The highest has an elevation of 25 feet. Scattered about these large nu)unds are 
nearly a hundred smaller ones from 1 to 6 feet in height and from 10 to 200 feet in 
diameter, most of which, as refuse indicates, represent house sites. The house floors 
have been of clay well smoothed on the upper surface and the walls and jiossibly the 
coverings have been of clay supported by a framework of canes. The clay has in 
many cases been basked, but whether from design in building or tlirough the de- 
struction of the structure by fire, is not easily determined. There are numerous 
large pits about the border of the site from which the earth used in building the 
mounds has been obtained. The area covered by the village is three-fourths of a 
mile long by half a mile wide. 

In the spring of 1891 Mr. Holmes began the systematic exploration of the tide- 
water regions of Maryland and Virginia, which included a study of the art remains 
and of the phenomena of shell banks and village sites, as well as the mapping of all 
sites which have interest to the historian and the archaeologist. In this work he was 
as ssited by Mr. AVilliam Dinwiddle and for a short period by Mr. Gerard Fowke. 

Through documentary evidence it is known that the tide-water region was occu- 
pied by tribes of Algouquian stock belonging to the Powhatan Confederacy. So 
thoroughly have they occupied this country that along the water courses nearly 
every available site bears evidence of occupation, and in the salt and brackish sec- 
tions of the water courses shell banks — the kitchen-middens of this people — cover the 
shores in almost continuous lines. So numerous were the sites that a careful study 
of all was found to be impracticable, and it was determined to select for detailed 
examination a small number of those that are typical. On the Potomac the follow- 
ing localities have been chosen for a special study: The vicinity of the Little Falls, 
at the head of tide water 5 the site of Smith's town of "Nacotchtank," now Anacos-

tia; "Chapowamsio" Island at the jiioiiUi of the creek of that name; the site of the 
village of ''Potowomeck" on Potomac Creek; the shell deposits of Goose Creek, a 
branch of Port Tobacco River; the great shell mounds of Pope's Creek, and the oys- 
ter dredging stations about the month of Wicomico River. Many sites upon the 
west shore of Chesapeake Bay and on the Patuxeut River; also many village sites 
upon the James, most of them mentioned and located by Capt. John Smith, Avere 
visited and examined. These include "Chesapeac," on Lynnhaven Bay, Virginia, 
"Niinsamund," on Chuckatnck Creek, west of Norfolk; Jamestown Island; "Cha- 
wopo," "Paspahegh," and "Quiyoughcohannock," near Clcarmont; ''Weanock," on 
Eppes Island, opposite City Point; and " Powhatan" just below Richmond. The 
art remains procured from these historic James River sites are identical in nearly 
every respect with the Potomac and Chesapeake relics, a fact which bears strongly 
ni>on the question of the unity of the art remains and the identity of the peoples of 
the tide-water country. 

Mr. Gerard Fowke entered upon his duties as assistant archaeologist on May 1, 1891. 
He began at once the exploration of the James River Valley, and at the close of the 
year was making excavations in an ancient cemetery near Gale, Allegheny County, 
Va. The object of that work, aside from the usual archieologic explorations, is to 
dctennine the western limits of areas occupied by the Algonquian tribes and the 
eastern limitations of the various groups of peojiles belonging to the west. 

As above mentioned, the field work upon mound explorations, which for several 
years had been under the charge of Prof. Cyrus Thomas, was discontinued except so 
far as was found necessary to correct some errors and sujiply some omissions. Mr. 
Henry L. Reynolds was the only one of Uw former assistants in the mound division 
who was retained. He was engaged during the early jiart of the last fiscal year in 
making examinations and resurveys of certain ancient works in Ohio, and in the 
spring of 1891 was sent to South Carolina to examine several important works in 
that State. Owing to severe illness, which terminated in his death (on April 17, 
1891) while in the field, this last trip was unproductive of scientific results. By the 
death of Mr. Reynolds the Bureau has lost a skillful and industrious member, and 
archaology an enthusiastic student. For some time previous to his death, in addi- 
tion to his other duties as assistant to Prof. Thomas, he had been engaged in preparing 
a paper on the prehistoric metallic articles of the mound area. The only other field 
W(uk ])crformcd in relation to the mounds has been above explained. In order to as- 
sist Prof. Thomas in obtaining correct illustrations and plats of certain groups in 
Mississippi, Arkansas, and Wisconsin, which were deemed of more than ordinary 
importance in the study of the archaeology of the mound region, Mr. Holmes visited 
those groups and made careful survey drawings of them, besides collecting impor- 
tant data concerning them. 

Late in November Mr. Cosmos Mindeleft' was ordered to proceed to the Casa 
(irande, on the Gila River, in Arizona, and examine that ruin with a view to its 
])rt'servation as provided for by act of Congress, also to prepare plans and speciflca- 
t ions and make contracts for tlie work. He was further directed to make an exami- 
nation of the valley of the Rio Verde, and collect the data for a report u]ion the 
archa'cdogy of that region. Owing to unforeseen delays the contracts for the Casa 
(irande work were not executed until May 1.5, 1891, and were approved by the Secre- 
tary of the Interior late in June, but subsequently the time for the completion of the 
work Avas extended two mouths. It will l)e completed by October 1. 

During his stay in the vicinity of the Casa (irande Mr. Mindeleft" made surveys of 
the ruin proi)er and of the large ruin of which it forms a part, together with photo- 
graphs, iletailed plans, sketches, and notes, with a view to a detailed re])ort. He 
found, among other results of his examination, that the ruin is now standing to 
within a very few feet of the height it had when built and occupied. 

Pending the execution and approval of the contracts for the Casa Grande woik, 
Mr. Mindelert" made an examination of the valley of the Rio Verde from its nu)Uth 



32 KEPOET OF THE SECRETAKY. 

to Camp Verde ami beyoud. This region had uever been thoroughly examined, and 
it was deemed highly probable that it would prove as rich in archteologic remains 
as the region about Camp Verde. Such, however, proved not to be the case. A 
cliain of settlements was found extending from Camp Verde southward nearly to 
Fort McDowell, but ^the ruins are not so numerous as in the region immediately 
about Camp Verde. About 10 miles below the latter an extensive and well pro- 
served group of cavate dwellings was found. 

The Ifuildings throughout the whole Verde Valley now in ruins were constructed 
of slabs of calcareous rock, or of river bowlders, or of both, and in their construction, 
location, and ground plans are affiliated with the nortliern type, rather than with 
the southern type, of which the best example is the Casa Craude on the Gila River. 
Data for a report upon the ruins in the valley of the Rio Verde, and upon the irri- 
gating ditches and liorticultural systems there jiui'sued, were collected, and will be 
prepared for publication at once. Mr. Mindeleff remained in the held until after the 
close of the fiscal year. 

General Field Studies. — Mrs. Matilda C. Stevenson remained at the Pueblo of Sia, 
New Mexico, from July to September 15, 1890. She was diligently engaged in com- 
pleting her studies of the customs and mythology of the Sia Indians explained in the 
last annual report. Their cosmogony, and the rites of their secret cult societies, were 
made by her special subjects of investigation, witli the view of securing a clearer 
understanding of their mythology and religious practices. 

Dr. W. J. Hoft'nian, in July, visited the Menomonee Reservation at Keshena and the 
Ojibway Reservation at Lake Court Oreilles, Wis. , the Ojibwa Reservation at La Point, 
and the Ottawa Indians at Petoskey, Mich. At Keshena he attended, by request of 
the Indians, the annual ceremony of the Mitawit or Grand Medicine Society, an 
order of shamans or priests professing the power of prophecy, exorcism of demons, 
the cure of disease, and the ability to confer success in the chase. The introductory 
portion of the ritual of initiation of this society embraces the dramatization of the 
Menomonee ideas of cosmogony and the genesis of mankind, the reception by the In- 
dians from the Great Manito of the power of warding olf disease and hunger, and in- 
struction to candidates as to tlie proper mode of living, so as to gain admission into 
the realm presided over by Naq^iote, the wolf, who is brother of Manabush, the 
mediator between the Menomonee and the Great Manito. The services of initiation 
of these ceremonies are preceded by a mortuary ritual lasting one entire night, in 
honor of the deceased member, whose place is filled later on by the initiation of a 
substitute. 

Investigations were made at the Menomonee ceremony to compare it with a similar 
ritual found among the Ojibways. It appears that the Menomonee practices are off- 
shoots from the Ojibway, and also that where the Ojibway shamans repeat certain 
phrases in an archaic form of language, as handed down to them, the Menomonee 
employ Ojibway words and phrases, perhaps to mystify the hearers, or perhaps be- 
cause the ritual was obtained from the Ojibway in that form. The preparation of 
textile materials used in tlie manufacture of tlie several kinds of mats made by the 
Menomonee was also investigated and typical specimens were secured. Water color 
and other sketches were made to illustrate ceremonies, daily avocations, the abor- 
iginal houses, grave boxes, and other objects of interest. 

Upon the completion of his work at the above reservations, Dr. Hoft'man preceded 
to La Point to inquire of the Ojibway shamen concerning certain sacred birch-bark 
cliarts employed by them in the introduction of candidates into the society of sha- 
mans, and also to secure additional information relative to the explanation of picto- 
graphic cosmogony records. He then visited the Ottawa Indians on tlie eastern 
shore of Lake Michigan, near Mackinaw, to ascertain whether the ceremonies of 
the '' Grand Medicine Society" were still practiced by them. This body of Indians 
professes to have discontinued these pagan rites, but assert that a band of the 
Ottawa, living farther south, near Grand Traverse, adheres to the primitive belief, 
and conducts its ceremonies annually. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33 

Mr. James Mooiicy made a short visit in July to the mountain region of Nortli 
Carolina anil Tennessee, the former home of the Cherokees, for the purpose of col- 
lecting additional facts for his monograph upon that tribe. In connection with the 
same work ho had intended to visit tlie Cherokee Nation in the Indian Territory in 
the following winter, but in the meantime the "Messiah religion" had begun to 
attract so much atteutiou that ho was directed to investigate that subject also at 
the same time, as well as to gather more material bearing upon the linguistic affini- 
ties of the Kiowa tribe. He left Washington December 22, and proceeding at once 
to the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Reservation in Indian Territory, where the ghost 
dances were in full i)rogress, remained for several weeks studying the dance, mak- 
ing photographs, and collecting the songs used. This last was the most important 
part of the study, as most of the Messiah religion is embodicid in songs many of 
which go to the root of Indian mythology. That religion is a. remodeling of aborigi- 
nal beliefs as iutlueuced by the ideas of (Jliristianity lately imbil)ed from the white 
man, to be used for the utter confounding of the white man himself. It is in no 
sense a warlike movement. It is somewhat remarkable that the ghost songs in use 
by tlie various tribes are almost all in the language of the Arapahoes, the members of 
that trilx' being the most active projiagators of the new religion and their language 
bring ix'culiarly adajjted to music. 

lie then proceeded to the Kiowa Reservation, where linguistic and other materials 
were obtained, by which it may become possible to finally classify that hitherto 
isolated tribe. Additional ghost-dance material was also collected. After revisit- 
ing the Cherokee Nation, where several weeks were devoted to gathering informa- 
tion, especially in regard to the Indian geography of upper Georgia, he returned to 
Wasliington early in April. 

In accordance with arrangements for the World's Columbian Exposition it was 
♦lecided to make a tribal exhil)it from one of the more primitive prairie tribes. The 
Kiowas were selecited for the ]»urpose and the work was assigned to Mr. Moouey, 
who at once ])repared to return to their reservation. During May and .June he col- 
lected a large variety t)f artich^s illustrative of the home life, arts, dress, and cere- 
monials of the tribe, and was still in the field at the close of the fiscal year. 

OFFICK WORK. 

The Director during the year devoted all the time he could spare from other offi- 
cial (luti(!s to the. c()m})letion of a work on the linguistic families of North America. 
His undertaking to classify the North American languages so as to be of scientific 
value as well as of practical usl^ has 1)een explained in previous reports. This classi- 
ification is recognized to be, when properly made, an indispensable prelimimiry to 
all accurate ethnologic work relating to this continent. The essay, with its accom- 
J)auying linguistic chart, was delivered to the Public Printer during the year, to 
form part of the seventh annual report of this Bureau, though that volume at this 
tlate has not yet been actually issued. 

Col. Garrick Mallery, U. S. Army, during the year, when not occupied in special 
and occasional duties designated by the director, was engaged in arranging for pub- 
lication the material gathered by him during several former years on the general 
theme of pictography. That title is used to embrace all modes of expressing and 
commuuicating thoughts and facts in a durable form witliout reference to sound. 
Such modes of expressi(m being at one time if not still independent of orallanguage, 
the study of their history, evolution, and pra(;tice may assist in the solution of some 
«?thnic and psychic problems, and may verify or modify some theories of anthro- 
pologic import. In the scheme of arrangement for publication the objective exhibi- 
tion of mental concepts by the North American Iiuliaus has been classified with 
proper pred<»minauc<»-, as it has exceeded in interest all others known which have not 
pa^ssed b4\vond the boundaries separating ideograms and emblems fr(un syllabaries 
aud nipli.xljets. In <irder to promote explanation and comparison, however, copies

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

jind (Icsfi-iptious of a. large uumber of petroglyplis aud other forms of pictographs 
found in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, aud in niauy islands liav^e been eollated for 
the publication of- selected and typical illustrations. With the same object, still 
more earnest attention has been directed to the synoptic presentation of illustrations 
from Mexico and Central and South America, as being presumably more closely con- 
nected than is the eastern hemisphere with the similar developments found in the 
present area of the United States, whether enduring ou rocks with authorship un- 
known, or actually in cui-rent use among most of the Indian tribes. At the close of 
the liscal year the treatise was substantially completed, the delay in its delivery to 
the Public Printer, as the contents of one of the forthcoming volumes in the series of 
annual reports of this Bureau, being occasioned by the preparation of the large num- 
ber of illustrations required. 

Mr. Henry W. Henshaw during the entire year devoted his time to administrative 
work and to continuing the preparation of the Dictionary of Indian Tribes, before ex- 
plained in detail. 

Prof. Cyrus Thomas was engaged during the year chiefly in the preparation of the 
second volume of his report on the archaeology of the mound area of the United 
States, and other office work necessary in connection with the publication of a 
bulletin on the list of mound localities, the preparation of maps therefor, and of illus- 
trations for the first volume of his report. When the whole manuscript was taken 
up for examination, preparatory to printing, its bulk was found to be too great for 
one volume. It was then decided to publish the part relating to mound localities in 
a bulletin. As this necessitated some change in the manuscript, the opjiortuuity was 
embraced to incorporate the additional data which had been obtained. The bulletin 
was in print at the close of the year, though not yet issued. 

Mr. W. H. Holmes included in his office work the iireparation for the monographs 
of Prof* Cyrus Thomas of jiapers upon pottery, shell, textile fabrics, pipes, and 
other productions of the mound-building tribes, and the writing of reports upon the 
numerous explorations made during the year. These reports have been brought up 
to date and are on file. He has adopted the policy of preparing reports upon field 
work for file as the work proceeds, and his assistants are expected at the close of each 
separate piece of exploration or unit of study to make a rej)ort upon it of a sufficiently 
finished nature to serve the purpose of record and reference in case of their disability 
or separation from the office. 

Rev. J. Owen Dorsey prepared the index to his monograph. The {['egiha Language- 
Mj^ths, Stories, and Letters, and corrected the proof sheets of the second part of 
that volume. He resumed his work on the (f'egiha-Engiish dictionary, inserting 
many new words occurring in the texts and referring to each new word by page and 
line of the text. He devoted considerable time to the synonymy of the Athapascan, 
Caddoan, Kusan, Sionan, Takilman, and Yakonan families ; comparing authorities, 
writing historical sketches of the tribes, gentes, aud villages of those linguistic 
families, and rearranging all the material, in order to have it ready for printing. 
From December, 1890, to March, 1891, with the aid of a Kwapa delegate in Wash- 
ington, he collected much information resiiectiug the Kwapa or Quapaw tribe, a peo- 
ple closely related to the Omaha aud Ponka, from whom they separated prior to 
1540. Since March, 1891, he has been elaborating that material, which consists of 
about 150 personal names, arranged according to sex and gens, with the meaning of 
the name whenever attainable; over 3,500 entries for a Kwajja-English dictionary 
and several epistles and myths with grammatical and sociologic notes. This material 
will be of great assistance to him in the preparation of the (|!egiha-English diction- 
ary and other jiapers. 

He also prepared for publication the following papers : A study of Siouan cults, 
illustrated with numerous sketches colored by Indians; Omaha and Ponka letters, 
containing the (jftegiha epistles, which could not be published in Contributions to 
North American Ethnology, Vol. vi; an illustrated paper ou Omaha dwellings, fur- 
niture, and implements; a paper on the social organization of the Siouan tribes. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35 

Mr. Albert S. Giitsclu-t duriiijjc the fiscal year was engaged in office work only. 
Aftflt having completed the manuscript of the "Ethnographic Sketch " of his work, 
"Tlie Klamath Indians of Southwestern Oregon," which was published during tlip* 
year as A'^ol. ii. Part i, of Contributions to North American Ethnology, ho read the 
proof of it, which was completed in October, 1890. Since then he has been extract- 
ing, copying, and carding the vocabularies and other matter collected by him during 
the past ten years. This work is now accomplished concerning the Tonkawe, the 
Hitchiti, the Shawano, and Powhatan. That relative to the Creek, will soon be com- 
pleted. A large number of personal tribal and vocal names of Indian origin were 
collected and partly explained in the intervals of the above work. 

Dr. W. .1. Hoffman continued tlm arrangement and classification of material relat- 
tiug to tlie society of shamans of the Ojibwa Indians, which, together with numer- 
ous illustrations, was prepared for publication, and will form part of the Seventh 
Annual Report of the Bureau. This work will present from aboriginal records an 
exposition of the Ojibwa traditions of cosmogony and genesis and the dramatized 
ritual of the myths relating to the same. Tlie musical notation of the songs and 
chants employed before and during the ceremonies of initiation, and copies of all of 
the birch-bark charts bearing the mnemonic characters relating to the ritual will 
1)0 incorporated in the paper, together with the original texts. Dr. Hoffman has 
also been engaged in the elaboration of the data and sketches relating to the pic- 
tography and gesture language of the North American Indians, secured by him 
during previous field seasons. 

Mr. James Mooney devoted the earlier part of the fiscal year to the elaboration of 
his CheroktM' nuiterial, the first results of which, under the title of " Sacred Formu- 
las of the Cherokees," will appear in the Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau. He 
also prepared a short descriptive catalogue of his previous ethnologic collections 
from the Cherokees, and began work on a paper contending that the South Atlantic 
States were formerly occupied by a number of Siouan tribes, if indeed that region 
was not the original home of the Siouan stock. In connection with this investiga- 
tion a closer study of the linguistic material from the Catawban tribes of Carolina 
coufirms the statement which has before been published by this Bureau, that they 
belonged to the Siouan family. Mr. Mooney also at intervals assisted on the Dic- 
tionary of Tribal Synonymy. 

Mr. James C. Pilling has continued his bibliographic work throughout the fiscal 
year. At the date of tlie last report he was engaged in reading proof of the Bibli- 
ography of the Algoufiuian Laugnagcs. The volume is now ready for the press, and 
will include (ill pages and 82 full page illustrations, chiefly fixcsimiles of the title- 
pages of rare books, syllabaries, and other interesting bibliographic features. It is 
hoped that the work will be ready for distribution during the autumn of 1891. 
Among the special articles in it is one relating to the labors of " Apostle " Eliot 
among the Indians of Massachusetts, and more especially to his linguistic Avork. As 
this author was the earliest and tlie most noted of those engaged in this line of work, 
considerable space was devoted to him and his works, and it was thought proper to 
issue the article in separate form. It is noted below under the heading of Publi- 
cations. 

Mr. Pilling has ceased to be connected with the U. S. Geological Survey, being 
transferreil to the Bureau of Ethnology, his appointment taking eft'ect May 1, 1891. 
The stock or family of languages proposed to form the subject of his next biblio- 
graphic memoir is the Athapascan. 

Mr. J.N. B. Hewitt has continued his work on the Tuskarora dictionary, the Tus- 
k a rora- English part being well advanced and the English-Tuskarora part com- 
menced. Much material for the compilation of a complete grammar of the Tuska- 
rora-Iroquoian tongue was added to that before acquired. For this object such 
anomalous, redundant, and defective verbs as have been recorded in the dictionary 
have been conjugated in all the derivative forms of which they are susceptible; a 
difficult but instructive task. Several regular verbs have also been conjugated to 



36 KEPOKT OF THE 8ECKETARY. 

develop all their kuowu derivative forms. The uumber of possible derivative forms 
of a regular verb in the several couj ligations is estimated by Mr. Hewitt to -vary 
between 2,800 and 3,000. This numeration is of interest, because it has been asserted 
by students of Indian languages that the number of possible derivative forms of an 
American Indian verb is infinite, and, secondly, because it has been estimated that 
a Greek verb so conjugated would be represented by about 1,300 forms. 

Grammatic gender has also received special attention. There are in the Tuskarora- 
Iroquoiau tongue three genders, which Mr. Hewitt names the anthropic, the zoic, 
and the azoic, which are expressed through the prefix pronouns only. In the an- 
thropic gender alone sex distinctions are found, and hence there are masculine and 
feminine pronouns therein. But in the zoic and azoic genders sex is not indicated. 
Hence, by the prefit pronouns the objects of discourse are classified into three 
genders. 

Mr. Hewitt continued making translations from the old French writers, Perrot, 
Lafitau, La Potherie, and others, of the notices and accounts of the beliefs, rites, and 
ceremonies, superstitious, and mythic tales of Iroquoian peoples. These were col- 
lated as aids in explaining and elaborating the matter collected in the field per- 
sonally by liini. By their confirmative testimony, joined to the evidence of etymology, 
the Iroquoian cosmogony or genesis myth is found to originate in the personification 
by the Iroquoian mind of the elements, powers, processes, and the living creatures 
of the visible and sensible world. 

Mrs. Matilda C. Stevenson was engaged from the latter part of September, 1890, 
to June 30, 1891, in preparing for publication the material collected at the Pueblo of 
Sia, New Mexico, during the preceding spring and summer. 

Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff" during the first five months of the fiscal year was occupied 
upon the card catalogue of ruins referred to in the last Anmial Report and in the 
compilation and pre]>aration of maps showing the distribution of ruins in the south- 
western part of the United States. This work was temporarily discontinued late in 
November, when he was ordered into the field, as above explained. 

He also has continued to be in charge of the modeling room. Its force during the 
year was devoted exclusively to the "duplicate series," reference to which has been 
made in previous reports, and no new work was undertaken. Five models were 
added to the series, ranging in size from 16 square feet to 250 square feet, and com- 
prising the following subjects: Mummy Cave Cliff Ruin, Arizona; Pueblo of Walpi, 
Arizona; Pueblo of Sechumovi, Arizona; Ruin of Penasco Blanco, New Mexico; and 
Pit of Nelson Mound. This series is nearing completion, and the Bureau now has 
material sufficient to form the nucleus of an exhibit such as it is often called upon 
to make, without disturbing its series of original models now deposited in the Na- 
tional Museum. It has also a small number of models which can be drawn upon to 
supply the demand for such material in the way of exchange with colleges and 
other scientific institutions. 

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin was occupied with office work exclusively during the year. 
From July 1, 1890, until February 1, 1891, he arranged and copied vocabularies 
which he had previously collected in California, namely, Hupa, Ehuikan, Weitspe- 
kan, Wintu, Yana and Palaihniha'n. He devoted the later months of the year to 
classifying and copying a large number of myths which he had collected among the 
Hupa, Ehuikan and Wintu Indians. These myths are for the greater part connected 
with medicine, though some are creation myths and myths relating to religion and 
the origin of various tribal customs and usages. 

Mr. De Lancey W. Gill continued in charge of the work of preparing and editing 
the illustrations for publications of the Bureau. The work done for the year ending 
Jiine 30, 1891, was as follows: 
Drawings of objects and ethnologic specimens and miscellaneous diagrams. . . 422 

Ancient ruins, earthworks, and landscape drawings 133 

Maps 47 

Total 602 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37 

These drawings were prepared fro7ii field surveys and sketches, from photographs, 
and tVoiii tiie collections brought in by the ethnologists. 

I'hc photograpliic work remains under the able management of Mr. .J. K. Killers. 
Photographic nt!gatives were secured from sittings of Indians representing the fol- 
lowing tribes, viz: Sac and Fox, Senecas, Creek, and Cherokee. From these nega- 
tives 129 prints were furnished. 

PUBIJCATIONS. 

The publications issued during the year are : 

(1) Contributions to North American Ethnology, Volume ii, Parti; The Klamath 
Indians of Southeastern Oregon, by Albert Samuel Gatschet, a quarto volume of cvi -f 
711 pages an<l map. This part includes an ethnographic sketch of the Klamath peo- 
ple, texts of the Klamath language, with explanatory notes, and a grammar of the 
Klamath language. The second part comprises the Klamath-English and Engiish- 
Klamath dictionaries. It was in type at the end of the last fiscal year, but was not 
then received from the Public Printer. 

(2) Bibliographi(; notes on Eliot's Indian Bible and on his other translations and 
works ill the Indian language of Massachusetts. This is an abstract from a " Biblio- 
graphy of the Algonquiau Languages," by .James Constantine Pilling, and forms 
pages 127-181 of the Algouciiiian BiI)liography to l)e soon issued. As separately issued 
these " Notes " constitute a royal octavo pamphlet of 58 separately numbered pages. 
Two hundred and fifty copies were printed and issued. 

It is with profound pleasure that attention is called to this abstract of the work of 
the officers of the Bureau during the term of a single year. By long training, by 
great zeal, and by deep scientific insight, these gentlemen are now able to accomplish 
results far beyond expectations when the Bureau was originally organized. The 
researches in this field have passed beyond the elementary stage, and the significance 
of the data being rapidly gathered becomes more and more a})parent. 
Very resi)ectfully yours, 

J. W. Powell, 
Director, Bureau of Ethnology. 
Mr. S. P. Langlky, 

Secretary SmUhsonian Insfitufion.

EXPENSES. 

The expenses of the Exchange Bnroan are met in part by direct appropriation from 
Congress and in part by approi)riations made to Government Departments or 
Burcans, either in the contingent funds or in specified terms for repayment to the 
Smithsonian Institution of a jiortion of the cost of transportation. To each of the 
Departments or Bureaus sending or receiving publications through the Smithsonian 
Institution a charge of 5 cents per pound weight is made under the authority of a 
rescdntion by the Board of Regents in 1878, this charge being necessary, as the ap- 
])ropriation made by Congress directly to the Institution for exchange purposes has 
never been sutficient to meet the entire cost of the work. For similar reasons it has 
l)een found necessary to make a charge of the same amount to State institutions, from 
whicli a further small anu)unt has been received. 

The direct appropriation by Congress for the year 1890-'91 was in tlie following 
terms: 

For expenses of the system of International Exchanges between the United States 
and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including 
salaries and compensation of all necessary employes, $17,000. 

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting officer of the Smithsonian In- 
stitution on account of International Exchanges, dated July 1, 1891, for the i)reced- 
iug fiscal year, were as follows:

Tlio above table shows that the entire amount received from Government Bureaus 
was $3,371.07, making the sum practically appropriated $20,371.07. Previous reports 
have pointed out the desirability of combining in a single item the various appro- 
priations for the Exchange service, now divided in comparatively small sums among 
several of the large appropriation bills. For the year 1890-'91 an estimate for the 
entire expense of the service of $29,500* was submitted, this sum being intended to 
include these smaller amounts alluded to and also an item of $2,000 to cover the ex- 
pense of an immediate exchange of Parliamentary documents with the countries 
entering into the treaty of Brussels of 1886, as well as to provide for a proper com- 
pensation to several of the larger steamship companies for transportation of freight, 
a service now performed without charge. The amount appropriated was $17,000, an 
increase of $2,000 over that of the preceding fiscal year. 

CORRESPONDENTS. 

The name of each correspondent of the Bureau, whether society, institution, or 
individual, is entered upon a large card, which shows all packages received at the 
Bureau for the person or institution and also the packages sent to the Bureau for 
distribution. These cards have now accumulated to the number of 18,848, divided 
into foreign societies, foreign individuals, domestic societies, and domestic individ- 
uals. The individuals that have died and the societies that have ceased to exist are 
still retained for convenience of reference in the same file.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. 

Under the treaty, the text of which was given in full in Dr. Kidder's Report on 
Exchanges for the year 1887-'88, the exchange of the official puV)lications of the 
United States Government with the other Governments adhering to the treaty, is 
conducted through the Smithsonian Institution Bureau of International Exchanges,

and thin, together ■with the transmi.s,sion abroad of the publications of the various 
departments or bureaus of the Government, now forms a very Large proportion of 
the Bureau's work. 

The entire number of publications sent abroad during the year, under the provi- 
sion of the act of Congress of March 2, 1867, ^v:as 20,683, and there have been received 
ill return 8,836 packages or volumes. The United States Government Departments 
have forwarded to their correspondents abroad through the Bureau 20,041 packages, 
and have received in return 11,764 packages. The total then of the exchanges on 
Government account has been 20,600 packages received, and 40,724 sent abroad, a 
total of 61,324 packages or 07.75 per cent of the total number handled. This ex- 
change on account of the Government Bureaus is shown in detail in the following 
table :

* This figure represents fifty sets of the official publications of the United States Government received 
from tlie Public Printer. Forty-three sets are now distributed under the law, .and thus the total num- 
ber of packages distributed experiences a reduction of 3,369, leaving as a total 61,324 packages. 



42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Addiug the miscoUaueoiis exchanges to the total of Governuienf. exchanges, the total 
is 90,fiG6 packages. Of this number 61,619 were received for foreign and 29,047 for 
domestic distribution. 

The Government of Paraguay, the first to carry out the provisions of the treaty of 
Brussels for the immediate exchange of parliamentary annals, began at the end of 
June, 1890, the regular transmission of the Official Journal and the Gazette of the 
Paraguay Congress. Pending the passage by Congress of a bill making special i>ro- 
vision to enable the Institution to carry out this treaty, as the recognized Exchange 
Bureau of the United States Government, no return for this exchange has yet been 
made. A bill appropriating $2,000 for the purpose named passed the Senate at the 
last session, but failed to reach consideration in the House of Representatives. 

It is gratifying to note that on July 25, 1890, announcement was made of the es- 
tablishment by the Government of New South Wales of a special board for receiving 
and transmitting International Exchange iiublications. The exchange with that 
country has heretofore been effected through the Royal Society of New South Wales. 

Notice was also received of the establishment by the Government of Uruguay on 
December 10, 1890, of an Exchange Bureau designated as the Oficina de Deposito, 
Reparto y Canje Internationales. 

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE. 

The recommendation for an additional assistant in the shipping room having re- 
ceived your approval by the transfer in October, 1891, of Mr. George L. Snider from 
the Smithsonian to the exchange roll, it is believed that the exchange work at the 
close of the fiscal year was in more satisfactory condition than ever before. Eight 
thousand and ninety-four more packages were handled than in the previous year, an 
increase of 10.2 per cent, and on June 30, 1891, all that could be disposed of had been 
shipped, leaving but 1.53 packages then on hand. 

Packages received from abroad for distribution in the United States are sent out 
by registered mail, a record being made of each package showing the sender and the 
person or institution addressed. As a rule, this record can be made, the package can be 
re wrapped in stout paper and can be delivered at the post-office on the day, or within 
one or two days of its receipt. In some instances where the Bureau is crowded by 
tlie receipt of several thousand Government documents, a little longer delay may 
take place. 

Books for distribution abroad received from individuals or institutions in the 
United States are entered in a similar way and are held until a sufficient number 
have accumulated to make a reasonable shipment to any one country. They are 
then carefully examined and a list for each country is made up and the volumes 
packed and shipped. Where a large number of packages for one country are re- 
ceived from any institution they are usually shipped with a delay of from one to four 
or five days. 

An improvement in foreign transmissions has been made in the Exchange Office 
by increasing the frequency of shipments. The number of shipments to each country 
and the date of shipment is given in Exhibit A appended, but the great need at 
present is a more rapid communication with the principal European countries. This 
can only be effected when the approjiriation by Congress becomes sufficient to enable 
tlie institution to pay for fast freight. As it is now, free freight is granted by a 
majority of the steamship companies, and where it is necessary to jiay for transpor- 
tation, the boxes must be sent by slow steamers offering low rates. 

Dr. Felix Fliigel in Leipzig, and Messrs. William Wesley &, Son, in London, the 
foreign agents of the Institution, have paid the same careful attention to its inter- 
ests as in former years. I regret to note here the death of the senior member of the 
firm of William Wesley & Sou, which occurred on April 17, 1891. I also have to note 
the death of Dr. Felipe Poey on January 28, 1891. Dr. Poey has taken charge of the 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43 

Smithsonian excliaugcs iu Cnlta isiiuc 187(i, and his son, Dr. Frederic Poej% has liiudly 
offered to continue the work.

The system of recording the correspondence of the Bureau adopted on January 1, 
1890, has continued to give satisfaction. A further improvement in keeping the 
record of packages received has been effected by adopting as a substitute for the 
blotter and day book heretofore in use a record uponseparate sheets of pajier, which are 
subsequently bound up as a day book and upon which a record is made of all packages 
received. The packages to or from each institution or individual are then entered 
from these sheets upon the ledger cards. The system has the advantages that several 
])ersons can work upon the sheet at the same time, and that no copying of the rec- 
ord is re(]uired, introducing errors and requiring much time. This form of day-book 
sheet was adojjted on January 1, 1891. A further duplication of record books is 
avoided by having the authorized otliccr of the Smithsonian Institution, National 
Museum, Bureau of Ethnology, U. S. Geological Survey, and the U. S. Fish Commis- 
sion acknowledge the receipt of packages addressed to their offices directly ujjon 
these sheets. 

A new edition of the list of foreign correspondents of the Bureau is urgently needcil 
to facilitate current work. The list now in use was printed in 1885, since which 
time the list has doubled in number.

Appendix III. 

REPORT OF THE ACTING MANAGER OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL 

PARK. 

Sir: I have the honor to submit tlie following report of th<^ operations of the 
National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1891. 

At the opening of the year the land for the jiark was not yet all acquired. .Stei)8 
were taken to expedite the final acquisition as miich as possible, yet it was not until 
November 4, 1890, that possession was finally obtained of the entire tract. 

In the mean time arrangements were made to repair the old Holt mansion, situated 
upon the left bank of the creek, in such a manner as to fit it for occupation as an 
office for the park. The old building was found to require much more extensive re- 
pairs than were anticipated. It is a long, low structure, built rather for coolness 
and country retirement than for purposes of business activity ; and the walls, al- 
though thick, were found to be cracked and crumbling, and tlie foundations to be 
highly insecure. Before anything else could be done several of the walls had to be 
replaced and new foundations laid. This consumed the greater part of the ap})ro- 
priation and it was only possible to finish two rooms to be occupied as an office. A 
small barn with stable was built near the house for the accommodation of the horses 
required for the park service. 

An inclosure of the park being found imperatively necessary, a design for a fence 
was made by Mr. W. R. Emerson and this was erected as fast as the land was finally 
acquired by the United States. It is of stout, unpainted, oak jjalings, intended not 
so much to regulate the movements of the public as to keep out dogs and animals 
injurious to the creatures in the inclosure. 

As a preliminary to the laying out of roads and selecting sites for buildings, Mr. D. 
J. Howell was employed to make an accurate topographical survey of the park. The 
topographical work of the Coast Survey was used as a basis for this, the contours 
being carefully corrected and the highest levels reached by the water in Rock Creek 
being noted wherever it was possible to ascertain them. 

For reasons of economy it was thought best to lay out for the present but a single 
road, which should cross Rock Creek on a continuation of the so-called Quarry road, 
which lies mainly outside the gates. This main road within the park was staked out 
to a width of 30 feet, and has been carefully graded and macadamized for a distance 
of some 3,000 feet from the entrance. Bej^ond this a road, formerly a cart track, 
leads through the park to the western boundary, and has been somewhat improved 
for its entire length to afford some partial access for carriages in this direction. 

The "creek," so called( wh ich it will be remembered is really a quick-running stream ), 
is ordinarily fordable at a point near that where the road crosses, but this ford is im- 
passable in times of flood, and extraordinary precautions had to bo taken to secure a 
crossing above high-water mark, the narrowness of the stream and the precipitous 
character of the surrounding hills which it drains making it necessary to provide 
for a rise of at least 15 feet. Thus a "fill" of considerable extent was required on 
both approaches to the bridge, a condition that greatly increased the expense and 
labor of making the road. 

Measures were at once taken to erect a bridge suitable for foot i^assengers and 
carriages. Several plans for such a structure were submitted, examined and rejected, 
48 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49 

m-'iiiily Ixiciuiso of (lie great cosl wliidi their exeeution would entail. A plan pre- 
pared l)y Mr. 1). J. Howell was liually selected as Iteing etteetive for the purpose 
required at a uiiuimuin of expense. It is a combined iron and wooden structure, 128 
feet in length, resting upon two granite piers and two abutments. The plans were 
carefully examined, and (criticised ))y skilled experts, and were believed by compe- 
tent engineers to be sufficient to withstand any flood likely to occur. At the close 
of th(c fiscal year the piers and abutments had been completed, but the superstruc- 
ture was not yet in place. 

The (juarry near the entrance to the park seemed admirably fitted for the construc- 
tion of dens and yards for bears. In order to ascertain its condition, it was cleared 
of a great (luantity of loose earth and rock which had fallen from the cliii's above. 
The quarry face was found to Ite inmost places sufficiently steep to prevent the bears 
from climbing it, and where this was not the case the necessary steepness was ob- 
tained l>y blasting. To afford shelter for the bears spacious dens in which shelves 
were fashioned were hollowed out from the face of the rock, and in front of these 
tlu're was luiilt a strong iron fence 10 feet in height inclosing yards of considerable 
extent. The upper ends of the vertical bars of the fence were pointed and turned 
inward to prevent the escape of the bears, the floor of the yards was smoothly 
cemented, and a large basin, supplied with running water, built in each. Work upon 
tlieso yards has been frequently interrupted by the foiling from the slopes of large 
(juautities of earth and rock. To obviate this Mr. Olmsted, the landscape gardener, 
lias advised that a retaining wall be built at the top of the cliffs. But, as else- 
wiiere stated, the park boundary runs at the upper edge of these clift's and only a 
]>artial control of the diftieulties can be obtained unless the jiark property is ex- 
tended liere some yards further back. The system of yards as projected includes 
fliree principal inclosures and a smaller one to be used as a shifting pen. At an early 
day this system will have to be enlarged, as the park has now four species of bears 
and one subsjiecies. 

Th(! l)row of the first hill overlooking the bridge was selected as a site for a house 
for animals reiiuiring heat. The design for this house, furnished by Mr. Emerson, 
was somewhat modified to suit the exigencies of the appropriation available, it being 
found impracticable to erect more than a portion of the structure. The house is of 
stone, a handsome gneiss, quarried upon Broad Branch some 2| miles from the park. 
Its plan shows a long corridor upon one side of which are arranged the cages for 
large animals. Exterior yards and an extension for the accommodation of smaller 
animals will be added if funds are appropriated for that purpose. At present the 
iidiise is much overcrowded and the animals are not suitably accommodated. 

Accommodations for the small lierd of bison were early considered. It seemed 
desirable to place these animals where they could have considerable range. When 
confined even in large yards they cut uj) the ground so much that they soon destroy 
every vestige of grass or other green thing. Still, if the inclosures are too large the 
animals keep so far away as not to be seen at all by the public. A site was selected 
in a protected locality on a hillside where small paddocks could be made along the 
main road and larger yards for grazing grounds could be carried from these down into 
t lie rich bottomland along Rock Creek, where abundance of grass is naturally produced. 
Here ther<^ was constructed a barn for the buft'alo, which is a novel and picturesque 
Ntructure of black-oak logs admirably harmonizing with the location. The appro- 
priation was so limited that it was found necessary to j)lace the elk also in this barn, 
and pad(btcks fur them were accordingly built adjoining it. Inexpensive but strong 
f<'nces for these paddocks wer<> made of iron rods running horizontally through 
rough cedar posts and c<)U])led together at the ends. Some difficulty has been found 
witli the elk fence which has not stood the continuous battering given it by the 
males during the rutting season as well as was expected. The original plan of ex- 
tending the i)addocks to the bottom land of the creek will shortly be carried out. 

Paddocks for the deer and antelope have been constructed on the left bank of the.

50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

creek along the eastern boundary of the park. This situation is admirably adapted 
by nature for the animals, but has the disadvantage of exposing them to tho sight 
of dogs both on the outside of the park and within it. Three animals have been so 
frightened as to lose their lives from this cause, and it will be necessary to make the 
fence so tight as to entirely prevent the sight of dogs and probably it will be advisa- 
ble to exclude them from this part of tho park altogether. 

The unexpected gift of an Asiatic elephant by Mr. James E. Cooper made it neces- 
sary to hastily prepare a barn. This is a temporary structure, but will be so titted 
as to serve for shelter during the winter. It was prepared for but one animal, but 
by Mr, Coojier's generosity a second elephant was lent to the park, and the two 
have been made comfortable within it. The situation of this barn is not wholly sat- 
isfactory. At the time it was built it was thought desirable to place it at a considera- 
ble distance from the boundaries of the park in view of the possibility of the ani- 
mals becoming unmanageable. These apprehensions were fortunately not well- 
founded, and it would be much more convenient to have the elephants nearer the 
stream so that they could frequently have immediate access to the water. If funds 
for the erection of a permanent elephant house should become available this matter 
will no doubt be considered. The expense of the maintenance of the elephants is verj^ 
groat, and it should be remembered Ihat the estimate for the last year's expenditure 
was made without the knowledge that it would be necessary to meet so heavy an 
item as the cost of erecting a special building and providing keepers and provisions 
for these two animals. 

As a colony of jirairie dogs had been for some time a feature of the collection, it 
became necessary to provide suitable accommodations for them. Although a broad 
open meadow Avould best resemble their natural habitat it was thought best to 
place them in a little thicket of trees to the west of the main drive. Here there was 
built an inclosing wall 3^ feet high, and from the footing of this, galvanized iron 
mesh-work was placed in a trench 8 feet deep. This has been found sufficient to 
completely confine them. It is believed that this iron net will not corrode when 
buried so deeply in the ground. If this proves successful for a series of years it 
will be a great advantage, as it has usually been thought in Zoological Gardens 
necessary to excavate completely the inclosures for burrowing animals and to ce- 
ment the bottom. This is very expensive, and the result is that but few colonies of 
burrowing animals are seen. It is hoped to add several colonies of this nature, in- 
cluding some of the most characteristic American rodents. 

A list of the accessions to the park during the year is given herewith. (Exhibit 
A.) Many of them could not be accommodated in the houses already erected and 
have been assigned to quarters more or less temporary or to small cages scattered 
along the main road. Many more animals could have been procured had it been 
possible to suitably accommodate them. The most important accession is the Asiatic 
elephant " Dunk," which was presented to the park on April 30, 1891, by Mr. 
James E. Cooper, tlie proprietor of the Adam Forepaugh shows. The elephant is 
a fine animal, about 25 years of age, very docile and tractable, and a very valuable 
addition to the collection. Mr. Cooper not only gave this elephant, but in order 
to insure success in keeping him loaned another, '' Colddust, " to serves a a com- 
panion, it being well known that solitary elephants suffer greatly from loneliness. 

When commissioners were sent to South America to collect material for the World's 
Columbian Exposition of 1893 it was thoughtfully suggested by Mr. W. E. Curtis, 
chief of the Latin-American Bureau of the State Department, that they might be 
also willing to collect animals for the park. Authority was therefore given them to 
incur expenditures not to exceed $300 for each person, and several accessions have 
been made by this means. The experiment has not, however, proved as satisfactory 
as could be wished, as the animals sent are usually badly cared for on shipboard. 

Several animals have been born in the park during the year, the most noteworthy 
being a young female bison. It is believed that these animals will breed freely in 
confinement and that by this means the species may be kept indefinitely perpetuated. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51 

The mortality duriug the year has beeu eonsiderablc. A great proportion of the 
auimals that ha\'e died have succumbed immediately after arrival, either being in 
bad condition from injury or otherwise, when shipped, or being too delicate to stand 
transportation. Those who send specimens to the park should always take care to 
keep the animals in confinement for some time before shipping and should ask for 
directions as to the j)roper method of boxing. Many auimals are killed by being 
sent in an improper manner and by being either starved or provided with improper 
food. The auimals receivtsd from South America have been very frequently mori- 
bund when rec'cived. This is partly due to the customs regulations at New York City, 
Avhich cause considerable delay in the reshipment of auimals to this city. 

Tlu^ beautiful specimen of the big horn sheep {Oris montana) succumbed to an at- 
tack of apoplexy, while the animals were still confined in the contracted yards in 
the rear of the Smithsonian Institution. A post-mortem examination showed the 
animal to be in an excellent physical condition, and it is believed that lack of 
exercise was the principal cause of the disorder that terminated its existence. As 
far as can be judged from this case there appears to be no reason whatever why this 
sheep, so rare in zoological collections, should not thrive in captivity if a suitable 
range of rocks and clitfs such as is found iu the National Zoological Park is given 
to it. 

The close of the year finds the work of the park progressing steadily and as rap- 
idly as tlie funds appropriated by Congress will admit. The interest of the j)ublic 
is found to be very great, miu-h more in fact than had been anticipated. There can 
be no doubt that in the course of a few years the park Avill become one of the chief 
attractions of a city already famous for its sights, offering as it does a combination 
entirely unique, exquisitely beautiful natural scenery with the charming aspects of 
varied animal life. 

It has already beeu noticed that the one roadway is too narrow for the accommoda- 
ion of the largo number of carriages that frequent the park on Sundays, the throngs 
between the hours of 3 and 5 p. m. being so great as to endanger visitors, and it it 
earuestly desired to extend the system of roads in accordance Avith a plan already 
laid out. The bridge, from uecessax-y economy, was restricted to a width just suffi- 
cient to allow carriages to ])ass, no footway being provided. In view of the throng 
already referred t(t, this offers another source of danger, audit is contemplated build- 
ing footways on projecting l)rackets along either side of the bridge should funds be 
ajipropriated for the purpose. Either this or a bridge for foot passengers alone will 
be absolutely essential.

REPORT OF THE TJBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR ENDINCx JUNE 30, 1891. 

Siii: I have tho honor rt'spcctfnlly to submit my rej)ort on the work of the library 
auriug the year from July 1, 18H0, to June 30, 1891. 

The work of recording and caring for the accessions has l»een carried on as during 
tlie ])reeediug year, the entry numbers on the accession book running from 207,176 
to 225,.">8.").

Of these publications, 7,720 (namely, 424 volumes, 6,413 parts of volumes, and 
883 pamphlets) were retained for use in the National Museum, and 754 medical dis- 
sertations were deposited in the library of the Surgeon-General, IT. S. Army. The 
remainder were promptly sent to the Library of Congress on the Monday following 
their receipt. 

In carrying out the Secretary's plan of increasing the library by exchanges, 1,327 
letters asking for new exchanges, or calling attention to deficiencies in series already 
in the library, were written; and ju response 47.5 new exchanges were acquired 
by the Institution, and 248 defective si^ries were completed, either wholly or as far 
as the publishers were able to su^^ly the missing parts. The value of this under- 
taking is well shown by the large increase of the actual accessions in comparison 
with those of the last fiscal year. In 1889-'90 the total number of accessions was 
20,187; in 1890-'9l it was 27,294, showing a gain of 7,107 over 1889-'90.

EEPORT ON PUBLICATIONS OF THE YEAE ENDING JUNE 30, 1891. 

SAIITHSONIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE. 

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report upon the publications of tho 
Smithsonian Institution for tlie year ending June 30, 1891: 

Althougli no addition has been made duriug the year to the series of ''Contribu- 
tions to Knowledge," one issue has been made in a similar quarto form, consisting of 
a collection of botanical plates which had been prepared under the direction of the 
late Dr. Asa Gray between the years 1849 and 1859, now some forty years ago. This 
fragmentary series of 23 colored plates was designed as a portion of an extended illus- 
trated work on " The Forest Trees of North America." lu the Secretary's report to 
the Regents for 1849 it was stated : 

"It is intended in this work to give figures from original drawings of the flowers, 
leaves, fruit, etc., of each principal species in the United States proper, for the most 
part of the size of nature, and so executed as to furnish colored or uncolored copies, 
the first being intended to give an adequate idea of the species, and the second for 
greater cheapness and more general diffusion. This work will be completed in three 
parts, in octavo, with an atlas of quarto ])lates, the first part to be published next 
spring. A portion of this will be occupied with an introductory dissertation giving 
the present state of our knowledge (divested as much as possible of all unnecessary 
technical terms), of the anatomy, morphology, and physiology of the tree, tracing 
its growth from the embryo to its full development and reproduction in the forma- 
tion of fruit and seed. This will be illustrated by drawings from original dissections, 
under the microscoiie, and sketches made in every instance from nature." 

The illustrations, so far as furnished, were skillfully drawn by Sprague, and were 
reproduced on stone by Sourel, Prestele, and others; the impressions being care- 
fully colored by haiul. In consequence of various unforeseen hindrances and delays 
this interesting work, unfortunately, was never completed by its eminent projector; 
and no descriptive text was ever received fi'om him, even of the plates which had 
been finished under his direction. 

Notwithstanding the time which has elapsed since their original preparation and 
the comparatively limited range of their represention, it was thought advisable that 
they should be issued for the benefit of botanists, who will undoubtedly be inter- 
ested in this unfinished work of their great leader and exponent, even without the 
advantage of his descriptive comments.

GENEKAL APPENDIX 



SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 18D1. 



H. Mis. 334, pt. 1 5 65 



ADVERTISEMENT. 



' The object of the General Appendix to the Annual Report of the 
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of soientiflc discov- 
ery in particular directions ; occasional reports of the investigations 
made by collaborators of the Institution ; memoirs of a general charac- 
ter or on special topics, whether original and prejjared expressly for the 
purpose, or selected from foreign journals and lU'oceedings ; and briefly 
to present (as fully as sjDace will permit) such papers not published in 
the Smithsonian Contributions or in the Miscellaneous Collections as 
may be supposed to be of interest or value to the numerous correspond- 
ents of the Institution. 

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual rei)ort 
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka- 
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery, 
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti- 
tution ; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history, 
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would 
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress. 

In ISSO, the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an 
annual summary of progress which for thirty years jirevious had been 
issued by well-known private pubHshing firms, had prepared by com- 
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the promi- 
nent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology, meteor- 
ology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and anthropol- 
ogy. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether satisfac- 
torily, down to and including the year 1888. 

In the report for 1889, a return was made to the earlier method of 
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original) 
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus- 
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1891.

CELESTIAL SPECTEOSCOPY.* 



By William Huggins, f. r. s. 



In 18G6, 1 had tlie honor of bringing before this Association, at one of 
the evening lectnres, an aceonnt of the lirst fruits of the novel and un- 
expected advances in our knowledge of the celestial bodies which fol- 
lowed rapidly upon Kirchhoft's original work on the solar spectrum 
and the interpretation of its lines. 

Since that time a great harvest has been gathered in the same field 
by many reapers. Spectroscopic astronomy has become a distinct and 
acknowledged branch of the science, possessing a large literature of 
its own, and observatories specially devoted to it. The more recent dis- 
covery of the gelatine dry plate has given a further greatimpetus to this 
modern side of astronomy and has opened a x)athway into the unknown 
of which even an enthusiast thirty years ago would scarcely have dared

In no science, perhaps, does the sober statement of the results which 
have been achieved appeal so strongly to the imagination and make 
so evident the almost boundless powers of the mind of man. By 
means of its light alone to analyze the chemical nature of a far-distant 
body; to be able to reason about its present state in relation to the 
past and future; to measure Avithin an English mile or less per second 
tlie otherwise invisible motion which it may have towards or from us; 
to do more, to make even that which is darkness to our eyes light, and 
from vibrations which our organs of sight are powerless to perceive 
to evolve a revelation in Avhich we see mirrored some of the stages 
through whicli the stars may pass in their slow evolutional progress — 
sunly tlie record of such achievements, however poor the form of 
words in which thej^ may be described, is worthy to be regarded as the 
scientific epic of the x)resent century.

10 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 

we do not know, of a few only of its more important problems, giving a 
prominent place, in accordance with the traditions of this chair, to the 
work of the last year or two. 

In the spectroscope itself advances have been made by Lord Ray- 
leigh by his discussion of the theory of the instrument and by Prof. 
Rowland in the construction of concave gratings. 

Lord Eayleigh has shown that there is not the necessary connection, 
sometimes supposed, between dispersion and resolving power, as be- 
sides the prism or grating other details of construction and of adjust- 
ment of a spectroscope must be taken into account. 

The resolving power of the prismatic spectroscope is proportional to 
the length of path in the dispersive medium. For the heavy flint glass 
used in Lord Eayleigh's experiments, the thickness necessary to resolve 
the sodium lines came out 1-02 centimeters. If this be taken as a unit, 
the resolving power of a prism of similar glass will be (in the neighbor- 
hood of the sodium lines) equal to the number of centimeters of its 
thickness. In other parts of the spectrum the resolving power will 
vary inversely as the third power of the wave length, so that it will be 
eight times as great in the violet as in the red. The resolving power 
of a spectroscojje is therefore proportional to the total thickness of the 
dispersive material in use, irrespective of the number, the angles, or 
the setting of the separate prisms into which, for the sake of conven- 
ience, it may be distributed. 

The resolving power of a grating depends upon the total number of 
lines on its surface and the order of spectrum in use, about 1,000 lines 
being necessary to resolve the sodium lines in the first spectrum. 

As it is ofteu of importance in the record of observations to state 
the efficiency of the spectroscope with which they were made, Prof. 
Schuster has proposed the use of a unit of purity as well as of resolv- 
ing power, for the full resolving power of a spectroscope is realized 
in practice only when a sufficiently narrow slit is used. The unit of 
purity also is to stand for the separation of two lines differing by one- 
thousandth of their own wave length, about the separation of the 
sodium pair at D. 

A further limitation may come in from the physiological fact that, 
as Lord Eayleigh has pointed out, the eye, when its full aperture is 
used, is not a perfect instrument. If we wish to realize the full resolv- 
ing power of a spectroscope, therefore, the emergent beam must not be 
larger than about one-third of the opening of the pupil. 

Up to the present time the standard ot reference for nearly all si>ec- 
troscopic work continues to be Angstrom's map of the solar spectrum 
and his scale based upon his original determinations of absolute wa\ e 
length. It is well known, as was pointed out by Thal^n in his work 
on the spectrum of iron, in 1884, that Angstrom's figures are slightly 
too small, in consequence of an error existing in a standard meter used 
by him. The corrections for this have been introduced into the tables 
of the wave lengths of terrestrial spectra collected and revised by a 



CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 71 

committee of tliis Association tioiii 1885 to 1887. Last year the com- 
mittee added a table of corrections to Rowland's scale. 

The inconvenience caused by a cbjrnge of standard scale is, for a 
time at least, considerable; bnt there is little doubt that in the near 
future IvOAvland's j^hotographic map of the solar spectrum and his 
scale based on the determinations of absolute wave length by Pierce 
and Bell, or the Potsdam scale, based on original determinations by 
Miiller and Kenipf, which differs very slightly from it, will come to be 
exclusively adoi)ted. 

The great accuracy of Rowland's x>liotographic map is due chiefly to 
the introduction by him of concave gratings and of a method for their 
use by which the ])roblem of the determination of relative wavelengths 
is simplilied to measures of coincidences of the lines in different spectra 
by a micrometer. 

The concave grating and its peculiar mounting, in which no lenses 
or telescope are needed, and in which all the spectrtl are in focus 
together, formed a new departure of great importance in the measure- 
ment of spectral lines. The valuable method of x>hotogra|ihic sensi- 
tizers for different parts of the spectrum has enabled Prof. Rowland to 
include in his map the whole visible solar spectrum, as well as the 
ultra-violet portion as far as it can get through our atmosphere. Some 
recent ])hotographs of the solar spectrum, which include A, by Mr. 
George Higgs, are of great technical beauty. 

During the past year the results of three independent researches 
have appeared, in which the special object of the observers has been 
to distinguish the lines which are due to our atmosphere from those 
which are truly solar— the maps of IVI. Thollon, which, owing to his 
lamented death Just l)efore their final completion, have assumed the 
character of a memorial of him; maps by Dr. Becker; and sets of i^ho- 
tographs of a high and a low sun by Mr. McClean. 

At the mec^ting of this association in Bath, M. Janssen gave an ac^ 
count of his own researches on the terrestrial lines of the solar sjiec' 
trum which owe their origin to the oxygen of our atmosphere. He 
discovered the remarkable fact that, while one class of bands varies as 
the density of the gas, other diffuse bands vary as the square of the 
densit}'. These observations are in accordance with the work of Ego- 
rott and of Olszewski, and of Liveing and Dewar on condensed oxy- 
gen. In some recent experiments Olszewski, with a layer of liquid 
oxygen 30 millimeters thick, saw, as well as four other bands, the band 
coincident with Fraunhofer's A; a remarkable instance of the persist- 
ence of absorption through a great range of temperature. The light 
wliich i)assed through tlic lifpiid oxygen had a light blue color resem- 
bling that of the sky. 

Of not less interest are the experiments of Knut Angstrom, which 
show that the carbonic acid and aqueous vapour of tlu' atmosidiere 
reveal their presence by dark bands in the invisible infra-red region, 
at the positions of bands of emission of these substances. 



72 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 

Spectroscopic conditions. — It is now some thirty years since tlie spec- 
troscope gave us for tlie first time certain knowledge of the nature of 
the heavenly bodies, and revealed the fundamental fiict that terrestrial 
matter is not peculiar to the solar system, but is common to all the 
stars which are visible to us. 

In the case of a star such as Oapella, which has a spectrum almost 
identical with that of the sun, we feel justified in concluding that the 
matter of which it is built up is similar, and that its temperature is 
also high, and not very different from the solar temperature. The task 
of analyzing the stars and nebuhie becomes however one of very great 
difficulty when we have to do with spectra differing from the solar type. 
We are thrown back upon the laboratory for the information necessary 
to enable us to interpret the indications of the spectroscope as to the 
chemical nature, the density and pressure, and the temperature of tlie 
celestial masses. 

What the spectroscope immediately reveals to us are the waves 
which were set up in the tether filling all inter-stellar sjiace, years or 
hundreds of years ago, by the motions of the molecules of the celestial 
substances. As a rule, it is only when a body is gaseous and sufficiently 
hot that the motions within its molecules can xJi'oduce bright lines and 
a corresponding absorption. The spectra of the heavenly bodies are 
indeed, to a great extent absorption spectra, but we have usually to 
study them through the corresponding emission spectra of bodies 
brought into the gaseous form and rendered luminous by means of 
flames or of electric discharges. In both cases, unfortunately, as has 
been shown recently by Profs. Liveing and Dewar, Wiillner, E. Wiede- 
mann and others, there appears to be no certain direct relation be- 
tween the luminous radiation as shown in the siiectroscope and the 
temperature of the tlame, or of the gaseous contents of the vacuum 
tube — that is, in the usual sense of the term as applied to the mean 
motion of all the molecules. In both cases, the vibratory motions with- 
in the molecules to which their luminosity is due are almost always 
much greater than would be produced by encounters of molecules hav- 
ing motions of translation no greater than the average motions which 
characterize the temperature of the gases as a whole. The temjiera- 
ture of a vacuum tube through which an electric discharge is taking 
place may be low, as shown by a thermometer, quite apart from the 
consideration of the extreme smallness of the mass of gas, but the 
vibrations of the lumiuous molecules must be violent in wliatever way 
we suppose them to be set up by the discharge; if we take Schuster's 
view that comparatively few molecules .are carrying the discharge, and 
that it is to the fierce encounters of these alone that the luminosity is 
due, then if all the molecules had similar motions, the temperature of 
the gas would be very high. 

So in flames where chemical changes are in progress, the vibratory 
motions of the molecules which are luminous may be, in connecticm with 



CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOrY. 73 

tlie encriiy set free in these (•liaii,i;es, very different from those corre- 
spontling to the mean teniperatni'e of the lianie. 

Under the ordinary conditions of terrestrial experiments, therefore, 
the tem])erature or the mean vis vira of the molecules may have no di- 
rect relation to the total radiation, whicli, on the other hand, is the 
sum of the radiation due to each luminous molecule. 

These phenomena have recently been discussed hy Ehert from the 
standpoint of the electro-magnetic theory of light. 

Very great caution is therefore called lor when we attempt to reason 
by the aid of laboratorj^ experiments to the temperature of the heavenly 
bodies from their radiation, esi)ecially on the reasonable assumption 
that in them the luminosity is not ordinarily associated with chemical 
changes or with electrical discharges; but is due to a simple glowing 
from the ultimate conversion of the gravitational energy of shrinkage 
into molecular motion. 

In a recent paper Stas maintains that electric spectra are to be re- 
garded as distinct from flame spectra; and from researches of his own, 
tliat the pairs of lines of the sodium spectrum other than B are pro- 
duced only by disrui^tive electric discharges. As these pairs of lines 
are found reversed in the solar spectrum, he concludes that the sun's 
radiation is due mainly to electric discharges. But Wolf and Diacon, 
and later. Watts, observed the other pairs of lines of the sodium spec- 
trum when the vapor was raised above the ordinary temperature of 
the Buusen flame, llecently, Liveing and Dewar saw easily, besides 
1), the citron and green pairs, and sometimes the blue pair and the 
orange pair, when hj'drogen charged with sodium vapor was burning 
at different pressures in oxygen. In the case of sodium vapor, there- 
fore, and presumably in all other vapors and gases, it is a matter of 
inditference Avhether the necessary vibratory motion of the molecules is 
produced by electric discharges or by flames. The presence of lines in 
the solar spectrum which we can only produce electrically, is an indica- 
tion, however, as Stas points out, of the high temperature of the .sun. 

AVe nuist not forget that the light from the heavenly bodies may con- 
sist of the combined radiations of different layers of gas at different tem- 
l>eraturrs, and ])ossibly l)e further comi)licated to an unknown extent 
l>ythe absorption of cooler portions of gas outside. 

Not less caution is needed if we endeavor to argue from the broaden- 
ing of lines and the coming in of a continuims spectrum as to the rela- 
tive pressure of the gas in the celestial atmospheres. On the one hand, 
it can not be gainsaid that in the laboratory the widening of the lines 
in a I'liickiM's tube follows upon incieasing the density <ff the residue 
«)f liydi'ogcn in the tube, when the A'ibrations are more frequently dis- 
turbed by tVcsli encounteis, and that a broadening of the sodium lines 
in a tiaine at ordinary pressure is ]>roduced by an increase of the cpuin- 
tity of sodium in the liame; l)ut it is doubtful if ]>ressure, as distin- 
guished iVom (juanlity. (lo<'s ]»rodu(e an increase of the breadth of the 



74 CELESTIAL SPECfROSCOPV. 

lines. An individual molecule of sodium will be sensibly in tlie same 
condition, considering the relatively enormous number of the molecules 
of the other gases, whether th(; flame is scantily or copiously fed with 
the sodium salt. With a small quantity of sodium vapor the intensity 
will be feeble except near the maximum of the lines ; when^ however, 
the quantity is increased, the comparative transparency on the sides of 
the maximum will allow the light from the additional molecules met 
with in the path of the visual ray to strengthen the radiation of the 
molecules farther back, and so increase the breadth of the lines. 

In a gaseous mixture it is found, as a rule, that at the same pressure 
or temperature, as the encounters with similar molecules become fewer, 
the spectral lines will be affected as if the body were observed under 
conditions of reduced quantity or temperature* 

In their recent investigation of the spectroscopic behavior of flames 
under various pressures up to forty atmospheres. Profs. Living and 
Dewar have come to the conclusion that though the prominent feature 
of the light emitted by flames at high pressure apjiears to be a strong 
continuous spectrum, there is not the slightest indication that this con- 
tinuous spectrum is produced by the broadening of the lines of the same 
gases at low pressure. On the contrary, photometric observations of 
the brightness of the continuous spectrum, as the pressure is varied, 
show that it is mainly produced by the mutual action of the molecules 
of a gas, Exi)eriments on the sodium spectrum were carried up to a 
pressure of forty atmospheres without producing any definite effect on 
the width of the lines which could be ascribed to the pressure. In a 
similar way the lines of the spectrum of water showed no signs of ex- 
pansion lip to twelve atmospheres 5 though more intense than at ordi- 
nary pressure, they remained narrow and clearly defined. 

It follows therefore that a continuous spectrum can not be considered, 
when taken alone, as a sure indication of matter in the liquid or the 
solid state. Not only, as in the experiments already mentioned, such 
a spectrum may be due to gas when under pressure, but, as MaxAvell 
pointed out, if the thickness of a medium, such as sodium vapor, which 
radiates and absorbs different kinds of light, be very great, and the 
temperature high, the light emitted will be of exactly the same composi- 
tion as that emitted by lamp-black at the same temperature, for the 
radiations which are feebly emitted will be also feebly absorbed and 
can reach the surface from immense depths. Schuster has shown that 
oxygen, even in a ijartially exhausted tube, can give a continuous spec- 
trum when excited by a feeble electric discharge. 

Compound bodies are usually distinguished by a banded spectrum j 
but, on the other hand, such a spectrum does not necessarily show the 
presence of compounds — that is, of molecules containing different kinds 
of atoms — but simply of a more complex molecule, which may be made 
up of similar atoms, and be, therefore, an allotropic condition of the 
same body. In some cases — for example, in the diffuse bands of the ,, 



CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 75 

absorption spectrum of oxygen — the bands may have an intensity pro- 
portional to the square of the density of the gas, and may be due either 
to the formation of more complex molecules of the gas with increase of 
pressure or, it may be, to the constraint to which the molecules are sub- 
ject during their encounter with one another. 

It may l>e thought that at least in the coincidences of bright lines we 
are on the swlid ground of certainty, since the length of the waves set 
up in the .nether by a molecule, say of hydrogen, is the most fixed and 
absolutely permanent quantity in nature, and is so of physical necessity, 
for with any alteration Mic molecule would cease to be hydrogen. 

Such would be the case if the coincidence were certain; but an abso- 
lute coincidence can be only a matter of greater or less probability, 
depending on the resolving power employed, on the number of the lines 
which correspond, and on their characters. When the coincidences are 
very numerous, as in the case of iron and the solar spectrum, or the 
lines arc characteristically grouped, as in the case of hydrogen and the 
solar spectnitn, we may regard the coincidence as certain; but the 
l)rogress of science has been greatly retarded by resting important con- 
clusions upon the apparent coincidence of single lines in spectroscopes 
of,vcry small resolving power. In such cases, unless other reasons 
supporting the coincidence are present, the probability of a real coinci- 
dence is almost too small to be of any importance, especially in the case 
of a heavenly body which may have a motion of approach or of recession 
of unknown amount. 

But even here we are met by the confusion introduced by multiple 
spectra, corresponding to different molecular groupings of the same 
substance and, further, to the intluence of substances in vapor upon 
each other; for when several gases are present together the phenomena 
of radiation and reversal by absori)tion are by no means the same as 
if the gases were free from each other's influence, and especially is this 
the case when they are illuminated by an electric discharge. 

I have said as much as time will permit and I think indeed suffi- 
cient to show that it is only by the laborious and slow process of most 
cautious observation that the foundations of the science of celestial 
l)hysics can be surely laid. We are at present in a time of transition, 
Avhen the earlier and, in the nature of things, less precise observations 
are giving i)lace to work of an order of accuracy much greater than 
was formerly considered attainable with objects of such small bright- 
ness as the stars. 

The accuracy of the earlier determinations of the spectra of the ter- 
restrial elements is in most cases insufficient for modern work on the 
stars as well as on the sun. It falls much below the scale adopted in 
Eowland's map of the sun, as avcH as below the degree of accuracy at- 
tained at Potsdam by photography in a part of the spectrum for the 
brighter stars. Increase of resolving power very frequently breaks up 
into groups, in the spectra of the sun and stars, the lines which had 



76 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 

been regarded as single, and tlieir supposed coincidence witli terrestrial 
lines falls to the ground. For this reason many of the early conclusions 
based on observation as good as it was possible to make at the time 
"with the less powerful spectroscopes theu in use, may not be found to be 
maintained under the much greater resolving power of modern instru- 
ments. 

Spectroscopic Frohlems. — The spectroscope has failed as yet to inter- 
pret for us the remarkable spectrum of the aurora borealis. Undoubt- 
edly in this phenomenon portions of our atmosphere are lighted up by 
electric discharges; we should exi^ect, therefore, to recognize the spectra 
of the gases known to be present in it. As yet we have not been able 
to obtain similar spectra from these gases artificially, and especially we 
do not know the origin of the principal line in the green, which often 
appears alone, and may have, therefore, an origin independent of that of 
the other lines, llecently the suggestion has been made that the aurora 
is a j)henomenon produced by the dust of meteors and falling stars, and 
that near x^ositions of certain auroral lines or flutings of manganese, 
lead, barium, thallium, iron, etc., are sufficient to justify us in regarding 
meteoric dust in the atmosphere as the origin of the auroral spectrum. 
Liveing and Dewar have made a conclusive research on this point, by 
availing themselves of the dust of excessive minuteness thrown off 
from the surface of the electrodes of various metals and meteorites by 
a disruptive discharge, and carried forward into the tube of observa- 
tion by a more or less rapid current of air or other gas. These exjDeri- 
ments prove that metallic dust, however fine, suspended in a gas will 
not act like gaseous matter in becoming luminous with its character- 
istic spectrum in an electric discharge similar to that of the aurora. 
Prof. Schuster has suggested that the principal line may be due to some 
very light gas which is present in too suaall a proportion to be detected 
by cheuiical analysis or even by the spectroscope in the presence of 
the other gases near the earth, but which, at the height of the auroral 
dischai'ges is in a sufficiently greater relative proportion to give a 
spectrum. Lcmstrtim, indeed, states that he saw this line in the silent 
discharge of a Holtz machine on a mountain in Lapland, The lines 
may not have been obtained in our laboratories from the atmosi)heric 
gases on account of the difficulty of reproducing in tubes with sufficient 
nearness tlie conditions under which the auroral discharges take place. 

In the spectra of comets the spectroscope has shown the presence of 
carbon presumably in combination with hydrogen, and also sometimes 
with nitrogen; and in the case of comets approaching very near the sun, 
the lines of sodium, and other lines which have been supposed to belong 
to iron. Though the researches of Prof. H. A. Newton and of Prof. 
Schiaparelli leave no doubt of the close connection of comets with 
corresponding i)6riodic meteor swarms, and therefore of the probable 
identity of cometary matter with that of meteorites, with which the spec- 



CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 77 

tros('oi)ic evidence agrees, it would be perhaps unwise at present to at- 
tempt to define too precisely the exact condition of the matter which 
forms the nu(deus of the conu't. In any case the part of the light of 
the C(mict which is not reflected solar light can scarcely be attributed 
to a high temperature produced by tlic clashing of separate meteoric 
stones set up within the nucleus by the sun's disturbing force. We 
must look rather to disruptive electric discharges, produced probably 
by processes of evaporation due to increavsed solar heat, wliich would 
be amply sufticient to set free portions of the occluded gases into the 
vacuum of si)ace. May it be that these discharges are assisted, and 
indeed possibly increased, by the recently-discovered action of the 
ultra-violet part of the sun's light? Lenard and Wolfe have shown 
that ultra-violet light can produce a discharge from a negatively elec- 
trified piece of metal, while TIallwachs and Kighi have shown further 
that ultra-violet light can even charge i)ositively an unelectrified piece 
of metal. Similar actions on cometary matter, unscreened as it is by an 
absorptive atmosphere, at least of any noticeable extent, may well be 
powerful when a comet approaches the sun, and help to explain an 
electrified condition of the evaporated matter which would possibly 
bring it under the sun's repulsive action. We shall have to return to 
tliis point in speaking of the solar corona. 

A very great advance has been made in our knowledge of the con- 
stitution of the sun by the recent work at the Johns Hopkins University 
by means of jdiotography and concave gratings, in comparing the solar 
spectrum, under great resolving power, directly with the spectra of the 
terrestrial elements. Prof. Rowland has shown that the lines of thirty- 
six terrestrial elements at least are certainly present in the solar spec- 
trum, while eight others are doubtful. Fifteen elements, including ni- 
trogen, as it shows itself under an electric discharge in a vacuum tube, 
have not been found in the solar spectrum. Some ten other elements, 
inclusive of oxygen, have not yet been compared with the sun's spec, 
trum. 

Kowland remarks that of the fifteen elements named as not found in 
the sun, many are so classed because they have few strong lines, or 
none at all, in the limit of the solar spectrum as compared by him with 
the arc. Boron has only two strong lines. The lines of bismuth are 
compound and too diffuse. Therefore even in the case of these fifteen 
elements there is little evidence that they are really absent from the 
sun. 

It follows that if the whole earth were heated to the temperature of 
tlie sun, its spectrum Avould resemble very closely the solar spectrum- 
Rowland has not found any lines common to several elements, and 
in the case of some accidental coincidences, more ac(airate investiga- 
tion reveals some slight difference of wave-length or a common im- 
])urity. Further, the relative strength of the lines in the solar spec- 
trum is generally, with a few exceptions, the same as that in the elec- 



78 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 

trie arc, so tliat Eowland considers tliat liis experiments show "very 
little evidence" of tlie breaking- up of tlie terrestrial elements in the 
sun. 

Stas in a recent paper gives the final results of eleven years of re- 
search on the chemical elements in a state of purity, and on the possi- 
bility of decomx)osing them by the physical and chemical forces at our 
disposal. His experiments on calcium, strontium, lithium, nuignesium, 
silver, sodium, and thallium, show that these substances retain their 
individuality under all conditions, and are unalterable by any forces 
that we can bring to bear upon them. 

Prof. Eowland looks to the solar lines which are unaccounted for as 
a means of enabling him to discover such new terrestrial elements as 
still lurk in rare minerals and earths, by confronting their spectra 
directly with that of the sun. He has already resolved yttrium spec- 
troscoi)ically into three components, and actually into two. The com- 
parison of the results of this independent analytical method with the 
remarkable but different conclusions to which M. Lecoq de Boisbaudran 
and Mr. Crookes have been led respectively, from spectroscopic obser- 
vation of these bodies when glowing under molecular bombardment in 
a vacuum tube, will be awaited with much interest. It is worthy of 
remark that, as our knowledge of the spectrum of hydrogen in its com- 
plete form came to us from the stars, it is now from tiie sun that chem- 
istry is probably about to be enriched by the discovery of new elements. 

In a discussion in the Bakerian Lecture for 1885, of what we knew 
uj) to that time of the sun's corona, I was led to the conclusion that the 
corona is essentially a phenomenon similar in the cause of its formation 
to the tails of comets — namely, that it consists for the most jiart prob- 
ably of matter going from the sun under the action of a force, possibly 
electrical, which varies as the surface, and can therefore in the case of 
highly attenuated matter easily master the force of gravity even near 
the sun. Though many of the coronal particles may return to the sun, 
those which form the long rays or streamers do not return; they sepa- 
rate and soon become too diffused to ])e any longer visible, and may 
well go to furnish the matter of the zodiacal light, which otherwise has 
not received a satisfactory explanation. And further, if such a force 
exist at the sun, the changes of terrestrial magnetism may be due to 
direct electric action, as the earth moves through lines of inductive 
force. 

These conclusions appear to be in accordance broadly with the lines 
along which thought has been directed by the results of subsequent 
eclipses. Prof. Schuster takes an essentially similar view, and suggests 
that there may be a direct electric connection between the sun and the 
planets. He asks further whether the sun may not act like a magnet 
in consequence of its revolution about its axis. Prof. Bigelow has re- 
cently treated the coronal forms by the theory of spherical harmonics, 
on the supposition that we see phenomena similar to those of free elec- 



CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 79 

tricity, the rays being lines of force, and the coronal matter discharged 
from the sun, or at least arranged or controlled by these forces. At 
the extremities of the streams for some reasons the repulsive power may 
be lost, and gravitation set in, bringing the matter back to the sun. 
The matter which does leave the sun is persistently transported to the 
equatorial plane of the corona; in fact, the zodiacal light may be the 
accumulation at great distances from the sun along this equator of such 
like material. L*hotographs on a larger scale will be desirable for the 
full development of the conclusions which may follow from this study 
of the curved forms of the coronal structure. Prof. Schaeberle, how- 
ever, considers that the coronal phenomena may be satisfactorily ac- 
counted for on the supposition that the corona is formed of streams of 
matter ejected mainly from the spot zones with great initial velocities, 
but smuller than 382 miles per second. Further, that the different types 
of the corona are due to tlie effects of perspective on the streams, from 
the earth's place at the time relatively to the plane of the solar equator. 
Of the physical and the chemical nature of the coronal matter we 
know very little. Schuster concludes, from an examination of tlie 
eclipses of 1882, 1883, and 188G, that the continuous spectrum of the 
corona has the maximum of actinic intensity displaced considerably 
towards the red when compared with the spectrum of the sun, which 
shows that it can only be due in small i)art to solar light scattered by 
small particles. The lines of calcium and of hydrogen do not appear to 
form part of the normal sjiectrum of the corona. The green coronal 
line has no known representative in terrestrial substances, nor has 
Schuster been able to recognize any of our elements in the other lines 
of the corona. 

Stellar evolution. — The spectra of the stars are almost infinitely 
diveisitied, yet they can be arranged with some exceptions in a series 
in whicli the adjacent spectra, esiiecially in the photographic region, 
are scarcely distinguishable, passing from the bluish-white stars like 
Sirius, through stars more or less solar in character, to stars with 
banded spectra, which divide themselves into two appaiently inde- 
pendent groups, according as the stronger edge of the bands is towards 
the red or the blue. In such an arrangement the sun's place is towards 
the middle of the series. 

At i»resent a difference of opinion exists as to the direction in the 
series in which evolution is proceeding, whether by further condensa- 
tion white stars pass into the orange and red stages, or whether these 
more colored stars are younger and will become white by increasing 
age. The latter view was suggested by Johnstone Stoney in 18G7. 

About ten years ago Eitter in a series of papers discussed the behav- 
ior of gaseous masses during condensation, and tlie ])r()bable resulting 
constitution of the heavenly bodies. According to him, a star i)asses 
through the orange and ted stages twice, first during a comparatively

short period of increusiug- temperature, which euhninates in the Avhite 
stage, and a second time during a more prolonged stage of gradual 
cooling. lie suggested that the two groups of banded stars may cor- 
respond to these different jieriods, the young stars being those in wluch 
the stronger edge of the dark band is towards the blue, the other banded 
stars, which arc relatively less luminous and few in number, being those 
which are approaching extinction tli rough age. 

Eecently a similar evolutional order has been suggested, which is 
based upon the hypothesis that the nebulic and stars consist of collid- 
ing meteoric stones in different stages of condensation. 

More recently the view has been put forward that the diversified 
spectra of the stars do not represent the stages of an evolutional 
progress, but are due for the most part to differences of original con- 
stitution. 

The few minutes which can be given to this part of the address are 
insufficient for a discussion of these different views. I purpose, there- 
fore, to state briefly, and with reserve, as the subject is obscure, some of 
the considerations from the characters of their spectra which appeared 
to me to be in favor of the evolutional order in which I arranged the 
stars from their photographic spectra in 1879. This order is essentially 
the same as Vogel had previously proposed in his classification of the 
stars in 1874, in which the white stars, which are most numerous, 
represent the early adult and most persistent stage of stellar life; the 
solar condition that of full maturity and of commencing age; while in 
the orange and red stars with banded spectra we see the setting in and 
advance of old age. But this statement must be taken broadly, and 
not as asserting that all stars, however different in mass and possibly 
to some small extent in original constitution, exhibit one invariable suc- 
cession of si^ectra. 

In the spectra of the white stars the dark metallic lines are relatively 
inconspicuous, and occasionally absent, at the same time that the dark 
lines of hydrogen are usually strong, and more or less broad, upon a 
continuous spectrum, which is remarkable for its brilliancy at the blue 
end. In some of these stars the hydrogen and some other lines are 
bright, and sometimes variable. 

As the greater or less prominence of the hydrogen lines, dark or 
bright, is characteristic of the white stars as a class, and diminishes 
gradually with the incoming and increase in strength of the other 
lines, we are j)robably justified in regarding it as due to some condi- 
tions which occur naturally during the progress of stellar life, and not 
to a peculiarity of original constitution. 

To i)roduce a. strong absorption-spectrum a substance must be at the 
particular temi;)eraiture at which it is notably absorptive; and further, 
this temperature must be sufficiently below that of the region behind 
from which the light comes for the gas to apj)ear, so far as its special 
rays are concerned, as darkness uj)on it. Considering the high tern- 



CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 81 

pcratiiie to whicli liydrogeu must be raised belbre it cau show its cliar- 
acteristic emission aud absorption, we shall probably be right in attribu- 
ting the relative feebleness or absence of the other lines, not to the 
paucity of the metallic vapors, but rather to their being so hot relatively 
to the substances behind them as to show feebly, if at all, by reversion. 
Such a state of things would more probably be found, it seems to me, 
in conditions anterior to the solar stage. A considerable cooling of the 
sun would i)robably give rise to banded spectra due to compounds, or 
to more comi)Iex molecules, which might form near the condensing 
points of the \apors. 

The sun and stars are generally regarded as consisting of glowing 
\apors surrounded by a photosphere where condensation is taking 
])lace, the temperature of the photospheric layer from which the greater 
part of the radiation comes being constantly renewed from the hotter 
matter within. 

At the surface the convection (currents would be strong, i)roducing a 
considerable connnotion, by which the different gases would be mixed 
and Hot allcjwed to retain the ine(j[uality of proportions at different 
levels due to their vapor densities. 

Now tlui conditions of the radiating photosphere and those of the 
gases above it, on which the character of the spectrum of a star depends, 
will be determined, not alone by temperature, but also by the force of 
gravity in these regions; this force will be fixed by the star's mass and 
its stage of condensation, and will become greater as the star continues 
to condense. 

In the case of the sun the force of gravity has already become so 
great at the surface that the decrease of the density of the gases must 
be extremely rapid, passing in the space of a few miles from atmos- 
l^heric pressure to a density inflnitesimally small; consequently the 
temperature-gradient at the surface, if determined solely by expansion, 
must be extremely rapid. The gases here however are exposed to the 
tierce radiation of the sun, and unless wholly transparent would take 
u\) heat, especially if any solid or liquid particles were present from 
condensation or convection currents. 

From these causes, within a very small extent of space at the surface 
of the sun, all bodies with which we are acquainted should fall to a con- 
dition in which the extremely tenuous gas could no h)nger give a vis- 
ible spectrum. The insignificance of the angle subtended by this space 
as seen from the earth should cause the boundary of the solar atmos- 
phere to ap])ear defined. If the boundary which we see be that of the 
sun proper, the matter above it Avill have to be regarded as in an esseU' 
tially dynamical condition — an assemblage, so to speak, of gaseous pro- 
jectiles, for the most ])art falling back upon the sun after a greater or 
less range of flight. But in any case it is within a space of relatively 
small extent in the sun, and probably in the other solar stars, that the

82 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 

reversion which is manifested by dark lines is to be regarded as taking 

place. 

Passing backward in the star's life, we should find a gradual weak- 
ening of gravity at the surface, a reduction of the temperature- gradi- 
ent so far as it was determined by expansion, and convection currents 
of less violence producing less interference with the proportional quan- 
tities of gases due to their vapor densities, while the effects of erup- 
tions would be more extensive. 

At last we might come to a state of things in which, if the star were 
hot enough, only hydrogen might be sufficiently cool relatively to 
the radiation behind to produce a strong absorption. The lower vapors 
would be protected, and might continue to be relatively too hot for 
their lines to appear very dark upon the continuous spectrum ; besides, 
their lines might be possibly to some extent effaced by the coming in 
under such conditions in tho vapors themselves of a continuous spec- 
trum. 

In such a star the light radiated towards the upper part ef the atmos- 
phere may have come from portions lower down of the atmosphere 
itself, or at least from parts not greatly hotter. There may be no such 
great difference of temperature of the low and less low portions of the 
star's atmosphere as to make the darkening effect of absorption of the 
protected metallic vapors to prevail over the illuminating effect of 
their emission. 

It is only by a vibratory motion corresponding to a very high tem- 
perature that the bright lines of the first spectrum of hydrogen can be 
brought out, and by the equivalence of absorbing and emitting power 
that the corresponding spectrum of absorption should be produced ; 
yet for a strong absorption to show itself, the hydrogen must be cool 
relatively to the source of radiation behind it, whether this be con- 
densed particles or gas. Such conditions, it seems to me, should oc- 
cur in the earlier rather than in the more advanced stages of conden- 
sation. 

The subject is obscure, and we may go wrong in our mode of con- 
ceiving of the x>robable progress of events, but there can be no doubt 
that in one remarkable instance the white-star spectrum is associated 
with an early stage of condensation. 

Sirius is one of the most conspicuous examples of one type of this 
class of stars. Photometric observations combined with its ascertained 
l>arallax show that this star emits from i<n'ty to sixty times the light 
of our sun, even to the eye, which is insensible to ultra-violet light, in 
which Sirius is very rich, while we learn from the motion of its com- 
panion that its mass is not much more than double that of our sun. 
It follows that, unless we attribute to this star an improbably great 
emissive power, it must be of immense size, and in a much more diffuse 
and therefore an earlier condition than our sun ; though probably at 
a later stage than those ^hite stars in which the hydrogen lines are 
bright, 



CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 83 

A direct determination of the relative temperature of the photo- 
spheres of the stars might possibly be obtained in some cases from 
the relative position of maximum radiation of their continuous spectra. 
Laiigley has shown that through the whole range of temperature on 
which we can experiment, and presumably at temperatures beyond, the 
maximum of radiation power in solid bodies gradually shifts upwards 
in the spectrum from the infra-red through the red and orange, and 
that in the sun it has reached the blue. 

The defined character, as a rule, of the stellar lines of absorption 
suggests that the vapors producing them do not at the same time 
exert any strong power of general absorption. Consequently, we 
should probably not go far wrong, when the photosphere consists of 
liquid or solid particles, if we could compare select parts of the con- 
tinuous spectrum between the stronger lines, or where they are fewest. 
It is obvious that, if extended portions of different stellar spectra 
were compared, their true relation would be obscured by the line- 
absorption. 

The increase of temperature, as shown by the rise in the spectrum of 
the maximum of radiation, may not always be accompanied by a cor- 
responding greater brightness of a star as estimated by the eye, which 
is an extremely imperfect photometric? instrument. Not only is the eye 
blind to large regions of radiation, but even for the small range of light 
that we can see the visual effect varies enormously with its color. Ac- 
cording to Prof. Langley, the same amount of energy which just enables 
us to perceive light in the crimson at A would in the green produce a 
visual effect 100,000 times greater. In the violet the proportional effect 
would be 1,600, in the blue 62,000, in the yellow 28,000, in the orange 
14,000, and in the red 1,200. Capt. Abney's recent experiments make the 
sensitiveness of the eye for the green near F to be 750 times greater than 
for the red about C. It is for this reason, at least in part, that I suggested 
in 1864, and have since shown by direct observation, that the spectrum of 
the nebula in Andromeda, and presumably of similar nebulae, is in ap- 
pearance only wanting in the red. 

The stage at which the maximum radiation is in the green, correspond- 
ing to the eye's greatest sensitiveness, would be that in which it could 
be m<ist favorably measured by eye photometry. As the maximum rose 
into the violet and beyond, the star would increase in visual brightness, 
but not in proportion to the increase of energy radiated by it. 

The brightness of a star would be affected by the nature of the sub- 
stance by which the light was chiefly emitted. In the laboratory solid 
carbon exhibits the highest emissive power. A stelhir stage in which 
liadiation comes, to a large extent, from a photosphere of the solid par- 
tides of this substance W(mld be favorable for great brilliancy. Though 
the stars are built up of matter essentially similar to that of the sun, it 
does not follow that the proportion of the different elements is every- 
where the same, It may be that the substances condensed in the pho- 



84 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 

tospheres of different stars may differ in tlieir emissive powers, but prob- 
ably not to a great extent. 

All the heavenly bodies are seen by us through the tinted medium of 
our atmosphere. According to Liingley the solar stage of stars is not 
really yellow, but, even as gauged by our imperfect eyes, would appear 
bluish-wliite if we could free ourselves from the deceptive influences of 
our surroundings. 

From these considerations it follows that we can scarcely infer the 
evolutional stages of the stars from a simple comparison of their eye 
magnitudes. We should expect the white stars to be, as a class, less 
dense than the stars in the solar stage. As great mass might bring in 
the solar type of spectrum at a relatively earlier time, some of the 
brightest of these stars may be very massive, and brighter than the 
sun — for example, the brilliant star Arcturus. For these reasons the 
solar stars should not only be denser than the white stars, but per- 
haps, as a class, surpass them in mass and eye brightness. 

It has been shown by Lane that, so long as a condensing gaseous 
mass remains subject to the laws of a purely gaseous body its tempera- 
ture will continue to rise. 

The greater or less breadth of the lines of absorption of hydrogen in 
the white stars may be due to A^ariations of the depth of the hydrogen 
in the line of sight, arising from the causes which have been discussed. 
At the sides of the lines the absorption and emission are feebler than 
in the middle, and would come out more strongly with a greater thick- 
ness of gas. 

The diversities among the white stars are nearly as numerous as the 
individuals of the class. Time does not permit me to do more than 
to record that, in addition to the three sub-classes into which they have 
been divided by Vogel, Scheiner has recently investigated minor differ- 
ences as suggested by the character of the third line of hydrogen near 
G. He has pointed out, too, that so far as his observations go the 
white stars in the constellation of Orion stand alone, with the exception 
of Algol, in possessing a dark line in the blue which has apparently 
the same position as a bright line in the great nebula of the same con- 
stellation; and Pickering finds in his photographs of the spectra of 
these stars dark lines corresponding to the principal lines of the bright- 
line stars, and the planetary nebuhe with the exception of the chief 
nebular line. The association of white stars with nebular matter in 
Orion, in the Pleiades, in the region of the Milky Way, and in other 
parts of the heavens, may be regarded as falling in with the view that 
I have taken. 

In the stars possibly farther removed from the white class than our 
sun, belonging to the first division of Vogel's third class, which are 
distinguished by absorption bands with their stronger edge toward 
the blue, the hydrogen lines are narrower than in the solar spectrum. 
In these stars the density gradient is probably still more rapid, the 



CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 85 

(loi»tli of hydrogen may be less, and possibly tbe hydrogen molecules 
may be affected by a larger number of encounters with dissimilar mole- 
cules. In some rod stars with dark hydro-carbon bands, the hydrogen 
lines have not been certainly observed; if they are really absent it may 
be because the temperature has fallen below the point at which hydrogen 
can exert its characteristic absorption; besides, some hydrogen will 
liave united with the carbon. The coming in of the hydro-carbon bands 
may indicate a later evolutional stage, but the temi)erature may still 
be high, as acetylene can exist in the electric arc. 

A number of small stars more or less similar to those which are 
known by the names of their discoverers. Wolf and Kayet, have been 
found by Pickering in his photographs. These are remarkable for sev- 
eral brilliant groups of bright lines, including frequently the hydrogen 
lines and the line D;,, upon a continuous spectrum strong in blue and 
violet rays, in which are also dark lines of absorption. As some of the 
bright groups appear in his photographs to agree in position with cor- 
responding bright lines in the planetary nebulse, Pickering suggests 
that these stars should be placed in one class with them, but the bright- 
est nebular line is absent from these stars. The simplest conception of 
their nature would be that each star is surrounded by a nebula, the 
bright groups being due to the gaseous matter outside the star. Mr. 
Roberts however has not been able to bring out any indication of 
nebulosity by prolonged exposure. The remarkable star ?; Argfts may 
belong to this class of the heavenly bodies. 

Gaseoufi N^ehuUv. — Ln the nebuhe the elder Herschel saw portions of 
the fiery mist or " shining fluid '' out of which the heavens and the earth 
liad been slowly fashioned. For a time this view of the nebulce gave 
place to that which regarded them as external galaxies, cosmical " sand 
heaps," too remote to be resolved into separate stars; though indeed, in 
1858, Mr. Herbert Spencer showed that the observations of nebulae up 
to that time were really in favor of an evolutional progress. 

In 1804, I brought the spectroscope to bear upon them; the bright 
lines which flashed upon the eye showed the source of the light to be 
glowing gas, and so restored these bodies to what is probably their 
true place, as an early stage of sidereal life. 

At that early time our knowledge of stellar spectra was small. For 
this reason partly, and probably also under the undue influence of the- 
ological opinions then widely prevalent, I unwisely wrote in my orig- 
inal ])aper in 1864, " that in these objects we no longer have to do with 
a special modification of our own type of sun, but find ourselves in 
presence of objects possessing a distinct and peculiar plan of structure." 
Two years later, however, in a lecture before this Association, I took a 
truer position. " Our views of the universe," 1 said, " are undergoing 
important changes; let us wait for more facts, with minds unfettered 
by any dogmatic theory, and therefore free to receivie the teaching, 
whatever it may be, of new observations." 



86 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 

Let lis turn aside for a moment from the nebulae in the sky to the 
concUisions to which philosophers had been irresistibly led by a con- 
sideration of the features of the solar system. We have before us in 
the sun and planets obviously not a haphazard aggregation of bodies, 
but a system resting upon a multitude of relations pointing to a com- 
mon jihysical cause. From these considerations Kant and Laplace 
formulated the nebular hypothesis, resting it on gravitation alone, for 
at that time the science of the conservation of energy was practically 
unknown. These philosophers showed how, on the supposition that 
the space now occupied by the solar system was once tilled by a vapor- 
ous mass, the formation of the sun and planets could be reasonably ac- 
counted for. 

By a totally different method of reasoning, modern science traces 
the solar system backward step by step to a siralar state of things at 
the beginning. According to Helmholtz, the sun's heat is maintained 
by the contraction of his mass, at the rate of about 220 feet a year. 
Whetlier at the present time the sun is getting hotter or colder we do 
not certainly know. We can reason back to the time the sun was suffi- 
ciently expanded to fill the whole space occupied by the solar system, 
and was reduced to a great glowing nebula. Though man's life, the 
life of the race perhaps, is too short to give us direct evidence of any 
distinct stages of so august a process, still the probability is great that 
the nebular hypothesis, especially in the more precise form given to it 
by Koche, does represent broadly, notwithstanding some difficulties, 
the succession of events through which the sun and planets have passed. 

The nebular hypothesis of Laplace requires a rotating mass of fluid 
which at successive epochs became unstable from excess of motion, and 
left behind rings, or more probably perhaps lumps, of matter from the 
equatorial regions. 

The difficulties to which I have referred have suggested to some 
thinkers a different view of things, according to which it is not neces- 
sary to suppose that one part of the system gravitationally supports 
another. The whole may consist of a congeries of discrete bodies even 
if these bodies be the ultimate molecules of matter. The planets may 
have been formed by the gradual accretion of such discrete bodies. On 
the view that the material of the condensing solar system consisted of 
separate particles or masses, we have no longer the fluid pressure 
which is an essential part of Laplace's theory. Faye, in his theory of 
evolution from meteorites, has to throw over this fundamental idea of 
the nebular liypothesis, and he formulates instead a different succes- 
sion of events, in which the outer planets were formed last; a theory 
which has difificulties of its own. 

Prof. George Darwin has recently shown, from an investigation of 
the mechanical conditions of a swarm of meteorites, that on certain 
assumptions a meteoric swarm might behave as a coarse gas, and in 
this way bring back the fluid pressure exercised by one part of the

Kysterii oil the other, which is reciuircd by Laplace's theory. One chief 
a.s.suin])tioii consists in su])i)Osin<^thatsucli inelastic bodies as meteoric 
stones uiiglit attain the effective elasticity of a high order which is 
necessary to the theory through the sudden volatilization of a part of 
tlicir mass at an encounter, by which what is virtually a violent exi>lo 
sive is introduced between tlie two colliding stones. Prof. Darwin is 
careful to point out that it muse necessarily be obscure as to how a 
small mass of scdid matter can take ti)) a V<'ry large amount of energy 
i-n a small fraction of a second. 

Any direct indications from the heav('ns themselves, howevei- slight, 
are of so great value that 1 should, perhajis, in this connection call at- 
tention to a reiMMit remarkal)h^ j)hotograpii, by Mr. Roberts, of the 
great nebula in Andromeda. On tliis plate we seem to have presented 
to i;s some stage of cosmical evokition on a giganti<' scale. The photo- 
graph shows a sort of whirlpool <listurl>ance of tlie lununous matter 
which is distributed in a plane inclined to the line of sight, in which a 
series of rings of bright matter separated by dark si)aces, greatly fore- 
shortened by perspective, surrouiul a large, undefined central mass. 
We are ignorant of the parallax of this nebula, but there can be little 
doubt that we are looking upon a system very remote, and therefore of 
a magnitude great l)eyond our ])Ower of adequate comprehension. The 
matter of this nebula, in whatever state it may be, ai)pears to be dis- 
tributed, as in so many other uebuhe, in rings or spiral streams, and to 
suggest a stage in a succession of evolutional events not inconsistent 
with that which the nel)ular hypothesis requires. To liken this object 
more directly to any jjarticular stage in the formation of the solar sys- 
tem would be " to compare things great with small," and might be in- 
deed to introduce a false amilogy; but, on the other hand, we should 
err through an excess of caution if we did not accept the remarkable 
features brought to light by this photograph as a presumptive indica- 
tion of a ])rogress of events in cosmical history following broadly upon 
tin; lines of Laplace's theory. 

The old view of the original matter of the nebulae, that it consisted 
of a " fiery mist,"

fell at once with the rise of the science of thermodynamics. In 1854 
Helmholtz showed that the sui)position of an original fiery condition 
of the nebulous stuff was unnecessary, since in the mutual gravitation 
of widely separated matter we have a store of potential energy suffi- 
cient to generate the high temperatuieof the sun and stars. We can 
scarcely go wrfUig in attributijig the light of the nebuhc to the conver- 
sion of the gravitational energy of shrinkage into molecular motion.

was sugjiosted by Prof. Tait, and was brouglit to the notice of this As- 
sociation in 1871 by Sir William Thomson in his presidential address. 

Tlie spectrnmof the bright-line nebnhe is certainly not snch a spec- 
trnm as we shonld expect from the flashing- by collisions of meteorites 
similar to those which have been analyzed in our laboratories. The 
strongest lines of the substances which in the case of such meteorites 
would iirst show themselves, iron, sodium, magnesium, liickel, etc., are 
not those which distinguish the nebular spectrum. On tlie contrary, 
this spectrum is chiefly remarkable for a few brilliant lines, very nar- 
row and defined, upon a background of a faint continuous spectrum, 
which contains numerous bright lines, and probably some lines of ab- 
sorption. 

The two most conspicuous lines have not been interpreted; for 
though the second line falls near, it is not coincident with a strong- 
double line of iron. It is hardly necessary to say that though the near 
position of the brightest line to the bright double line of nitrogen, as 
seen in a small spectroscope in 18G1, naturally suggested at that early 
time the possibility of the presence of this element in the nebula^, 1 
have been careful to point out, to prevent misapprehension, tliat in 
more recent years the nitrogen line and subsequently a lead line have 
been employed by me solely as fiducial points of reference in the spec- 
trum. 

The third line we know to be the second line of the first spectrum of 
hydrogen. Mr. Keeler has seen the first hydrogen line in the red, and 
photographs show that this hydrogen spectrum is probably present in 
its complete form, or nearly so, as we first learnt to know it in the ab- 
sorption spectrum of the white stars. 

We are not surprised to find associated with it the line D3, near the 
position of the absent sodium lines, probably due to the atom of some 
unknown gas, which in the sun can only show itself in the outbursts 
of highest temperature, and for this reason does not reveal itself by 
absorption in the solar spectrum. 

It is not unreasonable to assume that tlie two brightest lines, which 
are of the same order, are i^roduced by substances of a similar nature, 
in which a vibratory motion corresponding to a very high temperature 
is also necessary. These substances, as well as that represented by 
the line D3, may be possibly some of the unknoAYn elements which are 
wanting in our terrestrial chemistry between liydrogen and litliium, 
unless indeed D;, be on the lighter side of hydrogen. 

In the laboratory we must have recourse to the electric discharge to 
bring out the spectrum of hydrogen; but in a vacuum tube, though 
the radiation may be great, from the relative fewness of the luminous 
atoms or molecules or from some other cause, the temperature of the 
gas as a whole may be low. 

On account of the large extent of the nebuhie, a comparatively smal 
number of Inmincnis molecules or atoms would probably be sufficient 



CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 89 

to make the iiebuLT as bright as tliey appear to us. Ou such au 
assumption tlie averainc temperature may be low, but the iudividual 
])articles, which by their encounters are luminous, must have motions 
corresponding to a very high temperature, and in this sense be 
extremely hot. 

In such diffuse masses, from the great mean length of free path, the 
encounters would be rare butcorrespondingly violent, and tend to bring 
about vibrations of comparatively short period, as appears to be the 
case if we may judge by the great relative brightness of the more refran- 
gible lines of the nebular spectrum. 

Such a view may, perhaps, reconcile the high temi)erature, which the 
nebular spectrum undoubtedly suggests, with the much lower mean 
temperature of the gaseous mass which we should expect at so early a 
stage of condensation, unless we assume a very enormous mass, or that 
the nuitter coming together had previously considerable motion or con- 
siderable molecular agitation. 

The inquisitiveness of the human mind does not allow us to remain 
content with the interpretation of the present state of the cosmical 
masses, but suggests the question — 

What see'st thou else 
lu the (hulv hackward and ahysm of time? 

What was the original state of things? how has it come about that by 
the side of aging worlds we havenebnh'ein a relatively younger stage? 
Have any of them received their birth from dark suns, which have col- 
lided into new life, and so belong to a second or later generation of the 
lieavenly bodies? 

1 )uring the short historic period, indeed, there is no record of such an 
event; still it would seem to be only through the collision of dark suns, 
of which the number must be increasing, that a temi)orary rejuve- 
nescence of the heavens is possible, and by such ebbings and flowings 
of stellar lite that the inevitable end to which evolution in its appar- 
ently uncomjiensated progress is carrying us can, even for a little, be 
delayed. 

We can not refuse to admit as possible such an origin for nebuLne. 

In considering, however, the fornuition of the existing nebulte we 
must bear in mind that, in the part of the heavens within our ken, the 
stars still in the early and middle stages of evolution exceed greatly in 
nnnd)er those Mhich appear to be in an advanced condition of condens- 
ation. Indeed, we find some stars which may be regarded as not far 
advanced beyond the nebular condition. 

It may be that the cosmical bodies which are still nebulous owe their 
later development to some conditions of the part of space where they 
occur, such as, conceivably, a greater original homogeneity, in conse- 
quence of which condensation began less early. In other parts of space 
condensation may have been still further delayed, or even havenotyet

beftuu. It is worthy of remark that these iiebuhi' group themselves 
about the Milky Way, where we find a prepouderauce of the white-star 
type of stars, and almost exclusively the bright-line stars which Pick- 
ering associates with the planetary nebuhc. Further, Dr. Gill con- 
cludes, from the rai)idity with which they impress themselves upon the 
])latc, that the fainter stars of the IVlilky Way also, to a large extent, 
belong to this early type of stars. At the same time other types of 
stars o(;cur also over this region, and the red hydrocarbon stars are 
found in certain parts ; but possibly these stars may be before or behind 
the Milky Way, and not physically connected with it. 

If light matter l)e suggested by the spectrum of these nebulae, it 
may be asked further, as a pure speculation, whether in them we are 
witnessing possibly a later condensation of the light matter which had 
been left behind, at least in a relatively greater proportion, after the 
first growth of worlds into Avhich the heavier matter condensed, though 
not without some entanglement of the lighter substances. The wide 
extent and great diftuseness of this bright-line nebulosity over a large 
part of the constellation of Orion may be regarded perhaps as point- 
ing in this direction. The diffuse nebulous matter streaming round the 
Pleiades may possibly be another instance, though the character of its 
si)ectrum has not yet been ascertained. 

In the i^lanetary nebuhe, as a rule, there is a sensible increase of the 
faint continuous spectrum, as well as a slight thickening of the bright 
lines toward the center of the nebula, appearances which are in favor 
of the view that these bodies are condensing gaseous masses. 

Prof. G. Darwin, in his investigation of the equilibrium of a rotating 
mass of fluid, found, in accordance with the independent researches of 
Poincare, that when a portion of the central body becomes detached 
through increasing angular velocity, the portion should bear a far larger 
ratio to the remainder than is observed in the planets and satellites of 
the solar system, even taking into account heterogeneity from the con- 
densation of the parent mass, 

Now this state of things, in which the masses though not equal are 
of the same order, does seem to prevail in many nebulte, and to have 
given birth to a large class of binary stars. Mr. See has recently in- 
vestigated the evolution of bodies of this class, and points out their 
radical differences from the solar system in the relatively large mass- 
ratios of the component bodies, as avcII as in the high eccentricities of 
their orbits, brought about by tidal friction, which would play a more 
important part in the evolution of such systems. 

Considering the large number of these bodies, he suggests that the 
solar system should perhaps no longer be regarded as representing 
celestial evolution in its normal form —

but rather as modified by conditions which are exceptional.

It may well bo that in t\nt v<;iy <'arly .stages condorisinjf masses are 
subject to very (liilen-iit (;onditious, and that (;ond(;nsatiori may not al-

ber of points, and proceed in the <lil!'erent cases along very different 
lines of cA'olution. 

Invuihle Motions revealed hy the Spectroscope. — Besides its more direct 
use in the chemical analysis of the heavenly bodies, the spectroscope 
lias given U> us a great and unexpected power of advaiue along the 
lines of the older astronomy, hi the future a higher value may indeed 
be jilaced njion this indirect use of the spectroscope than upon its 
cliemical revelations. 

Jiy no direct astronomical nn-thods could motions of ajijjroach or of 
recession of th(^ stars be even detected, mu<;h less could they be meas- 
ure«l. A ])ody coming directly towaid us or going directly from us ap- 
pears to stand still. In tin' case of the stars we can receive no assist- 
ance from change of size or of brightness. The stars show no true 
disks in (mr instruments, and the nearest of them is so far off that if it 
were approaching us at the rate of a hundred mil<?s in a second of time, 
a whole century of such rapid approach would not do more than increase 
its brightness by the one-fortieth ]>art. 

Still it was only too cleai- that so long as we were unable to ascer- 
tain directly those comi>onents of the stars' motions which lie in the 
line of sight, the S])eed and direction of the solar motion in s])ace, and 
many of the great problems of the constitution of the heavens, must 
remain more or less impeifectly known. Now the spectroscope has 
placed in our hands this i)0wer, which, though so essential, appeared 
almost in th(; nature of things to lie forever beyond our grasp; it 
enables us to measure directly, and under favorable circumstances to 
within a mile per second, or even less, the si)eed of approach or of m- 
cession of a heavenly body. This method of observation has the great 
advantage for the astronomer of being inde]»endent of the distan(;e of 
the moving body, and is therefore as applicable and as certain in the 
case of a body on the extreme confines of the visible universe (so long 
as it is bright enough), as in the case of a neighboring planet. 

Doppler had suggested as far back as 1841, that the same princiide 
on which he had shown that a sound should become sharper or flatter 
if theic were an aiijuoaeh or a recession ])etween the ear and the source 
of the sound, would apply equally to light; and he went on to say that 
tlie difference of color of some of the binary stars might be produced 
in this way by theii- iriotions. Doi)pler was right in that the ])rinciple 
is tiue in the case of light, but he was wjong in the paiticular con- 
clusion which he drew from it. Hven if we suppose a star to be mov- 
ing with a sufhciently enormous velocity to alter sensibly its color to 
the eye, no such change would actually be seen, for the reason that 
the store of invisible light beyond both limits of the visible spectrum, 



92 CELESTIAL [SPECTROSCOPY. 

tlie blue and the red, would be drawn upon, and liglit-Waves invisible 
to us would be exalted or degraded so as to take the place of those 
raised or lowered in the visible region, and the color of the star would 
remain unchanged. About eight years later, Fizeau pointed out the 
importance of considering the individual wave-lengths of which white 
light is composed. As soon however as we had learned to recognize 
the lines of known substances in the spectra of the heavenly bodies, 
Doppler's principle became applicable as the basis of a new and most 
fruitful method of investigation. The measurement of the small shift 
of the celestial lines from their true positions, as shown by the same 
lines in the spectrum of a terrestrial substance, gives to us the means 
of ascertaining directly in miles per second the si)eed of approach or 
of recession of the heavenly body from which the light has come. 

An account of the first application of this method of research to the 
stars, which was made in my observatory- in 1868, was given by Sir 
Gabriel Stokes from this chair at the meeting at Exeter in 1860. The 
stellar motions determined by me were shortly after'conflrmed by Prof. 
Vogel in the case of Sirius, and in the case of other stars by Mr. 
Christie, now astronomer- royal, at Greenwich; but, necessarily, in 
consequence of the inadequacy of the instruments then in use for so 
delicate an inquiry, the amounts of these motions were but approximate. 

The method was shortly afterwards taken up systematically at Green- 
wich and at the Eugby Observatory. It is to be greatly regretted that, 
for some reasons, the results have not been sufliciently accordant and 
accurate for a research of such exceptional delicacy. On this account 
probably, as well as that the spectroscope at that early time had 
scarcely become a familiar instrument in the observatory, astronomers 
were slow in availing themselves of this new and remarkable power of 
investigation. That this comparative neglect of so truly wonderful a 
method of ascertaining what was otherwise outside our powers of ob- 
servation has greatly retarded the progress of astronomy during the 
last fifteen years, is but too clearly shown by the brilliant results which 
within the last couple of years have followed fast upon the recent mas- 
terly application of this method by photography at Potsdam, and by 
eye with the needful accuracy at the Lick Observatory. At last this 
use of the spectroscope has taken its true place as one of the most 
potent methods of astronomical research. It gives us the motions of 
approach and of recession, not in angular measures, which depend for 
their translation into actual velocities upon separate determinations of 
parallactic displacements, but at once in terrestrial units of distance. 

This method of work will doubtless be very prominent in the astron- 
omy of the near future, and to it probably we shall have to look for the 
more important discoveries in sideral astronomy which will be made 
during the coming century. 

In his recent application of photography to this method of determin- 
ing celestial motions, Prof. Vogel, assisted by Dr. Scheiuer, consider-

iiij": the importance of obtaiuing the spectrum of as many stars as pos- 
sible on an extended scale Avithout an exposure inconveniently long, 
wisely determined to limit the part of the spectrum on the plate to the 
region for which the ordinary silver-bromide gelatine plates are most 
sensitive, — namely, to a small distance on each sid(i of Ci, — and to em- 
]>loy as the line of comparison the hydrogen lyie near (I, and recently 
also certain lines of iron. Tlie most minute and complete mechanical 
arrangements were provided for the purpose of securing the absolute 
rigidity of the compari.son spectrum relatively to that of the star, and 
for permitting temperature adjustments and other necessary ones to be 
made. 

The i)erlecti()n of these spectra, is shown by the large number of lines, 
no fewer that two hundred and fifty in the case of Capella, within the 
small region of the spectrum on the plate. Already the motions of 
about iifty stars have been nu'asured with an accuracy, in the case of 
the larger number of them, of about an English mile per second. 

At the Lick Observatory it has been shown that observations can be 
made directly by eye with an accurac^y equally great. Mr. Keeler's 
l)rilliant success has followed in great measure from the use of the third 
and fourth spectra of a grating 14,438 lines to the inch. The marvel- 
lous accuracy attainable in his hands on a suitable star is shown by 
observations on three nights of the star Arcturus, the largest diverg- 
ence of his measures being not greater than six-tenths of a mile jjer 
second, while the mean of the three nights' work agreed with the mean 
of five photographic determinations of the same star at Potsdam to 
within one-tenth of an English mile. These are determinations of the 
motions of a sun so stupendously remote that even the method of 
paralhix practically fails to fathom the depth of intervening space, and 
by means of light- waves which have been, according to Elkin's nominal 
parallax, nearly two hundred years upon their journey. 

Mr. Keeler, with his magnificent means, has accomplished a task 
which I attempted in vain in 1874, with the comparatively poor appli- 
ances at my disposal, of measuring the motions in the line of sight of some 
of the planetary nebuhii. As the stars have considerable motions in 
space, it was to be expected that nebuhe should ])ossess similar motions, 
for the stellar motions must have belonged to the nebuhe out of which 
they have been evolved. My instrumental means, limiting my jjower 
of detection to motions greater than U5 miles per second, w' ere insuffi- 
cient. Mr. Keeler has found in the examination often nebuhe motions 
varying from 2 miles to 27 miles, with one exceptional motion of nearly 
40 miles. 

For the nebula of Orion, Mr. Keeler finds a motion of recession of 
about 10 miles a second. Now, this motion agrees closely with what it 
should api)ear to have from the drift of the solar system itself, so far 
as it has been possible at present to ascertain the i^robable velocity of 
the sun in space. This grand nebula, of vast extent and of extreme

tenuity, is pobably more nearly at rest relatively to the stars of our 
system than any other celestial object we know; still it would, seem 
more likely that even here we have some motion, small though it may 
be, than that the motions of the matter of which it is formed were so 
absolutely balanced as to leave this nebula in the unique position of 
absolute immobility in ^he midst of whirling and drifting suns and sys- 
tems of suns. 

The spectroscopic method of determining celestial motions in the line 
of sight has recently become fruitful in a new but not altogether unfore- 
seen direction, for it has, so to sjDcak, given us a separating power far 
beyond that of any telescope the glassmaker and the optician could 
construct, and so enabled us to penetrate into mysteries hidden in stars 
apparently single, and altogether unsusi)ected of being binary systems. 
The spectroscope has not simply added to the list of the known binary 
stars, but has given to us for the lirst time a- knowledge of a new class 
of stellar systems, in which the components are in some cases of nearly 
equal magnitude, and in close proximity, and are revolving with veloci- 
ties greatly exceeding the planetary velocities of our system. 

The K line in the photographs of Mizar, taken at the Harvard Col- 
lege Observatory, was found to be double at intervals of fifty-two days. 
The spectrum was therefore not due to a single source of light, but to 
the combined eflect of two stars moving periodically in opposite direc- 
tions in the line of sight. It is obvious that if two stars revolve round 
their common centre of gravity in a plane not i)erpendicular to the line 
of sight, all the lines in a spectrum common to the two stars will appear 
alternately single or double. 

In the case of Mizar and the other stars to be mentioned, the spec- 
troscopic observations are not as yet extended enough to furnish more 
than an approximate determination of the elements of their orbits. 

Mizar especially, on account of its relatively long period — about 
one hundred and five days — needs further observations. The two stars 
are moving each with a velocity of about 50 miles a second, probably in 
elliptical orbits, and are about 143,000,000 miles apart. The stars, of 
about equal brightness, have together a mass about forty times as great 
as that of our sun. 

A similar doubling of the lines showed itself in the Harvard photo- 
graphs of 13 Auriga} at the remarkably close interval of almost exactly 
two days, indicating a period of revolution of about four days. Accord- 
ing to Vogel's later observations, each star has a velocity of nearly 70 
miles a second, the distance between the stars being little more than 
7,500,000 miles, and the mass of the system 4.7 times that of the sun. 
The system is approaching us at the speed of about 16 miles a second. 

The telescope could never have revealed to us double stars of this 
order. In the case of /i Auriga^, combining Vogel's distance with 
Pritchard's recent determination of the star's parallax, the greatest 
angular separation of the stars as seen from the earth would be on© 



CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 95 

two-liiiiidrcdtli part of a second of arc, and therefore very far too small 
for the highest powers of the largest telescopes. If we take the rela- 
tion of aperture to separating power usually accepted, an object glass 
of about 80 feet in diameter would be needed to resolve this binary star. 
The spectroscope, which takes no note of distance, magnifies, so to 
speak, this minute angular separation -4,000 times; in other words, the 
doubling of the lines, which is the phenomenon that we have to observe, 
amounts to the easily measurable quantity of 20 seconds of arc. 

There were known, indeed, variable stars of short period, which it 
had been suggested might be explained on the hypothesis of a dark 
body revolving about a bright sun in a few days, but this theory was 
met by the objection that no such systems of closely revolving suns 
were known to exist. 

The Harvard photographs of which we have been speaking were 
taken with a slitless form of spectroscope, the prisms being placed, as 
originally by Fraunhofer, before the object glass of the telescope. This 
method, though it possesses some advantages, has the serious draw- 
back of not permitting a direct comparison of the star's spectrum with 
terrestrial spectra. It is obviously unsuited to a variable star like 
Algol, where one star only is bright, for in such a case there would be 
no doubling of the lines, but only a small shift to and fro of the lines 
of the briglit star as it moved in its orbit alternately toward and from 
our system, which would need for its detection the fiducial positions of 
terrestrial lines compared directly with them. 

For such observations the Potsdam spectograph was well adapted. 
Prof. Vogel found that the bright star of Algol did pulsate backwards 
and forwards in the visual direction in a period corresponding to tlie 
known variation of its light. The explanation which had been sug- 
gested for the star's variability, that it was partially eclipsed at regu- 
lar intervals of G8.8 hours by a dark companion large enough to cut off 
nearly five-sixths of its light, was therefore the true one. The dark 
companion, no longer able to hide itself by its obscureness, was brought 
out into the light of direct observations by mejins of its gravitational 
effects. 

Seventeen hours before minimum, Algol is receding at the rate of 
about 24i miles a second, Avhile seventeen hours after minimum it is 
found to be approaching with a speed of about 28i miles. From these 
data, together with those of the variation of its light, Vogel found, on 
tlie assumi)tion that both stars have the same density, that the com- 
l)anion, nearly as large as the sun, but with about one-fourth his mass, 
revolves with a velocity of about 55 miles a second. The bright star, 
of about twice the size and mass, moves about the common center of 
gravity with the speed of about 20 miles a second. The system of the 
two st;ns, which are about .''>,250,000 of miles apart, considered as a 
whole, is api)roaehing us with a velocity of 2.4: miles a second. The 
great difference in luminosity of the two stars, not Jess than fifty times, 



96 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 

suggests rather that they are in different stages of condeusafion, and 
dissimihir in density. 

It is obvious that if the orbit of a star with an obscure comijauion is 
inch lied to the line of sight, the companion will pass above or below 
the bright, star, ami produce no variation of its light. Such systems 
may be numerous in the heavens. In Vogel's x)hotographs, Spica, which 
is not variable, by a small shifting of its lines reveals a backward and 
forward i)eriodical i)ulsation due to orbital motion. As the pair whirl 
round their common center of gravity, the bright star is sometimes ad- 
vancing, at others receding. They revolve in about four days, each 
star moving with a. velocity of about 56 miles a second in an orbit prob- 
ably nearly circular, and possess a combined mass of rather more than 
two and a half times that of the sun. Taking the most probable value 
for the star's parallax, the greatest angular separation of the stars 
would be far too small to be detected with the most powerful telescopes. 

If in a close double star the fainter companion is of the white-star 
type, while the bright star is solar in character, the composite spectrum 
would be solar with the hydrogen lines unusually strong. Such a spec- 
trum would in itself afford some probability of a double origin, and 
suggest the existence of a companion star. 

In the case of a true binary star the orbital motions of the pair would 
reveal themselves in a small periodical swaying of the hydrogen lines 
relatively to the solar ones. 

Prof. Pickering considers that his photographs show ten stars with 
composite spectra; of these, live are known to be double. The others 
are: r Persei, C Aurigse, d Sagittarii, 31 Ceti, and fi Capricorni. Per- 
haps (i Lyriie should be added to this list. 

In his recent classical work on the rotation of the sun, Duner has not 
only determined the solar rotation for the equator but for different par- 
allels of latitude up to 75°. The close accordance of his results shows 
that these observations are sufficiently accurate to be discussed with 
the variation of the solar rotation for different latitudes which had 
been determined by the older astronomical methods from the observa- 
tions of the solar spots. 

Spectroscopic Photography.— Though I have already spoken inci- 
dentally of the invaluable aid which is furnished by photography in 
some of the applications of the spectroscope to the heavenly bodies, 
the new power Avhich modern photography has put into the hands of 
the astronomer is so great, and has led already, within the last few 
years, to new acquisitions of knowledge of such vast importance, that 
it is fitting that a few sentences should be specially devoted to this 
subject. 

Photography is no new discovery, being about half a century old; it 
may excite surprise, and indeed possibly suggest some apathy on the 
part of astronomers, though the suggestion of the application of pho- 
tography to the heavenly bodies dates from the memorable occasion 



CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 97 

wlicii, ill 1830, Arag'o,;niiionuciiig- totlieAcadeiniede Sciences the great 
discovery of Niepce and Daguerre, spoke of tlie possibility of taking 
]>ictnres of the sun and moon by the new process, j-et that it is only 
within a few years that notable advances in astronomical methods and 
discovery have been made by its aid. 

The explanation is to be found in the comparative nnsnitability of 
the earlier photographic methods for use in the observatory. In jus- 
tice to the earlier workers in astronomical photography, among- whom 
r>ond, De la Rue, J. W. Draper, Rutherfurd, Gould, hold a foremost 
jilace, it is needful to state clearly that the recent great successes in 
astronomiciil photography are not due to greater skill, Mor, to any great 
extent, to superior instruments, but to the very great advantages Avhich 
the modern gelatin dry plate possesses for use in the observatory over 
the methods of Daguerre, and even over the wet collodion film on glass, 
which, though a great advance on the silver plate, went but a little 
way towards putting into the hands of the astronomer a photograhic 
surface adapted fully to his wants. 

The modern silver-bromide gelatine plate, excejDt for its grained tex- 
ture, meets the needs of the astronomer at all points. It ])ossesses extreme 
sensitiveness; it is always ready for use; it can be placed in any posi- 
i'um; it can be exposed for hcmrs; lastly, it does not need immediate 
development, and for this reason can be exposed again to the same 
object on succeeding nights, so as to make up by several installments, 
as the weather may permit, the total time of exposure which is deemed 
necessary. 

Witliout the assistance of photography, however greatly the resources 
of genius might overcome the optical and mechanical difiSculties of 
constructing large telescopes, the astronomer would have to depend in 
the last resource upon his eye. Now we can not by the force of con- 
tinued looking bring into view an object too feebly luminous to be seen 
at the first and keenest moment of vision. But the feeblest light 
which falls ux)on the plate is not lost, but is taken in and stored up 
continuously. Each hour the plate gathers up .'),()00 times the light- 
energy which it received during the tirst second. It is by this power 
of accumulation that the photographic plate may be said to increase, 
almost Avitlumt limit, though not in separating power, the optical 
iiieiiiis at the disj)osal of the astronomer for the discovery or the obser- 
vation of faint objects. 

Two principal directions may be pointed out in which photography 
is of great service to the astronomer. It enables him within the coiii- 
l)aratively short time of a single exposure to secure permanently with 
great exactness the relative positions of hundreds or even of thousands 
of stars, or the minute features of nebuhe or other objects, or the phe- 
nomena of a passing eclipse, a task which by means of the eye and 
liand could only be accomplished, if done at all, after a very great ex- 
penditure of time and labor. Photography puts it iu the power of the

astronomer to acconiplisli in the short span of his own life, and so 
enter into their fruition, great works which otherwise must liave been 
passed on by him as a heritage of labor to sncceediug generations. 

The second great service whicli photogra])hy renders is not simply 
an aid to the powers the astronomer already possesses. On the con- 
trary, the x>late, by recording light-waves which are both too small 
and too large to excite vision in the eye, brings him into a new region 
of knowledge, such as the infra-red and the ultra-violet i^arts of the 
spectrum, which must have remained forever unknown but for artificial 
help. 

The i)resent year will be memorable in astronomical history for the 
practical beginiung of the Photograi)hic Chart and Catalogue of the 
Heavens, which took their origin in an international conference which 
met in Paris in 1887, by the invitation of M. I'Amiral Mou(;hez, director 
of the Paris Observatoiy. 

The richness in stars down to the ninth magnitude of the photo- 
graphs of the comet of 1882 taken at the Cape Observatory under the 
superintendence of Dr. Gill, and the remarkable star charts of the 
Brothers Henry which followed two years later, astonished the astro- 
nomical world. Tlie great excellence of these photographs, which was 
due mainly to the sn]ieriority of the gelatine ])late, suggested to these 
astronomers a complete ma]) of the sky, and a little later gave birth 
in the minds of the Paris astronomers to the grand enterprise of an 
International Cliart of the Heavens. The actual beginning of tlie 
work this year is in no small degree due to the great energy and tact 
with which the director of the Paris Observatory has conducted the 
initial steps, through the inany delicate and difficnlt <iuestious which 
have unavoidably jiresented themselves in an undertaking which de- 
pends upon the harmonious working in common of many nationalities, 
and of no fewer than eighteen observatories in all parts of the Avorld. 
The three years since 1887 have not been too long for the detailed or- 
ganization of this work, which has called for several elaborate prelim- 
inary investigations on special points in which our knowledge was in- 
sufficient, and which have been ably carried out by Profs. Vogel and 
Bakhuyzen, Dr. Trepied, Dr. Scheiner, Dr. Gill, the astronomer-royal, 
and others. Time also was required for the construction of the new 
and special instruments. 

The decisions of the conference in their final form provide for the 
construction of a great photographic chart of the heavens with expo- 
sures corresponding to forty minutes' exposure at Paris, which it is 
exp cted "w ill reach down to stars of about the fourteenth magnitude. 
As each plate is to be limited to 4 square degrees, and as each star, to 
avoid possible errors, is to appear on two plates, over 22,000 photo- 
graphs will be required. For the more accurate determination of the 
positions of the stars, a reseau wath lines at distances of 5 millimeters 
apart is to be previously impressed by a faint light upon the plate, 8.<? 



CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 99 

that the image of the reseau will appear tojjether with the images of 
the stars when the plate is developed. This great work will be divided 
according to their latitudes among eighteen observatories provided 
with similar instruments, though not necessarily constructed by the 
same maker. Those in the British dominions and at Tacubaya have 
been constructed by Sir Howard Grubb. 

Besides the plates to form the great chart, a second set of plates for 
a catalogue is to be taken with a shorter exposure, which will give 
stars to the eleventh magnitude only. These plates, by a recent de- 
cision of the permanent committee, are to be pushed on as accurately 
as possible, though as far as may be practicable i)lates for the chart 
are to be taken concurrently. Photographing the plates for the cata- 
logue is but the first stej) in this work, and only supplies the data for 
the elaborate measurements which have to be made, which are how- 
ever less laborious than would be required for a similar catalogue with- 
cmtthe aid of ])hotography. 

Already Dr. Gill has nearly brought to conclusion, with the assist- 
ance of Prof. Kapteyn, a preliminary photograhic survey of the south- 
ern heavens. 

With an exposm^e sufficiently long for the faintest stars to impress 
themselves upon the plate, the accumulating action still goes on for 
the brighter stars, producing a great enlargement of their images from 
optical and photographic causes. The question has occui)ied the atten- 
tion of many astrononjeis, whether it is possible to find a law connect- 
ing the diameters of these more or less ov^er-exposed images with the 
relative brightness of the stars themselves. The answer will come out 
undoubted in the affirmative, though at ])resent the empirical formuhe 
which have been suggested for this purpose differ from each other. 
Capt. Abney proposes to measure the total photographic action, in- 
cluding density as well as size, by the obstruction which the stellar 
image oilers to light. 

A further (question follows as to the relation which the photographic 
magnitudes of stars bear to those determined by eye. Visual magni- 
tudes are the physiological expression of the eye's integration of that 
l)art of the star's light which extends from the red to the blue. Photo- 
graphic magnitudes represent the plate's integration of another part of 
the star's light, namely, from a little below where the i)o\ver of the eye 
leaves off in the blue to where the light is cut off by the glass, or is 
greatly reduced by want of projjcr corrections when a refracting tele- 
scope is used. It is obvious that the two records are taken by different 
methods in dissimilar units of different parts of the star's light. In the 
case of certain colored stars the photographic brightness is very differ- 
ent from the visual brightness; but in all stars, changes, especially of 
a temporary character, may occur in the photograjihic or the visual 
region, unaccompanied by a similar change in the other part of the 
spectrum. For these reasons it would seem desirable that the two sets 



100 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 

of magnitudes should be tabulated independently, and be regarded as 
supplementary of each other. 

The determination of the distances of the fixed stars from the small

l)ositions of the earth in its orbit, is one of the most refined operations 
of the observatory. The great precision with which this minute angu- 
lar quantity — a fraction of a second only — has to be measured, is so 
delicate an operation with the ordinary micrometer, though, indeed, it 
was with this instrument that the classical observations of Sir Robert 
Ball were made, that a special instrument, in which the measures are 
made by moving the two halves of a divided object glass, known as a 
heliometer, has been pressed into this service, and quite recently, in 
the skillfid hands of Dr. Gill and Dr. El kin, has largely increased our 
knowledge in tliis direction. 

It is obvious that photography might be here of great service, if we 
could rely upon measurements of photographs of the same stars taken 
at suitable intervals of time. Prof. Pritchard, to whom is due the 
honor of having opened this new path, aided by his assistants, has 
proved by elaborate investigations that measures for parallax may be 
safely made upon ^photographic plates, with, of course, the advantages 
of leisure and repetition 5 and he has already by this method determined 
the parallax for twenty-one stars with an accuracy not inferior to that 
of values previously obtained by purely astronomical luethods. 

The remarkable successes of astronomical photography, which de- 
pend upon the plate's power of accumulation of a very feeble light act- 
ing (continuously through an exposure of several hours, are worthy to be 
regarded as a new revelation. The first chapter opened when, in 1880, 
Dr. Henry Draper obtained a picture of the nebula of Orion ; but a 
more important advance was made in 1883, when Dr. Common, by his 
photographs, brought to our knowledge details and extensions of this 
nebula, hitherto unknown. A further disclosure took place in 1885, 
when the brothers Henry showed for the first time in great detail the 
spiral nebulosity issuing from the bright star Maia of the Pleiades, and 
shortly afterwards nebulous streams about the other stars of this group. 
In 1886 Mr. Roberts, by means of a photograph to which three hours' 
exposure had been given, showed the whole background of this group 
to be nebulous. In the following year Mr. Roberts more than doubled 
for us the great extension of the nebular region which surrounds the 
trapezium in the constellation of Orion. By his photographs of the 
great nebula in Andromeda he has shown the true significance of the 
dark canals which had been seen by the eye. They are in reality 
spaces between successive rings of bright matter, which appeared 
nearly straight owing to the inclination in which they lie relatively to 
us. These briglit rings surround an undefined central luminous mass. 
I have already spoken of this photograph. 

Some recent photographs by Mr. Russell show that the great rift in

the Milky Way in Ai<^us, whiclj to the eye is void of stars, is in reality 
iinit'oruiily covered with them. Also, quite recently, Mr. George Hale 
has photographed the prominences by means of a grating, making use 
of the lines H and K. 

StrUar dlstrihutionfi. — The heavens are richly but very irregularly 
inwrought Avith stars, the brighter stars cluster into well-known groups 
upon a background formed of an enlacement of streams and convoluted 
Avindings and intertwined spirals of fainter stars, which becomes richer 
and more intricate in the irregular rifted zone of the Milky Way. 

We, who form part of the emblazonry, can only see the design dis- 
torted and confused; here crowded, there scattered, at another place 
superposed. The groupings due to our position are mixed up with 
those which are real. 

Can we suppose that each luminous point has no relation to the others 
near it than the accidental neighborship of grains of sand upon the 
shore, or of particles of the wind-blown dust of the desert? Surely 
every star, from Sirius and Vega doMU to each grain of the light dust 
of the Milky Way, has its present place in the heavenly pattern from 
tlie slow evolving of its i)ast. We see a system of systems, for the 
broad features of clusters and streams and spiral windings which mark 
the general design are re-produced in every part. The whole is in motion, 
each point shifting its position by miles every second, though from the 
augnst magnitude of their distances from us and from each other, it is 
only l)y the accumulated movements of years or of generations that 
some small changes of relative position reveal themselves. 

The deciphering of this wonderfully intricate constituti(m of the 
heavens will be undoubtedly one of the chief astronomical works of 
the coming century. The primary task of the sun's motion in space, 
together with the motions of the brighter stars, has been already put 
well within (mr reach l)y the spectroscopic method of the measurement 
of star motions in the line of sight. 

I'rom other directions information is accumulating; from photo- 
graphs of clusters and parts of the Milky Way, by Eoberts, in this 
country, Barnard, at the Lick Observatory, and Russell, at Sydney; 
from the counting of stars, and the detection of their configurations 
by Ilolden and by Backhouse; from the mapping of the Milky Way by 
eye. at Parsonstown ; from photograi)hs of the spectra of stars, by Pick- 
ering at Harvard and in Peru, and from the exact portraiture of the 
heavens in the great international star chart which begins this year.

astronomy. There are many others which would claim our attention if 
time permitted. The researches of the Earl of Rosse on lunar radia-

equal to the diameter of the objective. A method applicable not alone 
to celestial objects, but also to spectral lines, and other questions of 
molecular physics. 

Along the older lines there has not been less activity; by newer 
methods, by the aid of larger or more accurately constructed instru- 
ments, by greater refinement of analysis, knowledge has been increased, 
especially in precision and minute exactness. 

Astronomy, the oldest of the sciences, has more than renewed her 
youth. At no time in the past has she been so bright with unbounded 
aspirations and hopes. Never were her temples so numerous nor the 
crowd of her votaries so great. The British Astronomical Association 
formed within the year numbers already about 600 members. Happy 
- is the lot of those who are still on the eastern side of life's meridian. 

Already, alas! the original founders of the newer methods are falling 
out — Kirchhoff, Angstrom, D' Arrest, Secchi, Draper, Becquerel; but 
their places are more than filled; the pace of the race is gaining, but 
the goal is not and never will be in sight. 

Since the time of Newton our knowledge of the phenomena of nature 
has wonderfully increased, but man asks, perhaps more earnestly now 
than in his days, What is the ultimate reality behind the reality of the 
perceptions'? Are they only the pebbles of the beach with which we 
have been playing? Does not the ocean of ultimate reality and truth 
lie beyond ? 



STELLAR NUMBERS AND J) [STANCES: 

I'.V MKANS OK iMI()T(»(;ilAI'lII(: STAR GAIKUNG.* 



By Agnes M. ClkrkE. 



The mere equal- surface couiitiui;' of the stars visible with the same 
instrument in different sections of the sky gives results open to mis-in- 
ter})retation. Admirable in itself, the method fails because it encoun- 
ters what we may call '' systemati(5 errors" in the distribution of the 
stars. With incidental anomalies it is fully competent to deal; they 
should, on a large average, be mutually compensatory; but it breaks 
down before the clustering tendency which pervades, more or less mark- 
edly, the entire sidereal system. Not only are certain parts of space 
more crowded than others, but the crowded parte are related according 
to an obvious plan. They do not occur casually. Their effect is then 
heightened, instead of being eliminated, by multiplied observations. 

The present resources of science, however, seem to offer the means of 
discriminating, to some extent, between real crowding and the simple 
extent of star-strewn space. Although the total number of the stars vis- 
ible in each case with the same telescope might be jirecisely the same, 
their relative numbers, counted by magnitudes, would in all probability 
be very different. In a stratum, supposing the distribution of the stars 
eipuible and their size uniform, their numbers should be nearly quad- 
rupled at each descent of a magnitude. This, of course, is an ideal 
law of ])rogression which we can not expect to find anywhere strictly 
obeyed; but even approximate conformity to itnuist be held to indicate 
with tolerable certainty that the lessening ranks of the stars are, on 
the whole, at distances from us corresponding with their light. Now it 
/.s api>roximately conformed to by the stellar multitude down to the 8.9 
magnitude over the general expanse of the sky, as well as over the zone 
of the ^Lilky Way, But in that zone stars of the ninth and higher mag- 
nitudes very much exceed their due numerical proportions; in other 
words, they are physically, no less than optically, condensed. 

From these circumstances two very important inferences may be de- 
rived : First, that the lower margin of the galactic aggregations lies at 
a distance from us corresponding roughly to the mean distance of a 
ninth magnitude star, costing light some foui'teen hundred years of 
travel; next, that the aggregated objects are average stars, neither

ical contents of the successive spiieres of which the radii are the theo- 
retical mean distances of those sauu^. orders, atibrds strong, if not de- 
monstrative, evidence of a corresponding real ])enetration of space.* 
And since the se(inence continues unbroken down Just to the ninth 
magnitude, we see that the galactic condensations of ninth magnitude 
stars can not be situated nearer to us than their brightness wouhl lead 
us to suppose — can not, in other words, be stars on a lower than the 
ordinary level of luster. 

It is tolerably certain however that the denser star clouds of the 
Milky Way lie far beyond ninth magnitude distance. The ground for 
this assertion is not the appan^nt niinuteness of their components, but 
the singular fact, adverted to by Argelander, that, in the divided Milky 
AVay, running from (\vgnus to the (Jentaur, the shining branches are 
nearly on a par with the dark rift separating them as regards the dis- 
tribution of stars even fainter than the ninth magnitude. The nebu- 
lous efiect to the eye distinguishing the branches is then presumably 
due to more renu)te collections. As to the further limits of these we 
know as yet nothing, except that Heischel's gauge numbei'S left it to 
be inferred that " thinning-out " had Tx'come marked before the attain- 
ment of fourteenth magnitude distance. On these and similar subjects 
enlightennuMit may be hoped tor through the judicious use of nutans 
already at hand. 

For simple star-counts, we have only to substitute star-counts by 
magnitudes over selected areas of the sky.t The r(dati\(' numbers of 
the photometric ranks can hardly fail to give highly \aluable indica- 
tions as to real distribution ; provided (mly that the assumption of a 
general uniformity in the brightness of the stars be valid. Not (it need 
scarcely be said) of a unitbrmity such as to preclude any extent of in- 
dividual variety; all that need be supposed is that the average size of 
a star remains constant throughout sideieal sjiace. This hyi)othesis 
has far more probability in its favor than any other which could be set 
up instead of it; thougli it may receive corrections as our inciuiries ad- 
vance. 

The photometric classification of small stars is one of the many 
branches of sidereal science which will henceforth be prosecuted only 
M-ith the assistance of the camera. Visual methods are inadequate and 
insecure. Those by photography, it is true, have also their dititiculties, 



* The idea of determining distance by distribution seems to have presented itself 
to Dr. Gould in 1871. See Amerkan Journal of Science, vol. vili. 

tThis plan was first suggested by I'rof. Holdeu iu 1883, as a mode of investigating 
the composition of stiir-groupings ("Washburn Publications," vol. ii, p. 113). 
Counts with varied telescopic aixu-tures gave* him the numbers in the successive 
photometric ranks. We believe that a pliotograpliic method of determining thcni 
has since been ado2)ted by him.

rendered to astronomy by the sensitive jjlate. 

We may now des<;rilje the prorMiss of photographic star-gauging, ft 
consists in the enumeration, by ir»agnitudes or half magnitudes, of the 
stars down, say, t^> the fifteenth niagnitude, self-i>i<;ture/J from distinct-

enough to insure the elimination of minoi- irregularities in distribution;

The Milky VVay would naturally be the first subject of inquiry; and 
the eomjiarison of several plates taken in difi'eient sections of its course 
might be it\\mtUni to yield data of great signifieance as regards its 
eonstitution. From si//iply railing over the muster-roll by orders of

hirger ones, or of average stars at average distanc^^s from us, but fur- 
ther and further apart from each other. In the first case the system 
ends abruptly: in the se<ond, it is, as it were, shielded by outliers from 
the ab.s<jlute void. 



i06 STELLAR NUMBERS AND DISTANCE^. 

l*aiticalar attention should be paid to the differences of stellar dis- 
tribution upon plates of the Milky Way proper, and of the dark aper- 
ture between its cloven portions. That this really forms an integral 
Ijart of the galaxy is shown by the far greater profusion of small stars 
there than in the general sky at the outer margins of the galactic 
branches— a, fact in itself fatal to the " spiral theory," by which the 
rift was interpreted as a chink of ordinary sky-background left by the 
interlacing, to the eye, of two great streams of stars, one indefinitely 
more remote than the other. From photographs we may now hope to 
learn what is tlie nature of the distinction between rift and branches — 
■what are the magnitudes, relative numbers, and presumable mean dis- 
tances, of the clustering stars present in the latter, but absent from 
former. 

Gauges taken in the neighborhood of the southern "coal-sack" ought 
to i^rove instructive as to the nature of the nebulous stratum out of 
which it seems as if scooped. If the Milky Way be there shallower 
than elsewhere, a greater uniformity of lustre maybe looked for among 
the stars composing it. No background profusely stored with lessen- 
ing ranks will come into view, and stars below the average of those 
grouped in bright masses, representing their genuine companions, will 
be but scantily present. 

Outside the milky way, two points suggest themselves as likely to be 
settled by photographic gauges. Argelander found that the faintest 
stars in the Durchmusteruny were everywhere in excess of their due 
proportion.* Even at the galactic pole, their increase, as compared 
with the class next below, was sextuple instead of quadruple; in the 
undivided galactic stream it was nine and a half, in the rift eight and 
a half times. If this semblance of crowding in all directions at about 
the mean distance of a ninth magnitude star be no accident of enumera- 
tion, then the milky way is only the enhancement of a phenomenon 
universally present, and the fundamental plan of the sidereal system 
must be regarded as that of a sphere with superficial condensation in- 
tensified in an equatorial ring. The counts, to settle this question, will 
have to extend over a considerable area. 

The second point for photographic investigation refers to the limits 
of the system towards the galactic poles. There is reason to believe 
them comparatively restricted. M. Celoria, of the Milan observatory, 
using a refractor capable at the utmost of showing stars of eleventh mag- 
nitude, obtained for a "mean sounding," at the north pole of the milky 
way, almost identically the same number given by Herschel's great re- 
flector.t That is to say, no additional stars were revealed by the larger 
instrument. Should this evidence be confirmed, the boundary of the 
stellar scheme should here be placed at a maximum remoteness of 3,500 
years of light travel.

As a specimen of a photographic gauge-field on a small scale, we may 
take Prof. Pickering's catalogue, from the Harvard plates, of 947 stars 
within 1° of the north celestial pole.* The region examined lies about 
27° from the zone of the Milky Way, but is nearly reached by a ftiint 
extension from it. Since only one eighth magnitude star, and none 
brigliter, are included in it, the study of distribution, for which it offers 
scmie materials, may be said to begin witli the ninth magnitude. A 
single glance at the synoptical table sutti(;es to show that the numerical 
representation of the higher magnitudes is inadequate. The small 
stars are overwhelmingly too few for the si)ace theymnst occupy if of 
average brightness ; and they are too few in a constantly increasing ratio. 
Either, then, the diminishing orders form part of a heterogeneous col- 
lection of stars of all sizes at nearlv the same distance from us about

ninth are the most closely scattered. The intervals between star and 
star widen rapidly and coutinuonsly (for the sudden dip at 9-5 magni- 
tude is evidently accidental) down to 11.5 magnitude, when a slight re- 
covery, lasting to the thirteenth magnitude, sets in. How far these 
changes are of a systematic character can only be decided from far 
wider surveys. 



THE SUN'S MOTION IN SPACE.* 



By Agnes M. Clerke. 



Rrionro needed two thousand years to disentangle the earth's orbital 
movement from the revolutions of the other planets, and the incompar- 
ably more arduous i)roblem of distinguishing- the solar share in the 
confused multitude of stellar displacements first presented itself as 
p()ssil)ly tractable, little more than a century ago. In the lack as yet of 
a definite solution for it, there is then no ground for surprise, but much 
for satisfaction in the large measure of success attending the strenuous 
attacks of which it has so often been made the object. 

Approximately correct knowledge as to the direction and velocity of 
the sun's translation is indispensable to a profitable study of sidereal 
construction; but apart from some acquaintance with the nature of 
sidereal construction, it is difficult, if not impossible, of attainment. 
One in fact pre-supposes the other. To separate a common element of 
motion from the heterogeneous shiftings upon the sphere of 3,000 or 
4,000 stars is a task practicable only under certain conditions. To be- 
gin with, the proper motions investigated must be established with 
geiHu-al exactitude. The errors inevitably affecting them must be such 
as ])retty nearly, in the total upshot, to neutralize one another. For 
should they run mainly in one direction, the result will be falsified in 
a degree enormously disproportionate to their magnitude. The adop- 
tion, for instance, of a system of declinations as much as 1" of arc 
iistray, might displace to the extent of 10° north or south the point 
fixed upon as the apex of the sun's way (see L. Boss, Astr. Jour., No. 
213). Risks on this score, however, will become less formidable with 
the further advance of juactical astronomy along a track definable as 
an asymptote to the curve of ideal perfection. 

Besides this obstacle to be overcome, there is another which it will 
soon be possible to evade. Hitherto, iu(iuiries into the solar movement 
have been hampered by the necessity for preliminary assumptions of 
some kind as to the relative distances of classes of stars. But all such 
assumptions, especially when applied to selected lists, are highly inse- 
cure; and any fabric reared upon them must be considered to stand 
upon treacherous ground. The spectrographic method, however, here 
fortunately comes into play. " Proper motions " are only angular veloci-

ties. They tell iiotbiiig as to the value of the perspective element they 
may be supposed to include, or as the real rate of going of the bodies they 
are attributed to, until the size of the sphere upon which they are meas- 
ured has been otherwise ascertained. But the displacements of lines 
in stellar spectra give directly the actual velocities relative to the earth 
of the observed stars. The question of their distances is therefore at 
once eliminated. Now, the radial component of stellar motion is mixed 
up precisely in the same way as the tangential component with the 
solar movement; and since complete knowledge of it in a sufficient 
number of cases is rapidly becoming accessible, while knowledge of 
tangential velocity must for a long time remain partial or uncertain, the 
advantage of replacing the discussion of proper motions by that of 
motions in line of sight is obvious and immediate. And the admirable 
work carried on at Potsdam during the last three years will soon afford 
the means of doing so in the first, if only a preliminary, investigation 
of the solar translation based upon measurements of photographed 
stellar spectra. 

The difficulties, then, caused either by inaccuracies in star catalogues 
or by ignorance of star distances, may be overcome; but there is a 
third, impossible at present to be surmounted, and not without misgiv- 
ing to be passed by. All inquiries upon the subject of the advance of 
our system through si^ace start with a hypothesis most unlikely to be 
true. The method uniformly adopted in them — and no other is avail- 
able — is to treat the inherent motions of the stars (their so-called motus 
pecuUares) as pursued indifierently in all directions. The steady drift 
extricable from them by rules founded upon the science of iirobabili- 
ties is presumed to be solar motion visually transferred to them in pro- 
portions varying with their remoteness in space and their situations on 
the sphere. If this presumption be in any degree baseless, the result 
of the inquiry is pro tanto falsified. Unless the deviations from the 
parallactic line of the stellar motions balance one another on the whole, 
their discussion may easily be as fruitless as that of observations 
tainted with systematic errors. It is scarcely however doubtful that 
law, and not chance, governs the sidereal revolutions. The point open 
to question is whether the workings of law may not be so exceedingly 
intricate as to produce a grand sum total of results Avhich, from the geo- 
metrical side, may justifiably be regarded as casual. 

The search for evidence of a general plan in the wanderings of the 
stars over the ftice of the sky has so far jii'oved fruitless. Local con- 
cert can be traced, but no widely-diffused preference for one direction 
over any other makes itself definitely felt. Some regard, nevertheless, 
must be paid by them to the plane of the Milky Way; since it is alto- 
gether incredible that the actual construction of the heavens is with- 
out dependence upon the method of their revolutions. 

The apparent anomaly vanishes upon the consideration of the pro- 
fundities of space and time in Avhich the fundamental design of the 
sidereal universe lies buried, Its coniDosition out of an indefinite

number of partial systems is more than probable; but the inconceiva- 
ble leisureliuess with which their mutual relations develop renders the 
harmony of those relations inappreciable by short-lived terrestrial 
denizens. " Proper motions," if this be so, are of a subordinate kind; 
they are indexes simply to the mechanism of particular aggregations, 
and have no definable connection with the mechanism of the whole. 
No considerable error may then be involved in treating them, for pur- 
poses of calculation, as indifferently directed; and the elicited solar 
movement may genuinely re])resent the displacement of our system rela- 
tive to its more immediate stellar environment. This is j^erhaps the ut- 
most to be hoped for until sidereal astronomy has reached another sta- 
dium of progress, unless, indeed, effect should be given to Clerk Max- 
well's suggestion for deriving the absolute longitude of the solar apex 
from observations of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites {Proc. Roy. Soc, 
vol. XXX, p. 109). But this is far from likely, in the first place, the 
revolutions of the Jovian system can not be predicted with anything 
like the required accuracy. In the second place, there is no certainty 
that the postulated phenomena ha^e any real existence. If however 
it be safe to assume that the solar system, cutting its way through 
space, virtually raises an jetlierial counter-current, and if it be further 
granted that light travels faster with than against such a current, then 
indeed it becomes speculatively possible, through slight alternate accel- 
erations and retardations of eclipses taking place, respectively, ahead 
of and in the wake of the sun, to determine his absolute i)ath in space 
as ])rojected upon the ecliptic. That is to say, the longitude of the 
apex could be deduced together with the resolved part of the solar 
velocity: the latitude of the apex, as well as the component of velocity 
])erpendicular to the plane of the eclii)tic, remaining however unknown. 
The beaten track, meanwhile, has conducted two recent inquirers to 
results of some interest. The chief aim of each was the detection of 
systematic peculiarities in the motions of stellar assemblages after the 
subtraction from them of their common perspective element. By vary- 
ing the materials and method of analysis, Prof. Lewis Boss, director of 
the Albany Observatory, hopes that corresponding variations in the 
ui)shot may betray a significant character. Thus, if stars selected on 
different princii)les give notably and consistently different results, the 
cause of the difference may, with some show of reason, be supposed to 
reside in s])ecialfies of movenuMit appertaining to the several groups. 
Prof. Boss broke ground in fhis direction by investigating 284 proper 
motions, few of which had been similarly employed before {Astr. Jour., 
No. 21."^). They were all taken from an equatorial zone 4° 20' in breadth, 
with a mean declination of +3°, observed at Albany for the catalogue 
of the Astronomische Genellschaft, and furnished data accordingly for 
a virtually inde]>endent research of a somewhat distinctive kind. It 
was carried out to three separate conclusions. Setting aside five stars 
\\ith secular movements ranging above 100°, Prof. Boss divided the 



112

279 left available into two sets, — one of 135 stars brighter, the other of 
144 stars fainter, than the eighth magnitude. The first collection gave 
for the goal of solar translation a point about 4° north of a Lyra", in E. 
A. 280°, Decl. + 43°; the second, one some thirty-seven minutes of 
time to the west of 8 Cygni, in R. A. 286°, Decl. + 45°. For a third 
and final solution, twenty- six stars moving 40"-100" were rejected, and 
the remaining 253 classed in a single series. The upshot of their dis- 
cussion was to shift the apex of movement to E. A. 289°, Decl. + 51°. 
So far as the difference from the previous pair of results is capable of 
interpretation, it would seem to imply a predominant set towards the 
northeast of the twenty-six swifter motions subsequently dismissed as 
prejudicial, but in truth the data employed were not accurate enough 
to warrant so definite an inference. The Albany proper motions, as 
Prof. Boss was careful to explain, depend for the most part upon the 
right ascensions of Bessel's and Lalande's zones, and are hence subject 
to large errors. Their study must be regarded as suggestive rather 
than decisive. 

A better quality and a larger quantity of material was disposed of 
by the latest and perhaps the most laborious investigator of this intri- 
cate problem. M. Oscar Stumpe, of Bonn {Asir ¥ach., Nos. 2999, 3000), 
took his stars, to the number of 1,054, from various quarters, if chiefly 
from Auwers's and Argelander's lists, critically testing, however, the 
movement attributed to each of not less than 10" a century. This he 
fixed as the limit of secure determination, unless for stai-s observed with 
exceptional constancy and care. His discussion of them is instructive 
in more ways than one. Adopting Schonfeld's modification of Airy's 
formula", (the additional computative burden imi)Osed by it notwith- 
standing,) he introduced into his e(iuations a fifth uid^nown quantity 
expressive of a possible stellar drift in galactic longitude. A negative 
result was obtained. ]S[o symptom came to light of "rotation" in the 
plane of the Milky Way. 

M. Stumpe's intrepid industry was further shown in his disregard 
of customary "scamping" subterfuges. Expedients for abbreviation 
vainly spread their allurements; everyone of his 2,108 equations was 
separately and resolutely solved. A more important innovation was 
his substitution of i^roper motion for magnitude as a criterion of re- 
moteness. Dividing his stars on this principle into four groups, he 
obtained an apex for the sun's translation corresponding to each as

THE sun's motion IN SPACE. 113 

Ilcic ngain we find a marked and progressive descent of the apex 
toward the eqnator with the increasing swiftness of tlie objects serv- 
ing for its determination, leading to the suspicion that the most north- 
erly may he the most genuine position, because the one least affected 
by stellar individualities of movement. By nearly all recent investi- 
gations, moreover, the aolar point demireha» been placed considerably 
farther to the east and nearer to the Milky Way than seemed admis- 
sible to their predecessors; so that the constellation Lyra may now be 
said to have a stronger claim than Hercules to include it; and the ne- 
cessity has almost disappeared for attributing to the solar orbit a high 
inclination to the medial galactic plane. 

From both the Albany and the Bonn discussions there emerged with 
siiignlar clearness a highly significant relation. The mean magnitudes 
of the two groups into which Prof. Boss divided his 279 stars were re- 
spectivelj^O.C and 8.(5, the corresponding mean proper motions 21.0" and 
20.!)". In other words, a set of stars on the whole six times brighter than 
another set owned a scarcely larger sum total of apparent displacement. 
Ami that this ai)i)roximate equality of movement really denoted approx- 
imate equality of mean distance was made manifest by the further cir- 
cumstance that the secular journey of the sun proved to subtend nearly 
the same angle Avhichever of the groups was made the standpoint for 
its survey. Indeed, the fainter collection actually gave the larger angle 
(13.73" as against 12.39"), and so far an indication that the stars compos- 
ing it were, on an average, nearer to the earth than the much brighter 
ones considered ai)art. 

A result similar in character was reached by M. Stumpe. Between 
the mobility of his star groups, and the values derived frcmi them for 
the angular movement of the sun, the conformity proved so close as 
materially to strengthen the inference that apparent movement meas- 
ures real distance. The mean brilliancy of his classified stars seemed, 
on the contrary, quite independent of their mobility. Indeed, its 
changes tended in an opposite direction. The mean magnitude of the 
slowest group was C, of the swiftest G.a, of the intermediate pair C.7 
and (».l. And these are not isolated facts. Comparisons of the same 
knid, and leading to identical conclusions, were made by Prof. East- 
man at Washington in 1889. (Phil. Soc. Wash. Bnlletin, vol. xi, p. 143; 
I'rovcfiluujs Amcr. Association, 1889, p. 71.) 

What meaning can we attribute to them ? Uncritically considered, 
they seem to assert two things, one reasonable, the other palpably ab- 
surd. The first — that the average angular velocity of the stars varies 
inversely with their distance from ourselves — few will be disposed to 
doubt; the second — that their average apparent luster has nothing to 
do with greater or less remoteness — few will be disposed to admit. 
r>ut, in order to interpret truly M'ell-ascertained if unexpected relation- 
ships, we nuist renu'mber that the sensibly moving stars used to deter- 
mine the solar translation are chosen from a multitude sensibly fixed,

and that the proportion of stationary to traveling stars rises rapidly 
Avitli descent down the scale of nnignitude. Hence a mean strnck in 
disregard of the zeros is totally misleading, while the account is no 
sooner made exhaustive than its anomalous character becomes largely 
modified. Yet it does not wholly disajipear. There is some warrant 
for it in nature. And its warrant may perhaps consist in a i)reponder- 
ance, among suns endowed with high phym-al speed, of small, or 
slightly luminous, over powerfully radiative bodies. Why this should 
be so it would be futile, even by coujecture, to attempt to explain. 



A SOUTHEKN OBSERVATOKY.* 



By Agnes M. Clekke. 



On Tuesday, August 21, 1888, the Union steamship Mexican crossed 
tlie line outward-bound for the cape, and a certain proportion of her 
l)assengers, amongst whom was tlie present writer, found themselves 
for the first time in the southern hemisphere. A few nights later, halt 
an hour's darkness before moonrise gave time for a splendid display of 
unfamiliar stars. The Southern Cross lay prone toward the west; 
.Vlpha and Beta Centauri shone triumphantly above it; Achernar was 
climbing the sky on the other side of a pole singularly denuded of 
bright companionship; the lucid streams and knots of the Milky Way 
were reflected in a pearly shimmer from gently heaving waves, the 
brilliant effect of the entire sidereal landscape being enhanced by the 
presence of Jupiter and Mars close together in Scorpio, while the dim 
cone of the Zodiacal Light, tapering upward from the sun's i^lace, faded 
out above them on the black background of the sky. 

The " four stars," 

Noil viste mai fuor cli' alia prima gente, 
ai)pealed to median al imagination as a symbol and a prophecy of the 
uplifting of the Cross in the waste places of the earth. Modern trav- 
ellers regard them from a more i)rosaic point of view, and are apt to be 
''disappointed" at their unequal luster and slightly unsymmetrical 
arrangement. The firmament they help to adorn, however, is of a 
splendor at first sight absolutely startling, and at all times peculiarly 
suggestive. The dullest mind can hardly fail to be roused to wonder 
by the appearance of the galaxy as it extends past Sirius amidst the 
gratid procession of the stars in Argo, or where the great rift in its 
structure spans the heavens from the Centaur to the Swan. The intri- 
cacy of its branches, the curdled texture of its surface, the stupendous 
collection of distant suns, almost i)alpably rounded out from the void 
of si)ace in Sagittarius; the abrupt vacuity of the '' Coalsack," recall- 
ing the dark " lanes" tunneling certain nebuhe and star clusters, invite, 
only to baffle, speculations, which the tempting analogues presented by 
the never-setting Magellanic Clouds, with their mixed contents of stars 
and nebuhe, help further to stimulate.

116 A SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY. 

" What is the Milky Way!" may be called the question of questions 
for future astronomers; but it has only of late been brought to some 
extent within the range of available methods. More feasible aims 
prompted the foundation of southern observatories. English official 
astronomy in particular took its rise directly from the requirements of 
English seamen. Elamsteed was commissioned to determine the places 
of the stars, not because any speculative interest attached to them, 
but simply in order that they might serve for divisions (as it were) of 
the great dial plate of the heavens, upon which the moon marked 
Greenwich time, and might hence be got to tell the longitude in every 
part of the world. 

But English astronomy was incomplete, even from a strictly utilita- 
rian point of view, so long as it failed to embrace the whole of the 
celestial sphere; and in proportion as England's colonial emiure be- 
came consolidated, the need of a supplementary establishment to that 
at Greenwich was rendered more and more imperative. 
• In the choice of its situation, there was scarcely room for a doubt. 
The Cape of Good Hope was already distinguished as the scene of 
Lacaille's labors in 1851-'52; and these furnished the virtual starting- 
point of austral astronomy. As their result, 10,000 southern stars and 
forty -two nebulse were known at the beginning of this centurj^; and an 
indication of a somewhat aaomalous character (yet the only one of any 
kind at hand) had been procured regarding the figure of our globe 
south of the equator. It seemed to show tliat the earth bulged the 
wrong way, — in other words, was prolate instead of oblate. Its cor- 
rection or verification was hence of extreme interest, and the re-meas- 
urement of Lacaille's arc of the meridian came to be recognized as a 
prime necessity of geodetic science. By an order in council, dated 
October 20, 1820, the establishment of a permanent observatory at the 
Cape was accordingly decreed, and the first royal astronomer was im- 
mediately afterwards appointed, in the person of the Rev. Eearon 
Fallows, of St. Johns College, Cambridge. 

A Cumbrian weaver's son, he had contrived, while still a boy work- 
ing at the loom, to attain a notable proficiency in mathematics; and, 
his talents attracting attention, some gentlemen of the neighborhood 
subscribed to procure him a suitable education. He graduated in 
1813, as third wrangler to Herschel's and Peacock's first and second, 
and was elected on the earliest opportunity a fellow of his college. The 
prosperity and happiness of his life culminated when he found himself 
as His Majesty's astronomer at the Cape, in a position to marry the 
eldest daughter of his first patron, the Eev. Mr. Hervey, of Bridekirk. 

This however was the last fortunate event of his life. Disappoint- 
ment and clmgrin presided over the entire series of poor Fallows' ex- 
periences in South Africa. Suspense through circundocutory proceed- 
ings at home, anxiety due to the misconduct or lawlessness of those 
employed by him in the colony, vexation indescribable at the defects

of the instrnmeiit be had chiefly relied upou, personal illness, the 
deaths of all the cliildren successively born to liira, at last exhausted 
his vital energies, and he died of dropsy supervening upon sunstroke 
and scarlet fever, July 25, IS'U, at the age of 42. His grave is in a spot 
of ground consecrated by himself Avithin a stone's throw of the broken 
pier of his transit instrument; and the syrlnga trees he planted now 
lean their blossom-laden branches towards the upper windows of the 
dwelling house where he might have hoped to spend many useful and 
happy years. 

But his work at the Cape, was not thrown away. The buildings of 
thi' new observatory were well planned and solidly executed; its site 
was judiciously chosen on a slightly rising ground 3 miles southeast of 
Gape Town, almost islanded by the converging sinuosities of the Lies- 
beck and the Salt Ki\'er, A desolate spot enough it must indeed have 
been when Fallows took his first survey of it. Wolves were then still 
common in the neighborhood; the cries of jackals mingled at night 
with the metallic chirping of the Cape frogs; the last Salt Eiver hip- 
])opotanuis had, not long before, met an untimely death by drowning 
in its marshes ; the mole-burrowed hillside was bare of almost every 
form of vegetation save a luxuriant crop of thistles. 

Now the smiling (nilture (nerywhere apparent indicates the neigh- 
borhood of a retined English home. The slopes are in spring all abloom 
with lilies, asters, and gladioli, delicately striped and shaded with pink 
and mauve, or flaunting gaudily in purple and orange; Australian wil- 
lows — the Cape substitute for laburnums — make golden patches against 
the dark foliage of thick-growing pines planted half a century ago by 
Lady ^laclear on the simple plan of inserting a cone into every mole 
hill; clumps of aloes and eucalyptus recall the vicinity of the tropics; 
a grove of oaks and cypresses, due to Prof. Piazzi Smyth's skill in 
forestry, brings memories of England; white arums, irrepressible and 
all-dilfusive, nestle round tree roots, strain uj)wards to the light through 
the midst of tall shrubs and hedges, fling themselves in lavish profu- 
sion amidst the lush grass, marching processioually (so to speak) or 
halting in dense clusters, and making milky ways of blossom along 
every marsh and meadow. Here indeed are lilies, enough and to spare, 
to strew, " with full hands," the graves of a hundred young Marcelluses. 

In succession to the weaver's lad from Cockerinouth, there was ap- 
])()inted to direct the new South African observatory a solicitor's clerk 
from Dundee. Thomas Henderson began, at the age of 15, to de- 
vote his leisure hours to astronomy. His instinct however was for 
the mathematical part of the science; and he had probably never seen 
a transit instrument, or handled a telescope, until after he came to re- 
side at Edinburgh in 1819. His twofold life prospered. In his legal 
capacity he became secretary to Lord Advocate Jeffrey; his astro- 
nomical calculations brought him to the notice of Dr. Thomas Young, 
Sir John Herschel, Capt. Basil Hall, and other eminent men. In the 



118 A 80UTilERN OBSERVATORY. 

summer of 1829, Dr. Young gave in charge to Prof. Rigaud a memo- 
randum urging Henderson's superior qualifications for the post of 
superintendent of the Nautical Almanac, vacated by his own death a 
fortnight later; and the recommendation was doubtless influential in 
procuring for him after three years the offer of the Cape observatory. 

Assuming the chief command there in April, 1832, he accumulated 
in thirteen months, a surprising number of valuable observations, still 
in part unpublished. One of the results derived from them was how- 
ever of so striking a character as to attract instant and universal at- 
tention. It was nothing less than the first authentic determination of 
the distance of a fixed star. 

After Sirius and Canopus, the brightest star in the heavens is Alpha 
Centauri. This beautiful object is easily resolved into two, — one fully 
three times brighter than the other. And these two circulate round 
each other, or rather round their common center of gravity, in a period 
of about eit'hty-eight years. The system thus formed was discovered 
by Henderson to have an ^' ;innual parallax " of just one second of arc. 
That is to say, the apparent places of the component stars as viewed 
from opposite sides of the earth's orbit, differed, through a familiar 
effect of perspective, by T62V00 of the distance from the horizon to the 
zenith. The more refined determinations of Drs. Gill and Elkin, while 
establishing its reality, have since shown that Henderson's parallax 
was somewhat too large. The actual distance of Alpha Centauri from 
the earth is, in round numbers, 25,500,000,000 of miles. Even the 
a^therial vibrations of light occupy four years and four months in span- 
ning this huge interval; yet Alpha Centauri (so far as is at present 
known) is the nearest neighbor of our sun in space. 

The attractive power of each of these coupled stars appears to be 
about equal ; but while one is nearly twice, the other is only half as 
luminous, in proportion to the amount of matter it contains, as our 
own sun. Hence, according to our present notions, the darker, more 
condensed body must be considerably more advanced on the road 
towards extinction than its brilliant companion, and an attentive study 
of its spectrum ought to give interesting results. 

Henderson returned to Europe in 1833, unable, in the uncertain state 
of his health, to support the discomforts — long since banished with the 
wolves and jackals — of a residence at Observatory Hill. He became 
astronomer royal for Scotland in 1834, and died suddenly of heart dis- 
ease ten years later. 

The third astronomer at the Cape, and the first whose term of activity 
there was prolonged to a fitting conclusion, was an Irishman. Sir 
Thomas Maclear was born at In ewtown Stewart, in County Tyrone, March 
17, 1794. His career, like those of his predecessors, swerved insensibly 
towards the stars. He was a physician, practicing at Biggleswade, 
in Bedfordshire, whose astronomical proclivities had been fostered by 
the genial influence of Admiral Smyth, when summoned, as one may 
say, to the celestial charge of the southern hemisphere. 



A SOUTHERN 015SERVAT0RY. 119 

Tlio royal observatories at Greemvich iiud the Cape of Good Hope 
form togetlier an astronomical establishment such as no other nation 
besides our own can boast of possessing. It fitly represents the world* 
wide dominion of which it is the corollary. British empire on the seas 
led directly to British empire over the skies, the one gaining' complete- 
ness as the inevitable consequence of the expansion of the other. South- 
ern astronomy seems the proper appanage of the Anglo-Saxon race. 
Originating with Ilalley's expedition to St. Helena in 1677, Lacaille's 
work at the Cape formed the only exception worth mentioning to the 
rule of its jirosecntion by our fellow-countrymen on either side of the 
Atlantic. So far, indeed, as geometrical astronomy is concerned, it 
would survive, without vital injury, the destruction of all results except 
those obtained at Greenwich and the Cape. Geometrical astronomy is 
now however only one, though the most important, branch of the 
science. 

Sir Thomas Maclear proved an indefatigable and skillful observer. 
He co-operated energetically with Sir John Herschel, whose memorable 
stay at Feldhausen, 3 miles from the Royal Observatory, coincided with 
the first four years of his tenure of office. He re-measured and ex- 
tended Lacaille's arc, thereby not only removing all doubt as to the 
conformity to scientific prediction of the earth's figure, but providing 
an invaluable groundwork for the survey of the entire colony, now in 
active course of prosecution by Maj. Morris, E. E. The long list of 
comets observed by Maclear includes Halley's,Donati's,Biela's,Encke's 
at four returns, and the great '' southern" one of 1843. He accumu- 
lated materials for three star catalogues, prepared for the press and 
])ublished by his successors, Mr. Stone, the present Kadcliffe observer, 
and Dr. Gill. And so completely had his interests become identified 
with those of his adopted home that he continued, after retiring from 
the observatory in 1870, to reside in its vicinity; and on his death, 
-Inly 14, 1870, was laid to rest within its grounds. His son, Mr. George 
Maclear, retains charge of the transit circle procured by his father in 
18r)5. It is an exact copy of that erected by Sir (ieorge Airy at Green- 
wich. 

Mr. Stone was chief assistant at Greenwich when induced to accept 
the appointment to the Cape by the opportunity itofi'ered for the prep- 
aration of an extensive star catalogue, by the comparison of which 
with the earlier Madras and Brisbane catalogues something might be 
learned about the movenunits of southern stars. This object was most 
satisfactorily attained by the publication of the '' Cape Catalogue for 
1880," (fontaining nearly 12,500 accurately determined star-places. By 
a pure coincidence. Dr. (iould's simultaneous work at Cordoba had the 
same scope. Its brilliant results are familiar to all astronomers. 

Mr. Stone surrendered the direction of the observatory, in June, 1879, 
to the present royal astronomer. Dr. Gill is one of a long line of dis- 
tinguished Aberdonians. An astronomer by " irresistible impulse," he, 



120 A SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY. 

like Bessel, exchanged lucrative mercantile i)ursnits for the compara- 
tively scanty emoluments awaiting the votaries of the stars. The 
"patines of bright gold," with which Urania's treasure chests overflow, 
are not of terrestial coinage. 

The distance of the sun was the tirst problem ui)on which Dr. Gill 
delivered a substantial attack ; and his solution of it still remains the 
best obtained by celestial trigonometry, corresponding so closely with 
Newcomb's value of the same great unit, derived from direct measure- 
ment of the velocity of light, as to reduce within reassuringly narrow 
limits the uncomfortable margin of uncertainty left by the transits of 
Venus. In the observations of Mars made for this purpose at Ascen- 
sion in 1877,* Dr. Gill employed the instrument of his predilection, 
called — on the lucus a non lucendo principle — a " heliometer." 

A heliometer is a telescope of which the object glass has been sawn 
in two. This does not sound like, nor would it be, an improvement for 
purposes of simi)le star-gazing; but the end in view is different. It is 
that of precisely determining the angular distances between adjacent 
stars, or between a planet»and stars near it, though in many cases be- 
yond the range of the ordinary micrometer. The following is the way 
in which this end is compassed. 

The half lenses of the object glass are separable by a very fine screw 
motion, and they form independent and separable images of any object 
upon which the telescope is pointed. These images unite into one when 
the two segments unite to complete one circle; as they are made to 
slide apart, the images to slij) sideways asunder, to an extent which can 
be measured with the minutest accuracy by exquisitely divided scales 
read with a powerful microscope. In the actual process of observation, 
the telescope is fixed upon a point midway between the stars under 
scrutiny, so that the field of view is, to begin with, empty. Neither star 
can-be seen. Then the segments of the object glass are moved oppo- 
sitely along a line brought beforehand to agree with the line of direc- 
tion between the stars, until the more westerly (say) of the pair as 
imaged by one segment, and the more easterly as imaged by the other, 
begin simultaneously to appear, and are at last carefully made to coin- 
cide in the middle of the field. After the scales have been read, the 
motion is reversed, and a similar coincidence is brought about between 
the oppositely corresi)onding stars — that is, between the easterly nu^m- 
ber of the pair shown by segment No. 1, and the westerly member of 
the pair shown by segment No. 2, The total distance traversed is, of 
course, equal to twice the distance between the stars. 

The refinements, however (which can not here be explained), attend- 
ant upon these operations are what make their results valuable, and 
the process of educing thein laborious. With the Copernican "tri- 
quetrum " the measured apparent intervals between any two of the

liciivenly bodies could l)e depended upon to within ten minutes; witli 
the new IJepsold heliometer the error of ;i .sin<;le observation is less 
than one-tenth of a second of arc. So that accuracy has been increased, 
in the course of three and a half centuries, some six thousantl times. 
At what cost of patience and exi)enditure of the counted moments of 
individual human lives, as the iruit of what illuminations of genius, 
throes of invention, failures, and disapi)ointments in some (piarters, 
compensatory triumphs in others, can never rightly be told. The prog- 
ress acliieved was by "leaps and l)Ounds;" it must henceforth be by 
slow and painful foot lengths, as the limit of possible accuracy is brought 
imperceptibly nearer. It is not likely that the astronomical data of 
three :ind a half centuries hence will be six thousand times more ac- 
curate than those at our disj)osal. 

The heliometer is, of all others, the instrument best adapted for the 
work (exceedingly simple in princii^le, yet delicate to an almost incon- 
ceivable degree in the details of its execution) of determining stellar 
l)arallaxes. The diameter of the earth's orbit aflbrds a base line 
180,000 miles in length, from opposite extremities of>4\'hich — that is, 
at opposite seasons of the year — the distances between the object to 
be examined and two "comparison stars" are measured. Theinfinites- 
imal alternate shift of the star nearest the earth to and from those with 
which it is comj^ared (assumed with little risk of error, to be indefi- 
nitely remote) is called its "parallax." From its angular amount the 
distance in miles of the star from the earth can be at once derived. 

The minuteness of this little parallactic see-saw is difficult to be real- 
ized by those unpracticed in such matters. A displacement of one sec- 
ond on the sphere is equivalent to a shifting across the width of a 
liuman hair placed 70 feet from the eye. But no known star has so 
large a ]iarallax as one second, which is as much as to say that no 
known star i^ so near to us as 1*00,000 times the distance of the sun. 
Positive results might, under these circumstances, well have been de- 
spaired of; yet they have, in a nund)er of cases, been attained, and 
form the surest groundwork so far provided for investigations into the 
mechanism of the skies. 

Dr. (Jill's observations for stellar ])arallax were begun at the Cape 
July 5, 1.S81, with the Dunecht heliometer, of which he had become the 
possessor by private purchase from the Earl of Crawford. He had as a 
coadjutor Dr. AV. L. Elkin, who is now in very effective charge, at Yale 
College, of the only heliojneter yet ere<'te<l on any part of tlie American 
continent. Xine stars in all were measured, of which two gave no in- 
dications of possessing any sensible iiarallax. Both, remarkably enough,

out to be physically connected, consequently, at nearly the same dis- 
tance from ourselves with the giant luminary they attend. This doubt 
will shortly be set at rest by I)r. Gill's measures, now being- carried out 
with a dilierent pair of stars. 

Sirius was shown by the observations of 1881-'83 to be at a distance 
such that its light occupies nearly nine years in reaching us. Its real 
brightness is that of sixty -three suns, while it attracts the semi-obscure 
body circulating round it in forty-nine years, with no more than thrice 
the solar power. This extraordinary luster relative to mass seems to 
belong to all stars of the Sirian pattern as to spectrum, and is due most 
likely in j^art to their elevated temperatures, in part to the scantiness 
of their vaporous surroundings. 

The success of the Cape investigations in this difficult branch of as- 
tronomy invited their continuation on a larger scale, and with more 
powerful instrumental means. The Government Avas accordingly in- 
duced to sanction the construction, by Messrs. Kepsold of Hamburg, 
of a new heliometer of above 7 inches aperture, mounted last year in a 
building erected^for its reception on the summit of the sunny slopes of 
Observatory Hill. The first view of this great star-measuring machine 
has, it must l)e admitted, a somewhat bcMdldering effect upon the un- 
initiated onlooker. The eye end literally bristles with steel rods, han- 
dles, and screw-heads, almost as numerous as the stops of an organ, 
and requiring no less skill and knowledge for their proper use. The 
revolving " head" is armed with a strange-looking, radiated head-gear, 
like the sails of a windmill, or a nimbus of tin sectors surviving from a 
barbarous age. 

Everything here has however a definite purpose. These surprising 
" flappers " are, in fact, screens of wire gauze of graduated closeness, 
used for equalizing the brightness of the stars in the field of view, and 
so enabling the eye to hold the balance, as it were, even between them. 
The complex apparatus close to the observer's hand furnishes him with 
the means of easy control over the whole of the sky-gauging mechanism 
provided for him. None more perfect has been devised, yet the study 
of its " errors" is the indispensable preliminary to its use. 

Only the sublime end in view could render tolerable the process of 
arriving at a complete "theory" of such an instrument. The patient 
laboriousness so readily commended in the heroes of science costs more 
than the readers of their biographies are apt to imagine. Interminable 
readings of scale divisions, interminable castings-up of the columns of 
decimals expressing the differences of the successive readings, are not 
in themselves exciting occupations. But they must be pursued during 
some hours a day for a whole year before the "division errors" of the 
new heliometer can be regarded as completely abolished because per- 
fectly known. Nor is this all. Elaborate corrections and interpreta- 
tions of other kinds have to be added, to say nothing of endless ancl 
anxious Vecautions in the observations themselves— precautions 
against personal and physiological, as well as against atmospheric and

instrumental, causes of error. Accuracy is iudeed arduous; and the 
astronomer who is not what the okl Eomans used, in their grand way, 
to look down upon as a cumini .sector^ had better learn another profes- 
sion. 

Twenty-seven stars in the southern hemisphere aie now being, or are 
about to be, measured for parallax with the Cape heliometer. Their 
selection was governed by the ultimate object of gathering information 
as to the scale and plan of the marvellous aggregation of suns to which 
our sun belongs, and amidst wliich it is moving, in an unknown orbit, 
(O meet unknown destinies. For this purpose, facts of two kinds are 
urgently needed — facts relative to the real distribution, and facts relative 
to the real movements of the stars in space. Dr. Gill's operations, when 
completed, can not fail to bring important reinforcements to our present 
small store of each. 

Ten stars of the first nuignitude lie to the south of the celestial equa- 
toi', of which nine (Alpha Centauri being already safely disposed of) 
are in course of measurement at intervals of six mouths. The upshot 
will be to give the average distance corresponding to the first order of 
stellar brightness in the southern hemisphere. An analogous result 
has lately been published by Dr. Elkiu for the ten chief northern lumi- 
naries. Their distance, "all round," proves to be thirty-six "light- 
years." That is to say, light from their photospheres affects our senses 
only after our planet has revolved, on an average, thirty-six times in 
its orbit round the sun. So that all our knowledge, even of the stars 
presumably nearest to the earth, refers, in thisyear 1880, to the "mean 
ei)och " 1853. We shall learn presently whether the " mean epoch " for 
the southern bright stars corresponds approximately to this date, or 
whether a marked disparity may countenance the surmise of our eccen- 
tric situation in the group of luminaries to which our sun more espe- 
cially belongs. 

Dr. Gill's list includes five second magnitude stars, the annual per- 
spective displacements of which (if large enough to be measurable) will 
give something like a definite scale of increasing distance with de- 
creasing luster. A conclusion will then be feasible as to the rate of 
movement of the sun in space. The elder Struvemade it about 5 miles 
a second, but on the supposition of the brightest stars being between 
two and three times nearer to us than they seem really to be. We can 
now see that the actual speed of the solar system can scarcely fall short 
of 12, or exceed 20 miles, a second. By a moderate estimate, then, our 
position in space is changing to the extent of 500,000,000 of miles annu- 
ally, and a collision between our sun and the nearest fixed star would 
be inevitable (were our course directed in a straight line toward it) after 
the lapse of fifty thousand years! 

The old problem of " how the heavens move," successfully attacked 
in the solar system, has retreated to a stronghold among the stars, from 
which it will be difficult to dislodge it. In the stupendous mechanism 
of the sidereal universe, the acting forces can only betray themselves to

us by the varying time configurations of its parts. But as yet our 
knowledge of stellar movements is miserably scanty. They are appar- 
ently so niiinito as to become perceptible, in general, only through ob- 
servations of great precision extending over a number of years. Even 
the quickest-moving star would spend two hundred and fifty-seven years 
in crossing an arc of the heavens equal to the disc of the full moon. 
Yet all the time (owing to the inconceivable distances of the objects in 
motion) these almost evanescent displacements represent velocities in 
many cases so enormous as to baffle every attempt to account for them. 
"Eunaway stars" are no longer of extreme rarity. One in the Great 
Bear, known as " Groombridge, 1830," invisible to the naked eye, but 
sweeping over at least 200 miles each second, long led the van of stellar 
speed. Prof. Pritchard's photograpic determination of the parallax of 
II Cassiopeine shows, however, that inconspicuous object not only to be 
a sun about forty times as luminous as our own, but to be traveling at 
the prodigious rate of 300 miles (while Dr. Elkin's result for Arcturus 
gives it a velocity of little less than 400 miles) a second! 

The ''express" star of the southern hemisphere, so far, is one of the 
fourth magnitude situated in Toucan. Its speed of about 200 miles a 
second may however soon turn out to be surpassed by some of the 
rapidly-moving stars picked out for measurement at the Cape. Among 
them are some pairs "drifting" together, and presumed therefore to be 
connected by a special physical bond, and to lie at nearly the same dis- 
tance from ourselves. This presumption will now be brought to the 
test. 

A remarkable and typical change has affected the aims pursued at 
our southern national observatory since Dr. Gill assumed its direction. 
There has been a widening of purpose matching the widened scope of 
astronomical science due to the development of new methods. The 
practical usefulness of the establishment was never more conspicuous 
than at present. The shipping interests, railway service, and survey- 
ing operations of South Africa are in immediate dependence upon it. 
The whole fabric of the " old astronomy" — so far as one hemisphere is 
concerned — is held together by the re- determinations of " fundamental" 
and " standard " stars continually in progress at it. But while noth- 
ing of what was previously held in view has been relinquished, much 
of incalculable value has been added. Above all, the ideal, or purely 
intellectual, side of astronomy has obtained recognition, and in a form 
likely to be memorable in the history of the science. 

The celestial-photographic Paris Congress of April, 1S87, might be 
called '' epoch making," for this reason alone — that it marked, officially 
and forever, investigations into the structure of the sidereal universe 
as part of the proper duty of astronomers. These inquiries, the most 
sublime of the physical kind with which the mind of man can be occu- 
pied, will not henceforth be abandoned to individual caprice, to be 
l)rosecuted by necessarily inadequate means, and neglected when those 
means (as they could not fail to do) should collai)se under the strain

put iii>on them. They Avill be pursued p'avely, systematically, by the 
concerted ett'orts of successive generations, througli the toil of innu- 
merable unpretending workers guided to effectiveness by the highest 
jntelligence of the times. A measure of success is, under these circum- 
stances, certain, and even a small measure of success in this direction 
will suttice to broaden and deepen the channels of all future human 
thought. 

Hence the profound significance of the decisions of the Paris CongTess, 
by which an international scheme for i)liotographically charting the 
hea\ens and cataloguing a large proportion of their contents was set 
on foot. Fortunately for its own reputation our Government, after 
long d<'lay, has ado])te(l what might have seemed the foregone conclu- 
sion that a sliare in this work is England's right and duty, and has au- 
thorized the construction of the requisite instruments for Greenwich an*d 
the Cai)e. Before another year has elapsed they will be mounted in 
their resi)ective places and the recording i)rocess, to be carried on simul- 
taneously at fourteen or fifteen observatories in every part of the world, 
will have begun. 

INIean while Dr. (Jill, to whose initiatory energy the approaching reali- 
zation of this great plan is due, has almost comi)leted a preliminary task 
of ^•ital importance to its due accomjdishment, as well as to sidereal 
science in general. One of the most famous achievements of recent as- 
tronomy is the '■'■Bonn Durchmusterung,^^ a list of 324,000 stars from the 
^orth Pole to 2 degrees south of the equator, observed by Argelander 
at Bonn. Until it was compiled the smaller stars were a nameless 
crowd with no recognized identity. For the purposes of science they 
could scarcely be said to exist. But once 

Set in note-book, learned and conned by rote, 
tlieir changes could no longer elude notice; and detected change leads 
connnonly to increased knowledge. A solid foundation was moreover 
laid for the study of sidereal statistics, destined, perhaps, to lead to 
momentcnis results at no distant future. 

An extension of the ^'- Durchmusterung^^ to the southern hemisphere 
was contemplated from the first, but was more easj^ to contemplate 
than to execute. No southern observatory was in a condition to un- 
dertake a task so colossal. Dr. Schonfeld, Argelander's successor at 
Bonn, carried, however, the enumeration as far as the southern tropic, 
where it seemed likely to stop, when some surprising jihotographs of the 
great comet of 1882, projected on wide tlelds of stars, taken at the 
Koyal Observatory with the help of Mr. Allis, of Mowbray, opened to 
Dr. Gill the possibility of comiiletiug Argelander's stellar review by 
this relatively unlaborious method. And the possibility is rapidly 
being converted into an accomplished fact. Two assistants, Mr. C. Kay 
Woods and Mr. Sawerthal, are employed every fine night in expos- 
ing plates with instruments, each consisting virtually of two telescopes, 
one for concentrating upon the plates the raj'S of the multitudinous 
stars within a field of 36 square degrees, the other for enabling the

operator to keep them steadily there until their self-portraiture is 
finished. The whole heavens, south of the troijic of Capricorn, will have 
been covered in duplicate by next April, after which only some supple- 
mentary exposures will remain to be made. 

Prof. Kapteyn, of Leyden, is meanwhile busy measuring the plates 
successively transmitted to him from the Gape, and the resulting cata- 
logue — the first derived from photographs — will probably be in the 
hands of astronomers by the year 1892. All stars down to the ninth 
magnitude, and many fainter, will be included in it to the number of 
fully two hundred thousand. This important enterprise is a private 
and personal one. The entire responsibility for it, financial and other, 
is borne by Dr. Gill. 

There is a i^rospect that before another year has elapsed, the vexed 
question of the sun's distance will have been definitely set at rest. 
The immediate objects of measurement for the purpose with the 
Gai)e heliometer, in combination with some other instruments of the 
same class in Germany and America, are three of the minor planets — 
Iris, in October and November, 1888; Sappho and Victoria during the 
summer of 1880. The position of the planet between successive pairs 
of stars distributed along its path during the favorable period when it 
culminatci^ near roidnight will be determined simultaneously from op- 
posite sides of the equator according to a method devised by Dr. Gill, 
so stringent and insistent for accuracy that the errors admitted by it 
must be minute indeed. While celestial surveyors have 270 asteroids 
at their disposal to mark the apexes of their triangles, the long gaps 
of time between the transits of Venus need be of little concern to them. 

To describe the whole of the tasks in progress at the Royal Obser- 
vatory — the cometary work chiefly in the hands of Mr. Finlay, the first 
assistant, the lunar, and planetary observations, the laborious correc- 
tions of star places and star motions — would demand more space than 
is at our command. What has here been aimed at is merely to indi- 
cate the directions in which the activity of the establishment tends to 
expand, and to show that these directions are representative of the 
present, and must be decisive as to the future of astronomy. There is 
room indeed, were the material means at hand, for further expansion. 
In the spectroscopic department the Gape record is still a blank. Yet 
the wise outlay of a few hundred pounds would suffice to set on foot, 
under exceptionally favorable circumstances as to climate and situa- 
tion, inquiries into the physical condition of southern stars of extreme 
interest and inevitable necessity. 

There is much to be learned, as well as enjoyed, from a visit to the 
Gape Observatory. Not only the work done there, but the manner in 
which it is done, is impressive. Lessons of earnestness of purpose, 
stability of aim, and cheerful self-devotion can scarcely be missed by 
the itinerant lover of astronomy, in whose mind they will be tempered 
and illuminated by reminiscences of the beauty of flowers by day and 
of the glory of stars at night. 



SOME applicatio:n^s of physics and mathematics 

TO GEOLOGY.* 



By C. Chree, m. a. 



1. — HOME PHYSICAL AND MATHEMATtCAL DATA. 

Mauy of the terms employed in treating- of the properties ainl condi- 
tions of matter have in common nse a somewhat vagne nieaning. The 
meaning, so far as ck^arly outlined, is also only too often difterent from 
that which the physicist intends to convey. As regards terms such as 
rigid, solid, plastic, viscous, etc., it seems to me that even eminent 
geologists are a])t to be misled by the popular usage, so that they fall 
into error respecting the data which mathematical and physical science 
places at their disposal. It thus seems advisable on the present occa- 
sion to clear the ground by briefly considering the sense attached to 
these terms by the more exact school of physicists. To render the fol- 
lowing statements intelligible it is necessary to explain the meaning 
scientitically attached to the terms stress and strain. By stress is 
meant a force referred to unit of area of the surface across which it 
acts; by strain the increase in the distance between two material points 
divided by the original distance. For instance, if a vertical bar n 
square inches in cross section fixed at the upper end, sustain a load of 
t tons, and the load be uniformly distril)uted over the cross section, the 
longitudinal stress is tn, taking the square inch as unit of area and the 
weight of 1 ton as unit of force. If a portion of the bar increase in 
length from 100 to 100.01 in(;lies, and the increase be uniformly distrib- 
uted over the portion lengthened, the longitudinal strain is (100.01 — 
100)xlO— 2, or .0001. 

The writers who have had most influence on the present scientific 
usage of English terras dealing with i)hysical properties are unquestion- 
ably Prof. Clerk Maxwell and Sir William Thomson. The former 
gives the following definitions in his Theory of Heat t : "A body which 
when subjected to a stress experiences no strain would, if it existed, be 
called a perfectly rigid body. There are no such bodies. - - -"

"A body which when subjected to a given stress at a given tempera- 
ture experiences a strain of definite amount, which does not increase 
when the stress is prolonged, and which disappears completely when 
the stress is removed, is called a i^erfectly elastic body." 

" If the form of the body is found to be permanently altered when 
the stress exceeds a certain value, the body is said to be soft or plastic, 
and the state of the body when alteration is just going- to take place 
is called the limit of perfect elasticity." 

" If the stress, Avhen it is maintained constant, causes a strain - - - 
which increases continually with the time, the substance is said to be 
viscous 



V 



A viscous material may be either solid or fluid. It is regarded by 
Maxwell as fluid when any stress, however small, produces a constantly 
increasing strain. Maxwell draws a distinction between elasticity of 
bulk and elasticity of sliape — the latter being j)eculiar to solids — which 
is more fully treated of by Sir William Thomson. A body possesses 
perfect elasticity of bulk when on the removal of the stress it returns 
to its original volume, even though the form of its surface be perma- 
nently altered. Both writers regard it as certain that solid bodies will 
retain perfect elasticity of bulk under comi)ressive stresses which far 
exceed the limit of elasticity of shape. The following statement em- 
bodies the views of Sir W. Thomson* : " If we reckon by the amount 
of pressure, tliere is probably no limit to the elasticity of bulk in the 
direction of the increase of pressure for any solid or fluid; but whether 
continued augmentation produces continued diminution of bulk toward 
zero without limit, or whether for any or every solid or fluid there is a 
limit toward which it may be reduced in bulk, but smaller than which 
no degree of pressure, however great, can condense it, is a question 
which can not be answered in the present state of science." 

Maxwell, by denying the existence of a perfectly rigid body, main- 
tains that every solid can sustain stress or transmit force only by suf- 
fering strain. Thus, on depositing a feather on the most solid block of 
iron we produce in the iron a system of strains, infinitesimally small it 
is true, but whose existence can no more be questioned than the exist- 
ence across the surface separating the iron and the feather of forces 
balancing the portion of the feather's weight left uncompensated by 
the air pressure. The hypothesis quoted above from Sir W. Thomson, 
that there may be a limit beyond which no body can be compressed, is 
not inconsistent with Maxwell's statement. The hypothesis regards 
the ratio of the increment of strain to the increment of pressure as ulti- 
mately becoming infinitesimally small, but it in no way implies that 
this ratio ever becomes absolutely zero. 

In a solid bar, supposed pexfectly elastic, exposed to longitudinal 
stress, the ratio of the stress to the strain is styled Young's modulus. In 
many materials Young's modulus varies in magnitutle according to the 



Mathematical and Physical Papers, vol, in, pp. 7-8,

dircc'tioii in wbich the axis of the bar is takeu. Thus, in ordiuary 
woods there is a marked diiiereiice between the value of Young's mod- 
ulus in the direction of the ])ith of the tree and in any jierpendicular 
direction. Materials in which Young's modulus is independent of the 
direction in whicli the axis of the experimental bar is taken are termed 
isotropic ; all others are termed aiolotropic. 

Tn an isotropic elastic solid it is sui)posed, on the ordiuary British or 
biconstaut theory, that the value of Young's modulus, K, alone is iusuf- 
ticicnt to detine the elastic structure, and that some other elastic^ con- 
stant uuist be known. For many purposes the most convenient addi- 
tional constant is the ratio of the lateral contraction to the longitudinal 
extension — each measured per unit of length — in a bar exposed to sim- 
ple longitudinal traction. For instance, if the diameter of a bar under 
uniform longitudinal stress change from 10 to !»-9907 inches the lateral 
contraction is 0-00003, and if the longitudinal strain be 0-0001, the ratio 
of lateral contraction to longitudinal extension is 0-3. This ratio is 
termed Foisson's ratio, and is represented here by //. 

On the uniconstant theory of isotropy // must have the value 0-25, 
which certainly accords well with experiments on glass and some of 
the more common metals, especially iron and steel under certain con- 
ditions. 

On the biconstaut theory // may have any value within certain limits. 
The existence of these limits, it must be admitted, is seldom recog- 
nized, and experimental results are not infrequently referred to which 
are inconsistent with the view taken here, viz, that // must lie between 
and 0.5. If, however, ?/ were negative in any material a circular bar 
of this material, when subjected to uniform longitudinal tension, would 
increase in diameter; while if ?/ were greater than 0.5, the bar, when 
fixed at one end and subjected to a torsional couple at the other, would 
twist in the opposite direction to the applied force. Until these phe- 
noinena are shown to present themselves in isotropic materials — and the 
experimental verification ought to be easy — it seems legitimate to sup- 
l)Ose that when experimentalists deduce values for ?/ which lie outside 
of these limits, their experiments refer to bodies whose constitution is 
diflcrent from what is assumed in their mathematical calculations. 

'^riie properties attributed to an isotropic elastic solid by the ordiuary 
mathcnuitical theory are as follows: 

(A) The strain must be elastic, /. e., it must disappear on the removal 
of the stress. 

(B) The ratio of stress to strain must be independent of the magni- 
tude of the stress, or, in Prof. Pearson's words, the stress-strain rela- 
tion must be linear. 

(C) The strains must be small. 

(D) The values of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in a bar of 
the nuiterial must be independent of the direction in which the axis of 
the bar is taken.

130 SOME APPLICATIONS OF 

The last property alone distiuguislies i 5otroi)ic from aM>l()tropi(5 elastic 
solids. 

(A) answers to Maxwell's definition, but (B)and (C) are not assumed 
by Maxwell. In other words, a solid may be perfectly elastic Avithout 
showiui;- a linear stress-strain relation, or possibly even after the strains 
Im ve become large. Thus, for the sake of clearness, I shall call Max- 
well's limit of perfect elasticity the physical limit, and the limits sup- 
plied by (B) and (C) the first and second mathematical limits respec- 
tively. 

It is not infi-etiuently taken for granted that the pliysical and the 
first mathematical limit are necessarily identical, L c, that the elasticity 
is certainly not i^erfect when the stress-strain relation ceases to be 
linear. According however to some experimentalists cast iron is as 
perfectly elastic as any other metal in the sense of Maxwell's definition, 
but the stress-strain relation for even small strains is sensibly not 
linear.* This is, of course, a question for experimentalists to decide, 
but in any case where their final verdict is, that the stress-strain rela- 
tion is sensibly not linear, the employment of the ordinary mathemati- 
cal theory is unjustifiable. It must be admitted that the principle (C) 
is a very vague one, leading to no exact limit, and that it seldom re- 
ceives any very formal acknowledgment. It is, however, clearly rec- 
ognized, and a reason for it assigned in the following statement, due to 
Thomson and Tait : t " The mathematical theory of elastic solids imposes 
no restrictions on the magnitudes of the stresses except in so far as that 
mathematical necessity requires the strains to he small enough to admit of 
the principle of super-position.''^ The italics are mine. The meaning is 
that the strains must be small fractions whose squares are negligible 
compared to themselves. If this principle be neglected and the mathe- 
matical equations be supposed to apply when the strains are large, the 
difficulty of giving them a consistent physical interpretation is very 
great if not wholly nnsurmountable. 

In most materials having any claim to be regarded as elastic solids 
the stress-strain relation for most ordinary stress systems certainly 
ceases to be linear while the strains are still small. We shall thus in 
the meantime leave the condition (C) out of account, though we shall 
have to return to it in treating of the so-called "theories of rui:>ture." 

The existence of the properties (A), (B), (D), presupposed by the 
mathematical theory, is determined not solely by the chemical constitu- 
tion of the body, but also by the treatment to which it has been sub- 
jected. Thus a freshly annealed copper wire may, when loaded for the 
first time, be far from satisfying conditions (A) or (B), and yet by the 
j)rocess of loading and unloading it may be brought into a state of ease, 
wherein these two conditions are very approximately, if not exactly

tultilled. so Ions' h>s the stress does no exceed a certain limit. Again, 
tlie fact tluit a large mass of metal is sensibly isotropic is no sufficient 
reason for attributing isotropby to tbe same metal when rolled into 
thin plates or drawn into thin wires. 

It is ([uite possible that the three conditions (A), )B), and (D) repre- 
sent an ideal state which is never actually reached, and that a diver- 
gence may always be shown by the use of very delicate apparatus. If 
this be true, then the results obtained by the mathematical theory can 
not (daim absolute correctness. It seems however to be satisfactorily 
established that many materials in the state of ease satisfy these con- 
ditions with at least a very close approach to exactness, so that the 
results of the mathematical theory when properly restricted are then 
sufhciently exact for practical purposes. 

From the preceding statements it will be seen that it is of the utmost 
importance to know what are the limits within Avhich the conditions 
assumed by the mathematical theory are satisfied with sufficient 
exactness to justify its application. This question must of course be 
settled by experiment, but it is beset by various difficulties which ought 
to be clearly recognized. These arise in part from the serious obstacles 
in the way of a complete experimental knowledge, and in part from 
the want of a proper understanding between those interested in the 
practical and theoretical sides of the subject, and a consequent confu- 
sion in the terms used. 

To avoid complication let us begin by supi)osing the mathematical 
limit of i)erfect elasticity to coincide with the physical. Let us con- 
sider the simple case of a bar under uniform longitudinal traction. We 
may su^ipose the bar isotropic, and in consequence of suitable treat- 
ment perfectly elastic for loads not exceeding Li. IS'o mechanical 
treatment, we shall suppose, can render it perfectly elastic for loads 
greater than L2. It does not follow that a load L2 will necessarily rui3- 
ture the bar either immediately or in course of time, but simply that 
for any load greater than Lj the strain is not perfectly elastic. Increas- 
ing the load from zero we should reach a load L3, i)robably greater 
than L., that Avcjuld in process of time rupture the bar, or a load L4 
gTeater than L3 that produces immediate rupture. All these loads are 
supposed to refer to unit of area. 

Now in the initial state of the bar we should be entitled to apply the 
mathematical theory only until the load Lj was reached. When we 
aim at finding the utmost capability of the material under longitudinal 
load, we may perhaps apply the theory until the load L2 is reached, but 
here we must stop. To apply it until the loads L3 or L4 are reached — 
assuming these greater than L, — is clearly inadmissible. 

Results of a similar kind hold for all the comparatively simple forms 
of stress — such as pure conipressi(m, torsion, or bending — in which 
practical men are interested. There are limits to the state of perfect 
elasticity lower than the limits at which rupture takes place, at least 
immediately.

designing should ever be strained beyond the elastic limit, and this 
end he of course desires to obtain with the least possible expenditure 
of material. Thus ideally he might be expected to calculate the dimen- 
sions of each piece, so that for the maximum load it is to be subjected 
to it shall just not pass beyond the limit of perfect elasticity. There 
are however in general agencies, such as wind pressure, dynamical 
action of a moving load, etc., whose effects are not very fully under- 
stood and Avhose magnitude can not always be foreseen. Thus it is 
the custom to allow a wide margin for contingencies. Now the limit 
of perfect elasticity seems the natural quantity to employ in allowing 
for this margin, but the uncertainties attending its determination are 
such that it is customary to employ the breaking load instead. The 
breaking load for the particular kind of stress the member in question is 
to be exposed to is divided by some number, e. </., 4 or 5, called a factor 
of safety, and the dimensions of the member are calculated so that its 
estimated load shall not exceed the quotient of the breaking load by 
the factor of safety. The engineer varies the factor of safety accord- 
ing to the nature of the load, and according to the confidence he pos- 
sesses in the uniformity of the material and in the completeness of his 
knowledge as to the vicissitudes the structure is exposed to. It has 
thus come to pass that attention has been largely directed to the 
breaking loads, and theories have been constructed which aim profess- 
edly at supi)lying a law for the tendency to rupture, under the most 
general stress systems possible, of materials whose rupture points have 
been found under the ordinary simple stress systems emi>loyed in 
experiment. 

There are oidy two such theories of rupture for isotropic materials 
that at present possess any general repute. To understand them the 
reader requires to know that for any stress system there are at every 
j)oint in an isotropic elastic material three principal stresses along three 
mutually orthogonal directions, and likewise three principal strains 
whose directions coincide with those of the i^rincipal stresses. If an 
imaginary small cube of the material be taken at the point considered 
with its faces perpendicular respectively to the three principal stresses, 
then no tangential stresses act over these faces. In a bar under a uni- 
formly distributed longitudinal stress L per unit ol cross section, two 
of the principal stresses are everywhere zero, and the third is parallel 
to the axis and equals L. If E be Young's modulus, and ?/ Poisson's 
ratio for the material, supposed isotropic and elastic, the greatest prin- 
cipal strain is everywhere L/E and its direction is parallel to the axis. 
The two remaining principal strains are each — ^L/E and they may be 
supposed to have for their directions any two mutually perpendicular 
lines in the cross section of the bar. 

One of the theories referred to above is, that when the algebraic dif- 
ference between the greatest and least of the principal stresses at any 



PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TO GEOLOGY. 133 

point — a pvessure beiii^* rcckoiiod negative — attains a certain value, 
rupture will ensue at this point. Thus, if in descending order of mag- 
nitude, the princij)al stresses at a point be Tj, T2, T^j, theuTi— T3 is the 
stress difference* at this ]>oint, and the theory asserts that rui)ture will 
idtimately ensue if the stress difference anywhere equals L3, the load for 
ultimate ruj)ture of a bar of the material by longitudinal traction ; while 
if the stress difference anywhere equals L4, the load for immediate rup- 
ture by longitudinal traction, then immediate rupture will ensue. 

The second theory, which is supported by the great authority of de 
Saint-Yenant,t replaces the stress difference of the first theory by the 
greatest strain. It thus asserts that the condition for rupture is found 
by equating the largest value found anywhere for the greatest strain 
to the longitudinal strain answering to longitudinal traction L3, or to 
that answering to the traction L4, according as the rupture is ultimate 
or immediate. This theory maintains that extension in some direction 
is necessary for rupture. 

The two theories may, as in the case of pure longitudinal traction, 
lead to the same result; but in general they do not, so one at least of 
them must be wrong. When we exaudne the theories, still supposing 
the mathematical and physical limits of perfect elasticity the same, a 
very obvious difficulty t ])resents itself. It is assumed that the stress- 
difference and greatest strain are derived by the mathematical theory; 
but that theory applies only so long as the material is everywhere per- 
fectly elastic, whereas rui)ture, at least when immediate, presents itself 
after the elastic limit has been passed. Thus if the application of the 
mathematical theory leads to values for the maximum stress difference 
and greatest strain ecpial to the values of these quantities answering 
to rupture, at all events when immediate, the true conclusion would 
seem to be that the fundamental hypothesis on which the treatment 
l)roceeds, viz, that the material follows the laws assumed by the mathe- 
matical theory, has been shown to be incorrect. Nothing has been 
proved except that the elastic limit must be passed and that the nuithe- 
raatical theory does not apply. 

The only logical way of interi)reting the theories is to suppose that the 
maximum stress difference and greatest strain are to be compared not 
with the values that answer to rui)ture, but either with those that 
answer to the limit of perfect elasticity or with those derived by dividing 
the values answering to rupture by some factor of safety. This factor 
nuist then be large enough to prevent the limit of perfect elasticity being- 
passed. Thus from either point of view we encounter a formidable diffi- 
culty, viz, the uncertainty of what is the limit of perfect elasticity.

134 SOME APPLICATIONS OF 

We have supposed that a bar may be brought iuto a state iu which 
it is perfectly elastic for longitudinal tractions not exceeding L2. An- 
swering to this we have L2 for the stress difference, and L2/E for the 
greatest strain. Now if the two theories described above really apply 
to the limit of perfect elasticity, the one would seem to maintain that 
L2 is the limiting value of the stress difference, the other that L2/E is 
the limiting value of the greatest strain for all possible stress systems 
in material of the same kind as that in the bar. The complete experi- 
mental proof or disproof of such theories is not likely to be easy. Thus 
taking for instance the case of longitudinal traction, suppose it were 
shown that a certain method of treatment which raises the elastic limit 
for load parallel to the axis of a bar does not raise the elastic limit for 
longitudinal load in a bar whose length lay in the cross section of the 
original bar. This would only suffice to prove that the treatment 
adopted did not give a fixed elastic limit the same for all kinds of 
strain, it would leave the possibility of such a limit being obtained in 
some other way an open question. 

In the preceding remarks the mathematical and x)hysica] limits of 
perfect elasticity have been supposed identical. When they differ, the 
mathematical limit is of course that which must be employed in deter- 
mining the range of the mathematical theory. It will certainly not ex- 
ceed the physical limit. I may add that while for certain structures 
such as isolated boilers the physical limit may most nearly concern the 
practical engineer, in other structures, such as girder bridges, the 
stress-strain relation is assumed to be linear in designing the several 
parts, so that the first mathematical limit is then of the utmost practi- 
cal importance. 

In the previous discussion of the stress-difference and greatest-strain 
theories, as settling the limits of application of the mathematical 
theory, it has been taken for granted that the condition (C) was safe- 
guarded by them. Kow in most ordinary systems of loading this is 
probably the case, but it is not always so. For instance, if we assume 
the mathematical theory to hold, a solid isotropic sphere under a 
uniform surface-pressure shows none but negative strains, and the 
three principal stresses are everywhere equal. Thus the greatest 
strain is everywhere negative, and the stress difference everywhere 
zero. This is true irrespective of the magnitude of the surface pressure, 
and so, ac(;ording to both theories, the stress-strain relation would be 
linear and the mathematical theory would apply, however large the 
pressure was. According to the theories, one might continue to employ 
mathematical fornuila^. which indicated a reduction of the sphere to one- 
millionth of its original volume. It is obvious, however, that a re- 
duction of the volume by even a tenth would produce strains which aie 
probably far in excess of those admitted by the principle (C). In 
formulating an objection to the universal application of the theories, I 
have preferred to attack them on the side of the principle (C) so as to 



PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TO GEOLOGY. 135 

«hu\v clearly that the lii.uli authority of Thoins(.n aud Tait is on my 
side. The example considered raises however what seems to me at 
least ail e(inally strong argument against the theories from the side of 
the principle (P.). For we must remember that the stresses inside the 
material are determined by the intermolecular forces. Now whatever 
•noleculos may be, and however they may act on one another, it seems 
incredible that the molecular forces should lead to one and the same 
stress-strain relation, however nnich the mean molecular distance may 
be reduced. The fact that Sir W. Thomson regards the existence of 
an irreducible minimum volume as possible may, I think, be taken as 
proof that he is opposed to the \'iew that it is possible for the stress- 
strain relation to remain linear uuder such circumstances. It thus 
seems to me, on various grounds, that the inevitable conclusion is that 
while one or other of the two theories may, under ordinary circum- 
stan(,'es, be sufdcient to detine the limits of the mathematical theory, 
the result must always be checked by reference to the condition (0), 
or, what comes to the same thing, we must give up the mathematical 
theory when the strains it indicates are such as would markedly alter 
the mean molecular distance. 

I next proceed to discuss the possibility of the earth's possessing an 
elastic solid structure, deriving the necessary data from three papers 
]>ublished in the Transactions of the Gamhridge Philosophical Society. 
For brevity these will be referred to as {a)* {h),\ and (c).J 

The strains due to the action of the sun and moon being compara- 
tively insignificant, we need consider only the "centrifugal" forces due 
to the earth's diurnal rotation, and the gravitational forces due to the 
mutual attraction of its parts. 

The data supplied by geology do not enable us to formulate any likely 
theory as to a probable distribution of density and elasticity through- 
out the earth regarded as an elastic solid. All we know with certainty 
is that the surface strata are on an average considerably below the 
mean density, that they differ widely in character, many being markedly 
a'olotropic, and that frequently they are far from horizontal. Thus, 
as our object is merely to (consider what are the possibilities on the 
hypothesis of solidity, it will be best to make the hypothesis as simple 
as possible. Now, if the deviations from the earth's mean density and 
from an isotio])i«' elastic structure were limited to the surface strata, 
where alone we are certain of their existence, the effect of the "centrif- 
ugal" forces would be nearly the same as if these deviations did not 
exist; but the etVei-t of the gravitational forces on the eccentricity of 
the surface may depend largely on the nature of the deviations. I thus 
propose to treat the problem in stages. 

The first stage neglects entirely the gravitational forces and regards 
the earth as a slightly spheroi<lal body— which has departed from the 
spherical form in consequence of its rotation— of uniformjlensity and

In the case of an originally spherical solid assuming the shape of the 
earth under rotation, it is of no practical importance whether we re- 
gard a as the radius of the original spherical surface, or as the mean 
radius under rotation, nor does it matter practically whether the density 
be supposed uniform previous to or during the rotation. There is, it 
is true, for all values of ry except 0.5, a slight increase in the volume,t 
and consequent diminution in the mean density accompanying the ro- 
tation, but for our present purpose this may be neglected. 

The mathematical solution on w^hich Table i is based treats the 
spherical surface of radius a as that over which the conditions for a 
free surface are satisfied. Now, some uncertainty may exist, depending 
on the physical interpretation put upon the mathematical equations, 
whether these surface conditions should be applied over what is the 
surface before the displacement — in this case the surface of the true 
sphere wliich it is assumed the earth would form if the rotation dis- 
appeared — or over what is the surface during the rotation. This un- 
certainty might constitute a very serious difBculty if the deformations 
were supposed to be large, a contingency which may arise when the 
limitation (C) in tlie magnitude of the strains is neglected; but in such 
problems as the present where the strains are, as we shall see presently, 
of the same order of magnitude as occur in ordinary engineering struc- 
tures, it is of no material consequence. In the present case complete 
assurance on this point may be derived from Figs. 1 and 2, PI. 11 of 
(r), which show the changes induced by rotation in the equatorial and 
j)olar semi-axes of sY)heroids of various shapes.

This table will give a general idea of the limits within which E may 
reasonably be expected to lie, though some of the data refer to mate- 
rial which is hardly likely to have been isotropic. It shows that if the 
intlucnce of the gravitational forces on the eccentricity were negligi- 
ble, — which however is not the case, — the earth, though perfectly solid 
and elastic, might reasonably be expected to display not a smaller, but 
a considerably greater eccentricity than it actually does. 

The question next arises whether the strains and stresses produced 
by the rotation are such as are ccuisistent with the principles on which 
the ai)plication of the mathematical theory rests. In the actual case 
of the earth this question is of importance only in exceptional circum- 
stances, owing to the preponderating- influence of the gravitational 
forces; still it possesses sufficient interest to claim separate considera- 
tion. The following table gives a sufficiently close approximation to 
the numerical results ol)tained for the rotating- body treated above, 
when for K are substituted the values which answer to the production 
by rotation alone of an eccentricity equal to that of the earth.

138 SOME APPLICATIONS OF 

Th(3 maximuin stress-difference and the greatest strain, as given in 
the table, are both found at the center. 

The result on the stress-difference theory is nearly independent of 77, 
and is more unfavorable in every case than that given by the greatest 
strain theory to the view that the material remains perfectly elastic. 
A stress of 16 tons per square inch is not one that an engineer would 
view with complacency in any structure intended to be permanent, but 
it is a low value for the tenacity of good wrought iron. A stress of 
even 33 tons per square inch can easily be borne without rupture by 
good steel, and is perhaps not in excess of the stress under which the 
best steel remains perfectly elastic. The greatest strains are not of 
such a magnitude as to raise any presumption against the linearity of 
the stress-strain relation. Thus, according to all the tests, it is quite 
possible that an originally spherical solid of the earth's mass but 
devoid of gravitation should remain solid and elastic while assuming 
the form of the earth under rotation. Its material, however, at least 
if homogeneous and isotropic, would require to possess an unusually 
high limit of perfect elasticity. 

The next subject for consideration is how the question is affected by 
the existence of gravitational forces such as are found in the case of the 
earth. The strains and stresses in a slightly oblate spheroid, treated 
as an isotropic elastic solid, all consist of two parts, the first part being 
the same as if the surface were truly spherical, the second depending 
on the eccentricity. It is the second parts that represent the action of 
the gravitational forces in modifying the eccentricity, but these parts 
are in general insignificant so far as the question of the applicability 
of the mathematical theory is concerned. I shall therefore postpone 
consideration of them until an account has been given of the strains 
and stresses which are independent of the eccentricity. 

The mathematical diiiiculties in applying the ordinary theory to the 
case of a homogeneous solid gravitating sphere are trifling, but the 
difficulty of putting a physical interpretation upon the mathematical 
expressions answering to most values of ?/ is such as very forcibly to 
call attention to the necessity of the limitation (C). Since the gravita- 
tional force at an element of a solid sphere depends not only on the to- 
tal mass which lies nearer the center than does the element, but also on 
its absolute distance from the center, we must assume that the equations 
sui)pliedby the ordinary mathematical theory, if they apply at all, hold 
for the position of final equilibrium after the deformations have taken 
place. This seemingly requires that strain should be defined as the 
ratio of the increase of length to the final length, which is not in ac- 
cordance with the usual interpretation of Hooke's law unless the square 
of the strain be negligible. Supposing the internal equations to refer 
to the final deformed condition, the surface equations will undoubtedly 
also refer to this condition. Thus, so fiir as the terms independent of 
the eccentricity are concerned, we may suppose the mathematical theory

applied to a sphere whose density p is uiiiforni throughout, and whose 
radius a equals the earth's mean radius. 

In this case the maximum stress-difference and the algebraically 
greatest strain are both found at the surface. Let us denote these by 
S and s respectively; and let .Vo denote the greatest compression, which 
occurs at the center, and j/„ the radial displacement at the surface.

to the sphere's attraction at its surface, I find *

Longitudinal stress E 5^ in tons weight per -i

For a given value of // the value of S is independent of E. It dimin- 
ishes continually as // increases from zero. Since the value of s depends 
on E, I have given the value of Es, or the longitudinal stress which 
would produce in a bar of the material a strain equal s. The value of 
Es has a maximum of about 1,520 tons weight per square inch, for /;=

For r/=0'5 the values So and ti^ are zero supposing E finite, but for 
other values of ?/ one can obtain numerical measures of these quantities 
only by assigning numerical values to E. Now, if the earth were an 
elastic solid truly si)herical but for its rotation, the value of E answer- 
ing to !i given \alue of // would be determined from the eccentricity of

more cleaiiy presently, largely reduces the eccentricity which rotation 
would produce in a sphere of given material. Thus the eccentricity 
varying inversely as E, the value of E answering to a given eccentric- 
ity is necessarily considerably smaller when gravitational forces act 
along with the '' centrifugal " than when the latter act alone. Since the 
surface strata are very variable and of much smaller mean density than 
the earth as a whole, any calculation of the reduction of our estimates 
of E, when gravitational forces are allowed for, which treats the earth 
as of uniform density can not lay claim to great accuracy. For this 
reason, and also because I am specially desirous not to overstate the 
case against the apidicationof the mathematical theory, I have, in cal- 
culating the values of -s,, and u^ in Table iv, ascribed to E the values it 
would possess in the total absence of gravitational forces, viz., the 
values 1020 x 10^ for ?/ =0 and 1220 x 10*^ for 7/=0-2o in the same nnits as 
before. The numerical values ascribed to .So and u^ in the table are thus 
essentially minima, which would in reality have to be increased proba- 
bly to a considerable extent. 

It will be seen from the formube and from Table iv that when ?/ is 
zero or is small, the application of the mathematical theory would be 
fully justified on the greatest strain theory, while utterly condemned 
on the stress-difference theory. The principle (C) is in this case en- 
tirely in agreement with the stress-difference theory, and the applica- 
tion of the mathematical theory can in fact be supported only by those 
who reject this principle, and consider it possible for the stress-strain 
relation to remain linear though a solid sphere is reduced to one-fourth 
or less of its original volume. 

Noticing from (1) and (2) that E§/S=2?/, we see that for all values of 
a; less than 0-5 the stress-difference theory is less favorable to the view 
that the mathematical theory is applicable than the greatest- strain 
theory. If there is any truth in either theory, the earth's material 
can not possibly possess a linear stress-strain relation for values of 7j 
such as 0-25 (/. e. with a structure such as that of the metiils) unless it 
l)e of a strength compared to which that of steel is iusigniftcant. For 
such values of 7 the strains are also enormously in excess of those 
which can be admitted according to the principle (0). 

When, however, // approaches the limiting value 0*5 a complete 
change comes over the features of the case. The maximum stress 
difference and all the strains diminish, eventually vanishing when 
7]=-5. Thus none of the objections hitherto encountered can be urged 
against the application of the mathematical theory when ?/ equals or 
nearly equals 0-5. To the exact value 0-5 of 7/ there is, I admit, a physi- 
cal objecti(m, which would doubtless have been urged by Maxwell, viz, 
that, supposing Young's modulus to be finite, this implies the mate- 
rial to be absolutely incompressible. There is however no obvious

physical objection to the hypothesis that the material is very nearly 
incompressible, /. e. that 0*5 — // is very small ;* and aii isotropic sphere 
with such a structure would, according to all our tests, remain i)er- 
fectly elastic when possessed of the earth's mass and exposed to its 
gravitational forces. 

In our previous estimate of the value of E the action of the gravita- 
tioual forces in reducing the eccentricity was not taken into account. 
It the principles we have laid d<»\vu as regulating the applicability oH 
the mathematical theory be conceded, we need only consider the case 
when 0*5 — //is very snuill; and since the formulie show that in this 
case a small variation in the value of //is of little consequence, we may 
lor simplicity suppose 7/=0-5 exactly. 

In order to show the nature of the uncertainty that must in reality 
be attached to the result, it seems desirable to give a general idea of 
the May in which the existence of gravitational forces affects the eccen- 
tricity. Let us imagine, then, that over the surface of a perfect sphere 
weightless matter is piled up, which transforms the surface into that 
of a slightly oblate spheroid whose jjolar and equatorial semiaxes are 
respectively' a — 2d/S and a-\-d/3. jSTow suppose the heaped-up mate- 
rial to become heavy. The x)ressure it exerts on the surface below it 
is greatest in the equator and is zero at the poles. Thus the originally 
spherical surface will tend to sink at the equator and to rise at the 
poles; consequently the difference d between the equatorial and polar 
semiaxes of the sphroidal surface will diminish, but the diminution is 
clearly less the smaller the density of the heaped-up material. 

It must be understood that this does not profess to be a complete 
account of what actually happens; but it may suffice to show that the 
gravitational forces tend to reduce the eccentricity which the centrifu- 
gal forces tend to develop, and also that this reduction may depend 
largely on the density of the surface layers. If the departure of the 
surface layers from the earth's mean density occurs mainly near the 
equator, then the action of the gravitational forces in reducing the 
eccentricity may be much less than it would seem to be on the hyjioth- 
esis of an earth of uniform density. 

Treating the density as uniform and // as equal; 0*5, I find that, for 
a given value of E, the existence of the gravitational forces would in 
such a case as that of the «arth reduce the difference between the 
equatorial and polar diameters called for by the rotation in the ratio of 
9 : -10 a])proximately*. Thus, for a given eccentricity, the value of E 
when the gravitational forces act is to its value when the centrifugal 
forces alone exist as !) : 40, So in the supposed case of the earth, we 
should ha\e to reduce I'iiVom 141 x 10" to 32 x 10" gianis weight per square 
centim. The maximum stress-difference reduces to 7-2 tons weight per 
square inch. The greatest strain remains 0.0018, as before, but it would 
answer to a purely longitudinal stress of only S-C) tons per square inch. 

*Cf. (a) formula (21), p. 283, and (5), p. 287. 



142 SOME APPLICATIONS OF 

Owing to tlie less density of the surface strata these reductions maybe 
considerably too great, so that it is advisable to regard 32 x 10'^ as essen- 
tially a lower limit to the value of E. As stated above, the numerical 
result for the value of E would be but little altered if we supposed /; 
slightly less than 0*5; but unless 0*5=7/ be very small, the terms inde- 
pendent of the eccentricity become of importance in estimating the 
maximum stress difference and greatest strain. 

The conclusion to which the previous investigations leads is that none 
of the principles at present recognized in the biconstant theory of 
isotropy are opposed to the hypothesis that the earth possesses in its 
interior an isotropic elastic solid structure with a linear stress strain 
relation, provided its material be very nearly incompressible. But the 
hypothesis that the material in the interior shows an isotropic, elastic 
structure, such as that of the ordinary metals under the ordinary con- 
ditions, to which they are exposed on the earth's surface, can be main- 
tained only by those who are prepared to reject the usual theories of 
the rupture, the limitation (C) in the size of the strains, and the argu- 
ment introduced here from the theory of intermolecular forces. This 
raises no presumption against the hypothesis that the interior is in a 
perfectly solid state, and possessed of such a chemical constitution, 
say, as iron, if it be admitted that it is of a material in which the lin- 
earity of the stress-strain relation ceases when the compression becomes 
large. 

The results obtained raise no presumption for or against the theory 
that the earth is in a liquid or plastic state. They merely show that 
any argument against the possibility of an elastic solid structure in a 
body of the earth's /orw is without foundation; and that any argument 
based on the destructive tendency of the enormous gravitational forces 
in a solid of its mass is inconclusive, even as directed against such 
structures as are compassed by the ordinary mathematical theory. It 
has not been shown that an a^olotropic solid structure of some kind, or 
of a variety of kinds, may not satisfy all the conditions as well as or 
even better than a nearly incompressible isotropic material. The pre- 
sumption is, in fact, that the conditions may be satisfied in an infinite 
number of ways. 

It must be borne in mind that there may be fatal objections to an 
elastic solid structure which do not arise immediately from the theory 
of elasticity. Such an objection may arise from the rapid increase with 
the depth shown by the temperature near the earth's surface. My 
principal reason for referring to this is to point out that the common 
argument against the production of fluidity by the high internal tem- 
perature (viz, an assumed raising of the melting point by pressure) has 
just as much weight for a nearly incompressible solid earth as for any 
other, because while the stress difference in such an earth is small the 
internal pressures are very large. 

Before passing to the second part of the paper, I have to confess that 



PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TO GEOLOGY. 143 

there is uo reason to believe that some of the limitatious assigned here 
to the apphcatiou ol" the luatliematical theory will be accepted by all 
or even by a majority of the elasticians. In fact, the mathematical 
theory has actually been applied by several recent writers under cir- 
cumstances when most or all of the limitations proposed here are vio- 
lated. For instance, this is to a certain extent the case in Prof. Dar- 
win's paper* "On the stresses caused in the interior of the earth by 
the weight of continents and mountains." In the principal part of the 
paper he sup])oses //=0.r), when, as we have seen, none of the objections 
ai)ply; but in his § 10, in order "to know how far the results - - - 
may differ, if the elastic solid be compressible," he supposes that while 
the rigidity constant is finite the bulk modulus is very small. In other 
words, he applies mathematical formula which assume r} as nearly equal 
to — 1. Sucli a value has been here regarded as impossible. It should 
also be noticed that if ;/ were equal — 1 then E would vanish, and if 
V be nearly — 1 the value of E must be very small. Thus the strains and 
displacements given by equations 2 to 4 would, in the case supposed 
by Prof. Darwin, be enormously greater than even those given in Table 
IV. I do not observe, however, that either in the i)aper itself or in 
one supplemeutaryt to it Prof. Darwin makes any exx)licit reference to 
the terms in the strain independent of the angular co-ordinates, from 
which the e([uations 1 to 4 are derived. I am thus unable to say 
whether his neglect of the limitations that these terms are here regarded 
as setting to the application of the mathematical theory is intentional 
or not. Again, in a recent pai)er| "On Sir William Thomson's esti- 
mate of tlie rigidity of the earth," Mr. Love has also considered the prob- 
lem of the earth treated as an isotropic elastic sphere, more especially for 
the value of 0.2.5 of //. In his equations 14 and 18 Mr. Love determines 
the values of two arbitrary constants which occur in the terms inde- 
l)endent of the angular co-ordinates, and it is easily seen that the ex- 
pression he would thence obtain for these terms is identical with mine.§ 
After determining the second constant he however dismisses the sub- 
ject with the remark, "This - - - gives the mean radial displace- 
ment, a matter which need not detain us here." So far as I can see, 
IVIr. Love makes no reference to any principle such as C, nor to the 
]t<)ssibi]ity of the stress-strain relation ceasing to be linear. 

1 ought also to explain that in my paper (rt), directing my attention 
solely to the theories of rupture, I left out of sight any such limitation 
as (]>) or (C), and treated the case of an earth in which ?/=0 as one in 
which, according to the greatest-strain theory of rupture, the mathe- 
matical theory was applicable. I also failed to notice that the case 
?/=0.5 was sanctioned by the greatest- strain theory as well as by the 
stress-difference theory.

144 SOME APPLICATIONS OF 

II, — SOME GEOLOGICAL THEORIES. 

The belief that the jn-esent spheroidal form of the earth necessar- 
ily betokens a previous liquid, or at least, plastic, condition seems 
among geologists almost as universal as the belief that the earth but 
for the development of rotation must have been a spherical body. 
Whether this latter conclusion has any satisfactory basis a})art from 
philosophical speculations it is not my present object to inquire. But 
supposing, for the sake of argument, that the natural form of the earth 
as undisturbed by rotation is spherical, the conclusion that it ever was 
in a liquid or even in a plastic state throughout is, according to the 
preceding results, not established by its present spheroidal form. Yet 
even in such a standard work as Geikie's Textbook of Geology, after 
reading the discussion on p. 12 and the foot-note attached, I fail to de- 
tect a trace of the idea that the polar flattening might be called forth 
by rotation in a truly solid body. 

Various geological writers, it is true, speak of a solid earth as capa- 
ble of changing its form, but they seem in reality to regard the change 
as due to rupture or to the development of a plastic condition. This 
appears, for instance, to be the view actually held by Mr. Herbert 
Spencer in a short j)apei * entitled "The Form of the Earth no j)roof of 
Original Fluidity." This paper has been referred to with a somewhat 
inaccurate conception of its value and results by two recent geological 
writers, so it claims some notice at our hands. The first of the two 
writers referred to, Mr. W. B. Taylor,t says : " It is now nearly forty 
years since Herbert Spencer, with a juster physical insight [than Sir 
W. Thomson and Prof. Tait], contended and satisfactorily showed that 
a solid earth (of any shape) would assume the oblate spheroidal form 
due to its rate of rotation, as certainly and j)romptly as if it were 
liquid." The other writer, Mr. A. Blytt,t amongst other references to 
the paper says, " I believe that Spencer is the first who expressed the 
opinion that even a solid earth can change its form." 

Mr. Spencer, after some statements as to the relative strength and 
agility of large and small animals, such as elephants and fleas, formu- 
lates the general result that the strength — called also " resistance to 
fracture " — of a solid structure varies as the square of its linear dimen- 
sions, while the " agencies antagonistic to cohesive attraction," i. e., 
gravitational and " centrifugal " forces, etc., vary as the cube. Except- 
ing a statement that this is obviously true of simple longitudinal and 
torsional stress, the following is the sole proof of his very general law 
supplied by Mr. Spencer: "The strength of a bar of iron, timber, or 
other material subjected to the transversfe strain varies as BD^/L; B

being the breadth, D the deptli, and L the length. Suppose the size 
of this bar to be changed, whilst the ratios of its dimensions continue 
the same; then - - - the strength will vary as D^ - - - " (p. 195). 
Tlie following is the (^oncdnsion drawn by Mr. Spencer: " Viewed by 
the light of this principle, the fact that the earth is an oblate spheroid 
does not seem to afford any support to the hy^iothesis of original fluid- 
ity as commonly understood. We must consider that in respect of 
its obedience to the geo-dynamic laws, the earth is fluid now and must 
jihvays remain so; for the most tenacious substance with which we are 
ac(juainted, Avheu subjected to the same forces that are acting upon the 
earth's crust, would exceed the limit of self-support determined by the 
above law, before it attained TroTfo-.^iroToo-o of the earth's bulk" (p.l96). 

Perlmps if one knew what Mr. Spencer means by '^ the limit of self 
support," and what is the exact distinction he draws between " fluidity 
as commonly understood " and " fluidity in respect of obedience to geo- 
dynamic laws," one might be in a position to form some estimate of his 
degree of physical insight; but so far as I can see all he satisfactorily 
shows is an extraordinary agility in jumping to conclusions. If his 
meaning is that deformation must accompany the action of gravita- 
tional and centrifugal forces, he might, if Maxwell's view be correct, 
have added to the denominator of his estimate as many O's as the 
printer could spare; but if it is the rupture of an elastic solid or its 
transformation into a plastic state to which he refers, as seems almost 
certain from the context, he must have formed an extremely low esti- 
mate of Avhat strains a solid can stand. 

In the same passage Mr. Blytt refers to Mr. Peirce,* Sir J. W, Daw- 
son, f and Prof. J. E. Todd | as holding that a solid earth will alter its 
shai)e if the rate of rotation vary. The views of Mr. Peirce I have not 
seen, but the other two writers mentione ' regard the solid earth itself 
as clianging shape only by means of a succession of what we may term 
catastrophies. Their views seem identical with those which Mr. Blytt's 
translator ascribes to him in the following words: "The sea adjusts 
itself in accordance with the smallest change in the length of the day 
But the solid earth otters resistance to change of form, and 
begins to give way only when the tension reaches a certain amount " (p. 
41S). Mr. Blytt makes several distinct references to the subject, and 
his remarks are not perhaps always strictly consistent. This, however, 
is hardly to be wondered at, since he gives as the result of his investiga- 
tions: ''As has been stated, there prevails - - - a disagreement as 
to how far the earth will change its form, in case the centrifugal force 
varies. Thomson is most inclined to believe that it will not. ])arwin 
is of opinion that it will. And among other physicists whom I have 
consulted a similar divergence prevails upon this point. One thinks

that a lengtlieuin^- of the day even by several hours will be incapable 
of altering- the form of the solid earth; another believes that the solid 
earth will probably change its form just as easily as the sea" (p. 421). 

If Mr. Blytt should ever have further occasion to consult physicists 
on this or any allied point, he would find an exact definition of such 
terms as solid a certain amount of protection from (t j/HoH speculations. 
Mr. Blytt's own principal view seems due in part to an erroneous inter- 
pretation of Tresca's experiments on the flow of metals under pressure. 
They do not in reality justify his statement " By reason of the enor- 
mous pressure which pre^'ails in the interior of the earth, it must be 
supposed that masses from a certain depth are more or less in a plastic 
state " (p. 417). It was in fact pointed out some years ago by the Rev. 
Osmond Fisher * tliat the existence of an orifice from which the metal 
can flow constitutes a complete diflerence between the conditions of 
Tresca's experiments and the state of a body subjected to nearly uni- 
form pressure all round. 

Mr. Blytt apparently does not stand alone in believing Sir W.Thom- 
son to hold that the solid earth is incapable of altering its form as the 
rotation alters, and that it possesses the same eccentricity as wlien it 
solidified. Prof. Darwin in Nature, 188G, vol. xxxiv, pp. 420-423, seems 
also to put this interpretation upon a passage lie quotes from § 830 of 
Thomson and Tait's ^'■Natural Philosojjhi/.^^ Supposing this interpre- 
tation correct. Prof. Darwin's opinion that Sir AV. Thomson does not 
allow " a sutficient margin for uncertainties" expresses only a part of 
the objections I should entertain. I find it difficult however to believe 
that Sir W. Thompson, who elsewhere gives data for the eccentricity 
produced by rotation in solid spheres of steel, can actually suppose no 
change at all in the eccentricity to follow an alteration in the angular 
velocity. Still it must be confessed that though the passage contains 
the statenuMit, " It must necessarily remain uncertain whether the earth 
would fiom time to time adjust itself completely to a figure of equi- 
librium adapted to the rotation," its most natural interpretation is that 
given by Prof. Darwin. I need hardly say that the conclusion that 
the earth, however solid, would retain a constant eccentricity while the 
rate of rotation varied, seems to me directly opposed to the conclusions 
to which the elastic solid theory leads. 

Prof. Darwin himself, in his paper in Nature refers to Tresca's ex- 
periments and thinks it probable there would be from time to time a flow 
of material as the angular velocity altered. One of the " uncertain- 
ties" he refers to is the possibility that, iu accordance with Dr. Croll'st 
views, a greater rapidity of denudation in equatorial than in polar 
regions may have reduced the eccentricity markedly below the value it 
possessed when the earth solidified. He does not seem however to

refer to the (considerable cliauge of eccentricity tliat might occur in a 
solid through mere variation of elastic strain. 

As regards the present state of the earth's interior there are, accord- 
ing to Geikie's Text-book, p. 49, only three theories which merit serious 
consideration, vi/ : 

(1) That there is a solid crust and a molten interior. 

(2) That Avith the exception of local vesicular spaces the earth is per- 
fectly solid. 

(3) That the earth consists of a solid crust an<l nucleus with an in- 
tervening liquid layer. 

According to the Text-book, the theoiy of a thin crust containing 
li(iui(l or viscous matter is exposed to " weighty and indeed insuper- 
able objections,'' ]). 18, and " is now abandoned by most geologists," p. 
43. 

According to Dr. Croll * the "general opinion among geoh)gists " is 
that tlie earth " consists of a fluid interior surrounded by a thick and 
rigid [really solid] crust.'' 

Prof. Prestwich t belie\es that "the crust rests on a yielding sub- 
stratum, and that of no great thickness." In fact he advocates the 
third of the above-mentioned theories, and believes 30 miles to be 
probably in excess of the crust's thickness. Most writers on the sub- 
ject appear to ha\e subsidiary theories of their own. 

Whether the assurance that the question is beyond the reach of ex- 
periment accounts for the multitude of theories and the confidence 
with which tliey are i)roi)osed, is a (|uestion tor philosophers notmathe- 
nuiticians to consider, but it seems rtj»-ior/ a possible exjdanation of 
such a declaration of faith as that of Mr. W. B. Taylor: | " The liquid- 
ity of our globe, and the relative thinness of its encrusted envelope — 
as attested by all legitimate (jeol<></ical induction — will be assumed 
witluuit misgiving or hesitancy, aud the supposed matematical argu- 
ments for its solidity ignored as essentially fallacious and wholly in- 
conclusive." 

Of course if the geological evidence Avere conclusive, it Avould be 
mere waste of time further to consider the matter, but the evidence 
that satisfies i\Ir. Taylor does not seem to carry conviction to all geolo- 
gists even in America. ^Ir. G. Becker,§ for instance, who appears to 
liave same practical experience, says: " For a considerable number of 
years 1 have constantly had the theory of the earth's solidity in mind 
while making tield observations on upheaval aud subsidence, with the 
result that to my thinking, the phenomena are capable of nnich more 
satisfactory exi)lauation on a solid globe than on an encrusted fluid 
one."

148 SOME APPLICATIONS OF 

It may thus be not wholly improfitable to glance briefly at some of 
the arguments which some of the advocates of the several theories 
base on their ideas of the properties of solid bodies. 

Mr. Taylor's object is to get an equatorial circumference some 10 per 
cent in excess of its present value, so as to account for the lateral com- 
pression at the surface observed in mountain chains. Thus, following 
Prof. Darwin,* he supposes the earth to have once possessed a much 
greater angular velocity than at present, and speaks of a '^ consistent 
crust (of some few miles thickness) " as having formed " when the rota- 
tion of our planet was at four times its present rate " (/. c, p. 257). The 
equatorial radius would then have been, he says, some 4,359 miles, and 
the polar some 3,291. The change of shape, as the rotation f<dl off, 
would account, he thinks, for observed phenomena. He considers his 
conclusions opposed by Sir W. Thomson's theory that the earth solidi- 
fied throughout and retains at least approximately its original eccen- 
tricity. It is on this point that he refers to the data su])plied by Mr. 
Herbert Spencer's "jnster physical insight;" and he adds, apparently 
as his own contribution to the argument, '' the supposition that a granite 
mountain or equatorial protuberance 400 miles high or 100 miles high 
could for a moment support itself, would hardly be entertained by a 
practical engineer;" and in a foot-note, " the limiting modulus of height 
of a granite pyramid (equalling one side of its square base) is somewhat 
less than 11 miles" (/, c, p. 258). I am quite ready to agree with Mr. 
Taylor that if solidification occurred under the conditions he supposes 
the eccentricity must have altered enormously and that in a non-elastic 
way, and I liardly suppose that Sir W. Thompson would oppose this 
view. No one however so far as I know, has propounded the theory 
of an elastic solid spheroidal earth of eccentricity 0.65 rotating com- 
pletely in six hours, so that the investigation of the strains and stresses 
required by such a theory is unnecessary. I can quite imagine that on 
any probable theory of density the magnitude of the strains is hardly 
likely to be consistent with the application of the mathematical theory 
of elasticity. Tlie force of Mr. Taylor's remarks as to the pyramid I, 
however, fail to see. Such an isolated mass exists under totally differ- 
ent conditions from any portion of a solid sphere or spheroid, and one 
might as well argue as to the impossibility of a liquid interior from the 
fact that an isolated liquid column 100 miles high has not yet been 
observed on the earth's surface. If Mr. Taylor were however to cal- 
culate the strains and stresses in such a^ thin shell as he supposes, of 
material showing anything resembling the structure of ordinary rock, 
with a rate of rotation such as he mentions, I very much doubt whether 
he would find it in an essentially better position than his imaginary 
pyramid. 

After this criticism Mr. Taylor considers the question of the probable 
degree of rigidity of our planet quite irrelevant, but the "temptation is

PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TO GEOLOGY. 149 

strong- to waste upon it a collateral glance" [1. c, p. 259). Accordingly 
he crushes Sir W. Thomson's argument* from the tides by the remark, 
"that a siliceous crust of liO miles average thickness and an overlying 
aqueous ocean of 3 miles average depth, should have (as required by 
the argument) so equal a coefficient of mobility that sea and land could 
thus together 'rise and fiill,' might well be pronounced incredible" 
(/. c, p. 200). 

Tie regards Sir W. Tliomsou as very seriously damaging- his own ar- 
gument by tlie admission that tides comparable in magnitude witli those 
()l)served would occur even in a solid eartli of steel. It does not seem 
to have occurred to him that the existence of a difference between the 
motionsof the laiul and water may constitute an argument for solidity, t 

Mr. Taylor admits one difficulty in his theory, viz, the nature and 
local characteristics of the x)lications actually observed, and remarks: 
"While the force at the command of the rotating planet is abundantly 
sufficient - - - evidently some supplementary considerations are 
requisite to give the observed direction to this force," - - - "The 
mere mechanical difficulty however of transmitting stresses through 
comparatively undisturbed areas of hundreds of miles of a flexible, fri- 
able, and practically plastic crust — with a large coefficient of viscous 
friction beneath — is not so formidable as might at first appear. It 
nuist be borne in mind that the pressures derived from an action so 
slow as from century to century to be scarcely sensible, are of an or- 
der of very great intensity, but of very small quantity" (/. c, p. 265). 
Mr. Taylor also infers from " various considerations " that " in all ages 
mountain building has been at a maximum; that is, the uplifted heights 
have been the greatest which the average thickness of the crust at the 
time was capable of supporting; so that the former has been a constant 
function of the latter, the ratio being probably not far from one-fifth" 
(/. c, p. 205). Mr. Taylor does not state that this law of the uplifted 
heights is true of all lands as well as of all time, but the possibility that 
such may be the case is rather alarming. He enters in fact into no un- 
necessary details as to how he reached his conclusions, so that all one 
can say is that, measured by his own standard, he is certainly not in- 
ferior in physical insight even to Mr. Herbert Spencer. Perhaps when 
he comes to deal witli the " supplementary considerations" he may sup- 
ply sufficient data for the mathematician to follow him. 

Prof. Prestwich, in his Greology, vol. ii, regards the " present very 
greiit rigidity of the earth" as being i^roved by niathematical and 
])hysical investigations; but complains of a "want of elasticity" in 
the methods of the mathematicians (p. 538). According to him, " the 
hypothesis most compatible with the geological phenomena is that of a 
central solid nucleus with a molten yielding envelope — not fluid, but 
viscid or plastic; nor is it necessary that this magma should be of any

150 SOME APPLICATIONS OF 

great tliickiiess; but a thin crust is, it seems to me, au essential condi- 
tion" (p. 54:o). Prof. Prestwicli adduces in support of Ms views various 
arguments from geological phenomena Avhich seem of much weight. He 
has also various arguments of a more or less i)hysical character, but 
they seem to take a good deal for granted. Thus, on p. 540, refer- 
ring to plications in the surface rocks, he says, " if the earth were solid 
throughout, the tangential pressure would result not in distorting or 
crumpling, but in crushing and breaking. As a rule, no such results 

are to be seen, and the strata have yielded, as only a free surface 

plate could, to the deformation caused by lateral x)ressure - - - a yield- 
ing bed, on which the crust could move as a separate body, was neces- 
sary." It seems to me that as the phenomena of mixture are as yet 
very imperfectly ascertained, except perhaps for a few simple standard 
conditions. Prof. Prestwich has very little to go on but a priori ideas. 
I fail to see, for instance, why pressures at or near the surface of a solid 
sphere should necessarily produce fracture and not flow. Also it seems 
improbable that there would be a sharp line of demarcation so as to 
enable a crust — which seems clearly to mean a solid superficial layer — 
to move as a separate body on a '^ yielding bed." Would not this im- 
X)ly a liquid substratum with no appreciable viscosity ? And supposing 
there were a substratum of this kind, is there any sufficient exiDcri- 
mental evidence that a solid crust of even a few miles thickness would, 
on the falling away of the liquid underneath, go into folds instead of 
being crushed and broken? Further, can plications to the extent 
shown, say by the Alps, be reconciled with the retention of contempo- 
raneous solidity? Sui^posing the earth to be essentially solid through- 
out, is there any reason why the strain at some miles below the surface 
should not locally at intervals exceed the elastic limit, with the result 
for a time of a state of flow or plasticity throughout a volume of greater 
or less extent? During such an epoch there would exist locally condi- 
tions somewhat resembling those which Prof. Prestwich believes exist- 
ent everywhere. It is true tliat one argument adduced by Prof. Prest- 
wich and others against the existence of sei)arate reservoirs of molten 
material, viz, the similarity in the character of volcanic products all 
over the earth, applies equally against such au hypothesis. If how- 
ever volcanic products be supposed to come from several miles below 
the surface, I see no obvious reason why they should not i^resent sim- 
ilar characteristics everywhere. No conclusive argument can well be 
based on the differences observed in the sedimentary strata, because 
the conditions under which such strata are deposited are obviously of 
a varied character. 

In various passages of Prof. Prestwich's discussion of the state of the 
earth one is apt to be puzzled by his falling into the practice, by no 
means uncommon in geological writings, of employing physical terras 
with a view to oratory rather than to expositicm. For instance, he 
speaks of contraction "due to the yielding of the weaker lines in the

crust, when the- tension eaiised by the excessive strain (and of which 
the lirst order of movement is an index) overcomes the resistance, and 
fractures and doubles up the strata;" and he adds: " Mountain ranges 
are in fact the concluding term of the stress which caused the deforma- 
tion of the crust, and the movements which at those times took place 
nuist have been influenced by the greater energy of the strains then at 
work" (p. 54(1). It is difficult to see here what is intended to be cause 
an<l what elfect. In fact, while a number of terms are employed which 
in mathematics and physics have a fairly definite meaning, I must con- 
fess my inability to form an adequate conception of what is meant by 
the passage as a whole. 

Prof. Prestwich refers (pp. 543, 544) to the hypothesis of the late 
Prof. E. lioclie (in tlie reference to which a misprint gives the year 1801 
for 1881) as supplying something of the kind of earth he wants. Thus 
an examination of Prof lioche's work* may be of some service. 

He supposes the eartii to consist of a central nucleus or " bloc," 
homogeneous but for a possible accumulation of matter of greater 
density at the center, and of a superficial layer of lighter material. Of 
the nuclens, with the possible exception of a small core of heavier mat- 
ter, he says, " Sa density calcuK^e, de 7 a 7-5, indique qu'elle est me- 
tallique, sans doute forniee de fcr - - -" The specific gravity of the 
heavier matter which may possibly exist at the center is, he says, "cer- 
tainement bien inferienr [to 18j,probablement lOou 12 (argent, plomb)," 
p. 235. The outer layer or crust he sui)i)oses to have a specific gravity 
about 3, and a thickness of about one-sixth the earth's radius. Be- 
tween the crust and the nucleus there exists, it may be everywhere or 
only locally, molten matter such as appears at the surface in volcanic 
outbursts, but the total volume occupied by this must be small. Prof. 
Roche takes three results as given, viz, the earth's total mass, the eccen- 
tricity of its surface, and the ratio of the principal moments of inertia, 
the last quantity being deduced from astronomical data. He satisfies 
all the conditions he recognizes by the aid of the folloAving hypothesis 
regarding his nucleus: '^ Ce bloc a pris sa forme definitive sous I'infiu- 
ence d'une rotati<m moins rapide qu'elle n'(^stanjourd'hui, et il a con- 
serve raplatissement correspondant, malgre les accroissements snc- 
cessifs de vitesse du systeme resultants de sa contraction progressive " 
(p. 232). In other words, he assumes the nucleus to have solidified 
before the crust and that it retains its shape unaltered. Thus as he 
regards the angular A'elocity as increasing in consequence of the dimi- 
nution in the moment of inertia through contraction in cooling, the nu- 
cleus possesses a smaller eccentricity than the crust. He supposes 
only a small dilference in the length of the day at the dates of the two 
solidifications, so that the difference between the eccentricities of the 
nucleus and crust is also small. This however in no way justifies his

dixieme, pp. 221-264. 



152 SOME APPLICATIONS OF 

hypothesis that the uuclens retains its form unaltered. If its material 
possessed the properties of an elastic solid the eccentricity would cer- 
taiidy alter, and to an extent probably quite comparable with the alter- 
ation that would have occurred if it had remained fluid. Prof. Roche 
seems in fact to treat his nucleus as possessed of the properties of the 
wholly imaginary perfectly rigid body. He certainly introduces no 
equations such as ought to hold over the surface of an elastic solid 
spheroid. The exact view he adopted as to the properties of solids it is, 
however, difficult to decide. On his page 241 a brief statement would 
imply that he did not regard each elementary layer of a solid sphere 
as of necessity totally self-supporting; but on pages 223, 224, where 
the discussion is fuller, he says, "Si Fon rejette la complete tluidite de 
la terre, il n'est plus possible d'attribuer a la compressibilite de ses 
couches la meme influence." . . - " Dans un solide, les tensions 
laterales sont variables et acquierent parfois une valeur enorme. C'est 
ainsi qu'une couche pourrait se souteuir d'elle meme comme une espece 
de voilte, sans peser sur celle qui est au-dessous." A solid layer sup- 
porting itself like an arch under the conditions of matter near the 
earth's surface treated as an elastic solid, presents strains far in excess 
of those which are regarded here as coming within the range of the 
mathematical theory. 

On various grounds it seems to me that the criticism of a want of 
elasticity, though hardly in the sense intended by Prof. Prestwich, may 
be strongly urged against Eoche's investigations. 

Some remarks of M. Roche's, on his images 240, 241, throw considera- 
ble light on his standpoint and that of many other theorists: "Les as- 
tronomes qui persistent a admettre la fluidite - - - cherchent a 
eluder les objections de Hopkins et de Thomson, en attribuant - - - 
an liquide central une viscosite assez grande pour que - - - I'ensem- 
ble en arrive a tourner tout d'une piece - - - La masse tournante 
offreune telle rigidite qu'elle est assimilable sous ce rapport a un bloc 
solidifi^, mais admettre cette assimilation revient a depouiller le milieu 
interne des proprietes ordinaires des liquides, et a lui en conserver le 
nom tout en I'identitiant a un corps solide." He proceeds to point out 
that the mere question of a name is of no account, considering our 
ignorance of what would be the properties of matter under such pres- 
sures and at such a temperature as the theory of fluidity would lead 
to. His line of argument is not very clear, but there is no hesitation 
apparent in his conclusion: "Eneffet, la pression supportee par les 
couches centrales, dans la supposition d'une complete fluidite, depas- 
serait deux millions et demi d'atmospheres. La grandeur meme de ce 
nombre est a elle seule une objection peremptoire a I'hypothese qui y 
conduit. 

Such a position as this may be all very well for a philosopher who 
supposes the external world a mere idea, the private property of his 
own mind and so necessarily obedient to laws which his understanding 



PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TO GEOLOGY. 153 

can fully grasp, or for a scientist who believes the earth created for the 
special purpose of supplying problems of precisely that amount of diflti- 
culty which he personally is able to solve, but from a common-sense 
point of view it seems ntterly irrational. No physicist or geologist has 
any reason to suppose that there are not numeious problems whose full 
compreliension requires more extensive knowledge than is jiossessedby 
himself or any of his contemporaries. 

The necessity for theories has been eloquently urged by Prof. Dar- 
win,* who says: '' A theory is, then, a necessity for the advance of sci- 
ence, and we may regard it as the branch of a living tree, of which 
facts are the nourishment." Employing this simile, I must confess that 
the subject treated in tliis i)aper resembles, in my opinion, a tree which 
combines a sad deficiency of sap with a great superfluity of branches. 
It will I dare say be generally admitted that the premature craving- 
after a finality of knowledge has been responsible fi)r numerous fruit- 
less speculations in the past, and it seems only too probable that the 
impatience of the mind with its own ignorance is the principal founda- 
tion of much of the theory of to-day. The satisfaction derived from the 
contemplation of sim^de and comprehensive laws may suffice perhaps 
to prove that the powers of the mind are limited, but hardly that the 
l)rocesses of nature are simple.

ORIGI]S^ OF THE ROOK PRESSURE OF NATURAL GAS IN 
THE TRENTON LIMESTONE OF OHIO AND INDIANA.* 



By Edward Orton. 



THE IMPORT AN("K OF THE PRODUCT. 

Natural gas derived from the Trenton limestone lias supplied during 
the last year and is now supi)lying- all the fuel and a considerable part 
of the artificial light that is used by at least four hundred thousand 
people in northwestern Ohio and in central In<liaua. Within the same 
limits it is the basis of a varied line of manufactures, the annual prod- 
uct of which will make an aggregate of many millions of dollars. More 
than forty glass furnaces, not one of them three years old, are now in 
very successful operation within the territory named, while iron and 
steel mills, ]>otteries, and bri(;k works, and a long list of Victories in 
which cheap power is a desideratum, have been built up on all sides 
with wonderful rapidity. 

The largest gas production of the Trenton limestone that has yet 
been reached is to be credited to the present year. A well, drilled early 
last summer at Stuartsville, G miles north of Findlay, produced through 
the casing, a pipe '>•• inches in diameter, 28,000,000 cubic feet of gas 
every twenty-tour hours. Theie are but few wells in any held that ex- 
ceed these figures. Most of the wells so reported have been estimated, 
not measured. 

An cipially astonishing advance has been made in the oil production 
of this rock within lour counties of northwestern Ohio. Single Avells 
diillcd during the last year have begun their production at a rate of 
10,000 barrels per dny, and more than 200,000 barrels of total produc- 
tion are already to be credited to single wells of the new field, while 
a considerable number have passed the 100,000-barrel mark. 

THE ROCK PRESSURE. 

The rock pressure of the gas is a vital factor in all this production. 
To its energy is due the propulsion of the volatile fuel from the wells 
where it is released, through 20, 30, 50 miles of buried pipes, to the 

*Kea(l l)eforc the (Geological Society of America, December 26, 1889. (From the

156 ORIGIN OF ROCK PRESSURE OF NATURAL GAS. 

cities which it sui)plies with the unspeakable advantages of gaseous 
fuel. It is the same cause that lifts the oil from the rock in all flowing 
wells. 

By rock ijressure is meant the pressure which a gauge sliows in a 
well that is locked in after the drill has reached th(> gas reservoir. Tlie 
iron tubing of the well becomes by this means a part of the reservoir, 
and the same conditions as to pressure are supposed to pertain to it 
that are found in the porous rock below. 

The rock pressure of gas varies greatly in diiferent fields and to a 
less, but still an important, extent in different portions of the same 
field. The highest rock j)ressure recorded in the Trenton limestone is 
about GoO pounds to the square inch, while there are considerable por- 
tions of the gas territory that never reach 300 ])ouiids pressure per 
square inch. The original pressure in the Findlay field was 450 pounds, 
varying somewhat in wells of different depths. In the Wood County 
field, from which the largest amount of gas is now being conveyed to 
Ohio cities, the original pressure ranged from 420 to 480 pounds, the 
general pressure being counted 460 pounds to the square inch. There 
were occasional records made of still higher pressure in single wells, 
but of such cases the number is very small, and the existence of these 
anomalous pressures was short lived. 

Passing to the westward, the gas wells of Auglaize and Mercer coun- 
ties show a decided reduction in original rock pressure as compared 
with Findlay, though the depths of the Avells remain the same as in that 
field. The highest pressure recorded in Mercer County is 300 pounds 
to the square inch, but no gauge was applied to the wells until tbey. 
had been allowed to discharge without restraint for several months, 
while 375 and 350 pounds mark the extreme limit of other portions of 
this district. 

In the Indiana field a still further reduction of rock pressure is to be 
noted. The range of the principal Indiana wells is between 250 and 325 
pounds to the square inch. The Indiana gas wells, as compared with 
Ohio gas wells, are marked by a reduction in total depth, as well as in 
rock pressure, the figures for depth in the productive territory seldom 
or never passing 1,000 feet. 

How can tlu;se variations be accounted for? Back of this question 
is a larger one, viz : What is the origin of the rock pressure of natural 
gas? 

THEORIES OF ORIGIN OP ROCK PRESSURE. 

Considering its importance, tlie main question has received less con- 
sideration than would naturally be expected. The known literature of 
the subject is very meager. Prof. J. P. Lesley, in the Annual Re.port 
of the Pennsylvania Survey for 1885, discussed the question at greater 
length than any other geologist, so far as I know. In a paper pub- 



ORIGIN OF ROCK PRESSURE OF NATURAL GAS. 157 

lisbed in the American Manufacturer, May 27, 1887, 1 threw out a few 
suggestions as to the (;ause of rock pressure, and these suggestions I 
afterwards expanded into a more extended statement, in the sixth vol- 
ume of the Geology of Ohio, p. 96. Prof. I. 0. White reminds me that 
he suggested an exphmation in the jouriuil named above at an earlier 
date than either of those given. 

The men who are engaged in the practical development of gas and 
oil fields make great account of rock pressure. It is the first fact that 
tliey iiMpiire after in a new gas field. Tliey appieciate its importance 
in whatever utilization of the gas they may propose, knowing that the 
distance of the markets that they can reacli and the size of the pipes 
that they can employ are entirely dependent upon this element. These 
l>ra('tical men, so called, are as is well known, among the most ven- 
turesome of theorists, and a question like this would not be likely to 
be left unanswered by them. A certain rough correspondence that 
exists between the depth and the rocli pressure of wells is made of great 
account in explanations that they offer. In other words, the pressure 
is sui)i)0sed to be due to the weight of the overlying rocks; and next 
to tliis we find among tliem the expansive force of gas the favorite ex- 
planation of the phenomenon. 

In the paper of Proi'. Lesley, already referred to, the learned author 
suggests the two possible explanations of rock pressure already named, 
anil to this he adds a third, viz, hydraulic pressure; but he adds this 
exi)lanation only to reject it as a true cause of the phenomenon under 
discussion. The absurdity of tlie more commonly received explanation 
of rock pressure, as due to Uie depth of the well — in other words to the 
weight of the overlying country — he sets in such clear light in his dis- 
cussion that no further consideration of this is required on the part of 
those who are open to reason. Until we can prove, or at least render it 
})robable, that the gas rocks have lost their cohesion and that they exist 
at the depths of storage in a crushed or comminuted state, no explana- 
tion can be based up<m tlu^ weight of the overlying rock in account- 
ing for the force Avith wliich the gas escapes from its reservoirs wiien 
they are penetrated by the drill. Prof. Lesley throws the whole weight 
of liis authority in favor of the view that the gas "produces its own 
pressure Hke gas generated by cliemical reaction in a closed vessel." 
Tliis explanation certainly leaves something to be desired, for it fails to 
account for the most significant and important facts in this connection, 
viz, the <lifference ol" rock pressure in different localities and at differ- 
ent depths. To accept it, brings us no advantage whatever beyond the 
satisfaction tliat we may feel in having an answer at hand that can be 
promptly given to a troublesome inquiry. 

For my own i)art, I have f(;lt certain for more than two years that the 
rock pressure of gas in the Trenton limestone of Ohio and Indiana is 
hydrostatic in origin, and I have ])ublished a mimber of facts that 
seem to me to give support to this view. I find that some sagacious 



158 ORIGIN OF ROCK PRESSURE OF NATURAL GAS. 

operators in the new gas and oil fields are coming to tlie same ground. 
They have become thoroughly .satisfied by their own experiences that 
the root of rock pressure is to be found in the water column that stands 
connected with the porous rock iu which the gas and oil are contained. 
In the present paper I desire to present to the Geological Society 
a few facts and conclusions bearing upon the subject. 

THE DATA FOR THE HYUROSTATIG THEORY. 

The first question is, What are tlie facts as to the rock pressures of 
the gas rock in question and what relations do they bear to the depth 
of wells and other conditions in the Trenton limestone? The answer 
is not as full and definite as may be exj^ected, certainly not as may be 
desired. There is but one datum in the development of a gas field in 
which the normal gas pressure can be ascertained, and that is when 
the first well reaches the reservoir and releases the long-imprisoned 
and greatly comj)ressed gas. But often this favorable opportunity is 
lost, and gauges are not applied to wells until the energy of the first 
flow is somewhat abated. Again, different wells iu the same field, as 
Findlay, for example, give different results. The wells vary Avith the 
dei)th at which the gas rock is found. This factor is found to be an 
essential one, as will presently be shown, in connection with rock pres- 
sure. Moreover, gauges are sometimes inaccurate and their errors 
come in to confuse the study of the subject. Furthermore, the exact 
dei)th of the wells and the exact altitude of the surface where they are 
located can not be as(;ertained in all cases. Small errors of tliis sort 
must be provided for, and there also enters into the discussion a ques- 
tion as to the specific gravity of the water which is to be made the mov- 
ing force of gas and oil. The water found in association with these 
substances is never fresh. It is always saline and often highly miner- 
alized. The weight of fresh water to the square inch is 0.43285 pound 
for 1 foot in height (I use Professor Lesley's tables). The average 
weight of sea Avater is 0.445 pound to the square inch for 1 foot; but 
the mineral waters with which we find the Trenton limestone saturated 
often reach a nuich higher figure. An examination of several speci- 
mens shows that a column 1 foot high Avould weigh to the square inch 
0.47H pound. In fact, some of these waters are more like bitterns, and 
their columns would equal or exceed 0.5 pound per foot. 

Bearing tliese several sources of ambiguity or uncertainty in mind, we 
can consider the records of pressure, depth, and the other factors that 
are accessible. The figures as to pressure have already been summa- 
rized in a preceding paragraph, but they Avill be repeated in an accom- 
panying tabular statement. Before coming to this, however, let me in 
the briefest terms review the conditions under which gas, oil, and salt 
water exist in the Trenton limestone. The uppermost beds of the great 
Trenton formation in northwestern Ohio, central and northern Indiana, 
Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin consist of a porous dolomite 5, 50, 100, 



ORIGIN OF ROCK PRESSURE OF NATURAL GAS. 159 

or even 150 feet in tliickness. Sometimes the dolomite is found in a 
eontinuous body, but oftener in interrupted beds. This part of the for- 
mation has outcrops in the Manitoulin islands of Lake Superior and in 
the Galena limestoneof Illinois and Wisconsin. In the gas and oil fields, 
it is found lying in terraces and monoclines, or flat arches, 800 to 1,500 
feet below the surface; and these several features effect the separation 
of the varied contents of the porous rock. The boundaries of gas, oil, 
and salt water are easily determinable and are scrupulously maintained 
ill the rock, except that as soon as development begins the salt water 
is always the aggressive and advancing element. When the drill de- 
scends into the gas rock proper dry gas escapes; when into the contig- 
uous and lower-lying terrace, oil accompanied with gas appears, as al- 
ready (h'scribed ; but at a little lower level salt water is struck, and this 
rises i)romptly in tlie well, sometimes to the point of overflow. Far out 
from the narrow ridges or restricted terraces where gas and oil are found 
tlie salt water reigns undisturbed, and wherever reached by the drill it 
rises in the wells as in those ah-eady described. It would be in the high- 
est degree absurd to count the little pockets of gas that are found in 
the arches the cans*; of the ascent of this ocean of salt water a score 
or a liundred miles away. The rise of the salt water is unmistakably 
artesian. It depends on hydrostatic pressure, as does the flow of all 
artesian wells, and its head nuist be sought, as in other like flows, in 
the higher ])ortions of the stratum that are contiguous. 

The nearest outcrops of this porous Trenton have been already 
named. They are found in the shores of Lake Superior at an altitude 
of about 000 feet above tide. It is certainly significant that when an 
abundant flow of salt water is struck in a boring in northern Ohio or 
in Indiana, no matter at what depth, it rises generally about to the level 
of Lake Superior; or, in other words, about GOO feet above tide. If the 
mouth of the well is below this level, as is the case in the Wabash Val- 
k^y, the salt water overflows. On the shore of Lake Erie the water 
rises to within 20 feet of the surface; in Findlay, to within 200 feet. 
Ihe height to which the salt water rises in any portion of the field is 
one of tlie elements to be used in measuring the force which can be 
exerted on the gas and oil that are caught in the traps of the terraces 
and arches of the ])orous Trenton limestone. 

Why, then, is not the rock pressure of the gas the same in all jior- 
tions of the new liorizon ? For the obvious reason, I reply, that there 
is a ^•aryiIlg element involved, viz., the depth of ill e rock below sea level. 
Tlie surface elevations at the wells vary greatly, and the wells of the 
same depth consequently find the gas rock in very different relations 
to sea level. 

THE TEST OF THE HYDROSTATIC THEORY. 

It is obvious that if an explanation of the rock pressure of the Tren- 
ton limestone gas is attcni])ted on this basis, there are facts enough 
now at command to substantiate or overthrow it. By the f\icts it must

stand or fall. In the accompanying table I have indicated the follow- 
ing lines of facts as to strictly representative wells in the leading dis- 
tricts of the new gas fields, viz, (1) location, (2) depth at which gas is 
found, (3) relation of this depth to sea level, (4) the initial rock pres- 
sure of the gas. In regard to the last line of facts I have taken, in 
almost all cases, figures that I have myself verified. (5) A fifth column 
I add, in which the pressure due in the particular well is calculated 
from the two following elements, viz, an assumed elevation of the salt 
water to the Lake Superior level, or GOO feet above tide; and, secondly, 
an assumed specific gravity of tlie salt water of the Trenton of 1.1, 
which gives a weight of 0.476 pound to the foot.

These figures seem to me to settle the question as to the origin of the 
rock pressure of the gas in this formation. I feel sure that nicer de- 
terminations of the facts involved as to altitude and depth would bring 
a still closer agreement between columns four and five. I will ask you 
to note in particular the facts as to the St. Mary's and the St. Henry's 
wells. They have practically the same depth, 1,159 and 1,15G feet; 
but there is a difference of 38 feet in the depth of the gas rock with 
reference to sea level. There is a corresponding difference in the rock 
pressure of 15 pounds, as recorded. The difference in rock pressure 
due to this 38 feet by calculation is 13.8 pounds, or, practically, 15 
pounds. I presume that column five is as near the truth in this par- 
ticular as column four. The gauge would quite certainly be reported 
385 pounds if it lacked but 1 or 2 pounds of that number. 

THE LAWS OF GAS PRODUCTION. 

The laws of gas and oil production and accumulation are coming to 
light more clearly in the flat country of Ohio and Indiana than they 
have ever done among the hills and valleys of the older AUeghany 
fields. As it seems to me, no more important deduction from the new 



ORIGIN OF ROCK PRESSURE OF NATURAL GAS. 161 

districts bus been reached tbau the law now stated, viz: The rod- pres- 
sure of Trenton limestone gas is due to a salt-u-ater column, measured 
from about 600 feet above tide to the level of the stratum which yields the 
(/as. The column can be conveniently counted as made up of two parts, 
viz., a fixed length of 000 feet added to the depth of the gas rock below 
tide. 

If tliis explanation is accepted as satisfactory for Trenton limestone 
gas, 1 venture to suggest that the fact will go a great ways towards 
rendering probable a like explanation for rock pressure in all other 
gas fields; but 1 will not at the present time venture to extend it be- 
yond the limits I have named. I am aware of certain facts, or at least 
su])])osed facts, from the older fields that seem difficult of explanation 
on this basis. 

There are a few obvious inferences from this law to which 1 venture 
to call your attention in closing this paper: 

(1) There is no danger that the great gas reservoirs of to-day will 
"cave in" or "blow up" after the gas is withdrawn from them. The 
gas will not leave the porus rock until the salt water obliges it to leave 
by driving it out and taking its place. 

(2) This doctrine lays the ax at the root of all the optimistic theories 
w hicli blossom out in every district where natural gas is discovered, 
and especially among the real-estate operators of each new field, to the 
effect that nature will not fail to perijetually maintain or perpetually 
renew the supplies which we find so delightfully adapted to our com- 
fort and service. So far as we are concerned it is certain that nature 
has done about all that she is going to do in this line. In her great 
laboratory a thousan<l j-ears are as a single day. 

(3) No doctrine could exert a more healthful influence on the commu- 
nities that are enjoying the inestimable advantages of the new fuel than 
this. If it were at once accepted it would add years to the duration of 
these precious supplies of power. The ignorant and reckless waste 
that is going on in the new gas fields is lamentable. The worst of it 
comes from city and village corporations that are bringing the gas 
\\ ithin their boundaries to give away to manufacturers whom they can 
induce on these terms to locate among them. To characterize the use 
of a million feet of natural gas a day, in a single town, for burning com- 
mon brick, for exami)le, or in calcining common limestone, there is a 
good word at hand, viz., vandalism. 

(4) If this doctrine of the rock pressure of gas is the true one, the 
geologists who have to deal Mith the subject and the communities that 
have found a supply owe it to themselves to keep it prominently before 
the people who are especially interested. They may make themselves 
temporarily disagreeable thereby, but by just so far as they convince 
those that are interested, they lengthen the life of these precious suii- 
plies.

THE DURATION OF GAS SUPPLY. 

Judging from the present indications, the Trenton limestone gas of 
Ohio is not likely to be long-lived. It seems entirely probable that the 
term of its further duration can be stated within the limits of numbers 
that are expressed by a single digit. In considerable sections of the 
held, the salt water is very aggressive. It requires a steadily increas- 
ing pressure on the wells to hold it back. In one district last year, one 
hundred and twenty-five pounds pressure would keep the gas dry, while 
now two hundred pounds are required for the same purpose. 

There is likely to be great disappointment in regard to what is called 
gas territory. The pressure and volume of large areas are found to fail 
together. Wells draw their supplies from long distances. A farm, or 
even a mile-square section, may be effectually drained of its gas with- 
out a well being drilled upon it. 

Natural gas is a very admirable product, but its highest office, after 
all, should be to prepare the way for something better than itself, viz., 
artificial gaseous fuel — better, for the reason that while it furnishes all 
the intrinsic advantages of natural gas, it will be free from the inevita- 
ble disadvantages of treasures secured in the way in which the stores 
of the great gas fields have been gained. 



GEYSERS. 



By Walter Harvey Weed. 



The liot-wiiter (ouiitaiiis, called geysers, are natunil wonders that are 
of meiieral as well as scientitic interest. The striking nianifestation 
which they aiibrd of the earth's intei iial heat, their great beauty, and 
no\ el surroundings make them indeed worthy of that wide-spread inter- 
est which they arouse, and it is in the ho[»c of gratifying a general cu- 
liosity concerning these wonderful fountains that the present paper 
lias been written. 

At the outset of this inquiry into the nature and occurrence of these 
natural steam engines it is necessary to exactly define what is a gey- 
ser? r»iietiy, a geyser is a hot spring which intermittently ejects a col- 
umn of boiling water and steam. Before attempting to piesent such a 
general account of the various geyser regions of the Avorld as will en- 
able the reader to follow the deductions derived from a study of the 
occurrence and the characteristics of geysers, it maybe well to present 
a sumnuiry of the i)aper. 

It is believed that the facts recorded in this article show: 

First. That geysers occur only in volcanic regions, and in acid vol- 
canic rocks. In Iceland and New Zealand the volcanic fires are still 
active. In the Yellowstone region the lavas are chiefly of pre-glacial 
age. 

Second. Geysers occur only along lines of drainage, on shores of lakes 
or other situations where meteoric waters would naturally seek the sur- 
face, l^nheated waters are often found issuing inclose proximity to 
geysers. 

Third. Geyser waters are meteoric waters which have not penetrated 
to great depths but have been heated by ascending vapors. 

I''(»urth. The sui)ply of heat is derived from great masses of lava 
slowly ■' oling from a state of former incandescence, heating waters, 
which, descending to the hot rocks, ascend as highly heated vapors. 

I'^ifth. The intermittent spouting of geysers is due to tlie gradual 
heating of water accumulated in fissures or tubes in the rocks, the only 
mechanism necessary being a tube, which may or may not have local 
expansions or chambers.

164 GEYSERS. 

Sixth. Geysers may ovighuite in several ways, thougli most commonly 
produced by the opening of new waterways along fissure planes of the 
rocks, by a gradual eating out of a tube by ascending hot vapors. 

Seventh. The thermal activity of geyser regions is not rapidly dying 
out. The decrease of heat is very slow, and thougli changes take place 
from year to year, the establishment of new geysers and new hot springs 
offsets the decay or drying up of old vents. 

Attemjits to solve the mysterious spouting of geysers date back to 
the earlier part of the present epoch of scientific research, and the 
genius of Bunsen and Deseloiseaux was devoted to a study of the Ice- 
land geysers as early as 1847. The most important result of their ex- 
periments and observations was a theory of geyser action, now (with 
slight modifications) generally accepted, but other conclusions have 
lately been proven by observations made in the Yellowstone Park to be 
erroneous. Although numerous visits to the geysers of Iceland by 
later observers led to various ingenious speculations and theories re- 
specting geyser eruptions, the questions of geyser origin and the sig- 
nifigance of their occurrence and other questions of liroader scope 
were not touched upon. 

The discovery of the geysers of Ncav Zealand a|)pears to have 
awakened interest, more because of the wonderfully beautiful terraced 
basins about the geysers of Rotomahana than from any appreciation 
of the opportunity aflbrded for a study of the geysers themselves, tlieir 
relations to the geological structure of the country, or their raison 
d'etre; and not until the mapping and study of the Yellowstone geyser 
basins was made by the Hayden survey, was there the slightest attempt 
to look at the broader questions awaiting solution. In his final report, 
after giving an account of various theories of geyser action. Dr. Peale 
discusses very briefly various pecularities of geysers and the supposed 
influence of atmospheric charges and concludes with a statement of 
the three conditions he believes to be necessary to the existence of 
geysers which are essentially confirmed by the long continued study of 
the Yellowstone region by the writer. 

In looking at the distribution of geysers in various parts of the 
world one is quickly impressed with their great rarity. Hot springs 
abound in many countries, but boiling springs are characteristic only 
of regions of recent (that is geologically recent) volcanic activity; it is 
only in such regions that geyseis occur. Until late in this century 
Iceland was the only land where gej^sers had been found. Less than 
lV)rty years ago they were discovered in considerable numbers in ]SIew 
Zealand, and since then a few others have been reported from other 
parts of the world. The " Geyserland" of the world is undoubtedly, 
however, tlie Yellowstone National Park, a region situated in the heart 
of the Ilocky Mountains, at the head waters of the Missouri and Yel- 
lowstone, and discovered so late as 1869. 



GEYSERS. 165 

Tn order to briug before tbe reader a general idea of tbe true relation 
of g(^yser vents to tbe surrounding topograpby and water courses of 
tbe districts, a brief description of tbe tbree great geyser regions of 
tbe world will be attempted. It bas been my good fortune to bave 
spent seven summers at tbe various geyser " basins " of tbe Yellow- 
stone in connection witb my duties as assistant geologist on tbe U. S. 
Geological Survey party, under Arnold Hague. Tbe otlier regions are 
familiar from a large series of excellent pbotograpbs as well astbrougb 
tbe descriptions of friends and tbe writings of otber visitors to tbose 
countries. 

THE ICELAND GEYSERS. 

Iceland is tbe birtbplace of tbe word geyser. It bas been called tbe 
land of frost and fire, and indeed in no place are tbe evidences, nay tbe 
very forces tbemselves, of frost and fire brought so forcibly in contrast. 
Tiie island is eminently a volcanic region, a central table-land witb 
sharp volcanic peaks, booded witb great Jokuls or glaciers, man- 
tb'd witb perpetual snows, and surrounded by a more or less narrow 
strip of lowhiiid bordering upon tbe sea. Tbe evidences of internal 
fire are unmistakable. Hecla and otber volcanoes are occasionally 
active, and tbe wbole island is covered witb lava poured out by tbe 
volcanoes, and tbe source of tbe beat supplying tbe geysers is unques- 
tioned. 

As would naturally be expected from tbe combination of water and 
lire, hot si)rings are abundant and at a few localities geysers are found. 
Tbe most noteworthy of these is Haukadal, wbere Tbe Geyser, Strokr, 
and a smaller geyser are found. This locality is about 70 miles 
from Keykiavik, the Iceland metropolis, and is only reached on horse- 
back over beds of clinkers and rougb lava fields ; a dreary ride so far 
as scenery goes, but of fresh novelty to visitors from warmer lands. 
The hot springs are clustered in an area of about 20 acres, at tbe base 
of a hill about an eighth of a mile long and 300 feet bigb, and at tbe 
edge of tbe marshy bottom that stretches out toward tbe Hvita River. 
Tbe s])rings are really at the base of tbe seaward border of tbe high 
ground where tbe waters tbat bave percolated througb tbe tufas and 
lK)rous lavas of the higher region would come to the surface. Tbe two 
geysers, Strokr and The (leyser, issue from mounds of gray or white 
f-ilica de])osited by tbe hot waters, and the neighboring springs are sur- 
rounded by lesser areas of the same material, while on tbe billside back 
of till* s])rings the rock is decomi>osed by the steam of fumeroles. These 
two large spouters show two types of geysers. Strokr has a funnel-like 
l)it 30 feet deep and S feet across, (see fig. 1, page 174,) expanding into 
a saucer-like basin. The tube is generally filled to within 6 feet of the 
top witb clear water, which boils furiously, owing to tbe escape of great 
bubbles of steam coming from two openings in opposite sides of tbe 



166 GEYSERS. 

tube. The eruptions are quite as beautiful as those of its more famous 
companion, the jets rising in a sheaf-like column to a height of 100 or 
more feet, eruptions taking place at very irregular and long intervals; 
but by putting a lid on this great kettle, by dumping in large pieces 
of turf, an eruption can be produced in a short time. 

The Geyser, on the contrary, is a pool of limpid, green water whose 
surfape rises and falls in rhythmic pulsations. The usual temperature 
is but 170° F. or 200° F., but varies, being greater immediately before 
an eruption. The shallow, saucer-like basin is about 60 feet across and 
slopes gently to a cylindrical shaft 10 feet in diameter, forming the pipe 
of the geyser ; this is about 70 feet deep. This regularity of the tube be- 
comes important when we consider Bunsen's experiments and the theory 
of geyser action he deduced from them. Before an eruption bubbles 
of steam entering the tube suddenly collapse with loud but muffled re- 
ports and a disturbance of the quiet surface of the water. During this 
simmering, for such it is, the water rises in dome-like mounds over the 
pipe and overflows the basin, running down the terraced slope and wet- 
ting the cauliflower-like forms of sinter that adorn it. 

The eruptions that so long puzzled and astonished visitors to this re- 
mote land are surpassed by those of the giants of the Yellowstone, 
but their beauty is not less. A short time before Geyser plays, the 
domes of water rising in the center of the basin, come in quick succession 
and finally burst into spray, followed by a rai)id succession of jets in- 
creasing in height until the column is 100 feet high. Dense clouds 
of steam momentarily hide the glistening sheaf of jets, hiding it from 
sight, then drifting away in the breeze again reveal the sjjarkling shaft. 

These eruptions have varied much in appearance and height since the 
geyser was first known. At present the column does not exceed 90 
feet and the eruption lasts but a few moments. After it the basin is 
<3mpty and seems to be lined with a smooth coating of white silica. 

THE GEYSERS OF NEW ZEALAND. 

The geysers of New Zealand are situated in a region clothed with a 
luxuriant vegetation that is in strong contrast to the bleak and barren 
lava fields of Iceland, but an examination of the position of the springs, 
with respect to the x)hysical features of the region, shows that the 
situation of the geysers is nearly the same in these antipodal isles. 
The New Zealand geysers occur in the North Island, in what is known 
as the volcanic region, or the Taupo zone. Within an area of 4,725 
square miles, in Avhich none but volcanic rocks are found, there are six 
volcanoes, and great numbers of solfataras, furaeroles, mud volcnuoes, 
and hot springs, and many geysers. The lavas are all of the acid t^npe, 
mostly rhyolite, but are hidden by surface decomposition and an abun- 
dant vegetation, save upon the flanks of the peaks. The axial line of 



GEYSERS. KIT 

tliis zone ruiiuiug northeast is marked at eacli end bj^ an active vol- 
cano, and its conrse by a line of greatest hydrothernial activity; a 
siiinoiis line of hot springs following ^Yell marked geographic featnres 
of river valleys, low plains, and lake margins, with higher country on 
either side rising to plateaus of 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the sea. 

Little is known of the geysers on the sh )res of Lake Taupo, or those 
on the banks of the Waikato River, but the famous terraces of Ko- 
tomaliaiia, culled the eighth wonder of the world by James Anthony 
I''ron<lc, attracted attention to the geysers whicli formed them, and 
made their vicinity the best known part of the district. The warm 
lake, called by the Maoris, Rotomahana, was a shallow body of warm 
water, abont a mile long, and a quarter of a mile broad, comprising 
IS") acres. The waters were of a dirty, greenish hue, reflecting the 
somber green of the fern and the ti-tree-covered slopes about it, and 
the sedgy margins sheltered large numbers of duck and other water- 
fowl. Rising above its surface like stairways of delicately sculptured 
nuirble, were the pink and white terraces. At the top of the terrace, 
\'2{) feet above the lake, was the Terata geyser, whose overflow had 
l»nilt up this wonderful work and filled the basins and pools with wa- 
ters whose tints were both the delight of the eye and the despair of 
the pen. 

The geyser caldron was some 60 by 80 feet across, its clear and boil- 
ing water usually overflowing, and occasionally ejected to a height of 
10 to 100 feet, wetting the steep banks of bright-colored fumerole clays 
about the crater, but not forming the beaded geyserite, characteristic 
of so many of these fountains. Such eruptions followed a period of 
(piieseence, when the waters retired within the pipe for many hours. 
( )wing to the comparative inaccessibility of the caldron and the beauty 
of the terraces, but few observations are on record of the action of the 
geyser. The water (tarried 151) grains of solid matter to the gallon, of 
which one-third was silica, and the daily outflow of 100,000 to 600,000 
gallons per hour brought up 10 tons of solid matter dissolved out of 
the underlying rocks. It is easy to see what great underground cav- 
erns would be formed by this geyser alone in a comparatively brief time. 
In the volcanic outbreak of Tarawera, in June, 1886, the waters of the 
lake and underground reservoirs were drawn into the newly opened 
fissure, and, by the extraordinary explosion that followed the terraces 
were destroyed, and the site of Rotoniahara became a crater that threw 
mud over the surrounding country. 

THE YELLOWSTONE " GEYSERLAND." 

The wonderfnl variety, the great number, and the large size of the 
geysers of America, found in the Yellowstone National Park, demand 
a somewhat longer account of this region, which I am the more willing 
to give as it has been my good fortune to have spent a large part of 



168 GEYSERS. 

the past nine summers in a study of its geysers and liot springs. To 
many readers this legion is doubtless famihar. The geysers are found 
in detached groups, occupying basins or valleys of the great table-land 
which forms the central portion of the park, a region whose heavy 
forests and uninviting aspect, combined with the rugged nature of the 
encircling mountain ranges, so long proved a barrier to exploration 
even to those adventurous trappers and prospectors of the Great West, 
and deferred the discovery of this marvellous region until so recent a 
date as 1869. 

The geyser "basins," as the localities are termed, conform, in their re- 
lations to the surrounding high ground and their coincidence with lines 
of drainage and the loci of springs, to the laws governing the distribu- 
tion of the same phenomena in other parts of the world. The park itself 
is a reservation of about 3,500 square miles, the central portion being an 
elevated volcanic plateau, accentuated by deep and narrow caiions and 
broad gentle eminences, and surrounded by high and rugged mountain 
ranges. This central portion, whose average elevation is about 8,000 
feet above the sea, embraces all the hot-spring and geyser areas of the 
park. The volcanic activity that resulted in the formation of the park 
plateau may be considered as extinct, nor are there any evidences of 
fresh lava flows. Yet, the hot springs so widely distributed over the 
plateau are convincing evidence of the presence of underground heat. 
There is no doubt that the waters derive their high temperature from 
the heated rocks below, and that the origin of the heat is, in some way? 
associated with the source of volcanic energy. 

The various geyser basins, or fire holes, as they were called by the 
first explorers, each possess individual peculiarities which give charac- 
ter and interest to each locality. The most noted of these " basins" is 
however that known as the Upper Geyser Basin of the Firehole River 
one of the headwaters of the great Missouri. This " Upper Basin," as it 
is generaDy called, lies a little westward of the center of the park, and 
is reached by a ride of some 50 miles, over excellent roads, from the 
railroad terminus. It is a valley of 1^ miles long by one-half mile 
broad, inclosed by the rocky cliffs or darkly wooded slopes of the great 
Madison Plateau, and drained by the Firehole River, along whose 
banks the largest geysers are situated. The whole floor of the valley 
is fairly riddled with springs of boiling water, whose exquisite beauty 
is indescribable. Light clouds of fleecy vapor curl gently upward from 
waters of the purest azure or the clearest of emerald, and, encircling- 
rims of white marble-like silica, form fit setting for such great gems. 
A large part of the valley floor is covered with the white deposit of silica 
known as siliceous sinter, deposited by the overflowing hot waters.* 
The weird whiteness of these areas, the gaunt white trunks of pine trees 
killed by the hot waters, the myriad pools of steaming crystal, and the

V. S. (leolof/ical Survey, 1S89. 



GEYSERS. 169 

white clouds tloatiug off froiii the chimuey-like geyser cones, form a 
scene never to be forgotten by those fortunate enough to behold it. 
Within this basin there are nearly thirty geysers, presenting many 
variations of bowl or basin, mound and cone, and whose eruptions are 
equally diversified in form and beauty. 

Sentinel, Fan, Cascade, Riverside, Mortar, and Grotto, greet one on 
entering the basin, either by quiet steaming or by flashing jets. Giant, 
Splendid, Castle, Grand, Giantess, Lion, and Old Faithful are but a 
few of the wondrous fountains of the place. The last is most deserving 
of its name. Every since its discovery, in 1870, it has not failed to send 
up a graceful shower of jets at a regular interval of sixty-five minutes. 
Its beauty is ever varying, as wind and sunlight play upon it, and the 
mound about its vent is adorned with delicately tinted basins of salmon, 
l)ink, and yellow, filled with limpid water whose softness is enticing. It 
is the geyser of the park, and indeed of the world, and many a visitor 
to " geyserland '' departs without seeing any other of the many spouters 
in action and yet feels more than repaid for the journey. For beauty 
of surroundings, the Castle will perhaps be awarded the palm; its 
sinter chimney or cone is formed of exquisite cauliflower or coral-like 
geyserite whose general form makes the geyser's name appropriate. Its 
eruptions are frequent, occurring about every thirty hours, when a 
stream of hot water is thrown up to a height of 75 feet for some 
fifteen minutes, followed by the emission of steam, with a loud roar 
that can be heard for miles. A few hours after the erui)tion the tube 
is again full, and occasional jets of 10 to 20 feet are thrown out until 
tin* next eruption ensues. 

The greatest geyser of the park, and, indeed the grandest of the 
whole world, is Excelsior, some 25 miles beyond theNorris Basin. Un- 
like the less capricious and more fountain like geysers of the Tipper 
Fireliole, this monster of geysers does not spout from a fissure in the 
rock, nor from a crater or cone of its own building. It is a monster of 
destruction, having torn out its great crater in the old sinter-covered 
slope, builded by the placid and beauteous Prismatic Lake. The Avails, 
fiu'Hu^d by the jagged ends of the white sinter layers, are lashed by 
the angry waters that are ever undermining the sides .and enlarging the 
caldron. The erui)tions are so stupendous that all other geysers are 
dwarfed by comi)aiison. The grand outburst is preceded by several 
abortive attempts, when great domes of water rise in the center and 
burst into splashing masses 10 to 15 feet high, while the waters surge 
under the overhanging walls and overflow the slo])e between the crater 
and the river. Finally, with a grand boom or report that shakes the 
ground, an inmiense fan-shaped mass of water is thrown up to a height 
of 200 or more feet, great clouds of steam rolling off" from the boiling 
water, while large blocks of the white sinter are flung far above the 
water and fall about the neighboring slopes. It is a sight that inspires 
enthusiasm in the most ]flilegmatic, and few can resist the temptation 



170 GEYSERS. 

to give loud expression to their feelings. tJufortunately, this monarch 
of all geysers has ceased to erupt, but may be expected to break forth 
again at any time. 

Everywhere save at the Norris basin, of the Yellowstone Park, geyser 
vents are surrounded by cones, mounds, or platforms of white siliceous 
sinter, which, though built up into very beautiful forms, hides the true 
relation of the geyser vent to the fissures in the rocks, so that it hag 
been generally believed, as stated by Tyndall,* that the hot springs 
built uj) tubes of siliceous rock, that made them geysers. That this is 
not true is shown by several great fountains at the Norris basin, that, 
spout directly from fissures in the solid rock, notaldy the Monarch, 
Tippecanoe, and Alcove geysers. 

GEYSER WATERS. 

The descriptions which have been given of the chief geyser regions 
of the world lead to the question : What is the source and character 
of the geyser waters? It has been plainly indicated that, in the fields 
described, the vents are always situated along lines of drainage, on 
the shores of lakes, or under conditions where ordinary springs of 
meteoric wate? would naturally occiir. 

That the geyser waters are surface waters which have percolated 
thrcmgh the porous lavas and have been heated by encountering great 
quantities of steam and gases rising fi'om the hot rocks below there is 
no reasonable doubt. The proximity of ordinary cold springs and 
those of boiling hot water lends support to this view. 

These hot waters, traversing the rocks in irregular fissures, readily 
dissolve out the more soluble constituents of the rocks, the amount and 
the character of the salts present varying somewhat with the nature 
and amount of gases held in the waters. Chemical analyses of geyser 
waters from the three regions described show no greater variation than 
those from different vents in any one of these regions. The following 
table of analyses shows that the waters are all similar in character. The 
analysis of the Yellowstone water was made by Prof. F. A. Gooch and 
for the U. S. Geological Survey. Analyses are also given of the water 
from the great geyser of Iceland, and from the New Zealand geysers, 
the former by Damour,t the latter by Smith.f

Sonree of hvdt. — That the simice of steiiin is the still hot lavas below, 
wild is ill soiiie way coiiuected witli volcanic action, is so evident from 
the facts that no other conclusion is i>ossible. A very common belief 
concerniiiji' tlie source of the heat of boiling springs and geysers, but 
one wliich no longer has the support of scientific men, is that the heat 
results lion I chemical action^ as it is vaguely termed. Were not the 
evi<lence so directly opposed to this idea, it would merit consideration, 
but so f;ir as tlie heat of geyser waters is concerned, all observation 
shows it to be untenable. To this class of theories belongs the popular 
idea that the geyser basins are underlaid by great beds of (quick f) 
lime, which sui)ply the heat and steam of the geysers. 

The smothered combustion of beds of lignite, coal, or pyrites, is an- 
otlier toini of the same theory that has been received with considerable 
fiivor, and still commands a few followers. That hot springs may have 
such an origin is not denied, but tlie geological comlitions and environ- 
ment clearly show tliat none of the great geyser regions of the world 
derive tlieir heat from such action. 

Where the s<mrce of supply is dee}) seated, spring waters always 
have au elevated temperature, generally proportionate to the depth, 
but the very high temperatures of the geysers and the local source of 



172 GEYSERS. 

the waters (^xcliides this theory. The folding aud feultiug of rocks is 
another source of heat made manifest by hot si)riiig\s. 

It has been shown by Dr. Peale, however, that boiliiuj waters are only 
fonnd in the regions of volcanic rocks, and it was pointed out by L'Ap- 
parent that geysers only occur in acid volcanic lavas. In Iceland the 
volcanic forces are still active, and melted lavas may exist at no great 
depth. In New Zealand the recent eruption of the eroded mountain 
Tarawera showed that heated rocks exist, and in that case rose up 
near enough to the surface to cause the explosion which so trans- 
formed the country. 

In the Yellowstone there are no active volcanoes, and none of even 
geologically recent activity. The lavas that fill the ancient mountain- 
encircled basin of the park are scored by glaciers and deeply cut by 
running water; and the old volcanoes from which the lavas were, in part 
at least, outpoured show no signs of having been active since Tertiary 
times. Yet in this region the expenditure of heat by the hot springs, 
geysers, and steam vents would undoubtedly keep a moderate-sized 
volcano in a very active state were it concentrated. There is no doubt 
that this heat is connected Avith the past volcanic energies of the region 
and derived principally from the still hot lavas, three-quarters of the 
entire area of the park (3,500 square miles) being covered by rhyolitic 
rocks. 

The significance alluded to above, of the association of geysers and 
acid lavas (rhyolites), is possibly to be found in the fact that these rocks 
a.re more easily dissolved by the hot waters forming the tubes and res- 
ervoirs for geysers. The situation of hot springs and geysers along 
water courses has already been mentioned. It is a well-known fact 
that the presence of water in the pores of a rock increases its capacity 
to conduct heat, so that we may surmise a rise in the local isogeo therm 
in such situations. 

Geyser eruptions. — Geysers have often been compared to volcanoes, 
presenting in miniature, with water instead of molten rock, all the phe- 
nomena of a volcanic erui^tion. The diversity of form aud varying con- 
ditions of activity of the hot springs found associated with geysers 
makes it impossible to determine in every case whether a spiing is 
or is not a geyser. Geyser vents may be mere rifts in the naked rocks 
or bowls of clear and tranquil Avater, quiet until disturbed by the first 
throes of an erux)tion, and surrounded by Avhite sinter deposits in nowise 
distinguishable from those about hot springs. In other cases the vents 
are surrounded by a cone or mound of pearly-beaded " geyserite," a 
certain and distinctive feature of a geyser. 

The displays of the great " Geyser " of Iceland have already been 
briefly described j they may be taken as the type of eruptions from gey- 
sers having bowl like expansions at the top of the tube, the so-called 
*' basin" of the geyser. Where the vent is surrounded by a cone of 
sinter, as is so often the case among the fountains of New Zealand and 



GKV.SKRS. 173 

the Yellowstone, the first i)ait of the geyser eruption is somewhat differ- 
ent. Perhaps the most familiar geyser of this type is Old Faithful, the 
one geyser in the Yellowstone tliat is sure not to disappoint the visitor. 
Though surpassed by many of its neighbors in the heightand magnitude 
of its eruptions, it holds a front rank for beauty and graeefulness. Pre- 
viously heralded by loud rumblings, with spasmodic outbursts of 10 to 
20 feet in height that mark abortive attempts to send up its steaming 
pillar, the white (;olumn is finally thrown upwards with a loud roar, and 
mounts at once to a height that seemshundredsof feet as we gaze upon 
it, Foi- two, or even three minutes, the column maintains a height 
which measurements show to vary from 90 feet up to 150 feet, with oc 
casional steei)le-shaped Jets rising still higher, the Jets ever varying and 
giving oft" great rolling cloudsof steam ; then the jets gradually decrease 
in altitude, and in five minutes the eruption is over, the tube apparently 
em])ty, and emitting occasional puflfs of steam for a few minutes longer. 

During the eruption the water falls in heavy masses about the vent, 
filling the basins that adorn the mound, and flowing off in yellow and 
orangecolored waterways, while the finer spray drifts off with the 
breeze and falls upon the neighboring sinter slopes. It is impossible 
to measure the amount of water throAvn out, since it runs off in a num- 
ber of diiections in shallow rills that lead either to the sandy terrace 
ne;ir by or to the river. If however we assume that the column of 
steam and water is one-third water, a fair assumption, the estimated 
discharge is 3,000 barrels at each eruption. 

Comparing Old Faithful with its Iceland prototype we find consider- 
able (lifi'erence in the behavior of the two vents during the interval 
between eruptions. The former, like Strokr, has no bowl or basin, and 
the geyser throat or tube is partly filled with, water, which is in con- 
stant and energetic ebullition, while the gej^ser is inactive. The tube 
and Ixtwl of ''Geyser" are, on the contrary, tilled with comparatively 
cool water. Jn each case, however, the eruption is preceded by an 
overflow from the geyser tube, in the case of Strokr and Old Faithful, 
as Jets of 10 feet to 25 feet in height; in "Geyser" by a filling of the 
bowl and successive overflows, accompanied by the noise of condens- 
ing steam bubbles, a simmering of the water in the tube. Such pre- 
liminary actions are significant when we consider the theory of geyser 
action. 

Theorkfi of geyser action. — The intermittent spouting of geysers was 
long a riddle to scientific men, for although several theories seemed 
each to ofter a satisfactory exi)lanation of the eruptions of "Gey- 
ser," they supposed conditions unlikely to occur in many vents. The 
investigations of Bunsen, and ot ])escloizeaux, who spent two weeks 
studying the Iceland fountains, resulted in the announcement of a 
theory of geyser action which, with slight modifications, has satisfied 
all requirements and is to-day generally accepted as the true explaua-

tioii of the action of these natural steam engines. This theory, which 
bears the name of the ilhistrions Bunsen, depends ui)on the well- 
known fact that the boiling point of water rises with the pressure, 
and is therefore higher at the bottom of a tube of water than at the 
surface. Tlie temperature of water heated in any vessel is generally 
equalized by convective current^, but in a long and narrow or an 
irregular tube this circulation is impeded, and while the water at the 
surface boils at 100° C. (at sea level), ebullition in the lower part of 
the tube is only possible at a much higher temperature, owing to the 
weight of the water column above it. In the section of Geyser shown 
in the figure the observed temperatures are given on the left, and the 
temperatures at which the waters would boil, taking into account the 
pressure of the water column, are given on the right. In Geyser the 
nearest approximate to the bojliag point is at a depth of 45 feet oppo-

site a ledge and fissure discovered subsequent to Bunsen's experiments. 
At this depth the temiierature is 2° C. below the temperature at which 
the water can boil. If by the continued heating of this layer by steam 
from the fissure it attains the temperature at which it can boil, steam 
is formed, whose expansive force lifts the superincumbent column of 
water, causing a slight overflow at the top, which, shortening the col- 
umn, brings the layer B to the position C, where its temperature is 
above the boiling point of C, wherefore steam is formed at this point and 
a further lifting and relief of pressure ensues, followed by an eruption. 

In illustration of this theory a model geyser is easily constructed of 
a glass tube of an inch or so in diameter and several feet long. When 



GEYSERS. 175 

this tul)e is closed at one end, filled with water and placed upright we 
have all the niechanisin necessary to produce all tlie phenomena of a 
geyser. P>y heating tlie water at the bottom by tlie introduction of 
steam (or with a spirit lamp), we can produce eruptions whose period 
will depend upon the intensity of the heat. At first the bubbles of 
steam collapse iu the cool waters at the bottom of the tube, but as the 
temperature rises the bubbles rise part way up the tube and heat the 
lower pait of the colnmn fo a. high temperature while the water near 
the surface is still cool. I^jventnally the water at the bottom reaches 
the i)ret;sure boiling point, when steam is formed, lifting the water 
above it and cansing an overflow at the top. This overflow or its 
Cipiivalent, the filling of a shallow basin at the top of the tube, relieves 
the pressure and all that part of the column Avhose temperature was 
previously below the boiling point but now exceeds it, flies into steam 
and ejects the water above with great violence. The glass walls of our 
geyser tube permit us to watch the gradual heating of the water by 
means of thermometers suspended in the tube, the ascent and collapse 
of steam bubbles, the overflow and abortive attempts to erupt and the 
linal ejection of tlie water from the tube. 

Where the tube is surrounded at the top by a basin no actual over- 
flow need occur. Indeed there is in the Yellowstone a miniature gey- 
ser, aptly named the Model, with a tube but li inches in diameter, sur- 
rounded by a shaUow, sancer-like basin, which has eruptions about 
every fifteen minutes of ,'> feet to 5 feet in height in which scarcely a 
drop of water is wasted, but flows back into the tube after the erup- 
tion. During the interval between eruptions no water can be seen in 
the tube, whose basin and uj^per j)art are dry and cool. The first sig- 
nal of tlie coming display is a (piiet welling up of the water in the tube 
tilling the little basin, which being relatively large and shallow relieves 
the water column of a considerable height. During the eruption v.-hich 
follows, the spray is chilled by the air, falling back into the basin; at 
th(! end of the display the water is quickly sucked back into the tube 
and re-heated for the ensuing eruption. 

At first thought the constant boiling of the waters in the tube of 
Strokr, Old Faithful and many other geysers seems to oppose the 
theory which we have just given. Observations show however that 
in many cases the boiling is confined to the surface and deep tempera- 
tvucs do not reach the boiling i)oint corresponding to the depth. It is 
qnite likely also that in some cases a lesser and independent supply of 
heat may connect with the upper part of a geyser tube; Strokr, we 
know, lias two vents (see figure), one of which is the geyser tube, the 
funnel-like throat of Strokr being really but a nozzle to the geyser. 

It is unnecessary to describe the numerous other theories of geyser 
action ; they all suppose caverns or systems of chambers and tubes, of 
definite arrangenuMit, a supposition most unlikely to occur in many 
cases, and made unnecessary by l>unsen's theory. Local expansions 
aud irregularities of the tube do exist, and to them we owe many of 



176 GEYSERS. 

the individual peculiarities of geysers, but such chambers do uot form 
a vital, esseutial part of the geyser mechanism. 

In an excellent resume of the various theories of geyser action. Dr. 
A. C. Peale states that he believes no one theory is adequate to explain 
all the phenomena of geyser action, though Bunsen's theory comes 
nearest to it. * 

I believe however that Bunsen's theory is a perfect explanation if 
wc but admit that the geyser tube may be neither straight nor regular, 
but of any shape or size, and probably differing very much for each 
vent . The shape of the bowl or basin exercises but little influence upon 
the eruption save to produce the many individual pecnliarities of the 
geyser column. 

Origin of Gei/.sers. — It should be noted that Bunsen's theory of geyser 
action is quite independent of his theory of geyser formation. The 
building uj) of a siliceous tube by the evaporation of the waters at the 
margin of a hot si)ring, is a process which may be seen in operation in 
any of the geyser regions of the world; but it is not a necessary pre- 
lude to the formation of a geyser, for a simple fissure in the rock 
answers equally well, as is shown at the Korris geyser basin in the 
Yellowstone Park. 

The life history of a geyser varies, of course, for each one, but obser- 
vations show that the following sequence of events often takes place. 
The hot vapors rising from unknown depths penetrate the rocks along 
planes of fracture and shrinkage cracks, decomposing and softening 
the rock until the pressure of the steam and water is sufficient to force 
an opening to the surface. If this opening affords an easier exit for 
waters issuing at a higher level the fissure is probably opened with a 
violent ejection of mud and debris; more often the process is a gradual 
one, accompanying the slow eating away of the rock walls along the 
fissure. The flowing waters slowly clear out the fissure, forming a tube 
that permits the freer escape of hot water and steam, while at the same 
time the waters change from a thick mud to a more or less clear fluid. 
The spring, at first a simple boiling nuid-hole, is now an intermittently 
boiling spring, which soon develops true geyser action. If the open- 
ing of the fissure afforded a new outlet for the waters of some already 
existing geyser, these changes take place rapidly, and eruptions begin 
as soon as the pipe is sufliciently cleared to hold enough water. The 
bare I'ock about the vent or fissure is soon whitened by silica deposited 
by the hot waters. This sinter may form a mound about the exi)anded 
tube or basin, or, if the vent be small and spray is frequently ejected, 
it builds up the curious geyser cones so prominent in the Yellowstone. 
In certain cases the building up of these deposits may partially choke 
the geyser's throat, and cause a diminution of the geyser's energy, 
whose forces seek an easier outlet. In other cases the eating out of 
new subterranean waterways deprives the geyser of its supply of heat,

aii<l the vent becoiiu's either a tranquil king or wholly extinct, while 
the peai'ly f/cyaerite forming- its cone disintegrates and crumbles into 
line shaly debris, resembling comminuted oyster shells. Thus there is 
a slow but continual change in ])rogress at the geyser basins, in which 
old springs become extinct and new ones come into being and activity. 
\N'ith tew <'.\ceptions, where th<' vents are very new, geysers spout 
I'rom basins or from cones of white siliceous sinter, or geyserite, depos- 
ited about the vent by the hot waters. HxwAi deposits are formed very 
slowly, one-twentieth of an inch a year being an average rate of growth 
for tlie deposit formed by evaporation alone. These deposits of sinter 
are therefore an index to the age of the geyser. In many cases these 
sinter cones ai'c very odd, fantastic structures of great beauty while wet 
by the the geyser spray, bnt becoming white, opaque, and chalk-like 
upon drying. Where the spattered drops fall in a line spray the 
deposit is ]»early, and the surface very finely s])icular. If the spray be 
coarse the rods are stouter ami capped by pearly heads of lustrous 
l)rilliancy. Thus the cone is not only a measure of a geyser's age and 
activity, bnt it tells, in a way, the nature of the eruption. 

Ariificitd proflucfioii of geyser eri(2}fions. — Eruptions of Strokr have, 
for many years, been provoked by artificial means. The funnel-shaped 
geyser throat makes it an easy matter to plug it with a barrowful of 
turf cat in the a<ljat'ent marsh. This acts as a cover, confining the 
steam, wliicli finally overcomes tiie resistance and produces an erui)- 
t ion. Travellers have also attempted to hasten the eruptions of geysers 
by throwing blocks of sinter down the tube, but it is evident that such 
measures can only succeed when the forces of heat and pressure are in 
a very delicate eciuilibrium. 

In the A'ellowstone geyser basins it has been found that geyser erup- 
tions nniy be hastened or even caused in simply boiling springs l)y the 
use of soap or of lye. The discovery of this extraordinary fact was 
made in a ^■erv curious way. A Chinaman was engaged by the hotel 
company to wash tiie soiled linen; thinking to utilize the abundance of 
hot water ])rovided by nature, a rude canvas buihling Avas put up over a 
small, circular, boiling si)ring near the edge of the Firehole Kiver. In 
this spring the partly cleansed and soaped clothes were put to boil, 
suspended in a. wicker-basket. All went well until the Chinaman left his 
bar of soap with the clothes, when the spring suddenly threw out bas- 
ket, clothes, and hot water, wrecking the shanty and starting the 
Chinaman on a run from a jdace that was too near the infernal regions 
for coinlbrt. This eru[)ti()n, and the observed elfect of soap in increas- 
ing tlie ebullition of boiling spiings, led to the use of soap to produce 
eruptions of this boiling but not s])outing s]>ring, thenceforth known 
as the Chinaman. 

Thi' success attending the use of soap in this instance suggested to 
a ]>hotographer, F. Jay llaynes, the use of soap, or its equivalent, lye, 
to hasten eruptions of those geysers of which he desired to obtain

photographs, and led to experiments by the Geok)gieal Survey* show- 
ing that eruptions can be i)r<)dueed in many eases of geysers, which have 
been most capricious in their exhibitions, or have been inactive for 
weeks or even months. The conditions essential to the successful use 
of soap or lye for tliis purpose seem to be that the geyser tube be small, 
and the water near its boiling point, if not actually boiling at the sur- 
face. Many of the bowls in the Yellowstone possess a temperature at 
their surface exceeding the theoretical boiling point for the altitude 
by 1 or '1 degrees. This apparently anomalous fact is not due to the 
mineral matter held in solution by the hot waters, for the analyses 
show that amount to be too small to have any appreciable effect, but 
it is explained by the waters being free from air, it being well known 
to physicists that water freed from air has an increased boiling point, 
because of the greater cohesion of the particles. The effect of the 
soap is to increase the viscosity of the water, the consequent explosive 
liberation of steam producing an eruption. 

Variations in geyser periods. — Many geysers are easily mistaken for 
vsimple hot or boiling springs, since during the long intervfils between 
eruptions they present no indications of their true nature. 

Tlu' interval between eruptions is manifestly dependent upon the two 
factors of heat and water sui)ply. It rarely happens that these fac- 
tors are so constant that the geyser has a definite period. Even in the 
case of Old Faithful, tise most reliable of all geysers, there are very 
considerable variations in the period, though the average is always con- 
stant from day to day. 

It sometimes hapi:>ens that a slight change in the conditions — a les- 
sened amount of heat or increased amount of water — will cause a ces- 
sation of a geyser's eruptions for a long period. This has hapi)ened in 
New Zealand, where the Waikite geyser, near Lake Rotorua, inactive 
for many years, suddenly ex])loded, scattering blocks of sinter and 
scalding several Maoris who hai^pened to be near by. The Excelsior, 
undoubtedly the largest geyser of the world, was not seen in action 
until 1878, continuing its periodic eruptions till 1882, when it ceased 
a.nd did not play again until 1888. Last summer it was again inactive, 
though the water boiled furiously, bulging iip several feet in the center 
of the great caldron. 

Observations made in I^ew Zealand have led to the belief that the 
eruptions of certain geysers were influenced by the barometric pres- 
sure, and itio said that certain geysers are only active during the prev- 
alence of a noi-thwest wind. Observations in the Yellowstone show no 
such correspoTidence. As a rule the water surface exposed is small and 
the effect of temperature and pressure would be scarcely appreciable, 
yet theoretically it is quite probable that when the forces in a geyser 
are in a delicate equilibrium a change of temperature and i>ressure of 
the air would be quite sufficient to cause an eruption.

By Werner von Siemens. 

Translated from the German, by George E. Curtis. 



In an article in the May luuuber of tlie Mefeorologische Zeitschrift 
entitled " On the tlieoiies of the general circulation of the atmosphere, 
etc.," Mr. A. Si)rung has i)ul)lishe(l a criticism of my computation of the 
direction and force of the general atmospheric current contained in my 
memoir, entitled " On the conservation of energy in the earth's atmos- 
phere,"i)resented tothe academy March 4, 188C. These criticisms induce 
me to make a brief re])ly, not, iinleed, for the purpose of rebutting the 
objections of Dr. Sprung to the rigid validity of the results of my com- 
l)utation— objections with which iu i)art I wholly agree — but to answer 
the assumption that T have made the attempt, in the same Avay as 
Ferrel, " to build up on theoretical computations a theory of the gen- 
eral circulation of the atmosphere." Setting aside the fact that I do not 
consider myself to be sufficiently versed iu mathematical analysis for 
such an attempt, I hold that this method is utterly inai)propriate. A 
l>roblem so extraoidinarily complicated as that of the general circula- 
tion of the air can not possibly be constructed backwards upon the 
basis of mathematical conipntations. There has been lacking up to the 
l)resent time the simple fundamental law governing all the phenomena 
in action. In my considerations " Upon the conservation of energy in 
the earth's atmos])here," I have endeavored first to state the forces 
which produce, maintain, and retard atmospheric motions, and next I 
have sought to determine by computation the general motion of the air, 
both in direction and magnitude, produced by their interaction. With 
respect to this method, it is not correct to say that I, "in the same 
way as Ferrel before me, would show by computation an original con- 
dition of motion in the atmosphere," in order to make it a basis for my 
further speculations. It is equally incorrect to say that in my compu- 
tations I have wholly neglected the retardation of the motion of the air 
by fricti«)n. 

The meridional air current, very ai)tly called by Sprung the funda- 
mental circulation {Grundcirculation), upon which myv theory of the

general system of winds is based, depends, in plain terms, on the equi- 
librium between the acceleration of the air in the equatorial updraft 
(caused by the overheating of the lowest air layers of the torrid zone 
by solar radiation) and the loss of energy which the transported air ex- 
periences in its course. The mixture of the air masses, which, without 
a "fnndamental circulation," must rotate with the velocity of the earth's 
surface upon which they rest, is accomplished by it in the course of a 
thousand years. I have used the mathematical idea of the sudden fric- 
tionless mingling of air layers at all latitudes only in order to determine 
in a simple way the condition of motion both with res))ect to direction 
and magnitude already jjrevailiug since a primitive period. Ferrel does 
not proceed, as I do, from a fundamental circulation which inter-changes 
the air layers rotating with their respective latitude velocities while 
moving forward and thereby gradually mixes them, but allows this 
mingling to be effected in a meridional direction by a frictionless dis- 
placement of the rotating rings of air at different latitudes, the reasons 
for which are not specifically given. This conception of the mode of 
mixtiue fnrnishes essentially the same basis for computation as mine, 
and Ferrel reaches tlie same results of comi)utation so far as the direc- 
tion of the wind currents is concerned. But, on the other hand, there 
exists an essential difference in our results for the relative meridional 
wind force at the latitude of 35°. 

The assum])tion of Dr. Sprung that neither of the two theories can 
be regarded as completely correct I wholly agree with. In fact I have 
never considered my theory in any other light than as a first approxi- 
mation to the truth. With this idea I have left out of consideration in 
my computation complicated influences, such as that of the decrease of 
temi)erature toward the poles and that of the non-coincidence of the 
dirc('ti(m of the centrifugal force with the force of gravity. The latter 
fact, whose action is also left out of consideration, that rotating air 
masses in higher latitudes must everywhere have the tendency to move 
forward in great circles, and thus tend to move toward the equator, 
would cause a decrease of air pressure as we approach the poles, and 
would consequently essentially impair the result of my computation of 
the mixing, if this tendency were not compensated by other forces which 
have an opposite effect. It is not these, however, but other assumptions 
of a fundamental character which mark a very essential difference be- 
tween the two conceptions and lead to results quite at variance with 
one another. In the first place, I refer to Ferrel's assumption that the 
so-called principle of areas, in the form of the conservation of the moment 
of rotation, applies to the displacement northward or southward of the 
air rotating with the earth's surface. I can not agree with this, and 
must enter my decided protest against the idea that the conservation 
of the moment of rotation is applicable to the movement of the air. 

The law of areas, borrowed from astronomy, means that a mass 
which moves fieely around another describes equal areas in equal

tiiiios. Tliis liai>i)eiis iu (jonsciiuence of the- acceleriitioii of the rotat- 
iu^- mass while approacliing tlie center of attraction of the fixed mass, 
and the correspondin<>- retardation which it experiences iji departing 
from it. The greater vek)city derived from tlie acceleration results in 
the description of a greater arc in a unit of time, and leads therefore 
to the laws of areas, l^ow, according to Ferrel, a mass of air rotating 
with the earth's surface in any latitude, when displaced northward or 
soulhwaid, can not, as I understand it, continue its course with its 
absolute velocity unchanged, as would be the case in the conservation 
of its vis vira, but its moment of rotation must remain constant, which 
corresponils to an important change of velocity. In order that the 
moment of rotation shall remain constant — which will be the case if 
the linear velocity of the rotating body changes in such a way that 
equal surfaces are describe<l by it in equal times — there must be ex- 
pended a considerable amount of energy in order to effect the change 
of velocity of the inert mass. But the force that could do this work 
is quite lacking. If we shorten the radius of rotation of a rotating 
solid mass, then the force Avhich causes the shortening unist overcome 
the centrifugal force. The sum of the products of all the centrifugal 
forces overcome by the ])aths traversed gives the work performed in 
accelerating the rotating mass, and this is sufficient to maintain the 
law of surfaces; that is, here the moment of rotation is constant. But 
in the motion of the air upon the earth's surface, no analogous relations 
subsist. In a tang(Mitia1 displacement on the earth's surface, no change 
ot gravity takes i)lace and no acceleration of the displaced mass by 
gravity. It is just as difficult to understand by what means a pres- 
sure upon them of neighboring air layers should arise for <lisplacing, 
which would be able to do the enormous work of acceleration that the 
conservation of the moment of rotation requii^es ! 

A displacement of the whole air mass of a rotating ring in a north 
or south direction is not ])ractical)le, since the volume of such a ring of 
given thickness changes with the cosine of the latitude. Thus in a 
jioleward displacement, a corresponding part of the mass of the ring- 
must remain behind — relatively, must return to the equator. But also 
for the imrtion of the ring of air actually displaced tow^ard the pole, no 
|>hysical reason can be found why the conservation of its moment of 
rotation must be assumed. On the contrary, this assumption would 
h'ad to the greatest contradictions and discontinuities; for, in the 
assumed original condition in which no meridional currents yet existed, 
from "hicli Ferrel as well as 1 have proceeded, the air rotated at each 
latitude with the vehu'ity of the ground upon which it was at rest. 
Tlie veloc'ty of the masses of air theiefore decreased with the cosine of 
the latitude NoA', with the ai)pearance of a meridional current, this 
relation, acco"ding to Feriel, wouhl not only have to be inverted, but 
instead of a decrease, an increase in the velocity of tlu' air must take 
place at a still h'gher rate, if the moment of rotation of the air is to

remain coustaut. lUit why this nnist remain constant and what force 
couhl ettect tlie enormous inc-remcnt of the vis viva stored ui) in the 
rotary air mass, remain eiinally incomprehensible.* 

I pass now to another assumption of Ferrel's, with which I cannot 
bring- myself to agree. It is this, /. e., that on an inclined surface of equal 
air pressure there can be a descent of the overlying air layers. It 
is just as impossible that there should be an impulse to tangential 
displacement on sloping isobaric surfaces as in the case of level sur- 
faces. That such a displacement could not possibly exist is evident at 
once from the consideration that a descending stream of air, in case it 
actually begins at any time, must immediately develop a change of 
pressure destroying the equilibrium, and must at once produce a return 
current. It results from this that a continuously progressive heating 
of the atmosphere, such as in reality (aside from disturbances) takes 
l)lace from the polar regions down to the equator, furnishes no possi- 
bility for a meridional circulation such as Dove also has assumed. It 
is possible, in such an unequally heated atmosphere, to dyaw at all 
heights isobaric surfaces extending from the equator to the poles, on 
which no voluntary air motion can originate. 

In spite of the great rarefaction by the heat of the torrid zone, the 
atmosphere would nevertheless remain at rest if no disturbance of the 
neutral equilibrium took place in any part of it. The neutral equilib- 
rium, with the adiabatic temperature gradient belonging to it, is the true 
condition of the equilibrium and of the relative rest of the atmosphere. 
This means that (apart from all friction) no expenditure of work is re- 
quired to bring a mass of air from -one height to another; that is to 
say, that the energy consumed in the expansion of the air under pres- 
sure finds its equivalent in the loss of heat by cooling, and vice versa. 
The general prevalence of neutral equilibrium in the atmosphere is 
therefore the cause of its state of relative rest, and every -disturbance 
of this equilibrium is of the nature of an accumulation of energy and 
has a tendency to cause currents in the air and thus to restore the 
condition of neutral equilibrium. The origin of these disturbances 
is to be sought exclusively in the unequal heating of the air strata 

*I must therefore decidedly object to the explanatory statement of Dr. Sprung, 
"that my assumption of the constant velocity of rotation of the air would be subject 
to the same error, or at least one very near to it, that vitiated the whole conception of 
Hadley and Dove as to the influence of the earth's rotation upon the motion of the 
air." Dr. Sprung quotes, quite improperly as a warrant for this opinion, the memoir 
by von Hemholtz "Upon atmospheric motions." Von Hemholtz in this mathemati- 
cal investigation has treated the hypotheti.cal case, viz: "If we consider a rotating 
ring of air, whose axis coincides with the earth's axis, and which is displaced either 
northward or southward by the pressure of similar neighborin^g rings, then, accord- 
ing to the well-known general mechanical principle, the moment of rotation must 
remii in constant." This is undoubtedly correct, since in thisassumed case the jjressure 
of neighboring rings does the work of acceleration, but the present question is this: 
Whether forces are demonstrably present which produce this displacing pressure? 



ON THE GENERAL CIRCULATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE. 183 

by solar radiation, and in their unequal cooling" by the radia- 
tion of heat into spacer The sohir radiation especially heats the 
earth's surface, and by means of .this, the lower air layers contiguous 
thereto. The excess of temperature thereby produ(;ed above the 
adiabatic grouud t(Mnperatui"e (which latter corresponds to tlvp average 
heating of the whole overlying air column), constitutes an accumulation 
of free energy, like that of a stretched spring, which can be brought 
into eciuilibrium again only by such a diffusion of the existing excess 
of temperature of the lowest strata upward through the entire overly- 
ing air column as shall restore the disturbed equilibrium. 

Practically this can only be done by means of air currents. In the 
case of a locally restricted overheating there will originate at any favor- 
able i)lace a bulging ui>ward of the overheated air, which then in- 
creases rapidly in height, since the upward thrust increases at a rate 
proportional to the height of the natural chimney thus formed. But 
ai»art from its height, this chimney is to be essentially distinguished 
from an ordinary one by the fact that it has elastic walls, and that the 
pressure and density of the air strata inside, as well as outside of it, 
diminish with height. Thus the air velocity during the ui)-rush in- 
creases in an inverse ratio to the density, since in every minute of time, 
an e(|ually great mass of air must jiass through every section of the 
chimney. Since, in consideration of the small height of the atmosphere 
as compared with the earth's radius, no increase of volume with the 
height need be taken into consideration, therefore, in general, the ve- 
locity of the air currents in ascending and descending must increase 
and decrease with the locally prevailing air pressure. 

I lence, also, in the case of an up-rush of air, more of the solar energy 
accumulated in it is transformed into the vis viva of moving masses of 
air tlian would be the case without such an acceleration. 

In the case of an up-rush of a limited mass of air overheated at the 
ground, the final result is a local uprush with accelerated velocity up 
to the higher, and even the highest, air regions, and sinuiltaneously a 
descent of the air strata surrounding the upward currents, with a veloc- 
ity diminishing during the descent, and finally a diffusion of the accu- 
mnlated heat at the earth's surface to all the overlying air strata, Avith 
a restoration of the disturbed neutral equilibrium of this i^art of the 
atmosphere. 

In essentially the same manner, but in its outward manifestation very 
ditferently, this restoration of the neutral equilibrium disturbed by 
solar radiation takes jdace when the overheating of the air strata 
adjacent to the ground extends over an entire zone of the earth. In 
this case the up-rush can no longer be locally restricted, but must sys- 
tematically surround the whole torrid zone. Neither can it be limited 
as to time, but the process of adjustment must continue just as long as 
the causes of disturban<'e. There nuist therefore? originate a circulatory 
system embracing the whole atmosphere, which finally performs the 



184 ON THE GENERAL CIRCULATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE. 

task of conveying the excessive lieat of the air strata adjacent to the 
ground in tlio torrid zone continuously to the entire atmosphere at all 
altitudes and latitudes, and thereby restoring, by a progressive circu- 
lation, the neutral e<|uilibrium disturbed in the torrid zone. 

If — with a consideration of the circumstance that the path of these cur- 
rents can not intersect, and of the further circumstance that the veloc- 
ity of the uprising currents must increase with the height in a ratio 
inversely jjroportional to the air pressure there prevailing, and tlnally 
of the circumstance that the air must retain unchanged the velocity 
it has once received, until it is destroyed by friction, mixture, or the 
work of compression, — one attempts to construct the possible paths of 
these currents, then he will necessarily arrive at the wind system as- 
sumed by m«, which rests essentially upon the inertia of the overheated 
air set in accelerated motion by the equatorial updraft. This inertia 
not only drives the accelerated air in the higher air regions toward the 
pok^s, I) ut it is also the cause of its return in the lower strata to the 
equator. 

It would lead me beyond the limited scope of this memoir were I to 
enter upon a more extended investigation of the inertia effects of this 
mass of air, or upon the partly modifying influence of aqueous vapor. 
But permit me to add a few words upon the development of the 
great local accumulations of energy which find exi^ression in maxima 
and minima of air pressure. The total air jiressure over all parts of 
the earth must be constant, since this integral represents the unchang- 
ing weight of the total mass of air. A local diminution of pressure 
must therefore be accompanied by an increase of pressure at other 
places. It is manifestly fruitless to seek the cause of areas of high 
and low pressure in the local condition of the atmosphere. These areas 
are frequently announced by the barometer long before any change in 
the condition of the atmosphere at the earth's surface has occurred. 
Only light streaks of cloud are frequently wont to betoken a change 
originating in the higher regions of the atmosphere. 

In my memoir, " Upon the conservation of energy in the earth's 
atmosphere," I have already removed the place of origination of areas 
of high and low pressure to the higher regions of the atmosphere. 
In these areas continuous changes of temperature and velocity take 
place which are derived from the place of up-rush of the air,— that is, 
from their ])revious temperature and humidity. If no change of sea- 
sons took i)lace, probably a greater regularity would prevail in the 
upper currents of the air, which then would also give weather rela- 
tions a definite sequence; such a sequence, u]) to the present time, 
has not been detected. We can not judge from what region the air 
comes which at any point of the earth's surface momentarily flows 
poleward at higher elevations. The temperature and velocity which 
this air has depends on the place of up-rush and on the season of the 
year. Now since the consumption of heat in the up-rising of the air, 



ON THE GENERAL CIRCULATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE. 185 

ami (;oiise(]ueutly in its coinpressiou under pressure, depends entirely 
on tlie degree of rarefaction produced, and upon the height of the 
ascent, then nearly the same diminution of temi^erature will take place 
in warm as in cold air. 

Tlie excess of licat which the air possessed before the uprush must 
cinitiiiue to pertain to the rarefied and cooled air, and hence, at all alti- 
tndes, temi)eratnre differences must exist of a magnitude similar to 
those at the snrface of the earth. 

I'roni this basis, the condition of the atmosphere in general will not 
be that of unstable, but of stable equilibrium, since the higher air strata, 
on account of their equatorial tendency, will be on the average warmer 
and lighter than the adiabatic temperature gradient of the place over 
which they are found, requires. The higher the excess of tempera- 
ture of the air before its ascent and the more vapor it contains, the 
greater must be tlie velocity which it acquires in rising. In the higher 
strata of air of miiUlle and high latitudes, relatively warm and there- 
fore liglit currents of nir of great velocity must alternate with the colder 
and slower flowing ones. 

Such a current of air, relatively light and warm, which takes entire 
or ])artial possession of the higher levels, destroys the neutral equilib- 
rinni of the lower strata. At the surface of contact of the strata, the 
lt»w(n' air which is relatively at rest must be under too great a pres- 
snrc. It must therefore expand and be carried along by the lighter air 
w liich flows rapidly above it. 

As von Helndioltz has shown, this process must go on with great 
energy under a wave form. The result must be an expansion and 
up flow of the lower air, which will cimtinue until neutral equilibrium, 
disturbed by the diminished pressure of the upper strata, is again 
restored. 

The inverse case will occur where the air ju'cssure of the upper strata 
is increased beyond the amtmnt belonging to the elevation, by reason 
of cooling and of l)acking up, resulting from the narrowing of the 
cnncnt with increasing latitude, hi this case there will be a settling 
<lown of the bounding strata, producing a condensation of the lower 
strata with a corresponding increase of pressure. Finally, in both 
cases, the disturbed neutral equilibrium must be restored through the 
action of upward or downward currents, by means of which the air 
strata lying beneath the sources of disturbance i)art with or take u]> 
air until neutral equilibrium is restored throughout the entire height 
of the atmosphere. 

In order to effect this, the air pressure of the lower strata must in- 
crease, or diminish until it becomes adjusted to the pressure gradient 
of neutral e«|nilibrium of the disturbing uj)per strata. That is to say, 
t he i)ressure at the earth's surface must change proportionately with the 
vaiiation of pressure at the elevation itself, whereby the surprising 
magnitude of the changes of pressure at the earth's surface find their 



186 ON THE GENERAL CIRCULATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE. 

complete explanation. This change of condition of the lower strata 
by this mode of adjustment will continue just as long as the causes 
of disturbance in the upper strata continue. Till then, areas of low 
pressure with rising currents or areas of high pressure with a down- 
ward motion must prevail and set the atmosphere over an ex- 
tended region into cyclonic motion. Not till the air current in the 
higher strata of the atmosphere has again reached its normal relations, 
will a mean barometric pressure and relative rest again prevail at the 
earth's surface. 

The theory of the general circulation of the atmosphere may now be 
summed up in the following principles: 

(1) All motions of the air originate in disturbances of the neutral 
equilibrium of the atmosphere and serve the purpose of restoring it. 

(2) These disturbances are brought about through overheating of the 
strata of air lying next to the earth's surface by solar radiation, by 
unsymmetrical cooling of the higher strata by radiation, and by back- 
ing up of the moving masses of air in case of the occurrence of resist- 
ances to the current. 

(3) The disturbances are compensated by rising air currents having 
an acceleration of such magnitude that the increase of velocity is pro- 
portional to the decrease of air pressure. 

(4) Corresponding to the upward currents are equally great down- 
ward currents in which a diminution of velocity occurs comparable 
with the acceleration in the case of the rising current. 

(5) If the region of the overheating of the lower air is a restricted 
one, a local ui)-draft sets in which extends up to the highest part of the 
atmosphere, and j^resents the phenomena of whirl pillars, whose interior 
consists of si>irally ascending currents and whose exterior is made up 
of similar spiral air currents directed downward. The result of these 
vortex currents is to diffuse the surplus heat of the lower air by which 
the adiabatic equilibrium was destroyed throughout all the overlying 
air columns which take part in the vortex motion. 

(6) In case the region of disturbance of neutral (or adiabatic) equi- 
librium is very extended, so as for example to embrace the whole torrid 
zone, then the equalization of temi)erature no longer takes place by 
means of locally uprising vortex currents; now these currents must 
form and encompass the whole atmosphere. 

The conditions of accelerated uprise and of retarded down-flow laid 
down lor the local whirl still hold good, so that the velocity of the 
air motion at different heights, develoi)ed by the energy of heat, is 
increased a])proximately in proportion to the air pressure there pre- 
vailing. 

(7) Since the whole atmosphere (in consequence of the continuous 
meridional circulation set up and maintained by the energy of heat) 
must rotate at all latitudes with approximately the same absolute 
velocity, the meridional currents produced by overheating unite with 



ON THK GENERAI< CIRCULATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE. 187 

tlu' tcnostrial current in tlic j^reat system of atniosplieric eircuhition 
embracing' the wlicle earth. This cireiihitiou serves the piiri)Ose of dif- 
iusing* upwards througli the whole atmosphere the excessive heat of 
the torrid zone, of carrying this equatorial heat and humidity to mid- 
dle and high latitudes, and of bringing about the development of 
lo(;al air currents at those parallels. 

(8) Tiie latter jthenomona take place as a result of the production of 
.alternating local increments and decrements of air pressure arising" 
from the disturbance of neutral equilibrium in the higher strata of the 
atmosphere. 

(9) Areas of high and h>w pressure are consequences of the temper- 
ature ami veh)city of the air currents in the higher strata of the 
atmospliere.

an<M's of the neutral eiiuilibrium of the atmosphere to be the most

THE GULF STIIKAM.* 



By Alexander Agassiz. 



The- (iiill" Stream is tlic best known and attlicsanio time the most re- 
niaikablo t'.\anii)le of the effect of oceanic circulation upon the distribu- 
tion of temperature in connection with tlie currents of the Xorth Athm- 
tic. It has loiii;- been known to j;e<>grai)hers that acold current coming- 
from (ireenland joins tlie Labrador current, and extends in a southerly 
direction ah)n<;- the eastern coast of the United States, while a warm cur- 
rent pouriu};- through the Straits of Florida flows in the opposite direc- 
tion t along the coast of tlu' southern Atlantic States, and is deflected 
from the banks of Newfoundland crossing the AMantic diagonally. 
This body of warm water makes itself felt along the west coast of tlie 
P>ritis]i IslaiMJs. iicncl rating even as far as the coast of Si)it7.bergen, 
and p('rliai>s beyond, to Nova Zend)la. It is impossible to dis(;uss the 
resnlts of the mor<' recent investigations of the Gulf Stream carried on 
by the Hhikc, ^\ith(»ut inchnling the general questions of oceanic circu- 
hition, ami of the thermal <-on(litions of the Atlantic in particular. I 
shall therefore bri<'l]y state such i»oints, derived from the explorations 
of the (li(flh'ii(/«'r and other expeditions, as will assist us in understand- 
ing tlie history and i)hysics of this great oceanic current. 

Sir (Jharles Lyell has called attention to the fact that in the present 
epoch the most nnirked i)hysical feature of the surface of the globe is 
its subdivision into a land and an oceanic liemisi)here. Thomson, like 
liim. looks upon the oceans as continuous, and has hajtpily styled the 
Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Indian oceans as great gulfs of the South- 
ern Ocean. 

Tlie striking hydrographic character of the North Atlantic is its com- 
parative isolation from the Arctic Ocean; the South Atlantic, on the 
contrary, is fully open to the cirvUilation of cold water coming from the

t Along tlid AiiH>rican coast the suddon transition from the green, cold, and more or 
less turbid water found along the coast and continental shelf, into the deep blue 
waters of the wann Gulf Stream, is one which has been noticed by all who have 
passed from tlu' shore seaward. This cold green water, which has such a chilling 
iutiuence on the <'limate of the New England States, follows the line of the Atlantic 
coast of the United States far towards th<' base of the peninsula of Florida.

Antarctic Ocean. The South Attantic is shut off from its northern area 
by the ridge extending from St. Paul's Rocks to Ascension, at a deptli 
of about 2,000 fathoms. The Challenger Ridge runs nearly north and 
south, leaving a free communication between tlie Antarctic Ocean and 
the eastern and western basins of the South Atlantic. The North At- 
lantic is subdivided into an eastern and western basin at a depth of 
about 1,500 fathoms by the Dolphin Rise, which follows in a general 
way the course of the S-sliaped Atlantic basin. Ridges separating the 
Atlantic from the Arctic Ocean extend across Denmark Straits, proba- 
bly at a shallow depth. From Greenland to Iceland the depth has an 
average of 500 fathoms ; from Iceland to the Fieroes, an average of about 
300 fathoms, and from there to the Orkneys, of not more than 220 fath- 
oms. From the configuration of the bottom it is evident that a larger 
amount of cold water must reach the tropics from the Antarctic than from 
the Arctic regions,* which are shut off from the Atlantic by submarine 
ridges. Over these and through the channels of Baflfln's Bay but a 
limited amount of cold water can find its way south. In the eastern 
Athmtict the x)rincipal cooling agent must be the cold water slowly 
flowing northward from the Antarctic between the Challenger Ridge 
and Africa. 

The shape of the northern extremity of South America, together witli 
the action of the southerly trades, is such as to split the southern equa- 
torial current, and to drive a considerable part of this southern current 
northward to join the westerly drift which flows to the northward of 
the Greater Antilles and Bahamas. The phenomena of oceanic circula- 
tion in their simplest form are here seen to consist of westerly currents 
impinging upon continental masses, deflected by them to the northward 
and eastward, and gradually lost in their polar extension. 

There is on the west side of the Nortli Atlantic an immense body of 
warm water, of which the Gulf Stream forms the western edge, flowing 
north over a large body of cold water thatcomes from the poles and flows 
south. The limits of the line of conflict between these masses are con- 

* The temperature line rnn diagonally across the Atlantic from Madeira to Tristan 
da Cunha by the Challenger brings out the remarkably shallow stratum of warm 
water of that part of the equatorial regions wliicli corresponds to the regions of the 
tradewinds both north and south of tlie ecjuator. The temperatures of the belts of 
water Vtetweeu 200 and 500 fathoms north and south of the line plainly show that the 
colder water found south of the equator can not come from the warmer northern belt 
of ihe same depth, but must come from the colder belt adjoining the equatorial re- 
gion. In other words, the cold water may be said to rise towards the surface near 
the equator; and from tlie temperature of the two sides of the North Atlantic it is 
also evident that the supply of cold water flowing from the Antarctic into the At- 
lantic is greater than that coming from the Arctic regions. This vertical circula- 
tion, characteristic of the equatorial l)elt, is insignificant, however, when compared 
with the great horizontal oceanic currents. 

t In the Pacific the amount of cold water flowing into it through the narrow and 
shallow Bering Strait is infinitesimal compared with the mass of cold water creep- 
ing uorthward into the Pacific gulf from the ilepths of the Southern Ocean.

staiitly <'li:ingiu<;-, according" to the seasons. At one time the colder 
water from Davis's Straits spreads like a fan near tbe surface, driving- 
the Gulf Stream to tlie east,* and at another, large masses of warm 
water exteiid towards tlie Faroe Islands, with branches to\vard Iceland 
and the coast of Portugal. 

An examination of an isothermal chart of the Atlantic clearly shows 
the effect of the isolation of the Northern Atlantic, the area of maxi- 
ma ni temperature {S2°) extends over a far greater space in the North 
than in tlie South Alantic. The Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean be- 
come greatly su])erheated in September (ro above SQ'^), the effect of this 
superheating in conjunction with the westerly equatoiial drift being 
seen clearly in the northerly extension of the isothermal lines. In the 
South Atlantic,t owing in i)art to the greater regularity in the shape of 
the basin, the difference in the extension of the isothermal lines is but 
little marked. 

The temperature sections of the Challenger, from Teneriff'e to S(mi- 
brero, show remarkably well the great contrast in temiDerature between 
the eastern and westtMii basins of the Atlantic, which are separated by 
the Doli)hin Rise. In tl;e eastern basin the cold water on the bottom 
is su])plied by the indraft from the South Atlantic, while the warmer 
surface water of the western basin is due to the westerly equatorial 
curicnts. We seem, therefore, to hav(^ masses of water of different 
temi)eratures a(jcumulated at certain points by surface or bottom cur- 
rents, to be distributed again, either north or south, into the generjil 
oceanic circulation, thus restoring the equilibrium disturbed by the un- 
eipial distribution of heat and cold on the surface of the ocean. 

Another temperature section (Fig. 1), which I shall borrow from the 
Challetuier soundings, to complement the work of the BlaJce in the same 
regions, is that which extends irom Halifax to the Bermudas, and thence 
to St. Thomas, The temperatures observed by these vessels show 
plainly the path of the warm surface water, Avhich flows outside of the 
West India Islands, and joins the Gulf Stream proper, whose waters 
when united are banked against the cold Labrador current in its course 
along the American coast. 

Undcmbtedly, the early observations made upon the temperature of 
the ocean were defective, owing to the somewhat imperfect instruments 
at the disi)osal of the early ex])lorers; yet they determined the general 
position of the cold and warm currents of the ocean along our shores. 



*Th«> direction from which the currents come is plainly shown by the nature of the 
hotloiu specimens, miulo up in part of globijieriujB brought by the warmer southerly 
surface currents, and in part of northern foraraiuifera and of volcanic sand derived 
from Jan Mayen and Spitzbergen. The dividing lines between these deposits njay be 
considered as the boundaries of tbe arctic current where it passes under the Gulf 
Stream. 

f Tlie ]):nallelism of temperature is also very marked in the S<nitli Tacitic, where 
there are no disturbing influences. (See J. J. Wild, Thalmm, (pi. xv.) and Chal- 
hiKjer Temperutui"es.)

The more systematie work of the officers of the Coast Survey first 
proved the existence of vast bodies of water, of considerable thickness, 
and of very dilierent temperatures at corresponding- depths, movin^ jn 
opposite directions. It is to tlie Coast Survey that we owe the denion- 
sti'ation of the fact that the waters of the polar regions pour into the 
tropics along- the bottom, just as the warmer equatorial waters flow 
across the temperate zones near the surface, and make their influence 
felt in the polar regions. 

The submarine ridges interrupt the flow of these cold polar waters, 
and form the so-called closed basius, with a higher bottom temperature 
than that of the adjoining oceanic basin. The effect of such ridges 
upon the bottom temperature was first traced by the soundings of the 
Forvupine in the North Atlantic and in the Mediterranean. Subse- 
quently the Ghallenger discovereil several such inclosed seas while 
sounding in the East Indian Archipelago. 

The correctness of these results has been confirmed by the Coast 
Survey, from soundings in the Caribbean and in the Gulf of Mexico; 
their bottom temperature (at a depth of over 2,000 fathoms) is exactly 
that ('^Op) of the deepest part of the ridge, at about 800 fathoms, which 
separates them from tiu^ oceanic Atlantic basin, \vith its temperature 
of 3(io at the depth of 2,000 fathoms. 

The presence of thick layers of water having a higher bottom tem- 
perature than that of adjoining areas would indicate the presence of 
ridges isolating these warmer areas from the general deep-sea oceanic 
circulation. A map of the Atlantic, made entirely with reference to 
the temperatures, would correspond to a remarkable degree with the 
topography of the bed of the ocean, and show how and where the breaks 
in the continuity of the circulation, both for the arctic and antarctic 
regions, occur in the Atlantic. 

It was not however until the Miller-Casella thermometer came into 
general use for deep-sea investigations that a degree of accuracy before 
unattainable in oceanic temperature became possible. It soon was a 
well-recognized fact that as we go deeper the temperature diminishes, 
and that at great depths the temperature of the ocean is nearly that 
of freezing. In 18G8-'69, in the Faroes Channel, the Porcupine found 
a temperature of — 1.4° C. at a depth of 640 fathoms, and a tempera- 
ture of 0° C. at .lOO fathoms, this being a southern extension, as was 
subsequently found, of the deep basin of 1,800 fathoms lying between 
Norway ;ind Iceland. The same temperature, 0.9° C, occurs under 
the equator at a depth of about 2,300 fathoms, while 5° C. is found at 
a dei)th of 300 fathoms. As early as 1859 the Coast Survey had re- 
coi'ded in tlie Strails of Florida a temperature of 40° F. (4.4° C.) at a 
depth of 300 fathoins, while at the surface the temperature was 80° F. 
(26.7° C.). Beyond 1,000 fathoms the temperature diminishes very 
slowly. The ClKdlciigcr also found a temperature somewhat below zero 
off the Rio de la Plata, at a deptli of about 2,900 fathoms.

THE GULF STREAM. 



The temperatui'e of tlie oceanic 
basin depends upon the depth, the 
latitude, the currents, and the sea- 
sons ; that of mediterraneans (land- 
locked seas) is controlled by other 
causes, which will be more fully dis- 
cussed when we come to treat of the 
temperature of the Caribbean and 
of the Gulf of Mexico. The constants 
are the depths and latitude, while the 
disturbing elements are represented 
by the varying atmospheric and oce- 
anic currents and the seasons.* The 
effects of seasonal difterences of tem- 
IDerature do not extend to great 
depths, yet act with sufficient power 
greatly to modify the force and vol- 
ume of the oceanic currents. As a 
general rule, the temperature dimin- 
ishes from the surface toward the 
bottom, a belt limited in depth (al)out 
150 fathoms) alone, being subject to 
variations due to the action of the 
sun. Below that the temperature 
generally decreases Avith the depth, 
until we reach the body of water of 
which the temperature may in gen- 
eral be said to be uniform (about 

3r,o).t 

As exi^lanations of the oceanic cur- 
rents, we have first the gravitation 
theory, which looks upon the differ- 
ences of temperature and of specific 
gravity of the water at the equator 
and poles as the prime cause of oce- 
anic circulation; next, Thomson's 
theory, according to which the differ- 
ence in evaporation and precipitation 
between the northern and southern 
liemispheres causes a conserpient 
heaping up of water in the south- 

* Dr. J. J. Wild has given in '' Thalassa " an excellent diagram, showing at a glance 
the general relations of the temperature in the liquid envelopes to the earth's crust. 
It is here re-produced (Fig. 2), slightly modified. 

t As currents sink, as soon as their temperature falls below that of adjoining waters, 
and as the temperature diminishes from the surlace toward the bottom, as well as 
from the equator to the pole, a comT)iuation of these varying elements may produce 
a somewhat complicated circulation.

ern lieniisplicie, which soiitli of latitude 5.0° is completely covered by 
water; thirdly, the theory which attempts to account for the circulation 
by the vis inertia' of the equatorial waters; and, lastly, the theory which 
considers the trade-winds and other prevailing winds as the principal 
causes by which oceanic currents are produced. Franklin, Humboldt, 
licnnell, Sir John Herschel, and Croll have supported this view of the 
origin of o(;eanic currents. 

Of course, until the extension of the frictional effect ol' winds to great 
depths has actually been measured, the last theory, plausible as it may 
appear, lacks its final demonstration. It is by no means proved, be- 
cause tliere is an apparent connection in time between the periodic va- 
riations of the currents and of the trade- winds, that we must seek in the 
latter the only cause for the existence of the former. The presence of 
the Guinea Stream, the i)osition of the regions of calms in the north- 
ern and southern hemispheres, the diminishing force of the trade- winds 
as we apjjroach the equator, the rise of the colder strata of water to 
shallower depths in the equatorial than in the temperate regions, are 
phenomena which the action of the trade-winds alone does not seem to 
explain. Why may not oceanic circulation, like the movements of our 
atmosphere, be dependent upon cosnn'c phenomena, practically inde- 
])endentof any secondary causes, and modified by them within very 
narrow limits? 

The diffeience in salinity of certain oceanic districts is in itself insuffi- 
cient to explain oceanic circulation; so that while the secondary causes 
referred to above are undoubtedly active as producing more or less ex- 
tensive local circulation, we seem justified in looking upon the differ- 
ences of temperature of the ;^ones of the ocean as the ])rincipal cause of 
the general oceanic circulation. We may state, in the main, that the 
density of the ocean water is least at the equator, gi-adually rises 
toward the poles, and attains its maximum at 00° of latitude. For 
the sake of convenience we may call* the density of the ocean as one at 
a depth of 500 fathoms, and consider the strata of water above and be- 
low as having a less and a. greater density,* Avithin very narrow limits; 
thus the watery envelope is not in a state of equilibrium. 

The most important disturbing factors of a uniform distribution of 
oceanic temi»erature are the continental masses which lie in the path 
of the <M[uatorial currents. A comparison of the ])()sition of the 
oceanic isotherms of the North and South Atlantic shows a striking- 
contrast in their course north and soutli of the e(juator. A similar 
eoniparison between the .Vtlantic and Pacific brings out plainly the 
contrast in the c<mrse of the isotherms of two oceans, fn which the 
disturbing eflect is due in the one to continental masses and in the 
other to large groups of oceanic islands.

\^Q THE GULF STREAM. 

:Perhap.s the best example of the unstable equilibrium existing be- 
tween adjoining oceanic areas is furnished by the heaping up of the 
waters driven by the trade winds into the Gulf of Mexico from the 
Caribbean. The amount of this accumulation has actually been meas- 
ured by ofKcers of the United States Coast Survey. It gives an addi- 
tional force at work to keep up the efficiency of the Gulf Stream. The 
Gulf of Mexico is considered by Mr. Hilgard as an immense hydro- 
static reservoir, rising to the height of more than 3 feet* above the 
general oceanic level, and from this supply comes the Gulf Stream, 
which passes out through the Straits of Bemini, the only opening left 
for its exit. 

Arago, Lenz, and Leonardo da Vinci befin^e them, maintained that, 
since the Avater of the equator Mas greatly heated and lighter and 
attained s? higher level, there was a flow of the surface waters towards 
the poles, a compensation being established by the flow of lower strata 
from the poles to the equator. The principal features of this thermic 
theory have of late found their most efficient exponent in Dr. (Carpen- 
ter. The results of his experiments to prove this theory upon a small 
scale seemed to show that the cooling of the waters at the pole and 
their rapid fall were a more efficient force than the heating of the 
water at the equator. F<'rrell has called attention to the phenomenon 
that cold water at the bottom will be swung more to the westward than 
the water at the top, which will be turned in an easterly direction. As 
the particles of water ascend, they retain the velocity they had in 
deeper parts of the ocean, and thus, when reaching either the surface 
or lesser depths than their original position, they must sliow themselves 
as producing a westerly current. This current, deflected by the con- 
tinental masses as it strikes the east coast, Mould then be set in motion 
towards either the north or south ])ole. At the equator, the water 
which flows westward from the eastern shores of the continental masses 
can only be replaced by the compensating Avaters floAving to it from the 
north and south. This circulation fairly agrees with the phenomena 
observed in the South and North Atlantic. 

It is interesting to trace the gradual development of our knowledge 
of the Gulf Stream and to see how far-reaching has been the influence 
of the oceanic currents upon the exiilorations of maritime nations, and 
the eftect these have had in their turn on the discovery of America 
and its settlement.! The hardy ISTorse navigators, nearly five hundred 
years before Columbus, sailed along the eastern shores of Greenland 
and America, and extended their voyage possibly as fur south as Nar- 
ragansett Bay, folloAving the Labrador current, which swept them along 

our eastern shores. It was well known to navigators that upon the

M-ostoin sliores of ]S^nway and tlic uoitlierii coast of (Jieat r>ritaiii 
driftwood of iiuknowu timber and seeds of ])laiits foreiiiii to the tein- 
perate zone were oceasioiially stranded, coniiu'^ liom shores where 
l>i'ol>al)ly no Enropean had as yet set foot. 

The Portuguese navigators, sailing \vest, came beyoud the Canaries 
to an ocean covered with seaweed (the gulf-weed of the Sargasso Sea), 
through which none dared to ])ush their way, and the problem of the 
" Sea of Darkness" remained unsolved until the time of Cohnnbus. He 
possibly was familiar with the traditions of the voyages of the Norse- 
men and undoubtedly had access to more or less accurate information 
regarding the Atlantic, ac(;unuilated previous to his time in the ar- 
chives of Portugal and Spain or circulated among the sea folk of that 
day, and this information included legends of lands to the west. Co- 
lumbus started under the full ixnsuasion that he could reach the lands 
from which the remarkable products bnmght by the currents had 
originated. When he came into the region of the northeast trades 
and found himself swiftly carried westward, not only by the winds, but 
also by a current moving in the direction of the trades, his return 
seemed very hazardous, imless he could strike upon that opposite cur- 
rent whi(;h had borne the trees and seeds to the northern coasts of 
Europe. 01)liged by the trades to take a northerly course on his way 
home from llispaniola in 14!)3, he came upon the region of variable and 
westerly winds, with a current setting in the same direction. Colum- 
bus was thus the tirst to introduce the circular sailing course which, 
uj) to the present day, vessels sailing from the West Indies to Europe 
are compelled to take. They come before the wind with the trades, 
make the Windward Islands, and, sailing northward, find their way 
through the Windward oi- the Mona Passage, until they reach the belt 
of variable and westerly winds, when they steer toward the European 
shores again. 

After reaching the Mexican coast, Columbus, by one of his broad 
generalizations, practically discovered the Straits of Florida, arguing 
that it must have an outlet into the Atlantic and that he would thus 
escape the tedious voyage in the teeth of the northeast trades, which 
would be his lot if he attempted to find his way home by the usual 
route of the Windward or the Mona Passage. In 1519, an expedition 
inspired by Alaminos was dis])atched by (xaray, governor of Jamaica, 
to follow the easterly current running along the northern shores of 
Cuba. The expedition, however, did not succeed in passing to the 
eastward of Cape Florida. 

An accurate knoMledge of the currents and winds enabled the free- 
booters of the sixteenth century to carry on their depredations with 
impunity, and their successors, the wreckers of the Florida reefs and 
IJalianias, nia<le use of their intimate knowledge of the coasts and of 
the winds and currents to obtain commercial advantages, not always 
by the most honest methods. With the mapping of the reefs by the 



198 THE GULF STREAM. 

Coast Survey all this has disappeared, and the lighting of the great 
highway of the Straits of Florida has reduced to a minimum the dan- 
gers of navigation, though the Tortugas are still a favorite resort, even 
in broad daylight, for old ships properly insured. 

The cai)taiii of one of the Spanish vessels was carried south, off the 
coast of South America, by the current which sweeps from Cape St. 
Eoque along the shores of Brazil, and involuntarily discovered the Bra- 
zilian shore current. Though these different currents were known to 
exist in the Atlantic, the most crude notions of their origin and course 
prevailed. (Fig. 3.) According to Columbus, at the equator the waters 
of the ocean moved westward w ith the heavens above, rolling over the 
fixed earth as a center. It was only in the seventeenth century that 
physicists began to suspect a connection between the currents aud the 
rotation of the earth, a view afterwards maintained by Arago and Hum- 
boldt. 

The first scientific basis for the exploration of the Gulf Stream was 
undoubtedly due to Franklin. At the time he was Postmaster-General 
of the colonies, his attention was called to the fact that the royal mail 
packets made much longer passages to and from Europe than the trad- 
ing vessels of Massachusetts and Khode Island. On talking the mat- 
ter over with Capt. Folger, of Nantucket, he first learned the existence 
of a strong easterly current, of which the New England captains took 
advantage in going to Europe, and which they avoided by sailing a 
northerly course on the home voyage. Folger also called Franklin's 
attention to the fact that this current was a warm one.* He and Dr. 
Blagden becoming interested in the question, Franklin set out to ascer- 
tain the size of the current and its temperature. Soon after, Franklin 
published the first chart of the Gulf Stream (Fig. 4), for the benefit of 
navigators, from information obtL-ued from Nantucket whalemen, who 
were extremely familiar with the Gulf Stream, its course, strength, and 
extent. 

From the time of Franklin until the problem of the Gulf Stream was 
again attacked, in 1845, by Franklin's descendant, Prof. A. D. Bache, 
of the United States Coast Survey, many ingenious theories were 
published, but nothing was added to our knowledge of the origin and 
structure of the Gulf Stream. Humboldt, Arago, and others attempted 
to trace in the Gulf Stream a secondary effect of the trade-winds, and 
of the rotation of the earth. The officers of arctic expeditions sent to 
Spitzbergen did not fail to see the effect of a mass of warm water 
passing northward, and Yon Baer was among the first to consider this 
body of water as an eastern extension of the Gulf Stream. Meanwhile 
the arctic explorers of Bafiins Bay and western Greenland found them- 
selves bafded in their efforts to reach high latitudes by the powerful 



* It was noticed by Lescarbot, in 1605, that far north there was a mass of warm 
water moving toward the east, and that both north aud south of it the water of 
the Atlantic Avas cooler.

THE GULF 8TKEAM. 



201 



Tilt; earlier work of the Coast Survey in its investigations into tlie 
structure of the Gulf Stream (1845 to 18G0) consisted in making- sec- 
tions across the stream, from the Straits of Bemini as far north as the 
latitude of Nantucket. From the studies of Craven, MafRtt, Bache, 
and 1 )avis were developed the so-called cold and warm bands, believed at 
that time to be the principal characteristic of the Gulf Stream. The 
accompanying- map {Fig. i>), published in 1 800 by the Coast Survey, 
will serve to illustrate the structure of the Gulf Stream as it was then 
understood; namely, as a succession of belts composed of warm north- 
erly currents llowiiig side by side with a cold southerly current, or of 
a cold southerly current which had found its way under the warmer 
northerly currents. These alternating belts had no definite position, 
the size of the colder bands and warnier belts being dependent, the one 
u])on the force of the arctic current, the other upon that of the tropical

current, increased in breadth and volume beyond the Bahamas by the 
whole of the warm belt of surface equatorial water, which is deflected 
northward by the Windward Islands, instead of forcing its way through 
the passage between the Windward Islands, the Mona and Windward 
jtassages, and the Old Bahama Passage.* 

* Great as is undoubtedly the effect of the Gnlf >Strcam proper (Fig. 6) in incr'eas- 
iug tlie toinperature of tlie water in northern latitudes siibject to its influence, we 
must not forget to add to it that of the greater mass of lieated water which is forced 
north, and finds its way to the northernmost shores of Siberia, losing in its passage 
(lie heat it has accumulated within the tr<)])ics. So that, while we can not say that 
the Gulf Stream has disappc^ared, and has been replaced off the Banks of Newfound- 
land by the equatorial drift, neither can we attribute to the Atlantic drift alone the 
masses of warm water Couud in tlic liasin of the northern part of the North Atlantic. 
(See Figs. 1 au<l 6. ) 



202 THE GULF STREAM. 

Cominaiidei- l>artlett found no warm or cold bauds, no distinct cold 
wall, and no bifurcations in the surfac(3 waters till lie came off Hatteras. 
Near the shore the current was greatly iiitluenced by winds. The 
work of the Blalcc seems to show that the cold bauds, so called, which 
figure so largely in all early descriptions of the Gulf Stream, have no 
regularity, and only represent at any given moment the unceasing con- 
flict going on between layers of water of different Aclocities and of dif- 
ferent temperatures. Such a conflict is perhaps the well-hnown rip 
we encountered off' Charleston, which may be caused by a stiuggle be- 
tween portions of the Labrador current passing under the Gulf Stream. 
As the isotherms rise and fall with the irregularities of the bottom, 
where water accumulates or piles against ridges, hot and cold bands 
may be flowing one above the other. We need however more pro- 
longed observations to show how far belo\\ the surface these bands 
extend. Commander Bartlett, from the last Coast Survey investiga- 
tions under his direction, is inclined to consider the cold bands of the 
Gulf Stream as quite superficial.* 

A cold current striking against a warmer stream that is flowing iu 
the opposite direction may split it into more or less marked hot and 
cold bands. Bands similar to those of the Gulf Stream were observed 
by the Challenger in tlie Agulhas current off" the Cape of Good Hope, 
and off Japan in the Kuro Si wo. 

It is of course difficult to ascertain the i)art taken by the trade- winds 
in originating the oceanic circailation of the Atlantic. That winds 
blowing steadily from one quarter give rise to powerful currents is 
well known, and it is not difticult to imagine the prominent part the 
trades must play in setting in motion, in a southwesterly and a north- 
westerly direction, the mass of water over which they sweep so persist- 
ently on each side t»f the equator. 

The change of currents in the Indian Ocean due to the shifting of 
the monsoons is well known. How far below the surface this action of 
the winds reaches, is another question.f Theoretically it has been cal- 
ciilated by Zoeppritz that one hundred thousand years is ami)le time to 
allow the friction of the particles to extend from the surface to the bot- 

* In sailing from Halifax to the Bermudas, Sir Wyville Tliomsoii speaks of passing 
alternate belts of cold and warm water. Early in the morning of the 22d of May, 
the surface water was of a temperature of 11° C. ; at midniglit it had fallen to 12^ 
C, to rise again half an hour later to over 15^ C. Tims, from the time the Challen- 
(jer left Halifax with a surface tempex-ature of 4° C, graduallj' rising to 10° C. until 
she encountered the Gulf Stream proper, marked by a rapid rise of temperature, she 
passed through alternate belts of warm and cooler surface waters varying between 
18° C. and 23° C. 

tThe movement arising from the action of the winds on the surfiice is transmitted 
by friction from one layer to another and communicates the velocity of the upper 
particles to the underlying layers iu succession. If this is coutinued long enough, 
the velocity of the lowest layers will equal within a fraction that of the upper layer. 



THE GULF STREAM. 203 

torn, say to 2,000 fathoms, were the wiuds to l)h)w without intermission 
in one direction during tliat time, with tlie average power they are 
known to])ossess,* 

We may imagine the Avhole of the mass of the Atlantic within the 
belt of the trade winds to be mo\ing in a wester]}' direction and im- 
i»inging ni)on the continental slojje of Soutii America,! and upon 
tlie ^^'in(lward Islands, at which ]»oint it is deHected either in a south- 
erly or northerly direction or forces its way into the Caribbean. In 
our piescnt state of knowledge it is ditlicult to trace the path of the 
e(inatorial water as it is forced into the eastern Caribbean. Com- 
mander Bartlett supposes that it is warmed in the Caribbean by circu- 
lating round th«^ whole basin. The water which is swept into the 
Caribbean by the trade winds through the passages between the Wind- 
ward Islaiuls and, being then driven into the Old Bahama (yliannel 
funnel, flows through the Windward Passage, represents a far greater 
mass than that which can find its way into the Gulf of Mexico through 
the Straits of Yucatan or that of the stream flowing north thronghthe 
Straits of Bernini. This is the actual Gulf Stream, a body of super- 
heated water tilling the whole straits; it has an average depth of about 
SoO fathoms and a ^•clocity extending to the bottom of at least 3.| miles 
an hour. I 

The section of tlie Yucatan Channel is too small to allow for an out- 
HoAV equal to the intlow into the Caribbean,§ so that, after the trades 
have ceased to force the equatorial water into the Caribbean basins, it 
must remain there a considerable length of time before it passes into 
the Gulf of Mexico, where, owing to similar differences between the 
rate of intlow and (mttlow, the water must still become more super- 
heated. 

We must therefore consider the Gulf Stream i)roper, as it emerges 
IVom tlie Straits of Bemini, as an immense body of super-heated water 

" It is therefore possible that curreuts which owe their existence to causes that 
have heeii modified to a certain extent should still exist in the ocean long after the 
tonditions producing them (acting from the surface) have ceased to be effective by 
any break of continuity duo to the interposition of islands or of banks in the track 
of oceanic currents. 

iDid till' (Julf Stream not meet coutiiiciiral masses, it would sim])ly cxi)aud north 
and south, lo.-siug its initial velocity, and gia;lually cool down towards the poles, 
the cold jienetrating all the d(!ei)er portions of the ocean, just as \v<^ (ind it reaching 
tlie higher summits that rise above the line of ])eri)etual snow. 

{Current observations taken by Mitchell otf the coast of Cuba, in tlic deep i)art 
1)1' the (Julf Stream, show tliat it has a nearly uniform and constant velocity for a 
<lcpth of 600 fathoms, although the tem])erature varies 40*-' F. 

i^S A part of this water emerges again at a higher tem])erature between Guade- 
loupe and Haiti and joins that portitm of the ecjuatorial cuncnt wliiidi finds its way 
into the Windward Passage. This increased tcnipcratiininay be due to its pass- 
ing over shoals and banks at tbc northeastern end of the eastern basin of the

204 THE GULF STREAM. 

retaining' an initial velocity which originated in lower latitudes, then 
losing- both its N-elocity and its heat on its way north.* 

The Straits of Florida have a width of about 48 miles between Jupi- 
ter Inlet and Memory Eock ; the greatest depth is 439 fathoms, and the 
cross-section 430,000,000 square feet. At three knots, the delivery would 
be, as calculated by Commander Bartlett about 436,000,000,000,000 
tons a day, an amount of warm water fiir less than we find over the 
North Atlantic, which, as has been shown, is derived from the western 
set of the equatorial current, joining the Gulf Stream in its way towards 
Euroi^ean shores.! (See Figs. 1-6.) 

Commander Bartlett thus describes the general course of the Gulf 
Stream : 

^' The Gulf Stream has for its western bank the 100-fathom curve as 
far as Cape Hatteras. It has a depth of 400 fathoms as far as Charles- 
ton, where it is reduced to 300 fathoms; but the Arctic cnrrent has for 
its western bank the 1,000-fathom curve, which is quite close to shoal 
water from the George's Bank to Hatteras. 

" The average surface temperature in the axis of the stream rarely 
exceeded 83° F. in June and July. On one or two occasions the ther- 
mometer read as high as 86° and once 89° ; but it was at high noon in 
a dead calm. The temperature at 5 fathoms did not range above the 
average of 81^°. 

" The increase of temperature of the surface was found as we entered 
the current. - - - 

" The surface temperatures did not indicate a cold wall inside of the 
stream and the water inside of the 100-fathom line to the shore seemed 
to be an overflow of the stream, as the temperatures to 5, 10, and 15 
fathoms were nearly as high as those found in the stream. 

" The temperatures at the bottom in the stream, at corresponding- 
depths, were the same as those found in the Windward Passage, and 

* Between Halifax and the Bermudas, the section of the Gulf Stream observed 
by the Challenger was cooled 1° C, as compared with that of the Bermudas to 
New York. The Gulf Stream retains its heat as a surface current as long as the 
temperature is sufficiently high to make it lighter than the surrounding water. 
Its greater salinitj^ causes it to sink below the comparatively fresher water of 
northern latitudes. Similarly, the Arctic current, when it reaches a certain latitude 
along our eastern coast, sinks from its greater specilic gravity below the warmer 
surface currents and continues its Avay south as an undercurrent of cold water. 

+ It might, perhaps, be advisable to distinguish between the eastern extension of 
the Gulf Stream, combined with the Atlantic drift, and the Gulf Stream projier, un- 
derstanding by the latter the water which passes through the Florida Straits. 
This has been called by Petermann the Florida Stream ; and the name of Gulf Stream 
has been ap^ilied to the vast body of warm water which super-heats the basin of 
the Eastern Atlantic to the eastward of 45° west longirude. There seems to be no 
reason for changing the name of the Gulf Stream bcciiuse so many other liberties 
have been taken with it. We should retain the original name, limiting it to the 
Florida Stream coming from the Gulf of Mexico and applying to its eastern extension, 
in connection with the Atlantic easterly drift, some new name, such as Equatorial 
Drift or the Caribbean Stream.

in the course of the <un«'iit to tlie Yucatan Passage. The average 
bottom temi)eratiire at KK) fathoms was 45°, and, as off Charleston,* in 
300 fathoms, 53°. The temperature at 300 fathoms, off the George's 
Bank, was found in July to be 40°; and this last was the temperature 
that we found at the same depth just north of Hatteras and the Gulf 
Stream. 

" 1 have stated that the surface temperatures did not show a cold 
wall inside the stream; but the bottom temperatures give a narrow 
cold section close to tlio 100-fathom curve all along tlie course of the 
stream from Hatteras to Florida. Soon after leaving the Straits of 
Florida there is a division of the stream shown by the bottom temper- 
atures, part following the coast and the remainder branching off to the 
eastward. - - ■ 

"We found that 3 knots was a general average to allow for the whole 
stream. This would give a greater velocity at some central point. Be- 
tween the Bahamas and Florida the average was exactly 3 miles per 
hour; but for a distance of 15 miles in the axis of the stream it was as 
high as 5.4 miles per hour. To the northAvard of the Bahama banks, 
and to the eastward of the stream, there was a slight current setting 
southeast. We found the direction of the current in the stream very 
much affected by the wind, sometimes inclining it to the east, then to 
tlie M'cst.t 

"In the latter jxirt of June, 18S1, we were hove to, some 50 miles east 
of the Gulf Stream, oft' Charleston, where we experienced a current of 3 
miles per hour, setting southeast; wind blowing a gale from southwest.^ 

"The sudden rise of the plateau off' Charleston, together, probably, 
Aviththe meeting of the arctic and warm currents, creates a remarkable 
disturbance at this point. - - -

t Inshore of the Gulf Stream, though a southerly current was distinctly traced, in- 
side the 100-fathoni line, yet the temperature of the water towards the shore was 
liut little cooler than that of tlie stream itself; the same is found to he the case if 
we examine the temperature sections of the eastern edge of the tiulf Stream. The 
stream itself seems to he mainly characterized hy its velocity and hy its color. 

tOn the southern side of the Gulf Stream Connnander Bartlett ohserved immense 
nuantities of gulf-weed; this is also blown into Narragausett Bay in considerable 
•inautities, covered with clusters of lloatiug barnacles. 



206 THE GULF STREAM. 

"We crossed tlie stream six times in this locality, under conditions 
of weather from a calm to a strong breeze, and always crossed, near the 
center of the stream, bands of rippling water several miles in width. 
It is very like the rip at the entrance to Long Island Sound." 

The Grulf stream flows at the rate of about one-fourth of a mile an 
hour through the Yucatan Channel, which is 90 miles wide and over 1,000 
fathoms deep. Through the Straits of Bemini it has a velocity of from 
4 to 5 knots, a width of 50 miles, and an average depth of 350 fathoms. 
This velocity rapidly decreases as we go north. Off St. Augustine 
it is rarely more than 4 miles; from there to New York it decreases 
to 2^ miles per hour; off the banks of Newfoundland it is reduced to 
1^ or 1 miles; and at a distance of 300 miles to the eastward the velocity 
of the Gulf Stream, which has constantly been spreading out fan- 
shaped, is scarcely perceptible. 

As far as the current observations of the Blake may be trusted, they 
indicate a greater speed in the axis of the Gulf Stream than along its 
edges — a velocity varying between 2 miles an hour, or even less, and 
fully 5 miles. The width of the stream off the east coast south of Hat- 
teras varies from 50 to nearly 100 miles. 

The observations of the Blake show that the bottom of the Gulf 
stream along the Blake Plateau is swept clean of slime and ooze, and 
is nearly barren of animal life. 



OI^ THE ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF HARDNESS.* 



By F. AUERBACH. 

Translated by Carl Barus. 



Hardness, aside from its j)ractieal importance, is one of the most 
remarkable i)ropertie>s of solid matter. This is shown at ouce by the 
ditlflcnlties whieh have been encountered in the endeavor to arrive at 
an accurate interpretation of it. Indeed, the attempts to solve questions 
relatin.n' to hardness are of very great variety, and are exceptionally large 
in number, and they have in a measure led to some interesting results; 
but the subject in its broader bearings has not yet been attacked with 
success, nor has a rigorous definition of Iiardness been established. 
Problems which present themselves in dealing with any of the physical 
pro])erties of a body niay usually be divided into three sub-problems: 
The first aniong these includes the scientifically exact description of the 
conception in question, so that the property may henceforth be treated 
as a i)urely mathematical variable. Then this quantity is to be meas- 
ured, and methods and apparatus must be devised for that purpose. 
Finally, the measurements are themselves to be generalized by being 
extended to as many bodies under as many different circumstances as 
possible. At the outset, however, it is by no means necessary that the 
procedure adopted should be so simple as to be of immediate j)ractical 
utility. As a rule this will only be attained at a much later stage of 
the research. The chief aim at the beginning is to work forward from 
some theoretically perfect basis, and-to so fashion the methods that the 
end in view may be reached with a reasonable degree of accuracy as 
well as certainty. To within a few years none of the three sub-problems 
which I have mentioned can be said to have been vsolved. To Hertz 
belongs the credit of being the first to push the question to an issue. 
His ingenious reasoning is particularly fortunate, inasmuch as it har- 
monizes the general conception of hardness and the earlier definitions 
Avhich were given of it in all essential and necessary points and to the 
exclusion of errors of principle and vagueness. Taking Hertz's con- 
clnsions as a point of de])arture, I believe T have solved the second of 
the sub-i)roblems, and in the present paper submit a method, which (with

the exception of a siQj;le point as yet in need of further ekieidatiou), 
seems to lead to satisfactory results, both from a theoretical and a 
practical point of view. My paper is therefore divided into the follow- 
ing parts :

^S 8. The measurement of the elasticity and the hardness of certain sub- 
stances. 

Witli reference to the last I will state at once that the data are given 
solely with the object of evidencing the ntility and accuracy of the 
method. Tliey show to what degree the second sub-problem has been 
solved. Systematic work relative to the third sub-problem, as well as 
many investigations which the present paper suggests or implies, I have 
reserved for future communications. 

I. A REVIEW OF THE EARLIER WORK. 

Eelative to the definition and the measurement of any physical 
quantity like hardness, the observer may proceed from three points 
in view. He may only wish to find out wliether the hardness of any 
given body is greater or less than the hardness of another given 
body; and he may therefore be satisfied with a typical series, any mem- 
ber of which is conventionally harder than the preceding and softer 
than the succeeding body. The elements of such a series may even be 
numbered; but the numbers are obviously not significant quantities. 
Furthermore, if even these members are reliable it is clearly to be 
shown (1) whether if J5 be harder than A, A is always necessarily less 
hard than B; (2) if when G is harder than B and B harder than ^1, C 
is always harder than A. In the case of many physical properties these 
conditions do not hold, or do not hold at least for all substances; and 
it is, therefore, not generally possible to classify bodies in a scale of the 
kind in question. Only after these fundamental conditions have been 
fixed in principle, is it permissible to make the second step, namely, to 
replace the more or less arbitrary members in the scale of hardness, by 
data which actually measure the property, and which therefore, for any 
two bodies, will express the hardness ratio. The scale so obtained is 
relative, and the term of comparison conventionally chosen. Thus, for 
instance, the hardness in a given definite body may be taken as the unit. 
But here again it is necessary to reflect that the data- may ditTer not only 
as to their jictual value, but in tlieir relations, de])ending as they must 
on the experimental method by which they were obtained. Only the 
final or absolute method is, therefore, always satisfactory, for here the 



ON THE ABSOLUTE MEASUREMKNT OF HARDNESS. 209 

hardness ofeachsubstauoe is expressed, irrespective of other substances 
and without reference to a normal body, in terms of the fundamental 
units of physics. 

Tlie method of rating- hardness by scratching is best known and 
most generally applied. One body is liar<ler than another, if. a i^oint 
or sharp edge of the former is capable of s(;ratching" a plane over face 
of the latter. Of the two conditions which make an arbitrary scale 
possible in this case, the first is approximately given, to the extent 
only that the differences of hardness to be rated are in any two bodies 
marked. If this differences is small, it is usually found that a sharp 
edge of either will scratch a plane surface of the other. It is custo- 
mary to refer this discrepancy to the sensitiveness of the method. 
The two bodies are liatly pronounced equally hard, and since the sec- 
ond of tlie conditions a])ove given is also borne out by all the cases 
hitherto testeil, a rough scale of hardness is thus feasible. The first 
investigator who made use of such a scale, Hauy, confined his work 
to four steps. They were limited by calcite, glass, and ([uartz. Mohs 
increased the luimber of steps to ten, and although later mineralogists, 
believing some of the steps disproportionately large, have inserted 
intermediate degrees, the oNlohs scale has in general been retaine<l to the 
present day. Indeed the justice of this is apparent, for in view of 
the absence of any means of even approximately defining the relative 
values of the su(H'essive degrees, all attempts to reduce them in size 
would, in the long run, rather be productive of error than of increased 
accuracy. 

The first attempt at measurement was nmde by Frankenheim,* who 
estimated the hand pressure under which a given hard point or stylus 
leaves a scratch on the surface to be tested. But instruments by which 
this pressure or the depth of penetration of the stylus is actually regis- 
tered were not invented till nuich later. They are due, respectively, to 
Seebeck.t Franz.t (Irailich and Pekarek,§ F. Exner,|| Pfaff,1] Turner,** 
ami others, and have been called ''sklerometers." The results obtained 
by these forms of apparatus, as Exner himself admits, are not of the 
nature of measurements, for all true measurements of an unknown 
(juantity determine the latter by inclosing it between well-defined 
limits, and it is by the distance apart of these limits that the accuracy 
of tlie method is conditioned. Sklerometers however are cai)able of 
furnishing' only an upj^er limit. The lower limit is left to conjecture.

210 ON THE ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF HARDNESS. 

Seebeck's ouly advance on Frankenlieim is a transfer of jndginent from 
the liand to the eye, the latter being confessedly more skillful in mak- 
ing estimates. At best, however, the method thus established en- 
counters the following serious disadvantages. In the first place, the 
results obtained depend on a variety of minor conditions, foremost 
among which is the nature of the material out of which the stylus is 
made. Steel is uiost generally used, but steel can not be exactly 
defined, and therefore tlie observer has no right to assume that his 
stylus is a body of fixed proi)erties. Moreover, the necessity of using 
both hard and soft steel in the apparatus introduces a further compli- 
cation, but, as a matter of fact, when a hard steel stylus is applied to a 
soft body the pressure under which the stylus moves must be reduced 
below the limit of measurement, whereas hard bodies are only scratched 
by hard steel. Franz used both a steel and a diamond point, and 
endeavored to co-ordinate the results of the two by measuring the 
harduess of a given suitable body in terms of each stylus. It is true 
that the numbers obtained in the two series of experiments show a 
constant ratio {cccf. par.), but it does not follow that this would always 
be the case, and it is quite improbable for large intervals of hardness. 

The second difticulty encountered is the dependence of the results of 
the sklerometer on the degree of sharpness of the marking stylus. None 
of the above papers touch upon this matter, nor would it be possible for 
them to estimate this effect. Yet it is quite obvious that the pencils of 
different apparatus can not have been identically sharpened, and that 
the pencil of the same apparatus will soon become blunted by continued 
use. Measurements into which this serious discrepancy necessarily 
enters cannot therefore be comparable among themselves. Finally, 
the modus operandi, the velocity of the moving stylus and the direc- 
tion of the i^ressures are to be considered, and in some of the above 
papers hints relative to these points (motion, position, and inclination of 
pencil) are explicitly given. Barnes and Perlsin, however, first showed 
that the effect producible by varying the rate of motion of the stylus 
is so great as to be actually capable of inverting the data for hardness. 
Indeed, it has since become well known that the edge of a rapidly rotat- 
ing, relatively soft disc is scarcely touched by a tile or a lathe tool, and 
that if the motion be rapid enough, it is the tool which sutters most. 
Nor is this phenomenon to be referred to an effect of temperature, for it 
finds its full explanation in consideration with the rates of motion to 
which it is due. The hardest cast iron can be turned off with a steel 
tool at a velocity as high as 2 meters per second of the moving parts. 

I am thus naturally led to the important question, whether the defi- 
nition of hardness given by the sklerometer is correct in principle. I 
believe this is by no means the case. Quite aside from the serious prac- 
tical difficulties which I have just summarized, it seems to me that 
harduess when determined by scratching is much too complex a concep- 
tion to be used as a basis for the definition of the property. Compli-

cations are iutrodueed by the luotioual plieuomeiia, the lateral sheer 
which accompanies scratching-, and in short by conditions which have 
nothing to do with hardness at all. It is easy to imagine how the 
method oiigmated, for the tests mnst primarily have been made to find 
ont \Ahether the point was capable of puncturing the surfac*; but 
inasmuch as a puncture is not easily recognized, the passage was made 
from the i)oint to the scratched line. The static method is, in fact, much 
older than the dynamic method of rating hardness. If therefore the 
static method is sufficient (and this will be shown below) to define hard- 
ness as a characteristic, independent, and clearly intelligible property 
of bodies, it is worse than superfluous to introduce processes by which 
the result can only be complicated. 1 do not mean to imply, of course, 
that the method of scratching has been fruitless. It has conquered its 
own ground. Thus, for instance, the gradual change of hardness at 
points within a given surface of a crystal is among the striking accom- 
plishments within the reach of the method; but we can only arrive at 
a clear knowledge of the meaning of such observations after having 
solved the static problem of hardness and then noting the additional 
circumstances introduced, when we pass from the dent to the scratch, 
llegarded as [)ractical method of quiet interpolation, scratching nuist 
retain a value wdiich can only be enhanced by giving clear interpreta- 
tions to the nature of the process, and the discrepancies which I have 
])ointed out * need not then be apprehended. 

Under the circumstances I am inclined to regard it as a step in the 
right direction, that the static method (static because motion is 
excluded) has recently again been taken up by a number of observers. 
Among these Crace-Calvert and Johnson, Hugneny,f Eottoue,J and also 
rfaff§ may be mentioned. In this class of api)aratus a hard point is 
pressed or struck or drilled into the body to be measured, and the hard- 
ness is variously measured relative to given depths of penetration. 
This may be done l»y noting the weight necessary to sink the stylus or 
by the luunber of rotations of a definitely weighted needle (Pfaff's me- 
so sklerometer). Again, the depth to which the stylus sinks for a. given 
weiglit or even the time necessary to produce a given depth of impres- 
sion have been used for i*egistry. Here however it is clear at once 
that these methods are intrinsically different, and that far-fetched 
assumptions must be nnide relatively to the proportionality of hardness 
witli the divers data obtained, — assumptions which need not even be 
ai)proxinmtely true. Furthermore, the body to which these different 
tests are applied is necessarily acted on in a state of strain, if not ac-

measurement the body necessarily differs from the original body. Thus 
it appears that the results of such methods are not available. 

With the object of corroborating" the above remarks I will exhibit two 
typical jrieries of data from the papers of Franz and of I'tafif (the latter 
obtained by means of the meso-sklerometer already referred to), choos- 
ing such substances as are sufficiently definite for comparison. In the

Mere inspection of the table shows that the ratios of hardness* 
run as high as 15 in the first table, and fluctuate between 2.2 and 0.2 
in the second. 

It has already beeu stated that Hertzt investigated a definition of 
hardness which is mathematically exact, and which does not conflict 
with the prevailing notions of the quality. He replaces the indefinite 
point by a definite .spherical surface; or, to state this more correctly, 
since the point is after all a spherical surface of very small radius. 
Hertz uses a stylus with a radius of curvature large enough to be 
measurable. Moreover, the material out of which the stylus (now a 
ball) is to be made, virtually does not at all enter into the problem. A 
body may therefore be tested for hardness by aid of a. probe made of 
its own substance and the result is in no way dependent on vague 
properties of a foreign body. Finally, the body to be examined is not 
subjected to any permanent strain (set), but all operations are con- 
ducted within the limits of elasticity. The definition of hardness 
thus obtained takes the following general form: Hardness is the limit- 
ing elastic resistance (tenacity) of a body, in case of contact of one of 
its plane surfaces with the spherical surface of another body, thus 
all vagueness of conception lias been removed, and hardness is tersely

ticular to determine Low pressure is distributed and varies within the 
surface of contact, for upou these conditions tlie effects of stress and 
the resistance of the material will dcjiend. The solution of this problem 
has enabled Hertz* to proi)ound a fundamental i)rinciple. Jn his 
attempt to verify his theory experimentally TFertz was however nuu-h 
less successful, and as a consequence soon abandoned th(^ work. The 
only data which he adduced refer to glass, and his results for hard- 
ness were :

Thus the data obtained are not satisfactorily constant. Moreover, 
my results show that not more than the third or fourth part of the dis- 
crepancies observetl are referable to the material. ])iflferences, there- 
fore, necessarily renuiin. It would be inexpedient to attemj)t to account 
for them here, chieHy because the number of experiments made is much 
too small relatively to the conditions (form, material, stress, impact, 
etc.), under which the results were obtained. Nor has Hertz given a 
sufliciently detailed statement of the dimensions of the bodies exam- 
ined. 

II. THEORY. 

The pressureless contact between a sphere and a plane is a point. 
J f pressure be applied at the center of the sphere, normally, l)oth sur- 
faces will change form near the point in question, until the strain has 
reached a given value. In other words, the sphere will be flattened 
and the plane curved, and the original point is now replaced by a sur- 
iace of contact. I shall call this the impressed surface or area (Druch- 
Hiiche). It is neither plane nor of the curvature of the sphere; but the 
radius will obviously lie somewhere between these limiting values, and 
will depend {c(vf. jxir.) on the elastic properties of the two contiguous 
bodies. Furthermore, under the conditious stated, the impressed area 
is clearly circiuu scribed by a circle. 

If pr»\ssure acting ncn-mally through the centei- of the sphere is 
increased the impressed surface will also increase in size, and the pres- 
sure is now brought to bear on a larger surface. But the strain to which 
thematerialis])ut will depend on the stress ]>er unitof impressed surface, 
and we are thus led to incpure as lo the law compatible with which the 
pressure per unit of area increases with the total pressure, for ob- 
viously both magnitudes must increase sinuiltaneously. It is also 
easily seen that the iclntion between total pressure and pressure per 
unit of the impressed surface is closely allied with the relation of total 



*Hertz: Crelle's ,A(/n((((/. 1SS2, vol. xcii, ]). 156. 



214 ON THE ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF HARDNESS. 

pressure to the increase of the impressed surface or area of contact, 
ISTow Hertz's theory shows the radius of the latter to increase proi)or- 
tionally to the cube root of the total pressure applied, and hence the 
impressed area will increase as the two-thirds j)Ower of total pressure. 
To this degree, therefore, the effect of total pressure is abortive; and in 
view of the enlargement of the impressed area stress per unit of area 
increases only as the cube root of the total stress. Furthermore, the 
manner in which i)ressure is distributed throughout the surface of con- 
tact is fully given by the theory. It is found that at any given time 
pressure decreases gradually from the center of the area towards its 
boundary where stress is necessarily zero, in accordance with the 
expression 

where ;c is the fraction of the total radius of the impressed area by 
which any of its points is symmetrically located relatively to the cen- 
ter. The reference roughly made above to pressure per unit area is, 
therefore, of the nature of a mean value; and the maximum pressure at 
the center of area is related to the mean value here in question in the 
ratio of 3 to 2. ISTow if the total pressure at the center of the sphere is 
gradually increased, the maximum pressure per unit of area at the cen- 
ter of the impressed surface will also continually increase; and at a 
certain value one of the two bodies, or both (supposing them to be made 
of the same material), will necessarily reach the limits of elasticity. 
Evidence as to whether this has occurred or not is uot far to seek; in a 
plastic body the strain will be permanent. There will, in other words, 
be an evidence of " set," for the parts affected fail to return to their 
original positions when the stress is relieved. Furthei-inore, in a brittle 
body, set will be actually accompanied by rupture at tlie parts too 
highly strained. We may therefore in all instances conclude as follows : 
The least value of the {central) incssnre per unit of area necessary to pro- 
duce permanent set {or rupture) at the center of the impressed surface is 
Hertz's datum for the hardness of the body under examination. In 
addition to the normal pressures every ])oint of the area of contact is 
also actuated by lateral pressures, and it is quite feasible to obtain 
some general notion of their value. At the center of contact they are 
positive, *. e., the body is uniformly compressed, whence it follows that 
in our method of testing a crack is not to be looked for here. The case 
is pronouncedly different near the boundary of the area, where the lat- 
eral stresses are all negative and of the nature of tensions; and since 
the loci of like stresses are circles concentric with the center of area, 
we may look for a circular line of rupture. 

Thus far our considerations were only extended to a system of two 
given bodies in contact. The question arises how the condition will 
change if the original system is replaced by a second system differing 



ox THE ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF HARDNESS. 215 

in any manner Avhatever IVoni the former, Tlio variations possible in 
such a case are twofohl: (1) Tlie spheres may ha\ c difterent radii, and 
(2) the bodies may have different elastic constants than those which 
obtained in the first experiment. Tlie theory of the experiment shows, 
witli regard to tlie first of these points, that (other things being equal) 
the radius of the impressed area is proportional to the cube root of the 
radius of the sphere, or that the area of the surface of contact varies 
as the two-thirds power of tlie radius. For the case of equal total 
pressures at the center of the latter, the pressure per unit of area, and 
hence also the maximum jU'essure in the impressed surface, must be 
proportional to the cube root of the curvatures of the sphere. To the 
Extent, therefore, in which all reference is made to the stated central or 
maximum pressure (per unit of area), the data for limiting values of 
elastic resistance must be independent of the curvature of the impress- 
ing sj)here. Hence the limiting value of total pressure is i^roportional 
to the square of the limiting or final radius of the area of contact; or, 
if the radius of the latter is exi)ressed in terms of the total pressure 
and the radius of the sphere by aid of the above relations, then the 
value of total pressure, just sufficient to produce set, must increase with 
the square of the radius of the sphere. In regard to the second of the 
abov^e queries, no special fnention is expedient here. I will only remark 
that under conditions which are otherwise identical, the area of con- 
tact is expressible in terms of values of the elastic constants of the two 
contiguous bodies. To avoid this complication, I will at the outset 
confine myself to the state of things observed when both bodies are 
identical as to material. For this case the relations to be formulated 
admit of simple expressions. 

It may be worth while, by way of recapitulation, to express the laws 
just enunciated symbolically. Let /> be the radius of curvature of the 
sphere in millimeters, p the total pressure applied at its center, P its 
superior limit, i. e., the value ol }) at tlie time of occurrence of the per- 
manent set. Let^^ibethe pressure per unit of area at the center of 
the impressed surface, i. e., the maximum of pressure in kilograms per 
square millimeter. Pi the superior limit of 2h, 'i- c-, the absolute hard- 
ness of the body. Let d be the diameter of the area of contact (this 
(piality is immediately given by observation, and is in so far preferable 
to the radius embodied in the above text), D the superior limit of d, 
both in millimeters. Let S be the true hardness, which, as will be 
shoMii in the sequel, differs slightly from the theoretic value Pi, q an 
abbreviation of the (piotienit pd'^, ^j> its limiting value. Let /be the 
area of contact, F its limiting value, both in square millimeters. Fin- 
ally, let E be the modulus of elasticity of the material in kilograms iier 
square millimeter, /< Poisson's coefficient, /. c, the ratio of radial con- 
traction to longitudinal extension, E' an abbreviation of the quotient

III. METHOD. 

It appears from the foregoing equations that to compute hardness 
by aid of the phenomenon of contact between a sphere and a plane of 
a given body the total pressure under which contact takes place is to 
be increased up to the elastic limits. The time of yielding being

sbarply marked by the occurrence of eitlier permaueut set or of rup- 
ture at the area of contact, it is merely necessary to measure the total 
pressure 7' and the diameter of the impressed area D for the time 
in question. Tlie iirst of the equations (4) then leads at once to the 
value of theoretical hardness. In the interest of accurate work, how- 
ever, it is unfortunate that the two quantities P and 7) can be meas- 
ured but once. It is therefore desirable to introduce some variation of 
metliod at least for />, for P does not admit of a second expression. 
For this purpose the other two equations given under (4) are available. 
One of them (the second in order) xji'emises a knowledge of both E^ 
and ft, as well as of P. Xow, although p may be considered sufficiently 
given by the radius of the spherical stylus, J5J', on the other hand, 
would have to be taken from tabulated data of E and //, or be prelim- 
inarily measured by aid of a special piece of the given body. Neither 
of tliese alternatives is acceptable, while /i is known to vary even with 
insignificant structural differences of the given substance, and can not 
even be considered constant for different parts of it. On the other 
lumd, the third in order of the equations (4) is useful in every particu- 
lar. Based as it is on the values of P and q=p/(P only, its availability 
is enhanced by the fact that the q is constant, and can therefore be taken 
from a whole series of measurements of increasing j;. Far from being 
dependent on a single measurement, therefore, the observer is at liberty 
to reject the limiting value Q altogether; for if it should differ from 
the other values q, an explanation is readily found in the fact that Q 
is measured Avhen '• set " has already occurred. The additional labor 
involved in a step-for-step increase of P is of no moment, seeing that 
such procedure is under all circumstances necessary. For the limits 
of elasticity must be gradually approached and not overstepped. 

I have already stated that brittle bodies present a case of easy obser. 
vation, for here set is accompanied by rupture. Only in rare instances 
is this criterion preceded by a visible indentation without break of con- 
tinuity, and a puncture of this kind can usually be referred to a lack 
of homogeneity in the material or to anomalies of brittleness. Hence 
I found it advantageous to begin my work with brittle bodies, and the 
general method was devised with special reference to the fact that 
nearly all such bodies, in j)articular the glasses and the greater number 
of crystals, are more or less transparent. 

The spheres in these experiments are suitably ground in the form of 
a i)lano-convex lense, with a radii of curvature of 1 to 30 millimeters. 
The plane surface is preferably a plate, about 11.6 millimeters in diam- 
eter and 8 millimeters thick. The thickness is purposely chosen of 
tlie same order of magnitude as the diameter, in order that any dis- 
crepancy of the nature of flexure may be excluded from the start. The 
plate is fixed in position while the lense is free to move ui) and down, 
and pressure is suitably transmitted by a lever actuated by a set of 
weights. The area of contact and the occurrence of the indentation are

to be observed, of course, for an iiivarial)le liosition of the plate and lens 
with reference to the liorizontal, and the measurement is made through 
a microscope with its line of sight normal to the plate, seeing that the 
lengths to be taken are small. In the field of the microscope the im- 
pressed area appears in form of a dark circular sj)ot, which, together 
with the rings surrounding it, presents a case of interference. I shall 
show that even the diameters of the rings are available for measure- 
ment. Further particulars however are best discussed in connection 
with the apparatus. 

lY. APPARATUS. 

Through the kind permission of Prof. Abbe, the apparatus was 
constructed in the workshop of M. Zeis, of Jena, and 1 desire in this 
place gratefully to acknowledge the suggestions received from my col- 
leagues, in particular from Prof. Abbe, during the course of its con- 
struction. Fig. 1 shows the completed instrument in sectional eleva- 
tion, nonessential parts having been withdrawn for clearness. It is 
put together massively, so as to withstand the powerful stresses which 
are to be brought to bear on it, and it is firmly planted on a pier in one 
of the vaults of the university. Ample provision is made to guard 




against tremors. The cast-iron bedplate G G' is T-shaped in cross 
section, 73"'" long and 7.5^='" wide, and a central gutter runs from end 
to end. 

The supijort T, screwed to the bedplate, is provided above by a re-en- 
trance t, in which the knife edge D, around which the wrought-iron lever 
H H' is free to turn, is suitably adjusted. The short arm of H H' ter- 
minates in a ring-shaped expansion I /', at a mean horizontal distance of 
about 5"" from the axis D. In the conical perforation in / 1' a plug Z 
fits snugly and the lens L is attached to the top of Z. The other arm 
of HH' is about ten times as long as the short arm, and ends in the 
knife edge c. The glass plate p, to be tested, is attached to the upper 
X)erforated plate o o', secured by means of a pillared arrangement, of

whicli ,S' is alone visible iu the li/^inrc. Tlie ])late o o' is about 1 .0"" thick, 
and its lower face is flush with tlu^ correspoudiiim face of 7>. The whole 
case can l)c moved in the ••utter of the bedplate, and clamped iu any 
position by aid of the strong" screw Si. If is, therefore, easily possible 
to ]ilace a part of the glass plate p opposite the vertex of the test lens 
L. The microscope ^1/ is similarly movable, and tlie clamp screw aS'2 
admits of an adjustment relative to the point of contact to be observed. 
It is expedient to fasten the lens L to the top face of the plug Z with 
cement. The plate 7>, however, exactly fits the hole in o o', and adjusta- 
bly liinged stoi)s prevent it from falling out. The microscope M con- 
tains an ocular micrometer w?, and since illumination from below is 
ch^arly impossible, the light of a lateral gas flame F is reflected down- 
ward by the prism n, small enough to only lialf flll the right section of 
the tube. After impinging on the lens and plate, the rays are reflected 
upward through the oi)en half of tlie tube and the micrometer m^ finally 
reaching the eye of the observer. The long arm of tlie lever H' abuts 
against the screw ^1, and its play may, therefore, be stopped short 
high en«mgh to prevent all premature contact between the test lens 
and i)late. When A is screwed <lown, moreover, the long arm would 
much overbalance the weight of the short arm //. To obviate this a 
duplicate wrottght-iron arm ^V has been added, along the free end 
of which a -weight w' may be adjusted to couiiter])oise the long arm. 

The form given to W is such that the center of gravitj^ of the 
lever as a whole is not seriously depressed, and a balance sufticiently 
sensitive for the present purposes is thus secured. The counterpoise 
iv' is to be fixed so tluit the position of equilibrium may leave a little 
space between the test lens and the jilate. Little rings r surrounding 
the pin q are then added until an almost pressureless contact is initially 
obtained. However slight, a true contact is always easily recognized 
by the x>assage of the colored iuterference rings into a black spot. In 
order that this initial contact may easily be reproduced, and the prog- 
ress of an experiment may at any time be checked, a second lever 
7v' A', supported by the pillar U near the end of the bedplate, is at 
hand. A stirrup B^ from the hook of which scale pans of difterent 
sizes may be suspended, suitably connects both levers (knife edges c 
and c', as shown in figure). By a play of the screw B the 7i end of 
tlic lever maybe depressed and t\\Q K' arm raised. In this way the 
stirru]) is lifted oft" of the knife edge c, and the lever H' is therefore 
unloaded. Conversely an opposite play of the thumbscrew B depresses 
A'', and the load is therefore transferred from the knife edge c' to the 
knife edge c, whereby the lever is loaded, gradually or expeditiously, 
at pleasure. These adjustments enable the observer to carry out the 
necessary operations smoothly, and without any danger of jarring or 
striking the parts to be tested together. The elasticity of the long 
lever, moreover, is in favor of a perfectly uniform and sIoav intensifica- 
tion of the pressure to be a];)plied. It was my plan to return to the

p'ressureless contact, after the effect of each of the successive step loads 
had been brought to bear, and thus the load corresponding to the occur- 
rence if an indentation in p was indicated with certainty (see below). 

V. GENERAL REMARKS ON THE OBSERVATIONS. 

Apart from special methods of research the general plan of the ex- 
j)eriments was as follows: The plate and lens are first carefully to be 
freed from dust, grease, moisture, etc., and then to be screwed into 
their respective places at the center of the plate o o' and at the top of 
the plug Z as securely as possible. The screw stop A is lifted high 
enough that the plate case o o s may be pushed over the lens with- 
out danger of touching it. Then the miscroscope is adjusted and all 
parts eventually clamx)ed in i:>lace with reference to the particular part 
of the glass plate where the test is to be made. It is expe<lient to 
clamp /S'l fi^rst, and then to clamp ^2 in such a way that the i^oint in 
question may occupy the middle of the field of view. During these 
operations it will have been necessary to gradually lower the stop J., 
thongh not quite as far as the position of contact. This is best done 
when the microscope is fixed. Under these circumstances, however, if 
the lever H H' should not swing freely, the long arm H' is presumably 
too heavy, and ic' must be moved further outward along the slide (a 
little weight r being added if need be) until the pressureless contact 
occurs, when the lever swings freely. This adjustment may actually 
be made to an accuracy of about 1 gram, a degree of sensitiveness far 
in excess of the demands. 

The load is now applied, beginning with the stirrup B as the first 
centerpoise. The screw B, which has thus far stood low, is raised until 
the load is carried simultaneously by c' and c. B is then raised very 
gradually^ however, until the load B has been quite transferred from 
KK' toH H', the observer availing himself meanwhile of the elasticity 
of the long lever. Indeed it is possible to raise B so uniformly that 
the area of the spot seen in the field of the microscope scarcely en- 
larges, so that the strain is imparted to the plate at a very slowly 
increasing rate. Should the weight of B (227s) be regarded too large 
as a first stej), smaller weights maybe attached with a string. Having 
read off' the first diameter of the ring and noted the first load, the large 
lever is unloaded and the scale pan attached to the hook of the stirrup 
B. Then the lever H H' is again loaded in the manner described, 
and the value of the diameter of the spot read oft' for the second load. 
This process is repeated as often as desirable, with the single addi- 
tional precaution that when the limits of elasticity are being gradually 
approached (determined from preliminary trials), the weights are added 
to the scale pan in smaller steps than at the outset. Eventually, there- 
fore, the values P and /) (load and spot diameter) which correspond to 
rupture are obtained. The method described has many advantages; 



ON THE ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF HARDNESS. 221 

the observer can proceed with Lii« work snioothly and without annoying 
accidents; for the weights are added by a method of manipulation 
which is wliolly without disturbing influence on the test plates, etc. 

Theoretically, however, the method is not altogether free from objec- 
tions, inasmuch as the impressed surlace is continually loaded and un 
loade<l, and therefore put through a series of increasing cyclic strains, 
until the final point of rupture is reached. For this reason I made 
sjtecial sets of measurements, in which the loads were added gradually 
with every available i)recaution, of course, but icitliout passing back to 
the pressureless conta<-t at the end of each step. J!fear the end of the 
operation I carefully clmrged the scale pan with sand, pouring it in so 
gradually that the increase of the load was practically continuous. 
These exjteriments led to some interesting subsidiary facts; but as they 
<lid not change the chief issue with which wearenow concerned, 1 need 
only accentuate the remarks already made, that it is never permissible 
to increase the load (quickly, not even at the beginning of the work 
when the loads are all small. In all such cases rupture is liable to occur 
prematurely, and the discrepancy is frequently of serious moment. 

In addition to the corresi)onding values of p and f7, P and I), other 
quantities were usually observed, such, for instance, as would be neces- 
sary for corrections, etc., and feu* the ultimate purposes of this research. 
1 always noted the diameter of the Newton rings, as well as the diam- 
eterof the locus of rupture. As to the latter I may here remark (definite 
researches will be published elsewhere) that in case of isotropic media 
it is in fact a circle and concentric with the areaof C(mtact; yet it does 
not coincide with limits of this area, but surrounds it in accordance 
with a Avell-defined law. For crystals the locus of rupture is not cir- 
cular, but an intermediate figure between a circle and a polygon (hex- 
agon, rhombus, triangle, etc.). 

A few words on the diameter of the spot are in place here because 
of their bearing on the accuracy of measurement. 1 found by trial that 
the demarcation was sharpest in case of faint illumination, for in this 
case the light was not annoyingiy reflected from the upper face of the 
test plate. In general this definition varies in marked degree in differ- 
ent experiments, and even different parts of the edge of a given spot 
are not equ ally distinct. Usually, however, 0.7 scale part of the microm- 
eter is guaranteed. 

From an economical standpoint it is fortunate that a single plate and 
lens will outlast many experiments, certainly as many as are necessary 
for obtaining a sharp average of results. The lens is not usually af- 
fected, but retains its even surface indefinitely. The ])late is large 
enough for upwards of 30 or 40 fields of rupture on each of its sides. It 
is advisable to rule the side of the i)late which is not to be used with a 
set of rectangular cross-section lines. Curi(msly enougli, the divers cir- 
cles of rupture do not seem to interfere with each other, even when 
they are nearly contiguous, or when the loci actually intersect. 1 found 



222

by trial that the vahies obtained in the hist instance were more abnormal, 
bnt I did not use them. Fig. 2, supplied to corroborate these state- 
ments, represents the available part of the plate. It contains fully 28 
indentations, varying in size because lenses of different curvature were 
used, but it appears at a glance that there is room for many more experi- 
ments. 




VI. THE CONSTANTS AND SOURCES OF ERROR. 

The two chief constants of the apparatus are the scale value of the 
ocular micrometer and the ratio of the arms of the prime lever. The 
former was obtained in the usual way by comparing it with an objective 
micrometer. In my final and most accurate comparisons a tenth milli- 
meter scale was inserted in place of the plate p. Thus I found 

27 scale parts = 1""'> 

with a deviacun near the edges of tlie field presently to be discussed. 
In view of the form of the lever the ratio of the arms could not have 
been measured accurately by a direct method. Hence, I replace the 
plug Z by another containing a pin, on which a strong scale pan hang- 
ing in the main below the bedplate G G' could be pivoted. Observa- 
tions made for equilibrium between the new pan and the stirrup E 
(weights being suitably a(hled to the former) showed the ratio in ques- 
tion to F= 9.8, with a probable error of dt 0.01, i. e., only about a 
tenth per cent of the value of T'. It follows, therefore, that all measure^ 
ments in terms of the ocular micrometer are to be divided by 27, and 



ON THE ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF HARDNESS. 223 

the observed load at tlie end of the lever (including of course the weight 
l)otli of the stirrup R and the pan) is to be multiplied by 9,8. Thus 
the values of spot diameter and total pressure are reduced to absolute 
units. 

The third class of constants are the lens curvatures, jjurposely 
varied in different experiments, I did not attem])t to find them, how- 
ever, for I was able to avail myself of the values of the mechanician in 
cliarge, who, in addition to tlie chief datum, also supplied mo with 
the errors probably made in their manufacture. These errors never 
exceeded 0.1""", and were even smaller than this for smaller cur\atures. 

Auother important question may be alluded to here. It does not 
follow at once that the diameter of the black spot measured in the field 
of the telescope actually coincides with the area of contact. The ques- 
tion relative to the correction to be applied is to be looked at from four 
points of view: (1) It is known that in case of Newton's rings, light is 
not only extinguished throughout the area of contact, but throughout 
a somewhat wider margin to a point at which the vertical distance 
between plate and lens is about ^ wave length (say), depending on 
the intensity of the illumination. The spot is therefore to this extent 
hn-ger than the area of contact. Now, it would be possible to compute 
this correction from the data theoretically given for the curvature of 
the area of contact in a way sufficient for all possible cases; and this 
has been done. It is much simpler, however, and more free from 
assumptions which need not be detailed here, to refer such measure- 
ments to the first of the rings surrounding the black spot. For the 
position of the ring is such that the vertical distance between plate 
and lens is necessarily ^ wave length. Now, since the area of contact 
is always very small, the curvature of contiguous parts may be neg- 
lected. Hence the correction to be applied [deducted] is 0^ of the 
distance of the first ring from the edge of the spot, meaning, of course, 
the true edge. In other words, the correction is one half the distance, 
f, between the first ring and the apparent edge of the spot; and since 
this correction (^ e) is to be deducted from both ends of the diameter 
(1, the full correction is f, or the true diameter of the area of contact is 
<l-F. It is advisable, therefore (other considerations will appear below), 
to construct a tabh; in which for any given substance the correction 
nniy be taken at once as a function of the pressure applied and the 
curvatui'e of the lens used. For practical i)urposes, moreover, an 
approximate table, in which the correction is mapped out as a function 
of spot-diameter and lens -curvature, pi, will in most cases be sufficient, 
no matter what tlie substance maybe. Such a table may heie be 
inserted, spot-diameters, d, being gi\'en in scale parts, and the cor- 
rection in jV scale parts of the ocular micrometer.

(2) The astigmatic aberration of the image observed through the phite 
is next to be considered. In view of the small angular deviation of the 
lines of sight, the error in question will never exceed one-tenth per cent 
of the observed value, unless, indeed, the observations are made near 
tlie circumference of the field of view. This is quite unnecessary and 
should not be done. 

(3) Another negligible error is introduced by the fact that the ob- 
served spot is a horizontal j)i"ojection of the curved area of contact. 
Even in the case of my most convex lenses and the highest pressure 
admissible, the effect of the difl'erence of area of the actual surface and 
its projection will not exceed 2 in 1,000. 

(4) Finally the flexure of the test plate j>, which under the circum- 
stances is converted into a concave lens, may be adduced. A correction 
of this kind would be appreciable, if the object to be observed were 
situated at an appreciable distance below the lens. This state of things 
can not be at once dismissed, for the locus of the circumference of the 
spot is at a place where the plate and the lens no longer touch each 
other, as has just been indicated. lu other words, the question contem- 
plates the actual position of the locus or seat of interference. Divers 
experiments which I made with special reference to this discrej)ancy 
proved however that the present source of error is not of greater 
moment than the preceding. 



VII. THE THEORY TESTED. 

The materials to which I coulined my present experiments were glass 
and quartz. The glass was obtained from the well-known house of 
Schott «& Gen, and the three samples furnished were marked I (rather 
soft), II (of mean hardness), and III (rather hard). The mere fact that 
I was thus able to avail myself of three degrees of hardness of one and 
the same substance lent a peculiar interest to the tests, for the differ- 
ences of hardness in question could not in any case be very marked, 
and the tests wonld therefore contain an immediate indication of the 
sensitiveness of my method. In addition to these substances I also 
worked witli a" plate of quartz (IV) cut at right angles to the crystallo- 
graphic axis. Here, as well as in the case of the glass (I, II, III), the 
lens and plate were cut from one and the same substance in each case. 



ON THE ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF HARDNESS. 225 

Pielimiiiaiy optical work showed that the departure froui homooeiiity 
throii54hoiit the muss of glass examined was nearly inappreciable, and 
the same was true of the given faces of the quartz appliances. Had it 
not been the case, the tests themselves would, in the course of the work, 
have indicated delicient isotropy, seeing that both the position or the 
shape of the lines of rupture depend on these conditions. Such results 
were indeed actually obtained in certain experiments which I madewith 
this especial end in view, but with Avhich 1 will not further detain the 
reader, for another question, and an important one, has since loomed 
into view and must now be answered. The theory sketched above 
makes mention only of isotropic media, and tlius it is not warrantable 
to apply it to crjstals. 

Fn a measure this is true, but it nmst be noticed that in the lirst of 
the eiiuatious (4) only the numerical coefficient is influenced by u'olo- 
tropy, and if equati<ms (1) and (2) can be proved to hold for the crys- 
talline body empirically, then the last of the equations (4) can be wrong- 
only as to its coefficient. Furthermore, the uncertainty can be tested 
by means of tlie ecpiation (o), as compared with the second of the ec^ua- 
tions (4), to a very small margin of uncertainty, by inserting known 
values of the elastic constant E'. Aside from this an interpretation of 
the coefficient in ({uestion shows that it is necessarily inclosed within 
narrow limits. There is still another point of view. Hertz's theory is 
true for elliptical conta(;t surfaces quite as much as for spherical sur- 
faces, from the nature of the reasoning enii»loyed; and even in the 
more general case (ellipsoid) the numerical factor in (questions turns 
out to be 3 2. If therefore the latter is independent of differences of 
direction considered geometrically, it will also be independent of the 
elastic assymmetry, a consideration, it is true, which apjjlies primarily 
for lines lying in the plane surfurce of the plate, but does not apply to 
the normal dimensions or depths. 

1 am bound to acknowledge, therefVue, that the data obtained with 
crystals are possibly not as accurate as the corresponding data for 
isotropic substaiu;es. This curious divergence in the behavior of crys- 
tals and glasses is bcn-ne out by the following qualitative result: 
Whereas impressed area and the line of rupture of an isotropic body is 
always a circular, only the impressed area retains this figure for quartz, 
while the lines of rupture is a figure midway between a circle and a 
hexagon. I will return to this matter elsewhere. The radii of curva- 
ture Df the lenses used were widely varied, and the values 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 
12, 15, and 30 """. enter the following experiments, the first and last, 
however, only in special Avork. If tlu* radius is too small there is obvi- 
ous difficulty in measuring the area of contact. Large radii, on the 
other hand, are equally unsatisfactory. The initial point-contact is 
not always attainable in this case, while the stress which must ulti- 
mately be brought to bear is a serious tax on the apparatus. Again,

tlie circles of rupture are so large that for a given plate relatively few 
tests can be made. 

My first measurements, made with the sole object of verifying Hertz's 
theory, l)ear directly on the truth or the degree of approximation of the 
equations (1) (2) (3) of section 2. Not until this was done was it Avar- 
rantable to proceed with equations (4) and (5) for the measurement of 
Pi and jK'. (1) To test the equation, (1), f/ = const., or ^>/V/-'=-- const., 
many measurements were made for each of the four samples enumer- 
ated, and for increasing values of pressure. Here a few results selectee' 
at random from my notebook may be exhibited.

It api)ears at a glance that in the third series q is constant and that 
the same is true as a first approximation in the first and second series. 
Closer scrutiny of the data reveals a gradual but slight decrease of q 
in the latter cases, arbitrary fluctuations being allowed for. Thus in 
the first series the average q for the first seven observations is 310, and 
for the last six 295; in the second series similarly the mean q for the 
first five and the last four observations is 3G7 and 361, repectively. 
This discrepancy is accounted for by equation (5), and indicates a cor- 
responding decrease of U^, that is either a gradual diminution of tlie 
modules .£', or of Poisson's ratio. Both conditions may plausibly be 
assumed. But since the observed march is insignificant or even quite 
absent in some of my series, it may justifiably be neglected. I shall 
therefore take q=coufit. throughout my work. With this understand- 
ing the probable errors of (/ in the above table may be computed and 
apjjear as follows : 

\q\ = 0.3028 ± 0.0010; [q] = 0.3643 ± 0.0031; [q] = 0.868 i 0.003, 

so th;».t the mean value of q for the experiments is correct to about 
one-half per cent and the error of the quartz series does not exceed 1 
per cent. By repeating the above work a number of timses the attain.-

able accuracy is further increased. Values of q obtained in this way 
for different plates and different lenses of the same material and radius 
in each case show larger differences than the foregoing" analysis has 
made probable. Hence it is reasonable to suppose that the different 
samples really differ as to elasticity, although the differences and the 
probable errors are surprisingly small.

(3) It is now only necessary to prove the equations (3). The data for 
P vary between 4 and 140 kilograms, an interval which in comparison 
with the small areas of contact encountered is strikingly large. In the 
case of different experiments made under the same conditions, i. e., for 
values all corresponding to the same material and the same lens curva- 
ture, P varies pronouncedly, as t\ie following example shows. The series 
is again chosen at random and represents an unfavorable case, for the 
jirobable error of the mean result is fully 3^ per cent.

Kow, it is to be observed (1) that at large value of F is usually cor- 
related with a large value of J), and therefore also corresponds to a 
smaller (/, thus the liuctuations are in part rectified; (2) thatin the final 
equation (4) the cube root of F only enters, so that all errors are reduced 
as 1 to 3. 

Quite an unexpected result is reached, however, Avhen the data for dif- 
ferent lens curvatures are compared. The equations (3) are not corrob- 
orated, not even approximately, though it would not be difficult to find 
a corrected term. Thus, for instance, in case of the glass II the data are :

All of which relations, instoad of being- constant, apineciably decrease. 

Tliis jiiay be expressed as follows: The j)reiiSHr<' per unit of area 
ich ieh juaf prod uees a line of rupture in the surface of a given plate of 
a given body, is not always the same; the said pressure increases in 
proportion as the test lens is more convex or the area of contact smaller. 
A further statement to the same effect may be made by indicating that 
the total i)ressure just sufficient to i^roducea line of rupture is notj^ro- 
portional to the square of the lens curvature; or again that the diam- 
eter of the impressed area when rupture just occurs is not directly pro- 
portional to the radius of the lens, seeing that both quantities increase 
at a retarded rate. Mere inspection of the above table shows, how- 
ever, that the values of the second row {P:p'^) decrease at the rate in 
which the values pincrease,aud the sameobservation applies to the other 
lows. Hence it follows that the relations theoretically deduced above 
are to be replaced by empirical relations such that (1) P is not proj)or- 
tional to J)', but to D^'% (2) 1* is not proportional to //, but to p; (3) not 
I), but Jy^^ is proportional to p. 

In how far these inferences are actually borne out by <^xi»eriment is

The i)robable errors are throughout only about 1 j)er cent. 

For the other i)lates these relations were also applicable. In these 
cases, however, only two values of p (4 and 12 millimeters) were availa- 
ble, so that the test is not very cogent. I therefore had a new plate and 
lens made out of each of the samples of soft glass I and of quartz, 
sele<-ting the radius in such a way that the impressions of the stylus 
api)i<»:ich the effect produced by a point or needle, A small radius 
also seemed preferable from the following ulterior considerations : If the 
value of the pressure per unit of area which just produces rupture 
IS a function of the radius of the lens, then the value p=l (milli- 
meter) as compared with the above radii, must possess the particular 
im])ortance of a unit. Exi)eriments made with these small and highly 
convex lenses, cannot of course lead to as great a regularity of data as 
were obtained in many of the above cases; but the mean result is none

Here, as in the above case, the i)robable errors are between ^ and 
1 per cent. 

On the basis of these results it follows, therefore, that if hardness be 
computed by the last of the equations (4), the Hertzian values, Pi, will 
vary with p. If, however, these data (Pi) are multiplied by VD, or, 
more conveniently, by 3 Vp? then the new values of hardness are con- 
stant qualities, irrespective of the curvature of the stylus used. In 
general, furthermore, the theoretical premises have been corroborated 
by experiment to a remarkably close degree of accordance; only in 
one point (and this happens to be the most important deduction) is 
there a wide divergence between j^redictions of the theory and the 
facts. Inasmuch as the disagreement evidences a well defined law, it 
is worth while to examine the conditions under which the theory 
applies. 

(1) Hertz" supposes the area of contact to be small relatively to the 
spherical surface. In the above experiments, liowever, it is quite 
doubtful whether this can at once be assumed in all cases. Indeed, the 
ratios of the limiting radius of the imi)ressed area B and the lens 
radius preach values as high as 1 : 11, and they can not be at once dis- 
missed. We are thus led to inquire in how far the theoretical state- 
ments, relatively to pressure direction and pressure components, curva- 
tures and area of the impressed surface, are affected by the large values 
JR/p specified. 1 have done this and find, in a way which has already 
been suggested in the above text, that the theory still holds to a degree 
quite within the errors of experiment, at least in the majority of obser- 
vations. The fixed values of q, moreover, is compatible with this result, 
for in the case of increasing loads q is pronouncedly constant when p 
is smallest. 

(2) Again, the interesting fact that the locus of rupture surrounds 
the area of contact and is situated at a certain distance from it, may 



ON THE ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF HARDNESS. 231 

bci looked into. But if in tlic iibovc formula' the. impressed surfaee is 
replaced by the area within the circle of rupture, the empiric law stated 
above is not chanj^ed. The source of discrepancy is not, therefore, to 
be found here. 

(3) Nor does the assumi)tiou that the impressed surfaces may be rel- 
atively too large help us out of the dilemnm. For in such a case the 
differences between theory and fact would vanish in proportion as Rj p 
is smaller. The results do not show this. In case of glass III, for 
instance, the ratios /* 77- are still enormously different, for /3=J: and 
/j=12 PjlJ-^^S) and 50.-4, respectively), whereas the (quantity i?/p has 
already decreased to -j\- aud 0-3, respectively. 

To decrease ]\ p even beyond this, a new lens was made of the same 
glass with a radius as large as /;=.)() millinu^.ters. In this case Rj p= 
3V and 777^^ ought therefore now either to coincide with the corre- 
sponding quantity for p=l-, or at least to differ inappreciably from it. 
Tiie data found for P; J>', however (.'JD.G and 50.4), are very far from 
being constant, while F/D 2/3 shows the same fixed values as above. 

(4) I may instance, in passing, that in the case of different substances 
the quotients i' D- are indei)endent of p. Thus, for the substances 
tested the values given dimensions of lens are: Glass I, 100; glass 11, 
105; glass Iir, 113; quartz, 135. Hence it is possible to obtain a rela- 
tirc NCdle oi liar(lnt\ss which is not affected by the discrepancies here 
discussed, and therefore some certain progress has been reached, from 
ai practical ])oint of view at least. 

(5) Summarizing the above, I am bound to confess that the cause of 
the discrepancy between theory and experiment has thus far eluded 
me. A gap must therefore be left in the theoretical side of the inquiry, 
with reference to which I would like to hazard the following sugges- 
tions: Compatibly with the relations which i have found experi- 
mentally, the last of the Cipiations (1) leads to very different values of 
Pi when different test lenses are employed. If therefore Pi be termed 
the hardness of the material, the formula has no concrete meaning. 
Hence, either the stated definition of hardness must be rejected or one 
of the conditions, subject to which the eijuation Avas deduced, is not 
applicable. Saliently among these is the assumption that i^late and 
lens are of the same material, and are therefore necessarily identical as 
to hardness. If this is not the case, then the hardness of one of the 
parts of the system is to be expressed in terms of the other (the equa- 
tions for this c(nni)utation are of an involved character), and with the 
aid of the observed data ; or ecjuation (4) can only yield a rough value for 
the mean hardness of the system of plate and lens at best. The point 
which I am ai)proaching is this : Even if the lens and plate be cut from 
the same homogeneous solid it does not follow that they are necessa- 
rily ecpially hard, for hardness may reasonably be conceived to vary 
both with the substance and with the superficial curvature of the parts 



232 ON THE ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF HARDNESS. 

at the i)oiiit of exauiiiuitioii. Ck'arly, in siicli ;i case, Imrdncss \\ouUl 
increase with the curvature at the point. 

Evidence in favor of this surmise is ah-eady available, seeing that 
whenever the above experiments are carefully planned and executed, 
rupture always occurs in the plate, Avhile the hms remains intact. 
Hence, in proportion as the lens is more convex it is also harder, and 
the value of the mean hardness of the system obtained from equation 
(4) must therefore increase with the lens curvature. This is what the 
experiments actually indicate. Pursuing- this suggestion further, it 
follows that the equation expressing the hardness of the lens will be 

where a is the hardness of a plaije surface of the given material (a 
constant which might be called hitrinsic hanhiess)^ and b the curva- 
ture constant, or, as it might be called, surface hdrdncss. The close 
analogy between h and the surface tension of liquids is obvious at a 
glance.^ 

As a second suggestion, I should like to propose a change of Hertz's 
definition of hardness. Hertz's characteristic contains three elements; 
it is (1) a i)ressure, (2) its direction, Z_, is normal, and (3) it refers to 
the center of the impressed surface. 

Since the criterion in case of brittle bodies is tlie occurrence of rupt- 
ure, i. e., a separation of parts, the immediate cause can not be pressure 
but tension. Furthermore, the crack passes from the surface 5^ = 0, not 
quite normally ])erhaps, but nearly so, into the interior; and hence it 
is not Z^ but an oblique pressure, indeed almost a lateral pressure, X^, 
which is pre eminently active. Finally since the crack encircles the 
area of contact, the component X^ is here to be inserted. Unfortu- 
nately the complexity of the formuhe is such that a full solution of the 
problem can not be obtained for this case; they show however that 
X^^ reaches its maxinuim negative value on tlie outside of the surface 
of contact, and that the maximum is differently related to the lens 
curvature from the normal pressure. Obviously the latteris dependent 
on curvature in two dimensions, the other on the curvature in a single 
dimension. In short, even if the experiment leads to different values 
of (^i,)n,ax according as different lens curvatures apply, it does not fol- 
low that these different values may not all corres])ond to one and the 
same (A'x)inax' Perhaps these considerations may even be i)ut more 
clearly by calling to mind that the maxinuim pressure on the surface 
produces no appreciable effect in this surface at all ; its action, however, 



An allied analogy is given by the tensile strength of iron wire, Avhich, according 
to Baiinieister (Wied. Ann., vol. 18, 1883, j). 578), is greater in proportion as the thick- 
ness ofthewireis smaller. I have found that the law here is /':= const. -^(V, or 
identical with the above relations. Some exceptions may reasonably be taken to 
all of these points.

it is not reiuarkabhi that constant results can only be reaelied if P is 
divided by a low power of />. 

VIII. DATA FOR HARDNESS AND ELASTICITY. 

The remarks of the preeeding paragraph have shown that though the 
theoretical questions encountered in tlie present paper are in need of 
further elucidation, the considerations involved do not much affect the 
practical side of the issue. I have already pointed out that irrespective 
of the shortcomings of the theory, the relative scale of hardness is 
vouched for. Again there is one particular case in m hich the data are 
virtually absolute. This occurs Avhen the curvature of the lens, p=l. 
Finally the at)Solute value of the <lata obtained will necessarily be gen- 
eral, since the I'acts show that by multiplying Hertz's expression by 
^ Vp, the results for a given substance are constant throughout. This 
datum may safely be taken as the absolute hardness of the body, 
although its mechanical interpretation is not quite apparent nor quite 
certain. Furthermore even these stri(jtures Avill disapi)ear, if the 
occurreuce of a particularized surface hardness can be inferred from 
other and independent experiments, or if the dependence of tenacity 
and of hardness on lens curvature can be similarly computed in all 
cases. With these conditions premised the quantity P\-^/ p mav be 
termed the absolute hardness of the body, ami hence

(juartz 7). They further show ii lii^hly isatisfactory degree of aei^ord- 
ance (remembering always that this is the first attempt made to define 
hardness rigorously) ; for the errors lie within 1 percent. In case of 
the individual values for glass even the extreme data lie far enough, 
apart to indicate the difference of material. ISTor is it remarkable that 
the value for quartz is not larger relatively to glass, seeing that all 
these bodies are closely related to each other. Indeed, I shall show 
elsewhere that quartz plates cut i)arallel to the axis are not harder 
than glass of average hardness. 

Inasmuch as hardness thus appears as a particular kind of tenacity, 
it is interesting to compare the results obtained with tenacities 
obtained by other and more common methods. This can at once be done 
for glass, thanks to the elaborate reserches of v. Kowalski.* I will 
therefore compare his data for Thuringian glass with the mean of my 
values for hardness

Flexure 8. 8 

Torsion 10. 1

Hardness 226. 

Hence longitudinal and tlexural tenacity are about equally large, 
torsional tenacity is somewhat larger, compressional tenacity four times, 
and hardness twenty-six times as large as the first ([uantity. 

I shall now attempt to avail myself of equation (5) and thus obtain 
the elastic constant E' and possibly the modulus VV. 

The following values obtain for E'.

Now -E7^ contains both ^ and yu, and these can be individually meas-

larger than 2 per cent. Indeed, this value when compared with Voigt's 
value, ^0=10304, agrees with it to about 1 per cent. In consideration 
of the totally different methods by which the tw^o results are reached, 
the agreement is very satisfactory. Moreover, since the two data cor- 
respond to different intensities f)f strain, complete co-incidence is not to 
be looked for. 

I will close with a short comi)arison of the values of hardness and 
elasticity. It appears at once that the harder of two bodies is the 
more elastic, but hardness increases less rapidly than elasticity. If H 
be expressed in per cents of E^ the following values obtain: Glass I, 
3.9; glass II, 3.3; glass III, 3.2; quartz, 2.9. This state of things is 
strikingly manifest in the experiments themselves. One would natur- 
ally ex[)ect that greater pressures are to be brought to bear in the cases 
of the harder and more elastic bodies. As a rule the reverse of this is 
the fact. For in the ease of the softer material the surface of contact 
rapidly increases, and hence greater pressures must be exerted to pro- 
duce the same stress per unit of area. 



THE FLOW OF SOLIDS,* 

OR THE BEHAVIOR OF SOLIDS UNDER HIGH PRESSURE. 



By William Hallock. 



AmoTij? the many i)hysica] questions tliat are of vital interest to tlie 
student of structural geology the one which may well contend for a 
])osition in the front rank is, W^hat is the effect of pressure, with or 
without a rise of temperature, upon the rocks and rock-making magmas 
which form the outer shells of our earth? As a very important subdi- 
vision of this general question we have this: What is the etfect of pres- 
snres upon so-called solids without any rise in temi)eratnre above a point 
far removed from the ordinary melting point? In other words, can we 
liquefy solids by pressure alone! As corollaries we have any pecu- 
liarities at the instant of liquefaction and possible cliemical reaction 
during this state of enforced liquidity. 

These questions have long formed the subject of theoretical discus- 
sion, but in spite of the fundamental importance of their satisfactory 
and final settlement they have seldom been investigated experimen- 
tally, doubtless owing to tlie difficulty of obtaining, measuring, and 
managing sufficiently high. pressures. 

W^alther Spring may perhaps be rightfully called the pioneer in this 
work, having within the last few years published the results of much 
experimental work upon this question. Ilis memoirs t would seem to 
l»r()\(' without doubt and finally, that pressures under 7,000 atmos- 
pheres will liquefy the large majorityl of solids, and it is only a ques-

tiou of a little higher pressure to accomplish th(3 result even Avith the 
most refractory. Further tlian this, Mr. Spring has investigated the 
second corollary, and finds that chemical reaction takes place during 
this fusion; * at least when the volume of the products is less than that 
of the original substances. 

Unfortunately however for the conclusive character of Mr. Spring's 
works, they have been seriously called into questiou, especially by Ch. 
Friedel.t Eduard Jannetaz| repeated many of Spring's experiments, 
and his results confirm Friedel's criticisms rather than Sj)ring's conclu- 
sions, which he (Jannetaz) contradicts in every essential ])oint. 

Such was practically the conditiou of the question two years ago, 
when the Director of the IT. S. Geological Survey, J. W. Powell, re- 
quested me to devote my time and thoughts to what we hoped Avould 
be its final settlement. § 

It would l)e unjust to leave unmentioned here the elaborate and ex- 
haustive series of experiments made by Henri Tresca|| on "the Flow 
of Solids," which are fundamental as regards the point investigated, 
which however is but a small part of tlie general question. 

In order that my meaning may be clear, I wish for myself and for 
this j)aper to imj)ress certain meanings upon certain terms or words. 
Primarily, I wisli strongly to distinguish between causing a body to 
"flow" and rendering it a true liquid. Any substance may "flow" 
when the force acting to cause the molecules to change their relative 
positions is greater than the force with which the molecules are held in 
their original positions; i. e., is greater than the rigidity or viscosity of 
the substance. This can occur from two causes, — an increase of the 
force tending to disturb the molecules, or a diminution of the resisting 
I)ower, the rigidity of the material. Tlie first cause may take the form 
of i^ressure, strain, or such like force; the second cause is heat, and 
possibly other agencies. Whether rupture or flow takes place when 
the deforming overcomes the resisting force depends upon the nature 
of the substance, its limiting conditions, and the time alloiced for the ac- 
complishment of the motion. 

It is impossible to draw a sharp line between " liquids" and " solids;" 
for convenience they may well be classed as true liquids, viscous 
liquids, viscous solids, true solids. In the first class would fall 
such substances as, in a small fraction of a second, fill their containing

vessel to a horizontal surface. As true liquids we should theu have 
such as alcoliol,water, glycerine, molasses, etc. Viscous liquids require 
several seconds to fill their containing vessel to a level surface; thick 
tar is a good example. When the substance requires hours or even 
weeks in which to yield to gravity and change its form, I would call it 
a viscous solid; paraffin, shoeniaker's-wax. and even lead and some 
other metals are such. A true solid retains its original shape indefi- 
nitely under ordinary conditions of pressure and temperature, as steel, 
glass, etc. Of course such a thing as an absolutely or perfecily rigid 
substance is as unknown to us as is an absolute or perfect fluid. 

If the above ideas are correct, ''true liquefaction" is the diminishing 
of th<' rigidity or viscosity of a substance until its molecules change 
their relative positions as easily as in a true li<piid. 

I give these definitions merely that I may be understoo<l in the use 
of these terms, and not because I think tliem new or especially good. 
In order that a substance may undergo a change in its chemical or 
crystalline character, it is undoubtedly necessary that it should be in 
the condition, at least, of a viscous solid, so that the molecules can 
slowly re-arrange themselves, if there be any force urging them thereto. 
Our question is. Will pressure alone impart to the molecules such a 
freedom of motion? A priori it is inconceivable to me how or why it 
should. For with the exception of a few isolated substances at particu- 
lar temperatures — as water between 4° C. and ice at zero — an increase 
of li([uidity or a diminution of rigidity is simultaneous with an increase 
of volume — that is, with an increase of the inter-molecular distances, 
which is accomplished by '• heating" the substance. In general^ for one 
and the same substance over considerable ranges of condition, the 
rigidity diminishes as the inter-molecular distances increase. How then 
can pressing the molecules nearer together be expected to give them a 
property which always accompanies their separation ? 

THE APPARATUS. 

The first requisite tor the experiments was pressure, and naturally 
desiring the l^est machine, we were able, through the kindness of Gen. 
Benet, Chief of Ordnance, to have the use in its spare moments of the 
testing machine built by A. H. Emery for that department, and situated 
at Watertown. ^lass. This machine undoubtedly enables the operator 
to obtain — measure — and manage — high pressui'es better than any other. 

Personally. I am greatly indebted to Capt. J. Pitman, of the Ord- 
nance Corps, for suggestions as well on the construction of the holders 
as on the theoretical points; and also to Mr. J. E. Howard, the engi- 
neer in charge of the testing machine, for his knowledge of the capacity 
of materials, and their best shape and quality to obtain the results 
desired. The ajqiaratus was constructed by the American Tool and 
Machine Company i»f Boston. ^lass.

THE FLOW OF SOLIDS. 



For the preliminary tests it seemed desirable to have a holder wliich 
could be opened, so as to show the compressed material in position, and 
finally the following form was adopted : 

Diagram of appiiratas used in work on liish pressures.

Fig. 1. — Loujritudiiial scctioi 




Tig. 2. — Transverse section. 

Fig. 1 shows a longitudinal section on A A of Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows 
a transverse section across the holder on the plane B B of Fig. 1. E E 
are the two halves in contact at li li, inclosing the cylindrical hole F, in 
which the substance to be pressed is i^laced. h h are strips of tissue 
paper, used as packing between two halves. I and I', Fig. 1, are the 
two pins, acting as pistons, fitting into the hole F, to transmit the 
pressure; a a and a a are copper " gas-checks," placed in front of these 
pins, to flare out and fill tightly the hole, preventing any escape of 
material. Figs. 1 and 2 are about one-sixth of natural size. Fig. 3 
shows the manner in which the apparatus was held in the testing ma- 
chine and the pressure applied. P P P and P' P' P' are the jaws of 
the hydraulic clamps of the machine (capacity 1,000,000 pounds). H 
H are merely blocks to enable the clamp to properly hold the holder 
E E. ]Sr is a block to hold the back stationary pin in place. The let- 
tering in Figs. 1 and 2 apply in Fig. 3. V V is the hydraulic clamp 
on the fixed end of tlie testing machine where the pressure is weighed. 
The block B B moves on a spherical surface (R R) on the plate T T, 
thus permitting the adjustment of the face of O perpendicular to the 
line of pressure or parallel to the rear surface of the pin I. To apply 
the pressure, the movable clamp P P' is forced toward V V by a 
hydraulic piston, thus forcing the holder E E over the pin resting 
against O; the pressure on O is measured by the hydraulic balance 
of the machine. In this manner a total comi)ressive power of one 
million pounds was available, but as the pins yielded at 110,000 pounds 
per square inch, the tests were not carried above <»,109 atmospheres, 
or 96,000 pounds per square inch.

been forced over the riglit-liaud pin. Multiplying the simultaneous 
loads and compressions, we obtain the icorl: done, and hence the possi- 
ble heat generated. In this experiment the work done was 2,330 foot- 
pounds, or 3.0 thermal units, 1 pound 1° F., sufficient to raise 1.557 
pounds lead alone about 03'=^ F., or 34'^ C. If the heat generated is dis- 
sipated into the holder E E, as is sure to be tlie case, the rise in tem- 
perature Avould be less than 1° C, or 1^.8 F. 

Under a pressure of 6,000 atmospheres the granular lead showed not 
the least sign of true liquefaction. It was merely pressed together, and 
could easily be broken up and reduced to the original grains between 
the tliumb and finger. It is true these experiments were not performed 
in vacuo, a condition which Walther Spring considers of importance. 
But if there is a true liquefaction, why does not the air rise to the top 
of the cavity and allow fusion, as it does when the granular lead is 
heated ? There is no liiiuefaction, only a pressing and sticking together. 

SECOND 'PEST. 

Next 0.672 pounds* of antimony was ground in a mortar until it went 
through a 48-sieve, and then it Avas similarly submitted to (),000^ atmos- 
pheres pressure, with the same result; the grains were simply stuck 
together, and were perfectly distiuct in their original form. The cylin- 
der formed was hard and tenacious, but gave no signs of lifpiefaction 
or recrystallization. The work done in this case might have raised the 
antimony alone 230° F., or 110^ C, or holder and antimony l^.S F., or 
lo 0. 

THIRD TEST. 

Well-crystallized calcite, 0.271 poundst was ground, put through a 
48-sieve, and submitted to a pressure of 6,000 atmospheres, producing 
practically no effect, the resulting mass being easily broken between 
the thumb and finger. 

Finding it useless to have large quantities of the compressed material 
for elaborate examination, it was decided to expedite matters by putting 
in several substances at one time, and the following rather crucial test 
was made: 

FOURTH TEST. 

L H, left-hand pin, stationary. K H, right-hand pin, entering the 
hole F, moving. 

The charge was composed as follows : 

A. Small section of antiuiony from test II. 

B. A stick of beeswax, whittled ronud, uearly tittiug the hole. 

C. A stick of parafflu, whittled round, uearly fitting the hole. 

D. Bismnth prepared like the antimony for test II. 

E. Pai-affin, same as C. 

F. Lead from test I. 



* 0.672 pounds antimony, solid, filled the hole F, 5 inches long. 
t 0.271 pounds of solid calcite fills the lioldcr, n inches in length.

(1 (I were double-pointed tacks stuck into the toj) of the beeswax and 
])aiaf1in, and at a and <• two okl sihwr 3-cent pieces were laid on top of 
the wax and the paraffin in the cylinder. 




Vu,. t. — I)i:i^rain showing experiment. 

W'liiit are we to expect? The silver pieces and tacks wouUl fall 
through the liquid wax and piiraffin, and B and C, if liquid, would mix. 
Nay, according to Mining's results, we should expect to find along the 
loAver part of the mold a semicylindrical piece of an alloy of lead, anti- 
mony, bisnnith, possibly silver and iron, and above this the mixture of 
paraffin and wax. The actual result Avas that the substances all came 
out just as they leent into the lyrens. There was not the slightest trace of 
a tendency to flow on the part of the metals; the lead and antimony re- 
mained as they Avere, the bismuth acted precisely as did the antimony 
in f«'st II. There was no sign of fusion of the wax and paraffin, which 
separated on their surface of contact (between B and C) clear and dis- 
tinct, rt, c, <?, and d did not sink to the bottom — on the contrary, they 
retained their original i)ositions: and the silver pieces were forced 
against the top of the cylinder so powerfully that their iinj)ression left 
in the steel holder was easily seen and felt^ and the pieces were bent 
cylindrical, fitting the inside of the liolder. Here we find a much greater 
rigidity of wax and paraffin under i)ressure than ordinarily sup])osed 
])()ssible under any circumstances. 

Nowliere was there a sign of true li(iuefaction. The wax and i)araffiu 
had acted only as vis(;ous solids, and flowed only to fill the available 
opening. 

Kliril TEST. 

In a simihir way tlie lollowing substances were subjected (o a pres- 
sure of (>,000 atmospheres, with the results as stated: 

Sodium (•arl)Onatc, dry. — Stuck luiicthiT sli<j,litly, rcscinbliui,^ chalk ; easily cut with 
a kuife. 

Sodium sulphate. — Probably dissolved in its water of crystallization ( lOHgO) : it was 
forced out between the halves of the holder as a milky li(iuid which solidified. 
The little left in the holder resembled paraffin in appearance, but soon weath- 
ered to a white ]iowder. 

Zinc sulphate (-1- THjO). — No sinus of fusiou ; merely stuck together; the original 
pieces of crystals easily \ isible. 

Coppi-r suljihati' (-(-r>II_.0). — Same as zinc sulphate. 

.SIXTH TEST. 

rotassium chloride. — Formed a hard lump, w hose fracture resembled that of hjaf 
sugar or that of marble, with the oiigiual crystals visible; no trace of fusion. 
Sodium cliloriile. — Similar to potassium chloride, only a little more compact. 



244 THE FLOW OF 80LIDS. 

Ammouiiim chloride. — Still more compact, resembles vegetable ivory ; jtossibly the 
bcginuiug of fusion. Observe the order of increasing effect : 

KCl<NaCl<NH4Cl. 

Sulphur roll. — Ground and put through a48-sieve ; formed a hard, solid, brittle mass, 
but tlie original grains were easily distinguishable, there being no trace of a true 
liquefaction. 

SEA'ENTIl TEST. 

Powdered glass. — No effect; scarcely coherent. 

Powdered rosin. — Very good fusion. 

Powdered borax. — A compact, chalk-like mass, slit/ Jit It/ translucent ; no crystallization. 

Powdered zinc and sulphur. — No tracts of fusicm or chemical union ajiparcnt. Car- 
bon disuljihido dissolved out the sulphur so completely that the remaining zinc 
gave a mere trace of sulphureted hydrogen on treating with hydrochloric acid. 
The zinc was slightly coherent, but there was no fusion and no zinc sulphide 
formed. 

After obtainiug the above results it seemed useless to continue this 
line of experiments, and preparations were made to use more rigid steel, 
by which it was hoped that pressures of at least 10,000 atmospheres 
might be obtained; also for making the comiiressions in vacuo. Unfor- 
tunately thus far nothing but preparations have been made, since the 
testing machine is kept fully occupied with the special work of the 
department to which it belongs. It is hoped, however, that this inves- 
tigation will soon be taken up again and carried to a close ; till then 
our conclusions are only temporary. 

The above substances were also compressed by W. Spring* /« vacuo 
with the following results : 

Lead. — Perfect fusion at a pressiire of 2,000 atmospheres. At a pressure of 5,000 
atmosijheres it ran out of all the cracks (fenles) of the apparatus. 

Bismuth. — At a i^ressure of 6,000 ainiospheros, i>erfect fusion. 

Tin. — At a jiressure of 3,000 atmospheres, fusion. 

Zinc. — At a pressure of 5,000 atmospheres, perfect fusion. 

Antimony. — At a pressure of 5,000 atmospheres, beginning of fusion. 

Suli)hur, prismatic. — At a pressure of 5,000 atmospheres, fusion to the octahedral 
form. 

Suljihur, plastic. — At a ]>ressure of (>,000 atuiospheres, fusion to the octahedral forui. 

Sulphur, octahedral. — At a pressure of 3,000 atmospheres, fusion to the octahedral 
form. 

Potassium chloride. — At a pressure of 5,000 atmospheres, perfect fusion. 

Sodium chloride. — At a pressure of 5,000 atmospheres, perfect fusion. 

Ammonium chloride. — At a pressure of 4,000 atmospheres, perfect fusion. 

Sodium sulphate (IOH2O). — At a pressure of 3,000 atmospheres, i)erfect fusion. 

Zinc sulphate (TH^O). — At a pressure of 5,000 atmos])heres, perfect fusion. 

Copper sulphate (.5H2O). — At a pressure of 6,000 atmospheres, completely crystal- 
lized. 

Sodium carbonate, dry. — At a pressure of 5,500 atmospheres, stuck together {agglo- 
mere. ) 

Iceland spar. — At a i»ressure of 6,000 atmospheres, imperfect fusion. 

Borax (crystallized). — At a pressure of 7,000 atmospheres, imperfect fusiiui. 

Glass (powdered.) — At a jjressure of 6,000 atmospheres, no effect. 
And so on to the end.

CONCLUSIONS. 

Coiu'lusions at this stage of the investigation are necessarily prema- 
ture and tentative 5 still it may not be out of place to summarize the 
results of these and other experiments. 

It seems established that pressure alone can not truly licjuefy a solid, 
i. e., diminish its rigidity. Consequently, we can scarcely expect chem- 
ical and crystalline changes by pressure alone. Solids can be made to 
flow and act in that respect, as liquids, by jiressure, which overcomes 
the rigidity without diminishing it. In this case the time allowed for 
the motion is of vital importance. 

AVhether further investigation will alter these conclusions or not is a 
(luestion of time; at present, I believe them the only true <mes to be 
drawn from the availal)le facts.

THl^: SCIENTIFIC WORK OF GEORGE SIMON OHM.* 



By Eugene Lommel. 

Triiusliited by William Hallock. 



Olio luiiidred years ago, on the IGtli of March, 1789, George Simon 
Ohm was born at Erhmgeii. His father was a lock-smith, an unusual 
man, wlio trained both his sons in mathematics as well as his trade. 
These gifted young men w^ere endowed by liim witli that thirst for 
Iviiowledge which led him to devote his riper years to mathematical 
studies. Tlie younger brother, Martin Ohm, became distinguished as 
a mathematician, and died as professor of mathematics at the military 
school at Berlin. George Simon Ohm climbed to the lofty position of 
those rare men Avhose names shine with everlasting glory in the history 
of science, which they liaAC enriched with their Avonderful discoveries. 

Only a few of his contemporaries could fully appreciate the unpre- 
tentious scuintist, or estimate the wide application of his law of the gal- 
vanic current, with the discovery of which his scientific career com- 
menced. In the beginning of the century Volta had discovered his 
''pile," that most marvellous structure that the keenness of the human 
mind ever devised. From that moment numerous physicists had been 
ceaselessly active, investigating in every way the wonderful and mani- 
fold effects of the electric current which that pile produced. 

The decomposition of water had been discovered in 1800 by Nichol- 
son and Carlisle. Twenty years later the deflection of the magnetic 
needle Avas observed by Oersted. Thermo-electricity was discovered in 
1821 by Seebeck ; electro-dynamic phenomena, in 1823, by Ampere. In 
1821 Sehweigger and Roggendoiff invented the galvanisco])e ("multi- 
plicator"), which first rendered possible the accurate measurement of 
the eftects of the current. The multitude of observations became more 
numerous in ]>ro])oition as mor(^ varied means of investigation became 
available. Nevertheless they were not able to lift the mysterious veil 
which shrouded the workings of th(^ galvanic current. On the con- 
trary, they seemed rather to increase the Babel of conflicting theories. 

We are tilled with strange sensations, glancing to-day through the 
articles of that time upon the galvanic current. N\'e see the most 
exjierieuced investigators doubtfully groping in darkness whereto-day,

248 THE SCIENTIFIC WORK OF GEORGE SIMON OHM. 

thanks to Obm's discjovery, all is to us clear and evident. The major- 
ity of the galvanists of the day indeed seemed contented in the laby- 
rinth in which they had involved themselves. They did not seize the 
thread of Ariadne which the sharp-sighted investigator seized at last. 
These pioneer services of Ohm at first remained generally unappreci- 
ated. Only individual physicists, like Poggendorft" and Schweigger, 
Pfaffand Fechner, recognized their great importance, and with success 
in their work used this new enunciation. It required a foreign impulse 
to win recognition in Germany for his law of the intensity of the current. 
This law is always meant when "Ohm's law" is referred to. Pouillet 
established Ohm's law in France by the articles which he published in 
1831 and 1837, five and eleven years, respectively, after Ohm's discov- 
ery. In spite of this fact Pouillet believed himself the real discoverer, 
because he had found it experimentally. Pouillet believed that Ohm 
had only deduced it mathematically from certain hypothetical premises. 
In France the belief arose that Ohm found his law by simple deduction 
based upon an hypothesis, and then subsequently verified it by experi- 
ment. This belief remains to the present day in spite of frequent con- 
tradictions. It is found to-day not only in French treatises, but, most 
inconceivably, even in widely used German text-books. It would thus 
appear by no means superfluous to set forth the history of Ohm's great 
discovery, in its actual course and based ux)on original publications. 

Experimental investigation strives to recognize a law of nature by 
attempting to establish the dependence of the effect in any natural 
phenomenon upon its determining cause. Measurements are made in 
as many individual cases as possible. Then some relation is sought, 
in the shape of an equation, which shall exjiress this dependence and 
re-produce all the individual cases as accurately as possible. In the 
choice of this equation mistakes will occur which can not be immedi- 
ately detected. The one taken may sufficiently conform to the availa- 
ble observations, which may embrace too small a range of the determin- 
ing quantity, and may fail utterly when this range is extended. Then 
it can not be looked upon as the expression of the law of nature sought, 
which must cover all cases without exception. 

Ohm followed this experimental method when, in 1825, he tried to 
establish the law of conduction. He was at that time a teacher in the 
public school (gymnasium) at Cologne. The experiments made for the 
above purpose were described in an article entitled " Preliminary notice 
of the law according to which metals conduct contact electricity," 
Schweigger's Journal, 1825, vol. xliv. His " preliminary notice " wo, 
too hasty. The formula which he proposed is incorrect. It is: 



V = m log fl-^-\ 



wherein w and a are ccmstants, and v the loss of force on introducing a 
length of wire ecpial to .r. Ohm soon recognized the cause of this

failuic in tlie too limited range of his experiments and in the liaetua- 
tions in the for(;e of the galvanie battery. Much hiter the invention 
of the constant cell obviated these fluctuations. 

Tn the summer of the same year, 1825, and in the same volume of 
Sclnveigger's Journal, appears a letter from Ohm to the editor. He says 
in c()nse([uence of more extended experiments he is moved to replace 
his formula with a new but analogous one. In this the force would only 
vanish for x = cc . 

Not long after this, in the spring of 1820, vol. xliv of Schweigger's 
Journal contained that wonderful pioneer work which contains the 
experimental discovery of the law of the intensity of the current. Its 
title is: " Determination of the law according to which metals conduct 
contact electricity, together with the outlines of a theory of Yolta's 
apparatus and the Schweigger's galvanoscope." In the introduction 
to this article Ohm expresses the hope that he is in a position to 
})ropose what will ai>pear to be a true law of nature. First, on account 
of its perfect agreement with experiments extended in all directions; 
second, and es]»ecially because of its simplicity which extends it to all 
our exi)erience with the electric current. A simplicity such as is only 
found in truth. 

The "fluctuations of force" had disturbed Ohm greatly in his former 
experiments, Poggendortif suggested that he should use a thermo-electric 
instead of a hydro-electric battery. This he did and now the law ap- 
peared in perfect distinctness from his measurements. The inten- 
sity of the current Ls directly proportional to the exciting force and 
inversely proportional to the total resistance. This he represented in the 
equation 

-jj- a 

"wherein X is the intensity of the magnetic effect of the conductor 
whose length is x, a and h represent constant quantities depending 
iil»on the exciting force, and the resistance to conductivity of the other 
]»arts of the circuit. 

In this law he held in his hand the key to the various riddles before 
which i)hysicists had hitherto stood helpless. And indeed he knew 
how to ns(^ that key! Farther on he says: "Our equation has now 
sufficiently established itself as the accepted rei)resentative of nature 
by the correctness with which it always repeats the results obtained in 
such profusion from the thormo-electric battery. Let us follow it far- 
ther and see what it may still hold concealed in its lap." 

Olnn then developed the jjeculiarities of the galvanic battery and 
galvaniscope, which till then had ap])eared so confused and unintelli- 
l)le. And we in our text-books to-day follow his development. Bub- 
l>ling over with joy in the feeling that he had beheld the face of truth, 
lie may well feel a Justitiable pride. At the close of that wonderful 
work he exclaims: "The th(M)ries of the battery and galvaniscope, here 



250 THE SCIENTIFIC WORK OF GE0RC4E SIMON OHM. 

sketched in rough outline, ure established even better by the truth of 
the law of the conduction of the current in metals here set forth, than 
they are by the ex])eriments themselves from which they were derived. 
Effects of the galvanic current anparently the most varied are reduced 
to a striking simplicity." 

What Ohm here and in the title calls " theory " is limited to the imme- 
diate consequences of his law determined inductively. It has nothing 
in method in common with the truly so-called "theoiy" which he pro- 
posed much later in his famous work, " The Galvanic Battery," and 
which lie evolved deductively upon premises and partly hypothetical 
considerations. 

It is hence perfectly clear that Ohm discovered his law in the purely 
empirical way. Six years later, October, 1831, Pouillet appeared in 
an article on the application of the thermal battery to the determina- 
tion of the law of intensities in a constant current. What Pouillet 
believed himself the first to do, had already been done by Ohm in the 
above article in the most complete manner. Kowhere in his article is 
there so much as a suggestion of a hypothetical consideration which 
might have intiuenced him in the choice of his mathematical expression. 
The fact above stated that the formula first proposed was wrong, affords 
the most striking proof that those theoretical considerations which 
enabled him later to deduce his law mathematically, were at that time 
quite remote. 

Ohm's name has been made immortal by this typical experimental 
treatise. It contains the discovery of the law of the intensity of the 
current, fully and completely, along Avith the most im^jortant conclu- 
sions to be deduced therefi'om. In view of this inherent value it is 
undoubtedly to be preferred to thfe other most important works of Ohm, 
even to that one most famous of all his writings, " The Galvanic Bat- 
tery Treated Mathematically," which lias always held the highest j)lace 
in public estimation. In that experimental investigation he robbed 
nature of her secret and announced that everlasting and immutable 
law of nature which will outlive all the variations of theoretical beliefs. 

A mind like that of Ohm, trained and accustomed mathematically to 
inquire into the causes of phenomena, must soon have felt the need of 
showing that what he had inductively recognized was deductively a 
necessary consequent of simple conceptions as to the way in which 
electricity aii]>ears at the i^oint of contact of different substances and 
disseminates itself in conducting materials. 

In the same year 1820 he published an article entitled : "Attempt at 
a theory of the electroscopic phenomena produced by galvanic forces." 
He reports the happy result of his endeavors in that he not only re-dis- 
covered, in this opposite way, the experimentally determined law of 
the intensities of current, but also found a second, no less important, 
the electroscopic law or law of tensions. 



THE SriENTIFIC AVORK OF GEORGE SIMON OHM. 251 

ThiscomnMiiiicatioii was Imt i\\v. precursor ol" thai classi<; woik so 
frequently referred to : " The Galvanic Battery Treated Mathematic- 
ally." This he produced in the quiet of a inucli needed v.acation, and 
puhlished in May, 18li7. 

In the introduction to this article he says his aim has been -'to 
dednce in connected sequence and from a few principles those elec- 
trical phenomena which are comprehended under the epithet galvanic; 
the purj)ose is accomplished if the variety of facts is subordinated to 
the simplicity of comprehension." Indeed he accomplished his purpose 
most comphjtely. Tie extended to electrical conduction the ideas of 
Laplace, Poisson, and especially Fourier on the conduction of heat, and 
(^'olved the laws of the electric current with the mathematical means 
wliich tliosc investigators had created for their own purposes. This 
thoughtful theory of Ohm stands to-day unshaken, — a comi^actly con- 
structed whole. In order to bring it into unison with the present views 
concerning electricity it is only necessary to remark that what Ohm 
calls " electroscopic lbr(;e" or ''tension" is nothing but electrical 
potential. 

The Laplace-Poisson equation, Avhich formed the basis of Ohm's de- 
ductions, shows indeed that in a conductor carrying constant electric 
currents, as well as in one in electric equilibrium, the free electricity is 
all distributed on the surface. The surface layer, however, in the case 
of th(^ currents sh(»ws a different distribution from that in the condition 
of eciuilibrium. Ohm, on the contrary, assumed that the free electricity 
was spread over the whole cross-section of the conductor carrying the 
current. Tliis assum])tion called forth many contradictions, because it 
was so foreign to the nature of electricity. By removing this contra- 
diction newer views, without changing in the least Ohm's formula or 
conclusions, have only served to establish the theory all the more firmly. 
The subseipient extension of his t]ie(ny, by its application to conductors 
of two and three dimensions, was an immediate generalization of his 
method of treatment which (Jhm himself foresaw; also, the enunciation 
in that well dig(;sted work of Ohm's on the non-conslant or charging 
and discharging currents, stands to-day in unchanged correctness. 

As has already been emphasized, the first discovery of Ohm's law as 
to tluMntensity of current is not contained in that master in vestiga- • 
tion. The law previously discovered and proven by experiment served 
oidy as the touchstone for the theory of which it appeared to be a 
necessary consequent. But the brilliancy of this theoretical accom- 
plisiiment threw his previous tedious work of em])irical investigation so 
into the shade that it is partly conceivable how the belief arose that 
Ohm mathematically deduced his hiw from debatable hyijotheses. 

^\t first Olim received no recognition fioni even this work. It 
received no attention in many circles; from many sides came sharp 
criticism; from only a few genuine approval. His hopes of being able

to follow an acadeiiiic career were dashed by liard disappoiutmeiit 
and lie resigned his j)osition as teacher at the gymnasium and retired, 
discouraged, to private life. The cramped position in which he now 
saw himself placed must have been depressing for his spirits. Still 
this period of six years which elapsed until his appointment as pro- 
fessor of physics in the polytechnic school, at Nuremberg, in 1833, was 
not entirely barren for science. In a series of articles, published 
mostly in Schweigger's Journal, he furnished renewed experimental 
proof of the law discovered by him. We find in these teeming articles 
the law of the branching of currents (Schweigger's Journal, 1827, vol. 
XLix)5 observations on the "fluctuations of force," on the poalariztion 
of electrodes and transition resistance, beside methods for determining 
galvanic resistance and electromotive force. An article from this period 
is especially worthy of notice as a model of experimental investigation, 
entitled "experiments on the more accurate comi^rehension of uni-polar 
conductors." In it he entirely explained, by a complete series of well- 
chosen experiments, the enigmatical phenomena of so-called uni-polar 
conduction. 

The above-mentioned article of Pouillet, in 1837, and the claim made 
in connection with it, finally brought Ohm's discovery to the attention 
of physicists at home and abroad. Especially in England was its far- 
reaching importance immediately recognized. The Eoyal Society, at 
its annual meeting of November 30, 1841, conferred upon the unassum- 
ing German scientist the gold medal which Copley had established as 
a prize for the most conspicuous discovery in the domain of exact inves- 
tigation. The medal was accompanied by a formal letter of presenta- 
tion, which points out in strong terms Ohm's services to galvanism, and 
which is no less an honor to the learnad society than to the recipient of 
the prize. Thus Ohm received abroad the tardy recognition which his 
native land had so long withheld. He gave touching exi)ression to 
his gratitude in the dedication of his work " Contributions to Molecular 
Physics " to the Eoyal Society of London, which by its words of ap- 
proval had given his courage new strength for continued strife in the 
field of science, weakened as it was by previous discouraging experi- 
ences. 

His creative genius, which seemed to lie fallow during the last years, 
awoke anew. Soon he was successful in a second great venture, this 
time in the field of acoustics, (upon which he had entered in 1839,) in a 
" Note on Combination Tones." In his article "On the Definition of 
Tone and a Consequent Theory of the Siren and Similar Tone-Producing 
Ai)paTatus," he established, in 1843, the law of acoustics also known 
by his name. Inasmuch as this law furnishes the clearest insight into 
the hitherto incomprehensible nature of musical tones, it dominates 
the acoustics of to-day no less completely than does his law of the 
electric current dominate the science of electricity. This law states 



THE SCIENTIFIC WORK OF GEOKGE SIMON OHM. 253 

that the hiimau ear perceives ouly pendulum-like vibration as a simple 
tone. Every other periodic motion it resolves into a collection of 
[)enduhun-like vibrations which it then hears in the sound as a series 
of single tones, fundamental and overtones. Ohia arrived at this law 
from mathematical considerations, making" use of Fourier's series; for 
its experimental veriftcation he was compelled to use the well-culti- 
^ated ear of a friend, inasmuch as he was himself entirely devoid of 
musical ear. 

Like his law of the current, this law of acoustics received no recog- 
idtion from his contemporaries. It was, in fact, opposed by Seebeck, 
one of the most prominent investigators in that field, as being an idea 
too foreign to the accustomed method of presentation. This law of 
Ohm was not accepted until Helmholtz furnished the experimental 
means which enables every even unskilled ear to resolve a sound into 
its simple partial tones; and eight years after Ohm's death completely 
revolutionized acoustics and the theory of music by that classic work, 
" The Science of the Perception of Sound," which is based on Ohm's 
law. 

In 1827, while Ohm was writing the appendix to his work, ''The 
Cralvanic Battery," certain ideas in regard to the ultimate structure of 
matter were forced upon him. " There are properties of space tilling 
matter which we are accustomed to look uj^on as belonging to it. 
There are other ])roperties which heretofore we were inclined to look 
upon as the visitors of matter which abide with it from time to time. 
For these proi>erties man has thought out causes if not foreign, at 
least not innate, and they i)ass as immaterial and yet independent 
things of nature, under the names of light, heat, electricity, etc. It 
nuist be possible to so conceive the structure of physical bodies that 
along with the properties of the first class, at the same time and neces- 
sarily those of the second shall be given." This thought appears to 
have been suggested by his broadly designed plan of ''Contributions to 
Molecular Physics." The recognition of the Royal Society gave him 
new courage for the carrying out of this work, but unfortunately it 
remains unfinished. His intention appears to have been, from certain 
definite assumptions concerningthe nature, form, size, and mode of action 
of the atom, to deduce, by the aid of analytical mechanics, all the phe- 
nomena above referred to. He desired to create a work that should be 
for the microcosm of the world of atoms, what Newton's " Principia " 
had become for the microcosm of heavenly space. Only the first vol- 
ume appeared. It was entitled '' Elements of Analytical Geometry of 
Space on a System of Oblicpie ( -o-ordinates," and contained only the 
mathematical introductin to the actual problem. A second volume was 
to have contained '"the dynamics of the structures of l)odies," and a third 
and fourth to be devoted to the physical investigation itself. 

Toward the end of 1849, in the midst of eager work upon his great 



254 THE SCIENTIFIC WORK OF GEORGE SIMON OHM. 

task, lie was called to Munich as curator of the mathematical and 
physical collection of the Eoyal Academy of Sciences. He was also to 
be adviser of the ministerial director of telegraphs, and was obliged to 
lecture on mathematics and jihysics as professor at the university* 
Thus for tlie man of sixty tlie desire of his youth was tardily fulfilled, too 
tardily and hence scarcely to the benefit of science. The manifold duties 
of his new sphere of activity prevented the com])letion of liis great 
work, and robbed posterity of the legacy which Ohm had intended to 
leave it from the rich treasxires of his thoughts. However, it is by no 
means true that this period at Munich was entirely without gain for 
science. Optics had always been a pet object of his activity. In 1840 
in Poggendorff's Annalen^ vol. xlix, he published a " Description of some 
simple and easily managed arrangements for making the experiment 
of the interference of light." In it he showed how French interference 
prisms whicli worked very well could be made from common plate glass ; 
indeed, how a simple strip from the edge of a piece of plate glass could 
be used for the purpose. In 1852 and 1853 in his great work, "Expla- 
nation of all perceivable interference phenomena of plates of miaxial 
crystals in plane-polarized light," he set himself the task of develop- 
ing in a most general way than had been done, the theory of these 
phenomena so rich in form and color. He arrived at a formula of great 
simplicity and beauty, and which covered all the individual coloi'S. 
This work has many points in common with one by Prof. Sangberg 
of Ohristiania, published complete in Norwegian in 1841, in the " Ma- 
gazin for Naturvidenskaberne" (natural sciences), and abstracted inl842 
in the first extra volume {Erganzunfjshand) of Poggendorff's Annalen. 
The title of Sangberg's work was, "Analysis of the isochromatic curves 
and the interference phenomena in combined miaxial crystals." Ohm 
first learned of this work after the completion of his own, which was, 
however, by no means rendered superfluous by Sangberg's. The plie- 
nomenaof elliptical interference rings which had led Ohm to his inves- 
tigation, had also been observed at the same time by Sangberg. 

Among the causes which i)revented Ohm from continuing and com- 
l)leting his molecular i)hysics was the writing of a text-book of physics 
for his students. In spite of the " aversion always felt to working out 
a text-book," he still felt imxielled to the work by having accepted the 
position of instructor. He accomplished the speedy completion of this 
thoroughly original work by lithographing his lectures as fast as they 
were delivered and giving copies f o his classes. The strain caused by 
so quick an accomplishment of so difficult a task had a bad effect upon 
his health, as he sadly acknowledges at the close of the i^reface of his 
text-book (Easter, IS.")!). One other expression in the text of the book 
dimly suggests his feeling that his strength was expended. As a result 
of repeated attacks of epilepsy, on July C, 1854, he yielded up that life 
which to its last breath was devoted to the search after truth. 



THE SCIENTIFIC WORK OF GEORGE SIMON OHM. 255 

We have thus far striven to sot forth in hasty outline wliatOlim has 
been to scienee, without mentioninj^- more of the other cirouinstances of 
liis life than were necessary to an understandinji' of his scientific serv- 
ices. This has seemed permissible because, on the one hand,Laniont in 
1855 delivered from this place an address which also covered the bio- 
graphical points of his career. On the other hand, another member of 
our acadenn', Privy Councilor von Jiauernfeind, a pupil and friend of 
the one immortalized, in his "Memorial address on Ohm,the physicist," 
has f^iven us a complete i)resentation of the life of his teacher, drawn 
from reliable sources and from personal acquaintance. 

The deeds of a scientist are his scientific investigations. Truth once 
disco\ered d()«»s not renmin shut up in the study or the laboratory. 
AVhen the moment comes it bursts its narrow bonds and joins the quick 
pulse of life. That which has been discovered in solitude, in the 
unselfish struggle for knowledge, in pure love of science, is often 
lated to be the mighty lever to advance the culture of our race. When 
nearly a hundred years ago (ialvani saw the frog's leg twitch under 
the intluence of two metals touching, who could have suspected that 
the force of natuie which caused those twitchings would transfer the 
thoughts of man to far distant lands, with lightning's speed, under the 
the waters of the 0(;ean — would even render audible at a distance the 
sound of the spoken word ! That this force of nature — after man by 
ceaseless investigation Imd learned to vastly increase its strength — 
would illuminate our nights like the vsun ! This enormous development 
of electro-technology, which ws have followed with amazement in the 
last decades, could only be accouiplished upon the firm fimndation of 
( )hurs law. For only he can govern a force of nature who has mastered 
its law. Ohm by wresting from nature her long-concealed .secret has 
])lacod the scepter of this dominion iu the hand of the present. 

This great service of Ohui and the fundamental im])ortance of his 
law, as well for the science as for the technology of electricity, are to-day 
generally recogni/ed. In order ])ermanently to honor his memory, the 
intern.itioiial congress of electricians, assembled at Paris in 1881, deter- 
luined to call ''an ohm" the unit of resistance to conduction, then fixed 
and now generally accepted, after the name of him who introduced this 
important conception into the science and technology of electricity. 
Thus it liapi)ens that the name of the modest scientist who never strove 
for show or glory is to-day upon the HjjS of the thousands who are busy 
in our highly develo])ed electro-teclinical industries. 

Although this ideal monument is the most beautiful and the most 
lasting, yet the <luty of gratitude seems to urge that i)OSterity, which 
lias gathered the rich fruit of his industry as an investigator, should 
also honor the memory of the great i>hysicist with a visible monument. 

This idea was suggested by the hundredth anniversary of Ohm's 
birth, which we are to-day tardily celebrating. In order to carry it 



256 THE SCIENTIFIC WORK OF GEORGE SIMON OHM. 

out, a committee was formed for the erection of an Ohm statue in 
Munich, the capital of his more particuhir fatherland, where in the 
evening of his life, after long- waiting, he found a sphere of activity 
worthy of himself. 

Our suggestion found lively approval and active furtherance not 
only within the boundaries of the German Empire, but far out beyond. 
Thus we may hope at no distant time there will arise in our capital a 
worthy monument, a visible witness of the glory of our great country- 
man, a witness also of the spontaneous gratitude of the nations.

made to the wonderful energy and ability of Liebig; to the great work which he 
did in founding organic chemistry, and to the immense stimulus which he gave, 
alike in his own country and in England, to scientific investigation in pure chemistry 
and in its applications to agriculture, physiology, and pathology. 

Very opportunely a ]>ortion of an autobiographical sketch in Liebig's own hand- 
writing has just come to light, in which he gives a most interesting account of the 
formation of his habits of thought, and of the development of his scientific activity. 
He also gives an amusing description of the lectures given in his student days by 
])rofessors of the deductive method. 

In his sixtieth year, we are told, Liebig wrote some biographical sketches which 
were laid aside and could not be found when he wished to resume them. They 
were never finished. A portion of the manuscript was found among some other 
l)apers in Litbig's handwriting, by his son, Dr. Georg Karon von Liebig, and has 
lieen published by the latter in the Deutsche Jxiindschau for January, 1891. Mr. E. 
K. Musjiratt has been good enough to lend me a copy which he leceived from his 
friend, the ]>reseut baron. 

T have endeavored to render it into English as literally as the difierence in t he idiom 
and modes of exi>res8ion in the two languages will ])erniit; and it is now made 
public in England by the kind ])erniission of the Deutsche Huixhchaii. 

His method of teaching and its remarkal)le success are worthy of attention at the 
present time, when technical education is occupying" no much of the public mind.]

258 JUSTUS VON LIEBIG. 

I did not fail to fetcii the books from the court library myself, I became 
accjuainted with the librarian, Hess, who occupied himself successfully 
with botany, and as he took a fancy to the little fellow, I got, through 
him, all the books I could desire for my own use. Of course the read- 
ing of books went on without any system. 1 read the books Just as 
they stood upon the shelves, whether from below upwards or from 
right to left was all the same to me; my 14-year-old head was like an 
ostrich stomach for their contents, and amongst them I fimnd side by 
side upon the shelves the thirty-two volumes of Macquer\s "Chemical 
Dictionary,'' Basil Valentine's "Triumphal Car of Antimony," Stahl's 
"Phlogistic Chemistry," thousands of essays and treatises in Gottling's 
and Gehleu's jjeriodicals, the works of Kirwan, Cavendish, etc. 

1 am quite sure that this manner of reading was of no particular use 
so far as acquisition of exact knowledge is concerned, but it developed 
in me the faculty, which is peculiai' to chemists more than to other 
natural philosophers, of thinking in terms of phenomena; it is not very 
easy to give a clear idea of phenomena to anyone who can not recall in 
his imagination a mental ])icture of what he sees and hears. — like the 
poet and artist, for example. Most closely akin is the peculiar power 
of the nuisician, who while composing thinks in tones which are as 
nnich conncM-ted by hiws as tlu^ logically arranged conceptions in a 
conclusion or series of conclusions. There is in the chemist a form of 
thought by which all ideas become visible to the mind as the strains of 
an imagined pie<'e of music. This form of thought is developed in Fara- 
day in the higlu\st degree, whence it arises that to one who is not ac- 
quainted with this method of thinking, his scientilic works seem barren 
and dry, and merely a series of researches strung together, while his 
oral discourse when he teaches or explains is intellectual, elegant, and 
of Avonderful clearness. 

The faculty of thinking in phenomena can only be cultivated if the 
mind is constantly trained, and this was effected in my case by my en- 
deavoring to perform, so far as my means would allow nu', all the ex- 
periments whose description I read in the books. These means were 
very limited, and hemte it arose that, in order to satisfy my inclination, 
1 repeated such experiments as 1 was able to make, a countless number 
of times, until 1 ceased to see anything new in the process, or till I 
knew thoroughly every aspect of the phenomenon which presented 
itself. The natural conse(|uence of this was the development of a 
memory of the sense, that is to say of the sight, a clear perception of 
the resemblances or differences of things or of phenouiena, which after- 
wards stood me in good st«'ad. 

One will easily understand this if one imagines, for instance, a white 
or colored precipitate which is i>ioduced by mixing two liquids; it is 
formed either at once or after some time, it is cloudy or of a curdy or 
gelatinous character, sandy or crystalline, dull or bright, it deposits 
e-A&iiy or slowly^ etc. ; or if it is colored it Ufis w certain tint, Amon^

tlie ('(miitlcss white i)i(.'(;ii)itatcs cacli has somethiii-j;- |tcculiar to itself; 
and when one has experience in this sort of ai>pearaiices, whatever one 
sees durinj? an investi<j;ation at once awakens the remembrance of what 
one has seen. The following example will make clear Avhat 1 mean by 
sight or eye memory. During our joint research on uric acid, AVohler 
one day sent me a ciystalline body which he had obtained by the action 
of i>eroxide of lead ui)on this acid. 1 immediately thereupon wrote to 
him with great joy, and, without having analyzed the body, that it was 
allantoin. Seven years before I had had this body in my hands; it had 
been sent to me by C. (Imelin for investigation, and 1 had i:)ublished 
an analysis of it in roggendorff's AwwaZew; since that time I had not 
seen it again. But when we had analyzed the substance obtained from 
nric acid there appeared a difference in the amount of carbon, the new 
body gave 1^ per cent carbon less, and since the nitrogen had been 
determined by the qualitative method a corresponding quantity (4 per 
cent) of nitrogen more; consequently it Could not possibly be allantoin. 
However, I trusted my eye memory more than my analysis, and was 
quite sure that it was allantoin, and the thing now to be done wfrs to 
lind the remains of the substance previously analyzed in order to 
analyze it afresh. 1 could describe the little glass in Avhich it was Avith 
such precision that my assistant at last succeededinxjickiugit (uitfrom 
amongst a couple of thousand other preparations. It looked exactly 
like our new body, except that examination under tlie lens show^ed that 
(Jmelin, in the jireparation of his allantoin, had pimfied it with animal 
charcoal, some of Avhich having passed through the paper in the filtra- 
tion had become mixed with the crystals. 

Without the complete conviction which 1 had that the two bodies 
were identical, the allantoin produced artificially from uric acid would 
undoubtedly have been regarded as a new body, and would have l)een 
designated by a new name, and one of the most interesting relations 
of uric acid to one of the constituents of the urine of the foetus of 
the cow would perhaps have remained for a long time unobserved. 

In this manner it came to pass that everything I saw remained inten- 
tionally or unintentionally fixed in my memory with equal ijhotographic 
fidelity. At a neighboring soap boiler's I saw the process of boiling 
soap, and learned A\hat "■curd soap'' and "fitting'' are, and how white 
soap is nuide; and I had no little pleasure when I succeeded in showing 
a ])iece of soap of my own making' perfumed with oil of turpentine. 
In the workshop of the tanner and dyer, the smith and brass founder, 
I was at home and ready to do any hand's turn. 

In the market at Darmstadt I watched how a peripatetic dealer in 
odds and ends made fnlminatingsilver for his pea-crackers. I observed 
the red va])ors which were formed when he dissolved his silver, and 
that lie added to it nitric acid; and then a liquid which smelled of 
brandy, and with which lie cleaned dirty coat collars for the people. 

With this beiit of mind it is easy to understand that my position at 



260 JUSTUS VON LIEBIG. 

school was very deplorable; 1 hiid uo ear memory, and retained nothing 
or very little of what is learned through this sense; 1 found myself in 
the most uncomfortable i)osition in which a boy could possibly be; 
languages and everything that is acc^uired by their means, that gains 
praise and honor in the school were out of my reach; and when the 
venerable rector of the gynmasium (Zimmernuinn), on one occasion of 
his examination of my class, came to me and made a most cutting 
remonstrance with me for my want of diligence, how I was the plague 
of my teachers and the sorrow of my parents, and what did I think 
was to become of me, and Avhen I answered him that I would be a 
chemist, the whole school and the good old man himself broke into an 
uncontrollable fit of laugliter, for no one at the time had any idea that 
chemistry was a thing that could be studied. 

Since the ordinary career of a gymnasiuui student was not o[)en to 
me, my father took me to an apothecary at Heppenheim, in tlie Hessian 
Bergstrasse; but at the end of ten months he Avas so tired of me that 
he sent me home again to my father. I wished to be a chemist, but 
not a druggist. The ten months sufficed to make me completely 
acquainted alike with the use and the manifold ai>i)lications of the 
thousand and one different things which are found in a druggist's 
shop. 

Left to myself in this way, without advice and direction, 1 completed 
my sixteenth year, and my persistent importunity at last induced my 
father to give me permission to go to the University of Bonn; whence 
1 followed to Erlangen the professor of chemistry, Kastner, Avho had 
been called to the Bavarian University. There arose at that time at 
the newly-established University of Bonn an extraordinary quickening 
of scientific life; but the degenerate philosophical methods of investi 
gation, as they had been embodied in Oken, and still worse in Wil- 
brand, had a most pernicious influence on the branches of natural 
science, for it had led alike in lecture and in study to a want of appre- 
ciation of experiment and of un])rejudiced observation of nature, which 
was ruinous to many talented young men. 

From the professional chair the pui)il received an abundance of 
ingenious contemplations; but, bodiless as tbcy were, nothing could be 
made of them. 

The lectures of Kastner, who was considered a most eminent chem- 
ist, were without order, illogical, and arranged just like the jumble of 
knowledge which I carried about in my head. The relations which he 
discovered between i^henomena were somewhat after the following 
pattern : 

"The influence of the moon upon the rain is clear, for as soon as the 
moon is visible the thunder-storm ceases," or " tlie influence of the 
sun's rays on Avater is shown by the I'ise of the water in the shafts of 
mines, some of which can not be worked in the height of summer." 
That we see the moon when the thunderstorm is dispelled, and that 



JUSTUS VON LIEBIG. 261 

the water rises in the mine wlien the brooks which drive the pumps 
dry up in summer, was, of course, too bhint an exphinatiou for a clever 
lecture. 

It was then a very wretched time for chemistry in (xermany. At most 
of the universities there was no special chair for chemistry ; it was gen- 
erally handed over to tlie professor of medicine, who taught it, as much 
as he knew of it, and that was little enough, along with the branches 
of toxicology, pharmacology, materia raedica, practical medicine, and 
pharmacy. 

Many years after this in (liessen, descriptive and comparative anat- 
omy, i>hysiology, zoology, natural history, and botany were in one 
single hand. 

While the labors of tlie great Swedish chemist, the English and 
French natural i)hilosophers, Humphry Davy, Wollaston, Biot, Arago, 
Fresncl, Thenard, and Dulong opened up entirely new sphere^ of inves- 
tigation, all these inestimable acquisitions found no soil in Germany 
where they could bear fruit. Long years of war had undermined the 
well-lnMng of the people, and external political pressure had brought 
in its train the desolation of our universities, tilled men with painful 
anxiety for many years, and turned their desires and their strength in 
other dii-ections. The natiomil spirit had asserted its freedom and 
indei)endence in i<leal spheres, and by the destruction of belief in 
authority had brought rich blessings in many ways, — for example, in 
medicine and philosophy; only in physiology it had broken through 
its natural limits and wandered tVir beyond experienc<\ 

The goal of scieftce and the fnct that it has value only when it is use- 
ful to life had almost droi)pcd out of sight, and men auuised themselves 
in an ideal world which h;id no connection with the real on<>. It was 
considei-ed an almost debasing sentiment, and one unworthy of an edu- 
cated person, to believe that in the body of a living being the crude ami 
vulgar inorganic forces ])layed any part. Life and all its manifesta- 
tions uiid conditions were perfectly clear. Natural phenomena were 
clot lied in bewitcliingly lovely dress, cut out and fitted by clever men, 
and this was called philosophical investigation. Experimental instruc- 
tion in chemistry was all but extinct at the universities, and only the 
highly-educated jdiariiiacists, Klaproth, Hermbstiidt, Valentin Rose, 
Trommsdortt", and Ijuehholz had themselves preserved it, but in another 
de])artnuMit. 

I remember at a unich later period. Prof. Wurzer, who held the chair 
of chemistry at Marburg, showing me a wooden table drawer, which 
had the i)roi>erty of producing (piicksilver every three months. He 
{)ossessed an apparatus which maiidy consisted of a long clay pipe 
stem, with which he converted oxygen into nitrogen by making the 
l)orous pipe stem red hot in charcoal, and passing oxygen through it. 

Chemical laboratories, in which instruction in chemical analysis was 
imparted, existetl nctwiu're at that time. What passed by that name 



262 JUSTUS VON LIEBIG. 

were more like kitchens tilled with all sorts of furnaces and utensils for 
the carrying- out of metallurgical or pharmaceutical processes. No one 
really understood how to teach it. 

I afterwards followed Kastner to Erlangeu, where he had promised 
to analyze some minerals with me; but unfortunately he did not him- 
self know how to do it, and he never carried out a single analysis 
with me. 

The beneht which I gained through intercourse with other students 
during my sojourn in Bonn and Erlangeu was the discovery of my 
ignorance in very many subjects which they brought with them from 
school to the university, and since I got nothing to do in chemistry I 
laid out all my energies to make up for my previously neglected school 
studies. 

In Bonn and Erlangeu small numbers of students joined with me in 
a chemico-physical union, in which every member in turn had to read a 
l)aper on the question of the day, which, of course, consisted merely in 
a report on the subjects of the essays which appeared monthly in Gil- 
bert's Annalen and Schweigger's Journal. 

In Erlangeu, Schelling's lectures attracted me for a time, but Schell- 
ing possessed no thorough knowledge in the province of natural science, 
and the dressing up of natural phenomena with analogies and in images, 
which was called exposition, did not suit me. 

I returned to Darmstadt fully x)ersuaded that 1 could not attain my 
ends in Germany. 

The dissertations of Berzelius — that is to say, thabetter translation 
of his handbook, which had a large circulation at that time — were as 
springs in the desert. 

Mitscherlich, H. Rose, Wohler, and Magnus had then repaired to Ber- 
zelius, in Stockholm; but Paris offered me means of instruction in many 
other branches of natural science, as, for instance, physics, such as could 
be found united in no other place. I made up my nund to go to Paris. 
I was then seventeen and a-half years old. My journey to Paris, the way 
and manner in which I came in contact with Thenard, Humboldt, 
Duloug, and with Gay-Lussac, and how the boy found favor in the sight 
of those men, borders on the fabulous, and would be out of place here. 
Since then it has frequently been my experience that marked talent 
awakens in all men, I believe I may say without exception, an irre- 
pressible desire to bring about its development. Each helps in his own 
way, and all together as if they were acting in concert; but talent only 
compels success if it is united with a Arm indomitable will. External 
hindrances to its development are in most cases very much less than 
those which lie in men themselves; for just as no one of the forces of 
nature, however mighty it may be, ever produces an effect by itself 
alone, but always only in conjunction with other forces, so a man can 
only make valuable that which he learns without trouble, or acquires 
readily, for which as we say, he has a natural gift, if he learns

ljessin<^- says tliat talent really is will and work, and I am \rry nnn-li 
inclined to agTee witli liim. 

Tlu' lectures of (lay-Lnssac, Tlienai'd, Dnionj;', etc., in the Sorbonne, 
Inul tor me. an imlescribable charm; th<^ introdnction ol" astronomical <n- 
nnithematical method into chemistry, wliichchanges every ju-oblem when 
possible intoauecpiation, and assumes in every nniformsequenceof two 
phenomena a quite certain connection of cause and etiect, which, after 
it has been searched for and discovered, is called '^ explanation" or 
" theory," had led the French chemists and physicists to their great 
discoveries. This kind of "theory" or "explanation" was as good as 
nidcnown in (rermany, for by these expressions was understood not 
something " experienced," but always something wiiich man must add 
on, and which he fabricates. 

French exposition has, through the genius of the hinguage, a logical 
clearness in the treatment of scientific subjects very difficult of attain- 
nu'nt in other languages, whereby Thenard and Gay-Lussac acquired 
a mastery in exi)erimeutal demonstration. The lecture consisted of a 
judiciously arranged succession of phenomena, — that is to say, of experi- 
ments, whose connection was completed bj^ oral explanations. The 
exjx'riments were a real delight to me, for they spoke to me in a lan- 
guage I understood, and they united with the lecture in giving definite 
connection to the mass of shapeless facts which lay mixed up in my 
head without order or arrangement. The anti phlogistic or French 
chenustry had, it is true, brought the history of chemistry before Lavoi- 
sier to the guillotine; but one observed that the knife only fell on the 
shadow, and I was much more familiar with the phlogistic writings of 
Cavendish, Watt, Priestly, Kirwan, Black, Scheele, and Bergmann, 
than with the auti-pldogistic; and what was represented in the Paris 
lectures as new and original facts appeared to me to be in the closest 
relation to previous facts, so much so, indeed, that when the latter were 
imagined away the others could not be. 

I recognized or (more correctly perhaps), the consciousness dawned 
upon me, that a connection in accordance with fixed laws exists not 
only between two or tluee, but between all chemical i)henomenain the 
mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms; that no one stands alone, 
but each being always linked with another, and this again with another, 
and so on, all are connected with each other, and that the genesis and 
disappearance of things is an undulatory motion in an orbit. 

What imi»ressed me most in the French lectures was their intrinsic 
truth, and the careful avoidance of all pretense in the explanations; it 
was the most complete contrast to the (xerman lectures, in which the 
whole scientific teaching had lost its solid construction through the 
preponderance of the deductive method. 



264 JUSTUS VON IvIEBIG. 

Au accidental occurreuce drew A. von Humboldt's attention tome in 
Paris, and the interest which lie took in me induced Gay-Lussac to com- 
plete in conjunction with nie a piece of work which I had begun. 

In this manner I had the good fortune to enjoy the closest inter- 
course with the great natural philosopher ; he worked with me as he 
had formerly worked with Thenard ; and I can well say that the foun- 
dation of all my later work and of my whole course was laid in his lab- 
oratory in the arsenal. 

I returned to Germany, where, through the school of Berzelius, H. 
Rose, Mitscherlich, Magnus, and Wohler, a great revolution in inor- 
ganic chemistry had already commenced. Through the support of von 
Humboldt's warm recommendation, an extraordinary professorship ot 
chemistry at Giessen was conferred upon me in my twenty-first year. 

My career in Giessen commenced in May, 1824. I always recall with 
pleasure the twenty-eight years which I spent there; it was as if Prov- 
idence had led me to the little university. At a larger university, or 
in a larger place, my energies wouhl have been divided and dissipated, 
and it would have been much more difficult, and perhaps impossible, 
to reach the goal at which I aimed, but at Giessen everything was con- 
centrated in work, and in this I took passionate pleasure. 

The need for an institution in which tlie students couldbe instructed 
in the art of chemistry, by which I mean familiarity with cliemical ana- 
lytical operations, and skill in the use of apparatus, was then being felt; 
and hence it happened that on the opening of my laboratory for teach- 
ing analytical chemistry and the methods of chemical research, students 
by degrees streamed to it from all sides. As the numbers increased I 
had the greatest difficulty with the i)ractical teachings itself. In order 
to teach a large number at one time it was necessary to have a system- 
atic plan, or step by step method, which had first to be thought out 
and put to the proof. 

The manuals which several of my ])upils have published later (Fres- 
enius and Will) contain essentially, with little deviation, the course 
which was followed at Giessen; it is now familiar in almost every labor- 
atory. 

The production of chemical preparations was an object to which I 
j)aid very i^articnlar attention; it is very much more important than is 
usually believed, and one can more frequently find men who can make 
very good analyses than such as are in a ])osition to produce a jmre 
preparation in the most judicious way. The formation of a preparation 
is an art, and at the same time a qualitative analysis, and there is no 
other way of making one's self acquainted with the various chemical 
properties of a body than by first producing it out of the raw material 
and then converting it into its numerous compounds and so becoming- 
acquainted with them. 

By ordinary analysis one does not learn by experience what an 
important means of separation crystallization is in skillful hands; and 



JUSTUS VON LIEBIG. 265 

Just as little the value of an acquaintance with the peculiarities of dif- 
ferent solvents. Consider only an extract of a plant or of flesh which 
contains half a dozen crystalline bodies in very small quantities embed- 
ded in extraneous matter, which almost entirely masks the properties 
of the others; and yet, in this niaj;ma, we can recognize by means of 
chemical reactions the i)eculiaritics of every single body in the mixed 
mass, and learn to distinguish what is a product of decomposition and 
what is not, in order to be able to separate them afterwards by means 
which will exert no decomposing influence. An example of the great 
ditflcuUy of finding tlie right way in such researches is afforded by the 
analysis of bile by Berzelius. Of all the numerous substances which 
he has described as its constituents no one is, propeily speaking, con- 
rained in the natural bile. 

An extremely short timi^ had been sulilicient for the famous pupils of 
the Swedish master to give a wonderful degree of perfection to mineral 
analysis which depends on an accurate knowledge of the properties of 
inorganic l>odies; their conipouiuls an<l their behavior to each other 
were studied in all directions by the Swedish school with a keenness 
(luite unusual previously and even uow unsurpassed. Physical chem- 
istry, which investigates the uniform relations between ])hysical prop- 
erties and chemical composition, had already gained a firm foundation 
by the discoveries of Gay-Lussac and von Humboldt, on the combining' 
proi)ortions of bodies in the gaseous state, and those of Mitscherlich, 
(Ml the relations between crystalline form and chemical composition; 
and in chemical proportions the structure appeared to have received its 
coping-stones and to stand forth com])leted. All that foreign countries 
had acquired in bygone times in the way of discoveries iu>w yielded 
rich fruit also in (lennany. 

Organic chemistry — or what is now called organic chemistry — had then 
no existence. It is true tliat Tlienard and Clay Lussac, Berzelius, 
I'rout, and Dobereiner had already laid the fouiulations of organic 
analysis, but even the great investigations of Ohevreul upon the fatty 
l>odies excited but little attention for many years. Inorganic chemistry 
demanded too much attention, aiul, in fact, mono])olize<l tlu^ best ener- 
gies. 

The bent wliich 1 acciuired in Tariswas in a ([uite different direction. 
Through the work wiiich (lay- Lussac had (h»ne with me ui)on fulmi- 
nating silver 1 was familiar with organic analysis, and I very soon saw 
that all progress in organic cliemistry depended essentially ui>on its 
sinqdification; for in this branch of <'hemistry oim^ has to do not 
with different elements wliich can be recognized by their i)eculiar proj)- 
erties, but always with the sanu' elements whose relative i»roportions 
and arrangement deteiinine the properties of (M'ganic coini)ounds. 

In organic ciuMiiistry an analysis is necessary to do that for which a 
reaction suffices in inorganic <-hemistry. 



266 JTTSTtTS VON LIEBTCI. 

The first years of my career iu Giesseii 1 devoted almost exclusively 
to the improvement of the methods of organic analysis, and the imme- 
diate result was that there began at this little university an <u;tivity 
which had never before been seen. 

For the solution of innumerable questions connected with plants and 
animals, on their constituents, and on the reactions accompanying' their 
transformation in the organism, a kindly fate brought together the most 
talented young men from all the countries of Europe, aiul any one can 
imagine what an abundance of facts and experiences I gained liom so 
many thousands of experiments and analyses, which were carried out 
every year, and for so many years, by twenty and more indefatigable and 
skilled young chemists. 

Actual teaching in the laboratory, of which practiced assistants took 
charge, was only for the beginners; the progress of my special students 
dei)ended on themselves. I gave the task and supervised the carrying 
out of it, as the radii of a circle have all their common center. There 
was no actual instruction; I received from each individual every morn- 
ing a report upon what he had done on the previous day, as well as his 
views on what he was engaged upon. I approved or made my criti- 
cisms. Every one was obliged to follow his own course. En the asso- 
ciation and constant intercourse with each other, and by each partici- 
pating in the work of all, every one learned from the others. Twice a 
week, in winter, I gave a sort of review of the most important questions 
of the day; it was mainly a report on my own and their work condjined 
with the researches of other chemists. 

We worked from break of day till nightfall. Dissipations and amuse- 
ments were not to be had at Giessen. The only complaint, which Avas 
continually repeated, was that of the attendant (Aubel), who could not 
get the workers out of the laboratory in the evening, when he wanted 
to clean it. 

The remembrance of this sojourn at Giessen awakened in most of my 
pupils, as I have frequently heard, an agreeable .sense of satisfiiction 
for well-spent time. 

I had the great good fortune, from the commencement of my career 
at Giessen, to gain a friend of similar tastes and similar aims, with 
whom, after so many years, I am still knit in the bonds of warmest 
affection. 

While in me the predominating inclination was to seek out the points 
of resemblance in the behavior of bodies or their compounds, he ])0S- 
sessed an unparalleled faculty of perceiving their differences. A keen- 
ness of observation was combined in him with an artistic dexterity, 
and an ingeniousness in discovering new means and methods of research 
or analysis such as few men possess. 

The achievement of our joint work upon uric acid and oil of bitter 
almonds has frequently been praised; it was his work. I can not suffi- 
ciently highly estimate the advantage which the association with Wohler 



JUSTUS VON LIEBIG. 2G7 

brought to me in the attaiiiuieut of my own as well as our mutual aims, 
(or hy that association were united the peculiarities of two schools — 
the good that was in each became effective by co-operation. With- 
out envy and without jealousy, band in hand, we ])ursued our way; 
wlien the one needed help, the other was ready. Some idea of this 
relationship may be obtained if 1 mention that many of our smaller 
pieces of work which bear our joint names were done by one alone; 
they were charming little gifts which one presented to the other. 

After sixteen years of the most laborious activity I collected the 
results gained, so far as they related to jdants and animals, in my 
" Chemistry Applied to Agriculture and Physiology," two years later 
ill my "Animal Chemistry," and the researches made in other directions 
ill my "Chemical Letters." The last-mentioned was generally received 
as a i>o] Hilar work, wiiich, to those who study it more closely, it really 
is not, or was not at the time when it appeared. 

Mistakes were made, not in the tacts, but in the deductions about 
organic reactions; we were the tirst pioneers in unknown regions, and 
the ditliculties in the way of keeping on the right path were sometimes 
insuperable. 

Now, when the paths of research are beaten roads, it is a much easier 
matter; but all the wonderful discoveries which recent times have 
brought forth were then our own dreams, whose realization we surely 
and witliout doubt anticipated.

von Humboldt's lodgings, and made the best excuses I could." The 
great traveller, satisfied with the explanation, told him it was unfortu- 
nate, as he had several members of the Academy at his house to meet 
him, but thought he could make it all right if he would come to dinner 
next Sunday. He went, and there made the acquaintance of Gay- 
Lussac, who was so struck with the genius and enthusiasm of the youth 
that he took him into his private laboratory, and continued, in conjunc-

DlVEliGENT E\ ULMTION THROUGH CUMULATIVE SEGRE- 
GATION.* 



By Rev. John Thomas GIilick. 



INTR01)U<rriON. 

In my study of Sandwich Island teriestiial niollusks, my attention 
was early arrested by the fact that wide diversity of allied species 
occurs within tlic limits of a single island and iu districts which pre- 
sent essentially the same environment. As my observations extended 
1 became more and more ini[>ressed with the improbability that these 
<livergences had been caused by differences in the environment. It 
was not easy to ])rove that sexual sekH'tion had no intluence; but, 
owin<( to the very low s^rade of intellip'nce possessed by the creatures, 
it seemed imj)ossible that the form and coloring;- of the shells should be 
the result of any such process. I was therefore led to search for some 
other cause of diNcrjient transformation, the diversity of whose action 
is not dependent on dilierences in luiture external to the organism. 

I found strong proof that there must be some such principle, not 
only in the many examples of divergence under uniform activities in 
the environment, but in the fact that the degrees of divergence between 
nearly allied forms are roughly measured by the number of miles by 
which they are separated, and in the fact that this correspondence 
between the ratios of distance and the ratios of divergence is not per. 
cei>tibly disturbed by passing over the crest of the island into a region 
where the rainfall is nuu'h heavier, and still further in the fact that the 
average size of the areas occupied by the species of any group varies, 
as we pass from group to group, according as the habits of the group 
are more or less favorable to migration. I perceived that these facts 
could all be harmonized by assuming that there is some cause of diver- 
gence more constant and i»otent than diflerences in nature external to 
the organism, and that the influence of this cause was roughly meas- 
ured by tlie time and degree of separation. 

During the sunnner of ISTl*, I prepared two pa})ers, in which these 
facts and opinions were presented. One of these, entitled " The Vari-

270 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

atiou <»t' Species as Kelated to their GeogTai)hieal Distribution, illus- 
trated by the Achatiuelliuie," was published in Waturctor July 18, 1872 ; 
the other, entitled '■'■ Diversity of Evolution under One Set of External 
Conditions," after being read before the British Association for the 
Advancement of Science in August, 1872, was, through the kindness 
of Mr. Alfred Wallace, brought before the Linuean Society, and was 
finally published in the Linnean iSociety\s Journal, ZooUxjy, vol. xi, i)p. 
406-505. 

In the former paper I used the following words in calling attention 
to the impossibility of explaining the origin and distribution of these 
forms by natural selection: "Whether we call the different forms 
species or varieties, the same questions are suggested as to how they 
have arisen and as to how they have been distributed in their several 
localities. In answering these questions, we find it difticult to point to 
any of those active causes of accumulated variation, classed by Darwin 
as natural selection. - - - There is no reason to doubt that some 
varieties less fitted to survive have disappeared; but it does not fol- 
low that the 'survival of the fittest' (those best fitted when compared 
with those dying i>rematurely, but equally fitted when compared witb 
each other) is the determining cause which has led to these three 
species being separated from each other in adjoining valleys. The '•sur- 
vival of the JittesV still leaves a problem concerning the distribution of those 
equally fitted. It can not be shown that the 'survival of the fittest' is 
at variance with the survival, under one set of external circumstances, 
of varieties differing more and more widely from each other in each 
successive generation. The case of the sy)ecies under consideration 
does not seem to be one in which difference of environment has been 
the occasion of different forms being preserved in the difi'erent locali- 
ties. It is rather one in which varieties resnlting from some other 
cause, though eqnally fitted to survive in each of the localities, have 
been distributed according to their aftinities in separate localities." 

In the latter i)aper I raised the following questions concerning iiat 
ural selection. "The terms 'natural selection' and ' survival of the 
fittest' - - - imply that there are variations that maybe accumu- 
lated according to the differing demands of external conditions. 
What, then, is the efiect of these variations wheu the external condi- 
tions remain the same! Or can it be shown that there is no change in 
organisms that is not the result of change in external conditions? 
Again, if the initiation of change in the organism is through change in 
the environment, - - - does the change expend itself in producing 
from cacli species just one new species conij)letely fitted to the conditions, 
or may it produce from one stocli many that are equally fitted f'' (p. 407). 
In answering these questions I called " attention to the variation and 
distribution of terrestrial mollusks, more especially those foimd on the 
Sandwich Islands," and gave what seemed to me strong reasons for 
believing that " the evolv/tion of these diffcrmt formic can not bv attrib- 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 271 

utcd to difference in their external conditions. - - - If wc would 
account for the ditteretu'c uud tlie limited distribution of these allied 
forms on the hypothesis of evolution from one original species, it ^.cems 
to me necessary to sujypose tiro conditions^ separation and variation. I 
regard separation as a condition of the species and not of surrounding 
nature, because it is a state of division in the stock which does not 
necessarily imply any external barriers j or even the occupation of separate 
districts. This may be illustrated by the separation between the castes of 
India, or between different genera occupying the same locality. - - - 
AVe must suppose that they [the diverging forms] must possess an in- 
herent tendency to variation so strong that all that is necessary to secure 
a direrf/ence of types in the descendants of one stock is to prevent^ through 
a series of generations, their inter m inf/Uiig with each other to any great 
degree " (pp. 498, 499). I also called attention to the fact that some 
forms of natural selection must '' prevent variation and give a wider 
ditlusion to forms that would otherwise be limited in their range and 
variable in tlieir type. Natural selection is as efficient in producing 
permanence of tyi)e in some cases as in accelerating variation in other 
cases" (p. ."iO-t). On page 499 I pointed out the law that ''the area 
occupied by any species must vary directly as its power and opportunity 
for migration, and inversely as its ])ower of [divergent] variation." 
And on page 505 1 gave a brief summary of my reasons for believing 
that " separation without a difference of external circumstances is a con- 
dition suffcient to ensure - - - divergence in type.'''' 

Subse(pient investigation has led to the development of my theory, 
with a fuller discussion of the causes and laws that are revealed in 
these phenomena. In an article published in The Chrysanthemum 
(Yokohama and London, Triibner & Co.), January, 1883, I state my 
belief '^ that the quality, the diversity, and the rapidity of ihe varia- 
tion depend chietly upon the nature of the organism ; and that while 
the nature of the external conditions has power to winnow out what- 
ever forms are least titted to survive, there icill usually remain a number 
oj' rarieties equnlly fitted to survive; and that through the law of segre- 
gation constantly operating in species distributed over considerable 
areas, these varieties continue to diverge both in form and in habits till 
st'])arate speci(;s are fully established, though the conditions are the 
same throughout the whole area occupied by the diverging forms." 
The conclusion reached was that '' The theory that diversity of natu- 
ral selection is, like variati<m, an essential factor in producing diversity 
of species, is unteuabh'. On the contrary, we find that diversity of 
natural selection is not nc^cessary to diversity of evolution, nor uni- 
tbrmity of natural selection to uniformity of evolution; but while 
variation and separation are the essential factors in diversity, and inter- 
crossing and unity of descent the essential agents in uniformity of 
evolution, natural selection may be an important ally on either side." 

in an article ou '' Evolution in the Organic World," published iu 



272 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

The Chinese Recorder (Shanghai), July, 1885, 1 use the following lan- 
guage: " "We see what natural selection can not explain by considering 
the nature of the process. The survival of the fittest results in the 
separate breeding of the fittest, and therefore in the increasing fitness 
of successive generations of survivors; hut how can it account for the 
division of the survivors of one stock, occupying one country, into forms 
differing more and more widely from each other f To explain such a result 
we must find some other law. I am prepared to show that there is such a 
law arising out of the very nature of organic activities, a, law of segrega- 
tion, hringing together those similarly endowed and separating them from 
those differently endowed.'''' 

Without variation there can be no segregate breeding; and with- 
out segregate breeding and heredity there can be no accumulation of 
divergent variations resulting in the formation of races and species. 
In producing divergent evolution the causes of variation and heredity 
are therefore as imj)ortant as the causes of segregate breeding; and 
though I pass them by in my present discussion, I trust it will not be 
attributed to an underestimate of their importance. Though I do not 
stop to discuss the causes of variation, my reasoning rests on the 
observed fact that in every deparment of the organic; world variation 
is found, and that in the vast majority of cases, if not absolutely in all, 
the diversities to which any freely inter- generating group of organisms 
is subject follow the general law of " frequency of deviation from an 
average." As this is a law according to which half of the members of 
the inter- generating group are above and half below the average in rela- 
tion to any character, there must often occur simultaneous variation of 
several individuals in some character which tends to produce segregate 
breeding. The reality and importance of this law is not at all depend- 
ent on the reality of any of the theories of heredity and variation that 
are now being discussed. Whatever may be the causes that produce 
variation, whether they depend entirely upon changes in external con- 
ditions or are chiefly due to changing activities in the organism and 
the hereditary effects of acquired characters, or are (as Weismann main- 
tains) the direct result of sexual reproduction Avhich never transmits 
acquired characters — in any and every case this law of deviation from 
an average remains undisturbed and is recognized as an important fac- 
tor in the present paper. It therefore can not be urged that the theory 
here advanced assumes simultaneous variation without any ground for 
making such an assumption ; nor can it be said that it rests on the 
incredible assumption that chance variation of very rare kinds will be 
duplicated at one time and place and will represent both sexes. 

Moritz Wagner first discussed what he calls ''The law of the migra- 
tion of organisms," in a paper read before the Royal Academy of 
Sciences at Munich, in March, 18G8; but my attention was not called 
to it till after the reading of my paper before the British Association 
in August, 1872. In a fuller paper entitled " The Darwinian Theory 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 273 

and tlie Law of the Mioratiou of Organisms," an English translation 
of which M-as ])ublislK'<l by Edward Stanford (London, 1873), the same 
antlior maintains that ''the constant tendency of individuals to wander 
from the station of their species is absolutely necessary for the forma- 
tion of races and species" (p. 4). "The migration of organisms and 
tlieir colonization are, according to my conviction, a necessary con- 
dition of natural selection" (p. 5). On pages 06 and 67 he expands 
the same statement, and objects to Darwin's view " that on many large 
tracts all individuals of the same species have become gradually 
changed." Again, he contends that "transformation is everywhere 
and always dependent on isolation in order to have lasting effect. 
Without separation from the home of the species, this wonderful 
capacity would be completely neutralized" (p. 74). <' Natural selection 
is not in itself an unconditional necessity, but is dependent on migra- 
tion and geographical isolation during a long period, together with 
altered conditions of life" (p. 57). " Where there is no migration, that 
is, where no isolated colony is founded, natural selection can not take 
place" (p. 59). 

A comparison of his paper with my two papers published in 1872, 
alieady referred to, will show several fundamental differences in the 
two theories. lie maintains that — 

(1) The separation of a few individuals from the rest of the species is 
absolutely necessary for the operation of natural selection, and there- 
fore for any transformation of the species, no matter how great the 
change of conditions may be in the original home of the species. 

(1*) Migration and geographicjal barriers are the only effectual 
causes, iiulependent of human action, by which a few individuals can 
be separated from the rest of the species, and are therefore necessary 
to the transformation of species. 

(3) Exposure to a new form of natural selection is a nc^cessary con- 
dition for any transformation of a s])ecies. 

(4) Difference of external conditions is necessary to difference of 
natural selection, and therefore necessary to any transformation of 
species. 

(5) (icographical isolation and altered conditions ot life are necessary 
conditions for natural selection, as that is for the modification of spe- 
cies. 

((») The separation of which he speaks is the entering of a few indi- 
viduals into a new territory, where the conditions are different from 
thos*' ill the old habitat, and where the body of the species fail of reach- 
ing them. 

My chief positions were the follow iiig, in strong contrast with the fore- 
going— 

(1) Separate generation is a necessary condition for divergent evolu- 
tion, but not for the tiansforniatioii of all thesurvivors of a species in 
one way. 

il. Mis. :VM. ])t. 1 18 



274 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

(2) '' Separation does not necessarily imply any external barriers, or 
even the occupation of separate districts." 

(3) Diversity of natural selection is not necessary to diversity of 
evolution. 

(4) Difference of external conditions is not necessary to diversity of 

evolution. 

(5) " Separation and variation," that is, variation not overwhelmed 
by crossing, "is all that is necessary to secure a divergence of types in 
the descendants of one stock," though external conditions remain the 
same, and thougb the separation is other than geological. 

(G) The separation of which I speak is anything, in the species or in 
the environment, that divides the species into two or more sections 
that do not freely inter-cross, whether the different sections remain in 
the original home or enter new and dissimilar environments. 

Though these propositions were very briefly and imperfectly pre- 
sented, I am not aware that any better statement of the facts of segre- 
gation had been previously published. 

The present paper is the result of a long-continued endeavor to un- 
derstand the relations in which this factor stands to natural selection 
and the other causes that co operate in producing divergent evolution; 
and though my work has been done under the great disadvantage of 
entire separation from libraries and from other workers in similar lines, 
I trust it may contribute something towards the elucidation of the sub- 
ject. In expanding my theory I have been unable to make any use of 
the positions taken in Moritz Wagner's paper, as they seem to me very 
extreme and far removed from the tacts of nature. The two theories 
correspond chiefly in that they discuss the relation of separation to the 
transformation of species, while the explanations given of the nature, 
causes, and effects of separation widely differ. I am informed that my 
paper on " Diversity of evolution under one set of external conditions " 
was translated and circulated in Germany; but whether it had any 
effect in modifying Wagner's theory I have not the means of knowing. 

I have recently discovered that the principle of segregate breeding, 
which I have found to be of such importance in the evolution of species. 
Is allied to the law of segregation propounded by Spencer in his "First 
Principles." By direct consideration of the conditions that have been 
found necessary for the development of divergent races of domestic 
l>lants and animals I have discovered segregate breeding as a neces- 
sary condition for divergent evolution, and by direct observation on the 
propagation of plants and animals under natural conditions I have dis- 
covered cumulative segregation as a constant result from certain forms 
of activity in the organism when dealing with a complex environment. 
Jt is therefore with special pleasure that I observe thatalaw of very simi- 
lar import may be derived by a wholly different method from the general 
laws of action and reaction in the physical world. It should, however, 
be noticed that in the brief references made to the subject in Spencer's 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 275 

^'Principles of Biology ''* it is assumod that "increasingly definite dis- 
tinctions among- variations are produced wherever thereoccur <lefinite]y- 
distinguished sets of conditions to which the varieties are respectively 
subject,'' and only where these occur; for " Vital actions remain con- 
stant so long as the external actions to which they correspond remain 
constant"; and noreference isanywhere made to the principle that what- 
ever causes sexual sei)aration between dissimilar mend)ers of one family, 
race, or species tends not ojdy to perpetuate, but to increase their dis- 
similarity in the succeeding generations. The view maintained in the 
following paper is I believe in better accord with the fundamental prin- 
cii)lethat '^ Unlike units of an aggregate are sorted into their kinds and 
parted when uniforndy subject to the same incident forces,"t as is also 
the teaching of Spencer's " Principles of Biology," in one passage; for I 
have recently discovered that in a single paragraph of this work it is 
maintained that while exposed to the same external conditions, the 
members of the same species may be increasingly difterentiated, " until 
at length the divergence of constitutions and modes of life become great 
enough to lead to segregation of the varieties."! If the segregation had 
been introduced as a necessary condition without which the divergence 
of families and races could not take place, the position taken in this 
paragraph would have been essentially the same as the one I have 
adopted. In the next section, however, he abandons the position, using 
the following words: " Through the process ot differentiation and inte- 
gration, Avhich of necessity brings together, or keeps together, like indi- 
viduals, and separates unlike ones from them, there must nevertheless 
he mamiained a tolerably uniform species, so long as there continues a 
tolernhh/ nniform set of conditions in which it may exist. [The italics are 
mine.] 

I trust my endeavor to contribute something toward the development 
of the theory of divergent evolution Avill not be attributed to any lack 
of appreciation of what has already been accomplished. The pro- 
pounders of a doctrine which has profoundly influenced every depart- 
ment of modern thought need no praise from me; but as their theoiy is 
confessedly inc^omplete, and as one of the leaders in the movement has 
called attention to the need of a le- discussion of the fundamental ftictors 
of evolution, I offer my suggestions and amendments after prolonged 
and careful study. 

PHYSIOLOGICAL SELECTION AND SEGREGATE FECUNDITY. 

The abstract of Mr. Itomanes's paper on "Physiological selection," 
given in Xaturr Augusts, 12, and 19, 1886, did not come into my hands 
till the following January, when my theory of divergent evolution

276 ])IVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

since tlie publication of my paper on '• Diversity of evolution under 
one set of external conditions, " was for the most part written out in 
its present form. Since then, and with reference to the discussion on 
physiological selection, I have worked out the algebraic formulas given 
in the last chapter, and have introduced explanations of the same; but 
at the same time I have removed several chapters in which the principle 
of selection was discussed at length, and have endeavored to bring the 
whole within a compass that would allow of its being published by some 
scientific society. In order to attain this end, I reserve for another 
occasion a discussion of the principles of intensive segregation, under 
which name I class the different ways in which other principles com- 
bine with segregation in producing divergent evolution. 

It was my intention to bring together examples of the diflerent forms 
of Segregation discussed, that they might be published with the theo- 
retical part; but the large number of pages found necessary for even 
the briefest presentation of the principles involved, and the fact that 
Mr. Eomanes's paper has appeared relating to some of the same prob- 
lems, leads me to present the results of my studies without further 
delay. The facts on which large portions of my theory rest are of the 
most familiar kind, and no additional light would be gained though 
their numbers were multiplied a hundredfold. Indeed, one of the 
marked features of my theory is that in its chief outlines it rests on 
facts that are universally acknowledged. The aim of the theory is to 
show the connection of these facts with divergent evolution. 

Though many divergencies appear in our method of treating the sub- 
ject, the fundamental theory underlying my segregate fecundity and 
Mr. Romanes's Physiological Selection seems to be very similar, if not 
the same. The most important differences I have noticed are, (I) that he 
seems to regard mutual sterility as sufficient to account for the separate 
propagation of species and varieties thus characterized, without calling 
in the aid of any other form of segregation, while I regard it as a neg- 
ative form of segregation that Avould result in the general destruction 
of all life if not associated with what I call positive forms of segrega- 
tion; and (2) that he maintains that "Physiological selection is almost 
exclusively a theory of the origin of species, seeing that it can but 
very rarely have had anything to do with the formation of genera, and 
can never have had anything at all to do with the formation of fami- 
lies, orders, or classes. Hence the evidence which we have of the evo- 
lutionary influence of physiological selection, unlike that which we 
have of the evolutionary influence of natural selection, is confined 
within the limits of specific distinctions,"* while I maintain that segre- 
gation of some forni is a necessary condition for all divergent evolu- 
tion, and that in fact segregate fecundity in many cases prevents the 
inter-crossing of divergent forms that, though descended from a com- 
mon stock, now belong to different families and orders. 

* Linn. Soc, Journ., Zoology, vol. xix, p. 396. 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 277 

The first of these differences, though of considerable importance, is 
I think due to the method of presentation rather than to any fimda- 
mental discrei)ancy in the theories. The positive forms of segregation 
arc 1 judge assumed to be present, though their co-operation is not 
distinctly recognized as a necessary condition for the breeding of forms 
that are mutually sterile. 

1 nuist, however, confess that I do not see how to reconcile his state- 
ment that "Physiological selection can never have had anything at all 
to do with the formation of families, orders, or classes" with what I 
believe to be the tacts concerning Segregate Fecundity; and if j)hysio- 
logical selection is to be understood as including Seasonal and perhaps 
other forms of Segregation, this passage seems to be still more opposed 
to the principles of divergent evolution as I understand them. He cer- 
tainly could not have intended to say that mutual fertility between 
allied genera not otherwise segregated would not have stood in the 
way of their becoming different families, and that, therefore, mutual 
sterility has had nothing to do with their continued divergence; still 
he seems to have failed to perceive the important influence this prin- 
ciple must have had on the divergent evolution of the higher groups of 
organisms. 

The correspondences in the two papers are, notwithstanding, more 
remarkable than the differences. Of these, the most conspicuous is the 
use of the word segregation to express the principle under considera- 
tion.* As I have already pointed out, I used this word for the same 
l)urpose in an article in the Chrysanthomim, published in January, 
1883; and again in the Chinese Recorder for July, 1855, where I spoke 
of the "law of segregation rising out of the very nature of organic 
activities, bringing together those similarly endowed," and causing " the 
division of the survivors of one stock, occupying one country, into forms 
differing more and more widely from each other." 

I trust that my discussion of the various forms of segregation, both 
negative and positive, though presented in so condensed a form, will 
throw light on the subject of the mutual sterility of species; and that 
in other ways my presentation of the subject will contribute something, 
not only to the theory of physiological segregation but to other branches 
of the general theory of evolution. 

I should here acknowledge (what will, I think, be manifest on every 
])age of my paper) that my obligations to Darwin and Wallace are far 
greater than are indicated by quotations and references. 

1 very much regret that I have failed of obtaining a copy of " Evolu- 
tion without Natural Selection," by Charles Dixon; but, from his letter 
in N((tnre, vol. xxxiii, p. 100, T see that he maintains ''That isolation 
can preserve a non-beneticial variation as effectually as natural selection 
can preserve a beneficial variation." He does not there refer to the fact,

which 1 emijhasize, that all divergence of a permanent character, 
whether beneficial or non-beneficial, is dependent on se- generation, 
either separative or segregative. 

PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS. 

Believing that great obscurity has often been introduced into the dis- 
cussion of biological subjects by the use of terms of uncertain import, 
I have endeavored to obtain greater precision by giving definitions of 
the terms I have introduced; and for the sake of indicating what words 
are thus used with special and definite meanings, they have been dis- 
tinguished by capitals. A few of these definitions are here given, and 
others will be given in the body of the paper. 

An Inter-generant, or Inter-generating Group, is a group of individuals 
so situated and so endowed that they freely cross with each other. 

tie-generation^ or Independent Generation. In harmony with the funda- 
mental doctrines of evolution, I assume that each si)ecies was atone time 
a single inter-generant; but we find that many species are now divided 
into two or more inter-generants, between which there is little or no 
inter-crossing. This state of freedom from crossing I call Se-generation. 
Se-generation is of two kinds, Sej)arate Generation and Segregate Gen- 
eration. 

Separate generation, or separation, is the indiscriminate division of 
a species into groups that are prevented from freely crossing with each 
other. 

Segregate generation, or segregation, is the inter- generation of similar 
forms and the prevention of inter- generation between dissimilar forms. 

Select generation, or selection, is the xDartial or complete exclusion of 
certain forms from the opportunity to propagate, while others succeed 
in propagating. The generation of any form is select with reference to 
the non-generation of forms that fail of propagating, and segregate vfith 
reference to the generation of forms that propagate successfully, but 
separately. 

Adaptational selection is exclusive generation that depends upon supe- 
rior adaptation either to the environment or to other members of the 
same species. 

Natural selection is the exclusive generation of those better fitted to 
the natural environment, resulting from the failure to generate of those 
less fitted. 

Artificial selection is the exclusive generation of those better fitted to 
the rational environment. 

Reflexive selection is the exclusive generation of those better fitted to 
the relations in which the members of the same species stand to each 
other. Sexual, social, and institutional selection are forms of reflexive 
selection. 

The environment is nature lying outside of the inter-generant. The 
influence of the environment is the sum of the influences that fiill upon

same species only when these nuMubers are so near that they exert an 
intiuence through competition or otherwise, while at the same time they 
are so far ditterentiated that they do not inter-cross ; in other words, tlie 
members of the same species can mutally belong to the environment 
only when they have acquired some of the characteristics of independ- 
ent species. The same euvu^onment extends as far as the activities 
that affect or may affect the species extend withont undergoing' change.

Change in the oryanisnt, whether producing new adaptations to the

In as far as any theory of evolution fails of giving an explanation of 
divergence of character, in so far it fails of explaining the origin of 
species. This is the crucial test Avhich must decide tlie strength or 
weakness of every theory that is brought forward to account for the 
derivation of many species from one cu^ginal species. A satisfactory 
theory will not only ])<)int out the conditions on which diveigence 
depends, but will show that these conditions are the natural lesult of 
causes that are already recognized by science as having iiirinencc in 
the (trganic world, or that are now shown to have such intbicnce.

advantage of divergence of character/' nor '' difference of external 
conditions," nor all these taken together, uor any form of selection 
that may be hereafter discovered, is sufficient to account for diver- 
gence of character, but that another factor of equal if not superior 
importance must be recognized. In subsequent chapters I shall try to 
trace the causes on which this additional factor depends, and to indi- 
cate as far as possible the hnvs and relations under which they appear. 

DIVEIKIENT EVOLUTION NOT EXPLAINED BY NATURAL SELECTION. 

Katural selection is the exclusive generation of certain forms through 
the failure to live and propagate, of other kinds that are less adapted 
to the environment. 

In the case of the breeder, no selection avails anything that does not 
result in some degree of exclusion. In the case of natural selection, 
where we are not considering ineffectual intentions, the selection is 
measured by the exclusion. Where there is no exclusion there is no 
selection, and where the exclusion is great the selection is severe. 
Moreover it is self-evident that there can be no crossing between the 
best fitted that survive and propagate and the least fitted that perish 
without propagating. To this extent, therefore, the prevention of 
crossing is complete. And further, it is evident that those whose 
meager fitness gives them but little opportunity for propagating will 
have a correspondingly diminished opportunity for crossing with the 
best fitted; and so on through the different grades ot fitness, thepower 
to affect the next genneration through having a share in propagating 
will measure the power to affect the progeny of the best fitted by cross- 
ing with them. It therefore follows that the freest crossing of ^Iie fit- 
test is with the fittest. 

Natural selection therefore proves to be a process in mhich the fittest 
are prevented from crossing with the less fitted through the exclusion of 
the less fitted, in proportion to their lack of fitness. Through the pre- 
mature death of the least fitted, and the inferior propagation of the 
less fitted, there arises a continual prevention of crossing between the 
less fitted and the better fitted; and without this separation the trans- 
forming influence of the laws of organic life would have no power to 
operate. As Darwin has pointed out, the results produced by this 
removal of the less fi-tted and separate propagation of the better fitted 
closely correspond with those produced by the breeder, who kills off 
the less desirable individuals of his stock before they have an oppor- 
tunity to breed. The selection of the breeder avails nothing unless it 
leads to the determining of the kind that shall breed; and this he can 
not accomplish without preventing free crossing with those that he 
does not desire. Tie must use some method to secure the separate 
breeding of the form that he desires to propagate. We therefore find 
in both natural and artificial selection the same fundamental method. 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 281 

111 either case, the kind that is to propagate is determiued by the 
selection, and those that are not to propagate are in some way ex- 
chided. The process may therefore be called the exclusive breeding 
of certain kinds; smd natural select io)i may be defined as the exclusive 
hrei'dlmj of those better adapted to the environment. 

But if from one stock of horses we wish to develop two distinct 
breeds, one of which shall excel in fleetness and the other in strength 
for carrying or drawing burdens, the result will not be gained by simply 
preveutiug all that are inferior in strength or fleetness from breeding. 
By this ])rocess, Avhich is the exclusive breeding of the desired kinds, 
we should obtain one breed with fair powers of strength and fleetness; 
but the highest results in either respect woidd not be gained. Such 
experiments show that the exclusire breeding of other than average forms 
c<iuses monotypic erolution, and that to secure divergent or polytypic evolu- 
tion some other principle must be introduced. 

In the case of natural selection, the separation it introduces is between 
the living and the dead, between the successful and the unsuccessful. 
In other words, natural seletition is the exclusion of all the forms that 
through lack of adaptation to the environment fail of leaving j)rogeny, 
and therefore in the exclusive generation of the forms that through 
better adaptation to the environment are better able to propagate. 
Variation with the natural selection of other than average forms may there- 
fore account for the transformation of an ancient species into a series of 
successive species, the last of which may now exist in full force; but with- 
out the aid of se-generation it ivill by no means account for the divergent 
evolution of any one of these species into a family of coexisting species. 

As I have just shown, natural selection is the exclusive generation 
of those better fitted to the environment; and it tends to the modifica- 
tion of s[)ecies simply through the generation of the better fitted forms, 
while they are prevented from crossing with the less fitted, which fail 
of propagating through their lack of fitness. N^ow, from the very nature 
of this process, which results from the success and failure of individuals 
in appropriating the resources of the environment, it follows that it 
can not be the cause of separation between the successful competitors, 
and therefore any divergence of character that arises between the differ- 
ent groups of the successful can not be attributed to natural selection. 
Natural selection explains the prevention of crossing between the fitted 
and the unfitted, and shows how the successive generations of a species 
may gradually depart from the original type, becoming in time a differ- 
ent species ; but it can not explain the divergences that arise between those 
that have, by the fact of successful propagation, proved their fitness. It 
depends on superiority of adaptation to the environment, and tends to 
produce increasing adaptation ; hxit divergent kinds of adaptation are not 
necessary conditions for it, and it can not be the cause of increasing 
divergence beticeen the incipient kinds that otherwise arise. 



282 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

DIVERGENT EVOLUTION NOT EXPLAINED BY ''THE ADVANTAGE OP 
DIVERGENCE OF CHARACTER." 

Two sections of the fourth cliapter of the "Origin of species" are 
given to the discussion of the " principle of benefit being derived from 
divergence of character," which it is maintained " will generally lead 
to the most different or divergent variations being preserved and accu- 
mulated by natural selection." Now, it can not be doubted that ability 
to appropriate unused resources would be an advantage to any members 
of a community pressed for food; but I do not see how the divergence 
that would enable them to appropriate, for example, a new kind of food 
can be accumulated while free crossing continues j and natural selection 
can not prevent the iree crossing of competitors who leave i)rogeny. 

Having found that the evolution of the fitted is secured through the 
prevention of crossing between the better fitted and the less fitted, can 
we believe that the evolution of a special race, regularly transmitting 
a special kind of fitness, can be realized without any prevention of cross- 
ing with other races that have no power to transmit that special kind of 
fitness? Can we suppose that any advantage, derived from new pow- 
ers that prevent severe competition with kindred, can l)e permanently 
transmitted through succeeding generations to one small section of the 
species while there is free crossing equally distributed between all the 
families of the species? Is it not apparent that the terms of this sup- 
position are inconsistent with the fundamental laws of heredity ? Does 
not inheritance follow the lines of consanguinity, and when consan- 
guinity is widely diffused, can inheritance be closely limited ? When 
there is free crossing between the families of one species, will not any 
peculiarity that appears in one family either be neutralized by crosses 
with families possessing the opposite quality, or being preserved by 
natural selection, while the opposite quality is gradually excluded, will 
not the new quality gradually extend to all the branches of the species, 
so that, in this way or in that, increasing divergence of form will be 
prevented? 

If the advantage of freedom from competition in any given variation 
depends on the possession, in some degree, of new adaptations to unap- 
propriated resources, there must be some cause that favors the breed- 
ing together of those thus specially endowed, and interferes in some 
degree with their crossing with other variations, or, failing of this, the 
special advantage will in succeeding generations be lost. As some 
degree of independent generation is necessary for the continuance of 
the advantage, it is evident that the same condition is necessary for 
the accumulation through natural selection of the powers on which the 
advantage depends. The admntage of divergence of character can not 
he retained by those that fail to retain the divergent character; and diver- 
gent character can not he retained by those that are co7istantly crossing 
with other Unas; and the prevention of free crossinq between those that 
are equally successful is in no way secured by natural selection. 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 283 

NATURAL SELECTION WITH GREAT DIFFERENCE IN EXTERNAL CON- 
DITIONS NOT SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN DIVERGENT EVOLUTION. 

The insufficiency of natural selection without se-generation to account 
for divergent evolution in an area where the external conditions are 
nearly uniform may be admitted by some who will claim that the case 
is quite otherwise when a species ranges freely over an area in which 
it is subjected to strongly contrasted conditions. It may be claimed 
that diversity of natural selection resulting from a great difference in 
external nature is snffici(!nt to account for divergent evolution without 
any se-generation. 

In the dis(uission of this subject important light can be gained l)y 
referring to the experience of the breedei". This cx])erience, in as far 
as it relates to tlie subject of separation in the production of divergent 
breeds, may be arranged under three heads: First, diversity of selec- 
tion without Reparation; secon<l, separation Avitlumt diversity of selec- 
tion ; third, separation more or less complete with diversity of selection. 

As the full discussion of these points is impossible here, and as there 
is i)robably but little difference of opinion in regard to what the results 
wcmld be, 1 shall content myself with a simi)le statement of what I 
believe the experience of breeders shows. Difference in the standards 
of selection Avithout separation can avail nothing in creating diver- 
geneeof types; while separation without difference in the standards of 
selection will avail something, though food and external conditions are 
kept the same; but to secure the greatest divergence in a given time, 
tliere must be both diversity of selection and complete separation. In 
the case of separation without diversity of selection, there is room for 
difference of opinion; for the examples that some would claim as prov- 
ing that there is often divergence without diversity of selection and 
without difference in external conditions may be attributed by others 
to unconscious selection. It is granted by everyone that no skill in 
selecting the animals that possess the desired qualities will have any 
effect in establishing a new breed unless the selected animals are pre- 
vented from breeding with others that are deficient in the desired qual- 
ities. We further find that while separation, is an absolutely essential 
condition for this divergeiu'C, diversity of selection is not so essential. 
This is illustrated in the case of the slightly different types that are 
presented by the wild cattle found in the different parks of England,* 
a ]>henonu^non which can hardly be attributed to any diversity in the 
environment. 

In artilicial breeding universal experience teaches that variation and 
selection, without separation, do not produce divergence of races. The 
separate breeding of different classes of variation is a necessary condi- 
tion for the accumulation of divergent variation; and wherever the 
separate breeding of different classes of variation is secured there diver- 

* See Darwin's " Vaiiatiou iiiKler Donicstieation," chapter xv, second page. 



284 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

gence of character is the result. In other words, segregate breeding is 
necessary to divergent evolution in ganio-genetic animals.* Moresover^ 
we have every reason to believe that the same law holds good through- 
out the whole organic world. The generating together of similars, 
with the exclusion or separation of dissimilars, is the central necessity 
in all evolution by descent, whether monotypic or poly tyi)ic and whatecer 
causes the separate generation of different classes of variation ^cill he the 
cause of divergent-evolution. That is, wherever this condition is added 
to the permanent laws of organic life, there divergence will follow. 
As we have already seen, natural selection or the survival of the fittest 
necessarily separates between the survivors and the nonsurvivors, 
between the best fitted and the least fitted, and is, therefore, the 
cause of monotypic transformation; but it can not be the cause of 
separation between the different families of those that survive, and, 
therefore, can not be the cause of divergence of character between 
these families. But we find that divergence of chaiacter often arises 
between the branches of one stock, and in many cases this divergence 
increases till well-marked varieties are established. If therefore the 
general principle we have just stated is true, there must be certain 
causes x>i'oducing the independent generation of these forms; and, if 
we can discover these causes and trace them to general principles, 
they will, in connection with the laws of variation and selection, 
explain divergent evolution, that is, the transformation of one form into 
many forms, of one species into many species. As community of evo- 
lution arises where there is community of breeding between those that, 
through superior fitness, have opportunity to propagate, so I believe it 
will be found that divergent evolution arises where there is separate 
breeding of the different classes of the successful. In other words, 
exclusive breeding of other than average forms causes monotypic evo- 
lution, and segregate breeding causes divergent or polytypic evolution. 
The facts of geographical distributicm seem to me to justify tlie fol- 
lowing statements: 

(1) A species exposed to different conditions in the different parts of 
the area over which it is distributed is not represented by divergent 
forms when free inter-breeding exists between the inhabitants of the 
different districts. In other words, diversity of natural selection with- 
out separation does not produce divergent evolution. 

(2) We find many cases in which areas, corresponding in the char- 
acter of the environment, but separated from each other by important 
barriers, are the homes of divergent forms of the same or allied species. 

(3) In cases where the separation has been long continued, and the 
external conditions are the most diverse in points that involve diver- 



* In a subsequent paper I shall show how it is that separate breeding, long con- 
tinned, inevitably ends in segregate breeding. In this chapter I confine my atten- 
tion more especially to separate breeding when combined with diversity of selection 
in the different sections, for it is evident that this will produce segregate breeding. 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 285 

sity of julaptation, there we find tlie most decided divergences in the 
organic forms. That is, where separation and divergent selection have 
long acted, the results are found to be the greatest. The first and 
third of these propositions will i>rol)ably be disj)uted by few, if by any. 
The proof of the second is found wherever a set of closely allied organ- 
isms is so distributed over a territory that each species and variety 
occupies its own narrow district, within which it is shut by barriers 
that restrain its distribution, w^hile each species of the environing types 
is distributed over the whole territory. The distribution of terrestrial 
mollusks on the Sandwich Islands presents a great body of facts of 
this kind. 

SELECTION OF EVERY KIND INSUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR DIVER- 
GENT EVOLUTION. 

Though I have no reason to doubt the im]>ortauce of sexual selection 
in promoting the transformation of many species, 1 think I can show 
that unless combined with some separative or segregative influence 
that i)revents free intercrossing, it can avail nothing in producing a 
diversity of races from one stock. In the nature of its action sexual 
selection is simplj^ exclusive. It is the exclusive breeding of those 
better fitted to the sexual instincts of the species, resulting from the 
failure to breed of the less fitted. It therefore indicates a method of 
separation between the better fitted and the less fitted; but it giv^es 
no explanation of separation between those that are equally successful 
in propagating. 

I maintain that in a great number of animal species there are sexual 
and social instincts that prevent the free crossing of clearly marked 
races; but as these segregative instincts are rarely the cause of failure 
to propagate, and since wlieu they are the cause of failure the failure is 
as likely to fall on one kind as on another, I conclude that the segre- 
gate breeding resulting from these instincts can not be classed as either 
sexual or social selection. Reflexive selection in all its forms is, like 
natural selection, the result of success and failure in vital processes 
tlirough whicli the successful propagate without crossing with the 
unsuccessful; but it in no way secures the breeding in sei)arate groups 
of those that are successful in pro])agating. The exclusion of certain 
competitors from breeding is a very different ])rocess from the separa- 
tion of the successful competitors into ditt'ercnt groups that are pre- 
vented from inter-crossing, and whose competition even is often limited 
to the mcTubers of the same group. Sexual selection, like other forms 
of rellexive selection, can extend only as far as members of the same 
sj)ecies act on each other. If the individuals of the two grou])S have 
through difference in their tastes ceased to compete with each other 
in seeking mates, they are already subject to difterent and divergent 
forms of sexual selec^tion; and is there any reason to attribute this 



286 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

difierence in tlieir tastes to the fact that, when there was but one group 
and the tastes of all were conformed to a single standard, some of the 
competitors failed of propagating, through being crowded aside by 
those more successful? If the failure of the unsuccessful can not he the 
cause of separation hettceen the different hinds of the suceessful, then selec- 
tion, whether natural or reflexive, or of any other Mnd, can not he the cause 
of divergent evolution, except as co-operating with some cause of independ- 
ent generation. 

The failure of sexual selection, Avithout separation or segregation, to 
account for divergent evolution, will perhaps be made clearer to some 
minds by considering some of the i)articular conditions under which it 
occurs. Suppose for instance that in some species of humming bird 
there occurs a slight variation in the form or color of the tail feathers 
of the male that adds to the beauty of the individuals possessing the 
new character and rendering them more attractive to the females. We 
can see that they might have an advantage over their rivals in leaving 
progeny, and that the variety might in that way gradually gain the 
ascendency, and the beauty of the markings become more and more 
completely defined; but under such conditions what could prevent the 
whole species from being gradually transformed? Unless there was 
some separative or segregative principle that prevented the new variety 
from crossing with the others, the species would remain but one, though 
changed in some of its characters. We should have transformation 
without divergence. 

The same must be true of institutional selection. It may be the 
cause of transformation ; but it can not be the cause of divergent evolu- 
tion, unless there are added to it other causes that produce divergence 
in the character of the forms selected, and the separate breeding of the 
different groups of forms thus selected. A single illustration will set 
in a clear light the limitation in the influence of institutional as well 
as all other selection. In primitive communities the deaf are but little 
cared for, and owing to the great disadvantage of their position their 
opportunities for gaining subsistence, and therefore for rearing fami- 
lies, are greatly diminished; this is natural selection. Again, those 
who are at so great a disadvantage in communicating with tlieir com- 
panions will be also at a disadvantage in finding consorts; this we may 
call social selection. Again, a community might either by law or by 
strict custom prevent the marriage of the deaf; this would be institu- 
tional selection. Any one of these forms of selection might be pressed 
so far as to be the means of increasing the average power of hearing in 
the community in succeeding generations; but it could never be the 
cause of two divergent races, one with good powers of hearing and the 
other with an increasing liability to deafness. To secure such diver- 
gence it is necessary that segregative infiuences should be introduced, 
such as have been most amply furnished by the modern system of edu- 
cation for the deaf. Under these influences those endowed with hear- 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 287 

ing and those without hearing have been separated into two communi- 
ties, the members of each having but little opportunity for acquaintance 
beyond the limits of that community, each community having sej^arate 
schools, separate newspapers, and to some extent a separate language. 
As the result of this segregation marriages between the two classes 
have been greatly diminished; and little by little two races are arising, 
the hearing race and the deaf race.* 

REASONS OF A GENERAL CHARACTER FOU CONSIDERINC SELECTION 
WITHOUT INDEPENDENT GENERATION AN UNSATISFACTORY EX- 
PLANATION OF DIVERGENT EVOLUTION. 

1. The divergence is often confined to characters which seem to have 
no possible relations of adaptation either to the environment or to 
otber members of the species, and, therefore, to be independent of both 
natural and reflexive selection. 

2. Divergence relating to adaptive characters successfully propa- 
gated involves different kinds rather than different degrees of adai)ta- 
tion and advantage; and, as adaptational selection depends on tlie 
diffeience of degrees of advantage, it can not account for the diver- 
gence of forms possessing ecjual degrees of advantage. 

3. In the very nature of its action we see that adaptational selection 
unaccompanied by independent generation must produce essentially 
monotypic transformation. 

4. In artificial breeding, independent generation is fi)und to be an 
essential condition for the production of divergent races: and there is 
no reason to doubt that the same law holds good in the divergence of 
natural forms. 

a. The general fact that species possessing high i)owers and large 
opportunities fi)r migration occui)y large areas, while those possessing 
low ])()\vers and small opportunities for migration divide the same area, 
or an area no larger, between many representative species, shows that 
independent generation is an important element in their divergence. 

Chapter II. 

CUMULATIVE DIVERGENCE THROUGH CUMULATIVE SEGREGATION 

Local sei)aiation in dissimilar environments is the only cause of 
segregation that has been clearly i)ointed out by Darwin. I shall 
however endeavor to show that there are other causes producing 
segregation, and that, without any change of environment or change 
in the environment, they may produce all the phenomena of divergent 



* See paper by Alexander Graham Bell, read before the National Academy of 
Siiences, November 13, 1883, upon the " Formation of a Denf Variety of the Human 
Race;" also a review of the same in The Popular Science Monthly, vol. xxvii, p. 15, 
entitled " Can Man be Modified by Selection?" 



288 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

evolution. Any cause that, out of two or more kinds of successful 
vtiriations, brings together one kind in such a way as to facilitate 
their breeding together, or to hinder their breeding with those of other 
kinds, is, according to my definition, a cause of segregate breeding; 
and the experience of breeders shows that wiierever such causes operate 
divergent evolution is the result, and that the divergence accunuilates 
when the process is continued through many generations. From their 
experiments we learn that any form of segregate breeding persistently 
continued will result in divergent evolution. As any form of natural 
selection in which other than typical forms have the advantage will 
result in monotypic evolution, so any form of segregate generation will 
produce i^olytypic evolution. I call this the law of cumulative diver- 
gence throuffh cumulative segregation. It is a generalization established 
by the widest experience of mankind in the cultivation of plants and 
the breeding of animals; and any assumption that is not in accord 
with it may be wisely called in question. 

I therefore judge that the advantage or disadvantage of their diver- 
gence, to individuals diverging from the typical form of a species, can 
not be the factor that determines whether the divergence shall be accu- 
mulated. 

A divergent member of any inter-generating group can not long per- 
petuate its kind, if the divergence is any disadvantage; for the superior 
propagation of the more successful kinds wall soon overpower the 
influence of the less successful ; and the result will be monotypic evo- 
lution. The case is, however, very different w ith variations that are 
wholly or partially separated from each other and from the type by 
their divergent adaptation to different kinds of resources, or by any 
other cause. The perpetuation of such variations depends not upon 
any advantage they possess above the type from which they diverge, 
but upon ability to apinoi)riate from the environment sufticient simply 
to maintain existence, and the result is polytypic evolution. In other 
words, of the freely crossing forms of any species it is only those that 
are most successful that are perpetuated; while o//orws that are neither 
competing nor crossing, every lmidis2ierpetuate(l that is not fatally deficient 
in its adaptations. It follows that a form that under present conditions 
maintains only a precarious existence, may, if kept from crossing, main- 
tain its characteristics unimpaired for many generations, and at last, 
through changes in the environment, enter upon a period of great pros- 
perity. Such wo^lld be the case with a form depending upon resources 
at first scarce, and afterwards very abundant. 

Again, the individuals of a species that are brought together in their 
attempts to appropriate some new kind of resource, and are thus led to 
breed with each other, and not with the rest of the species, become a 
new inter- gen crating group in which a new and divergent form of nat- 
ural selection is established, depending on divergent adaptations in 
the organism, without any change in the environment. The gradual 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 289 

l)iocess of gaining- full adaptation to the new resources may extend 
over many generations, and during this long period the divergent form 
may be at a great disadvantage as compared with the typical form ; 
but after this long process of divergence is completed, and full com- 
mand of the new resource is gained, the new race may enter upon a 
period of great prosperity. In such a case, the ])criod of most rapidly 
accumulating divergence is a period when the incipient race is suffering 
the heaviest disadvantage. The transformation from a wild to a domes- 
tic state aifords a complete parallel to this process. In the initial and 
earlier stages, the divergent branch that is being domesticated is in 
constant danger of extermination; and it is only when a good degree 
of adaptation to the new conditions has been gained that it can be said 
to be as prosperous as the wild stock from which it was derived. Dar- 
win has not explained how disadvantageous sexual instincts can be 
formed ; but, assuming that there are such instincts, he has shown that 
they would modify the si)ecies in a way that is disadvantageous. He 
believes the progenitors of man were deprived of their hairy coat by 
sexual selection that was, in its earlier stages, disadvantageous. 

It is therefore evident that the simple fact of divergence in any case 
is not a sutticient ground for assuming that the divergent form has an 
advantage over the type trom which it diverges. We may however 
be sure that there is some cause or combination of causes that facili- 
tates the intergenerating of those similarly endowed, and hinders their 
crossing with other kinds; andifwecan discover the cause of this 
segregate generation we shall have an explanation of one part of the 
l)rocess by which the forms thus endowed are becoming a distinct race. 

SEPARATION AND SK(IKEaATH)N WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF INTENSION. 

It will contribute to clearness in our discussion if we can gain dchnite 
conceptions of the conditions that are necessarily involved in separate 
and segregate breeding. 

Separate generation, which for convenience I callsei)aration, imi)lies: 

First. The indiscriminate separation of the members of a species into 
different sections that are prevented from freely crossing with each 
other. 

.Second. The aggicgation of the members of one section; that is, 
their being brought into conditions of time and jdace that allow of 
their freely crossing. 

Third. The integration of the members of each section into one inter- 
generating group, through the operation of functional adaptations by 
which the mendxn'S of each section freely cross with each other. This 
analysis of the pro<-ess sliows that it may depend upon a great variety 
of causes, working together in a very complex way. We shall here- 
after find that the causes of separation may operate in such a May 
that no aggn'gation or proi)agation takes jdace among the members 
that are separated from the oI<l stock; but in such cases there is no

290 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

separate, generation, and therefore uo separation in the sense in which 
1 use the word. 

Segregate generation also consistsof separation, aggregation, audinte- 
gration ; but it differs from separate generation in that in the latter the 
separation is indiscriminate, while in the former there is a more or less 
jn-ouounced bringing together of those that are sindlarly endowed, with 
separation of those that are dissimilar. Segregate generation is there- 
fore the separation of dissimilars, with the aggregation and integration 
of similars. As we have already seen, segregate breeding may be pro- 
duced by separate breeding, accompanied by diversity of natural selec- 
tion in the different sections. It is almost evident that any other cause 
that develops in one or more of the separate sections of the species 
characters that are not found in the other sections will produce segre- 
gate breeding. Such cases are diversity of selection of other forms 
than natural selection, diversity in the inherited effects of use and dis- 
use (unless physiologists have been mistaken in supposing that there 
are any such effects), and diversity in the inherited characters derived 
from the direct effects of the environment (unless, again, Weismann is 
right and the general belief wrong). Segregate breeding may more- 
over be produced directly by the very way in which the separation of 
the different sections is secured. One of the best examples of this kind 
of segregation is seen in what I call industrial segregation, where the 
members of a species are distributed according to their endowments, 
those of similar endowments being brought together. In such cases, 
segregation is introduced as soon as the separation, without depend- 
ing on the subsequent action of the environment, or on diverse forms 
of use, or of selection 5 though there can be no doubt that, in the great 
majority of cases, diversity of use and diversity of selection of some 
kind will in time come in to intensify the result. 

There is another invariable sequence which it is necessary we should 
keep in mind if we would understand the relation in which these two 
principles stand to each other. I refer to the certainty that all pro- 
longed separate breeding will be transformed into segregate breeding. 
In other words, indiscriminate separation, in which there is no appar- 
ent difference in the different groups, is in time found to be a separa- 
tion in which there is a decided difference in the different groups. 
Whenever a sufficient number of the same species to insure propaga- 
tion are brought together in an isolated position, separate generation is 
the result; and, if this separate generation is long-continued, we have 
reason to believe it always passes into segregate generation with diver- 
gent evolution. The fuiulamental cause for this seems to lie in the fact 
that no two i>ortions of a species possess exactly the same average 
character, and that the initial differences are for ever reacting on the 
environment and on each other in such a way as to insure increasing 
divergence in each successive generation as long as the individuals of 
the two groups are kept from intergenerating. In my paper on Diver- 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 291 

.sify of Evoliifion under one ISct of External Condition.s, I spoke of this 
principle of divergence as "separation with variation; " hut in order 
to distinguish the iiiitecedent condition, which is sepaiation, from the 
result, which is something more than variation, I now call the certainty 
tliat some form of divergent transformation will arise when inter-genera- 
tion is prevented the ])rinci])le of infoision • and segregation iiroduced 
by independent transformation I call intensive segregation. 

As separate and segregate generation are so closely related, I have, 
ill order to avoid a multi])lication of terms, classilied the two i^rinciples 
together under the general term segregation. In my discussion of the 
causes of segregation I shall however endeavor to determine concern- 
ing each class of causes whether they are primarily separative or seg- 
regative. 

A full discussion of the causes of segregation would rciiuire that under 
each combination of causes to which we give a distinctive name we 
should show : 

(1) How the independent geuei-aticm is produced. 

(2) How the difference of character in the different sections is pro- 
duced. 

(3) How the aggregation in place bringing together tlie members of 
each section is produced. 

(4) How the correspondence in times and seasons necessary for inter- 
generation is secured within each section. 

(5) How the corrcs])ondence of community and of sexual and social 
instincts necessary for iutergeneration is secured within each section, 

(()) How the correspondence in structure, in dimensions, and in the 
mutual potentiality of the sexual elements necessary for intergenera- 
tion is secured within each section. 

it will howe\er be observed, that Avith the exception of the two 
lirst, these questions relate to the necessary conditions that must always 
exist in the case of every inter-generating group; and as it is evident 
tliat inter generation in some degree must be the normal condition in 
every sexual, that is, in every gamo-genetic si)ecies, we may here assume 
that all the conditions necessary to inter-generation exist, except so far 
as they liave been disturbed by causes i)roducing segeneration. In 
tracing the causes of segregation it will therefore be sufficient if in 
each class of cases we give the cause of segeneration, showing why the 
sanie cause does not prevent all inter-generation, and exjdain the differ- 
ence of character in the different sections produced l)y the se-genera- 
tion. In full accord with the implications of the theory of evolution, 
we proceed on the assum})ti<m that inter-generation was the original 
condition of every species, and that the inter-generation of those that 
are brought together under favorable circumstances may be taken for 
granted, unless there is some s])ecial cause that prevents. All that is 
necessary to produce separation is the failure of any one of the many 
conditions on which free crossing dei^ends, in such a way and to such 



292 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

a degree that the S])eeie8 falls into two or more sectious, between which 
crossing is inteniipted, without its being- interrupted within the bounds 
of each section. And all that is necessaiy to produce segregation is 
that to separation should be added some cause that secures dilference 
of (;haracter in the diflerent sections. And as separation long contin- 
ued inevitably ends in segregation through the development of differ- 
ence of character in the different sections, we need not in our classiti- 
cation set them wholly apart, though for the sake of clearly recogniz- 
ing the difference it will be well to note in each class of causes whether 
the i)rinuiry effect is separation or segregation. 

CUMULATIVE SEGREGATION AND THE CLA«SIEICATION OF ITS DIF- 
FERENT FORMS. 

The fundamental law to which I would call attention may be expressed 
in the following formula : Cumulative segregation produces accunnilated 
divergence and accumulated divergence produces permanent segrega- 
tion, and the segregate vsubdivision of those permanently segregated 
produces the divisions and subdivisions of organic phyla. If then we 
can discover the causes of segregation, we shall understand the causes 
of a wide range of phenomena, for this is the fundamental jDrinciple in 
the formation of varieties, species, genera, families, orders, and all 
greater divergences that have been produced in the descendants of 
common ancestry. 

In treating of the causes of segregation I have found it convenient 
to make two distinct classifications. In the one the fundamental dis- 
tinction is between segregation produced by the purpose of man, which 
I call rational segregation in its two forms, artificial segregation, insti- 
tutional segregation, and that produced by luiture outside of man, 
which I call responsive segregation ; while any of these forms of segre- 
gation may be intensified by independent transformation through the 
principles of diversity of selection, diversity of use, or diversity of 
direct effects of the environment; and the combined action of segrega- 
tion with these and other principles of transformation I call intensive 
segregation. 

In the other classification the fundamental distinction is between 
segregation arising from the relations in which the organism stands to 
the environment, which I call environal segregation, and segregation 
arising from the relations in which the members of the same species 
stand to each other, which I call retiexive segregation; while any form 
of segregation belonging to either of these classes may be enhanced by 
one or more of the forms of intension, and thus ])ref-ent what 1 call in- 
sive segregation. 

THE EFFECTS OF SEGREGATION. 

The efi'e<;ts of segregation can be studied to advantage in tlir vast 
experience that has been accumulated in the domestication of plants 
and animals. 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 298 

Artificial segregation is caused by the relations in whicli tlic organ 
ism stands totlic rational environnuMit, that is, to the })ur])oses of man. 
In other words, artitteial segregation is the rational form of environal 
segregation. Though the bearing of segregation on the evolution of 
species in a state of nature has been for the most part overlooked, its 
effects have been quite familiar to tlie breeder of domestic races. 

As a convenient nu^thod of illustration, let us consider the different 
results that will be gained according as we subject the same ten pairs 
of wild rock pigeons to one or the other of the following methods of 
treatment : 

lu the tirst experiment let the treatment be as follows: Let ten avia- 
ries be prepared, and in each aviary put one male with the female that 
most nearly resembles it. When the young of each aviary arrive at 
maturity, let them bo inspected, and if any individual resembles the 
inmates of one of the other aviaries more than the inmates of the aviary 
in which it was i)roduced, let it be placed with those it most closely 
resembles. If any unusual variation arises, let it be placed in a new 
aviary, and let the one of the other sex that most closely resembles it 
in that respect be placed with it. When the crowding in any aviary 
becomes injurious to the health of the birds let the numbers be indis- 
criminately reduced. Let this process be continued many generations, 
the inmates in all the aviaries being fed on the same food, and in every 
respect treated alike, and what will be the result? 

No experienced breeder will hesitate in assuring us that under such 
treatment a multitude of varieties will be formed, many of which will 
Iw, very widely divergent from the original wild stock. In other words, 
cumulative segregation tcill produce accumulated divergence, though there 
is IK) selection in the sense in irhich natural selection is selection. 

Again, let us take the same ten pairs, and putting them into one 
large aviary, let them breed freely together without any segregative 
iiiHuence coming in to affect the result, and who does not know that 
the type would remain essentially one, though a considerable range of 
individual variation might arise. That is, ivithoiit segregation no diver- 
gence of ti/pe will arise. 

THE NATURAL LAW OF CUMULATIVE SEGREGATION. 

1 shall now show that there is in nature a law of cumulative segrega- 
tion. There are large classes of activities in the organism and in the 
environment that cons])ire to produce segregate breeding; and to pro- 
duce it in such a way thiit in a vast multitude of cases it becomes a 
l)ermanent fa(;t, which no cause that we are acquainted with can ever 
obliterate. Moreover, when one form of segregation has become fully 
established, we iind that the different branches are liable to be again 
subjected to segregative influences, by which each branch is subdi- 
A ided, and in time differentiated into divergent forms that are not 
liiible to intcr-cross in a state of nature. 



294 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

Now, ;is we have just pointed out, we kuow froiu the fuudanieutal 
laws of th<>, orj^anic world, that cumuhitive segregation of this kind 
must produce euniulative divergence of types. 

The segregation that results from the natural causes enumerated in 
this paper is cumulative in two respects. In the first place, every new 
form of segregation that now appears depends on, and is superimposed 
upon, forms of segregation that have been previously induced; for 
when negative segregation arises, and the varieties of a species be- 
come less and less fertile with each other, the complete infertility that 
has existed between them and some other species does not disappear, 
nor does the positive segregation (that is, the prevention of the con- 
sorting of the species characterized by this mutual incapacity) cease. 
The means by which the males and females of one species find each 
other are not abrogated when the species falls into segregated varie- 
ties. In the second place, whenever segregation is directly produced 
by some quality of the organism, variations that possess the endow- 
ment in a superior degree will have a larger share in producing the 
segregated forms of the next generation, and accordingly the segrega- 
tive endowment of the next generation will be greater than that of the 
present generation; and so with each successive generation the segre- 
gation will become increasingly complete. 

The principle of cunuilative segregation, first in its independent 
action, and still further when combined with the different principles 
by which the divergence of the segregated branches is intensified, gives 
a fornuil explanation of the ever-expanding diversities of the organic 
world. It shows how varieties arise and pass into species, how species 
l^ass into genera, genera into families, families into orders, and orders 
into classes and the higher divisions, as far as evolntion by descent 
extends. It brings to light the dex)endence of this whole process on 
the influences that produce segregation ; and shows how these influ- 
ences, added to variation, heredity, and the other acknowledged powers 
residing in organisms, must produce the phenomena of divergent evo- 
lution. 

COMPETITIVE DISRUPTION. 

Before entering ujiou the discussion of the direct causes of cumula- 
tive segregation, let us briefly consider a law resulting from the compe- 
tition of kindred with each other, which brings to light the fact that 
such, competition is one of the most important factors in preparing the 
way for, and in giving intensity to, the activities that lead to segrega- 
tion and divergent evolution. It is manifest that competition for iden- 
tical resources and geographical segregation are conditions which can 
not exist at the same time between the same members of any species; 
but it is also manifest that when there are no natural barriers separ- 
ating the different districts of an area, part of which is occupied by a 
species, pressure for food through a great increase in the population 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 295 

will tend to distribute the species over the whole area; and if the avail- 
able resources iu the different districts are considerably diverse, the 
overflow of population from the crowded district will be subjected to 
a necessary change of habits; and thus, throngh competition, there 
will be the disruption of old relations to the environment, and the 
bringing" in of conditions that give the highest efliciency and tlie full- 
est opportunity to all the activities that produce segregation. In the 
case of animals, no condition can tend more strongly to produce migra- 
tion than scarcity of food in the old habitat; and in the case of both 
plants and aninnUs, a great increase in the numbers that are exposed 
to the winds, currents, and other transporting influences of the envi- 
ronment increases the ])robability that individuals will be carried to 
new districts where circumstances will allow of their multiplying, and 
where they will, at the same time, l)e prevented from crossing with the 
original stock, in many cases the segregation thus bronght about 
will be in districts where the environment is the same, and in other 
cases the pressure for tbod or other resources will lead portions of the 
species to take u]) new habits in the effort to ai)j)ropriate resources not 
previously used; and through these new habits they will often be seg- 
regated from those maintaining the original habits. I shall hereafter 
show that in both these cases there is a tendency to divergent evolu- 
tion. 

I at (►ne time thought of describing this principle as a form of segre- 
gation, calling it dominatumal segregation; but fuller reflection convinces 
me that the domination of the strong over the weak is not a form of 
segregation, but rather a cause that prepares the way for segregation, 
by forcing ])ortions of the community out of their inherited relations to 
the environment. 

CHAPTER III. 

DESCRIPTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF CUMULATIVE 

SEGREGATION.* 

A. ENVIRONAL SEGREGATION. 

Environal segregation is segregation arising from the relations in 
which the organism stands to the environment. 

It includes four classes, which I call industrial, chronal, spatial, and 
artificial segregation.! 

{(() Industrial segregation. 

is segregaticm arising from the activities by which the organism ]n"o- 
tects itself against adverse influences in the environment, or b\' wliich 
it liiids and appropriates special resources in the environment. 

In tlie followino- cbaiitcrs nniiierals arc attaflieil to wliat T consider .sciiunite 
causes of sfgrcyat ion iii<lcj)('udeiit ot liumau purpose. 

t Francis (Jalton has suggested auother class, which might approjiriatcly he called 
fertilizatioual segregation. 



296 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

The different forms of industrial segregation are sustentational, pro- 
tectional, and niditieatioual segregation. 

For the production of industrial segregation it is necessary that there 
should be, in the same environment, a diversity of fully and of approx- 
imately available resources more or less separated from each other, 
and in the organism some diversity of adaptation to these resources, 
accompanied by powers of search and of discrimination, by which it is 
able to find the resources for which it is best fitted and to adhere to 
the same when found. 

The relation in which these causes stand to each other and through 
which they produce segxegation may be described as separation accord- 
ing to endowment — i)roduced by endeavor according to endowment. 

It is evident that if initial variation presents in any case a diversity 
of adaptations to surrounding resources that can not be followed Avith 
out separating those differently endowed, we shall have, in the very 
nature of such variation, a cause of segregation and of divergent evo- 
lution. Some slight variation in the digestive powers of a few indi- 
viduals makes it x)0ssible for them to live exclusively on some abundant 
form of food, which the species has heretofore only occasionally tasted. 
In the pressure for food that arises in a crowed community these take 
up their perman ent abode where the new form of food is most accessible, 
and thus separate themselves from the original form of the species. 
These similarly endowed forms will therefore breed together, and the 
oflfsj)ring will, according to the law of diversity through segregation, be 
still better adapted to the new form of food. And this increasing 
adaptation, with increasing divergence, might continue for many gen- 
erations, though every individual should come to maturity and propa- 
gate; that is, though there were no enhancing of the effect through 
diversity of selection, or indeed through any other cause producing 
intensive segregation. And when different forms of intention do arise 
they may be entirely indeiiendent of change in the environment, the 
only change being in the forms or functions of the organism. 

In choosing a name for this form of segregation I first thought of 
calling it physiological or functional segregation ; but such a name is, 
on closer examination, found to imply both too much and too little; for, 
on the one hand there is probably no form of segregation that is not in 
some way or in some degree due to physiological or functional causes, 
and on the other hand this special form of segregation is as dependent 
on psychological causes which guide the organism in finding and in 
adhering to the situation for wliich it is best fitted, as it is on the initial 
divergence of the more strictly physiological adaptations by which it is 
able to appropriate and assimilate the peculiar form of resource. In 
the case of freely-moving animals the psychological guidance is an 
essential factor in the success of the individual; while in the case of 
plants and low types of animal life, the suitable situation is reached by 
a wide distribution of a vast number of seeds, spores, or germs, and 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 297 

the same situation is niaiutained by a loss of migratioual power as soon 
as the i^^erms begin to cb'velop. Tn tliese lower organisms it is evident 
that the success of tlie individual must depend on its physiological 
ratlier than its psycliological adaptations; and if an initial divergence 
of adaptations results in a slight diiference in the kinds that succeed in 
germiiiiiting in contrasted situations, the diilerence is directly due to a 
diversity in the forms of natural selection affecting the seed, and the 
separation is what I hereafter describe as local separation, passing into 
local segregation. We therefore see that what I here call industrial 
segTcgation depends on psychological powers acting in aid of divergent 
physiological adaptations to the environment, or in aid of adaptations 
that are put to different uses. 

Observation shows that there is a multitude of cases in which en - 
(lea\-or according to endowment brings together those similarly endowed 
and causes them to breed together; and when the species is thus divided 
into two or more groups somewhat ditferently endowed, there will cer- 
tainly be an increased divergence in the otfspring of the parents thus 
segregated; and so on in each successive generation, as long as the 
individuals find their places according to their endowments, and thus 
propagate with those similarly endowed, there will be accumulated 
divergence in the next generation. Indeed it is evident that endeavor, 
according to endowment, may produce under one environment what 
natural selection i)roduces when aided by local separation in different 
environments. As it produces the separate breeding of a divergent 
form without involving the destruction of contrasted forms, it is often 
the direct cause of divergent transformations; while natural selection, 
which results in the separate breeding of the fitted through the failure 
of the unfitted, can uever be the cause of divergence unless there are 
concurrent causes that produce both divergent forms of natural selec- 
tion and the separate breeding of the different kinds of variations thus 
selected. 

Suetudinalintension. — Another law is usually believed to be connected 
with endeavorwhich, if it exists, must conspire to enhance its tendency 
to i)roduce divergent evolution. I refer to the inttuence which the 
habitual endeavor of the parents has on the inherited powers of the off- 
spring. Wo may call it the law of endowment of offspring according to 
the exerciseor endeavor of parents, or, more briefly, suetudinal intension. 
The inherited effects of use and disuse have been fully recognized by 
Darwin, Si)encer, Coi)e, Murphy, and others, and need not here be dis- 
cussed. The one point to which 1 wish to call attention is, that in order 
that diversity of use should produce divergent evolution, it is necessary 
that free crossing should be prevented between the different sections of 
the species in Avhich the diversity of use is found. Kow this condition 
of separate breeding is often secured by industrial segregation. In 
other words, the law of endeavor, according to endowment, often se- 
cures se])aration according tocnilownuMit, and this gives an opportunity 



298 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

for tlie inheritable effects of diversity of endeavor to be accumulated in 
successiNc yciieratious, and in this way both laws conspire to produce 
divergent evolution. 

In the relation of these two factors we have a striking example of 
the peculiar interdependence of vital phenomena. Diversity of endow- 
ment is the cause of di^^ersity of endeavor and of segregate breeding, 
and diversity of endeavor with segregate breeding is the cause of 
increased diversity of endowment. It is very similar to the relation 
between power and exercise in the individual. Without power there 
can be no exercise, and without exercise there can be no continuance 
or growth of power. 

We therefore see that the effects of industrial segregation are 
specially liable to be enhanced by that form of intensive segregation 
which I have suggested should be called snetudinal intension. 

Simple and fomiliar as the i)rinciples of industrial segregation and 
snetudinal intention may seem, their consistent application to the 
theory of evolution will throw new light on a wide range of problems. 
This law of divergent evolution through industrial segregation rests 
on facts that are so fnlly acknowledged by all parties, that it seems to 
be a sujierfluous work to gather evidence on the subject. It may 
however be profitable to consider briefly whether the cases are frequent 
in which different habits of feeding, of defense, or of nest-building 
become the cause of separate breeding by which the same habits are 
maintained in one line of descent without serious interruption for many 
generations. It is important to remember, (1) that the separate breed- 
ing will arise with equal certainty whether the diversity in the habits 
has been initiated by original diversity in the instincts and adaptations 
of the different variations, or by the crowding of population inducing 
special efforts to find new resources, and leading to diversity of 
endeavor; and (2) that in either case the result is what is here called 
industrial segregation. In the first case the process is directly segrega- 
tive, while in the second case it is primarily separative, but (according 
to the principle discussed in the second section of last chapter) inevita- 
bly passes into segregate breeding. Snetudinal intention, or divergent 
evolution through diversity of use, will operate as surely in the one 
case as in the other. 

1. Sustentational segregation arises from the use of different methods 
of obtaining sustentation by members of the same species. 

There can be no doubt that of the innumerable cases where phyto- 
phagic varieties (as they are sometimes called) of insects exist, a con- 
siderable proportion would be found on investigation to be iiermanent 
varieties xiroducing offspring that are better adapted to the use of the 
special form of food consumed by the parents than are the offspring of 
other varieties; and it is evident that if the peculiar habits of each 
variety had no tendency to i)rodu('e segregative breeding this result 
would not be reached ; for each variety would be promiscuously min- 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 299 

^led Avitli evory other, and, thouiili tlio tciulciicy to variation luiglit be 
j;r«'atly increased, the regular production of any one variety of young 
\A ould be inevented. 

A large mass of facts c(tidd be easily gathered illustrative of susten- 
tational segregation; but as the principle will probably be denied by 
no one, we should pass on without further expansion of this part of 
the subject. 

L*. Protect ioHul st'dfcgation is segregation from tiie use of different 
metliods of jtrotection against adverse influeijfes in the environment. 

AVheii a new enemy enters the field occupied l)y any species different 
methods of escape or defense are often open to the members of the 
one species, and the use of these dilferent methods must sometimes 
result in the st\gregation of the nu'mbers according io the methods 
adopted. Some may hide in thickets or holes, while others preserve 
themselves by flight. Sui>posiug the species to be an edible butterfly 
occupying the open fields, and the new enemy to be an insectivorous 
bird also keeping to the open country, certain members might escape 
by taking to the woodlands, ^Adlile others might remain in their old 
liaunt, gaining througii protectional selection more and more likeness 
to some ine<lible species. 

3. Xidifie<(tio)ii(J segregation. — Let us now consider the effects of 
divergent habits in regard to nest- building. It is well known to 
American ornithologists that the cliff swallow of the eastern portions 
of the United States has for the most part ceased to build nests in the 
cliffs that were the original haunts of the species, and has availed itself 
of the protection from the weather offered by the eaves of civilized 
houses; and that with this change in nest-building has come a change 
in sonu' of its other habits. Xow there is reason to believe that if the 
nnnilx'r of houses had been limited to a hundredth part of those now 
existing, and if that limited luimber had been very slowly supplied, 
this gradual change in some of the elements of the environment would 
have resulted in divergent forms of adaptation to the environment in 
two sections of the same species. One section would have retained the 
old habit of building in the cliffs, with all the old adaptations to the 
circumstances that depend on that habit; while another section of the 
species Avould have avaih'd its(^lf of the new opportunities for shelter 
under the eaves of houses, and would have changed their inherited 
adaptations to meet the new habits of nest-building and of feeding. 
It is also evident that the prevention of free inter-breeding between the 
different sections caused by the diversity of habits would have been 
an essential factor in the divergence of character in the sections. 

It simply remains to consider whether the industrial habit that sepa- 
rates an individual from the mass of the species will necessarily leave 
it alone, without any chance of finding a consort that may Join in i)r()- 
ducing a new intergeiu'rant. The answer is that there is no such 
necessity. Though it may sometimes hai»i)en that an individual may 



BOO DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

be separated from all coinpauious by its industrial habit, it is usually 
found that those that at one time and one place adopt the habit are 
usually sufficient to keep up the new strain, if they succeed in securing 
the needed sustenance. 

(h) Chronal segregation. 

is segregation arising from the relations in which the organism stands 
to times and seasons. 

I distinguish two forms — cyclical and seasonal segregation. 

4. Cyclical segregation is segregation arising from the fact that the 
life cycles of the different sections of the species do not mature in the 
same years. 

A fine illustration of this form of segregation is found in the case of 
Cicada septemdecim, whose metropolis is in Virginia, Maryland, and 
Delaware, though many outlying broods are found in other regions 
east of the Mississippi Ei\ er. The typical form has a life-cycle of sev- 
enteen years, but there is a special race {Cicada tredeci^n, Eiley) that is 
separated from the typical form, both locally and chronally. As the 
life-cycle ot this race is thirteen instead of seventeen years, even if oc- 
cupying the same districts and breeding at exactly the same season, 
inter breeding could occur between the two forms only once in two hun- 
dred and twenty-one years, or once in thirteen generations of the longer 
lived race, and once in seventeen generations of the shorter lived race. 
During the year 1885 the two races appeared simultaneously. The op- 
portunity for testing whether they would freely interbreed if brought 
together has therefore passed not to return till the year 2100 ; but the 
distribution of the two races in different districts seems to indicate 
that local segregation has had an important influence in the develop- 
ment of the race. It is manifest, however, that if during a period of 
local separation, or if during the period of two hundred and twenty- 
one years of cyclical separation after the thirteen-year race was first 
formed, this race should become modified in the season of its appear- 
ing, there would after that be no mingling of race, though brought to- 
gether in the same districts. This would be seasonal segregation, 
which we shall consider in the next section ; but what is of special inter- 
est here, as an example of complete cyclical segregation, is the fact that 
at Fall River, Mass., there is a brood of the septemdecim form, due a 
year later than the universal time of appearing.* 

In any species where the breeding of each successive generation is 
separated by an exact measure of time which is very rigidly regulated 
by the constitution of the species, cyclical segregation will follow, if 
through some extraordinary combination of circumstances, members

sufficinil tf) piopa.n'iite the s})ecies are either hastened or delayed in 
their <h'\('lopnient, and thus thrown out of synchronal ctnupatibility 
with the rest of the species. If, after being retarded or hastened in 
ih'velopnieut so that part of a cycle is lost or gained, the old constitu- 
tional tinu' measure reasserts itself the segregation is complete. 

So far as this one point relating to the time of maturing is concerned 
the constitutional difference is segregative, while in every other respect 
it will be simply separative, except as separation passes into segrega- 
tion. The Fall River brood of Cicada septemdcehn being entirely separ- 
ated from all other broods of the same race by being belated a year 
maybe modiliod by forms of natural selection that never arise in these 
other broods. And this may be the case even if a brood observing the 
ordinary tinuj is always associated with it in locality. 

5. Seasonal segregation is produced whenever the season for repro- 
<lnction in any section of the species is such that it can not interbreed 
with other sections of the species. It needs no argument to show that 
if in a species of plant that regularly flowers in the spring, there 
arises a. variety that regularly flowers in the autumn, it will be pre- 
vented from interbreeding with the typical form. The question of chief 
interest is, Under what circumstances are varieties of this kind likely 
to arise? Is a casual sport of this kind likely to transmit to subse- 
quent generations a permanently changed constitution? If not, how 
is the new constitution acquired! One obvious answer is that it may 
arise under some special influence of the environment upon members 
of the species that are geographically or locally segregated from the 
rest of the species. 

But may not the variation in the season of flowering be the cause of 
segregation that will directly tend to produce greater variation in that 
respect in the next generation, and so on till the divergence in the con- 
stitutional adaptation to season is carried to the greatest extreme that 
is compatible with the environment? I believe that it not only may 
but must have that effect: but we should remember that the average 
form which flowers at the height of the season will so vastly predomi- 
nate over the extreme forms that the latter will be but stragglers iu 
comi)arison. 

In regard to the one point of the season of readiness for propagation 
this i)rinciple is segregative; but in other respects it is simply separa- 
tive, unless through the princii)le of correlated variation other char- 
acters are directly connected with the constitution that determines the 
season. It will be observed that seasonal segregation is produced by 
a parallel and simultaneous change in the constitution of members in 
one phu'csullicient to propagate the species; Avliile cyclical segregation 
is produced by a simultaneous acceleration or retardation in the devel- 
opment of nicmlu IS in one place sufficient to propagate the species 
without disturbing the regular action of the constitution under ordi- 
nary circumstances. 



302 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

{c) Spatial segregation 

is segregation arising from the relations in wliicli tbe organism stands 
to space. \ 

I distinguish two forms, viz: geographical and local segregation. 

Geographical segregation is segregation that arises from the distribu- 
tion of the species in districts separated by geographical barriers that 
prevent free inter-breeding. Decided differences of climate in neigh- 
boring districts and regions may be classed as geographical barriers. 

Local segregation is segregation that arises when a species with small 
powers of migration and small opportunities for transportation has 
been in time very widely distribnted over an area that is not subdi- 
vided by geographical barriers. The segregation in this case is due to 
the disproportion between the size of the area occupied and the powers 
of communication existing between the members of the species occu- 
pying the different parts of the area. Though it is often difficult to 
say wliether a given case of segregation should be classed as geograph- 
ical or local, still the distinction will be I'ound useful, for the results 
will differ according as the segregation is chiefly due to barriers or to 
wide diffusion of the species. In geographical segregation the result 
is usually the development of well-dehned varieties or species on oppo- 
site sides of the barriers; but in local segregation it often happens that 
the forms found in any given locality are connected with those in sur- 
rounding localities by individuals i>i'eseuting every shade of interme 
diate character; and in general terms it may be said that the forms 
most widely separated in si)ace are most widely divergent in charac- 
ter. It is of course apparent that when the divergence has reached a 
certain point, the differentiated forms may occupy the same districts 
without inter-breeding, for they will be kept apart by some, if not all, 
of the different forms of industrial, chronal, conjunctional, and impreg- 
national segregation. 

Three different forms of spatial segregation may be distinguished 
according to the causes by which they are i)roduced, viz : 

6. Migrational segregation^ caused by powers of locomotion in the 
organism. 

7. Transportational segregation^ caused by activities in the environ- 
ment that distribute the organism in different districts (i)rominent 
among these are currents of atmosphere and of water, and the action of 
migratory species upon those that can simply cling). 

8. Geological segregation^ caused by geological changes dividing the 
territory occui^ied by a species into two or more sections. For exam- 
ple, geological subsidence may divide the continuous area occupied by 
a species into several islands, seiiarated by channels which the creatures 
in question can not i)a-ss. 

Migration differs from transportation simply in that the former is the 
direct result of activities in the organism, and the latter of activities 
in the environment; and tliough the distribution of every sj)ecies de- 



DIVEKGENT EVOLUTION THEOUGH SEGREGATION. 303 

pends on the coinbiiu'd actiou of both classes of activities, it is usually 
easy to detcrmiiic to wlii('li class the carrying power belongs. The 
(pialities of the tliistle down enable it to float in the air, but it is the 
wind that carries it afar. 

Some degree of local segregation exists whenever the members of a 
species produced in a given area are more likely to interbreed with each 
other than with those produced in surrounding areas, or whenever 
extraordinary disi)ersal plants a colony beyond the range of ordinary 
dispersal. In other words, when those produced in a given district are 
more nearly related with Cu^ch other than with tliose i>roduced in sur- 
rounding districts, there local segregation has existed. 

There is one important respect in which spatial segregation differs 
from all other forms of environal segregation, namely, in its ordinary 
oi»erati()n it does not depend directly upon diversity in the qualities and 
powers of tin* organism. The dispersion of the members of a species 
would not be prevented if each was exactly like every other ; though 
of course if there were no power of variation, separate breeding Avould 
have no influence in producing divergence of character. It follows that 
every si)ecies is — or is more or less liable to be — affected by spatial 
segregation; and it often happens that other forms of segregation arise 
through the previous oi)eration of this form; but as si)atial segregation 
prevents organisms from crossing only when separated in space, it must 
always be re-enforced by other forms of segregation before well-defined 
species are produced that are capable of occupying the same distri(!t 
without interbreeding. Thevast majority of the divergent forms arising 
tlirough local segregation are re-integrated with the surrounding forms, 
new divergences constantly coming in to take the iilace of the old; but 
if, during its brief period of local divergence, industrial or chronal 
segregation is introduced, the variety becomes more and more differen- 
tiated, and, as one after another the difterent forms of reflexive segre- 
gation arise, it passes into a well-defined species. There is however 
reason to believe that the order of events is often the reverse, reflexive 
forms of segregation being the cause of the first divergences. 

As spatial segregation does not depend upon diversity in the quali- 
ties and powers of the organism, so also it does not usually result in 
distributing tlu'. organism in ditt'erent localities according to their dif- 
ferences of endowment. The causes that i)r<)duce it are primarily 
sei)arative, not segregative. 

Migration is i)roduced by the natural powers of the organism, acting 
under the guidance of instincts that usually lead a grouj) of individuals, 
capable of pro])agating the species, to migrate together; while the 
organisms that are most dependent on activities in the environment for 
their distribution, are usually distributed in the form (»f seeds or germs, 
any one of which is capable of developing into a complete community. 

The causes of separation between the different sections, and of integra- 
tion between the members of one section, are therefore sufficiently 



304 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

clear, but what are the causes of difference of character in the different 
sections, especially when they are exposed to the same environment? 
These causes all come under what I call intensive segregation, which, 
for the sake of saving repetition, will be fully discussed in a separate 
paper. 

(d) Fertilizational segregation. 

Since writing this chapter on environal segregation I have seen 
Francis Galton's short article on " The Origin of Varieties," pul^lished 
in Nature, vol. xxxiv, p. 395, in which he refers to a cause of segrega- 
tion that had not occurred to me. He says: '^If insects visited pro- 
miscuously the flowers of a variety and those of the parent stock, then, 
supposing the organs of reproduction and the period of flowering to be 
alike in both and that hybrids between them could be i^roduced by 
artificial cross-fertilization, we should expect to find hybrids in abun- 
dance whenever members of the variety and those of the original stock 
occupied the same or closely contiguous districts. It is hard to account 
for our not doing so, except on the supposition that insects feel repug- 
nance to visiting the plants interchangeably." 

9. Following the form of nomenclature adopted in this paper, I vent- 
ure to call this ])rmcrp\e fertilizational segregation. 

It is evident that segregation of this form depends on divergence of 
character already clearly established, and therefore on some other form 
of segregation that has preceded. It is also segregative rather than 
separative, in that it perpetuates a segregation previously produced, 
which might otherwise be obliterated by the distribution of the differ- 
ent forms in the same district. The form of segregation that precedes 
fertilizational segregation, producing the conditions on which it de- 
pends, must, from the nature of the case, be local segregation. Chronal 
and impregnational segregation, when imperfectly established, might 
be fortified by fertilizational segregation; but, in the case of plants, 
these are all dependent on previous local segregation. 

(e) Artificial segregation. 

Artificial segregation is segregation arising from the relations in 
which the organism stands to the rational environment. As the oper- 
ation of this cause is familiar, and as it was considered in the last chap- 
ter when discussing the effects of segregation, we pass on, simply 
calling attention to the fact that it is a form of environal segregation. 

THE IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONAL SEGREGATION. 

We must not assume that the various forms of environal segregation 
are of small influence in the formation of species because sexual or 
impregnational incompatibility is a more essential feature, without 
which all other distinctions are liable to be swept away. The impor- 
tance of the forms of segregation discussed in this chapter lies in the fact 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 305 

that they often open the way for tlie entrance of the moic fnndamental 
forms of segregation, even if they are not essential conditions for the 
development of the same. Though myriads of divergent forms pro- 
duced by local and industrial segregations are swept away iji the strug- 
gle for existence, and myriads are absorbed in the vast tides of crossing 
and i liter-crossing currents of life, the power of any species to produce 
more and more highly adapted variations, and to segregate them in 
grouj)s tliat become specially adapted to special ends, or tliat groAv into 
speciti*' forms of beauty and internal harmony, is largely dependent on 
these factors.

DESCRIPTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF CUMULATIVE 

seCtReoation (continued). 
B. reflexive segregation. 

lietlexive segregation is segregation arising from the relations in 
which the members of one species stand to each other. 

It includes three classes, which 1 call conjunctional, impr<'gnational, 
and institutional segregation. 

It is important to observe that intergeneration recjuires compatibility 
in all the circle of relations in which the organism stands; but, in order 
to insure segregation between any two or more sections of a species, it 
is suflicient that incompatibility should exist at but one point. If 
either sexual or social instincts do not accord, if structural or dimen- 
sional characters are not correlated, if the sexual elements are not 
mutually potential, or if fixed institutions hold groups apart, inter- 
geniMation is prevented, and se-generation is the result, either as 
segicgation, or as separation that is gradually transformed into segre- 
gation. 

(a) CovJiDuiional srr/rr(f<(fi(>n. 

Conjunctional segregation is segregation arising fioin the instincts 
by which organisms seek each other and hold togetliei' in more or less 
compact eoinnuinities, or IVoni the powers of giowth and segmentation 
in eonneetiou with self-fertilization, through whicli similar results are 
gaiiu'd. 

I <listinguish four forms, social, sexual, gerniinal. and lloial segre- 
gation. 

10. Social sr(in;i((tii>ii is produced b\ the <liscriniina)ive action of 
social instincts. 

The hnv of social instinct is i)reference for that which is familiar in 
one's companions; and, as in most cases the greatest familiarity is 
gained with those that are near of kin. it tends to i)roduce bleeding 
within the clan, which is a form of segregate breeding. If the clan 
never grows beyond the powei's of individual recognition, or if the

306 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

niiinbers nevor become so j^reat as to impede each other in gaining siis- 
teiiauce, there will be but little occasion for segregation; but mul- 
tiplication will lead to segmentation. Wherever the members of a 
species, ranging freely over a given area, divide up into separate herds, 
flocks, or swarms, of wMiich the members produced in any one clan 
breed with eai^h other more than wnth others, there we have social 
segregation. 

It should always be kept in mind that social segregation arises at a 
very early stage, holding apart groups not at all or but very slightly 
diiferentiated ; while in the case of many animals, the eager sexual 
instincts of the males constantly tend to break up these minor groups. 
Though tlie barriers i-aiscd by social instincts are often broken over, 
their influence is not wholly overcome; and in many instances the social 
segregation becomes more and more pronounced, till in time decided 
sexual segregation comes in to secure and strengthen tlie divergence. 

11. Sexual sef/regatio7i is produced by the discriminative action of 
sexual instincts. 

There can be no doubt that sexTial instincts often ditter in such a 
way as to produce segregation. But how shall we account for these 
ditterences'? In the case of social segregation there is no difSculty, for 
it seems to l)e, like migration, due to a constant instinct, always tend- 
ing to segregation. We also see that an endowment which i^revents 
the destruction of the si)ecies through the complete isolation of indi- 
viduals, and wliich co-operates with migrational instincts in securing 
dispersal without extinction, may be perfected by the accunuilating 
efiects of its own action. And is there any greater difficulty in ac- 
counting for the law that regulates sexual instincts"? If it can be 
shown that vigor and variation, the conditions on which adaptation 
depends, are in their turn dependent on some degree of crossing, there 
will be no difficulty in attributing the development of an instinct that 
secures the crossing to the superior success of the individuals that 
possess it in even a small degree. On the other hand, whenever there 
arises a variety that can maintain itself by crosses within the same 
variety, any variation of instinct that tends to segregation will be 
preserved by the segregation. It needs no experiments to prove that 
if the members of a species are imx)elled to consort only with the 
members of other species, they will either fail to leave oft'spring or 
their oft'spring will fail to inherit the characteristics of the species. 
The same is true concerning the (continuance of a variety that is not 
otherwise segregated. The power of variation on the one hand, and 
the power of divergent accumulation of variations on the other hand, 
are prime necessities ior creatures that are wresting a living from a 
vast and complex environment; and the former is secured by the ad- 
vantage over rivals possessed by the variations that favor crossing, 
and the latter by the better escape from the swamping effect, and 
sometimes from the com])etition of certain rivals, secured by the more 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 307 

scfiregative variatioiiis. We must therefore believe that whenever in 
tlie history of an organism there arise segregative variations which are 
able to secure sufficient sustentation and propagation to continue the 
species, the segregative quality of the forms thus endowed will be 
preserve<l and accuniulated througli the self-accumulating effect of the 
segregative endowments. 

It is probable that in many of the higher vertebrates sexual instincts 
tend to bring together those of somewhat divergent character, but the 
dift'erence preferred is within very narrow limits, and beyond those 
limits, it may be said that the general law for sexual attraction is that 
it varies inversely as the diflfci-ence in the characters of the races rep- 
resented, if not inversely as some power of such ditierence. The action 
of such a law is necessarily segregative, whenever the divergence has, 
through other causes, passed beyond the limit of higher attraction. 
iJefore sexual segregation can arise there must arise distinctive charac- 
teristics by means of which the members of any section may discriminate 
between those of their own and other sections. If there are no con- 
stant characteristics there can be no constant aversicm between members 
of difterent groups, no constant preference of those of one's own group. 
From this it follows, that before sexual segregation can arise, some 
form of segregaticm that is not dependent on accumulated divergence 
of character must have produced the divergence on which the sexual 
segregation depends. Such forms are local, social, and some kinds of 
industrial segregation. When varieties have arisen through these 
causes it often happens that sexual segregation comes in and perpetu- 
ates the segregation which the initial causes can no longer sustain. 
As long as the groups are held ai)art by divergent sexual instincts, it 
is evident that divergent forms of sexual selection are almost sure to 
arise, lea<ling to a further accumulation of the divergence initiated by 
the previous causes. 

If tliere is any persistent cause by which local and social gnmps are 
broken up and promiscuously intermingled before recognizable charac- 
ters are gained, the entrance of sexual segregation will be prevented. 
I therefore conclude that the chief influence of this latter factor is 
found in its prolonging and fortifying the sei)arate breeding of varie- 
ties that have arisen under local, social, or industrial segregation, and 
in thus continuing the necessary condition for the develo])ment of 
increasingly diveigcnt i'orms of intensive segregation, under which the 
organism i)asses by the laws of its own vital activity when dealing with 
a complex environment in groups that never cross. 

IL*. (iermhud sff/rcf/dtion is caused by the propagation of the S])ecies 
by means of seeds or germs any one of which, when developed, forms 
a community so related that the members breed with each other more 
frciiuently tlian with the mend)ers of other communities. If the con- 
stitution of any species is such that the ovules ])i-oduced from one seed 
are more likely to be reached and fertilized by i)ollen produced from 



308 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

the same seed than by pollen prodnced from any other one seed, then 
germinal segregation is the result. 

In order to secure this kind of segregation it is not necessary that 
the flowers fertilized by pollen from the same plant should be more 
fertile, or the seeds capable of producing more vigorous plants than the 
flowers fertilized by pollen fnmi another plant. All that is required is 
that of the seeds produced a larger number shall be fertilized by the 
pollen of the same plant than by the pollen of any other one i)lant. 

This form of segregation is closely related to local segregation on one 
side, and to social segregation on the other. It however differs from 
the former in that it does not depend on migration or transportation, 
and from the latter in that it does not depend on social instincts. 

13. Floral sefjregation is segregation arising from the closest form of 
self-fertilization, namely, the fertilization of the ovules of a flower by 
pollen from the same flower. 

Many plants that in their native haunts are frequently crossed by 
the visits of insects depend entirely on self-fertilization when trans- 
ported to other countries where no insect is found to perform the same 
service for them. The common pea {Pisum sativum) is an example of 
a species that habitually fertilizes itself in England, though Darwin 
found that it was very rarely visited by insects that were capable of 
carrying the pollen.* Darwin also mentions Oplirys apifera as an 
orchid which "has almost certainly been propagated in a state of 
nature for thousands of generations without having been once inter- 
crossed."t 

A fact of great importance in its bearing on the origin of varieties 
should be here noted. Any variation, arising as a so-called sport, in 
any group of plants where either of these principals is acting strongly, 
will be restrained from crossing, and will be preserved except in so far 
as reversion takes place. Now there is always a possibility that some 
of the segregating branches of descent will not revert, and that 
through the special character which they possess in common, they will 
some time secure the services of some insect that will give them the 
benefit of cross-fertilization with each other without crossing with 
other varieties. The power of attaining new adaptations may be 
favored by self-fertilization, occasionally interrupted by inter-breeding 
with individuals of another stock; for the latter is favorable as intro- 
ducing vigor and variation, and the former as giving opportunity for 
the accumulation t)t variations. 

(6) Impregnational segregation. 

Impregnational segregation is due to the different relations in which 
the members of a species stand to each other in regard to the possi- 
bility of their producing fertile offspring when they consort together.

111 Older that iiiipregnational se^Tej^atiou should 1k' established and 
j)ei|)etiiated it is iiecessaiy: First, that variation slioiiUl arise from 
which it results that those of one kind are capable of producing vigor- 
ous and fertile oftsi)ring in greater numbers when breeding with each 
other than when bleeding with other kinds; second, that mutually 
compatible forms should be so brought together as to insure propaga- 
tion through a series oi' generations. In order to secure this second 
condition it is necessary that, in the case of plants, there should be 
some degree of local, germinal, or tloral segregation, and in the case of 
animals that pair, either pronounced local segregation, or partial local 
segregation supplemented by social or sexual segregation. The tirst 
of these factoi-s I call negative segregation, as contrasted with all 
otlier forms of segregation, which 1 grouj) together as positive segre- 
gation. 

Of each form of segregation which we have up to this point consid- 
ered, the segregating cause has been one that distributes individuals 
of the same species in groups between which free inter-generation is 
checked; while the propagation of the different groups depends simply 
on tlu^ original capacity for inter-generating common to all the members 
of the species. The inter-crossing has been limited not by the capacity 
but by the opportunity and inclination of the members. Coming now 
to cases in which the lack of ca]>acity is the cause that checks the jiro- 
duction of mongrels, we find a dependence of a very different kind; for 
to insure the projiagation of the different groups it is not enough that 
the general opportunity for the members to meet and consort remains 
unimpaired. There must be some additional segregating influence 
bringing the members together in groups corresponding to their seg- 
regate cai)acity, or they will fail of being iiropagated. 

A ]iartial exception must be made in the case of potential and 
pie-i)otential segregation, the latter being due to the pre-potency of 
the pollen of a species or variety, on the stigma of the same species 
or variety and the tbrnier to the complete impotence of the foreign 
l)ollen. When allied species of plants are i)romiscuously distrib- 
uted over the same districts, and flowering at the same time, pre-po- 
teiicv of this kind is one of the most direct and efficient causes of 
segregate breeding. The same must be true of varieties similarly dis- 
tributed whenever this cliaiacter begins to affect them. In the case, 
howev*'!', of did'cioiis )>laiits and of plants whose ovules are incapable of 
being impregnated by poUeii from the same plant, no single plant can 
propagate the species. If therefore the individuals so varying as to 
be x)re-])otent with each other are very few and are evenly distributed 
amongst a v^ast number of the original form, they will fail of being 
segregated through failing to receive any of the pre-potent pollen. It 
is thus ai)i>arent that when the mutually prepotent form is represented 
by comparatively few individuals, their proi)agation Avithout crossing- 
will depend on tlicii- l»eing self I'citile and subject to geniiiiial oi- Moral 



310 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

segregJitiou, or on their beiiij;- l)roiijilit togetlu'r l>y some or other form 
of positive segregation. 

When ti eonsiderabh' number of speeies of phuits are commingled 
and are tiowering at the same time, their separate propagation is pre- 
served, in no small degree, by the pre-potential segregation of those 
that aie most nearly iillied, and by the complete jjotential segregation 
of those that belong to different families, orders, and classes. The 
same iwinciple mnst come iu to prevent the crossing of different spe- 
cies, genera, families, and orders of animals whose fertilizing elements 
are distributed in the water. We must therefore consider it a form of 
positive as well as negative segregation ; for the free distribution of the 
fertilizing element, with the superior affinity of the two sexual elements 
when produced by those that are mutually pre-potential, secures the 
inter-breeding of those that are mutually pre-potential. 

Imi)regnational segregation generally exists between tlie different 
species of the same genus, almost always between species of different 
genera, and always between species of different families, orders, classes, 
and all groups of higher grade. And in all these cases it is associated 
with other forms of segregation, and whenever it has once become 
complete, it has never been known to give way. Though complete 
mutnal sterility never gives place to complete mutual fertility, in every 
case where the descendants of the same stock have developed into dif- 
ferent classes or orders, and in most cases where they have developed 
into different families of genera, the reverse i)rocess has taken place, 
and complete mutual fertility has given place to complete mutual ster- 
ility. 

Under impregnatioual segregation 1 distinguish live principles, 
namely, segregate size, segregate structure, potential and i)re-potential 
segregation, segregate fecundity, and segregate vigor. 

14. ^Scfjrefjate she is caused by incompatibility in size or dimensions. 
As familiar illustrations of this form of segregation, I may mention 

the following: The largest and smallest varieties of the ass may run m 
the same pasture without any chance of crossing. I have also kept 
Japanese bantam fowls in the same yard with other breeds without any 
crossing. In many other species individuals of extreme divergence in 
size are incapable of inter-breeding. 

15. /Segregate structure is caused by the lack of correlation in the pro- 
])ortionate size of different organs and by other incompatibilities of 
structure. 

Darwin suggests that the imi)OSsibility of a cross between certain 
species may be due to a lack of correspondence in length of the ])olIen 
tubes and pistils. Such a lack of harmony would perhaps account for 
difference of fertility in reciprocal crosses. 

Segregate structure does not usually arise till other forms ol segre- 
gathm have become so well established that ditference of structure does 
not make any essential difference in the am(»unt of inter-generation.

tile inter sc are tlms held ai)ait. in Broca's Avork on " Human Hybrid- 
ity"* there is a passage quoted IVoiii Prof. Serres, showing that it is 
very i)ossible that this Ibrin oi'ine(»nipatil)ility nuiy exist between cer- 
tain races of man. 

16. Poieniial scf/refjafion /nid pre-pofentiul se(/re(fation. — These are 
caused by more or less free distril)ution of the fertilizing- element, 
together with the greater rapidity and power with which the sexual 
elements of the same species, race, or individual combine, as contrasted 
with the rapidity and i)(>\verwith which the elements of diflerent spe- 
cies, races, or individuals combine. l*otential segregation is caused 
by the mutual im])otence of the contrasted forms, as is always the 
case between different orders and classes, and pre-potential segregation 
is caused by the superior influence of the fertilizing element from tlie 
same species, race, or individual, as contrasted with that from any 
other species, race, or individual, when both are a])plied to the same 
female at the same time, or sometimes when the prepotent element is 
ajtplied many hours after the other. 

For the operation of this principal the fertilizing element from difler- 
ent males must be brought to the same female. 

When i)ollen from a contrasted genus, order, or class has no more 
effect than inorganic dust, it seems appropriate that we should call the 
result potential segregation rather than pre-potential segregation, which 
implies that the foreign as well as the home pollen is capable of produc- 
ing impregnation. Pre-potential segregation may be considered the 
initial form of potential segregation, the former passing through 
innumerable grades of intensity in the latter. We may therefore con- 
sider the principles as fundamentally one, though it will be convenient 
to retain both names. 

The importance of this principle in producing and preserving the 
diversities of the vegetable kingdom can hardly be overstated. If 
pollen of every kind were equally i)otent on every stigma what would 
the result be? What distinctions would remain? And if potential 
segregatiou is necessary for the preservation of distinctions, is it not 
eipially necessary for their production? Amongst water animals that 
do not i)air the same principle of segregation is ])robably of equal im- 
portance. Concerning this form of segregation numy questions of great 
interest suggest themselves, answers to which are not found in any 
investigations with which 1 am acquainted. Some of these questions 
are as follows : 

(1) Are there many cases of pre potential as well as of potential seg- 
regation between different forms of water animals? 

(2) Is pre-i)Otential segregation always accompanied by segregate 
fecundity and segregate vigor '!

(3) If not always associated, which of the three principles first 
appears, aud what are their relations to each other ? 

(4) When allied organisms are separated by complete environal seg- 
regation are they less liable to be separated by these three lirinciples? 

Darwin has in several places referred to the influence of prepotency 
in pollen, and in two x^laces I have found reference to the form of i)re- 
potency that pioduces segregation; l)ut 1 lind no intimation that he 
regarded this or any other form of segregation as a cause of divergent 
evolution, or as a necessary condition for the operation of causes pro- 
ducing divergent evolution. The effect of pre-potency in pollen from 
another plant in preventing self-fertilization is considered in the tenth 
chapter of his work on "Cross and self fertilization in the vegetable 
kingdom," x)p. 391-400. Some very remarkable observations concern- 
ing the pre-potency of pollen from another variety from that in which 
the stigma grows, are recorded in the same chapter; but no reference is 
there made to the effect that must be produced when the pollen of each 
variety is pre-potent on the stigma of the same variety. In the six- 
teenth chai)ter of " Variation under Domestication " it is suggested 
that pre-potency of this kind might be a cause of different varieties f>f 
double hollyhock reproducing themselves truly when growing in one 
bed; though there was another cause to which the freedom from cross- 
ing in this case had been attributed. Again, in chapter viii of the 
fiftli edition* of the "The origin of species,'' in the section on "The 
origin and causes of sterility," Darwin, while maintaining that the 
mutual sterility of vspecies is not due to natural selection, refers to pre- 
potency of the kind w^e are now considering as a quality which, occur- 
ring in ever so slight a degree, would prevent deterioration of charac- 
ter, and which woidd therefore be an advantage to a species in the 
process of formation, and accordingly subject to accnnuilation tlirough 
natural selection. In order to construct a possible tlieory for the intro- 
duction of sterility between allied species by means oi' natural selec- 
tion, he finds it necessary simply to add the snp]>ositi()ii tliat sterility 
is directly caused by this prepotency. He however for several reasons 
concludes that there is no such dependence of nuitual sterility on the 
process of natural selection. Concerning the x)i'e potency he makes no 
reservation, and 1 accordingly judge tliat he continued to regard it as 
strengthened and developed through the action of natnral selection. 

It is concerning this last i)oint that T wish to give reasons for a dif- 
ferent opinion. 1 believe that qualities sinqjly producing segregation 
can never be accumulated by natural selection, for — 

(1) When separate generation comes in between two sections of a 
species they cease to be one aggregate, subject to modification through 
the elimination of certain x)arts. Both will be subject to similar forms 
of natural selection only so long as the circumstances of both and the 



"' Since my comments on tLis )>.issnge were written, I have discovered tliat Darwin 
has omitted it from the sixtli edition. 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 313 

variations of both iM<' nearly the same, but tliey will no longer be the 
members of one l)ody bt'tAvcen which the selecting' process is carried 
out. Ou the contrary, if they occujjy the same district each group 
will stand in the relation of environment to the other, modifying it 
and being nioditicd by it, witlnnit mutually sharing in the same modi- 
fication. 

(2) Though one may exterminate the other, the change that comes 
to the successful group through the contest is not due to its superiority 
o\er the other, but to the superiority of some of its own members over 
others. 

(3) When any segregate form begins to arise we can not attribute its 
success to the advantage of se-generation, for the inter-generating forms 
are at the same time equally successful; wherefore it is uot the success? 
but the separateness of the success, that is due to the se-generation. 

(4) The continuance of the descendants of a gnmp in a special form 
will dei)end on its segregation, but this is a very different thing from 
the special success of its descendants. The preservation of a special 
kind of adaptation is never due to natural selection, whicli is the supe- 
rior success of the higher (J<<}rc('s of adaptation of every kind. 

(5) The power of migration, or any other power directly related to 
the environment, nmy be accumulated by natural sele('tion, and after- 
ward lead to segregation, but, according to my method of judging, the 
continuous advantage of segregation over integration can never be 
shown, for both are equally essential in the economy of nature; and 
though one process may at one time predominate over the other, the 
comparative advantage of segregation, if there be such advantage, can 
not be the cause of the preservation of forms endowed with segregative 
(puilities, for they will certainly be i)reserved as long as they are able 
to win a bar(^ existence, Avhich is often a lower grade of success than 
the one from Avhicli they are ])assing. 

(6) According to my view, instead of the accumulation of the segre- 
gative pi-e-i>otency depending on natural seh^ction, the accumulation of 
divergent forms of natural selection depends on some form of segrega- 
t ion. 

l>ut if tlie accumulation of pre-potential segregation is not due to 
natural selection, how shall we explain it? It is I think due to the 
fact that those forms that have the most of this character are, through 
its action, caus<Ml to breed together. We have already seen, wImmi 
consi(h'ring seasonal and sexual segregation, that if segregation is 
directly i)roduced by the instincts or x)hysiological constitution of the 
organism, there is a tendency toward an increasing manifestation of 
the character in successive generations. Those that have but a slight 
degree of segregate prepotency eventually coalesce, forming one 
race, while those possessing the same character in a higher degree 
remain nn>re distim-t, and their descendents become still more .segrega- 
gate and still UKtre ]>ermanently divergent. As long as the segregate 



314 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROU(iH SEGREGATION. 

forms are able to maintain vigor and secure fair sustentation, the pro- 
cess continues and the separation becomes more pronounced. Of this 
form of the law of cumulative segregation we may say, that as thi' 
descendants of the best titted necessarily generate with each other and 
produce those still better fitted, so the descendants of those possessing 
the most segregative endowments necessarily generate with each other 
and produce those that are still more segregate. 

It may at first appear that a slight degree of pre-potence will prevent 
crossing as effectually as a higher degree; but fuither reflection will 
show that the efficiency of the prevention will vary in du^ect propor- 
tion with the length of time over which the prepotent pollen is able to 
show its pre-potence, and this will allow of innumerable grades. If, in 
the case of certain individuals, the prepotency is measured by about 
twenty minutes, while with other individuals it enables the pollen of 
the same variety to prevail, though reaching the stigma an hour after 
the ]»ollen of another variety has been applied, the diff'erence in the 
degree of segregation will be sufficient to make the persistence of the 
latter much more i)robable than that of the former. This form of 
segregation is evidently one of the important causes preventing the 
free crossing of different species of plants. It probably has but little 
influence on terrestrial animals, but how far it is the cause of segrega- 
tion among aquatic animals is a question of no small interest, concern- 
ing which I have but small means for judging. I have however no 
hesitation in predicting that, unless we make the presence of this 
segregative quality the occasion for insisting that the forms so affected 
belong to different species, we shall find that amongst plants the vari- 
eties of the same species are often more or less separated from each 
other in this way. I do not know of any experiments that have been 
directed toward the determining of this point, but on the general prin- 
ciple that physiological evolution is not usually abrupt, and that race 
distincti(ms are the initial forms under which specific differences present 
themselves, I can have no doubt that feel)le pre-potence precedes that 
which is more j)ronounced, and that j)art of this divergence in many 
cases takes place, while the divergent branches maybe properly classed 
as varieties. Another reason for believing that pre-potential segrega- 
tion will be found on further investigation to exist in some cases 
between varieties, is the constancy with which, in the case of species, 
this character is associated with segregate fecundity and segregate 
vigor, which we know are sometimes characteristics of varieties in their 
relation to each other. The importance of these latter principles when 
occurring in connection with different forms of partial segregation will 
now be considered. 

17,18. Segregate fecundity and segregate vigor. — By segregate fecun- 
dity I mean neither segregation produced by fecundity nor fecundity 
produced by segregation, but the relation in wliich species or varieties 
stand to each other when the inter-generation of members of the 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 315 

same species or vaiiety results in liiglier fertility tluiii the eros.sing of 
rtifferent specii^s or varieties. Tn like mauner segregate vigor is the 
relation in which species or varieties stand to each other when the in- 
ter-geueratiou of members of the same species or variety produces oft- 
spring more vigorous than those produced by crossing with other species 
oi' \arieties. Integrate fecundity and integrate vigor are the terms 
by wliich I indicate the rehition to each other of forms in which the 
higliest fertility Jind vigor are jn-oduced by crossing, and not by inde- 
IKMident generation. 

Before discussing these principles through which the iutlueuce of 
segregation is greatly increased, it will be an advantage if we can gain 
scmie idea of the nature of cumulative fertility in its relations to a law 
of still wider import. 1 refer to the fourfold law of antagonistic in- 
crease and mutual limitation b^ween (1) integration, (2) segregation, 
(3) ada[)tation, (4) multiplication — in other words, between (1) general 
invigoration and jxjwer of variation through crossing, (2) the opening 
of new opportunities and independent possibilities, (3) special adapta- 
tion to i)resent circumstances, (4) powers of multiplied individualiza- 
tion. Darwin has considered at length the iirst and third, thongh I do 
not remember that he has anywhere pointed out that their development 
is due to a kind of self-augmentation. I ])elieve this is so emphatically 
the case that the former might well be called the law of self-cnmulative 
vigor, and the latter the law of self-cumulative adaptation. Corre- 
sponding to these two laws, I find the additional laws of self-cumulative 
segregation and self-cunuilative fertility. Darwin's theory, that diver- 
sity of natural selection is directly and necessarily dependent on ex- 
posure to different external conditions tends to obscure, though not to 
deny, the fact that the breeding together of the better adapted, which 
canses the iiu-rease of adaptation, is due to the different degrees of en- 
dowment in the organism, rather than to diversity in the environment. 
It is also true of segregative endowment and of fertility that they are 
necessarily cumulative whenever they belong in different degrees to 
mend)ers of the same intergenerant that are equally fitted. The cum- 
ulation of vigor, as that of adaptation, is I think rightly classed as a 
form of selection; for in both cases it depends on the power of the 
more highly endowed to supplant the less endoAved without allowing 
them full opportunity to propagate ; but the increase of segregative 
endow incuts aiul of fertility is dne to ]>riuciples quite different from 
this, and differing from each other. The segregative endowments aug- 
nu'ut through the inherent tendency of the more highly endowed to 
hree<l more exclusively with those of the same form, and therefore in 
the long run to breed moi-e exclusively with each other; while the fer- 
tility of the more fertile neither drives out the less fertile nor holds 
the two classes apart, but simply multiplies the offspring of the more 
fertile, making it sure that in each generation they will predominate. 

But all those forms of augmentation correspond, in that they secure 



316 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

the breeding togetber of those ])o.ssessiiig- higher degrees of the special 
endowment, and so increase the average endowment, either of the 
whole number of the offspring or of the segregated portion. Vigor 
increases through the breeding together of the more vigorous, resulting 
from their overcoming and crowding out the less vigorous without 
allowing them full opportunity to propagate. Adaptation increases 
tlirough the breeding together of the better adapted, resulting from 
their supphmting their rivals without allowing them full oppor- 
tunity to propagate. Segregative endowments increase through the 
breeding together of the more highly endowed, resulting from the fact 
that as long as segregation is incomplete more than half of each gen- 
eration of pure descent are necessarily the offspring of parents whose 
segregative endowments were above the average. Fertility increases 
through the breeding together of the more fertile, resulting from the 
fact that more than half of each generation are the offspring of ])arents 
of more than average fertility. As the breeding together of the more 
vigorous and the better adapted, caused by their superior success, 
tends to increase and intensify tlie vigor and adaptation of successive 
generations, so the breeding together of those more highly endowed 
with segregative powers, caused by the segregation, tends to strengthen 
and intensify the segregative powers in successive generations; and so 
the breeding together of the more fertile, caused by the larger propor 
tion of offspring produced by the more fertile, tends to increase the 
fertility of successive generations. Among those that would be equally 
productive if equally nourished, the ratio of propagation varies directly 
as the degree of sustentation above a certain minimum (and perhaps 
below a certain maximum), and therefore directly as the degree of 
adaptation that secures this sustentation. This propagation according 
to degrees of adaptation to the environment in ivhat I understand hy natural 
seJection. But among those that are equally adapted to the environ- 
ment the ratio of propagation varies directly as the ratio of fertility. 
This propagation according to degrees of fertility is what I call the law 
of cumulative fertHity. It is not due to different degrees of success, or 
to any advantage which the individuals of one form have over those of 
other forms; but simply to the higher ratio of multiplication in the 
more fertile forms securing the inter-generation of the more fertile. In 
connection n^th natural selection it insures, in the descendants, the predomi- 
nance of the better adapted of the more fertile (tnd the more fertile of the 
hetter adapted. 

At the close of the previous chapter I called attention to the fact 
that innumerable local segregations and other imperfect forms of 
se-generation are being constantly broken down, partly by the increase 
of numbers and partly by the superior fertility and vigor of offspring 
produced by crossing. It seems to be a fundamental law that vigor 
and variation in the offspring depend on some degree of diversity of 
constitution in the parents, ami diversity of constitution that is not 



DIVKKGENT r:A^OI>rTION TIIK(JUG1I SEGREGATION. 317 

entirely Huctuatius (Icpends on some degree of positive segTejjation ; 
therefore vigor and variation depend on the breaking down of incii)ient 
segregations, and on the interfusion of the sliglitly divergent forms 
thiif had been partially segregated. But in the history of every race 
that is winning success by its vigor and variation there is liable to 
conic a time Avhen some variety, inheriting sufVicient vigor to sustain 
itself, even if limited to the beuelits of crossing with the individuals of 
tlie same varii^ty, becomes partially segregated. As we have already 
seen, segregation, in so far as it depends on the (jualities of the organ- 
ism, tends ever to become more and more intense; biit, in the very 
nature of tilings, not only will the segregation be foi- many generations 
only partial, but partial segregation, though it may greatly delay the 
submerging of different groups in one common group, will never jire- 
vent that result being finally reached. Though the siphon that con- 
nects two tanks of wafer be ever so snmll, the water will in time find a 
common level in both tanks, unless there are additions or subtractions 
of water that prevent such a result. So, in the case under considera- 
tion, final fusion Avill take ])lace, uidess diflt'erentiation lu-ogresses more 
rapidly than the fusion, or some other infiuence comes in to counteract 
the levelling infiuence of occasional crosses. If, under such conditions, 
some branch of the partially segregated variety becomes more fertile 
when generating with members of the same variety, and less fertile 
when generating with other varieties, a i)riuciple will be introduced 
tending to strengthen any form of partial segregation that already 
exists between the varieties. This principle when co-operating with 
jiartial segregation will i)roduce pure masses of each variety, when, 
without the action of this lunnciple, all distinctions would be absorbed 
by the crossing. We know that a transition from integrate fecundity 
to segregate fecundity usually takes place at a point in the history of 
evolution interme<liate between the formation of an incipient variety 
and a strongly-marked species; and though the causes that produce 
this transition may be very difficult to trace, I believe the results that 
uuist follow can l»e pointed out with considerable clearness and cer- 
tainty. 

Darwin's investigations have shown that in numy cases, if not in the 
majority, the lelation of varieties to (^ach other is that which I have 
called integrate fecundity and integrate vigor; that is, the highest 
fertility is attained Avhen varieties are crossed, and the vigor of off- 
spring thus produced is greater than when the inter-generation is within 
the limits of one variety, lie, however, gives in " Variation under 
domestication," chapter xvi, some special cases, in which "varieties 
of the same si)ecies behave, when crossed, like closely aUied but distinct 
species:" and remarks that similar cases "may not be of very rare oc- 
currence, for the subject has not been attended to." The same cases 
are also mentioned in all the editions of the "Origin of Species."* 
* See 1st edition, p. 238; 5th edition, p. 259; 6th edition, p. 258. 



318 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

The problems th;it arise in considering' the different results produced 
by ditterent degrees of positive segregation and segregrate fecundity 
are of a nature suitable for mathematical treatment. Before, however, 
computing the effects of segregate fecundity when co-operating with 
positive segregation, it will be in place to show that it is of itself only 
a negative form of segregation, having no j)ower to insure the propaga- 
tion of the varieties thus characterized, though they are fully adapted 
to the environment. This is most easily brought to light by consider- 
ing the effect of a high degree of this quality when positive segregation 
is entirely wanting, or when it is sufficient to give simply a chance of 
segregate breeding by bringing each individual near to its natural mate. 
For exami)le, let us suppose, first, that a male and a female each of 
several* allied but mutually sterile species are brought together on one 
small island, all other tendencies to positive segregation being removed, 
while mTitual sterilty still remains 5 second, that a male and female when 
once mated remain together for the breeding season; and third, that all 
find mates. Kow, if we have seven species, each represented by one 
individual of each sex, what is the probability that all the species will 
be propagated ? And what the probability for the propagation of none, 
or of but one, or of but two, or of but three of the species ? The answers, 
as I have computed them, are as follows : The i)robability that none 
will be propagated is iff^; that one species will be is ifff; that two 
species -Hhj tt»fit three species 5-0-4-0 j tliat four species -^040 5 that five 
species 5^0 ; ^^^^t seven species g-oVo- These numerators are found in 
the seventh line of a table that I call the Perniutational Triangle. If 
we have ten species, the probability that in any one trial no species 
will match truly and be propagated is ^|ffi; that one species will 
match truly and propagate is ifllloo; that ten will is - ^^^olsoo - Tl'i*^ 
means that if 3,()28,800 trials are made, one of them will probal)ly be a 
case in which each male pairs with the female of the same species, while 
1,334,961 will be cases in which none are so matched, and 1,334,960 Avi'l 
be cases in which one pair is so matched. It therefore appears that 
more than eight-elevenths of the probabilities are against the continu- 
ance of more than one of the ten species. 

There will perhaps be some hesitation in receiving these figures before 
I have given the method by which the results have been reached ; but 
the necessary length of this paper, even when restricted to the briefest 
discussion of general principles, induces me to reserve my comi)uta- 
tions for another occasion. It is not however necessary to have a 
complete solution of this problem, in order to reach the conclusion that 
the origin of seixirate races and species depends not only upon their 
adaptation to the environment and their mutual sterility when crossing 
with each other, but also upon their positive segregation. We can 
further see (when considering an extreme case, like either of the above 
supposed cases) that segregate fecundity, without the aid of positive 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 31!) 

segregation, must lead to extinction. We have already seen that par- 
tial segregation can not by itself prevent the fusion of species. It 
therefore follows that in order to account for the continuance of diverg- 
ent races we must suppose either that the segreg'ation is complete or 
that the divergent evolution is strong enough to more than counter- 
l)alance the intluence of the occasional crossing, or that the partial seg- 
regation is aided by segregate fecundity oi- segregate vigor. 

lietween the members of species belonging to different orders Ave tind 
not only complete segregation, but complete sterility when attemj)tsat 
crossing are made ; but hope of gaining an explanation of how these 
characteristics have arisen is found, not in the study of those cases in 
which the i>rocess has been comj)lete<l, but in tlie study of the relations 
to each other of species and varieties that are characterized by ])artial 
segregation and mutual sterility, that is not complete. Here again 
mathematical analysis will help us in understanding the subject. 
Tliough 1 have not succeeded in constructing acomi^lete mathematical 
representation of all the grades of intermingling that will take place, I 
have found a general formula that gives a close approximation to the 
proportion in which two species will breed pure as contrasted with the 
proportion of first crosses and their descendants that will be produced, 
in any case in which the degree of segregation and the ratios of fertility 
for th(^ pure and cross breeds are known. As my object is simply to 
show under what conditions the pure races will continue without being 
swami)ed by (irossing, it is not necessary that I should follow the action 
and reaction between the three-quarter breeds. I wish however to 
call attention to the fact that when the number of the pure forms and 
of the half-breeds is constantly decreasing, without a general decrease 
in the sum of the descendants, it is evident that the three-quarter breeds 
and their descendants are increasing; and when a three-quarter breed 
on one side crosses with a three-quarter breed on the other side, the 
offspring will usually be about intermediate between the two species; 
tlierefore, where tlie two species are equally numerous, if we find that 
tlie pure forms will disappear through fusion, we may expect that the 
tliree-ipiarter breeds will also disappear through fusion. 

In constructing my fornuila it was found necessary to commence by 
l)lacing in the 1st generation of the half-breeds a more or less arbi- 
traiy symbol; for the true symbol in each case is the final one reached 
in the »th generation when n is a very high number. The chief ijiter- 
est therefore centers in what can be accomplished through the use of 
tliis fornmla for the «th generation. It seems to me to furnish a 
method of reaching the tin;il proportion of pure breeding that will be 
produced by any form ol' combination between positive segregation 
and segregate fecundity, and to give results that would require thou- 
saiuls of years of continuous expeiimenting to reach in any other way.

The three-quarter-breeds are obtained by multiplying -pu of the previous genera- 
tion of half-breeds l)y 2, and adding to the result the sum of the previous genera- 
tions of three-quarter-breeds. This of course gives a number too large ; for some of 
the three-quarter-breeds will fail to breed Avith three-quarter-breeds. A closer 
expression of the proportion between pure-breeds and three-quarter-breeds is given 
in Tables vii and viii.

METHOD OF USING TA15LE III. 

By supposiiig- n to be an iudefinitely liigh number, and by giving 
different vabies to M, m, and e, we sliall have the means of contrasting 
the number of tlie i)ure-breeds witli tliat of the half-breeds, when the 
process lias been long continued under different degrees of positive 
segregation and segregate fecundity. 

In the first place, let us take a case in which there is no segregate 
fecundity, that is M = m; and for convenience in computation let us 
make M=l, m=l. In every case where m is not larger than M the 

(1— 2c) ill 

fraction Tyr_^ is less than unity, and the sum of the geometrical 

progression of our formula will fall within the limits of a number that 

can be easily computed by the well-known formula S=^ _ in whicli 

a is the first number of the progression, whicli in this case is 1, and q 
is the fraction we are now considering. Supposing c=-^, the fraction 

will be ^ ~ 1 =f =g, .-. S=:j-^ becomes 8 = ^ — ^=^—^=9. This 

number 9 is therefore equal to the sum of this progression and can, 
therefore, l)e used as the value of the infinite progression in the formula 
for the «th generation when »i is a very high number. Substituting 
these values we find that the nth generation of the lialf-breeds equals 
the »th generation of the pure forms, each being equal to ^"{, of A 
(M— Mc)«-i. A (M— Me)»-^ is a vanishing quantity, for M— Mo is less 
than 1. Every form is therefore in time fused with other forms. But 
let us try higher degrees of segregation. If we make c=j^q or toVo? 
we still find that half-breeds =pure-breeds, while the latter are con- 
stantly decreasing, which shows that imperfect positive segregation, 
without the aid of some quality like segregate fecundity, can not pre- 
vent a species being finally fused wath other species as long as the 
w^hole number of each successive generation does not increase. 

Let us now consider cases in which the Segregation is incomplete, but 
Segregate Fecundity comes in to modify the result. Let M=2, w = l, 
c=i^Q. Substituting these values in our formula, w^e shall find that 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 323 

the sum of the iufinite progression is f=if. And M— Mc=if, which 
makes the half-breeds=the pure forms xcw; andem=iV Let M=2, 
w=l, r=-iio; tlien ha]f-breeds=piire forms x too- I^et M=2, w=l, 
c=i; then the infinite progression^!, M — Mc=l, and the pure forms 
in eacli generation will equal A, and the half-breeds Ax 4. Therefore 
Half-breeds=Pure-breeds x i. 

Let ]M=3, w=2, r=i; then the sum of the infinite progression =1, 
and theHalf-breeds=i x 2 x A(M— Mc)h-i, and the Pure-breeds=li x A 
(M — Mr)"-i; therefore Half-breeds=Pure-breedsx§. 

Let M=3, m=2, c=^; then IIalf-breeds=Pure breeds xf-

OBSERVATIONS ON TABLE V. 



This mathematical analysis of the effects of positive segregation and 
segregate fecundity when cooperating brings distinctly into view sev- 
eral important relations 

First. Incomplete forms of segregation, that avail little or nothing in 
preventing a form from being absorbed in the course of time, become 
very efficient when strengthened by moderate degrees of mutual steril- 
ity. Take, for instance, the line of the table in which c = yio- If 1 i^ 
every 100 unions is a cross with some other lorm, the form will in time 
be overwhelmed, unless other causes come into counteract; but here 
we see that, if segregate fecundity occurs in the ratio of 10 to 0, the 
pure form becomes 12 times as numerous as the half-breeds ; and if in 
the ratio of 10 to 5, it becomes 100 times as numerous. 

Second. Again, if we take the proportional differences between the 
different terms of the top line opposite c = ^, we shall find thein very 
unlike the differences that appear in the bottom line opposite c = tq-o o- 
In the former the first term is 9 times as large as the last; while in the 
latter the first term is more than 80 times as large as the last. This 
shows that when segregation is intense, differences in the degree of segre- 
gate fecundity produce greater contrasts than the same differences do 
when the segregation is slight. 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 325 

Third. A siiiiiliir distiuctioii is touiid wbeu we compare the rig'ht- 
haud cohimii with the left-liaiid cohimn. The smallest term iu the for- 
mer is to the largest term iu the same column as 1 to 899, while in the 
left-hand column the greatest difference is as 1 to 100. This shows that 
when segregate fecundity is strongly developed, differences in the de- 
grees of segregation produce greater contrasts than the same differ- 
ences produce when the segregate fecundity is but slightly developed. 

Fourth. Once more let us consider the relations to each other of 
the four terms that stand iu the upper left-hand corner of the table. 
Su])pose that of some one variety of a plant species, characterized by 
pre-potential segregation and segregate fecundity, we have occurring in 
equal numbers four variations whose relations to other varieties are 
indicated by the figures given iu these four terms, while in their rela- 
tions to each other they are completely fertile and not segregated. 
Which variation will leave the greatest number of pure offspring ; that 
is, the greatest number of offspring belouging to the one variety to 
which the four variations alike belong? Evidently the variations rep- 
resented by the fraction ^o- will have the greatest influence on the fol- 
lowing generation. But as the supposed conditions allow of exact 
computation, let us look at the problem a little closer. If each varia- 
tion numbers say a thousand individuals, then the number of each that 
"will breed true will be as follows: Of the one rei)resented by — 

-1^0, 526 will breed true aud 474 will cross, 
■j^f, 550 will breed true and 450 will cross, 
"1%) 555.5 will breed true and 444.5 Avill cross, 
-^, 600 will breed true and 400 will cross. 

And the next generation of each kind will be as follows: Multiplying 
the pure parents by 10, and the hybrid parents by 8 or 9, according to 
the value of m, we have those represented by — 

1^0, pure offspring 5260, hybrids 4266, 
^f, pure oft's])ring 5500, hybrids 4050, 
'ui7 pure offspring 5555, hybrids 3556, 
-,%, pure offspring 6000, hybrids 8200. 

There can therefore be no doubt that under such conditions the aver- 
age pre-potential segregation and segregate fecundity of the next gen- 
eration win be considerably advanced, and so with each successive 
generation till the average of the pure forms is represented by the 
fraction -^2, and is surrounded by a circle of variations, of which one 
will be represented by the fraction -f-,r. And from this new point con- 
tinuous advance will be made toward ever higher and higher grades 
of segregation and segregate fecundity; though of course the process 
will be subject to antagonisms and limitations arising from the princi- 
ples of self-accumulating vigor and self-accunuilating adaptation. Let 
it however be carefully noted that we have in this process the mani- 
festation of a new princi])le, for it rests not only on self-accumulating 
positive segregation, but on self-accunndating segregate fecundity.

Fecundity of cross unions and of Hybrids is p'17 that of Pure-breeds, while their 
Vigor is equal. 

THK INFLUKNCE OF SKGKKtiATE VIGOR. 

I tliiuk we may say we have liere come in sight of one form of the 
still wider fourfold law already mentioned; for on the same principle 
that segregate fecundity increases when once allied with iiartial segre- 
gation in vigorous forms, segregate vigor must also tend to increase 
when brought into the same alliance; and I believe it will be found 
that there is a similar princijile tending to the self-accumulation of 
segregate adaptation. 

At the point where they both arise, that is during the period that 
immediately follows the act of impregnation, it is difHcult to distinguish 
between the two principles, and the mortality of the hybrid embryo 
before birth, or before it leaves the eg(^, may be conveniently classed 
as segregate fecundity.* 

Tliough the two principles are so closely related, it would be a great 
mistake not to distinguish them; for there is no close correspondence 
between the degrees in which the two qualities occur in the relations 
of individuals or varieties ; and some cases we find segregate fecundity 
associated with integrate vigor. The mule, though absolutely sterile, 
possesses vigor equal, if not superior, to that of either parent. In the 
record of experiments given by Darwin in "Cross and Self Fertilization 
in the Vegetable Kingdom" mention is made of certain species in which 
self- fertilized flowers are more fertile than the cross-fertilized, while the 
plants produced from the cross seed are the more vigorous; and of 
other species in which cross-fertilized flowers are by far the most pro- 
ductive, while the plants produced from the crossed seed are neither taller 
nor heavier than the self- fertilized.! In the same work the common 
pea {Pisum sativum), the common tobacco [NicoUana tahacum), and 
Canna Warscewiezi are shown to be more vigorous when raised from 
self-fertilized seed than when raised from seed crossed with other indi- 
viduals of the same strain ; but in the case of the tobacco and the pea 
great increase of vigor is produced by a cross with a slightly different 
variety, Avhile the fertility is increased but little if any. 

But the most interesting of all his experiments as bearing on the sub- 
ject of segregate vigor, is given in the history of " The Descendants of 
the self-fertilized Plant, named Hero, ivhieh appeared in the Sixth Self -fer- 
tilized G eneration of Iiwmcea purpurea." " A cross between the children 
of Hero did not give to the grandchildren any advantage over the self- 
fertilized grandchildren raisedfrom the self- fertilized children." " And,

what is iar more reuiaikablc, the ^reat-i^iaiulehihlren, raised l)y cross- 
ing tlu? grandcliildrcii with a fresh stock, had no advantage over either 
the inter-crossed or the self-fertilized great-grandchildren. It thus 
appears that Hero and its descendants differed in constitution in an 
extraordinary manner from ordinary plants of the same si)e<ies." "If 
we look to the (ordinary) plants of the ninth generation in Table x, we 
lind that the inter-crossed plants (of the same st()(;k) were in height to 
the self- fertilized as KM) to 79, and in fertility as 100 to 20; whilst the 
Colchester-crossed plants (raised by crossing with a fresh stock) were in 
height to the intercrossed as 100 to 78, and in fertility as 100 to 51."* 
The Colchester-crossed plants were tlierefore in height to the self-fer- 
tilized as 1 to 0.78 X 0.7U, or as 1000 to 61G, and i.i fertility as 1 to 
0.51 X 0.20, or as 1000 to 133; while the self-fertilized descendants of 
Hero when crossed wath the same fresh stock not only had no advan- 
tage over those that had been continmtusly self- fertilized for nine gen- 
erations, but, as the details of the experiment show, the advantage was 
on the side of the plants raised from the self-fertilized seed. The ex- 
periment was conducted under conditions decidedly unfavorable for the 
])roduction of healthy plants; but as it is usually found that the superi- 
ority of crosses between varieties is most clearly brought to light when 
the comi)etitors are subjected to unfavorable circumstances, it seems to 
furnish even stronger evidence of segregate vigor being occasionally 
produced in the earliest stages of divergent evolution than aaouM have 
been furnished if the same degree of superiority in the self-fertilized 
plants had been obtained under a less severe test. As the case is of 
unusual interest, I give the details as recorded by Darwin : 

"Several flowers on the self- fertilized grandchildren of JT<?;-oin Table 
XVI were fertilized with pollen from the same flower; and the seedlings 
raised from them (great-grandchildren of Hero) fcnnned the nintli self- 
fertilized generation. Several other flowers were crossed with pollen 
from another grandchild, so that they may be considered as the off- 
spring of brotliers and sisters, and the seedlings thus raised may be 
called the inter-crossed great-grandchildren. And lastly other flowers 
were fertilized with pollen from a distinct stock, and the seedlings thus 
raised may be called the Colchester-crossed great-grandchildren. In 
my anxiety to see what the result would be I nnfortunately i)lanted 
the three lots of seeds (after they had germinated on sand) in the hot- 
house in the middle of winter, and in consequence of this the seedlings 
(twenty in number of each kind) became very uidiealthy, some growing 
only a few inches in height, and very few to their proper height. The 
result therefore can not be fully trusted; and it would be useless to 
give the measurements in detail. In order to strike as fair an aver- 
age as i)0ssible I first excluded all the plants under 50 inches in height, 
thus rejecting all the most unhealthy plants. The six self- fertilized 
thus left were on an average C6.86 inches high, t he eight inter-crossed 

* "Cross and Self-Fertiliz:itioii," pp. 47, 60, 61. 



330 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

plants 63.2 bigli, and the seven Colchester-crossed 05.37 high; so that 
there was not ninch difference between the three sets, the self- fertilized 
plants having- a slight advantage. Nor was there any great difference 
when only the plants under 3G inches in height were excluded. Nor 
again when all the plants, however much dwarfed and unhealthy, weie 
included. 

"In this latter case the Colchester-crossed gave the lowest average 
of all ; and if these plants had been in any marked manner superior to 
the other two lots, as from my former experience I fully expected they 
would have been, I can not but think that some vestige of such superi- 
ority would have been evident, nothwithstanding the very unhealthy 
condition of most of the plants. No advantage, as far as we can judge, 
was derived from inter-crossing two of the grandchildren of Hero, any 
more than when two of the children were crossed. It appears, there- 
fore, that Hero and its descendants have varied from the common type, 
not only in acquiring great jiower of growth and increased fertility 
when subjected to self-fertilization, but in not profiting from a cross 
with a distinct stock; and this latter fact, if trustworthy, is a unique 
case, as far as I have observed in all my experiments." * 

Let us now consider for a moment what must be the result when such 
a variation occurs in a wild species subject to the ordinary conditions 
of competition. In the first place, it would gradually prevail over 
other representatives of the same local stock, both by its more vigor- 
ous growth and by its greater fertility, especially in the case of flow- 
ers that failed of securing a cross. And afterwards, when it came into 
competition with the equally adapted variety from which it was par- 
tially protected by segregate vigor, it would neither be driven out 
nor lose its separate existence in a commingled race. It will be 
observed that we have in such a case local, germinal, and floral segre- 
gation, each producing x:)artial effects which are enhanced by the seg- 
regate vigor. In order to bring out the relation of these factors to 
each other, let us assume definite values for each. Let us suppose that 
1% of. the flowers are self-fertilized, -^q- are fertilized with pollen from 
another flower of the same plant, -i\ are fertilized with xiollen from 
other plants of the same new variety, and j-q are fertilized with pollen 
from the older variety occupying contiguous areas. Therefore the sum 
of the segregating influences, which is called the "Eatio of i)ure breed- 
ing," and is represented by K in Table ii, equals -i%; and the "Eatio 
of cross breeding," represented by c in all the tables, equals -^^. Again, 
let us suppose that the fertility of the pure breeds is the same as that 
of the half-breeds, but that the superior vigor of the former is such that 
any one of the pure seeds has twice as good a chance of germinating, 
growing to maturity, and producing seeds as any one of the crossed 
seeds. The general effect on the final result will in that case be the 
same as if the "Eatio of increase for the pure unions" (which I call M)

equalled 10, while the "Ilatio of increase for the cross unions" (which I 
call m) Ciiualed 5. Turning now to Table v, we can easily find the 
ratio in which the number of pure-breeds will stand to the half-breeds, 
if the conditions continue long; for in the column in which m eijuals 5

My attention has recently been called to the following facts relating 
to the Japanese and Aino races, who have for many centuries met un- 
der circumstances favoral)le for interfusion without any apparent effect 
of this kind. I quote from ''Memoirs of the Literature College, Im- 
perial University of Japan," No. 1: ''The Language, Mythology, and 
Geographical Xomenchiture of Japan viewed in the Light of Aino 
Studies," by Basil Hall Chamberlain, p. 43 : 

"With what logic, it nmy be urged, do you invite us to accept a 
great extension of the Aino race in early Japan, when it is a x^hysiolog- 
ical fact, vouched for by so high an authority as Dr. Baelz, that there 
is little or no trace of Aino blood in the Japanese people? In rejjly to 
this some would perhaps quote such examples as New England, whence 
the Indians have vanished, leaving nought behind them but their place- 
names. In Jai)an, however, the circumstances are different from those 
of New England, There has undoubtedly been constant inter-marriage 
between the conquerors and the native race \\\ion the Aino border. We 
can infer this from history. Those who have traveled in Yezo know it 
by personal experience to-day. Nevertheless, these inter-marriages 
may well consist with the absence of any trace of Aino blood in the 
population. As a matter of fact, the northern Japanese, in whose 
veins there should be most Aino blood, are no whit hairier than their 
compatriots in central and southern Japan. Anyone may convince 
himself of this by looking at the coolies (almost all Nambu or Tsugaru 
men) working in the Hakodate streets during the summer months, 
when little clothing is worn. Ihit the paradox is only on the surface. 
The fact is that the half castes die out — a fate which seems, in nmuy 
quarters of the world, to follow the miscegenation of races of widely 
divergent i)hysique. Tliat this is the true explanation of the phenom- 
enon was suggested to the present writer's mind by a ccmsideration ot 
the general absence of children in the half-bred Aino families of his ac- 
quaintance. Thus, of four brothers in a certain village where he staid, 
three ha\ e died leaving widows without male children and with only 
one or two little girls between the three. The fourth has children of 
both sexes; but they suffer from affections of the chest and from rheu- 
matism. ^Ir. Batchelor, whose opportunities for observati(m have been 
unusually great, concurs in considering this explanation as sufficient 
as it is simple. There are scores of mixed marriages every year. There 



332 DIVERGENT EVOLUTION TIIROItGH SEGREGATION. 

are iiuiiierons lialf-breeds bom of these marriages. But the second 
generation is almost barren ; and such children as are born — whether 
it be from two half-bred parents, or from one half-breed parent and a 
member of either pure race, are generally weakly. In the third or 
fourth generation the family dies out. It may be added that the half- 
breeds have a marked tendency to baldness, and that their bodies are 
much less hairy than those of the genuine Ainos. This fact has doubt- 
less helloed to cause the divergence of opinion with regard to Aino 
hairiness. For the comparatively smooth half-breeds usually speak 
Aino, dress Aino fashion, and are accounted to be Ainos, so that travel- 
lers are likely to be misled, unless constantly on their guard. There 
seem to be half-breeds in all the villages whither Japanese peddlers and 
fishermen have penetrated. There have therefore probably at some 
time or other, been half-breeds in every section of Japan where the two 
races have come in contact." 

If these two races Avere equal in civilization and in natural adapta- 
tion to the environment, or if one race was specially adapted to moun- 
tain life and the other to life by the seashore, it seems i)robable that 
they might i)ermanently occupy adjoining countries without losing any 
of their distinctive characteristics. Broca, after careful collation of all 
the information that could be gathered from the publications of trav- 
ellers and historians, reaches the conclusion "that alliances between the 
Anglo-Saxon race and the Australians and Tasmanians are but little 
prolific; and that the inulattoes sprung from such intercourse are too 
rare to have enabled us to obtain exact particulars as to their viability 
and fecundity."* I have no means of knowing whether later investi- 
gations in Australia and other parts of the world have thrown fuller 
light on the mutual fertility or sterility of the more divergent human 
races, but I am inclined to think that the interest in the subject has de- 
clined since Darwin has shown that such data can never afibrd proof 
that the different races of man are not descended from common an- 
cestry. There are however signs that a renewed interest in the sub- 
ject is being awakened through the realization that it has a direct bear- 
ing on the theory of the origin of species.

As we have already seen, the negative factors! segregate vigor and 
segregate fecundity would tend to produce extinction if not asso- 
ciated with positive forms of segregation. But in the case of or- 
ganisms whose fertilizing elements are disributed by wind and 
water, the qualities that i^roduce these negative forms of segrega- 
tion are usually accompanied by those that produce pre-potential

segregation, wliicL. is in an iin[)ortaiit degree i)Ositive. But even pre- 
potential segregation, when prodnced by mutual incompatibility be- 
tween a few individuals and a numerous parent stock, depends for its 
continuance and development on local, germinal, or floral segregation, 
partially securing the intergeneration of a few that are mutually com- 
patible. On the one hand, impregnational segregation depends on 
some degree of local, germinal, or floral segregation which is a constant 
feature in most species; but, on the other hand, not oidy do these initial 
forms of positive segregation fail of producing any i)ermanent diver- 
gence till associated with impregnational segregation, but the more 
ettective forms of positive segregation, such as industrial, chronal, fer- 
tilizational, sexual, and social segregation, often depend on impregna- 
tional segregation, inasmuch as the divergence of endowments which 
produces these depends on impregnational segregation. Moreover, in 
all such cases, increasing degrees of diversity in the forms of adapta- 
tion, and consequently of diversity in the forms of natural selection, 
must also depend upon these negative factors, which in their turn de- 
pend on the weak, initial forms of postive segregation. 

Divergent evolution always depends on some degree of positive 
segregation, but not always on negative segregation. Under a rigor- 
ous condition of the former (as for example complete geographical 
segregation), considerable divergence may result without any sexual 
incompatibility. Darwin has shown, by careful experiments, that inte- 
grate vigor and fecundity is the relation in which the varieties of one 
species usually stand to each other. This fact does not however prove 
that the more strongly divergent forms, called species, which are pre- 
vented from coalescing by segregate vigor and fecundity, did not 
acquire some degree of this latter character before any jiermanent 
divergence of form was acquired. Their having acquired this segre- 
gating characteristic may be the very reason why their forms are now 
so decidedly different, for without it they would have been swallowed 
up by "the incoming waves of inter-generation. Again, we must remem- 
ber that forms only moderately divergent are habitually classed as dif- 
ferent species if they are separated by segregate vigor and fecundity 
(that is, by some degree of mutual sterility), unless observation shows 
that they are of common descent. These two considerations suffi- 
ciently explain why the varieties of one species are so seldom reported 
as mutually infertile. * Notwithstanding this, the experiments of Gart- 
ner and of Darwin, already referred to at length, seem to show that 
segregate fecundity and vigor may arise between varieties that spring 
from one stock. In view of these cases, we must believe that in the 
formation of some — if not many — species, the decisive event with wliich 
permanent divergence of allied f(n*ms commences is the intervention of 
segregate fecundity or vigor between these forms. Positive segrega- 
tion, in the form of h)cal, germinal, or floral segregation producing only 
transitory divergencies, always exists between the portions of a species 



334 DIVEEGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 

tliat lias many members, but as it does not directly produce the nega- 
tive segregation wliicli is, in such cases, the necessary antecedent of 
permanent divergence, we can not, in accordance with the usage of lan- 
guage, call it the cause of the i^ermanent divergence. Moreover, though 
it may be in accordance with ordinary language to call the negative 
segregation, which is the immediate antecedent of the permanent diver- 
gence, the cause of the same, it will be more correct to call the coin- 
cidence of the negative and positive segregations the cause, and still 
more accurate to say that the whole range of vital activities (when sub- 
jected to the limitations of any sexual incompatibility that corresponds 
in the groups it separates to some previous but ineffectual local, germi- 
nal, or floral segregation) will produce permanent divergence. 

In many cases not only is the entrance of imj)regiiational segrega- 
tion the cause of the commencement of permanent divergence, but its 
continuance is the cause of the continuance of the divergence. The 
clearest illustration of this is found in the case of plants that are fer- 
tilized by pollen that is distributed by the wind. All the higher, as 
well as the lower, groujis of such ])lants would rapidly coalesce if each 
grain of pollen Avas capable of producing fertilization, with equal cer- 
tainty, promptness, and efficiency, on whatever stigma it might fall. 
We may also be sure that, with organisms that depend upon water for 
the distribution of their fertilizing elements, impregnational segrega- 
tion is an essential factor in the development of higher as well as of 
lower taxonomic groups. 

It is important to observe that, in the cases under consideration, the 
inferior fertility or vigor resulting from the crossing of the incompatible 
forms is as truly a cause of divergence as the inferior opportunity for 
crossing which from the first existed between the members occupying 
different localities or between the flowers growing on different trees of 
the same species. The former has been called negative, and the latter 
positive, segregation, not for the sake of distinguishing different grades 
of efficiency, but for the sake of indicating the different iDetht)ds of 
operation in the two classes of segregation. 

/;) Institutional segregation. 

Institutional segregation is the reflexive form of rational segrega- 
tion. It is produced by the rational purposes of man embodied in in- 
stitutions that prevent free inter-generation between the different parts 
of the same race. 

As the principal object of the present x>aper is to call attention to 
the causes of segregation acting independently of effort and contriv- 
ance directed by man to that end, it will be sufficient to enumerate 
some of the more prominent forms under which institutional segrega- 
tion j)resents itself, noting that some of these influences come in as 
supplfeme:ntal to the laws of segregation already discussed, simply re- 



DIVERGENT EVOLUTION THROUGH SEGREGATION. 335 

enforcing' by artificial barriers the segregations that have their original 
basis in nature. The chief forms that should be enumerated are na- 
tional, linguistic, caste, penal, sanitary, and educational segregation; 
and if we had not already coiisi<Iered industrial segregation in the pre- 
vious chapter, that might be add<'d. 

CONCLTTDINa REMARKS. 

Besides artificial and institutional segregation, which deixMid on the 
rational purpose of man, we have now considered numerous forms of 
segregation, resting on no less than 18 groups of purely natural causes. 
Owing to the length of this jjaper I deem it wise to bring it to a close 
without discussing the laws that co-operate in intensifying the effects 
directly produced by the segregative causes already considered. As I 
have shown in Chapter II, segregation is not simply the independent 
generati(m of the ditferent sections of a species, but the independent 
generation of sections that differ; and though no one will believe that 
any two sections of a sx)ecies ai'e ever exactly equivalent, it is evident 
that the degrees of difference may be greater or less, and that what- 
ever causes a greater difference in two sections that are prevented from 
intergenerating will also be a cause of increased segregation. 

It lias been observed that some of the causes enumerated in this and 
the previous chapter are primarily sei^arative, and that no one of those 
that are primarily segregative is at any one time segregative in regard 
to many classes of characters. As several forms of segregation may 
co-operate in securing a given division of a species and one form is 
super-imj)osed upon another the aggregate effect must be incalculably 
great; but we easily perceive that it may be indefinitely enhanced by 
causes ])roducing increased divergence in the segregated branches. 
The causes which produce monotypic evolution when associated with 
inter-generation must be eciually effective in producing polytipic evolu- 
tion when associated with se-generation, whether in its separative or 
segregative forms. But the discussion of intensive segregation must 
be reserved for another occasion. 

Believing that the study of cumulative segregation in its relations to 
the other factors ol" evolution will throw light on the origin of species 
far beyond what I have been able to elicit, I trust the subject will 
secure the attention of those who enjoy better opportunities than I do 
for carrying forward such investigations.

THK STRIK^GLE FOK LIFE IN THE FOREST,* 



By James Kodway. 



Guiana is, above everytliiug else, famous for its varied and rampant 
forms of vefjetable life. It is a country of magnificent timber trees, 
elegant palms, wonderful creeping, climbing, and scrambling vines, 
enormous arums, and stately grasses. All of these seem conscious that 
they have to struggle for existence and that the fittest only will sur- 
vive. Here we have no forest of one species — in which there appears 
to be something like combination, but every plant is an individual, and 
as such strives with all its might to get ahead of its neighbor, no mat- 
ter how. Its whole aim and end is to obtain a share of the bright sun- 
light which is so pleuteously bestowed, but nevertheless is so hard to 
get at. As long as the individual succeeds it does not care what 
becomes of the others; "everyone for himself and the sunlight for him 
wlio outstrips the others'' appears to be their motto. 

Myriads of seeds are distributed in every direction; some are eaten 
by bii'ds, others by quadrupeds and monkeys, while the vast majority 
are washed away by floods or die in the first stage of babyhood. A 
hundred may germinate under one tree, but what poor, puny things they 
arc I They try their best to raise themselves toward the light above their 
heads, but without a share of that light they have no strength. Their 
seed leaves arc almost colorless, while their stems are so fragile that they 
often break off by their own weight. One by one they fall and die, 
II ere and there however, in some place where a few rays of light have 
sncceedcd in penetrating the canopy of foliage, one of them becomes 
strong enough to get over its first ditticulties. Then it uses up all its 
strength to push its way up and up until it arrives at the toj). It does 
not waste its energy by spreading in any way, either in the stem or by 
branching, but straight and thin as a walking stick at last forces its 
way into the sunlight. Now comes a transformation ; like a giant forcing 
his way through a crowd it pushes out a branch in this direction and 
another in that until it succeeds in elbowing itself into a good place. 

Except at night there is no rest in the tropical forest. The struggle 
goes on all through the year, being perhaps only a little less in the dry 
season. No nice winter's sleep is possible, Man and the higher ani-

338 THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE IN THE FOREST. 

mals may take things easy, but not so tlie trees. In the great cities of 
Europe men have to carry on just such a struggle, but plants in tem- 
perate climates jog along quietly ; here the case is reversed. From 
dawn to sunset trees are hard at work — you can almost see some of them 
growing — and as may naturally be supposed, they must have a little 
rest at night. The tree is thoroughly exhausted ; its branches lose their 
stifl'uess, while the leaves droop and fold themselves together. Unhke 
those of temperate climates, the trees of the tropics all, more or less, 
show these signs of exhaustion toward sunset. 

Forest trees have not only to contend with each other, — this is a fair 
tight where if not equally matched they are nearly so, — but the strug- 
gle must be carried on against interlopers of various kinds. Creeping, 
twining, and scrambling vines are determined somehow or other to get 
a share of the sunlight. "There is plenty of room at the the top," but 
they have to get there. Without light they are like the young trees, 
poor, sickly, washed-out things, hardly able to to raise themselves even 
with the aid of the stems of trees or other climbers like themselves. 
Some few do succeed, however, one way or another — one species of Big- 
nonia by means of veritable claws — and when they get to the top, how 
they do revenge themselves on the torest trees w^hich have stood in their 
light. We can fancy one of them saying, "ISTow, I am going to smother 
you." And it does so in many cases. It branches out here, there, and 
everywhere, spreading its leaves upon those of its support, until even- 
tually a wealth of brilliant Howers open out, eclipsing those of the trees 
altogether. As its branches extend the stem swells and hardens until 
it looks like a great hempen cable, which, if it happens to be a twiner, 
constricts its support in serpent-like folds until perhaps the tree is stran- 
gled to death. But this does not matter, for by that time the rampant 
monster has spread itself over a dozen giants of the forest where it 
revels in the sunlight and seems to crow over its victory. 

Perhaps the most insidious enemy against which the forest tree has 
to contend is the class of stranglers such as clusias and figs. Birds 
eat the fruit of these horrible plants, and deposit the seeds in the top- 
most forks of some forest giant, where they germinate. One of these 
succeeds in getting ahead, and, as its leaves open, it extends a number 
of aerial roots dowai the trunk of the tree until they reach the earth. 
There they go, crawling down, and like very long worms, apparently quite 
harmless, clinging to the bark, but seeming otherwise entirely wanting 
in either ability or desire to injure. J^ow the strangler has gained its 
foothig and begins to feel its power. The aerial roots expand laterally 
until they actually run into each other and cover the trunk. We can 
almost fancy the magnificent forest tree protesting strongly, as, octopus- 
like, the clusia begins to compress and strangle it. It may protest as 
much as it likes, but that makes no difference; the clusia grows stronger 
and stronger, until by and by, as the strangler opens its magnificent 
waxy flowers to the sun and glories in its conquest, the poor, unfortu- 



THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE IN THE FOREST. 339 

nate victim droops and dies. Then the trunk becomes diseased, wood 
ants begin their work, and linally nothing- is left but the hollow cylinder 
of the strangler'. 

There is yet another foe to the giant of the forest, the parasite or 
bloodsucker, the leech of the vegetable kingdom. Like the leech, it is 
not very large in comparison with its victim, but that does not matter, 
as it makes up in numbers what it lacks in size. These plants, called 
bird vines {Loranthacece), are, like the stranglers, distributed by birds. 
The seeds are covered with glutinous pulp, which, when they are 
dropped by birds, enables them to adhere to the branches of the trees. 
Here they sprout, and with their young leaves, produce aerial roots, 
covered with suckers, which run along and insinuate themselves into 
the cracks of the bark, continually nourishing themselves on the life- 
blood of their victims. As the loranth extends itself, it seems to revel 
in the mischief it is producing, looking bright and happy in contrast 
with its miserable victim, wliose limbs begin to wither and fall, until 
ultimately the branch becomes dry and brittle, when perhaps some day 
it breaks oif by its own weight and comes to the ground, bringing its 
murderer with it. Sometimes the whole tree will be covered with para- 
sites and ultimately succumb to the continual drain, but more often it 
survives in a most miserable state of weakness, being hardly able to 
produce flowers, much less fruit. Like a man suffering under a chronic 
disease, it drags along its melancholy existence until all its branches 
wither, when the j^arasites, having nothing to live on, suffer a just ret- 
ribution. However, there are always plenty of others to keep up the 
fight, as the species are very numerous, while the seeds germinate by 
thousands. 

Although there is a scarcity of the larger animals in the forest, this 
is conii)ensated by the wealth and variety of the insect world. Ants 
are present in myriads, some of them making sad havoc on the foliage 
and adding to the numerous foes against which the forest giant has to 
contend. Then, there is the great army of wood ants, or termites, 
which are the scavengers. When a tree is elbowed, smothered, strangled, 
or sucked to death, the wood ants are ever in readiness to dispose of 
its remains. However hard the timber may be, it is not too tough for 
these insignificant creatures. To look at, they appear the weakest of 
all insects. Unable to stand even the subdued light of the forest, hav- 
ing to build covered tunnels so as to be always in darkness, they are 
nevertheless able in a comparatively short time to make a fallen trunk 
as fragile as an eggshell. In Avandering through the forest you come 
upon au enormous trunk lying across your path. It is too large to 
step over, so you put your foot upon it, when, with a crunch, crunch, the 
apparently hard timber crumbles like a mummy, while tlie wood ants 
are scattering in every direction to get under cover. In the larval state 
the insect world is also the sworn foe of the tree. The elegant palm 
has its canker at the heart in the shape of the borer beetle. Tliese

princes of the vegetable kingdom are very tender; a single larva will 
kill the strongest ot them. There they stand, like kings deprived of 
their crowns, until the inevitable scavengers come forward and crum- 
ble them into mold. 

In the great struggle for light, which means life in the forest, there 
is noplace for small lierbaceous plants. Such little beauties as daisies 
and primroses could find no sunny banks or fields to bask in. The 
ground is strewn with dead leaves and withered petals, which have 
fallen from the canopy above, and sometimes yon pick up a flower or 
seed and wonder which tree it came from. You look up and try to 
identify the foliage of some particular tree, but they are so intermin- 
gled that this is almost impossible. There is hardly anything to be 
seen in the dense forest save an interminable jumble of trunks and 
bush ropes. However, flowers are not entirely absent. Scattered here 
and there may be found a few leafless root parasites. One orchid, the 
WullscJilcr/cUa apht/lla, is able to exist in the half-light, together with 
three species of Voyria. Except one of the latter, which is like a min- 
iature yellow crocus, these plants are particularly delicate, poor, pale, 
sickly looking creatures, that seem ready to fall to pieces by their own 
weight, although they are only 2 or 3 inches liigli. 

However, lierbaceous j)lants are not wanting in the forest. Let us 
single out a giant Mora, if we can, and use a glass, when we shall see 
that its limbs are covered with small i)lants, which may be recognized 
as orchids and bromelias. Far above our heads are the representatives 
of Shakespeare's "long purples" and the other temj)erate orchids 
which decorate the English meadows. There they sit, lUO to 150 feet 
above our heads, "born to blush unseen," as far as the human eye 
is concerned. Nevertheless they live, and perhaps enjoy life, doing 
their work, and doing it admirably. They do not elbow their neigh- 
bors, nor do they smother, strangle, or suck them, but simply make 
use of the topmost branches of the forest giants as resting places- 
The orchid grasps its support in a loving manner, holding it tightly, 
but not like the parasite, to get fat at its exj)ense. No, the orchid has 
succeeded in making itself almost independent. It is satisfied with a 
little light; so there is no necessity for interfering with its host. Hav- 
ing, as it were, succeeded in getting out of the turmoil of the fight, it 
decorates the brawny limbs of the forest giant with its brilliant flow- 
ers, and invites the bees and butterflies to come to its nuptials. 

Although it apparently takes things very easy, the orchid is by no 
means idle, while its position to-day represents the outcome of genera- 
tions of steady work. Having no connection with the soil, it has to 
gather its food from the air, rain, and dew, and not only to collect, but 
also to store it. Although rains are frequent enough, still there are 
dry seasons, when, under the tropical heat, a plant in such a position 
must wither and die unless some provision were made for these contin- 
gencies. Like the plants of the desert, the orchid stores its food in 



THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE IN THE FOREST. 341 

aiiti('ii);itioii of ii drought, but every family, and almost every species, 
does this in a different manner. Some, like Onvidium Lanceanum, lay 
up their store in thick, leathery leaves, so that they can enjoy plenty of 
sunlight without injury. Others, like the CaUlei/a, have thick leaves 
and swollen stems, which latter is one of the forms of the pseudo bulb, 
and is peculiar to the orchid family. Where the leaves are thin the 
pseudo bulbs are often very large, so that if every leaf should be dried 
up the i)lant still retains its vitality. In some cases the store of food is 
laid uj) in cylindrical leaves, some resembling porcupine's quills, others 
like yard lengths of thick twine; in others, there is a plump, fleshy stem 
which answers the same purpose. A few species have no leaves or 
pseudo bulbs. In such cases their aerial roots perform all the functions 
of both. 

The JiromeUacea', Avild pines as they are called, have chosen an 
entirely different nmnner of storing water against a drought. Fold- 
ing the bases of their leaves together, and tightly overlapping one 
upon another, a cup is formed, which retains a store of water for sev- 
eral weeks. Every leaf being a natural gutter leading to this reser- 
voir, the plant succeeds in gathering a little water with every shower, 
so that it is hardly ever actually dry. Taking advantage of this, a 
species of Ufrimdoria, a strictly aquatic plant, has succeeded in locat- 
ing itself in these little pools, where it Inxuriates far above its swamp- 
dwelling cousins. Kot satisfied with this wonderful contrivance, the 
Bromclia has also developed a i)eculiar texture of leaf, almost as tough 
as horn, but at the same time quite flexible, which enables it to stand 
sucli a strong heat and glare as W'Ould cripx)le the more delicate crchid. 

Leaving the dense forest, in which oidy winged creatures can well 
observe the struggle for life, we come across a river or creek, which, if 
it is wide enough, breaks the continuity, and allows a streak of sun- 
light to ]>enetrate. If, on the contrary, the creek be only a- narrow one, 
the forest trees meet (>\erhead, or we paddle our canoe under their 
trunks and branches, Avhich lean over and almost chot e the passage. 
Where the river is broad the forest slopes down to it, looking at a dis- 
tance as if there Avere a high embankment when actually the shore is 
quite flat lor a long distance behind. Here the struggle for life can be 
fully appreciated, as the vegetation is nearer the eye. All along the 
banks, Avithout a single break, shrubs and low trees are densely packed 
together, each trying to find room for itself at the expense of its neigh- 
bor. They take up CA^ery inch of available space, extending their 
branches as far as i)ossible over the stream, Avhile the creeping and 
scrambling Aines take adA^antage of this to spread themseh^es oA^er the 
whole face of the embankment of foliage, festooning it Avith their gay 
flowers and revelling in the tact that they haA'e succeeded in "coming 
over " their supporters. Sometimes retribution overtakes them, as they 
make the shrub or tree so top-heavy that, when a flood comes, the 
roots are loosened and the swift current tears away the Avhole mass, 



342 THE STKUGGLE FOR LIFE IN THE FOREST. 

leaving the remains of the lately crowing sniotlierer bruised, torn, and 
bleeding. 

The elbowing which goes on here differs from that in the " high 
woods " in the fact that, the struggle being so much the greater, the 
army of combatants has put on armor. There are no weak, soft crea- 
tures here. Almost as soon as the seedlings grow they assume their 
weapons. Cover a man from head to foot with needles all pointing out- 
ward, and set him to elbow himself through a crowd, and you have 
something like what is actually the fact with a genus of comparatively 
low palms (Brtcfm). The stems are densely clothed with needle-like 
spines, while the ribs of the fronds have the same aggressive spikes, 
all seeming to say defiantly ^' Woli me tmujere ! " Not content with a 
single stem, these palms grow in clumps, every new sucker taking its 
place beyond the others and pushing its weaker neighbors farther out 
of the way. Most of the low shrubs have stiff and rigid branches, 
which of themselves form a protection, but not content with this, they 
often have short, stiff thorns, ready to tear both the leaves and stems 
of any young plant which tries to forceits way through them. Having 
to contend against such strong opponents, the climbers put on their 
armor as well. The Desmoncus covers its stem Math spines, and insinu- 
ates its young fronds through some little gap toward the light. Step 
by step it ascends, the fronds opening one by one, each provided with 
a most formidable arrow-head having a dozen pairs of barbs, which 
effectually hold up the weak trailing stem. These barbs are most dan- 
gerous weapons of offense to boatmen coming swiftly down the streams, 
as they hang over as if fishing for anything that comes in their way. 

Beyond the line of bushes, and actually in the water, grows the tree- 
like Mocca-Mocca {Montrichardia arhorescens), a curious species of aroid 
which has succeeded in developing itself to a Avonderful size. In its 
young state it is provided with spines, so as to be able to push its way, 
but as it grows upward these are no longer necessary, and are there- 
fore not found on the upper part of the stem. When the water is shal- 
low they form an impenetrable phalanx of several yards deep all along 
the shore, their stems being often 20 feet high and packed as closely 
together as possible. 

It might be supposed that the grasses other than bamboos would be 
entirely absent from the forest region, but such is not the case. One 
species, Fanicnm elephantipes^ has succeeded in getting over the diffi- 
culties by taking its place as a water plant. l>eing provided with large 
creeping hollow stems, it anchors itself to the branch of some tree 
that meets the water, and from this point extends outward and along 
the shore. Growing very quickly, it often covers the surface for some 
distance from the line of mocca-moccas, and might prove a formidable 
obstruction, did not the river vswell at intervals and carry oft large 
masses, like floating islands, down to the sea. 

Beyond the fringe of rampant vegetation nothing can be seen from 



THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE IN THE FOREST. 343 

the river, but by pushing aside the branches and creepers, so as to get 
behind the veil, orchids may be seen growing luxuriantly in great uum- 
bers. Here live those species that delight in plenty of moisture, and 
that can not endure the drier atmosphere which is met with in the " high 
woods." This is the home of Zi/fjopetalon rostratnmy which is enabled 
to flourish and produce its beautiful white flowers in more gloomy 
recesses than most of the others. It has developed a creeping habit, 
by which it seems to derive benetit, being able by this means to grow 
upward on a branch as the tree extends itself. When this species is 
plentiful it forms quite a pretty decoration to the rugged branches. 

The i)laces where orchids are seen to advantage are not however on 
the banks of the great rivers, but rather on those that are wide enough 
to allow a moderate quantity of light to i)enetrate. Not having suflicient 
sun-light to produce rampant vegetation, such places are very congenial 
to a great number of species. High above the water rise the giant moras 
and other immense timber trees, while here and there a great trunk leans 
across the creek, its upper surface decorated with creeping ferns, pep- 
eromias, and the smaller species of orchids, such as Pleurothallis and 
Dichcca. In some of the larger forks grow immense masses of Oncidium 
altissimum, often 3 or 4 feet across, their elegant flower stems being 
10 or 12 feet high, hanging or curving gracefully over and loaded with 
hundreds of lu'ctty yellow flowers. Brassias are also very connnon, 
while here and there Staiihopea eburnea perfumes the air with its large 
ivory-white pendulous blossoms. As the creek twists and turns about 
a new vista is opened at intervals, every short reach, from the diff'ereut 
degree of light, showing some diversity in its forms of vegetation. Now, 
as the creek narrows, the canoe is paddled through a gloomy cavern 
almost as dark as night, from which the exit appears at a distance like 
the termination of a tunnel. Then comes a wide bay where the sun 
shines in all its brilliancy. Here a mass of vegetation chokes the pas- 
sage, and the cutlass has to be used freely, while a. little farther a for- 
est tree has fallen right across the stream, giving perhaps an hour's 
work with the ax before the canoe can be pushed through, hauled over, 
or drawn under. 

On leaning trunks or projecting branches the catasetums are gener- 
ally plentiful. There are several species, which live under entirely 
diflerent conditions, and taken altogether, this genus is perhaps the 
best example of adaptation to circumstances in the orchid family. On 
the borders of the swamps, where only the eta palm will grow, Catase- 
iiim loiu/i/olinm flnds a congenial home among its lower fronds. There 
the orchid hangs downward and waves its long grass-like leaves in the 
wnid. Lkitasetum discolor, as a contrast, has come down to the ground, 
and on the sand reef, where the forest trees find it hard to live, this 
species revels in the poorest soil. Being provided with large psendo 
bulbs, the Catasetam endures the change ol" seasons without injury. 
Although its leaves are generally thin and are liable to be dried up 



344 THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE IN THE FOREST. 

during- a drought, tliis does not iajure it, as the reservoir of food enables 
it to wait patiently and even flower under such conditions as might be 
fatal to many other orchids. As if this were not enough, several 
species have developed a faculty which is almost unique in plants, 
although well known in the case of bees, that of producing male or 
female according to circumstances. In the case of Gatasetum tridenta- 
tu))t there are three distinct shapes of flowers, which differ so much from 
each other that, until Schomburgk found them growing on the same 
plant, they were described not only as separate species, but even difler- 
eut genera. The male was known as Myanthusharbatus, the female as 
Monachauthus viridis, while the third form, which appears to be her- 
mapliroditC; went by what is now the name of the species, Gatasetum 
tridentatum. When this plant has jilenty of food it produces a spike 
of female or hermaphrodite flowers, which are thick and fleshy, resem- 
bling in shape an old-fashioned woman's cap or sunbonnet. These 
flowers and their attendant capsules require a special effort, and can 
only be satisfactorily produced when the plant is in good condition. 
During a drought, when the plant is half starved, it would be unable 
to support such a strain, therefore a few lighter and more elegant male 
flowers are produced, and as there will always be some stronger plants 
to produce those of the opposite sex the work of the weaker is not lost. 
If one passes under one of these plants when in flower, a swarm of 
yellow and black bumblebees {Eulema dimidiata) are seen hovering in 
its neighborhood and flying from flower to flower. Except in this 
locality not a single bee is to be seen, and perhaps a collector might 
search for miles without finding a specimen. But when the Gatasetum 
opens, whether it is hidden in the fork of a tree, perched far up among 
the foliage of the eta, or on sand thrown up from a charcoal pit, the in- 
sect is sure to find it out. The flowers are not generally brilliant or 
showy, neither have they, like the Stanhopeas, any strong perfumes, 
but nevertheless the bees discover them at once. Even in George- 
town, where many orchids do not find their fertilizing agents, and con- 
sequently remain barren, no sooner does the spike of flowers open than 
the bees swarm round it. However it may be obstructed by foliage or 
hidden in some out-of-the-way corner, the buzzing is heard in the early 
morning, telling anyone who has his eyes open that a Gatasetum is 
flowering. Having succeeded in attracting the bee from a distance in 
some unaccountable way, a feast is provided in the shape of a little 
reservoir of nectar, to procure a sip of which the bee has to bring its 
head in contact with a pair of incurved antenna, one of which is very 
sensitive. Immediately on touching this the cover of the little case 
containing the pollen masses flies off, and, like a skip jack, these spring 
out, when, by means of a sticky disk with which they are provided, 
they adhere to the back of the insect and are carried to another flower. 
Here the pollen masses come in contact with the stigma and the flower 
is fertilized. 



THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE IN THE FOREST. 345 

IIaiif?iii^ t'vom a creeper or branch may be seen here and there an 
oval, l)ag-like mass of aerial roots, something- like one of the nests of the 
troupials so common on the silk cotton tree, above which are the 
pseudo bulbs and leaves of that wonderful orchid, the Coryanthes. 
After throwing out two or three roots to attach itself to its support, it 
develops an interlacing network all round, in a way almost peculiar to 
the genus. At lirst sight it would be hard to say what purpose could 
be served by such a contrivance, but strike or shake the plant and it 
will be seen that it is nothing less than a veritable ant's nest. The 
orchid is, like other plants, subject to tlie attacks of many foes such 
as cockroaches and larvte, which are particularly fond of the aerial roots. 
To protect itself against these, the Coryanthes has chosen to provide 
a comfortable nest, wherein a garrison of carnivorous ants find shelter, 
they, ill return tor the accommodation, being ready to come out and 
tight at the first alarm of an enemy. Other orchids which live in the 
tree tops are not so subject to crawling insects as those nearer the 
ground, and for that reason it appears that they have never seen the 
necessity for this special protection. Ejndendron {Diacrium) hicornn- 
tum has obviously felt this need, and set to work in its own way to 
accommodate a garrison. Being provided with long, cylindrical pseudo- 
bulbs, it has left th ese hollow, and for a doorwaj'^, allowed the shell to 
split for about a quarter of an inch at the base. In these well-pro- 
tected homes the ants live and thrive, and in return for their lodging, 
like those of the Coryanthes, are a standing terror to evil doers. Other 
orchids, such as Gotigora, provide a half-shelter for ants, but their 
efforts in that way are of little importance as compared with Cory- 
anthes and Diacrium. 

Having provided a guard against crawling vermin, the Coryanthes 
proceeds to develop a most wonderful flower, in which every jjart is 
obviously formed to attract a particular insect. The majority of insect- 
fertilized flowers are grateful for the visits of either bees, butterflies, or 
flies, but not so the Coryanthes. It has laid itself out only to catch 
and utilize, without hurting it, a beautiful metallic green bee {Euglossa 
aurata). From the base of one of its pseudo bulbs, a long flower stem 
is produced, which pushes itself straight downwards. Upon this it 
hangs a number of beautiful cups, into each of which a liquid drips 
from two horn like processes in the upper part of the flower. Take a 
china teacup with a spreading mouth, hang some little flags over the 
handle, and stick a model of the figurehead of a Polynesian canoe oppo- 
site, and you have something like one of them, as it o]iens itself in the 
early morning from a bud resembling the swathing of a Chinese hidy's 
foot. The species vary in color and markings, being generally whitish 
or yellow, blotched and spotted with crimson. Their odor, as judged 
by our standard, is not pleasant, but nevertheless it is very attractive 
to the bees, which immediately on their opening swarm round in great 
numbers. Flying toward the flower, as a moth to a candle, the bee falls 



346 THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE IN THE FOREST. 

into tlie liquid wliich covers the bottom, and wetting its wings, is un- 
able to use them. Look into the cup and you will see a dozeu bees 
swimming round and round, or vainly trying to climb the slippery sides, 
and if it is the second day after opening, one or two may be seen 
drowned. It was never the intention of the flower, however, that their 
lives should be sacrificed, but on the contrary, that they should escape, 
and in doing so perform the oflice for which the whole contrivance has 
been arranged. Under the flags, where the column comes near but 
does not actually touch the cup, is a narrow opening, through which 
the bee can push its way out. In doing this it has to use sufficient force 
to widen the gap, which opens like a spring door, when it comes in con- 
tact with the pollen case, ruptures it, and carries off the male organ on 
its back. Not being able to fly, there is nothing to be done but to 
crawl over the floAver spike, where, heedless of its former trouble, it 
soon finds itself inside another flower. In making its way out, the pol- 
len masses are rubbed on the stigma, and the ovary fertilized, after 
which it may carry out tne pollen masses of this flower in turn to fertil- 
ize another. - - - 

Another side of the struggle for life is exemplified on the sand reefs. 
Extending for miles, large expanses of white ridges vary the monot- 
ony of dense forest and stream. Here and there, between clumps of 
low bushes, the open sjiace glares with reflected light and heat, while 
the sand itself is so hot that the barefooted Indian is obhged to peel 
two pieces of bark to protect the soles of his feet against it. Without 
such an excessive rainfall as that of Guiana, these reefs would be quite 
barren, but under the circumstances, the hardier shrubs and a few 
trees manage to exist. Where forest trees have succeeded in obtaining 
a footing they push their roots far down below the surface, where the 
sand is moist and cool, but finding little food, they naturally grow 
much slower and are more hardy than the same species in the dense 
forest. For this reason timber from such places is always highly val- 
ued, as being free from sap. Here it is no longer a fight with each 
other, but a hard struggle for bare existence. Everything is arid and 
dry, the shrubs being strong and sturdy, though small, while the few 
herbaceous plants have leaves especially fitted to their surroundings. 
Try to dig up one of these and you may scrape away for many feet 
before you get beyond the tap root. Here, in contrast with the " high 
wood," annuals are seen during the rainy season. Not having been 
able to develop any other special provision, they flower and die, leav- 
ing their seeds to germinate after the drought is over. Orchids abound 
everywhere upon the low shrubs, while several genera have succeeded 
in accommodating themselves to the sand itself. Here is a Cyrtopo- 
dium with a magnificent panicle of yellow flowers, but whatafinei)seu- 
do bulb is this! Three to four feet long, and thick and fleshy, it con- 
tains a store of food against all contingencies. Unlike its relations of 



THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE IN THE FOREST. 347 

the tree tops, it revels in the glare, only partially screening itself beside 
the bushes. 

There is a certain amount of uniformity in the '• high woods," not- 
withstanding that two trees of the same species are hardly ever seen 
together. The conditions being the same, and there being no room for 
developing many s})ecial peculiarities, the result to an ordinary trav- 
eller is ratlier monotonous. The sand reefs, on the contrary, show a 
fertility of invention. Here, some kinds of plants entirely alter their 
character with their habitat. A fern (Schiscea), instead of showing 
the delicacy of form and texture common to the order, has changed 
itself into a wiry grass-like creature, without beauty or comeliness. 
Lichens and mosses take advantage of the slight screen of the clumps 
of bushes, and grow on the sand as well as on the branches. Climbers 
run along the sand, while the demon clusias tlourish without strangling 
their neighbors. Plants whose relatives are forest giants dwindle here 
to little dwarf shrubs of a few inches high, with small leaves densely 
covered with hair or down to collect the dew which falls so plenteously 
in the dry seasons. 

Much more could be said on the various aspects of this great struggle. 
Every si)ecies, and even every individual, is worthy of attention. It 
would almost seem as if thousands of species would fall and become 
extinct, and that such has been the case there can be no doubt. Never- 
theless, there are so many i)rovisions against this, that on the other 
hand, we see that such a thing is comparatively rare. Opposed to the 
thousand chances against the individual, nature has provided a thou- 
sand and one in its favor. A tree with a multitude of flowers will pro- 
duce one or two seeds to each, while an orchid, with only a few, often 
numbers its seeds by tens of thousands. Some trees have fruits which 
are food for beasts, birds, and fishes, but with all this there will always 
be a few left to produce others of the same species. 



SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE LIFE OF AQUATIC INSECTS.* 



By I'rof. L. C. Miall. 



We uiulerstaiid insects to be auimals of small size, furnislied with a 
hard skin and six legs, breatliiug by branched air tubes, and commonly 
l)rovided in the adult condition with wings. The animals thus organ- 
ized are pre-eminently a dominant group, as is shown by the vast num- 
ber of the species and individuals, their universal distribution, ami their 
various habitat. 

The insect type, like some fruitful inventions of man — paper or lith- 
ography, for instance — has proved so successful that it has been found 
l»rofitable to adapt it to countless distinct purposes. I propose to con- 
sider one only of its infinitely varied adaptations, viz, its adaptation to 
aquatic life. 

There are insects which run upon the earth, insects which tiy in the 
air, and insects which swim in the water. The same might be said of 
three other classes of animals, the three highest, viz, mammals, birds, 
and reptiles. But insects surpass all other classes of animals in the 
variety of their modes of existence. Owing to their small size and hard 
skin they can burrow into the earth, into the wood of trees, or into the 
bodies of other animals. There are some insects which can live in the 
water, not as the mammal, bird, or reptile does, coming up from time 
to time to breathe, but constantly immersed, like a hsh. This is the 
more remarkable because insects are, as a class, air-breathers. Air 
tubes or tracheje, branching tubes, whose walls are stiffened by spiral 
threads, sui^ply all the tissues of the body with air. That such an ani- 
mal should be hatched in water and live almost the whole of its life 
immersed, a thing which actually happens to many insects, is a matter 
for surprise, and implies many modifications of structure, affecting all 
parts of the body. 

The adaptation of insects to a([uatic conditions seems to have been 
brought about at different times, and for a variety of distinct purposes. 
Many dipterous larvie burrow in the earth. Some of these frequent 
the dam]) earth in the neighborhood of streams. Others are found in 
earth so soaked with water that it might almost be called mud, though 



* Eveuiiij; discourse, delivered before the British Association, Cardiff, 1891.

350 SOME DIP^FICULTIES IN THE LIFE OF AQUATIC INSECTS. 

tbey breathe by occasionally taking in atmo.splieric air. In yet more 
specialized members of the same order we find that the larva inhabits 
the mud at the bottom of the stream, and depends for its respiration 
entirely upon oxygen dissolved in the water. The motive is usually 
that the larva may get access to the decaying vegetable matter found 
in slow streams, but some of these larv?e have carniverous propensi- 
ties. 

Other insects merely dive into the water, coming up from time to 
time to breathe, or skate upon the surface. 

Nearly every order of insects contains aquatic forms, and the total 
number of such forms is very large. I believe that all are modifications 
of teirestrial types, and it is probable that members of different tami- 
lies have often betaken themselves to the water independently of one 
another. 

The difficulties which aquatic insects have to encounter begin v»ith 
the egg. It is in most cases convenient that the egg should be laid in 
water, though this is not indispensable, and the winged, air-breathing 
fly is as a rule ill fitted for entering water. Some insect eggs hatch if 
they are merely scattered, like grains of sand, over the bottom of a 
stream, but others must be laid at the surface of the water, where they 
can gain a sufficient supply of oxygen. If the water is stagnant it will 
suffice if the eggs are buoyant, like those which comi)Ose the egg raft 
of the gnat, but this i^lan would hardly answer in running streams, 
which would carry light, floating eggs to great distances, or even SAveep 
them out to sea. Moreover, floating eggs are exposed to the attacks 
of hungry creatures of various kinds, such as birds or predatory insect 
larvw. These difficulties have been met in the cases of a number of 
insects by laying the eggs in chains or strings, and mooring them at 
the surface of the water. Tlie eggs are invested by a gelatinous envel- 
oi)e, which swells out the moment it reaches the water into an abun- 
dant, transparent mucilage. This mucilage answers more than one 
purpose. In tlie first place it makes the eggs so slipi^ery that birds or 
insects can not grasp them. It also spaces the eggs, and enables each 
to get its fair share of air and sunlight. The gelatinous substance 
appears to possess some antiseptic property, which prevents water 
moles from attackiiig the eggs; for, long after the eggs have hatched 
out, the transparent envelope remains unchanged. The eggs of the 
frog, which are laid in the stagnant water of ditches or ponds, float free 
at the surface, and do not require to be moored. The eggs of many 
snails are laid in the form of an adhesive band, which holds firmly to 
the stem or leaf of an aquatic plant. Some insects, too, lay their eggs 
in the form of an adhesive band. In other cases the egg chain is moored 
to the bank by a slender cord. 

The common two-winged fly, Chironomus, lays its eggs in trans- 
parent cylindrical ropes, which float on the surface of the water. 
During the summer months these egg ropes, which are nearly an 



SOME DIFFICULTIES IX THE LIFE OF AQUATIC INSECTS. 351 

inch ill length, may readily be found on the edges of a stone fountain 
in a garden, or in a water trough by the side of the road. The 
eggs are arranged upon the outside of the rope in loops, which bend to 
right and left alternately, forming sinuous lines upon the surface. 
Each e}xg; rope is moored to the bank by a thread, which passes through 
the middle of the rope in a series of loops, and then returns in as many 
reverstnl and overlapping loops, so as to give the appearance of a lock 
stitch. The thread is so tough that it can be drawn out straight with 
a needle without breaking. If the egg rope is dipped into boiling 
water the threads become apparent, but in the natural state they are 
invisible, owing to their transparency. The mucilage is held together 
by the threads inter-woven with the mucilage. The loops can be 
straightened without injury until the length of the rope is almost 
doubled. If stretched beyond this point the threads become strained 
and do not recover their original shape when released. By means of 
these threads, firmly inter- woven with the mucilage of the egg rope, the 
whole mass of many hundreds of eggs is firmly moored, yet so moored 
that it floats without strain, and rises or falls with the stream. The 
eggs get all the sun and air which they require, and neither iiredatory 
inse(;ts, nor birds, nor water molds, nor rushing currents of water, 
can injure them. 

The eggs of the caddis-lly are laid in larger ropes, which, in some 
species, are very beautiful objects, owing to the grass-green color of 
tlic eggs. The egg raft of the gnat, which has often been described, 
is well suited to flotation in stagnant water, and is freely exposed to 
the air, a point of unusual importance in the case of an insect which in 
all stages of growth seems to need the most efScient means of respira- 
tion, and whose eggs are usually laid in water of very doubtful ]mrity. 
The lower or submerged end of each egg opens by a lid, and through 
this opening the larva at length escapes. 

The eggs of water-haunting insects are in many ways particularly 
well suited for the study of development. The eggs of Chironoraus, 
lor instance, can always be procured during the summer months. They 
are so transparent as to admit of examination under high powers of 
the mii'roscope as living objects, and as they require no sort of prep- 
aration, they may be replaced in the water after each examination to 
continue their development. This saves all trouble in determining 
the succession of the diflerent stages, a point Avhich usually presents 
difficulties to the embryologist. The whole develoi»ment of tbe egg of 
Chironomus is completed in a few days (three to six, according to tem- 
ix'iature), and it is therefore an easy matter to follow the ])rocess 
throughout with the help of three or four chains of eggs. 

When the larviT3 are hatched and escape into the water, new difficul- 
ties arise. Some hav(^ to seek their food at the surface of the water, 
and must yet l)e always immersed, others live upon fiwd which is only 
to be found in rapid streams, and tliese run serious risk of being swept 



352 SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE LIFE OF AQUATIC INSECTS. 

away by tlie rush of water. All need at least a moderate supply of 
oxygen, wliich has either to be drawn from the air at the surface, or 
extracted from the water by special organs. The difficulty of breathing 
is of course greatly increased when the larva seeks its food at the 
bottom of foul streams, as is the case with certain Diptera. The larva 
of Chironomus, for example, feeds upon vegetable matter, often in a 
state of decay, which is obtained from the mud at the bottom of slow 
streams, and in this umd the larva makes burrows for itself, cementing 
together all sorts of materials by the secretion of its salivary glands 
drawn out into fine silken threads. The burrows in which the larva 
lives furnish an important defense against fishes and other enemies, 
but they still further increase the difficulty of procuring a supply of 
air. Hence, the larva frequently quits its burrow, especially by night, 
and swims towards the suiface. At these times it loops its body to and 
fro with a kind of lashing movement, and is thus enabled to advance 
and rise in the water. From the well-aerated water at the surface of 
the stream it procures a free supply of oxygen, which becomes dis- 
solved in the abundant blood of the larva. Four delicate tubes tilled 
with blood, which are carried upon the last segment of the body, are 
beheved to be especially intended for the taking up of dissolved oxy- 
gen. The tracheal system is ru.dimentary and completely closed, and 
hence gaseous air can not be taken into the body. The dissolved oxy- 
gen, procured with much exertion and some risk, must be stored up 
within the body of the larva, and used with the greatest economy. It 
is apparently for this reason that the larva of Chironomus contains a 
blood red pigment, which is identical with the haemoglobin of verte- 
brate animals. The htemoglobin acts in the Chironomus larva, as it 
does in our own bodies, as oxygen-carrier, readily taking up dis- 
solved oxygen, and parting with it gradually to the tissues of the body. 
It is instructive to notice that only such Chironomus larvae as live 
at the bottom and burrow in the nuid possess the red haemoglobin. 
Those which live at or near the surface have colorless blood, and a 
more complete — though still closed — tracheal system. The larva of the 
carnivorous Tanypus, which is found in the same streams, but does 
not burrow, has a much more complete tracheal system, and only 
enough luemoglobiu to give a pale red tint to the body. The larva of 
the gnat, again, which has a large and open tracheal system, and in all 
stages of growth inhales gaseous air, has no htemoglobin at all. A list 
of the many animals of all kinds which contain h;emoglobin shows that 
for some reason or another each of them requires to use oxygen econom- 
ically. Either the skin is thick, and the respiratory surface limited, or 
they are inclosed in a shell or they burrow in earth or mud. We might 
ex])ect to find that haemoglobin would always be developed in the blood 
of aninmls whose respiration is rendered difficult in any of these ways, 
but any such expectation would prove to be unfounded, and there are 
many animals whose mode of life renders it necessary that oxygen 



SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE LIFE OF AQUATIC INSECTS. 353 

should be stored and economic'ally used, which contain no liaMiio.iilobin 
in their Wood. Hence, while we have a tolerably satisfactory reason 
for the occurrence of haMiioylobin in a number of animals whose resj)!- 
ratory surface is limited, and whose snrroinuling^s make it a matter of 
dilliculty to procure a suHicient supply of oxygen, we haA'e to admit 
that many similar animals under the same conditions manage perfectly 
well without h;pmoglobin. Such admissi(m is not a logical refutation 
of the exi)lanation. I might fairly i»ut forward the baldness of man- 
kind as at least the principal reason for wearing wigs, and this expla- 
nation would not be impaired by any number of cases of bald men w^ho 
do not wear wigs. The i'act is that the respiratory needs (even of 
closely allied animals) ^'ary greatly, and further, there ar«i more ways 
tlian one of acquiring and storing up oxygen in their bodies. 

lOither the storage capacity for oxygen of the Chironomus larva is 
considerable, or it must be used very carefully, for the aninuil can sub- 
sist long without a fresh supply. 1 took a Hask of distilled water, 
boiled it for three-(piarters of an hour, closed it tight with an India- 
rubber bung, and left it to cool. Then six larvii^ were introduced, the 
small space above the water being at the same time filled up Mith car- 
bonic acid. The bung was replaced and the larvtc was watched from 
day to day. Four of tlie larvic survived for foity-eight hours, and one 
till the rifth day. Two of tliem changed to .pupje. Nevertheless, the 
water was from the first exhausted of oxygen, or nearly so. 

The riiirononuis larva is provided with implements suited to its mode 
of life. The head, wliich is extremely small and hard, carries a pair of 
stout jaws, besides a most complicated array of hooks, some fixed, some 
movable. The use of these minute appendages can not always be 
assigned, but some of them are apparently employed to guide the silky 
threads which issue from the salivary glands. Tlie first segment behind 
the head carries a pair of stumpy legs, which are set with many hooks. 
These are maiidy used in progression, and help the larva to hitch itself 
to and fro in its burrow. A similar, but longer pair of hooked feet, is 
found at the end of the body. This hinder pair serves to attach the 
animal to its burrow when it stretches forth in search of food. 

Creeping acpiatic larva', such as Ephydra, possess several pairs of 
legs in f-ontof the last pair, but the burrowing species, such as caddis- 
Avorms, agree with Chironomus, not only in their mode of life, but also 
in the reduction of the abdominal legs to a single pair, which are con- 
spicuously hooked. 

The larval head in this, as in many other aquatic insects, is far 
smaller an<l simpler tlum that of the fly. The larval head is little more 
than an implement for biting and spinning, by no means such a seat 
of intelligence as it is in higlier animals. In Chironomus it contains no 
brain; the eyes are mere s])ecks of ])igment, and the antenna'- are 
insignificant. But the head of the tly incloses the brain, and bears 
eUiborate organs of special sense— many-facetted eyes, and in the male

354 SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE LIFE OF AQUATIC INSECTS. 

beautiful plumed aiiteuuie. This diftVsrence iu size and complexity 
probably explains tlie fact that the head of the fly is not developed 
within the larval head, but in the thorax. It is only at the time of 
l)upatiou that it becomes everted, and its apiiendages assume the posi- 
tion which they are ultimately intended to occupy. 

At length the Chironomus wiggles out of the larval skin, and is 
transformed into a i)upa. It no longer requires to feed, and the mouth 
is completely closed. It is equally unable to burrow, and usually lies 
on the surface of the mud. Two tufts of silvery respiratory filaments 
project from the fore end of the body jnst behind the future head, and 
these wave to and fro iu the water, as the animal alternately flexes and 
extends its body. At the tail end are two flaps, fringed with stout 
bristles, which form a kind of fan. The pupa virtually consists of the 
body of the fly, inclosed within a transparent skin. The organs of the 
fly are already complete externally, and even in microscopic detail they 
very closely resemble those of the perfe(;t auimal. These parts are 
however as yet very imperfectly displayed. The wings and legs are 
folded up along the sides of the body, and are incapable of independent 
movement. For two or three days there is no outward change, except 
that the pupa, which originally had the blood -red color of the larva, 
gradually assumes a darker tint. The tracheal system, which was 
quite rudimentary in the larva, but is now greatly enlarged, becomes 
filled with air, secreted from the water by the help of the resi)iratory 
tufts, and the j)upa floats at the surface. At last the skin of the back 
splits, the fly extricates its limbs and other appendages, pauses for a 
moment uj)on the floating jiupa case, as if to dry its wings, and then 
flies away. 

This fly is a common object on our window-panes, and would be called 
a gnat by most people. It can be easily distinguished from a true gnat 
by its habit of raising th(^ forelegs from the ground when at rest. It 
is entirely harmless, and the mouth parts can neither pierce nor suck. 
Like many other Diptera, the flies of Chironomus associate in swarms, 
which are believed in this case to consist entirely of males. The male 
fly has plumed antenn.e, with dilated basal joints. In the female fly the 
antennae are smaller and simpler, as well as more widely separated. 

In brisk and lively streams another Dipterous larva may often be 
found in great numbers. This is the larva of Simulium, known in the 
winged state as the sand fly. The Simulium larva is much smaller than 
that of Chironomus, and its blood is not tinged with red. The head is 
provided with a pair of ciliary organs, fan-like in shape, consisting of 
mauy longish filaments, and borne upon a sort of stem. The fringed 
filaments are used to sweep the food into the mouth. The larva of 
Simulium subsists entirely upon microscopic plants and animals. 
Among these are great numbers of diatoms, and the stomach is usually 
found half full of the flinty valves of these microscopic plants. The 
Simulium larva seeks its food in rapid currents of water, and a brisk

flow of well-aerated water lias apparently become a necessity to it. If 
the larvie are taken out of a stream and placed in a vessel of clear water, 
they soon become slu^iiish, and in warm weatlier do not survive very 
loiiii. It matters little liowever to the larva? whether the water in 
which they live is ]mre or impure, and streams which are contamiimted 
with sewasic often contain them in great abundance. There are no 
externally visible oruans of respiration, but the skin is supplied by an 
abundant network of fine tracheal branches, which, no doubt, take up 
oxyuen from the well-areated water in which the animal lives. From 
this network at the surface branches pass to supply all the internal 
orjiJins. The Simulium larva is found upon aipuitic weeds, and the 
pair of hindfeet, which in Chironomus were shaped so as to enable the 
larva to hold on to its burrow, here become altered, so as to furnish a 
new means of attachment. The two feet are completely united into 
one. The two clusters of hooks found in the Chironomus larva form 
now a circular coronet, and the center of the inclosed space becomes 
capable of bcinj;- retracted by means of muscles which are inserted into 
it from within. The larva is thus enabled to adhere to the smooth sur- 
face of a leaf, holding- on by its sucker, which is, no doubt, aided by the 
circle of sharp hooks. Eflicient as this adhesive organ undoubtedly 
is, it must be liable to derangement by occasional accidents, as for 
instance if there should be a sudden lush of water of unusual violence, 
or if the larva should be obliged to quit its hold in order to avoid some 
dangerous enemy. In the case of such an accident it is not easy to see 
how it will ever recover its footing. Swept along in a rapid current, 
w«' might suppov.e that there would be but a slender probability of its 
ever tinding itself favorably placed for the application of its sucker 
and hooks. I5ut such emergencies have been carefully provided for. 
The salivary glands, or silk organs, which the Chironomus larva uses 
in weaving the wall of its burrow, furnish to the Simulium larva long- 
mooring threads, by means of which it is anchored to the leaf upon 
which it lives. Even if the larva is dislodged, it is not swept far by 
the stream, and can haul itself in along the mooring thread in the same 
way that a spider or a Geometer larva climbs up the thread by which, 
when alarmed, it descended to the ground. 

AVhcn the time for pupation comes special provision has to be made 
for the peculiar circumstances in Avhich the whole of the aquatic life of 
the Simulium is i)assed. An inactive and exposed pupa, like that of 
Chironomus, may fare well enough on the soft muddy bottom of a slow 
stream, 1)ut such a pupa would be swept away in a moment by the cur- 
rents in which Simulium is most at home. When the time of pupation 
draws near the insect constructs for itself a kind of nest, not unlike in 
shai)e the nest of some swallows. This nest is glued fast to the surface 
of a water- weed. The salivary glands, which furnished the nu)oring 
tlircads, supply the material of which the nest is conqiosed. Sheltered 
within this smooth and tapering case, whose pointed tip is directed up-

stream, while the open mouth is turned down stream, the pupa rests 
securely during the time of its transformation. 

When the pupa case is first formed it is completely closed and egg- 
shaped, but when the insect has cast the larval skin one end of the 
case is knocked off', and the pupa now thrusts the fore x^art of its body 
into the current of water. The respiratory filaments, which i^roject 
immediately behind the future head, just as in Chironomus, draw a suf- 
ficient supply of air from the continually changed water around. The 
rings of the abdomen are furnished with a number of projecting hooks, 
which are able to grasp such objects as fine threads. The interior of 
the cocoon is felted by a number of silken threads, and by means of 
these the pupa gets an additional grip of its case. If it is forcibly dis- 
lodged a number of the silken threads are drawn out from the felted 
lining of the case. The fly emerges into the running water, and I do 
not know how it manages to do so without being entangled in the cur- 
rent of water and swept down stream. The pupa skin splits open just 
as it does in Chironomus, but remains attached to the cocoon. 

The larva of the gnat is perhaps more lamiliar to naturalists of all 
kinds than any other aquatic dipterous insect. The interesting 
description, and above all the admirable engravings of Swammerdam, 
now more than two hundred years old, are familiar to every student of 
nature. 

The larva, when at rest, floats at the surface of stagnant water. Its^ 
head, which is provided with vibratile organs suitable for sweeping- 
minute particles into the mouth, is directed downwards, and when 
examined by a lens in a good light apx)ears to be bordered below by a 
gleaming band. There are no thoracic limbs. The hind limbs, which 
were long and hooked in the burrowing Chironomus larva, and reduced 
to a hook- bearing sucker in Simulium, now disappear altogether. A 
new and peculiar organ is developed from the eighth segment of the 
abdomen. This is a cylindrical respiratory siphon, traversed by two 
large air tubes which are continued along the entire length of the body 
and supply every part with air. The larva ordinarily rests in such a 
position that the tip of the respiratory siplion is flush with the surface 
of the water, and thus suspended, it feeds incessantly, breathing unin- 
terruptedly at the same time. When disturbed it leaves the surface 
by the sculling action of its broad tail. Once below the surface it sinks 
slowly to the bottom by gravity alone, which shows that the body 
is denser than the water. We have therefore to explain how it is 
enabled to float at the surface when at rest. The larva does not will- 
ingly remain below for any length of time. It i-ises by a jerking move- 
ment, striking rai)id blows with its tail, and advancing tail foremost. 
When it reaches the top it hangs as before, head downwards, and 
resumes its feeding operations. 

In order to explain how the larva hangs from the surface against 
gravity, I must trouble you with some account of the properties 



SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE LIFE OF AQUATIC INSECTS, 357 

of the surface film of wuter. You will readily believe tliat 1 liaA^e 
nothing new to communicate on this subject, and I venture to sliow 
you a few very simple experiments, merely because they are essential 
to the comprehension of Avhat takes place in the <inat.* 

In any vessel of pure water, the particles at the surface, though not 
differing in composition from those beneath, are nevertheless in a 
peculiar state. I will not travel so far from the region of natural his- 
tory as to offer any theoretical explanation of this state, but will 
merely show you experimentally that there is a surface film which re 
sists the passage of a solid body from beneath. [Mensbrugghe's float 
shown.] You see (I) that the float is sufficiently buoyant to rise well 
out of the water; (2) that, when forcibly submerged, it rises with ease 
through the water as far as the surface film; (3) that it is detained by 
the surface film, and can not penetrate it. The wire pulls at the sur- 
face film and distorts it, but is unable to free itself. In the same way 
the surface film resists the passage of a solid body which attempts to 
])enetrate it from above. This will be readily seen if we throw a loop 
of aluminium wire upon the surface of water. fP^xperinuMit shown.] 
The loop of wire floats about like a stick of wood. Aluminium is, of 
course, much lighter than iron, but the floating of this little bar does 
not mean that it has a lower densit_y than that of water. If the bar is 
once wetted, it sinks to the bottom and remains there. Even a needle 
may, with a little care, be made to float upon the surface of perfectly 
l)ure water. Still more readily can a piece of metallic gauze be nmde 
to float on Water. [Experiment shown.] Air can pass through the 
meshes with perfect ease; water also can pass through the meshes with 
no visible obstruction. But the surface film, bounding the air and 
Avater, is entirely unable to traverse even meshes of appreciable size. 
These simple experimental results will enable us to appreciate certain 
facts of structure, which would otherwise be hard to understand, and 
which have been wrongly explained by naturalists of the greatest emi- 
nence, to whom the physical discoveries of this century were unknown. 

We may now try to answer three questions about the larva of the 
gnat, viz: 

(1) How is it able to break the surface film when it swims ui)wards'? 

(L*) How is it able to remain at the surface without nuiscular effort, 
tliough denser than water? 

(."i) IIow is it able to leave the surface quickly and easily when 
alarmed? 

The ti]) of the respiratory siphon is provided with three flaps, two 
large and simihir to one another, the third smaller and difierently 
shaped. These flaps can be opened or closed by attached nuiscles. 
When open they form a minute basin, which, though not completely 
closed, does not allow the surface film of water to enter. When closed 



* A immbi'i- of otlii-r expcrimentN. illiistratiiifjf the proi)ertie8 of the surface film of 
water, are tleseribed by I'rof. lioyw in his delightful book on " Soap Hubbies." 



358 SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE LIFE OF AQUATIC INSECTS. 

the air within the siphon is nnable to escape. At the time when the 
hirva rises to the snrface the pointed tips of tlie flaps first meet the 
snrface film and adhere to it. The attached muscles tlien separate the 
flaps, and in a moment the basin is expanded and filled with air. The 
surtaco film is now pulling at the edges of the basin, and the pull is 
more than sufficient to counterbalance the greater density of the body 
of the larva, which accordingly hangs from the surface without eftbrt. 
When the larva is alarmed and wishes to descend the valves close, 
their tips are brought to a point, and the resisting pull of the surface 
film is reduced to an unimportant amount. [Living larvai shown by 
the lantern.] 

Swammerdam found it necessary in explaining the flotation of the 
larva of the gnat to suppose that the extremity of its siphon was sup- 
plied with an oily secretion which repelled the water. No oil gland 
can be discovered here or elsewhere in the body of the larva, and, 
indeed, no oil gland is necessary. The peculiar properties of the sur- 
face film explain all the phenomena. The surface film is unable to 
penetrate the fine spaces between the flaps for precisely the same rea- 
son that it is unable to pass through the meslies in a i)iece of gauze. 

After three or four moults the larva is ready fi)r pupation. By this 
time the organs of the future fly are almost completely formed, and the 
pupa assumes a strange shape, very unlike that of the larva. 

At the head end is a great rounded mass, which incloses the wings 
and legs of the fly, besides the compound eyes, the mouth parts, and 
other organs of the head. At tlie tail end is a ])air of flaps, which form an 
eflflcient swimming fan. The body of the pupa, like that of the larva, 
is abundantly vSupplied with air tubes, and a communication with the 
outer air is still maintained, though in an entirely different way. The 
air tubes no longer open toward the tail as in the larva, but toward 
the head. Just behind the head of the future fly is a pair of trumpets, 
so placed that in a position of rest the margins of the trumpets come 
flush with the surface of the water. Floating in this position the pupa 
remains still so long as it is undisturbed, but if attacked by any of the 
predatory animals which abound in fresh waters it is able to descend by 
the powerful swimming movements of its tail fin. 

Not that the descent is without its difl&culties. The pupa is not like 
the larva, denser than water, but buoyant. There are two respiratory 
tubes in the pupa, whereas there is only one in the larva, and to these 
two tubes the surfiice film clings with a tenacity of which only experi- 
ment can give an adequate idea. Will you allow me to give you a little 
more borrowed physics ? 

If we take a solid body, capable of being wetted by water, and place 
it in water, the surface film will adhere to the solid. If the solid is 
less dense than the water it will float with part of its surfoce out of the 
water. Under such circumstances the surface film will be drawn up- 
wards around the solid, and will therefore pull the solid downwards. 



SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE LIFE OF AQUATIC INSECTS. 35S 

But if the solid is denser than the water, the surface fihn around the 
solid will be pulled downwards, and will pull the solid upwards. Sup- 
pose that a solid of the same density as water floats with part of its 
surface in contact with air, and that weights are gradually added to it. 
The result will be that the surface of the water around the upper edge 
of the solid will become more and more depressed. The sides of the 
depression will take a more vertical position, until at last the upward 
])ull of the film becomes unable to withstand further increase of weight. 
If this i)oint is passed, the solid will sink. Before this point is attained, 
we shall inive the solid, though denser than water, kept at the surface 
by the pull of the surface film. 

This state of things may be illustrated by a model. [Float with glass 
tube attached to its upper surface.] You will readily see that the float 
has to be weighted appreciably in order to break the connection of the 
tube with the surface film. Now the pupa of the gnat has a pair of tubes 
which are in like manner attached to the surface of the water. When it 
requires to descend, the pull of the surface film would undoubtedly be 
considerable. Adding weight to the body is, of course, impossible, and a 
great exertion of muscular force would be wasteful of energy, even if it 
could be put forth. The gnat deals with its difficulty in a neater way 
than this, and saves its muscular power for other occasions. Let me show 
>'ou a method of freeing the float from the surface, which was suggested 
by observation of what was seen in the pupa of the gnat. A thread 
wetted with water is drawn over the mouth of each tube. It cuts the 
connection with the surface, and the float, loaded so as to be denser 
than water, goes down at once. Meinert has described a pencil of hairs 
which appear to perform the same office for the pupa of the gnat. The 
hairs draw a film of water over the open mouth of each respiratory tube, 
and muscular contraction, used moderately and economically, does the 
rest. When the pupa again comes to the surface the tubes are over- 
s])read by a glistening film of water. This is partially withdrawn by a 
movement of the hairs, so that a chink appears by which air can be 
slowly renewed. When the insect is completely tranquil, the hairs 
api)ear to withdraw more completely, and the tube suddenly becomes 
free of all film. The act of opening or closing the film is so rapid — like 
the wink of an eye — that I can not pretend to have observed more than 
the closed tube, the slightly open tube, and then the sudden change to 
a comifletely open condition. [Living pupa^ shown by the lantern.] 

Another l)ii)terous larva, described and admirably figured by Swam- 
merdaiii is the larva of Stratiomys, a larva which, as the structure of 
the fly shows, belongs to an altogether different group from Chirono- 
iinis, Siuuilium, or the gnat. Though oidy remotely connected with the 
gnat in the systems of zoologists, the Stratiomys larva has learned the 
siime lesson, and is equally well fitted to take advantage of the peculiar 
properties of the surface film. Tlie tail end of the Stratiomys larva is 
provided with a beautiful coronet of branclied filaments. When the 



360 SOME DIFFICUl/riES IN THE LIFE OF AQUATIC INSECTS. 

coronet is exteuded it forms a basin open to the air and impervious to 
water, by reason of the fineness of the meshes between the component 
filaments. Were the larva provided with a basin of the same propor- 
tions formed out of continuous membrane, it might float and breathe 
l)erfeetly well, but the old difiiculty would come back, viz, that of 
freeing- itself neatly and quickly Avhen some sudden emergency required 
the animal to leave the surface. As it is, the plumed filaments collapse 
and their points approach; the side branches are folded in, and the 
basin is in a moment reduced to a pear-shaped body, filled with a glob- 
ule of air, and reaching the surfixce of the water only by its pointed 
extremity. Down goes the Stratiomys larva at the first hint of danger, 
swimming through the water with swaying and looping movements, 
somewhat like those of Chironomus. When the danger is past, it 
ceases to struggle and floats again to the surface. The pointed tip of 
its tail fringe pierces the surface film, the filaments separate once more, 
and the floating basin is restored. 

The larva of Stratiomys is extremely elongate. The length of its 
body has evidently some relation to the niode of life of the larva, but 
none at all to that of the fly which is formed within it. The i^upa is so 
much smaller than the larva as to occupy only the fore part of the si^ace 
within the larval skin.* The interval becomes filled with air, and 
during the pupal stage the animal floats at the surface within the 
empty larval skin. 

Stratiomys, both in its larval and i)upal states, floats at the surftice 
of the water. The larva can descend into the water when attacked, 
but the pupa is too buoyant, and too much encumbered by its outer 
case, to execute any such maneuver. Provision has accordingly to be 
made for the protection of the helpless x)upa against its many enemies. 
It is x)robable that hungry insects and birds mistake the shapeless lar- 
val skin, floating passively at the surface, for a dead object. The con- 
siderable space between the outer envelope, or larval skin, and the 
body of the pupa may keep oft" others, for the first bite of a Dytiscus 
or dragon-fly larva would be disappointing. Still further security is 
gained by the texture of the larval skin itself. The cuticle consists of 
two layers. The inner is comparatively soft and laminated, while the 
outer layer is impregnated witli calcareous salts, and extremely hard. 
The needful flexibility is obtained by the sub division of the hard outer 
layer. Seen from the surface, it is broken up into a multitude of hexag- 
onal fields, each of which forms the base of a conical projection, reach- 
ing far into the softer layer beneath. The conical shape of these calca- 
reous nails allows a certain amount of bending of the cuticle, while 
the Avhole exposed surface is protected by an armor, in which even the 
pointed mandibles of a Dytiscus larva can find no effective chink. 

* So singular is the disproportion between the larva and the pupa that some nat- 
uralists have actually described the latter as a parasite (Westwood's "Mod. Classi- 
licatiou of Insects," vol. ii, p. 532). 



SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE LIFE OF AQUATIC INSECTS. BGl 

The liirva and pupa of the Dipterous tly, Pti/choptera paludosa, exhibit 
some iuteresting- achiptatious of the tracheal system to uuusual con- 
ditions. The hirva is found in muddy ditches, where it buries itself 
in the black ooze to a depth of an inch or two. Here, of course, it can 
procure no oxygen, either gaseous or dissolved. When it requires a 
fresh supply, it must reach the surface with part of its body, and to 
enabh' it to do so with the least i)ossible exertion, the tail end of the 
body is made telest-opic, like that of another and still more familiar 
Dipterous larva, Eristalis. The last segments are drawn very fine, and 
are capable of a very great amount of retraction or expansion. No vis- 
ible opening for the admission of air has been discovered, nor do the 
hairs form a floating basin, as in the Stratiomys larva. The larva may 
be often seen lying just beneath the surface, which is broken by the tip 
of the tail. Whether air can be admitted here by some very miimte 
orifice, or whether it is renewed by the exchange of gases through a 
thin membrane, I can not as yet venture to say. In shallow water the 
larva may be occasionally found lying on or in the mud, and stretching 
out its long tail to the surface. In deeper water it often floats at the 
surface. 

Two tracheal trunks run along the whole length of the body, includ- 
ing the slender tail, where they are extremely convoluted and un- 
branched. Toward the middle of the body the trache.e become greatly 
enlarged iu the center of each segment, the intervening portions, from 
which many branches are given off, being comparatively narrow. Each 
tube therefore resembles a row of bladders connected by small necks. 
A cross section shows that the tubes are not cylindrical, but flattened, 
and that, while the lower surface is stiffened by the usual parallel 
thickenings, the upper surf;ice is thrown into two det^p longitudinal 
furrows, so that it is really inflated, becoming circular in section, and 
readily collapses again when the air is expelled. It seems likely that 
the buoyancy of the larva can thus be regulated, and a larger or smaller 
(luantity of air taken in as desired. 

The pupa has a pair of respiratory tubes, which are carried, not on 
the tail, but on the thorax, close behind the head. One of these tubes 
is very long, the other very short. The long tube is twice as long as 
the body and tapers very gradually to its free tip. Here we find a 
curious radiate structure, rather like the teeth of a moss-capsule, which 
seems adapted for oi^ening and closing. There is however no orifice 
which the most careful scrutiny has succeeded in discovering. A deli- 
cate mend)rane extends between the teeth, and prevents any i)assage 
inward or outward of air in mass. The tube incloses a large trachea, 
the continuation of one of the main tracheal trunks. This is stiftened 
by a spiral coil, but at intervals we find the coil deficient, while the 
wall of the tube swells out into a thin bladder. However the tube is 
turned, a number of these bladders come to the surface. As the pupa 
lies on the surface of the mud, the filament floats on the top of the 



362 SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE LIFE OP AQUATIC iNSECTS. 

water, and the air is renewed without effort through the thin-walled 
bladders. 

Why should the position of the respiratory organs be changed from 
the tail end in the larva to the head end in the pupa? Chironomus, 
the gnat, Corethra, and many other aquatic insects exhibit the same 
I)henomena. Evidently there must be some reason why it is more con- 
venient for the larva to take in air by the tail, and for the pupa to take 
in air by the head. Let us consider the case of the larva first. Where 
it floats from the surface, or pushes some part of its body to the sur- 
face, it is plain that the tail must come to the top and bear the respira- 
tory outlet, for the head bears the mouth and mouth organs, and must 
sweep to and fro in all directions, or even bury itself in the mud in 
quest of food. To divide the work of breathing and feeding between 
the opposite ends of the body is of obvious advantage, for the breath- 
ing can be done best at the top of the water, and the feeding at the 
bottom, or at least beneath the surface. Such considerations seem to 
have fixed the respiratory organs at the tail of the larva. Why then 
need this arrangement be reversed when the insect enters the pupal 
stage? There is now no feeding to be done, and it surely does not 
signify how the head Is carried. Why should not the pupa continue 
to breathe like the larva, by its tail, instead of developing a new apj)a- 
ratus at the opposite end of its body, as if for change's sake? Well, 
it does not appear that, so far as the pupa itself is concerned, any good 
reason can be given why the larval arrangement should not continue. 
But a time comes when the fly has to escape from the pupa case. The 
skin splits along the back of the thorax, and here the fly emerges, 
extricating its legs, wings, head, and abdomen from their close-fitting 
envelopes. The mouth parts must be drawn backward out of their 
larval sheaths, the legs upward, and the abdomen forward, so that 
there is only one possible place of escape, viz, by the back of the 
thorax, where all these lines of movement converge. If then the fly 
must escape by the back of the thorax, the back of the thorax must 
float uppermost during at least the latter part of the pupal stage. 
Otherwise tlie fly would emerge into the water instead of into the 
air. Granting that the back of the thorax must float uppermost in 
the pupal condition, it is clear that here the respiratory tubes must 
be set. 

I need hardly speak of the many insects which run and skate on the 
surface of the water in consequence of the peculiar properties of the 
surface film. They are able to do so, first, by reason of their small 
size; secondly, because of the great spread of their legs; and thirdly, 
on account of the fine hairs with whicli their legs are provided. The 
adhesion of the surface film is measured by the length of the line of 
contact, and accordingly the multiplication of points of contact may 
indefinitely increase the support afforded by the surface of the water. 



HOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE LIFE OF AQUATIC INSECTS. 363 

111 the case of very small insects it becomes possible not only to run 
on the surface of the water but even to leap upon it, as upon a table 
This is particularly well seeu in one of the smallest and sim])lest of all 
insects — the little black Podura, which abounds in shectsof still water. 
The minute and hairy body of the Podura isincai)ableof being- wetted, 
and the insect frisks about on the silvery surface of a ]>oud, just as a 
house dy might do on the surface of ([uicksilver. This is all very well 
so long as the Podura is anxicms only to amuse itself, or move from 
l»lace to place, but it has to seek its food in the water, and, indeed, the 
attractiveness of a sheet of water to tlu^ Podura, lies mainly in the 
decaying vegetation far below the surface. But, if the insect is thus 
incapable of sinking below the surface, how does it ever get access to 
its submerged food ' 1 have endeavored to arrive at the explanation 
of this difficulty by observation of Poduras in captivity. If you 
jdace a number of Poduras in a beaker half full of water, they are 
wholly unable to sink. They run about and leap upon the surface, as 
if trying to escape from their prison, but sink they can not. I have 
cliased them about with a small rod until they became excited and 
much alarmed, bnt they were wholly unable to descend. Even when 
large (piantities of alcohol were added to the water the dead bodies of 
tlu' Podura are seen floating at the top, almost as dry as before. It is 
only when they are placed upon the snrlace of strong alcohol that the 
dead bodies become wetted, and after a considerable time are seen to 
sink. How, then, does the Podura ever descend to the depths where its 
food is found? 

I found it an easy matter to make a ladder, l)y which the Poduras 
could leave the upper air. A few i)lants of duck-weed introduced into 
the beaker enabled them at pleasure to pull themselves forcibly through 
the surface film, and climb down the long root hanging into the water 
like a rope. Once below the surface, the Podura, though buoyant, is 
enabled, by muscular exertion, to swim downwards to any depth. 

Other aijuatic insects, not (piite so minute as the Podura, experience 
something of the same diflicnlty. A (lyrinus, or a small Hydrophilus, 
tiiids it no easy matter to quit the surface of the water, and is glad of 
a stem or root to descend by. 

To leave our atjuatic insects for a moment, we may notice the habit 
of creeping on the under side of the surface film, which is so often prac- 
ticed by leeches, snails, cyclas, etc. I find this is often described as 
creeping on the air, and some naturalists of the greatest eminence 
sjjcak of fresh-Avater snails as creeping "on the stratum of air in con- 
tact with the surface of the water."* The body of the animal is, nev- 
ertheless, wholly immersed during this exercise, as may be shown by a 
sim])lc exi)eriinent. If Loco])odium ])owder is sprinkled over the water 
tlie light particles are not displaced by the animal as it travels beneath. 

* Semper's "Animal liife.'' Eug. trans., p. 205. and note 97. 



364 SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE LIFE OP AQUATIC INSECTS. 

The possibility of creepiii,<>- in this manner depends, not upon any 
'■'■ repulsion between the water and the dry snrface of the body," to quote 
an explanation which is often given, but upon the tenacity of the sur- 
face film, which serves as a kind of ceiling to the water chamber below. 
The body of the leech is distinctly of higher si)ecific gravity than the 
water, and falls quickly to the bottom, if the animal loses its hold of 
the surfiice film. The pond snails however actually fioat at the sur- 
face, and if disturbed, or made to retract their foot, they merely turn 
over iu the water. 

What is the result of all the expedients which have enabled air- 
breathing insects to overcome the difficulties of living in water ? They 
have been successful, we might almost say too successful, in gaining 
access to a new and ample store of food. Aquatic plants, minute ani- 
mals, and dead organic matter of all kinds abound in our fresh waters. 
Accordingly the species of aipiatic insects have nniltiplied exceedingly, 
and the number of individuals in a species is sometimes surprisingly 
high. The supply of food thus opened out is not only ample, but in 
many cases very easy to appropriate. Accordingly the head of the 
larva degenerates, becomes small and of simple structure, and may be 
in extreme cases reduced to a mere shell, not inclosing the brain, and 
devoid of eyes, antenna', and jnws. The organs of locomotion also 
commonly afford some indications of degeneration. Where the insect 
has to find a mate, and discover suitable sites for egg-laying, the tiy at 
least must possess some degree of intelligence, keen sense organs, and 
means of rapid locomotion. l)Ut some few aquatic insects, as well as 
some non-aquatic species which have found out an unlimited store of 
food, manage to produce offspring from unfertilized eggs, and to have 
these eggs laid by wingless pupa^. or hatched within the l)odies of wing- 
less larvic. The development of the winged fly, the whole business of 
mating, and even the development of the embryo within the egg, have 
thus, in particular insects, been abbreviated to the point of suppres- 
sion. This is what I mean by saying that the pursuit of a new supi)ly 
of food has in the case of certain aquatic insects proved even too suc- 
cessful. Abundant food, needing no exertion to discover or appropriate 
it, has led in a few instances to the almost complete atrophy of those 
higher organs and functions which alone make life interesting. 



THE (JKOGILVPHIC DISTKIBUTIOK OF LIFE IX :N()RTH 

AMEKICA. 

WITJI SPIX'IAJ. REFERENCE TO THE MAMMALIA.' 



By V. Hart Merriam, M. D. 



Nine years ago tlie Biological Society listened to an a<ldress from its 
distinguished retiring president, Prof. Gill, on "The Principles of 
Zoo geograi)hy," or the science of the geograidiical distribution of ani- 
nials.t Prof. Gill assembled the oceans of the globe as well as the land 
areas into primary divisions or "zoological realms," of which he recog- 
nized nine for the land and five for the sea. Tt is not my puri)ose to 
discuss the zoological regions of the whole world, but to lay before you 
some of the facts concerned in the distribution of terrestrial animals 
and plants in North America with special reference to the inmiber and 
boundaries of the subregions and minor life areas, and to touch upon 
the causes that have operated in their production. 

No phenomenon in the whole realm of nature forced itself earlier 
U])on the notice of man than certain facts of geographic distribution. 
The daily search for foo<l, the first and ])rincipal occupation of savage 
man, directed his attention to the uneciual distribution of animals and 
])Iants. He not only noticed that certain kinds were found in rivers, 
])onds, or the sea, and others on land, and that some terrestrial kinds 
were never seen except in forests, while others were as exclusively 
restricted to open prairies, but he observed further, when his excur- 
sions were extended to more distant localities or from the valleys and 
l)lains to the summits of neighboring mountains, that unfamiliar fruits 
and insects and birds and mammals w<'re met with, while those he 
formerly knew disappeared.

366 GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 

Thus primeval man, and in trntli the ancestors of primeval man, 
learned by observation tUe great fact of geograpbic distribution, tbe 
fact that particular kinds of animals and plants are not uniformly dif- 
fused over the earth, but are restricted to more or less circumscriljed 
areas. 

It will be observed that two classes of cases are here referred to, 
namely, (1) cases in which in the same general region certain species 
are restricted to swamps or lowlands, while others are confined to dense 
forests or rocky hillsides — differences of station, and (2) cases in which, 
regardless of local peculiarities, a general change takes place in the 
fauna and flora in passing from one region to another, or from low val- 
leys or plains to high mountains — (jcographic differences. The latter 
class only is here considered. 

Every intelligent schoolboy knows that elephants, lions, giraffes, and 
chimpanzees inhabit Africa; that orangs and flying lejnurs live in 
Borneo; kangaroos in Australia; the ai)teryx in New Zealand; the 
Eoyal Bengal tiger in India; llamas, chinchillas, and sloths in South 
America; the yak in the high table lands of Thibet, and soon. In 
accordance with these facts naturalists long ago began to divide the 
surface of the globe into zoological and botanical regions irrespective 
of the long-recognized geographic and political divisions.* It was 
found that different degrees of relationship exist between the indige- 
nous animals and plants of different countries, and that as a rule the 
more remote and isolated the region and the earlier in geologic time its 
separation took place, the more distinct were its inhabitants from those 
of other regions. Each of the larger islands lying near the equator 
and the continental masses of the southern hemisphere were found to 
possess not only peculiar species and genera, but even families and 
orders not found elsewhere; and it was discovered that insular areas 
of considerable magnitude that have had no land connection with other 
areas since very early times possess faunas and floras remarkable for 
the antiquity of their dominant types. In Australia, the most discon- 
nected of all the continents, the entire mammalian fauna, though won- 
derfully diversified in appearance and habits, belongs to the primitive 
orders of monotremes and marsupials, whose best known representa- 
tives are the duck-billed platypus and the kangaroo. In the latter 
group Australia and neighboring islands contain no less than six fami- 
lies not found in any other part of the world. 

Madagascar is the exclusive home of the remarkable aye-aye ( Ghi- 
romys) and Gryptoprocta, the latter believed to be intermediate between 
the cats and civets. 

*Amoug the luauy distinguished naturalists who have contributed to the litera- 
ture of the subject may be mentioned Humboldt, Bonpland, Buffon, De Candolle, 
Schouw, Engler, Agassiz, Baird, Asa Gray, Grisebach, Huxley, Gill, Allen, Wallace, 
and Packard. 



GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 367 

Tropical America is aloue in the possessiou of true ant-eaters {Myr- 
mecophaf/idcv), sloths (Bnidi/podulfv), marmosets {Hiqmlidw), armadillos 
{Ddfii/podidfv), and aiioutics {DnHyproctidw). 

Africa is the home of many groups not known elsewhere. Among- 
them are the giraffe, hii)pop<)tamus, Orycteropus, elephant shrews 
{Macroscelididcv), Fotomtxjah', and (-li rysochlorldiv. 

Jjesides this class of cases, in which particular groups are restricted to 
particular countries, there is another class, in which the living represen- 
tatives of single groups exist in isolated colonies in widely separated parts 
of the world. Illustrations of this kind are furnished by the tapirs, which 
inhabit tropical America and the Malay Teninsula, but do not exist in 
intermediate lands: by the family CameUdw, represented in South 
America by tlu^ llamas and in parts of Eurasia by the true camels; 
and by a groui> of insectivorous mammals in which all the genera but 
one are restricted to Madagascar, the one exception {Solenodon) living 
in (Uiba. and Haiti, Examples of this sort are known as cases of dis- 
eontiniums distribution, and indicate that the ancestors of the animals 
in question formerly inhabited avast extent of country; that some 
sort of land connection, however indirect, existed between the colonies 
now so widely separated, and that the surviving descendants of these 
gron])S are probably approaching extinction. 

The examples thus far cited relate to the disconnected land areas in 
the neighborhood of the e(juator or in the southern hemisphere, and 
their explanation is to be sought in the history of the past. In the 
northern hemisphere animals and plants in general have a much more 
extended distribution than in the southern, the majority of the larger 
groups being common to North America, Europe, and Asia, and the 
limits of their distribution are encountered in traveling in a north and 
south direction and are evidently the result of causes now in opera- 
tion. It is to this class of cases as i)resented on the North American 
continent that your attention is invited this evening. 

In passing from the tropics to the Arctic pole on the eastern side of 
America a number of distinct zones are crossed, the nu)st conspicuous 
features of which are well known. In the plant world the palms, man- 
groves, mahogany, mastic, Jamaica dogwood, and cassias of the tropical 
coast districts are succeeded by the magnolias, papaws, sweet gums, 
blackberries, and persimmons of the Southern States. These give place 
gradually to the oaks, chestnuts, and hickories of the Middle States, 
and the latter to the groves of aspen, maple, and beech which reach 
the southern edge of the great coniferous forest of the north, — a forest 
of spruces and firs that stretches completely across the continent from 
Labrabor to Alaska. Beyond this forest is a treeless expanse whose 
distant shores are bathed in the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean. 

Concurrently with these changes in vegetation from the south north- 
ward occur equally marked differences in the mammals, birds, reptiles,

aud insects. Among mammals the tapirs, monkeys, armadillos, nasuas, 
peccaries, and opossums of Central America and Mexico are replaced 
to tlie northward by wood-rats, marmots, cliipmmiks, foxes, rabbits, 
short-tailed field-mice of several genera, shrews, wild-cats, lynxes, short- 
tailed porcupines, elk, moose, reindeer, sables, fishers, wolverines, lem- 
mings, musk oxen, and polar bears. 

The trogous, saw bills, parrots, cotiugas, and other birds of tropical 
America give place in turn to the cardinals, blue grosbeaks, mocking 
birds, tufted tits, and gnat-catchers of the Southern States ; the chewink, 
indigo bird, tanager, bluebird, and robin of the Middle and Northern 
States; the Canada jays, crossbills, white-throated sparrows, and liawk 
owls of the northern coniferous forests, and tlie ptarmigans, snowy owls, 
and snowflakes of the Arctic circles. 

HISTORICAL SYNOPSIS OF FAUNAL AND FLORAL DIVISONS PROPOSED 
FOR NORTH AMERICA. 

The recognition of the above-mentioned facts early led to attempts 
to divide the surtace of the land into fauual and floral regions or zones, 
aud no less than fifty-six authors have proposed such divisions for 
North America. Of these, thirty-one were zoologists and twenty-five 
botanists. Of the zoologists ten aimed to show the distribution of 
animals in general, eight of birds, four of ten-estrial mollusks, three of 
mamnmls, one of reptiles aud batrachians, and four of insects. Of the 
botanists, twenty-two aimed to show the distribution of plants in 
general and three of forest trees. 

Of the writers who attempted to indicate the life areas of the New 
World prior to 1850, 08 per cent were botanists, while during the next 
twenty years (1850-1870), 65 per cent were zoologists. This striking 
oscillation of the biologi(;al pendulum, first toward botany and then 
toward zoology, may be attributed in part at least to the influence of 
two great minds — Humboldt and Agassiz. Humboldt laid the corner- 
stone of the philosophic study of plant geography in 1805. Stimulated 
by his example and writings, botanists led the way and were almost 
the oidy occupants of the field until the middle of the j)resent century, 
when the influence of the elder Agassiz gained the ascendancy and 
the botanists were replaced by zoologists, avIio have been in the lead 
ever since. 

The accompanying table shows tlie various autlnn-s referred to, the 
dates of the earliest publication of their divisions, the branch of biology 
on which their conclusions were based, and states whether or not their 
articles were accompanied by maps.

The principal bio-geographic divisions that have been recognized by 
a large number of writers, and as a rale liave been proposed independ- 
ently and under different names, resulting from the study of difterent 
groups, are described in tlie following synopses, each of which may be 
regarded as a chronologic synonymy of the region to which it refers. 

ARCTIC DIVISION (AHoVK LIMIT OF TREES). 

An Arctic circum-polar division north of tlve limit of tree growth was 
recognized as a distinct region by European writers long before the 
earliest attempts were made to map the faunal and Horal areas of iSTorth 
America.* Hence the following table is necessarily incomplete, since 



* This re}>;ion, however, is not universally recognized. Wallace and a fevr others 
refu.se to accept it. Agassiz, Allen, and most botanical writers, on the other hand, 
regard it as one of the best defined of the primary divisions. .\n important recent 
treatise on the subject, from the standi»()int of the distribution of mammals, is the 
following: " Die arkiisrhc Snhrcgioti — Kin lieitrag zur geof/raphixchni Vcrhrcitiuui der

BOREAL DIVISION. 

This heading is intended to cover the zone of coniferous forests 
extending across the continent south ol' the Arctic realm. While its 
northern boundary is fixed at the limit of trees, its southern border 
has been variously placed by difl'erent writers. Schouw did not recog- 
saizc it at all, but carried his great forest region down to latitude 36°, 
\where the true southern district begins. Berghaus, who in other 
respects followed Schouw, divided this great region into two parts, the 
northernmost of which he named the "Realm of conifers," placing its 
southern limit in the east at about latitude 47°. Hinds, Agassiz, 
Woodward, Verrill, and Drude speak of it as the "Canadian" region. 
Its southern limit is here extended to include the " Canadian fauna" 
of recent zoological writers. 

The extent to which this zone has been recognized will appear frpra

ATLANTIC, CENTRAL, AND PACIFIC DIX'ISIONS OF TEMPERATE NORTH AMERICA. 

It lias been tbe custom of recent writers to divide the broad middle 
zone of North America (most of which lies within the United States) 
into three main divisions — Atlantic or Eastern, stretching from the 
Atlantic Ocean to the eastern border of the plains; Central, from the 
plains to the Sierra Nevada; and Pacific, from the Sierra to the Pacific 
Ocean.* These regions were proposed as early as 1854 by the elder 
Agassiz, who however divided the Eastern or Atlantic district into two 
regions of equal rank — Alleghariian and Louisianian, or faunas of the 
Middle and the Southern States. In this respect he has been followed 
by Cope. Other authors, including Le Conte, Baird, and Allen, regard 
the southern district as only a subdivision of the Eastern region. 
Agassiz named the Central region the "Table-land or Rocky Mountain 
fauna'' and the Pacific the " Californian fauna." 

This arrangement of the United States into three provinces has been 
followed in the main by Le Conte (1859), W. G. Binney (1863), Baird 
(18(i0), Cope (187;5), (rrisebach (1875), Wallace (1876), Allen (1878), 
Packard (1883), Jordan (1883), Hartlaub & Newton (1886), and Ileil- 
prin (1887). 

The three divisions will be considered separately. 

AtlHntic or eastern forest rcyion. — Many writers have recognized an 
i'astern forest region stretching from the plains to the Atlantic and in 
a general way from the boreal or coniferous forests of the north to the 



* These divisions must not be confounded with those of Amos Binney (published 
in 1851) l)eariiig the .same names, for Rinney's Atlantic region lay between the 
Atlantic and the Allcgliauie.s, his Central region between the Alb^ghauies and the 
Rocky Mountains, and the I'acilic region between the Kocky Mouutaius and the 
PaciJic. Woodward's divisicms (185(3) are essentially those of Awos Binney. 



372 GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 



alluvial lauds of the South Atlautic aud Gulf States; but its uortheru 
aud southern limits have been by uo means agreed upon. Schouw 
defined these boundaries as the limit of trees on the north and latitude 
36° on the south, and named the region Miehaux's realm or realm of 
asters and solidagos. Berghaus retained Schouw's southern bound- 
ary, but took off a broad belt on the north, which he named the realm 
of coniferous forests. The resulting northern limit, as shown on his 
map (1838), agrees closely with that a-dopted by such recent writers as 
Wallace (1870), Allen (1878), Packard (1883), and Ileilprin (1887), all 
of whom, on the other hand, carry its southern boundary south to the 
Gulf of Mexico, thus making it coextensive with the Atlantic or East- 
ern province already referred to. 

Several early Avriters, among whom Schouw aud Berghaus were 
prominent, recognized this region in the east, but knew nothing of the 
great interior plans, and consequently spoke of it as extending all the 
way to the Rocky Mountains. 

The extent to which this Eastern forest region has been recognized, 
together with the approximate north and south boundaries assigned it, 
will ai)pear from the following table :

Pacific or California division. — This name has been very generally 
applied to the Pacihc coast region of the United States. It was first 
recognized by the botanist Be Candolle in 1820. Pickering, in 1830, 
named it the Californian flora, but knowing little or nothing of the 
Sierra Nc\ ada, and believing the Ivocky Mountains tobetheonly moun- 
tain system of importance in Xorth America, extended its eastern 
boundary to that range. In this way he was followed by the botanist 
Hinds, in 184.'>; by the conchologists, Amos Binney, in 1851, and Wood- 
ward, in 1850. Agassiz, in 1854, was Jirst to lix its eastern limit at the 
Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountains, where it has been permitted to 
rest. Its north and south boundaries have undergone considerable 
tiuctuations.

AUSTRO-RIPARIAN OR LOITISIAXIAN DIVISION. 

(South Atlantic and Gulf States.) 

Latreille, as early as 1817, called attention to the difference in the 
insect fauna in Carolina and Georgia from that of Pennsylvania and 
New York, and in his division of the earth into circum-polar zones ran 
the boundary line between these fauna at latitude 3Go. The difference 
in the flora of the South Atlantic and (Uilf States from that of the 
Northern States was recognized by the Danish botanist Schouw as 
early as 1822 in the " Realm of Magnolias or Pursh's Kealm," which he 
then proposed for the region between the parallels of 30° and 36° north 
latitude. Thirty-four years later (in 185(5) the northern boundary of 
the same area was run by America's greatest botanist, Dr. Asa Gray, 
along the parallel of 30° 30', only half a degree from Schouw's line. 
The first zoologist to recognize this region was the elder Binney, who 
died in 1847. His posthumous work on " Terrestrial Air-Breathing 
Molhisks," published in 1851, describes it under the name " Tertiary 
Region of the Atlantic Coast and the (xulf of Mexico." The elder 
Agassiz recognized it in 1854 as one of his seven primary regions, nam- 



GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 375 

ing it the Louisiiiuiaii fauna. Later writers, except ('ope, have consid- 
ered it a subdivision of the Eastern forest region. Cope restored it to 
primary rank in 1873 and named it tlie Austro-riparian region.

SONORAN DIVISION. 

The term " Sonoran region" has been applied by Cope and others to 
an important life area which enters the southwestern part of the United 
States from the table-land of Mexico. It was first recognized by a 
botanist, Eichard Brinsley Hinds, R. N., surgeon to H. M. S. Sulphur, 
who ])ublished a description of it in 1843 under the name "The Chi- 
huahua Ilcgion." lie defined it as extending south to the tropic, west 
to the Crulf of California and the Colorado River, north to the prairie 
region of the United States, and separated on the cast from the fkilf 
of Mexico by a northward extension of the Central American region 
:iloiig the h)wlan(ls bordering the coast. Prof. l>air(l (in 18(50) stated 
that along the valleys of the Rio (xiande and Gila the fauna of the 
Central province "is greatly mixed up with the peculiar fauna of north- 
ern ^Icxi<o, which, as far as its summer birds indicate, is almost entitled 
to be considered as a fourth main province."

PENINSULA OF LOWER CALIFORNIA. 

That the fauna and flora of the peninsula of Lower California, or any 
part of it, differs radically from that of the State of California imme- 
diately on the north was pointed out almost simultaneously by Baird 
and Le Conte in 1859. Baird stated that the fauna of its southern 
extremity, as determined by collections of its mammals, birds, and 
reptiles, " is almost identical with that of the Gila River, and to a cer- 
tain extent with that of the Eio Grande," but differs wholly from that 
of Upper Calilbrnia. In accordance with these facts he afterwards (in 
1866) made Lower California a sub-division of the central province. 
Later in the same year (1859) Le Conte stated that a few species of 
insects from Cape St. Lucas, '' though all new, indicate a greater resem- 
blance to the fauna of the Lower Colorado than to that of maritime 
California; this province may therefore be found eventually to belong 
to the interior district." 

Cooper (in 1861) proposed the name Uchitcm for the forest flora of 
Lower California, and regarded it as a sub-division of his Nevadian 
(=Californian) province. Grisebach also, in mapping the plant regions 
of the world in 1866, included the peninsula in his Californian region, 
but afterwards (in 1872) transferred it to the interior or prairie region. 

Cope, in 1873, raised Lower California to primary rank, basing his 
action on a study of its reptiles and batrachians. Wallace, in 1876, 
placed it in the central province without sub-division. Packard, in 
1883, followed Baird and Grisebach in regarding the southern part of 
the peninsula as a sub-division of the central province, while the north- 
ern part was assigned to the Pacific province, Drude, in 1881, divided 
it transversely in two nearly equal plant areas, placing the northern 



GEOGKAPHIC DISTKIHUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 377 

half in bis " ^S^ortli Mexico aud Texas district," and tlie soiitliern lialf 
in his tropical "Mexican District." Ilartlaub and Newton, in 1880, 
placed the entire peninsula in their Mexican region, and Heilprin, in 
1887. in his Sonoran transition region.

writers is shown in the following table:*

SOUTHERN FLOIUl).\. 

The large number of tropical forms of life inhabiting southern Florida 
early led to its separation from the rest of the Atlantic region by writers 
on the distribution of animals and plants. Lesson (in 1831) placed it 
along with Mexico in his south temperate zone. Hinds (in 1813), 
recognizing its AntiUean affinities, placed the stmthern extremity of 
the peninsuhi (stmth of latitude 27°) in his West India region.

ANTILLEAN DIVISION. 

The fauna and flora of the West Indies have been variously inter- 
preted by different writers, some placing the region in South America, 
others in Mexico, and others still raising it to independent rank. 

In 1822, Schouw, in mapping the plant areas of the world,placed it 
in his '-^ Jacquin's realm or realm of cactuses and peppers." Subse- 
quently, however (in 1833), he gave it independent primary rank, 
naming it '^ Swartz's realm." Martins, in 1837, was first to bestow the 
name "Antillean realm" upon this region, which he regarded as a 
division of primary rank, comprising the West Indies and adjacent 
coasts of South and Central America. The same arrangement was 
retained in his lecture on floral realms in 1865.

NORTHWEST COA.ST PIVISIOX. 

In 1843, Hinds, in inaping the plant regions of the world, proposed 
a " northwest American region" for the area west of the Rocky JVIoHii- 
tains, north of the Columbia River, and sontli of latitude 08° north. 
Agassiz, in his paper on the zoological regions of the earth (1854), gave 
the name " Xorthwest Coast Fauna" to essentially the same area 
(shown on his map as extending along the Pacific from northern Cali- 
fornia to the base of the Unalaskan Peninsula). 

In 1850, Le Conte, who based his studies on Coleoptera, si)()ke()f this 
region as the "• Hyperborean province'* of the Pacific district; and tlie 
same year Cooper, writing of the forest regions, described it as the 
'' Caurinc province.'' W. G-. IJinney, in ISTo, mentioned it as the 
"Oregonian dixision'' of the Pacific province; Engler, in 1882, as the 
"Kaloschen zone;" Drude, in 1884, as the "Columbian district;" 
Nelson, in 1887, as the " Sitkan district;" Brendel, in 1887, as the 
"North Pacific province." 



380 GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 



PRAIRIE DIVISION. 



A few botanists, influenced by the widely different aspects of nature 
resulting from the presence or absence of forests, have recognized a 
" Prairie region," as one of the great floral divisions of a:^"orth America. 
It was first proposed by Pickering, in 1830. Pickering named it the 
" Lonisianian flora," and gave its boundaries as the Mississippi on the 
east and the Rocky Mountains on the west. Hinds described it, in 
1843, as " a peculiar tract inclosed by the vast forests of North 
America." He named it the " Prairie region," and said it extended 
"from within a hundred miles of the west bank of the Mississippi to 
the Rocky Mountains, stretching north to 54° north latitude, and again 
only bounded on the south by the wooded country of the Texas and the 
Mexican Sea." 

Cooper, in his paper ou the distribution of forests (in 1859), named 
it the Campestrian province. It was recognized by Brown in 1870, by 
Porter in 1874, and by Engler in 1882. 

RECAPITULATION. 

It is seen that a number of zoologists and botanists, basing their 
studies on widelydifferent groups, and as a rule ignorant of the writings 
of their predecessors, have agreed in the main in the recognition of at 
least seven life areas in extra- tropical North America, namely : (1) An 
Arctic area north of the limit of tree growth; (2) a boreal trans-con- 
tinental coniferous forest region ; (3) an Atlantic or Eastern wooded 
region stretching westward from the Atlantic to the Great Plains ; (4) 
a central or middle region, reaching from the plains to the Sierra 
Nevada and Cascade Mountains; (5) a Pacific or California division, 
covering the area between the east base of the Sierra and the Pacific 
Ocean; (6) a Lonisianian or Austro-riparian division, comi)rising the 
South Atlantic and Gulf States south of latitude 36°; (7) a Sonoran 
division, occupying the high table-land of Mexico and stretching north- 
ward over the dry interior far enough to include the southern j)arts of 
California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. 

With or without reference to the above ])rincipal divisions, it has 
been recently the custom of zoologists, particularly ornithologists, to 
sub-divide the eastern United States and Canada into several minor 
areas or ''faunas," as follows: [a) Floridian; (&) Lonisianian; (c) Caro- 
linian; (rf) Alleghanian; (e) Canadian; (/) Hudsonian; and (//) Arctic. 
Of these the Canadian and Hudsonian form a part of the "Boreal" 
region above mentioned, and the Floridian and Lonisianian together 
make up the " Austro-riparian" division, leaving only the Carolinian and 
Alleghanian for the so-called "Eastern province" to rest ou. The true 
relations of these zones will be explained later. 



GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 381 
LIFE REGIONS AND ZONES OF NORTH AMERICA 

In a ('oiuiimiii(tatioii 1 had tlie honor to \ny before this society two 
years ago (December 4, 1889),* I stated that the Iludsonian and Cana- 
dian zones of the East belong' to the Boreal region, and extend com- 
pletely across the continent, and that the desert areas of the West 
belong to the Southern or Sonoran region. The pine plateau {Pium 
jKmderosa) of Arizona and other jiarts of the West was " shown to 
consist of a mixture of Boreal and Sonoran types. - - - In other 
words, it is neutral territory'' {Xorth American Fauna^ No. 3, Sep- 
tember, 1890, }). 20). I remarked further that the Carolinian fauna 
" is suffused with southern forms, and the Alleghanian seems to be 
neutral ground'' {I hid., p. 18), thus imi)lying that the "neutral" or pine- 
plateau zone of Arizona is the western equivalent of the "Alleghanian 
Fauna" of the East. 

In a subsequent publication {Xorth American Fauna, No. 5, August, 
1891) I went a step further, defining the treeless parts of the "Neutral 
or Transition zone," and characterizing an " Upper Sonoran zone," as 
distinguished from the Lower or True Sonoran; but nothing was said 
as to the relations of these zones with those long recognized in the East. 

The time has now arrived, however, when it is possible to correlate 
the Sonoran zones of the West with corresponding zones in the East, 
as was done two years ago in the case of the Boreal zones, and as was 
intimated in the case of th'e Neutral or Transition zone. It can now 
be asserted with some confidence not only that the Transition zone of 
the West is the equivalent of the Alleghanian of the East, but also 
that the Upper Sonoran is the equivalent of the Carolinian, and the 
Lower Sonoran of the Austro-riparian, and that each can be traced 
completely across the continent. Thus, all the major and minor zones 
that have been established in tlie East are found to be uninterruptedly 
continuous with corresponding zones in the West, though their courses 
are often tortuous, following the lines of equal temperature during the 
season of reiu'oduction, which lines conform in a general way to the 
c<mtours of altitude, rising with increased base-level and falling with 
increased latitude. 

The Boreal region extends obliquely across the entire continent 
from New England and Newfoundland to Alaska and British Columbia, 
and from about latitude 45° north to the Polar Sea, conftn'ndug in gen- 
eral diiection to the trend of the northern shores of the continent. It 
recedes to about latitude 54° on the ])lains of the Saskatchewan, and 
gives off three long arms or chains of islands, which reach far south 
along the three great mountain systems of the United States — an 
eastern arm in the Alleghanies, a central arm in the Eocky Mountains, 



* Since published in my report <»n the " Results of ;> Biological Survey of the San 
Francisco Mountain region in Arizona,"' X. Am. Fauna, No. 3, September 11, 1890, 



382 GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 

and a western arm in the Cascades and Sierra Nevada, The latter at 
its northern base occupies the entire breadth of the Pacific Coast 
region from the eastern slope of the mountains to the sea, but in pass- 
ing southward" bifurcates, the main fork following the lofty Cascade 
and Sierra ranges to about latitude 36°: the other following the coast, 
gradually losing its distinctive characters and becoming invaded with 
Sonoran forms until it disappears a little north of San Francisco. 

The following genera of mammals belong exclusively to the Boreal 
region, none of them ranging south beyond the Transition zone:

reaches south a little beyond the Transition zone), Teonoma (the bushy- 
tailed wood-rats), and Neosore.v and Atophyrax (subgenera of shrews). 

The Boreal region is made up of two iirincipal divisions, both circum- 
polar: (1) An Arctic division, above the limit of tree growth; and (2) 
a Boreal Coniferous Forest division.

The Boreal Coniferous Forest division may be subdivided into at

and a third or "Timber-line zone" may be differentiated from the Hud- 
sonian ])roper. In speaking of the divisions of the Boreal region on 
high mountains it is customary to add the word alpine to the name of 
the division; thus, Arctic-alpiue, Hudsoniau-alpine, and so on.

The Soiioran regiou as a whole stretches across the continent from 
Atlantic to Pacific, covering- nearly the whole country south of latitude 
43^ and reaching northward on the Great Plains and Great Basin to 
about latitude 48°. It is invaded from tlie north by three principal 
intrusions of boreal forms along the three great mountain systems 
already mentioned; while to the southward it occupies the great inte- 
rior basin of Mexico and extends into the tropics along the highlands 
of the interior. It covers also the peninsula of Lower California, the 
southern part of which seems entitled to rank as an independent sub- 
division. 

The following genera belong exclusively to the Sonoran region (as 
distinguished from the boreal), none of them ranging north beyond tlie 
transition zone. Those preceded by the letter T are intrusions from the 
tropical regiou.

t Tbe generic name licithrodoniomys was proposed by Giglioli in 1873 (Eicherche

Ochetodon of Cones. 



GEOGRAPHIC DISTKIJ3UTI0N OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 385 

In addition to tlio above, the following genera seem to be of Sonoran 
or anstial origin, altliough reaclnug and in some cases penetrating a 
considerable distance into tlie boreal region: 



Ciiri;u'iis. 


Neotoraa.

Atalapha. 


Cynoiiiys. 


TProcyou. 


Lynx. 


Vesperuf^o. 


Sitoiiiys.' 


Tax id pa. 


Scapanus. 


Vespertilio. 



The genera Sitomys, ?l(!2)hitis^ Lynx, Atakqika, Vesjyerugo, and Ves- 
prrtilio range well north in the Boreal zone, where each is represented 
by a single species. In the Sonoran zone, on the other hand, these 
same genera reach their maximnm development and are represented by 
numerous species. 

Besides the genera above enumerated, a number of sub-genera belong 
to the Simoran region. Among these are NeosciKrus and Farasciurufi 
(subgenera of Schirus), Xerospe7'mophilus,j AmmofipermopMluSj\ aud 
Ieti<lo)in/s {sub-geneTH of SjiermopMlns), Pitymys, Pedomys, and Xeofiher 
(sub-genera of Arvicola),i\\\(\. Cha'todipus (a sub-genus of Pcrof/nathus, 
which is almost entitled to rank as a full genus). 

The Sonoran region maj' be divided by temperature into two princi- 
pal trans-continental zones, («) Upper Sonoran, and (6) Lower Sonoran ; § 
and each of these in turn may be sub-divided into arid and humid 
divisions. 

The gray fox, Urocyon, ranges over both Upper and Lower Sonoran 
from Atlantic to Pacific; and pocket gophers of the genus Geomys 
inhabit both these divisions on the Great Plains and in the Mississippi 
Valley, and range east to the Atlantic in the Austro-riparian zone. 

P>oth divisions of the Lower Sonoran are inhabited by the transcon- 
tinental genera PeitJirodonfomys, Sigmodon, Corynorhinus, Xyctlnomus, 
Otoptt'nifi, Xcotoma, and Spilogale, though in the Avest the two last men- 
tioned range through the Upper Sonoran also. 

The humid Lower Sonoran or Austro-riparian is a division of much 
importance. It begins on the Atlantic seaboard at the nnmth of Ches- 
apeake Bay and stretches thence southwesterly, embracing the alluvial 
lands of the South Atlantic and Gulf States below what geologists 

* The generic name Hesperomys being untenable, Allen has recently stxbstituted 
for it the name Vcsperimus proposed by Cones as a subgenus in 1874 (Bull. Am. Mu.i. 
X<(t. Hifit., Juno, 1891, in, Xo. 2, p]>. 291-297). J'ei^pcrimus is ante-dated by Silomys 
of Fit/.inger, proposed in 18G7, aud based on Gapper's Cricctus juijoidrs from Lake 
Simcoe, Ontario, Canada (Siizitnyshcr. math. nat. Classe, K. Akad. JViss. Wicn. 1867, 
LVi, p. 97). Gappers Cricefus myoidesi>i the conunon white-footed mouse of southern 
Ontario and northern New York, which therefore becomes the type of the genus.

know as the '^ fall line," rising in the Mississippi bottom as far as the 
junction of the Ohio with the Mississippi, and following the former in 
a narrow strip to the point where it receives the Wabash. On the west 
side of the Mississippi it crosses Arkansas, reaches southern Missouri 
and southeastern Kansas, and spreads out over Indian and Oklahoma 
Territories and Texas, where it loses its moisture and merges insensibly 
into the arid Sonoran. Oryzomys and JSfycticejus are distinctive Aus- 
troriparian genera. Six other genera {Neotoma, Eeithrodontojnys, 
Geomys, SpilogaJe, NycUnomus^ and Gorynorkinus)^ which in the region 
east of the Mississippi seem to be restricted to this division, have a 
more extended range in the west. The cotton rat {8i(/modon), another 
characteristic Austro-riparian genus, has a very limited range in the 
arid Sonoran. 

The arid Lower Sonoran extends westerly from the humid Sonoran 
to the Pacific, covering south'nm jS"ew Mexico and Arizona south of the 
plateau rim (sending a tongue up the Eio Grande to a point above Albu- 
querque), the west side of which it follows northerly to the extreme 
northwestern corner of Arizona and the southwestern corner of Utah 
(where it is restricted to the valley of the lower Santa Clara, or St. 
George Valley), and thence westerly across Nevada, reaching northerly 
to Pahranagat, Oasis, and Owens valleys, and thence curving south- 
westerly, following the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada, Tehachapi, 
and Tejon Mountains, and covers the whole of the Mohave and Colo- 
rado deserts and all the rest of southern California except the moun- 
tains. It sends an arm southward over most of the ijeninsula of Lower 
California, and another northward covering the San Joaquin and Sac- 
ramento valleys. The distinctive mammals of the arid Lower Sonoran 
are kangaroo rats of the genus IHpodomys, pocket-mice of the sub-genus 
Chcetodijms, and spermophiles of the sub-genera Xerospermophilus and 
Amniospermoph ilus. 

The peninsula of Lower California is a sub-division of the arid Lower 
Sonoran zone. Not a single genus of land mammal or bird is restricted 
to it and but two peculiar species of mammals have been described. 
The peculiar birds are more numerous, but with few exceptions are 
only sub-specifically separable from those of neighboring parts of the 
United States and Mexico. They may be classed in two categories: 
(1) mountain forms derived from the North (of Boreal or Transition 
origin); and (2) lowland forms derived from the contiguous plains (of 
Sonoran, or in one instance, sub-tropical origin). As would be ex- 
pected from the character of the country, the great majority are sub- 
species of well known Sonoran forms, with the addition of a small num- 
ber of peculiar species belonging to Sonoran genera. But a single sub- 
tropical bird is known, namely, Dendroica hryanti castaneicepsy and it 
is restricted to the mangrove lagoons. 

The presence of this sub-tropical bird in the narrow coast lagoons is 
in complete accord with the vegetation of the coast strip, which, as Mr. 



GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 387 

T. S. Bnindegee tells us, is sub-tro})ical.* This indicates the presence 
of a narrow coast belt similar to that of southern Florida, but of less 
extent. It is possible that Basilinna xantusi is sub-troi:)ical rather than 
Sonoran, but the details of distribution of the genus are not well 
known. 

Among reptiles, about -.") ])eculiar species of snakes and lizards are 
belic\ed to be restricted to the peninsula, but no peculiar genus is 
known. Three of the genera are tropical, and nine are arid Lower 
Sonoran. 

In addition to the ])eculiar species and sub-species of the ])eninsulai, 
many characteristic arid Lower Sonoran forms of manunals, birds, rep- 
tiles, insects, and x)lants abound. Among the latter maybe mentioned 
the highly distinctive Sonoran desert brush, Larrea mexicana and 
Kra lit cr i<( pa r r ifolui . 

Cope includes the whole peninsula in his Lower California region, 
but other writers restrict the peculiar fauna and flora to the end of 
the i)eninsula south of the north foot of the mountains between La. Paz 
and Todos Santos. Bryant states: "There is no more sharply defined 
faunal and floral area that occurs to me now, excepting that of islands, 
than is embraced in tlie region above defined," t but he omits to name 
the forms by which it is characterized. It is evident however that 
the peculiar fauna of the peninsula of Lower California entitles it to 
rank as a minor sub-division of the Lower Sonoran zone. It is in effect 
an insular fauna of recent origin, bearing the same relation to that of 
the mainland as do several of the adjacent islands. 

The humid division of the Upper Sonoran comprises the area in the 
eastern United States commonly known as the Carolinian fauna. The 
opossum {Dideljiliis) here finds its northern limit, as do the so-called 
pine-mouse (sub-genus ntymys) and the Georgian bat ( Vesperugo geor- 
gianus). Before reaching the one hundredth meridian this area grad- 
ually loses its moisture and spreads out over the Great Plains as the 
arid or true L'"pper Sonoran, reaching an altitude of about 4,000 feet 
along the east foot of the Rocky ^Mountains in the latitude of Colorado, 
and sending a tongue northward along the Missouri obliquely through 
North Dakota and into eastern Montana. Another sub-division of the 
arid Upper Sonoran occu])ies the greater part of the Great Basin 
between the Kocky Mountains and the High Sierra, reaching northerly 
from the upper border of the Lower Sonoran to and including the plains 
of the Columbia and Snake rivers. Another part of noteworthy 
extent is a narrow belt encircling the interior basin of California — the 
valley of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers — and a branch of the 
same along the coast between Monterey and the Santa Barbara plain.

388 GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 

The following genera of mammals find their northern limit in the arid 
Upper Sonoran zone : Perodipm^ Microdipodops, Perognothus, Onyclio- 
mys, Spilof/ale, Uroci/on, Bassariscus, and Atitrozous. 

Interposed between the Boreal and Sonoran regions throughont their 
numerous windings and interdigitations, is the Neutral or Transition 
zone. The humid division of this zone, known as the Alleghanian 
ftiuna,* covers the greater part of Kew England (except Maine and 
the mountains of Vermont and New Hampshire) and extends westerly 
over the greater part of New York, southern Ontario, and Pennsyl- 
vania, and sends an arm south along the Alleghanies all the way across 
the Virginias, Carolina s, and eastern Tennessee, to northern Georgia 
and Alabama. In the Great Lake region this zone continues westerly 
across southern Michigan and Wisconsin, and then curves northward 
over the prairie region of Minnesota, covering the greater j)arts of 
North Dakota, Manitoba, and the plains of the Saskatchewan ; thence 
bending abruptly south, it crosses eastern Montana and Wyoming, 
including parts of western South Dakota and Nebraska, and forms a 
belt along the eastern base of the Eocky Mountains in Colorado and 
northern New Mexico, here as elsewhere occupying the interval between 
the Upper Sonoran and boreal zones. 

In Wyoming the transition zone passes broadly over the well-known 
low divide of the Eocky Mountains, which affords the route of the 
Union Pacific Eailway, and is directly continuous with the same zone 
in parts of Colorado, Utah, and Idaho, skirting the boreal boundaries 
of the Great Basin all the way around the plains of the Columbia, 
sending an arm northward over the dry interior of British Columbia, 
descending along the eastern base of the Cascade Eange and the High 
Sierra to the southern extremity of the latter, and occupying the sum. 
mits of the coast ranges in California and of many of the desert ranges 
of the Great Basin. 

The transition zone, as its name indicates, is a zone of overlapping 
of boreal and Sonoran types. Many boreal genera and species here 
reach the extreme southern limits of their distribution, and many 
Sonoran genera and species their northern limits. But a single mam- 
malian genus [Synaptomys) is restricted to the transition zone, and 
future research may show it to inhabit the boreal region also. 

* Prof. Louis Agassiz, in his highly important work on Lake Superior, clearly rec- 
ognized the transition nature of this zone, for he says : " The State of Massachusetts, 
with its long arm stretched into the ocean eastward, or rather the region extending 
westward under the same xjarallel through the State of New York, forms a natural 
limit hetween the vegetation of the warm temperate zone and that of the cold tem- 
perate zone. - - - Not only is this also the northern limit of the culture of fruit 
trees, but this zone is equally remarkable for the great variety of elegant shrubs 
which occur particularly on its northern borders, where we find so great a variety 
of species belonging to the genera Celastrus, Crataegus, Ribes, Cornus, Hamanielis, 
Vaccinium, Kalmia, Rhodora, Azalea, Rhododendron, Andromeda, Clethra, Vibur- 
num, Cephalanthus, Prinos, Dirca, Celtis, etc." (L«Av Superior, 18.50, 182-183.)

As already stated, the only mammalian genus apparently restricted

Among these are the following:

to secure a boreal fauna and tlora, the latter is always separated from

Iteratnre of the water. The same is true in a less degree of the paludal sub-genera

the Sonoran of the surrounding plane by a belt or girdle of transition 
zone forms. 

Tlie tropical region reaches the United States at two remote points — 
Florida and Texas. In the former it exists as a narrow subtropical 
belt encircling the southern half of the peninsula from Cape Malabar 
on the east to Tampa Bay on the west. In Texas it crosses the Lower 
Eio Grande from Mexico, and extends north to the Nueces Eiver. In 
western Mexico the tropical region reaches Mazatlan. 

Fourteen families of tropical mammals inhabit North America north 
of Panama, namely : 



Didelphidse. 


Dicotylidie. 


Procyon'dsB. 


Hapalidse. 


Bradypodidte. 


Tapiridge. 


SolenodontidfB. 


CebidsB. 


Myrmecophagidie. 


Octodontidse. 


EmballonuridiTe. 




Dasypodidie. 


Dasyproctidfe, 


Phyllostomatida?. 





Of the above fourteen families, six reach the United States, namely, 
J)%del])Mdw, Dasypodid(v, Dicotylidw, Procyonida', EmhaUonuridw, and 
Phyllostomatidce, and two of the latter {DidelpMdie and Procyonid(v) 
penetrate the entire breadth of the Sonoran region, the Proeyonidce 
even entering the lower edge of the Boreal. Descending from families 
to genera, it is found that no less than sixty-two tropical genera of non- 
pelagic mammals inhabit North America north of Panama, of which 
number nine enter the United States from Mexico, namely, BidelpMs, 
Tatusiaj Dicotyies, Nasua, Procyon, Felts, Ilolossm, Nyctinomus, and 
Otopterus. Of these, Didelphis, Felis, and Procyon now reach consid- 
erably further north than the others, as just pointed out in speaking 
of the families to which they respectively belong. In explanation of 
this extended range it is found that these genera inhabited North 
America in pre-glacial times, and as a consequence have become accli- 
matized to a wider range of climatic conditions. The semi-tropical 
belt of Florida is not known to possess any tropical mammals except 
bats and a large indigenous mouse {Sitomys macropiis),* but it has not 
been explored by experienced mammal collectors. Still, its recent 
origin and complete isolation from other tropical areas would indicate 
the absence of terrestrial species derived from the south. At the same 
time it is known to berich in tropical plants, land shells, insects, and birds, 
as is shown in another part of the present paper (see post pp. 404, 
405). It contains nine genera of tropical birds, namely Zenaida, Geo- 
tryfjon, titarnoenas, Rostrhamus, Polyhorus, Grotophaga, Fueiheia, Galli- 
chelidon, and Goereha. 

The following sixty-two genera of mammals belong to the North 
American tropical region. The nine preceded by the letter S enter 
the southern United States, which they penetrate varying distances. 
Nyctinomus and Otopterus inhabit the Lower Sonoran zone in common

Kecapitulating, it is found that of the 134 genera of non-pelagic 
mammals inhabiting Xorth America north of Panama, 53 are exclu- 
sively fropical, 20 exclusively Sonorau, and 20 exclusively boreal. In 
addition to these genera, which do not outstep the limits of the regions 
to which they severally belong, a number of others are clearly referable 
to the same regions, though ranging varying distances beyond their 
proper boundaries. Including these genera, the number belonging to 
each region is as follows: Tropical, 62; Sonorau, 34; boreal, 31; thus 
leaving but 7 genera out of a total of 134 that are not distinctly refer- 
able to one of the three regions. One of these {Synaptomys) is not 
known to occur outside the limits of the transition zone, leaving but 
six genera that have not been assigned. These genera are Sciuropterus, 
^S(^itlnls, Spermophiliis, Lepus, Canis, and Lutra, each of which ranges 
over large parts of both boreal and Sonoran regions. All except ^Sper- 
mophllus inhabit the tropical region also, and all are of great antiquity, 
as will be shown i)resently (p. 303). The genera Spennophi I us and Lepns 
might be referred to the Sonoran region, because the great majority of 
their species are confined to it; and for the same reason Sciurus might 
be considered troi)ical and Sonorau. 

Omitting Mexico and Central America, and regarding the 9 intru- 
sive tropical genera already mentioned as Sonoran (in contradistinc- 
tion to boreal), it is found that SI genera of uon-i)elagicmanmials inhabit 
the L'uited States and Canada, of wiiich 43 may be looked ui)on as (kf 
Sonoran origin and 31 as of boreal origin. The 7 genera remaining are 
those mentioned in the last paragraph.

DISTINCTNESS OF THE TROPICAL REGION FROM THE SONORAN. 

It lias been shown that the fauna and flora of tropical America reach 
the United States, though in a somewhat dilute condition, along the 
Lower Eio Grande in Texas and in southern Florida, and that in the 
vast majority of cases their genera and species difi'er widely from those 
of other parts of America. Except for the presence, chiefly in the south- 
ern United States, of a comparatively few forms derived from the 
tropical region, the ftiuna and flora of North America are as distinctive 
and independent of the existence of this area as if separated from it by 
the broad ocean. Among the eighty-one genera of non-pelagic 3Iam- 
malia inhabiting North America north of Mexico the number of these 



* Having one species iu Sonorau zone or reaching Sonoran. 

t Having one species in Boreal zone or reaching southern edge of Boreal. 



GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OP LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 393 

intrusive genera is only nine,* as has been shown, and three of these 
are bats. These genera are: Didelphis Tatusia, Dicotyles, Felis, Pro- 
cyan, N'asiia, Molossiis, Nijetinomiis^ and Otopterus. Tatusia and Nasiia 
barely reach our southern boundary; Dicotyles extends only part way 
through Texas; Molossiis a short distance into southern California; 
N'yGtinomuii and Ofoptcnis do not pass beyond the lower Sonoran zone, 
and Didel2)his is restricted to the humid division of the Sonoran. Out 
of the nine intrusive genera, therefore, but two {Fells and Procyon) 
reach the southern edge of the Boreal. 

On the other hand, a few groujis, such as the wolves, otters, squirrels, 
and rabbits (genera Caiiis, Lntra, iSclut'iis, Seiiwopterus, Spermophilus, 
and Lepus) occur over large parts of both North and South America, 
presenting a seeming obstacle to the acceptance of the view that the 
faunas in question are so wholly dissimilar. But investigation shows 
that these animals are almost world-wide in distribution, implying great 
antiquity of origin, and remains of most of them have been found as low 
down at least as the Miocene strata in both America and Eurasia. 
Hence it is clear that these types became diffused over North and South 
America at a very distant period, and their peculiar habits of life, though 
wholly dissimilar, enabled them to survive the great mutations these 
laud areas have undergone since Miocene times. 

The paucity of species of tropical derivation in North America is the 
more remarkable in view of the absence of barriers of any kind, save 
climatic conditions alone, to impede the free ingress of species from the 
south. No mountain range or arm of the sea or other tangible obstacle 
marks the northern boundary of the semi-tropical fauna of northeastern 
Mexico, where it ends abruptly near the Nueces River in Texas, or the 
semi-tropical belt of Florida, where it ends near Tamjia Bay on the 
west and (^ape Malabar on the east. 

If the tr()])ical fauna and flora stopped at the narrow Isthmus of 
Panama, or even in southern Nicaragua, where the last union of the 
North and South American continents probably took place, the case 
would be very different, but instead of doing this it pushes northward 
1,500 to 2,000 miles and ends abruptly where the most painstaking 
search fails to rev^eal any barrier to further extension, except an uucon- 
gniial decrease in tenii)erature ;uid humidity. (See also remarks under 
change of climate following Pleistocene times, p. 308.) 

No more striking illustration could be desired of the potency of cli- 
mate com])ar»Ml with the inelliciency of physical barriers than is pre- 
sented by the almost total dissimilarity of the North American Tropical 
and Sonoran regions, though in direct contact, contrasted with the 
great similarity of the Jioreal regions ot North America and Eurasia, 
now separated by broad oceans, though formerly united doubtless in 
the region of Bering Sea. Of the thirty-one Boreal genera of North

394 GEOGRAPHIC DISTKIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 

American mammals all but eight, or three-fourths, occur also in Eurasia, 
aud but a single family is restricted to cold- temperate America. This 
family (the Aplodontidce) is the sole representative of a group approach- 
ing extinction, and the accident of its survival (in a single genus and 
two closely related species) in a very limited area along our west coast 
can hardly be construed as of much faunal significance. Contrasted 
with this one family (which ought not to be counted) and eight genera 
of Boreal North American mammals not occurring in Eurasia, tropical 
North America (Central America and part of Mexico, exclusive of the 
West Indies) has no less than eight families and fifty-three genera not 
belonging to the immediately adjoining Sonoran region of the southern 
United States and the plateau of Mexico. 

THE SONORAN NOT A TRANSITION REGION. 

Before leaving this part of the subject reference should be made to 
the view recently advanced by some naturalists, notably by Angelo 
Heilprin, that the Sonoran region is itself a "Transition region" 
between the Boreal and Tropical faunas and floras. The incorrect- 
ness of this hypothesis is easily demonstrated, for it rests upon the 
assumption that the Sonoran region is a mixture of Boreal and Tropical 
forms. The contrary has just been shown to be the case, the hiatus 
between the Sonoran and Boreal on the one hand and the Sonoran and 
Tropical on the other being not only immense, but vastly greater than 
that between Boreal America and Eurasia. 

DIFFERENTIATION OF LIFE FROM THE NORTH SOUTHWAED. 

Animals and jjlants inhabiting the Arctic regions are usually spe- 
cifically identical throughout Arctic America, Greenland, and the polar 
parts of Eurasia and outlying islands, while as they diverge from the 
pole southward they tend to split up into many species; in other words, 
Boreal species are more stable and persistent than those inhabiting 
warmer countries. The explanation of this fact is obvious. The iden- 
tity of climate and environment throughout the Arctic zone tends to 
preserve identity of specific characters, giving rise to a homogeneous 
fauna and flora, while the diversity of ])liysical conditions and climatic 
influences prevailing in an increasing degree at greater distances from 
the pole exerts a powerful influence upon the various forms of life, 
produ(;ing first local geographic races or sub-species, then species, and 
finally groups of species constituting well-marked sub-genera and even 
genera, giving rise to greatly diversified faunas and floras. Thus 
among mammals the polar or ice henv {llialarctofi maritmu,s) has iio 
very near relative, and is replaced in the tundras by the brown and 
barren-ground bears {Ursus arctos and richardsoni), Avhich run into 
several more or less distinct forms, as the snow bear ( U. isahellinus), 
Syrian bear ( U. syriacus), and hairy-eared bear ( Z7. piscator). Besides 



GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 395 

these are the grizzly ( U. horribilis), of which two forms may be recog- 
nized) and the bhick bears of America and Enrasia ( U. americanus, 
torquatus, and japoniei(s)', and still farther sonthward the gronp be- 
comes difierentiated into several well-marked genera. 

In like manner the Arctic fox is replaced to the southward, first, by 
the red foxes of America and Eurasia, of which several sub-sijecies are 
known; second, by a number of quite distinct species; and third, by 
additional types, at least one of which in (mr country is entitled to 
generic rank ( TJrocyon). 

The erniine and polar hare are the sole Arctic representatives of 
groups which in the temperate parts of Europe and America comprise 
many distinct species, and in the case of the former, several well- 
marked sub-genera. 

The Arctic lemmings (genera Myodes and Gimiculus) are numerously 
represented in the north temperate i)arts of the w^orld by the genera 
EUohhis, Synaptomys, rkenaoomys, Unotomys, Fiher, and Arvicola. 

It is not to be inferred from the above remarks that the polar repre- 
sentatives of these various groups are to be looked upon as the parent 
stocks from which the other members sprang. Usually the reverse is 
the case, for groups of Boreal origin that now attain their maximum 
development in the north temperate regions have their^number reduced 
in the Arctic circle to a single representative. But regardless of cen- 
ters of origin, it is here intended to emphasize the fact that types in- 
habiting the Arctic zone are few in number and uniform in character 
throughout their distribution, while to the southward the same types 
become more and more diversified and new types a])pear as the distance 
from the pole increases,* so that it may be formulated as a general 
proposition that in continental areas the further from the poles, the 
larger the number of families^ <jenera, and species, t 

* The elder Agassiz long since pointed out that " the vegetation of the two conti- 
nents becomes more and more homogeneous the more we advance northward." (Lake 
Sujterior, 1850, 15:1.) Stated conversely, this is in complete accord -with the "Law 
of differentiation from tlie north sonthward" fornuilatcd by Allen as "a constant 
and accelerated divergence in the cliaracters of the animals and plants of successive 
regions of the continent." (Bull. Muh. ('omp. Zoiil. II., 1871,379.) In a later contri- 
hutiou the same author speaks of the "high rate of differentiation favored by trop- 
ical conditions of climate," and adds that Arctic and cold-temperate climates are 
chara<terized by only slightly or moderately diversified faunas; that a moderate 
increase of temperature results in the addition of many new types; and that "a 
high incrcast^ in iemperature, giving tropical conditions of climate," is accompanied 
by ''a rapid mulfii>licatiou of ni'w forms and a maximum of dilVerentiation." 

t This is a general ])ro)>osition intended to ai)iily to terrestrial forms of life eol- 
tevtirch/, and does not conllict with the law that the maximum niiml)er of si)eci(^s in 
each particular group is found in the zone or area which is tiio center of its distri- 
bution. 



396 GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 
ORIGIN OF 'i'YPES AND FAUNAS — GEOLOGIC EVIDENCE. 

In speaking of the Boreal aud Souoraii origin of species aud groups 
in the present paper, the term "origin" is used exchisively in a sense 
intended to indicate present centers of distribution — not real or ancient 
centers of origin; for it must be borne in mind that the history of the 
inhabitants of the earth is not only a history of the successive appear- 
ance and disappearance of types now extinct, but a history of great 
movements — of vast migrations to and fro over the surface of the globe, 
and little is known of the real points of origin of our Boreal and Tropi- 
cal faunas and floras. The geologic evidence demonstrates that in the 
past large land areas have been many times joined together and many 
times rent asunder. The establishment of land continuity between 
areas previously disconnected has made it possible for new forms of 
animals and plants to obtain a footing and spread over regions pre- 
viously uninhabited by them, — often doubtless at the expense of the 
indigenous fauna and flora. Even great continents, as North and 
South America, have been more than once united and separated; and 
the last union of these continents is so recent we can distinctly trace at 
the present day the course and distribution of the intrusive forms. 

On the other hand, in comparatively recent times, multitudes of 
species and genera, and even families and higher groups, have sud- 
denly disappeared from large areas where they were formerly abundant, 
and some of them from the face of the earth, so that the fauna of the 
recent past compared with that of to-day presents some strange con- 
trasts. ISTorth America in Pleistocene times was inhabited by associa- 
tions of mammals not now living on this continent, but found in as far 
distant parts of the earth as Asia and South America; for horses, 
camels, and elephants then lived here with llamas, tapirs, and capy- 
baras. With them were others now altogether extinct, as huge tigers, 
wolves, cave bears, the great Mastodon, the Megatherium, Megalonyx, 
Mylodon, and other gigantic sloths. 

GLACIAL EPOCH. 

The cause of this sudden extermination of dominant ty[)es is believed 
to have been the Glacial epoch, which is known to have driven species 
of animals and plants fi-om the poles to the tropics, and which explains 
several of the otherwise inexplicable problems presented in the study 
of the ])ast and in-esent distribution of life. 

The snows at the beginning of the Glacial epoch fell upon a conti- 
nent of great forests — forests that gave shelter to multitudes of mam- 
mals and birds and other forms of life, a large i)roportion of which no 
longer inhabit America, and many of which do not exist in any part of 
the globe. 

During the period of maximum development the great glacier is be- 
lieved to have been not less than 8,000 feet in thickness in northern

New England, and its soutliern border crossed New Jersey and Penn- 
sylvania, and tlicnce, cnrving irregularly southwesterly to southern 
Illinois and then northwesterly, linnlly reached the Pacitic Ocean in 
Britisli C'Olunibia. Tlie disastrous effect upon jininnils and i)hints of 
this tremendous body ol" ice must have reached lar south of its actual 
holders. 

The (Jlacial epoch is believed to liave been made U]) of at least two 
princii)5d and a number of minor advances and retreats, separated by 
long intervals and ac<'()iji])iinied doubtless by corresponding Huctuji- 
tions in the northern boundaries of the faunal and Horal areas immedi- 
ately to the south ; for it is reasona])le to supi^ose that throughout the 
p<Miod covere<l by the movements of the ice mantle, and probably in 
later pre-glacial times as well, the forms now known as Boreal and 
Arctic (or their immediate ancestors) inhabited areas characterized by 
temperatures not very different from those they now require, and that 
the northern limit of each species kept at a certain uniform distance 
from the ice line. " Plants," says Dr. Gray, " are the thermometers of 
the Jiges, by which climatic extremes and climates in general are best 
nn'asured." 

Important evidence of the correctness of this hypothesis is afforded 
by the well known presence of colonies or assend)lages of arctic species 
on isolated mountain summits in scmthern latitudes, where the altitude 
carries them into the low temperature of their homes in the far north. 
It is obvious that such colonies could not have reached their present 
positions during existing climatic conditions. But during the return 
movement of animal and plant life following the retreat of cold at 
the close of the Glacial epoch, many Boreal species were stranded on 
mountains, where, by climbing upward as the temperature increased, 
they were enabled to survive, finding a final resting place with a climate 
sufliciently cool for their needs, and here they have existed to the present 
day.* 

Throughout the growth of the great ice mass and its extension from 
the north southward it is clear that the animals and i)lants that could 
not keep pace with its advance must have perished, while the steady 
pusliing toward the tropics of those that were able to escape to the 
rapidly narrowing land in that direction must have resulted in an over- 
crowding of the space available for their needs and a corresponding in- 
crease in the severity of the struggle for existence. The sustaining (!a- 
])acity of a region is limited; hence such a thing as over-crowding, in 
the sense of greatly increasing the number of organisms a region can 
support, is an impossibility, for beyond a certain limit all excess of life

must perish, — over -crow ding- inevitably leading to death. The mor- 
tality in any one year may not have been great, but during the many 
thousands of years covered by the movements of the continental ice the 
aggregate destruction of life must have been stupendous. 

Immediately ujion the close of the Glacial epoch, life began to reclaim 
the regions from which it had been so long shut out. This overflow 
released the tension under which the animals and plants had been strug- 
gling for ages and rendered the contest for existence less severe. Over- 
l)roduction had at last found an outlet, and life became possible to a con- 
stantly increasing- number of individuals. Normal reproduction was 
sufdciently rapid to supply occupants for the regions made habitable 
by the slow recession of the ice, and the advance of both plants and 
animals kept pace, doubtless, with its progressive increase. But the 
species that survived to return were only in part those driven out. 
Many had been overtaken by the cold or had perished in the journey 
southward; others were driven into inhospitable regions where the en- 
vironment was not suited to their needs; others still succumbed in the 
struggle resulting from over-crowding, and some that outlived the first 
great period of glaciation perished during the second. Gilbert tells us 
that a detailed study of the ancient lake beds of the Great Basin 
"shows two lacustral epochs corresponding- to two glacial epochs, and 
correlates the mammalian fauna with the later half of the later Glacial 
epoch. Presumptively this date falls very late in the Pleistocene 
period." ("Lake Bonneville," by G. K. Gilbert, .181)0, 397.) The mam- 
malian fauna referred to comprises an elephant, an otter, two horses, 
three llamas, a deer of the genus Cervus, an ox, a gigantic sloth, to- 
gether with three species now living, namely, the coyote, beaver, and 
pocket gopher (27/ owow^/s). ISTo new types came in to take the place 
of those exterminated ; hence w^e in the United States now live in a 
region deprived of many of the groups to which it gave birth, and we 
are forced to visit remote parts of the earth to see animals and plants 
that once attained their maximum development in North America, 
while others that formerly flourished here are entirely extinct. 

Not only are the pre-Pleistocene animals and plants now represented 
imperfectly and in greatly reduced numbers, but the areas at present 
inhabited by their descendants, except in the case of the Boreal forms, 
are insignificant in comparison with their former extent. It should be 
remend)ered that the refrigeration of the Glacial epoch has only in part 
disappeared. In early Pliocene times characteristic representatives of 
sub -tropical ftiunas and floras existed northward over much of the 
United States and Canada, and in still earlier times reached the Arctic 
Circle.* During the advance of cold in the Glacial epoch these forms 
were either exterminated or driven southward into the narrow tropical 
parts of Mexico and Central America. The retreat of cold at the ter-

luiuatiou of this period w<i>s not complete, iintl our coutiueiit has uever 
regaiued its former warmth. Hence the expelled species were not per- 
mitted to advance more than a short distance into the region formerly 
occupied by them, and tlic tri>pical species have been held back and at 
the pr(5sent day arc not found except along the extreme southern con- 
tines of our territoiy. For example, peccaries in early Pleistocene times 
ranged northward over a large part of western America, while at pres- 
ent they are restricted to parts of Texas and Louisiana- below the lied 
Iviver of the South; and the capybaras, tapirs, and other tropical forms 
whose fossil remains have be<',n found in many parts of the United 
States have not been able to retnrn. The same is true of plants; for 
the ])alms, tree ferns, and numerous other tropical types that formerly 
ranged over much of our country, are now either altogether extinct or 
exist only in the tro])ics. 

Tliellama — and many plants — now inhabiting the Andes may belooked 
upon as representing a class of cases in which Boreal forms were driven 
so far south that they actually reached the great mountain system of 
South America, and spread southward over its elevated plateaus and 
declivities to the extreme end of the continent in Patagonia and Terra 
del Fuego. This fact has been long recognized by botanists. 

The paheontologic history of the earth shows that many groups now 
unknown came into existence from preceding groups, gradually attained 
a maximum development, and as gradually passed away; but there are 
few records of breaks in the geologic series, or of disturbances of any 
kind from the earliest appearance of life to the present time, that have 
resulted in the destruction of so many types as the cold of the Glacial 
epoch. 

(!AUSES CONTKOLLINCt DISTRIBUTION. 

It is now pretty generally conceded that temperature and humidity 
are the chief factors governing the distribution of life, and that tem- 
l)erature is more p<>tent than humidity. Illustrations of this law have 
been already given in contrasting the humid and arid elements of the 
several zones with the zone elements as limited by temperature, and it 
has been found in the case of mammals and birds that the effects of tem- 
perature, estimated numerically, are more than three times greater than 
the effects of humidity upon genera, and many times greater upon the 
higlier groui)S. 

Authors differ as to the exact period during which temperature exerts 
the greatest influence, but there can be little doubt that for both ani- 
mals and plants it is the season of n^productive activity, and hence 
varies inversely with latitude and altitude. In high arctic latitudes 
this period is very brief, while in the humid tropics it seems to extend 
over nearly if not quite the whole year.*

pp. 26, 27. 



400 GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 

Whether the temperature in quefition is the mean of a certain period 
or the sum of the daily temperatures for that period, or the sum in 
excess of a certain minimum, expressed in degrees of the thermomotric 
scale or in calories, and how to determine the precise beginning and 
ending of this period for each locality, are questions respecting which 
difference of opinion prevails ; and authors are not agreed as to whether 
the temperature should be taken in the sunshine or in the shade, or at a 
certain distance below the surface of the earth. At the same time it has 
been demonstrated by Linsser and others that a definite qnantity of 
heat is recpiired to complete the process of reproduction in a number of 
plants experimented upon, — and nature's laws are not framed for isolated 
cases. This law is taken advantage of by expert gardeners and horti- 
culturists who are able to so regulate the temj)erature of their green- 
houses that they can produce a perfect flower or a ripe fruit on a speci- 
fied day. 

A few species (particularly among plants) are so sensitive to cold 
that they are limited in northward range by the line of killing frost- 
but in the vast majority of cases the winter temperature is" of no conse- 
quence. As I have already shown, " The season of reproduction for 
the plant, as for the animal, is the warm part of the year. After the 
period of reproduction the j)lant withers; after it flowers and fruits 
and matures its seed, it dies down or becomes physiologically inactive. 
And what the i)lant accomplishes in one way the animal accomplishes 
in another. To escape the cold of winter and its consequences, the 
sensitive mammal hibernates; the bird migrates to a more southern 
latitude; the reptile and batrachian dig holes in the mud or sand and 
remain in a torpid condition; the insect sleeps in its cocoon or buries 
itself under leaves or decomposing vegetation ; and none but the har- 
dier forms of life are left to be affected by winter temperatures." [F. 
Am. Fauna, Xo. 3, September, 1890, 26, 27.) 

After temperature and humidity, several subordinate though impor- 
tant factors remain to be considered. Among these maybe mentioned 
the duration and actinic effects of sunlight (governed in part by per- 
centage of cloudiness or fog and by the mechanical purity of the atmos- 
phere). The character of the soil also determines the presence or 
absence of many species.* 

EFFECTS OF HUMIDITY CONTRASTED WITH EFFECTS OF TEMPERA- 
TURE. 

With a few exceptions the Boreal zones, owing to their low tempera- 
tures, precipitate sufficient moisture to support arboreal vegetation, 
and do not possess arid areas. The Transition aiul Sonoran zones, on 
the other hand, naturally fall into two important subdivisions, arid and

they are the subject of another communicatiou upon which the writer is engaged.

humid, as indicated in defining their courses. As a rule, the former 
consist of treeless plains, deserts, and barren mountains, while the lat- 
ter are bountifully clothed with forests. Most of the humbler forms of 
vegetation are different in the two sub-divisions, and differences exist 
also among the mammals, birds, and reptiles, but the great majority 
of these dissimilarities are not of the same kind as those that distin- 
guish one zone from another. Most of them are specific, not generic, 
and the number of distinctive groups of high order is very much less. 
This may be made clear by selecting the distinctive elements of the 
arid Sonoran (which has the largest number of peculiar forms) in com- 
l)arison with those of the humid Sonoran (or Austro-riparian) and con- 
trasting them numerically with the distinctive elements of the Sonoran 
as a whole compared with those of the Boreal as a whole.* Among 
non-pelagic mammals the arid Sonoran has one family {Antilocapridce) 
and only ten genera t not known to inhabit the hnmid Sonoran or Aus- 
tro-riparian, and the latter has but one family {Didelphid(e) and four 
genera DideljjhLs, Oryzomys, Scalo^js. and Nycticejus) not found in the arid 
Sonoran (and the family and one of the genera are intrusions from the 
Tropical region), while thirteen families and twenty-seven genera are 
common to both arid and humid subdivisions.! 

Among birds the arid Sonoran has no family and only twenty-four 
genera not inhabiting the humid Sonoran, and the latter has no family 
and but seven genera not found in the arid, while twelve families and 
fliirty-one genera are common to the two divisions. 

Contrasting the Sonoran as a whole with the Boreal as a whole, it 
appears that there are no less than eight families and forty-one genera 
of mammals and ten families and about one hundred genera of birds 
distinctive of the Sonoran, and six famili(;s and tliirty genera of mam- 
mals and three families and about forty genera of birds distinctive of 
the lioreal zone. In other words, taking mammals and birds together, 
the arid Sonoran has one peculiar family and only thirty-four distinc- 
tive genera, and the humid Sonoran one family and eleven genera (of 
which the family [Didelphidiv) and several of the genera are clearly 
intrusions from the tropical region), while the Sonoran as contrasted 
witli the l^oreal has eiglitcen distinctive families and one liuudred and 
forty-one distinctive genera, and the Boreal has nine distinctive fami- 
lies and seventy distinctive genera. 

Only eiglit families and eiglit genera of mammals are common to the 
IJoreal and Sonoran regions. The common families are: Cervida; 
3Iund(v, Sciuridw, Lejmndce, Mustelidw^ Ganid(e, Felidce, and Soricidw. 



*The intrusive tropical genera are here treated as Sonoran. 

t These genera are : AnUlovapra, Cifiiomys, Oni/chomys, Thomomijs, Dlpodomj/s, T'ero- 
(Ui)H8, Minodipodops, Peroynathux, Bassariscus, and Antrozous.

fauual position.

The comiuuion genera are: i:^itoinySy Sviurus, SciaropterK.s, Spermophi- 
lus, Lepus^ Lutra, Canis, aud Lynx. Several others inhabit limited 
parts of both regions, but are not common to these regions as a whole. 

With the possible exception of the gray wolf, not a single species of 
mammal ranges throughout the Sonoran and Boreal zones, though a 
number are common to the Upper Sonoran and Lower Boreal (Cana- 
dian); and in the case of the wolf it is almost certain that comparison 
of specimens will show the animal of the southern United States and 
Mexico to be perfectly distinct from that of Arctic America. The 
ermine is another species of exceptional though less extensive range, 
if it is really true that the weasel inhabiting the shores and islands of 
the Polar Sea is specifically identical with that found in the more ele- 
vated parts of the Southern States, — an assumption I can not for a 
moment entertain. 

In the case of land birds, eighteen genera are common to the Boreal 
and Sonoran regions. The number of common families is relatively 
large as would be expected from the wide dispersal of most families of 
birds. For instance, the Turdldw or thrushes inhabit North and South 
America, Eurasia, Africa, India, aud Australia,; the Paridiv or titmice 
inhabit !North and South America, Eurasia, Africa, India, Australia, 
and New Zealand; the (7i»c//r7rp or dippers iidiabit North and South 
America, Eurasia, India, and the Austro-Malayan region; the Troglo- 
dytidce or wrens inhabit North and South America, Eurasia, India, 
Africa, and the Austro-Malayan region; the Corvldw or crows, magpies 
and jays, are found in every part of the world, and so on.

The above table shows, so far as the genera of mammals and birds 
are concerned, that the ditterence between the hnmid "Atlantic" or 
"Eastern province" on the one hand, and the arid Great Plains and 
Great Basin on tlie other, is less than one-fourth as great as the differ- 
ence between the Sonoran and Boreal regions. 

These facts, it seems to me, should suffice to establish beyond dispute 
tlie subordinate i)art played by humidity in comparison to temperature, 
and should dispel any lingering doubts that may still haunt the minds 
of conservative naturalists respecting the necessity of abandoning the 
long accepted division of the United States into Atlantic, Central, and 
Pacific provinces. 

REMARKS CONCERNINCI SOME OF WALLACE'S STATEMENTS. 

Wallace, in his great work on geographic distribution, and in sub- 
8e«pient writings on the same subject, greatly underrates the impor- 
tance of temjierature as a factor in determining the distribution of life. 
He lays great stress upon the dissimilarity of the faunas and floras of 
parts of Africa, South America, and Australia lying in the same lati- 
tude, and calls particular attention to the circumstance that although 
the climate may be identical over these widely separated areas, the 
species and higher groups are totally distinct, because the regions have 
been disconnected since early geologic times, — as if these facts were not 
self-evident. On the other hand, in single continental areas where 
there is no break or barrier of any kind between widely different faunal 
zones, he tries to invent some unnatural reason for the differences 
observed, and is reluctant to admit that even in these cases climate or 
climatic conditions can constitute the barriers to dispersion that 
und(mbtedly exist. He says of climate: "'Probably its action is indi- 
rect, and is determined by its influence on vegetation, and by bringing 
diverse groups into comx)etition." 

In another place he states : " Hot countries usually differ widely from 
cold ones in all their organic forms; but the difference is by no means 
constant, nor does it bear any i)roportion to difference of temperature. 
Between frigid Canada and sub-tro})ical Florida there are less marked 
differences m the animal jiroductions than between Florida and Cuba 
or Yucatan, so much more alike in climate and so much nearer together." 
He states further : "The eastern United States possess very peculiar 
and interesting i)lants and animals, the vegetation becoming more lux- 
uriant as we go south, but not altering in essential character; so that 
when we reach the southern extremity of Florida we still find ourselves 
in the midst of oaks, sumacs, magnolias, vines, and other charac- 
teristic forms of the temperate flora: while the birds, insects, and land- 
shells are almost identical with those found farther north. But if we 
now cross over the narrow strait, about 50 miles wide, which separates 
Florida from the Bahama Islands, we find ourselves in a totally dif-

ferent country, surrounded by a vegetation which is essentially tropical 
and generally identical with that of Cuba. The change is most strik- 
ing, because there is no diflterence of climate, of soil, or apparently of 
position, to account for it." {Island Life, 1880, p. 5.) 

Let us examine this statement with some care to see if the facts war- 
rant the assertions and conclusions of the author. But iirst let me 
protest against Wallace's habit of contrasting insular faunas with those 
of continuous land area, in his eftbrts to minimize the effects of climate. 
In most cases the great majority of forms peculiar to an island have no 
means of reaching the nearest continuous land, but in the present 
instance, as will be shown later, the proximity of Cuba and the Bahamas 
to Florida, favored by the direction of the Gulf Stream and the preva- 
lence of hurricanes blowing from the Antilles to the peninsula, have 
enabled a multitude of West Indian plants, insects, birds, and even 
land shells to reach southern Florida, though the breadth of the strait 
is an effective bar to the passage of terrestrial mammals and reptiles. 

Wallace boldly tells us, without attempt at qualification, that "be- 
tween frigid Canada and sub-tropical Florida there are less marked dif- 
ferences in the animal productions than between Florida and Cuba." 
Frigid Canada, in eastern North America, is the home of the Eskimo, 
polar bear, musk oxen, reindeer, lemmings, marmots, beavers, musk-rats, 
porcupines, wolverines, sables, shrews, star-nosed moles, and several 
other mammals, comprising in all twenty genera, not one of which 
occurs in southern Florida.* Florida, on the other hand, is inhabited by 
opossums, harvest-mice, rice-field mice, cotton rats, wood rats, pocket 
gophers, gray foxes, spotted skunks, big-eared bats, and other tbrms, 
representing thirteen genera and five families of mammals that do not 
occur in frigid Canada.t In the case of birds, eastern (Canada has 
twenty-six genera that do not reach Florida, among which may be men- 
tioned ptarmigans, grouse, rough-legged hawks, golden eagles, great 
gray owls, snowy owls, Acadian owls, hawk owls, three- toed woodpeck- 
ers, Canada jays, pine bullfinches, cross-bills, linnets, snow buntings, 
titlarks, winter wrens, kinglets, and stone chats,| while Florida has at

That there are corresponding differences among insects is evident 
from an important paper by Mr. E. A. Schwarz on the Insect Fauna of 
semi-tropical Florida. Mr. Schwarz states : "I have come to the con- 
clusion that it (the serai-tropical f;iuna of Florida) is entirely of West 
Indian origin, and that the region I shall hereafter circumscribe as 
semi-tropical Florida does not contain any endemic forms. In other 
words, the distinctive fauna of southern Florida is a permanent colony 
of West Indian forms, much more numerous in species than it has 
hitherto been supposed, the number in Coleoptera alone amounting, 
according to a very low estimate based upon my collection, to at least 
three hundred si)ecies not yet in our catalogues." {Entomologica 
Americana^ IV, No. 9, 1888.) Since the above was published, Mr. 
Schwarz has had the kindness to inform me that this semi-tropical 
insect fauna of southern Florida comi)rises in all not less than one 
thousiind species of West Indian or Antillean insects (of which about

half are Coleoptera)^ and fifty genera of Coleoptera and Heteroptera 
alone;* hence the total number of genera must )3e very considerable. 

Among the Mollusca, Dr. William H. Dall informs me that twenty 
species or specific types of Antillean land shells are known to inhabit 
southern Florida, representing thirteen genera or sub-genera not found 
farther north.t 

So far as vegetation is concerned the case is even stronger, there 
being upward of three hundred and fifty genera of plants in Florida 
that do not inhabit Canada; and Prof. Charles S. Sargent, in speaking 
of the trees of southern Florida, states: "A group of arborescent 
species of West Indian origin occupies the narrow strip of coast and 
islands of southern Florida. - - - This semitropical forest belt 
reaches Cape Malabar on the east coast and the shores of Tampa Bay 
on the west coast. - - - The species of which it is composed here 
reach the extreme northern limit of their distribution; they are gener- 
ally small, stunted, and of comparatively little value. Certain species 
however attain respectable proportions: the mahogany, the mastic, 
the royal palm, the mangrove, the sea grape, the Jamaica dog-wood, 
the manchineel, and other species here become considerable and impor- 
tant trees." (Forests of North America, Tenth Census, 1884, p. 6.) 

From what has been said, it appears not only that Wallace's state- 
ment that " between frigid Canada and sub-tropical Florida there are 
less marked differences in the animal productions than between Florida 
and Cuba " is wholly incorrect, but that there exists in Florida a well- 
marked sub-tropical fauna and flora consisting in the main (except in 
the case of terrestrial mammals and reptiles which could not reach it) 
of genera, and largely of species, identical with those of Cuba. This 
being the case, is it not fair to turn the tables and ask Wallace what 
constitutes the barrier that so effectually holds back hundreds of genera 
and a multitude of species of Antillean or tropical American plants, 
insects, land mollusks, and birds now inhabiting sub-tropical Florida"? 

* Mr. Schwarz Las kindly given me the following list of families of Central 
American Coleoptera, indicating the number of genera in each family known to 
inhabit semitropical Florida, but not found elsewhere in North America : Carahida,

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 407 

The deep arm of ocefiii between Floiida and Cuba or the Bahamas has 
proved iueiiectual in checking their dispersions. What is the more 
potent barrier tliat prevents their northward spread along the continu- 
ous hind of the ijeninsulaf The answer is summed up in tlie single 
word climate. The tem]»erature of tlie period of growth and reproduc- 
tion in the northern iJarts of Cuba and the Bahamas is the same as in 
snb-troi»ical Florida, but to the northward it falls oft' rapidly. 

Kesi)ecting Wallace's statement that the difterence between the 
faunas and floras of hot and cold countries "is by no means constant," 
and does not bear " any propcu-tion to difference of temijerature," it 
need only be said that no phenomenon of nature is more constant; and 
that the differences observed depend directly upon temperature. Presi- 
dent D. S. Jordan has said: "In many groui)S, anatomical characters 
are not more i^rofound or of longer standing than are the adai)tations 
toheat and cold. " {Popular Science Monthly, Aug., 1890, xxxvii, p. 506.) 

That " life is distributed in circum-polar zones, which conform with 
the climatic zones, though not always with the parallels of the geog- 
rapher 'Ms a law recognized by Humboldt, Wagner, Agassiz, Dana, 
De Candolle, Allen, and nearly all writers on distribution except 
Wallace. This law does not imply that the same species, genera, or 
higher groups recur under the same degree of heat in disconnected 
land areas — a manifest impossibility, — but that well-marked zones of 
animal and plant life are encountered in all parts of the earth in pass- 
ing from the poles to the tropics; that they owe their existence to con- 
stant differences of temperature, and that in continuous land areas 
each zone may be traced completely across such areas (from ocean to 
ocean in those of continental magnitude), following the windings of the 
belts of equal temperature during the period of reproductive activity. 

Wallace speaks thus of this law as formulated by Allen: "The 
author (J, A. Allen) continually refers to the ' law of the distribution 
of life in circum-polar zones,' as if it were one generally accepted and 
that admits of no dispute. But this supposed ' law ' only applies to the 
smallest detail of distribution — to the range and increasing or decreas- 
ing numbers of species as we pass from north to south, or the reverse; 
while it has little bearing on the great features of zoological geogra- 
pliy — the limitations of groups of genera and families to certain areas." 
[deofj. T>iftt. of Animah, 1870, vol. i, p. 67.) Mr. Allen has already 
]>ointed out the weakness of this criticism {Bull. U. S. Geol. und Geog. 
tSurrey Terr., May, 1878, vol. IV, No. 2, 326), and I would like to add a 
word respecting the extraordinary statement that circum-polar distri- 
bution affects species only, having "little bearing" on the "Innitatious 
of groups of genera and families." In refutation of this fallacy it is 
hardly necessary to do more than call attention to the circumstance 
tlnit the trans-continental Soiunan region of North America is distin- 
guished from the Boreal by the possession of seven families and thirty- 



408 GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 

four genera of mammals alone,* and the North American Tropical from 
the Sonoran by ten families and upwards of tifty genera; while the 
American Boreal differs from the Eurasian Boreal l>y the possession of 
but a single family and only eight genera. 

MOUNTAINS AS BAREIERS TO DISPERSION. 

Wallace makes the surprising statement that on the two sides of the 
Rocky mountains in America " almost all the mammalia, birds, and 
insects are of distinct species,"t — a statement that is wholly untrue, as 
has been long known to American naturalists. In another place he 
makes the general statement that mountains, " when rising to a great 
height in unbroken ranges, form an impassable barrier to many groups." 
No instance of this kind is known in North America. Even in the high 
Sierra in California nearly all of the families, genera, and species occur 
on the east slope as well as on the west, notwithstanding the great alti- 
tude this lofty range maintains for a consideral)le distance.^ The expla- 
nation of the similarity or identity of the species on the two sides of all 
our mountain systems is that similar or identical climatic zones occur 
on both sides, between which avenues of communication exist or have 
existed by means of passes, either through the ranges themselves or at 
one end or the other. In their continuity, however, lofty mountain 
ranges do act as barriers to the spread of species from lower levels, but 
they do so indirectly by their effects upon climate — by interposing an 
arctic zone in which the species of lower latitudes can not live. On the 
other hand, this same arctic-alpine climate enables many polar sijecies 
to thrive in regions two or three thousand miles south of their normal 
continental homes. 

The great Himalaya has little or no influence in bringing about the 
really enormous differences that exist between the faunas and floras of 
the plains on its two sides, for these dissimilarities are due primarily to 
the great difference of temperature resulting from unequal base level, 
the Thibetan plateau on the north being several thousand feet higher 
than the plain on the south. 

THE SO-CALLED EASTERN, CENTRAL, AND WESTERN PROVINCES AND 
THE EVIDENCE ON WHICH THEY ARE BASED. 

Wallace, in common with most recent writers, divides the United 
States into eastern, central, or Rocky mountain, and Pacific or Cali- 

* These genera'are : Didelphis, Dicotyles, Cariacus, Antilocapra, Cynomys, Beithrodon- 
tomys, Onyohomys, Oryzomys, Siymodon, Neotoma, Geomys, Thomomys, Dipodomys, 
Perodipus, Microdipodops, Perof/nathus, Heteromys, Fells, Urocyon, Procyon, Bassarisciis, 
Taridea, Conepatus, Mephitis, Spiloyale, NoUosorex, Scalops, Corynorldnns, Enderma, 
Aiilrozous, Nycticejus, Molossus, N'ycthiomous, and Otopterus. Five of these genera 
have each a species reaching a short distance into tlie soutliern edge of the Boreal 
region, namely, Cariacus, Neotoma, Felis, Procyo)i, and MejMtis.

tion of 3,100 to 4,600 meters (12,000 to 15,000 feet).

forniau "sub-regions.'" He admits that the eastern division is cliaraeter- 
ized ))y but a single mammalian genus, namely, the star-nosed mole 
{CoiKh/Iura). 

In characterizing- the so-called central or Rocky mountain sub-re- 
gion, he states that the prong-horned antelope, the mountain goat, the 
the mountain slice]), and the piairie dog are peculiar to it, forgetting 
that tlie antelope ranges from the Mexican jdateau northward over the 
(xrent plains and Great basin, and westward over much of California; 
that tlie mountain goat inh'^l)its British Columbia and the Cascade 
range as well as the liocky mountains; that the mountain sheep is 
common in the High Sierra in California and ranges northward to the 
A let ic Circle in Alaska; lejiving the prairie dog as the (mly one con- 
hne<l to the region. 

The I'acilic or " Californian sub-region " he defines as "the compar- 
atively uarroM' strij) of c(mntry between the Sierra Nevada and the 
Pacific. To the north it may include Vancouver's Island and the 
southern part of British Columbia." Under the head of the mammalia 
of this area, he enumerates eight genera as " not found in any other 
])art of the Xear(*tic region," namely, Miwrotiis^ Aiifrozous, Urotrichus, 
Xeofiorex, Bassaris, Unhi/dra, A[ornn</a, and Haploodon. A more erro- 
neous statement could hardly be made. Of the two pelagic genera, 
Mirninga and I'Jnhf/dra [= Lata.r J, the former does not enter the region 
at all and the latter barely reaches it; while of the non-pelagic genera 
three, Macrotus [= Otopteru.s], Antrozous, and Bassaris [= Bassa- 
risci(.s]j range over the Sonoran region from Texas and the Mexican 
plateau across Xew IVIexico, Arizona, and parts of southern Nevada 
and Califoiiiia, and the sub-genus Neosorex occurs over pretty much 
the whole of Boreal America from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The 
two remaining genera only are confined to the Californian division, 
namely. Urotrichu.s [= Ifeurotrichufi] and Haploodon [=A2)lodo)itia\. 
Both are isolated types, inhabiting the Pacific coast country from 
northern California to British Columbia (the latter having no near rela- 
ti\-e in any i)art of the world, the former closely related to genera now 
living in eastern Asia). 

Hence it ai)pears, so far as the mammalia are concerned, that these 
three supposed primary subdivisions of North America rest upon a 
misconception of fact, the Californian division possessing two peculiar 
genera, and the eastern and central divisions but a single peculiar 
genus each, — a <puintity of difference it would be absurd to recognize 
as of sufl^icient weight to warrant the erection of zoo- geographical 
divisions. " 

In a communication already referred to {N'orth American Fauna, No. 
3, September, 1890) I stated the conclusion that the commonly accepted 
division of the United States into eastern, middle, and Avestern prov- 
inces had no existence in nature, and that "the whole of extra-tropical 



410 GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 

North America (the Nearctic region of Sclater and Wallace) consists of 
but two primary life regions ; a boreal region, which is circumpolar, 
and a Sonoran or Mexican table-land region, which is unique." The 
so-called eastern province is mainly of Sonoran derivation, comprising 
the humid divisions of the Lower Sonoran and Upper Sonoran zones 
( Austro-riparian and Carolinian faunas), and of the transition or neutral 
belt, commonly known among ornithologists as the Alleghanian fauna. 
It contains also a southward extension of the boreal region along the 
Appalachian mountain system, mainly in the form of isolated islands. 

The so-called central region in like manner is made up of a southward 
extension of the boreal region along the Rocky mountain plateau, inclosed 
between two northward prolongations of the arid Sonoran, the one 
occupying the Great x)lains, the other the Great basin. 

The so-called Pacific or western province consists of a southward 
extension of the boreal region, which finally bifurcates, sending a long 
arm south over the Cascade range and the Sierra Nevada, and a sec- 
ondary and shorter arm along the Pacific coast, north of San Francisco, 
together with a Sonoran element, which covers nearly the whole south- 
ern part of the state, and reaches north in the San Joaquin and Sacra- 
mento valleys. 

PAL^ARCTIC AND NEARCTIC REGIONS. 

It is no part of the purpose of the present address to discuss the 
distribution of life outside of our own continent, but it so happens 
that the Boreal element in America resembles that of Eurasia so closely 
that in the judgment of many eminent authorities the two constitute 
but a single primary region, a view in which I heartily concur. This 
arrangement is antagonistic to that proposed by Sclater * in 1857, and 
adopted with slight modification by Wallace. Sclater considers the 
whole of extra-tropical North America as constituting a single region, 
upon which he bestowed the name Ifearctic, in contradistinction to the 
corresponding part of Eurasia, which he named Palcearctic, believing 
the two to be distinct primary regions. 

Wallace, the great champion of Sclater's Palcearctic and Nearctic 
regions, says of the former in his most recent work on geographic dis- 
tribution: " Taking first the mammalia, we find this region is distin- 
guished by its possession of the entire family of Talpida' or Moles, con- 
sisting of 8 genera and 16 species, all of which are confined to it, except 
one, which is found in northwest America, and two which extend to 
Assam and Formosa." {Island Life, 1880, 41.) How he c.ould have 
made such an erroneous statement is hard to understand, in view of 
the well known fact that 3 genera of moles inhabit eastern North 
America and 2 the Pacific coast region; and it is the more strange 

* Journ. Linn. Soc. (Zool.) (for 1857), 1858, ri, 130-145; and again, with some altera- 
tions, in Ibis, 1891, sixth series, iii, 514-557. 



GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 411 

siuce on another page of the same work he states that there are three 
peculiar genera of moles in North America.* 

He states further: ''Among carnivorous animals the lynxes (nine 
species) and the badgers (two species) are peculiar to it [the Paloearctic 
region] in the old world, while in the new the lynxes are found only in 
the colder regions of North America" {Ishotd Life, 18<S0, 41), thus 
imi)lying that there are no badgers in North America, and ignoring the 
presence of lynxes all along the southern border of the United States 
from Florida and Texas to southern California. Continuing, he men- 
tions a number of groups which, he says, "have only a few sj^ecies else- 
where." Among these are the "voles, dormice, and pikas." Pikas 
inhabit the mountains of western Canada and range south in the Cas- 
cades and High Sierra to southern California, and in the Kocky Moun- 
tains to Colorado. They have been reported also from the high moun- 
tains of Lower California in Mexico. The group of voles or Arvicolinfe, 
exclusive of the lenunings, is represented in Boreal North America by 
not less than four genera, five sub-genera, and nearly fifty species. It 
is only fair to add, however, that some of these have been described 
since Wallace's book was written. 

"The Nearctic region is so similar to the Paliearctic in position and 
climate,'' he admits, " and the two so closely approach each other at 
Bering Strait that we can not wonder at their being a certain am(mnt 
of similarity between them, — a similarity which some naturalists have 
so far over-estimated as to think that the two regions ought to be united." 
After enumerating a number of mammals common to the two he goes 
onto say: " AVe undoubtedly find a very close resemblance between 
the two regions, and if tbis were all, we should have great difficulty in 
separating them. But along with these we find another set of mam- 
mals, not quite so conspicuous but nevertheless very important. We 
have first, three peculiar genera of moles, one of which, the star-nosed 
mole, is a most extraordinary creature, quite unlike anything else. 
Then there are three genera of the weasel family, including the well- 
known skunk {Me2)]iitis), all quite difterent from eastern forms. Then 
we come to a peculiar family of carnivora, the raccoons, very distinct 
from anything in Europe or Asia : and in the Kocky INIountains we find 
the i)rong-horne(l antelope {Aiitilocaprd) and the mountain goat of the 
trappers (Aplocerus [ = Mazama]), both peculiar genera. Coming to 
the rodents, we find that the mice of America ditfer in some dental 
l)cciiliarities from those of the rest of the world, and thus form several 

* In his earlier work he says: " Condi/lura (one species), the star-nosed mole, in- 
habits eastern North America from Nova Scotia to Pennsylvania; t^capaiius (two 
species) ranges across fmm New York to Sau Francisco; Svalojjs (three species), the 
shrew moles, range from Mexico to the Great Lakes. - - - Prw/rJc/(HS is a shrew- 
like mole whicl\^iuhahits Japan, and a second species has been discovered in the 
mountains of British Columbia." (Geog. Dist. of Animals, 1876, ii, 190.) 



412 GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA.. 

distinct genera; the jumping mouse {Xapus [=ZapHs]) is a peculiar 
form of the jerboa family; and then we come to the pouched rats {Geo- 
myidw), a very curious ftimily consisting of four genera and nineteen 
species, peculiar to North America, though not confined to the Nearc- 
tic region. The prairie dogs {Cynomys), the tree porcupine {JEretMzon), 
the curious sewellel {Haploodon [=Aplodontia]), and the opossum 
{DidelpJm) complete the list of peculiar mammalia which distinguish 
the northern region of the New World from that of the Old." {Island 
Life, p. 48.) 

As already shown in an earlier part of the present essay, most of 
these genera and several of the families belong to the austral or 
Sonoran region and have no place in the Boreal fauna — tlie only one 
that can be compared with the fauna of northern Eurasia. As a mat- 
ter of fact, eighty-one genera of non-pelagic mammals are now recog- 
nized in "extra-tropical "North America — the so-called Nearctic region. 
Of this number forty-one are found in no other part of the world.* 
These genera are enumerated in the following table, which brings out 
the important fact that no less than thirty-two, or 78 per cent, are of 
Sonoran or austral origin, while only nine, or 22 per cent, are of Boreal 
origin. Of these nine genera now confined to North America, Ovihos 
inhabited polar Eurasia in Pleistocene times; Neiu-otnehuH is not recog- 
nized by Flower and Lydekker as more than sub-generically separable 
from Urotrichus of Japan, and Synaptomys is not known except from 
the Transition zone of the United States and is here classed as Boreal 
because of its close relationship to the trans-continental Boreal genus 
Myodes. Omitting these three, Boreal North America has but six 
genera of mammals not known from Boreal Eurasia.

On the other hand, out of the thirty-one Boreal genera of North Ameri- 
can mammals the following, twenty-four genera or 77 per cent, are com- 
mon to Boreal America and Boreal Eurasia :

In addition to the foregoing genera, which are clearly of Boreal ori-

mon to the two continents :

Felis. 


Vespertilio. 


Sciurns. 


Canis. 


Lynx. 


Plecotus.t 


Sperniophihis. 


Lutra. 


Vesperugo. 


Nyctinomus. 



Most of these genera are known to be of great antiquity, their remains 
having been found in Miocene strata, and it is probable that the others 
belong to the same cat(?gory, but have thus far escaped detection, owing 
to their very small size. All of them attain their maximum development 
and numbers in the Sonoran region in America and the analogue of the 
Sonoran in Eurasia; but by reason of the great length of time that has 
elapsed since they came into existence some of their representatives 
have become acclimated to a wide range of climatic conditions. 

Dr. John L. Le Conte, in his report on tlie Coleoptera of Lake Supe- 
rior, said: "Tlie entomologist can not fail to be struck with two very 
remarkable characters displayed by the insect fauna of these northern 
regions. First, the entire absence of all those groups which a^ra peculiar 
to the American continent [i. e., kSonoran and Tropical groups]. - - - 
The few new genera which I have ventured to establish are not to be 
regarded as exceptions. They are all closely allied to European forms, 
and by no means members of gioups exclusively American. 

''• Secondly, the deficiency caused by the disappearance of character- 
istic forms is obviated by a large increase of the members of genera 
feebly represented in the more temperate regions, and also by the intro- 
duction of many genera heretofore regarded as confined to the northern 
part of Europe and Asia. Among these latter are many species which 
can be distinguished from their foreign analogues only by the most 
careful examination. This parallelism is sometimes most exact, run- 

^ As stated above, Flower and Lydokker do not recognize tbe American animal as 
generioally distinct from rrotrirhus. While I agree with Dobson in according it 
generic rank, it is convenient, in studying the origin of groups, to bring together 
such closely related types. 

t The American species of Plecotus are separated generally by Dr. Harrison Allen 
under the name Corynorhinus, which is adopted by the writer. The more compre- 
hensive name Plecotus is here used for the reason just stated under Urotrichua. 



414 GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 

ning uot merely tlirougli the genera, but even through the respective 
species of which they are composed." {Lake Superior, 1850, 239, 240.) 

W. F. Kirby, in a paper "^^On tlie Geographical Distribution of the 
Diurnal Lepidoptera as compared with that of Birds," states: '' Had I 
been dealing with Lepidoptera only, I would certainly have united Dr. 
Sclater's 'PahTarctic region ' and 'Nearctic region;' for altlumgh the 
species of North American E,hox)alocera are seldom identical with those 
of northern Asia and Europe, still the genera are the same with scarcely 
an exception, excej)t a few representatives of South American genera, 
which have no more right to be considered Nearctic species than the 
similar chance representatives of African forms in north Africa or 
southwest Europe, or of Indian forms in southeast Europe have to be 
considered PaltBarctic species." {Journ. Linnean Soc, Londoti, Zool., 
1873, 432.) 

It now becomes evident that the so-called Palicarctic and Nearctic 
regions are the result, in each case, of confounding and combining two 
wholly distinct regions — the Boreal with the Sonoran in America and the 
Boreal with the analogue of the Sonoran in Eurasia. Eliminating these 
austral elements as wholly foreign to the region to which they have been 
so persistently attached, there remains a single great circum-polar 
Boreal region characterized by a remarkably homogeneous fauna, cover- 
ing the northern parts of America and Eurasia. 

Cope has shown that the chief differences between Boreal America 
and Boreal Eurasia are found among the fishes and batrachians, — ani- 
mals living wholly or in part in water. Now, it can not be insisted too 
strongly that while the chief factor in the distribution of aipiatic animals 
and plants is temperature, as has been long acknowledged, yet from 
the very nature of the case the resulting life regions nuist be different, 
the one sui)plementing or being the complement of the other; for, Avater 
being the medium in which the species live, the bodies of water with 
their prolongations and extensions, as bays, rivers, and lakes, must be 
studied as entities, just as we study a continent with its peninsulas and 
outlying islands, the means of access to a given body of water being 
the principal factor in determining the water area to which its aquatic 
life belongs. And it should be remarked that aquatic mammals (as 
seals and cetaceans), and aquatic birds (as ducks and gulls), conform 
in the main to the laws and areas of aquatic distribution, and should 
not be taken into account in studying the distribution of terrestrial 
forms of life. 

Gill has said with much truth: '' There appears to be a total want of 
<;orrelatiou between the inland and marine faunas, and a positive in- 
congruity, and even contrast, between the two." {Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., 
1884, II, 32.) 



GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE IN NORTH AMERICA. 415 

PRINCIPLES ON WHICH BIO-GEOGEAPHIC REGIONS SHOULD BE ES* 

TABLISHED. 

Wallace, in writing of the principles on which zoological regions 
should be tV)riue(l, expresses the opinion that " convenience, intelligi- 
bility, and custom should largely guide us." But I quite agree with 
America's most distinguished and philosophic writer on distribution, 
])r. J. A. Allen, that in marking off the life regions and sub-regious of 
the earth, truth should not be sacrificed to convenience; and I see no 
reason why a homogeneous circum-polar fauna of great geographic 
extent should be split up into primarj^egions possessing comparatively 
few peculiar types simply because a water separation happens to exist 
in the present geologic period; nor is it evident why one of the re- 
sulting feeble divisions should be granted higher rank than a region of 
much less geographic extent comprising several times as many peculiar 
types. Uence the divisions here recognized, and the rank assigned 
them, are based as far as possibk'. upon the relative numbers of distinc- 
tive types of mammals, birds, reptiles, and i)lants they contain, with 
due reference to the steady nuiltiiilication of si)ecies, genera, and higher 
groups from the poles toward the tropics. Mammals have been chiefly 
used as illustrations because they answer the purpose better than any 
other single group, and because it is clearly imi^ossible in a brief essay 
of this character to enumerate such a multitude of forms as would be 
necessary were equal consideration accorded to each class. 



THE CORBII^ GAME TAEK.* 



By John K. Speaks. 



Here is an 'nterestiug study in Imuiaii nature; a picture of the iticep- 
tiou and growth of an enterprise of great moment to the naturalist and 
the sportsman, and of interest to everyone. Six years ago a friend 
presented to Austin Corbin, the well-known railroad man, a few young 
deer. Mr Corbin accepted them, and having a great country seat that 
included many acres of woods as well as cleared fields out on Long 
Island, he caused a part of tlie woods to be suitably fenced, and turned 
the deer into the iuclosure. Mr. Corbin, at that time, was neither a 
sportsman nor a naturalist, in the sense in which these terms are gen- 
erally understood. He had no especial interest in wild animals of any 
kind. iSrevertheless, as a lad he had lived on a farm in New Hampshire, 
among the foothills of the White Mountains, and liad trapped wood- 
chucks, and shot partridges and chased foxes, and the good healthy 
delights of tliose days lingered in his memory. Small wonder then that 
tlie gentle pets his friend had given to him won their way into his afiec- 
tions from the moment they became his. It was a new pleasure — some- 
thing he had never known before, — to go and watch their graceful 
motions and gaze upon the beauty of their forms. Moreover, Mr. Corbin 
had a son, and Austin junior was as much delighted with the i)ets as 
his father. 

There was ample room on the Long Island farm for more than the 
few deer, and the Corbins decided that more should be had. This led 
to the examination of sundry books on the subject of deer culture, if one 
may use tlie term, books like Judge Caton's, for instance, wiiile the 
Forest and Stream, and other periodicals were necessarily read regu- 
Uirly. Certainly the love of nature grows with what it feeds ui>on, if 
any emotion of the heart does. If deer could be kept, why not deer's 
cousins, the elk, the moose, the antelope, and the buffalo, — especially 
the buflalo?

418 THE CORBIN GAME PARK. 

Mr. Corbin liad lived in Iowa when a young man, and in the days 
Avhen the herds of buffalo on the plains of Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas 
numbered untold thousands. It was a great pity that such noble ani- 
mals were likely to become extinct, and the Corbins determined to join 
in the effort to perpetuate the species. They had begun with a few 
deer, and they added the elk, the antelope, and the buffalo, and then 
it became apparent that the Long Island estate was too small for the 
proper care of these animals, or at least for the care which the owners 
desired to give them. 

It is to be particularly noticed that the Long Island estate was not 
suited to the sort of care that the Corbins wished the animals to have. 
From caring for the few pets had grown the desire to rear herds of 
these animals under such conditions of freedom as would leave them 
with all their natural characteristics. A pet deer was beautiful, but 
it was not the deer of the wild woods after all. A pure bred buffalo 
in a barn-yard was in fact a buffalo, but he was too much like a Dur- 
ham bull to be perfectly satisfactory. On the Long Island farm the 
animals coidd scarcely become anything more than pets. 

So the thoughts of the elder Corbin went back to the days of his 
youth and the foothills of the White Mountains. As most of our read- 
ers know, there is plenty of land in New Hampshire that is just as 
wild now as it was when Hudson first looked on the ground where the 
statue of liberty now stands. There was a deal of it in Sullivan County, 
perhax^s not the wildest in the State, but certainly a plenty of unbroken 
forest that covered hills and valleys and surrounded little lakes, for- 
ests of birch and beech, and maple and pine, and spruce and hemlock, 
and balsam, — forests beautiful and fragrant enough to give a city man 
the heartache w^hen he thinks of them. 

Mr. Corbin determined to buy from 20,000 to 30,000 acres of these 
hills and valleys and there establish a paik for his new-found four- 
footed friends in which they would find the conditions as near those as 
possible to which they were best suited. Mr. Corbin eventually got 
22,000 acres in one tract. 

The next thing was to fence it, and only those who have tried build- 
ing elk- tight fences can appreciate the job. Here was a tract of over 
35 square miles of land to inclose. They started out with a wire net 6 
feet high, secured to stout posts 10 feet apart. Above the net they 
strung ten lines of barbed wire, and tliat made a right good fence. 
But when 18 miles had been erected they abandoned the wire net and 
used barbed wire only for the rest of the way. That was cheaper and 
just as good. It is not uninteresting to note that the fencing cost 
$74,000. 

In all, nine gates are to be placed in this fence, with a keeper's lodge 
at each gate, something made necessary by the presence in every com- 
munity of the skulking lout who will steal or destroy the property of 
the well-to-do, and especially such property as this fence will inclose. 



THE CORBIN GAME PARK. 419 

Mr. forbin is sure liis i)ark will not in any way interfere with the 
rights of legitiuiate sportsmen. 

Here is this tract of woodland with only enough cleared land on it 
to afford meadoAvs over which the animals would like to wander at 
times, are gathered 25 butfahj, 00 elk, over 70 deer, half a dozen each 
of caribou and antelope, 18 wild boars imported from Germany, and an 
unknown number of moose, — perhaps a aozen. He had 4 reindeer 
brought from Labrador, but all died. Tie expects to have a community 
of beavers, for the lakes and streams of the i^ark are admirably adapted 
for these beautiful animals. 

Quite as interesting as any description of the ])ark and its inhabit- 
ants is the story of the gathering of the specimens. It is too long to 
tell in full, but room remains for enough. The agent employed to 
gather a large part of tlu? animals from Canada was Thomas H. Kyan, 
who has served Mr. Corbin in a number of capacities for tbe past twelve 
years. Along in October last Mr. Kyan was commissioned to go to 
Canada to see what could be done about getting "any wild animals 
there except bears, panthers, wolves, and foxes." 

At Sherbrooke he met a friendly newspaper man who said one Dan. 
Ball, of Megantic, knew all about the deer of that country, and so to 
]\legantic i)osted Mr. Ryan. He met Ball and found him able and 
willing to get the <leer. 

Mr. Ryan went 50 miles to North Bay, 200 miles west, and from there 
to ^lattawa, on the verge of a region where moose abound, deer are 
plentilul, and beaver possible to obtain alive. A cimtract was made 
with a trapper, whose name Mr. Ryan does not wish to mention, for a 
STipjdy of all these animals — at least tAventy of each if that number be 
possi])le. 

Meantime Dan I5all had gone to work at Megantic by selecting a few 
friends and looking over the woods to see where the deer were yard- 
ing. Along in December the snow became 5 feet deep in the woods, 
and Dan knew of one yard where at least 300 deer were gathered 
together. 

Then he and six others went on snowshoes, with buckskin thongs, 
and one gun loaded with powder only. Locating a bunch of deer in a 
thicket, six of the men crept up as near as possible to the leeward with- 
out alarming them. Then the seventh came tearing down with the 
wind and with a wild yell and the discharge of the gun scattered the 
bunch like a Hock (piails before a cur pup. Some ot the fleeing beauties 
])lumped into the snow, that was so deep and so fluffy that they sank 
out of siglit at the first stiuggle, nor could they escape till Dan and 
his friends kindly lent a hand. In all a dozen were captured tlius, and 
with legs bound with soft leather thongs were carried to an old shanty 
in the woods some distance from Megantic. 

In -January ^Ir. Uyan went away to bring the deer to the park in 
New Hampshire, ^legantic is on the Canadian Pacific road. A box 



420 THE CORBIN GAME PARK. 

car was sent to a siding formerly nsed by a Inniber mill, and there car- 
peted with hay, straw, and a good snpply of browse. The ends were 
then partitioned oft' from the space between the doors by means of 
poles, and within the spaces thus foruied the deer were placed, being 
simply lifted in. They had been kept in the meantime in tlie old mill 
unbound. 

With Dan Ball to look after and especially to water the deer the car 
was hauled to Newport, Vt., the location of the United States customs 
office. 

The deer were passed dutyfree, and were sent on to Newport, N. H., 
by the way of Concord, nearly 100 miles farther than necessary. The 
extra ride proved disastrous, for one deer died en route, and two after 
arrival. The nine are now as well and frisky as when in their native 
forests. 

The buftalo in the park came originally from Montana, but were 
purchased of a Minnesota man. The moose, elk, and caribou came 
from Minnesota also, and were captured along the Canadian border. 

Among the interesting experiences in the transportation of the 
animals for this park may be mentioned these: Moose have been car- 
ried 2,000 miles in four days without apparent injury. The last con- 
signment included sixteen moose, three deer, and one caribou. All 
arrived in good condition, but eight moose died afterwards, because, it 
is thought, of the change in their diet or water, or both. On one 
occasion when thirty deer were en route, a collision with another train 
killed twenty-two of them outright, and four more died afterwards. 

It is noticed that the largest deer most easily succumb to railroad 
travel. None of the animals ever eat or sleep while the car is in 
motion. On a side track they will eat a little. There seems to be 
more danger of their suffering from heat in a l)Ox car than from cold, 
but the worst trouble is in the jerking to and fro of the car when the 
train is stopping or starting. They are fed barley, corn, bran, and 
hay. In the woods they are expected to live as they would naturally, 
but places will be established where feed will be left for them, so that 
none shall lack. 

Beginning with a few pet deer in a paddock, the Corbins now have 
a private zoological garden where, if at any such place in the world, 
the animals on hand can be seen and studied under natural conditions. 
What it will be in the future Mr. Corbin can not say, but that he will, 
as frtst as convenient to do so, add all the animals of the world that 
can live there harmoniously need not be doubted. His outlay up to 
the completing of the park is not far from $400,000. Some of his 
friends say he is likely to spend half as much more on it and make of 
it a place to fairly delight the naturnlist. They say that the work of 
Judge Caton will be sui^plemented and added to, by that to be done at 
the Corbin park, to the great benefit of all investigators into the habits 
of wild animals. 



THE COKBIN GAME PARK. 421 

II. 

Ill the issue of March 12, 1891, we published a very interesting ac- 
count of Mr. Austin Corbiii's game park in Xevr Hampshire, telling 
how Mr. Corbin was led into tlie enterprise, and also giving an account 
of how tlie ftrst animals used in stocking the park were secured. Since 
then we have obtained tlie following information of the present state 
of attairs in the park, chietly in relation to the breeding of the animals 
in their new environment — it can hardly be called captivity, when 
the animals are at liberty to wander at their own sweet will over 28,000 
acres of woodland, hill, and valley. 

In this respect of breeding the ])ark has proved a great success. All 
the animals seem to take kindly to their new surroundings, and 
already their numbers are being materially increased by births. Of 
the twenty-two buffalo which were put in about a year ago, eight of 
the cows are now in calf, and two yoUng have been added to the herd. 
The elk, which bred to a limited extent on Mr. Corbin's Long Island 
estate, have found their mountainous New Hampshire home more to 
their liking, and have already increased 50 per cent. ISText to the elk 
the most accurate count has been kept of the moose, who, unlike their 
gregarious brethren, go in })airs during the rutting season. It was at 
tirst feared that these unusually retiring animals would not breed in 
the j)ark, but it has been ascertained that six of the cows are now with 
calf. There are upward of sixty moose in the park and they make a 
much wider range in travelling than the elk, which keep pretty well to 
one locality where there is considerable brush and small growth, and 
no doubt abundant feed. 

The agent who was instrumental in securing for Mr. Corbin the first 
denizens of the park has the head of a particularly fine moose in his 
possession. The unmounted head weighed 300 pounds, and the horns, 
which show eleven points, have a span of about 5 feet. This head was 
bought of an Indian in Mattawa, and is said to be the last green head 
taken out of Ontario previous to the passing of the law forbidding the 
killing of moose. 

To come baek to figures, the wild boars, imported from Germany 
September a year ago, ha\e been seen a number of times lately. They 
have evidently gained by natural increase, and must be quick trav- 
ellers, as three or four herds have been reported in diiferent localities 
at nearly the same time by the game-keepers. The old animals have 
grown considerably, and are wonderfidly fleet of foot, for unlike their 
cousin, the domestic hog, they do not fatten. As far as can be ascer- 
tained, all the other animals, including the several varieties of deer, 
have multiplied considerably, and their change of habitat and the fact 
that the big fence occasionally checks their extended wanderings, does 
not seem to cast any blight on the even tenor of their lives. 

lnclude<l in the park are two ponds of 20 and 30 acres, respectively, 
and probably lOO miles of streams. The ponds were cleaned out last 



422

year and many eels and other varieties of cannibalistic fish destroyed, 
and now the ponds and streams are all stocked with trout. 

While in London, two years since, Mr. Corbin purchased 20,000 haw- 
thorn trees. Four thousand of these have been planted this spring. 

They are for the pur- 
pose of forming a hedge 
strong enough to pre- 
vent the buffalo and 
other large animals from 
getting out. This tree, 
of which there are two 
varieties, the white and 
black, is used very ex- 
tensively for inclosing 
the game parks of Eng- 
land and France. It 
grows from 8 to 10 feet 
in height, and is the 
toughest and strongest 
tree that can be found, 
making, with its inter- 
locking and elastic 
branches, a hedge that 
would resist a battering 
ram. The trees are 
being ])lanted inside the 
big fence of barbed and 
woven wire, and will 
eventually take its place 
when the latter becomes 
weakened through rust 
and exposure. 

There will be no hunt- 
ing in the park at pres- 
ent, though in future 
years, when the animals 
have multiplied beyond 
the resources of their do- 
main, it is possible that 
Mr. Corbin may adopt 
this means of thinning 
them out. It is sufficient to say that the park is not designed for hunt- 
ing. Similarly, it is not primarily intended for scientific research into 
the habits, breeding, etc., of the various animals, though it is safe to 
say that it Avould yield rich returns in this direction.

THE CORBIN GAME PARK. 423 

The development of Mr. Corbiii's game park enterprise is being 
watched with decided interest by sportsmen and natnralists. It hap- 
pens that tlic present artich^ has been prepared Just in time to supply 
additional information on the subject sought by the directors of the 
new National Zoological (xarden in Washington. Success in New 
Hami)shire, when it sliall have been demonstrated beyond the perad- 
venture of a doubt, will prompt similar enterjirises in other parts of 
the country. While much interest is felt iu the introduction of foreign 
species, Americans are naturally most concerned with the successful 
conservation of bands of .Vmerican big game, the elk and the antelope 
and the buffalo. Of the unfamiliar picture these great animals present, 
grouped on a New Hampshire hilltoi), our cut, from a photograph, 
gives excellent illustr;ition. May tlu^se wild creatures yet feed <»n a 
thousand hills of the New England and otlier Eastern States, and on 
the game [)reserves of the west ! 

Besides the great New Hampshire park, Mr. Corbin has two other 
game preserves. On his Long Islatul estate he now has 21 elk and 
about 18 deer, and at Manhattan Beacli he has 25 elk. At the latter 
place he has 10 acres inclosed with an open wire fence. There will 
soon be dug here a large pond, which Avill be filled with salt water from 
the tides of Sheei)shead Bay, In this pond are to be a dozen seals and 
10 sea lions. The former are now on their way from St. Johns, New- 
foundland, and the latter are making their long journey from the Pa- 
cific coast. Later in the summer a number of other animals will be 
added to the iuclosure. 



THE HOME OF THE TROGLODYTES.* 



By E. T. Hamy. 



Tlie aneients had a vaf^uo knowledge of a people inhabiting certain 
districts of northern Africa, who were remarkable for the cnstoni, 
which they had in common, of making their habitations in the depths 
of the earth. These were the Troglodytes. 

A portion of the sea-coast of Erythr;enm Mare (Red Sea) owed the 
name of Troglody tic Ethiopia to certain of these barbarians; others 
occupied a territory adjacent to the mountains which rise in the south- 
ern part of Fezzan, while others, much farther to the west, inhabited 
an undulating region in which there is recognized the chain which sur- 
rounds the lower extremity of Little Syria. 

The accounts of these curious people, as given by ancient writers, 
always represent them as constructing their dwellings under ground; 
as being hunters of such activity and skill that they take their game 
while in pursuit, living for the most part however on the flesh of 
serpents and lizards. They are described as being poor and indifferent 
to their own interests, having no trade except in carbuncles, for which 
iiowever they were merely agents. Their language differed entirely 
from that of any other people, it being compared byHerodotus to the 
strident cry of the bat. 

These summary accounts, incoherent and sometimes fantastic, have 
had the effect of rendering most modern historians of African geog- 
raphy in(Meduh)US as to their truth. These extraordinary beings have 
Ix'cn ordinarily banished to a world of the imagination, the species of 
whom anti(iuity has so largely multiplied even to the confines of known 
countries. Reliable travellers came however in their turn to discover 
in the very same regions where the ancients had located their Troglo- 
dytes, imixtrtant tribes, living like them in subterranean abodes, natural 
or artificial. 

The English Captain Lyons described in 1821, during a four days' 
march to the southwest of Tripoli, through a district mentioned by 

* Read at the annual i)ublic meeting of the five Academies of tlie Institute of 

Fiauee, October 24, 1891. (From L'Anlhropologie, Sept.-Oct., 1891; vol. ii, pp. 

529-536.)

426 THE HOME OF THE TROGLODYTES, 

Pomponius Mela and by Pliny, a certain village of Beni- Abbas, deeply 
hollowed out of tlie sandy clay or calcareous rock. The French Consul 
Delaporte, the Egyptian Sheik, Mohammed-Ibn-Omar-el-Tounsy, and 
others, in confirming this discovery have generalized it to the entire 
region of Gharian. 

In 1869, Nachtigal found hidden in the valley of Tao, in the heart of 
Thibet, the caves of the Toubous, direct descendants of the Ethiopian 
Troglodytes, whom Herodotus represented as the victims of the Gara- 
mantes, the ancient inhabitants of Fezzan. Thirty years later our 
soldiers, penetrating into the massive mountains which rise to the ' 
southwest of Gabes, and at Donirat and Nefouya are connected with 
Gharian, came upon a dozen villages excavated from the ancient allu- 
vium of the i)]ateaus of Matniata and Toujane, containing as many as 
4,000 inhabitants. Distinguished officers, such as the commander, 
Rebillet; learned naturalists, like Letouriieux, have since that time 
visited this country, and I, in my turn, have traversed it in the course 
of a voyage of inquiry.* If I saw few serpents and lizards, and still 
fewer carbuncles in the dark dwellings of Matmata, of Hadeje, or of 
Beni-Zelten; if I did not hear proceed from the mouth of the Caliphs, 
who received me so cordially, the strident tones which the historians 
and classical geographers have ascribed to their ancestors, I have at 
least been able to make some observations which are of a nature to 
throw light upon the interpretations of certain passages in the writers 
of antiquity. I gathered at the same time new data for the study of 
those ethical survivals, which day by day are playing a more important 
l)art in history and anthropology. 



The journey from the coast of Syria to the interior valleys peopled 
by the Troglodytes is a short but rough one. It is necessary to cross 
the arid and stony desert of Araad, then to make the painful ascent 
of the bed of one of the dried-up torrents, which has worn its way 
through the steep cliff of Mount Demer. 

The approach to these subterranean villages is most accessible from 
the west. In ascending the acropolises of Zeuatia, the contrast between 
the characteristics of these two neighboring tribes is strikingly evident. 
They belong to the same ethnic group, but each is faithfully devoted to 
its own traditional customs. The Zenati construct their villages accord- 
ing to the architectural rules which governed the builders of the ancient 
Berber cities, ruins of which I have found in central Tunis, between 
Dar-el-Bey and Kairouan. They are in reality intrenched camps, 
formed by walls of bare stones, with occasional openings, surmounted 
in the rear by other walls, parallel and strengthened by semi-circular 
turns, which protect the entrance to the lanes. The Matmati, on the 

*I had for a travelling companion the engineer, Monsieur J. E. de la Croix, who 
was studying the geology of the region. 



THE HOME OF THE TROGLODYTES. 427 

coutrary, like the auoient Troglodytes, excavate their dwellings, scat- 
tered here aud there without order, from the compact allivium which 
the rains have long; since formed in the depressions of the valley. 

To the rear are the rocky summits where rise the somber Zenatian 
redoubts, Tamezret,Zeraoua, etc., while in front is the open, undulating 
valley where there is nothing, at first sight, to reveal the presence of 
man, A narrow neck, guarded by a small fort of rough stones, marks 
the limit of the two territories. The descent is made slowly by a steep 
inclination following a ravine which has long since been worn by the 
floods. The hardness and depth ot the slimy bank suggest to the un- 
prejudiced mind the possibility of here digging out one's habitation. 
It is a continuous descent; the valley broadens, the horizon becomes 
visible, a vast extent of land is gradually perceived, and not a sound, 
not a movement to suggest the approach to a populons village. Below 
there however to the right is the Gelaa Matmata, which appears to 
the eye with its abrupt descent and its extensive terrace like a natural 
fortress, where, many a time during the course of a turbnlent history, 
the natives have found a refuge. To the left is the west Matmata, out- 
lining the yellowish course of its dried bed, dotted here and therewith 
stattered olive trees. IMatmata Bled Kebira, the large town of Mat- 
matia, is in truth at our feet without our having perceived it. Let us 
ai)proach. Traces of its presence become gradually apparent. Eleva- 
tions and corresponding depressions in the land become clearly defined, 
and the white Koubba of the IMohammedan priest, Sida-Mou^a appears 
at the turning of the footpath informing us that these ancient people, 
with their strange manners, whom we wish to approach, have submitted 
to the destructive influence of Islam, and have in consequence pre- 
served only a few of those valuable survivals which we are so desirous 
of studying. 

In lOgypt, among the wretched dwellings in mutilated pyramids, and 
in the double dovecots which remind one of the old Pylons; in the 
acropolises of Zenatia at Gharian and Kabylie, in a word, over the 
whole of northern Africa, tlie Koubba of the priest, the minaret of the 
mosque, symbols of triumphant Mohammedanism, strike the arch^ologist 
and ethnologist as something abnormal, and T may say entirely out 
of place. Tiiese rural constructions, unsightly in themselves, and in- 
congruous when placed side by side with those of the natives, in the 
midst of which they are conspicuous on account of their form and color, 
disturb tlie harmony of the landscape, recalling at the same time the 
cruel struggles, by fire and arms, for conquest and conversion to the 
religion of the conquerers. The abrupt cliffs of Mount Demer were not 
able to arrest the Ilillalien (?) invasion, and jMatmati, the Troglodyte, 
has been since then a good Mussulman. 

Two other Koubbax appear, then a square white house, the abode of 
the religious chief, then the dar of the civil and military chief, the 
Caliph Ali-Ould-Kaid- Ahmed. 



428 THE HOME OF THE TROGLODYTES. 

This day is composed of five parallel chambers iu masonry, which, 
beyond the first glance, are not Troglodytic in character. A small 
quantity of loose earth has been carried for appearance sake onto the 
terrace which surmounts the structure. In this detail the residence of 
Ali — Berber in style although strongly Arabized — is that of the great 
semi-sedentary chiefs, wliich one meets with more especially in the 
interior of Tunis. 

One of the last surface structures is an old cistern, of which the 
partially demolished arches bring to mind, by their form and construc- 
tion, those of Malga, at Carthage. 

The remainder of the village, which extends over 4 kilometers and 
contains more than 2,000 inhabitants, is entirely under-grotmd. The 
dar even, which shelters us, covers a vast cave, descent into which is 
made by a semi-circular declivity. It is a part of the dwelling of the 
ancient chiefs, constructed, Ali informs us, in the time of the Romans, 
which, to the good Caliph, seemed to stand for the most remote period. 
The excavators Avho executed this ancient work had to i^enetrate first 
through the calcareous clay, which forms the soil of the whole valley; 
then through a pebbly conglomerate, and finally through a quarry of 
hard millstone, which forms the floor of the grotto. A second excava- 
tion, of more recent origin, is dug out of the clay a little higher and to 
the right of the first. This serves as a stable for the horses of Ali. 

Dwellings, stables, cattle sheds, workshops, and factories, everything 
in the village of Matmatia, are likewise excavated from the clay. In 
one instance the descent is made, as in the caves of the abode of the 
Caliphs, by means of an incline more or less perpendicular, and lighted 
from without; in another it is necessary to seek an entrance through a 
tunnel, which terminates, after several windings, in an interior court, 
more or less regular and lighted from above at the summit of the allu- 
vial peak of the elevation from which the dwelling has been dug. 

A little factory, which we can enter, gives a good idea of the manner 
in which work is carried on by tradition among the excavators of Mat- 
matia. It is an oil factory, composed of three compartments, the first 
of which commands the other two and is lighted by an arched door, to 
which a straight flight of steps gives access. The two deep chambers 
remain unfinished, a wall, consisting of a mass of earth, dividing one 
from the other. The interior was dug out with a pick-axe, forming- 
arches, and there remain cubes sufficiently large to support the center. 
The largest room contained the mill and its accessories, resembling 
closely the apparatus used all over the Berber states. 

The entrance to this primitive factory is ornamented with a row of 
uncemented stones around the aperture forming the entrance. The de- 
tail of this ornamentation recalls the custom among ancient builders of 
covering the frontof their subterranean dwellings with a facingof stones, 
in more or less regular lines. Not far from the dar, a sort of palace (be- 
longing to a very remote period and for the most part in ruins, where I

have been able to make some researches,) contaius in its interior court 
fa§ades, completely provided with walls where deep vaulted chambers 
open on two elevations. The dwelling of the chief, the stables, and the 
cattle-sheds formerly occupied the ground lloor. The .souls or store- 
rooms were constructed in stories, to climb to which one clings to large 
stones jutting out from the wall. 

If the fa(;ade presents an ornamentation of stones, nothing is seen in 
the interior but calcareous rock and a sort of loam, still showing the 
ridges made by the irregular strokes of the pick-axe of the ancient 
builder. jS"either stone, wood, nor iron appears, only the soil of a red- 
dish or yellowish gray, dry and hard, in which rare snail shells are found 
here and there. If a ring, upon which to hang a lamp or to which to 
fiisten a horse's halter is required, these shells are utilized, being placed 
in the most convenient and consi)icuous point in the room or stable. 
Niches take the place of cupboards, and benches along the side wall 
serve as beds and chairs. 

These apartments, like all the others which we saw among the Troglo- 
dytes, are quite regularly vaulted, although the arches are keel-shaped, 
the sides being slightly curved and the extremities perceptibly drawn 
together. We are reminded of an old boat, turned upside down, keel 
in air, lying upon the sea-shore, under which the poor gatherer or waif 
may find a shelter. 

In thus recognizing nautical forms in the most essential lines of the 
architecture of the Troglodytes, I suddenly recollect the rustic habi- 
tations [m<ip(dia) of which Sallust speaks in the eighteenth chapter 
of his classical work on the rJugurthan war. In summing up the tra- 
ditions of the Province, which he governed, and which he must have 
thor(mglily known, he mentions the death of Hercules, and the divsper- 
sion of his army composed of various nations. Medes, Persians, Arme- 
nians crossed over to Africa in their shij)s and occupied the seacoast. 
The Persians are the most remote from the ocean, the most eastern, 
and ('onse<iueiitly occupy that region adjoining Syria; and since they 
do not find building material upon this inhosi)itable shore, and the 
vastness of the sea and ignorance of the language of their neighbors 
depri\'e them of the means of procuring such material hy purchase or 
exchange, they have built for themselves shelters out of the hulls of 
their ships; and Sallust adds that the buildings of their descendants, 
called mapalia, oblong constructions with curved sides, resemble the 
keels of shi])s, the abodes of their ancestors. 

Not so very long ago, when i\\Q, ethnography of Africa was practi- 
cally unknown, an attempt was made to explain the survivals indicated 
by the Roman historian by likening the mapalia which he describes to 
the tents of the wandering tribes of the lofty table lands of the Atlas. 
In history, as in government, the Perber and the Arab are confounded, 
to the great prejudice of our African policy, and in the same manner 
the commentators of Sallust ignored the essential diflereuces which 



430 THE HOME OF THE TROGLODYTES. 

exist between the solid buildings of the ancient inhabitants of the soil 
and the temporary movable abodes of the shei)hei'ds, whose migration 
to Magreb is comparatively recent. The true mapalia are keel- shaped 
constructions, long, narrow, and low, of which the ksours of Mettamer 
and of Medennie in Araad represent the most perfect type, and which 
our Troglodytes of Matmata, d'Hadeje, etc., have adapted to their spe- 
cial needs. 

II. 

Sallust, in ending his cliaper on ethnology, describes the strangers 
whom legend brings to the shores of Africa as mingling with the native 
Getules, and increasing rapidly, from which alliances have sprung the 
great nation of the Numidians, soon spreading over all the territory 
about Carthage. 

The uncertainty as to origin, thus attributed by tradition to the 
Numidians, manifests itself even in our day in regard to the Berbers 
of Tunis in general, and x^articularly among those of the mountains of 
the south. A special ethnical type, of which the large island of Djerba 
is the principal centerof habitation, here comes in contact with another 
type, no less characteristic, which xiredominates in the DJerid. The 
type of the Djerabi, which corresponds to the foreign population which 
Sallust represented as landing on the shore in the vicinity of Syria, is 
distinguished, at the first glance, by a very clear complexion of a dead 
white, or else slightly bronzed, relative shortness of the head, and 
roundness of the face; the nose is straight, the lips thin, the chin 
rounded. The type of the Djeridi, descendants of the ancient Getules, 
is characterized on the contrary by dark coloring, almost that of a mu- 
latto, a long and narrow skull, a high forehead, retrousse nose, thick 
lil>s, and receding chin. I have found these two ethnical types well 
distinguished by Dr. Collihnon in the two Caliphates of Matmata. The 
first seemed to me to i)redominate at Hadeje; the second i>revailing at 
Matmata Bled Kebira. 

Besides these there were seen here and there in the mountains, per- 
sons without doubt of Zanatian origin, who recall our Kabyles; a few 
half-breed Arabs, and also a small number of negroes, more or less Ber- 
ber in type, exercising in general the important profession of water-car- 
riers, but transforming themselves in an obliging manner into musicians 
for local fetes. 

The Matmatians are at the same time shepherds and husbandmen. 
They raise herds, of which goats and sheep x)redominate. The wool of 
these animals they take to the coast to sell, sometimes raw and some- 
times woven. They cultivate barley and wheat, the date, olive, and 
fig, the products of which transported to Gabes enable them to acquire, 
by exchange, a quantity of foreign objects which more and more take 
the place of the articles wiiich they formerly fabricated for tliemselvts. 
I found in the house of Ali porcelains of Limoges, ordinary glassware, 



THE HOME OF THE TROGLODYTES. 431 

a tin lantern of Parisian manufacture, copper candlesticks, wax candles, 
white sugar, a bottle of ink from Dijon, a pair of spectacles with silver 
rims, knives from Chatellerault, knives and forks of ruolz, etc. Nothing 
of home manufacture remained in the surroundings of the good old 
man excepting the grey wool of the burnous, the rug from Oudref 
spread in our room, and the large dishes in basketwork and wood on 
which the abundant diffa was served to us. 

This is the case at Hadeje, as well as everywhere else. 

All that has not succumbed to European influence is distinctly Arab. 
Food, clothing, ornaments, arms, etc., suggest in appearance those of 
the nomads of the neighboring desert. 

Their social condition is very similar to that of the Arabs, whom the 
Matmatians imitate as closely as possible so long as it entails nothing 
contrary to their traditional legislation (Kanouu). They possess a 
Zaonia, who enjoys a great reputation in the mountains, and their 
religious rites follow closely those of the dissenting Ibbadites, whose 
beliefs they share. They bury their deatl, according to Arabian custom, 
in shallow graves, so near the surface of the earth that a poet, in 
visiting the spot, has been able to say without exaggeration that in 
this strange laud the dead occupy the place of the living, while the 
living "have for habitation true sepulchers." "When you see them 
come forth," the Arab poet goes on to say, "it seems as if they were 
rising for the day of judgment." 

lieni-Zelten and Toujane mark the extreme eastern limit of the 
country of the Troglodytes. The Berber language is again heard when 
beyond the last inhabited cave the terraces of the dreary, gray houses 
of the Zanaitia re-a])pear, overlooking iu the distance the steep clifl', the 
extended plain, and the sea. 



SUMMARY OF PEOGRESS IN AXTHROPOLOGY IX 1891. 



By Otis T. Mason. 



Tlic i)m-poso of this summary is to dra\y attention to combined and 
organized resources, rather than to individual eft'ort. The number of 
books, pamphlets, papers, etc., read before societies and general meet- 
ings and congresses, and of articles in current periodicals, is so great 
that it were impossible to enumerate them. Furthermore, this is not 
necessary now as formerly, since several of the organs of anthroi)olog- 
ical societies publish great lists, .and special journals in each division 
of the subject i>ay great attention to bibliography. To American 
readers, i)articnlarly to those who desire to commence a course of 
anthropological studies, the following should be accessible :

The address of Prof. Max iM idler, as vice-president of the section of 
anthroi)ology in the British Association, at the meeting held in Cardift" 
in August of this year, was a review of the forty years during which he 
had taken part in this organization. In that early day there was no 
section of anthroi)ology, the study of mankind being relegated to sec- 
tion I) {zoiilogii and botany). In 1851 section E {geography and ethnology) 
was fornicd, the former, however, more and more absorbing the latter 
until 1884, when section II {anthropology) was organized. In 1817 the 
debates on ethnology were most popular, shared in by Miiller, Prichard, 
Latliam, Urawford, Bunscn, Karl Meyer, Prince Lncien Bonaparte, and 
patronized by I'rince Albert. In Prof. Midler's address, the prophecies

tion, devoted to anthropology, the following papers of general interest 
were read: 

M. Fauvelle: Succession of environments inhabited by the series of man's ancestors. 
Delisle: Artificial deformation of the skull in France. The coiffures which i)ro- 

duce them and the chart of their <listribution.

A novel feature of this meeting was the choice of a snbje(;t for special 
discussion at the meeting to be held at Pan in 1892 under the pres- 
idency of Dr. Magitot, namely, the criminal type from the anthropo- 
logical point of view.

The Taris school of Anthropology not ouly continued its course of 
lectures, but provided for their widespread influence and perpetuation 
by establishing a monthly journal, Revue Metisnelle de V Anthropologie 
(le Paris. The course of lectures during- the year included the follow- 
ing: 

G. cle Moitillet: The origin of iigri culture. 

Andro Lefevre: Linguistic evolution; origin of articulate language. 
G. Hervc : General natural history of man and of the human rafces. 
J. V. Laborde: The instinctive and the intellectual functions. 
Mahoudean: Histcdogy of the skin, its attachments and the organs of sense. 
Bordier: Acclimation. Role of the interior environment in the phenomena of ac- 
climation. 
Manouvrier: Human anatomy audits relations with psychology.

A. de ]Mortillet : Industry among prehistoric jteoplcs and among modern savages. 

The Ninth International Congress of Americanists was announced to 
nu'et in the Convent of Santa Maria delaKabida, in' the province of 
Iluelva, Spain, fi-om the 7th to the 11th of October, 1S92. at the close of 
the session of the Congress of Orientalists, to be held in Seville Octo- 
ber 1 to <). To celebrate the fourth centennial after the discovery of 
America, extraordinary prei);ir;itions were made. The naming of the 
continent, the voyages of Columbus, the government of the Indians by 
the different countries interested, and the influence of Europeans upon 
the aboriginal liabits and governments and kindred topics were to be 
made prominent. The archaMilogic, ethnographic, linguistic, and his- 
toric papers and debates were selected and ordered with reference tD 
the one absorbing event of the year. 

The American Association for the Advancement of Science met in 
Washington under the patronage of a joint committee of all the scien- 
tiflc societies. The Anthropological Society of Washington and the 
Women's Anthropological Society were especially active in giving suc- 
cess to their section. Papers germane to the stmly of man were not 
confiiied to Section H. The presidential address upon the possibilities 
of the vegetable kingdom for yielding new ])lants to the service of man 
was practically an antln-opological i)ai)er. The geological section also 
listened to papers on the quaternary that can not fail to be instructive 
to students of the juiticiuity of man. Section I, devoted to economics 
and social problems, <livided the time of many anthropologists with 
Section II. Trof. . I astro \v presided over Section 11, and chose as his 
theme "Analogy as a basis of argument among lower races and among 
the Folk." Suggestions were made relative to the formation of a sec- 
tion of ])sychology in the association, but it was tlnrnght that more 
w<nild be lost than gained by diverting attention from the general sec- 
tion of anthropology. The Washington meeting was especially favored 
by the bringing out of Maj. Powell's Linguistic 3Iap of ISTorth America, 
by papers of Mr. Frank Cushing, and by a minute recital of the ghost 
dance by ]Mr. James ]Mooney, who had been participating therein for

For the pnrpose of perfecting organization and bringing together the 
various associations in our country devoted to anthropology, the Ameri- 
can Oriental Society appointed a committee to learn if it were practica- 
ble to open negotiations with other i)hilological, arclueoh)gical, and eth- 
nological societies with a view to adopting a common time and place 
for meeting every other year. The following associations are included 
in the list : 

The American Oriental Society, 1842. 

The American Philological Association, 1869. 

Tlie .\rcha'ological Institute of America, 1879. 

The Anthropological Society of Washington, 1879. 

The Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis, 1880. 

The Modern Language Association of America, 1883. 

The American F<dk-Lore Society, 1888. 

The American Dialect Socictj^, 1889. 
The friends of the natural history of man will look forward with great 
interest to the result of this inquiry. 

In May, 1890, at the reipu'st of vseveral gentlemen in Chicago, Prof. 
r. W, IMitnam outlined a plan for an ethnological and arclneological 
exhibit, itarticularly relating to America, as a desirable and instructive 
section of the World's Columbian Ex])osition, this exhibit to be brought 
together largely by special exph)rati<)n and research and with the nn- 
<lerstanding that it should form the nucleus of a ]»ermanent ethnolog- 
ical museum in Chicago. This])lan was ])rinted in the Chicago Tribune 
of May 31, 1S90. 

In the following- September, Prof. Tutnarawas invited to address the 
Committee on l*ernuinent Organization of the National Board of Com- 



438 SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1891. 

missioiiers on the subject of an etlinological and arcluvological exhibit, 
and soon afterwards the Board of Directors invited him to present liis 
views before that bod3^ The substance of these remarks was printed 
by the Committee on Organization of National Commissioners as an 
appendix to their report on September 15, 1890. 

In January, 1891, the Director-General of the Exposition invited Prof. 
Putnam to a conference on the scope and i)lan for Department M, which 
had been designated by the National Commissioners with the title 
"Ethnology, Archaeology, Progress of Labor and Invention," and on 
February 5 Prof. Putnam was ofticially appointed Chief of the De^jart- 
ment. 

The National Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors 
are siiecially interested in the development of this department, which 
is so entirely removed from the material interests of the World's Fair. 
The understanding is that from this exhibit there shall result a per- 
manent Columbus Museum (for all departments of Natural History) of 
a character worthy of the Exposition and of Chicago. This result will 
be appreciated by scientists, who will hail with delight the formation 
of a great museum in this central part of our country. 

In former summaries attention has been called to the excellent an- 
thropoh)gical work done in Salem, Cambridge, Worcester, New York, 
Cleveland, Philadelphia, Washington, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Daven- 
port, and other cities; but these by no means include all the organized 
eflbrt to preserve in our country the history and natural history of man. 
In almost every American city of importance these are banded together 
in societies, many of them incorporated, men and women devoted to 
some branch of anthropology. Omitting the medical societies that 
publish somewhat, sufticiently catalogued in the Index Medicus, the 
writer has sought to enumerate the organizations in the different States 
that are equipped for anthropological work. The list has been made 
long intentionally, quite as much to awaken an interest in the study 
of archaMdogy and etlinclogy as to put on record their existence and 
the amount of good already accomplished by them. Many subscription 
journals in our country also lend their pages to anthropological papers, 
and these also find a place in tlie list in recognition of their services. 
There are few persons who will not be surprised at the great numbers 
of media of communication. The work of the future will be to gather 
them into an organization.

The antliropoloiiical museum is an essential part of the natural his- 
tory of man. The true motive and spirit of a useful museum are well 
set forth in Dr. Goode's lecture on the museums of the future. The 
ideas enforced therein connect exhibition with study and instruction, 
and make it plain that the founders of such an organization should 
provide for indelinite expansion. The dearth of enterprise and enthu- 
siasm ui)on this interesting held has been in the past a cause of lament. 

In the University of Pennsylvania the museum of archaeology is in 
successful oi)eration, and since 1889 a " University Archaeological 
Association " has grown to have a contributing membership of 275. 
The president of the university is also })residing officer of the associa- 
tion, and there is the closest sympathy between this organization and 
the department of arclneology and paheohtology in the University. 

A department of archieohtgy aiul paLeontology in the University, 
with American, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Oriental sections in the 
iNluseum of Archaeology and Pahrontology, has been organized with 
Mr. Stewart Culin as secretary. 



444 SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1891. 

The following i^roposed class! flc.atiou and international nomenclature 
of the anthropologic sciences has been offered by Dr. J). G. Briuton:

branches), the Austafrican or Black Race, the Asian Race (Sinitic and 
Sibiric branches), the American Race, Insular and Littoral i^eopl^s 
(Nigritic, Malayic, and Australic stocks). 



SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1891. 445 

lY. Arch(volo(ji/. — 1. Geueial arcbicology : Geoloj^y of the epoch of 
man; glacial i)heiiomoiia; diluvial and allnvial deposits; physical 
goograpliy of tlie quaternary; i)i'eliistoric botany and zotilogy; pre-

uology; i)rt)to-historic epoch. 2. Special archfeology: Egyi)tian, As- 
syrian, Plieniciau, Classical, jMedieval, and American Arch;eology. 

BIOLOGY. 

Oji tlic biological side the best coni[)rehensive survey of anthropology 
is Topinard's " L'lloinnie dans la ^"ature." It will be remembered that 
ill 187C the author published his ''Anthropologic," an elementary 
treatise inspired and patronized by Broca, In 1880 appeared the au- 
thor's " Elements d'Anthropologie Generale," an elaborate volume of 
over eleven hundred pages, of which the present work is a comprehen- 
sive abridgement, bringing the subject down to date. The lectures in 
the Ecole d'Anthropologie, based on studies made upon materials gath- 
ered in the museum of the Societe d' Vnthropologie, the Musee Broca, 
of the Ecole, and in other collections of Paris, continue to be the best 
ettbrt to make public the results of biological anthropology. In our 
own country, outside the medical colleges and the Surgeon General's 
laboratory, little anthropo-biological work was done; an exception is 
to be made in the matter of psycho-physics. If one should wish how- 
ever to become acquainted with the biological work of the world, he 
would only have to turn to the Index MedicKs and the Index Cataloyne 
of the Surgeon General's library. The purely anthropological part of 
these catalogues also appears in the current numbers of American An- 
thropologist, edited by Dr. Eobert Fletcher. 

Psycho-2>hi/s ics. — For the study of psy sho-phy sics and kindred branches 
of anthropology the Ameiiean Journal of Psyehology is the standard 
authority, Tiie current literature of the world is there reviewed, and 
tlu' titles of foreign periodicals and Journals contributing to the science 
are gi\en. 

In .March, Dr. Henry II. Donaldson delivered before the Boston 
Medico-Psychological Society a course of six lectures on cerebral local- 
ization. This series draws attention to a doubly interesting fact, 
namely, the existence of a medico psychological society, coupled with a 
course of public lectures for pedagogical purposes. The subjects of 
the lectures were as fidlows: 

(1) Iveceiit advances in our knowledge concerning the structure of 
nerve cells and nerve fibers, and the relation of these to one another. 
The most valuable anthropometric publication of the year is Eisley's 
"Tribes and Castes of India,'' two octavo volumes, containing 876 pages 
of measurements, to be followed by a volume which will give full analyses 
of the data, indicating their bearing u])(ui the ethnology of northern 
India, and also upon certain more general questions which have been 



446 SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1891. 

discussed in Europe. The measurements were taken in Bengal, tlie 
Northwestern Provinces, and the Panjab, in 1880-1888. Topinard's 
measures and instruments were employed, with the exception of the 
naso-malar index of Oldfield Thomas. {J. Anthrop. Inst. May, 1885). 

(2) Continuation upon the architecture of the nervous system. 

(3) The motor regions of the brain. The middle portions of both 
hemispheres contain motor centers. 

(4) The sensory centers. The motor centers form a dividing line in 
the cortex, behind which lie the sensory centers, and in front is an un- 
occupied area which is left out of the discussion. 

(5) Cerebral localization in the vertebrate series becoming less per- 
fect as we pass downward. 

(6) The principal explanations which have been offered for the phe- 
nomena of cerebral localization and some of the points of contact be- 
tween these phenomena and iDsychology. 

Dr. Donaldson's observations on the brain and several sense-organs 
of the blind deaf-mute, Laura Dewey Bridgmau, in the American Jour- 
nal of Psychology (iv, 248-249) is accompanied with a bibliography of 
ninety-two titles, bearing upon the study of the brain and sense organs 
in nealth and disease. These titles are numbered and references to 
them in the text are made by the numbers and not by foot notes. 

Dr. Edmund C. Sanford presents in the American Journal of Psy- 
chology (IV, 141-155) the outlines of a course of study of lectures in 
physiological psychology. Tliis is done not only to encourage the estab- 
lishment of laboratories, but to assist college men and others, who are 
not prepared to make original investigations, in repeating the experi- 
ments of the best establishments. In each case the apparatus and the 
method of applying it are minutely described. The following program 
is followed: 

I. The dermal senses. — ^1) Sensations of contact. (2) Sensations of 
temperature. (3) Sensations of pressure. 

II. Static and liinwsthetic senses. — (1) Recognition of the posture of 
the body as a whole. (2) Sensations of rotation, (3) Sensation of 
progressive motion. (4) Muscle sense. (5) Innervation sense. (0) Sen- 
sations of motion. (7.) Sensation of resistance. (8) Bilateral assym- 
metries of position and motion. 

In an elaborate paper on the psychology of time, Mr. Hebert Nichols 
reviews the terms and exi)ressions for time in the classic authors, fol- 
lows the conception of a i)sychological recognition of time historically, 
and completes his essay with a review of modern psycho-physical experi- 
ments in this direction. As a sunmiary of the experiments of Horing, 
Mach, Vierordtj Kollert, Estel, Mehner, Glass, Stevens, Ejner, and 
Miinsterberg the most conclusive result may thus be summed up. 

Nearly all persons, under nearly all conditions, find a particular length 
of interval more easily and accurately to be judged than any other. 
This "indifference point," or interval of best judgment, is very vari- 
able for different individuals and for different times and conditions. 



SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1891. 447 

" The sign of tlie Ooii.staut Error is usually constaut in both direc- 
tions from the Indifference Point." 

Where norm and re-production are single, the constant error is minus 
for intervals long'er and plus for intervals shorter than the indifference 
interval. " Where norm and re-production are multiples, the constant 
error [a plus for intervals lou.!>'er and minm for those shorter than the 
indifference interval. The majority of evidence is strongly against the 
validity of Weber's law; also against any fixed or constant periodicity. 

" Later investigators look to physiological processes for explanations 
of time judgments, and particularly to rythmic habits of nerve centers. 
W^hether such processes as breathing, pulse, leg-swing, etc., govern 
our perceptions or whether the more general rythmic functions of the 
higher cephalic centers are in themselves the basis of time judgment is 
now the important question." 

In 1890, was founded in Hamburg and Leipzig, Zeitschrift fiir Fsy- 
choJogie nnd Physiolofjie der iSinncsorgane, a bi-monthly octavo under 
the editorship of Hermann Ebbinghans and Arthur Konig, assisted by 
H. Aubert, S. Exner, H. v. Helmholtz, R. Heriug, J. v. Kries, Th. Lipps, 
G. E. Midler, W. Preyer, and C. Stumpf. 

Original papers by the most distinguished investigators are pub- 
lished in each number, works of chief importance are reviewed, and, of 
the greatest value, a bibliography of psy<;ho physical literature for 1889 
is given in the fourth number, pages 3().")-118. This bibliography is a 
model of convenience. The titles are classified and numbered and an 
alphabetical list of authors refers in each case to the title of the author's 
book. Thus it is possible to exhibit the classification of the material, 
the full title, and to find the work through three separate lists. 

The Society for Psychical Research continued its active investigations 
upon the phenomena of hypnotism, animal magnetism, suggestive 
therapeutics, psycho-therapeutics, phantasms of the living, phantasms 
of the de id, clairvoyance, premonitions, hallucinations, thought-trans- 
ference or telepathy, and the like. In order to stimulate its friends 
and members to renewed activity, a circular was issued insisting that 
•• the value to be attached to the evidence already collected must largely 
(h'i)end on its continuous recnforcement by fresh cases of like kind 
observed with care and recorded without delay. In the second place, 
supposing that the general facts, say of telepathy or of veridical appa- 
ritions, were even universally admitted, it would still be a matter of 
jn-ime interest and importance to discover as much as possible of the 
laws which govern these strange phenomena, and it is therefore, impos- 
sible to assign any limit to the number and variety of cases which might 
be collected and registered with this end in view." 

The most noticeable advance in the prosecution of this part of anthro- 
pological work is in the line of co-ordination and co-operation. The 
Psychological Society of Moscow was founded in 1888 for the discus- 
sion of problems in psychology, its foundation, theory, applications, and 



448 SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1891. 

history. The society has published three vohimes of transactions. A 
journal was founded entitled ^'■Problems in Philosophy and Psychology." 

A grant was made to the Toronto Unisrersity for the equipment of a 
laboratory of experimental psychology. Offers were made to students 
at once to furnish such apparatus as should be needed for the present 
purposes, and promises given that the provincial government would 
print the results of the investigation should these results warrant it. 

For the study of psycho-physics and kindred branches of anthropol- 
ogy, the American Journal of Psychology is the standard authority. 
The current literature of the world is there reviewed and the titles of 
foreign periodicals and journals contributing to the science are given. 
Outside of this eminent journal the entire literature of the subject is to 
be sought in the following :

ETHNOLOGY. 

Two contributions to ethnographic science made in this year should 
be named together, Powell's Linguistic Map of North America and 
Brinton's "American Race." The former is the gatheredresultof all that 
has been done hitherto in locating North American stocks and tribes, 
systematized and put into shape by thirteen years of continuous effort 
of Major Powell and the Bureau of Ethnology. The latter may also be 
called the result of a life-long inquiry. The ethnography of South 
America has been in an unsatisfactory condition, and the first thing to 
do was to sum up carefully previous knowledge. This Dr. Brinton has 
accomplished, thus paving the way for systematic effort in the future. 
Below will be found the North American stocks as arranged by Major 
Powell, followed by a list of stocks as laid down by Dr. Brinton. The 
two form a continuous series from one end of the continent to the other, 
the stocks being arranged alphabetically under three titles. North 
America, Middle America, South America. 

NORTH AMERICAN STOCKS. 

Algonquiau: Of the North Atlantic seaboard and west through the Northern States,

452 SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1891. 

The Henienway Southwestern Archaeological aud Ethnological ex- 
pedition began to bear fruit in the publication of a ^^ Journal of Ameri- 
cmi Ethnology and Arcluuology.''^ edited by J. Walter Fewkes, con- 
ductor of the expedition. This will be followed by other volumes, 
putting on permanent record the results of Mrs. Hemenway's liberality 
during a series of years in sustaining the researches of Gushing and 
Bandelier, and subsequently of Mr. Fewkes. The first volume relates 
especially to Zuiii. 

All ethnographic contribution not to be ignored is a series of pajjers 
by Dr. Ernst, of Caracas, Venezuela, on the aborigines of that repub- 
lic, published in the Boletin del Mmisterio de Ohras Puhlicas. In the 
same journal Dr. G. Marcano contributes a series of papers on the pre- 
Columbian ethnography of Venezuela. 

The iJublishers of our latest encyclop<Bdias, such as Johnson's, 
Chambers's, Stanford's, Cassell's, etc., have earned the gratitude of 
ethnologists by employing men of acknowledged ability to prepare the 
descriptive articles on tribes and peoples. The geographic societies 
also have borne a conspicuous part in collecting and preserving data 
for future compilations regarding ethnology. Especially useful in 
these studies are the Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Lou- 
don, U Anthropologie of Paris, and the Zei'tmhrift and Verhandlungen 
of the Berlin Anthropological Society. 

LANGUAGE. 

/ 

In his lecture entitled '^Du cri a la parole," delivered in I'EcoIe 
d' Anthropologic de Paris, and jiublished in the first number of the 
Revue Mensuelle, the following conclusions are reached by the speaker: 
Animals are already in possession of two distinctive elements of lan- 
guage: (1) the si)ontaneous, refiex cry of emotion aud of want, and (2) 
the intentional cry of advertisement, menace, or appeal. From these 
two sorts of sounds man, endowed with a vocal apparatus still more 
perfect and cerebral faculties less limited, has created a great number 
of variants by means of prolongation, reduplication, and intonation. 
The cry of appeal is the germ of demonstrative roots prelude to pro- 
nouns, names of number, sex, and distance j the emotional cry, of which 
our interjections are only the debris, combining with the demonstratives, 
prepare the outlines of the i)roposition and form the verb and the noun 
of action and of state. Imitation, direct or symbolical (necessarily 
only aj^proximative) of the noises of surrounding nature, in a word, 
onomatopoeia, furnishes the elements of attributive roots out of which 
are to grow names of objects, special verbs, and their derivatives. 
Analogy and metaphor complete the vocabulary in applying to phe- 
nomena of touch, sight, odor, and taste qualificatives derived by 
onomatoijceia. Then comes reason, which eliminating the greater i)art 
of these inconvenient riches, adopts a greater or less number of sounds 
already reduced to one vague aud generic sound. Then by derivation, 



SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1891. 453 

suffixing, composition, it causes to spring out of these root-sounds 
indelinite lines of words, whicli are of iiU degrees of relatiousliip among 
themselves, which grammar proceeds to distribute into categories, 
called parts of speech. It can be shown how the grammatical forms, 
casual and persoiuil terminations, shades of conjugation are produced 
by atrox)hy of sylhibles atlixed or sufifixe<l to the radical syllable. A 
certain part of the deveh)pment of language is also due to a sort of 
blind force, to nature, as we say, and part to intelligence, either indi- 
vidual or collective. The constitution of grammar detaches linguistics 
from zoology properly so called and brings it within the area of history. 
But tliis historic area cann(»t in any manner be sliut off from anthro- 
pology, for it is only an appendix to luitural history. 

Dr. Borsey's volume on the Cegiha language, though bearing date 
1890, did not ai)pear until hite in 1891. FurthernKU'e, altlumgh it is 
entitled "Tlie Cegiha. Languagi^," the work is devoted especially to 
myths, stcu-ies, and letters, and gives, with text, interlinear translation, 
and free rendering, nearly two hundred and fifty separate literary pro- 
ductions. This embraces the w<u"k of many years, and will furnish to 
t he folk-lorist, as well as to the philologist, ample material for study and 
comparison. The Cegiha language, as used in the volume, refers to the 
si)eech of the Omaha and Ponka tribes of the Siouan linguistic family. 
The author's researches began among the Cegiha in 1871, and have 
been carried on unremittingly ever since. During the last twelve years 
he has bcM'u connected with the Bureau of Ethnology in Washington, 
where his opportunities for study have been unlimited. Special atten- 
tion is also called to Filling's bibliography of the Algonkian, Gatschet's 
Klamath, and Riggs's Dakota dictionary. 

The Semitic de])artm<'nt of Harvard University, in addition to the 
linguistic ccmrses in Hebrew, Aramaic, Assyrian, Ethiopic, Arabic, 
and Plupnician, has established Semitic conferences, a Semitic library, 
a series of prizes for the encouragement of Semitic studies, and a course 
of lectures on studies allied to the department. Most significant in 
this connection is the establishment of a Semitic museum, through the 
generosity of 3Ir. Jacob H. Schitt'. Here already are assembled many 
originals, casts, manuscripts, coins, and i>hotographs, illustrating the 
writing and the history of Babylon, Assyria, Pha^nicia, Palestine, 
Arabia, and other Semitic lan<ls. The generous donor lias also pro- 
vided means of enlarging the collection.

An excellent example of the profit to be derived from the care and 
publication of the material of the older explorers is Mr. Charles H. 
Bead's paper on the collection of ethnographical specimens found 
during- Vancouver's voyage, 1790-1795, plate xi, in vol. xxi, Journal 
of the AntJiropological Institute. This plate shows a Mexican atlatl, 
or throwing stick, but very short, from Lower California, to be held in 
either hand, as distinguished from the Alaskan specimens made for 
either hand. The bows are from Oregon or Washington. 

The curator of the department of ethnology in the IT. S. National 
Museum has instituted and encouraged a series of experiments so as 
to reproduce with facility all savage arts. In the American Anthro- 
pologist, with the colinboration of several other members of the society, 
tiie entire technique of the arrow is worked out. The same jDrocess 
has been followed with fire-making, bow-making, basketry, and the 
manufacture of stone implements, by Messrs. Hough, Murdoch, and 
McGuire. Mr. Holmes's papers on so-called paleolithic imjdemeuts 
should be here included. It is held that in this way alone can modern 
etlinology be made to offer true explanations of the mode of life among 
ancient primitive peoples. 

A model description of an art is Mr. Thomas Wardle's paper in the 
Jouriud of the Society of Arts on the Tussur silk of India and China. 
It is difficult to say whether in the natural history of the moths, the 
elaboration of the art, or the description of the native silk culturist the 
author is most happy. Not only the Indian moths are described but 
an extended list of silk-producing lepidoptera is brought to the pres- 
ent date. The methods of treatment by extremely simple native proc- 
esses is furnished, along with European treatment. The ethnologist 
will be charmed with the account given of the Santals. 

M. Philippe Salmon has constructed an elaborate table of the vsub- 
divisions of the neolithic period of the Stone Age, especially in France 
(Rev. Mens, de I'lilcole d' Anthropologic, Paris i, 26), dividing it into 
(1) Carnacean (Carnac, Morbihan); (2) Chasseo-Robenhausian (Chassy 
aiulRobenhausen); and (3) Champigiiienue(Ohampigny). The finesse 
of this division is too great for repetition here and one wonders whether 
the lines of demarcation will not disappear with furtlier exploration.

A remarkable series of lucky liuds were made on the Hopewell farm, 
near Chillicotlie, Ross County, Ohio, by Mr. Warren K. Moorhead, di- 
rector of the World's Fair arclniiological expedition at that point. Not 
only were new forms of objects discovered, but old forms were collected 
by thousands. The exciting- part of the exploration was tlie finding 
of hundreds of copper objects, many of them of such uniform thinness 
as to raise the question of their European origin. 

The Drexel Institute, founded in Philadelphia by the liberality of Mr. 
Anthony J. Drexel, will be devoted to the encouragenu'iit of technical 
industries. The museum will be administered on the plan of South 
Kensington. 

Before the Tennessee Historical Society the Hon. Gates P. Thurston 
delivere<l a short course of lectures on tlie arclueology of Tennessee, 

SOCIOLOGY. 

Economic science as a branch of sociology is the all-absorbing study 
of the time. There is not space to enumerate the separate books and 
papers on this subject, but every reader should know the general re- 
sources of the study. Section F, British Association, Economic Sci- 
ence and Statistics List of Papers, p. xix. 

Among the i)olitical leaders of France, as well as in tlie Societe 
d'Authropologie, no other question seems to be of such imi>ortauce as 
that of the decrease in natality throughout the Republic. M. Chervin 
sums up the results of an inquiry in the department of Loir-et- Garonne 
in the Bulletin de la Societe (VAnthropologie (4 ser., ii, 42-78). There 
results the demonstration that in this rich department it is the most 
wealthy that have the smallest number of children, and in the most 
thriving part of the department the average of children to a family is 
one. Among the causes of this paucity M. Chervin finds that the well- 
to-do peasant and farmer wills it to be so, and he believes that no leg- 
islation will effect a radical change. Believing that quality and that 
early deaths become a ijotent factor in the decline of population, to M. 
Chervin the saving and perfecting of lives already created is the feasi- 
ble method of strengthening the i)opulation. Assistance and hygiene 
are the practical methods of relief. 

M. Bertillon {id., 3GG-385), regarding the terrible dangers to which 
the phenomenally low natality in France exposes her, and believing 
that theevilsof alcoholism, tobacco, and syphilis have only a subsidiary 
influence, makes the following statement: " That which renders the 
natality of France so feeble is the voluntary sterility of families hav- 
ing some proj)erty. Such families are exceptionally numerous in 
France. They know that the sure way to keep their property is to 
have only one child, and a sure way to lose it is to have more than two. 
One way, therefore, to save France is to remove the cause of feeble na- 
tality and to make it more desirable in the way of relief from taxation 
and increased security of property to have three children than one." In 



SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1891. 457 

the older settlements of our own country attention has tVecpiently been 
called to the decline in the number of large families. 

Dr. liobert Fletcher has brought together, in his address before the 
Anthropological Society of Washington as retiring president, the re- 
sults of a careful study of the new school of criminal anthropology. 
By criminal anthropology is meant the study of the being who, in 
conse(pience of physical ecniformation, hereditary taint, or surround- 
ings of vice, poverty, and ill examjde, yields to temptation and begins 
a career of crime. It is to study the anatomy, the jdiysiology, the 
hygiene of the criminal, his productivity, his capability of amend- 
ment, to examine into his condition, and to recognize his rights. 

An indispensable work to students of the history of human marriage 
is Edward Westermarck's work, published by .Alac.millan. The author, 
it is true, is at issue with almost every school of ;intlir<)i)ology, and for 
tliat reason i)resents the subject from a new point of view, but he has 
brought together a vast amount of material, and his list of authorities 
([uoted amounts to a full bibliography. 

The pedagogic problem has been taken uj) from the side of anthro- 
pology. President G. Stanley Hall, of Clark University, Worcester, 
Mass., has established a new journal, entitled " T//e Pedafjof/ical Sem- 
inary,'*^ as an interiuitional record of educational literature, institutions, 
and progress. The second number of \o\. i, is devoted largely to 
children and adolescents, and deserves that the contents be given

FOLK-LORE, MYrHOLO(^Y, AND IIIEEOLOGY. 

The third annual inoeting of the American Folk-lore Society was 
held at the Columbian University, Washington, D. C, on Tuesday and 
Wednesday, December 21) and 30, This meeting of the society was of 
especial interest on account of the co-operation of the twoantliroi)olog- 
ical societies of Washington iu giving to the sessions a scientitic turn. 
The papers were mostly upon American aboriginal lore. The organ 
of the society, the Journal of American FoJlc-lorc, edited by W. W. 
Newell, devotes much space in each number to bibliography. Branches 
of the American Folk-lore Society are the Louisiana Association of 
the American "Folk-lore Society and the Boston Association of the 
American Folk-lore Society. An independent organizati<m is the Chi- 
cago I'olk-lore Society, and there is also a folk-lore section of the 
Museum of Arclneology of the University of Pennsylvania. 

Tlie nu'cting of the International Folk-lore Congress, at Burlington 
House, London, in October, and the third annual meeting of the Amer- 
ican Folk-lore Society in Washington in December, were important 
events in the e\olution of that science. Regarding folk-lore as the 
arclmeology of thought and custom, the presidents of both gatherings 
dwelt on the fact that the mere dilettante collecting stage had now 
been passed and folk-lorists were engaged in a serious business. 



460 SUMMARY OF PROGRESS IN ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1891. 

The science of folk-lore has been very much streugtheiied in Ger- 
mauy by the founding of Zeitschrift des Vereins fur Yolkslcunde, which 
is a new branch of Lazarus and Stanthal's Zeitschrift fiir ViilkcrpHy- 
choliMjie mid Sprachwissenschaft. The carefully prepared bibliography 
of journals and other works relating to this science accompanying each 
number obviate the necessity of repeating here the title of every paper 
that has appeared on this subject. 

The friends of the study of comparative religion conducted in the 
University of Pennsylvania a loan collection of objects used in reli- 
gious ceremonies, including charms and implements used in divina- 
tion. The basis of the exhibition was a collection of Oriental idols 
of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church of the 
United States. This is, so far as reported, the first attempt to set up an 
exhibition of this kind, and could be repeated in almost every city of 
the United States Avith happy results, not only with religious objects, 
but also to illustrate any class of anthropological concepts. 

The lectures of Count Goblet d'Alviella on the origin and growth of 
the conception of God as illustrated by anthropology and history, in 
the Hibbert Course for 1891, deiine the limits within which the study 
of religion may be (considered a part of the natural history of man. 
In these summaries the subject has been made to include the creeds 
and cults of men and of the world. From the side of the spirit world, 
the study has been called daimonology, but this term is entirely too 
narrow. Count d'Alviella employs the word " hierography " as includ- 
ing the study of both creeds and cults. The elements common to all 
organized religions are: 

(1) The belief in the existence of superhuman beings who intervene 
in a mysterious manner in the destinies of man and the course of nature. 

(2) Attempts to draw near to these beings or to escape from them, 
to forecast the object of their intervention and the form it will take, or 
to modify their action by conciliation or compulsion. 

(3) Eecourse to the mediation of certain individuals su])posed to 
have special qualiflcations for success in such attempts. 

(4) The placing of certain customs under the sanction of super- 
human powers. 

Primarily, religion is defined as "the conception man forms of his 
relations with the superhuman and mysterious powers on which he 
believes himself to deijend." Further on and growing out of this con- 
ception are '' the acts which man's ^nimitive conception of superhuman 
beings and his relation with them lead him to perform." 

Commencing with primitive animism, these conceptions have arisen 
through polydemonism and polytheism, through dualism to monotheism. 
The outlook in this author's mind is most cheering. On the other hand, 
the teachings of the lilcole d' Anthropologic are to theeifect that under 
the clear light of science all religions will be banished from the world.

THE MOUNDS OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY, HISTORICALLY 

CONSIDERED.* 



By LuciEN Cakr. 



In ji paper upon the Prehistoric Remains of Kentucky, published in 
the fust vohiuie of these memoirs, I have expressed the opinion that it 
was impossible to distinguish between a series of stone implements 
taken from the moumds in the Mississippi Valley and a similar series 
made and used by the modern Indians. In fact, so alike are these 
objects in conception and execution that any attempt to distinguish 
tliem, based upon form or finish, must be but the merest guesswork. 
From the rude knife to the carved and polished " gorget " they may, 
one and all, have been taken from the inmost recesses of a mound or 
l)ickcd np on the snrface amid the debris of a recent Indian village, 
and the most experienced archaeologist, if called upon to decide as to 
their origin, would have to acknowledge himself at fault.t Nor does 
this similarity stop Avith objects made of stone. On the contrary, it is 
believed to extend to all the articles, of every kind whatsoever, that 
have thus far been taken from the mounds. Indeed, I might even go 
fnrtlier, and as the result of some years of work, as well in the field as 
in the library, venture the assertion that not only has there not as yet 
been anything taken from the mounds indicating a higher stage of de- 
velopment than the red Indian of the United States is known to have 
reached, but tliat even the mounds themselves, and under this head 
are included all the earthworks of the Mississippi Valley, were quite 
within the limits of his efforts. 

This coni'lnsion, together with its corollary as to the origin of these 
structures, is neither new nor original; and yet, in spite of the simple 
explanation it gives of the mound question, or, ])erliaps, it might be 
more correct to say on account of this very simplicity, it has made its 
way but slowly. It seems difficult to account for this fact except on

504 THE MOUNDS OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 

the ground that those who have written upon this subject, and who 
have, to a. certain extent, molded pubhc opinion, have approached it 
from one side only. They have usually belonged to the class of prac- 
tical explorers, and have brought to the investigation a certain number 
of facts, chiefly cumulative in character; but they have not, as a rule, 
been possessed of that measure of historical information which is nec- 
essary to a correct interpretation of these facts. Being thus, as it were, 
but half prepared for the work, they have, not unfrequently, given too 
much play to the imagination, and carried their theories much farther 
than the facts would warrant. Impressed with the size and character 
of these remains, or led astray by certain resemblances, fancied or real, 
to similar objects elsewhere, they have used them as a basis for recon- 
structing a phase of civilization to which, in point of religious, artistic, 
and political development, they declare the Indian to have been un- 
equal. From these extreme views there has always been more or less 
dissent.* Even Mr. Squier, who, in his famous work " Tlie Ancient 
Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, " makes no distinction in these 
remains, but speaks of the Mound-builders as an "extinct race,"t and 
contrasts their progress in the arts with the low condition of the mod- 
ern Indians, | is obliged, in a subsequent publication, to modify his 
views and draw a line of demarkation between the earth-works ot 
western New York and those found in southern Ohio, especially those 

* "They" (the earthworks) "differ less in kiud. than in degree from otherremaius 
respecting which history has not been entirely silent : '" Haven in vol. viii of the 
Smithcnian Contributions, -p. 158. "There is nothing, indeed, in the magnitude 
and structure of our Western mounds which a semihunter and semiagricultural 
population, like that which may be ascribed to the ancestors or Indian predecessors 
of the existing race, could not have executed:" SclioolcrofVa Indian Tribes of the 
Uiiited Stat(:f<,\o\.i,\).Q2. "All these earthworks — and I am inclined to assert the 
same of the whole of those iu the Atlantic States and the majority in the Mississippi 
Valley — were the production not of some mythical tribe of high civilization in re- 
mote antiquity, but of the identical nations found by the whites residing in these 
re-nons:" Brintou, Floridian Peninsula, p. 176: Phihideli)hia, 1859. "No doubt that 
they were erect'^d by the forefathers of the present Indians, as places of refuge 
against the incursions of their enemies, and of security for their women and children 
when they were compelled to leave them for the duties of the chase:" Gen. Lewis 
Cass, in North Anicrivan Eeview for .January, 1826. " Nothing in them which may 
not have been performed by a savage people :" Gallatin, in Arclucologia Americana 
vol. II, J). 149. "The old idea that the Mound-builders were peoples distinct from 
and other than the Indians of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and tlieir pro- 
genitors, appears unfounded in fact, and fanciful:" C. C. Jones, in North American 
Eeview for .January, 1874, p. 80. "Mound-builders were tribes of American Indians 
of the same race with the tribes now living: " M. F. Force at the Congn^s Interua- 
fcional des Amcricanistes: Luxembourg, 1877. "The progress of discover^' seems 
constantly to diminish the distinction between the ancient and modein races ; and 
it may not be very wide of the truth to assert that they were the same jicople : "

whicli lie styles religious or "sacred iuclosures." The former of these, 
he thinks, Avere erected l)y the recent Indians, and he supports this 
view by a chain of reasoning- that is believed to be unanswerable. In 
it he institutes a comparison between the " relics of art and traces of 
occupancy" found within them, and those which mark the sites of 
towns and forts that are known to have been occupied by the Indians, 
and pronounces them to be identical. To this powerful argument, 
drawn from what may, not inaptly, be termed the facts of the mound, 
he adds very copious notes as to the origin and use of such structures 
among the people of all ages and countries, thougli, of course, with 
special reference to those that are known to have been erected by the 
American Indians. In this historical retrospect he permits the facts 
to speak for themselves with most commendable impartiality, even 
though, as he frankly admits, they led to the conclusion, little antici- 
pated when he started on the trij) of exjdoration, " that the earth-works 
of western ISew York were erected by the Iroquois or their western 
neighbors, and do not possess an antiquity going far back of the dis- 
covery." * 

To this conclusion, so far as it goes, I certainly do not object. Un- 
fortunately, ho^^'ever, it stops short of the mark ; and this is the more 
to be regretted, inasmuch as it is believed that the line of argument 
by which Mr. Squier convinced himself that the defensive works of 
western New York were erected by the modern Indians would, if it had 
been applied to the earth- works of the Mississippi Valley of every kind 
whatsoever — to the so-called sacred iuclosures not less than to the 
liill forts — have led him to precisely the same conclusion. The two 
propositions rest upon essentially the same foundation, and, as we 
shall see later on, must stand or fall together. 

Before beginning this task, however, it may be well to premise that 
it is not intended, in the course of this investigation, to assert that the 
mounds were built by any particular tribe or tribes of Indians, or at 
any ]»articnlar time; neither is it claimed that each and every tribe 
living within the Mississippi Talley erected such structures. So far 
as my present imrpose is concerned, they may have been built by any 
tribe that can be shown to have occupied the regions where they are 
ound, and at any time during the period of such occupancy. All that 
I intend to assert is, that, admitting everything that can be reasonably 
claimed by the most enthusiastic advocate of the suj)erior civilization 
of the ]Mound-builders, there is no reason why the red Indians of the 
Mississip})! Valley, judging from what we know, historically, of their 
develoi)nient, could not have thrown up these works. This proposition 
is not as complete as could be desired, and yet it probably embodies 
all that can ever be proven on this subject. Ability and performance

do not iilways go liaiul in liaiid, an<l the fact that a people coukl nave 
executed a piece of work does not, l)y any means, authorize the con- 
chision that they did so. Between the two there is, logically speaking, 
a wide gulf which can only be successfully passed by a resort to what 
is known as the law of probabilities. This is unfortunate, but under 
the circumstances it is unavoidable; and although it will, unquestion- 
ably, cause our conclusion to lack somewhat of the force of a scientific 
demonstration, yet it is believed that after making all due allowance, 
there will remain such a volume of evidence in favor of our iH'opositiou 
as to justify a favorable decision. In all human i^robability it will 
never be known who built these mounds in the same sense in which it 
is known who built Westminster Abbey; but if it can be demonstrated 
that the people who erected them were in the same (neolithic) stage 
of civilization that the Indians are known to have attained, and if 
further, it can be shown on undoubted historic authority that these 
Indians built both mounds and earth-works, which differ in degree but 
not in kind from similar structures that are assumed to have been the 
work of an extinct people, whom we have called the Mound-builders, 
then it must be acknowledged that a strong argument is made out in 
favor of the identity of the origin of the two systems of works. To 
reject this conclusion without some positive evidence to the contrary 
would involve as great an absurdity as it w^ould be to maintain, 
supposing all record of the fact to be lost, that Westminster Abbey 
was built by a people belonging to a different race from that which is 
known, formerly, to have lived in London, and for no better reason 
than because the English of to-day have ceased to build such abbeys. 
This much being premised, we are now ready to take uj) the thread 
of our investigation; and by way of beginning, let us examine into the 
accounts, given by the early writers, of the mode of life and the civil 
and religious j)olity of the Indians in order to find out wliether there is 
anything that would lead us to conclude, a priori, that it was impossi- 
ble for them to have erected these works. On the part of those who 
hold affirmative views on this point, it is contended that a system of 
works of the si/e, say of those in the Scioto Valley, would have re- 
quired the united labor of many persons for a long period of time, and 
that as the Indians were hunters — not agriculturists, — and averse to 
labor, they could not have carried it on, for the reason that, owing to 
their wandering and j)recarious mode of life, the means of subsistence 
would have failed them, even if there had been some central authority, 
or some controlling motive strong enough to impel them to the under- 
takiiig.* This is l)elieved to be a foir statement of the argument, and 
if well founded, it would be decisive of the matter. Upon examina-

tioii however it will be seen that it is based upon the assumi^tion that 
the Mouiul-buiklers were an agricultural people, and lived under a 
strongly centralized form of government, no matter whether that gov- 
ernment was one of force, or of opinion founded upon policy or religion. 
This assumption is probably not far from the truth; but to have auj^ 
Aveight in this discussion, it must carry with it, as a correlative, the 
further admission that the Indian was not an agriculturist, and was 
not sul)ject to any such central authority, or controlled by any such 
impelling motive. This of course is not admitted, and it is jn'ecisely 
upon these points that the issue is to be joined. 

I. — THE INDIAN AS AN AGRICULTURIST. 

Taking up, in their order, therequirenrents that are admitted to have 
been possessed by the builders of these mounds, and which are popu- 
larly supposed to have been wanting in the Indian, Ave are met, first of 
all, with the statement, nuide either directly or by implication, that he 
was not an agriculturist, but depended almost entirely upon the chase 
for the means of subsistence. * True, there exists a vague notion that 
succotash and hominy were not unknown in the aboriginal cuisine, and 
there may be those of us who are suflBciently skilled in culinary mat- 
ters to say that these succulent dishes are made of Indian corn ; but 
of the substantial truth of the above statement there is little or no 
doubt, even among those who have taken the trouble to write on the 
subject. Exactly why this is so, when all the records tell us that the 
early colonists in New England, Virginia, and elsewhere throughout 
the eastern portion of the United States owed their lives, on more than 
one occasion, to the timely supplies of corn begged, bought, or stolen, 
from the iiatives,t is something of a mystery, though perhaps it is

if any be needed, for going into the matter somewhat in detail. For- 
tunately, the material for this purpose is quite abundant, and the tes- 
timony so uniform that of the main fact — the cultivation of corn in 
greater or less quantities by all the tribes living east of the Mississippi 
and south of the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes — there can not be a 
shadow of doubt.t All the early writers are agreed upon the point, 
and there is no room for a difference of opinion, except, perhaps, 
in regard to the amount grown. Upon this point, too, the evi- 
dence is explicit. Instead of cultivating it in small patches as a 
summer luxury, it can be shown, on undoubted authority, that every- 
where, within the limits named, the Indian looked upon it as a staple 
article of food, both in summer and winter; that he cultivated it in

that even with the rude and imperfect implements at liis disposal,! he

circumstances it would only be necessary to establish this fact in order 
to prove, beyond cavil, tliat the red Indian was an agriculturist in the 
very highest acceptation of that term, and that in this respect, at least, 
he stood upon the same footing as the mound-builders. In the present 
instance however this is not the case. Not only is it not sufficient to 
prove that tlie Indians were husbandmen in order to raise them to this 
level, but we are called upon to show that among them the men labored 
in the fields as well as the women. Indeed, we are told by a writer, 
from whom 1 differ witli many misgivings, that in this respect there 
was a very great difference between the mound builders and the recent 
Indians; and although the difference is said not to l)e absolute, yet it

to. But this mode of procedure would not answer the purposes of this 
inquiry, and hence I am induced to accord tliem a more respectful con- 
sideration; and I do this the more willingly inasmuch as it agrees with 
my general plan of admitting everything that can be reasonably claimed 
in behalf of the mound-builders, whilst at the same time it affords an 
opportunity of examining into the correctness of the usually received 
opinion "that the Indian considered labor as derogatory, and left it to 
the women."* 

Before beginning this branch of the inquiry, however, it is necessary 
to come to some understanding as to tlie meaning to be given to the 
word ''labor," otherwise we shall be at cross-purposes throughout the 
whole of the investigation. Used in its broadest sense, the term includes 
hunting and fishing — occupations which undoubtedly belonged to the 
men, and which, when followed, not as a pastime, but for the purpose of 
gaining a subsistence, involved labor of the very hardest kind.f If to 
this it be added that the Indian warrior was expected to do all the 
fighting, it will be seen that, at a very moderate estimate, he had work 
enough on his hands to keep him reasonably busy. As an evidence of 
the absorbing nature of these occupations, it may be said that, to-day, 
in some countries of Continental Europe in which the state of war is 
the exception and not the rule, as it was among the Indians, the per- 
formance of the one duty of military service alone is considered to be 
a sufficient reason for withdrawing all able-bodied males, within certain 
ages, from every kind of productive labor during the term of such ser- 
vice, even though the whole of it be passed in a time of profound peace. 
Among these nations, and they are some of the most highly civilized 
in Europe, it is no exaggeration to say that labor, using that word in its 
broadest sense, is left to the women far more completely than it ever 
was among the Indians; for the Indian, when not actually engaged in 
warfare, did hunt and fish, and contribute to this extent, at least, to 
the general welfare, whilst his European counterpart is not allowed to 
engage in productive labor of any kind whatsoever during his term of 
military service. But there is another and a narrower sense, in which 
the word is taken to mean simply field-work, or work necessary to the 
growth and production of corn; and it is this signification that is

usually given to it bj' writers on this subject, and it is in this sense tbat 
it will be hereafter used in the course of this investigation. Substi- 
tuting, then, the more specialized form of expression for the general 
term, and the sentence will read as follows: Among the Indians field- 
work was considered derogatory, and left to the women. In this re- 
stricted shape the statement is not so objectionable; and yet, even in 
this form, it is believed to be altogether too sweeping. That in some 
particular years this work may, from some cause, have been left to the 
women, is of course very probable — the necessities of war or the chase 
might at any time render this unavoidal:)le in any tribe; and it may 
also be true that in the division of labor between the sexes, made nec- 
essary by the duty of providing for the family, this share, among cer- 
tain tribes, fell to her lot; but tliat it was either onerous,* or compul- 
sory,t or that the custom, if such it can be called, was general, or that 
it was adhered to very strictly, even among the tribes in which it can 
be said to have prevailed, is not for a moment admitted. Take for 
example the Iroquois or Six Nations, the only people among whom, so 
far as I know, it can not be shown that the warriors did take some part 
either in clearing the ground or in cultivating the crop, and we find 
that even among them the work was not left exclusively to the women, 
but that it was shared by the children and the old men, as well as the 
slaves, of whom they seem to have had a goodly number. | Singularly 
enough, too, the reason given by the old chronicler why the men took

no part in the labor, /. e., because "they wpre always at war or hunt- 
ingV is the same that is to-day made to do duty in justifying the exist- 
ence of a similar condition of affairs among people who boast not a 
little of their civilization. 

Among most of the other tribes north of the Ohio and sonth of the St. 
Lawrence, Huron as well as Algonquin, the men not only habitually 
cleared the ground* — no small undertaking, be it understood, in a 
heavily-timbered region — but they frequently took xiart in what is 
technically known as " working" the crop, and also aided in the labors 
of the harvest field. This may not have been a part of their duty, but 
we have the authority of Charlevoix for saying that when asked to aid 
in gathering the crop '' they did not scorn to lend a helping hand."t 

On this point, liowever, it is necessary to make haste slowly, as our 
guides not only contradict each other, but are very often at odds with 
themselves, and it requires some judgment to pick our way amid the 
conflicting statements. As an instance of some of the least of the dif- 
ficulties that beset out path at this stage of the inquiry, let us take the 
younger Bartram, whose account of his travels among the Indians of 
the Gulf States is one of the most trustworthy that has come down to 
us. Time and again, in the course of his narrative, he speaks of the 
part taken by the men in the work of raising corn,| and yet, on page 513, 
he tells us that they " perform nothing except erecting their mean, 
habitations, forming their canoes, stone pipes, tambour, eagle's tail, or 
standard, and some other trifling matters, for war and hunting are 
their principal employments." In Vander Donck's Few ^Netherlands 
there is an instance even more to the point, though it is no means an 
extreme case. On one page he tells us that the Indians "subsist by 
hunting and fishing throughout the year," having apparently forgotten 
that in a previous chapter he had said that "mush or s«^ae?i" was 
their common food, and that they rarely pass a day without it unless 
they are on ajourney or hunting.§ Strictly speaking, the statements

in tlio first of these instances are not contradictory, for our author is 
speaking of manufactures when he says the men do "nothing, etc.;" 
and it is possible, in that latitude, for a man to raise a crop of corn and 
work it well too, and yet spend the most of his time hunting- and 
fighting. To admit this however is to credit the old chroni(;ler with 
a degree of refinement in the use of language to which he is believed to 
have been an utter stranger. In the second instance, there is no room 
for any such compromise. The two statement conflict, and can not be 
reconciled by any amount of verbal hair spitting. In neither case, be it 
observed, do the facts justify the inference that the field-work was left 
exclusively to the women, as that conclusion is manifestly impossible, 
so long as it is admitted that the men took any part in tlie labor, be it 
ever so small, at any stage of the process; and yet it is precisely upon 
these and similar statements that this conclusion is based. Without 
stopping now to inquire into the rationale of these contradictions, some- 
times only apparent, but often very real, it will be sufiicient to say that 
tliey have not sprung from any wish to mislead, but have rather grown 
out of tin i fact that when these old writers began to generalize, they 
fell into the common error of failing to make du allowance for the 
many exceptions to the rule they were laying down. In all such cases 
rlie true way out of tlie difficulty is not to accept one statement to the 
exclusion of the other; neither will it aid us to ofl'set one by the other, 
and so reject both, but rather we ought to qualify the general coiiclu- 
sion by the exceptions, and thus bring it within the bounds marked 
out by the facts. Believing this to be the true method of pursuing 
this investigation, it will be incumbent on me to examine into tlie his- 
tory of each tribe or group of tribes separately, in order to find out 
whether the men, i. e., the warriors, took any part in the field-work, 
and if so, to what extent. If, in the course of the inquiry, it should be 
shown that, in any tribe, at any time, the men did take some part in 
this work, no matter how insignificant it may have been, then it is 
evident that at that time, in that particular tribe, the field-work was 
not left exclusively to the women, whatever may be said to the con- 
trary by the author who tells the story. It nuist not however be for- 
gotten that although this statement as to the actual condition of a 
large majority of the tribes living east of the Mississippi and south of 
tlic St. Lawrence is believed to be true, yet it is not denied that there 
were many instances in which this labor was practically left to the 
women, owing to the fact that the men were away from home hunting 
or tigiiting. This fact was unfortunately of frequent recurrence; but 
as it was the result of an accidental and not of a permanent condition 
of affairs, it would hardly be fair to ascribe it to the existence of any 
cnstom or to any belief in the derogatory character of the work. 

P)Oginning witli the llurons, of Canada, we find that in A. D. 1035 a 
band of the Iroquois branch of that family was living in the stockaded

village of Hoclielaga, now Montreal. According to Cartier * "they had 
good and large fields full of corn, - - - which they preserved in 
garrets at the top of their houses." He also tells us that they are 
" given to husbaudrie, - - - but are no men of great labor; and 
that they digge their ground with certain pieces of wood as big as 
halfe a sword, on which ground groweth their corne." The women 
are said "to work more than the men - - - in tilling and hus- 
banding the ground." Champlain,t A. D. 1610, speaking of this same 
family of tribes, especially of those living north of the St. Law- 
rence, and in the peninsula lying between lakes Huron, Erie, and 
Ontario, repeats, substantially, what is said about their houses and 
fortified villages,| and adds that most of them cultivated corn, which 
was their principal article of food, and which they also exchanged for 
skins with the hunter tribes living to the north. They stored it in the 
tops of their houses, and cultivated it in quantities, so that they might 
have on hand a supply large enough to last three or four years, in case 
of the failure of the crops in some bad season.§ The women are said to 
have cultivated the ground and planted corn, whilst the men hunted, 
fished, went to war, and built their cabins. When this was done, they 
went off on trading expeditions among other tribes, sometimes extend- 
ing their trips to the distance of 400 or 500 leagues. All this is con- 
firmed by Sagard,|l who adds some interesting details as to the tenure of 
lands ^ and the method of cultivating the corn. He also tells us that 
the men cleared the ground, and that this was done with great difficulty, 
as they had no suitable implements with which to work. This process 
was the same among all the Indian tribes, and as it is practically in

use to-day by the Avhite settlers on our frontiers, his siceount of it is 
traushited in full. "The Indians," he says, "belt (coupent) the trees 
about 2 or 3 feet from the ground, then they trim off all the branches 
and burn them at the foot of the tree in order to kill it, and afterwards 
they take away the roots. This being done, the women carefully clean 
uji the ground between the trees, and at every step they dig a round 
hole, in which they sow 9 or 10 grains of maiz, which they have first 
carefully selected and soaked for some days in water."* 

Among the Iroquois or Six Nations, after they took up their residence 
in western New York, our accounts are not less full and explicit. 
Those grim warriors, thanks to the ill-advised interference of Cham- 
plain (A. D. 1G09-'10), in their quarrel with the Adirondacks, lived in 
a chronic state of hostility to the French, whose pathway to the 
Oino they effectually barred.t Expeditions were repeatedly fitted out 
against them, but always with the same barren results. A few villages 
were burned, sometimes by the savages themselves, to prevent their 
falling into the hands of the whites, and the adjacent corn-fields were 
destroyed; but the power of the confederacy remained unbroken. 
Champlain began this system of destructive inroads at an early period; 
in 1087 Denonville improved upon his teaching, and later on, in A. D. 
1770, the Americans took up the work and showed themselves to be 
apt scholars. In this year Gen. Sullivan, at the head of an American 
army, invaded their country, and is said to have destroyed 100,000 
bushels of corn, and to have cut down in one orchard alone 1,500 apple 
trees.J Large as was the amount of property destroyed at this time, it 
was but a fraction of the destruction wrought by the French under 
Denonville in 1G87. In the course of that one invasion four villages

was standing in tlie fields, 400,000 minots or 12,00,000 bnsliels of grain 
were destoyed.* This amount is doubtlessly mucli exaggerated, but 
that it was very large is evident from the statements of Tontit and La 
Hon tan, I both of whom took part in the expedition. According to the 
former, they were for seven days engaged in cutting up the corn belong- 
ing to the four villages. The latter author puts the time consumed in 
this work at five or six days, and by way of sliowing the uselessness of 
such destruction, he makes one of their Indian allies remark rather cyn- 
ically that "the Tsonnontonans did not matter the spoiling of the corn 
for that the other Iroquois nations were able to supply them." These 
extracts will give some idea of the extent to which corn was grown 
among these tribes,§ and will justify the use of much stronger language 
than Mr. Morgan employs when he declares that "it can not be affirmed 
with correctness that the Indian subsisted principally by the chase." || 

As to the manner of preserving or storing this grain for winter use, 
we are not left in the dark. In addition to the garrets or tops of their 
houses and cribs,^ they were in the habit of " burying their surplus corn 
and also their charred green corn in caches^ in which the former would 
preserve uninjured through the year, and the latter for a much longer 
period. They excavated a pit, made a bark bottom and sides, and hav- 
ing deposited the corn within it, a bark roof, water-tight, was con- 
structed over it, and the whole covered up with earth."** 

In regard to the field-work, the weight of evidence inclines to the con- 
clusion that, ever since the arrival of the whites, it has been in the 
hands of the women and slaves, and that the warriors took no part in it, 
neither working the crop, nor clearing the land, as their congeners in

Canada were in tlie habit of doin^-. Colden* and others t assert this 
positively, and Gen. Ely S, Parker, liiniselt'an educated Irocpiois, eon- 
firms the statement in an interesting' letter which I take the liberty of 
publisliing entire: "I do not tliink that tlte Iroquois men, at the time 
to which you refer, ever aided in any agricultural operations whatever. 
Among all the Indian tribes, especially the more powerful ones, the 
principle that a man should not demean himself or mar his dignity by 
cultivating the soil or gathering its product was most strongly incul- 
cated and enforced. It was taught that a man's province Avas war, 
hunting, and fishing. While the pursuit of agriculture, in any of its 
branches, was by no means x>rohibited, yet, when any man, excepting 
the cripples, old men, and those disabled in war or hunting, chose to till 
the earth, he Avas at once ostracised from men's society, classed as a 
woman or squaw, and was disqualified from sitting or speaking in the 
councils of his people until he had redeemed himself by becoming a 
skillful warrior or a successful hunter. At the present day even, some 
of the Avestern tribes require that one shall also prove himself an ex- 
l^ert thief or robber to entitle him to respect and consideration. It is 
Avitliin my recollection that a very large proportion of the Iroquois men 
did no manual labor Avhatsoever, because as they argued it was menial 
and beneath their dignity. It is only quite recently that agricultural 
Avork by men has become general among this people, and not yet are 
women driven altogether from the field. 

"It Avas an Iroquois custom to use captives to assist their women in 
the labors of the field, in carrying burdens, and in doing general menial 
labor; but when a captive proved himself possessed of what, in their 
judgment, constituted manly (pialities, then he was fully adox^ted and 
admitted to all the i^rivileges of an Iroquois. 

"You may jiossibly call to mind that Brant, the elder, a great Iro- 
quois Avarrior, and Ked Jacket, the Iroquois orator, Avere not good 
ftiends. One Avas renowned both in war and council, and his voice 
Avas ever for war; Avhile the other was famous only in council; his 
voice Avas always for x)eace, and in no sense was he a Avarrior. In a 
general council of the magnates of the Six Nations, held at the time of 
the Miami difficulties in the Northwest, Brant, in a controversy Avith 
Red Jacket, in which, i)erhaps, he was being Avorsted, taunted him 
with being a coward and a squaw, showing how strong had been his 
early education respecting the qualities essential to a representative 
Iroquois.

Nations, wlieie tribes of ludiaus were, or had been, subjugated by the 
Iroquois, and reduced to tlie condition of women, and were formally 
prohibited from engaging in any warlike enterprises, and were en- 
joined to spend their time and energies in tilling the earth, and the 
Iroquois were accustomed to express themselves respecting such sub- 
jugated tribes like this : 'We have put petticoats upon them,' which 
meant that thereafter they were reipiired to do only servile work. 
This in my opinion was another evidence that anciently the Iroquois 
men did not do any agricultural labor," 

Per contra, Charlevoix* speaks of a tradition current among them, to 
the effect that, formerly — before their arrival in New York — they were 
almost exclusively occupied in husbandry, and were bound to furnish a 
part of their harvest to the Algouquins, wlio in their turn agreed to 
supply them with a certain share of the products of the chase, and to 
defend them against all enemies whatsoever. He adds that this arrange- 
ment was very advantageous to both parties, but that in the estimation 
of the Indians it caused the Algouquins to rank higher than the Iro- 
quois, for the reason that among them a successful hunter is on a level 
with a great warrior, and inferentially both take precedence of a hus- 
bandman. This however is but tradition, and is given for what it is 
worth, though it is projier to say that Charlevoix introduces it with the 
remark that it is the only part of Iroquois history that has come down 
to us clothed with any appearance of probability, and that both Col- 
dent and Morgan| give place to the story. Without stopping now to 
inquire into its truth or falsity, we may be very sure that during the 
whole of the seventeenth and part of the eighteenth centuries, the Iro- 
quois warrior had but little time to devote to agriculture. What with 
fighting the French and Hurons on the north ; the Miamis and Illinois 
on the west; the Cherokees, Catawbas, and Shawnees on the south, to 
say nothing of his immediate neighbors in New England on the east, 
it would seem as if his hands were so full as to leave but little time for 
hunting, much less for raising corn; and that under the circumstances 

* Charlevoix Letters, pp. 124, et seq.: Loudon, 1763. La Potherie tells the same 
story, but gives it as a fact. See Ilistorie de V Amenque, vol. i, pp. 188, et seq.: Paris, 
1753. The same author, vol. in, p. 18, asserts that the men did clear the ground, 
fence iu the fields, and prepare the bunches of corn for drying. He also adds that 
when husband and wife are much attached to each other, they do not separate their 
work, though ordinarily they do not cencern themselves about each other's duties. 
Lafitau, vol. ii, p. 78, says that the men braided the corn into bunches, and adds that 
it is the only occasion on which the women call on the men for help. 

t"The Adirondacks - - - employed themselves wholly in hunting, and the 
Five Nations made planting of corn their business. By this means they became useful 
to each other by exchanging corn for venison. The Adirondacks, however, valued 
themselves as delighting in a more manly employment, and despising the Five Nations 
in following business which they thought only fit for women." History of the Five 
Nations, p. 22 : London, 1747. 

t "Tradition informs us that, prior to the occupation of New York, they resided 
in the vicinity of Montreal, upon the northern bank of the St. Lawrence, where

'^tlie plantation work," as the old chronicler has it, must have been 
"left to the women and slaves" as a matter of necessity.* 

As might have been expected in a people who had developed such 
capacity for the management of military and political affairs, we find 
that the ideas of property had taken definite shape, and that the rights 
of individnals were duly respected. In fact, some of their regulations, 
notably those in relation to the property of married women, t might be 
copied Avith advantage in some of the States of our favored Eepublic, 
In regard to the tenure of land, we are told that no individual could 
obtain an absolute title, "but he could reduce unoccui)ied lands to cul- 
tivation to any extent he pleased; and so long as he continued to use 
them, his right to their enjoyment was protected and secured. He could 
also sell his improvements or bequeath them to his wife and children. | 

Turning now to the tribes of the Algonquin family, and beginning 
with those that lived south of the St. Lawrence and east of the Hudson, 
we can not but be struck with the similarity of their condition to that 
which, as we have seen, existed among the Hurons. Champlain,§ who 
Visited this coast in the early ])art of the seventeenth century, found 
corn in cultivation from the " Kinnebequy" to Cape Mallebarre, near 
the southeastern extremity of Cape Cod. At Chacouet (Saco) he saw 
the natives cultivating the ground, "which was a thing he had not 
seen before, using for that puri)ose small imijlements of hard wood made 
lilce a spade." In the neighborhood of Cape Mallebarre they are said 
to have been very industrious ("fort amateurs du labourage") and to 
have provided a sui)ply of corn for winter use, which they stored in 
caches. 1 1 They lived in stockaded forts,^ and made slaves of theiv pris- 



tliey lived in subjection to the Adiroudjicks, a branch of the Algonquin race."

oners, espcciiilly of tlie women unci cliildren,* us was the custom among 
other tribes belonging to this family.t lu 1G14 Capt. Smith explored 
this coast, and makes mention of "the gardens and cornfields which 
he saw planted on those sandy chffs and cliffs of rocks." | He also bears 
witness to the quantities of corn grown in that region when he under- 
takes for a few trifles, "to have enough from the salvages for three 
hundred men" until the colony should become self-supporting.§ Roger 
Williams, A. u. 1643, on the same subject says "that the women of the 
family commonly raise two or three heaps of 12, 15, or 20 bushels a 
heap, - - - and if she have the help of her children or friends, as 
much more." He also adds, that "sometimes the man himself (either 
out of love to his Avife or care for his children, or being an old man) 
will help the women, which, by the customs of the country, they are 
not bound to. When a field is to be broken up they have a very loving, 
sociable, speedy way to dispatch it; all the neighbors, men and women, 
forty, fifty, a hundred, do joyne and come in to help freely. With 
friendly joyning they break up their fields and build tlieir forts." || 
Among themselves they bartered their corn, skins, and venison,^ and 
they also carried on more or less trade with other nations in shell beads** 
(wampum), and also in pipes, which latter article is said usually "to 
come from the Mauquaw wop tt or man-eaters, three or four hundred miles 
from us." The right of property was recognized in land,Jt and their

Among the tribes living in southeastern Xew York, and along the 
Hudson, there does not seem to have been any lack of corn. Hudson, 
A. D. 1009, states that in latitude 42^ 18', near Avhere the town bearing 
his name now stands, he saw "a house which contained a great quan- 
tity of maize or Indian corn and beans of last year's growth, and there 
lay near the house for the purpose of drying enough to load three ships, 
besides what was growing in the fields." | 

The work of tilling the ground Mas left to the women, who had the 
assistance of the old men and the children.§ The M'arriors are said to 
have been extravagantly in(;lined to hunting and fishing,|| though De- 
Laet tells us that '^ they are very serviceable, and allow themselves to 
be employed in many things for quite a small compensation.^ They 
lived in stockaded villages, and had forts or castles near their corn 
grounds for refuge in case of the sudden irruption of small marauding 
l)arties of their enemies."** 

^TcAv Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania were inhabited, in part, by 
different bands of the same tribes that held the country adjacent to the 
mouth of the Hudson, They occui)i('d both banks of the Delaware or 
" iSouth " river, lived in forts,tt and raised corn and beans, which they 
sold to the Swedish and German settlers.|| Later, about the year 1682,

William Penn found the Delawares aud Shawnees* still occupying tliis 
region, and it was with them that he concluded the famous treaty of 
which it has been said that it is the only one ever made that was not 
ratified by an oath, aud that it is the only one that was never broken. 
Speaking of their manner of life, he says that •■' their diet is maize or 
Indian corn, divers ways prepared; sometimes roasted in the ashes, 
sometimes beaten and boiled with water, which they call hominy." t 
Loskiel, A. d. 1788, takes up the story, and tells us that corn was the 
chief product of their plantations.! He also says that " the men hunt 
and fish and provide meat for the household, keep their wives and chil- 
dren in clothing, build aud repair the houses or huts, and make fences 
around the plantations, occasionally assisting in the labors of the field 
and garden. § The corn is stowed in caches, and they keep the situa- 
tion of these caches secret, as if found out they would have to supply 
every needy neighbor," This, he adds, " may occasion a famine, for 
some are so lazy that they will not plant at all, knowing that the more 
industrious can not refuse to divide their store with them." || They 
also did more or less barter, especially in pipes, the material for which, 
a red marble, is rare, and found only on the Mississippi. ''A more 
common sort is made of a kind of ruddle dug by the Indians living to 
the west of the Mississii)pi, on the Marble River, who sometimes bring 
it to these countries for sale." ^] 

At this point it seems proper to refer briefly to the fact noticed by 
Gen, Parker, that the Delawares were, at this time, a conquered tribe, 
and held their lands on sufferance. In the figurative language of the 
Indians, the Iroquois had put petticoats on them. Whether this was a 
rhetorical flourish, and merely meant that they had been conquered, or 
whether it was intended to signify that the Delaware warriors had been 
forbidden to take part in manly pursuits, and were restricted to the 
occupations usually followed by the women, I am not piepared to say. 
That they were forbidden to dispose of the land they occui^ied is clear 
from the speech of Canassatego, an Iroquois sachem, at the treaty of 
Lancaster, A, D. 1744;** but, on the other hand, it is equally evident

that the Delaware warrior did not hesitate to go upon the warpath 
whenever it suited his pleasure to do so.* Probably the true explana- 
tion of this seeming inconsistency is to be found in the fact that whilst 
the Delawares, as a tribe, were prohibited from exercising any of the 
rights of an independent people, yet the individual warrior, in the en- 
joyment of that wide personal liberty to which every Indian east of the 
Mississippi seems to have been born, consulted his own convenience as 
to when or with whom he should fight, and when or how, if at all, he 
should aid the women in the work of cultivating the fields. 

In Virginia, among -the tribes composing the Powhatanic confederacy 
and the adjoining nations, corn was raised in great abundance, though 
there were times when, owing to improvidence or a failure of the crops, 
the Indians suffered more or less from want. Capt. Smith, in the course 
of one of the many expeditions made in order to supply the starving 
colonists with food, says that he could have loaded a ship with it;t 
and in his letter to the Queen on the occasion of the visit of the " Lady" 
Pocahontas to England, after acknowledging his personal obligations 
to tliat "tender virgin," he tells us that for two or three years "slice, 
next under God, was still the instrument to jireserve this colonic from 
deathe, famine, and utter confnsion."| We are also told that they had 
stockaded forts, § and that their houses were built in the midst of their 
fields or gardens, "which are small plots of ground," ranging from 20 
to 200 acres. II Each household is said "to know their oAvn lauds and 
gardens, and must live of their own labors ;"f[ and the limits within 

at a conference held at Burlington, in Archa^ologia Americana, vol. ii, p. 48. In this 
connection, and as showing the similiarity of customs among tlie Indians, it is of 
interest to note that the Creeks claimed to have put petticoats upon the Cherokees, 
and at the treaty of Augusta, in reply to the statement of the Georgians "that they 
had hought a certain piece of land from the Cherokees," a Creek chief started to his 
feet, "and, with, an agitated and terrific^ countenance, frowning menaces and dis- 
dain, fixed his eyes on the Cherokee chiefs and asked them what right they liad to 
give away their lands, calling them old women, and saying that they had long ago 
obliged thoni to wear the petticoat." Bartram, Travels through Florida, p. 486: 
Philadelphia, 1791.

which each might "fish, fowle, or hunt" seem to liave been not less 
accurately determined, * As to the part taken by the men in the field 
work, our authorities are not agreed. According to Capt. Smith, who 
is not very clear upon this point, the women plant and gather the corn, t 
though elsewhere he speaks of the "King (Powhatan) himself making 
his own robes, shoes, bowes, arrows, pots, planting, also hunting, and do- 
ing offices no less than the rest." His account of the manner of making 
a " clearing" is also somewhat obscure, and may be interpreted to mean 
that this part of the labor was performed by the men. Be this as it 
may, however, other writers are more exijlicit, Hariot and Beverly 
confirm what is said as to the supply of corn; and the former asserts 
directly, and the latter by implication, that the men did take part in 
the field work.J They also did, more or less, trade among themselves, 
exchanging, among other things, -their "countrie corne" for copper, 
beads, and such like.§ Slavery may also be confidently said to have 
existed among them; for, although the evidence on this point is not as 
full and clear as it might be, yet the fact is plainly deducible from the 
statement that "they made war, not for lands or goods, but for women 
and children, whom they put not to death," but kept as captives, in 
which capacity they were made "to do service." !| 

The Carolinas were lield by a number of tribes belonging to differ- 
ent linguistic families, though with but little or no difference in their 
manners and customs. The Tuscaroras, a Huron tribe, occupied the 
country adjacent to the Chowan River and its tributaries, in the west- 
ern part of North Carolina, until about the year 1713-'15, when, owing 
to their defeat by the whites, and the destruction of their fort, they 
fled to- the north, and took refuge among the Iroquois, forming the 
sixth nation in that confederacy.^ In the western part of South Caro- 
lina lived the Catawbas, who are chiefly known on account of the long

aiKl relentless war wliicU they waged against the Iroqnois. They were 
extensively engaged in growing corn, as Adair speaks of one of their 
old fields that was 7 miles in extent, and argnes that the tribe must 
have been very populous to cultivate so much land witli their dull stone 
axes.* In the interior, and along the coast of these two States, there 
dwelt a number of small tribes, whose names have scarcely come down 
to us. In 1700-01 Lawson travelled through this region, and much that 
we know of the people who then lived here is derived from his narra- 
tive. From it, we learn that they cultivated many kinds of pulse, part 
of which they ate green in sumnier, keeping great quantities for their 
winter supply.t This they stored in cribs or granaries, which were 
sometimes built on 8 feet or posts, about 7 feet high, weM daubed 
witliin and without with loam.| The young men worked the fields, as 
did the slaves, who, we are told, were not overworked.§ The women 
never planted corn as they did among the Iroquois. || There were no 
fences to divide the fields, but " every man knew his own ; and it scarce 
ever happens that they rob one another of so much as an ear of corn, 
which if anyone is found to do, he is sentenced by the elders to work 
and plant for him that was robbed till he is recompensed for all the 
damage he has suffered in his cornfield; and this is punctually per- 
formed, and the thief held in disgrace that steals from any of his coun- 
try-folks."l] In the case of a woman without a husband, and with a 
great many children to maintain, the young men were obliged to plant 
and reap and do everything that she was not capable of doing herself. 
They do not allow any one to be idle, but all must employ themselves 
in some work or other.^ They bartered pipes, wooden bowls, and ladles 
with neighboring tribes for raw skins.** We are also told that the 
poorer sort of white planters often got them to plant, by hiring them 
for til at season, or for so much work.tt 

Of the tribes that inhabited Florida, including under that title 
Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas, and all the Gulf States except Texas, 
our accounts are very full and explicit. From the time of De Soto, 
A. B. 1539, and even earlier,|j: corn was grown everywhere in great 
abundance. Indeed, but for the quantities seized by that adventurer 
during the three or four years he passed in rambling, to and fro, over 
the vast region traversed by him on both sides of the Mississippi, he

could not have subsisted his horde of ruthless followers, with their at- 
tendant trains of captives and domestic animals.* La Vega, Biedma, 
and above all the Knight of Elvas, bear witness to this fact on almost 
every page of their narratives.t We are also told that, on both sides 
of the river, the natives lived in walled towns,| and that they gathered 
every man his own crop,§ which they stored in barbacoas|| or granaries, 
made somewhat like those in Carolina. 

Passiug over an interval of a hundred and fifty or two hundred 
years, and coming down to the eighteenth century, we find the condi- 
tion of affairs in all thai region practically unchanged. The same 
tribes, with scarcely an exception, that held the country east of the 
Mississippi in the time of De Soto still jjossessed it, and lived substan- 
tially within the same boundaries as they did when first visited. In 
the meantime, the Mississippi had been explored from the Falls of St. 
Anthony to its mouth, the French and English had pushed their trad- 
ing posts everywhere throughout the valley, and were contending for 
the possession of all that vast domain ; but the Indians, save when 
brought into immediate contact with the whites, still pursued the even 
tenor of their way, and hunted and fought, danced and worshiped, much 
as their ancestors bad done some two hundred years before. They built 
their houses and fortified their villages in much the same manner,^] and 
cultivated their fields and gardens with the same rude and unsatisfac-

horses." Narrative of Biedma, in Hist, Coll. of Louisiana, part ii, j). 97. This is 
the smallest number given by either one of the chroniclers of this expedition, and it 
is accepted for this reason. It will be seen that no mention is made (»f the drove of 
hogs, though it must have been large, as we are told, I. c, p. 104, that in the at- 
tack made by the Indians on the Spaniards when in winter quarters at Chicafa, 
they destroyed "three hundred hogs," besides fifty-seven horses. The Gentleman 
of Elvas says " fifty horses aud four hundred hogs."

tory implements. * In all this they did not differ from their neighbors 
to the North; in fact, so similar were their forms of government, their 
customs, and their religious beliefs, that, mutatis mutandis, the accounts 
given of the Hurons and Algonquins might, with but little change, be 
applied to the tribes living south of the Ohio, t In one or two particu- 
lars, however, there seems to have been some improvement, notably in 
their organized system of relief for the poor and needy, which seems 
to have existed from the earliest period, | and in the provision, made at 
harvest time for the exercise of tribal hospitality, and for defraying, 
what may be justly termed, public expenditures.§ In their method, 
too, of preventing, or rather, punishing laziness, which they did by 
line,|| they showed an advance in social science that is worthy of all 
commendation. Among them corn was the staple article of food,|f and 
was cultivated in great quantities, their fields not unfrequently being 
measured by miles instead of by acres.** The work was done in com- 
mon, though the fields were divided by proper marks, and the harvest 
was gathered by each family seijarately.tt The men are said to have

t"Caciqnps8 of Cofacliiqni had two storehouses for the relief of the needy:" 
Herrera, vol. v, p. 316: London, 1740. Timherlako, who visited the Cherokees, 
A. i>. 17(il, and accompanied a delegation of them to England, describes their method 
of relieving the poor, which resembles, in some respects, the "begging dance" of 
the Indians of the Plains: Memoirs, p. 6S: London, 1765. 

^S "Previous to their carrying off their crops from the held, there is a large crib 
or granary, erected in the plantation, which is called the King's crib ; and to this 
each family carries and deposits a certain quantity, according to his ability or in- 
clination, or none at all if he so chooses; this in apearance seems a tribute or rcA^e- 
uue tc the mico, but in fact is designed for another puri)ose, i. e., that of a public 
treasury, supplied by a few and voluntary contributions, and to which every citi- 
zen has the right of a free and equal access, when his own private stores are con- 
sumed, to serve as a surplus to lly to for succor, to assist neighboring towns, whose 
crops may have failed, accommodate strangers or travelers, afford provisions or sup- 
plies when they go forth on hostile expeditious, and for all other exigencies of the 
State:" Bartram, Travels throiKjh Florida, p. 512: London, 1791. The Huron-Iro- 
([uois also had a public treasury, which contained wampum, Indian corn, slaves, 
fresh and dried meat, and, in fact, anything else that might serve to defray the 
public expenses. See Lafitau, vol. i, p. 508, and vol. ii, p. 273.

aided in the field-work. Indeed, so general was this custom, that I do 
not know of a single prominent tribe living east of the Mississippi and 
within the limits named, in which this can not be shown to have been 
the case.* The Choctaws, as we have seen, were a nation of farmers, 
and helped their wives in the labors of the field and in many other 
kinds of work ;t the Mnscogees rarely went to war until they had 
helped the women to plant a sufficient plenty of provisions,! and Haw- 
kins tells us that to constitute a legal marriage among them, a man 
must, among other things, " build a house, make his crop, and gather 
it in, then make his hunt, and bring home the meat;" and that when 
all this was put in possession of the wife, the ceremony was ended, or 
as the Indians express it "the woman was bound, and not till then."§ 
Among the Natchez and kindred tribes, the men not only cleared 
the fields and worked the crops,i| but in one field, that in which was 
raised the corn destined for use in the feast of the "Busk" or First 
Fruits, the ground was prepared and cultivated by the warriors alone, 
and the women were not allowed to take any part in the work at any 
stage.^] Slavery was common among all these nations from the earlies 
times, as it was also among tribes belonging to the Huron and Algon- 
quin families of the North, that being the usual lot of the captives, 
especially of the women and children. In the time of De Soto we are 
told that some of these tribes had many "foreign Indian slaves, 
taken in war, whom they put to tilling the ground and other sorts of 
labor; and that they might not run away, they used to cut their heels, 
or some sinews in their legs, so that they were all lame."** At a later 
time, the custom of enslaving captives vStill existed, ft though I do not 
find that they were mutilated in order to prevent their escape. It is 
quite probable however that this was still sometimes done, as Lawson

speaks of an Indian captive who bad been thns treated by the Senecas, 
but who had nevertheless managed to escape and find his way back 
to Xorth Carohna in that crippled condition.* These nations excelled 
in manufactures, such as pipes, pottery, and wickerwork,t and seem 
always to have had more or less traffic among themselves.l Indeed, 
Herrera speaks of "merchants that travelled up the country," andtlie 
experience of Cabe^a de Vaca among- the Indians of Texas, as a dealer 
in flint and other articles, ^vhich he brought from the interior and bar- 
tered with the Indians of the coast, would seem to be decisive as to 
the existence among them of a class of pedlers. § 

Of the tribes that lived on the west bank of the Mississippi, our ac- 
counts are not so fullj but froju what we do know of them, it is safe to 
say that in their manner of life they did not differ materially from 
their neighbors on the other side of the great river. In the time of La 
8alle, A. D. 1G82, they lived in fixed villages (" sedentaires"),|| as they 
had done some hundred and fifty years before, when De Soto swept 
through that country like a tornado, and they still cultivated corn in 
great abundance. tj Peach, plum, and apple trees were found among 
the tribes living near the mouth of the Arkansas;** and these same 
tribes are said to have had great quantities of domestic fowls, including 
flocks of turkeys ; tt in short, to have been " half-civilized." +f As Joutel

^"With my merchandise and trade I went into the interior as far as I pleased, 
and travelled along the coast 40 or 50 leagnes. The jiriucipal wares were cones 
and ofhcr pieces of sea snail, conches nsed for cntting, and frnit like a bean, of the 
highest valno among them, which they use as a medicine, andemploy in their dances

tells us that there was but little diflfereuce in the religion, manners, 
clothing, and houses of the nations inhabiting this region,* it seems 
fair to conclude that the others were not behind the favored few in all 
that contributed to the physical comfort and well-l)eing of a people. 
Their men cleared the ground, and aided in the work of the fields ;t 
and among the Tensas, they had so far anticipated modern methods, 
that in one '' clearing," called by them " the field of the spirit," they 
are said to have worked to the music of the drum.| The labor of the 
fields was done in common, though each family had its own particular 
plot of ground. § The harvest was gathered separately by each family, 
and was stored in magazines, or in large baskets made of cane, or in 
gourds as large as half barrels. || In other respects, too, individual 
rights seem to have been respected.^] Slavery existed among the Tensas 
and other tribes who are said to have had the same customs.** They 
had more or less traffic with other tribes, especially in bows, in the 
manufacture of which the Caddoes are said to have excelled, tt 

Ascending the Mississippi, we find among the Algonquin tribes of 
the Northwest a condition of affairs very similar to that which has been 
described as exi.sting among their kindred and neighbors to the east- 
ward. At the date of the arrival of the French, say in the beginning 
of the last quarter of the seventeenth century, the Miamis, Kickapoos, 
Wiunebagoes, Outagamis or Foxes, and other tribes, were living in 
Wisconsin and the northern part of Illinois, |f whilst all south of that, 
extending as far as the mouth of the Ohio, was held by the Illinois and 
their allies, among whom were a few villages of Shawnees. These lat- 
ter came later, having established themselves here upon the invitation 
of La Salle, §§ though the home of their tribe is said to have been, at 
this time, some thirty days' journey to the east-southeast, in what is

cultivating the land after their fashion and as being very laborious; and in Haw- 
kins' Sketch of the Creek Country, p. 34, we are told that "the Shawnees," some of 
whom, at that time, lived among the Creeks, "were very iudnstrious, worked with 
the women, and made plenty of corn." 

II Father Membre, p. 151. Marquette, p. 34, says: "Through what supei'stitiou I 
know not, some Illinois as well as some Nadouassi, while yet young, assume the 
female dress, and keep it all their life. There is some mystery about it, for they 
never marry, and glory iu debasing themselves to do all that is done by women; yet 
they go to war, though allowed to use only a club, and not the bow and arrow, the 
peculiar arm of the men; they are present at all juggleries and solemn dances in 
honor of the calumet ; they are permitted to sing, but not to dance ; they attend the 
councils, and nothing can be decided without their advice; finally, by the profes- 
sion of an extraordinary life, they pass for manitous (that is, for genii) or persons 
of consequence." Compare Lafitau, vol. i, pp. 52 and 53, and Lawson's Carolina, ji.

reserved for an unnatural purpose, which, according to Charlevoix (Letters, p. 213) 
and Long (Expedition to the Rocky Mountains, vol. i, p. 129: Philadelphia, 1823), 
may, have been a religious rite or the result of a dream. We are told that the cus- 
tom existed among the Choctaws, Delawares, and also among the Indians of Florida, 
though it is denied by Lawson, as far as the tribes of the Caroliuas are concerned. It 
is said to jirevail as a religious rite among some of the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico ; 
and Miss Alice C. Fletcher informs me that during her residence among the tribes of 
the Upper Missouri she saw one instance of a man so clothed, and this was caused 
by a dream.

taiu, however, that slavery was very common among- them, that being 
the usual fate of captives "taken from distant nations in the south and 
west, where the Illinois go to carry off slaves, whom they make an 
article of trade, selling them at a high price to other nations for goods."* 
These tribes lived in villages, some of which were very large, and they 
also had forts or strongholds for defense in case of necessity, t 

Passing over an interval of sixty or seventy years, and coming down 
to the middle of the eighteenth century, we find the Shawnees and 
Miamis again established in Ohio and Indiana, in company with the 
Wyandottes, Delawares, Pottawatamies, and other tribes. Just about 
this time, too, the white settlers began to push their way across the 
Alleghany Mountains into the valley of the Ohio, and this brought on 
that long and bloody struggle between the two races which only ended 
with the expulsion of the Indians from all that territory, and their 
establishment on reservations west of the Mississippi. Time and again 
they "dug up the hatchet," in order to stay the tide of immigration, 
and though for a while they spread terror all along the frontier, yet, 
in the end, they were always obliged to yield to the superior force and 
military skill and discipline of the whites. After every such outbreak 
they found themselves weaker than before. In retaliation for the out- 
rages which they undoubtedly committed, their country was invaded,^ 
their villages burned, their crops destroyed,§ and as the iDrice of each 
succeeding peace they were obliged to yield more or less of the terri- 
tory that remained to them. This is a sad chapter in our national his-

Besides these, there were other and more formidable invasions, some of which, like 
that of St. Clair, a. d. 1791, resulted disastrously to the whites; whilst those of 
Wayne, 1794, aud Harrison, 1811, were among the most successful, inasmtich as in

tory, and yet perhaps more than any other, it justifies the statement 
that the Indian had made great advance in the scale of civilization. 
Instead of being the wandering barbarian that he is painted, without 
fixed home, or any means of subsistence save that furnished by the 
chase, it presents him to us in the light of a successful farmer — a 
worthy rival, in this respect, to his white neighbor — fighting desperately 
a losing battle in defense of all he held most dear. Upon this point 
Gen. Wayne is certainly competent authority. Writing from Grand 
Glaize, A. d. 1791, just after the battle of the Maumee, and before the 
work of destruction had been begun, he uses the following emphatic 
language : " On the margins of these beautiful rivers, the Miamis of the 
Lake and the Au Glaize, appear like one continued village for a num- 
ber of miles, both above and below this place ; nor have I ever before 
beheld such immense fields of corn in any part of America from Canada 
to Florida.* 

This brings us around to the point from which we started, and geo- 
graphically speaking, completes the circuit. In the course of the in- 
vestigation, it will be observed that I have taken nothing for granted, 
but have endeavored to substantiate every assertion by a reference to 
undoubted sources, retaining as far as possible the very language of 
the authors. These citations might have been multiplied indefinitely, 
but it is believed that enough have been given to show: 

(1) That the red Indians of the Mississippi Valley lived in fixed vil- 
lages, which they were in the habit of fortifying by ijalisades. 

(2) That they raised corn in large quantities, and stored it in caches 
and granaries for winter use. 

(3) That whilst, as a fact, the women, children, old men, and slaves 
always cultivated the fields, yet the warriors cleared the ground, and, 
when not engaged in w ar or hunting, aided in working and harvesting 
the crop, though the amount of such assistance varied, being greater 
among the tribes south of the Ohio, and less among the Iroquois or Six 
Nations. 

A further examination of these same authorities will show that 
slavery was more or less common among all the tribes east of the Mis- 
sissippi ; that the rights of property were duly recognized and respected, 
and that there existed among them a system of inter-tribal traffic, in 
which, among other things, corn and slaves were bartered for skins 
and such other articles as were needed. 

II — THE INDIAN AS A WORSHIPPER OF THE SUN. 

The question of subsistence being thus disposed of, let us now ex- 
amine into the form of government and the religious belief of the mod- 
ern Indians, in order to see whether in these particulars there were 
any such differences between the state of affairs that can be shown to 

* Quoted in Our Indian Wards, p. 84 : Cincinnati, 1880, 



534 THE MOUNDS OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 

have prevailed amoug them, and that which is assumed to have existed 
among' the mound-builders, as would warrant the inference that they 
could not have erected these works. On the part of those who hold that 
there were such fundamental difierences, it is contended that there are 
certain types of earth- works that were evidently designed for a reli- 
gious purpose. They are variously termed "temple" mounds and "sa- 
cred inclosures,"* are found sometimes singly and sometimes united in 
a more or less complicated system, and are supposed to indicate that 
the peoi)le who built them were devoted to the worship of the sun.t It 
is also asserted that the erection of these works involved a species 
and an amount of labor to which the Indian would not have submitted,! 
and that hence he did not build them. 

This is believed to be a fair statement of the argument, which upon 
examination will be found to be fatally defective in so far as it as- 
sumes the very j)oint in dispute. To assert that the Indian would not 
have submitted to the labor requisite for the construction of these 
mounds is virtually to beg the whole question. So far is this from 
being true, that there is probably no fact in American arcbseology 
better authenticated than that the red Indian has, within the historic 
epoch, voluntarily built both mounds and earth- works. This of itself 
is a sufficient answer to the statement as to what he would or would 
not have submitted to in the way of work, and, at the same time, it 
eft'ectually disposes of the theory that only despotic governments could 
have controlled the amount of labor necessary to the erection of these 
works, since the form of government existing everywhere throughout 
the valley of the Mississippi at the date of the arrival of the whites, 
except, perhaps, among the Natchez Indians,§ was as far removed as 
possible from anything that savored of despotism. Of course it is not

^ In the early accounts, the Bashaba of New England, the Werowauce of Virginia, 
the Paraconssi of Florida, not less than the Great Sun of the Natchez, are all rep- 
resented as absolute rulers, though, to anyone Avho will take the trouble to read 
between the lines, it is evident that these were simply other names for the office of 
chief or sachem, and that the authority of these rulers did not extend any farther 
than their power to persuade. Even Du Pratz (whose account of the civil polity of 
the Natchez is most highly colored) virtually admits, vol. ii, book iv, section 7, 
that the war-making power in that nation was vested in a council of old men, and 
that when war was onc« declared, the war chief and not the Great Sun led the 
party, which was composed entirely of volunteers. Under different names we have 
here the Micco and Tus-tun-nug-ul-gee of the Creeks and the sachem and war chief 
of the Iroquois, with no more despotism or monarchy in one case than in either of 
the others. 



The mounds of the Mississippi valley. 535 

asserted tliat tliese works were as large or eomplicated as the famous 
system on the Scioto; nor is it essential to my argument that they 
should have been intended for the same purpose; but that the two were 
identical in kind is believed to be beyond dispute, as is also the addi- 
tional fact that among those known to have been erected by the mod^ 
ern Indians there are those that are on such a scale of magnitude as 
to ]>rove, beyond doubt, that when the motive was sufficient the Indian 
did not hesitate to perform, voluntarily and for an indefinite length of 
time, the same sort of manual labor as that which wms necessary for 
the construction of the more complicated series of works. Upon this 
point the evidence is very clear; and as there was practically no limit 
to the time within which these works must have been finished, it foL 
lows that their erection by a people living under the same conditions 
as the Indians must simply have resolved itself into a question of the 
power and permanence of the motive that impelled them to the under- 
taking. Clearly, if a regard for the dead, or the necessity for self- 
l)rotection, could lead the x>eople of a single village to erect, in one 
case a burial mound and in the other a breastwork or fort, there can 
be no reason why a motive that aifected a whole tribe and continued 
to influence successive generations might not have led to works as 
much greater than these as the one motive is more general and perma- 
nent than the other. Cologne cathedral is, to some extent, a case m 
point. That building was begun some five hundred years ago, at a 
time when the religious feeling of the people of that country was wont 
to manifest itself in such outward marks of devotion, and though the 
work has dragged as the ages rolled on and oi^inions changed, yet the 
very same motive or motives that led to its commencement, acting 
upon succeeding generations, have resulted at last in the completion 
of that superb structure. This being admitted, and I do not see how 
it can well be denied, there oidy remains for me to prove the existence 
of some adequate motive among the Indians in order to justify the con- 
<dusion that they could have built these wor]^s, even those of the largest 
size and most complicated pattern. 

Under ordinary circumstances this is a task that I should hardly 
venture to undertake. To attempt to point out the motive that led the 
people of a village or a tribe to execute a certain i)iece of work, requir- 
ing the united labor of a large number of persons for au indefinite time, 
especially when the pur])ose or end for which that work was intended 
is itself a matter of grave doubt, seems like a hopeless undertaking; 
and yet, with all due deference be it spoken, this is precisely what the 
advocates of the mound-builder theory have done, and in so doing they 
have marked out the course that this investigation must follow. 

Reasoning from analogy— an uncertain guide, at best, in matters 
scientific — they not only tell us that a certain class of these works were 
designed for a religious purpose, but they assert that they were built 



536 THE MOUNDS OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 

by a people who worshiijed the sim ; and they even go 8o far as to use 
this as an argument why they coukl not have been erected by the red 
Indian. That some of these works were, in some way, connected with 
this cult is extremely probable; at all events, in view of the plausible 
explanation it gives of their origin, the statement is admitted to be true ; 
but to assume that this furnishes a sound basis for the next step in the 
argument, and authorizes the inference that the red Indian could not 
have built them, is without warrant, either in fact or logic. Indeed, so 
far is it from being an argument in favor of this theory, that it is be- 
lieved to tell, with disastrous effect, against it, since it can be shown, 
on undoubted authority, that everywhere in the valley east of the Mis- 
sissippi the Indian was a sun- worshipper,* ;uid thus, of course, he and 
the mound-builder must have had the same leligious cult, even accord- 
ing to the admissions of those who hold that the two belonged to differ- 
ent races and represented different phases of civilization. This being 
the case, and it being further admitted that it was this cult that led the 
mound-builders to erect works like the so-called sacred inclosures of 
southern Ohio, it must follow that there can be no reason why the same 
cult should not have produced, among the Indians, x)recisely similar 
results. 

To the argument when stated in this fashion, the only answer logically 
possible is a denial that the Indians were sun-worshipers, all others 
being barred by the terms of tlie statement; and as this is the course 
that the discussion must inevitably take, it behooves me to strengthen 
this point as much as possible. To this end an appeal to the early 
records again becomes necessary, and though it seems like a waste of 
time thus to " thrash old straw," yet the fact that recent writers on this 
subject have either entirely ignored the existence of sun worship among 
the modern Indians, or else have limited it to a few tribes, t is proof 
positive of the necessity for repeating the evidence which has led me 
to a contrary conclusion. In doing this, however, the order followed in 
investigating the question of subsistence will be reversed. Instead of 
beginning with the Huron and Algonquin families, as was done in that

case, the tribes south of the Ohio, called b}^ Schoolcraft the Aj)palach- 
ians (though they do not all belong to the same stock or family), will be 
lirst considered. This change is deemed advisable for the reason that 
the religious rites andobservancesof these tribes are better known than 
are those of any other nation in the Mississippi Valley, and because, 
further, it is only by the light of this knowlegde that it is possible to 
interpret customs once prevalent elsewhere, but which have either 
wholly died out or lost much of their significance. As an instance of 
this, take the institution for keeping u]) a perpetual fire,* which seems, 
at one time, to have been very general among the tribes north of the 
Ohio, but which disappeared soon after the arrival of the whites, though 
we are told that its rites and duties were still fresh in the recollection 
of the Indians. Of itself, the fact that this institution had once pre- 
vailed extensively among tribes both of the Huron and Algonquin fam- 
ilies might not be considered as settling definitely their form of religion ; 
but if it be taken in connection with the very in'ominent part this rite 
held in the religious observances of the sun-worshiping tribes of the 
Gulf States, it will ))e seen that it forms an important link in the chain 
of evidence that points to the existence of one and the same form of 
worship among these different nations. Other instances of a similar 
character will doubtless occur in the course of this investigation; and 
my object in calling attention, at this time, to the sudden disai)pearance, 
over such a wide area, of what must have been an important religious 
rite, is not so much to mark the identity that once existed in the ritual 
of these widely separated nations, as it is to indicate the method that 
it is proposed to adopt in the treatment of this and similar cases. This 
mode of reasoning is believed to be perfectly fair and legitimate, though 
ot course its efficacy will depend upon the establishment of the truth 
of the i^roposition that the southern Indians were sun-worshipers. 
Fortunately this is a matter about which there can not be much doubt.

La Vega, * Laudoniere, t and otbers, | Ksome of whom wrote iu the 
latter part of the sixteenth century, bear witness to the fact in the most 
unmistakable hmguage, and their statements are confirmed by all the 
later writers.§ To enumerate these latter would be simply to call the 
roll of all who have written ujion the subject, and however interest- 
ing this might be to the special student in a bibliographical point of 
view, it would soon become monotoniuis and '-caviare to the general." 
For this reason, I shall confine myself to a rapid survey of some of the 
religious customs that prevailed among these tribes, and will only make 
such use of authorities as may be necessary to establish the truth of the 
propositions advanced. 

Speaking in a general way, then, it may be said of these nations that 
among some of them "the sun was regarded as one of the great 
deities; by others it was looked ux)on as the symbol or representative of 
the chief deity, and yet again by others it was considered as the 
supreme deity himself." || As part and parcel of this worship, there 
were certain rites and ceremonies, among which that of keeping up a 
perpetual fire was one of the most striking. This fire was kept burn- 
ing in honor of the sun,^] and was regarded as being too sacred to be

11 This is the classification made by Tylor, Primitive Culture, vol. ii, p. 287, of the 
beliefs of " the ruder tribes" of the northern continent. It seems to me that it is 
equally applicable to the tribes living on the lower Mississippi and along the Gulf 
coast, and I have adopted it, even though those nations are sometimes considered, 
on what are believed to be insufiicieut grounds, as occupying a somewhat higher 
place in the scale of civilization than their neighbors north of the Ohio.

used for ordinary j)urposes. It was fed with sticks or billets of wood 
without the bark, placed so as to radiate from a common center some- 
what like the spokes of a wheel, the fire occupying the center or hub. 
It was kept in bnildings or temples erected for the purpose, in which 
were also j)reserved the bones of the dead chieftains, neatly done up in 
cane baskets. Priests or guardians were appointed to watch over this 
fire, and see that it never died out, as its extinguishment was thought 
to forebode dire evil to the tribe.* In case such a thing did happen, 
either by accident or throngh carelessness, the fire could only be rekin- 
dled by brands taken from that kept burning in the temple of the Mau- 
biliens.t 

First among the priests or guardians of the temple and fire among 
the Natchez was the chief of the tribe, or, as he was called, tlie Great 
Sun. I Every morning at sunrise he appeared at the door of his cabin, 
and turning toward the east '' he howled three times," bowing down 
to the earth. Then a calumet, used only for this purpose, was brought 
him, and he smoked, blowing the smoke of the tobacco first towards the 
sun and then towards the other three quarters of the world. § He 
acknowledged no superior but the sun, from which he x^retended to 
derive his origin. || 

These temples did not differ materially from each other, nor from the 
other cabins, especially those of the Indian chiefs. The description which 
the Sieur de Tonti has left us of the one among the Tensas, visited by him

account relates to the tribes that were then living in what are now the States of 
Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. He says: "The Sun is their divinity, and they 
ofi'er it in sacrifice, the best of their chase in the chief's cabin. They pray for half 
an hour, especially at sunrise ; they send him the first whift" of their pipes, and then 
send one to each of the four cardinal points." Aa late as the beginning of the

1G82, will, with but few changes, apply equally well to all of them. 
After premising that these tribes "have a form of worshij), and adore 
the sun,"* he goes on to say that the temple is very like the cabin of 
the chief, which stands opposite, except that on top of it there were 
the figures of three eagles which looked toward the rising sun. It was 
about 40 feet square, and the walls, 10 feet high and 1 foot thick, were 
made of earth and straw mixed. The roof was dome- shaped, and about 
15 feet high. Around this temple were strong mud walls, in which are 
fixed spikes, and on these are j^laced the heads of their enemies, whom 
they sacrificed to the sun. Within it there is an altar, and at the foot 
of this altar three logs of wood are placed on end, and a fire is kept uj) 
day and night by two old priests, who are the directors of their wor- 
ship, t 

We are are also told that, at one time, these temples were quite com- 
mon throughout all the vast region then known as Florida, a majority 
of the tribes and even many of the villages having their own, and keep- 
ing uj) in them perpetual fires, f Geographically speaking, they are 
found all the way from Arkansas to the southern extremity of the pen- 
insula of Florida; and in poiut of time they cover the one hundred and 
eighty years embraced between the expedition of De Soto and the visit 
of Charlevoix in A. d. 1721. § About this time they seem to have gone 
somewhat out of fashion, as we are told that the one among the Natchez 
was the only one left; and although that is said to have been held in 
great veneration "by all the savages which inhabited this vast conti- 
nent," and the eternal fire was still kept up, yet it is evident from the 
neglected and unguarded condition in which Charlevoix found it|| that 
it had lost much of its sacred and distinctive character. Indeed, he 
tacitly admits as much, and probably assigns the true cause when he

ascribes it to the fear lest the French shouhl viohite these last resting- 
places of the dead,* as they had done witli the temple of Onmast a few 
years before. 

Some twenty-five years later, in the time of Adair, who lived and 
traded among the Chickasaws, Creeks, and Choctaws for many years 
subseqnent to 1735, the change was even more perceptible. It is true 
that the tribes constituting the Creek or Muscogee confederacy kept 
up many of tlie peculiar usages of the Xatchez, and continued to vene- 
rate the sun, as they certainly .did down to a comparatively recent 
period ;t and in describing their religious ceremonies, Adair still speaks 
of a "sacred fire," "holy places," "synhedria," etc. ;§ but it is evident 
that in so doing he has been betrayed by his wild notions as to the 
identity of the American Indians with the lost tribes of Israel, into the 
adoption of a terminology that is not warranted by the facts. Temples 
such as the one described among the Tensas, and which, as we have 
.seen, were once common among all the Floridian Cnbes, no longer ex- 
isted, and in their stead we find the state house, rotunda, hot house, or 
simple council chamber, such as it was known to the Creeks andChero- 
kces. In connection with the disappearance of the temples proper 
among these nations, there seems to have been a corresponding decrease 
in the number and purity of their religious rites and ceremonies. Du 
Pratzll mentions the fact, ascribing it to the decrease in population, 
whilst Adair,^ mourning over what he is pleased to consider the religious 
degeneracy of the times, complains that " their primitive rites are so 
corrupted within the space of the last thirty years that, at the same rate 
of declension, there will not be long a x)0ssibility of tracing their origin 
but by their dialects and war customs." Especially is this said to be 
true of the Cherokees, whom he stigmatizes as a nest of apostate 
hornets.** 

A few years later, say during the last quarter of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, and the change is complete. A temple is no longer even spoken 
of, though the council house, which seems to have taken its place as the 
scene of their religious rites and festivities, inherited something of its 
sacred character. It was still i)laced upon an artificial mound,ff as it 
had been among theQuapaws of Arkansas,|| the Natchez of Louisiana,§§

and other sontliern tribes; and here the old men of the village were 
accustomed to meet every evening to talk over public affairs; and here 
also took place many of their feasts and dances when the weather pre- 
cluded the use of the open square in front.* Women were no longer 
shut out from its sacred precincts, but were permitted under certain 
conditions to take a subordinate part in the ceremonies, except, perhaps, 
among the Creeks, among whom, according to Bartram, it was still 
deemed an offense worthy of death for a woman to enter this rotunda.t 
He also tells us that it was within this building that the new fire was 
kindled on the occasion of the feast of first fruits, and it was here that, 
under guard of the priests, '■^ they seem to keep up the eternal fire."J 
This however had lost its original form, and was now spiral in 
shape.§ Its sacred character too was gone, for the houseless pauper 
could now bask in its warmth undisturbed by priest or prophet ; and 
when the evening dance or the council was over, he might fiud a night's 
lodging within the precincts of the temple itself.] | 

Another very interesting rite was that of annually putting out all the 
fires of the tribe, and kindling them anew from sacred fire produced by 
friction. This ceremony took place at the Feast of the Busk or offering 
of first fruits, which seems to have been very general throughout this 
region.^] Indeed, Schoolcraft tells us that it also prevailed among the 

Huron and Algonquin families north of the Ohio, and that it extended

would "run" in a carefully prepared powder made from cedar. Lafitau, vol. i, p.

to the tribes ^vest of tlie Mississipj)!.* He also adds, that in every case 
it was attended with many ceremonies, though it does not seem to have 
been celebrated anywhere north of the Ohio with the same solemnity 
that it was among- the nations that formerly inhabited the Gulf States,t 
or, at all events, our accounts of such celebrations are not so full and 
explicit. Adair, who lived among these people for many years, and 
who, aside from his notions about the identity of the Indians with the 
Israelites, is usually trustworthy, describes this festival at great 
length, as does Bartram, Hawkins, and others. | From their accounts 
I have made up the following summary, which may not be uninterest- 
ing: When the time for holding this festival was fixed, the people of 
the village put their town in order, prepared new clothes for them- 
selves, and then, having partaken of the "black drink,"§ they entered 
upon a rigorous fast of two days, during which they abstained from 
the gratification of every sensual appetite. On the morning of the 
third day a supply of old food was brought to the square, all vestiges 
of which were removed before noon. As the sun began to decline, the 
fires were extinguished in every hut, and universal silence reigned. 
The chief priest then took a piece of dry poplar, willow, or white oak, 
and having cut a hole " so as not to reach througii it, he sharpened 
another piece, and placing tliat within the hole, he drilled it briskly 
for several minutes, till it began to smoke ; or by rubbing two pieces 
together for about a quarter of an hour, by friction, he collected the 
hidden fire."' It was then brought out of the temple in an earthen dish 
and placed upon an altar that had been previously jnepared in the 
square. Its api^earance brought joy to the hearts of the people, as it 
was supposed to abme for all past crimes, except murder. A general 
amnesty was proclaimed, except for this one crime, and all malefactors 
nught now return to their villages in safety. A basket of new fruits 
was then l^rought, and the fire-maker took some of each kind, and 
covering them with bear's grease, he offered them up as a sacrifice to 
the holy spirit of fire. He likewise consecrated the plants from which 
the "black drink'' was prepared, by pouring some of the decoction 
into the holy fire. The women ranged themselves around the square, 
when each received a portion of the new and pure flame, with which 
they kindled anew the household fires. Then they prepared, in the best 
manner, the new corn and fruits, and brought them to the square, 
where the people were assembled, apparelled in their new clothes and 
decorations. "The men having regaled themselves, the remainder

was carried off and distributed among the families of the village. The 
women and children solaced themselves in their separate families, and 
in the evening repaired to the public square, where they danced, sung, 
and rejoiced during the whole night, observing a i)roper and exemplary- 
decorum; this they continued three days, and on the four following 
days they received visits and rejoiced with their friends from neighbor- 
ing toAvns, who had all purified and prepared themselves." 

There were other rites and ceremonies connected with the worship of 
these tribes that might be studied to advantage; but those reported 
above were the most important, and will give a very good idea of the 
ritual as developed among these people. As has been said, the relig- 
ious cult seems to have reached a higher level here than it attained 
elsewhere in the Mississippi Valley;* and hence, in comi)aring, as we 
shall now do, their rights and customs with those of the tribes that 
lived north of the Ohio, and belonged to the Huron and Algonquin 
families, we must expect to find among the latter a falling off in the 
forms and ceremonies, rude as they undoubtedly were, that character- 
ized the religious observances of the tribes with which we have been, 
dealing. 

Beginning with the tribes along the south Atlantic coast we find 
that temples existed as far north as Virginia, and that the same reli- 
gious customs obtained as did among the sun-worshiping nations of 
the lower Mississippi, t Lawson, Oapt. Smith, and Beverly speak of these 
temples, or quioccosan, as they are called, as being very sacred, none 
but the king conjurer and a few old men being permitted to enter them. J

The last-named writer gained access to one during the temporary absence 
of the guardians, and from the account he has left of it, there can not 
have been much difference between it and similar buildings among the 
tribes living further to the southward. He tells us that it was used as 
a ret'cptacle for the bones of the deceased chieftains, which were done 
up in much the same manner as tliey were in the temple of the ISTatchez. 
It also contained a human figure or idol, which was variously termed 
Okee, Quioccos, or Kiwasa; and I mention this fact particularly, as it 
is one of the very few instances indicating the existence of idolatry 
among the Indians of the United States that is entitled to any weight, 
though there are reasons why even this statement should be taken 
with many grains of allowance. Round about the house, at some dis- 
tance from it, were set up posts with faces carved on them and painted.* 
According to Strachey, the priests who had the care of these temples 
"niainteyne a continuall fier in the same upon a hearth somewhat 
neere the east end." Hariott speaks of "sacred fires," in which 
tobacco was offered as a sacrifice; and in the plate which De Bry| 
gives of this temple a fire is represented as burning on the floor. We 
are also told that these tribes "annually present their first fruits of 
every season and kind, namely of birds, beasts, fish, fruits, plants, 
roots, and of all other things which they esteem either of profit or 
pleasure to themselves; and that they repeat these offerings as fre- 
quently as they have great successes in their wars, or their fishing, 
fowling, or hunting. It was also th(;ir custom to offer sacrifice upon 
almost every occasion. When they travel or begin a long journey, they 
burn tobacco instead of incense to bribe the sun to send them ttxir 
weather and a prosperous voyage. Likewise, when they return from 
war, from hunting, from fresh journeys, or the like, they offer some pro- 
portion of the spoils of their chiefest tobacco, furs, and paint, as also 
the fat and choice bits of their game,"§ in which latter respect they did 
not differ from the Creeks and Chickasaws. || 

As we go towards the nortli the temples disappear, although traces 
of the rites that were associated with them remain. We are still 
among tribes belonging to the Algominin family, and their religions 
belief is said to have resembled that of "cognate tribes of other stocks

and lineage,"* whatever that may mean. Amid a liost of supernatural 
beings or JNIanitous, big and little, good and bad, they seem to have 
recognized Michabou or Atahocan, the great hare, as the chief.t Ac- 
cording to Scihoolcraft, they ''located him in the sun or moon, or in- 
detinite skies. In their pictorial scrolls they painted the sun as a 
man's head surrounded Avith rays, and appeared to confound the sym- 
bol with the substance. They attributed light and life, vitality and 
intelligence, the world over, alike to Monedo and to Gezis, the sun."! 
Of the religious rites of these tribes, our acc(mnts, though not so 
full and explicit as might be desired, are still sufficiently so to indicate 
most clearly the existence of the same form of worship) as that which 
prevailed among the tribes of Virginia and Florida. The Chippewas,§ 
as we have seen, kept up the eternal tire until comparatively recent 
times. They said they had received the institution from the Shawnees, 
and this is probable, as that tribe, although belonging linguistically 
to the Algonquin family, was more or less closely connected with the 
Creeks, Natchez, and other sun-worshiping tribes of the South, |i and 
must perforce have been familiar with, if not a sharer in, their religious

to carry ont his government, among whom were the snn, moon, and stars. The 
waters were then made, out of which by the gods came all living creatnres. He 
next created a woman, who, by the 'working' of one of the gods, brought forth 
children, and 'in such sort they had their beginning.' They thought the gods were 
all of hnman shape, and so represented them in their temples where they ' worship, 
sing, pray, and make many times offering unto them. They believed in the immor- 
tality of the soul, which was destined to futui'c happiness in heaven, or to inhabit 
Popogusso, a pit or place of torment:'" Hakhiyt, VoycKjes, vol. iii, p. 336: London, 
1810. This account is so evidently colored by Christian ideas that it is almost 
worthless for pnrposes of comparisim, and the same may be said of Dn Pratz's state- 
ment of the religious belief of the Natchez, in which the interpolations are even 
more marked. For obvious reasons, the study of the religious beliefs of the abo- 
rigines is attended with many difficulties, though I am inclined to think that Park- 
man is not far wrong when he asserts that "the primitive Indian yielding his un- 
tutored homage to One All-pervading and Omnipotent Spirit is a dream of poets, 
rhetoricians, and sentimentalists:" Jesuits in Norih America, p. Ixxxix of the pre-

observances. Indeed, the "ceremony of thanksgiving- for the first 
fruits of the earth," as observed among the Shawnees, attended as it 
was l)y a general amiu'sty for all crimes except murder, and also the 
custom of "susiiending the head, horns, and entrails of the animals 
killed for the sacrifice on a large white i)ole, with a forked top, which 
extends over the house," * are so similar to the same rites as practiced, 
respectively, among the Creekst and the Indians of the Floridian Pen- 
insula J as to leave no doubt upon this i)oint, even if we had not posi- 
tive assurance from other quarters that tliey looked upon the sun as 
the (Iroat Spirit, for the reason that he "animates everything, and 
iiS, therefore, clearly the master of life." § The Delawares were closely 
connected with the Shawnees, and appear to have had many of the 
same religious ceremonies. They oflered sacrifices of tobacco to the 
sun, II and had a festival in honor of fire, which (Lieut. Whipple, in 
vol. Ill, ]). I'O, of the Explorations of a Railroad to the Pacific) "they 
renew once a year." They also, according to Van der Donck, swore by 
the sun, saying: "that he sees all. They regard him and the moon 
as being better than all the Christian gods, for they warm the earth 
and cause tlie friuts to grow."^ 

Among the Kew Kiigland Indians the same form of worship lire- 
vailed. Eoger Williams and others tell us that they worshiped the 
sun for a god,** and had a festival at harvest time.'t This is confirmed 
by Cotton JMather so far as relates to the worshij) of the sun and moon, 
and he adds that they believe that every remarkable creature has a 
peculiar god within it or about it.|J In the famous Dighton rock inscrip- 
tion which stands in the country once held by the Wampanoags the 
symbol of the sun was discovered by Chingwauk, the Algonquin Meda,§§ 
and in this same region lived the Narragausetts, who, according to

worship. 

In the iN^orthwest, the sun and thunder were the gods of the tribes 
that lived around Green Bay, and in all that region out of which were 
subsequently formed the States of Wisconsin and Illinois.| When the 
"Illinois came to meet Marquette on the occasion of liis voyage — the 
first ever made by a white man — down that i)ortion of the Mississippi, 
they marched slowly, lifting their pipes to the sun, as if offering them 
to him to smoke. They also make a similar offering to him when they 
wish to obtain calm, or rain, or fair weather.§ Among the Ottawas, of 
Michigan, prayers were offered to the sun, and tobacco was burned as 
a sacrifice to the same deity.|| Indeed, the use of tobacco as an offering

their statciiu'iits arc <'<niliriiM'(l by writers uiio liave left us aecouiits of 
the rites and eereniouies as practiced by the different tribes. Thus 
Hariot, who wrote in the hitter part of the sixteenth century, tells us 
tliat thisi)lant was lield in such esteem by the Indians of Virginia that 
tlu'y imagined that their gods were pleased when it was offered to 
them. It w'as for this reason that from time to time they built sacred 
tires, on which tliey burned tliis plant as a sacritice. He also adds, that 
when they are surprised by a tempest they scatter it n]ion the water or 
throw it up in the air; and they also put it in their neW' nets in order to 
insure success in tisliiug.| There was also something of a religious 
character in the practice common among all the Indian tribes of the 
United States of smoking the calumet as a lareliminary to auy treaty, or 
bargain, or agreement of any kind. According to Charlevoix the Indians 
claimed to have "received the calumet from the Pauis, to whom it had 
been given by the sun, and they held it so sacred that there was prob- 
ably no instance of an agreement made in this manner that was ever 
violated. They believed that the Great Spirit would not leave such a 
breach of faith unpunished. - - - In trade, when an exchange has 
been agreed u]30u, a calumet is smoked in order to bind the bargain, 
and this makes it in some jnanner sacred. - - - There is no reason 
to doubt that the Intlians, in making those smoke the calumet with 
whom they wish to trade or treat, intend to call upon the sun as a wit- 
ness and in some fashion as a guarantee of their treaties, for they never 
fail," so the old chronicler tells us, ''to blow the smoke toward that 
star."§ 

* "They make to all these Spirits different sorts of offerings, which yon may call, 
il'yon please, sacrifices. They throw into the Kivers and the lakes Petum, Tobacco, 
or birds that have had their throats cut, to render the God of the waters propitious 
to them. In honor of the Sun, and sometimes also of the Inferior Spirits, they throw 
into the Fire Part of every Thing they use, and which they acknowledge to hold 
from tbt'iii. It is souietinies out of Gratitude, but ofteuer througli Interest:" Letters

550 THE MOUNDS OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 

If now we turn to the tribes of the Huron-Iroquois stock, we shall 
find that the sun was not less an object of worship. In the Relation of 
1648 we are told that they invoked him as ajudge of their sincerity, 
Avho saw into the depth of all hearts, and Avho would punish the per- 
fidy of those who broke the ir faith, or failed to keep their word. Lafitau 
states positively that Areskoui and Agreskoue (the difference is said to 
be linguistic), the war god of the Hurons and the Irocpiois, was but 
another name for the sun, "who was their Divinity as he was that of 
all the Americans."* La Hontan confirms the fact of their worshi]) of 
this luminary, and says that, when "asked why they adore God in the 
suu rather than in a tree or a mountain," their answer is that they 
choose to admire the Deity in i)ublic, pointing- to the most glorious 
thing that nature affords.! According to Lafitau | they had no tem- 
l)les, and did not keep up a perf)etual fire; at least there was not a ves- 
tige left of any such building in his time, and no mention of any such 
institution in any of the " Relations " of the Jesuit Fathers. This how- 
ever can hardly be considered decisive of thv^. point, since we are given 
to understand that these tribes had lost many of their religious cus- 
toms 5§ and in this very connection are assured that the tire on their 
hearths took the place of an altar, and that as was the case among the 
Creeks and Cherokees, their " council liouses serv^ed them as temples." || 
Bearing upon this point, and as an evidence of the identity of the 
religious rites and ceremonies every where prevalent, we mny note that 
once a year they were accustomed to put out all the fires of the tribe 
and to rekindle them with fire supplied by the priests,^] as was the 
case among the Southern tribes. Morgan it is true does not mention 
this custom in his accouut of the Iroquois festivals, but he describes 
the practice of "stirring tlie ashes on the hearth," Avhich took place at 
their New Year's Jubilee,** and it is possible that there may have been 
some connection between the two. 

Among their sacrifices there were some that seem to have been pe- 
culiar to the northern nations. Thus, for instance, although the dog- 
was a favorite article of food among the tribes botli north and south of 
the Ohio, and was not uufrequently offered as a sacrifice, yet I do not 
find that anywhere else they "iiung him up alive on a tree by the hind 
feet and let him die there raving mad."tt They were in the habit of ex- 
contracts." "Osages smoke to God or to the Sun:" Nnttall, Jrlausa Territory, l>.

posing, on the tops of their cabins, strings and neckhices of beads, 
bunches of corn, and even animals, which tliey consecrated to the sun.* 
They also made burjit otfeiings to the same divinity of corn, of animals 
taken in the chase, and of tobacco or other plants that served them in 
its place,t in much the same manner as was done among the tribes be- 
longing to the Algonquin and Appalachian families. In their war sac- 
rilices the Iroquois take "the leg of a deer or bear, ov some other wild 
beast, rub it with fat, and then throw it on the fire, praying the sun to 
accept the oftering, to light their ])aths, to lead them and give them the 
\ictory over their enemies, to make the corn of their fields to grow, to 
give them a successful hunt or fish."| They also had their annual festi- 
vals, among which that of the green corn was one of the most imi)or- 
tant. It was celebrated when the corn became fit for use, usually lasted 
several days, and was the counterpart of the feast of the Busk, as ob- 
served among the Indians of the Gulf States. ]\Iorgan paints, with a 
loving hand, the simple ceremonies with whicli the Iroquois of later 
times were wont annually at this festival, to return thanks to the 
(Ireat Spirit for his bounty, and to solicit a continuance of his favor 
and protection. It was at this time that they offered a sacrifice of 
tobacco, believing that they could communicate with him through its 
incense ;§ and in their jnayers they returned thanks "to our mother, 
the earth, which sustains us; - - - to the corn, and to her sisters, 
the beans, and the squashes, which give us life; - - - to the sun, 
that he looked upon the earth with a benificent eye, and lastly to the 
Great Spirit, in whom is embodied all goodness, and who directs all 
things for the good of his cldldren." || 

Thus far we have been considering the religious rites and customs of 
the different tribes of Indians that occupied the eastern portion of the 
IMississippi A'alley, and we have seen that there was a general same- 
ness pervading them, and that all grew out of, or were connected with, 
the worship of the sun. If now we turn from this theme and examine 
into their myths, Ave shall find that, though the path be different, yet 
it leads to the same result. 

Accepting the Natchez as a type of the group of Southern tribes, we 
are told that, ages ago, a child of the sun, who saw and pitied their 
disorganized condition, came down with his Avife for the jiurpose of es- 
tablishing order and instituting religious rites and ceremonies among 
them. He gave them certain precepts — political as well as religious—

for their better govermnent; and liaving couducted tbeui into a better 
land, lie b(K'.anie at last, after mucli solicitation, their sovereign. It 
was through him that the Natchez claimed their descent from the sun, 
and from him they took the official title of their chief. This is the 
myth as told by Du Pratz,* and though, unfortunately, the religious 
precepts which are said to have been inculcated bear a most suspicions, 
and, under the circumstances, absurd lilceness to the Ten Command- 
ments, yet it is possible that the rest of the story may be genuine. 

Among the Algonquin tribes we are on firmer ground. Here we 
have the old story of " the conflict between light and darkness, in which 
the former, personified under the name of Michabo, is the conqueror, 
lie is the giver of light and life, the creator and preserver, - - - 
and in origin and deeds he is the not unworthy personification of the 
l^urest conception they possessed of the Father of All. To him, at 
early dawn, the Indian stretched forth his hands in prayer 5 and to the 
sky or the sun as his home"! or, it may be added, as his representative, 
or as this deity himself, he offered the first whiff of his morning pipe. 

Among the Huron Iroquois we find the same myth, though under 
different names. With them the contest Avas between loskeha and 
Tawiscara, names which, according to Brinton, signify, in the Oneida 
dialect, the White one and the Dark one. " They were twins, born of 
a virgin mother, who died in giving them life. Their grandmother was 
the moon, called by the Hurous Ataen sic. - - - The brothers quar- 
reled, and finally caine to blows, the former using the horns of a stag 
and the latter the wild rose. He of the weaker weapon was very nat- 
urally discomfited and sorely wounded. Fleeing for his life, the blood 
gushed from him at every step, and turned into flint stones. The vic- 
tor returned to his grandmother, and established his lodge in the far 
east, on the borders of the great ocean whence the sun comes. In time 
he became the father of mankind, and the special guardian of the Iro- 
quois. The earth was at first arid and sterile, but he destroyed the 
gigantic frog which had swallowed the waters, and guided the torients 
into smooth streams and lakes. The Avoods he stocked with game; and 
having learned from the tortoise hoAV to make fire, he taught his chil- 
dren, the Indians, this indispensable art." J "Without his aid," says 
Father Breboeuf, " they did not think their pots would boil. - - - 
He it was who gave them the corn which they ate, and Avho made it 
grow and ripen; if their fields were green in the spring-time, if they

This completers onr brief examination into the religious belief and cus- 
toms oi' the American Indians li\ iug east of the Mississippi and south 
of the Great Lakes. In it we have glanced rapidly at their myths and 
theii- beliefs, and the rites and ceremonies to which these gave rise, 
and we have found that eacli line of investigation led to one and the 
same result. In view then of this uniformity, and of the overwhelm- 
ing area of direct evidence that has been otfered on the point, I do not 
think it is overstepping the bounds of moderation to claim, with the 
old chronicler, that within the limits named, "the American Indians, 
so far as known, Avithout the exception of a single tribe, worshipped the 
sun." J 

ITT. — THE INDIANS AS MOUND-IUTILDERS. 

Thus far in the course of this investigation my position has been 
rather a negative one. It is true that an effort has been made to show, 
and it is believed with some measure of success, tliat tlie red Indian of 
historic times was both an agriculturist and a worshiiDcr of the sun, 
and that hence, even according to the admission of those who hold a 
contrary opinion, there are no reasons, a priori, why he could not have 
erected these works. This is unquestionably a step in the right direc- 
tion; and with this point gained, I might well afibrd to rest the argu- 
ment. It would not however be by any means decisive of the ques- 
tion as to the origin of these structures, since the fact that an Indian 
might have built them does not justify us in concluding that he ac- 
tually <lid do so. To fill uj) as far as possible the gap that separates 
the ability to do a certain jnece of work from its actual performance, it 
will be necessary in this case to abandon the seemingly negative posi- 
tion hitherto occupied, and to inquire whether there is any evidence 
that the Indian has at any time constructed works of the same charac- 
ter, though i)erhaps not of the same size as the largest of those found 
in the Ohio Valley. If it can be shown that he has done so it is be- 
lieved that it will justify us in ascribing all these structures to his 
agency, for the reason that these mound centers, with scarcely a single

exception, can bo pnneii to liiive beeu at «oine time the seats of mound- 
building- Indians, and because never, so far as we know, have tliey 
been held even temi)orarily by any other race of people previous to the 
ai-rival of tlie whites. 

In ])ursuin<i- tliis branch of our inquiry the only method open to us 
is to ])roceed by comi»arison. For obvious reasons we can never know 
the particular individuals by whom these Avorks were erected, nor can 
we, except in a few cases, even hope to do more than approximate the 
time when they were built. All that can be accomplished in the pres- 
ent state of our knowledge is to show by a comparison of these i-e- 
mains with similar works that are known to have been erected by the 
modern Indians that there are no such differences between them as 
would authorize the inference that they wei'e built by different i)eo- 
j)les, or by the same people in different stages of civilization. 

To institute a comparison of this character seems like a very simple 
matter, and it would be so if there were any way of establishing a hard 
and fast line of demarcation l)etween the works of the Indians and those 
of the so-called mound -builders. Unfortunately however or perhaps 
it might be more correct for me to say fortunately, nothing of the kind 
can be done; for though, as a matter of fact, the mounds and earth- 
works of the Mississii)pi Valley do vary indefinitely in size, shape, loca- 
tion, grouping, and possibly in many other respects, yet these are all 
differences of degree and not of kind; and however great the distance 
between the extremes in any one of these particulars, it is not of such 
a radical character as to indicate a diflerenc*; in the civilization of the 
people who constructed tlie works. Given time and an indefinite sup- 
ply of laborers, and there is no reason why the i)eople who built one 
might not have built any and all of them. The simple manual labor 
necessary to their construction was essentially the same in every case, 
the only question being as to the amount. That this is so is evident 
from the fact tljat when considered solely with reference to the kind 
and amount of this labor, these works are found to grade into each 
other by such imperceptible stages that admitting" them to liav(i been 
erected by different i)eop]es, it is impossible to say where the work of 
one ended and that of the other began. This statement has I know 
met with more or less opposition, and it is quite likely that in the 
future, as in the past, we sliall be told of the existence of some line of 
demarcation between them, though it is possible that the attempt to 
fix and define it will not meet with any better success than has crowned 
former efforts in the same direction. Size, shape, and probable use 
have at different times been thought to furnish a key to the mystery 5 
and either singly or together they are still occasionally made to do 
duty in this capacity; but with all due deference to those who so per- 
tinaciouvsly seek for differences where none exist, it may be said, without 
fear of successful contradiction, that thus far not one of these so-called 
distinguishing features has been able to stand the test of intelligent

criti(;ism5 and that to-day it looks very much as if it would be neces- 
sary to fall back upon what a recent writer terms " indefinable marks" 
and "resemblances tliat cannot be described/' in order to find a foun- 
dation for the theoty of a difference iu the character of these works, 
and consequently in the civilization of the people who built them. 
Indeed, the advocates of this theory do not agree among themselves as 
to where this line should be drawn; and from the very nature of the 
case it may well be doubted whether it is possible for them ever to attain 
any very great degree of harmony. The mound-builders are at best 
a mythical people, who owe even their imaginary existence to the nec- 
essity of accounting for a state of affairs that is iu great part assumed ; 
and of course any standard by wliicli to judge the works they are sup- 
posed to have executed must vary with the fancy of the writer or the 
exigencies of the argument. But even if this were not the case, and 
there were no subjective obstacles m the way of uniformity of opinion 
upon this vital point, it would still be impossible to establish any test 
or standard, for the reason that, except in the fact that a large major- 
ity of the mounds and embankments " are made of earth simply heaped 
up, with little or no care in the choice of material, and none at all in 
the order of deposit,"* there are no two of them that are alike; and 
without the presence of some conformation that is at least constant, 
it is of course idle to speak of a type or standard. 

To make this point clearer, let us glance at these remains as they 
have come down to us, and putting aside, as far as possible, air theories 
aiul speculations as to their origin and use, let us question them as to 
the civilization of which they are the silent witnesses. To this end, it 
will be advisable to discard, as far as may be consistent with clearness, 
the descriptive nomenclature that has been used in the classification 
of these works, and to adopt one that will be less productive of false 
and erroneous ideas as to the object or purpose for which many of them 
were intended. As an instance of the errors arising from this source, 
take the term "sacred inclosare," which has been applied to a class of 
works that is usually found upon the broad aud level river terraces, 
and is composed of mounds and embankments or inclosures, sometimes 
standing alone, but more frequently grouped together in a more or less 
complicated manner. This term has been long in use, and by a sort of 
prescriptive right is sometimes regarded as describing accurately the 
eharacter of the works to which it has been applied, when in point of 
tiU't it does nothing of the kind. A few of these inclosures may pos- 
sil)ly owe their origin to a religious sentiment, but of the large majority 
of them it may l)e safely said, in view of recent investigations, that they 
were simi)ly fortified villages. Seff-protecticm was the primary object 
of the people who lived behind these walls, and except in the single 
fact that some of the truncated mounds occasionally found associated

with them may have been the sites of rude mud temples, there is not a 
particle of evidence to show that they had anything to do with any re- 
ligious rite or custom whatsoever. Indeed, if it. be admitted that the 
mound-builder bchmged to a race separate and distinct from the In- 
dian, it can not be conclusively shown that he had any religion at all. 
What little evidence there is bearing upon the jHiint is drawn from 
analogy, and singularly enough is based njton the tact that the Indians 
of the Southern States, from Florida to Missouri, erected just such 
mounds as sites for their temples.* Unfortunately however for the 
analogy, these same Indians were in the habit of placing the cabins of 
their chiefs upon j^recisely similar mounds, which were also built espe- 
cially for the puri)ose.t This fact alone is sufticient to invalidate any 
conclusion as to the religious character of these structures 5 and of 
course any inference as to the object or purpose of the iuclosures in 
which they are sometimes found, based upon this conclusion, must fall 
with it. But even if these works were all that is claimed for them, it 
is difficult to understand how this fact could be construed into an argu- 
ment in favor of the tlieory that these truncated mounds, which are 
everywhere identical in form and in the probable uses for which they 
were intended, could have been the work of tw^o different peoples, or 
of the same people in different stages of ciAalization, though its im- 
portance as a link in the chain of evidence that points to the identity 
of the Southern Indians with the mound-builders is at once apparent. 

Returning from this long digression, and bearing in mind the caution 
as to the misleading character of the terms used in these investigations, 
let us resume the thread of our inquiry, and divesting these remains of 
the glamour that attaches to them as the work of an extinct people, let 
us endeavor to see them as they are, and to interpret as far as may be 
the story they have to tell. ^ 

Speaking in a general way, the Mississippi Valley system of earth- 
works may be said to embrace all that region that lies between the 
Great Lakes on the north and the Gulf of Mexico on the south, and to 
be bounded on the west by the tier of States that lines the western 
bank of the Mississippi, and on the east by a line drawn through "the 
middle of the States of New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, and 
extending southwardly so as to include the greater part of the two 
Garolinas and the whole of Georgia and Florida. It is true that simi- 
lar works are found outside of these limits, but for my present purposes 
it will not be necessary, except in one or two instances, to travel beyond 
the bounds here prescribed. Throughout the whole of this region these 
remains are more or less abundant, though different forms of mounds

aud earthworks seem to prevail iu different sections, as, for instance, 
the animal mounds in Wisconsin, the inclosures in Ohio, and the trun- 
cated mounds in the States farther to tlie south. All kinds however 
are represented in the Ohio Valley, and it is probably safe to say that, 
within that basin, they are more numerous, of larger size, and more 
complicated patterns than can be found elsewhere in the United States. 
Taken as a whole, tliey may be roughly divided into two grand divis- 
ions — mounds and enbankments, — and these can again be sub-divided 
into numerous groups. Beginning with the embankments or inclosures 
we llnd that they are generally of earth — rarely of stone, — and that they 
are situated on the level river terraces, or else occujiy the tops of hills 
or other luiturally strong positions. According to their situation, they 
have been divided into works of defense and sacred inclosures, or as I 
prefer to call them, hill-fin-ts and fortified villages The former of these 
almost always followed the outlines of the hill, and are hence more or 
less irregular in shape. In some of them the whole top of the hill is 
inclosed by a wall, Avhilst in others only the more exposed points are 
so defended. The fortified villages are usually found on a level plain — 
one of the river l)encQes or terraces being generally selected. They are 
of various sizes and shapes, though the square and circle predominate, 
and are oiten found united in a seemingly arbitrary manner. The 
height of the wall around the inclosure, measured from the bottom of 
the ditch that usually accomj^anies it, varies from a few feet up to 30. 
In many instances it is now, ami must always have been, too insignifi- 
cant to offer any serious obstacle to an attacking force; and this has 
given rise to the suggestion that these embankments were formerly 
surmounted by stockades, as was the case Mith the villages of the recent 
Indians. Without stopping now to inquire into the probability of this 
explanation, it is sufficient to say that there cannot be the slighest 
d(Uibf asfo its truth in regard to some of them. Brackenridge* states 
the fact positively, and Atwater tells us that half-way up, on the out- 
side of the inner wall that surrounded the circle, or as he calls it the 
"r<mnd fort," which formed a i)art of the large and complicated series 
of works that once occupied the site of the present town of Circleville, 
Ohio, "there is a place distinctly to be seen where a row of pickets 
once stood, and where it was placed Miien this work of defense was 
originally ei'ccted." t In point of size these works varied greatly. 
Some of the smaller circles — probably the ruins of mud lodges or tem-

was (>!t rods in diameter, measuring from ontside to outside of the circular onler 
wall ; the latter is exactly 55 rods square measuring the same way. The walls of the 
circular fort were at least 20 feet iu height, measuring from the bottom of the ditch,

pies similar to those described as having existed among' the Southern 
Indians,* and wliich may still be seen among some of the tribes of the 
Upper Missouri f — are not more than 50 feet in diameter, whilst the 
groups, or series of works in which the different forms are united, not 
unfrequently covered hundreds of acres, or, as was the case with the 
works at N"ewark, Ohio, were scattered about over an area of 2 miles 
square. J 

The situation of tlie ditch with reference to the wall was a matter in 
which tlicre was but little if any uniformity, it being sometimes on one 
side of the wall and sometimes on the other. At one time this feature 
was thought to furnish a criterion by which to judge the character of 
the work, and Mr. Squier quotes approvingly English authorities to the 
effect '^that the circumstance of the ditch being within the vallum is a 
distinguishing mark between religious and military works." § This po- 
sition however does not hold good with regard to earth-works in the 
United States, since it is matter of record that in some of the stockaded 
forts of the recent Indians the ditch was on the inside of the wall, 
whilst in others there was a ditch on each side. || Indeed, when we con- 
before the town of Cireleville was built. The innei* wall was of clay, taken np 
probably in the northern part of the fort where was a low place, and is still con- 
siderably lower than any other part of the work. The outside wall was taken from 
the ditch which is between these walls, and is alluvial, consisting of pebbles worn 
smooth in water, and sand, to a very considerable depth, more than 50 feet at least. 
The outside of the walls is about 5 or 6 feet in height now; on the inside, the ditch 
is, at present, generally not more than 15 feet. They are disappearing before us 
daily, aiul will soon be gone. The walls of the square fort are, at this time, where 
left standing, about 10 feet in height. There are eight gateways or oiienings lead- 
ing into the square fort, and only one into the circular fort. Before each of these 
openings was a mound of earth perhaps 4 feet high, 40 feet perhaps in diameter at 
the base, and 20 or upwards at the summit. These mounds for 2 rods or more are 
exactly in front of the gateways, and were intended for the defense of these open- 
ings."

sider the nature of the position to be defended, and bear in mind the 
offcctivc use of rifle pits in modern warfare, it may Mell be doubted 
wiietb(!r tlu^ inside is not, under certain conditions, tbc proper place 
lor it. 

In the material of which they were made these embanlvinents varied 
but little. As has been Avell said by 11. H. Bancroft, * "they are of 
earth, stones, or a mixture of the two, in their natural condition, thrown 
up from the material which is nearest at hand. There is no instance of 
walls built of stone that has been hewn or otherwise artificially pre- 
l)ared, of the use of mortar, of even rough stones laid with regularity, 
of adobes or earth otherwise preiiared,or of material brought from any 
great distance. The material was taken from a ditch that often accom- 
l)anies the embankment, from excavations or pits in the immediate vi- 
cinity, <n' is scraped up from the surface of the surrounding soil. There 
is nothing in the ])resent ai)pearance of these works to indicate any dif- 
ference in their original form from that naturally given to earth-works 
thrown uj) fr<nn a ditch, with sides as nearly perpendicular as the nature 
of the material will permit. Of course any attempt on the part of the 
builders to give a symmetrical superficial contour to the works would 
have been hmg since obliterated by the action of the elements; but 
nothing now remains to show that they attached any importance what- 
ever to either material or contour. Stone embankments are rarely 
found, an<l only in localities where the abundance of that material 
would naturally suggest its use. In a few instances clay has been ob- 
tained at a little distance, or dug from beneath the surface." 

Turning now to our second grand division — Ihe mounds, — we find 
them composed of earth and stone, and varying in location, size, shape, 
and contents. Divided according to their form, they may be classed 
as — 

First. "Temple" or truncated mounds, which as their name indi- 
cates are truncated cones, usually with graded ways to their tops, and 
in some instances with terraced sides. Their bases are of different 
forms, being indifferently either round, oval, square, or oblong; but 
whatever may have been their differences in these respects, they were 
all alike in having flat or level tops, which were no doubt used as sites 
for their rude temples, or the cabins of their chiefs. In size, they 
varied from a height of 5 feet to 90, and from a base of 40 feet in diame- 
ter to one covering an area of 12 acres.t Like the em))ankments, they 
ar*' simi)ly heaps of earth, some of them, it is true, of immense size, 
but ail of them thrown upwithout much "care in the choice of material, 
and uouv at all in the order of deposit." 

Second. The next class is composed of the " animal mounds," or 
mounds in which the ground plan is more or less irregular, and is

thought to resemble animals, birds, aud even human beings, though it 
is admitted that this resemblance is often imaginary, and that there is 
no evidence that tlie buildersof these works intended to copy any such 
forms. Indeed, Lapham,* to whom we are indebted for the most satis- 
factory account of these mounds that we possess, finds it necessary, on 
more than one occasion, to caution his readers against blindly accept- 
ing these resemblances, and frankly .says that in some cases ai)pella- 
tions, like that of "Lizard Mound," were given for the sake of con- 
venience, and without pretending that they were actually intended to 
represent that animal. + According to the same author, as summarized 
by Bancroft, these mounds vary in height from 1 to (5 feet, and their 
dimensions on the ground are quite large. Thus "rude eiligies of 
human form are in some instances over 100 feet long; quadrupeds have 
bodies and tails each from 50 to 200 feet long; birds have wings of a 
hundred feet; lizardmounds are 200 and even 400 feet inlength; straight 
and curved lines of embankments reach over a thousand feet, and ser- 
pents are equally extensive." Mounds of this class are common in 
Wisconsin, and are also found in Ohio and Georgia. They are not 
burial mounds, though they are not unfrequently grouped with conical 
mounds that inclose human remains, as they are also with embank- 
ments and inclosures, — the groupingbeing always without any apparent 
order. They are usually constructed of earth, stones being but rarely 
used, except perhaps in Georgia, where the two bird-shaped mounds 
described by Col. 0. C. Jones are built entirely of that material.^ 

Third. The third and last class of mounds consists of the simple c<mi- 
cal tumuli that are scattered about over this whole area and art^ far 
more numerous than all the others combined. So far as outward a})- 
pearance is concerned they are generally round or oval, though other 
forms are not unfrequent. They vary in height from a few inches to 70 
feet,§ and in diameter from 3 or 4 feet to 300. It is probable however 
that a height of from 3 to 30 feet and a diameter ranging at the 
base from 15 to 50 feet would include a large proportion of them. 
Although so alike in form, these mimnds differ widely in location, 
and, as we shall see later on, in their contents. They are found on the 
tops of the highest hills aud in the lowest river valleys; they stand 
alone or in groups, or in connection with hill-forts or fortified villages, 
of which they evidently formed component parts. In the material of 
which they are built, as well as iu the mauner of their construction, 
they do not differ from the embankments and from other mounds. A

large majority of them are simply heaps of earth, though stone mounds 
or cairns are quite common, and in Florida they are sometimes com- 
posed almost entirely of shells. As a rule, they are homogeneous in 
structure, thougli occasionally in the Ohio Valley, and especially along 
the Scioto River, there are a few that were regularly ami intentionally 
stratihed. 

This is believed to be a fair statement of all that is known of the 
mounds, considered simply as mounds, and without any regard to their 
contents, or to what is known of them historically. It is taken almost 
literally from Bancroft,* M^hora I have chosen to follow, for the reason 
that his sumnniry of the results of the exidorations of Squier, Lapham, 
and others is just and comprehensive, and because, in a matter of this 
importance, it seemed to me desirable to distrust my own judgment and 
to accept the statement of one who can not be accused of sharing in the 
conclusions to which I have been most nnexpectedly driven. 

As a result of this rapid glance at the story of these remains, when 
told by themselves, it will be seen that althongh they differ widely in 
form, size, and tlie evident use for which they were intended, yet they 
are, primarily, nothing but heaps of earth, stones, or a mixture of the 
two, thrown up into the form of mounds and embankments. A child 
at play on a pile of sand performs on a small scale, and for his amuse- 
ment, the very same kind of labor as that involved in their erection; 
and the beaver and the white ant, in building their dams and nests, 
show a degree of development — a faculty of adapting means to an 
end — but little if any inferior to that displayed by the mound-builder, 
when judged by the same standard. Indeed, we are told that the bea- 
ver dams and washes of Wisconsin sometimes bear a very close resem- 
blance to the so-called seri)ent mounds, and to the excavations made 
by the Indians in search of lead and other ores 5 1 whilst as a matter 
of fact, the ant hills of Africa, in point of relative size,| and in the 
architectural knowledge and engineering skill displayed in their con- 
struction, are quite equal to any earthwork in the Ohio Valley. In 
saying this, it must not be supposed that there is any intention of dis- 
paraging the works of the mound-builders. Unquestionably some of 
them are of great size, and exhibit an immense amount of patient toil 
and perseverence ; but beyond this they tell us little or nothing. I^o- 
where, either in laying them <mt, or in the manner in which the dead 
were sometimes buried in them, can be found any such adherance to 
the principle of orientation as a\ ould authorize the inference that the 
people who built and buried in tliem had advanced beyond the merest 
rudiments of astronomical knowledge; and as for the mathematical 
skill displayed in the construction of their squares and circles, anyone

who has ever aided in fencing a western farm knows that it is a com- 
paratively simijle matter to "rnn" a straight line, especially if it be as 
broad as most of these embankments; and that consequently squares 
as large and with angles as "perfes-t" as any of those in the Ohio Val- 
ley, can be constructed with the aid of three straight sticks and a mod- 
erately good eye. The circles might perhai^s give a little more trouble ; 
but even they are not beyond the compass of a boy with a string. Mr. 
Squier himself admits that it is i^ossible to construct them of considerable 
size without the aid of instruments, though one over a mile in circumfer- 
ence would, he thinks, olfer serious obstacles.* In a Avord, the labor 
invohed in the erection of these works was purely manual, and per- 
fectly homogeneous. It did not even necessarily imply the use of me- 
chanical aids of any kind, though it is probable that the rude stoue 
hoe or spade and a basket — one to loosen the earth, and the other to 
transport it — were both employed; and these (be it remembered) were 
within reach of every Indian family east of the Mississippi and south 
of the Great Lakes. 

The fact then as to the character of this labor being as stated, it 
would seem to follow that a people who could have erected one of 
these works, be it a mound or an embaidcment, might have built any 
and all of them; and of course, if it can be shown that the red Indian 
has, within the historic epoch, thrown up mounds 5 or 10 feet high, 
and of proportionate size, there can be no reason why, given time, of 
which he had an unlimited supply, or an increased number of work- 
men, he could not have made them ten times as large had he been so 
inclined. To deny this involves the necessity of showing that there 
existed, in mound-building, some point bej^ond which the efforts of the 
Indian could not go — some limit to the number of baskets full of earth 
he might bring — and this will scarcely be undertaken by the hardiest 
advocate of the theory of the two civilizations. Indeed, it is only 
necessary to put the matter in this broad light, to ask where it is pro- 
posed to run this line of demarcation, and how it was found, in order 
to show the absurdity of any attempt to set up a standard that will 
enable us to say, definitely, whether any given earthwork was built 
by the recent Indians or by the so-called mound-builders. 

With tliis fact clearly understood, we are now ready to take up the 
evidence that points to the red Indian of modern times as the builder 
of these works; and by way of beginning, let us h)ok into the truth of 
the oft-repeated statement that he had no tradition as to their origin, 
and the pur])oses for which they were erected. So far as my imme- 
diate argument is concerned, this is to some extent a work of superero- 
gation. Tradition is at best but an unsafe guide, and even if it were 

*Anc. Mon., p. 61. Bearing upon this point is the statement of Miss A. C. Fletcher, 
that the Ogalalla Sioux, when marking out the ground for the sun dance, raise up a 
pole in the center, and tlien, with a rawhide cord as a radius, draw a circle of the 
required size, say from 200 to 300 feet in diameter.

not, the fact that the Iiidiaus could not give auy account of these 
structures would carry hut little if any weight, for the reason that it 
is negative evidence \mve and simple, and as such must give way to 
tlie well-authenticated instances of mound-building among the Natchez 
and other historic tribes. Upon this point there can be no difference 
of opinion, and though it clearly shows the worthlessness of tradition 
as the basis for an argument in the present discussion, yet the state- 
ment as to the absence of all accounts of the origin of these works is 
so often repeated, and AAith such seeming confidence, that the investi- 
gation would be incomplete without some inquiry into its truth. Espe- 
cially is this so in view of the fact that like all wholesale generalizations 
it has a certain foundatiou in truth, though this is believed to be en- 
tirely too slight to justify us ill accepting the statement in the shape 
in which it has come down to us. That certain Indians — the number 
is immaterial — were without any tradition upon the subject of these 
mounds is extremely probable; and if the early writers had confined 
themselves to a statement of this fact, there would have been no ques- 
tion as to its acceptance. But when generalizing (as was too often 
their wont) from the few instances that came under their observation, 
they tell us that "the Indians" or that -'certain tribes" were equally 
ignorant, then it is time to call a halt, and inquire into the validity of 
the evidence upon which the statement rests. To do this thoroughly 
involves no little labor. Trustworthy authorities must be examined — 
the more the better, — and if they fail to bear out the general conclu- 
sion, as will almost always be found to be the case, there is no 
alternative but to so modify this conclusion as to bring it in accord 
with the newly-discovered evidence. As an instance of the good re- 
sults that sometimes follow this method of interpreting the old chron- 
iclers, take the assertion of the younger Bartram that "the Cherokees 
are as ignorant as we are, by what people or for what purpose these 
artificial hills were raised."* He is speaking of the mound upon which 
stood the council house in their town of Oowejt and it is of course very 
probable that the Indians of whom he made the inquiry did not know 
who built this particular mound; at least there can be no doubt that 
they told liim so, ;ind that he believed them. 

Xow Bartram's visit to tlie Cherokees was a. hurried one; he saw 
but few of their towns, ;<nd could not possibly haveconversed with but 
a small portion of their people, and yet his statement is couched in the 



*Bartrain'8 Travels, p. 367: Philadelphia, 1791. He adds: ''But they have a tra- 
dition common witli tlie other nations of Indians, that they fonud them in much the 
same condition as they now appear, when their forefathers arrived from the West 
and possessed themselves of the country after vanquishing the nations of red men 
who then inhahited it, who themselves fonud tliese mounds when they took jiosses- 
sion of the country, the former possessors delivering" the same story concerning 
them." 

t'l'liis distinction must he kept in uiiud, as /. c, p. I>4S. lie si)eaks of '• vast heaps

broadest terms possible, and includes all the members of tlie tribe of 
every age, size, sex, and condition. Obviously his assertion is not 
warranted by the facts, nor is it borne out by the testimony of concur- 
rent writers. So far from being without any tradition on this subject, 
this people can be shown to have had several, or at all events they so 
reported. Thus, about the year 1782, Oconostoto, Avho had been for 
sixty years one of their chiefs, being asked by Governor Sevier,* of 
Tennessee, who built the earth-works in their country, and particu- 
larly "the remarkable fortification," as it is called, on the Iliawassee 
River, answered that "it was handed down by their forefathers, that 
these works were made by the wliUGpeopU^\\o had formerly inhabited 
the country." Gen. Geo. Eogers Clark,t who probably knew as mucli 
of Indian character as any one who has ever written on the subject, 
says positively that there was a tradition among the Cherokees to the 
effect that the works in their country were built by their ancestors; 
and this statement is borne out by the chroniclers of De Soto's expedi- 
tion,! as well as by the testimony of Adair, § who seems to have had no 
doubt by whom these mounds were built, or for wliat purpose, though 
he admits that some of them were beyond the reach of tradition. 

Here then in this one tribe, we have several accounts of these 
works. They can not all be true, and it is possible that neither one 
of them maybe; and yet either one of them is a sufficient answer to 

*See letter of Gov. Sevier in Stoddard's Sketches of Louisiana, p. 483: Phila- 
delphia, 1812. Eeiug questioned as to who these Avhite people were, the old chief 
replied : "That he had heard his grandfather and other old people say that they were 
a xjeople called the AVelsh," etc. For a summary of what has been written about a

t" I think the world is to blame to express such great anxiety to know who it was 
that built these numerous and formidable works, and what hath become of that peo- 
ple. They will iind them in the Kaskaskias, Peorias, Kahokias (now extinct), 
PiankeshaAvs, Chickasaws, Cherokees, and such old nations, who say they grew out 
of the ground where they now live, and that they wove formerly as numerous as the 
trees in the woods; but affronting the Givat Sjiirit, heniacle war among the nations, 
and they destroyed each other. This is their tradition, aud I can see no good reason 
why it should not be received as good history — at least as good as a great part of 
ours:" MSS. of Gen. Geo. K. Clark, in vol. iv, Schoolcraft, Indian Trihcs of the 
United States, p. 135. 

tin the Tenth Annnal lieport of the Peahody Museum at Cambridge, p]). 75 ef seq., I 
have given some of the reasons for believing that the Cherokees built mounds and 
earth-works. 

v3 -'We frequently meet with great mounds of earth, either of a circular or oblong 
form, having a strong breastwork at a distance around them, made of the clay which 
had been dug up in forming the ditch on the inner side of the inclosed ground, and 
these were their forts of security against an enemy. Three or four of them are, in 
some places, raised so near to each other as evidently for the garrison to take any 
enemy that passed between them. They were mostly built in loAV lands; and some 
are overspread witli large trees, beyond the reach of Indian tradition:" History of 
the American Indians, p. 377: London, 1775. 



THE MOUNDS OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 565 

tilt* .stateiiKMifc that the IndiiMis had no tradition as to the origin of 
those strnctures, or the purpose for which they were built. Nor must 
it be supposed that the Cherokees were alone in this respect; neither 
were these stories confined to any one stock or family of tribes. They 
are found on both sides of the Ohio, and were as current (and for that 
matter as varied and often quite as contradictory) among nations of 
tlie Hnron and Algonquin faniilies as they were among the Cherokees. 
In fact, it is believed to be tlie exception to find a single prominent 
tribe living within the region of the mounds in which some tradition 
on the subject of their origin was not more or less common. Whether 
these traditions were true or false, or whether the event that was pur- 
ported to be handed down was tiict or fable, are points which it is not 
necessary to discuss. All that I am called upon to show is, that the 
Indians had traditions, no matter what their character, upon this sub- 
ject; and in doing this, I shall limit myself to a representative tribe 
from each family, and by way of making' the tradition as definite as 
possible, will pick out typical works or groups, situated in different 
portions of the country, so that there can be no doubt as to the par- 
ticular tribe, or tlu* i^recise kind of earthwork that is meant. 

First of all, let us take up the mounds and inclosures of western New 
York, and see what the Iroquois had to say as to their origin. Accord- 
ing" to one account, the country "about the lakes was thickly inhabited 
by a race of civil, (interprising, and industrious people, who were totally 
destroyed, and whose improvements were taken possession of by the 
Senecas."* The Rev. Mr. Kirkland, while on a missionary tour to 
this tribe, A. d. 1788, visited several of these "old forts," one of which, 
situated in Genesee County, near Batavia (Squier), and known to the 
Indians as the " double-fortified town, or a town with a fort at each end," 
is thus described: The first of these forts "contained about 4 acres of 
ground. The other, distant from this about 2 miles, and situated at the 
other extremity of the ancient town, inclosed twice that quantity of 
ground. The ditch around the former was about 5 or 6 feet deep. A 
small stream of water and a high bank circumscribed nearly one-third 
of the inclosed ground. There were the traces of six gates or avenues 
round the ditch, and near the center a way was dug to the water. 
- - - A considerable number of large thrifty oaks had grown up 
within the inclosed ground, both in and upon the ditch; some of them 
appear to be at least two hundred years old or more. - - - Near the 
northern fortification, which was situated on high ground, he found the 
remains of a funeral pile. - - - The earth was raised about 6 feet 
above the common surface, and betwixt 20 and 30 feet diameter. The 
bones appeared on the whole surface of the raised earth, and stuck out in 
many i)laces on the si<les."+ According to the same author, Indian

tradition says ''these works were raised, and this battle was tbiiglit 
betwixt the Senecas aud Western Indians. - - In this great battle 

the Senecas affirmed that their ancestors won the victory. Some say 
their ancestors had told them there were 800 of their enemies slain ; others 
inchide the killed on both sides in that number. Be this as it may, all 
their historians agree that the battle was fonght where this heap of 
slain are buried, before the arrival of the Euvojteans, some say three, 
some four, others five lives or ages, reckoning a life or age one hundred 
winters or colds."* Another tradition represents that these works were 
erected by the ancestors of the Iroquois in their wars with other tribes t 
aud with the French. :j: Assuming that these two traditions refer to dif- 
ferent periods in the national life of the Six Nations, they do not conflict. 
In fact, they fit in together very closely, and as Mr. Squier has shown 
that these remains are but the abandoned village sites of the recent 
Indiaus,§ they may be said to be sustained by the traditions of the 
Iroquois as to their expulsion from the region near Montreal, and their 
seizure and occupation of central and western New Yoik.|l 
Proceeding towards the southwest, we come next to the Ohio system 

* MSS. of Rev. Mr. Kiikland, /. c, p. 39. It will be seen that this account leaves 
it uncertain whether these works were erected by the Senecas or the Western Indians. 
So far as my purpose is concerned, it is immaterial which of these tribes built them. 
The following extract from Governor DeWitt Clinton will, howevei*, clear up the diffi- 
culty: "Some of the Senecas told Mr. Kirkland, the missionary, that those in their 
territory were raised by their ancestors in their wars with the Western Indians."

t Farmers Brother told Dr. King that the mounds were thrown up against the in- 
cursions of the French. This was about 1810, at which time he was 94 years old: 
Drake's Indians of North America, fifteenth edition, p. 604. There is another tra- 
dition given by Governor DeWitt Clinton in the f'o//<'cfioHs of the N. Y. Hist., Sac, vol. 
II, p. 92, to the effect that "these works were thrown up by an army of Spaniards," 
etc. I do not think it necessary to give it in the text, as it is probable that the 
tradition is as false as the event to which it relates is improbable. However, it 
may be well to add that Brant, the famous Mohawk chief, in vol. ii, p. 484, of his 
life, speaks of a tradition that "prevailed among the different nations of Indians 
throughout that whole extensive range of country, and had been handed down time 
immemorial, that in an age long gone by there came white men from a foreign 
country, and, by consent of the Indians, established trading houses and settlements 
where these tumuli are found. A friendly intercourse was coutinued for several 
years; many of the white men brought their wives and had children born to them 
- - - These circumstances at length gave rise to jealousies," aud the colony was 
ultimately destroyed. Brant expressed no opinion as to the truth of the tale, but 
added : "that from the vessels and tools which had been dug up in those mounds, or 
found in their vicinity, it was evident that the people who had used them were 
French.

of works, and liert^ ai;';uii we liavo .several traditions as to their origin. 
One of these, handed down among the Leuni Lenape — an Algonquin 
tribe — is to the effect that when they had reached the Mississippi in 
their migration eastward, they found the country east of that river in- 
habited by a powerful nation, called the Allegewi, who had many large 
towns built on the great rivers flowing through their land. At first 
they gave the Leuni Lenape, or Delawares, as we call them, leave to 
pass through their country, and seek a settlement fiirther to the east; 
but for some reason they attacked them whilst crossing the river, and 
inflicted great loss upon them. The Lenni Lenape then formed an alli- 
ance with the Mengwe or Iroquois, who were also on their way to the 
east in search of a home, and together they made war upon the Alle- 
gewi, stormed their towns and fortitications, and tinally expelled them 
from the country. Heckewelder,* to whom we are indebted for the story, 
says that he liad seen many of their fortifications, one of which, situ- 
ated on the Huron Ixiver, east of the Sandusky, about G or 8 miles from 
Lake Erie, he describes as consisting of "walls or banks of earth reg- 
ularly thrown up, with a deep ditch on the outside. - - - Outside 
of the gateway were a number of large flat mounds, in w^hich, the Indian 
l)ilot said, were buried hundreds of the slain Allegewi." In another 
account t we are told that it was a tradition of the Kaskaskias, Pianke- 
shaws, and other tribes, that these "fortified towns/' "entrenched en- 
campments," or "garrisoned forts, many of them with towers of earth 
of considerable height to defend the walls with arrows and other missile 
weapons, - - - were the works of their forefathers," who were as 
numerous as the trees in the wood ; but that, having afironted the Great 
Spirit, he made them kill one another. 

Speaking of the collection of mounds in the river bottom opposite St. 
Louis, just below the old French village of Cahokia, one of the largest 
mound centers in the United States, Baptist Ducoign, a Kaskaskia 
chief, told Gen. Geo. Rogers Clark that it was " the palaace of his fore- 
fathers, when they covered the whole (country) and had large towns; 
tliat all those works we saw there were the fortifications round the 
town, which must have been very considerable; that the smaller works 
we (saw) so far within the larger, comprehended the real palaace; that 
the little mountain we there saw flung up with a basin on top, was a

also thiit curious mixture of fact aud fable, Cusick's History of the Six Kations. John 
Norton, a Mohawk chief (in vol. ir of Life of Joseph Brant, note onp.486: Albany, 
18(5.^), says, ''There was a tradition in his tribe that they were constructed by a 
people who, in ancient times, occupied a gieat extent of country, but who had been 
extirpated; that there had been lonij and bloody wars between this people and the 
Five Nations, in which the latter had been finally victorious."

tower tliat contaiued part of tlie guard belonging to the prince, as from 
the top of that height they could defend the King's house with their 
arrows," etc.* 

If now we cross the Ohio, and inquire of the Creeks or Muscogees 
as to the origin of the works that are scattered throughout their coun- 
try, we shall find that they too ascribed them to their ancestors, 
though they differed as to the i)uriioses for which some of them were 
erected. According to one account a certain class of " conic mounds of 
earth" were thrown up as places of refuge against high wnter; whilst 
a more probable tradition speaks of them as tombs of the dead, or parts 
of "an ancient Indian town,"t possibly the sites of the cabins of their 
chiefs and of their council-houses or temples. In 1847, Sekopechi,| 
one of the oldest Creeks then living, speaking- of the former condition 
of his tribe, said that they erected breast- works of a circular shape for 
the protection of their families, and that the mounds had no existence 
previous to their arrival. Adair § tells us that "they had a special 
name for their old round earthern forts;" and Bartram,|| speaking of 
"the artificial mounds or terraces, squares and banks encircling consid- 
erable areas" — the monuments or traces of an ancient town that once 
stood on the east bank of the Ocmulgee, near the old trading road, 
adds : "If we are to give credit to the accounts the Creeks give of them- 
selves, this place is remarkable for being the first town or settlement 

*MSS. of Gen. Clark, I. c, p. 135. He adds : "I had somewhere seen some ancient 
account of the town of Kaskaskia, formerly containino- 10,000 persons. There is not 
one of that nation at present known hy that namp. - - - I one day set out to see 
whether we could discover signs of such a population. We easily and evidently 
traced the town for upwards of 5 miles in the beautiful plain below the present 
town of Kahokia. There could be no deception here, because the remains of ancient 
works were thick — the whole were mounds, etc. - - - Fronting nearly the center 
of this town, on the heights, is a pinnacle called the Sugar (Loaf), from its figure. 
- - - I at once saw that it was a hill, shaped by a small brook breaking through 
the (larger) hill till it had formed a very narrow ridge. This had been cut across, 
and the point shaped in the form of a sugar loaf, perhaps to place an idol or a temple 
on, as it could not be more conspicuous. It is of a very considerable height, and you 
are obliged to wind round it to ascend on horseback." 

t Hawkins, Sketch of Creek Country, p. 38. Schoolcraft (vol. iv, p. 127), quoting 
a MSS. copy of the "Sketch," says : "They were also designed to entomb the remains 
of their distinguished dead." Bartram {Travels, p. 522) says that the Indiaas have 
a tradition that the vast four-square terraces, chunk yards, etc., at Apalachucla, old 
town, were "the ruins of an ancient Indian town and fortress."

or traces of an ancient town, such .is artificial moiints or terraces, squares, and

where they sat down (as rlicy term il) or establislK^l thciiiselves after 
their emigration from the West, beyond the Mississippi, their original 
native country. On this \(mg journey they suffered great and innu- 
merable difficulties, encountering and vanquishing numerous and val- 
iant tribes of Indians, who opposed and retarded their march. Having 
crossed the liver, still pushing eastward, they were obliged to make a 
stand and fortify themselves in this place as their only remaining hope, 
being to the last degree persecuted and weakened by their surrounding 
foes. Having formed for themselves this retreat, and driven off the in- 
habitants by degrees, they recovered their spirits, and again faced their 
enemies, Avhen they came off' victorious in a memorable and decisive 
battle. They afterwards gradually subdued their surrounding enemies, 
strengthening themselves by taking into confederacy the vanquished 
tribes."* These are a few of the traditions that have come down to us 
as to the origin of these works, and although, when considered by 
themselves, they are not perhaps of much historical importance, yet, 
inasmuch as the question is not as to their truth, bat as to their exist- 
ence, they answer my purpose as well as if each one of them were 
founded on fact, and had been handed down from generation to gener- 
ation without a break or a blemish. 

In regard to the credibility of these different accounts, a few words 
may not be out of place. As has been said before, they can not all be 
true, though there is no reason why some of them may not rest upon a 
basis of fact. Take for instance the tradition, found in some shape 
among almost all tribes, that these works were built by their ancestors, 
and test it as we may, it will be seen that so far from being impossible, it 
is rendered more than probable by the fact that some of the most elabor- 
ate of these remains can be shown to have been erected since the arrival 
of the whites. The evidence of this is furnished by the mounds them- 
selves, or rather by their contents, and consists of articles of European 
manufacture that were buried with the body over which the mound was 
originallj'^ erected. As an instance of this, take the series of works at 
Circleville, Ohio, to which a reference has been made on a preceding 
, page.t It is composed of a circle, square, and mounds, all of which are 

* Aud yet, on ii. 520, lie tells us that the region between the Savanna and Ocmulgee 
rivers "was last possessed by the Cherokees, since the arrival of the P^uropeaus, but 
they were afterwards dispossessed by the Mnscogulges ; and all that country was, 
probably, many ages preceding the Cherokee invasion, inhabited by one nation or 
confederacy, who were ruled by the same system of laws, customs, and language; but 
so ancient that the Cherokees, Creeks, or the nation they conquered, could render no 
account for what purpose tliese monuments were raised." On p. 456 the same state- 
ment is made in regard to a post or cohimn of pine, 40 I'eet high, that stood in the 
town of Autassee, "on a low, circular, artificial hill," and as this pole could not have 
been standing for very n)any generations, it is evident that the Indian's account of 
what liis aucestius did or did not know must be taken Avith a great deal of allowance.

SO joiued together that tliey juiist have formed parts of oue connected 
Avhole. Near the center of the circle or, as it is called, " the round 
fort," Avhich as we have seen, had once been inclosed by palisades, was 
a tumulus of earth about 10 feet in height and several rods in diameter 
at its base. On its eastern side and extending G rods from it, was a 
semicircular i^avement composed of pebbles, such as are now formed 
in the bed of the Scioto Eiver, from whence they appear to have been 
brought. The summit of this tumulus was level, nearly 30 feet in 
diameter, and there was a raised way to it leading from the east, like a 
modern turnpike.* The earth composing this mound was entirely 
removed in the presence of Mr. At water, and there were found lying 
on the original surface of the ground, and about 20 feet apart, the 
remains of two human skeletons that had evidently been burned. With 
one of these skeletons there was ' ' the handle either of a small sword or 
a large knife, made of an elk's horn ; around the end where the blade 
had been inserted was a ferrule of silver which, though black, was not 
much injured by time. Though the handle sliowed the hole where the 
blade had been inserted yet no iron was found, but. an oxide rem.ained 
of similar shape and size." With the other skeleton " there was a large 
mirrour about 3 feet in length, li feet in breadth^ and liinches in thick- 
ness. This mirrour was of isinglass {mica memhranaceu)^ and on it ( was) 
a plate of iron, which had become an oxide; but before it was disturbed 
by the spade resembled a plate of cast iron." 

A quantity of arrow-heads and spear-points were found with one of 
the skeletons; but of these it is unnecessary to speak, as they proba- 
bly did not differ from those that lie scattered about everywhere iutlie 
Ohio Valley, and they can not therefore (except indirectly) throw any 
light upon the origin of these works. Not so however with tlie arti- 
cles of iron and silver. These do tell a story; and whilst tliey do not 
indicate the precise period of time when this mound was erected, yet 
they enable us to say, with some degree of certainty, that it must have 
been subsequent to the arrival of the whites, for the reason that the 
nations that held the Mississippi Valley previous to that event, whether 
Mound-builder or recent Indian, may in a general way be said to have 
been unacquainted with any metal except native copper ; and this they 
simply hammered into shape, or possibly " having melted it," they 
"spread it into sheets," as Champlain [Voyages, vol. ii, p. 230: Boston, 
1878) tells us they sometimes did, before submitting it to the process 
of malleation. Of the manufacture of iron they appear to have been 
ignorant; and though the recent Indians were unquestionably ac- 
quainted with silver, beat it into ornaments, and in all j)robability

sometimes overlaid copper with it,* yet tUe evidence of its use is rela- 
tively so slight as scarcely to merit recogiiitiou. Upon these points all 
archaM)l<)oists are agreed; and when therefore we are told, upon 
anthority that has never been qne.stioned, that implements of iron and 
silver were found with the charred bones of a person, over whose re- 
mains a most elaborate mound had been erected, it is proof positive of 
the recent origin of this particular mound, and inferentially of the 
group of works of which it formed a component part. There is no es 
capiiig this conclusion except upon the theory that the people who 
erected these works, supposing them to liave belonged to a different 
race from the Indians, were acquainted with the use of iron and silv^er; 
and to admit this is virtually to re- write the arclneology of the Missis- 
sippi Valley. 

Kor is this the only instance in which objects of European manufac- 
ture have been found under such circumstances as to indicate that they 
were used by the people who found shelter behind these earthen walls. 
In Tennessee, near Murfreesboro,t similar discoveries have been made, 

* "One of them had hanging about his neck a round phite of red copper, wellpol- 
ishcd, witli a small one of silver Ining in the middle of it; and on his ears a small 
plate of copper, with which they wipe the sweat away from their bodies:" Ribault 
(1502), in Hist. Coll. of Louisiana, p. 178: New York, 1875. Both Ribault and 
Landouniere make repeated mention of silver and even gold, but the latter writer 
(Hakluyt, vol. in, p. 369) tells lis that it is " gotten out of the shippes that are lost 
upon the coast, as I haveunderstood, by thesauagesthemselues." Harlot (Hakluyt, 
vol. Ill, p. 327: London, 1810), speaks of "two small pieces of siluer grosly beaten 
- - - hanging in the ears of a Wiroans; - - - of whom, through inquiry, - - - 
1 learned that it had come to his hands from the same place or neere, where I after 
understood the copper was made, and the white graiuosof metall found. The afore- 
sayd co])per we also found by tryail to lioldc siluer." In this connection the copper 
"bosses overlaid with a thick plate of silver," found by Dr. Hildreth in a mound 
at Marietta, Ohio, becomes of interest. Judge Force, to whom I have so often had 
occasion to refer, examined one of these specimens, and tells us {To what Jtace did 
tlte Motind-hnilders lielontj, p. 49), that- "it is native copper hammered into shape." 
He also adds that "in the Lake Superior mines silver is found in connection with 
the copper, and the miners there now, taking advantage of good specimens, hammer 
them into rings, with the silver on the exterior surface, making copper rings, sih'^er- 
plated by nature, preciselj^ as the Mound-builder artisan did who made the boss at 
Marietta," and we may add, as the Florida Indian did, who made the ornament 
si)i>ken of by Ribaiill . In another mound at Marietta, half a mile east of the earth- 
works, was founil a silver cu]), evidently not of Indian workmanship, which School- 
vvwit {Lead MinvH of Missouri, p. 271: New York, 1819) describes. It belonged to 
a Mr. Hill, of Cahokia, and, according to tliat gentleman, had been brought to light 
by tlie gralual washing away of the mound by a small stream which ran at jtsbase.

wliiLst in Ntnv York* and Florida these '^ liuds," as they are commonly 
called, have been so frequent as to make it unnecessary to refer to them 
in detail, and 1 content myself with the following extract from the four- 
teenth annual report of the Peabody Museum, t which it is needless to 
say is heartily indorsed. Speaking of some discoveries made by Dr. 
David Mack, jr., in the course of his explorations in Orange County, 
Fla., Mr. Putnam holds the following emphatic language : '* One group 
of mounds was inclosed by an embankment, and was very likely the 
site of an Indian village. In a burial mound in this group a numl)er of 
ornaments made of silver, copper, and brass Avere found, also glass beads 
and iron implements, which were associated with pottery and stone 
implements of native make. This furnishes (jonclusive evidence that 
the Indians of Florida continued to build mounds over their dead after 
European contact; for the care with which the exploration was made, 
and the depth at which the skeletons and their associated objects were 
found are conclusive as to the burials being the original ones and not 
those of an intrusive people." It is unnecessary however to pursue 
this branch of the subject any farther. The instances < [noted above, 
admitting them to be true (and I do not see how it can be doubted), 
prove very clearly the recent origin of the particular mounds and works 
to which they refer. To increase the number of such extracts is simply 
to accumulate evidence upon a j)oint about which there can not be two 
opinions. 

Having thus cleared our minds of some of the illusions in which 
this subject has been enveloped, let us now turn to the early chroniclers? 
and see what they really do tell us of the origin of these works. In 
examining into this evidence, the division heretofore made of these 
remains, into mounds and embankments or inclosuies, will be adhered 
to, though the order in which they are to be taken up Avill be reversed, 
and the mounds will be first considered. These will be treated under 
the heads of (1) Stone heai)s or cairns; (2) Conical mounds of earth or 
burial mounds, and (3) Truncated or temple mounds. There are, of 
course, other divisions, but for my x>urpose these are believed to be 
sufficient, as, with the exception of the animal mounds, about which 
nothing definite is known,| all the rest, so far as size and mode of con-

striictioii are concerned, maybe brongbt under one or the other of the«e 
heads, though it is not intended thereby to assert anything as to the 
object or purpose for which they were erected, except in so far as it is 
made known to us by the authorities to whom a reference may be 
necessary. 

First. Beginning- with the stone heaps or cairns, we are informed 
that they were either intended to commemorate some notable event, as 
a treaty of peace,* a victory, the settlement of a vilUige, the passage of 
a war i)arty,t or else they were thrown up as hmdmarks, or as me- 
morials over the dead.i: They seem to have been very widely distrib- 
uted througliout the area of the United States, as they are to be 
found as far to the eastward as New England; § they are more or less 



of our knowledge. The ouly statement that I find in any of the early chroniclei's 
which can possibly bo construed into a reference to these mounds is in Charlevoix 
( Trarelx, vol. ii, p. 48), and even in this case it can only he so construed by supposing 
tliat by " the great beaver" is meant the " beaver" gens of some tribe. Charlevoix 
there speaks of a mountain, near Lake Nipissing, in the shape of a beaver, and says: 
"The Indians maintain that it was the great beaver who gave this form to the 
mountain after he had made choice of it for his burial place. They never pass 
- - - without oifering him the smoke of their tobacco." 

* Beverly, Virginia, book in, i>. 27: "They use formal embassies lor treating, and 
very ceremonious ways in concluding of iieace, or else some other memorable action, 
such as burying a tomahaAvk and raising au heap of stones thereon." Brinton, in 
Amcr. Auti(iuarian for October, 1881, (iuoting Blomes, says of the tribes south of the 
Savannah river, "that they erected i)iles or pyramids of stones on the occasion of a 
successful contlict, or when they founded a new village." 

t "We observed a pile of stones, - - - whi(!h I was informed had been thrown 
up as a monument by the Osages when they were going to war, each warrior casting 
a stone upon the pile:" Nuttall, Arkansa Territory, p. 149: Philadelphia, 1821. 
This may have been merely a "landmark:" Our Wild Indians, by Col. Dodge, p. 
.5.57 : Hartford, 1882. 

X "To perpetuate the memory of any remarkable warriors killed in the woods, I 
nuist here observe, that every Indian traveller as he passes that way throws a stone 
on the place, according as he likes or dislikes the occasion or manner of the death 
of the deceased : '' Adair, p. 184. 

i^N Mountain Mtmument, in Berkshire County, Mass., is so called from the fact that 
at its southern extremity is, or was a few years since, a pile of small stones, erected, 
according to tradition, in memory of a woman of the Stockl)ridgo tribe, who killed 
herself by k'aping from the precipice:" W. C. Bryant, Notes to Poems: Philadel- 
pliia, 1849. According to the Amer. Journal of Science, vol. vii, p. 159, mention is 
made in Dr. Dwight's Travels in Conneciicnt, etc., " of two of these stone tumuli, 
wliich appear to have been erected over offenders against the law." See also Abo- 
riginal Mon. of New Yoi'k, p. 160, for au account taken from Hopkins's Memoir of the 
I lousatonic Indians, of the erection of " a largo heap of stones, - - - probably 
10 cart loads, in the way to Wanhtukool', which the Indians have thrown together as 
they passed I>y the place; for it used to be their custom, every time one passed by, 
to throw a stone upon it," etc. I must confess that 1 don't know Avhere this cairn 
was situated or when it was built, and it does not much matter, as from the name 
of the tribe it is evident they were of New England origin. See also Dorman,

numerous in New York, * throughout the Ohio Valley, t and the States 
still further to the south, | whilst in the West they are known to have 
been erected, within the present generation, by ^'tribes liviug in the 
Eoeky Mountains and the Sierra I^evadas."§ In point of size there is 
a wide difference among them. A large majority consists of not more 
than "two or three cart-loads of stone," though Squier speaks of one 
situated near the Indian trail that led from the Shawnee village at 
Cliillicothe to the mouth of the Scioto Eiver as being rectangular in 
shape, and originally quite symmetrical in outline, and measuring 106 
feet long by 60 broad, and from 3 to 4 feet high.|| Where intended 
as memorials of the dead they are sometimes piled up over a single 
corpse, or they may serve to mark the site of one or more of those 
general interments, when the dead of an entire village or a clan, for a 
number of years, were collected together and buried in one common 
grave.^] This latter form of burial was not confined to any one family 
or stock of tribes, but seems to have been common to all, and was 
always attended with great ceremony.

^Col. C. W. Jenckes, superintendent of the Corundum mines in western North

five hundred years. In this time they have buried their dead under huge piles of 
stones. We have at one point the remains of 600 warriors under one pile:" Foster, 
Prehistoric Races, p. 149: Chicago, 1873. As the Cherokees had held the region 
where this cairn Avas situated from time immemorial, this was probably one of their 
graA^es. That they did bury their dead in this fashion may be inferred from a state- 
ment of Adair, who tells us, in a note to p. 185, that " the Cheerake do not now col- 
lect the bones of their dead, yet they continue to raise and multiply heaps of stones 
as monuments of their dead." See also Anc. Mon. of the Miss. Valley, p. 184, for an 
account of a similar interment in Pickaway County, Ohio.

interesting accounts of the manner in which these funerals \yeie con- 
ducted among the Huron and Algonciuin tribes of the north; and the 
frequent mention made oftlie custom of the Indians south of the Ohio 
of preserving- the bones of tlie dead* leaves no doubt as to the preva- 
lence of this form of interment throughout all that region, from the 
time of De Sotot down to a comparatively recent period, even if there 
were not other and positive evidence oftlie fact. It is worthy of note, 
however, that neither one of the Jesuit lathers named makes any men- 
tion of the erection of a mound or cairn upon the occasion of one of 
these general burials, or, in fact, at any other time, though Morgan, 
speaking of the funeral customs of the Iroquois, is of the opinion that 
the "barrows and bone mounds, which have been found in such num- 
bers in various parts of the country," are to be ascribed to the practice 
of disposing of their dead in this fashion, and this is confirmed by De 
Vries. J Be this as it may, there seems to be good ground for the asser- 
tion that some of the tribes belonging to the Huron- Iroquois family 
were, at onetime and under certain conditions, in the habit of erecting 
stone heaps over the single graves in which their dead were temporarily 
deposited. Lalitau§ states the fact positively, and Adair || tells us, on 
the authority of "a gentleman of distinguished character," that the 
Mohawks — one of the Six Nations — were accustomed thus to honor their 
dead. From other sources we learn that the Onondagas, another mem- 
ber of the same confederacy, whenever they lost a friend away from

home, buried him with great solemnity, and ever after \Yheu they passed 
that way, visited the spot, usually singing a mournful song, and cast- 
ing stones upon it."* 

Among the tribes of the Algonquin family, as well as among those 
inhabiting the Gulf States, and which, for the sake of convenience, we 
have called the Appalachians, the custom of erecting these stone heaps 
or cairns seems to have been more or less prevalent. Vander Donck 
tells us that the Indians of New Netherlands buried in graves, above 
which " they placed a large pile of wood, stone, or eartli " and around 
this "they placed palisades resembling a snmll dwelling.' i In Vir- 
ginia, according to Capt. Smith, the Powhatanic tribes had certain altar 
stones which stand "apart from their temples, some by their houses; 
and others in the woods and wildernesses; where they have had any 
extraordinary accident or encounter. As you travel by them they will 
tell you the cause of the erection, wherein they instruct their chil- 
dren; so that they are instead of records and memorials of their an- 
tiquities."! In Lawson's account of his journey through the Carolinas 
he speaks of a " sort of tomb; as where an Indian is slain, in that very 
place they make a heap of stones (or sticks, where stones are not to be 
found) ; to this memorial every Indian that passes by adds a stone to 
augment the heap, in respect to the deceased hero."§ The Cherokees, 
as we have seen above, also buried their dead in this same manner; || 
and among the Chickasaws, Choctaws, and tribes belonging to the 
Creek confederacy, with whom Adair lived and traded for so many 
years, it was not unusual, in the woods, " to see innumerable heaps of 
small stones in those places where, according to tradition, some of 
their distinguished people were either killed or buried till their bones 
could be gathered; there they add Pelion to Ossa, still increasing each 
heap, as a lasting monument and honor to them and an incentive to 
great actions." 1]

especially those inhabiting portions of the region now known as the

much the same manner. See Purchas Pilgrims, vol. iv, p. 1847, where the same com-

States of Missouri, Kansiis, and Arkansas, this same custom is said to 
have obtained. The Osages, as is elsewhere stated, erected, on one 
occasion, a i)ile of stones, as a monument, when they were going to 
war; and if we may credit the account giAcn by Hunter of the man- 
ners and customs of this and some other Western tribes,* they some- 
times, " at or soon after burial, cover the grave with stones, and for 
years after occasionally resort to it, and mourn over or recount the 
merits and virtues of its silent tenant." t This was not however the 
only form of interment i)racticed among them, as we are told that "this 
ceremony was performed differently, not only by different tribes, but 
by the individuals of the same tribe, - - - the body being some- 
times placed on the surface of the ground, between flat stones set edge 
upwards, and then covered over, lirst by similar stones, and then with 

* "What remains to be said of the ludians relates more particularly to the Osages, 
although it will apply Avith almost as much propriety to the Kansas, Mahas, and 
Ottawas. In I'act, if we except the roving bands, the circumstances of the Indians 
settled immediately to the west of the Missouri and Mississippi, are so very similar 
that the delineation of any particular nation or tribe will answer for them all," etc. : 
Hunter's Captivitu, p. 213: London, 1823. Exactly what amount of credence is to 
be placed in these " Memoirs " is a point about which opinions differ. Gen. Cass, in 
the North American Beview for .January, 1826, makes a savage attack upon the 
book, and introduces letters from .John Dunn (whose name Hunter took, and who 
had " treated him like a brother or son''), (Jen. Wm. Clark, and others, to the ettect 
that they never knew any such ])erson, and that it was not possible for the events of 
which he speaks to have happened without their knowledge. This is to some extent 
negative evidence, and does not amount to much ; l)uteven if it were true, and Hun- 
ter was a myth, and the work that bears his name was a compilation, it would only 
invalidate so much of the narrative as refers to his personal experiences whilst a 
prisoner. All the rest, including that i)ortion devoted to a description of the "Man- 
ners and Customs of Ht)me of the Western ludians, " would then become simply a 
question of fact, and as such would have to be decided, as all such matters are, by a 
comparison of authorities in order to see how far the statements are corroborated. 
A])i)lying this rule of evidence, it Avill be found that the reviewer, and not the com- 
piler, will suffer. To go no farther than the instances ((uoted in the text, we find 
undoubted evidence tliat the Osages have, within the ])resent century, built both 
stone heaps and burial mounds; and that if they did not bury in stone graves, the 
Dclawares, Kickapoos, and Shawnecs did, and these tribes can be shown to have 
lived within the region and inside of the time covered by Hunter's nari-ative. If, 
now, there were no such individual as Hunter, as the reviewer plainly intimates, 
then the compiler of the volume that bears his name must have manufactured the 
story out of whole cloth, Avhich is not probable, or else he must have obtained his 
information from some person who was cognizant of the existence at some time of 
this form of burial among the Indians. If, on the other hand. Hunter was a real 
personage, and the book is a genuine record of his experiences, then the statement 
must be accepted as true, for the reason that it is not only antecedently veiy proba- 
ble in itself, but because the .account he has given of the customs of the tril)e8 
among whom he clams to have been a prisoner, has not, as yet, been successfully, 
impugned.

earth brought a s]i(»rt distance."* To judge from this description, 
these graves do not differ from the so-called " stone graves" of Ten- 
nessee, and it need not surprise us therefore to hear that although 
these "Indians do not pretend to any correct knowledge of the tumuli 
or mounds that are occasionally met with in their country," yet " there 
are other elevations differing materially from the mounds - - - 
which were formerly, and are at present, exclusively devoted to bury- 
ing their dead," and which " are composed of stones and earth, placed 
in such a manner as to cover and separate one dead body from an- 
other,"t precisely as was the case in the stone grave mounds of the 
Cumberland Valley. | 

Nor is this the only kind of mound that the Osages arc said to have 
erected within the historic period, nor are they the only people of the 
Dahcotah stock who have been accustomed thus to bury their dead. 
Featherstonhaugh tells us that upon the unexpected death of one of 
their chiefs called by the French Jean Defoe, which took place whilst 
all the men of the tribe were hunting in a distant country, " his friends 
buried him in the usual manner, with his weaxjons, his earthern pot, 
and the usual accompaniments, and raised a small mound over his 
remains. When the nation returned from the hunt, this mound was 
enlarged at intervals, every man assisting to carry materials, and thus 
the accumulation of earth went on for a long period, until it reached its 
present height, when they dressed it oft' at the top in a conical form. 
The old chief further said that he had been informed and believed that 
all the mounds had a similar origin." § According to Lewis and Clarke, 
the Omahas, about the beginning of this century, erected a mound 12 
feet in diameter and 6 feet high over the body of their chief, Black- 
bird,|| and Catlin tells us that at the Eed Pipe Stone Quarry can be

p. 129;, glass Ijeads and iron rings were found in some of them.

^Excursion throii</]i the Slave States, pp. 70-71. The old chief further said 
that "the tradition had been steadily transmitted down from their ancestors, 
that tlie Whahsash (Osages) had originally emigrated from the East in great num- 
bers, the population being too dense for their hunting grounds; he described the 
forks of the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers, and the falls of the Ohio, Avhere 
they had dwelt some time, and where large bands had SM)arated from them, and 
distributed themselves in the surrounding country." This mound is probalily the 
same one which Beck {Gazetteer of Missouri, p. 308) describes as being ''one of the 
largest mounds in this country, thrown n\^ on this stream within thirty or forty 
years, by the Osages, near the great Osage village, in honor of one of their deceased 
chiefs."

seen " a moiiiid of a conical form of 10 feet height," which had been 
tlirown lip over the l)ody of a distinguished young Sioux, who had 
been accidentally killed whilst on a visit to that famous spot.* 

Crossing the Mississippi, we are told that the Chippewas, an Algon- 
quin tribe, having been successful in a battle with the Sioux, their 
women and children '' in celebrating the achievement, erected a mound 
from the adjacent surface, about 5 feet in height, and in diameter 8 or 
10 feet, upon the summit of which a pole 10 or 12 feet in length was 
planted, and to this pole tufts of grass, indicating the number of scalps 
and other trophies achieved, were tied ; around this mound the warriors, 
with their usmil ceremonies, indulged in mirth and exultations over the 
scalps of their fallen foes.''t Tins, it will be noted, is not a burial 
mound, but seems to have been thrown up to commemorate a victory, 
and I mention it particularly, as it may serve to shed some light upon 
the objecr or purpose for which the so-called anomalous mounds of Mr. 
Squier were constructed. That some of the Algonquin tribes were 
however in the habit of erecting mounds over their dead does not ad- 
mit of a doubt. De Yries (1(J4:2 — Voya<jes, p, 163: New York, 1853) 
tells us that the Indians about Fort Amsterdam (Xew York) "form the 
grave, 7 or 8 feet, in the shape of a sugar loaf, and place palisades 
around it;" and in the Jesuit Relations for the year Kill, it is said that 
the tribes in INIaine and farther to the eastward "build a. sort of pyra- 
mid" over their distinguished dead. According to ^IcKenney, a former 
superintendent of Indian affairs, the two mounds on Lake Winnebago, 
AVisconsin, known as Le Grand and Le Petit Butte des Morts, were 
erected ova'r the bodies of a number of Fox warriors who had been killed 
in a battle that took place near that spot between that tribe and the 
Iroquois.| Yan der Douck, too, as we have seen, is equally j)ositive as 

work for an account of how tlie mound was built. In Science for March 16, 1883, 
Mr. Frank La Flcchc, in a letter to Mr. Putnam, of the Peabodv Museum, says: "I 
made inquiries about the mound made by the Ouuihas, in which Big KU<. was buried, 
and was told that it was about as high as the shoulders of a tall man standing nj), 
and that he was buried with great ceremonies. His favorite horse was strangled to 
death by his grave, and most of his horses and household goods were giA'en to the 
poor." This was about 1825-'30. 

" Xorth America)! IndianH, vol. ii, p. 170: lioudon, 1876. He adds that the story 
Avas related to him by the father of the young man, a Souix chief, who was " visit- 
ing the Red Pipe Stone Quarry, with thirty others of his tribe, Avhenwe were there, 
and cried over the grave as ho related the stor^'."

to the erection of burial mounds by certain tribes of this family, and 
the same fact may be inferred from the account given by Mr. Jeflerson * 
of the opening of a mound that formerly stood on the Io\y grounds of 
the Rivanna- River, and which evidently covered a number of those com- 
munal interments of which we have already spoken. This mound was 
surrounded by a ditch, was about 40 feet in diameter, and had been 
about 12 feet high, before its height was reduced by cultivation. Trees 
were growing upon it that measured 12 inches in diameter. It is true 
that nothing is here said as to the time when, or the people by whom, 
this mound was built; but the circumstances under which it was re- 
visited by a band of Indians in Mr. Jefferson's time,t taken in connec- 
tion with the size of the trees, the condition of the bones and the fact 
that the mound was in close proximity, or "just opposite to some hills 
on which had stood an Indian town," affords strong evidence that some 
of the later interments fouud here must have taken place after the set- 
tlement of Jamestown in 1C07. 

In regard to the practice of the Huron-Iroquois in this respect, our 
accounts differ. Gen. Parker, in answer to the question whether the 
Six Nations, after the arrival of the whites, ever erected mounds of 
earth or stone over single graves, or at their general interments, says 
positively that he had never heard of the existence of any such custom 
among them, but that on the contrary they had always asserted that 
the bone mounds were built by a race of people who had preceded them 
ill the o(;cupancy of the land. He also says that the reasons assigned 
for the erection of these tumuli, as well as the methods by which they 
grew to their present size, were always given with great uniformity. 
This is very high authority, and yet in the present instance it can 
hardly be regarded as decisive, for the reason that it is negative evidence, 
and must give way to the positive testimony we have of the fact. Thus 
for instance Golden, speaking of their single interments, tells us that 
the Iroquois deposit the body in a large round hole and raise the earth 
in a round hill over it,i: and in this he confirms the statements previ- 
ously quoted of Lafitau and De Vries, the latter of whom {I. c, p. 154), 
describing the funeral ceremonies of the tribes living near the mouth of 
the Hudson, tells us that "their manner of living is for the most part 

New York, 1846. Other accounts represent this battle as having been fought be- 
tween the Foxes on one side and the French and Menonunees on the other. It is im- 
material to me Avho were the parties engaged against the Foxes.

tThis visit took phice about 1750, and is thus described: "On whatever occasion 
they," the mounds, "may have been made, they are of cousiderabh^ notoriety among 
the Indians : for a party passing, about thirty years ago through the part of the 
country where this barrow is, Avent through the woods directly to it, without any 
instructions or inquiry ; and having staid about it some time, with expressions Avliich 
were construed to be those of sorrow, tliey returned to the higli-road, which they had 
left about half a dozeu miles to pay tliis visit, and pursued their journey :" lb., p. 191.

like that of" tliose at Fort Oiaiijjc; who liowever aro a biavor and a 
more martial nation of Indians — by name, the Maquas — as belbre 
mentioned, and who hold most of the others along the river to Fort 
Amsterdam under tribute/' 

Of the bone mounds, or those whieh mark the site of one or more com- 
munal interments, our accounts, though somewhat meager, are not less 
explicit. According to La Fort, the Onondaga chief, different forms of 
burial existed among the Iroquois at different times, and he might also 
have added at the same time, when the conditions were different. Thus, 
in addition to the mode of interment already noticed, we are told that 
when numbers were slain in battle they " were gathered and laid in 
tiers one above another, and a high mound raised over them."* In par- 
tial confirmation of this, we have the statement of the Modern Senecas 
that the mound on Tonawanda Island was the burial place of the Neu- 
ters.t a kindred tribe, who were destroyed by the Iroquois about the 
middle of the seventeenth century; and there is also the mound visited 
by the Rev. Mr. Klrkland in 1788, and though the condition of " the 
bones upon its surface, and sticking out in many jilaces on its sides," 
is totally incompatible with any such antiquity as is claimed for it, yet 
there can be no reason why the account given by the Senecas of the 
circumstances under which it was built iiiay not be literally true. Es- 
specially is this so, in view of the fact tliat we have undoubted evidence 
that at a council, held in 1743, between the Onondagas and the Anti- 
coque Indians, the latter " gave broad belts of icampum^ 3 arm belts 
and 5 strings; one was to wipe clean all the blood they had spilt of the 
Five Kations, another to raise a tumulus over their graves, and to pick 
out the sticks, roots, or stones, and make it smooth on the top."| This 
is believed to be decisive of the matter, for construe the statement as 
we may, there can be no doubt that the Iroquois, or the people with 
whom they fought, were in the habit of building mounds over their 
dead; and, so far as my argument is concerned, it is perfectly imma- 
terial which of them (lid so, as the question is not what [)articular tribe 
constructed these mounds, but were they built by the red Indians of 
historic times "^ 

South of the Ohio, in the States along the Atlantic coast, certain 
tribes are said to have had the same custom. Lawson, describing the 
manner of interment among the Santees, one of the Carolina tribes, 
says: "A mole or pyramid of earth is raisM, the mould thereof being 
work'd very sm<K)th and even, sometimes higher or lower according to 
the dignity of the person whose monument it is. On the top thereof is 
an umbrella, made ridge- ways, like the roof of an lumse; this is sup- 
ported by nine stakes, or small posts, the grave being about six or

eight foot ill length and four foot iu breadth."* In Florida proper we 
are told that upon the death of a king he was buried with great 
solemnity, and the shell from which he usually drank was placed ou 
the tumulus, around which many arrows were stuck up. Le Moynet 
gives a picture of one of these graves — shell, arrows, and all — but 
either the drawing is most abominably foreshortened, or else the 
tumulus is too insignilicant to come within the scope of our inquiry. 
However, both this and the preceding interment belong to the class 
called single, and this may perhaps account for the size of the mounds 
erected over them. In each of the localities referred to the communal 
form of burial was also practiced, and in some cases, especially on the 
peninsula, mounds covering interments of this character have been 
found, which are not only of large size,| but which, from the nature of 
their contents, must have been thrown up after the arrival of the 
whites. That the tribes inhabiting the Gulf States, including under 
this head the Chickasaws, Cherokees, Choctaws, and the Muscogees 
and their allies, were at one time in the habit of erecting mounds over 
their dead does not admit of a doubt, though it is probable that the 
custom, like many others connected with their funeral rites, died out 
at an early day. 

Adair tells us that " many of these heaps are to be seen in all parts 
of North America; where stones could not be had, they raised large 
hillocks or mounds of earth, wherein they carefully deposited the bones 
of their dead, which were placed either in earthen vessels or in a simple 
kind of ark chests." § According to De Brahm, "A large conical mound 
near Savannah was pointed out to Gen. Oglethorpe as being the tomb 
of the Yamacraw chief, who had, many years before, entertained a 
great white man with a red beard;" || and the evidence of the younger 
(William) Bartram, to which we have so often had occasion to refer, 
is even more definite. Describing the burial customs of the Choctaws, 
that writer says: "As soon as a person is dead they erect a scaffold 18 
or 20 feet high in a grove adjacent to the town, where they lay the 
corpse, lightly covered with a mantle; here it is suffered to remain, 
visited and x>i"otected by the friends and relatives, until the flesh 
becomes putrid, so as easily to part from the bones, then undertakers, 
who make it their business, carefully strip the flesh from the bones, 
wash and cleanse them, and when dry and purified by the air, having 
provided a curiously- wrought chest or coffin, fabricated of bones and 
splints, they place all the bones therein, which is deposited in the bone- 
house, a building erected for that purpose in every town. And when

this house is (nil a j^eiieral solciiiu funeral takes phiee. When the 
nearest kindred or friends of the deceased, on a day appointed, repair 
to the bone-house and talvc up the respective coffins, and following- one 
another in order of seniority, the nearest relations attending their re- 
spective corpse, and the multitude following after them, all as one 
family, with alternate voice of Allelujah and lamentation slowly pro- 
ceeding on to the i)lace of general interment, where they place the 
coffins in order, forming a pyramid; and lastly, cover all over with 
earth, which raises a conical hill or mount." * 

The third and last class of mounds that we shall consider are the 
truncated, or, as they are sometimes called, temple mounds, with graded 
ways to their tops. They are comparatively numerous south of the 
Ohio, and are also found, though less frequently, as far north as the 
middle of the tier of States that lie along the northern bank of that 
river J but beyond this point they are believed to be unknown. Of 
their origin and use in the Southern States, and especially along the 
line of De Soto's march, there is abundant proof. The chroniclers of 
that enterprise are in fnll accord upon these points; and though it is 
not possible to make out the itinerary of that expedition, yet there is 
but little hazard in asserting that he was on both sides of the Missis- 
sippi, and visited not only the Muscogees and Choctaws of the Gulf 
States, but also the Cherokees ("Achalaque") and Chickasaws of Ten- 
nessee, and the Quapaws (Oapahas-Kappas) of northeastern Arkansas. 
Among all these tribes there was a general uniformity in the methods 
of building the cabins of their chiefs, and in laying out and fortifying 
their villages. La Yegat tells us that the town and house of the 
Cacicjue Ossachile were like those of all the other Caciques in Florida, 
and assigns this as the reason why, instead of describing this particular 
town and house, it was better to give one general account that would 
answer for all. He then goes on to say that the Indians always en- 
deavor to place their villages on elevated sites; but as such situations, 
with the conveniences for building, are not always to be found in Florida, 
"they themselves throw up elevations in this manner. They choose a 
spot to which they bring a (luantity of earth, and this they pile up in the 
shape of a platform, two or three pike's length in height, and large 
enough on top to hold ten or twelve, fifteen or twenty houses, in which 
are lodged the Ca('i(iue and his attendants. At the foot of this mound 
they lay out a square, proportioned to the size of the intended town,

of the Yamasees, Avho were here slain by the Creeks iu the last decisive battle, the 
Creeks having driven them to this point, between the doubling of the river, where 
few of them escaped the fury of the conquerors. These graves occupied the whole 
grove, consisting of 2 or 3 acres of ground; there were nearly thirty of these ceme- 
teries of the dead, nearly of an equal size and form; they were oblong, 20 feet in 
length, 10 or 12 feet iu width, and :> or 4 feet high, now overgrown with orange 
trees, live o.aks," etc.

and around this the principal men of the village build their cabins. The 
common people are housed in the same manner, and thus they surround 
the dwelling- of their chief." To ascend this elevation they have a 
graded way from top to bottom, in which the slope is so gradual that a 
horseman can ride up without any diihculty. Excepting at this one 
place, all the other sides are made so steep as to be difficult of ascent. 
Elsewhere, in the town of Guachoule, on the head waters of the Coosa 
River,* and near the country of the '' Achalaque," the dwelling of the 
chief is said to stand on a " mound, with a terrace around it wide 
enough for six men to walk abreast." t West of the Mississippi, among 
the Capahas and their neighbors, it was the custom of the Caciques 
to raise "near their dwellings very high hills, on which they some- 
times build their huts;"| and the Gentleman of Elvas tells us that in 
the town of Ucita, near which De Soto lauded, and which is supposed 
to have been situated on the west coast of Florida, "the lord's house 
stood upon a very high mount, made by hand for strength." § A few 
years later, in Laudonniere's account of the ill-fated attempt of the 
Huguenots to plant a colony on the northeastern coast of this same 
Floridian peninsula, we have repeated allusions to " alleys," || which 
are none other than the " grand avenues " or Indian highways, men- 
tioned by Bartram ;is leading in a straight line from " a pompous Indian 
mount, or conical pyi^amid of earth, that stood on the site of an ancient 
town, through a magnificent grove of magnolias, live oaks, palms, and 
orange trees, to the verge of a large green level savanna."^ 

Passing over an interval of one hundred and fifty years, we find that, 
among many of these same tribes, the custom still existed of erecting 
mounds as sites for their habitations. The cabins of the Yazons, 
Courois, Ossagoulas, and Ouspie tribes, living on the lower Mississippi, 
are said to have been " dispersed over the country ujion mounds of 
earth made with their own hands, from which it is inferred that these 
nations are very ancient, and were formerly very numerous, although 
at the present time they hardly number 250 x)ersons."** According to 
Du Pratz, the temple of the Natchez was about 30 feet square, and 
was situated by the side of a small river, on an artificial mound, which 
was about 8 feet high, and sloi^ed insensibly from the main front on 
the north, but was somewhat steeper on the other sides." The same 
author also tells us that the cabin of their chief, or Great Sun, as he 
was called, was iilaced upon a mound of about the same height, though 
it was somewhat larger, " being 60 feet over on the surface." tt When

a chief died, these people demolished the cabin in which he had lived, 
and raised a new mound, upon which they placed the dwelling of his 
successor, as it was not customary for a chief to lodge in a house that 
had been previously occupied.* 

Whether the Natchez erected the immense works found on the Wash- 
ita River, near the outlet of Lake Catahoula, is a point about which 
ojnnions may well differ. That they took refuge in the immediate 
neighborhood of these works, if not on their very site, after the de- 
struction of their village on the Mississippi, and " built a fort," accord- 
ing to Du Pratz, or "fortified themselves," as Charlevoix states, is be- 
yond question; but Judge Force,! who has examined into the matter 
very thoroughly, is of the opinion that they were not permitted to hold 
this position long enough to have constructed works of the size of those 
found here. In this he is believed to be correct, though of course it 
would all depend upon the number of those who had sought refuge on 
this si)ot, and the earnestness with which they worked. As some in- 
dication of the time necessary to the erection of works of this charac- 
ter, the following fact, for which I am indebted to Lieut. Commander 
A. R. McNair, U. S. Navy, will be of interest. According to that gen- 
tleman, upon one occasion in 1863, when coaling at the island of St. 
Thomas, 150 negro laborers easily brought on board of the Powhatan, 
in twelve hours, 100 tons of coal, using only baskets for that purpose. 
Allowing 10 cubic feet to the ton, this would give a cube of coal, measur- 
ing 1*0 X 20 X 10 feet, moved in one day by 150 men; and Avith this as 
the basis for a calculation, it will be seen that the length of time abso- 
lutely necessary to the construction of these works is not so great as 
might be suppose<l.J However, this is a point upon whieh it is ueed-

Stoddard, Sketches of Louisiana, \). 3r>(), sjx'aking of the size of these works, saya: 
"Not less than five remarkable mounts are situated near the junction of the Washita, 
Acatahoiila, and Tenza, in an alluvial soil. They are all inclosed in an enbankraent 
or wall of earth, at this time 10 feet high, which contains about 200 acres of laud. 
Four of these mounts are nearly of eipial dimensions, about 20 feet high, 100 broad, 
and 300 long. The fifth seems to hav(i been designed for a tower or turret; the base 
of it overs an acre of ground; it rises by two stages or steps; its circumference 
gradiially diminishes as it ascends; its summit is crowned by a llattened cone. By 
admeasurement, the height of this tower is found to be 80 feet. 

t Strongly confirmat(try of this view is the following extract from Isaac McCoy's 
History of the Baptist Indian Missions, ate, i^. 27: ''A little rellection will show 
that the amount of labour required in their erection did not surpass the conmion in- 
dustry of the savages. [Suppose a mound to be 40 feet in diameter at its base, and 
to rise liy steps, 1 foot in height and a foot and a half in depth, to the height of 13 feet, 
with a level surface on the summit 4 feet in diameter. It would contain about 6,233 
cubic feet of earth, or a fraction loss than 231 cubic yards. To tleposite on the mound 
1 cubic yard of earth wotild be a moderate day's labour for 1 man. Therefore, the 
erection of the mound under consideration would employ 231 perscms one day only.

less to insist, as tlie evidence is quite sufficient to show that the Natchez 
(lid build both mounds and earth -^YOl'ks. Du Pratz states the fact posi- 
tively,* and although it can not be proved that they threw up the em- 
bank meiit and other works on the Wachita, yet there is unquestion- 
able authority for the statement that a short time after the destruction 
of their stronghold here by the French under Perier, a band of them, 
which had nuxnaged to escape the general ruin, made an attack upon 
the post of Natchitoches, during the course of which they were driven 
back, and obliged to ''dig a kind of entrenchment on the plain." t 

Among the Creeks and their allies, even as late as 1773-75, we are 
told that almost every town had a ''chunk yard," surrounded by one or 
two low embankments or terraces, in the center of which, on a low cir- 
cular mound or eminence, stood a four-square pole or pillar, 30 or 40 
feet high, to the top of which was fastened some object that served as 
a mark to shoot at, with arrows or the rifle, at certain appointed times. 
At one end of this yard, which was usually from GOO to 000 feet in 
length and of proportionate breadth, was a square terrace or eminence 
9 or 10 feet high, "upon which stood the public square," and at the 
other extremity was a circular mound of about the same height, which 
served as a site for their rotunda or winter council house.t The Chero- 
kees too, as we have seen, utilized this class of mounds in much the same 
manner, the council house in their town of Cowe, according to the same 
author, occupying the summit of one that was said to have been 20 feet 
high. If now we compare the method of laying out these towns, and 
building the temples and council houses of these later Indians with that 
described by La Vega, as having been followed by their ancestors a cen- 
tury and a half earlier, it will be seen that the resemblance is very great; 
and although we are sometimes assured that the modern Creeks and 
Cherokees could give no account of the origin or purpose of tlu'se earthen 
structures, yet there can be no doubt that in Bartram's time these 

are frequently at oue village or one encanijiuient. - - . Witliin the Indian 
Territory we have 94,000 inhabitants; oue-fifth of these, or more, are competent to 
labour. This gives 18,800 labourers; if each of these would, in the course of twelve 
mouths, bestow only as much labour on the erection of mounds as would amount 
to one day, 81 mounds Avould be built in one year." Washington and New York, 1840.

Indians were accustomed to defend their more exposed villages, it 
may be well to go into the matter somewhat in detail. To this end it 
will be necessary again to resort to the early chroniclers; and although 
this may i)rove tedious, yet it is unavoidable, as it is only by a study of 
the numner of fortitication practiced by the recent Indians that a clue 
can be found to the mystery that surrounds the Ohio system of earth- 
works, to which we now must refer. Of the origin of these we are 
without any written record whatever unless the traditions of the Dela- 
wares, Iroquois, and Natchez, as related by Heckewelder, liatinesque, 
Cusick, and l)u rratz,t should be accepted as such. This is of course 
rather a serious obstacle to be met with at the outset of an investiga- 
tion; but fortunately, in the present instance Ave have not far to go 
in order to discover a reason for the seeming omission. It may be 
found in the fact that after the destruction of the Erics, say about the 
middle of the sevent'?ent h century, the whole of that region now known 
as the States of Ohio and Indiana was virtually deserted, and so re- 
mained for upwards of lifty years. Iroquois war parties swept undis- 
turbed from the Niagara River to the Illinois, and whilst there may 
have been villages of the Twightwees (Miamis) and their allies scat- 
tered about here and there, yet practically that whole section of 
country was a solitude, unvisited by the trader, the soldier, and the 
no less venturesome missionary, the only persons who could, in those 
early days, have given us an ac<'ount of what they saw and heard.

wero now a broken and a scattered people, and the Miamis had been 
forced back until we find them seeking- shelter under the guns of the 
French fort on the Illinois.* Such then being the condition of affairs 
throughout this portion of the Ohio Valley during the latter part of the 
seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries, there was 
nothing to lenipt the trader, or attract the missionary; and hence the 
absence of all mention of this region, save in the occasional notices of 
an Iroquois foray, or of the spasmodic attempts of their enemies at 
retaliation. Later on, about the middle of the last century, the above- 
mentioned tribes are found once more established within this region, 
having apparently retraced their steps. The Miamis are in western 
Ohio and northern Indiana, and the Shawnees of the Delaware, having 
been driven across the mountains, re-unite with their kindred from 
Georgia, and are settled in the valley of the Scioto, where singularly 
enough their villages are in the immediate neighborhood, if they do 
not occupy the very sites, of the famous mound centers of Chillicothe 
and Portsmouth.! Indeed, we are told that about A. d. 1750, at this 
latter point, their village was situated on both sides of the Ohio River,| 
just as is the case with the numnds and embankments found there 
to-day. 

Of course it is not pretended that all the works in these valleys were 
erected subsequent to this date, and it is quite probable that not one of 
those of large size was, but that some of them were built after the arrival 
of the whites, a hundred and fifty or two hundred years earlier, is 
proved by the contents of mounds opened at Circleville and Marietta; 
and that these same Indians, or their immediate descendants, have 
within comparatively recent times "encompassed their villages with 
ditches and walls," as well as palisades, is evident from the account

canoe, aud to the sites of other ludiau villages in ludiana and Illinois.* 
These facts are undoubtedly of importance in indicating the i)liase of 
civilization that had been reached by the builders of some — perhaps 
the smaller and more recent — of these works ; but they do not enable 
us to connect even infeientially those of the larger size with any par- 
ticular tribe, owing to the fact that there was such a long interval of 
time, when Ohio, so far as we know, was virtually uninhabited. If it 
were possible to show that previous to the settlement of the Iroquois in 
western New York a Shawnee confederacy had occupied the Ohio 
Valley, as Kafinesque t so confidently asserts, our task would be much 
simplified. It would then be apparent that in returning here these 
people were but reoccupying their old homes and hunting grounds; and 
as they can be shown to have defended themselves within compara- 
tively recent times behind ditches and breast- works, | and as they must 
Itom the necessities of the case have erected all the mounds that were 
built within that region subsequent to the landing of the whites, there 
would certainly be nothing forced or illogical in the inference that they 
had constructed the older and larger series of works during the palmy 
days of their confederacy, some hundreds of years before the time of 
which we are now speaking. Unfortunately however Eafiuesque fails to 
make good his statement; and though the evidence, drawn from other 
sources, bearing upon this point is sufficient to furnish the basis for a 
very plausible theory, yet it does not afibrd a satisfactory foundation 
for an inductive argument, and hence it is altogether omitted. 

For these reasons, then, we are without any historical evidence as to 
the origin of the works in the northern part of the Ohio Valley, and 
as there is no probability that any will ever be discovered, we are 
obliged to fall back upon the comparative method in order to see 
whether there are any such ditterences between the hill forts and fin-ti- 
fied villages of southern Ohio and those found in western New York 
and in some of the Southern Stat(%s as wcmld authorize the inference 
til at they were the work of a peoi)le in a different stage of civilization. 

Beginning witli the "forts," as Governor DeW^itt Clinton § calls them, 
of western New York, we are told that they were generally speaking 
erected upon the most commanding gi'ound, and were surrounded,

account, is "supposed" to have been erected by the Indians ; but in anotner the 
fact is stated positively.

either wholly or in part, by ditches and earthen walls. The palisades 
that once stood on some of these embankments* had long since rotted 
away, and in their places were growing oak trees which, from the 
number of concentric circles, must have been three hundred years old ; 
and there were evident indications, not only that they had sprung n\^ 
since the erection of these works, but that they were at least a second 
growth. The trenches were, in some cases, deep and wide, and in 
others shallow and narrow; and the breastworks varied in height from 
3 to 10 feet. In one case near Elmira they are said to have been 14 
feet wide at the base, t There were one or more entrances to these 
forts, from one of which a "covered way" sometimes led to the water.| 
The form of these inclosures was determined by the nature of the 
ground; and in area they varied from 2 to acres, though occasionally 
they were ranch larger, as, for instance, the one near Livonia, N. Y., 
which contained 16 acres,§ and theoue 14 miles from Sacketts Harbor, 
which, according to Moulton, "covers 50 acres."|| That they were 
very numerous is evident from Squier's estimate, pla(?ing them at from 
200 to 250;^ and as they seem to have made up in number what they 
lacked in size, it is equally evident that taken in mass the amount of 
labor involved in their construction must have been immense. It would 
be a grave mistake however to regard tliis as a measure of the popu- 
lousness of this region, since it probably resulted from the custom of 
the Indians of changing their village sites every "ten, fifteen, or thirty 
years,-' or in fact whenever the scarcity of fire-wood, the exhaustion of 
their fields, or the prevalence of ;in epidemic made such a step desir- 
able.** 

This is a brief general description of these inclosures as they appear 
to-day; andif we compare them with the "defensive works" as depicted 
in Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, i^, will be seen that 
they are very like those along the southern shore of Lake Erie, as well 
as the smallest of those in the Ohio Yalley; and that they do not 
differ, except in size, from those found in the same valley, which are 
usually ascribed to the mound-builders. In situation, form, and struc- 
ture they are the same, and as both were covered with heavy forests, 
there can be no difference urged between them upon the score of antiq-

iiity. The relics, too — especially the implements and ornaments of stone, 
bono, and shell — that are found under similar circumstances within or 
near these two series of works are identical in form and finish;' and the 
best specimens of the Iroquois black pottery, described by Morgan* as 
being of various <lesigns and sizes, and of such ^' fine texture as to ad- 
mit a tolerable polish, and so firm as to have the appearance of stone," 
can not have been very difierent from the same class of articles that 
have been taken from the mounds in the Ohio Valley. Indeed Mr. 
S(iuiert says that the terra cottas of western New York compare favor- 
ably with anytliing he had yet seen of native workmanship; and that 
the earthen pipes, said by Morgan to be nearly aS hard as marble, fan- 
cifully molded in tlie form of animals and of the human head, are so 
"hard, smooth, and symmetrical as almost to induce doubts of their 
aboriginal origin." 

lu view of these manifold resemblances, too numerous and too close 
to have been the result of accident, it behooves us to inquire into the 
origin of the earthworks in western New York. According to Mr. 
Squierl they were, one and all — mounds as well as embankments — 
"erected by the Iroquois or their western neighbors;" and he bases 
this opinion upon a comparison of the "relics and traces of occupancy" 
that are found Avithin these abandoned inclosures with those which 
mark the sites of towns and forts that are known to have been occu- 
pied by the recent Indians. These he declares to be identical, as is 
also their i>ottery, whilst their pipes and ornaments are said to be in- 
distinguishable. " The indications of aboriginal dwellings are precisely 
similar, and, so far as can be discovered, have equal claim to antiquity. 
Near many of these works are found cemeteries, in which well-preserved 
skeletons are contained, and which, except in the absence of European

Tlius we are told that "the Eoanoke Indians have earthen pots, large, white, and 
sweet:" Hakluyt's Voyaf/es, iii, p. 304. The Creeks, Chickasaws, etc., "make 
earthen pots of very different sizes, so as to contain from 2 to 10 gallons; large 
l)itcliers to carry water; bowls, dishes, platters, basins, and a prodigious number 
of other vessels of such antiquated forms as would be tedious to describe and impos- 
sible to name. Their method of glazing them is, they place them over a large fire 
of smoky pitch pine, which makes them smooth, black, .and firm:" Adair, p. 425.

Morgan, on the authority of Mr. F. A. Gushing, tells us that "the Iroquois orna- 
mented their Jars and jiipes with minature human faces attached as buttons;" and 
as this style of ornamentation is believed to be somewhat unusual, it may be well 
to say that, in the Peabody Museum at Cambridge, there are several bowls of black 
pottery, from stone graves in Tennessee, which are ornamented in this manner,

art, differ iu uo essential respect from tlie cemeteries found in connec- 
tion with the deserted modern towns and ' castles ' of the Indians." 
This is certainly a very strong statement of the case, and if we add 
that the Huron-Iroquois were accustomed to fortify their forts or castles 
with a ditch and wall, the latter surmounted by a stockade, it will be 
seen that Mr. Squier had good and sufficient reasons for attributing all 
these works to the recent Indians. Indeed, now that the palisades 
that once inclosed the villages known to have been occupied by the 
Iro(][uois have rotted away, there is no structural difference to be seen 
between them and any of the earthworks of western New York; and 
as these, in their turn, are identical in tliis respect with the hill forts 
of the Ohio Valley, it must follow, if the Iroquois or their western 
neighbors erected the New York series of these works, that there is 
no reason why these same western neighbors, or a people iu the same 
stage of civilization, could not have built those in Ohio and still fur- 
ther to the west, due regard being had to their po[)ulation and to the 
necessity for such defenses. Thus for instance whilst a weak or 
peaceful tribe, iu the midst of enemies, would find it necessary to 
fortify themselves at every point, a strong and warlike people, of whom 
their neighbors stood in awe, would be relieved of this necessity, ex- 
cept in the direction from which they anticipated danger. This was 
forcibly exemplified iu the case of the Irocpiois,* when in the heyday of 
their power; and it may still be seen in New Mexico, where the Pueblo 
of Taos is, or was until very lately, "surrounded by an adobe wall, 
strengthened in some places by rough j)alisades,"t whilst their more 
warlike neighbors, like the Apache and the Navajo, have not found 
such defenses necessary or even desirable. 

Of the method practiced by the Huron-Iroquois of fortifying their 
villages, our accounts are very full and ex])licit. Parkmau,| whom it is 
safe to follow, in an admirable sketch of the Hurons, tells us that the 
defenses of this family of tribes, " like their dwellings, were, in essential 
points, alike. A situation was chosen favorable to defense — the bank 
of a lake, the crown of a difficult hill, or a high point of land in the fork 
of confluent streams. A ditch several feet deep Avas dug around the vil- 
lage, and the earth thrown up on the inside. Trees were then felled by an 
alternate process of burning, and hacking the burnt part with stone 
hatchets, and by similar means were cut into lengths to form palisades. 
These were planted on the embankment in one, two, three, or four con- 
centric rows," the whole being crossed and interlaced alter the manner of 
a chevaux-defrise, and lined within to the height of a man with heavy 
sheets of bark. At the top, where the palisades crossed, was a gallery

of timber for tlie defenders, tos'etlier with wooden gutters, by which 
streams of water (!ould be ]ionred down on fires kindled by the enemy. 
There was no niath«Mnati('al regubirity in these works, tlieir form being 
determined by the nature of the ground. Frequently a precipice or 
river sufticed for partial defense, and the line of embankment occurs 
only on the e>cpose<l sides. We are also told that in erecting these 
works it was probable that the palisades were plantiMl first, and the 
earth afterwards heaped on both sides in the manner described by 
Cusick* mid La Tlontan.t At an early day the Jesuits taught the 
Huroiis to build rectangular palisaded forts with bastions, and the 
Iroquois, wliose forts are said to have been stronger ajid more elaborate 
than those of tlie TTurons, soon adopted the same practice, omitting, in 
some cases, the ditch and the endjankment. Among the Algonquin 
tribes of southeastern New York a similar method of fortification seems 
to have prevailed. According to Van der Donck,| the Indians of New 
Netherlands, " in their villages and castles always build firm, strong 
works. They usually select a situation on theside of a steep, high hill, 
near a stream or river, which is difficult of access except from the Avater, 
and inaccessible on every other side, with a level plain on the crown 
of the hill, which they inclose with a strong stockade in a singular 
manner. First they lay along on the ground large logs of wood, and 
frequently snnillerlogs upon the lower logs, which serve for the founda- 
tion of th<> work. Then they place strong oak palisades in the groimd 
on both sides of the foundation, the upper ends of which cross each 
other, and are joined together. In the upper cros-s of the j)alisade 
they tlien place the bodies of trees, which makes the work strong and 
firm. These castles arc considered very strong, and they frequently 
contain twenty or thirty houses, some of which, by actual measurement, 
are ISO yards (sic) long, and about 20 feet wide. Besides these strong- 
holds they have other villages and towns, which are also inclosed." 
The Pequots of Connecticut were a kindred tribe, and Vincent,§ de- 
scribing their fort near New London, says: "Here they pitch, close 
together as they can, young trees and half trees as thick as a man's 
thigh or the calf of his leg. Ten or twelve foot high they are above the 
grouiul, and within rammed 3 foot deep with banking, the earth 
being cast up for their better shelter against the enemy's discharge- 
ments." A fort of the Narragansetts is said to have had an exterior 
ditch, II and we are told that a party of Mohegans, having invaded Block

Island, were driven to a liigli bluff and starved to death, though not 
until they had found means to " dig a trench around them, toward the 
land, to defend them from the arrows of their enemies." * In 1G37 the 
Algonquins, living at Trois Rivieres, Canada, being alarmed at the 
rumor of an Iroquois attack, strengthened their fort by erecting a sec- 
and row of palisades, distant from the first about a foot and a half, and 
tilling the intervening space with fascines and earth, f According to 
Charlevoix, the Outagamis (Foxes), in 1712, made an attack upon the 
French post at Detroit, and having been repulsed, took refuge in a fort 
where they were well entrenched {retranches). The fire upon them, how- 
ever, was so steady that they were obliged to get into a ditch 4 or 5 
feet deep {se mettre a quatre oft cinqpieds en terre). Taking advantage 
of a lull in the firing, they made themselves masters of a house that 
was left standing near their fort and raised a redoubt (redoufe). | Being 
eventually driven from this stronghold, they retired to a x)eninsula that 
jutted into the lake, where, to the number of five hundred men and 
three thousand women and children, they shut themselves up in a fort, 
surrounded by " three rows of oak palisades with a deep ditch behind." § 
Elsewhere, as we have seen, tribes in Illinois and Indiana belonging to 
this same family have defended themselves in a similar manner within 
comparatively recent times; and in the narrative of Conrad Wiser, the 
interpreter, we are told of a place in Pennsylvania where "the Indians, 
in former times, had a strong fortification on a height. It was sur- 
rounded by a deep ditch ; the earth was thrown up in the shape of a 
wall, about 9 or 10 feet high, and as many broad. But it is now (1741) 
in decay, as from appearance it had been deserted beyond the memory 
of man." || 

In Virginia the Indians, according to Capt. Smith, had " pallizadoed 
towns, mantelled with the barkes of trees, with scafiblds like mounts." H 
There is no mention of a ditch or of an embankment, and as a rule 
there seems to have been but one row of palisades, though when they 
would be very safe " they treble the pales." Sometimes they " encom- 
passed their whole town, but for the most part only their kings' houses, 
and as many others as they judge sufficient to harbor all their people, 
when the enemy comes against them." ** This mode of defense was kept 
up in Carolina until the final exi:)ulsion of the Indians, as we are told that 
the Tuscaroras (1712-'13) built their forts in this manner, and upon one 
occasion, when besieged by the whites, they refused to surrender until

cannon were planted within a few yards of their walls.* In the States 
still farther to the south, the same method of fortification was prac- 
ticed. Le Moyne, the artist of Laudonniere's expedition, gives a picture 
of one of these villages, t which is surrounded by a single row of pali- 
sades, twice the heiglit of a man, set close together. The entrance is 
narrow, drawn in after the manner of a snail shell, and is further de- 
fended by two small round buildings, with slits and holes for observa- 
tion, something like an old-fashioned sentry box. 

In the Chilf States, including nnder this head portions of Tennessee 
and Arkansas, the Indians have been in the habit of fortifying their 
vilages witli ditches and stockades from the time of De Soto down to the 
beginning of the present century. As late as 1814 the position of the 
Creeks, at the battle of the Horseshoe, is said to have been protected 
b}^ a line of earth-works from G to 8 feet high,| and about 1735, almost 
a century earlier, the Ohickasaws met the attack of Bienville in a 
stockaded fort, and standing waist deep in a ditch. § Going back still 
further, we are told by the Portuguese gentleman || that the wall around 
a town belonging to the Cacique of Coga, as well as that "of others 
which afterwards we saw, was of great posts thrust dee[) into the 
ground, and very rough; and many long rails, as big as one's arm, laid 
across between them, and the wall was about tlie height of a lance, and 
it was daubed within and without with clay, and had loopholes." The 
town of IMauvila Mas situated in a i)lain, and consisted of eighty houses, 
the snuillestofwliich, according to La Vega, might contain six hundred 
persons. It was surrounded by a high rami^art, i)alisaded with heavy 
beams of wood jdanted in the ground, and with timbers placed cross- 
wise. The vacant places were filled in with earth mixed with straw,

or 12 cubits deep, and 50 paces wide in most places, and in others only 
■40. This ditch was kept full of water by means of a canal that had 
been dug from the town to the river Chucagua. Tlie canal was 3 
leagues long, a pike's length at least in depth, and so broad that two 
large boats could navigate it side by side. Tlie fosse, filled by this 
canal, surrounds the city except in one place, which is closed by heavy 
posts planted in the ground, and fastened by means of others placed 
crosswise, the whole being covered with earth and straw. Within this 
town was the temple, in which were deposited the bones of the ances- 
tors of the Capaha chief. This the Indian allies of De Soto pillaged, 
breaking open the coffins and scattering the bones. They also removed 
the heads of their countrymen, who had been killed in previous wars, 
and substituted those of the Capahas who had fallen in the recent bat- 
tle.* This is the account left by Le Vega of this village, and though 
it is evidently exaggerated, as are all of his descriptions, yet there can 
be no doubt that it is substantially true, as it is confirmed in all im- 
portant particulars by the other chroniclers of that expedition. Thus, 
for instance, Biedmat tells us that " they reached a village in the midst 
of a plain, surrounded by walls and a ditch which had been made by 
the Indians, filled with water; " and, according to the Knight of Elvas,| 
this town, which he calls Pacaha, ''was very great, walled, and beset 
with towers, and many loop holes were in the towers and wall. - - - 
Where the governor was lodged was a great lake that came near unto 
the wall; and it entered into a ditch that went round about the town, 
wanting but a little to environ it around. From the lake to the great 
river was made a wear by which the fish came into it. - - - With 
nets that were found in the town they took as much as they would ; 
and took they never so much, there was no want perceived. Within a 
league and a half there were other great towns all walled." 

Proceeding still farther to the northwest, we are told that, within the 
present century, the Mandans, Arikaras, and other tribes living high 
up on the Missouri, when they were first visited by the whites, were 
accustomed to fortify their towns by ditches, embankments, and pali- 
sades. Lewis and Clarke made repeated mention of recently abandoned 
Indian villages, surrounded by earthen walls, which in one case at 
least, are said to have been 8 or 10 feet high ;§ and Brackenridge,|| who 
visited these same tribes in 1811, tells us of a citadel or fortification 
oval in form, and 4 or 5 acres in extent, around which a village had

apparently been built. The eaitheu wall that inclosed this fort was 
about 4 feet high, and upon it cedar posts were still standing. Struck 
with the reseniblauce, " in every respect," between these ruins and the 
"vestiges," as he calls the earth-works on the Ohio and the Mississippi, 
he very justly concluded that tliese latter were but the sites of stockaded 
towns and villages j* and this inference is borne out by the fact that on 
some of them " the remains of pallisadoes were found by the first set- 
tlers." t 

That this resemblance is not altogether fanciful will be admitted by 
those who have followed the course of this investigation, though it is 
possible that the comparison would be more just if it were limited to 
the hill-forts of the Ohio Valley. Defensive works of the character of 
these latter seem to have been the same everywhere, and whether built 
by Iroquois, Chickasaw, Mandan, or Mound-builder, admit of no dis- 
tinction in situation, form, or structure. Not so however with the 
class of works to which the term fortified village has been applied. 
Those are gr<)U])S rather than single works, and though primarily noth- 
ing but mounds, ditches, and embankments, and as such differing in 
nowise, except i)erhaps in size, from similar structures elsewhere, yet 
they are often arranged in sucli a complicated manner as to have but 
little in common with the inclosures, north of the Ohio, that are known 
to have been erected by the modern Indians. For their counterparts 
we must look to the Gulf States, Georgia and Arkansas, and it is pos- 
sible that, even here, they will be found to be neither so large nor so 
comjdicated. Upon this point however it is necessary to "make haste 
slowly," as our knowledge of the earth-works in the Southern States is 
very slight ; and there can be no doubt that the statement of the Portu- 
guese Gentleman! as to the existence of " great and walled towns, and 
many houses scattered all about the fields, to wit : a cross-bow shot or 
two, the one from the other," taken in connection with what is known 
of the manner in which these tribes l)uilt their houses and fortified 
their villages, is suggestive of a condition of affairs strongly resembling 
the famous mound centers of the Ohio Valley.§ In all other respects,

§ A series of ex])lorations, under the auspices of the I'eabody Museum of American 
Archa-ology and Ethnology, has recently been conducted amid the mounds and vil- 
lage sites of the northeastern portion of Arkansas — the regiou that the Capahas are 
sujiposed to have inhabited in the time of De Soto, and Avhere they were found by 
Fathers Douay and Charlevoix in 1687 and 1721 — and it is curious to note how the 
statement of the old chronicler as to the existence of "walled towns within a league 
or a league and a half of each other" is verified. See Fourteenth Annual Report of 
the I'eahody Aluseuin, p. 19, where we are told that " these mounds are usually sur-

the works of the Southern Indians, such as they have been described 
by the early chroniclers, will compare favorably with anything of the 
same character that has yet been found in the United States. The 
truncated or temple mounds are far more numerous in the States south 
of the Ohio than anywhere else in the Mississippi Valley, and except 
in one or two notable instances, are of larger size; whilst the artificial 
ponds, with canals to feed them, are believed to be peculiar to that 
region. 

Of the other earth-works — the stone cairns, burial mounds, graded 
ways, ditches, and embankments — it can only be said that they are com- 
mon to both sections, and that the only difference between them is in 
their size, or in the order in which they are sometimes grouped together. 
Even in these particulars the advantage is not always on one side, for 
the reason that there is no uniformity in any of the works, and whilst, 
as a matter of fact, the largest and most comj)licated groui) of the Ohio 
system exceeds anything that has yet been found in the Gulf States, it 
is equally true that there are mounds and embankments south of the 
Ohio that are larger than are many of those found to the north of that 
stream. Between the giant mass of the Oahokia, 111., mound and the 
long lines of embankment on Paint Creek, Ohio, and their counterj)arts 
in Mississippi* and elsewhere in the Southern States,t the difference is 
much less than it is between these same works and the average of those 
of similar character in the northern half of the Ohio Valley. But even 
if there were no such differences, and the groups in the Ohio system of 
works were uniformly of larger size and more complicated pattern than 
can l)e found elsewhere in the United States, the fact would still be 
without any ethnical significance; otherwise we should have to admit 
that there existed in tlie Ohio Valley at or about the same time, and in 
close proximity to each other, as many different races or phases of civi- 
lization as there are groups of works, and this would be absurd. 

With the establishment of this point, my task is brought to a close. 
In it I have confined myself almost entirely to the historical proof of 
the recent origin of these works, and except incidentally, have ignored 
the argument that may be drawn from the similarity of burial customs, 
and from the identity of the implements and ornaments found in the 

rounded by eartliworks and ditches, forming inclosiires of from 3 or 4 to 18 or 20 
acres;" and the MS. field notes of the late Mr. Edwin Curtiss, iioav in the Peabody 
Museum, for the relative situation of some of these inclosures. 

*The great mound at Seltzertown, Miss., according to Brackenridge, Appendix to 
Fiervs of Louisiana, was a truncated pyramid 600 by 400 feet, aud 40 feet in perpen- 
dicular height. It was ascended by graded ways, and the area on top embraced 
about 4 acres. At each end of this ai'ea, and near the center, were other mounds, 
one of which was about 40 feet high, with a level space at its summit 30 feet in di- 
ameter. The whole was surrounded by a ditch that averaged 10 feet deep.

also Squier, Ahorig. Man. of the Miss. Valley, pp. 113 et seq., and Jones, Antiquities of

moiiiuls witli those that are known to have been made and used by the 
recent Indians. This has not proceeded from any failure to appreci- 
ate the full ethnical significance of these resemblances, nor has it been 
caused by any lack of material; but it has been the result of the limits 
voluntarily placed upon the investigation. At some future time it may 
be necessary to revert to this subject, and then it will be competent to 
show that the "vestiges of art" found in the mounds "do not excel in 
any respect those of the Indian tril)es known to history."* In the 
meantime we can well afford to content ourselves with this brief and 
cursory examination into the early records. Summing up the results 
that have been attained, it may be safely said, that so far from there be- 
ing any a priori reason why the red Indians could not have erected these 
works, the evidence shows conclusively that in l^ew York and the Gulf 
States they did build mounds and embankments that are essentially 
of the same character as tliose found in Ohio. And not only is this 
true, but it has also been shown that whilst for reasons that have been 
given, we are without any historical account of the origin of the Ohio 
system of works — the only one about which there seems to be any dis- 
pute — yet there can be no doubt that oneof the more elaborate of them, 
viz: the mound at (Jircleville, in Avhicli were found articles of iron and 
silver, was built after contact with the whites, and therefore by the re- 
cent Indians. 

In view of these results, and of the additional fact that these same 
Indians are the only people, except the whites, who, so far as we know, 
have ever held the region over which these works are scattered, it is 
believed that we are fully justified in abandoning the seemingly nega- 
tive position occupied at the outset of this argument, and in claiming 
that the mounds and inclosures of Ohio, like those in New York and 
the Gulf States, were the work of the red Indians of historic times, or 
of their immediate ancestors. To deny tliis conclusion, and to accept 
its alternative, ascribing these remains to a mythical peoi)le of a differ- 
ent civilization, is to reject a simple and satisfactory exi^lanation of a 
fact in favor of one tliat is far-fetched and incomplete; and this is 
neither science nor logic.

THE IKSE OF FLINT BLADES TO WORK PINE WOOD.* 

(KPOCH OF THK ANCIENT SHELL HEAPS.) 



By G. V. Smith. 



In the discussions wliicli Lave been going" on for more than thirty 
years concerning the division of the Stone age in Denmark into two 
periods, that of the shell heaps, and that of the megalithic monuments, 
one of the princi])al objections made to the tlieory of Worsaae has 
ahvaj's been that the blades simply chii)ped could not be employed 
as axes, and ought, upon the whole, to be taken out of the list of cut- 
ting instruments. t 

These implements have however when they are in good condition, 
a sharp border, analogous to an edge, which has always been produced 
by the same process, that is to say, by striking off a single chip from 
each side of a flint disc so as to form an edge by the line of iutersec- 
tion of the two ftices, whose angle of inclination is not ordinarily 
larger than the corresponding" angle of the cutting pait of the polished 
axes. But objection has been made that this sharp border is not suit- 
able for an edge, consequently the implement could not be employed 
as an ax. 

If we examine with care the great series of chipped blades which 
are found in such abundance in the National Museum of Copenhagen, 
as well as in other Danish collections, we lind out however that in all 
the examples in good condition, the cutting part is precisely like an 
edge, whether we regard the form or the idea of a cutting" tool, also 
from this point of view it does not seem rational that this kind of edge 
would have been merely accessory in the chipped blades and that 
they did not have any importance in the eyes of those who made 
use of these implements. It is then diliicult to understand why 
there is any hesitation in considering them to have been cutting im- 
l>lcments, especially when it is possible to show the successive devel- 
opment of the forms, from the largest blades to the most complete

602 THE USE OF FLINT BLADES TO WORK PINE WOOD. 

types of edged iustruments made in the usual manner for blades and 
approaching more and more the pnblislied flint axes. 

Blades with a ijerfect edge are rare, naturally ; for it was not worth 
the trouble to recut them, and those were thrown away which could 
not be used. The edge produced by simply strikiug off two fragments 
of flint, without doubt, had not the resistance of an edge made by pol- 
ishing ; but as the ancients did not experience any difficulty in making 
new blades, the fra'ilty of the edge would not be of auy great import- 
ance, as they had flint in abuudance. It is this which naturally ex- 
plains the great quantity of blades more or less damaged, which are 
found, not only on the Danish borders and in the shell heaps, but any- 
where in the interior of the country. 

The ([uestiou of the use of these blades as cutting instruments has 
already been fully treated, especially by Dr. Sophus Miiller.* I will 
not go into details. The theoretical part of the subject has also been 
exhausted. It only remains to prove by practical experiments how far 
the blades, when furnished with handles, can cut wood. 

The success of these ex])eriments ought to be a strong argument in 
favor of those who hold that flint blades of the ancient shell-heap epoch 
have been used in the same manner as polished tools from the last 
period of the Stone age, that is to say, as cutting or chopping instru- 
ments, and as weapons. I have undertaken these experiments, and 
give here the results. The co-operation of an able assistant was indis- 
pensable to me. So I called in the aid of a master carpenter of Aarhus, 
M. Helstrup, who has shown great interest and aptitude in the sub- 
ject in assisting me in the practical part of the work. 

The blades used have been hafted partly in imitation of the stone 
axes which are to be found in the ISTational Museum of Copenhagen 
(Department of Ethnology), and partly after the cuts in works on 
Archjeology.t In trying the different kinds of mountings, it was de- 
cided that the most advantageous form is one copied from works on 
the construction of pile dwellings of the Swiss Lakes, I made a maple 
handle 7 centimeters (2f inches) in diameter, and about 58 centimeters 
(23 inches) in length, preserving this thickness about 12 centimeters 
(4f inches) from the end, and then tapering it slightly to the other end. 

As the blades placed at my disposal for the experiment were relatively 
small, I could not fasten them directly into the handle; the edge would 
have been so near the handle that it would have made the work difti- 
cult, especially in cutting down trees, where it would have been neces- 
sary to strike at an open angle; besides, in a handle of this kind it 
was difficult to give stability to the stone blade. The blades would be

mounted more advantageously in an intermediate piece, like those 
whicli were generally made for the axes of stone in handles found in 
the Swiss lake cities. First of all, by that means, it became possible 
to fix them immovably in the helve; and secondly, which was most 
essential, to place between the edge and the handle the distance appro- 
priate for the use of the implement. The intermediate pieces which I 
used were of elm or beecb 0.12 to 0.13 meter (4f to 5 inches) long, 0.4 to 0.5 
meter (16 to 20 inches) wide, and 0.3 t(>0.4meter thick. These were split 
at one end to insert the blade, and tlie interstices were tilled with a kind 
of pitch used by saddlers. After having wrapped with a piece of leather 
the two sides of the blade which protruded beyond the cleft, this was 
tightly bound with cord. The other end of the intermediate piece was 
rounded and slightly jjointed so as to be more easily introduced into 
the corresponding hole in the handle. This hole was bored obliquely 
in the nnddle of the thickest part of the handle, in such a way that the 
blade formed an obtuse angle with the upper extremity of the handle. 
This arrangement was found to be necessary, for otherwise it would 
not have been the middle of the edge whicli struck the tree but the 
outer corner; that is to say, the one farthest from the hand. This 
lioint would have soon been probably broken, which would not be the 
case when the edge was properly set in an oblique position. This solid 
haftiiig was like those used in Denmark in primitive times, and the 
dowel of wood in which is set a blade found in the fiords of Kolding 
and rei>resented on page 392 of the memoir of S. Miiller, served as 
an intermediate piece. 

With these blades thus halted I have executed the works here de- 
scribed on green pine, not that the kind of wood plays an important 
part in these ex|)eriments, for it is to be supposed that blades cutting 
one kind will do as much on all otlier kinds of the same hardness; but 
as most of the forests of Denmark during the stone age consisted nearly 
exclusively of pines, as Prof Steenstrup has demonstrated, I have made 
my investigations on the Finns silvestris of different sizes cut down in 
the woods of Frijsenborg in the beginning of January, and I have con- 
tinued them from the 27th to the 31st of the same month. 

I. xV stick of pine wood 0.0555 meter in diameter, which was fixed per- 
pendicularly on a work-bench, was cut in two in three-quarters of a 
minute; it did not break off until it had been reduced to 0.007 meter 
in diameter; the severed piece was sharpened like a ])ile. 

II. Another stick, 0.1225 meter in diameter, placed in the same posi- 
tion was cut in ten minutes. It was broken oft" by force when it was not 
more than 0.02 meter in diameter. 

HI. A stick placed in the same position was cut in eighteen minutes; 
it broke oft" when it was 0.05 meter. It was necessary to strike 1,578 
blows to do the work. At the 1,485th strike a little fragment separated 
itself from the edge. Even at the beginning the edge struck accidentally 



604 THE USE OF FLINT BLADES TO WORK PINE WOOD. 

on a jiiece of iron which made it bound, and caused a small fragment 
0.03 meter long- and 0.003 meter thick to fly off one of the corners 
without diminishing the sharpness of the axe. 

These three experiments were made with the same blade, 0.075 
meter long, of gray flint, of which the edge, a little concave, was 
0.065 meter in width. At one of the corners of this some chips were 
wanting, having been broken off before the experiment. It was other- 
wise in a good condition, and very sharp, only having serrations here 
and there. The shorter of the beveled faces is a little curved and 
this made the blade slightly convex. The scarfs produced by the cut- 
ting were perfectly regular and exact, and the surface, left by the 
removal of the chii)S would have been also quite smooth if the serra- 
tions of the edge had not left some inequalities. 

IV. In striking some blows on a pine pole, dry and not planed, 0.03 
meter thickness, I have proved that the same blade would quite as 
well cut harder wood. 

It would have been naturally much easier to fell a sapling standing 
than to cut the blocks flxed on a stand, for the wood yielded in a man- 
ner to compress the fibers in one way and expand them in the other; 
the blows penetrated better in the latter case. 

V. A log of pine 0.13 meter in diameter, fixed on a table, was cut in 
eight minutes with the ax. It is a blade of gray flint 0.07 meter long, 
of which the convex and uneven edge is 0.0075 meter wide. Before the 
experiment the edge was a little damaged in the middle and did not 
work as well. The chips were short and the incisions uneven. The 
part separated from the log which was pointed with the ax used in the 
first three experiments, shows the surfaces equal and nearly polished. 

VI. One of the logs had the knots which I had succeeded in avoid- 
ing in the preceding experiments. With a blade whose edge was 
extraordinarily straight and regular, but a little thick (the bevelled 
l)arts show an angle of inclination of 45°), I cut with the greatest 
ease these knots, of which the largest was 0.03 meter in diameter, 
without any marks thereof appearing on the edge. The thickness 
of this ax, on the contrary, makes it cut with less facility into 
wood soft and without knots. To ascertain the limits of resistance in 
this blade, I struck with all my force, almost iierpendicularly, a large 
knot remaining on a branch cut on the stump. The branch was stand- 
ing horizontally. The edge penetrated in the knot 0.01 meter, but the 
same time the ax split, and the thick fragment broke off about a third 
of the edge and all the narrow face of the ax, which came off from the 
head. 

VII. The experiment showed to me that tlie little blades could per- 
fectly take the place of chisels. 

VIII. With the same instruments used as chisels I shaped two logs 
to mortise and tenon. All the logs of the experiment were still covered 
with bark. 



THE USE OF FLINT BLADES TO WORK PINE WOOD. 605 

These experiments clearly showed me with what astonishing easi- 
ness and relative rapidity the pine could be felled with these blades. 
With the primitive implements one is able, not only to cut large trees, 
but to perform the work of less complicated carpentry, without the 
cutting edge bec^oining very readily deteriorated. If one considers, in 
addition, that (,he carpenters of antiquity were particularly skillful and 
clever in the use of blades, one can with reason now consider that these 
were used as ''edged tools," and the experiments here described have 
convinced mo. that the large blades were employed as axes. 



MODES OF KEEPING TIME KNOWN AMONG THE CHINESE. 



*By D. J. Magowan, M. I). 



According to the Slui-king, we liud that forty-five centuries ago the 
Chinese had occupied themselves with the construction of astronomical 
instruments analogous to the ([uadrant and armillary sphere; the 
observations they made with them, even at that remote period, are 
remarkable for their accuracy, enabling them to form a useful calendar. 
The present sexagenary cycle was adopted b. c. 2030, by Hwangti, to 
wiiom is attributed the invention of the clepsydra. The instrument at 
that- period was probably very rude, used principally for astronomical 
purposes in the same maniun- as employed by Tycho Brahe for measur- 
ing the motion of stars, and subsequently by Dudelz in making mari- 
time observations. It was committed to the care of an officer styled 
the clepsydra adjuster. 

Duke Chan, the alleged inventor of the compass, about b. c. 1130, 
appears also to have been the first to employ the clepsydra as a time- 
piece. He divided the floating index into one hundred Mh, or parts. 
In winter forty lih were allotted for the day and sixty for the night; 
in summer this was reversed, the spring and autum l^eing equally 
divided. This instrument was jjrovided with forty-eight indices, two 
for each of the twenty-four tsich, or terms of the year. They were con- 
sequently changed semi-monthly, one index being employed for the day 
and another for the night. Two were employed every day, probably to 
remedy in a measure the defect of all clepsydras, i. e., of varying in the 
speed of their rise and fall, according to the ever-varying quantity of 
water in tlie vessel, which might be done by having the indices differ- 
ently divided. To keep the water from freezing, the instrument was 
connected with a furnace, and surrounded with hot water. The forms 
of the apparatus'have boon various, but they generally consisted of an 
upper and a lower copper vessel, the former having an aperture in the 
bottom through which water ])ercolated into the latter, where floated 
an index, the gradual rise of which indicated successive periods of time.

In some this was reversed, the float being made to mark time by its fall. 
A portable one was sometimes employed in ancient times on horseback. 

Instruments constructed on the same principles were in use amongst 
the Chaldeans and Egyptians at an early period; that of Ctesibius of 
Alexandria being an improvement over those of more ancient times. 
The invention in Western Asia was doubtless independent of that in 
Eastern, both being the result of similar wants. Clepsydras were sub- 
sequently formed of a succession of vessels communicating by tubes 
passing through figures of dragons and other images, which were ren- 
dered still more ornamental by the indices being held in the hands of 
genii. The earliest application of motion to the clepsydra appears to 
have been in the reign of Shunti A. d. 12G-145, by Tsiang-hung, who 
constructed a sort of orrery representing the apparent motion of the 
heavenly bodies around the earth, which was kept in motion by 
dropping water. There is also a reference to an instrument of this 
description in the third century. 

In the sixth century an instrument was in use which indicated the 
course of time by the weight of water, as it gradually came from the 
beak of a bird, and was received in a vessel on a balance, every pound 
representing a Mh. About this time mercury began to be employed in 
clepsydras instead of water, which rendered the aid of heat in winter 
unnecessary. Changes were made also in the relative number of Mh 
for day and night, so as to vary with the seasons as in Europe. Monks 
of the Romish Church devoted considerable attention to the construc- 
tion of instruments for measuring time; in like manner also, Budhist 
monks in their silent retreats, but at an earlier period, similarly occu- 
pied themselves. Several contrivances to measure time are mentioned 
in Chinese history as the invention of priests. One was a perforated 
copper vessel, placed in a tub of water, which gradually filled and sunk 
every hour; such a rude machine required of course constant attention. 

Although their knowledge of hydro-dynamics is limited, the Chinese 
appear to have been the first to invent the form of clepsydra to which 
the term water clock is alone properly applied — that is to say, an appar- 
atus which rendered watching unnecessary by striking the hours. 
Until the beginning of the eighth century the i)ersons employed to 
watch the clepsydra in palaces and public places struck bells or drums 
at every Jcih, but at this period a clock was constructed, consisting of 
four vessels, with machinery which caused a drum to be struck by day 
and a bell by night, to indicate the hours and watches. No descrip- 
tion of the works of this interesting invention can be found. It is pos- 
sible however that the Saracens may have anticipated the Chinese in 
the invention of water clocks. In the History of the Tang Dynasty it 
is stated that in the Fuhlin country (which in this instance doubtless 
means Persia, though the geographer Sii makes it Judea), there is a 
clepsydra on a terrace near the palace formed of a balance which con- 
tained twelve metallic balls, one of which fell every hour on a bell, and

tlius Struck the hours correctly. It is not improbable that this instru- 
ment is identical with the celebrated one which the King of Persia sent 
in the year SOT to Charlemagne. 

Ju 080 an astronomer named Tsiaug made an improvement on all 
former instruments, and considering the period it was a remarkable 
specimen of art. The machine was arranged in a sort of mi nature ter- 
race, ten feet high, and was divided into three stories, the works being 
in the middle. Twelve images of men, one for every hour, appeared in 
turn before an opening in the terrace. Another set of automata struck 
tlie twelvr. hours and the eighths of such hours. These ligures occu- 
pied the lower story. The upi)er story was devoted to astronomy, 
where there was an orrery in motion, which it is obvious nuist have 
rendered very complex machinery necessary. We are oidy told that 
it had <ibli(pie, perpendicular, and horizontal wheels, and that it was 
kei)t in motion by falling Avater. As the Arabs had reached China by 
sea at the elose of the eighth century, and by land at an earlier period, 
some assistance may have been derived from them in the construction 
of tliis instrument, but I am disposed to consider it wholly Chinese. 
Beckmann, after much learned research, ascribes the invention of clocks 
to the Saracens, and the first appearance of their instruments in 
Europe to the eleventh century. 

^Mention may here be made of other timekeeping instruments of the 
same description, also constructed about this i)eriod. One, which 
like the last united an orrery and ch^psydra, was formed in one part 
like a w^ater lily, whilst in another were unages of a dragon, a tiger, a 
bird, and a tortoise, which struck the Mh on a drum, and a dozen 
]>uppets which struck hours on a bell, with various other motions, 
besides a representation of the revolutions of the heavenly bodies. The 
machinery of another of these was moved by an undershot water- 
wlu'cl, its axis was even with the surface of the ground, and conse- 
(juently the frame containing it was i)artly below the surface. The 
motions of the sun and moon, stars and planets, were made to revolve 
from east to west around a figure of the earth, represented as a plain. 
Images of men struck tlie hour and its parts. In this, as in all the 
above-named instruments, the number of strokes was doubtless always 
the sanu', as Chinese do not count but nanu^ the liours. 

Another machine was contrived whicli also represented the motion 
of the heavenly bodies. It was a huge liollow globe, i)erforated on its 
surface so as to aftbrd, when lighted uj), a good representation of tlie 
sky in the dark. This also was set in motion by falling watei'. Sub- 
sequent to this various machines are mentioned, but the brief notices 
given afford nothing of interest until we a]iproach the close of the 
Yuen dynasty. Shun-tsing (A. d. 1.)30-'()()), the last emperor of the 
Mongol race, described in history as an effeminate prince with the 
l)hysiognomy of a monkev, was evidently a man of great mechanical 
skill, and to the last amused himself by making models of vessels,

automata, aucl tiuiepieces. His chief work was a macliiue contained 
in a box 7 feet liigii and 3.^ wide, with three small temples on top. 
The middle of these temples had fairies holding horary characters, one 
of which made her appearance every hour. Time was struck by a couple 
of gods, and it is said they kept it very accurately. In the side temples 
were representations of the sun and moon respectively, and from these 
lilaces genii issued, crossing a bridge to the middle temple, and after 
ascertaining, as it' were, the time of clay from the fairies, returning 
again to their quarters. It is thought the motions were in this case 
eflected by sjunngs. An instrument somewhat similar is described as 
being in the capital at Corea; it was a clepsydra, with springs repre- 
senting the motions of the celestial orbs, and having automata to strike 
the hour. Since the introduction of European clocks, cle]).sydras have 
fallen into disuse. The only one perhaps in the empire is that in a 
watchtower in the city of Canton.* It is of the simplest form, having 



* This clepsydra is found on top of a gateway called Shwang-mun ti, standing in 
tbe street called Hiung chin fang, leading north from the great South Gate to the 
Puching sz' office. This street, or avenue, is more than 50 feet wide, and this double 
gateway crosses the street in its widest part like Temple Bar in London, each pas- 
sage being about 20 feet across. The structure is very strongly built, and is ascended 
by stone steps on the outside ; on the top is a two-storied red loft, called Kuug-peh 
lau, the upper story of which serves as a repository for the blocks used in the 
printing office in the lower story From this printing office are issued statistical 
and other official works, under the direction of the Puching sz'. In the middle wall 
is a vault, and the ground sounds hollow underneath. The statistics of Kwang chan 
fu (Canton) gives the following notices of the edifice: "The Kuug-peh lau lies 
south of the Puching sz' office, and was called theTsinghai lau in the Tang dynastj*; 
it stood between two hills, which Siu Hien levelled, and there erected a double 
stone gateway. The General Sz'ma Kill in a. d. 1100, re-built it, and called it the 
Double Gateway; it was destroyed about 1350, and re-built as before by Hnngwn in 
1.380, and again rejiaired in 1654 by Shunchi, and by Kaughi in 1687. On the top is 
a clejisydra, whi'-h the officer Chin Yungho made in 1315, during the reign of 
Jintsung." 

The clepsydra is called the tung-tvu-iih-lun, i. c, copper jar drojijier, and is placed 
in a separate room, under the supervision of a man who, besides his stipend and 
perquisites, obtains a livelihood by selling time-sticks. There are four covered 
coiJiier jars standing on a brickwork stairway, the top of each of which is level 
with the bottom of the one above it; the largest measures 23 inches high and broad, 
and contains 70 catties, or 97i pints of water; the second is 22 inches high and 21 
inches broad; the third is 21 inches high, and 20 inches broad; and the lowest 
23 inches high .and 19 inches broad. Each is connected with the other by an open 
trough, along Avhich the water trickles. The Avooden index in the lowest jar is set 
every morning and afternoon at 5 o'clock, by i>lacing the mark on it for these hours 
even with the cover, through which it rises and indicates the time. The water is 
dipped out and poured back into the top jar when the index shows the completion 
of the half day; and the water is renewed every quarter. Two large drums stand 
in the room, on which the watchmen strike the watches during the night. Probably 
a ruder contriA'ance to diAade time can hardly be found the world over, and if it 
Avas not for the clocks and watches everyAvhere in use, Avhich easily rectify its 
inaccuracies, the Cantonese Avould soon be greatly behindhand in their reckoning, 
so far as they had to de])eu(l on this clepsydra and the time-sticks Avhich are burnt 
to regulate it. — Editor Cliimsc J/vpositorii (.July, 1851).

no movenu^us of any kind, bnt it is said to keep accurate time. The 
Chinese automata so much admired, are in tlieir internal structure imi- 
tations of foreign articles. 

Tn dialling- the Chinese haxe never accomplished anything-, being de- 
ficient in the requisite knowledge of astronomy and mathematics. It 
is true the projection of the shadow of the gnomon was carefully ob- 
served at an early historic period for astronomical purposes. Proper 
sun-dials were unquestionably derived from the West; but they were 
not introduced, as Sir John Davis supposes, by the Jesuits. The Chi- 
nese are probably indebted to the Mohammedans for this instrument, 
although we find an astronomer endeavoring to rectify the clepsydra 
by means of the sun's shadow, projected by a gnomon, about a century 
earlier than the Hejira. There is one in the Imperial Observatory at 
Peking more than 4 feet iu diameter. Smaller ones are sometimes met 
with in i)ublic offices, all made under the direction of Romish mission- 
aries or their pupils. 

From remote antiquity a family named Wang, residing in Hiu-ning- 
hien (latitude 20° 53' N., longitude 118° 17' E.) in the province of 
Nganhwui, has had the exclusive manufacture of pocket compasses, 
with which sun-dials are often connected. In most of these a thread 
attached to the lid of the instrument serves as a gnomon without any 
adaptation for different latitudes, although they are in use in every 
part of the empire. Another form, rather less rude, used by clock- 
makers for adjusting their time]>ieces, is marked with notches, one for 
each month of the year, to give the gnomon a different angle every 
month. The one used by the Japanese exceeds that made in China in 
every respect. 

Time is often kept with tolerable accuracy in shops and temples by 
burning incense sticks made of sawdust, carefully, but slightly, mixed 
with glue, and evcidy rolled into cylinders two feet long, and divided 
off into hours. When lighted, they gradually consume away without 
tiame, burning up in half a day. Hour-glasses are scarcely known iu 
China, and only mentioned in dictionaries as instruments employed in 
western countries to measure time. A native writer on antiquities 
says the Avestern priest, hi Ma-tan (M. Kicci), nmde a clock which re- 
volved and struck time a whole year without error. The clock brought 
out by llicci, if not the lirst seen iu China, is the earliest of Avhich men- 
tion is made in Chinese history. This subsequently became an article 
of import, and this branch of trade has for a long time been, and is 
still, of considerable value. Clocks and watches of very antique ap- 
pearance arc often met with, specimen,s of the original models scarcely 
to be found in any other country. Some of the latter, by their clumsy 
figure, remind one of their ancient name, "Nuremburg eggs," but their 
workmanslii]) must have been superior to that of most modern ones, or 
they would not be found in (»])eration at this late day. 



612 MODES OF KEEPING TIME KNOWN AMONG THE CHINESE. 

The Chinese must have commenced clock-making at an early period, 
for no one now engaged in the trade can tell nio when or where it origi- 
nated, nor can it be easily ascertained whether their imitative powers 
alone enabled them to engage in such a craft, or whether they are in- 
debted to the Jesuits for what skill they i^ossess. It is certain that 
the disciples of Loyola had for a long time, and until quite recently in 
their corps at Peking, some who were machinists and watch-makers 
One of these horolor/ists complains in Les Lettres Edifiantes that his. 
time was so much occupied with mending the watches of the grandees 
that he had never been able to study the language. Doubtless the 
fashion which Chinese gentlemen have of carrying a couple of watches, 
which they are anxious should always harmonize, gave the man con- 
stant employment. A retired statesman of this province has published 
a very good account of clocks and watches, accompanied with draw- 
ings representing their internal structure in a manner sufficiently in- 
telligible. The Chinese divide the whole day into twelve parts, which 
are not numbered, but each one is designated by a character, termed 
horary. These characters were originally employed in forming the 
nomenclature of the sexagenary cycle, which is still in common use. 
It was not until a much later j)eriod that the duodecimal division of 
the civil day came into use, when terms to express them were bor- 
rowed from the ancient calendar. The same characters are also ap- 
phed to the months. The first in the list, tsz' sou, is emjiloyed at the 
commencement of every cycle, and to the first of every period of twelve 
years, and also to the commencement of the civil day, at 11 p. m., com- 
prising the period between this and 1 A. m. The mouth which is des- 
ignated by this term is not the first of the Chinese year, and singu- 
larly enough coincides with January. Each of the twelve hours is 
divided into Ai//, answering to a quarter of an hour. This diurnal divi- 
sion of time does not appear to have been in use in the time of Confu- 
cius, as mention is made in the spring and autumn annals of the ten 
hours of the day, which accords with the decimal divisions so long 
employed in clepsydras, the indices of which were uniformly divided 
into one hundred x^arts. A commentator in the third century of our 
era, explaining the passage relating to the teu hours, adds a couple of 
hours, but even at that time the j)resent horary characters were not 
employed. 



NAVAJO DYE STUFFS.* 



By Dr. Washington Matthews, U. S. Army. 



The art of ^yeaving amoiij? the Navajo Indians of New Mexico and 
Arizona is of aboriginal origin. They probably learned the art from 
the ancient Pneblo Indians. No native tribe has carried it to such per- 
fection nor in any has European influence had less effect. 

Material for fabrics. — Cotton which grows well in New Mexico and 
Arizona, tlie tough fibers of yucca leaves and the fibers of other plants, 
the hair of different quadrupeds, and the down of birds furnished in 
prehistcn-ic days the materials of textile fabrics in this country. While 
some of the Pueblos still weave their native cotton to a slight extent, 
the Navajos grow no cotton and spin nothing but the wool of the 
domestic sheep, of Spanish introduction, and of which the Navajos 
have vast herds. The wool is not washed until it is sheared. It is 
combed with hand combs jairchased from the Americans. In spin- 
ning, the simplest form of the spindle, a-slender stick thrust through 
the center of a round wooden disk, is used. The Mexicans on the Rio 
Grande use si)inning wheels, and although the Navajos have some of 
their own, and have abundant opportunities for buying or stealing 
them, and possess, I think, sufficient ingenuity to make them, they 
have never abandoned the rude implement of their ancestors. The 
Navajo method of handling the spindle is different from that of the 
people of Zuni. 

Tlie Navajos still employ, to a great extent, their native dyes; of 
yellow, reddish, and black. There is good evidence that they formerly 
had a blue dye; but indigo, originally introduced, I think, by the 
]Mexicans, has superseded this. 

Specimen No. 1, Catalogue No. 153348, is wool dyed blue with indigo, 
the mordant being urine. If they in former days had a native blue 
and a native yellow, they must also, of course, have had a green, and 
they now make green of their native yellow and indigo, the latter be- 
ing the only imported dye-stuff I have ever seen in use among them. 
Besides the hues above indicated, the people have had, ever since the 
introduction of sheep, wool of three natural colors — white, rusty black.

and gray — so tiiey liavo always a fair raiigc^ ol' tints with wliicli to 
execute tlieir artistic designs. The brilliant red lignres in tlieir finer 
blankets were, a few years ago, made entirely of hayctay and this mate- 
rial is still largely used. Bay eta is a bright, scarlet cloth, with a long 
nap, much finer in api>earance than the scarlet strouding which forms 
such an important article in the Indian trade of the jSTorth. It was 
originally brought to the Navajo country from Mexico, but is now sup- 
plied to the trade from our eastern cities. The Indians ravel it and 
use the weft. While many handsome blankets are still made only of 
the colors and material above described, American yarn has lately be- 
come very jjopular among the Navajos, and many fine blankets are 
now made wholly, or in part, of Germantown wool. 

Yellow. — There are, the Indians tell me, three different processes for 
dyeing yellow; two of these I witnessed. The first process is thus 
conducted. (Specimen jSTo. 2, Catalogue No. 153349, is wool dyed by 
this process.) 

The flowering tops of Bigelovia graveolens are boiled for about six 
hours, until a decoction of deep-yellow color is produced. When tlie 
dyer thinks the decoction is strong enough, she heats over the fire in 
a pan or earthen vessel some native almogen (an impure native alum), 
until it is reduced to a somewhat pasty consistency; this she adds 
gradually to the decoction, and then puts the wool in the dye to boil. 
From time to time a i)ortion of the wool is taken out and inspected 
until (in about half an hour from the time it is first immersed) it is 
seen to have assumed the proper color. The work is then done. The 
tint produced is nearly that of lemon color. (No. 2.) 

In the second process they use the large fleshy root of a plant which, 
as I have never yet seen it in fruit or flower, I am unable to determine. 
The fresh root is crushed to a soft paste on the metate, and, for a mor- 
dant, the almogen is added while the grinding is going on. The cold 
paste is then rubbed between the hands into the wool. If the wool 
does not seem to take the color readily a little water is dashed on the 
mixture of wool and paste, and the whole is very slightly warmed. The 
entire process does not occupy over an hour, and the result is a color 
much like that now known as "old gold." 

The dull reddish dye, specimen No. 3, Catalogue No. 153350, is made 
of the bark of the Alder, Alnus incaua var. virescens (Watson) and the 
bark of the Cercocarpus parvifoliusj a kind of mountain mahogany. On 
buckskin this makes a brilliant tan color, but applied to wool it pro- 
duces a much paler shade, as shown in the specimen (No. 3). 

The orange dye, Specimen No. 4, Catalogue No. 153351, is made from 
the roots of a sorrel Rumex hipnenosepalimi. 

Specimen No. 5, Catalogue No. 153352, is wool, half natural white 
and half dyed black, carded together.

of the pinon {Pinus ednliH), Specimen Xo. 8, ( Jatalooue No. 153355. The 
process of preparing it is as follows: They put into a pot of water some 
of the leav(is of tlie sumac, and as many of the branchlets as cUn be 
crowded in without nuich breaking or crushing, and the water is 
allowed to boil for five or six hours until a strong decoction is made. 
While the water is boiling they attend to other parts of the process. 
The oclier is reduced to a line powder between two stones and then 
slowly roasted over the fire in an earthen or metal vessel until it as- 
sumes a light-brown color; it is then taken from the fire and combined 
with about an equal quantity in size of pinon gum; again the mixture 
is put on the fire and constantly stirred. At first the gum melts and 
the whole mass assumes a mushy consistency ; but as the roasting prog- 
resses it gradually becomes dryer aud darker until it is at last reduced 
to a fine black powder. This is removed from the fire, and when it has 
cooled somewhat it is thrown into the decoction of sumac, with which 
it instantly forms a rich, blue-black fluid. This dye is essentially an 
ink, the tannic acid of the sumac combining with the sesquioxide of 
iron in the roasted (K'her, the whole enriched by the carbon of the cal- 
cined gum.

SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC BOTANY.* 



By George Lincoln Coodale. 



The subject whicli I have selected for the valedictory address deals 
with certain industrial, commercial, and economic questions: neverthe- 
less its lies wholly within the domain of botany. I invite you to ex- 
amine with me some of the possibilities of economic botany. 

Of course, when treatinji,- a topic which is so largely speculative as 
this, it is €lilii(;ult and unwise to draw a hard and fast line between 
possibilities and probabilities. Nowadays possibiUties are so often 
realized rapidly that they become accomplished fiicts before we are 
aware. 

In asking what are the i)ossibilities that other plants than those we 
now use may be utilized we enter upon a many-sided inquiry.t Specu- 
lation is rife as to the coming man. May we not ask what plants the 
coming man will use? 

There is an enormous disproportion between the total number of 
species of plants known to botanical science and the number of those 
which are employed by man. 

Tlie species of flowering plants already described and named are abovit 
107,()0(>. Acquisitions from unexplored or imi)erfectly explored regions 
may increase the aggregate perhaps one-tenth, so that we are within

very sate limits iu takini;" the luimber ol' existiii.y si>eeies to be some- 
what above 110,000.* 

Now if we should make a eompreheiisive list of all the flowering plants 
^hich are cultivated on what we may call a fairly large scale at the 
present day, placing therein all foodt and forage plants, all those which 
are grown for timber and cabinet woods, for fibers and cordage, for 
tanning materials, dyes, resins, rubber, gums, oils, perfumes, and medi- 
cines, we could briug together barely 300 species. If Ave should add 
to this short catalogue all the sj^ecies which without cultivation 
can be used by man, we should find it considerably lengthened. A 
gieat many products of the classes just referred to are derived in 
commerce from wild plants, but exactly how much their addition would 
extend the list it is impossible, in the present state of knowledge, to 
determine. Every enumeration of this character is likely to contain 
errors from two sources: Eirst, it would be sure to contain some 
species which have outlived their real usefulness; and, secondly, owing 
to the chaotic condition of the literature of the subject, omissions would 
occur. 

But, after all proper exclusious and additions have been made, the 
total number of species of flowering plants utilized to any considerable 
extent by man iu his civilized state does not exceed, in fact it does not 
quite reach, 1 per cent.

been cultivated for food at one time or another, the list contains 1,192 species, but if 
we count all the plants which "either habitually or during famine periods are re- 
ccuded to have been eaten," we obtain a list of no less than 4,690 species, or about 3^ 
per cent of all known species of plants. But, as Sir .Joseph Hooker has said, the 
products of many i)lants thougli c'ltable, arc not fit to eat. 



SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC BOTANY. 619 

The disproportion between the plants which are known and those 
which are used becomes mnch greater Avhen we take into acconnt the 
species of flowerless plants also. Of the 500 ferns and their allies we 
employ, for other than decorative pnrposes, only 5; the mosses and 
liverworts, ronghly estimated at 500 species, have only 4 which are 
directly used by man. There are comparatively feM^ algfe, fungi, or 
lichens which have extended use. 

Therefore, when we take the flowering and flowerless together, the 
percentage of utilized plants falls far below the estimate made for the 
flowering alone. 

Such a ratio between the number of species known and the number 
used justifies the inquiry which I have proposed for discussion at this 
time, namely, cau the short list of useful plants be increased to advan- 
tage? If so, how? 

This is a practical question j it is likewise a very old one. In one 
form or another, by one people or another, it has been asked from early 
times. In the dawn of civilization mankind inherited from savage an- 
cestors certain plants, whicli had been found amenable to simple culti- 
vation, and the products of these plants supplemented the spoils of the 
chase and of the sea. The question which we ask now w^as asked then. 
Wild plants were examined for new uses; primitive agriculture and 
horticulture extended their bounds in answer to this inquiry. Age 
after age has added slowly and cautiously to the list of cultivable and 
utilizable plants, but the aggregate additions have been, as we have 
seen, comparatively slight. 

The question has thus no charm of novelty, but it is as practical 
to-day as in early ages. In tact, at the present time, in view of all the 
appliances at the command of modern science and under the strong 
light cast by recent biological and technological research, the inquiry 
which we propose assumes great importance. One phase of it is being 
attentively and systematically regarded in the great experiment sta- 
tions, another phase is being studied in the laboratories of chemistry 
and pharmacy, while still another presents itself in the museums of 
economic botany. 

Our question may be put in other words, which are even more prac- 
tical. What present likelihood is there that our tables may, one of 
these days, have other vegetables, fruits, and cereals than those which 
we use now? What chance is there that new fibers may supplement 
or even replace those which we spin and weave, that woven fabrics 
may take on new vegetable colors, that flowers and leaves may yield 
new i)erfumes and flavors? What probability is there that new reme- 
dial agents may be found among plants neglected or now wholly un- 
known? The answer which I shall attempt is not in the nature of a 
]>r()phecy; it can claim no rank higher than that of a reasonable con- 
jecture. 

At the outset it must be said that synthetic chemistry has madetmd 

liort cuts acioss tliis field of research,

j>iviug US iirliliciiil dyes, odors, iiavors, and uiediciual substances, ol" 
siK'b excelleuce that it sometimes seems as if before loug the old-fasli- 
ioued chemical processes in the plaut itself would play only a subordi- 
nate part. But although there is no telling where the triumphs of 
chemical synthesis will end, it is not probable that it will ever interfere 
essentially with certain classes of economic plants. It is impossible to 
conceive of a synthetic iiber or a synthetic fruit. Chemistry gives as 
fruit ethers and fruit acids, and after a while may provide us with a 
true artificial sugar and amorphous starch ; but artificial fruits worth 
the eating, or artificial fibers worth the spinning, are not coming in our 
day. 

Despite the extraordinary achievements of synthetic chemistry, the 
world must be content to accept, for a long time to come, the results of 
the intelligent labor of the cultivator of the soil and the explorer of the 
forest. Improvement of the good i)lants we now utilize, and the dis- 
covery of new ones, must remain the care of large numbers of diligent 
students and assiduous workmen. So that in fact our question re- 
solves itself into this: Can these practical investigators hope to make 
any substantial advance! 

It will be well to glance first at the manner in which our wild and 
cultivated plants have been singled out for use. We shall, in the case 
of each class, allude to the methods by which the selected plants have 
been improved, or their products fully utilized. Thus looking the ground 
over, although not minutely, we can see what new plants are likely to 
be added to our list. Our illustrations can at the best be only frag- 
mentary. 

We shall not have time to treat the different divisions of the subject 
in precisely the proportions which would be demanded by an exhaust- 
ive essay 5 an address on an occasion like this must pass lightly over 
some matters which other opportunities for discussion could properly 
examine with great fulness. Unfortunately, some of the minor topics 
which must be thus passed by possess considerable popular interest; 
one of these is the first subordinate question introductory to our task, 
namely, how were our useful cultivated and wild plants selected for 
use? 

A study of the early history of plants employed for ceremonial pur- 
130ses, in religious solemnities, in incantations, and for medicinal uses, 
shows how slender has sometimes been the claim of certain plants to 
the possession of any real utility. But some of the plants which have 
been brought to notice in these ways have afterwards been found to be 
utilizable in some fashion or other. This is often seen in the cases of 
the plants which have been suggested for medicinal use through the 
absurd doctrine of signatures.* 

It seems clear that except in modern times useful plants have been 
selected almost wholly by chance, and it may well be said that a selec-

tioii by accideut is no selection at all. iS^owadays the new selections 
are based on analogy. One of the most striking illustrations of the 
modern method is afforded by the utilization of bamboo fiber for electric 
lamps. 

Some of the classes of useful plants must be passed l)y without pres- 
ent discussion, others alluded to slightly, while still other groups 
fairly representative of selection and improvement will be more fully 
described. In this latter class would naturally come, of course, the 
food plants known as 

I. — THE CEREALS. 

Let us look first at these. The siiecies of grasses wliich yield these 
seed-like fruits, or, as we might call them for our purpose, seeds, are 
numerous;* 20 of them are cultivated largely in the Old World, but 
only six of them are likely to be very familiar to you, namely, wheat, 
rice, barley, oats, rye, and maize. The last of these is of American 
origin, despite d(mbts which have been cast upon it. It was not known 
in the Old AVorld until after the discovery of the New. It has prob- 
ably been very long in cultivation. The others all belong to the Old 
World. Wheat and barley have been cultivated from the earliest 
times; according to De Candolle, the chief authority in these matters, 
about four thousand years. Later came rye and oats, both of which 
have been known in cultivation for at least two thousand years. Even 
the shorter of these periods gives time enough for wide variation, and 
as is to be expected there are numerous varieties of them all. For in- 
stance, Vilmorin, in 1880, figured sixty-six varieties of wheat with 
l)laiuly distinguishable characters.t 

If the Chinese records are to be trusted, ri(;e has been cultivated for 
a period much longer than that assigned by our history and traditions 
to the other cereals, and the A'arieties are correspondingly numerous. 
It is said that in Japan above three hundred varieties are grown on 
irrigated lands, and more than one hundred on uplands.^ 

AVith the i)()ssible exception of rice, not one of the species of cereals 
is certainly known in the wild state.§ NoHv and then specimens have 
been gathered in the East which can be referred to the probable types 
from which our varieties have sprung, but doubt has been thrown 
upon every one of these cases. It has been shown conclusively that 
it is easy for a plant to escape from cultivation and persist in its new 



* In Dr. Sturtevaut's list, 88 species of Graminece are counted as food plants under 
fultivatiou, wliile the number of species in this order which can be or have been 
utilized as food amounts to 146. Our smaller number, 20, comprises only those which 
have beeu grown ou a large scale anywhere.

\N The best account of the early history of these and other cultirated plants can 
be found in tlie classical work of De Caudolle " Oriqine da I'laiites CuU'n-i'cs (Paris) 
translated in the luternatioual series, Tlistorij of CiiUiratcd Plants (N. Y.). The

622 SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC BOTANY. 

home even for a long time in ii near approximation to cnltivated form. 
Hence, we are forced to receive all statements regarding tlie wild 
forms with cantion. Bnt it may be safely said that if all the varieties 
of cereals which we now cultivate were to be swept out of existence, 
we could hardly know where to turn for wild species with which to 
begin again. We could not know with certainty. 

To bring this fact a little more vividly to our minds, let us suppose a 
case. Let us imagine that a blight without parallel has brought to ex- 
tinction all the forms of wheat, rice, rye, oats, barley, and maize, now in 
cultivation, but without affecting the other grasses or any other form 
of vegetable food. Mankind would be obliged to subsist upon the other 
kindly fruits of the earth ; upon root crops, tubers, leguminous seeds, 
and so on. Some of the substitutions might be amusing in any other 
time than that of a threatened famine. Others would be far from appetiz- 
ing under any condition, and only a few would be wholly satisfying even 
to the most pronounced vegetarian. In short, it vvould seem from the 
first, that the cereals fill a place occupied by no other plants. The com- 
position of the grains is theoretically and practically almost perfect as 
regards food ratiobetween the nitrogenous matters and the starch group ; 
and the food value, as it is termed, is high. But aside from these 
considerations, it would be seen that for safety of preservation through 
considerable j)eriods, and for convenience of transportation, the cere- 
als take highest rank. Pressure would come from every side to compel 
us to find equivalents for the lost grains. From this predicament I 
believe that the well-equipped Experiment Stations and the Agri- 
cultural Departments in Europe and America would by and by extri- 
cate us. Continuing this hypothetical case, let us next inquire how 
the stations would i^robably go to work in the up-hill task of making 
l^artially good a well-nigh irreparable loss. 

The whole grouj) of relatives of the lost cereals would be passed in 
strict review. Size of grain, strength and vigor and plasticity of stock, 
adaptability to different surroundings, and flexibility in variation would 
be examined with scrupulous care. 

But the range of experiment would, under the circumstances, extend 
far beyond the relatives of our present cereals. It would embrace an 
examination of the other grasses which are even now cultivated for 
their grains, but which are so little known outside of their own limit 
that it is a surprise to hear about them. For example, the millets, 
great and small, would be investigated. These grains, so little known 
here, form an important crop iu certain parts of the East. One of the 
leading authorities on the subject* states that the millets constitute 



* Food grains of India, A. H. Church, London, 1886, p. 34. In this instructive 
work the reader will find much information regarding the less common articles 
of food. Of Panicum fnimcntaceiiin Prof. Georgeson states iu a letter that it is 
grown in Japiui for its grain which is used for food, but here would take rank as a 
fodder plant. 



SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC BOTANY. 623 

"a more important crop'' in India "than either rice or wheat, and 
are grown more extensively, being raised from Madras in the south to 
Kajputana in the north. They occupy about 83 j)er cent of the food 
gram area in Bombay and Sinde, 41 per cent in the Punjab, 39 per 
cent in the Central Provinces," " in all about 30,000,000 acres." 

Having chosen proper subjects for experimenting, the cultivators 
would make use of certain well-known i)rinciples. By simple selection 
of the more desirable seeds, strains would be secured to suit definite 
wants, and these strains would be kept as races, or attempts would be 
made to intensify wished-for characters. By skillful hybridizing of the 
first, second, and higher orders, tendencies to wider variation would be 
obtained and the process of selection considerably expedited.* 

It is out of our power to predict how much time would elapse before 
satisfactory substitutes for our cereals could be found. In the im- 
provement of the grains of grasses other than those which have been 
very long under cultivation, experiments have been few, scattered, and 
indecisive. Therefore we are as badly oft" for time ratios as are the 
geologists and archjeologists, in their statements of elapsed periods. 
It is impossible for us to ignore the fact that there appear to be occa- 
sions in the life of a species when it seems to be peculiarly susceptible 
to the influences of its surroundings.! A species, like a carefully laden 
ship, represents a balancing of forces within and without. Disturbance 
may come through variation from within, as from a shifting of the cargo, 
or in some cases from without. We may suppose both forces to be 
active in producing variation, a change in the internal condition ren- 
dering the plant more susceptible to any change in its surroundings. 
Under the influence of any nuirked disturbance, a state of unstable 
equilibrium may be brought about, at which times the species, as such, 
is easily acted upon by very slight agencies. 

One of the most marked of these derangements is a consequence of 
cross-breeding within the extreme limits of varieties. The resultant 
forms in such cases can persist only by close breeding or by propaga- 
tion from buds or the equivalents of buds. Disturbances like these 
arise unexpectedly in the ordinary course of nature, giving us sports 
of various kinds. These critical periods however are not unwelcome, 
since skillful cultivators can take advantage of them. In this very 
field nuich has l)een accomplishcil. An attentive study of the saga- 



* In order to avoid possible misapprehension, it should be stated that there are a 
few persons who hold that at least some of our cereals, and other cnltivate<l plants, 
for that matter, have not nudergone material improvement but are essentially nn- 
modilied jjrogeny. Under this view, if we could look back into the farthest past, 
we should see our cereals growing wild and in such admirable condition that we 
should unhesitatingly select them for immediate use. This extreme position is un- 
tenable. Again, there are a f<>w extremists who hold that some plants under culti- 
vation have reached their culminating point, and must now remain stationary or 
l)egin to reti'ograde.

cions work done by Thomas Audrew Kuight shows to what extent this 
can be done.* But we must confess that it would be absolutely impos- 
sible to predict with certainty how long or how short would be the 
time before new cereals or acceptable equivalents for them would be 
provided. Upheld by the confidence which I have in the intelligence, 
ingenuity, and energy of our Experiment Stations, I may say that the 
time would not probably exceed that of two generations of our race, or 
half a century. 

In now laying aside our hypothetical illustration, 1 venture to ask 
why it is that our Exijeriment Stations and other institutions dealing 
with plants and their improvement do not undertake investigations 
like those which I have sketched? Why are not some of the grasses 
other than our present cereals studied with reference to their adoption 
as food grains? One of these species will naturally suggest itself to 
you all, namely, the Wild Eice of the Lakes.t Observations have 
shown that were it not for the difficulty of harvesting tliese grains 
which fall too easily when they are ripe, they might be utilized. But 
attentive search might find or educe some variety of Zizania with a 
more persistent grain and a better yield. There are two of our sea- 
shore grasses which have excellent grains, but are of small yield 
Why are not these, or better ones which might be suggested by obser- 
vation, taken in hand? 

The reason is plain. We are all content to move along in lines of 
least resistance, and are disinclined to make a fresh start. It is merely 
leaving well enough alone, and so far as the cereals are concerned it is 
indeed well enough. The generous grains of modern varieties of wheat 
and barley compared with the well-preserved charred vestiges found in 
Greece by Schliemann,J and in the lake dwelliugs,§ are satisfactory in

every respect. Improvements however are making in many direc;- 
tions; and in the cereals we now have, we possess far better and more 
satisfactory material for further improvement, both in quality and as 
regards range of distribution, than we could reasonably hope to have 
from otlier grasses. 

P'rom the cereals we may turn to the interesting groups of plants 
comprised under the general term. 

II. — VEGETABLES. 

Under this term it will be convenient for us to include all ])lants 
which are employed for culinary purposes or for table use, such as 
salads and relishes. 

The i)otato and sweet potato, the pumpkin and squash, the red or 
capsicum ])eppers, and the tomato are of American origin. 

All the others are most probably natives of the Old World. Only 
one plant coming in this class has been derived from southern Aus- 
tralasia, namely, New Zealand sjjinach {Tetragonia). 

Among the vegetables and salad plants longest in cultivation we 
may enumerate the following: Turnip, onion, cabbage, purslane, the 
large bean (Faba), chick-pea, lentil, and one species of pea — garden pea. 
To these an antiquity of at least four thousand years is ascribed. 

Next to these, in point of age, come the radish, carrot, beet, garlic, 
garden-cress, and celery, lettuce, asparagus, and the leek. Tliree or 
four leguminous seeds are to be placed in the same category, as are also 
the black peppers. 

Of more recent introduction, the most prominent are tlie parsnip, 
oyster plant, i^arsley, artichoke, endive, and spinach. 

From these lists T have purposely omitted a few which belong ex- 
clusively to the tropics, such as certain yams. 

The number of varieties of these vegetables is astounding. It is of 
course im])ossible to discriminate between closely allied varieties which 
have been introduced by gardeners and seedsmen under different 
names, but which are essentially identical, and we must therefore have 
recourse to a conservative authority, Vilmorin,* from whose w ork a few 

were the six-rowed bailey and small ' Lake Dwellers ' " wheat. The discovery of 
Ejryptiau wheat {Triticum turgidtim) at Wangen and Robenhausen is particnlarly 
interesting. Oats wore cultivated during the bronze age, but are absent from all 
the stone ago villages. Rye was also unknown,"' p. 216. '' Wheat is most common, 
having boon discovered at Morlen, Moosscodorf, and Wangen. At the latter place, 
indeed, many bushels of it were found, the grains being in large, thick lum])S. In 
other cases the grains are free, and without chaff, resembling our present wheat in 
size and form, while more rarely they are still in the ear." One hundred and lifteeu 
species of plants have been identified. Heer Keller.

examples liave been selected. The varieties Avliicli he accepts are suf- 
ficiently well distingnishedto admit of description, and in most instances 
of delineation, without any danger of confusion. The potato has, he 
says, iunnraerable varieties, of which he accepts forty as easily distin- 
guishable and worthy of a place in a general list, but he adds also a 
list, comprising of course synonyms, of thirty-two French, twenty-six 
English, nineteen American, and eighteen German varieties. The fol- 
lowing numbers speak for themselves, all being selected in the same 
careful manner as those of the potato; celery more than twenty; carrot 
more than thirty; beet, radish, and i)otato more than forty; lettuce and 
onion more than fifty ; turnip more than seventy; cabbage, kidney bean, 
and garden pea more than one hundred. 

The amount of horticultural work wliich these numbers represent is 
enormous. Each variety established as a race (that is, a variety which 
comes true to seed) has been evolved by the same sort of patient care 
and waiting which Ave have seen is necessary in the case of cereals, but 
the time of waiting has not been as a general thing so long. 

You will permit me to quote from Vilmorin* also an account of a com- 
mon plant, which Avill .show how wide is the range of variation and how 
obscure are the indications in the wild plant of its available possibili- 
ties. The example shows how completely hidden are the potential 
variations useful to mankind. 

''Cabbage, a plant which is indigenous in Europe and western Asia, 
is one of the vegetables which has been cultivated from the earliest 
time. The ancients were well acquainted with it, and certainly pos- 
sessed several varieties of the head-forming kinds. The great antiq- 
uity of its culture may be inferred from the immense number of varieties 
which are now in existence, and from the very important modifications 
which have been produced in the characteristics in the original or parent 
plant. 

" The wild cabbage, such as it now exists on the coasts of England 
and France, is a perennial plant with broad-lobed, undulated, thick, 
smooth leaves, covered with a glaucus bloom. The stem attains a height 
of from nearly 2^ to over 3 feet, and bears at the top a spike of yellow 
or sometimes white flowers. All the cultivated varieties present the 
same i)eculiarities in their infloresence, but u^) to the time of flowering 
they exhibit the most marked differences from each other and from the 
original wild plant. In most of the cabbages it is chiefly the leaves 
that are developed by cultivation; these for the most part become im- 
bricated or overlap one another closely, so as to form a more or less 
compact head, the heart or interior of which is composed of the central 
undeveloped shoot and the younger leaves next it. The shape of the 
head is spherical, sometimes flattened, sometimes conical. All the va- 
rieties which form heads in this way are known by the general name of 



' Loc. cit., English edition, p. 101. 



SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOxMIC BOTANY. 627 

cabbagesj wliile otlier kinds, witli large braiicliing leaves whicli never 
form heads, are distinguislied by the name of borecole or kale. 

"In some kinds the flower stems have been so modified by culture 
as to become transformed into a thick, fleshy, tender mass, the growth 
and enlargement of which are produced at the expense of the flowers 
which are absorbed and rendered abortive. Such are the broccolis 
and cauliflowers." 

But this plant has other transformations. "In other kinds the leaves 
retain their ordinary dimensions, while the stem or principal root has 
been brought by cultivation to assume the shape of a large ball or tur- 
nip, as in the case of the plants known as Kohl-Rabi and turnip-rooted 
cabbage or Swedish turnip. And lastly, there are varieties in whi(*h 
cultivation and selection have produced moditications in the ribs of the 
leaves, as in the Couve Tronchuda, or in the axilary shoots (as in Brus- 
sels sprouts), or in several organs together, as in the marrow kales, 
and the Neapolitan curled kale." 

Here are important morphological changes like those to which Prof. 
Bailey has called attention in the case of the tomato. 

Suppose we are strolling along the beach at some of the seaside re- 
sorts of France, and should fall in with this coarse, cruciferous plant, 
with its sprawling leaves and strong odor. Would there be anything 
in its appearance to lead us to search for its hidden merits as a food 
l>lant ? What could we see in it which would give it a preference over 
a scoi-e of other plants at our feet ? Again, suppose we are journeying 
in the highlands of Peru, and should meet with a strong-smelling 
l)lant of the night-shade family, bearing a small, irregular fruit of sub- 
acid taste and of ])eculiar flavor. We will further imagine that the 
l»ecnliar taste strikes our fiincy, and we conceive that the plant has 
possibilities as a source of food. We should be led by our knowledge 
of the potato, jn-obably a native of the same region, to think that this 
allied plant might be safely- transferred to a northern climate, but would 
there be promise of enough future usefulness in such a case as this to 
warrant our carrying the plant north as an article of food ? Suppose, 
further, we should ascertain that the fruit in question was relished not 
only by the natives of its home, but that it had found favor among the 
tribes of South Mexico and Central America, and had been cultivated 
by them until it had attained a large size, shcmld we be strengthened 
in our venture f Let us go one step further still. Suppose that having 
decided u])<m the introduction of the plant, and having urged every- 
body to try it, we should find it discarded as a fruit, but taking a jflace 
in gardens as a curiosity under an absurd name, or as a basis for pre- 
serves and pickles; should we not look ujjon our experiment in the in- 
troduction of this new plant as a failure ? This is not a hypothetical 
case.

Tlie tomato,* the plant in questiou, was cultivated iu Europe as long' 
ago as 1554 ;t it was known iu Virginia in 1781, and iu the ASTortheru 
States in 1785 ; but it found its way into favor slowly, eveu in this laud 
of its origin, A credible witness states that iu Salem it was almost 
impossible to induce peox^le to eat or eveu taste of the fruit. And yet, 
as you are well aware, its present cultivation on an enormous scale iu 
Europe and this country is scarcely sufficient to meet the increasing 
demand. 

A plant which belongs to the family of the tomato has been known 
to the public under the name of the strawberry tomato. The juicy 
yellow or orange-colored fruit is inclosed in a papery calyx of large 
size. The descriptions which were i^ublished when the plant was placed 
on the market were attractive, and were not exaggerated to a mislead- 
ing extent. But, as you all know, the plant never gained any popu- 
larity. If we look at these two cases carefully, we shall see that what 
appears to be caprice on the part of the jjublic is at bottom common 
sense. The cases illustrate as well as any which are at connnand the 
difficulties which surround the whole subject of the introduction of new 
foods. 

Before asking specifically in what direction we shall look for new 
vegetables, I must be pardoned for calling attention, in passing, to a 
very few of the many which are already in limited use in Europe and 
this country, but which merit a wider employment. Cardon, or car- 
doon; celeriac, or turnip-rooted celery; fetticus, or corn salad; mar 
tynia; salsify; sea kale, and numerous small salads, are examples of 
neglected treasures of the vegetable garden. 

The following, which are even less known, may be nientioued as fairly 
promising :|

family. It is exteusively cultivated in some of the northern States of

* According to notes made by Mr Manning, Sec. Massachusetts Horticultural 
Society (Hisf. Ma.ss. Hort. Society), the tomato was introduced into Salem, Mass., 
about 1802 by Micbele Felice Corn6, an Italian painter, but he found it difficult to 
persuade people even to taste the fruit (Felt's Annals of Salem, vol, ii, 631). It 
Avas said to have been introduced into Philadelphia by a French i-efugee from San 
Domingo, in 1798. It was used as an article of food in New Orleans in 1812, but wais 
not sold iu the markets of Philadelphia uutil 1829. It did not come into general use 
iu the North uutil some years after the last uamed date.

hihcrous eiiliir.ucmciits fiiled with an excellent starch. Although the 
plant is of comparatively easy cultivation, efforts to introduce it into 
Kurope have not been successful, but it is said to have found favor in 
both the Indies, and may prove usefnl in our Southern States. 

(2) rUucm or OUucus, another tuberons -rooted plant from nearly 
the same region, but belonging- to tlie beet or spinach family. It has 
produced tubers of good size in England, but they are too waxy in 
consistence to dis])ute the place of the better tubers of the potato. The 
plant is worth investigating for our hot, dry lands. 

(3) A tuber-bearing relative of our common hedge nettle, or 8fachi/s, 
is now cultivated on a large scale at Crosnes, in France, for the Paris 
market. Its name in Paris is taken from the locality where it is now 
grown for use. Although its native country is Japan, it is called by 
some seedsmen Chinese artichoke. At the i)resent stage of cultiva- 
tion the tubers are small and are rather hard to keep, but it is thought 
" that both of these defects can be overcome or evaded."* Experi- 
ments indicate that we have in this species a valuable addition to our 
vegetables. We nuist next look at certain other neglected possibilities. 

Dr. Edward Palmer,! whose energy as a collector and acuteness as 
an observer are known to you all, has brought together very interest-

The following from Catliu, /. e. i, p. 122: 

"Corn and dried meat are generally laid up in the fall in sufficient quantities to 
sup])ort them through the winter. These are the principal articles of food during 
that long antl inclement season ; and in addition to them, they oftentimes have in 
store gnat (inantitics of dried squashes, and dried 'pommes blanches,' a kind of 
turnip which grows in great abundance in those regions. - - - These are 
»lried in great quantities and pounded into a sort of meal and cooked with dried 
meat and corn. Great quantities also are dried and laid away in store for the win- 
ter season, such as Iniffalo berries, service berries, strawberries, and wild plums. 
In addition to this we had the luxury of service berries without stint; and the 
l)nlfalo bushes, which are xieculiar to these northern regions, lined the banks of the 
ri ver and the defiles in the bluffs, sometimes for miles together, forming almost impass- 
able hedges, so loaded with the weight of their fruit that their boughs were seen 
everywhere gracefully IxMuling down or resting on the ground. This last shrub {Shep- 
hcnlia), whicli may be said to be the most beautiful ornament that decks out the wild 
})rairics, forms a striking contrast to the rest of the foliage, from the blue appear- 
ance of its leaves, by which it can be distinguished for miles in distance. The fruit 
which it produces in such incredible profusion, hanging in clusters to every limb 
and to every twig, is about the size of ordinary currants and not unlike them iu

iug facts relative to the food plants of our North American aborigines. 
Among tlie plants described by him there are a few which merit care- 
ful investigation. Against all of them, however, there lie the objec- 
tions mentioned before, namely : 

(1) The long time required for their improvement, and 

(2) The difficulty of making them accex)table to the comnumity, in- 
volving 

(3) The risk of total and mortifying failure. 

In the notes to this address the more prominent of these are enumer- 
ated. 

In 1854 the late Prof. Gray called attention to the remarkable rela 
tions which exist between the plants of Jajjan and those of our Eastern 
coast. You will remember that he not only proved that the plants of 
the two regions had a common origin, but also emphasized the fact that 
many species of the two countries are almost identical. It is to that 
country which has yielded us so many useful and beautiful plants that 
we turn for new vegetables to supplement our present food resources. 
One of these plants, namely, Stachys, has already been mentioned as 
rather promising. There are others which are worth examination and 
perhaps acquisition. 

One of the most convenient places for a preliminary examination of 
the vegetables of Japan is at the railroad stations on the longer lines, 
for instance, that running from Tokio to Kobe. For native consump- 
tion there are prepared luncheon boxes of two or three stories, pro- 
vided with the simple and yet embarrassing chopsticks. It is worth 
the shock it causes one's nerves to invest in these boxes and try the 
vegetable contents. The bits of fish, flesh, and fowl, which one finds 
therein can be easily separated and discarded, upon which there will 
remain a few delicacies. The pervading odor of the box is that of aro- 
matic vinegar. The generous portion of boiled rice is of excellent 
quality, with every grain well softened and distinct, and this without 
anything else would suffice for a tolerable meal. In the boxes which 
have fallen under my observation there were sundry boiled roots, shoots, 



color and even in flavor; being exceedingly acid, almost nnpalatable vmtil they are 
bitten by frost of autumn, when they are sweetened and their flavor delicious, hav- 
ing to the taste much the character of grapes, and I am almost to think would pro- 
duce excellent w4ne." (George Catlin's illustrations and manners, customs, and con- 
dition of the North American Ivdians, vol.i, p. 72.) 

For mucb relative to the food of our aborigines, especially of the western coast, 
consult the Native Ilaces of the Pacific States of North America, by H. H. Ban- 
croft (New York), 1875. The following, from vol. i, p. 538, indicates that inaccura- 
cies have crept into the -work : "From the earliest information we have of these 
nations" (the author is speaking of the New Mexicans), "they are known to have 
been tillers of the soil; and though the implements used and their methods of culti- 
vation were both simple and primitive, cotton, corn, wheat, beans, and many varie- 
ties of fruits which constituted their principal food were raised in abundance." 

Wheat was not grown on the American continent until after the landing of the 
first explorers. 



SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC BOTANY. 631 

and seeds wliicli were not recognizable by ine in their cooked form. 
Prof. Georgesou, formerly of Japan, has kindly identified some of 
these for me,* but he says, " There are doubtless many others used occa- 
sionally." 

One may find sliced lotus roots, roots of large burdock, lily bulbs, 
shoots of ginger, pickled green plums, beans of many sorts, boiled 
chestnuts, nuts of the gingko tree, i)ickled greens of various kinds, 
dried cucumbers, and several kinds of sea-weeds. Some of the leaves 
and roots are cooked in much the same manner as beet-roots and beet- 
leaves are by us, and tlie general effect is not unappetizing. The boiled 
shoots are suggestive of only the tougher ends of asparagus. On the 
whole, I do not look back on Japanese railway luncheons with any 
longing which would compel me to advocate the indiscriminate intro- 
duction of the constituent vegetables here. 

But when the same vegetables are served in native inns, under more 
favorable culinary conditions, without the flavor of vinegar and of the 
pine wood of the luncheon boxes, they appear to be worthy of a trial 
in our horticulture, and I therefore deal with one or two in greater 
detail. 

Prof. Georgeson, whose advantages for acquiring a knowledge of the 
useful plants of Japan have been unusually good, has placed me under 
great obligations by communicating certain facts regarding some of the 
more promising plants of Japan which are not now used here. It 
should be said that several of these plants have already attracted the 
notice of the Agricultural Department in this country. 

The soybean {Glycine hispida). This species is known here to some 
extent, but we do not have the early and best varieties. These beans 
replace meat in the diet of the common people. 

Mucuna {Mueima capitata) and Dolichos {Doliclios cultratus) are pole 
beans possessing merit. 

Dioscorea ; there are several varieties with palatable roots. Years 
ago one of these was spoken of by the late Dr. Graj' as ])Ossessing 
"excellent roots, if one could only dig them." 

Colocasia antiquorum has tuberous roots, which are nutritious. 

* Pickled daikon, the large radish, ofteu grated; giuger roots, Shoga; beans 
(Ghicine hispida), many kinds, and prepared in many ways; beans (Dolichos 
cultratus), cooked in rice and mixed with it; sliced Hasu, lotos roots; lily bulbs, 
boiled whole and the scales torn off as they are eaten; pickled green plums, (Ume- 
boshi) colored red in the pickle, by the leaves of Pcrilla arguta (,Shiso) ; sliced 
and dried cucumbers, Kiuri; pieces of Gobo — roots of Lappa major; Rakkio, 
bulbs of Allinni Bakcri, boiled in Shogu ; grated Wasabi, stem of Eutrema IVasahi; 
watercress, midzu-tagaraslii (not ofteu); also sometimes piekled geeeus of vari- 
ous kinds, and occasionally chestnut kernels boiled and mixed with a kind of sweet 
sauce; nut of the Ginkgo tree; several kinds of sea-weeds are also very commonly 
served with the riee. (Prof. C. C. Georgeson in letter.) 



632 SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OV ECONOMIC BOTANY. 

Conophallus Kotijak has a large bulbous root, which is sliced, dried, 
and beaten to a x^owder. It is an ingredient in cakes. 

Aralia cordata is cultivated for the shoots, and used as we use aspar- 
agus. 

(Enanthe stolonifera and Cryptotcenia Canadensis are palatable salad 
plants, the former being used also as greens. 

There is little hope, if any, that we shall obtain from the hotter cli- 
mates for our southern territory new species of merit. The native 
markets in the tropical cities like Colombo, Batavia, Singapore, and 
Saigon, are rich in fruits, but outside of the native plants bearing these 
nearly all the plants ajipear to be wholly in established lines of cultiva- 
tion, such, for instance, as members of the gourd and night-shade 
families. 

Before we leave the subject of our coming vegetables, it will be well 
to note a naive-caution enjoined by A^ilmorin in his work, Les Plantes 
Potageres* 

" Finally," he says, " we conclude the article devoted to each plant 
with a few remarks on the uses to which it may be applied and on the 
parts of the plants which are to be so used. In many cases such remarks 
may be looked upon as idle words, and yet it would sometimes have 
been useful to have them when new plants were cultivated by us for 
the first time. For instance, the giant edible burdock of Japan {Lappa 
edulis) was for a long time served up on our tables only as a wretchedly 
poor spinach, because people would cook the leaves, whereas, in its 
native country, it is only cultivated for its tender fleshy roots." 

I trust you are not discouraged at this outlook for our coming vege- 
tables. 

Two groups of improvable food-plants may be referred to before we 
pass to the next class, namely, edible fungi and the beverage i^lants. 
All botanists who have given attention to the matter agree with the 
late Dr. Curtis of North Carolina that we have in the unutilized mush- 
rooms an immense amount of available nutriment of a delicious quality. 
It is not imjDrobable that other fungi than our common " edible mush- 
room" will by and by be subjected to a careful selection. 

The principal beverage-plants, tea, coffee and chocolate, are all 
attracting the assiduous attention of cultivators. The first of these 
plants is extending its range at a marvelous rate of rapidity through 
India and Ceylon; the second is threatened by the pests which have 
almost exterminated it in Ceylon, but a new species, with crosses there- 
from, is j)romising to resist them successfully; the third, chocolate, is 
every year passing into lands farther from its original home. To these 
have been added the kola (of a value as yet not wholly determined), 
and others are to augment the short list.

in. — FRUITS. 

Kotaiiically speaking", the cereal jiraiii.s of which we have spoken are 
trne fruits, that is to say, are ripened ovaries, but for all i3ractical i)ur- 
})Oses they may be regarded as seeds. The fruits, of which mention is 
now to be made, are those commonly spoken of in our markets as fruits. 

First of all, attention must be (tailed to the extraordinary changes in 
the commercial relations of fruits by two direct causes: 

(1) The canning industry, and 

(2) Swift traus[)ortation by steamers and railroads. 

The effects of these two agencies are too well known to require more 
than this passing mention. By them the fruits of the best fruit-growing 
countries are carried to distant lands in quantities which surprise 
all who see the statistics for the first time. The ratio of increase is 
very startling. Take, for instance, the iigures given by Mr. Morris at 
the time of the great Coh)nial and Indian Exhibition, in London. Com- 
X)are double decades of years: 

1845 £886, 888 

1865 3, 185, 984 

1885 7,587,528 

In the Colonial Exhibition at Loudon, in 1886, fruits from the remote 
colonies were exhibited under conditions which proved that, before long, 
it may be possible to place such delicacies as the cherimoyer, the sweet- 
sop, rambutan, mango, and mangosteen at even our most northern sea- 
])orts. Furthermore, it seems to me likely that with an increase in our 
knowledge with regard to the microbes which produce decay, we may 
be able to protect the delicate fruits from injury for any reasonable 
jieriod. Methods which will sui)i)lement refrigeration are sure to come 
in the very near future, so that even in a country so vast as our own 
tlie most perishable fruits will be transported through its length and 
breadth witliout harm. 

The canning industry and swift transportation are likely to diminish 
zeal in searching for new fruits, since, as we have seen in the case of 
the cereals, we are prone to move in lines of least resistance and leave 
well emmgh alone. 

To what extent are our present fruits likely to be improved? Even 
those who have watched the improvement in the quality of some of our 
fruits, like oranges, can hardly realize how great has been the improve- 
ment witliin liistoric times in the character of (-ertain i)ears, api)les, and 
so on. 

Tlie term historic is used advisedly, for there are prehistoric fruits 
which might serve as a point of dei)arture in the consideration of the 
(piestion. In tlie ruins of the lake dwellings in Switzerland* charred 

*" Carbonized apples have beeu found at Wangen, sometimes whole, sometimes 
eut in two, or, more rarely, into four pieces and evidently (hied and put aside for 
winter use. - - - They are small :tnd generally resemble those which still grow 



634 SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC liOTANY. 

apples have been found, which are in some cases plainly of small size, 
hardly equalling ordinary crab-apples. But, as I)r. Sturtevant has 
shown, in certain directions there has been no marked change of type; 
the change is in quality. 

In comparing the earlier descriptions of fruits with modern accounts 
it is well to remember that the high standards by which fruits are now 
judged are of recent establishment. Fruits which would once have 
been esteemed excellent would to-day be passed by as unworthy of 
regard. 

It seems probable that the list of seedless fruits will be materially 
lengthened, provided our experimental horticulturists make use of the 
material at their command. The common fruits which have very few 
or no seeds are the banana, pineapple, and certain oranges. Others 
mentioned by Mr. Darwin as well known are the bread-fruit, pome- 
granate, azarole or Neapolitan medlar, and date palms. In comment- 
ing upon these fruits, Mr. Darwin* says that most horticulturists "look 
at the great size and anomalous development of the fruit as the cause 
and sterility as the result," but he holds the opj)osite view as more 
probable; that is, that the sterility, coming about gradually, leaves free 
for other growth the abundant supply of building material which the 
forming seed would otherwise have. He admits however that "there 
is an antagonism between the two forms of reproduction, by seeds and 
by buds, when either is carried to an extreme degree, which is inde- 
pendent of any incipient sterility." 

Most plant hybrids are relatively infertile, but by no means wholly 
sterile. With this sterility there is generally augmented vegetative 
vigor, as shown by Kageli. Partial or comxilete sterility and corre- 
vsponding luxuriance of root, stem, leaves, and flower may come about 
in other obscure ways, and such cases are familiar to botanists.t Now, 
it seems highly probable that either by hybridizing directed to this 
special end, or by careful selection of forms indicating this tendency to 
the correlated changes, we may succeed in obtaining important addi- 
tions to our seedless or nearly seedless plants. Whether the ultimate 
profit would be large enough to pay for the time and labor involved is 
a question which we need not enter into ; there appears to me no reason- 
able doubt that such efforts would be successful. There is no reason 
in the nature of things why we should not have strawberries without 
the so-called seeds, blackberries aud raspberries with only delicious 
pulp, and large grapes as free from seeds as the small ones which we 
call "currants," but which are really grapes from Corinth. 



wild in the Swiss forests ; at Eobenhausen, liowever, specimens have occurred which 
are of larger size and probably cultivated. No trace of the vine, the walnut, the 
cherry, or the damson has yet been met with, but stones of the wild plum and the 
Prmius padus have been found." Lubbock, loc. cit., p. 217.

SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OP^ ECONOMIC BOTANY. 635 

These and the eoreless apples and pears of the future, the stoueless 
cherries and plums, like the common fruits before mentioned, must be 
propagated by bud division, and be open to the tendency to dimin- 
ished strength said to be the consequence of continued bud pro])ag:a- 
tion. But this bridge need not be crossed until we come to it. Bananas 
hav^e been perpetuated in this way for many centuries, and pineapples 
since tlie discovery of ^Vmerica, so that the borrowed trouble alluded 
to is not threatening. First we must catch our seedless fruits. 

Which of our wild fruits are promising subjects for selection and cul- 
tivation 1 

Mr. (Jrozier, of Michigan, has pointed out* the direction in which 
this research may prove most profitable. He enumerates many of our 
small fruits and nuts which can be improved. 

Another of our most careful and successful horticulturists believes 
that the common blueberry and its allies are very suitable for this 
purpose and offer good material for experimenting. The sugar -plum, 
or so-called shad-bush, has been improved in many i^articulars, and 
others can be added to this list. 

But again we turn very naturally to Japan, the country from which 
our gardens have received many treasures. Keferring once more to 
Prof. Georgeson's studies,! we must mention the varieties of Japanese 
apples, pears, peaches, plums, cherries and persimmons. The persim- 
mons are already well known in some parts of our country under the 
name " kaki,'' and they will doubtless make rapid progress in popular 
favor. 

The following are iess familiar: 

Actiniflia argiita and roJuhilis, with delicious berries; 

^tdioifonia, an evergreen vine yielding a palatable fruit; 

Myrica rubra, a small tree with an acidulous juicy fruit; 

Ekvaf/nus nmheUut(t, with berries for preserves. 

The active and discriminating horticultural journals in America and 
Europe are alive to the possibilities of new Japanese fruits, and it can 
not be very long before our list is considerably increised. 

It is absolutely necessary to recollect that in most cases variations 
are slight. Dr. IMasters and Mr. Darwin have called attention to this 
and have adduced many illustrations, all of which show the necessity 
of extreme patience and caution. The general student curious in such 
matters can have hardly any task more instructive than the detection 
of the variations in such common i)lants as the blueberry, the wild 
cherry, or the like. It is an excellent jucparation for a practical study 
of the variations in our wild fruits suitable for selection. 

It was held by the late Dr. Gray that the variations in nature by 
which species have been evolved were led along useful lines, a view 



* American Garden, N. Y. 1890-'91.

which Mr, Darwin regretted he couhl not entertain. However this may 
be, all acknowledge that by the liand of the (cultivator variations can 
be led along- nselul lines; and furthermore the hand which selects must 
ui)hold them in their unequal strife. In other words, it is one thing to 
select a variety and another to assist it in maintaining' its hold u])on 
existence. Without the constant hel]> of the cultivator who selects the 
useful variety, there comes a reversion to the ordinary specific type 
which is fitted to cope with its surroundings. 

I think you can agree with me that the prospect for new fruits and 
for improvements in our established favorites is fairly good. 

IV. — TIMBERS ATs^D CABINET WOODS. 

Can we look for new timbers and cabinet woods? Comparatively few 
of those in common use are of recent introduction. Attem])ts have been 
made to bring into great prominence some of the excellent trees of India 
and Australia which furnish wood of much beauty and timber of the 
best quality. A large proportion of all the timbers of the South Seas 
are characterized by remarkable firmness of texture and high specific 
gravity.* The same is noticed in many of the woods of the Imlies. 
A few of the heavier and denser sorts, like jarrah, of West Australia, 
and sabicu, of the Caribbean Islands, have met with deserved favor in 
England, but the cost of transportation militates against them. It is 
a fair (luestion whether, in certain parts (►four country, these trees and 
others which can be utilized for veneers may not be cultivated to ad- 
vantage. Attention should be again called to the tact that many 
plants succeed far better in localities which are remote from their 
origin, but where they find conditions substantially like those which 
they have left. This fact, to which we nnist again refer in detail with 
regard to certain other classes of plants, may have some bearing upon 
the introduction of new timber trees. Certain drawbacks exist with 
regard to the timber of some of the more rapidly growing hard-wood 
trees which have prevented their taking a high i)lace in the scale of 
values in mechanical engineering". 

One of the most useful soft- wooded trees in the world is the kauri. 
It is restricted in its range to a comparatively small area in the North 
Island of New Zealand. It is now being cut down with a recklessness 
which is as prodigal and shameful as that which has marked our own 
treatment of forests here. It should be said however that this de- 
struction is under protest, in spite of which it would seejn to be a 
question of only a few years when the great kauri groves of New Zea- 
land will be a thing of the past. Our energetic forest department has 
on its hands problems just like this which perplexes one of the new 
lands of the south. The task in both cases is double, to preserve the 
old treasures and to bring in new. 



■ I'scfiil Xdtive I'lants of AuKiidlUt, by ,J. II. Maideu, Sydney. 



SOME OF thp: possibilities of economic botany. 637 

The energy shown by Baron von Mueller, the renowned Government 
botanist of Victoria, and by various forest departments, in encourag- 
ing the cultivation of timber trees will assuredly meet with success ; 
one can hardly hope tliat tliis success will api)ear fully demonstrated 
in the lifetime of those now living, but I can not think that many j-ears 
w'ill pass before the promoters of su(;h enterprises may take fresh 
courage. 

In a modest structure in the city of Sidney, New South Wales, Mr. 
Maiden* has brought together, under great ^lifliculties, a large collec- 
tion of the useful products of the vegetable kingdom as represented 
in Australia. It is impossible to look at the collection of woods in that 
museum or at the similar and more showy one in Kew, without believ- 
ing that the field of forest culture must receive rich njaterial from the 
Southern Hemisphere. 

Before leaving this part of our subject, it may be well to take some 
illustrations in passing, to show how important is the influence exerted 
upon the utilization of vegetable i)roducts by causes which may at first 
strike one as being rather remote: 

(1) Photography makes use of the effect of light on chromatized 
gelatin to produce under a negative the basis of relief plates for en- 
graving. The degree of excellence reached in modilications of this 
simple device has distim-tly threatened the very existence of wood en- 
graving, and hence follows a diminished degree of interest in box- 
wood and its substitutes. 

(2) Iron, and in its turn steel, is used in .shipbuilding, and this ren- 
ders of greatly diminished interest all questions which concern the 
choice of different oaks, and similar woods. 

(3) But on the other hand there is increased activity in certain di- 
rections, best illustrated by the extraordinary development of the 
chemical methods for manufiicturiug wood pulp. By the improved 
processes, strong libers suitable for fine felting on the screen and fit 
for the best grades of certain lines of paper are given to us from rather 
inferior sorts of -wood. lie would be a rash prophet who should venture 
to i)redict Avhiit will be the future of this wonderful industry, but it is 
plain that the time is not far distant wiien acres noM- worthless may be 
covered by trees under cultivation, growing for the pulp-maker. 

There is no department of economic botany more promising in im- 
mediate results than that of arboriculture. 

A', — VEGETABLE FIBERS. 

The vegetable fibers known to commerce are either plant hairs, of 
which we take cotton as the type, or filaments of bast-tissue, repre- 
sented by flax. Xo new plant hairs have been suggested which can 
compete in any way for spinning with those yielded by the species of 

* Us^ul Native Plants of Australia. 



638 SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC BOTANY. 

gossypium, or cotton, but experiments more or less systematic and 
tliorougli are being carried on with regard to the improvement of the 
varieties of the species. Plant hairs for the stuftlng of cushions and 
pillows need not be referred to in connection with this subject. 

Countless sorts of plants have been suggested as sources of good 
bast-fibers for spinning and for cordage, and many of these make capital 
substitutes for those already in the factories, but the questions of cheap- 
ness of production, and of subsequent preparation for use, have thus far 
militated against succes^. There may l)e much difference between the 
profits promised by a laboratory experiment and those resulting from 
the same process conducted on a commercial scale. The existence of 
such difference has been the rock on which many enterprises seeking to 
iutrodu(;e new fibers have been wrecked. 

In dismissing this portion of our subject, it may be said that a proc- 
ess for separating fine fibers from undesirable structural elements, and 
from resin-like substances which accompany them, is a great desidera- 
tum. If this were supplied many new species would assume great 
prominence at once. 

VI. — TANNINd MATERIALS. 

What new tanning materials can be confidently sought for"? In his 
Useful Native Plants of Australia, Mr. Maiden describes over thirty 
species of "Wattles" or Acacias, and about half as many Eucalypts, 
which have been examined for the amount of tanning material contained 
in the bark. In all, eighty seven Australian species have been under 
examination. Besides this, much has been done looking in the same 
direction, at the suggestion and under the direction of Baron von 
Mueller, of Victoria. This serves to indicate how great is the interest in 
this subject and how wide is the field in our own country for the intro- 
duction of new tanning plants. 

It seems highly probable however that artificial tanning substances 
will at no distant day replace the crude matters now employed. 

VII. — RESINS, ETC. 

Resins, oils, gums, and medicines from tlie vegetable kingdom would 
next engage our attention if they did not seem rather too technical for 
this occasion and to possess an interest on the whole somewhat too 
limited, but an allied substance may serve to represent this class of 
products and indicate the drift of present research. 

India Rtihhcr* — Under this term are included numerous substances 
which possess a physical and chemical resemblance to each other. An 
Indian Ficus, the early source of supply, soon became inadequate to 
furnish the quantity used in the arts even when the manipulation of 
rubber was almost unknown. Later, supplies came from Hevea of

Brazil, generally known as Para rubber, and from Castilloa, sometimes 
called Central American Eubber, and from Manihot GlaziovH Ceara 
rubber. Not only are these plants now successfully cultivated in ex 
periniental gardens in tlie tropics, but many other rubber-yielding 
species have l)een added to the list. The Landolphias are among the 
most promising of the whole: these are the African rubbers. Now in 
addition to these which are the chief sonrce of supjily, Me have Wit- 
Ivghhcia, from the IMalayan Teninsnla, Leueonotis, Chilocarjius, Alsto- 
)ua, Forsteronia, iu\d a species of a genus formerly known as Urostigma, 
but now united with Ficun. These names, which have little signifi- 
cance as they are here lu'ouounced in j)assing, are given now merely to 
imi)ress upon our minds the fact that the sources of a single commer- 
cial article may be exceedingly diverse. Under these circumstances 
search is being made not only for the best varieties of these species 
but for new species as well. 

There are few excursions in the tiopics which possess greater inter- 
est to a botanist who tares for the industrial aspects of ]dantsthan the 
walks through the gardens at Buitenzorg in Java and at Singapore. 
At both these stations the experimental gardens lie at some distance 
li'om the great gardens which the tourist is expected to visit, but the 
exertion well repays him for all discomfort. Under tlie almost vertical 
rays of the sun, are here gathered the rubber-yielding plants from dif- 
ferent countries, all growing under conditions favorable for decisions 
as to their relative value. At Buitenzorg a well-equipped laboratory 
stands leady to answer practical questions as to quality and compo- 
sition of their products, and year by year the search extends. 

I mention this not as an isolated cxami)le of what is being accom- 
plished in commercial botany, but as a fair illustration of the thor- 
oughness with which the i)roblems are being attacked. It should be 
further stated that at the garden in question assiduous students of the 
subject are eagerly welcomed and are provided with all needed appli- 
ances for carrying on technical, chemical, and pharmaceutical investi- 
gations. Therefore lam justified in saying that there is every reason 
for believing that in the very near future new sources of our mOvSt im- 
portant products will be opened up and new areas placed under suc- 
cessful cultivation. 

At this point attention must be called to a very modest and con- 
venient handbook on the Commercial Botany of the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury by Mr. Jackson of the Botanical Museum attached to the iloyal 
Gardens, Kew, which not only embodies a great amount of well-arranged 
information relative to the ncAv useful i)lants, but is at the same time 
a record of the existing state of things in all these departments of 
activity. 



640 SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC BOTANY. 
YIII. — FEAGRAI^T PLANTS. 

Anotlier illustration of our subject might be drawn Irom a class of 
plants wMcli repays close study from a biological point of view, namely, 
those which yield perfumes. 

In speaking of the future of our fragrant plants we must distinguish 
between those of commercial value and those of purely horticultural 
interest. The former'will be less and less cultivated in proportion as 
synthetic chemistry by its manufacture of i^erfumes replaces the natu- 
ral by the artificial products, for example, coumariu, vanillin, neroliu, 
heliotropin, and even oil of wintergreen. 

But do not understand me as intimating that chemistry can ever 
furnish substitutes for living fragrant plants. Our gardens will always 
be sweetened by them, and the possibilities in this direction will con- 
tinue to extend both by contributions from abroad and by improve- 
ment in our present cultivated varieties. Among the foreign acquisi- 
tions there are the fragrant species of Andropogon. Who would susjiect 
that the troi^ical relatives of our sand-loving grasses are of high com- 
mercial value as sources of perfumery oils ? 

The utility to the plant of fragrance in the flower and the relation of 
this to crosa-fertilization, are apparent to even a casual observer. But 
the fragrance of an aromatic leaf does not always give us the reason 
for its being. 

It has been suggested for certain cases that the volatile oils escaping 
from the j^lants in question may, by absorption, exert a direct influence 
ill mitigating the fierceness of action of the sun's rays. Other explana- 
tions have also been made, some of which are even more fanciful than 
the last. 

When however one has seen that the aromatic plants of Australia 
are almost free from attacks of insects and fungi, and has learned to 
look on the impregnating substances in some cases as j)rotective against 
predatory insects and small foes of all kinds, and in others as fungi- 
cidal, he is tempted to ask whether all the substances of marked odor 
which we find in certain groui)s of plants may not play a similar role. 

It is a fact of great interest to the surgeon that in many plants there 
is associated with the fragrant principle a marked antiseptic or fungi- 
(ddal quality; conspicuous examples of this are afforded by species of 
Eucalyptus, yielding eucalyptol, Styranc, yielding styrone, Thymus yield- 
ing thymol. It is interesting to note too that some of these most 
modern antiseptics were important constituents in the balsamic vul- 
ueraries of the earliest surgery. 

IX. — florists' PLANTS. 

Florists' i)lants and the floral fashions of the future constitute an en- 
gaging subject which we can touch only lightly. It is reasonably clear 
that while the old favorite species will hold their ground in the guise 



SOME OF THE POiSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC BOTANY. 641 

of improved varieties, the new introductions will come in the shape of 
plants with flowering branches Avhich retain their blossoms for a some- 
what long i)eriod, and especially those in which the flowers i)recede the 
leaves, lu short the next real fashion in our gardens is probably to be 
the flowering shurb and flowering tree, like those which are such favor- ' 
ites in the country from which the Western world has gladly taken the 
gift of the chrysanthemum.* 

Twice each year of latt; a reception has been held by the Emperor 
and Empress of Japan. The receptions are in autumn and in the 
si)ring. That in the autumn, popularly know as the Emperor's recep- 
tion, has for its floral decorations the myriad forms of the national flower, 
t\\v, chrysanthejnum ; thiit which is given in spring, the Empress's recep- 
tion, comes when the cherry blossoms are at their best. One has little 
idea of the wealth of beauty in masses of flowering shurbs and trees, 
until he has seen the floral displays in the Imperial Gardens and the 
Temple grounds in Tokio. 

To Japaut and China also we are indebted for many of the choicest 
l)lants of our gardens, but the supply of species is by no means ex- 
hausted. By far the larger number of the desirable plants have al- 
ready found their way into the hands of cultivators, but often under 
conditions which have restricted their dissemination through the flower- 
loving community. There are many which ought to be widely known, 
especially the fascinating dwarf shrubs and dwarf trees of the far East, 
.vhich are sure to find sooner or later a warm welcome among us. 

X. — FORAGE PLANTS. 

Next to the food plants for man, there is no single class of commer- 
cial i)lnnts of greater interest than the food-plants for flocks and herds. 
Forage plants, wild and cultivated, are among the most important and 
highly valued resources of vast areas. No single question is of more 
vital consequence to our farthest West and Southwest. 

It so happens that the plants on which the pastoralist relies grow 
or are grown on soil of inferior value to the agriculturist. Even soil 
which is almost sterile may jmssess vegetation on which flocks and 
herds may graze, and further, these animals may thrive in districts 
where the vegetation appears at first sight too scanty or too forbidding 
even, to support life. There are immense districts in ])artsof the Aus- 
tralian «*ontinent wliere flocks are kept on plants so dry and desert-

like that an inexperienced person would pass them by as not fit for 
his sheep; and yet, as Mr. Samuel Dixon* has well shown, these plants 
are of high nutritive value and are attractive to Hocks. 

Relegating to the foot-notes, brief descriptions of a few of the fodder 
plants suggested for use in dry districts, I shall now mention the salt 
bushes of various sorts, and the allied desert plants of Australia as 
worth a^ careful trial on some of our very dry regions in the farthest 
west. There are numerous other excellent fodder plants adapted to dry 
but not parched areas which can be brought in from the corresponding 
districts of the southern hemisphere and from the East. 

At an earlier stage of this address,t I have had occasion to refer to 
Baron Von Mueller, whose efforts looking towards the introduction of 
useful plants into Australasia have been aided largely by his convenient 
treatise on economic plants. It may be said in connection with the 
fodder plants, especially, that much which the Baron has written can 
be applied mutatis mutandis to parts of our own country. 

The important subject of introducing fodder plants has been purposely 
reserved to the last because it permits us to examine a practical point 
of great interest. This is the caution which it is thought necessary 
to exercise when a species is transferred by our own choice from one 
country to another. I say, by our choice, for whether we wish it or not 
certain plants Avill introduce themselves. In these days of frequent 
and intimate inter-comnninication between different countries the exclu- 
sion of foreign plants is simply impossible. Oar common weeds are 
striking illustrations of the readiness with which plants of one country

tricts of Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado (1886), Grasses of the South (1887).

make for tbouiselves a home in another. * All but two of the prominent 
weeds of tbe Eastern States are foreijjn intruders. 

There are all grades of i)ersisten('e in these immigrants. Near the 
ballast grounds of every harbor, or the tields elose by woolen and paper 
mills where foreign stock is used, you will observe many foreign plants 
which have been introduced by seed. For many of these you will 
search in vain a second year. A few others persist for a year or two 
longer, but with uncertain tenure of the laud which they have invaded; 
others still have come to stay. But happily some of the intruders which 
seem at tirst to gain a lirm foothold, lose their ground after a while. 
We have a conspicuous example of this in a hawk- weed, which was very 
threatening in New England two years ago, but is now relaxing itshold. 

Another illustration is afforded by a water plant which we have 
given to the Old World. This plant, called in our botanies Anacharis, 
or Elodea, is so far as 1 am aware not troublesome in our ponds and 
water ways, but when it was carried to England, perhaps as a plant 
for the aquarium, it was thrown into streams and rivers with a free 
hand. It spread with remarkable rapidity and became such an unmit- 
igated nuisance that it was called a curse. Efl'orts to extirpate it 
merely increased its rate of growth. Its days of mischief are how- 
ever nearly over, or seem to be drawing to a dose, at least so Mr. 
Lynch, of the Botanic Garden in Cambridge, England, and others of 
my informants think. The history of the plant shows that even under 
conditions which so far as we can see, are identical with those under 
which the plant grew in its home, it may tor a time take a fresh lease 
of life and thrive with an undrcamed-of energy. 

What did Anacliaris tind in the waters of England and theconthient 
that it did not have at home, and why should its energy begin to wane 
now? 

In Australasia one of the most striking of these intruders is sweet- 
briar. Introduced as a hedge plant it has run over certain lands like 
a weed, and disi)utes excry acre of some arable plats. From the fa- 
cility with which it is propagated, it is almost ineradicable. There is 
s<miething ast<mnding in the manner in which it gains and holds its 
ground. Clorse and brambles and thistles are trimblesome in some 
localities, and they prove much less easy to control than in Europe. 
The ertect produced on the mind of the colonist by these intruding 
l)ests is everywhere the same. Whenever in an examination of the 
plants likely to be worthy of trial in our American dry lands the sub- 
ject was mentioned by me to Australians, I was always enjoined to be

cautious as to what plants I might suggest for introduction from their 
country into our onyu. My good friends insisted that it was bad 
enough to have as pests the phmts which come in without our phmning 
or choice, and this caution seems to me one which should not be 
forgotten. 

It would take us too far from our path to inquire what can be the 
l)0ssible reasons for such increase of vigor and fertility in plants which 
are transferred to a new home. We should have to examine all the 
suggestions which have been made, such as fresh soil, new skies, 
more efticient animal friends or less destructive enemies. We should 
be obliged also to see whether the possible wearing out of the energy 
of some of these plants after a time might not be attributable to the 
decadence of vigor through uninteirupted bud propagation, and we 
should have to allude to many other questions allied to these. But for 
this time fails. 

Lack of time also renders it impossible to deal with the questions 
which attach themselves to our main question, especially as to the 
limits of effect which cultivation may produce. We can not touch the 
problem of inheritance of acquired peculiarities, or the manner in which 
cultivation predisposes the plant to innumerable modifications. Two 
of these modifications may be mentioned in passing, because they serve 
to exemplify the practical character of our subject. 

Cultivation brings about in plants very curious morphological 
changes. For example, in the case of a well-known vegetable, the num ■ 
ber of metamorphosed type leaves forming the ovary is two, and yet 
under cultivation the number increases irregularly until the full num- 
ber of units in the type of the flower is reached. Prof. Bailey, of Cor- 
nell, has called attention to some further interesting changes in the 
tomato, but the one mentioned sufifices to illustrate the direction of 
variation which plants under cultivation are apt to take. Monstrosi- 
ties are very apt to occur in cultivated plants, and under certain condi- 
tions may be perpetuated in succeeding generations, thus widening the 
field from which utilizable plants may be taken. 

Another case of change produced by cultivation is likewise as yet 
wholly unexplained, although much studied, namely, the mutual inter- 
action of scion and stock in grafting, budding, and the like. It is 
probable that a further investigation of this subject may yet throw 
light on new possibilities in plants. 

We have now arrived at the most practical question of all, namely, 

In what way can the range of commercial botany be extended? In 
what manner or by what means can the introduction of new species be 
hastened? 

It is possible that some of you are aware of the great amount of 
uncoordinated work which has been done and is now in hand in the 
direction of bringing in new plants. 



SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC BOTANY. 645 

The competition hetween the importers of new plants is so great 
both in tlie Okl World and the New that a very large proportion of 
the species which wonld natnrally commend themselves for the use of 
florists, for the adornment of greenhouses, or for commercial ends, 
have been at one time or another brought before the public, or are be- 
ing accumulated in stock. The same is true, although to a less extent, 
with regard to useful vegetables and fruit. Hardly one of those which 
we can suggest as desirable for trial has not already been investigated 
in Enrope or this country and reported on. The pages of our chemi- 
cal, pharmaceutical, medical, horticultural, agricultural, and trade 
Jimrnals, especially those of high grade, contain a wealth of material 
of this character. 

But what is needed is this, that the promising plants should be sys- 
tematically investigated under exhaustive conditions. It is not enough 
that an enthusiast here or an amateur there should give a plant a trial 
under imperfectly understood conditions and then report success or 
failure. The work should be thorough and every question answered 
categorically, so that we might be i»laced in possession of all the facts 
relative to the object experimented upon. But such an undertakino" 
requires the co-operation of many different agencies. I shall venture 
to mention some of these. 

In the first place, botanic gardens amply endowed for research. 
The Arnold Arboretum, the Shaw Garden, and the Washington Exper- 
imental Garden are American illustrations of what is needed for this 
purpose. University gardens have their place in instruction, but can 
not wisely undertake this kind of work. 

In the second place, nuiseums and laboratories of economic bot- 
any. ]\ruch good work in this direction has been done in this country 
by the National Museum and by the department in charge* of the inves- 
tigation of new plants. We need institutions like those at Kew in 
ICngland, and at Buitenzorg in Java, which keep in close touch with 
all the world. The founding of an establishment on a scale of magni- 
tude commensurate with the greatness and needs of onr country is an 
undertaking which waits for some one of our wealth}- men. 

In the third ])lace, experimental stations. These may, within the 
pro|)er limits of their sphere of act ion, extend the study of plants beyond 
the established varieties to the species, and beyond the species to 
equivalent species in other genera. It is a matter of regret that so 
much of the energy displayed in these stations in this country, and we 
may say abroad, has not been more economically directed. 

Great economy of energy must result from the recent change by 
which coordination of action is assured. The influence which the sta- 
ti(ms must exert on the welfare of our country and the development of 
its resources is incalculable. 



' The list of econoniif plants puhlislipd l)y the Department in Washington is re- 
markably full, and is in every way creditable to those in charge. 



646 SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC BOTANY. 

In the last place, but by no means least, tlie co-operation of all who 
are interested in scientific matters, through their observation of isolated 
and associated phenomena connected with plants of supposed utility, 
and by the cultivation of such plants by private individuals, uncon- 
nected with any State, governmental, or academic institutions. 

By these agencies, wisely directed and energetically employed, the 
domains of commercial and industrial botany will be enlarged. To 
some of the possible results in these domains 1 have endeavored to call 
your attention. 



THE EVOLUTION OF COMMERCE.* 



By Gardiner G. Hubbard. 



For over three thoiisaiul years the great liighway for commeree has 
been IVom India by the Persian (hilf and tlie Euplirates or by tlie Ited 
Sea to the Mediterranean, and thence through the Mediterranean by 
Gibraltar to western and northern Europe, and in our day theuee to 
America. 

Along this route cities and nations have sprung up, increased in 
wealth and power, and passed away, giving place to other cities and 
nations Inrtber westward. These nations have been great carriers and 
distributors of minerals and goods, as well as capitalists and bankers, 
or carriers, bankers, and manufacturers; in either case controlling the 
commerce of the world. This control has never for any long period 
been held by the same race, but has passed from one nation toanotlier, 
always from the east toward the west. 

The earliest highway of commerce was from India thiough the Per- 
sian Gulf, up the Euphrates to the Mediterranean; and carpets and 
precious stones were then as now carried over this route. Explora- 
tions and surveys for a railroad have been recently made along this 
'•our future highway to India."' Caravans brought s|)ices from Ar:il»ia 
and rich stutfs from Babylon and Nineveh to the shore of the Red 8ea. 
Solomon made a navy of shi]is and Hiram sent in the navy his 
'^ Servants, slii])men that had knowledge of the sea, and they bronght 
gold from Ojjhir, great i>Ienty of almug trees, and [U'ecious stones." 

Tyre and Sidon founded colonies on the shores of the Mediterranean, 
enslaving the S[)aniards and ci>m[)elling them to work tlie mines of 
gold and silver already opened in Spain. Their shii>s sailed through 
the Mediterranean, by the Pillars of Hercules, into the Atlantic Ocean, 
turning northward to England for tin and co])])er and on into the Bal- 
tic sea for furs and amber, turning southward along the western coast 
of Africa, passing certainly 2,000 miles to the e(iuator, and i)robably 
rounding the Cai)e of CJood Hope into the Indian Ocean. J'roducts 
from the west were brought in ships to Tyre and Sidon and exchanged

for the goods of the east, their merchants luakiug i)rofits on each trans- 
action both as mercliants and as carriers. Tyre and Sidon became 
wealthy, hixnrious, and effeminate. Some of their citizens saw in 
Africa a richer soil and a better situation for a large city, and founded 
(■arthage. The Carthagenians inherited the trade of Tyre and Sidon, 
and in addition opened highways to Egypt and into the interior of 
Africa, bartering their wares in Egypt for corn and grain, and in Africa 
for ivory, gems, and slaves. They planted colonies in Africa and 
Sicily, and for a time were successful rivals of Greece and Rome. 

The rule of the ocean transferred from Asia to Africa remained there 
but a short time, for the day of Europe came with the rise of Greece 
and Rome. 

The Greeks founded colonies in Asia Minor, Sicily, and Italy. The 
ruins of great cities with Grecian temples and amphitheaters are found 
at Girgenti and Syracuse in Sicily, at Pa^stum and other places in 
Italy. Under Pyrrhus, their armies were defeated by the Romans 
and her colonies captured. Deprived of these, her power rapidly de 
clined and she became a Roman province. 

Borne. — Rome founded few colonies, but she conquered the nations of 
Asia, Africa, and Europe, and brought under her sway cities, king- 
doms, and empires. She boasted of 500 cities in her Asiatic province 
that had been ibunded or enlarged and beautified by the Csesars. One 
hundred and twenty vessels each year l)rought the goods of India from 
the delta of the Ganges, and large tieets from Egypt came laden with 
corn and grain. She imported from every country, but exported little, 
paying for her imports by taxes levied on her colonists. 

Rome was the first power to incorporate conquered states into her 
dominion and extend citizenship to all the people in her Empire, so that 
Paul could say in truth, '^ I am a Roman citizen and to Otpsar I appeal." 
So salutary and beneficial was her rule that under it these countries 
prospered more than under their own rulers. What Rome seized with 
strong hand she defended, and in return for taxation gave protection. 
She has no more enduring monument than her roads, the remains of 
which are now found in every country of Europe. Though built as 
military and post roads, they were used largely for commerce. All 
started from the golden mile-stone in the forum ; one ran over the Bren- 
ner pass northeastward to the Baltic Sea, another followed the north- 
western coast of the Mediterranean to Spain and southern France, 
another crossed the Alps and extended through France to the British 
chanuel and through England to Scotland, where the Romans built a 
wall, ruins of which now bear witness to its strength. Another way 
went southward to Naples and Brindisi, and another led eastward to 
Macedonia and Greece. As these were the only roads in all these coun- 
tries, it was truly said, "All ways lead to Rome;" and over them the 
messenger of Ca'sar travelled more rapidly than the mail-carrier of 
our fathers on our mail routes. 



THE EVOLUTION OF COMMERCE. 649 

Venlee and Genoa. — After 500 years of empire Rome fell, and the 
dark ages followed. From a. d. 400 to A. D. 800 eoinmeree and 
trade died out. The only vessels on the Mediterranean and Baltic, 
were piratical crafts; Jerusalem and th(» Holy Land were captured by 
the Turks; the Crusades began, forerunners of a higher civilization and 
more extended commerce. Thousands and tens of thousands of people 
from all parts of Europe and all ranks of life, bearing the pilgrim's 
badge — the blood-red cross— journeyed toward the lloly Laud, first in 
vast crowds led by Peter the Ilermit, then in great armies led by kings 
and generals. For years this movement continued. Venice and 
Genoa furnished ships to carry tlie armies of h'rance from Italy 
to the Holy Jjand. The Venetians were shrewd merchants and drove 
hard bargains, stipulating for cessions of land at the best com- 
mercial points and adccpiate compensation for tlieir services. After 
the failure of each Crusade they brought back remnants of the troops 
and pilgrims, and with them the x)roducts of Asia ^Miiior, and books 
and art treasures from Greece. These were distributed all over Italy, 
and led to the renaissance of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. 

The trade with the east brought power and Avealth to Venice and 
Genoa. They founded colonies on the lilack Sea, in Asia Elinor, and 
on the Asiatic coast. Venice alone had 3,000 vessels. Their com- 
merce was not contiued to the borders of the Mediterranean, for the 
goods of the Orient were distributed by the way of Augsburg and 
Nuremberg to the interior of (xermany and to the towns of the 
Hanseatic confederation. Thus commerce was opened with the in- 
terior of Europe. 

By the failure of the Crusades the power of the Turks, which had 
been for some time checked, grew and increased. They conquered the 
holy places of the earth, Asia Minor and Syria, and finally, crossing 
into Europe, gained (Constantinople. The colonies of Venice and Genoa 
were captured ; their fleets disappeared from the jMediterrancan. In 
western Europe the Spaniards under Ferdinand and Isabella con- 
(piered the Moors, who for many ages had occupied the larger portion 
of Spain; and as the Crescent appeared in eastern I'hirope the Cross 
triumphed in the west. 

Spain (tnd Portugal. — Tiien a new ])(>W('r api)eared u])(»n the stage. 
S])ain and Portugal entered upon an era of exploration and discovery 
in regions unknown to Venice and Genoa. Commerce, which in the 
middle ages had been confined to the Mediterranean Sea, was now ex- 
tended to the countries on the Atlantic Ocean, and the Cape Verde 
Islands, Madeira, and the Canaries were discovered. In one genera- 
tion (between 1470 and 1500 a. d.) mo:e and greater discoveries were 
made than in any other period of the world's history. The Portuguese 
sailed along the eastern coast of Africa and rounded the Cape of Good 
Hope; Vasco de Gama crossed the Indian Ocean to India; Columbus

sailed westward to find tlie Orient aud discovered a new world; Ma- 
gellan circum-navigated the globe; Balboa crossed the Isthmus of 
Panama, and was the first to see, on the same day, the sun rise out of 
the Atlantic and set in the Pacific; and soon the eastern and western 
coasts of America were explored from Newfoundland to Cape Horn 
and from Cape Horn to Panama. 

Both Portugal and Spain claimed all the New World, and as they 
could not agree upon a division of territory they referred the matter 
to the Pope, who divided the New World between them. The Atlantic 
became the great highway for commerce, while the Mediterranean was 
deserted, and Venice and Genoa existed only in the past. 

The commerce of Portugal was co-extensive with her dominion, which 
extended from Japan and the Spice Islands and India to the Eed Sea, 
thence to the Cape of Good Hope; and with their possessions on the 
eastern and western shores of the Atlantic and in Africa and Brazil 
completed their maritime emj)ire, the most extensive the world has ever 
seen. Then a single fleet of one hundred and fifty to two hundred and 
fifty caracks sailed from the port of Goato Lisbon; now there sails but 
one vessel a year from all India. 

From Spain ships sailed both to the Caribbean Sea and to Cape Horn 
and thence to Chile and Peru, or directly northwestward from Cape 
Horn to the Philipi)ine Islands. Spain conquered Mexico, Central 
America, and all South America except Brazil. The gold and silver of 
Peru and Chile, and the goods of the Orient, were brought to Spain and 
Portugal. As their wealth and power increased the spirit of explora- 
tion decreased, and for nearly two hundred years the Spanish ships 
sailed in a fixed course by the same lanes, exploring the ocean neither 
toward the north nor the south, leaving undiscovered the great conti 
nent of Australia and numerous groups of islands. 

The Spanish and Portuguese leaders were cavaliers, who despised all 
commerce excepting in gold and silver, all kinds of manufactures, all 
manual labor, and the cultivation of the ground. They came not to 
colonize, but to satisfy by the labor of the enslaved aborigines their 
thirst for gold and silver. The whole political power was retained by 
the King of Spain and administered by Spaniards. While the silver 
aud gold of America and the wealth of the Indies poured into the 
treasuries of Spain they wanted nothing more. Like ancient Rome, 
they took all the wealth of the conquered countries, making no return; 
but they did not, like Rome, give wise and equitable laws and a stable 
government to the countries they conquered. 

The Netherlands. — The inhabitants of the Netherlands were manu- 
facturers, and supplied the markets of Spain and Portugal and their 
colonies, thus reaping as large profits from their trade with these coun- 
tries as the Spanish and Portuguese from the mines of gold and silver. 

No part of Europe, says Motley, seemed so unlikely to become the 
home of a great nation as the low country on the northwestern coast 



THE EVOLUTION OF COMMERCE. 651 

of the continent, where the great rivers, the Kliine and Scheldt, emp- 
tied into the North Sea, and where it was hard to tell whether it was 
land or water. In this region, ontcast of ocean and earth, a little nation 
wrested from both domains their richest treasures. 

The commerce of the Hanseatic Towns, which had depended for their 
trade on Venice and Genoa, became less and less as the glory of those 
cities waned. Antwerp, with its deep and convenient rivers, stretched 
its arms to the ocean and caught the golden harvest as it fell from its 
sisters' grasp. No city except Paris surpassed it in population; none 
approached it in splendor. Tt became the commercial center aiul banker 
of Europe; 5,000 merchants daily assembled on its excluinge; 2,500 
vessels were often seen at once in its harbor, and 500 daily made their 
entrance into it. The manufactures of Flanders and the Netherlands 
had been noted for many generations, and now vastly increased, were 
distributed all over the world. The Netherlands, though the small- 
est, became the wealthiest nation of Europe. Then came the long-con- 
tinued war with Spain, ending in the siege and fall of Antwerp, and in 
the imposition of such taxation as no other country had ever endured. 
As Antwerp had grown on the ruins of the Hanseatic Towns, so her fall 
became England's gain. 

France and England. — In America, north of Mexico, neither silver nor 
gold had been found to tempt the Spanish and Portuguese. The larger 
portion of the northern Atlantic coast was one long sand ))each, broken 
by great estuaries and the mouths of great rivers; the rest was rocky 
and rugged, the temperature generally cold, thi" land unfertile and 
barren. For these reasons North America was left to the French and 
English. The French claimed Canada and the whole of the territory 
of the ITnited States save a narrow strip of land on the Atlantic coast. 
The French population was small, and was made up principally of fur- 
traders and half-breeds; Great Britain held New England, Virginia, 
and the Oarolinas. 

After the first fever of religious colonization had i)assed, about the 
commencement of the eighteenth century, there was scarcely any emi- 
gration from England to America and but little trade between the two 
counti'ies. The population of North America was small, its commerce 
less, with little profit to the European merchants. The country pos- 
sessed no i)eculiar advantages for the production of articles of value 
in foreign markets; there was nothing, therefore, to invite immigration 
or commerce. 

The chief inducement to the English to navigate the Atlantic was 
the hope of capturing the treasure laden Spanish galleons and the rich 
Spanish cities. 

Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh, and other navigators, aided 
by Queen Elizabeth, with bands of buccaneers, refugees from all coun- 
tries, though mostly Englishmen, explored the recesses of the Carib- 
bean Sea, crossed the Isthmus of Panama, and launched their little 



652 THE EVOLUTION OF COMMERCE. 

vessels on the Pacific. In 15 years they captured 545 treasure ships, 
sacked many towns, trained the English seaman, and laid the founda- 
tion for the navy of Great Britain. 

The growth of English commerce was slower than that of Spain, 
Portugal, or Holland, and it was not until the middle of the eighteenth 
century, or 250 years after the discovery of America, that she entered 
upon that career which gave her the control of the ocean. Her com- 
merce was built up by protective laws, founded on the navigation act 
of 1651, which prohibited foreign vessels from carrying to or from 
England the commerce of any country but its own. These laws were 
universally regarded as among the chief causes and most important 
bulwarks of the i^rosperity of Great Britain, and they were continued 
until English ships controlled the carrying trade of the world, and 
were not finally repealed until 1854. 

The mechanical devices of Watt, Arkwright, and other great invent- 
ors gave to England that supremacy in manufactures which she has 
ever since retained. The French revolution, a little later, aroused the 
fear of the statesmen, merchants, and capitalists of England that the 
energy of the new Republic would be as omnipotent in mercantile affairs 
as on the field of battle. They believed that France might regain the 
colonies and with them the commerce she had lost, and therefore Eng- 
land declared war against Napoleon, which was carried on almost con- 
tinuously from ] 793 to 1815. The shipping of the Continent disa])peared 
or was captured by the fleets of England; the colonies, and with them 
the commerce, of Spain and Portugal, Holland aud France, passed to 
England; and though she is still burdened with the debt then created, 
she has never lost the commerce and carrying trade she then obtained. 

The poijulation of the colonies of Great Britain is about one sixth of 
the entire population of the globe, and their territory comprises eighty 
per cent of the available temperate regions of the earth belonging to 
the Anglo Saxon race. 

The commerce of England has given wealth to her bankers and mer- 
chants, and employment to her artisans, ship-builders, iron-workers, 
miners, and manufacturers. Her exports of produce and manufactures 
have increased 500 per cent in fifty years, or from $356,000,000 in 1840 
to $1,577,000,000 in 1800, and are carried by her ships to every quarter 
of the globe. Though dependent on America for her food supplies, 
these are moved in British ships. The commerce of the world pays 
tribute to the bankers of London and makes that city the money center 
of the world. Her best market is India, and from India comes her 
largest imports; next to this, those from the United States. 

India. — Egypt, Nineveh, and Babylon in prehistoric times. Tyre and 
Sidon and Greece under Alexander, Carthage and Rome under the 
Caesars, Venice and Genoa in the middle ages, Portugal and Holland, 
and lastly England, have drawn great stores of wealth from India. 



THE EVOLUTION OF COMMERCE. 653 

From India science and literature ^yere banded on to Europe, and 
from India lias come tlie religion of more tlian half of the human race. 
For India the Spanish sailed westward; for India the Portuguese sailed 
eastward. Portugal was the first to reach the goal and obtain the 
prize. Greater riches have been drawn from India than from the gold 
and silver mines of America; since for all ages it has been the store- 
house from whicli treasures were derived. Portugal held India from 
about 1500 to KJOO. Ships brought tlie silks and precious stones of 
ludia to Lisbon, where they were sold to the Dutch and distributed by 
them through Europe, Spain conquered Portugal, and to avenge her- 
self on Holland excluded her merchants from Lisbon. They then sailed 
directly for India, dispossessed the Portuguese, and the commerce of 
India was for the next hundred years controlled by Holland. 

Then for a short time India was divided between France and England, 
but under Lord Clive and Warren Hastings the possessions of France 
passed to the East India Company, and when their charter expired it 
was made a province of the Crown, and the Queen of England became 
Empress of India. 

Unlike Kome and Spain in their dealings with concjuered nations, 
England gives a fair exchange for all she takes, and rules in India for 
India, giving a more stable and equitable government than India ever 
before enjoyed. 

To-day Tyi'e, Sidon, and Carthage are known only by their ruins ; the 
glory of Greece and Rome, of Venice and Genoa, has passed: the i^ower 
of Spain and Portugal has waned, while India is developing a social, 
moral, and political ijrosperity, with wealth and commerce unknown 
in any former period of her history. 

Suez Canal. — Mucli of the trade of India in ancient times passed 
through a canal connecting the lied Sea with the Mediterranean, the 
remains of which still exist, and efforts to re-open it have been made at 
different times by Egypt without success. In 185G De Lesseps obtained 
concessions frcun the Khedive for the Suez Canal, and commenced the 
work under the directions of the best engineers of Europe. I)e Les- 
sei)s applied to English cai)italists for help, but they were deterred by 
Lord Pahnerston, wh<> said he "wouid opjiose the work to the very 
end." Mr. Stevenson, the engineer, supported Lord Palmerston, declar- 
ing that "the scheme was impracticable, excei)t at an expense too great 
to warrant any expectation of returns." The Emperor of France lent 
his name to the company, and large sums of money were raised in 
France; but the canal was constructed nuiinly by the money and labor- 
ers of Egypt. 1 1 was o})ened in 18(10, and immediately English steamers 
began to sail through the canal, and the route around the Cape of Good 
JIoj)e was almost abatuloiu'd. Other flags soon followed, and the com- 
merce with India and the East, so long lost to Venice and the jjorts of 
the Mediterranean, was revived. 



654 THE EVOLUTION OF COMMERCE. 

Ill 1875, Lord Beaconstield purcliased for England a controlling 
interest in the Snez Canal, and England now rnles both Egypt and the 
canal. The vessels of all the maritime nations of the world are con- 
stantly passing through the canal, with the single exception of those 
of the United States. 

Colonies.— The commerce of the great nations of the world has been 
principally with their colonies or dependencies, and from this com- 
merce they have derived their wealth. The mother country in return 
for its real or nominal protection, and for its own aggrandizement, has 
restricted the commerce of her colonies. 

The European nations adojited four classes of restrictions: 

(1) Restricting the exportation of goods from the colony exce])t to 
the mother country. 

(2) Restricting the importation of goods from foreign countries into 
the colonies. 

(3) Restricting the exportation or importation of goods excepting 
in ships of the mother country. 

(4) Restricting the manufacture of their own raw products l>y the 
colonies. So strong was this feeling in England that even Lord 
Chatham declared in Parliament, "The British colonies of North 
America have no right to manufacture even a nail or a horseshoe." 

Most of these restrictions have been removed, though the result still 
remains. 

The Phoenicians, Carthagenians, and Greeks liad colonies on the 
Mediterranean. The Romans conquered and held as subjects nations 
and emx)ires. Venice and Genoa had colonies on the Black and Medi- 
terranean seas. Spain and Portugal held as dependencies all Central 
America, Soutli America, Africa, India, and the islands of the Pacific. 
The Dutch Republic and France planted colonies in India and America. 
England has colonies in every part of the world, and on her dominion 
the sun never sets. 

Germany, France, Portugal, and Russia, apjireciating the necessity 
of colonies ft)r the extension of their commerce and for opening new 
markets for their manufactures, are planting colonies — France in Cochin 
China, Germany on the eastern and western coasts of Africa and the 
islands of the Pacific. Portugal, aroused to a new life, is determined 
to hold her remaining possessions in Africa; Russia is steadily adding 
to her dominions in Asia, and her railway from the Caspian Sea to 
Samarcandhas opened in western and a i)art of central Asia a market 
for her manufactures and commerce hitherto supplied by Great Britain. 

United States. — The United States is the only nation that has become 
great without colonies and without foreign commerce and shipping. 
Its vast extent of territory, where the east and west, the north and 
8outh are separated more widely than the colonies of Tyre and Sidon 
or of Carthage and Rome from the mother countries ; the great variety 



' THE EVOLUTION OF COMMERCE. 655 

of climate, the fertile soil, its varied occupations and manufactures, 
and a widely distributed population have created an enormous inland 
commerce and given that trade and wealth which other countries find 
in coinnuMco and cxclianjic with their colonies. Our population, wealth, 
internal commerce, exi)orts and imports lia ve increased at a more rapid 
rate than those of any other nation in a similar period. This is not 
due in any lireat deinree to immig^ration, for our population has increased 
iji no greater ratio since this immigration commenced than before, and 
experts believe that it would have been as large and more homogeneous 
without immigration. We had at one time a large foreign commerce, 
and our merchants were the first to establish direct trade with China 
and the East Indies; the Stars and Stripes were seen floating on 
every sea and flying in every harbor, and for years we were the second 
maritime nation <if the world. 

The commerce of the world passed from wooden sailing ships to 
side-wheel steamers, to iron and then to steel propellers; England was 
a worker in iron and machinery of every kind; we were not. The civil 
war came and hastened the day which was sure to come. Our shipping 
faded away faster than it had arisen, while that of Great Britain in- 
creased as rapidly as ours decreased. This was not owing to a decrease 
of our fi)reign trade, for during the last twenty years our exports and 
imports have increased more than twice as rapidly as those of Great 
Britain.* Eighty-seven per cent of these exports and imi)orts are 
carried in British ships, consigned to English houses which have been 
established in every large ])ort in the world, and the proceeds are 
usually remitted to the London banker. 

Fortunately, (mr flag never disappeared from our inland waters and 
from our coasting trade, for foreigners are excluded from the coasting 
trade, even where the ports are 15,000 miles apart by water. 

The substitution of steamers for sailing ships and of steel for wooden 
propellers, which took place from ten to twenty years ago on the ocean, 
is now going rapidly on ui)on our lakes. Wliere in 188() there were but 
6 steel ])ropelIers, now there are 08, and of 2,225 vessels on the north- 
ern lakes, 1,153 are steamers, 902 are sailing vessels. The action of Con- 
gress in providing for the construction and equipment of war vessels by 
competition has led our ship-builders within the last eight years to 
establish shipyards and machine shops where the largest ships can be 
built, and we are now building as large and fast vessels of war as Eng- 
land. Our ship-builders claim that they can construct ships equal in 
carrying capacity, speed, and strength to those of Great Britain, and 
at no greater cost, though they can not be run so cheaply because our 
sailors are better housed, fed, and paid than those of other nations. 

* The exports of the United States have iiicreased 112 per eeiit, the exports aud 
imports 92 per cent; the exports of Great Britain 35 per cent, her exports and im- 
ports 37 per cent. 



656 THE EVOLUTION OF COMMERCE. 

Tlie day will surely come wlieu commerce will make her last movement 
westward, when America, lyiug between Europe and A sia, with her 
boundless mineral and agricultural resources, her manufacturing fticil- 
ities, her extended sea-coasts, will be the foremost nation and New 
York the commercial capital of the world. 

Nicaragua Canal. — From New York to San Francisco by land is about 
3,000 miles, by water it is about 15,000 miles, yet, notwithstanding the 
greater distance, freight is constantly sent by water. From San Fran- 
cisco it is about the same distance by water to either New York or 
Loudon. If a water-way could be opened across the Isthmus of Panama 
from one ocean to the other, the distance from New York to San Fran- 
cisco would be diminished more than one-half, and San Francisco would 
be over 2,000 miles nearer New York than London. The first propo- 
sition for canals connecting the two oceans was made in 1550, suggest- 
ing two routes, by Panama and Nicaragua; and explorations and sur- 
veys of both have been frequently made, and various attempts made 
for their construction. 

The success of the Suez Canal induced M. de Lesseps to undertake 
the connection of the two oceans by the construction of the Panama 
Canal, believing that the tonnage passing through it would equal that 
of the Suez Canal. This work has not been successful: the canal re- 
mains unfinished, with no prospects of completion. 

Several hundred miles north of Panama is the lowest continental 
divide; 148 feet above tide water on the Pacific slope of this divide is 
Lake Nicaragua, connected by the river San Juan with the Atlantic; 
up this river and through this lake, some thirty years ago, was one of 
the regular Avays of inter-commuiucation, both for freight and passen- 
gers, between New York and California. 

The Maritime Canal Company and the Canal Construction Company, 
organized by Americans, have obtained concessions from Nicaragua, 
and have made surveys for canal, slack-water, and lake navigation from 
Greytown on the Atlantic through Lake Nicaragua to Brito on the Pa- 
cific, a distance of 170 miles. A harbor has been opened at Greytown 
and considerable work performed on the canal. The Panama route had 
the great advantage of an open channel from ocean to ocean, whereas 
the Nicaragua route requires several locks to cross the divide; but 
Brito is some GOO or 700 miles nearer California than Panama, a saving 
in distance that will compensate for the delay in locking. The open- 
ing of this canal will be the greatest benefit that could be conferred 
ui)on our commerce and shipping. 

Freights by water between New York and California are now so 
high that a large ])orti(»n goas by railroad. The effect that this canal 
should produce will be evident if we consider the great difierence in 
expense between land and water carriage. Eail rates between New 
York and Chicago are a trifle over 6 mills per ton per mile, while the 



THE EVOLUTION OF COMMERCE. 657 

ocean rates on grain to Liverpool in 1888 were about half a mill per ton 
per mile; and 1 mill per ton per mile, or ^3 per ton from New York to 
Liverpool is said to be a fair rate, while the all-rail rate between New 
York and San Francisco averages from !?40 to $80 per ton, according to 
the class to which the freight belongs. It takes from seven to ten days 
to go from New York to Liverj)ool, nearly twice as long as from New 
York to San Francisco by rail, thirty days by Panama, and one hundred 
and twenty daj's by the all-water route around Cape Horn. 

The opening of this canal will therefore reduce the freight on goods 
between the East and West at least three-fonrths and possibly more. 
It will give us a free, easy, and cheap communication by Avater between 
the Eastern and Western States ; our commerce will be built up, and the 
wealth and commerce of the Atlantic coast and the population of the 
states on the Pacific coast will be increased in a wonderful manner. 

The opening of this route will give a demand for large steamshij)s, 
and when we have such ships large shipyards and machine-shops will 
spring up, and these alone are wanted to enable ns to build and run 
ships on the Atlantic Ocean in competition with Great Britain. Then 
the prediction of Mr. Cramp will be fulfilled, that Englishmen will be 
asking one another, '^ Can we build ships as economically as they do in 
the United States?" 

Modes of conveyance. — The earliest transportation of merchandise was 
by caravans. The first caravan of which we have any certain account 
was that of the Ishmaelites and Moabites, who, while they were travel- 
ing from (rilead, with their camels bearing spices, balm, and myrrh, to 
Egypt, l)ought Joseph of his brethren and sold him as a slave to Poti- 
phar. These caravans were formed of merchants banded together for 
protection under a guide and leader, sometimes numbering several 
hundred, with one thousand camels in a caravan. They travelled from 
17 to 20 miles a day, but only in the spring and autumn months. At 
night they stopped at caravansaries, where free lodging was furnished 
to men and beasts. In Turkistan and Arabia aU trade and travel was 
by similar caravans until the railroad was opened across the desert, by 
Merv and the Oxus, to Samarcand. 

Navigation was first by boat, and ages afterward by vessels. The 
earliest vessels of which we have any account were employed in carry- 
ing cattle down the Nile, and were i)ropelled by sails and rowers. The 
vessels, at first small and with a few rowers, were slowly increased in size 
:ind number of rowers until three, four, and evenfivebanksof oars, one 
over the other, were used. They were often from 150 to 175 feet long 
and from 18 to 26 feet in breadth, drawing from 10 to 12 feet of water, 
and sometimes carrying two hundred rowers and several hundred men. 
All these ships were without decks, whether sailing on the Mediterra- 
nean or Atlantic. They sailed by day, putting into harbor at night, 
and never losing sight of land unless driven by stress of weather. At 
H. Mis. 334, pt. 1 43 



658 THE EVOLUTION OF COMMERCE. 

first they sailed ouly with, the wind, but by slow degrees they learned 
to tack; then decks were built over the stern and prow, leaving the 
midships exposed to the high seas. This class of vessels, sometimes 
with banks of oars, continued until the middle of the last century. In 
the early part of the lifteeuth century smaller but stronger vessels of 
better material were built for the voyages of discovery undertaken by 
t lie I'ortuguese. At this time, also, the mariner's compass was brought 
into general use, having been introduced from Arabia; eighty years 
later it found its Avay to England. Two of the vessels of Columbus 
were decked only at the prow and stern, and the three were manned 
by 120 men. 

The armada of Queen Elizabeth was formed of merchant vessels fitted 
uj) as men-of-war, and not until the time of Charles I were there any 
regular ships of war in England or, probably, in other countries. 

Commerce was usually carried on by companies, with rules regulat- 
ing the quantity of goods to be exported, so that the market should not 
be over-stocked and unremunerative prices obtained. Sometimes the 
merchant was owner of the vessel, who adventured with his cargo and 
sailed in his own ship. The ships were constructed with little reference 
to speed, sailing 40 or 50 miles a day.* 

The steam engine came into use near the middle of the eighteenth 
century in England, and two generations passed before it was used on 
vessels. Tlie first steamboat ran on the Hudson in 1807, in England in 
1812. Then another generation passed before the ocean was crossed 
by the Sirin-s and Great Western, in 1833, These ships sailed from 7 to 
8 knots an hour. Ten years later iron ships were built; then came the 
propeller, the invention of Ericsson, followed by vessels built of steel, 
and lastly the City of J'aris and Majestic, carrying 1,500 tons of freight 
and sailing 500 knots a day, or 20 knots an hour. 

Until tlie present century all commerce between remote points was 
by water, excepting in the Eoman Empire. After the downfall of 
Rome there was neither commerce nor travel and no use for roads, the 
cost of transportation even for a. short distance exceeding the value of 
the goods. 

The railroail was introduced about the same time into England and 
America, and was rapidly extended into every country. The steam 
engine on land and water has revolutionized the methods of transpor- 
tation and created a new commerce. "The movement of goods in a 
year on all the through routes of the world did not then equal the 
movement on a single one of our trunk lines of railroad for the same 
period." Formerly it cost $10 to move a ton of freight 100 miles; now 
it can be moved 1,300 miles for the same sum. The grain and corn 
from our Western lands, then not worth the transportation to the sea- 
coast, are now sold in London, and our prairies yield to the Western

THE EVOLUTION OP COMMERCE. 659 

farmer jj^reater profit than the grain lands of England yield to the 
farmer there. The laud commerce created by steiim probably exceeds 
to-day the commerce carried on the water. 

The cost of moving freight by railroads varies greatly in different 
l)arts of the Llnitcd States and in diflerent coimtries. The highest cost 
west of the Kocky Mountains is two and a quarter times more than in 
some, of our JMiddle States. The average freight receipts per ton \n'V 
mile in this c(mntry is ssO.D^U, which is less than those of any other 
country, although the Belgian and Eussian rates are not much higher. 
In England the rates are from 50 to 70 i)er cent higher than in Amer- 
ica, and in the other countries of Europe higher than in l<]ngland. 

In England and America the railroads are operated by private com- 
I)anies in competition. 

In France railroads are operated by private companies regulated by 
law, the country being divided among different lines of road. Lines 
are constriu'ted by iirivate companies and run at rates fixed by the 
Government. 

In Belgium and Germany the i)riucipal roads are owned and oper- 
ated by the Government. 

Our system has yielded the best results to the people. 

The commerce which Avas in olden times transported only 20 or 25 
miles a day is now moved 500 miles a day by water and 800 miles by 
land. Correspondence, then carried no faster than freight, is now 
borne by telegraph to the farthest ends of the world. 

.All these changes have taken i)lace within a single generation; for 
our fathers could not travel any faster than Alexander or Caisar. Steam- 
ships, railroads, and telegraphs within that time have transformed all 
commercial transactions and the methods of commercial business. For- 
merly eight months were required to execute an order in India or China 
and obtain the return; now one day is sufficient. These commercial 
changes caused a revolution in the modes of business, and were the main 
factors which produced the monetary disturbances of 1873, the effects of 
which we yet feel, so long has it taken the world to adjust itself to its 
new relations. 

The future of eommeree. — The commerce of the world originated in 
Asia; it was carried to Africa and thence to Europe, and from Europe 
to America. This movement can go no farther westward, for on the 
other side of the Pacific is China, which has successfully resisted every 
attempt of the European to encroach upon her domains, and India with 
its teeming popidation of 250,000,000; so that America, the last of the 
continents to be inhal)ited, now receives the wealth of India and Asia 
pouring into it fiom the west, and the manufactures and population of 
Europe from the east. Here the east and west, different from each 
other in mental power and civilization, will meet, each ahme inconqdete, 
each essential to the fullest and most symmetrical development of the

otlier. Here will he the great banking and commercial houses of the 
world, the center of business, wealth, and population. 

The end is not yet. Inventions are increasing in a geometric rather 
than an arithmetic progression. The limit of steam jiower has not 
been reached, for with a high temperature in a steam boiler the addi- 
tion of a few pounds of coal increases the steam power so greatly that 
we are unable either to control or to use it. 

Electricity has just begun to oft'er new opportunities to commerce. 
We are no longer compelled to carry our factories to the water power, 
for by the electric wire the power may be brought to the house of the 
operative, and we may again see the private workman supersede the 
fjictory operative. A few cars and small vessels are moved by elec- 
tricity, the forerunner of greater things. We know little of this new 
agency, but its future growth must be more rapid and more wonderful 
than that of steam. 

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution (Mr. Langley) tells us 
that "before the incoming of the twentieth century aerial navigation 
will be an established fact." 

"The deeper the insight we obtain into the mysterious workings of 
nature's forces," says Siemens, "the more we are convinced that we are 
stillstandingin the vestibule of science; that an unexplored world still 
lies before us ; and however much we may discover, we know not whether 
mankind will ever arrive at a full knowledge of nature." 



ON THE KELATIOX OF NATURAL SCIENCE TO ART.* 



By T)r, E. du Bois-Reymond, F. R. S. 



We are assembled to-day in annual commemoration of a man whose 
marvellous breadth of view and extraordinary variety of interests are 
each time a fresli surprise to us. It seems incredible that the same 
hand could have penned the " Protogea" and the state paper adjudging 
the Principality of Neufchatel to the King of Prussia, or that the same 
mind could have conceived the infinitesimal calculus and the true meas- 
ure of forces, as well as the pre-established harmony and the "Theo- 
dicea." A closer examination however reveals a blank in the uni- 
versality of his genius. We seek in vain for any connection with art, 
if we except the Latin jx^eni composed by Leibnitz in i)raise of Brand's 
discovery of phosphorus. We need hardly mention that his ''Ars 
Combinatoria" has nothing to do with the fine arts. In his letters and 
works observations on the beautiful are few and far between; once he 
discusses more at length the pleasure excited by music, the cause ot 
which lie attributes to an equable, though invisible, order in the chorda! 
vibrations, whicli '^raiseth a sympathetic echo in our minds." However, 
the world of the senses had little reality for Leibnitz. With his bodily 
eye he saw the Alps and the treasures of Italian art, but they conveyed 
nothing to his soul. He was indifferent to beauty; in short, we never 
surprise this Hercules at Omphale's distati". 

The same neglect, at least of sculpture and painting, strikes us in 
Voltaire, who as polyhistorian can in some measure compare with Leib- 
nitz. W(^ are obliged to descend as far as the third generation — that 
is, to Di<lerot in France, to Winckelmann and Lessing in Germany — 
before we meet with a decided interest in the fine arts and an appreci- 
ation of the part they play in the progress, of civilization.

662 ON THE RELATION OF NATURAL SCIENCE TO ART. 

The i)eiiod thus defined, though it excels in science, shows with few 
exceptions a falling' off in the fine arts. On considering the historical 
development of these two branches of human productiveness we find no 
correspondence whatever between their individual progress. When 
Greek sculpture was in its prime, science scarcely existed. True, Leo- 
nardo's gigantic personality, which combines the immortal artist with the 
physicist of high rank, towers at the beginning of the epoch generally 
known in the history of art as the Cinquecento. Still, he was too far in 
advance of his age in the latter capacity to be cited as an example of 
simultaneous development in art and science; so little that Galilei was 
born the day of Michael Angelo's death. The mutual development in art 
and science at the commencement of our century is, I believe, merely a 
casual coincidence; moreover, the fine arts have since been, at the best, 
stationary, whereas science strides on victoriously toward a boundless 
future. 

In fact, both branches differ too widely for the services rendered to 
science by art, and vice versa, to be other than external. "Nature," 
Goethe very truly observed to Eckermann — little thinking how harshly 
this remark reflects on part of his own scientific work — " Nature allows 
no trifling; she is always sincere, always serious, always stern; she is 
always in the right, and the errors and mistakes are invariably ours." 
Fully to appreciate the truth of this, one must be in the habit of trying- 
one's own hand at experiments and observations wiiile gazing in 
Nature's relentless countenance, and of bearing, as it were, the tremen- 
dous responsibility incurred by the statement of the seemingly most in- 
significant fact. For every correctly interpreted experiment means no 
less than this: Whatever occurs under the j)resent circumstances 
would have occurred under the same conditions before an infinite nega- 
tive period of time, and would still occur after an infinite positive 
period. Only the mathematician, whose method of research has more 
in common with that of the experimenter than is generally sui)i)Osed, 
experiences the same feeling of lesponsibility in presence of Nature's 
eternally inviolable laws. Both are sworn witnesses before the tribu- 
nal of reality, striving for knowledge of the universe as it actually is, 
within those limits to which we are confined by the nature of our intel- 
lect. 

However, there is a compensation for the philosopher, laboring under 
this anxious pressure, in, the consciousness that the slightest of his 
achievements will carry him one step beyond the highest reached by 
his greatest predecessor ; that possibl j^ it may contain the germ of vastly 
im];)ortant theoretical revelations and practical results, as Wollaston's 
lines contained the germ of spectral analysis; that, at any rate, such a 
reward is not only in the reach of a born genius, but of any conscien- 
tious worker; and, finally, that science, by subduing nature to the rule 
of the human intellect, is the chief instrument of civilization. No real 
civilization would exist without it, and in its absence nothing could pre- 



ON THE RELATION OF NATURAL SCIENCE TO ART. 6G3 

vent our civilization, inelnding art and its master works, from crumbling 
away again hopelessly, as at the decline of the ancient world. 

Thisconsciousness will also make up to the philosopher for the thought- 
lessness of the multitude, who, while enjoying the benetits thus lavished 
upon them, hardly know to whom they owe them. The country rings 
with the name of every fiishionable musical virtuoso, and cyclopedias 
insure its immortality. But who repeats the name of him who achieved 
that supreme triumph of the inventive intellect — to convey through a 
copper wire across far-stretching countries and over hill and dale the 
sound of the human voice as though it spoke in our ear'? 

"Life is earnest, art is gay;" this saying of Schiller's remains as true 
if we substitute science for life. Art is the realm of the beautiful; its 
productions till us with an enjoyment, half sensuous, half intellectual; 
it is therefore a realm of liberty in the widest sense. No rigid laws 
are enforced in it; no stern logic binds the events of the present to 
those of the past and future ; no certain signs indicate success ; blame 
and praise are distributed by the varying taste of ages, nations, and 
individuals, so that the glorious Gothic church architecture came to be 
derided by the eighteenth century. In art, the definition of genius as 
a talent for patience does not hold good. Its creations, once brought 
forth in a happy hour of revelation, stir our souls with elementary force, 
aiul scorn all abstruse explanations, subsequently forced upon them by 
art criticism. Whoever accomplishes such a feat also ministers in a 
sense to the cares and troubles of humanity. Unfortunately the nature 
of things does not allow such fruit to ripen at all seasons; at one time, 
in one direction, the culminating point will be reached, and then age 
after age will strive in vain to emulate the past. The finest {esthetic 
theories can neither carry the individual beyond the limits of his own 
natural powers, nor retrieve the fortunes of a declining period. Of what 
use has been the recent strife in the artistic world between naturalists 
and idealists ? Has it protected us from the frequently almost intoler- 
able extravagances of the latter 1 There is an attraction in every boldly- 
advanced novelty which the common herd is unable to resist, and which 
will invariably triumph till antiquated ideas are somehow surplanted 
by fresh ones, or by the lofty rule of some irresistibly superior personality. 
Nor can science in the stricter sense come to the aid of art; and thus, 
strangers at heart, without materially influencing each other, each seeks 
its own way, the former advancing steadily, though irregularly, the 
latter slowly fluctuating like a majestic tide. Those unfamiliar with 
science are apt to recognize the supreme develoj^ment of our mental 
faculties in art alone. Doubtless this is a mistake; yet human intellect 
shines brighest where glory in art is coupled with glory in science. 

We may notice something here which is similar to what occurs in 
practical ethics. The more corrui)t the morals of an age or nation, the 
more we find virtue a favorite topic. The flood of festhetic theories 
rises highest when original creative power is at its lowest ebb. Lotze,

in his " History of ^Esthetics in Germany," * gives a wearying and dis- 
couraging acconnt of sncli fruitless efforts. Philosophers of all schools 
have revelled in absract definitions of the essence of beauty. They 
call it unity in multiplicity, or fitness without a purpose, or uncon- 
scious rationality, or the transcendant realized, or the enjoyment of the 
harmony of the absolute, and so forth. But all these properties, which 
are supposed to constitute the beautiful, have no more to do with our 
actual sensation of it than the vibrations of light and sound with the 
qualities they bring to our perception. Indeed, it would be vain to 
attempt to find one term equally fitted to describe all the varieties of 
the beautiful; the beauty of cosmos as contrasted with chaos, of a 
mountain prospect, a symphony, or a poem, of Eistori in Medea, or a 
rose; or even, taking the fine arts alone, the beauty of the Cologne 
(Jathedral, the "Hermes" of Praxiteles, the Madonna Sistina, a picture 
of still-life, a landscape, a genre piece, or a Japanese flower design ; 
not to mention the questionable custom which permits us in German to 
speak of a beautiful taste or a beautiful smell. Let us rather admit that 
here, as so often, we meet with something inexplicable in our organi- 
zation; sometliing inex^jressible, though not the less distinctly felt, 
without which life would offer a dull and cheerless aspect. 

In an essay of Schiller's there is a disquisition on physical beauty, t 
He distinguishes between an architectural beauty and a beauty which 
emanates from grace. I attacked this lesthetic rationalism, to which 
the last century was strongly addicted, twenty years ago on a similar 
occasion in a lecture on Leibnitz's ideas in modern science. I ventured 
to assert that " the attraction which physical beauty exerts on the op- 
posite sexes can as little be explained as the effects of a melody."| On 
reflection, it seems indeed incomprehensible why one distinct shape, 
which, according to Fechner, might be represented by a plain algebraic 
equation between three variables, should please us beyond a thousand 
other possibilities. The reason can be traced from no abstract principle, 
no rules of architecture, not even from Hogarth's line of beauty. A 
year after this remark was made, Charles Darwin published his " De- 
scent of man," in which the principle of sexual selection, only cursorily 
treated in the " Origin of Species," is fully exi)ounded, and pursued in 
all its bearings. I remember vividly how, in a discussion with Dove as 
to the necessity of admitting a vital force, he embarrassed me by the 
objection that in the organic world luxury occurs, for example, in the 
|tlumageoi"ai peacock or a bird of Paradise; while in inorganic nature 
Maupertuis's law of the minimum of action precludes such prodigality. 
Here was a solution of the problem, aUowing that one might attribute 
to animals a certain sense of beauty. The gorgeous nuptial plumage dis- 
played by male birds may have been acquired through the preference of

tlie female for more highly ornamented suitors, a progeny of constantly 
increasing brilliancy of coloring being thus obtained. Male birds of 
Paradise have been observed to vie in showing off their beauty before 
the females during courtship. The power of song in nightingales might 
be attributed to the same cause, the female in this case being more sus- 
ceptible to the charms of melody than to those of brilliant coloring. 
Darwin goes on to observe that, in the human race likewise, certain 
sexual characteristics, such as the imposing beard in man and the lovely 
tresses in woman, might have been acquired through sexual selection.* 
It is a well-known fact that, by repeated introduction of handsome Cir- 
cassian slaves into aristocratic Turkish harems, the original Mongol 
type in many cases has be<'ii remarkably ennobled. And carrying the 
same principle further, we may lind therein an explanation for the fas- 
cination which female beauty has for man. According to our pres- 
ent views, the tirst wonum was not made of a rib taken out of the tirst 
man — a process fraught with morphological difficulties. It was man 
himself who, in (!Ountless generations, through natural selection, 
fashioned woman to his own liking, and was so fashioned by her. This 
typiB we call beantiful, but we need only to cast a glance at a Venus by 
Titian, or one by Rubens — let alone the different liuman races — to recog- 
nize how little absolute this beauty is. 

If one kind of beauty could be said to bear analyzing better than 
another it is what might be termed mechanical beauty. It is noticed 
least, because it escapes all but the ])racticed eye. This kind of beauty 
may belong to machines or physical apparatus, each part of which is 
exactly titted to its purpose in size, shape, and iwsition. It answers 
nuu-e or less to the definition of " unconscious rationality," our satis- 
faction evidently proceeding from an unconscious perception of the 
right means having been employed to combine solidity, lightness, and, 
if necessary, mobility, with the greatest possible profit in the transmis- 
sion of force and the smallest waste of material. A driving-belt is 
certainly neither attractive nor unattractive; but it pleases the " visus 
erwUtus^' to see a connecting-rod thicken from the ends towai-ds the 
middle, where it has to bear the greatest strain. Of course, this kind 
of beauty is of recent origin. I remember Halske telling me that, as 
regards the construction of physical and astronomical instruments, it 
was, to his knowledge, first understood and established as a principle 
in Germany by Cleorg von Reiclienbach in jMunich. Berlin and Munich 
work-shops produced instruments of perfect mechanical beauty at a 
time when those supplied by France and England were still often dis- 



* The autbor is not unaware of Mr. Wallace's attack on Darwin's explanation of the 
brilliant i)lumage of male birds by the females' preference, and of the discussion 
arisen between liim and Messrs. Poulton, Pocock, and Feckham. This was not the 
])roper place to enter into it, thi' leas so as, wliate\ er may be its outcome, the author's 
conclusion from the thcoiy of sexual selection would remain unaltered.

ligiired by aimlessly ornaiiiented columns and cornices, unpleasantly 
recalling- th«^ impure features of Eococo furniture and arcliitecture. 

I forget which French mathematician of the last century, in sight of 
the cupola of St. Peter's at Eome, tried to account for the sense of per- 
fect satisfaction it gives to the eye. He measured out the curves of 
the cupola, and found that, according to the rules of higher statics, its 
shape supplies the exact maximum of stability under the given circum- 
stances. Thus Michael Angelo, guided by an unerring instinct in the 
construction of his model (the cupola was not erected till after his 
death), unconsciously solved a problem the true nature of which he 
could hardly have understood, and which was even beyond the reach 
of the mathematical knowledge of his age. Apparently however 
there are several roots to this erpiation of beauty; at least, there is one 
other type, for which I quote the cupola of Val de Grace in Paris, 
which, if not as imposing, is quite as gratifying to the eye as Michael 
Angelo's. 

It will be observed that in this case mechanical beauty becomes part of 
the art of architecture ; and instances of this kind are daily growing more 
frequent, our modern iron structures being more favorable to it« dis- 
play than stone buildings. In the Eiffel tower we see mechanical beauty 
struggling with the absence of plastic beauty. On this occasion it was 
probably revealed for the first time to many who hitherto had no op- 
portunity of experiencing its effect. It is certainly not wanting in the 
new Forth Bridge. There is no doubt however that in stone struc- 
tures too, together with much that pleases from habit or tradition, 
there are certain features which evidently attract through mechanical 
beauty — such as the outline of the architectural members of a building, 
or the gentle swelling and tapering of the Doric column towards the 
top, and its expansion in the echinus and abacus; and there are others 
which oftend a refined taste through the absence of this beneficial ele- 
ment, such as the meaningless ornamentations of the Rococo style. 

Even in organic nature mechanical beauty prevails to such an extent 
that it transforms many objects into a source of delight and admiration 
to the initiated, which are naturally repulsive to the untrained eye. 
Anatomists recognize it with pleasure in the structure of the bones, 
especially of the joints. In their opinion the "Dance of Death" out- 
rages good taste from more reasons than because it differs from the 
classical conception of death. Mechanical beauty was already per- 
ceived by Benveuuto Cellini in the skeleton, much to his credit; and 
but for our imperfect knowledge it would invest with its glory every 
organic form, down to the inhabitants of the aquarium, even under the 
very microscope. According to Prof. Schwendener, even plants are 
constructed on the same principle of fitness combined with thrift; and 
something of this we feel at sight of a spreading oak tree proudly dis- 
tending its vigorous branches towards air and sunligiit. 

Again, our appreciation of the forms of animals, especially of noble

breeds, is greatly iiitin(Mi<'e<l by niecbaiiicsil beauty. Tlie greyboiind 
and the l)ulIdog, the rull-bicd lacc^ liorse and the brewer's dray horse, 
the Southdown and the, Merino sheep, the Alpine cattle and the Dutch 
milch cow, all are beautiful in their kind, even though a bulklog or a 
Percheron may appear ugly to the uninitiated, because in each the type 
of the species has been modilied to the utmost degree of fitness. 

Though science is uuabU% as we have seen, to clieck the occasional 
de{;line of art and inspire it with fresh vigor, yet it renders invaluable 
services of a different kind to artists by increasing their insight, im- 
proving their technical means, teaching- tliem useful rules, and preserv- 
ing them from mistakes. I do not allude to anything so primitive as 
the manufacture of cohu's or the technique of casting in bronze; the 
less so, as curiously enough our modern colors are less durable than 
those of entirely unscientific ages, and the unsurpassed thinness of the 
casting of (Ireek bronzes is regarded as a proof of their authenticity. 
Nor does it seem necessary to recall the notorious advanta^s of this 
kind for which art is indebted to science. Linear perspective was in- 
vented by Leonardo and Diirer — artists themselves. It was followed 
by the laws of reflection — unknown to ancient painters, as would ap- 
pear from the Pompeian frescoes of Narcissus — and by the geometrical 
construction of shadows. The rainbow, which had better not be at- 
tempted at all, has been sinned against cruelly and persistently by 
artists, in spite of optics. Statics furnished the rules of ecjuilibrium 
so essential to sculptors. Ai'rial perspective, again, owes its develop- 
ment to painters chiefly of northern climates. 

But to this fundamental stock of knowledge the progress of science 
has added various new and important acquisitions, which philosophers, 
some of first-rate ability, have endeavored to place within the reach of 
artists. The great masters of bygone ages were taught by instinct to 
combine the right colors, as women of taste, according to John Milller, 
always know how to blend the right shades in their dress ; and Oriental 
carpet weavers have not been behindhand with them in that respect. 
But tlie reason why they unconsciously succeed was not revealed till 
the elder Darwins, Goethe, Purkinye, John Miiller, and others called 
into existence a subjective physiology of the sense of sight. A mem- 
ber of this academy, Prof, von J5rucke, in his "Physiology of Colors"* 
and "Fragments from the Theory of the Fine Arts in relation to Indus- 
trial Art,"t treats these subjects with such intimate knowledge as could 
only be obtained by one who enjoyed the rare advantage of combining 
l)hysiological learning with an artistic education acquired in his father's 
studio. In France Chevreul pursued similar aims. Even Prof, von 
Ilelmh(»ltz, in his popular lectures, has devoted his profound knowledge 
of physiological optics to the service of art, which already owes him 
important revelations on the nature of musical harmony. Amongst

other things, he exphiined the rehition between the different intensities 
of light in objects of the actual world and those on the painter's pal- 
ette, and pointed out the means by which the difficulties arising there- 
from may be overcome.* Tlius painters, as von Briicke remarks, have 
it in their power to reproduce the dazzling effect of the disk of the sun 
by imitating the irradiation — a defect of our visual perception, the true 
nature of which was recognized by von Helmholtz. An example of 
this, interesting through its boldness, is the lovely Oastell (xandolfo in 
the Raczynski gallery. 

There are so many and striking instances of such imperfections of 
the human eye that, notwithstanding its marvellous capabilities, von 
Helmholtz has observed that "he would feel himself justified in cen- 
suring most severely the careless workmanship of an optician who 
offered him for sale an instrument with similar defects, and that he 
woukl emphatically refuse to take it." The eye being the chief organ of 
artists, its defects are of great importance in aTt and its history, and 
artists would do well to inform themselves not only on these defects in 
general, but more particularly on those which they, in tlieir own jjer- 
sons, are subject to; for, as Bessel remarked of astronomical instru- 
ments, " an error once well ascertained ceases to be an error." 

Our conception of the stars as stars, in the shape adopted symboli- 
cally by decorative art, is caused by a defect of the eye closely related 
to irradiation, stars being luminous spots in the sky without rays, as 
they actually aj)pear to a privileged few. Prof. p]xner, Avhose line of 
thought we shall repeatedly cross in the course of these reflections, 
justly remarks that to this imperfection the stars conferred by sover- 
eigns as marks of distinction owe their origin and starfishes their name 
even since Pliny's time. The different varieties of halo, however, are 
more probably freeborn children of our fancy — from the Byzantine 
massive golden disk down to the mild phospliorescence proceeding from 
holy heads and in Correggio's "Mght" from the entire child, which 
illumines the scene with a light of its own. According to Prof. Exner, 
glories of the latter description are derived from the radiance Avhich 
surrounds the shadow of one's own head in the sunshine on a dewy 
meadow, and which in fact has always been compared to halos in reli- 
gicms pictures. This phenomenon even misled Benvenuto Cellini into 
the pious delusion that it was a gift granted him individually from 
above, and a reflection of his visions, such as Moses brought down from 
Mount Sinai.t 

Certain otherwise quite inexplicable peculiarities which disfigure the 
later works of the distinguished landscape j)ainter Turner have also 
been traced to defects of the eye by Dr. Richard Liebreich.:]: Clouded

lenses or a high degree of astigiuatisiii might easily lead a painter to 
distort or blnr objects he ^vas copying from nature. Bonder's stenoptic 
spectacles or cylindrical spectacles, as the case might be, would xirove 
as useful to such an artist as concave glasses to the short-sighted. 

The singularities of another English painter, Mulready, are accounted 
for by Dr. Liebreich through discoloration of the lens from old age. 
Another defect of the eye, color-blindness, ought to be mentioned here, 
A\liicli in its milder forms is of frequent occurrence, and even belongs to 
the normal condition of the eye on the borders of the tield of vision. 
It corresponds in the donuiin of hearing to the want of musical ear. 
Color-blindness was known long ago, but has been inquired into with 
redoubled zeal latterly, partly with regard to its general connection 
with chromatics, partly on account of its serious i^ractical consequences 
in the case of sailors, railway ofticials, and, as Dr. Liebreich adds, of 
painters. Both color-blindness and want of ear are inborn defects, for 
which there is no remedy. A color blind artist is however better off 
than a musician without an ear, if such a one were imaginable, for, 
even if he neglected the mahl- stick and the chisel, he might still seek 
his fortune in the designing of cartoons. 

It is difficult to determine the particular point where optical knowl- 
edge ceases to be of use to artists. None will repent having studied 
the laws of the movement of the eyes, the difference between near and 
distant Aision, and the observations on the expression of the human 
eye contained in John Miiller's early work on '^ Comparative Physiology 
of Sight." Yet it must be admitted that a i^ainter may paint an eye 
exceedingly well without ever having heard of Sanson's images, which 
cause the soft luster of a gentle eye as well as the fierce flash of an 
angry one ; as little as the blue sky of a landscape painter will gain by his 
knowledge of the yellow brushes in every great circle of the heavenly 
vault which passes through the sun — a phenomenon which has remained 
unnoticed for countless ages, but has grown familiar to physiologists 
since Haidinger's discovery. 

One point, however, where physicists seem to me not to have been 
sufficiently consulted is the much-debated question of polychrome in 
ancient statues and architecture, and whether it should be adopted by 
modern art or not. Physical experiments teach that very intense 
illumination causes all colors to appear whitish ; in the spectrum of the 
sun, seen immediately through the telescope, the colors vanish almost 
entirely, nothing remaining except a light yellow hue in the red end. 
As the colors grow whitish the glaring contrasts are softened, they 
blend more harmoniously. In the open air, therefore, our eye is not 
shocked by the scarlet skirt of the contadina, which recurs almost as 
invariably in Oswald Achenbach's Campagna landscapes, as the white 
horse in Wouvermann's war scenes. The Greek statues and buildings 
may have h)oked well enough with their glaring decorations under the 
bright southern sky on the Acropolis or in tbe foikilej in the dull light

of our northern home, above all in closed rooms, they are somewhat 
out of place. 

In another direction Wheatstone has added valuable information to 
the knowledge of painters and designers with his stereoscope. It dem- 
onstrates the fundamental difference which distinguishes binocular 
vision of near objects from monocular vision, as well as from binocular 
vision of objects so far removed that the distance between the eyes 
vanishes as compared with their distance. An impression of solidity 
can only be obtained by each eye getting a different view of an object, 
the two images being fused into one, so as to appear solid. A painter 
can therefore onlj^ express depth by shading and aerial perspective; he 
will never be able to produce the impression of actual solidity on his 
canvas. While Wheatstone's i)seudoscope exhibits the unheard-of spec- 
tacle of a concave human face, Helmholtz's tele-stereoscope magnifies, 
as it were, the space between the eyes, and resolves a fixr-off range of 
woods or hills without aerial perspective into its different distances. 
Finally, Halske's stereoscope, with movable pictures, confirms old Dr. 
Kobert Smith's explanation of the much-debated circumstance that the 
sun and moon on the horizon appear larger by almost a fifth of their 
diameter than W'hen seen in the zenith, and reduces the problem to the 
other question : why the vault of the sky appears to us tiattened in- 
stead of hemispherical. 

However, the almost contemporary invention of photography was des- 
tined to be of vastly greater importance to the fine arts. It had always 
been the dream of artists as well as j)hysicists to fix Delia Porta's 
charming pictures — a dream the realization of which did not seem quite 
impossible since the discovery of chloride of silver. One must have 
witnessed Daguerre's invention, and Arago's report of it in the Chamber 
of Deputies, to conceive the universal enthusiasm with which it was 
welcomed. Daguerre's method, being complicated and of restricted 
application, was soon cast into the shade by the one still essentially 
practiced at the present day. However, it is worth recording that, 
when the first specimens, imperfect as they were, reached us from Eng- 
land, no one foresaw the immense success in store for Talbotypes ; on 
the contrary, the change from silver-coated plates to paper impregnated 
with the silver salt was received with doubt and considered a retro- 
gression. 

Thus photography entered on its marvellously victorious career. 
With respect to art, it promptly fulfilled what Arago had promised in 
its name. It not only facilitated the designing of architecture, interi- 
ors, and landscapes, and rendered the camera clara unnecessary even 
for panoramas, but also furnished many valuable hints with regard to 
hght and shade, reflection and chiaroscuro, and the general means of 
reproducing as closely as possible on a level surface the raised appear- 
ance of solid forms. A competent judge of both arts might find it 
an interesting task to ascertain what share photograjjhy has had in

tlie ()ri,i;iii of the modern schools of painting and in the manner of 
impressionists and pleinairists. It further taught landscape painters 
to depict rocks and A^egetation with geological and botanical accuracy, 
and to rci)resent glaciers, which hitlierto had been but rarely and never 
successfully attempted. It caught and lixed the changing aspect of 
the clouds, though only yielding a somewhat restricted survey of the 
h<'a\-ens. It aided jmrtrait painters, without exciting their jealousy; 
for, unable to rival them in representing the average aspect of jjersons, 
it only seized single, often strained and weary, expressions, rendering 
almost proverbial the comparison between a bad portrait and a photo- 
graplied face; nevertheless it supplied them on many occasions with 
an invaluable groundwork, lacking nothing but the animating touch 
of an artist's hand. 

However, the recent progress of photographic portraiture claims the 
attention of artists in more than one respect. Duchenne and Darwin 
called into existence a new doctrine of the expression of the emotions; 
tlie former by galvanizing the muscles of the face, in order to imitate 
different expressions, the latter by inquiring into their phylogenetic 
development in the animal series. Both presented artists with plioto- 
gra])hs which quickly consigned to oblivion the copies hitherto employed 
for purposes of study in schools of art, dating chielly from Lebrun ; 
even the sketches iu Signor Mantegazza's new work on '^Physiognomy 
and Mimics'' will scarcely enter into competition. On Mr. Herbert 
Spencer's suggestion Mr. Francis Galton subsequently solved by the 
aid of photography a problem which was previously quite as inac- 
cessible to painters as the representation of an average expression to 
photographers. He combined the average features of the face and 
skull of a sullicient number of persons of the same age, sex, profession, 
culture, or disposition to disease or vice in one typical portrait, which 
exhibits only those characteristic forms common to their various dis- 
positions. This Avas effected by blending on one negative the faint 
images of a series of persons belonging to the same descrijition. In 
the same manner Prof. Bowditch, of Harvard Medical School, Boston, 
obtained the representative face or type of American students of both 
sexes and of tramway conductors and drivers. In the latter instance 
the intellectual superiority of the conductors over the drivers is plainly 
visible. How Lavater and Gall would have relished this! 

Of course the average expression of a single person might be pro- 
cured by similar means, if it were worth while summing uj) on the same 
plate repeated photographs of different expressions. Instantaneous 
photography, however, furnishes a welcome substitute for the average 
expression, by seizing with lightning swiftness the changing phases of 
the human countenance in their full vivacity. Here again pathology 
l)laces itself at the disposal of art. M. Charcot has found that photo- 
grai)hs of the convulsions and facial distortions of hysterical patients 
resemble our classical representations of the i)ossessed. Kaphael's

realism in this respect is perhaps the most curious of all, being so much 
at variance with his idealistic nature. In the possessed boy of the 
"Transfiguration " a cerebral disease can be almost safely inferred from 
the Magendie position of the eyes, and the circumstance, rec ently ob- 
served in New York, that the left hand is depicted in a spasm of athe- 
tosis would accord well with this diagnosis.* 

II. 

There is yet another direction in which art owes instructive disch)s- 
ures to the progress of photograi^hy. In the year 1836, the Brothers 
William and P^dward Weber represented, in their celebrated work on 
the " Mechanism of the Human Locomotive Apj)aratus," a person in 
the act of walking in those attitudes which according to theoretical 
calculation must occur successively during one step. Thence a strange 
fact became apparent. At the beginning and end of each step, Avhile 
the body rests for a short time on both feet, the pictures agree per- 
fectly with the ordinary way in which painters have been accustomed 
to represent walking persons. But during the middle of the step, 
while one foot is swinging past the other, the effect is highly eccentric, 
not to say ludicrous. The individual appears to be stumbling over his 
own feet like a tipsy fiddler, and nobody had ever been seen walking in 
such a way. On the last page of their book the Brothers Weber pro- 
pose to test the correctness of their diagrammatic figures by the aid of 
Stampfer & Plateau's stroboscopic disks in the shape of Horner's 
D,Tdaleum,t which has (strange to say) returned to us from America as 
a new invention, under the name of "zoetrope" or even "vivantos- 
cope;" but whether the proposal was carried out or not does not 
appear. 

However, William Weber lived to see his assertions thoroughly 
justified almost half a century later by instantaneous photograj)hy. 
It was first put into practice in 1872 by Mr. Eadweard Muybridge at 
the suggestion of Mr. Stanford, in order to fix the consecutive attitudes 
of horses in their different paces. The result was the same as in 
Weber's diagrammatic figures; pictures were obtained which nobody 
could believe to have been seen in reality. On photographs of street 
life and processions the camera frequently surprised people in attitudes 
quite as odd as those attributed to them by the brothers Weber on 
theoretical grounds. The same is the case with the remarkable series 
of photographs of a flying bird during one beat of its wiugs, obtained 
by M. Marey with his photographic gun. 

The explanation is known to be as follows: An object in motion, the 
speed of which varies periodically, leaves a deeper and more lasting

impression on our mind in those positions wbicli it occupies longest, 
Avhile the imxjressiou is fainter and more fleeting in those through 
which it passes quickly. Apart from all knowledge of this law, a 
])aiiiter wouhl never represent a Dutch clock in a cottage with the 
})endulum at the i)erpendicular, as every spectator would inquire why 
the clock had been stopped. The penduhim, having swung in one di 
reetion, necessarily stops for a moment Avhih', preparing to return in 
the other, and consequently its diverging position is more vividly 
stamped on our minds than those during which it passes through its 
position of rest with a nmximum of speed. Precisely the same thing 
occurs with the alternately swinging legs of a man during the act of 
walking; the body remains longest in the position in which both feet 
support it, and shortest in that during which one foot swings past the 
other. We therefore receive scarcely any impression from the latter 
series of attitudes. We imagine a walking person, and painters 
accordingly represent him, in the interval between two steps, Avith 
both feet touching tlie ground. 

In the case of a running horse, however, particular circumstances 
intervene. However rapid the succession of instantaneous photo- 
graphs, we never obtain the usual image of a racing horse such as it 
appears in large numbers in the j)rint-shops at the racing season, and 
such as Ave suppose we actually see in reality. It is different in the 
case of man; there among pictures obtained methodically or by chance, 
which have, so to speak, never been jjerceived by the naked eye, some 
will always occur which agree with the usual aspect of a walking per- 
son. The difference consists in this, that in a racing horse the interval 
of time, during which the fore legs remain in complete extension, does 
not coincide with that during which the hind legs are fully extended. 
Both these positions prevailing in our memory, they are subsequently 
blended into the traditional j)icture of a race horse, whereas instan- 
taneous photography fixes them successively. Consequently the tra- 
ditional picture is wrong, and exhibits the horse in a position through 
which it does not even transitorily pass. 

In the year 1S82, an illustrated American paper brought out a picture 
of a steeple-chase, in which all the horses are coi)ied from Muybridge's 
pliotogra])hs, in attitudes only visible to a rapid plate. This ingenious 
sketch was communicated to us by Prof. Eder in A'ienna, in apanqihlet 
on instantaneous photography, and a stranger sjiectacle can not well 
be imagined. The correctness of these apparently wrong pictures can 
however be proved by realizing the idea originally suggested by the 
brothers WcIxm', and integrating into a general impression the period- 
ical motion win<h has l)cen resolved, as it were, into dift'erential 
pictures. This is done by gazing in the da'daleum at a series of photo- 
graphs taken at suliticiently brief intervals from an object in periodical 
motion, or illuminating or projecting it momentarily during its rapid 
flight past the eye. The latter method has been j)ut into practice by 
H. Mis. 334, pt. 1 43

Mr. Muybridge himself in his "zoopraxiscope,'' and with ns in the 
ek'ctric stroboscope by Mr. Ottomar Anscliiitz, a most skiJlfnl handler 
of instantaneous photograi)hy. In both instruments we see men and 
horses reduced to their natural mode of walking, running, or jumping — 
witli one exception. The spee<l with which the slits of the d;edaleum 
l>ass before the eye, or the period <lnring which each picture is illumi- 
nated, being exactly the same for the whole series, the general effect 
produced is somewhat different from what it would be in real life. 
On the whole, however, the position in which l)oth feet are touching 
the ground, prevails, because the motion of the legs slackens when 
approaching this position, so that the pictures follow each other more 
closely and almost coincide. 

The series of instantaneous phptograplis taken by Mr. Muybridge 
and Mr. Anscliiitz from an athlete, during tbe performance of a mus- 
cular effort, are an inexliaustible source of instruction to students of 
the nude. Mr. Auschlitz's stroboscope exhibits a stone and a spear- 
thrower in all the different stages of their violent action ; their muscles 
ar(^ seen to swell and slacken, until finally the missile is represented 
after its discharge, as it can not move any taster than the liand in the 
act of hurling it. Animal painters will find equally useful the instan- 
taneous i)hotographs which Mr. Muybridge and Mr. Anscliiitz have ob- 
tained from domestic and wild animals. 

Even on breakers in a stormy sea the camera has been employed 
with surprising success. In making use of these photographs, painters 
should, however, remember that the human eye can not see the waves 
as a rapid plate does, and beware of jiroducing a picture which in cer- 
tain respects would be quite as incorrect as the clock which appears to 
have been stopped, or the man stumbling over his own feet. 

Finally, the traditional representation of lightning in the shape of a 
fiery zigzag has been recently proved by Mr. Shelford Bidwell, on the 
evidence of two hundred instantaneous photographs, to be just as 
wrong as the traditional i)icture of a racing horse. Mr. Eric Stuart 
Bruce endeavors to vindicate the zigzag by taking it for a reflection on 
cumulus clouds;* it is, hoAvever, difficult to understand how its sharj) 
angles can be accounted for in this way. 

Prof, von Briicke has devoted a special essay to tbe rules for the 
artistic rendering of motion, which, together with the laws on the com- 
bination of colors, have at all times been unconsciously folloAved by the 
great masters. 

A cultivated and artistically gifted eye, supported by sufficient tech- 
nical knowledge, was always able to compose genuine works of art in 
photography, as Mrs. Cameron long ago proved. In our days. Dr. Vi- 
anna de Lima has shown how this branch of art has been advanced 
and extended by instantaneous photography. It contributes a solution

to Conti's question in Lessing's "Emilia Galotti" — whether Raphael, 
had he been born without hands, would not the less have been the 
greatest of painters. Tlic photographic plate has been described as 
the true retina of the philosopher; and one migiit add, of the artist, if 
it were not unluckily almost color-blind. Unfortunately, theoretical 
reasons which exi)ericn<'e will hardly contradict render it highly im- 
probable that the expectations still entertained by artists and the gen- 
eral i)ublic, with regard to photography in natural colors, will ever be 
realized. 

Whether photography does not act unfovorably on the reproductive 
arts, such as engraving, lithography, and woodcutting, by taking their 
place to an increasing extent, remains to be proved. Its fidelity is cer- 
tainly such as, in a certain sense, to lower the value of the original 
drawings of old masters, by making them common property. An exhibi- 
tion, arranged by one of our art-dealers several years ago, of the best 
engravings of the "Madonna della Sedia," together with a i)hotograph 
from the original, first opened our eyes to the extent to which each 
master has end)odie(l in his copy his own individual conception. But 
even were i)hotography to cause such a retrogression in the reproduc- 
tive arts, of what imi)ortance would that be, compared to the immeasur- 
able services which, as a means of reproduction itself, it renders art, 
by disseminating the knowledge and enjoyment of artistic work of all 
kinds and periods? No one can fully estimate and appreciate what it 
has done to beantify and enrich our life, whose memory does not reach 
back into those, as it were, prehistoric times, "when man did not yet 
travel by steam, write and speak by lightning, and paint with the sun- 
beam.'' 

Is it credible, after all this, tliat there can be any need of mentioning 
the benefits derived by art from the study of anatomy? Has not the 
"Gladiator" of the Palazzo Borghese given rise to the conjecture that 
there were anatomical mysteries among the Greek artists, as the only 
means by which they could have obtained such complete mastery of the 
nude? Was it luit through incessant anatomical studies that Michael 
Angelo acquired the knowledge necessary for the unprecedented bold- 
ness of his attitudes and foreshortenings, which are still a source of ad- 
miration to anatomists such as Prof. Henke and Prof, von Briicke? 
Has not provision bi'cn made by all governments that methodically 
encourage art to atford to students an opportunity of training the eye on 
the dead subject to note what they will have to distinguish under the 
living skin? Have not three successive teachers, who afterwards be- 
came members of this academy, been intrusted with this important duty 
in Berlin? Finally, do Ave not possess excellent compendiums of anat- 
omy specially adapted to the use of artists? 

And yet the most renowned English art critic of the day, who in his 
country enjoys the reputation and veneration of a Lessing, and who 
lays down the law with even more assurance — Mr. John Buskin — 
explicitly forbids his pupils the study of anatomy in his lectures on 



676 ON THE RELATION OF NATURAL SCIENCE TO ART. 

"The Relation of Natural Scieuce to Art,'** given before the Univer- 
sity of Oxford. Even in the preface he deplores its pernicious influence 
on Mantegna and Diirer, as contrasted Avith Botticelli and Holbein, 
who kept free from it. "^ The habit of contemplating the anatomical 
structure of the human form," he continues, ^'is not only a hindrance, 
but a degradation, and has been essentially destructive to every school 
of art in which it has been practiced." According to him, it misleads 
painters, as for instance Diirer, to see and re]>resent nothing in the 
human face but the skull. The artist should " take every sort of view 
of animals, in fact, except one — the butcher's view. He is never to 
think of them as bones and meat." 

It would be Avaste of time and trouble to refute this false doctrine, 
and to set forth what an indispensable aid anatomy gives to artists, 
without which they are left to grope in the dark. It is all very well 
to trust one's own eyes, but it is better still to know, for instance, how 
the male and female skeleton differ; why the kneecap follows the direc- 
tion of the foot during extension, and not during flexion of the leg; 
why the profile of the upper arm during sui)ination of the hand difiers 
from that during pronation ; or how tlie folds and wrinkles of the face 
correspond to the muscles beneath. Campe's facial angle, though 
superceded for higher purposes by Prof. Virchow's basal angle, still 
reveals a world of information. It is hardly conceivable how, without 
knowledge of the skull, a forehead can be correctly modelled, or the 
shape of a forehead such as that of the '''Jupiter of Otricoli" or the 
" Hermes" be rightly understood. Of course fanciful exaggeration of 
anatomical forms may lead to abuse, as is frequently the case with 
Michael Angelo's successors ; however, there is no better remedy against 
the Michael Angelesque manner than earnest study of the real. Finally, 
a superficial knowledge of comparative anatomy helps artists to avoid 
such errors as an illustrious master once fell into, who gave the hind- 
leg of a horse one joint too many ; or such as amuses naturalists in the 
crocodile of the Fontaine Cuvier near the Jardin des Plantes, which 
turns its stiff neck so far back that the snout almost touches the flank. 

We are, however, less surprised at Mr. Euskin's opinions, on learn- 
ing that he similarly prohibits the study of the nude. It is to be con- 
fined to those parts of the body which health, custom, and decency 
permit to be left uncovered, a restriction which certainly renders 
anatomical studies somewhat superfluous. It is satisfactory to think 
that decency, custom, and health allowed the ancient Greeks more 
liberty in tliis res])ect. Fortunately, the English department of the 
Berlin International Exhibition four years ago lias convinced us that 
Mr. Euskin's dangerous paradoxes do not yet generally prevail, and 
that we are free to forget them in our admiration of Mr. Alma Tadema's 
and Mr. Herkomer's paintings. Nor could Mr. AValter Crane's charm-

iiijj^ illustrations, the delight of our nurseries, liaveT)een jtroduccd with- 
out (lisreji'ard of Mr. IJuskiii's ))r<'i»osterous doctrine. 

In the same lecture Mr. Jluskin opposes with the utmost vehemence 
the theory of evolution and natural selection, and the aesthetic rule 
founded on it, according to which vertebrate animals should not be 
represented with more than four legs. " Can any law be conceived," 
he says, "more arbitrary, or more apparently causeless f What 
strongly i)lanted three-legged animals there might have been! what 
systematically radiant five legged ones! what volatile six-winged ones! 
what circumspect seven-headed ones! Had Darwinism been true, we 
should long ago have si)lit our heads in two with foolish thinking, or 
thrust out, from above our covetous hearts, a hundred desirous arms 
and clutching hands, and changed ourselves into Briarean Cephalo- 
poda." 

Obviously, this false prophet has no notion of what in morphology is 
called a type. Can it be necessary to remind a countryman of Sir 
Richard Owen and Prof. Huxley that the body of every vertebrate ani- 
mal is based on a vertebral column, from which it derives its name, 
expanding at one end into a skull, reduced to a tail at the other, and 
surrounded before and behind by two bony girdles, the pectoral and 
the pelvic arches, from which depend the fore and hind limbs, with 
their typical joints? The very fact that i)aleontology has never known 
any form of vertebrate animal to depart from this type is in itself a 
striking argument in favor of the doctrine of evolution and against 
the assumption of separate acts of creation, there being no reason 
why a free creative power should have thus restricted itself. So little 
will nature deviate from the type once given that even deformities are 
traced back to it by teratology. They are not really monstrosities; 
not even those with a single eye in the middle of the forehead, which 
Prof. Exner takes to be prototypes of the Cyclops, Flaxman being cer- 
tainly mistaken in representing Polyphemus with three eyes — two nor- 
mal ones which are blind, and a third in the forehead. Real monstros- 
ities are those winged shapes of Eastern origin, invented by a riotous 
fancy while art was in its childhoo<l ; the bulls of Nimrud, the Harpies, 
i'egasus, the Si)hinx, the grillin, Artemis, Psyche, Notos of the Tower 
of Winds, the goddesses of Victory, and the angels of Semitic-Chris- 
tian origin. A third pair of extremities (Ezekiel even admits a fourth), 
is not only contrary to the type, but also irrational in a mechanical 
sense, there being net muscles to govern them. In the " Fight with the 
Dragon" Schiller has hai»pily avoided giving his monster the usual 
pair of wings; and in Retzsch's illustrations its shape agrees so far with 
comi)arative anatomy as to recall a Plesiosaurus or Zeuglodon returned 
to life and changed into a land animal; indeed, the resemblance be- 
tween those animals and the mythical dragon has led to the question 
whetlier the first human being might not have actually ga/ed ujton the 
last specimens of those extinct animal races. 



678 ON THE RELATION OF NATURAL SCIENCE TO ART. 

All abomiuatiou closely related to the wiuged beasts are the Cen- 
taurs, with two thoracic and abdominal cavities and a double set of 
viscera; the Cerberus and Hydra, with several heads on as many 
necks; and the warm-blooded Hipj)ocamps and Tritons, whose bodies, 
destitute of hind limbs, end in cold-blooded flsh — an anomaly which 
already shocked Horace. If they had at least a horizontal tail fin they 
might pass for a kind of whale. The cloven-footed faun is less intolerable ; 
from him our Satan inherited his horns, pointed ears, and hoofs, on ac- 
count of which Cuvier, in Franz von Kobell's witty apologue, ridicules 
him as an inoffensive vegetable feeder. The heraldic animals, such as 
the double eagle and the unicorn, have no artistic i)retensions, and 
their historical origin entitles them to an indulgence they would other- 
wise not deserve. 

It is a remarkable instance of the flexibility of our sense of beauty 
that, though saturated with morphological principles, our eye is no 
longer offended by some of these monstrosities, such as the winged 
Nike and the angels; and it would perhaps be pedantic, certainly in- 
effectual, to entirely condemn these traditional and more or less sym- 
bolical figures, though in fact the greatest masters of the best epochs 
have made very slight use of them. There are however limits to our 
toleration. Giants, as they occur in our Cigantomachia, with thighs 
turning half way down into serpents, which consequently rest, not upon 
two legs, but upon two vertebral columns ending in heads and endowed 
with special brains, spinal cords, hearts, and intestinal canals, special 
lungs, kidneys, and sense organs — these are, and always Avill be, the 
abhorrence of every morphologically trained eye. They prove that, if 
the sculptors of Pergamon surpassed their predecessors of the Periclean 
era in technical skill, they were certainly second to them in artistic re- 
finement. Perhaps they should be excused on the plea that tradition 
bound them to represent the giants with serpent legs. The Hippo- 
camps and Tritons, with horses' legs and flsh tails, which disflgure our 
Schlossbriicke, date from a period in which classical taste still reigned 
supreme, and morphological views w^ere still less widely diffused than 
at present. Let us therefore pardon Schinkel f<n^ designing or at least 
sanctioning them, as well as the winged horse and griffin on the roof 
of the Schauspielhaus, for which he must also be held responsible. But 
our indignation is justly aroused when a celebrated modern painter de- 
picts with crude realism such misshapen male and female monsters 
wallowing on rocks, or splashing about in the sea, their bodies ending 
in fat shiny salmon, with the seam between the human skin and the 
scaly cover scantily disguised. Such ultramarine marvels are wor- 
shii)pcd by the crowd as the creations of genius; then what a genius 
Hollen-Breughel must have been ! 

Curiously enough, the inhabitants of the caves of Perigord, the con- 
temporaries of the mammoth and musk ox in France, and thebushmen 
whose paintings were discovered by Prof. Fritsch, only represented as

faithfully as possiltle such auinials with which they were familiar; 
whereasthc Aztecs, a i)eoi)h',<)l'coui[)arativ('Iy hi^h civilization, indulged 
in fancies of more than Eastern hideousness. It would almost appear 
as if bad taste were associated with a middle stage of culture. 

With regard to the teaching of anatomy in schools of art, the above 
proves that it should not be confined to human osteology, myology, 
and the doctrine of locomotion alone, but that it should also endeavor— 
and the task is not ditlicult— to familiarize the student with the funda- 
mental principles of vertebral morphology. 

Botanists should in their turn point out such violations of the laws 
of the metamorphosis of plants as nuist, no doubt, frequently strike them 
in the acanthus arabesques, palmettos, rosettes, and scrolls handed 
down to us from the ancients. For obvious reasons, however, these 
can not affect them as painfully as malformations of men and animals, 
being in themselves repulsive to natural feelings, would the compara- 
tive anatomist. Moreover, a beneficial revolution has recently taken 
place in floral ornament. The displacement of Gothic art by the 
antique during the Kenaissance had led to a dearth of ideas in decora- 
tive art. The rich fancy and naive observation of nature displayed 
upon the capitals of many a cloister had gradually given way to a 
fixed conventionalism no longer founded on reality. Kauch, at Car- 
rara, in search of a model for tlie eagles on his monuments, was the 
first to turn to a golden eagle, accidentally captured on the spot, in- 
stead of to one of the statues of Jupiter. It was then that, towards 
the middle of the century, decorative art began to shake off its fetters, 
and, combining truthfulness with beauty, returned to the study and 
artistic reproduction of the living plants with which we are surrounded. 
In this respect the Japanese had long ago adopted a better course, and 
to them we have since become iiulebted for many suggestions. Thus 
highly welcome additions were made to the <lecoration of our homes 
and the ornaments of female dress. 

In one direction, however, it will be observed that men of science 
readily dispense with a strict observation of the laws of nature in art, 
at the risk of being charged with inconsistency. In works of art, both 
ancient and modern, fiying and soaring figures occur in thousands. 
These, no doubt, sin against the omnijiotent and deeply felt laws of 
gravity quite as much as the most loathsome creations of a depraved 
imagination against the principles of comjiarative anatomy, familiar 
only to a few adepts. Nevertheless they do not displease us. We pre- 
fer them without wings, because wings are contrary to the type, and 
could be of no use to them without an enormous bulk of muscle. But 
we do not mind the Madonna Sistina standing on clouds and the sub- 
ordinate figures kneeling on the same impossible ground. "Ezekiel's 
\'ision"' in the Palazzo Pitti is certainly less acceptable. But to quote 
modern examples, Flaxman's "(rods flying to the aid of the Trojans," 
or Cornelius's Apocalyptical riders, and Ai y Scheffer's divine Francesca

di Kiiuiui, with which Doie h.id in enter into hopeh'ss competitiou, are 
not the less enjoyable because they are physically impossible. We do 
not even object to Luini's representing the corpse of St. Catharine 
cariied through the air by angels, or to that of Sarpedon, in Flaxmau's 
drawing, by Sleep and ])eath. 

In an interesting lecture on the " Physiology of Flying and Soaring 
in the Fine Arts," Prof, Exner endeavors to explain why illustrations 
of men and animals in this condition, though impossible and never 
visible in real life, strike us as familiar and natural. I do not profess 
to agree entirely with the solution which he appears to i)refer. His 
idea is that our sensations in swimming, and the position in which we 
see persons above us in the water when diving, are similar to what we 
would experience in flying. Considering what a short time the art of 
swimming has been generally practiced by modern society, especially 
by ladies, who nevertheless appreciate flying figures just the same, 
doubts arise as to the correctness of Prof. Exner's explanation. To 
attribute the feel ing to atavism in a Darwinian sense, dating from a 
fish period in the development of man, seems rather far-fetched. And 
do not the sensations and aspect of a skater come much nearer to flying 
or soaring than those of a swimmer? 

Another remark of Prof. Exner, which had also occurred to me, 
appears more acceptable. It is, that under especially favorable bodily 
conditions we experience in our dreams the delicious illusion of flying. 
For 

"in each soul is born the pleasure 
Of yearning onward, upward, and away, 
When o'er our heads, lost in the vaulted azure, 
The lark sends down his flickering lay, 
When over crags and piny highlands 
The poising eagle slowly soars, 
And over plains and lakes and islands 
The crane sails by to other shores."* 

Who would not long, like Faust, to soar out and away towards the 
setting sun, and to see the silent world bathed in the evening rays of 
eternal light far beneath his feet? And when we long for anything, 
we love to hear of it, and to see it brought before us in image. Our 
desire to rise into the lether, and our pleasure in "Ascensions" and 
similar representations, are further enhanced by the ancient belief of 
mankind in the existence of celestial habitations for the blessed beyond 
the starry vault; a belief which Giordano Bruno put an end to, though 
not so thoroughly but that we are constantly forgetting how badly we 
should fare, were we actually to ascend into those vast, airless, icy 
regions, which even the swiftest eagle would take years to traverse 
before alighting on some probably uninhabitable sphere. 

We are now inclined to reverse the question, and to ask: What have

ON THE RELATION OF NATURAL SCIENCE TO ART. 681 

ous services? With tlie exception of external work, sncli as the repre- 
senting of natural objects, not muck else than the results obtained by 
painters as to the composition and combination of colors, which, how- 
ever, have not exercised as strong an influence on chromatics as music 
on acoustics. It is known that the Greeks possessed a canon of the 
l)roportions of the human body, attributed to Polycletes, which, as 
Prof. Merkel recently objected, uiduckily only applied to the full-giown 
frame, to the detriment of many ancient Avorks of art. The blank was 
not systematically fdled u{) till the time of Gottfried Schadow. This 
canon has since become the basis of a most promising branch of anthro- 
l)ology — anthropometry in its application to the human races. 

If the definition of art were stretched so far as to include the power of 
thinking and conceiving artistically, then, indeed, it would be easy 
enough to find relations and transitions between artists and philoso- 
phers, though, as we remarked at the beginning, their paths diverge so 
completely. But it is not so certain that natural science would neces- 
sarily be benefited by an artistic couceiition of its problems. The aberra- 
tion of science at the beginning of this century, known as German 
physiophilosophy owed its origin quite as much to aesthetics as to meta- 
physics, and the same erroneous principles guided Goethe in his scien- 
tific researches. The artistic conception of natural problems is in so 
far defective as it contents itself with well-rounded theoretical abstrac- 
tions instead of penetrating to the causal connection of events to the 
limits of our understanding. It may suffice in cases where analogies 
are to be recognized by a plastic imagination between certain organic 
forms, such as the structure of plants or vertebrate animals ; but it fails 
altogether in subjects, such as the theory of colors, because it stops 
short at the study of Avhat are supposed to be primordial phenomena 
instead of analyzing them mathematically and phyt^cally. Prof, von 
Briicke subsequently, by the aid of the undulatory theory, traced to 
their physical causes the colors of opaques on which Goethe founded 
his theory of colors and which to this day have tended rather to darken 
than to enlighten certain German intellects. The difference between 
artistic and scientific treatment becomes very evident in this example. 

Nevertheless, it can not be denied that articitic feeling may be useful 
to scientific men. There is an aesthetic aspect of experiment which 
strives to imi)art to it Mhat we have termed nuH'hanical beauty; and 
no experimenter will regret having responded to its demands as far as 
was in his power. Moreover, the transition from a literary to a scien- 
titic epoch in the intellectual devi'lopement of nations is accompanied 
by a tendency to brilliant delineation of natural phenomena, arising 
from the double influence of the setting and the dawning genius. In- 
stances thereof are Button and Bernardiu de Saint-Pierre in France, 
and Alexander von Humboldt in Germany, who, to his extreme old age, 
remained faithful to this tendency. In the course of time, this somewhat 
incongruous mixture of styles splits into two difterent manners. Pop-

ular teaching' ])resei'ves its ornaineiital cliaracter, while the results of 
scientific research only claim that kind of beauty which in literature 
corresponds to mechanical beauty. In this sense, as I long ago ven- 
tured to indicate here on a similar occasion, a strictly scientific paper 
may, in tasteful hands, be made as finished a piece of writing as a work 
of fiction. To strive after such perfection will always repay the trouble 
to men of science; for it is the best means of testing whether a chain 
of reasoning, embracing a series of observations and conclusions, is 
faultlessly complete. 

And this kind of beauty, which often graces, unconsciously and un- 
sought for, the utterances of genius, will no doubt be also found to 
adorn Leibnitz's writings.
