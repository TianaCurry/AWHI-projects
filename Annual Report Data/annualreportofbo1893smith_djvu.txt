THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM

I.— GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 

The work of the past year iu the Museum, though iu mauy respects 
unlike that of previous years, has nevertheless been the direct out- 
growth of the activities of more than half a century, and it seems but 
proper, before describing current operations, to speak briefly of the 
origin and history of the Museum, of its aims and methods, and of its 
relations to other national institutions, especially the Smithsonian 
Institution, under whose control it was placed at the time of its formal 
organization. 

A.— THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUSEUM. 

The history of origin and development has been discussed in previous 
reports, and in a paper entitled " The Genesis of the National Museum."* 
It will therefore be sufficient for our present purpose to rei)oat a few of 
the most essential facts. 

The idea of a national museum in the city of Washington was first 
suggested by the Hon. Joel E. Poinsett, of South Carolina, Secretary 
of War under President Van Buren, who in 1840 organized, for the 
purpose of establishing such a museum, a society called '' The National 
Institution," afterwards "The National Institute," which was for four 
years exceedingly prosperous and active. By this society the nucleus 
for a national nmseum was gathered in tlie J*atent Office building in 
Washington, and public opinion was educated to consider the estab- 
lishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the Govern- 
ment of the United States. In 1840, having failed in securing the 
public recognition at which it is aimed, the society became torpid, and 
eventually, in 1861, j)assed out of existence.

4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

In -lanuary, 1S47. the first Board of IJegeiits, after many weeks of 
consultation and deliberation over the plans for the organization of the 
Smithsonian Institution, unanimously voted the following resolution : 

Remlved, That it is tlie iLtentiou of tlie, act of Conj^ress, and in accordance with 
tlie design of Mr. Sniitlison, as expressed in his will, that one of the principal modes 
of execntinii the act and the trust is the accumulation of collections of specimens 
and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the gradual formation of a 
library of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge, to the 
end that a copious storehouse of materials of science, literature, and art may be 
provided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall 
assist the original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to 
the pursuit of any branch of knowledge.* 

From 1844 until ISoS, when the so-called "National Cabinet of Curi- 
osities" passed into the charge of the Smithsonian Institution, the 
term " National Museum " Avas not in use. From that time onward, 
however, it was used, unotticially, to designate the collections in the 
Smithsonian building. After the "National Cabinet" Avas delivered to 
the Kegents, appropriations were made by Congress for its maintenance. 
During the twenty-three years which followed, the collections were 
greatly increased and were made the subjects of numerous important 
memoirs upon the natural history and ethnology of America. The pub- 
lic halls, with their arrangement^ for the exhibition of a portion of the 
collection, also received a due share of attention, and a certain amount 
of instruction and pleasnre was aftbrded to visitors. The appropria- 
tions, however, were meagre, the space limited, and the "staff was so 
inadequate that little could be done except to keep the collections in 
good ])reservation. 

The broad jjlan upon which the operations of the National Museum 
are now conducted was, however, anticipated as far back as 1853, when 
Prof. Henry wiote: 

There can be little doubt that in due time ample provision will be made for a 
library and museum at the capital of this Union worthy of a Government whose 
perpetuity depends upon the virtue and intelligence of the people.! 

The difficulties attending the formation of such a museum were 
appreciated by Prof. Henry, who already in his report for 1849, had 
spoken with much emphasis of the caution required in assuming under 
the direction of the Institution the care of the national collections. 

Prof. Henry, in the report of the Institution for 1870,| again care- 
fully expressed his opinion as to the character which should be given 
to the National Museum. 

There is [he wrote] scarcely any subject connected with science and education to 
which more attention is given at the present day than that of collections of objects 
of nature and art, known under the general denomination of museums. This arises 
from their growing importance as aids to scientific investigation and instruction.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 6 

111 the report for 1S73 ullusion is made to the enoriiioiis increase 
iii tbe iiatioiial collections, "requiring- the utmost exertions of tbe 
limited force conueeted with tbe National jMuseum for its jn-oper treat- 
ment."'* 

Although tbe appropriations for tbe ]\luseuiii lia\e of late years been 
more liberal, it is certain that, on account of the immense annual 
increase in the quantity of material recei\ cd. (|uite as much care and 
caution is still needed. 

Tbe iSmithsonian Institution from its foundation Ibsteied explora- 
tions, and its Museum Mas enriched by the numerous ethnological and 
natural history objects brought home by the explorers. Many gifts 
were received from private sources, and valuable objects were depos- 
ited in its Museum for safe-keeping. Tbe nucleus of its collections 
was a small but valuable cabinet of luiuerals formed by tbe Foun<ler, 
James Smitbson, who was himself a chemist and mineralogist of good 
repute, and a Fellow of tbe Royal Society of London. 

At tbe time of the establishment of tbe Institution several naval 
expeditions and surveys of tbe public domain were being organized 
by tbe Government, and during their progress large collections of 
ethnological and natural history objects were made. Important for 
eign material was obtained by tbe Pacific Exidoiing Expedition, 
Perry's Expedition to Japan, and the other naval expeditions, while 
tbe naturalists attached to tbe Pacific Paiiroad Survey, tbe Mexican 
Boundary Survey, and tbe surveys under the Army Engineer Corps, 
brought together great collections illustrating the natural resources 
and ethnology of North America. 

A new source of growth, subsequent to 1871, was the exploration 
of tbe waters of North America, by the U. S. Fisb Commission, whose 
connection with the Institution has always been intimate. 

At tbe close of tbe Centennial Exhibition of 1876 tbeexliibitsof tbe 
United States Government, and those of numerous foreign govern- 
ments and of private exhibitors, came to tbe National Museum. 

A new period now began. Tbe storage rooms and exhibition balls 
of tbe Smithsonian building were already overfiowing- witb tbe accu- 
mulations of thirty years, and tbe small number of persons emi)loyed 
in caring for them were overburdened and unable to do the necessary 
work. Tbe scope of tbe collections bad become wider and a new and 
broader classification was found to be necessary. The growth of tbe 
country in wealth and culture was leading to tbe establishment of 
many local museums, and tbe educational influences flowing from these 
and from tbe Centennial Exhibition caused a demand for more eflicient 
methods of musiiem administration. 

The exhibition of 1876 had been indeed an event of great educational 
importance to tbe people of tbe United States; and not tbe least of its 



Report, Sniitbsouian lustitutiou, 1873, p. 48. 



6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUWEUM, 1893. 

good works was the lesson it taught as to the possibilities for good in 
public museums. 

The objects whidi at the close of the Ceutennial were given to the 
United States for its National Museum were of large intrinsic value, 
and were also very imi)ortant from the fact that the necessity of caring 
for them led to the erection of a large building for the expansion of the 
Museum itself. 

In 1881, after the new building had been completed, the Museum 
was entirely reorganized. 

In the early years Prof S. F. Baird, then Assistant Secretary, with 
two or three assistants, was able to give all necessary attention to the 
care of the collections, and the Museum was not formally divided into 
departments. 

When the reorganization was made in 1881, under the immediate care 
of the present Assistant Secretary, the diversity of the collections 
made it necessary to establish a number of departments, each of which 
was placed in charge of a curator, and the staff has since been con- 
stantly increasing. This is at present composed of the officer in charge 
and thirty-two curators and acting curators, twenty-two of whom 
receive no salary from the Museum. There are also eleven administra- 
tive offices, each under its own chief, while in connection witli the gen- 
eral work of administration there is in the Museum a library, a chemi- 
cal laboratory, a photographic laboratory, and various workshops for 
taxidermy, modeling, and for the preparation of skeletons for exhibi- 
tion. 

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 3IUSEUM IDEA. 

The history of the National Museum may, then, be divided into three 
periods : — 

First, that from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution to 
1857, during which time specimens were collected purely and solely to 
serve as materials for research, no special efforts being made to exhibit 
them to the public or to utilize them except as a foundation for scien- 
titic descrii)tion and theory. 

Second, the period from 1857, when the institution assumed the cus- 
tody of the " National Cabinet of Curiosities,'' to 187G. During this 
period the Museum became a place of deposit for scientific material 
which had already been studied, this material, so far as convenient, 
being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable, made to serve 
an educational purpose. 

Third, the present period, beginning in the year 187(5, within which the 
Museum has entered more fully into the work of gathering collections 
and exhibiting them on account of their value from an educational 
8tand])oint. 

In the first period the main object of the Museum was scientitic 
research: in the second, the establishment became a museum of record 



REPORT OF Ai^SISTANT S^ECRETARY. 7 

as well as of research, while in the tliinl period is growing up the idea 
of public education. 

Ill cloBiiig this general statement it may be well to mention what 
seetn to be the things detinitely accomplished since the time of reor- 
ganization in 1881. 

The definite steps of progress may be summarized as follows: 

(1) An organization of the ]\[useum stalf has been effected, efficient 
for present pur])oses and capable of expansion and extension as occa- 
sion may re(j[uire, and many capable museum-experts have been trained 
for work in other institutions. 

(2) Through the agency of this start' the materials in the Museum, 
the accumulations of nearly half a century, have been examined, classi- 
fied, and brought under control au<l arranged in such manner as to 
insure their safely and make them available for study. 

(3) The collections have been increased to more than fifteen-fold their 
former extent. 

(4) A considerable beginning lias been made toward the development 
of a well labeled and effectively installed exhibition series, available 
for the instruction of the public. 

(5) A thorough study of the organization and systems of classifica- 
tion in other museums throughout the world has been made, the results 
of which are beginning to appear in the work of the Museum staff and 
which will be made available for other institutions through a re^jort 
upon the principles and methods of museum administration, now in prep- 
aration. 

(6) Many new methods of installation have been developed by experi- 
ment in the Museum, and the best and most available employed else- 
where have been adopted. Our new methods are being adopted in 
many similar establishments at home and abroad. 

(7) The art of taxidermy and the making of museum models have 
been advanced and dignified by the policy adopted in the treatment of 
the experts in the employ of the Museum. 

(8) Science has been forwarded by the publication of some thousands 
of papers describing the materials in the Museum, Avhile the work of 
specialists in the production of these papers has greatly enhanced the 
value of the national collections. 

(9) Popular educational work of unquestionable value has been accom- 
plished by participation in great expositions in Philadeljjhia, Ueiiin, 
London, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Louisville, ^Madrid, and Chicago, 

(10) Hundreds of thousands of named specimens have been distrib- 
uted to other museums and to colleges and schools. 

THE POSSIBILITIES FOR THE FUTURE. 

It is evident that a National Museum worthy of the dignity of the 
nation must always be maintained in the city of Washington. 

Every country has a museum or groiq) of museums in its cajiital 



8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1«93. 

city — centers of scieiititic and educational activity — the treasure-house 
of tlie ])eoi)le, filled with memorials of national triumphs in the fields 
of science, art, and industrial progress.* 

These are legitimate objects of national pride, for upon the character 
of its museum and libraries intelligent persons visiting any country 
very i)roperly base their judgment as to the nature aiul degree of the 
civilization of the people. 

Washington may without question be made the seat of one of the 
greatest museums in the world. It nuiy perhaps be neither i^racticable 
nor desiiable to gather together in this city extensive collections of 
early works of art, but a representative series of such objects will 
undoubtedly grow up which will tend to educate the public taste, and 
l)roniote the study of the elements of art and the history of civiliza- 
tion, and forward the arts of design. Attention must, however, be 
directed mainly toward the exposition of the geology and natural 
history of America and its natural resouices, to the ])reservation of 
memorials of its aboriginal inhabitants, and the encouragement of the 
arts and industries of our own people. 

It is evident that the jSTational Museum of the United States will of 
necessity have features peculiar to itself developed in response to the 
l)eculiar needs of the people of this continent. It should be remem- 
bered that the national collections of every principal European nation 
aie divided into sev^eral groups, each uiuler separate administration, 
thongh often within the general control of some central authority. In 
France, for instance, most of the museums are under the ministry of pub- 
lic instruction, and in England, to a less extent, under the department 
of science and art. 

In the great capitals of Europe the i)ublic collections are scattered 
through various parts of the same city, in museums with distinctive 
names and independent in their organizations. ^luch of the work 
which should properly be done by such museums is omitted, because 
no one of them has seen fit to undertake it: while, on the other hand, 
mncli labor is duplicated, which is perhaps equally unfortunate, col- 
lections of similar scope and purpose being maintained in different i)arts 
of the same city. One of the chief objections to such division of eflbrt 
is that much of the value of large collections in any departnu^nt is lost 
by failure to concentrate them where they may be studied and com 
])ared side by side. In Washington the national collections are all. 
without exception, concentrated in one group of buildings. The Army 
Medical Museum now occupies a building' side by side with those under 
the control of the Smithsonian Institution, and this proximity, in con- 
nection with the long-established policy of cooperation between the 
two organizations, renders them, for all practical purposes, united in 
interest. 

' Most of the older nations have musenms devoted to their military achievements 
and trinmphs, but our country has no need or desire to enter into this iield of work. 



KEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECKETARV. 9 

Altlioujih the appropriations fioiii tlie public tieasuiy lor the maiu- 
teiiaiice of the National Museum are sniall, compared with tliose in 
several European e<tuntries, the value of objects given l)y private indi- 
viduals is proportionately larger. The actual value of such contribu- 
tions for ten years past, has not, it is estimated, fallen short of -Sl'O.OOO 
a year, and in some years has been greater. 

Among important gitts may be mentione<l such as the George Catlin 
Indian gallery, of inestimable value to the American historian and 
ethnologist; the Baird collection of Xorth American vertebrates; the 
collection bequeathed in 1SS7 by the late Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, con- 
taining, besides minerals and other objects, about l'U,U(»U conchological 
specimens, and appraised by the State at $10,000; the Bendire and 
Ealph collections of American birds' eggs given to the Smithsonian 
Institution; the Lacoe collection of fossil plants, and the collection 
of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for tlie transfer of 
which from Philadelphia to Washington a special apjtropriation was 
made by Congress. 

Some exceedingly valuable collections in this country and in Europe 
have been bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution which have not 
yet come into its i)ossession. It is estimated that within the })ast fifteen 
years individuals to the number of at least 2,000 h:i\e jnade gifts to 
the Museum to the value of $100 or more. 

Almost every day strangers, pleased with the work of the Museum, 
voluntarily send in contributions more or less important. 

The National Museum now contains over three millions of objects. 

The late Prof. Baird was once asked whether the value of the collec- 
tions in the iSTational Museum was equal to the amount which liad been 
expended in its maintenance. He replied unhesitatingly that, although 
it would be by no means a fair criteriou of their value, he did not doubt 
that by a judicious and careful system of sale the entire sum c(mld be 
recovered. What was said ten years ago by Prof. Baird is jnore than 
true to-day. 

One of the most striking features in the affairs of the Museum is the 
manner in which its collections are increasing. In 1893 tlie number of 
specimens is more than fifteen times as great as ten years before. 

In the last fiscal year 1,200 new lots or groui)s of s]iecimens were 
entered upon the Museum catalogues. 

This increase, as has been shown, is, in large degree, si)ontaneous, 
only a small amount of money having ever been available for the pur- 
chase of new material. 

As might be supposed, a consideralde i)roportion of the objects given 
are duplicates of material already on hand, and although these contri- 
butions can, with the utmost advantage, be used for distribution to 
museums and schools, they do not materially increase the value of the 
collections for study by sjiecialists and for general educational puri)oses. 
The need of a larger fniid for the purchase of specimens is yearly more

manifest. Exceedingly miportaut material is constantly offered at 
prices very much below what it would cost to obtain it by collecting, 
and in many instances, when refused, it is eagerly taken by the museums 
and institutions of Europe. 

The Museum in its present condition may be compared to a book from 
which Images here and theie have l)een omitted, so that the narrative is 
disjointed and incomplete. 

In certain museums of Europe more money is expended annually in 
purchases than is represented by the entire appropriations for tlie 
National Museum. There are instances even in this country in which 
more money is expended for the improvement of private museums. 
The ofticers of the Museum have repeatedly suffered the chagrin of 
being compelled to refuse the offer of s])ecimens necessary to complete 
the collections, and to see them pass into the hands of private insti- 
tutions in this country or the government museums in Europe. For 
the purchase of specimens for the South Kensington Museum, from 
1853 to 1887, 81,586,031 was expended, or a yearly average of nearly 
$17,000. 

England is equally liberal toward her other museums. Exact 
statistics are not at hand, but it is quite within bounds to assert that 
her average exj)enditures for the x^urchase of new objects for museums 
in London is not less than $500,000 a year. 

The museums of Europe are rich with the accumulations of cen- 
turies. The National Museum of the United States is young, and has 
enormous deficiencies in every department. It needs, more than any 
museum in Europe, the opportunity to increase its resources through 
purchase. The total amount expended for the purchase of specimens 
for the National Museum since its foundation has not exceeded $20,000, 
and never in one year more than $8,500. 

Our treasures are the result of the activities of an enlightened Govern- 
ment. Through a thousand channels materials for the formation of a 
museum come into the possession of the (Tovernment, and out of such 
materials our Museum has been built. A nuiseuni formed in this man- 
ner, however, suffers sooner or later from immense accumulations of 
objects of certain kinds and from the absence of others. This is true 
of the National Museum. At the outset no additions were unwelcome, 
and the expectation that all important deficiencies would be supplied 
might i)roperly be indulged in. As the years have passed, however, it 
has become more and more apparent that many of these deticiences can 
only be sui)plied by purchase. 

More striking present results might certainly have been attained by 
limiting the development of the Museum to si)ecial tields. We have, 
however, had in view the future as well as the present, and no object 
has been refused a place in the Museum which is likely to be needed 
even in the remote future, in the development of whatever gnind 
museum plans the nation may ultimately be willing to promote. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 11 

1>,._()RGANIZAT10N AKD SCOPE. 

The National jMuseuiii is uiuhM- the charjje of tlie Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, and its operations are supervised by the Board of Eegents of 
the Institution. 

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is by law the '* keeper 
of the Smithsonian Museum," and the Assistant Secretary, by the 
usage of nearly tifty years, its executive head. 

In the act of Congress passed in 184G to establish the Smithsonian 
Institution are contained the following provisions concerning the scope 
of the museum to be placed under its charge: 

1. The act above referred to provides that ''all objects of art and 
of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, 
plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging, or 
hereafter to belong, to the United States, which may be in the city 
of Washington," shall be delivered to theKegents of the Smithson- 
ian Institution, and together with new specimens obtained by 
exchange, donation, or otherwise, shall be so arranged and classified 
as best to facilitate examination and study. 

2. It provides that, in proportion as suitable arrangements can 
be made for their reception, these objects shall be delivered to such 
persons as may be authorized by the Board of Begeuts to receive 
them. 

.'>. It provides that they shall be arranged in such order and so 
classified as best to facilitate their examination and study. 

4. It provides that they shall thus be arranged in the building 
to be inclosed for the Institution. 

5. It authorizes the Regents to obtain new specimens, by exchange 
of duplicate specimens, and by gift, and directs also that they shall 
be appropriately classed and arranged. 

The National Museum thus became the authorized place of deposit 
for all objects of art, archa'ology, ethnology, natural history, miner- 
alogy, geology, etc., belonging to the United States or collected by any 
agency whatsoever for the Government of the United States, when no 
longer needed for investigations in progress. 

The collections in the ^Museum are intended to exhibit the natural 
and industrial resources, primarily of the United States and second- 
arily of other parts of the world, for purposes of comi)arison. 

The activities of the Museum are exerted especially in three 
directions : 

1. The permanent preservation of the collections already in its 
possession, which depends chiefly upon the vigilance of the curators 
and the skill of the preparators. 

2. The increase of the collections which are acipiired — 

(1) From the various Government surveys and expeditions, in 
accordance with law; 

(2) By gift from individuals, from other institutions, and from 
foreign governments; 

(o) By exchange for its duplicate specimens or publications: 
(4J By the efforts of officers of the Museum, who make collections

iu conuectiou with tbcir rejiular duties, or are detailed for special 
service of this nature; 

(5) Bj' purchase when appropriatious are made by Congress for 
that purpose. 

3. The utilization of the collectious, which is effected by exhibiting 
them to the public, and by encouraging investigations on the part of 
the officers of the Museum and other suitable persons, and facilitating 
the publication of tlie results; also by the distribution to other museums 
and educational institutions of duplicate specimens, which have formed 
the basis of scientific investigation, these being identified and labeled 
by the best authorities. 

The Museum by these means fulfills a threefold function : 

1. It becomes a rnKScuni of record, in which are preserved the mate- 
rial foundations of a very great number of memoirs — the types of 
numerous past investigations. This is especially the case with those 
materials which have served as a foundation for the numerous (iovern- 
mental reports upon the resources of the United States. Types of 
investigations made outside of the Museum are also incorporated. 

2. li becomes a miLscinu of rcscan-]!, by reason of the policy which 
aims to make its contents serve as fully as possible as a stimulus to 
and a foundation for the studies of scientific investigators. Kesearch 
is a necessary i)art of the work, in order that the collections may be 
properly identified and arranged. Its officers are selected for their 
capacity as investigators as well as for their ability as custodians, and 
its treasuries are open to the use of any trustworthy student. 

3. It becomes coi educational museum, by reason of its policy of illus- 
trating si)ecimens of every group of natural objects and, so far as it may 
prove practicable, sucli other collections as maybe found useful fi)r the 
instruction of the public, which are explained by displaying descriptive 
labels adapted to the popular mind, and by its policy of distributing its 
publications and its series of duplicates named, classified, and labeled. 

The collections of the National Museum are made up to a very large 
extent of the following materials: 

1. The natural history and anthropological collectious accumu- 
lated since 18r)0 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of 
the Smithsonian Institution. 

2. Collections which have resulted from explorations carried on 
more or less directly under the auspices of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution or resulting from explorations carried on by tlie Smithsonian 
Institution in connection with educational institutions or com- 
mercial establishments. 

3. Collections which have been obtained through the courtesy of 
the Department of State and the cooperation of United States 
ministers and consuls. 

4. The collection of the Wilkes exploring expedition, the Perry 
expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions. 

5. Collections nunle by the scientilic otiicers of (rovernment sur- 
veys, such as the Pacific Pailroad survey, the Mexican boundary 
survey, and the surveys carried on by the Engineer Corps of the

Exhibition at Philadelphia in ISTO; the tishery collections dis- 
l)layed by the United States at the International Fisheries Exhi- 
bition at Berlin in ISSO and at London in 1883, and the collections 
obtained from various local ex])ositions, as, for instance, the New 
Orleans Cotton Centennial l'^xi)osition in 1884 and in 1885, and the 
Cincinnati Exposition in 1887. 

9. The collections given by the governments of the several foreign 
nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition at 
Philadelphia in 187(*>. 

10. The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing 
aiul commercial houses of I'Airope and America at the time of the 
Philadeli>hia exhibition and subse(juently. 

11. The nmterials received, in exchange for dui)licate specimens, 
from museums iu Euro])e and America. 

iL*. Collections received as gifts, deposits, or in exchange, from 
individuals, numbering usually from 1,000 to 1,500 each year. 

In connection with the general work of administration there is in the 
Museum a library, a chemical laboratory, a photographic establishment, 
and various Avorkshops for taxidermy, modeling, and for the i)repara- 
tion of skeletons for exhibition. In connection with the department of 
art and industry two preparators are constantly employed. 

The publications of the jNIuseum consist of — 

1. The Annual Report; 

2. The Proceedings of the U. S. National ."Museum; 

3. The Bulletin of the U. S. National Museum: 

4. The series of Circulars. 

The Proceedings and Bulletins, have in part, been reprinted in the 
volumes of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. 

Papers i)re])ared by the ^Museum staff, or based upon the collections, 
have been ])rinted in every scientific i)eriodical in the United States 
and in many of those of Europe. 

THE RELATIONS OF THE MUSEUM TO THE 
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 

The Smithsonian Institution, though it bears the name of a private 
citizen and a foreigner, has been for nearly half a century one of the 
principal rallying [)oints of the scientific workers of America. It has 
also been intimately connected with very nniny of the most important 
scientific undertakings of the Government. 

Many wise and enlightened scholars have given to its service the 
best years of their lives, and some of the most eminent scientific men 



14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

our country has j;iven birth to have passed their entire lifetime in work 
for its success. Its publications, 1>7() in number, which when combined 
make up over 200 dijiiiitied volumes, are to be found in every important 
library in the world, and some of them, it is safe to say, on the working 
table of every scientific investigator in the world. 

Througii these books, through the reputation of the men who have 
worked for it and thnnigh it, and through the good accomplished by 
its system of international exchange, by means of which within the 
past forty two years 1,380,075 packages of books and other scientific 
and literary materials have been distributed to every region of the 
earth, it has acquired a reputation at least as far reaching as that of 
any other institution of learning in tlu' world. 

It is therefore representative of what is deemed in other lands the 
chief glory of this nation, for whatever may be thought in other coun- 
tries of American art. of American literature, or American institutions 
geneially, the science of America is accepted without (juestion as equal 
to the best. 

In the scientific journals of Great Britaiu and other European coun- 
tries the reader finds most appreciative reviews of the scientific publi- 
cations of the Smithsonian, the Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the 
Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture, and the Fish Com 
mission, and they are constantly holding up the Government of the 
United States as an example of what governments should do for the 
support of their scientific institutions. 

It is surely a legitimate source of ])ride to Americans that their work 
in science should be so thoroughly appreciated by other nations, and 
it is important that the reputation should be maintained. Nothing can 
be more in consonance with the spirit of our Government, nor more in 
accord with the injunction of WavShington in his Farewell Address, 
admiringly quoted by Sir Lyon Playfair in his address as president of 
the British Association for the Advancement of Science: 

Promote, then, as an object of pviinanj inijwrtauve. histitntious for the ficveral (lijf'iifiioii 
of JiHoicIedtje. 

In proportion as the Ktructitre of a t/orerunient f/irei force In public opinion it .should be 
enlightened. 

1^0 one has been able to show why Smithson selected the United 
States as the seat of his foundation. He had no acquaintances in Amer- 
ica, nor doeshe appear to have had any bt)oks relating to America except 
two. Rliees quotes from one of these (Travels through IS'orth America, 
by Isaac Weld, secretary of the Royal Society), a paragraph concerning 
Washington, then a small town of 5,000 inhabitants, in which it is pre- 
dicted that "the Federal city, as soon as navigation is perfected, will 
increase most rai)idly, and that at a future day, if the aftairs of the 
United States go on as rapidly as they have done, it will become the 
grand emporium of the West and rival in magnitude and splendor the 
cities of the whole w(»rld." 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15 

Inspired l>y a belief in the future greatness of the new nation, realiz- 
ing- that wliile the needs of Engkmd were well met by existing- organi- 
zations such as would not be likely to sjidng np for many years in a 
new, poor, and growing country, he founded in the new England an 
institution of learning, the civilizing power of which has been of incal- 
culable value. Who can attempt to say ^hat the condition of the 
United States would have been to-day without this bequest? 

In the words of ,lohn (^>uiiu'y Adams: 

(If all the foundations of cstalilislimeiits for 2)ioitK or (lidrildliic hacs irhiih erer aiynal- 
iscd the npirit of the aye or the coinprehensive hcnefu'eucv <f the founder, none can he 
named more deserving the approbation of mankind. 

The most important service, by far, which the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion has rendered to the nation has been from year to year since 184G — 
intangible but none the less a^jpreciable — by its constant cooperation 
with the Government, public institutions, and individuals in every 
enterprise, scientific or educational, which needed its advice, support, 
or aid from its resources. 

There have been, however, material results of its activities, the 
extent of Avhich can not fail to impress anyone who will look at them. 
The most imi)ortant of these are the library and the Museum, which 
have grown up under its fostering care. 

The Horary has been accumulated without aid from the Treasury of 
the United States, It has, in fact, been the result of an extensive sys- 
tem of exchanges, the publications of the Institution having been used 
to obtain similar publications from institutions of learning in all parts 
of the world. 

In return for its own publications the Instiiutioii has leceived the 
books which form its library. 

This library, consisting of more than a quarter of a million volumes 
and parts of volumes, has for over twenty years been deposited at the 
Ca[)itol as a portion of the Congressional Library and is constantly 
being increased. In the la.st fiscal year 37,982 titles were thus added 
to the national collection of books. 

Chiefly through its exchange system the Smithsonian had in 1805 
accumulated about 40,000 volumes, largely publications of learned 
societies, containing the record of the actual progress of the world in 
all that pertains to the mental and physical development of the human 
family, and affording the means of tracing the history of at least every 
branch of positive science since the days of re\ival of letters until the 
present time. 

These books, iii nniny instances gifts from old European libraries, 
and not to be obtained by purchase, formed even then one of the best 
collections of the kind in the world. 

The warning given bj' the lire of that year, and the fact that the 
greater portion of these volumes, being unl)ound and crowded into 
insufficient s])ace, could not be readily consulted, while the expense to 



16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1^93. 

be incurred for their biiidrng, enlarged room, and otlier purposes con- 
nected witli tbeir use, threatened to grow beyond the means of the 
Institution, appear to have been the moving causes wliich determined 
the Kegeuts to accept an arrangement by w-hich Congress was to place 
the Smithsonian Library with its own in the Capitol, subject to the 
right of the Kegents to withdraw the books on paying the charges of 
binding, etc. Owing to the same causes (which have affected the 
library^'of C<.ngress itself) these principal conditions, except as regards 
their custody in a fire-proof building, have never been fultilled." 

The books"^ are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though they 
have now increased from 40,000 to fully'250,000 volumes and parts of 
volumes, and form one of the most valuable collections of the kind in 
existence, they not only remain unbound, but in a far more crowded 
and inaccessible condition than they were before the transfer. 

This condition of affairs will happily soon be remedied. 

The purchasing power of the publications of the Institution, when 
offered in exchange, is far greater than that of money, and its benefit 
is exerted chiefly in behalf of the National Library, and also to a con- 
siderable extent in behalf of the National Museum. 

The amount expended during the past forty years from the private 
fund of the Institution in the publication of books for gr.ituitous dis- 
tribution has been fully half as much as the original Smithson bequest. 

These publications have had their influence for good in many ways, 
but, in addition to this, a library much more than equal in value to the 
outlay has, through their buying power, come into the possession of the 

nation. 

In addition to all this, a large amount of material has been acquued 
for the :^[useum by direct expenditure from the private fund of the 
Smithsonu.n Institution, llie value of the collections thus acquired is 
estimated to be more than e(iual to the whole amount of the Smithson 

bequest. 

The early history of the Museum was much like that of the library. 
It was not until 1858 that it became the auth(uized depository of the 
scientific collections of the Government, and it was not until after ISKJ 
that it was olhcially recognized as the National Museum of the United 

States. 

But for the provident forethought of the Smithsonian Institution, 
the United States would probably still be witlumt a reputable nucleus 

for a national museum. 

The relations of the Museum to the system of popular lectures, for 
many years established in Washington, which replaces the old Smith 
soman courses, once so intluenfial, and the assistance which it atibrds 
each year to students of science, is referred to elsewhere in this report. 

The Institution publishes many circulars giving information on scien- 
tific subjects, which are distributed gratuitously to those who write to 
make inquiries, and this system is being continually extended. In addi- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17 

tion to this, alaiffc correspoiuleiiceis caiTie<l on with i)e()ple in search of 
infoiinatiou on scientific topics. Probably (),()()() letters a year go out 
to people who write seeking to know the name of some object or other 
scientitic fact. IiKpiiries of this kind are always answered promptly and 
fully; and frequently, to intelligent inquirers, books are sent which will 
enable them to find out such names for themselves in future. This 
work has not onlj^ an educational value, but often a great economic 
inq)ortance as well; as, for instance, when some common mineral has 
been mistaken for one of value, some useless plant has been wrongly 
identified and supposed to be of service in medicine, or some harmless 
animal feared as noxious. 

The publications of the Institution and its dependencies reach every 
State and almost every county in the United States. A careful study 
of the subject, recently made by the president of one of the scientific 
societies in Washington, seems to indicate that there are several States 
which are reached by no scientific publications, whatever, except those 
distributed gratuitously by the Government. 

Speaking of the Smithsonian Institution proper, and not of the 
Museum or any other trust which it administers, it may be stated that 
nothing could be so desirable for the Institution as that Congress 
should examine for itself whether, on the whole, in the execution of 
the trust of Smithson, more has been given to the Government than 
has been received; for if, in attempting to increase and diffuse knowl- 
edge among mankind, the machinery of the Institution's action has 
been such that it has incidentally paid over to the Government the 
equivalent of much more than the whole original fund, these facts 
should surely be known to those who have to ask themselves in what 
spirit as well as for what purpose the Institution expends money placed 
in its charge. 

Mr. Langley has pointed out that '' although by the judicious 
administration of the Smithson fund nearly $1,500,000 — the fruits of 
its investment — have been applied during the past forty years to the 
advancement of science and education in America (in addition to the 
principal, $911,000, larger now than ever before), it should be remem- 
bered that the unrestricted income of the Institution is less than 
$50,000 a year, a sum much smaller in its power to effect results than 
ever in previous years." 

Can the United States fail to recognize its obligation to supplement 
liberally this private contribution for public good, especially if it be 
borne in mind that, as Mr. Langley has recently shown, the Institu- 
tion has left in perj)etual charge of the nation, in the Museum alone, 
property acquired out of its private fund (and to which it has appar- 
ently the same title) which is i)r()bably now more than ecpial in value to 
the whole amount of the Smithsonian bequest. 

Every museum has its special characteristics growing out of its form 
of organization, its location, scope, and financial and other resources.

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MTJSEUM, 1893. 

Tbe character of the National Museum is fundameiitallj' aftected by its 
connectiou with the Siuithsouiau Institution, its dependence upon Con- 
gress for appropriations annually, and the necessity, under existing 
laws, of its caring for all collections belonging to the Government. 

Of the connection of the Museum with the Smithsonian Institution, 
it should be said that it is in the highest degree advantageous. It 
should be borne in mind that it is essentially a Smithsonian museum, 
since, especially in lis earlier history, the Institution expended large 
sums of money in aiding explorations, with the distinct j^urpose of 
increasing the collections in certain directions, while of late years it 
has deposited all the valuable gifts and bequests of specimens it has 
received. It has had in addition, for nearly half a century, the use of 
the larger portion of the Smithsonian building, and what is of para- 
mount importance, the guidance and iutluence of the officers of the 
Institution, and the very valuable assistance of its numerous corre- 
spondents. 

C— THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. 

The work of the Museum, if it only performed the functions of an 
institution for scientific investigation, would be of sufficient value to 
justify its maintenance and extension. The Museum, however, not 
only performs these functions, but also does a very great deal to ren- 
der the resources of science available to the public at large. 

Prof. Huxley's definition of a museum is that it is "a consultative 
library of objects." 

The National Museum is a consultative library for the scientific man, 
and it is something more. It aims to be an agency for the instruction 
of the people of the whole country, and to keep especially in mind the 
needs of those whose lives are not occupied in the study of science. 

In a recent address befm-e the American Historical Association, I 
attempted to explain the idea of our work as follows: 

(1) That public institutions of learning are not intended for the few, 
but for the enlightenment and education of the masses. 

(2) That the public has a right to full participation in the results of 
the work of the scientific establishments which they are helping to 
maintain. 

(3) That one of the chief duties of the officers of these institutions 
is to provide means by which such results may be presented in an 
attractive as well as an intelligible fin-m. 

No scientific institution is more thoroughly committed to the work of 
the difiusion of knowledge than is the Smithsonian Institution, and no 
department of its activity has greater possibilities in this respect than 
is the Natiimal ^Museum. 

The ])enefits of the INIuseum are extended not only to the si)ecialists 
in its laboratories and to the hundreds of thousands of visitors from aii 
parts of the United States w^ho pass its doors each year, but to local 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETAKY. 19 

institutions and their visitors tlirougbout the country, through the dis- 
tribution of the duplicate specimens in the Museum, wliicli are made 
up into sets, accurately named, and distributed to schools and museums. 

In the next annual report it will l>c shown how many hundred thou- 
sands of objects have been thus distributed during the past twenty 
years. Every museum in the United States has profited in this way, 
and by its system of excliange the ^Museum has, while enriching itself, 
contributed largely to the stores of every important scientific museum 
in the world. 

Not only are specimens thus sent out, but aid is rendered in other 
ways. Within the last year not less than forty local museums in the 
United States were supplied with working idans of cases in use in the 
Museum, and similar sets of plans have been supplied within the past 
few years to national museums in other countries. 

Not only do the people of the country at large profit by the work of 
the Smithsonian, as made available to local institutions, but also to a 
very considerable extent directly and personally. 

The curator of each department in the Museum is expected to be an 
authority in his own line of work, and the knowledge of the whole staff 
of experts is thus j)laced without cost at the service of every citizen. 

It is much to be regretted that many specialists, intent chiefly upon 
the study of certain scientific problems in which they individually are 
absorbed, are disposed to neglect the claims of the educated public to 
the enjoyment and instruction which museums afford. They do not 
hesitate to say that scientific nuiseums should be administered for the 
benefit solely of persons engaged in research. Such men would find no 
welcome among us. 

At a recent meeting of professional naturalists an eminent investi- 
gator in natural science publicly expressed his opposition, to exhibiting 
certain scientific collections to "the gaping clowns who form the 
majority of the visitors to our museums." Such a spirit defeats its 
own i)urposes and such a remark deserves rebuke. The experience of 
Europe with its magnificent educational museums and the history of 
the several expositions in the United States should be quite sufficient 
to satisfy any one who has studied the matter, that the museum is an 
educational power of no slight potenc}'. 

The venerable director of the South Kensington Museum, the late Sir 
Philip CunlifieOwen, speaking from an experience of thirty-five years, 
not only in his own establishment, but in the work of building up the 
score of sister museums now under its wing, located in the various 
provincial towns of Great Britain, remarked to the writer: 

We educate our workiug peiiple iu the public schools, and give theui a love tor 
refiued and beautiful objects, and a desire for information. They leave school, enter 
town life, see onlj- dirty streets and monotonous rows of buildings, and have no way 
to gratify the tastes -which they have been forced to ac(iuire. It is as much the 
duty of the Government to provide them with museums and libraries for their higher 
education as it is to establish schools for their primary instructiou. 



20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

In the same couveisation, Sir Pliilip iusisted very strongly that a 
museiun not actnally engaged in edncational work of some kind could 
not long survive, and as an example of one sucli field of activity pointed 
to the great system of lectures and examinations connected with the 
Science and Art Department of the Council of Education, of which the 
South Kensington Museum is one of the chief agencies. 






II.— RECENT ADVANCES IN MUSEUM METHOD. 

The importauce of the Museuui as an a<;eiicy for the education of the 
young and for the culture and euligliteunient of the public in general 
is each year becoming better uuderstood. 

The control of all museums is passing out of the hands of mere care- 
takers, or showmen, and is being assumed by men of intelligence and 
enterprise, whose purpose it is to elevate this agency of public culture 
to a plane of higher usefulness. 

Museum-practice has become to such an extent an art that some 
years of training and experience in a well-organized general museum 
are almost essential. Intelligence, a liberal education, administrative 
ability, enthusiasm, and that special endowment which may be called 
"the museum sense'' are simply prerequisite qualifications. 

Any museum which employs an untrained curator must expect to pay 
the cost of his education in delays, experimental failures, and waste 
of material. 

A museum without intelligent, progressive, and well-trained cura- 
tors is as ineffective as a school without teachers, a library without 
a librarian, or a learned society without a working membershii) of 
learned men. 

Such facts as these are gradually becoming impressed upon the pub- 
lic mind,_ and although the community within which a given museum is 
located may not for a time concern itself actively about its shortcom- 
ings, all the good work which it does is at once appreciated, and if 
advances are in i^rogress, their results are eagerly awaited. 

The "Museums Association," recently organized in England, is doing 
excellent work in that country. Such an organization is perhaps not 
yet necessary in the United States, where local museums are so few, 
but in time one Avill doubtless be organized. In the meantime the 
American Society of Naturalists is so situated that it can perform a 
l)art of the work proper to such an organization. 

Sir W. H. Flower, the sui)erintendent of the British Museum of Nat- 
ural History, in his address at the last meeting of the "Museums Asso- 
ciation" remarked: 

Of the museums of the Uuitcd States of America much luay l)e('xpected, TJieyare 
starting ui) iu all directions, untramelled by the restrictions and traditions which 
envelope so many of our old institutions at home, and many admirable essays on 
museum -work have reached us from the other side of the Atlantic, from which it 
appears that the new idea has taken firm root there."

22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

It is gratifying to know That even in the smaller towns of Europe 
the ideals which we hold before ns in our work are appreciated and 
quoted. The "Brighton Herald" of August 18, 1894, contained the 
following editorial comment : 

All those remarkably constituted persons who maintain that we do not want a 
museum in Brighton would do well to read a well-written little brochure by Dr. 
Charles A. White, of the U. S. National Museum, entitled "The relations of biology 
to geological investigations." It is a philosophical subject, philosophically treated, 
demonstrating the important relation that museums hold to science and to civiliza- 
tion as centers of learning and conservatories of the evidence concerning acquired 
knowledge. Museums [he concludes] should not only be made safe treasure-houses 
of science, but they should be what their name implies, temples of study perpetually 
open to all investigators. 

In our own country the spirit' of museum extension is spreading, as 
is shown by such articles as that by Prof. Morse in the " Atlantic 
Monthly,*' entitled "If Public Libraries why not Public Museums," 
"which is reprinted iu a subsequent part of this report. It is the highest 
ambition of the National Museum to be associated actively in the work 
of museum reform, and to feel that we are standing shoulder to shoulder 
in this respect with the older institutions of Europe, and that this fact 
is recognized by them. 

As we have worked along from year to year, always striving to do 
the best thing possible under the circumstances, we have always taken 
first into consideration the plans in use in other museums, and have 
either cast them aside as unavailable, modified them for our own needs, 
or frankly adopted them. 

So it has come to pass that we have a large nuuiber of forms of cases 
and devices for installation, fitted to meet almost every need of museum 
or exposition administrators. These are always placed freely at the 
disposal of those who need them. Working drawings and photo- 
graphs of cases, and samples of fixtures of every kind are freely lent. 
When the museum has had made, for its own use, expensive tools, such 
as molds for specimen jars or pedestal tiles, or dies for corrugating 
metal for the sliding-racks of storage cases, these are placed without 
charge at the service of public institutions, and the use of blocks for 
illustrating reports is always accorded. 

In this way the entire resources and experience of the isational 
Museum are placed at the disposal of even the smallest country muse- 
ums, and this policy has, we hope, been very beneficial. 

In pursuance of this policy some of the most instructive of our recent 
experiments are described iu this report, in advance of a fuller discus- 
sion in a comprehensive work on the i^rinciples and methods of museum 
administration, which has been in preparation for some years. This is 
done with less hesitation because of the example set by Dr. A. B. Meyer, 
whose papers on the methods of the Royal Zoological and Anthropo- 
logical-Ethnographic Museum in Dresden have proved so interesting to 
all nuiseum workers, and who, rightly thinking that museums are 
doing too much in the way of experiment and too little in utilizing the

MUSETM CASES. 

Of all the practical (luestions which confront the museum adminis- 
trator those relating- to the form and construction of cases and the 
methods of interior fitting are among tlie most perplexing and, so fai" 
as the relationships of the nuiseum to the public are concerned, the most 
important. Each well-arranged case with its display of specimens and 
labels is a perpetual lecturer, and the thousands of such constantly on 
duty in every large museum have their effect upon a much larger num- 
ber of minds than the individual efforts of the scientific staff, no matter 
how industrious with their pens or in the lecture room. 

Ever since the occupation of our new building very special attention 
has been given to improving tlie cases, and a system, i)eculiar in the 
beginning to the National ]\[useum, though since adopted by others, has 
grown up — a sys'tem based upon a fixed and interchangeable unit of 
construction ; so that, to a very large degree, it is possible to transfer 
cases from one department to another. This fixed unit is the storage 
drawer or " unit drawer," 24 by 30 inches in dimensions (PI. 1, fig. 1). 
Modifications and extensions of this unit are very generally in use in 
many forms of cases, both for exhibition and storage. (PI. 1, fig. 2.) 

Exhibition cases, — The various kinds of cases now in use are indi- 
cated in a general way in the two accompanying plates. (Pis. 2 and 
3.) Fuller descriptions of the cases and their manner of construction 
will be reserved for a future report. It may be said, however, that the 
tendency has been toward the use of the very best of glass in the largest 
possible sizes, the woodwork being, as a rule, restricted to bases, corner 
pieces, and cornices. The to}) of the case — no matter what its size — is 
of glass. When possible, where two panes of glass are used in a single 
case front, a narrow metal connecting strip is used instead of a wooden 
bar. 

The theory which has led to the development of this form of case is 
that collections should be so arranged that each surface of glass, or 
each panel of a long case, stands by itself, its contents being grouped 
with reference to a general descriptive label, either placed in their 
midst or in the middle of the case-frame above. It is not considered 
legitimate to arrange series of specimens on long shelves extending 
from one end to the other in cases whose fronts are broken by i)anels 
(u- doors; but, as has been said before, each i)anel or door stands for 
itself, like the page of a book, the arrangement being without excep- 
tion from left to right, as in a book.

24 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

The breaking of the view of a specimen or an exhibit by a horizontal 
bar is also avoided, and when horizontal sash-bars are necessary (as 
in a cheap case Avhere small panes of ^^lass are used) the situation is 
relieved as much as possible by plai-ing a shelf behind this horizontal 
bar, so that it is in eft'ect a part of the shelf. 

The form of case with which we are at present best satisfied is shown 
in the illustrations of some of the groups of Indians. (Pis. 51 and 5l\) 
Where smaller objects are shown, a large proportion of the height of 
the case is occupied by the base in which "unit drawers" are fitted. 

We have also introduced an inexpensive and practical adjustment 
of the doors of the larger cases, by means of Avhicli these may be raised 
instead of swinging upon hinges, thus doing away with the exceedingly 
objectionable swinging doors, so undesirable in narrow aisles and so 
inconvenient to curators. With the new system the cost of the mechan- 
ical appliances for swinging the sash is almost compensated for by the 
saving in hinges, wrench-locks, clamping-bars, and special contrivances 
for dust-proofing. The general appearance of these cases is shown in 
the accompanying plate. (PI. 4.) 

So perfect is this adjustment that a glass door weighing more than 
one hundred pounds may be lifted with one finger. The complicated 
arrangement of cranks and levers used in many old-fashioned cases is 
entirely unnecessary. 

The advantages of iron and steel exhibition-cases have been urged 
with so much enthusiasm of late that it seeiiis i) roper to say that the 
question of the use of iron has been constantly under consideration 
here since 1879. All the different forms of iron cases have been studied, 
including the Dresden cases constructed by Prof. Meyer which were 
inspected by the writer in 1880, and the wooden-sheathed iron cases 
in the American Museum of Natural History in New York. This was 
before the .system of wooden cases, which we now use, had been 
adopted. When the new Museum building was finished, in 1881, the 
use of iron cases was practically decided upon, and sample cases were 
made, in general accordance with the Meyer plans. They were found, 
however, to be much more expensive than wooden cases, heavier, and 
less easy to adapt to si)ecial uses. They offered no material advantage, 
except, possibly, a greater durability. The limitations of iron in the 
matter of design are manifest, and the impossibility of securing the 
polished surfaces of wood, which add so much to the attractiveness of 
a museum case, was another reason against iron construction. 

Looking back fourteen years to the time when iron was rejected, no 
reason appears for regretting the decision then made. 

The use of Mexican or Frontier mahogany which is well known as 
softer and straighter grained than the West India variety so i)opular 
lor furniture, has been continued, and no other is so thoroughly suit- 
able, so far as color is concerned, though the oaks when used have, 
in other respects, given great satisfaction. When black cases are 
required, cherry wood is employed and an ebony finish added.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 25 

Some eases have been made in whicli corner pieces of wood or metal 

have been entirely dispensed uith, as in that containing the re],rodn<- 

tion ot the Bryant Memorial Vase (PI. 5). This inoeni.ms n.ethod 

requires mechanical skill <,f the highest quality, and the expense is so 

great that ,t is only justifiable in the case of very precious objects 

which require to be hermetically sealed. The cost of this special recep- 

tacle wasis?39y. It is the most expensive case, for its size, in this museum 

and IS an exceedingly beautiful piece of work. ' 

In tittmg cases with shelves the so-called - Gavit bracket," invented 

by I rot. Edward S. Morse, of thePeabody Museum, in 8aleni, which is 

supported upon racks secured to the side, of upright bars, in the back 

of the cases, has always been thoroughly satisfactory. In some instances 

where heavy objects, like minerals, are to be shelved and the (piestion 

of protection against insects is not involve<l the '-Jeuks bracket" 

which fits with a triangular knob into an aperture of similar shape in 

a metal plate secured to the back of the case, has been substituted 

Another kind of bracket support which seems to have great possi- 
bilities IS the invention of Mr. Henry Horan. It is constructed of iron 
pipe and is exceedingly light and strong. The essential features of 
this contrivance are shown in Plate 6. 

The use of clear, strong colors for backgrounds is continued the 
only changes having been in the direction of better and purer pioments 
Many experiments have been made and the number of colors used 
have been reduced to two-a maroon corresi)ouding to that custom- 
arily seen on the walls of art galleries, for large cases in brilliantly 
lighted halls where the installation is not crowded, and a light warm 
buft, somewhat resembling in tint the Solenhofen lithographic stone 
but somewhat warmer, in cases and halls where specimens are crowded 
or where much light is for any reason desirable. This luminous buff is 
also used very largely upon ceilings and the upper parts of walls 
while the maroon is used on walls up to the level of the tops of the 
cases, harmonizing admirably with the mahogany furniture. Glass 
shelves are used when possible, even in cases for natural history objects 
Theintluenceof the National Museum system of case construction 
and labeling was manifest everywhere throughont the American exhibits 
at the ^^ orkrs Fair, particularly in the Government budding, the Lib- 
eral Arts building, the Fisheries building (where Norway also had in 
part adopted our style), the Wcnnan's building, some of the State buihl- 
lugs, and particularly in the exlnbit of the Pennsylvania Kailroad, where 
our cases and labels were adopted un.ier the direction of one of our 
curators. 

Storage cases.-X modification of the English form of sliding mechan- 
ism, by means of which drawers of different dei)ths are used inter- 
changeably throughout a long series of storage cases, has been in use in 
the Museum since 1882. At least 30,000 of the standard .Irawers, 24 
by oO inches, are m use for the reception of minerals, fossils, and zoo- 



26 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

logical specimens (.f all kinds, as well as in the departments of ethnology 
and arclia'ology. 

Besides tliese tUere are over 10.000 unit boxes fitted with glass fronts, 
which also, when necessary, are worked into the same system. 

The storage case, from which the idea was originally taken, was, I 
believe, first invented by Prof. Strickland, of Cambridge, England, and 
afterwards modified by .Mr. Osbert Salvin. As at first constructed in 
the ^'ational Museum, the sliding strips in the storage cases were tri- 
angular pieces of hard wood, 1 inch in width and one-half inch wide 
at the top, sloping to one-eighth inch at the bottom. (PI. 7, fig. 3.) 
These were nailed horizontally close together upon each side of the case, 
whde in the grooves thus formed were received the corresi)ondiug strips 
nailed upon the two sides of each drawer— stri])s originally of the same 
size but trimmed slightly in order that they might run smoothly. 

The top, or thin edge, of the slide-strip was always placed 1 inch 
below the top of the unit drawer, or 2 inches below the top of the glass- 
covered unit box, and since the depth of these unit drawers and unit 
boxes was always an even number of inches, a drawer of any depth 
could be used, from 2 to 14 inches, and a corresponding drawer of any 
depth could be placed above or below it. Any compartment could thus 
be filled with unit drawers of any desired depth. 

The first improvement in this mechanism grew out of the desire to 
secure still greater tightness. The interior of the compartment was 
lined wifh zinc, and the strips were nailed on the inside of the zinc. 
This proved obiectiouable on account of the nail-holes. 

The next step was to make the slide-strips at the sides also of metal, 
and to accomplish this many experiments were tried, and finally 
arrangements were made with a firm in Philadelphia engaged in manu- 
facturing corrugated iron. It was necessary for the Museum to have 
especiallv constructed a set of dies and rolls for rolling the metal into 
the desired shape (PI. 7, fig. 1), and also to import Florence tin of extra- 
ordinary thickness, the kind ordinarily used in the United States not 
being sufficiently strong. This experiment proved satisfactory, and 
150 cases of this type have been for four years in use in the Museum, 
and have stood the test of wear. The only objections arise from the 
slight roughness where the sheets of tin are joined together, which IS not 

serious, and the fact that the outer ends of the metal ridges, which 
were of course hollow, had a tendency to bend when the drawers were 
drawn so far as to make a strong leverage upon the points. This, how- 
ever, has been satisfactorily remedied by the use of triangular plugs 
of hard wood, technically called "dutchmen." which are driven into 

the openings. . 

Out of these experiments still another form of storage case resulted, in 
which the metal was placed outside of the woodwork instead of inside, 
being soldered upon the outside of a substantial framework of wood, 
while the strips upon the inside were of wood arranged in a new way. 



Report of National Museum, 1893. 



Plate 7. 






REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 27 

Instead of se])arato triangular strips, 8-iuch boards of oak or ash, one- 
half inch in tliickness, are jtiluod and nailed close together ui)on the sides 
of these strips. In these boards are Avorked at intervals of every half 
inch grooves one-half inch in width and about one-half inch in depth. 
(PI. 7, fig. 2.) The side« of the case are thus provided with a series 
of parallel, liorizontal grooves separated by half-inch bars, which 
represent the triauguhir strips formerly described. To correspond to 
these grooves a new device is employed for the support of the trays. 
Instead of the strip which was formerly nailed at the side, the lower edge 
of the tray projects with a triangular section beyond the iilane of the 
sides, as shown in the diagram. (PI. 8, fig. 1.) This device is appli- 
cable to light drawers not over 4 inches in depth. The drawer of the 
old type, however, works advantageously in the same groove. 

In both the metal-lined and metal-covered cases, as just described, a 
very effective means of closing the front is secured by the use of rub- 
ber tubing fastened in a groove in the zinc-covered front edges of the 
opening, against which a solid wooden door is firmly pressed by means 
of a special form of combined bolt and lock, as shown in the accom- 
panying sketch.* (Fig. 1.) 

Many improvements have been made in the past ten years, not only 
in the sliding mechanism, but also in the methods of making the cases 
moth and dust-proof. 

One moth-proof case is a modification of the form originally devised 
by Mr. William Brewster, of Cambridge, Mass. 

The most jierfect example of the moth-proof case which has been pro- 
duced, is one especially modified from designs by Mr. J. S. Goldsmith, 
for the reception of the type specimens in the mammal collection. This 
case contains 8 drawers, 3 by 4 feet. Most of the drawers are 2 inches 
deep, but others of any required depth can be used. The drawers are 
of pine and have a solid wooden bottom, although one of three-ply 
veneer would doubtless be an improvement. The system of construction 
is that already described, with grooved wooden boards inside of a zinc 
cover. The drawers are provided with the ordinary triangular slide- 
strips. The frame of the case which supports the slide-ra(;ks inside is 
covered with zinc outside, and is of i^ine 3 inches wide and seven-eighths 
of an inch thick. The frame is covered with sheet-zinc, weighing 16 
ounces to the square yard. The zinc-covered case, which is 38 inches 
long, 51 inches wide, SIJ inches high, is then i)laced in a case of hard 
wood, whose dimensions in the clear inside are 2 inches longer and 2 
inches higher than the case, which, when pushed into place, fits against 
the back of the wooden case — the front edge of which projects about 3i 
inches beyond the outer edge«of the zinc case — but is separated by seven- 
eighths of an inch from its sides, bottom, and top. This space is filled 
by pine strips, 3 inches in width and sev^en eighths of an inch in thick- 



'Tlie text figures have been grouped into plates, following Plate 57.

iiess, wliifli are necessary for use in connection witli tbe device for diist- 
proofing-. 

The device for diist-i)rooflng is dependent upon a double door and a 
double system of rubber tubing. The system by which the double 
doors are made is shown in the accompanying- sketch (Fig. 2). These 
doors are separated by an air space of 2 inches. The inner one is of 
soft wood, paneled, and lined with zinc. The outer one is of hard wood, 
paneled. The pressure against the rubber tubing, which is necessary 
for absolute tightness, is secured by three sets of stubs and plates, at 
the bottom (Fig. .'>), and by two bolts, one in each corner above. These 
are so shaped that, when pressed, they have the effect of wedges (Fig. 4). 

The outer door has the same system of stubs and plates, and a rod 
lock of the ordinary type, fitted with a Yale key for the greater security 
of the precious contents. 

This case has been used for some months and has proved thoroughly 
satisfactory, being practically air tight, while its construction is such 
that it will doubtless be as good fifty years hence as it is now. 

Improvements have also been eftected in the construction of the unit 
drawers. At first these were joined at the corners by dovetailing. 
This proved unsatisfactory, and the device of " fingering '' was substi- 
tuted. (PI. 8, tig. 2.) The fingered corners have been secured in 
two ways, one by wooden dowels, the other by the ordinary process of 
gluing. The doweled trays were exceedingly strong and satisfactory, 
but it has been more convenient to use the other method and this is 
now exclusively employed. 

The bottoms, which are inserted in grooves about a (piarter of an inch 
from the bottom of the tray, are of three kinds: 

(1) Of pineK)r of poi)lar, seven-eighths of an inch in thickness, for the 
minerals and heavy specimens and three eighths of an inch for light 
specimens. 

(2) Of " three-ply veneer,'* such as is used for the seats of chairs and 
for the lining of cars and in other kinds of cabinetwork. These are 
made of three layers of very thin, straight-grained wood glued together, 
the central layer being of pine, the outer layers of ash, maple, or other 
hard wood. These layers are so adjusted that the grain of the 
center layer runs at riglit angles with that of the two outer layers. 
They are solidly glued together under heavy pressure, the thickness 
of the whole not exceeding a quarter of an inch. Although sonieM'hat 
more ex])ensive than the plain wooden bottoms, they are stronger and 
very nnich lighter and have the positive advantage of never cracking 
or shrinking. The i)lain bcttoms, it has been found, often shrink away 
from their attachments to the sides of the drawer, even when thoroughly 
kiln-dried lumber is used. INIany thousands of "three ply" bottoms 
are in use, and they have satisfactorily stood the test of hard use for 
ten years or more.

(3) Of paper. This form of bottom grew out of the desire for a 
lighter and cheaper form of tray.* in the early storage cases deep 
drawers were used, cliiefly for reasons of economy, and small pasteboard- 
bottomed trays, four of which covered the bottom of a unit drawer, 
were used to contain birdskins and other small objects, these being 
I)iled one above anotlier in several layers. This was inconvenient and 
detrimental to the specimens, and the real desideratum i>roved to be a 
liyht shallow drawer of moderate cost, in which specimens could be 
stored in a single layer. It should be said that the old system of deep 
drawers was also in part the outgrowth of the necessity for making 
the drawers themselves dust and moth proof. This was in the days 
before air-tight cases had been developed, and skins of birds and mam- 
mals were kept in glass-covered boxes, similar to the unit box. The 
development of the light paper-bottom tray was simultaneous with that 
of the m(>th-proof case. 

In the search for a light and durable drawer of this kind many 
experiments were made. The first stage was that of binders' board, 
then followed tin, then light three-x)ly veneering, then wire-gauze cov- 
ered with paper, then cotton cloth painted, then cotton cloth covered 
with paper, and finally the bottom made of paper alone. These bot- 
toms are made only in the Museum workshops, it never having been 
found ])0ssible to get a contractor sufficiently careful to furnish sat- 
isfactory drawers. The materials used and the process employed are 
as follows: 

Materials. — (1) Brown manila paper, 150 pounds to the ream. The 
size of each sheet (from which two bottoms are made) is 40 by 48 inches ; 
(2) common flour paste; (3) brown shellac of commerce, dissolved in 
alcohol. 

Tools. — The tools are a bookbinder's knife, a broad, flat paste brush, 
a stout wooden stretcher, 27 by 33 inches, which is the size of the bot- 
tom before it is trimmed. This stretcher is of pine, at least 1^ inches 
in thickness, in order to resist the strain of the shrinkage of the paper 
when drying. There should be, of course, a considerable number of 
these stretchers (PI. 9, fig. 1). 

The process. — A sheet of jiaper is jjasted to the large wooden stretcher,

repeated until four or live thicknesses of paper have been joined 
together, live thicknesses being necessary for the heaviest drawers. 
Each sheet, before being pasted on, is thoroughly soaked in water. The 
combined sheets thus forming the bottom of the drawer are then allowed 
to dry for twelve to twenty-four hours, according to the moisture of the 
atmosphere. The inside of the bottom of the drawer is then thoroughly 
coated with shellac. Then, without removing the sheets of paper from 
the stretcher, they are tacked to the bottom of the frame of the drawer 
with G-ouuce Swedish tacks, placed about a quarter of an inch apart 
(PI. 9, fig. 2), Then another sheet of i)aper is pasted over, thus cov- 
ering the heads of the tacks. This not only improves the appearance 
of the bottom, bnt prevents the tacks from drawing out. Then the 
bottom is also thoroughly shellacked, and the edges of the paper 
trimmed close to the edge of the drawer, which is then complete. The 
weight of the lightest 24 by 30-inch drawers for small bird skins, 2 
inches m depth, is about 31i ounces, and the cost is about 25 cents. 

The ordinary pine storage drawer, 3 inches in depth, costs on the 
average about 50 cents; a 4-inch drawer, 55 cents; a 5-inch drawer, 
60 cents, and so on in proportion. This, of course, refers to prices 
where a large number of them are madeby machinery at the same time. 

Another feature in our cases, peculiar to this Museum, it is believed, 
is that every case, no matter how large, is placed upon rollers, or can 
be lifted from the floor on adjustable rollers of various forms. Even 
the long wall cases, 9 feet in height, which have been recently con- 
structed, are made in sections, so that they can be moved without the 
assistance of carpenters. 

- The largest case in the Museum — that containing the group of buffa- 
loes — is undoubtedly the largest movable show case in the world. It is 
16 feet 6 inches l>y 12 feet 5j| inches by 11 feet 1§ inches in dimensions, 
and the weight of the case, with its contents, is about 9,300 i^ounds. This 
is supported on 10 rollers, which are of the kind used on the heaviest 
rolling idatforms in warehouses, and are made of iron, the wheels being 
4^ inches in diameter, with rims about 2 inches wide. They are of a 
pattern called the " anti-friction " castors, the bearing of the axle being 
upon an arrangement of several wheels. This case can be readily 
moved froin one end of the Museum to the other by eight men. 

There are other cases almost as large, and still others — in the mineral 
hall — much heavier in proportion to their size. The mineral storage 
case, 8 feet 6 inches long, 4 feet 4 inches wide, and 3 feet 3 inches high, 
filled with unit drawers, loaded with minerals, has an estimated weight 
of 2,000 pcmnds. Such cases as these are supported on 4 or 6 auti-fric- 
tion castors of the pattern and size just described, one at each corner, 
and can be moved bv four men.

Tlie ordinary lighter type of exhibition case is not provided with 
independent rollers, but can be raised by wooden trucks Avith rubber 
tires about 4h inches in diamet<n', and movable in every direction, like 
furniture castors. There is an attachment of levers so accnrately 
adjusted that a case full of bottles can be moved from one end of the 
building- to the other without disturbing labels or specimens. 

This system of tracks has been found of the greatest service in the 
exposition work, in which the Museum is often called upon to take part, 
since the cases can be arranged in cold or bad weather in sheltered, 
warm rooms, and carried to their places on the floor. 

Another form of case especiall}^ advantageous for exhibition work 
is what is called the "knockdown" case, in which the parts are fast- 
ened together by pins and escutcheons. These cases have all the per- 
manence and strength of fixed cases, and can be put together and 
taken apart with great celerity. 

MOUNTINGS FOR INDIVIDUAL SPECIMENS. 

One of the most convenient and ingenious devices is that invented 
by Prof. Merrill for placing geological specimens, jars, and other similar 
objects upon sloping shelves, in such a manner that both specimen and 
label shall be easily seen, while at the same time resting on a level 
surface; the objects are not in danger of sliding forward. This system 
is shown in the accompanying illnstration. (Fig. 5.) 

In the plate referred- to (PI. lU) the appearance of a number of speci- 
mens thus arranged uiion the shelves is shown, though not well. The 
arrangement of this case is in many respects one of the most satisfac- 
tory pieces of installation which has ever been effected in the National 
Museum. 

Each block or tablet has tacked to its front a small strip of tin, so 
bent as to receive and hold the label and to allow its ready removal 
when desired. This is painted the same color as the block, and is 
thereby rendered quite inconsi^icuous. To prevent the sliding of the 
specimens of the front row, which, in order to bring them below the 
level of those in the back row, are without blocks, a continuous strip 
of tin is tacked along the front edge of the shelf, bent as shown in the 
cut. The full width of the strip is the average width of the labels. In 
this series it is about one inch. The elevation of the back edge, which 
is to check the sliding of the specimens, is from one-eighth to one-fourth 
inch, while the front edge is folded over just sufficient to hold the label 
in i)lace, as before. 

Among the other devices which have recently been adopted in the 
department of geology two may be mentioned: 

The first is the curator's plan for showing the appearance of a cave by 
setting up in its natural position a miniature grotto, with diminutive 
stalactites and stalagmites, which he was so fortunate as to secure from 
the Marengo Cave, in Indiana (PI. 11), placing at the sides of the 



32 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

case mirrors by whose reflections the general effect of an extended 
miniature cave is produced. This is a very effective way of mount- 
ing' exhibits, and the use of the mirrors seems to be an aid to the imagi- 
nation of visitors, especially to young people who have never seen a 
cavern. 

Another is for storing the great series of microscope slides of thin 
sections of rocks which belongs to this dc])artment. It is thus described 
by l»rof. Merrill : 

As it happened, we had in stock a nnniber of pasteboard boxes, sonic 03 mm. -wide, 
143 mm. lonji, and 48 mm. deep, all inside measurements. Tbe dimensions of our 
standard slide are 48 by 1.'8 mm. By means of two wooden partitions some 3 mm. 
thick, running lengthwise, each box was divided into three equal compartments, the 
partitions being hekl in place by glue reinforced by two small tacks at each end. 
Heavy manila wrapping paper, such as we also had in stock, was then cut into 
strips 25 mm. wide and as long as the sheet of paper would allow, in this case about 
7 feet. These strips were theu bent into a series of folds, as shown in the accom- 
panying illnstrati(m, the apices being rounded, not pinched flat. If carefully done, 
the folds when crowded gently together act as a spring. Two of these folded strips 
were then placed lengthwise in each compartment, and the slides introduced, stand- 
ing on end, between the folds at the top. A box as thus prepared readily holds 3 
rows of 50 slides in a row, or 150 altogether. 

Each slide is separated from its neighbor in the same row by a double thickness 
of manila paper, which, owing to its manner of folding, acts as a spring, and avoids 
all possible danger of breakage. When all the compartments are tilled, the space 
between the tops of the slides in any row is but about 2 mm., but there is, neverthe- 
less, no difiSculty in removing a slide or in getting at it to read the label without 
removal, since, owing to the yielding nature of the paper, the top may be readily 
drawn apart. In this respect the box ofl'ers a great advantage over those with rigid 
compartments, such as are commonly in use. The first box was made merely as an 
experiment. It proved so satisfactory that, for the time being at least, it is the form 
adopted for storing the several thousand slides forming the museum collections. 

I have attempted to show the arrangement as above described in the accompany- 
ing drawing (Fig. 6). In reality the slides are held much more firmly than indi- 
cated, since the paper bulges and comes against both the front and back of the 
slides the full length of the fold, instead of merely at the bottom. It will very 
likely strike the reader that a better material than paper might be found. I can 
only state that after considerable experimenting the paper was, all things consid- 
ered, found most satisfactory.* 

The adoption of unglazed tiles, instead of wooden or paper blocksj 
to support minerals, shells, and other small objects, is being considered, 
and experiments, the result ot which will be announced later, are being 
made by Mr. Charles Schuchert, of the Paleontological Department. 
These tiles are rectangular, and of a soft buff' color, corresponding 
closely to one of the standard shades used in the interior of our cases. 

A form of exhibition tray which has been in use for a number of 
years is provided with a bevel front of peculiar construction, as shown 
in the accompanying plate (PI. 32). These trays are covered with 
black binder's-board, and a piece of colored paper or fabric is placed 
on the bottom. This form of tray may replace the very objectionable

and unsightly pasteboard tray, usually white, wiiicli is so often seen in 
collections of shells, iiiiuerals, and fossils. Jt is i)articularly well 
suited for coins and other single objects which it is desired to dig- 
nify by i)laciug on a special mount with a i)leasing back-ground. 

The tray of sheet iron used in the Dresden Museum is nmch stronger 
than the pasteboard tray custonuirily used in other ninseunis, and for 
large study collections is undoubtedly preferable, although less desir- 
able for exhibition i)nrposes. 

For very precious objects, such as small bronzes, ivory carvings, and 
small examples of metal-work, which lie Hat upon the slielves, or at the 
bottom of table case, our curat(ns occasioiuilly use cushions of maroon 
or dark blue plush, bound with silk cord; this, however, is a refine- 
ment in installation which is not recommended for use except in very 
si)ecial cases, as when it is desired to install a loan or gift collection 
very elaborately, or when the objects exhibited are of the greatest 
intrinsic worth. 8uch cushions may l)e used to excellent advantage 
on glass shelves. 

EXHIBITION .TAR8. 

The necessity for rectangular jars for the exhibition of alcoholic 
preparations has long been felt, and for many years our people have 
been in conference with the glass-blowers concerning thein ; but the 
difficulties in the way of securing satisfactory results seem almost 
insuperable. 

The most desirable form of rectangular jar — one with a wide aperture 
of the "salt mouth" pattern — seems to be unobtainable. This is to be 
regretted, since a Jar which can be closed with a circular ground-glass 
stopi^er is the most convenient for museum purposes. The plan of a 
round opening closed by a stopper was proposed, and experiments 
were nmde for improving the ordinary type of anatomical receptacle, 
long in use in this country as w^ell as in Euroi)e. in which the large 
opening at the top is closed by a tiat plate. Such receptacles as this 
have been used for a number of years in the Museum of Comparative 
Zoology and in the Army Medical Museum, and they have also long 
been in use in Europe, both for round and rectangular vessels. 

A modification of this device, by Mr. James E. Benedict, is described 
as follows : 

The lip is ground to a perfect plane, and the opening, closed by a 
sheet of glass aunointed with vaseline, is held in place by a cover which 
just completes the rectangular shape of the jar, its edges filling the 
shoulder, which is blown on the onter margin of the top of the jar, as 
shown in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 7). This cap is sufficiently 
heavy to hold tlie cover plate in i)lace, and it takes the place of 
the unsightly mechanical claini)s of the Jar customarily used in 
museums for anatomical prei)arations. The arrangement is thor- 
oughly satisfactory for exhibition purposes, and the cover being made

34 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

of common Aviiidow ^lass, which is somewhat irieguhir in its surfaces, 
enough small openings occur arouud the edges for the escape of 
gases, so that the somewhat unsightly vent-hole, usually made in 
hermetically sealed jars to allow the escape of gas and the introduc- 
tion of alcohol without removing the luting, is dispensed with. 

The most serious difficulty, however, has not been in regard to the 
cover, but rather in securing at the front of the jar a face sufficiently 
smooth and well polished to display the specimens clearly and without 
distortion. Some of the samples made for us by the glass maiuifac- 
turers had this surface polished on the buffing wheel; but the grinding 
was not sufficient to remove the inequalities in the glass, and the cor- 
ners, furthermore, are not rectangular, but rounded to such a degree 
as to cause some distortion of the specimens. Besides this, these are 
irregular and unsightly, and even to secure this imperfect result the 
glass is so thick that its transparency is somewliat impaired. This 
method of polishing the front surface of the receptacle has been used 
also in Euroi)e. It is an alleviation l)ut not a remedj^ for the evil, 
and, furthermore, is exceedingly expensive and beyond the reach of 
a museum which has to provide for a large number of wet prepara- 
tions. Jars of this type, made in Edinburgh, are used in the Army 
Medical Museum in Washington. The cost of these jars, 9 by 12 inches, 
at the factory was about $105 a dozen. A firm in this country' tried to 
produce jars somewhat similar, but was unable to make them at this 
price. 

Every important factory in the United States which would under- 
take work of this class has been consulted, and Mr. Benedict w^as 
sent on a special mission to visit them and study in person the possi- 
bilities. He soon became satisfied that in the present state of the 
glass-blowing industrj' nothing more can be done with blown jars, 
and began investigations in another direction. 

Experiments have been made by Mr. Benedict with a view to the 
possibility of building receptacles out of plate glass. Something of this 
kind had already been tried in Germany, with receptacles in metal 
frames, and constructed on the i)rinciple of an aquarium tank. The 
2)lan adopted here has been to dispense with entirely metal, and 
to use silicate cements which are insoluble in preservative tiuids, and 
which unite so closely with the glass as to become, practically, a part of 
it. The recipes for these cements used are, unfortuimtely, the property 
•of private individuals. In the process of manufacture the recepta- 
cles are exposed to a heat of 350"^ F. for several hours. It is impossible 
at the time of writing to say with certainty that these experiments have 
been successful, although one large jar has been filled with alcohol and 
specimens for eleven months and twelve others for six months. In jars 
of this particular form the top is made of two pieces of plate glass, the 
lower one being smaller, and so attached to the other as to form a 
shoulder all around; and the cover thus formed is luted to the opening

with vaseline. The junction tlius loriiu'd is so perfect that it is neces- 
sary to have a vent-hole in the toj), thouiih much smaller than is custom- 
ary, it l)eing only one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter. Jars made in 
this way, of the size already alluded to as costing- more than §100 a 
dozen, can certainly be had for a little more than half the price and, if 
they prove permanent, will be iu every respect better. 

Photographs have been made from jars filled with alcohol and speci- 
mens, and the peculiarities of the two systems are shown without dis- 
tortion or exaggeration iu the accompanying plates (Pis. 13 and 14). 

A small built-up jar, made in Germany, has been in use in the Army 
Medical Museum and elsewhere as an accessory to the microscope. 
These jars will hold all liquids and acids used in microscopic work, 
and careful examination shows that the cement used is subjected to a 
vitrifying heat. The use of hot water in the jars breaks them in the 
corners, which uuike natural lines of cleavage. Just how large a jar 
can be made in this way we have no information, but some of the 
ex])eriments tried by us demonstrate that thej' are not as reliable as 
those nmde with cemented corners. 

A convenient way of mounting specimens for the rectangular jars is 
shown in fig. 8. The fish or other object to be mounted is fastened to 
a pane of common Avindow glass by means of threads passed through 
the object, ordinarily by the use of a surgeon's needle. These are 
drawn through holes bored in the glass at the proper places, and 
fastened by breaking off a soft wooden peg in the hole, biting and fas- 
tening the thread in place. The holes are readily bored by aid of a 
solution of turj)entine and camphor used as a lubricant, and a small file 
as a drill, held in a small drilling macbine. Any jeweler's supi)ly store 
can furnish the requisite material. 

THE PREPARATION OF LABELS. 

The preparation of labels is one of the most difticult tasks of the 
museum man. The selection of the descriptive matter to be printed 
requires the best of judgment and the widest and most accurate 
information; while to determine the form and size of the ditt'erent 
labels in a series, and to secure the best typographic effect, is equally 
difficult, and requires abilities of quite a different order. 

A label may contain a vast amount of exact and valuable informa- 
tion, and yet, by reason of faulty literary and typographic arrange- 
ment, have as little significance and value as a piece of blank ])aper. 

Before a specialist is prepared to label a collection he must be a 
complete master of the subject which the collection is intended to illus- 
trate. After he has written the series of labels, if the collection is 
coniplete, he will have the material under control which would enable 
him to write a very complete book of reference upon the subject. 

No task is more exacting than label writing. Not only is it impossi- 
ble to conceal any lack of precise knowledge, but the information must 



36 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

be conveyed in a terse, concise, and definite i)liraseol<)gy, such as is 
not demanded in any other chiss of writing, unless it may be the ijrepa- 
ratiou of definitions for a dictionary. lie who writes definitions for a 
dictionary, liowever, lias usually the advantage of having before him 
numerous other definitions of the same term, which he needs only to 
collate and rearrange. A good descriptive label, furthermore, should 
do something more than impart information. It should be so phrased 
as to excite the interest of the i)erson who is examining the specimen 
to which it is attached; to call his attention to the i)oints which it is 
most important that he should observe; to give him the information 
which he most needs while looking at. the specimen, and to refer him 
to the books by means of which he can, if so disposed, learn all that is 
known upon the subject illustrated. 

The labels describing the specimens in a collection are intended to 
take the place of the curator of the collection when it is impossible for 
him to personally exhibit the objects and explain their meaning. 
When collections were small and visitors were lew, the curator or 
owner of a cabinet was accustomed, in i)erson, to conduct visitors 
among the cases, to take the specimens in his hand, to tell their names 
and where they came from, to indicate features of special interest, and 
to answer questions. 

This was in some respects an ideal way, when the curator was a man 
of wide knowledge and so much of an enthusiast that he took pleasure 
in talking without limit. The method was not without defects, how- 
ever, since the lecturer (for such he Avas, in fact) selected for exhibi- 
tion a limited number of objects which interested him, or which he 
supposed might interest the visitors, and gave the latter no chance for 
selection. Furthermore, the arrangement could not be such as to con- 
vey a seciuence of ideas, such as a selected ami well labeled series of 
specimens can do, and the spoken descriptions, being as a rule full of 
unfamiliar words, were not remembered. The printed label of to-day 
may be read over again and again, and is often copied into the visitor's 
notebook. Again, under the old system, examining a collection was 
looked upon rather in the light of amusement than of study, and what 
might have been possible in the way of instruction was rarely 
attempted. 

In these days, when the curator attemi)ts verbal instruction, it is by 
means of a lecture delivered in the ^luseum lecture hall, or, if a floor- 
lecture, among the cases, surrounded by scores or hundreds of audi- 
tors, wlio may either take notes or find the substance of the lecture in 
some syll;il)us or printed text-book. 

While one visitor might listen to the Museum lectures, tens of 
thousands pass through the halls without a guide. They must depend 
entirely upon the labels for information; for guidebooks, if such have 
been printed, are rarely bought, still more rarely used in the presence 
of the specimens, and, though often taken home with the intention of

studying tli<'iii. aio only in the rarest instances ever opened after tlieir 
l)nrcliaser lias left the Museum. 

The t'uMctioii of the label, then, is a most important one, since it is 
practically only through the aid of the labels that visitors derive any 
benefit whatever from a visit to a museum. 

What has already been said indicates in a general way the oftice of 
the descriptive label, and may be exi)ressed more concisely as follows : 

The label must — 

(1) Tell the lumu' of theohject; its exact and technical name always, 
and if there be one, its common name. 

(2) It must call attention to the features which it is imixtrtant for 
the visitor to notice. 

(3) It must explain its meaning audits lelations to the other objects 
in the series. If it accompanies a natural history specimen, it should 
explain its geographical distribution, which, if possible, sh<)uld be 
plotted on a small map. forming part of the label, and mentioning 
peculiarities of structure or habit.* 

If an ethnological object, then its uses and construction should be 
explained, its materials named if they are not obvious, and supple- 
mentary information given by means of pictures ; and. where pictures 
are better than words, these may be substituted. 

(4) The exact locality, date of collection, and source of the S])ecimeu 
exibited should be mentioned. 

(5) For the convenience of visitors it is well, in many cases, to give 
the dimensions or weight of the specimen. 

The art of label writing is in its infancy, and there are doubtless pos- 
sibilities of educational results through the agencj' of labels and speci- 
mens which are not as yet at all understood. It is clear, however, that 
the advice of the negro cook in regard to nuiking .soup applies equally 
well to a good label ; to wit, that much more de})ends on what you leave 
out than on what you put in. The value of this method of instruction 
is perhaps better understood by the most advanced writers of school 
text books and dictioiiaries than even by the average nuiseum worker. 

In Dr. Edwaid Eggieston's new " School History of the Tuited States," 
engravings are plentifully interspersed through the text, as well as in 
the margins, — portraits, pictures of historical localities, buildings, cos- 
tumes, and archieological objects; — and each of these has a label of the 
museum type, surrounded by rules, and separated from the text with 
which it has usually only incidental relationship. The originals which 
are thus illustrated, if brought together would make an admirable 



* We have used in tlie National Museum, in years gone by, labels of ditierent 
colors to indicate gei)s;raphical sources, and have also used lor the same purpose 
labels with printed borders of ditfereut colors. This, liowever. has long since been 
abandoned as cumbersome and impracticable. In most cases a word upon the label 
is sufficient to convey tliis idea. Hut when it is desired to convey fuller information, 
a map has great possibilities, for even the exact rang«' of each species may be shown

museum of Ainerioau liistoiy. and tbe book itself could hardly be 
improved u])oii as a handbook to sneh a collection. 

The modern illustrated dictionary owes much of its success to the 
adoption of museum methods, due, perhaps, to the fact that so many 
men, trained in museum work, have been engaged upon the preparation 
of the latest American publications of this kind, the Century Diction- 
ary aud the more recently published Standard Dictionary. These 
works impart instruction by methods very similar to those in use in 
museums, except that they are placed much at a disadvantage by reason 
of their alphabetical arrangement. 

There is, of course, one respect in which the museum exhibition-case 
has the advantage over the lecturer, who can only present one subject 
at a time, or over the writer of books, who is i)re vented by the size 
of his pages from bringing a large number of ideas into view at once. 
This difficulty has been in part overcome by the editor of the Standard 
Dictionary, in the large plates, where are shown, in one case all the 
princii)al \arieties of precious stones; in another plate, all the races of 
the domesticated dog, and in another, the badges of orders of chivalry. 
Even this, however, is far from reaching the possibility possessed by 
the Museum (with its broad expanses of exhibition cases) of showing a 
large number of objects so arranged as to exhibittheir mutual relation- 
ship, and so labeled as to explain the method of their arrangement. 

As has already been said, the size and typography of the label are of 
the greatest importance. The best written label may be ruined by the 
printer. Not only must the letters be large enough to be legible from 
the customary point of view, but the type must be pleasing in form, 
and so arranged as to lead the eye of the reader with pleasure from 
one line to another, and so broken into paragraphs as to separate from 
each other the topics discussed. 

Furthermore, a system of subordinate sizes of type is essential, so 
that the most important facts will tirst meet the eye. In many of the 
labels shown in the accompanying illustrations type of four or live dif- 
ferent sizes is used, the largest giving the name of the object, the next 
size the name of locality and donor, the next its distribution, and so on, 
much in the order of importance of the topics already proposed, while 
the least essential illustrative matter at the bottom of the label is placed 
in the smallest tyi)e. The theory is that the largest type should give 
the information desired by the greatest number of visitors — by every 
one; the next size, that needed by those who are studying the collection 
in a more leisurely way, and so on. 

Too nuich can not be said of the necessity of breaking the descrip- 
tive matter into short paiagraphs, which should never be more than 
half a square in length. Where a label of great width is printed, it is 
our experience that it is l)etter to arrange the matter in two columns, 
as is shown in one of the accompanying plates, rather than to weary 
the eye by requiring it to follow back and fro across the card.

The Great Auk was tormerly common on the coast of Iceland, and 
found in vast numbers off the coast of Newfoundland, especially at 
Funk Island. 

It formed an important article of food for the early na\igators and 
fishermen. Being incapable of flight it was easily captured on land and 
was taken in great numbers at its breeding places. Systematic slaugh- 
ter ot the bird for its flesh and feathers caused the extermination of 
the Great Auk about 1840.

POET, SCOTCH 

WILLIAM DRUMMOND, of H.wvthorntien. 

Born at " Hawthornden," near Edinburgh, Dec. 13, 
15S5 ; d. Dec. 14, 1649, and buried at Lasswade, two miles 
from his birth-place. 

Descended from an ancient Scotch family of noble blood. 
Educated at the University of Edinburgh (ALA., 1605), and 
in Law at Paris and Bruges ; a man of wealth and a Royalist, 
resident at Hawthornden, except from 1625- 30, when travel- 
ling on the Continent. 

A Scotch poet of the Spenserian school, — author, among 
other works, of Teares on the Dcatk of Ma-Hades, 1 6 1 3 ; 
Poems, 1 616; Faith Feasting, 1617; Flowers of Sion and 
The Cypresse Grove, 1623; and some forgotten historical 
and political writings. 

"Drl'.m.mo.vd was essentially a follower of Spenser, delighting in the descrip- 
tion of outer nature, but, amid all his sensuousness, and even in those lines most 
conspicuously Laden with lustrous beauty, there is a dash of melancholy thought- 
fulness— a tendency deepened by the death of his first love. He was so success- 
ful as a writer ot sonnets that ne was called 'the Scottish Petrarch,' and his 
sonnets are still ranki^ immediately after Shakespeare's, .Milton's and Words- 
worth's. His poems are distinguished by pensive beauty, sweetness of versifica- 
tion and nicely-worded descriptions, but lack vigour and originality. The Cypresse 
Groie, one of the noblest prose poems in literature, exhibits great wealth of illus- 
tration, much line thinking and an extraordinary command of musical English."

Feast of Tabernacles (Pliotocjraph).—Sho\vinj: the offer- 
ing;- ot grace before the meal (known as Kid.lusli, or

place on the 15th of Tishri (.September-October), and 
c .ntinucs according to Lexiticns .xxiii, 39-43, seven 
days ; most of the modern Jews observe eight days. 
The important feature ot the celebration was the com- 
mand to dwell in booths, a practice still kept tip. In 
a.icient times this feast which was coincident with the 
harvest time, was the most important of the three pil- 
grimage festivals. 154,472'.

The Koran, the sacred bookof Islam, is treated by 
the MohammcdaJis with great external veneration 
and reverence. They generally take care never 
to hold it, and thcv deposit it upon a high and 
clean place, and never put another book, or any- 
thing else ori top of it. When read it is placed on 
a. stand. The reading of the Koran should com- 
mence with legal ablution and prayer. The usual 
prayer is : "I seek protection with God against 
Satan the accursed," followed by the invocation : 
" In the name of' God the Merciful, thtf Compas- 
sionate."' In the services ol the mosque it is 
chanted bv the imam, or the leader in prayer.

Blocks and movable type are both used in Korea. This is 
a common block for printing the alphabet sheet from which 
children learn the 6n-moun, or native Korean character. The 
characters are arranged in vertical columns, and above each 
is a rough pictorial representation of something containing the 
initial consonant sound of the characters in the column. The 
writing on the left is astrological.

Gift of Demerara MfsEf.M. 

The most striking feature of the skeleton, and one peculiar 
to the Hoatzin, is the shape of the breast-bone, the keel 
being cut away in front where it is usually deepest. 

The food of the Hoatzin consists mainly of leaves of the 
arum, and .ns large quantities of leaves are eaten, a large 
crop IS required for their reception, and this crop completely 
fills the space below the sternum where the keel is larking 

The lower end of the furcula (wish-bone) is united with 
the sternum, and its upper ends with the coracoids— the 
bones to which the wings are articulated. 

The Hoat/in is the sole member of the order Opistho^omi 
and IS probably the representative of a once more numerous 
group of birds of generalized structure.

what is locall\- known as the South Wash, in 
Wayne County, Utah. 60,881. 

Received from J. E. T.\i,m.\ge, 1893. 

The crystals occur in a cave which is inclosed by a 
thick shell forniinjj a mound which stands in relief on a 
hillside as shown in the photograph. The crystals vary 
greatly in size and weight, some being over four feet 
long. Owing to the vandalism of visitors, it has been 
found necessary to remove the finest specimens to the 
Deseret. Museum, at Salt Lake City, to prevent their com- 
plete destruction (See Science, Feb. 17, iSgj )

percolating though it is still acid and attacks the 
material of the stalactites as it drips over them.

Collected by G. Brown Goode. 



The FRATERNITY OF THE MISERICORDIA {P^a Arcicon^ 
fraterntta de Santa Maria deiia Misericordia) is a great society, with 
branches in Siena, Florence, Pisa, and the other cities and towns of Tuscany, 
which has for its sole object the alleviation of suffering and the furtherance 
of all works of benevolence. Its most striking characteristic is that its 
active work is carried on by its members in person, and not by paid deputies. 
On its rolls arc found the names of a large proportion of the adult males 
of the community, without regard to rank or wealth. A certain number 
of these are assigned to duty for each day in the year, and are expected 
to respond at once to any call from the officer of the day, and while on 
duty are under strict discipline. 

The personal relationship of the wealthy and the powerful to the 
cbantable work of the community is productive of much good. All dis- 
tinctions of rank are ignored in the organization, and to this end a costume 
ol the cheapest material is used, to disguise figure and face, and members 
while on duty neither speak nor are spoken to. except as a matter of 
necessity. The money needed for the work is obtained by the mute appeals 
of the members in public places and at the doors of churches, and from 
the fees of membership. Each local society has its chapel for funeral 
services, and all funerals with but few exceptions, are conducted by this 
organization, the coffin being borne by its members in their peculiar dress. 

One of the oldest of ihese sfxieties, that to which the costume exhiLiied belongs, is that of Siena. 
This was founded ai rhe end of the fourteenth century by Bernardino Albizicschi (San Bernardino) as a 
society to ptrfonn worki of mercy and t ) aid prisoners. In 1564 a statute prescribed the manner in which 
their charitable offices mighi be exercised. It was suppressed in the time of Leopold I, and resuscitated

printed each year. The Society has it*- house, in which is not only a chji>el, but a vast warehouse for the 
accessories of their work — litters and surgical appliances, — and a great room, surrounded by cupboards, in 
which the cassocks of the members are kept ready to be put on when they arc hastily summoned to duly

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 39 

Labels, as a rule, seem to be most satisfactory when nearly s()uare, 
or with tlie height less than the width. 

The relationship of the objects in a series to each other may usually 
be indicated by the size of the labels, which should be uniform for 
objects of the same general character in the same case. When a devi- 
ation froni this rule' is necessary, if the size of the type remains the 
same, more space may be obtained either by slight widening or slight 
lengthening; but iu the same series we nuist always lengthen or always 
widen. Classification labels, which are placed, unattached, among the 
specimens, Increase in size with the importance of their grade in the 
plan of classification, as is shown iu the family labels illustrated. 

There are limits to the possibilities of making labels speak by their 
size. An object on the top of a case, or on a i^edestal, or in a case by 
itself,is always regarded as "out of classification," and its label arranged 
solely with reference to its appearance or utility in the place where it 
is to stand. It is also necessary to vary the size somewhat in the 
same series, when, as in a long case of mammals, a small species and a 
large one are placed side by side. Here, for iesthetic; reasons, the rule 
of uniformity is usually set aside. 

Much attention has been given to the selection of type and color for 
labels, it having been found that labels printed on white cardboard 
become dirty or turn yellow, besides being dazzling and hard to read. 
Many tints of cardboard which would otherwise be available may not 
be used, because of their tendency to fade — objectionable in itself, and 
dcuibly objectionable when it becomes necessary to put a fresh, bright 
label by the side of one which has become faded in use. Almost every 
sample of colored board which has been tried in the National Museum 
has faded after a time. The most satisfactory has been one of greenish 
gray. This is temporarily in use in the geological and mineralogical 
collections, where a light gray color for the interior of the cases and 
shelves seems preferable, and also in the collection of birds, which is 
installed by preference in a somewhat dark apartment. 

The standard label-board, however, is a rough -faced nuinila. The 
color, being that natural to the fiber, is quite unchangeable. There is 
no fading, little tendency to become dirty, and its soft, rich, brownish- 
yellow tone sets off admirably the heavy black lines of the antique-faced 
type which is used, and harmonizes well with the bufts and maroons 
which are our favorite colors for case interiors. The material at first 
used was a somewhat soft though thick paper, made specially for genus- 
covers in the herbarium. This did not i)rove thoroughly satisfactory, 
since the labels, unless very small, had to be glued <u' tacked to some 
solid support to prevent their bending and winding, and even then the 
corners frequently rolled. 

We now have a special cardboard of the material just mentioned, 
heavily pressed, very stiif, and durable, which, though its surface 
lacks somewhat the desirable softness, proves very satisfactory.* 

'Samples of tliis board will be sent to any niuacnin worker who may request it. 



40 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

It may be added that cartridge paper, such as is ordinarily used for 
wall decoration, in any tint of gray or light brown, is an admirable 
material for labels, especially large ones. It must, however, be glued 
to a tablet. If this is made of dark wood with a bevel retreating from 
the edge of the label, forming a dark border, the effect is very pleas- 
ing". Labels thus prepared, and mounted upon metal rods, are used by 
, us for general classification labels in the interior of cases. 

It is the plan in the National Museum to have a large label, glazed 
and framed, at the top of each case, or in front of each panel. These 
are printed on black or maroon paper in gold or silver letters.* 

The labels in gold on black are printed from large wooden type, and 
are used to indicate the general system of classification of the cases 
upon the tioor. When it is desired to use outside labels, glazed and 
framed, whi(;h are not in this general-classification series, we print with 
heavy-faced tyjte in black upon manila or cartridge paper, such as have 
been already referred to, since the black upon yellow is more legible 
with comparatively small type than the gold upon black. 

The National Museum owes many most important lessons in the 
matter of labeling and the interior fitting of cases to the Art Museum 
at South Kensington. Their system was studied with the greatest care 
by the writer in 1880 and during a residence of seven months at South 
Kensington in 1883, and, as will be evident to anyone who knows their 
system, its influence has been very great upon that in use in Washing- 
ton. 

In the accompanying illustrations (Pis. lo-2G) are shown a number 
of the forms of labels adopted in the National Museum. Others are 
being developed from day to day; but it is thought advisable tb place 
these upon record as an indication of what has already been accepted 
as measurably good. 

ADVANCES IN GENERAL INSTALLATION. 

The map devised by Mr. Merrill to show the extent and location of 
the great ice sheet in North America during the glacial period is 
described further on in this report. 

The synoptical collection of invertebrates prepared by Mr. Lucas also 
marks a positive advance in methods of mounting and labeling, to say 
nothing of the success attained in showing the structure of certain 
representative forms. This work will be described in the report for 
1894, and a mere mention must now suffice. 

The accompanying illustrations (Pis. 27, 28, 29), liowever, tell the 
story better than words can do.

their relationship to each other and to the parent form, the rock dove. 

A similar project is being worked out for the domestic fowl, but is 
not yet in final shape. 

Another advance is that effected by Mr. Lucas in showing, side by

of the bones being indicated by a system of coloration modilied from 
that already in use in the Natural History Museum in ^Filan, Italj'. 

A minor feature which seems t(j add materially to the c(mifort and 
convenience of many visitors is the reading table, a sketch of which 
is here given as a substitute for a detailed description (Fig 9). There 
are some thirty of these tables, one for each department, and about 500 
books are thus placed at the service of visitors. The books on the tables 
are text books, bibliographies, dictionaries, and standard works of refer- 
ence, and each table is devoted to the subject illustrated by the special 
collection in the midst of which it stands. In the rotunda is a book- 
case containing cyclopedias, and visitors who desire fuller information 
are at liberty to go to the ^luseum library, and thence, if need be, to the 
sectional libraries in the curators' laboratories. 

It is pleasant to be able to say that although over a thousand vol- 
umes are thus exposed without surveillance in the public lialls, not 
a single volume has been stolen, though many of tliem have been '• read 
to death." 

TAXIDERMY IN THE MFSEUM. 

Allusion has been made from time to time in the reports to the work 
of the Museum preparators in i)reparing objects for exliibition or study, 
and the time seems now to luive come for a consideration of what lias 
been accomplished and how this has been done. 

As early as 1875, when, by means of the appropriations for the exhibit 
of the Museum at the Centennial Exliibition at Philadelphia, it became 
for the first time possible to employ competent taxidermists, an effort 
was made to secure the very best men available, and to have prepared 
better specimens than were at that time to be found in any American 
museum. Mr. Josepli Palmer and Mr. Julius Stoerzer, excellent work- 
men of the old school, were the chief agents in the preparation of the 
exhibit of mounted animals and casts shown in I^hiladelphia, and the 
results, though, so far as accessories are c.oncerned. far below the pres- 
ent standards, were in many instances (piite equal U> what has since 
been done, as is indicated by the accompanying i)late of the group of 
fur seals (PI. 31). Their work was greatly admired, and the intluenco of 
the movement then just beginning soon spread to other instirutions. 



42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

The ideals in the Xatioiiiil Museum weie as high then as at the pres- 
ent time, and Professor Baird, himself a very skillful taxidermist, was 
not only the best of critics, but enthusiastic in the extreme upon the 
whole subject. The time of ]n'eparation for the Philadelphia exhibition 
was so short and the appropriations so limited, however, that it was 
not possible at that time to accomplish the results desired. 

In this same connection should be mentioned the very important 
intluence of Prof. Henry A. Ward, who, in the conduct of his natural 
history establishment at Eochester, was always evidently actuated 
quite as much by a love for natural history and the ambition to supply 
good material to museums, as by the hope of profit, which was always 
by him subordinated to higher ideals in a manner not very usual in 
commercial establishments. 

While the work from 1875 on was constantly advancing in Washing- 
ton, and the anti(iuated and badly prepared specimens in the old col- 
lection were being replaced as fast as possible by others as good as 
could at that time be prepared, similar agencies were in activity in 
Rochester, and under the influence of Prof. Ward a number of enthusi- 
astic young men were brought together and employed in the various 
branches of the work connected with the establishment. It was here 
that, through the stimulus of association and in connection with the 
Immense work in preparing natural history specimens which was then 
in progress, mental forces of another kind came into being; and here, 
in 1879, and the years following, some very remarkable pieces of work 
were accomplished, which for originality and strength far surpassed 
anything hitherto attempted in America. Among these may be men- 
tioned Hornaday's groups of orangs, one of which is now in the 
museum in New York, and another here in Washington. These, though 
lacking in the artistic repose -which characterizes some of the later pro- 
ductions of himself and his impils, were extremely spirited and had all 
the qualities of good workmanship and permanence which could be 
desired. 

A series of animals of the Rocky Mountains, mounted by Mr. F. S. 
Webster to serve as models for the artist Bierstadt, and since destroyed 
by fire, should also be mentioned in this connection. Work of this 
kind demonstrated the triviality and false ideals of such ambitious 
figure groups as those of Verreaux, of which certain examples had 
reached this country and were up to that time greatly admired, and of 
the work of the European school of mammal taxidermists in general, 
well typified in the celebrated ^^'urtemburg collection and in many of 
the groups in the Liverpool Museum. It is not intended, however, to 
disparage the very excellent work of Verreaux upon single specimens*

mounted ill attitudes of repose for case installation, iioi' is it intended 
to if^nore tiie wonderful work done under Paolo Savi lor the Uuiversity 
of IMsa — work ([uite in the nuxlern si)irit, which the test of nearly a 
century has shown to have all the qualities of good workinanshii).* But 
for the fact that these are buried in the midst of a poorly installed 
collection in an inaccessible gallery iu a small Italian city, possibly the 
spirit of modern artistic taxidermy would not have remained so long 
latent. The museum at Turin has also had excellent taxidermists in 
its eniploj'. 

At Leyden also much good work was done, and the animals were 
mounted iu varied positions. The birds at Leyden aftbrded a striking 
contrast to those iu the Natural History Museum at Bremen. These 
were mounted in tixed conventional attitudes, and since the museum 
possessed an immense collection of birds, they were crowded together 
side by side, heads toward the wall and tails projecting over the edges 
of the shelves toward the spectator, so that they looked like horses in 
a stable, viewed from the rear. This museum, as I saw it iu 1880, was 
an eloquent teacher of methods to be avoided. It is to be hoped that, 
before now, most of these skins have been unmounted and placed in 
drawers iu a study series, and a reasonable exhibition series substi- 
tuted. 

Mr. John Hancocii, of Loudon, many years ago did excellent work, 
combining artistic feeling with scientitic accuracy, and Mr. E. T. Booth 
somewhat later developed a marvelous collection of British birds in 
his '^Dyte Eoad Museum" at Brighton. These were mounted in life- 
like attitudes in the midst of natural accessories, and were satisfactory 
alike to artists and to naturalists. Following in the same course the 
admirablj" mounted collection in the Town Museum at Leicester was 
developed by Mr. Montagu Brown, and that in the British Museum of 
iS^atural History under Dr. Giinther, beginning as early as 1880. On 
this side of the Atlantic, as early as 1870, most excellent work of this 
kind was done by Mr. Andrew Downes iu his jjiivate cabinet in Hali- 
fax, iNTova Scotia. 

The Society of American Taxidermists was organized March 24, 1880, 
by Messrs. Hornaday, Lucas, Webster, Critchley, Jules Bailly (a pupil 
of Verreaux), Martens, and I'raine, all of Rochester, and a number of 
other taxidermists scattered through the country joined in the move- 
ment. This society was the direct outgrowth of the aspirations of the 
enthusiastic founders of the new American school, and had for its 
object not only the improvement of taxidermy from the technical stand- 
point, but the elevation and ennobling of the profession of taxidermy 
and the establishment of loftier ideals for the work. 

The intention was to hold annual exhibitions, to secure the award of

prizes for tlio most iiieritorious advances, aud to i)ublisli au annual 
Aolume of Pio<;eedings, devoted to tlie discussion of the principles 
and methods of the art. 

The ideals of tlie organization before very long developed to such a 
degree that they could not be Avorked out to the best advantage in a 
commercial establishment, and several members of the new school, hav- 
ing found that their objects Avere thoroughly appreciated and their 
efforts meeting with hearty support from the authorities of the U. S. 
National Museum, began to look to Washington as a wider and more 
promising field for their activities. In the National ]\hiseum, in the 
meantime, constant progress had been made, especially in the work of 
preparing casts and models in plaster. Some of the work iirepared 
for the International Fisheries Exhibitions in Berlin in 1880 and Lon- 
don in 1883, would be regarded as admirable if done at the present time. 

Soon after the reorganization of the National .Museum in 1881 "Sir. 
W. T. Ilornaday was appointed chief taxidermist, and he was soon fol- 
lowed to AVashiugton by Mr. F. A. Lucas, who, though an accom- 
plished taxidermist, had given especial attention to the mounting of 
skeletons and anatomical preparations. Somewhat later came Mr. F. 
S. Webster, and others of the Rocbester group would also have been 
added to the ^Museum staff but for our feeling of unwillingness to inter- 
fere with the important establishment at IJochester by taking away so 
many of its most competent men. 

In the meantime the Society of American Taxidermists had been 
steadily at work. It held three annual exhibitions (in Ivocliester, in 
Boston, and in New York), and in 1881 another exhibition was held in 
connection with the Cotton Centennial Exposition at New Orleans and 
under the auspices of the National Museum. Three numbers of the 
reports were published. Since 1884, however, the society has been 
dormant. Perhaps its work had been accomplished. At all events, 
its influence was strongly felt, not only among taxidermists but through 
the larger and smaller museums of the country, and during the five 
years of its existence a decided change in public opinion had been 
effected. 

The necessity for the development of a great mounted collection of 
mammals in the National Museum, and above all the execution of 
the plan for i)reparing monumental grou])s of the animals which are 
api)roaching extinction, mounted in natural attitudes and surrounded 
by proper accessories, has given a very wide field for work in higher 
taxidermy, and a number of young men from various i^arts of the 
country sought admission to the Museum workshops, where they 
received or completed their training. Among the nujst promiunit of 
these maybe mentioned the late Jenness Richardson, who was for three 
years in the Museum, and went in 188(1 to become the chief taxidermist 
of the Museum of Natural History in New York City, where he accom-

plisbed souie very iiotewoitliy ]»i<'ces of work, <'sjKM-i;illy in the iiKniiit 
iiig" of birds. 

Mr. Ij. L. l>ych('. now professor in the l^niversity of Kiinsas, also 
passed several months here, and learned the methods whicli have 
resulted in his excellent work upon large mammals shown in the 
Kansas State building at the AVorld's Fair of 1S1>;>. 

Mr. William Palmer, now chief taxidermist of the Museum, also 
received his first training during these years, and began a career which 
has resulted in the })roducti<ui of such remarkable work as the groups 
of Caribou, prepared especially for Chicago, which, in the judgnu'utof 
the writer, have not been surpassed anywhere, marking as they do the 
highest attainment in the imitation of nature, with that combination 
of life with perfect repose which is the supreme test of merit in tax- 
idermy. Many other men have profited by work in our laboratories, 
and are now scattered through the country, either attached to museums 
or in p.rivate business as taxidermists. 

The taxidermists previously attached to the Museum have produced 
work in its way equal to that of their associates. The casts of reptiles, 
fishes, and cetaceans made by Joseph Palmer are by universal admis- 
sion unrivaled, and this perfection was reached under I'rof. Baird's 
encouragement before the Society of Taxidermists began its work and 
as early as 187(5. 

The bird work of Henry Marshall, though for the most part limited 
to preparation of specimens for shelf installation, has not been sur- 
passed. Mr. X. li. Wood, who came from liochester in 1888, has i)ro- 
duced noteworthy work in groups of birds, and is especially skillful 
in the mounting of the various breeds of domestic fowl, whic.-h he has 
done Avith such painstaking accuracy that they may well serve as 
fixed standards in the development of the races of poultry. His work 
in restoring hair to skins which have become bare, is worthy of the 
most painstaking Oriental. 

In the mounting of skeletons and anatomical preparations the high- 
est standard of excellence has been aimed at, and it is believed that 
there is no collection of mounted skeletons in the world which can 
show more perfect pieces of work or a higher average grade of excel- 
lence. Mr. Lucas, under whose direction this collection has grown up, 
and who with his own hands prepared many of the most rennirkable 
specimens (Pis. 32 and 33), has become curator of the department 
of comparative anatomy, but has transmitted the technical meri^^s of 
his methods tct ]Mr. .1. W. Scollick, whose work tipon minute osteolog- 
ical preparations is little short of marvelous. 

It might be said that these words of commendation would be in better 
taste coming from outside and written by one who has not been, in the 
matter of sympathy, so closely associated with the develoi)ment of the 
ideals of the higher taxidermy and the furthering of their accoiiii)bsh- 
meut. This was in my mind when, a year ago. 1 re(|uestcd Dr. II. W. 



46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Shufeldt, U. S. Army, who had recently published some articles on 
taxidermy in "The Great Divide,'' and who was also a judge of awards 
in the department of taxidermy at the Columbian Exposition, to pre- 
pare an article upon the modern museum taxidermy. It was the idea 
that Dr. Shufeldt, not being attached to any museum, would ])e able to 
examine cridcally and discuss the subject without prejudice, taking 
into consideration all that has been done elsewhere as well as in Wash- 
ington, and this he endeavored to do. The predominance of illnstra- 
tions taken from specimens in our Museum, as finally published, was 
not intentional, but was due to the difticulty of obtaining satistactory 
photographs from other establishments. An etibrt was made to obtain 
illustrations from the Isew York Museum and from the British Museum.* 
The illustrations obtained from these sources by no means did justice to 
the specimens illustrated, and the efforts to secure photograjths of the 
Savi groups in Pisa, and of the rhinoceros mounted for the Medici 
collection in Florence three hundred years ago, were unsuccessful. 

Dr. Shufeldt's essay, which was published in the Museum report for 
1892, has attracted much attention, especially abroad, and the Ameri- 
can taxidermic work, the excellences of which are suggested rather than 
fully depicted in the illustrations, has received much praise from those 
who are not familiar with it, and, if one may predict, the paper will be 
useful in still further raising tlie standard of museum taxidermy. 

A special illustrated supplement to IS^atural Science was published 
in England on the occasion of the meeting of the British Association for 
the Advancement of Science. This was entitled " Taxidermy as a Fine 
Art,*' and was devoted not so much to a review of the Shufeldt article 
as to critical comments upon the illustrations, of which a selection of 
nine were reproduced. In closing his remarks the editor says: 

In selecting the plates for this article we have paifl but small attention to the 
many beautiful illustrations of birds. In respect to bird groups our home museums 
do not reijuire much teaching, though even they have yet to learn that a bird can 
be mounted in the most natural manner on an ordinary museum perch or stand. It 

*l)r. 1\. Bowdler Sharpe's paper on "Ornithology at South Kensington," in the 
"English Illustrated Magazine." December, 1887, pp. 166-175, gives an excellent idea 
of the British Museum groups, though the illustrations, not being photographic, do 
not aft'ord the oi>])ortunity forjudging the degree to which the accessories simulate- 
natural ert'ects. 

We frankly admit that in the matter of environmental groups of birds, Great 
Britain still surpasses the United States. So far as taxidermy is coiicerned, Ameri- 
can workmen can hold their own, but the art of making and grouping accessoriea 
we have yet to acquire. The only successful accessory work done in this country is 
that by the Mogridges, who were trained at South Kensington, and who are repre- 
sented extensively in the New York ^luseum and by one ])iece in Washington. 

Many of the groups of this kind, even when made by the Mogridges, err in mak- 
ing the accessories more jiromincnt than the birds and tilling the cases with artifi- 
cial flowers and leaves to such a degree that the birds are entirely subordinate. An 
excellent illustration of etiective and legitimate use of accessories is to be seen in 
the admirable group of king-rails in the New York Museum.

is ill i)r<;pariiiy the other classes of Vertebrata aud the Iuveitel»rata that American 
taxidermists take the lead, and it is their excellence in this direction that we have 
endeavored to set f'ortli as an example. 

]>ut for tlie j>('iic'r;(l ai)i)i(>val of tlie Aniericaii work, as shown in the 
coiimients u[>on this paper, I shouhl i)erhaps not venture to ex}>ress so 
frankly my own opinion as to what the American taxidermi.sts liave 
done, and, as it is, this is done chiefly for the purpose of explainin.ii' the 
causes whicli have led to its develoi)ment. 

The editor of Natural Science is quite right in (juestioniug Dr. 
Shufeldt's statement* that tlie development of taxidermy in the United 
States is due to the stimulating iuHuence of the World's Columbian 
Exposition. As a matter of fact, the taxidermy at the ('oluml)iau 
Exposition, with the excei^tiou of that in the Government building aud 
that of Prof. Dyche iu the Kausas building, was decidedly i)oor. Cer- 
tain mammal heads mounted by Mr. vStainsky were of hiuli merit. 
Beside these, there was scarcely a specimen of remarkable merit in the 
general taxidermic display; and many of the groups, so-called, illus- 
trating the fauna of special States, belonged to the grotesque aud 
unworkmanlike period of twenty years ago. 

Very important advances had been made before the Chicago E:xposi- 
tion was organized, and there was scarely a group among those shown 
by the Xational Museum which had not l)een planned and partially 
executed before preparation for the Exposition began. The Caribou 
groups already referred to are possiblj' exceptions, but these were 
simply advances along established lines. 

To emphasize the fact that work of the very highest type was done 
in the Museum as early as 1884, representations are given here of a 
tiger (PI. 34) and a zebra (PI. 35) mounted by Mr. Hornaday and his 
assistants at that time. These have all been engraved before, but so 
unsatisfactorily that for the purpose of making a record in this place 
new plates have been prejjared. 

The true explanation of our advance in taxidermy lies in the happy 
relationship which was established iu 1882 between the authorities of 
the Museum and the representatives of the Society of Taxidermists. 
These were l)ascd ui)on a recognition of the dignity of persoiuil labor, 
and a recognition of the fact that work of this kind could not be done 
by men who counted their pay as the only remuneration for their 
exertions. The taxidermist was recognized either as an artist or as an 
expert artisan, as his individual capacities might merit, and he was 
encouraged to do every part of the work with his own hands, trusting 
nothing to laborers or ordinary mechanics. He was furthermore told 
that one specimen well mounted wcmld be more highly appreciated than 
twenty "stuffed in the old way," and that no expenditure of thought, 



'Dr. 8hnfeldt assnres me that his statement has been misapineliendcd, and that he 
quite agrees with the critic in his views as to the cause of the development of the 
higher taxidermy. — G. B. G. 



48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

time, or material, was too great, if needful to secure the very best possi- 
ble results wbicli his abilities would enable him to i)roduce. When he 
had accomplished a really creditable and conscientious piece of work, 
his name was placed upon the label as its maker. In this way a good 
piece of taxidermy is placed in the same standing, in its way, as a book 
printed by Mr, William Morris or one bound by Mr. Cobden-Sanderson. 
One of the former members of the ^Vlnseum staff of taxidermists, now 
engaged in other pursuits, writes: 

The fact that the Natioual Museum gives the author of a really good group credit 
for it ou the label has had a great influence for good. The American Museum is the 
only other that I have ever known to do this; but if the museum officers generally 
could only know the tremendous stimulus this is to even the humblest taxidermist 
all would take advantage of it. And it costs nothing. If your plan in this respect 
were universallv adopted it would be a constant and powerful stimulus to the pro- 
duction of the finest kind of work." 

No taxidermist or modeler was placed in a responsible position who 
was not himself a naturalist and whose own instincts did not lead him 
to study a living model or the best attainable pictures or sculptures 
of similar subjects before beginning his work, and whose painstaking 
habits of research did not have an influence upon his method of Mork 
to such an extent that he would work out every muscle and bone with 
reference to casts or skeletons before him in his workshop. 

The workshops soon became filled with photographs and casts, and 
among these would be seen models and sometimes originals from the 
hand of Barye and other sculptors, whose art the taxidermist attempted 
to adopt as far as possible into his own. These men were members of 
the scientific societies, and some ot them have since become specialists 
in science, although they have never lost their relationships to their 
previous work. Prof. W. B. Scott, of Princeton University, and Prof. 
F. H. Knowlton, of Columbian University, did excellent work in taxi- 
dermy before leaving it for research-work, and Mr. L. L. Dyche, although 
professor of zoology in the State University of Kansas, mounted with 
his own hands most of the specimens in the great grouj^s shown in the 
Kansas State building at Chicago. 

Incidentally it may be mentioned that many American naturalists 
are amateur taxidermists, and that some of the most successful groups 
of mammals and birds in the Museum have been done by Avorkmen 
not possessed of artistic skill though excellent in technique, whose 
work has been designed and directed by the curators of the several 
departments. 

In connection with these discussions of American work it seems 
desirable to refer to the extensive collection of South African mammals 
and birds, exhibited at the Dr. Emil Ilolub's South African Exposi- 
tion in Prague in 1891. + The mammals were mounted in groups in

varied iittitiules, and some of these groups weic adniiiiible. One of 
tlieiii is here illustrated, as well as one group of birds (I'ls. 3G, 37). 

fj II K iron mental groups of marine animals. — It has long- been a favorite 
idea of the writer that the appearance and habits of fishes and other 
axjuatic animals might be best shown by mounting souie of our colored 
casts among natural surroundings in a case resembling an aijuarium 
tank, and admitting most of the light from above through glass so 
tinted that the appearance of being under water would be given. All 
attempts in this direction failed, however, and it has remained for ^Ir. 
Lucas, in his group of Octopus (PI. 38), to show that it is possible. 
It is intended to carry this still further, and especially to attempt to 
show the life of the coral reefs. 

Some groups of reptiles, colored casts in the midst of natural sur- 
roundings, have also been completed, and these, though not realizing our 
highest ideals, show that there are good possibilities in this direction. 
The stuffing of skins of tishes has been carried to high perfection 
in Europe, owing to the desire of anglers to preserve trophies of their 
successful excursions in their own homes. Simple accessories, such as 
suffice to represent the shores of a stream or lake, are used with them 
with a very good degree of effect. A wonderful disi)lay of these ang- 
ling trophies was shown at the International Fisheries Exhibition in 
London in 1883. It is our experience, however, that it is scarcely 
advisable to stuff a scaly tish or reptile. Sharks may be stuffed, but 
tishes are neither satisfactory nor lasting. If casts can not be had, it 
is best to be content with preparations in spirits. 

The moimiing of the Pacific walrus. — In the discussion of the recent 
taxidermic work in the Museum which has appeared from time to time 
during the past year in the scientific journals, the Pacific walrus, 
which was exhibited at the World's Fair, has been severely criticised, 
and it has been said that it is inartistic and false to nature. 

The preservation of a worthy memorial to the North Pacific walrus 
is especially desirable, since this is one of the species threatened with 
extinction. i!^umbered by tens of thousands and flocking together in 
immense droves when the American whaling fleet first entered the 
Arctic in 1854, they have now been reduced to a mere handful in 
American waters, and the old males are now entirely extinct in the 
Western Pacific, and it is doubtful whether this particular phase of the 
species is to be found anywhere. The specimen shown at the World's 
Fair (PI, 39) is an admirable example of the old nuile, and since it was 

Dr. Holub's second exploring trip to Soutii ami Central Africa in 1883-1887, which 
were lirst exhibited in 1891 in Vienna. The exposition at Pragne was the most 
complete, 13,000 objects being exhibited in addition to ihe groups of mammals 
whicli were mounted in accordance with measurements made by Dr. Holub in Africa. 
There were a number of gronjjs of natives exhibited in counoction with their actual 
dwellings and the implements of their arts and industries. A large album of views 
of this exposition and of the groups was presented to the lustitution by Dr. Holub.

acquired only after loug- and continued effort it jseenis but proper tluit 
its trutli to uature, as now mounted, should be vindicated. 

The skin in question was mounted b}^ a most skillful and conscien- 
tious member of the staff, the chief taxidermist, Mr. William Palmer, 
who spent some months on the Pribilof Islands making preliminary 
studies in order to fit himself for this particular undertaking. 

Capt. E. r. Herendeen, formerly of the U. S. Coast Survey, who was 
familiar with the Arctic Ocean for fifteen years, and who has seen tens 
of thousands of walruses in the times when they were abundant, in 
1854 and in subsequent years, and who has seen thousands of them 
at one time upon the shore at Sandy Point, says of the specimen in the 
Museum: 

I am satistieil that the mounted walrus is true to uatuie ami in eveiy resi)ect au 
admirable pi'ece of work. The only criticism which I would make upon it is that 
an animal in the attitude of extreme attention and activity in which this is repre- 
eeuted would be slightly smaller about the neck. The arrangement of the wrinkles 
in the skin and the tuberculated api)earau(e of its surface are perfect, and the attitude 
of the limbs can not be criticised. 

The following statement of the material upon which the treatment of 
the skin was founded is supplied by Mr. Palmer : 

{!) Personal observations. — On August 7 we landed from the U. S. revenue-cutter 
Bush on Walrus Island, having previously seeu the remnant of a walrus herd, con- 
Bisting of eight individuals, on tiie island. We landed on the southern end of the 
island and made our way over the rocky interior toward the walrus, but unfor- 
tnuately the vessel remained within sight of the animals, and the sailors from the 
boat in which we had landed instead of keeping ou the other side of the island 
persisted in getting into view of the walrus, witii the result that before we got 
within shooting distance they made preparations to leave the rocks. Before us was 
a wide crevice in the rocks full of water, so that it was impossible to get over it, 
and there not being time to get around the head of it before the walrus took to the 
water, I sat down on the rocks at the edge of the crevice and examined the animals 
at leisure. Before they had reached the water I had succeeded in fixing in my mind 
the most important features of their physiognomy. The walrus nearest to me was 
the one that I examined most thoroughly, and I convinced myself of the fact that 
the general positions of the walrus, as delineated in Mr. Elliott's picures, was true, 
and in mounting this specimen I followed as closely as possible the picture which 
remained in my mind of this particular walrus. I had a tine view of the animal, 
which was distant not more than 20 rods and within easy gunshot. No attempt 
was made to kill the animal, however, since it was so near the water that if it had 
been struck it would have fallen and been lost. Then, too, I hoped that there 
might be another opportunity of capturing a specimen. 

(2) Measurement from the fresh specimen. — The skin which was mounted was 
obtained by the Bush ten days afterwards. This was after I left the island, how- 
ever, and I was unable to study the animal in the flesh. Dr. White, the surgeon of 
the cutter, however, made careful measurements in accordance with specifications 
■which I left in his hantls, and I am satisfied that these measurements are accurate. 
They met all the necessities of taxidermy, and are practically those which I would 
have taken had I been present. The only thing lacking which I could have supplied 
would have been casts and photographs of certain portions. I had, however, the ad- 
vantage of the head already in the Museum, which was received from Alaska in ])ickle 
and practically in the flesh, and was mounted in that condition after careful study 
by Mr. Hornaday. I also had a photograph of the great hea<l of an Atlantic walrus.

(S) I'ictures.— l bad devoted some years to making a collection of tracings of all 
the illustrations of tbe walrus in books of travel and natural history, and think I 
had assembled some twenty of these, and am satisfied that I had, if not all, at least 
all of the most important of those which made any claim to have been made by 
observers. These were all quite unlike Mr. Elliott's drawings, but, as I have said, 
personal observation satisHed me that these drawings were true to nature and'tlie 
others not. I showed Mr. Elliott's pictures to many of the natives and others on the 
islands, who all expressed themselves as perfectly satisfied witli them. 

(4) Anatomical indications.— In mounting the specimen the large wrinkled folds 
on the skin around the limbs and body were followed as closely as possil)le, and 
these, as every anatomist knows, indicate in no uncertain way the customary atti- 
tudes of thick-skinned animals such as the walrus, the rhinoceros, the elephant, and 
the armadi-llo. The shape and position of tbe warts on the neck, which look so gro- 
tesque and unnatural in the Elliott pictures, were clearly shown in the skin and 
could not possibly have been very different from those which Mr. Elliott delineated 
Even tbe inflamed surface as shown in the drawings, giving such a ghastly and dis- 
agreeable appearance to the animal, were manifestly true to nature, which is also 
euppr.rted by the testimony of people on the island and by Capt. Hereudeen 

The deep wrinkles at the base of the flipper, have been criticised as unnatural 
but my own observations on many specimens of fur seal, sea lions, and walruses' 
and which are confirmed by many competent observers whom I have consulted (in 
fact, they can be readily found on any pickled skin), satisfied me that I was correct 
The thinness and smoothness of the skin in the center of these wrinkles their 
position and general direction, even as illustrated in the palm of one's own hand will 
convince anyone who sees them that there must necessarilv be wrinkles at those 
points when by the position of the animal the skin and blubber is entirely released 
of all tension and even crowded on itself; indeed, the most conspicuous feature of the 
surface ot an annual of this division of the pinnipeds as he moves about, is the rapid 
change in the position and form of these wrinkles on many parts of the bod v 

The accompanying illustration (PI. 40) shows tbe manner in which the folds 
appeared in the fresh skin, the process of making them permanent, and the manne 
of preserving them as the mounting progresses. 

Criticisms have been made also upon'tbe shape of the nostrils. In regard to this 
I can only say that my guide was the appearance of the nostrils in tbe skin before 
was fleshed, and when it was comparatively fresh. This I considered myself just ! 
fied in doing, since I am not aware that anybody has made careful observations upon 
the appearance of the nostrils close at hand, except Mr. Elliott, whose drawin-^s cor 
respond with my interpretation, and Capt. Hereudeen says that the walrus^never 
opens Its nostrils wiae, and that it is only when breathing or excited that they are 
open to any considerable degree. * 

It has been also said that the neck is possibly a little too large, but the dimensions 
of the specimen as mounted are smaller in this part than is indicated by the measure! 
ments made by Dr. White. In mounting it I took into consideration the prob ibimy 
:o;:i:^'Z; -^•'^ ^^---^^^ ^-d erect and muscles rigid, woull n.easui^ 

It should be clearly stated that the preparation under discussion was uitended to 
show the appearance m life of the animal to which this skin belonge.l. namely an 
old male such as are rarely seen, and that none but old males assume tbe grotesque 
attitudes ot which this IS one. A young male would never present the same appear- 
ance even m the same attitude, because they are .omparatively smooth, with hh - 
ner sknis more hair, and fewer tubercular growths upon the surface.

the Hip})ors stiotdH-d out behind its in the hair seals, is not itself untrue to nature, 
but is only assunu'd by them wheu in repose or asleep, Avhile with the hair seal it is 
constant. 

It has been questioned whether it would be wise to mount a young Pacitic walrus 
in the same attitude as that of the old male under discussion, but Capt. Herendeen 
states, from his experience, that all walruses, young and old, assume these positions 
when in action. 

1JEPKESEN1ATION8 OF THE HUMAN FICtURE. 

For tifceeii years the Museum has been eoustructiiig models of the 
human figure for use in the exhibition series, and has been striving- by 
various means to secure the best results in this direction. 

These figures are required for three purposes: (1) To show the char- 
acteristics of the different races, (2) to display costumes, and (3) to 
illustrate the methods of use of weapons, instruments, and processes 
of various arts and handicrafts. 

For the first purpose it is manifest that the greatest accuracy and 
fidelity to nature is necessary, or the result will be useless. For the 
others the same degree of accuracy is, ])erhaps, not essential, if tbe labels 
clearly indicate that the faces are not portraits, but so far as possible the 
figures intended chiefly to show costume and action should attain the 
highest possible anatomical perfection. 

The use of well-constructed figures in scientific museums is of quite 
recent origin, though manikins of conventional type have long been 
employed in collections of costumes and armor; and many very credit- 
able efforts in this direction have been made in connection with expo-. 
sitions. 

Before beginning our experiments we were familiar with the altogether 
admirable gallery of historical figures in Castan's " Panopticum" in 
Berlin, and with those of Madam Tussaud in London, not so very 
good in execution, but nevertheless of high interest to the masses. We 
knew the representation of races of mankind at Sydenham and the 
Swedish peasant figures which had been so popular at the Philadelphia 
Centennial. We have since become familiar with the separate groups 
showing the history of primitive man, made for the Paris Exposition in 
1888-'89, and the figures of race types in tbe Trocadero Museum in 
Paris. Indeed, we owe .to the courtesy of Dr. Hamy the privilege of 
having had made copies of several of the-latter, one of which is here 
illustrated (PI. 41), and at the same time obtaining a replica of the 
Eomali warrior in armor, modeled for the Museum of Artillery in 
Paris, by the sculptor Bartholdi. 

It is scarcely worth while to mention the ghastly wax figures of 
Kane, the arctic explorer, and his comi)anions, in costumes of fur, 
which were display ed in the old Smithsonian Museum as early as 1870. 
These, and the equally crude manikins of Eskimo Joe and his wife 
Hannah, made in 1873, have long since been discarded and have no 
place in the history of recent efforts.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 53 

The first advances were made in 1875, when four costumed figures 
were imported from Ja])aii. These were exceedingly spirited and effec- 
tive, and when examined in detail showed such conscientious workman- 
ship and such thorough fidelity to nature that they have served as an 
inspiration and a model for our workmen up to this day. Two of these 
figures, representing an actor and an actress in the costume of Japan- 
ese nobility, were carved in wood, and s<'<'m to show the extreme limits 
of this material in the construction of the human model. The other 
two, a laborer and his wife (PI. 42), are in papier-mache and are satis- 
factory in the highest degree. The material is brought to an extreme 
of hardness, strength, and delicacy of line which no American work- 
man has been able to rival. Indeed, we have not yet progressed 
beyond the use of the much heavier and clumsier plaster of ]*aris. 
The modeling is almost perfect, as may be judged from the fact that 
the figures, with or without clothing, stand poised upon their feet 
without any attachment to the bottom of the case. The haii- is 
attached directly to the figures and has none of the wig-bke appear- 
ance which is almost universal in figures of this kind. The eyes, 
though glass is used for the outer film, are not glass eyes. Even the 
nails are cunningly fashioned of horn and inserted; and the coloring, 
of which more will be said hereafter, is as yet the despair of our work- 
men. The figures as a whole exhibit such conscientious and painstak- 
ing accuracy, and such fidelity to nature in the smallest details, that 
too much can not be said in their praise. (See PI. 43.) 

In 1881 some figures were made for us by M. Achille Colin, a French 
sculptor living in Washington, on a new plan. These were executed 
in accordance with the rules of sculpture, the hair and the clothing 
to be of the same material as the head and body, and the sculptor's 
eye to be used instead of the customary one of glass. They were 
then painted by a portrait painter whose life had been spent in delin- 
eating Indians. The result was thoroughly satisfactory, and nothing 
better has since been done. (Pis. 44 and 45.) It is i)robable that 
this method will be used more and more in the future, since many of 
the races whose lineaments and costumes it is most desirable to per- 
petuate can only be shown in this way. Their costumes no longer 
exist, and nuist be supplied by the modeler and painter frouj such ])or- 
traits as those of which we have a large nund:»er in the Catlin gallery. 
When actual garments are not used, there is no reason for the unsightly 
wig or the staring glass eye. 

A modification of the same method was employed by ]\Ir. U. S. J. 
Dunbar, a Washingtim sculptor, in modeling the face of a Sioux girl, 
Rosa White Thunder, for a full-length figure to be clad in a modern 
Sioux costume of blue cloth ornamented with elk ivory, obtained from 
the original, at that time a pnpil in the Indian scliool at Carlisle. In 
this figure, although tlie sculptured eye is used, the hair is re[)resented 
by a wig. The result is only partly satisfactory, but the experiment is 
an interesting one. (PI. 46.) 



54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MU.^ErM, 1?<93. 

More reeeiitly other niethods have been employed. Mr. J. A\ . Ileud- 
ley, a man of <;reat inj^eniiity and mechanical skill employed in mak- 
ing- models of fruit, produced a cast from life of a negro boy, which iu 
its way is something entirely unique. Although no portion of the fig- 
ure was touched by the modeler or sculptor, it has the merit of abso- 
lute accuracy, and yet is surprisingly spirited and life-like — a Samoau 
youth (PI. 47), modeled from photographs under the direction of 
Lieut. W. E. Safford, U. S. Navy, who is very familiar with these peo- 
ple; a Dyak warrior (PI. 48), jiroduced in the same way under the 
supervision of Mr. Hornaday, and an Indian in feather costume (PI. 
49), from a painting by an Indian artist of Chile, are thoroughly sat- 
isfactory, as is also a Bantu negro boy, modeled by Mr. Theodore 
Mills from life, by the aid of casts. (PI. 50.) 

A number of figures of the same general character were prepared 
for the World's Fair. None of these were so carefully made as those 
already described, owing to the confusion and haste which always 
attend the preparation for a great exhibition. A new feature of 
the greatest interest was, however, introduced among the figures pre- 
pared for this occasion, and a set of groups, unique and full of interest, 
was the result. These, as shown in the <;ases, surrounded by proper 
environmental accessories and engaged in the occupations ])e(;uliar to 
the tribes which they represented, were no longer pieces of sculpture 
but pictures from life. The success of these groups is due to the 
supervision exercised by Prof. W. H. Holmes, artist as well as ethnol- 
ogist, who gave life and pictorial expression to the figures already 
accurately modeled and costumed by the Museum preparators, who 
himself designed a spirited group of Powhatan Indians quarrying 
material for the manufacture of stone implements, which was modeled 
by Mr. U. S. J. Dunbar. To Mr. Frank Hamilton Gushing, whose long 
residence among the Indians of the southwest has given him perfect 
familiarity with their customs, and in whom mechanical skill supple- 
ments an artistic temperament, is due the perfection of other groups 
showing the life of these people. These are: 

1. The Zuni ritual of creation. 

2. The Zufii bread-makers and millers. (PI. al.) 

3. The Zuni potter. 

4. The Zuni basket-maker. 

5. The Zuni belt-maker. 

6. Navajo women, si)inning and weaving. 

7. Indian women of the plains dressing hides. (PI. 52.) 

The first group of the new style made was the group of Kiowa chil- 
dren at play, equally good in its way, designed some years ago by 
Mr. James Mooney, of the Bureau of Ethnology, who also planned the 
group of Navajo silversmiths. Dr. \V. J. Hoffman's "The Primitive 
Scribe," a Chipi)ewa shaman in his lodge writing an incantation on 
prepared birchbark, and another of a Crow Indian painting a blanket, 
are worthv of notice.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT .SECRETARY. 55 

The groups of Loucheux and ilupa Indians, aiianged by Prof. 
Holmes, were also etitective artistically, though lacking the advantages 
which a personal acquaintance with the tril)e would have given the 
designs. 

The relative values of costumes and implements displayed upon 
manikins, and those shelved in cases with tickets explaining their uses, 
need no discussion. A caution should be written to nniseum men, how- 
ever, which is that it is very dangerous to try to make such groups except 
under the eye of an ethnologist who has been among the people to be 
represented. The object of a reference to these groups is simply to 
call attention to the fact that something has been done which was 
never before attempted for the American Indian, and that the result 
seems to more than justify the efltbrt. 

Experiments are still in i^rogress, and it is believed that figures still 
more truthful and life-like than any that have yet been produced will 
be the result. The most serious difficulty to be overcome is in the 
treatment of the surface of the figures and their coloring. AVe use 
only plaster of Paris. Wax, which has been so often employed for faces 
and hands, has been discarded as being too delicate, and not so well suited 
for life-like effects as plaster. Papier-mache, as has been stated, our 
workmen can not manipulate so as to produce sufhcient hardness of 
surface and delicacy of line. The gelatine which has been used for 
natural history preparations oflers no absolute permanence. Plaster of 
Paris has only one objection, which is the roughness of its surface. It 
is now believed that the smoothness and texture of the flesh can be 
produced by the use of some of the mineral waxes. 

The question of coloring is a more difficult one. Our Japanese figures, 
on close examination, do not present a uniform hue, but have a solid 
body color, enlivened by innumerable dots of a much darker tone. 
These are produced by some spatter-work process, either by spraying 
from a stiff brush, or by blowing the pigment in a fine spray from the 
mouth. When viewed at a short distance, the effect is precisely that 
of living flesh. Experiments are now being made with the air brush, 
which will doubtless produce the same effect. 

The rei)resentation of human hair, especially of the beard, also pre- 
sents great difficulties; but it is believed that in time the use of plas- 
ter and paint will supplant the products of the wig factory. 

It will be observed that the steps of progress in modeling man have 
been very similar to those in the mounting of the lower animals, and 
the influence of the skilful American taxidermist has been felt every- 
where in this work also. 

Allusion has already been made to the taxidermy at the Holub exhi- 
bition in Prague. The mounting of anthropological groups was even 
more ambitious and successful, and is illustrated here by three plates, 
showing a group in action, a group in repose, and a single figure to 
show details of modeling. [Plates, 53, 54, 55.] In the anthropological 
as well as the zoological groups, the generous space of the exposition 



56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

aifoided opportunities which are not often available iu museums. 
Indeed the permanence of museum work seems to demand not only 
greater comj^actness, but more reserve, repose, and dignity than is 
necessary iu installation for a tem])orary exhibition. 

ENVIRONMENTAL (iROUPS, 

It is not expected that in the ethnographical museum of the future 
the lay figure will supplant the show case as a means for displaying 
ethnograi)hic collections; but just as naturalists may feel it legitimate 
to use a considerable number of cases of animals mounted in the midst 
of natural surroundings to illustrate their habits or to make impressive 
memorials of species which are rarely seen or likely to become extin(;t, 
so will the anthropologist employ figures, not only for the education of 
the public, but as a more sure means of preserving certain of the most 
precious memorials of the primitive races of mankind. 

It will soon be time to consider the question to what extent museums 
arejustitied in the use of environmental groups. It is evident that this 
may be carried too far and be made tiresome instead of agreeable to 
visitors, while at the same time producing an effect quite opposite to 
that of dignified and systematic order, which should be characteristic 
of every museum. Furthermore, specimens thus mounted, unless the 
workmanshij) is of the very best and the cases practically perfect and 
impervious to air, are certain to deteriorate, since it is very difficult to 
get at them in order to cleanse them and protect them from vermin. 
The writer has seen neglected cases of this kind in some of the largest 
government museums of the Old World, which were serious warnings 
against departure from the practice of individual mounts in cases free 
from the incnmbrance of accessories. 

In the National Museum a definite limit has been fixed. Environ- 
mental groups will only be made in the case of the larger inammals and 
birds which are rarely seen and are on the verge of extinction, or for 
the purpose of illustrating some very remarkable habit. 

It has been found in the installation of our department of birds 
that the series of Audubon's j)lates, showing the habits of birds, framed 
and hung near the exhibition cases, are almost as effective as the 
groups mounted to illustrate the same ])hases in their habits. 

CONCERNlNCr OOLLECTIONS AND SPECIMENS. 

The following principles in regard to collections and specimens rep- 
resent in a general way the ideas which underlie all our recent work: 

CoUcctiou.s in general. — Any object which has a name may be used in 
museum work. It does not follow, however, that any one museum 
should attempt to include all such objects, nor that there are not many 
which, in the present stage of museum practice, might not be entirely 
neglected.

Plate 55. 




REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 57 

Specimens m a museum are like the types in a i)riiitiugofBce. They 
may be sorted in tlie eases in conventional order so as to be accessible 
when needed, or ibey may be used to make intelligible almost any train 
of thought or series of ideas, each being available in hundreds of dif- 
ferent relationships. 

Single or unrelated specimens, though v;iluable or interesting, are iu 
themselves of little moment in comparison with series of much less 
precious objects which unite to teach some lesson to student or visitor. 

Cumbersome and superfluous materials in collections. — One of the great- 
est perils to a museum is the possession of vast collections. 

Collections which are encumbered with conditions as to manner of 
disposition and installation are usually causes of serious embarrass- 
ment. 

Not the least important duty of the curator is to prevent the acces- 
sion of undesirable material. 

Material not germane to the plan of a nmseuni should be exchanged 
or given to other museums which have use for it. What is expensive 
and unprofitable to one may be of the greatest use to another. 

Advances in any museum are effected not only by accession and 
enlargement, but by the constant substitution of better specimens, by 
advance in methods of display, labeling, and handbooks. 

The principal uses of specimens. — A museum is rarely justified in 
exhibiting all its materials. An exhibition series, when properly 
installed, is more effective when limited than when extensive. 

Specimens not needed in the exhibition series are much more useful 
when placed in a reserve or study series, either to be used by students; 
to be exchanged or given to other nuiseums, or to be employed when 
occasion may offer in forming new exhibition series. 

The exhibition series.— The effectiveness of a museum for popular cul 
ture depends chiefly upon : 

(1) A careful selection and effective arrangement of the specimens 
exhibited (which implies the exclusion of many objects in themselves 
attractive and interesting). 

(2) A thorough system of labels in simple language, supplemented 
by pictures, diagrams, maps, and books of reference. 

(3) Si)e('imens for exhibition should be selected solely with reference 
to the lesson they can teach, singly or in combination. 

(4) To complete a series, any specimen is better than none. 

(5) A copy, model, or ]>icture of a good thing is often more useful 
than an actual specimen of a poor one. 

(6) A picture or model may often be shown to advantage in place of 
a minute or unintelligible object. 

(7) Books, manuscripts, pictures, maps, etc., become specimens when 
treated in the museum method. 

The study series: 

(1) Specimens in the study series should be acipiired in series sufli- 



58 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

cieutly large to meet the needs of students who are known to exist. 
While nothing" of value should be lost, it is questionable whether mate- 
rial should besought in large quantity, when there is no indication that 
it will soon be needed. 

(2) Study specimens should be stored as compactly and economically 
as is consistent with their safety and convenient use, and should be 
accessible to every student. 

(3) The study series is the storehouse from Mhich the exhibition 
series may be replaced or extended and from which the needs of other 
museums may be supplied. 

Records. — The most important fact concerning any object is the local- 
ity where it was found; next most important, the person from whom it 
was received. Every specimen should have its catalogue number 
indelibly engraved or marked upon it, and, when possible, the locality 
and source. Specimens can be named at any time, but the locality 
once lost, the object becomes comparatively valueless. The record of 
donors should be accurate and complete, so that the specimens from 
any given source can be traced at once to their location. 



III.- SPECIAL TOPICS OF THE YEAR. 

THE UNUSUAL CHARACTER OF THE YEAR'S WORK. 

The activities of the entire staff liave been in a large degree diverted 
to exposition work, as they were last year and are likely to be for a year 
to come. Many of the Museum halls have been closed, being needed 
for the work of mounting and packing the collections. Many of our 
employees have been transferred to the exhibition staff, and at the time 
of this report are absent in Chicago, while a considerable number of 
others have been detailed for special service at the fair, or have been 
given special leaves of absence to attend the congresses or to act as 
judges of awards. 

A large number of specimens and cases have been withdrawn from 
the exhibition halls and sent to the expositions in Madrid and Chicago, 
and it has required the utmost ingenuity to fill the gaps thus caused,' 
so that the collections may be presentable in the eyes of the visitors, 
who are quite as numerous this year, and among whom are many from 
foreign lands. 

Indeed, the occasion is really a revolution in museum affairs, and it 
will require fully a year after the return of the collections next winter 
to readjust the collections and to reestablish customary routine. 

All of this is accepted without complaint, because, though the 
Museum undoubtedly loses much more than it gains on such occasions, 
the opportunity for popular education is too important to be neglected, 
and the anniversary is one for which no outlay of labor and expense 
can be too great. 

The effect of this upheaval, extending as it has and will over a period 
of nearly four years, must, however, of necessity be manifest in this 
report, and it should be read with the facts just mentioned in mind. 

The responsibility of the Assistant Secretary in preparing for the two 
expositions, and the completion of the report on the deep-sea fishes of the 
Albatross and Blalce expeditions, and his long absence from the city on 
official duty, have rendered it impossible for hiui to attend, as usual, to 
the details of museum administration, except in connection with the 
present report. Mr. Frederick W. True, as curator in charge, has very 
faithfully and successfully dh-ected the work of this unusually trying 
year. 

CHANGES IN THE FORM OF THE ANNUAL REPORTS. 

Each report upon the Museum is intended to convey to every one inter- 
ested in its work, and especially to Congress, an exact idea of what 
has been done during the year, the relation of the work done to that of 

. 59 



60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

previous years, and to the plans for the future. So far as it is deemed 
likely to be of public, iuterest, reasons are always given for the course 
pursued, especially when there are changes in method and policy. 

It is also intended to sliow fully what new museum materials have 
come into the possession of the Government during the year and how 
it has been assigned, what is being done to preserve and utilize the 
old collections, and when, in accordance Mitli law, material has been 
distributed to other institutions, to show what has been done witli it. 

The report then must of necessity discuss hundreds of thousands of 
small details, and it is exceedingly difficult to handle them so system- 
atically that the reference to anyone of these details can be at once 
found. 

With the growth of the Museum the system has been becoming 
yearly more complicated, and the body of the report constantly more 
and more filled up with tables and statistical summaries. 

In the attempt to avoid what is becoming a burden, many of the state- 
ments heretofore included in the main report have this year been placed 
in appendixes. The discussions of the gifts and other accessions have, 
so far as possible, been assembled in a special appendix under the con- 
trol of indexes, which show not only the source but the disposition of 
each object by museum departments, and also group the objects by 
geogiaphical origin. 

Still further concentration has been made by doing away with the 
special reports of the curators upon their respective departments and 
incorporating their substance in the general report upon the progress 
of the Museum. This is an experiment, and it is not impossible that 
hereafter the old system may, at least in part, be resumed. 

THE MUSEUM STAFF. 

There are at the present time thirty-two organized departments and 
sections in the Museum under the care ol curators and assistant cura- 
tors, and eight administrative divisions.* 

The following changes in the personnel of the scientific departments 
have occurred during the year: 

Dr. William S. Dixon, honorary curator of the section of materia 
medica, was detached by the Secretary of the Navy on January."), 181Ki, 
for duty in the office of the Surgeon-General, and was succeeded by Dr. 
C. H. White, U. S. Navy. 

Mr. W. S. Yeates, who has for many years filled the position of assist- 
ant curator of the Department of Minerals in the National Museum, 
resigned on June 14, 1893, to accept the post of State Geologist of 
Georgia. 

Dr. George Vasey, honorary curator of the Department of Botany in 
the National Museum, died March 4, 1893, and Mr. Frederick V. Coville, 



'A list of the scientific aud administrative officers is printed in Appendix i. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Gl 

who succeeded liim as botauist in the l)ei)artiiieiit of Aoricultuie, lias 
been phiced iu charge of the Department of Botany in the Museum. 
A fuller reference to Dr. Vasey will be found in a subse(iuent page. 

Mr. J. E. Watkins, curator of the section of transportation and engi- 
neering- ill the National Museum, was granted leave of absence October 
1, 1892, to take charge of the exhibit of the Pennsylvania Railroad 
Company at tlie World's Fair, and the work of collecting and organiz- 
ing the historical collections shown by that railroad in Chicago has since 
occupied his time. 

APPROPRIATIONS FOR 1895-'94. 

The sum total of the appropriations is |16(),000, which is $5,000 less 
than for the previous Hscal year, and $47,500 less than for 1891-'92. 
The items are as follows:

Furniture and fixtures : ,q q,^ 

P""t'"g .^...... r2,m 

Heating and lighting j^ q^q 

P^^t'^-e '500 

166,000 
It is a source of serious embarrassment that the appropriations have 
been reduced, and but for the fact that this reduction is part of a gen- 
eral system of economy growing out of the necessities of the Govern- 
ment, and affects all branches of the Government alike, it would be very 
discouraging. As it is, the situation has been accepted loyally and 
cheerfully; and though the growth of the Museum and its eflficiency 
are of necessity greatly interfered with, the effort has been made to 
accomplish the best results with the means available, while waiting for 
a time of greater prosperity. One of the most serious inconveniences 
has been the necessity of discharging a number of men, who have been 
trained for the special work of the Museum, whose services are essential 
to its efficiency, and whom it will be difficult to replace iu the future. 

INCREASE IN THE COLLECTIONS. 

At the close of 1881 a census of the collections was taken, resulting 
in the preparation of a table, published in subseiiuent reports, wliich 
gave 193,302 as the approximate total number of specimens of all kinds 
at that time entered in the catalogue books of the several departments 
of the Museum. The census for the year ending June 30, 1893, ])laces 
the total number of specimens of all kinds «-t 3,300,020. It nuist, how- 
ever, be stated that a large proportion of the material catalogued iu 
1884 and in later years had been in the custody of the Smithsonian 
Institution for several years, but had remained in storage <m account of 
there being no opportunity to have it classitied and entered in the cat- 
alogue books.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 



There still remaius iu the basement of the Smithsouiaii building and 
in the old Armory building much material, consisting largely of gifts 
from foreign governments and contributions from expositions, which has 
not yet been brought under control, owing to lack of space and other 
necessary facilities. 

The number of accessions receiv^ed in 181)2-'J)3 was 1,260 (Ace. Xos. 
25885 to 27150, inclusive), embracing, in all, 82,148 specimens, distrib-

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 



CATALOGUE ENTRIES. 

The entries made in tbe catalogue of the departiiieiits dmiiio- the 
year have numbered 19,708. This is less than one-half of the number 
for 181>L», l)nt the decrease in this direction is readily accounted for by 
the fact that most of the curators were busily occupied during the 
entire year with the preparation of exhibits for the World's Columbian 
Exposition, and that all collections received have not yet been cata- 
logued. 

The following table shows the number of entries made in each depart-

roOPERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS 
OF THE GOVERNMENT. 

The growth of the Museum has always depended to a considerable 
degree'ii])on the friendly cooperation of the various Executive Depart- 
ments, and the encouragement which they have given to their officers 
to assist in the increase of the collections and to some extent in their 
administration. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69 

Witlitho exception of the s[)ecial Musciiiii of Ilyoiene niuintaiiied by 
tlie Navy Department and tlie Army Medical Museum, the nucleus of 
which are the surgical and pathological collections develo])ed in the 
course of the preparation of the medical and surgical liistories of the 
war, no departmental museums have been formed, and the collections 
which have incidentally resulted from their activities have been 
promptly transferred to the custody of the Smithsonian Institution. 

The association of the Museum with the scientific bureaus whose 
work requires the use of Museum material, has always been intimate 
and friendly. 

The collections of the Geological Survey arc deposited in the Museum 
and incorporated with the general collection, while the interests of l)oth 
establishments are advanced through the detail of certain of the 
scientific investigators connected with the Survey, to act as curators or 
custodians of the combined collections. In this way, Prof. Marsh, .Mr. 
Walcott, Dr. White, Prof. \Yard, and Prof. Clarke are attached to the 
scientific staff of the ^luseum. 

Between the Fish Commission and the Museum a similar and even 
more intimate relationship exists, since tbe Museum undertakes to 
publish all the results of work upon the Fish Commission collections, 
except those which relate to economic fishes, or, have in some way a 
l)ositive economic value. Dr. Rathbun and Dr. Beau, officers of the 
Fish Commission, have been for many years m charge of departments 
in the Museum. 

With the Department of Agriculture the same kind of alliance has 
always existed. The National Herbarium, the depository of all the 
plants belonging to the Smithsonian Iiistituti<m, as well as those which 
have been obtained by the Department of Agriculture, is under the 
charge of Mr. Coville, botanist of the Department and also an honorary 
curator in the :\Iuseum, and this collection is deposited in the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. The insects, on the other hand, with relation to 
which Prof. P.iley, the entomologist of the Department, holds a similar 
relationship, are in the Museum. The collections of the division of 
Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy are also deposited in the 
Museum, and are under the general c<mtrol of Dr. C. Hart Merriam, 
chief of the division, who is practically, though not nominally, a mem- 
ber of the Museum staff. The chief of the Forestry Division of the 
Department, Dr. Fcruow, is in charge of the somewhat chaotic mass of 
material illustrating the methods of forestry and the wc.odworking 
industries, which has as yet no definite place in either establishmenr. 
The Department has a temporary museum in a wooden building upon 
its own reservation, in which are placed on view a large number of 
objects of interest to agriculturists, and which is the source of the mate- 
rial which the Department is often called upon to exhibit at expositions. 
A considerable mass of technological material is also lvei)t in the 
National .Museum, chiefly in storage, awaiting the time when it shall be 



70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 181)3. 

found i)racticable to build up ii technological collection in connection 
with the museum system of \N'ashington. 

Until withiu a few years, a military museum was nuxiutained in oue 
of the buildings belonging to the War Department. When this wasabau- 
doued in 1888, its contents were distributed among the arnu)ries and 
arsenals throughout the country, in each of which some sort of museum 
is maintained, but a considerable remainder, of a purely historical char 
acter, was transferred to the National jMuseum. 

The old "National Cabinet of Curiosities" was long in eliarge of the 
Interior Department, this arrangement dating from the days when the 
old National Institute occupied a room in the so called Patent Oflice 
building. This was transferred in 1858 to the Smithsonian Institution, 
but a thread of administrative connection still attached the Museum 
to the Dei)artment of the Interior until 1888, when, as narrated in the 
Report of the Museum for that year, the Secretary of the Interior, hav- 
ing investigated the law, decided that he had no official resi)onsibility 
in connection with the Museum, and that the entire control should be 
left to the Smithsonian Institution. 

These facts are mentioned simply to show that, by general consent, 
the museum interests of the Capital are becoming yearly more concen- 
trated, in accordance with the manifest intent of Congress m the act 
establishing the Smithsonian Institution. 

It seems proper in each Annual Re}»ort to make special acknowledg- 
ment of the kindly cooperation of the Executive Departments in the 
general work of the Museum. 

The Department of State has, as always in the past, encouraged its 
consular offi(!ers to make collections, and has transmitted with favor- 
able rec-ommendations every request in behalf of the Museum, and these 
officers have almost without exception responded enthusiastically to 
the requests made of them. From such cooperation as this the ^luseum 
has everything to hope in the future, and were it possiV)le to expend a 
few thousands of dollars through the consular service each year, addi- 
tions of Moiideiful value might be obtained from every (juarter of the 
globe. 

Among those who have rendered special service during the past year 
should be mentioned Mr. Henry Andrews, U. S. Consul, Ilankow, China; 
Mr. 11. M. Bartleman, U. S. Legation, Carticas, Venezuela: Hon. Trux- 
ton IJeale, U. S. Consul-General, Teheran, Persia; Mr. Erhard Bissinger, 
U. S. Consul. Beirut, Syria; Hon. S. H. M. Byers, U. S. Consul-General, 
St. Gall, Switzerland; Mr.J.Lyall, acting U.S.Consul^Singapore, Straits 
Settlements; Mr. Lewis Dexter, U. S. Consul, Fayal, Azores; Mr. Louis 
B. Grant, acting U. S, Consul-General, Cairo, Egypt; ^fr. Augustine 
Heard, U.S. Consul-General, Seoul, Korea; Mr. Frank von Phul, Vice 
Consul, San -luan del Norte, Nicaragua, and Mr. Alexander Webb, U. S. 
Consul, Manila, Philippine Islands. The character of their contribu 
tions is described under their respective names in the list of acces- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 71 

sious iu Appendix Vi, as is the case also of tliose of rlic otlier persons 
mentioned in this same connection. 

The Treasury Department has rendered most important service by 
facilitating- the entry of material from foreign countries through the 
custom-liouse. In this connection special acknowledgments are due to 
Mr. John Quackenbush, by whom the packages received through the 
New York custom-liouse luive been forwarded, in connection with his 
voluntary services as New York agent of the Smithsonian Institution. 
The following oflficers of the Treasury have been especially etlicient in 
their efforts to increase the collections of the Museum : Dr. S. J. Call, 
U. S. Eevenue Marine Service; Mr. J. A. Clampitt, V. S. Life-Saving 
Service; Mr. J. Q. Lamer, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and Mr. 
J. ITenry Turner, U. S. Coast and (ieodetic Survey. 

Under the ^^'ar Department the Quartermaster-General of the Army 
has greatly aided the Museum by furnishing transportation for bulky 
and cumbersome collections from the Western States, which without 
this assistance it would have been almost impossible for the .Museum to 
have acquired. To Capt. John F. Eogers, U. S. Army, of the Quarter- 
master's Department, is due especial acknowledgment for his super- 
vision of the transportation of the Museum ^Vol•ld's Fair material from 
Washington to Chicago. The following-named officers of the Army 
have made valuable contributions: Dr. Timothy E. Wilcox, major ami 
surgeon; Dr. J. C. Merrill, captain and assistant surgeon; Dr. Fdgar 

A. Mearns, captain and assistant surgeon; Capt. John ii. IJourke, 
Capt. Charles E. Bendire, Capt. Henry Komeyn, Capt. Sawyer. Lieut! 
H. C. Benson, Lieut. Wirt Robinson, and Dr. E. W. Shuffeldt. 

To the Xavy Department acknowledgment is due for the detail of a 
medical officer to act as curator of the section of materia medica, while 
the following-named officers have contributed to the collections: Lieut. 
G. T. Emmons, Lieut. C. F. Pond, Ensign W. E. Safford, Dr. C. H. 
White, .Alessrs, J. S. Carpenter, A. S. Greene, and W. S. Moore. 

Under the Department of the Interior, with the exception of the 
specimens contributed by Dr. Z. T. Daniel and Mr. Charles 11. Thoiiip- 
son, officials of the Indian Otlice, the chief assistance has been from the 
U. S. Geological Survey. The extent of the accessions from this source 
is fully shown in the list of accessions, and special acknowledgments 
are also due the following officers of the Survey f(.r their hearty coop- 
eration: Maj. J. W. Powell, director; Mr. CD. Walcott, Mr.' Frank 
Burns, Prof. F. W. Clarke, Mr. Whitman Cross, Dr. J. S. Diller, Mr. 

B. K. Emerson. Mr. S. F. Emmons, Dr. W. F. Hillebrand, Dr. W. P. 
Jenney, Mr. L. C. Johnson, Dr. W. H. :\Ielville, Dr. A. C. Peale. Prof! 
S. L. Penticld, I'rof. I. C. llussell. and Dr. B. E. C. Stearns. 

Several large and interesting collections have been received from the 
Department of Agriculture, its otliccrs.and persons officially connected 
with it. A full report of the transmissions will be found in the list of 
accessions. The names of the contributors of collections are given in 



72 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

the following list: Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Prof. C. V. Kiley, .Mr. F. L. J. 
Boettcher, Dr. A. K. Fisher, Mr. Albert Hassall, Mr. Frauk II. Hitch- 
cock, Mr. Theodore IIoliii, ^Iv. J. F. James, Dr. George ^larx. Dr. E. 
Palmer, Mr. E. A, Preble, and -Mr. II. E, Van Demau. 

The U. S. Fish Commission is so closely associated in its work with 
the Museum, and each year contributes so extensively to its collections, 
that it seems almost impossible to make special acknowledgments 
apart from those in the list of accessions. Keference must however 
be made to the assistance rendered by the following officers of the 
Commission : Col. ^Marshall McDonald, U. S. Commissioner of Fisheries; 
Dr. Kichard llathbun, Dr. T. H. F)ean (both honorary curators), Mr. 
Viual N^. Edwards, Prof B. W. Evermaun, Dr. E. R. Gurley, Dr. Hugh 
M. Smith, Mr. C. H. Townseud, and :Mr. S. G. Worth. 

Since the Bureau of American Ethnology is, like the National Museum, 
a branch of the Smithsonian Institution, it is scarcely perhaps ])roper 
to refer to it under this head, exce])t to say that its entire stafl"is con- 
stantly in cooperation with that of the Museum, During the past year 
special contributions have been received from the following persons con- 
nected with the Bureau : Maj. J. W. Powell, director ; Mr. F. H. Cashing, 
Dr. A. S. Gatschet, Mr. H. W. Henshaw, Mr. F. Webb Hodge, Dr. W. 
J. Hoffman, ^Ir. -lames Mooney, and Mr. James C. Pilling. 

SPECIAL EXPLORATIONS. 

During the year special (collections from various parts of the world 
have been made by explorers who have offered their services to the 
Smithsonian Institution, and many of whom have been supplied with 
instruments and materials for collecting. 

Among the most interesting groups of objects sent m from abroad are 
those collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott in Kashmir and other parts of 
India; from the Seychelles, from Aden, and from Aldabra. (xlorioso, 
and the adjacent islands. Dr. Abbott is a man of private means, whose 
interest in exploration and in field sports is happily supplemented by 
great enthusiasm for natural history work. His collections cover every 
branch of natm-al history, as well as ethnology, and are sent to the 
Museum with the understanding that they shall be promptly studied 
and des('ril)ed and the results i)ublished. A number of papers descrip- 
tive of his collections have already a})i»eared, and others are in prci)a- 
ration. Dr. Abbott has previously sent much imijortant material from 
Kilima-Njaro and other important localities in Africa. 

Equally im])ortaiit have been the explorations of a similar charac- 
ter made by Mr. William Astor Chanler, of New York City, who has 
already sent in extensive ethnological, zoological, and botanical collec- 
tions from Mashonaland, the Tana River, and other localities in East 
Africa. 

Mr. 11. C. Moore, while making explorations in South Africa, obtained 
a valuable collection of skins, skulls, and horns of antelopes and other 
large animals. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 73 

The Hon. ^^■ilIi;lIll \\'o()<l\ ille Kockhill, Third Assistant Secretary of 
State, broug'lit with him ironi Tibet, as the result of his exph)rati(»iis 
under the ausi)ieesof the Suiithsoniau Institution, a most valuable col- 
lection of ethnological objects, which were acquired by the Museum, 
and a special catalogue of which is published in this volume. 

Mr. I*. L. Jouy. of the National IMuseum. was sent to ^lexico to make 
special natural history collections. 

Among the exi)lorers within the limits of the United States. Dr. Edgar 
A. Mearns, U. S. Army, who is attached to the ^Mexican Boundary 
Commission, deserves special mention. Dr. Mearns has been fur- 
nished with every appliance for natural history work in the field, and 
at the request of the ]\Iuseum has received special facilities for scientific 
work, and the material sent in by him, as shown in the list of accessions 
and the curators' reports, is of great value to science. 

Prof George P. Merrill, Mr. Barton A. Bean, and Mr. William Palmer, 
of the Museum staff, have also made collections in the tield. 

No allusion is made at this time to the important collections obtained 
especially for the exhibit of the Bureau of P^thnology and the Museum 
at the World's Fair. These will be referred to in the report of next 
year. 

Offers to collect specimens are frequently received from persons con- 
templating a visit to some remote portion of the United States or to 
foreign countries. In the event that the locality is one from wliich 
material is desired, the National Museum has always been glad to sup- 
ply collecting outfits, consisting of ammunition, traps, tanks, alcohol, etc. 
In this way a considerable amount of valuable material has been added 
to the collections, and the thanks of the Museum are due to its many 
friends who have thus exerted themselves in its behalf. 

During the past year collecting outfits and materials of various kinds 
have been sent to the following persons: ]\Ir. Harlan I. Smith, Madison- 
ville, Hamilton County, Ohio; Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U. S. Army, Inter- 
national Boundary Commisson, Bisbee, Ariz.; Mr. R. M. Bartleman, 
U. S. legation, Caracas, Venezuela; Mr. C. W, Richmond, Greytown, 
Nicaragua; Mr. J. H. Camp, Leopoldville, Congo District, Africa; ]Mr. 
Henry D. Woolfe, Valparaiso, Chile; Mrs. F. E. B. Latham, Micco, Bre- 
vard County, Fla.; Mr. Afark B. Kerr, Tumaco, Colombia: Dr. Einar 
Lonnberg, Orlando, Fla.; Prof S. E. ]\Ieek, Fayetteville, Ark.: Mr. 
Frank X. Holzner, Nogales, Sonora; Mr. H. C. (Janter, Mammoth Cave, 
Kentucky; Dr. E. P. Bigelow, Kingston, Jamaica; and Dr. Leonhard 
Stejneger, of the National Museum. 

DEVELOPMENT AND AURANOEMENT OE THE EXIIIUnK )N SERIES. 

The overcrowded condition of rlie exliibition lialls. which has been 
referred to in the annual reports for the past few years, "continues to 
exist, and although it has been impossible to undertake any radical 
improvements looking toward the extension and rearrangement of the 
collections on exhibition, manv minor alterati<»ns have been made. 



74 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

The collections of oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial were 
temporarily removed to the east ball, next to the rotunda. The work 
of lalK^liug the speinmens on exhibition in the section of graphic arts 
has been continued and is now nearly tinished. Additions have been 
made to the collection, but no uew^ series have been begun. It was 
found necessary, owing to the crowded condition of the north hall, to 
place in teni])orary storage the entire collection of medals and coins. 
The collection of historical objects now on exhibition includes auto 
graph papers and i)ersonal relics of many of the Presidents of the 
United States, and of soldiers, statesmen, and other eminent Ameri- 
cans, as well as memorials of imi)ortant events in the history of the 
country. A number of specimens were withdrawn from the exhibition 
series in the section of transportation and engineering for exhibition 
at the World's Columbian Exposition, among them the locomotive 
"John Bull" and the valuable collection of early typewriting machines. 
In the section of nuiteria medica some new material has been jjlact-d 
upon exhibition during the year, and the condition of the collection is 
very satisfactory. 

The installation in the nmmmal hall of a collection of mounted heads 
of African antelopes, deposited by Mr. William Astor ('hauler, has 
been commenced, and a few specimens have been j^urchased to till gaps 
in the exhibition series. 

In the department of birds a number of new specimens have been 
placed on exhibition. The work of mounting and labeling the collection 
of vertebrate fossils has been carried on during the year. The i)rei)ara 
tion of a series of restorations of extinct animals of North America is in 
progress, a number of specimens having already been complete<l. It 
isproposed to utilize the wall space above the cases for their exhibition. 
The work of arranging the material in the department of mollusks has 
been finished, and the collection now i)resents a very satisfactory 
appearance. A large portion of the exhibit vseries was sent to the 
World's Fair, requiring the preparation of tifty-six boxes of native and 
exotic species, from the duplicates, to take their i)lace. A new series 
of North American insects, comprising ISI species, was placed on exhi- 
bition in the early part of the fiscal year. The collection of the depart- 
ment of marine invertebrates was overhauled after the completion of 
the I'epairs in the west hall of the Smithsonian building. Considerable 
time has been devoted to tilling up gaps in the exhibition series in the 
department of comparative anatomy, and the collection of manunal 
skeletons is now nearly complete. The preparation of some new series 
for the exhibition hall is under consideration. 

A large quantity of material was temporarily withdrawn from the 
exhibition series in the department of minerals for the World's Colum- 
bian Ex])osition. At the close of the exposition these specimens will 
be restored to their old places an<l new material will be added, involv- 



KEI'OKT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 75 

iiiji' a yeueriil rearraugeiueiit of and a cousiderabk' inciease in the 
exliibition series. The material .sent by the department of geology 
to the World's Columbian lv\positit»n was prei)are<l with a view to 
making it till a definite place in the collection when returned. A large 
jiroportion of the time of the curator has been devoted to the exhibition 
series, and important improvements have been made in the manner of 
displaying specimens in the table cases. 

1.A15ELS. 

During the fiscal year ending June 3U, ISIKJ, there were printed, 
10,814 descriptive labels (aggregating nearly 1*50,000 copies), or more 
than double the number usually printed in the course of a year. The 
large increase was caused chiefly by the necessary preparation of labels 
for the exhibit of the Museum at the World's Columbian Exposition at 
Chicago. All the departments of the Museum were represented in the 
series. 

LIBRARY. 

The Museum maintains a working library, covering the fields of 
zoology, botany, paleontology, geology, geography, anthropology, 
archteology, and the arts. This library is kei)t in the Museum build- 
ings, and is quite distinct from the general library of the Smithsonian 
Institution, which is deposited in the Library of Congress, which it to 
a certain extent duplicates. A large proportion of the books in the 
Museum library are lent by the Institution. During the past year the 
number of publications added to the library was 501 volumes of more 
than 100 pages, 1,457 pamphlets, besides parts of serials, of which 272 
volumes, 821 pamphlets, and (>,981 parts of serials were those temim- 
rarily retained for the use of the jMuseum from the accessions of the 
Smithsonian Institution. The remainder were obtained by gift, 
exchange, or purchase. 

In connection with the central library of reference, nearly every 
department has its own " sectional " or working library. The largest of 
these arethe sectional library of geology with 1.4(M)titles,of entomology 
with 1,200, of ornithology with 880, of oriental anti(|uities with 8(52, and 
of mineralogy with G50. 

CONTRIHl rioNS OF THE YEAR lO SCIENTIFIC LCrERATlTRE. 

A large number of papers upon scientific subjects have been ])nb- 
lislied by officials of the ^Museum and other specialists. These are, 
for the most part, based on collections in the ^Museum, and are referred 
to by title in the bibliography, Appendix vii. The authors of these 
l)ai)ers are ninety-two in number, thirty-seven of whom are connected 
with the Smithsonian Institution or the National .Museum. The pai)ers

PUBLICATIONS OF THE MUSEUM. 

The publicatioiis are issued in four series, us follows: 

Annual report. — This report constitutes the second part of the 
rei^ort of the Smithsonian Institution to Congress, and, commencing 
with the year 1884, has been printed as a separate volume. The reports 
for 1881, 1882, and 1883 were printed in the reports of the Smithsonian 
Institution for those years, and were reprinted in pamphlet form. The 
series of Annual Keports of tlie Museum now consists of nine volumes 
(1884-'9l*, inclusive). 

It is customary to send a copy of the report to eacli ]>erson who lias 
sent specimens to the Museum during the year. 

In the api)endix to each volume are printed papers, usually illus- 
trated, and based upon, or ex])lauatory of, collections in the National 
jNIuseum. A limited edition of each paper is i)rinted in separate form 
for special distribution, and is found especially useful in the encourage- 
ment of gifts and in exchange for publications. 

The edition of the report, which was in 181*0 10,(HK), and in 1891 
11),U00, was in 1892 reduced to lO.OOO, thereby greatly diminishing its 
usefulness. Of the 10,()()(> now printed, 7,000 copies are for the use of 
the Institution and the ^Museum, the remaining .■>,()0() copies being

reserved for distribution by Senators and Kepreseiitatives. The report 
is sent to about 4,000 libraries at home and abroad, to contributors to 
the collections, and to the correspondents of the ]\Insenm who are inter- 
ested in its welfiire. 

Proceedings. — The series of "Proceedings of the U. IS. ^s'ational 
Museum" was begun in 1878, and was established for the purpose of 
securing i)rompt publication of discoveries in the ^luseuni, and is 
printed in octavo. Vols, r and ii were reprinted in Vol./ xix of the 
•'Miscellaneous Collections of the Smithsonian Institution," and Vols. 
Ill and lY were reprinted in Vol. xxri of that series. This method of 
rei)rinting was, however, not carried beyond tlie fourth volume, l-"ach 
article in the series has its special number, and the total numl)ci' ])ub- 
lished up to August 1, 1894, was 1,000. 

Since the beginning of Vol. xir, commencing with No. 7G1, the i)apers 
in this series have been printed separately, in advance of the imblica- 
tion of the bound volume, and have been distributed among S])ecialists 
interested in the topics discussed. 

The complete volumes are reserved for public institution.'^ and libra- 
ries.

Vol, XVII, for 1804, was ill progress of i)ub]ication when the manuscript 
of this re]K)rt was sent in, and is now in press, Pai)ers JI70-1000, which 
form parts of this volume, had already been i)ublished separately. 

The Bulletin.— The publication of the -'Bulletins of the U. S. 
National Museum" was commenced in 1875 for the purpose of illus- 
trating the collections of natural history and ethnology belonging to 
the I'uited States, Forty-six numbers have been ])rinted, all in octavo. 

The first 10 numbers of the IJuHetin were repiinted in Vols, xiii (Xos. 
1-10), XXIII (Xos. 11-1.")), and xxiv (No. IG) of ".Miscellaneous Collec- 
tions of 'the Smithsonian Institution," and were distributed in this form

to institutions and libraries, but this method of reprinting and distri- 
bution lias been discontinued. 

The Special BulletiH.s.— The "Special Bulletin of the U. S. National 
Museum," a series in (piarto, corresponding to the " memoirs" of many 
similar establishments, was established in 1892 for the publication of 
elaborate, illustrated monographs. 

LIST OK SIMXIAL BlI.l.ETINS. 

No. 1. Life Histories of North American Birds, with special reference to their 
breeding habits and eggs. By Maj. Charles Bendire, U. 8. Army., pp. i-viii, l-44(;. 
Plates i-xii. 1892. This -work treats of the game birds, pigeons, and birds ot prey, 
the arrangement adopted being that of the American Ornithologists' Union. 

No. 2. Oceanic Ichthyology. By O. Brown Goode and Tarleton H. Bean. (lu 
press.) An exhaustive monograph of the deep sea fishes of the world. The volume 
will contain upward of 600 pages and will be accompanied by an atlas of 123 plates, 
with more than 400 figures of deep-sea fi.shes. 

At the time of sending the present volume of the annual report to 
press the papers published in the Proceeding.s (including those belong- 
ing to the sixteenth and seventeenth volumes, which have been issued 
in separate form or are in type) have reached the number of 1,000, and 
it is intended in a later report to print a list of all papers, with annota- 
tions and indexes, based upon Museum material, which have been jnib- 
lished by the Museum, as well as by other departments and bureaus of 
the Government. 

TYPE SPECIMENS. 

Thosespeciinens which have been actually in the hands of investigators 
engaged in original researcli, and especially those which have been 
described in the establishment of new species and genera, and have 
furnished the material for illustration, are recognized by all museums 
as the most precious among their possessions. They form a part of 
the archives of science; they are the vouchers for the accuracy of the 
investigator who has studied the material, and are invaluable to sub- 
sequent students as a means for testing the accuracy of his conclusions. 
They are, therefore, the foundation stones of the fabric of natural 
science, and it is impossible to be too careful in i)reserving them. 

The value of types is at present diftereutly estimated in the several 
brandies of natural liistory, but with the adoption of the stricter 
methods of modern work, and of more strenuous rules in regard to 
priority in nomenclature, the value of types will constantly be more 
highly api)re('iated. Fnique specimens are, by common consent, price- 
less. It often happens that investigators in other cities need to refer 
to types, and applications are often made for their loan from our col- 
lection. The Museum has always endeavored to aid its collaborators 
in their researches by placing collections at their disposal for study, 
and it seems ungracious to refuse such re(iuests, especially when they 
come from those who have lent types to us and are willing to do so in 
the future. Still, the subject is a serious one, and it seems time that a 



REP(^RT OF ASSISTANT SECRKTARY. 79 

stroiiji' position should !»(■ taken, not only lor the security of the treas- 
ures in our own custody, but also to encourage otlu'r institutions to 
care better for their own. It should also be said that a knowledge of 
the fact that a given museum surrounds its types with the strongest 
safeguards Avill lead iij.vestigators not connected with i)ublic museums 
to place their types in its custody, ami that the concentiation of all 
types in a few large museums will be extremely advantageous to 
science. 

With these considerations it has been determined to establish certain 
provisional regulations governing the preservation and loan of type 
specimens belonging to the National ^Museum. The collaborators of 
the ^Museum will not be restricted in their study of type specimens 
further than may be ne<;essary to insure their i)roper care. These 
regulations are as follows: 

(1) Each curator is respousible for the type specimens in his custody. 

(2) No types will be lent, or allowed to be taken out of the buililing, excejitioiis 

beiug made ouly in the case of a limited number of museums with which 
arrangements have been made I'or the interchange of type specimens. 

(3) Every type specimen in the National Museum should be distinguished l)y a 

peculiar label.* 

(4) A special book should be kept by each curator in which all the types under his 

custody should be entered under their catalogue numbers, with full data, 
including a reference to the place of description. 

(5) In the annual report of each department a statement should be made concern- 

ing the condition of the types in its custody. 

(6) When, in the judgment of a curator, it is necessary tor the safety of the types in 

his custody that they be kept in a separate case, arrangements will be made to 
enable him to do this, and curators are requested to call attention to such 
necessity whenever it arises. They will be held responsible for injury to type 
specimens resulting from a failure to take precautionary measures of this kind 

(7) The collection of types in the National ^luseum will be open to inspection aud 

study by any investigator. Curators may, however, impose such restrictions 
as they deem necessary to protect themselves from losses for which they are by 
these regulations held responsible, provided that the free use of the material, 
under the provisions already laid down, is in no way impeded thereby. 

in future discussions of this subject it may be said that <( ti/pein the 
strictest sense of the word is one which has been used by the author 
of a systematic paper as the basis for detailed study, and as the 
loundation of a specitic name. In cases where a considerable number 
of specimens have been used, it is desirable to separate one or nu:)re as 
being the jj>'/w<a>-j/ types, while the other specimens which may have 
been used in the same study for the purjjose of comparison, may be 
regarded as rolUiteral types. It will not always be necessary to apply 
the same rules to the use of the collateral types as to the primary types. 
The importance of a type is, of course, greatly increased when it has 
been nsed by a succession of authorities, and it is important that the 
data regarding such use should be carefully recorded. 

*NoTE. — In the department of mammals and of birds a red label is used, and it is 
suggested that, as far as possible, a similar label should be used in the otherdepart- 
uieuts.

MATERIAL LENT FOR INVESTIGATION. 

It has always been one of tlie aims ofthe National ^Museum to aid, as far 
as possible, i)ersous who are engaged in scientilic investigation. A few 
of the more important trausaetions of this character are liere mentioned. 

A number of specimens of insects of the genn^ Trijpo.vcloii and family 
Pemphredouidic Avere sent to Mr. William Fox, of the Academy of 
Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, to be used in the preparation of a 
review, which Mas afterwards published in the Transactions of the 
American Entomological Society. The African Myriapods, collected 
by Dr. Abbott, were sent to Mr. O. F. Cook, Huntington, N. Y., for 
study and spe(;ial report. Fortj'-two specimens of birds ofthe genera 
Myrnndza, ^yiudUixis, IJmpidoclKuics, Myiarchus, Thri/oiliorxs, and 
Basileiiterus were sent to Mr. Frank M. Chapman, of the American 
Museum of Natural History, New York City, to be used in the prepara- 
tion of a paper on the birds of the island of Trinidad. 

A number of specimens of Scorpa^ioid fishes were lent to Prof. C. H. 
Eigenmann, P)loomington, Ind. There were forwarded to Lieut. Wirt 
Ivobinson, Atlanta, Ga., siiecimens of birds forming part of a collection 
made by him in Curasao and on the coast of Colombia. This material was 
desired for use in the preparation of an illustrated work on the ornithol- 
ogy of the region indicated. Skins and skulls of field, meadow, and 
harvest mice were lent to Dr. J. A. Allen, of the American Museum of 
Natural History, New Y'ork City; also sijecimens ofthe Thamnophiline 
genus Dysifhamnns, for comparison. Twenty-one specimens, represent- 
ing 17 species of birds, were sent to Mr. Osbert Salvin, London, England, 
for examination in connection with the preparation of Vols, xvi and xxi 
of the Catalogue of Birds of the British Museum. They are mentioned 
specifically in the latter volume. One hundred and four specimens of 
birds were lent for examination to Mr. Witmer Stone, of Philadelphia, Pa. 
These were t« be used in the preparation of a paper on the Birds of Brit- 
ish Columbia, based on a collection made by Mr. S. N. Phoads. Skulls 
of bats were sent to Dr. Harrison Allen, of I'hiladelphia, who is engaged 
in the preparation of a monograph on the North American sjiecies. 

Dr. A. S. Packard, of Providence, P. I., who has been engaged iii 
the study of the North American Bombycid moths, was allowed free 
access to the INIuseum collections, and such species as required a more 
detailed study were forwarded to him. Extended anatomical researches 
have been made by Prof. E. D. Cope, in connection with his new 
oi)hiological system. Prof. F. W. Coding, of l^utland. 111., has been 
aided in his study of Fitch's tyijes of insects. Tlie collection of fossil 
plants from the Trinity rocks, near Glen Rose, Tex., were studied by 
Prof. William ."NI. Fontaine, of the University of Virginia, who made an 
elaborate report on the same. Dr. Samuel H. Scuddcr, of Cambridge, 
Mass., has been engaged in an investigation of tlie Orthoptera of the 
Galapagos Islands. The work of Dr. O. P. Hay on the Indiana reptiles 
was completed during the present year. The skulls of bears and fur

seals in the Musouiu collection were studied by Dr. C. Hart Merriaui, 
II. S. Fur-seal Commissiouer, in eounectiou with the Bering Sea contro- 
versy. 

The Museum collection of plants in alcohol was temporarily trans- 
ferred to the Department of Agricultnre for the use of Mr. Tiieodor 
llohn in connection with his studies on the life histories and <;rowth 
of North American plants. The si>ouges belonging to the Museum 
collection of the ftunily Hexactinellid;e, collected in the Pacific Octean 
by the steamer Albatross, have been sent to Prof. F. E. Schulz, of 
Berlin, who is preparing a revision of the group. He will submit 
a paper, based on an examination of these specimens, for publication in 
the Proceedings of the Museum. Arrangements have also been made 
with Dr. Axel Goes, of Sweden, to study the Foraminifera collected in 
the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the Pacific Ocean, and with 
Mr. John Murray, of Edinburgh, to study certain deep-sea deposits 
obtained by the Fish Commission steamers. 

THE I'SE OF THE OOVERNMENT 8CTENTIFIC COLLECTIONS 
BY STUDENTS. 

Congress, by a joint resolution approved April lli, 1892, has formally 
thrown open all the literary and scientific collections in Washington for 
the use of students, with the definitely avowed purpose of encouraging 
the establishment and endowment of institutions of learning at the 
National Cajntal. 

This most important and liberal action is in accord with the tendency 
toward the establishment in Washington of a great national university, 
or of a group of institutions practically national in their scope, for the 
advancement of higher learning. 

The new law does not in any respect modity the attitude of the Smith- 
sonian Institution and National Museum, for from the very beginning 
students and investigators have been welcomed and given every facility 
for their work, and within the past fifty years thousands have availed 
themselves of these privileges. 

The action is significant, however, and especially welcome. l)ecanse 
it shows that the legislative branch of the Government is disposed to 
encourage in every way the use of the collections in Washington, already 
vast in extent, for the one purpose for which, above all others, they are 
adapted. 

The resolution is printed below in lull: 

Whereas large coUectious illustrative of the various arts aud scieuces and faeili- 
tatiiij; literary and scientific research have been accuuinlated by the action of Con- 
gress through a series of years at the National Capital; aud 

Whereas it was the original purpose of the Government thereby to promote research 
and the ditVusion of knowledge, and is now tlie settled policy aud ]ireseut i)ractice 
of those charged with the care of these collections sjiecially to encourage students 
who devote their time to the investigation and study of any branch ol kuowk'dge 
by allowing to them all proper use thereof; aud

Whereas it is represented that the euumeratiou dT these facilities and the formal 
statement of this policy will encourage the establishment and endowment of institu- 
tions of learning at the seat of Government, and promote the work of education by 
attracting students to avail themselves of the advantages aforesaid under the direc- 
tion of competent instructors: Therefore, 

Ixesolrt'd bij the Senate and House of liepresentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, That the facilities for research and illustration in the following 
and any other Governmental collections now existing or hereafter to V)e established 
in the city of Washington for the promotion of knowledge shall be accessible, under 
such rules and restrictions as tlie otiticers in charge of each collection may presiribe, 
subject to such authority as is now or may hereafter be permitted by law, to the sci- 
entitic investigators and to students of any institution of higher education now incor- 
porated or hereafter to be incorporated under the laws of Congress or of the District

MEETINGS OF ASSOCIATIONS IN WASHINGTON DURING THE YEAR. 

Washington has during recent years been selected as the place for 
holding meetings of a large number of uatioual and international socie- 
ties of all kinds. Each vear has seen an iucrease in this respect, and 
the matter has now become of such importance (not so much, how- 
ever on account of the number as of the character of the societies) 
that \t seems proper to make mentiou of it in a report which is mtendeu 
to contain in a general way a reference to all efforts to develop and 
encourage research, both from a scientific, economic, and a literary 
point of view. There is probably no place in the country better suited 
for such meetings. The seat of government and center ot political 
activity has become accustomed to receiving and entertaining organi- 
zation s. . 1 ,, ^1 • 
, Of late years numerous learned bodies have met in various halls in this 
city The many attractions of the capital, the opportunity ot easy 
access to public record offices and the Congressional Library, the gen- 
eral interest of the Government buildings, combine to make \^ ashing- 
ton a favored city for such purpose. During the last year these con- 
ventions were fewer than usual owing to the concentration of so many 
interests in Chicago during the World's Fair. 

The meeting of the American Ornithologists' Union continued in 
session for three days (from November 15 to 17), and during that time 
a large number of interesting papers were presented.* 

As in previous years, the annual meeting of the National Academy 
of Sciences was held in the lecture hall of the Museum, the session last- 
ing four days, from April 18 to I'l.t 

The course of Saturday Lectures, which was discontinued two or 
three years ago, was resumed in March, 1893, under the auspices of the 
Anthropological Society of Washington. The course consisted ot a 
series of lecUires, somewhat popular in their character, on various sub- 
jects relating to ethnology. The lecturers were all men well known m 
their chosen fields of investigation.J

NECROLOGY. 

Dr. George Vasej-, botanist of the Department of Agriculture and 
honorary curator of the Department of Botany in the U. S. Xational 
Museum, died on March 4, 1893. Dr. Vasey was born on February 28, 
1822, at Scarborough, Yorkshire, England. He gra<luated from Berk- 
shire Medical College, at Pittsfleld, Mass., in 1848; was appointed bot- 
anist of the Department of Agriculture in April, 1872. He also held 
the position of honorary curator of botany in the U. S. National 
Museum. His principal work has been upon grasses, and among other 
papers he published a Descriptive Catalogue of I>rative Forest Trees of 
the United States, 1876; Grasses of the United States: a Synopsis of 
the Tribes with Descriptions of the Genera, 1883; Agricultural Grasses 
of the United States, 1884; Descriptive Catalogue of the tirasses of 
the United States, 1885; Eeport of Investigations of Grasses of the 
Arid Kegions, two parts, 1880-'87; Grasses of the South, 1887; Agri- 
cultural Grasses and Forage Plants of the United States, a revised 
edition, with 114 plates of agricultural grasses, 1889 ; Illustrations of 
2s"orth American Grasses: Vol. i. Grasses of the Southwest, 100 plates 
with descriptions, 1891 ; Vol. ii. Part i of the same, Grasses of the 
Pacific Slope and Alaska, 1892; Monograph of the Grasses of the United 
States and British America (Vol. in, No. 1, Contributions from LT. S- 
National Herbarium), 1892. Dr. Vasey was a member of the Biological 
and Geographical Societies of Washington, and a Fellow of the Ameri- 
can Association for the Advancement of Science. He was appointed 
delegate from the Department of Agriculture and the Smithsonian 
Institution to the Botanical Congress in Genoa in September, 1893. 

At a meeting of the officers of the U. S. National Museum held on 
March G, 1893, the following minute and resolution were adopted: 

In the death of Dr. George Vasey the National Mnseuui has htst a faithful and etti- 
cient oliicer and the science of hotauy an able and indefatigable worker. As bota-

nist of tlie I>e))iirtinent of Agriculture and curator of the National Herbarium for 
twenty-one years, Dr. Vasey's name has become known to all botanists throughout 
the world, and his contributions to science form an iudisjjensable part of the work- 
ing library of every botanist. His familiarity with the liora of all parts of the 
United States, especially with the plants of the great West, was unrivaled, and 
caused his o])inion to be sought and resjtected upon all critical (luestions relating 
thereto. He was the recognized autlu)rity ou this side of the Atlantic in the imjior- 
tant department of grasses, and his publications relating to these have great economic 
as well as scientific value. 

Dr. Yasey Avas uniformly gentle aud kind, manifesting a warm interest in the 
progress of younger botanists and beginners, always ready to give his valual)le time 
and counsels to those who Avent to him for assistance, and many who are now well 
known in the science owe their success in large part to the encouragement and stimu 
lation received from him. In this way the circle of his influence was much wider 
than would be naturally inferred from his quiet life and long confinement to a single 
post of duty. 

To the world at large Dr. Yasey was distinguished for his modest and unobtrusive 
character, his kindly disposition, and his genial manners. A model husband aud 
father, an estimable neighbor, and a good citizen, his loss will l)e deeply felt by all 
who knew him: Therefore, 

Rcnolved, That the sympathies of the officers of the National Museum and Smith- 
sonian Institution be extended to the widow and family of the deceased, aud that a 
copy of this minute and resolution be transmitted to them. 

Capt. John Melmoth Dow, who for many years, as agent of the Pacific 
Mail Steamship Company at Panama, was a warm and valued friend 
of the National Museum, died in jS'ew York City ou I^ovember 4, 1892' 
Capt. Dow was an Honorary Fellow of the Zoological Society of Lou- 
don, a member of the "N^ew York Geographical Society, of the Acad- 
emy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, of the Society of California 
Pioneers, and of the Soci^te Humanitaire et Scieutifiquedu Sud-Ouest 
de la France, 

Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, T^. S. Navy, who for many years has cooperated 
with the National Museum, particularly in matters relating to ethnology, 
and from whom valuable contributions to the collections liave been 
received, died during the j^ear. 

COLUMBIAN HISTORICAL EXPOSITION IN MADRID, 

In accordance with an act of Congress approved Maj' 13, 1892,* the 
President appointed a commission to represent the United States at 
the Commemoration of the Fourth Centenary of the Discovery of 
America, which took jdacein Spain in the latter part of 1803. 

This commission consisted of licar- Admiral S. 1>. Luce, U, S. Navy; 
James C. Welling, ll.d., chairman of the executive committee of the 
Smithsonian Institution, and the Assistant Secretary of the Institu- 
tion. 

The Spanish Government had, in pursuance of the royal decree of 
January J>, 18!>1, provided for a series of international celebrations, most 
prominent auiong which were two historical expositions to be held in 

*Seo Appendix x. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 87 

Madrid simnltaiieonsly and in adjacent buildinji-s — one the Exposicion 
Histoiico-Anierieaiia, the other the Exposicion Ilistorico-Eiiropea.* 
This idea of two expositions, liehl siimiltaneonsly in the same hnildinji^. 
and each illustrative of the other, w as a novel one, and i)roved in the 
end a success. The plan is discussed in the report of his excellency 
Don Antonio Cdnovas del Castillo to the Queen IJe^ent, and the clas- 
sitication of the two expositions indicates fully the intention of the expo- 
sition authorities.* 

The Historic; American Exposition was intended to illustrate the 
civilization of the New Continent in the Pre-Columbian, Columljian, and 
Post-Columbian periods, while in the Historic-Euroi)ean Exposition 
were shown the civilization of Europe, and particularly of the Iberian 
l*eninsula, at the time when the New World was discovered and colo- 
nized. It was intended that, by the aid of these exhibitions, students 
and visitors might be enabled to understand the state of artistic and 
industrial civilization in Europe and America in this important epoch, 
and to realize the influence which the one may have exercised upon the 
other. 

The period which the authorities iu charge of the Historic-European 
Exposition desired especially to illustrate was that during which 
American history was most closely identified with that of Europe. 
This extends from 1402, when the Spanish caravels first reached the 
Antilles, to 1020, when the Mayfioirer, setting forth from a Dutch sea- 
port, brought the English Puritans to New Englaml. 

"The Columbian epoch," extending from the end of the fifteenth 
century through the first third of the seventeenth, includes most of the 
principal initial eftorts for the exploration and colonization of the new 
continent by Europeans. By bringing together, in a retrospective 
exhibition, what remains to illustrate the arts and industries of Europe 
at this time, it was the desire of the Spanish authorities " to teach the 
people of to-day what were the elements of civilization with which, on 
the side of the arts, Europe was then equipped for the task of educa- 
ting a daughter, courageous and untamed, but beautiful and \-igorous, 
who had risen from the bosom of the seas, and who, in the course of a 
very few centuries, was to be transformed from a daughter into a 
sister — a sister j)roud in aspiration and mighty in power." 

The exhibits in this Historic-American Exposition were divided into 
three great series: One to include American prehistoric remains, the 
first indication of the existence of man in caves, neolithic monuments, 
lacustrine dwellings, and the arms and utensils of this primitive age; 
the second to illustrate the characteristics of the Ainerican aborigines 
just prior to the discovery, and the third, the period of discovery, of 
conquest, and of European influence, up to the middle of the seven- 
teenth century. 

It was arranged to have also a special group of objects illustrating

tbe voyages of Columbus and liis companions, as well as jjievious efforts 
for the discovery of a new contiueut. 

The exj»()sitious were held iu the new building' erected for the national 
library and museums in the Paseo de liecoletos, and in the adjacent 
grounds and buildings of the Paniue de Madrid. 

There were other celebrations in connection with the expositions, 
beginning witTh a congress at Huelva, on the 2d of August, in com- 
memoration of the four hundredth anniversary of the departure of the 
vessels of Columbus from the port of Palos, followed by a session of 
the Congress of Orientalists, which took jilace in the Alcazar in Seville, 
continuing from the 1st to the 0th of October; and the Ninth Congress 
of Americanists, in the Convent of La Rabida, at Huelva, from the 
7th to the 11th of October. On the 11th of October was unveiled at 
La Riibida a monument to commemorate the discovery of America. 
There were other festivals and naval demonstrations at Huelva at 
various times from the 3d of August to the 3d of November. 

The management of the commemoration was vested in a ro^al commis- 
sion, the president of which is tlie prime minister of Spain, his excel- 
lency Don Antonio Canovas del Castillo. Commissions were organ- 
ized in all of the Spanish-American republics, by which very extensive 
exhibits were secured, and special commissions were also appointed by 
the governors of the Spanish provinces and the governors-general of 
the Antilles and the Phillippine Islands. 

Our commissioners, by a circular issued June 1, 1802, invited the coop- 
eration of persons having objects of any kiiul suitable for exhibition on 
this occasion, requesting them to be sent to the Smithsonian Institution 
for transmission to Madrid. Objects intended for the World's Colum- 
bian Exposition in Chicago were, by a special arrangement, to be for- 
warded direct from Madrid to Chicago in ample time for installation. 

It was especially urged that authors and publishers of books relating 
to the periods of discovery and conquest, and the colonial history of the 
sev^eral European settlements in America, should exhibit them. 

The executive work was, by agreement between the three commis- 
sioners, divided as folk)Ws: The commissioner-general to reside in 
Madrid through the exhibition, and in addition to his ceremonial func- 
tions to direct the return of the exhibits; Dr. Welling was to prepare 
a general report uixni the exliibition, and the writer to have charge of 
the preparation of the exhibits, their transportation to Madrid, and 
their installation in the exposition building. 

In connection with this work, representatives of the two anthr(»|>o- 
logical departments of the ^Museum were detailed to acconq»any the 
exhibits of the Museum to Madrid, and to assist in the installation and 
maintenance of the display. These were Dr. Thomas Wilson, curator 
of prehistoric anthropology, and Dr. Walter Hough, assistant curator 
of ethnology, who was seut to represent Prof Mason, the curator, the 
latter, on account of the preparations in progress for the Chicago Expo-

sitiou, ill which his departiiieut was so extensively cuueeiued. being 
unable to leave Washington. 

The Department of State and the Biirean of American Ke[)ul)lics 
sent the extensive collection of portraits of Colninbns, and of monu- 
ments and historic localities connected with the discovery of America, 
which had been prepared by Mr. William Eleroy Curtis, Chief of the 
Bureau; and Mr. Curtis, m person, superintended the installation of 
this exhibit while serving as special envoy of the Government to 
invite the attendance of a representative of the royal family and the 
Duke of Veragua, Columbus' lineal descendant and representative, to 
attend the World's Columbian Exposition. 

Mr. Stewart Culiu, curator of the museum of arclueology and paleon- 
tology of the University of Pennsylvania, was detailed by the univer- 
sity to represent the institution u])on that occasion, and to install a 
large collection of archa'ological objects from its musenm. 

Mr. J. Walter Fewkes, director of the Hemenway Expedition, by 
which an extensive disi>lay of ethnological objects from the Southwest 
was exhibited, also accompanied the commissioner to Madrid and 
remained during the entire period, in company with his assistant, Mr. 
J. S. Owen. 

Mr. Stewart Culm was appointed secretary of tlie commission ; Lieut. 
J. C. Colwell, U. S. Navy, was detailed by the Navy Department as 
disbursing officer, and 3Ir. Henry Horan, of the National Museum, 
was sent to attend to the unpacking and the mechanical work of 
mounting the exhibits in Madrid. 

The writer sailed for Southampton August 4, accompanied by Dr. 
Hough and Mr. Culin, and arrived in Madrid August 19, remaining 
until the exhibits had arrived and the work of installation well begun. 
In the meantime, the opening of theexhibition having been deferred until 
October 30 and his share of the work having been practically accom 
plished, except what could be done even more satisfactorily by other 
officers of the Museum already in Madrid, he left Madrid for Washington 
September 17. Dr. Wilson was recalled, by reason of family troubles, 
November 3. Dr. Hough remained until the close of tlie exhibition, 
February 4, and superintended the packing and return (tf the exhibits, 
the last of which reached Washington in April, in time, as had been 
antici])ated, for use m Chicago. 

It should be said that a large part of the exhibits sent from the 
National Museum to Madrid were selected from those already mounted 
for display at the World's Fair, and that cases were sent from Wash- 
ington for the accommodation of all tlie exhibits sent from the United 
States, which occupied a Moor space of 10,000 square feet. It was 
found, however, tliat the Spanish Cxovernment had provided a certain 
number of cases admirably suited for exhibition — an entirely unprece- 
dented act of forethought and liberality in exhibition management — 
and it was consequently found unnecessary to unpack all the cases 
which had been provided. 



90 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Dr. Welling, who had iiioceeded as far as Loudou, was called home 
by business connected with his university and was unable to return. 
He therefore resigned, and Prof. D. G. Brinton, of the University of 
Pennsylvania, was api)ointed to serve in his stead. Dr. Brinton, 
accompanied by his assistant, IVIr. H. C. Mercer, arrived in Madrid 
December 1 and spent several weeks in studying the collections in 
both expositions and writing his report. 

Mrs. Zelia Xuttall, well known for her remarkable studies in Mexican 
archaeology, was present for a considerable time at the exhibition, and 
made an exhibit in the section of the United States. 

The exhibit of the United States was received with great favor, and 
the friendly action of our Government in sending so extensive and 
impressive an exhibit was greatly appreciated. Among the results to 
which it led were the acceptance of the invitations of the Government 
to the royal family and to the Duke of Veragua, the liberal response 
of the Spanish Government to the invitation to participate as an exhib- 
itor in the World's Fair, and, incidentally, the increased interest on the 
part of the Latin-American Kepublics, manj^ ot which confessedly did 
far more at Chicago, inspired by the example ot the Government of 
Spain, than they would otherwise have done; and, incidentally, may it 
be also noted, the speedy completion ot an important commercial treaty 
between the United States and Spam, which had long been pending, 
and which, until the action of Congress m connection with the Madrid 
Exj^osition was known, seemed scarcely likely to be agreed to by 
Spain. 

The exposition was undoubtedly a most successful one, and in many 
respects one of the most noteworthy international expositions ever 
held, although from its very nature it appealed more to the scholar 
than to the general public, and consequently, so far as popular attend- 
ance and financial outcome were concerned, was not noteworthy. The 
various governments which participated were represented by men of 
character and high scholarship, and the catalogues published by Spain 
and by the several governments were important contributions to his- 
tory and archeology, and several valuable reports have already been 
printed by governments and specialists. Others are in preparation, and 
the effects of the comparative display made will appear in historical 
and archieological literature for a long time to come. A most note- 
worthy indirect result was the publication of a considerable number of 
imi)()rtiint historical monographs and collections of documents hitherto 
uiii)ublished, which appeared in Madrid during the period of the expo- 
sition. 

The Ninth Congress of Americanists, held at ITuelva, was one of the 
most successful which has been held, and American scholars partici- 
pated prominently in the discussions. The report of this congress, when 
published will contain much that is of imi)ortance to archa'ology. 

The customary system of medals and diplomas pievailed at the expo- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 91 

sition. A grand (lii)l()iua of honor was given to the (lovernnient of the 
Uuited States, Twelve gohl ineihtls with <liph)nias. eighteen silvei' 
medals with diplomas, thirteen bronze medals with diplomas, were 
awarded, while thirty-six exhibitors received liouorable mention. A 
list of the medals and diplomas is given in the Appendix,* which cou- 
taius also a list of exhibitors. 

It should be said in this connection that with the exception of the 
exhibits sent by the Bureau of American Eepublies, the Univeisity of 
Pennsylvania, and the Ilemenway expedition these mentioned in this 
list were all sent at the request of the Smithsonian Institution, and 
were mounted, labeled, and exhibited as a part of its display. Indeed, 
as was recognized by the Government, but for the enthusiastic cooper- 
ation afforded by the Smithsonian Institution it would have been impos- 
sible in the short time between the passage of the appropriation and 
the opening of the exposition, to have prepared and forwarded an 
exhibit which would have been at all creditable to the Uuited States. 

Incidentally may be mentioned the award by the Queen Regent of 
the grand cross of naval merit to Admiral Luce, and that of com- 
mander in the Koyal Order of Ysabel la Catolica to Mv. W. E. Curtis, 
Dr. Thomas Wilson, and the writer 5 and that of knight in the same 
order to Messrs. Hough, Fewkes, and Culin, while the latter was also 
honored by election to membership in the Royal Academy of History. 

At the close of the exposition Admiral Luce, who remains in Europe, 
dissolved his official connection with the commission, and the closing 
uji of the business of the commission is left in the hands of the writer 
as Acting Commissioner-General, with the assistance of Dr. Hough as 
executive officer, while the other commissioner. Dr. Brinton, is engaged 
upon the preparation of the general report, which will be jmblished 
during the coming year, supplemented by a catalogue of the objects dis- 
played by the Museum, by Messrs. Wilson and Hough, and papers by 
Mrs. Zelia Nuttall, upon "Ancient Mexican Feather Work;" by Dr. 
Hough, on "Ancient American Pottery as shown at the Exposition," 
and Mr. H. C. Mercer, on the " Chipped Stone Implements shown at the 
Exposition." 

In view of the great interest in this exposition, and of the fact that 
the publication of the official report may be somewhat delayed, I include 
here a discussion of the exijosition in its general aspects front the pen 
of Dr. Walter Hough.t 

The display which was brought together iu Madrid was the greatest eollectiou of 
Ameiicaua ever under oue roof, and brought into contrast, side by side the art of the 
Ohl Worhl at the time of the discovery aud that of the Xew ^^"orld, roiiglily on 
either side of the discovery. 

'Appendix, No. x. 

t A description of the Exposition in some of its features was printed Ity Dr. Thomas 
Wilson in the "American Naturalist" for September and October. 1S9.S. 



92 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Joiued with its admirable historical aud scientific motive, there was great taste 
displayed in the presentation of the valuable material. No doubt a similar oppor- 
tunity to compare the ethnological and archicological jirodncts from so many 
American sources will be far in the future. 

The American exhibits dealt mainly with the archa^ologic aspect, excejit that of 
the United States, which was a comprehensive collection, setting forth in I'l-'^i'i 
terms the interdependence of archa-ology and ethnology. The twenty-four States 
and countries in large proportion displayed ethnological specimens only for deco- 
ration or m an unsystematic way. There were about 250,000 pieces on view, of 
which the United States, Mexico, and Spain showed the larger number. The floor- 
space measured 5,000 square meters ; of this space the United States and Mexico 
occupied about one-third. 

The United States section occupied six rooms, embracing a long list of exhibitors, 
both institutions and private persons. The National Museum furnished a portion 
of the largo ethnological and archa'ological collections destined for Chicago, selected 
by Profs. Mason and Wilson. It furnished also specimens of the animals encountered 
by the early explorers, maps, pictures, photographs, transparencies, illustrations from 
books on American ethnology, publications of the Smithsonian Institution, enlarge- 
ments, ma]is, paper money, medals, etc. There was also a library of historical 
works, and a collection of writings on American archaeology and ethnology pre- 
sented by the authors. 

The Bureau of Ethnology contributed models of Indian pueblos, the great lin- 
guistic maps, pottery, photograj)hs, pictures, and four cases containing a tine series 
from seven pre-Columbian mines and (jiiarriesexphn-ed by Mr. W. H. Holmes. These 
especially attracted a great deal of attention, as did the splendid series of relief maps 
exhibited by Mr. E. E. Howell. 

Philadelphia was well represented in the exhibition. The University of Pennsyl- 
vania disjilayed publications and monographic archeological collections from Penn- 
sylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, and Florida. The enteri)rise of the Numismatic and 
Antiquarian Society and the Academy of Natural Sciences, of Philadelphia, is very 
commendable. The former showed a large collection of medals, paper money, and 
publications. The Academy of Natural Sciences exhibited 44 crania from the Mor- 
ton collection, representing 35 tribes aud 14 American stocks. The Philadelphia 
collections were in the etiicient charge of Mr. Stewart Culin. 

The Bureau of Latin American Republics showed a magniticent gallery of Icoiio- 
graphia Columbiana, supi)lemented by Mr. Curtis's own cidlection. These pictures 
ibrmed a well-arranged and attractive feature of the exhibition. 

One large hall was devoted to the Tusayan pueblos and was tilled with the collec- 
tions made by Dr. Fewkes, under the munificent patronage of Mrs. Hemenway, and 
presented especially the religion and symbolism of the Hopi. Sand pictures and 
altars were shown for the first time. The ancient pottery was exceptionally tine, 
and there was a large series of religious paraphernalia. Photographs, water-color 
drawings, maps, and publications completed an exhibit for which Dr. Fewkes is to 
be highly congratulated. 

Mexico brought a magnificent collection of antiquities, chiefly pottery and stone 
tilling over 50 cases. There were casts of famous antiquities, copies of the codices, 
pictures, models, and photographs of the ancient ruins, and notably a grand model 
of the Temple Mayor of Ceiiii)oala (Vera Cruz), measuring 12 by 18 feet in area. A 
fine central case held the gems of the collection, such as obsidian masks, vases, lab- 
rets, mirrors, tiles, a carved notched femur (which is probably ])art of a musical 
instrument like those used in New Mexico and Arizona), copper rings, jade objects, 
etc. The series of obsidian rings of hour-glass shape, with wide. Hat rims, worked 
down to a thickness of one-sixteenth of an inch and highly polished, are very 
remarkable specimens of lapidary work. Tliey wonbl tax Mr. McGuire's skill and 
ingenuity in stone-working. Many sucli inoldcnis coutVout one at every step iu

tliis vast and practically miworked material. One room with 14 cases is devoted to 
the Zapotecs. lu the whole collection the relics of 23 ancient civilizations were 
shown. Mr. Troncoso, director of the National Museum of Mexico, is a host in him- 
self and has an efficient statt" of collaborators. 

There were a number of small collections from Cuba, San Domingo, the latter con- 
sisting of human remains, weapons, idols, pottery, etc., of the aborigines, and histor- 
ical relics of the age of the discovery, and from Bolivia, Argentine Republic, Brazil, 
Chile, Honduras, Salvador, and Paraguay. 

The bulk of the numbers from Guatemala were of pottery. There were many 
finely carved stone images, an oval dish of polished quartz of bluish tint, and an 
exquisitely carved l)ead of jade. There was also a curious globular ])ottery whistle 
or lluto, somewhat like an ocarina, with four holes, giving five tones, running from (" 
to F sharji, and a jiottery trumpet, with four pipes blown from one mouthpiece. I 
do not know who is to be held responsible for the exhibition of an Egyptian scarab 
and a bronze shtihti as American relics. This collection contains three rare and 
beautiful vases ornamented with Quiche Maya hieroglyphics. Dr. Briuton believes 
that these are the only Quiche Maya inscriptions yet discovered. 

Nicaragua displayed a small collection of pottery in red outlined with black, stone 
imi)lements, mde and polished, and a few pieces of jade and gold work. 

Costa Rica occupied two halls with a tine collection, mostly of pottery and stone 
carvings, contained in 40 cases. The walls were covered with paintings of the exca- 
vations, maps, and photographs. This collection was shown at Chicago. The inter- 
esting gold objects exhibited Ijy Mr. Alfaro in Washington in 1891 were displayed iu 
one case, and two other cases held jade carvings. The pottery resembles that of 
Nicaragua, aud consists of burial jars, cups, ^ases, spoons, cooking pots, etc. The 
stone carvings are particularly good ; they are priuciijally of friable, volcanic rock. 
The ornamented metates, skillfully worked stools with their seats upheld by human 
figures ; the magnificent sacrificial stone, 6 feet long aud 25 inches wide, finely 
sculptured at the head aud along the margins and edges, are especially noteworthy, 
while the series of stone masks, standing and sitting figures, animal and human 
heads, give an enlarged idea of the progress of the sculptor's art iu ancient Costa 
Rica. 

Seventy-two pounds of wrought-gold objects, 4.52 in numl)er, and 383 objects of 
copper, invested Colombia's room with a peculiar interest. These consisted of 
bowls, canteens with full-lengtli human figures, necklaces, animal aud human 
forms, etc. There also was much jiottery of a superior order from the Quimbayas, 
Chibchis, Chiri<iuis, the Department of Tolma aud Antigua; a fine series of ])hoto- 
graphs was also displayed. There was a small ethnological collection from the 
Cunas and Guahibos. This collection was well installed and catalogued liy Mr. 
Ernest Restrepo, aud was a great credit to the Republic of Colombia. 

Of the 11 cases from Ecuador 10 were of the lustrous, dark, and usually indurated 
potter}-, which is very interesting from its curious forms, among which occur long, 
narrow, amphora-like jars with lugs, tazzas sitting on a high, jjerforated foot, 
exactly counterfeiting Korean mortuary pottery, and square jars of Chinese form, 
giving this collection a strange phase. There was one case of copper axes, bored 
stone axes, star club heads, labrets, and charms of worked stone. It is rather 
remarkable if articles which are evidently separators for ])ottery are found in 
ancient excavations in Ecuador. 

Peru exhibited a large number of pottery bottles of red and black ware in human 
and animal forms from the huacas of the Ynncas. Four of tiiese are in the form of 
human heads, in which the no.se ]srepreseute<l as having l)een eaten away, evidently 
by some disease which a Si)anish physician diagnoses as lupus. Dr. Brinton 
ex])resses the opinion that the disease characterized is syphilis. The Vunca jiot- 
tery also shows trace of S]>anish iutluenci'. There were some good si)ecimeus of 
gold working, textiles ami wood carving. 



94 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, l«y3. 

Uruguay sent a small but well-displayed coUectiou of stoue iuipleiueuts, com- 
prisiug bolas, rlub heads, airowlieads, scrapers, hamuiei- stoues, mortars, stoue and 
pottery vessels, bono awls, pitted stoues, and many polishers aud grinders. There 
were a number of probable club heads, square to oblong iu shape, roughly brokea 
from schistose rock, which slightly resemble the obsidian heads irom Easter Islaud 
in the Thomson collection at the National Museum. The greater part of these 
remarkably rude objects have four cusps, aud are constricted midway apparently 
for purposes of hafting. 8ome of the pebbles with one smootli central })it are 
apparently head pieces of a drill. A good series of photographs of stone imple- 
ments accompany this collection. These specimens are interesting, since they are 
from a new field. 

Spain showed the treasures of the Archeological Museum aud the Museum of Nat- 
ural Sciences, which are especially rich in Peruvian and Mexican archeojogy. From 
the former country there were numerous mummies, hafted stone implements, and 
other objects taken from graves, cult apparatus, stoue aud metal work, splendid 
textiles and feather work, musical instruments, and au imuieuse series of pottery, in 
which ai-e many groups of pieces evidently froiu the same luold. The ex(iuisite 
Peruvian coat from the Ri yal Museum was a marvel, which for fineness of faln-ic, 
color, ornamentation, aud finish it is difticult to believe has ever been surpassed. 
There were also many other examples of fine Peruvian textiles. 

The famous Troano and Cortesian codices were disjdayed, and also a great deal 
of stone and metal work, pottery, etc., from Mexico. One case of pottery and some 
stone idols, labeled " frauds," were very suggestive. There were also small groups 
of specimens from South and Central America, aud ethnologica from various states. 
The Alaskan and other Indian specimens were in few cases localized, the objects 
having been collected before such information was deemed necessary. The museums 
labor under this difficulty, and there is a good field for comparative work. The 
Northwest coast masks, hats, adzes, carvings, armor, etc., were collected more than 
one hniulred years ago by the Malespina expedition and range from British Colum- 
bia to Sitka. A collection of arrowheads, sent by Dr. W. J. Hoffman, occupied a 
prominent place. The museum of Natural Sciences had on exhiliition a large collec- 
lection of miuerals and botauical specimens brought back from America by Spanish 
explorers. The museums have been benefited by the infusion of new blood; Mr. 
Narciso Seutenach and .lose Ramon Melida are young men, who promise to do excel- 
lent work. 

The Portuguese exhibit contained a few American specimens used for decor.ition, 
with other objects from difterent quarters of the globe, forming what was appar- 
ently a fisheries exhibit. There were splendid paintings and metal work of the 
fourteenth aud fifteeuth centuries, which should have been installed in the European 
exposition upstairs. Two rare Sandwich Island feather cloaks aud souie helmets 
were shown. The locality of few specimens was known. 

Austria ctuitributed au excellent exhibit of mound pottery aud other objects from 
the United States. This collection was under the care of Dr. Wilbelm Hein. of 
Vienna, who is an enthusiastic worker in the field of ethnology. 

Germany sent casts of the sculptures of Santa Lucia Cozuniahualpa, iu (iuate- 
mala, consisting of large bas-reliefs, monkeys' heads, human figures, and a largo 
brazier in the Ethnographical Museum of. Berlin. Two anticjue Mexican feather 
shields from Stuttgart, and a great number of illustrations aud photographs were 
displayed. The gold objects from Colombia iu this collection were in an elegant 
burglar and fire-proof case, so fitted that the tablets upon which the specimens 
were mounted could be lowered into a steel vault and secured for the night. Dr. 
Edward Seler, of the Royal Ethnographical Museum of Berlin, was iu charge, aud 
most of the specimens were collected by him. 

Sweden showed the fine collection of eai'ly maps, globes, and mauuscripts of Baron 
Xordeuskijnld. the collections from the Chukcliis aud the Eskimo of Port Clarence,

procured on tlu> voyage of the Ve(i<(, the pliotograplis, luodols, and specimens result- 
ing tVoni tlie explorations of (iustav Nordenskijold in (Jolorailo two yciirs ago, 
and the objects brought from Nicaragua and Costa Rica by Dr. Carlos Bovallius. 
These gentlemen were in charge and arranged a very creditable display. 

Norway exhibited a full-sized model of a viking boat. The original was taken 
from a tumulus on the east coast of Norway in 1880. 

The display of Denmark was composed of two parts, viz, one illustrating the life 
of the Eskimo of Greenland, the other the grade of civilization of Iceland in the 
middle ages. The collection was well presented, and showed in a small way the 
Eskimo man and wonum, their houses and utensils, methods of transportation, and 
some of their arts. The wood carvings, textiles, and model of the house of the Ice- 
landers were very interesting. 

The documents under the efficient charge of Dr. Zaragoza were of the highest 
interest, and included priceless letters of Columbus and other discoverers and con- 
querors, with manuscripts of the early explorers and priests. 

The exposition was visited by many of the Americanists after the meeting at 
Hnelva, among whom may be mentioned Dr. Hamy, Baron de Baye, M. Adam, 
Charles Read, and others. The orator, Castelar, was a close student of the collec- 
tions, and the intelligent interest displayed by many scientific men at the Spanish 
capital was very gratifying. 

On the whole, the exhibition was u<jt well attended, as its patronage was largely 
drawn from Madrid and the immediate vicinity, there being also little advertising 
and no excursion rates offered by the railroads. This, however, does not detract 
from the commendation which should be given to the Spanish Government for the 
enlightened idea and the consummate ability with which this idea was carrieil out 
by the delegate general, Senor Don .Juan Navarro Reverter, Rev. Padre Fita, and 
their colleagues. 

When it comes to describe the sister exhibition, setting forth the state of European 
culture at the era of the discovery, there is a great difficulty in merely indicating 
the priceless rarities disiilayed. No one imagined that after the many spcdiations 
which the Iberian Peniusula has suffered, so inany art works survivefl. 

When inquiry was made for the relics demonstrating the splendor of Old Spain, 
the church alone could respond with the evidences of her traditional fostering and 
conservation of art. 

Thus it hajipens that the exhibit largely comprised ecclesiastical objects from the 
more important churches of Spain. Without doubt not above one-fifth of the j)re- 
cious relics existing among the churches and religious institutions were repre- 
sented iu Madrid, due to the poor communications in Spain and no general anti- 
quarian interest among the people. 

There is a saying that "tapestries are like weeds iu Spain." Mr. Charles H. liead, 
of the British Museum, from whose admirable <lescriptiou of the exposition I shall 
more thau once ([uote, says: ~ 

"The most striking feature of this part of the exhibition, and that which dis- 
tinguishes it from any other, is the extraordinary display of Flemish andSjtanish 
tapestries and carpets and Persian and Arab textiles with whicli the walls of 
every room on the upper floor are lined. Most of the Flemish tapestries from the 
Escorial aud the other royal palaces are already well known, both from their being 
generally shown to visitors and from the excellent photographs published by M. 
Laurent, of Madrid. But in addition to these, many from private collections and 
from religious establishments, some of them fully as important as those of the royal 
collections, have come to light and are now seen for the first time. The most strik- 
ing case of this kind is probably that of the Cathedral of Zamora. The authorities

Madrid. London, 1893. 



96 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

at Zamura were asked to contribute to the exhibitiou >soiiie of their works of art, 
and sent among other things several beautiful tapestries of the fifteenth century, 
of great size, of tine design, and in a good state of preservation. With tliis cou- 
sigumeut came a statement that if more tapestries were required for the decoration 
of the walls, the chapter possessed tifty others. It seems impossible that so won- 
derful a series of precious ta]>estries could have lain entirely unknown for centuries, 
and doubtless unseen except l)y such as attended the services at the cathedral on 
certain special festivals. .Such a case, and it seems to be by no means an isolated 
one, illustrates in a forcible manner the unknown riches of the religiotis establish- 
ments of Spain, unknown even to the comparatively few persons in the country 
who are specially interested in such matters." 

The display of church vestments was very large, but the majority were overloaded 
with embroidery in gold and silver and belong to the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries. The older vestments are invariably of higher quality. One of these is 
described ty Mr. Read: 

"First of these comes a coiteofopus anglicanumof the eiulof the thirteenth century, 
belonging to the Cathedral of Toledo, and stated to have been the property of Cardi- 
nal Gil de Albornoz (1367). It is of the usual semicircular shape, embroidered in 
many colors with sacred subjects and figures of saints under canopies. Along the 
straight side are six tigures of bishops, a king and (|ueen, and the rest of the surface is 
entirely covered with a radiating design, the central subjects being the Coronation aud 
Assumption of the Virgin, the Nativitj", the Annunciation, and the Virgin and Child, 
and on either side of the outer edge tigures of the following saints : John the Evan- 
gelist, Edward the Confessor, Laurence, Mary Magdalen, Ethelbert, Dunstan, Mar- 
garet, Catherine, Thomas of Canterbury, Olave, Stephen, Helen, Dionysius, Edmund 
the King, John the Baptist, and a bishop without name. The inner circle is com- 
posed of eight figures of apostles: Saints Paul, Simon, Philip, James, Andrew. 
Thomas, Bartholomew, and Peter. The names are inscribed upon scrolls in Lom- 
bardic capitals. In the spandrels are placed birds, executed in brilliant colors. It 
will be seen that cci'taiu of the saints are especially English, and thus help to con- 
firm the cardinal's description of his own cope, as well as the internal evidence of the 
design and method of work, both of which point to the conclusion that the cope is 
of Engli.sh work. In addition to this, however, I am able to add by the kind offices 
of Senor Canovas del Castillo, through Pou G. J. de Osma, the following extract 
from the will of the original owuvjr: 'Item lego eidem ecclesia^ Conchensi caput 
argenteum cum reliquiis beati Blasii ponderis quadraginti octo marchorum. Item 
pluviale meum pretiosum de opere anglicano. A'olo tamen quod dicti decanus et 
capitulum nuuquam pos.sint ilia alienare, vendere, seuimpignorare, etc.'"* 

The Cathedral of Moudouedo sent the sandals of Don Pelayo II, of Cedeira (1199- 
1218). The shoes or sandals reach to the ankles, made of stuft' originally purple, 
.with bands of gold thread across the instep and down the middle of the foot to the 
toe. The soles are nearly 2 inches thick, somewhat like a Chinese shoe, aud the 
edges are ornamented with stiff interlacing floral scrolls of the style usually found 
in works of art at this period. 

In refcreu(-e to the large display of church plate, Mr. Kead says: 

'•'There can be no doubt that so rich a collection of material for the study of 
Si>auish gold anil silversmiths' work has never beeu before l)rought together. A great 
))roiK)rtion of the objects exhibited is naturally of the hue sixteenth and early sev- 
enteenth centuries, but many tine pieces of earlier and more interesting periods are 
to 1)6 found. The silver chalice and paten of late thirteenth or early fouitccnth 
century from Toledo Cathedral are remarkable anu)ng these, both for the beauty of 
the work and for the unusually large size of both objects. The chalice is more than 
a foot in diameter at the base and 17 inches in height, while the paten is 16 inches

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 97 

in diameter. The latter is sunk in tlio center, the depression liavin^^ twelve foli- 
atious around the edge, and witliin it is engrav<Ml the erucitixion with the Virgin and 
St. John, the whole inclosed within astitt floral Ixtrder. The chalice has a plain 
bowl, widening rapidly upward (and in this it differs conspicuously from Spanish 
chalices of later date), the knob is ornamented with the evangelistic symbols in 
repousse, and the stem is ((uite plain except for two bands of (luarterfoil tracery. 
The base is in design much like that of the Dolgelly chalice, viz, it has three con- 
centric bands of dat lobes or scallops in slight relief, upon which are engraved 
figures of angels, and the edge is molded in twelve foliations supported upon a 
slight tracery of quarterfoils, and in each foliation is a ligure of an apostle. This 
chalice is as early in date as any in the exhibition, and its large size renders it the 
nu)st reuiarkaltle. It is stated in the catalogue that it was probably u.sed on Holy 
Thursday, when two hosts are consecrated, one being reserved till Good Friday, 
when it is consumed by the priest. This second host is usually kept in a chalice of 
large size and ancient work. 

"Another chalice and paten of much the same date is sent from the Cathedral of 
Santiago, and possesses additional interest from the decoration of the kuoj) being in 
niello. The paten is of similar design to that from Toledo, but the central subject 
represents Our Lord seated withiu an engraved qnaterfoil. the engraved design 
being all withiu a depression of eight foliations. The bowl of the chalice is again 
of the shallow form, and the stem is slender and somewhat longer than is found in 
English and other northern chalices. The knop has circular medallions with 
nielloed scrolls, but without any sacred emblems. The base is plain, with the excep- 
tion of a narrow engraved border of stilF scroll work, and on one side is engraved 
a group of the Virgin and Child seated, with a female figure kneeling in adoration 
at the side. The presence of this group is the only instance in the exhibition of 
the practice so conmion in English chalices, of jdacing a cross or other sacred sym- 
bol upon the side of the chalice to be held next the priest during the celebration of 
mass. The catalogue attributes this chalice and paten to the twelfth century, but 
it should, I think, be placed somewhat later, i. e., in the early thirteenth century. 

"Of later chalices there are a great number, dating from the early sixteenth cen- 
tury to the middle of the seventeenth, a period which would include by far the 
greatest proportion of all the church plate exhibited. It will be sufficient to notice 
three of the sixteenth century as being fine examples of their kind, and at the same 
time characteristic of the style peculiar to the period. 

"The first, from the Cathedral of Seville (No. 49), is remarkable in having a cover 
which fits closely into the bowl and h:s a central socket, into which the foot of some 
object has been placed, perhaps a short cross. The bowl is deep and has round the 
base outside a row of pear shaped settings containing knot-work medallions of cloi- 
sonne enamel, the patterns being an inheritance from the Moorish artists, and their 
prototypes are seen in perfection upon the sword of Boabdil. belonging to the 
Marques de Viane. The stem, knop, and foot are Gothic in design, the* tracery 
being fairly pure in style; but the foot is ornamented with embossed designs of tlie 
rich, floriated style, common in Spanish and Portugese objects of the Renaissance. 
This mixture of Gothic and Renaissance motives is, in fact, the remarkable charac- 
teristic of the church plate of the peninsula in the sixteenth century, and the i'xhi- 
bition furnishes numberless examples of it. This chalice has u].on the foot the .arms 
of an archbishop in enamel. 

"The second chalice, of about the .same date, from the Cathedral of Valencia (No. 
50) is of a somewhat difierent design, and in many details recalls the drawings of 
cups by Holbein, thongli here again the border at the foot is of Gothic tracery. But 
for an unfortunate heavinessof the base this vcs.sel would be of very gracefuldesign. 
It is singularly .secular in its details, which are chiefly composed of festoous'^of 
fiowers, and fruit, and cherubs, and upon the knop tiny cupids riding dolphins. The 
only indications of its sacred character, apart from its shape, are six circular medal-

lions let into tliefoot, which art- engraved wi>th the Crucilixiou and other designs of 
the same character. These have once been enameled, but the enamel has now 
entirely disappeared, owing to the vessel having been ])assed through the tire to 
freshen the metal, a jiractice which seems to have been common in Spain, as a large 
proportion of the enameled details on church ornaments of all kinds are now bare 
metal, owing to this somewhat barbarous practice. The third chalice, from the 
church of Osuna, has, perhaps, a more peculiar feature than either of the others, in 
having the bowl and kuoj> surrounded with small bells, ten on the former and six on 
the latter. It is usually rich in detail, Avith the customary mixture of Gothic ele- 
ments with florid Renaissance foliage. The knop is composed of rich canopy work 
beneath, or rather iu.side, which are seated figures of apostles, and upon the foot are 
highly-embossed scenes from the Passion. The inscription on the paten is a curious 
instance of the misspelling of Latin, pax doinini sit siiipir bohiscnn. 

" Among the paxes are several deserving of mention. The Cathedral of Valencia 
sends the most beautiful of these. It is of fine gold, elaborately chased and enam- 
eled in brilliant colors. The front is in the form of a chair, in which is seated the 
infant Saviour, the whole of the figure being enameled ; the back of the chair is cov- 
ered with elaborate scroll work of beautiful design and filled with enamel ; the lower 
part of the chair beneath the seat is hollow, and has two small doors which open 
and display a group modele<l in the round, and representing the Nativity. The ped- 
iment above the baek of the chair is edged with two elegant scrolls in openwork, 
and at the base of the pediment on each side is a iigure of a warrior standing. The 
back is miuutely engraved and enameled with sacred subjects, the Adoration of the 
Magi, Christ among the Doctors, etc. This specimen is by far the most remarkal)le 
of all the ])axes exhibited, and its attribution to the hand of Cellini is much more 
reasonable than is generally the case Avith works assigned to the artist. A certain 
delicacy and refinement in the designs points rather to Italy than to Spain as the 
country of its origin, though whether it is really by Cellini is a far more difficult 
point to decide. This appears in the will (A. D. 1.566) of Don Martin de Ayala, arch- 
bishop of Valencia, who bequeathed it to the cathedral. 

" A pax of perhaps greater interest, and of nearly equal beauty, is that from the 
Cathedral of Ciudad Real. The interesting feature about this specimen is that it 
has for its central subject a carving in black stone of Uyzantine period, represent- 
ing the Descent into Hell, with the legend. above, H. Anactacic, i. e. , Resurrection, 
and behind the figure of Our Lord stand the emperor and empress, crowned and 
with halos round their heads. The frame is in the best style of the Spanish Renais- 
sance, of silver gilt and enameled, and it bears the date 1565. On either side are 
square projecting stages supported on well-designed .caryatid figures, and contain- 
ing four figures of saints, and at the top is a frieze in relief representing a combat 
between horsemen and men on foot; the pediment represents the Assumption of the 
Virgin, with figures of Virtues at the sides, and the apex is surmounted l>y an 
enameled figure of Our Lsrd holding the orb. The back, though by no means so 
richly decorated as the front, is of great beauty. The handle is formed of a female 
caryatid figure with wings, surmounted by Cross of Santiago, and toward the bot- 
tom the terminal base of the figure divides into two serpent scrolls, which curve 
toward the edges of the pax. For beauty of line this charming figure compares 
favorably with any work of the period, and it would be difficult to speak in terms 
"too high of the masterly character of the design. 

"Another pax jtosses-sing unusual features is that from the Cathedral of Parazonn. 
The central portion, if not the whole i)ax, is certainly of north Italian work. It is 
•of silver gilt, and has in relief the subject of the Flagellation, a group of well-mod- 
«led figures of late fifteenth century style. The peculiarity of the work i.s that the 
flat background is ))ainted in enamel with a mountainous iandsca])e. in the style 
common in north Italy at this period, and of which there are several good examples 
in the British Museum collection. The inscription at the bottom of the central sub- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 99 

ject, ' Bort/ia Car. Mon. liff/al,' would seem to indicate tbat it was tlu' jtroperty of 
Cardinal Borgia, archbishop of Monreale, iu Sicily, who diedm 1503. The frame is 
of uucommou design, and may be of the same work as the center, but it is possible 
that it was added in Spain. Two pilasters which form the sides are somewhat poor 
ill execution, and the cresting round the curved top of the pax is curiously classical 
in fei'liug, and consists of groups of two winged lion monsters, loo])ed together at 
the neck and tails, the junctions of the latter being surujounted by palmettes. There 
is a certain clumsiness about the design which is scarcely Italian. 

"The only other pax worthy of special note is that from the Cathedral of Madrid- 
Alcala, an excellent example of Spanish Gothic metal work of the late lifteentb or 
early sixteenth century, without any trace of later style. The subject is the 
Descent from the Cross, modeled iu high relief and enameled; this is surmounted by 
an elai)orate canopy tilled with rich tracery, and on each side are pinnacles with 
buttressed bases, surrounded with figures of saints. The back is good in design, the 
handle being a plain semicircle pierced to represent a dragou, while the edges are 
bordered with bold tracery iu relief. The work of the whole is excellent, and little 
is wanting to make it a beautiful object, but a certain squatuess and want of ele- 
gance of form in the design suffice to make it lall short of true beauty. 

"One of the best specimens of Spanish Gothic, and a remarkable object for its great 
size, is the monstrance from the Cathedral of Jativa, which, without the modern 
silver base upon which it is now placed, stands 5 feet high. The occasion of its 
construction Avas iu itself notable. Pope Alexander VI was a native of Jativa, and 
had this gigantic monstrance made for the Cathedral from the first c(msigument of 
silver received from America. The shai)e is very graceful and consists of a stem 
rising from a mauy-sided base and supporting a shaped oblong ])latforiii, the edges 
of which are bordered by a light arcade. Upon this platform rest four pillars which 
sustain the roof, and from this rise three slender towers pierced with tracery, with 
rich canopy work at their bases. The actual monstrance, or receptacle for the Host, 
is a circular disk of a size proportionate to the lest, with an elaborate openwork 
border of what in England would be called late Tudor style, and it is held up by 
two angels kneeling ou opposite sides. The effect of this beautiful object is much 
destroyed by the whole having been regilt, and by the enamels in the foot having 
been renewed; but in spite of this drawback it remains one of the most beautiful, 
and it is the most conspicuous, objects of ecclesiastical art in the exhibition. 

"The processional crosses, of which a very large number are shown, form a 
very interesting and instructive series, possessing many features difi'eriug from 
similar objects in other countries. The Marques de Cubas exhibits a good col- 
lection, which is supposed to represent all the types from the eleventh century to 
the seventeenth. Whether the series begins so early is perhaps doul)tful. but some 
of the examples may well be of the twelfth, or more probably, thirteenth century. 
These earlier crosses are flat plates of cojiper, gilt, and decorated with champleve 
enamels iu the style of Limoges, but neither so well drawn nor so perfect iu execu- 
tion as the French exampljes, tliough it is by no means improbable that the Spanish 
enamel of this kind is an imitation of that of Limoges. The most noticeable pecul- 
iarity in design in the Spanish crosses of this period is the presence of four oval 
plates upon the four limbs of the cross, projecting beyond the edges of the limbs, 
and in each plate is a subject iu enamel, but those upon the horizontal arms seem 
always to be the Penitent aud Impenitent Thieves. Tlie form of the cross remains 
l)ractically the same up to the sixteentli century, aud the four oval plates are fre- 
quently found at that date, though these two are then no longer reserved for the 
two thieves, but are sometimes devoted to figures of saints, the Evangelists, etc. 

"A very large cross from the Diocese of Vich merits special notice. It is of silver, 
nearly .5 feet in total height, the surface <iuite plain, except for a circular disk upon 
each arm, ill the center ofwiiich is a sixfoil with a subject in translucent enamel. 
This cross differs so much from all the otliers that it might be thought to be of for- 



100 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1S93. 

eign make, but the probability is that it was made in Catalonia, and perhaps near 
Vich itself, where the influence of French designs would be more feltthan in the more 
southern parts of Spain. It is attributed, and, I think, rightly, to the fifteenth cen- 
tury. 

The S))anish crosses of the sixteenth and late fifteenth centuries have a character 
fully as peculiar and national as those of earlier date. Those of the sixteenth cen- 
tury are characterized»by a richness of detail that makes them look at a little distance 
like filigree work, but a closer examination shows that this rich ett'ect is produced 
by a multiplicity of canopies, edgings, and pendants, symmetrically designed in a 
semi-Gothic s+yle. The richest, and at the same time the best, in general design, of 
this kind is that from the Cathedral of Osuna (Seville), though many others, from 
Salamanca, Astorga, and-other cathedrals are very good. Nearly all, however, have 
surtered, and their enameled details are destroyed by having been passed through 
the fire to render them bright." 

Another class of objects are the caskets used as reliquaries. Some of them are of 
pure Moorish work, with Saracenic designs and inscriptions. Mr. Read describes 
the earliest and most important of these, a large casket of carved ivory with mounts 
of champleve enamel, from the Provincial council ol Valencia. 

•'The whole surface is carved in relief with scrolls of conventional leaves of the 
style common in the ornamentation of the Alhambra, the stems being interlaced. 
On the sides are hunting scenes; on the body of the casket are broad borders formed 
of pairs of birds and deer, alternating, each pair facing, and above them a series of 
triple arches. The cover is in the same style, but that the borders are much simpler, 
and in one panel a piece from another casket has been inserted. The enameled 
mounts are an interesting feature and form an important landmark in the history 
of enameling in Spain. The patterns of these are the simplest geometrical designs, 
and the colors blue and white; but there is every appearance of these being the 
original mounts, and if this be the case they must be of the middle of the eleventh 
century; for the great historical value of this object consists in its bearing the 
da*^e of its manufacture, A. H. 441 (A. D. 1049-50), the name of its maker, Abd-er 
Rahman ibu Zeyyan, who made it at Cuenca for Hosam-ud-Daulat Abu Mohammad. 

"Another casket, of nearly equal importance, comes from the Cathedral of Gerona, 
where it is usually placed upon the High Altar. This, though equally of Arab work, 
is very diflerent in style as well as material. It is entirely covered with plates of 
silver gilt, embossed with open scrolls inclosing symmetrical flowers, the details of 
which are inlaid with niello. Around the edge of the lid, as in the previous exam- 
ple, is a Cufic inscription stating that it was made in Cordova by the order of 
Al-Hakam II, the Caliph of Spain, more celebrated for his studious habits than for 
warlike achievements, who died in A. D. 976. The inscription states that Al-Hakam 
ordered it for his son, and gives the name of the maker (Riano, p. 12). But for this 
inscription the style of the ornament would probably have led to the casket being 
assigned to a later date. 

"These two caskets are without any mixture of Western motives in their decora- 
tion, and are of special interest in the history of art industries from the precision of 
their date and country of manufacture. 

"Am(mg the altar caskets one of the most beautiful is a cylindrical ivory box 
from the Cathedral of Saragossa. It is of Oriental work, the sides pierced with 
delicate tracery, and with bands of Arabic inscrii)tion in relief round the edge. 
These boxes, though by no means common, arc well known, and two in the British 
Museum have always been thought to be of Persian origin, and it is possible that 
the example now in (luestion may be also of Persian work. It has, however, an 
enrichment of b.iuds of delicate filigree work, pa.ssing over and around it, which 
are certainly Moorish and of the late fifteenth century. This is decided by their 
similarity in style and work to the mounts of the sword of Boabdil belonging to 
the Manpies de Viane. In ))oth specimens there are Arabic inscriptions, outlined

ill thiu wire, niuuinj;' over the surface, a peculiar method that seems to have been 
emphiyedonly bj^ the Moors, aud about this period. At the Cathedral of Saragossa 
this is used to contain a cylindrical pyx, which is also exhibited. The pyx is 
quite plain, of silver gilt, and upon the Hat cover is engraved and enameletl a coat 
of arms surrounded by an inscription. 

"A painted ivory casket, of the style usually called in England Sicilian, is shown 
by the Royal Academy of History. This bears upon it, many times repeated, the 
arms of Aragou-Sicily, and is said to have belonged to the King Don Martin, of Ara- 
gon, who died A. I). 1410. The ornamental scrolls between the shields are of unusual 
beauty and freedom, and a band of carved Cutic letters of an ornate character gives 
it an oriental aspect, which is but faiutly seen in the other designs. Though the 
painting is uot in the best state of preservation, this box is a charming specimen of 
the Moorish art of Sicily. 

"The mudejar style, that is. the combination of Moorish or Saracenic aud Chris- 
tian art, is perhaps even better shown in a i>air of wooden doors with gilt bronze 
fittings from the Cathedral of Seville. The paneling of these might be from a 
Cairene mosque, so purely Saracenic are their design, while their borders are com- 
posed of Biblical texts in well-carved black letter, aud the bronze fittings are in 
accord with the ornament. The purity of the two stoles is the lemarkable feature 
of these doors, each keeping unmixed its own ])eculiai- characteristics, and yet 
remaining in perfect harmony. 

''The \ery early aud interesting 'Arquilla de los Reyes.' the reli<[uary of King 
Alfonso III (cl Alagno) . aud his Queen, Ximeua,* should ])roperly have been mentioned 
earlier, but that its style aud work are quite foreign to the Moorish taste. Alfonso 
the Great reigned as King of the Asturias and Leon from 866 to 910 A. D., aud the 
shrine is therefore interesting as an authentic monument of a period of which few 
remains exist, though it can scarcely be said to have high claims as a work of art. 
It is of the usual oblong form with pyramidal lid and nearly covered with silver 
plates embossed aud otherwise ornamented. Upon the lid is the inscription -Jhle- 
fotisvs Bex Scemena Ilegina,' with a figure of the Agnus Dei between the two names. 
Upon the sloping sides are embossed the symbols of the Evangelists, Lucas and lohaun 
being upon the front slope (the eagle very like a dove), and the angel of St. Matthew 
on the left, with the word Angelvs in place oftheuame of the Evangelist. Ou thesloj)e 
at the back is a cartouche or frame of the last century, with the names of the Saints 
Diodorus and Deodatus, whose relics were doubtless contained in the shrine. The 
front is in two stages, each consisting of six round-headed arches formed of cloisons, 
some of which still contain the triangular or pear-shaped slabs of glass and stone, 
with which originally all were embellished. Within the arches are, upon the upper 
ranges, embossed trees or plants more or less symmetrical, and in the lower, figures 
of angels facing the middle, three in direction. The execution is throughout of the 
rudest character, the figures of the angels being reduced to the most elemental rep- 
resentations of the human figure and their wings more like leaves than any feathered 
limb. Tlie presence of the cloisonne work, as a survival of Visigothic methods, 
gives the object a peculiar interest, though it shoukl at the same time l>e pointed 
out that it is not cloisonne enamel. There can be no doubt that the stones or glass 
were cut and placed in ])ositi<iii \\ ithout the ap])lic;itiou of heat, and do not there- 
fore constitute enamel." 

The description of other interesting altar ornaments is found in Mr. Read's paper: 

•"The Cathedral of Astorga sends a very beautiful globular vessel of rock crystal, 

engraved in the Bast with elegant scrolls in relief. This is attributed, and probably 

with justice, to the eleventh century; its beauty is, however, much lessened by a 

seventeenth century gilt mount, which has transformed it into a tall I'-handied 



* This would serve equally well for Alfouzo IV, wliose Queen also bore the name 
of Ximena. This King abdicated in 927, and his Queen died in the i)ievious year.

vase. An e(iually l)eaatifnl object, bat by far dititereiit character, is the crystal 
Navecilla, a crystal ship on wheels, with elaborate Gothic mcrnnts of silver gilt from 
the Cathedral of Toledo. It is about 15 inches in length, the body of the vessel 
made of rock crystal, above which is a considerable superstructure of silver gilt in 
which the ribs of the ship are indicated. At the prow and stern the bulwarks are 
formed of a band of eh'gant tracery surmouuted by a cresting of leaves. The iigure- 
head is a wyveru in full relief, and the keel is formed of a band of boldly modeled 
leaf- work. All the lines of the construction are very graceful, and the composition 
is i)leasing as well as unusual. It is said to have been the projierty of Dona .luana 
la Loca, and jnobably became the property of the Cathedral as a votive otl'ering. 
Another ship, of which the body is formed of a large turbo shell, is shown from 
Saragossa, but this, though very quaint, and of perhaps a somewhat earlier date, 
can not be compared for beauty with the ciystal ship of Toledo." 

The painted enamels can not be better described than by the pen of Mr. Read: 
" It is somewhat surprising to find among the ecclesiastical objects from the 
various cathedrals so few painted enamels that are worthy of note. A good trip- 
tych belonging to the Cathedral of Saragossa would seem to be from the hand of 
Nardon Peuicaud or of his school. The central subject is of the Adoration of the 
Magi, painted in the usual m^iuer, the faces somewhat round, and here and there 
the small raised jewels or rosettes backed with foil. The Conde de Valencia has 
also a triptych by the same artist, who seems to have been popular in Spain, to judge 
by the comparative frequency of his works. Three other enamels in the collection 
shown by the Conde de Valencia de Don Juan are, however, of far greater interest 
and beauty. The first of these is of North Italian work of the fifteenth century, a 
circular pectorial medallion, with a hinged front displaying both inside and out 
scenes from the Passion paiuted in the exciuisite style characteristic of this period 
and country, and of which we have a few good examples in the British Museum. 
The back of this charming pendant is formed of a plate of pearl shell engraved with 
the Crucifixion, and evei-y part seems in perfect preservation. The two other 
enamels are of Limoges, the more iuiportant being a brilliant triptych, unsigned, 
but doubtless by Leonard Limousin, the second ar. equally brilliant but small plaque 
paiuted by Pierre Reymond in 1537, with the Good Shepherd giving crooks to the 
shepherds, and the exhortation to the shepherds is inscribed in two panels at the 
top. The triptych represents the Last Supper, and has the arms of Lorraine beneath 
quarterly and an iuescutcheon of pretence of Lorraine, while on the wings are the 
arms of Lorraine (on a Ijeud three alerions) and those of France, as well as a motto, 
which would point to the piece having been made for a personage of distinction. 
The Conde de Valencia also exhibits a large and interesting series of the small 
champleve enamel plaques from horse trappings, most of which have devices of an 
armorial character, both Moorish a.id Christian. These little ornaments Avere used 
in all European countries in mediieval times, and a large number, such as are to be 
found here, could scarcely fail to produce some iuterestiug results, if time were given 
to their study 

" The absence of any large number of Limoges or Italian enamels is not so surpris- 
ing as the entire want of Flemish plate of the period of Charles V or earlier. There 
are no doubt some ]»ieces which, on examination, would prove to be of Flemish 
manufacture, but there is certainly nothing like a disjtlay of such objects, and it 
seems scarcely credible that great (juantities of church plate and objects of domestic 
use were not brought from Flanders, a country where art of this kind had attained 
to such perfection." 

Mr. Read also describes two famous historical Arab standards, which I will give 
in his words : 

"The Monastery of Las Huelgas at Burgos has sent one of its greatest treasures 
in the standard of the Almohade Sultan, captured by Alfonso VIII at the famous 
battle of Las Navas in 1212, a wonderful specimen of .\ral) silk w caving, still pre- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 103 

serving in many jiarts the original colors. Though much restored it still ])ossessc8 
the most im|)ortant of its original features. It is covered with versos of the Koran, 
the Mohammedan formula and other Arabic inscriptions. This precious relic is tra- 
ditionally stated to have been given by the victorious King to the monastery which 
still i)ossesses it, and it is only used in the procession of Corpus Christi. Senor Riauo 
thinks it probable that 'Alfonso VIII' should be 'Alfonso XI' (1812-1350), as he con- 
siders the banner to be of the fourteenth century work. An appropriate pendant to 
this comes from the Cathedral of Burgos, the standard of Alfonso VIII carried at the 
same battle, or, to speak more accurately, all that now renuiius of it, representing 
the Crucitixion, the Virgin, and St. .John. 

"An Aral) standard of similar work to the tirst belongs the Cathedral of Toledo. 
This is the Bandera del Salado, made in Fez in the year 1312 A. 1>. The central 
design is very original, and the combinations of colors singularly beautiful. It is 
formed of sixteen crescents of gold, arranged in four lines, each having within it, in 
white on a green ground, the Mohammedan formula repeated eight times, each cres- 
cent containing one-half of the fomula; and around is a broad border formed by 
chapters of the Koran, written in intertwined Cutic letters. The effect of the alter- 
nating tints of g(dd, green, red, and white, which appear to be little affected by time, 
is very rich and harmonious." 

The rich armor was very striking. Among the collection was noted a comi)lete 
Gothic armor of the tifteenth century. Another suit of the same century had a 
helmet with a human mask. The jousting harnesses of Charles V and Philiii II, 
elaborately chiseled and plated with gold, were displayed on manikins of horse and 
rider. There were also a number of figures showing the equipment of the foot sol- 
diers of the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries. On the walls were helmets, tro- 
phies of swords, daggers, arbalests, coats of mail, helmets, etc., disjilaying a remark- 
able richness in form and ornamentations. 

Senor Don Jose Estrech, of Barcelona, seut a fine series intended to show the his- 
tory of arms and armor from the eighth century down to the present time. 

Among other pistols, muskets, and firearms, 'chiseled, incrusted, and damaskeened, 
was the pistol of Charles V, made by the famous Peter Pech. 

The sword of Pizarro and of Cortes, with weapons and armor stated to be those of 
the conquerors of Peru, formed an interesting group. 

Several swords of Boabdil. the last Moorish King of Granada, shown are of remark- 
able artistic value as well as of romantic interest. They are thus described by Mr. 
C. H. Read: 

"One of them has been already mentioned as coming from the Koyal Armoury 
but it is plain in make, and its principal interest is its history. It is far otherwise 
with the beautiful swords belonging to theMarc|ues de Vianeand the Marques Cara- 
potejar, and another sword belonging to the Archa'ological Museum of Madrid, 
though somewhat older, belongs to the same class. This last is made entirely of 
metal, the hilt and guard being of bronze with gilt details, the blade of steel, the 
total length 40 inches. The pommel is gloViular, flattened on the two faces, on each 
of which is a circular medallion engraved with ornamental Cufic characters; the 
grip is fusiform, engraved with circles Joined together by a single twist, and con- 
taining also Cufic letters. The guard is of the peculiar form characteristic of the 
Moorish swords of the late fifteenth century, viz, rounded shoulders ending on 
either side of the blade in a narrow limb running parallel with it, the outer edge of 
the limb curving inward to the end, where it suddenly turns outward in a hook, 
the hollow formed by this curving of the limb being filled up in this case with a 
plate of metal pierced with circular holes. The faces of the guard are (juite fiat, 
and engraved with conjoined circles, like those on the grip, the spaces between 
them being filled with engraved floral designs. The bands forming the circles are 
in all cases gilt. The blade is straight and two-edged and has upon one face the 
stamji of the armorer, a circle containing badly written characters which have

uot yt't been read, Imt they are conjettiucd to be Hebrew, from the fact of the .lewa 
in Si)aiu devoting themselve.s to the manufacture of arm.s. This sword came from 
the Church of San Marcehi, the warrior saint, at Leon, and was there long con- 
nected with him. It is l)elieved that it may have been a gift by the King Ferdi- 
nand the Catholic on the translation of the body of the martyr from Africa. The 
Boabdil sword of the Marques Campotejar is of the same general type, but is infi- 
nitely more sumptuous in execution, and, in addition, it retains its scabbard com- 
plete. The mounts, both of the sword and scabbard, are of silver gilt, embossed and 
richly chased with formal floral designs of the same style as those of the ivory 
casket of the Cathedral of Palencia (6((^;ra, p. 24), though, of course, the sword is of 
a much later date. The mounts are further enriched with bands and medallions of 
translucent cloisonne enamel, a feature which this sword has in common with that 
of the Marques de Yiaue. An interesting, and to some extent peculiar-, circum- 
stance connected with this sword is that, notwithstanding the pure Moorish char- 
acter of its ornament, yet it would seem to have been the work of a Christian artif- 
icer, woi'kiug for the Moors at Granada. The bonds of amity wliicli existed 
between Boabdil and Ferdinand, for some years before the final stand made by the 
Moors for the possession of Granada, would account for tlie presence in the Court 
of Boabdil of Christian workmen, who doubtless succeeded in serving two masters 
in different capacities. Upon the plain backs of one of the two tabs to which the 
sword belt was attached is stamped, in characters of the period, the name Iran 
Abad, with the pomegranate of Granada, as well as another stamp not easy to inter- 
pret. This Christian stamp illustrates a remark of Senor Riano (in his introduction 
to the Catalogue of Spanish Works of Art in the South Kensington Museum) : 'The 
continued contact of the Christian and Mohammedauraces, notwithstanding the bar 
barism of the time and the difference of creed, did not oblige them to live perpetu- 
ally as euemies. This contact could not fail to influence works of art and industry, 
and for this reason many archaeological objects of the Spanish Middle Ages possess 
a peculiar charactei.' 

"The third sword of this type and, like the last, once the property of Boalxlil, is 
that belonging to the Marrjuesde Viane, who exhibits also the velvet jacket, another 
sword, and a dagger, stated to have been taken from the Moorish King at his defeat 
(in 1492) and given by Ferdinand the Catholic to one of the ancestors of the present 
owner. One of these is the most perfect example in the exhibition of the refine- 
ment and richness of effect of which Arab art is capable. It combines the highest 
eft'orts of the enameler, the carver, and the goldsmith, and doubtless the blade is of 
corresponding quality, and in every part it is well preserved. The actual grip is 
of ivory, the rest of the hilt is of gold, entirely covered with granular work and 
filigree, in which are set at intervals eight pointed and cruciform panels of translu- 
cent cloisonne enamel. The ivory grip is deeply carved with geometrical designs 
forming panels of various shapes, filled with Arabic inscriptions alluding to the 
weapon, and ornamental leaves and other devices, and where the ivory joins the 
metal are two broad bands of cloisonne enamel (the cloisons being here, as upon 
other parts of the mounting, of gold) composed of scroll work of the greatest beauty, 
interrupted by shaped panels containing Arabic inscriptions, among which might 
be expected the name of the artist, but this nowhere appears. The pommel is 
spherical, but at the upper end is prolonged as a straight point, and is entirely 
covered with the granular work and enameled panels mentioned above. This 
granular goldsmith's work is of the samc^ style as that of the bands of the Persian 
casket from the Cathedral of Saragossa and might in fact be the work of the same 
artist. The ground is filled with minute ])cllet3 of gold, through which run lines 
of Arabic inscriptions, outlined in flat gold wire, thus leaving the interior of each 
letter empty. The enameled crosses upon the ])ommel are changed into a diflerent 
form by the exigencies of the shape of the iiommel, the artist finding it ni'cessary 
to reduce the four limbs of the cross tt) three, and the corresponding outlines of the 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 105 

eight iioiuted panels are iiigouioiisly altereil aud adai)ted to tliesaiiu; end. The sur- 
face of the guard is ornamented witli similar work, and it is only necessary to meu- 
tion that thetvo ends running parallel with the hlade terminate in tlie heads of 
monsters, from each of which springs an elegant openwork border of sjiiral scrolls, 
enameled in white and other colors. The bhide is straight, aud has the stamp of 
the armorer upon one side. The sheath is of red leather, though very little of this 
foundation is visible, as one-half of its length is hidden by mounts matching those 
of the sword itself, and these fit into each other so closely that when the sword is 
in the scabbard it is impossible to distinguish where the guard ends and the scab- 
bard mounts begin. This sword is described, and the inscriptions are given, by 
Senor Kiano, p. 84. 

"The enameled details upon this sword are of jteculiar interest, not only for 
their intrinsic merits, which are very great, but also as serving to decide the origin 
of the beautiful stirrups in the Forman collection. These stirrups were exhibiteil 
before the Society of Antiiiuities of London, and are described in their proceedings 
(Vol. XIV, 169). It is sufficient here to say that they are of Moorish form, (»f iron, 
plated with silver, which is engraved with Oriental designs, while upon the sides 
are semicircular plates of silver with nielloed designs somewhat in the style of 
the arabesciues of Aldegrever. Around these are borders of cloisonne enamel on gold, 
in style and execution so like the sword just described that there can be little ques- 
tion as to their common origin, though it is probable that the sword is earlier in 
date by perhaps a quarter of a century. The niello plates of the stirrups also 
could very well be of a Spanish make, as the use of the niello is not uucommon, both 
in Moorish and Christian work of medieval and later times. An example of this is 
near at hand, in the second sword shown by the Marques de Viane. This is more a 
weapon for use than for parade, and is a simple form, Ijy no means beautiful, though 
the details are planned and carried out with the greatest skill. Like the other, it 
has a straight blade, apparently also of Christian make, or at least not Moorish; the 
handle is entirely of ivory, the grip cylindrical, with a thicker cylinder above and 
below, and forming the pommel, being slightly curved inward at the sides. The 
whole handle is engraved with beautiful scroll work, brought into relief by an 
inlay of black substance, probably akin to niello, and upon the sides of the pommel 
is the shield of arms of the kings of Granada, as seen upon the azulejos of the 
Alhambra. The scabbard is in keeping with the modesty of the sword, being a 
plain leather sheath, tooled like a bookbinding with a scale pattern, aud having a 
silver mount and chape, the former engraved and nielloed with Arabic inscriptions 
and the shield of Granada, and the chape engraved in a similar manner. The con- 
trast between this simple and useful weapon and the gorgeous blade shown beside 
it is most remarkable and instructive, aud the fortunate owners of them botb may 
be congratulated on the possession of hereditary treasuresof a kind aud quality but 
seldom seen. 

" There now remains to notice the collections of pottery, whicli are contined almost 
entirely to the lustered wares so well known and so highly appreciated all over the 
world for their decorative ([ualities. Before describing tiiese, however, it is desirable 
to allude to an altogether unexpected, though by no means unimportant, exhibit of 
mosque lamps of ])ottery and glass sent by the Imperial Ottoman Museum at Con- 
stantinople. 01 the jjottery lamps the most curious, though the least ornamental, is 
one with two rows of handles, covered with oil gilding, and decorated only with two 
narrow bands of inscription in blue, the rest of the surface being plain white; prob- 
ably a product of the potteries either at Cairo or Damascus. Far more beautiful, 
and of unusually large size, are two richly-colored lamps of Khodian ware, with 
bosses round the lower part filled with elegant arabesque designs, the rest of the 
surface covered with inscriptions and ornament. The red and turiiuoise colors are 
of unusual brilliancy, and the execution of the ornament, as well as the outlines of 
the lami)s themselves, leave nothing to be desired. Four small lamps, painted entirely 



106 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

ill ]>;»1(' lilno, tlion^li neither so unusual nor so immediately attractive, are fine speci- 
mens of their kind. Their princii'al decoration consists of bands of ornamental 
Cufic, the spaces between V)eing filled with delicately penciled devices that recall 
the illuminated Persian manuscripts of the fifteenth century. The glass lamps seem 
to be of Venetian manufacture, and probably of the fifteenth or early sixteenth cen- 
tury. They are all of lace glass of various patterns, somewhat coarse in make, and 
they preserve the usual form of the mosque lamp. In addition to these there are 
two trumpet-shaped lamps of the same kind of glass, which have been used either 
as the oil receptacle of a pottery lamp or perhaps independently, as they would be 
too large for any but the largest size of lamp. Some of these Venetian lamps have 
been thought by their Mussulman owners to be too simple iu style, and accordingly 
they have been painted with tiowiug scrolls in gold, which gives them rather a tawdry 
appearance. 

" Of Spanish wares the only collections of any note are those of the Conde de 
Valencia de Don Juan, Senor Don Guillermo de Osma, and of the Archieological 
Museum of Madrid. Unfortunately the latter collection must be dismissed with but 
little notice, for the objects were arranged iu panels upon the walls of the room, 
reaching to the ceiling, and it was therefore barely possible to see them, and quite 
out of the question to examine any of them closely. One of the plates is said to 
have an Arabic word upon it, a most unusual thing, but as it was at least 12 
feet from the floor it was not possible to verify this statement, which has already 
been doubted. Among the objects nearer at hand was, however, one of the famous 
Alhambra vases, a fine specimen standing more than 4 feet high, but unfortunately 
wanting one of its handles. It is decorated in yellow or pale blue, with a profusion 
of arabesque designs and inscriptions, one of the latter referring to its use as a 
water jar. This vase came from the jiarish church of Hernos (Jaen), w^here it was 
used as a holy-water vessel. A similar story is told of an equally fine vase, now in 
the museum at Palermo. Another jar of Toledan make is interesting as bearing the 
name of the maker. It is an oviform vessel of common clay, nearly 3 feet in height, 
nnglazed, and with two projecting ears or handles on the shoulders. The ornament 
consists of imjjressions from oblong stamps, with animals, monsters, etc. Near the 
neck are impressed three stamps inscribed iu black letter en toled me feci dj perez. 
This dates probably from the sixteenth century. 

"The collections of the Conde de Valencia and Senor de Osma areshown together, 
and comprise a superb series of the lustered wares of the various Spanish factories, 
a numlter of tiles, interesting for their devices as well as for the technical processes 
of their manufacture, and a large and unique series of a curious ware believed to 
have been made in Andalusia in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, but of which 
the history is at ]iresent somewhat uncertain. Among the lustered wares the most 
remarkable pieces are two dishes painted in blue and luster, with figures in fantastic 
costumes of the fifteenth century, one of the dishes representing a fishing scene, car- 
ried around the dish in a quaint fashion. T\yo covered bowls are also worthy of 
remark, both from their rarity and the originality of their design, the covers being of 
the same shape as the bowls, but somewhat larger in the mouth, and when placed 
together the form is that of a barrel with narrow ends. Many other pieces of this 
beautiful series deserve mention, if space permitted. The Andalusian ware, how- 
ever, is less known, and therefore deserves more particular notice. Though it can 
scarcely be said to possess so great a charm as the lustered wares, yet it has an origi- 
nality and vigor which is rarely found in any but the earliest productions of Valen- 
cia and Malaga. It recalls in appearance the Italian sgratfiato wares, though the 
proc( ss of manufacture is of quite a different character. The method employed is, 
however, not quite clear, but seems to have been to draw the outlines of the design 
in some substance which was thrown off in the furnace, leaving little or no trace of 
its presence, but which, before the firing, ])()ssessed an antipathy to the colored 
glaze used to fill up the design, so that these glazes could be applied close up to the 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECKETARV. 107 

edge of the outliiios without in any in.stauce imi)inging npon them. In no case is 
the clearness of the outline interfered with, thougli it is rare to find an instance of 
the glaze being otherwise than close to its edge. The glazes are thick and heavy, 
probably with a base of tin, and the colors used are rich and full — amber, green, 
slaty blue, yellow, and manganese. The collection comjirises five large dishes, 
twenty-four small, an oviform vase, two large panels with the arms of Castile-Leon 
and Aragon-Sicily, as well as tiles. The designs of the dishes are vigorously, if 
somewhat coarsely drawn, and include a head of a young man in the costume of the 
late fifteenth century, a deer and other animals, heraldic lions, and motives derived 
from plants and trees. Some of the tiles have inscriptions in black letter, and the 
oviform vase bears the legend, ^fj€l rosado coad (Honey of roses). It may be of inter- 
est to mention that this ware is being imitated in Spain at the present time, and a 
good many examples of these imitations are to be found in the 8h()}>s in Madrid; 
and though the character of the work lends itself easily to imitation, there are essen- 
tial ditlerences between the old and the new." 

There were few musical instruments. Two organs of Charles V, shown for their 
artistic cases; a Moorish rebeek of four strings, and a clavichord may be mentioned. 
The latter is one of the most curious musical instruments belonging to the history 
of music in the seventeenth century. The instrument exhibited is said to have been 
made in 1625 by Fraz Raymundo Truchado. I heard several performances upon this 
instrument and found the music not unpleasing. 

Of music books there was a great uuniber, the ponderous illuminated missals of 
the Escorial and other cathedrals forming an attractive exhibit. . A MSS. of the 
thirteenth century, entitled "Himnos Religiosos,'' is interesting as showing early 
part music. The MSS. is preserved in the National Library. Another folio in vellum 
from the Cathedral of Tuy contains the psalms of St. Augustine, with the first page 
of ancient music without the pentagram ( Sin penta(irama). 

There were in the exposition numerous documents relating to the history of the 
discovery of America, consisting of letters, charts, books, etc. The Papal exhibit 
contained two famous charts on vellum of the Old and New Worlds, made in the 
third decade of the sixteenth century. The better preserved map measures 85 centi- 
meters in height and 2.09 meters in width. It bears the inscription : " Carta Vniver- 
sal en que se contiene todo lo que del mundo se ha descuhierto fasta ayova, hizola Diego 
Bibera, cosmographo de Su Majestad, ano de 1529, en Serilla. La qual se devide en dos 
partes cotiforme la capitulacion que hicieron Jos Catholicos Ecyes de Espaiia e el Bey Juan 
de Fortogual en Tordesillas, ano de 1494.'' On either side of the line showing the 
division of the New World between Spain and Portugal are the banners of these 
countries. In Peru the concjucst had extended to Sierra Morcna, on whose southern 
border is written in red ink the name of the last peo]iIe then known, Chincax Cibad — 
that is, the city of Chincha, founded by Almagro. 

The other chart is perhai>s older. It bears the famous line of Alexander VI. It 
shows the plan of the City of Mexico and the illuminated portraits of Montezuma, 
Atahualpa, and Prestcr John, of the Indias. 

The National Library exhibited 1.50 manuscripts comprising Greek, Persian, 
Hebrew, and Arab codices, bililes, liturgical, and devotional works; works on 
science, art, history, geograjjhy, literature, and the theater, autographs and codices 
notable for the importance of the text, binding, ornamentation, etc. 

Among the Hebrew manuscripts is an interesting Book of Esther, which the Jews 
read on feast days. It is a roll of parchment 3.50 meters long and 29 centimeters 
wide, dating from the beginning of the fourteenth century, written in 24 columns of 
22 lines each. 

Among the numerous Arabic manuscripts was the book of Alfarabi, entitled 
"Music," which explains the beginning of music, voices, tones, and instruments. It 
contains drawings of instruments and figures of music. This remarkable codex of 
the fourteenth century is the best of the three existing in Europe, one being in the 
Ambrosiana at Milan and the other in Leiden. 



108 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

The lirst etlitiou of the i)olygh)t bible of Cardinal Cisneros dated 1514-1517 and 
the only eojiy of the tirst edition of Don Quijote were shown. 

A few Jewish relies of interest were displayed. One of these was a i)reciou8 frag- 
ment of a roll of the Thorah or Hebrew Pentateiicli of the fonrteenth century, which 
no doubt belonged to an ancient Spanish synagogue. The fragment contains the 
last chapters of the Book of Leviticus and the first chapters of Numbers. Another 
book from the t'athedral of Toledo, written in rabbinical characters, had ''?■! hojnn 
de arhol Uamado Parra van ensarfadas en nna euerda." 

There was an astrolabe of burnished bronze made by Philip II in the sixteenth 
century, as the inscription shows. 

There was a beautiful mosque lamj) from the Alhambra, composed of four parts, 
the upper formed by four apples in delicate openwork combining the motto of the 
Al-Ahmares; the second below a kind of pyramidal cliimney, each face of hne, 
engraved fretwork ; the third section is a large screen composed of four wings fretted 
and engravotl with the Al-Ahmares motto in African characters; the fourth section 
is fnnncl-sliajjed, having attached eight fretwork arms. Tliis lamji was ordered by 
the Sultan Mohammed III of Granada in the year 705 of the Hcgira, 1305 A. 1). 

From the same city is an oil holder covered with very delicate work with enamel 
inscriptions in gold of the purest Grenadine handicraft. It dates from the fourteenth 
century. The pieces just described belong to the National Archieological Mnseum 
of Spain. 

From Leon were shown two torch holders of four lights. They are formed of a 
disk of plate iron with fretted ogival ornamentation. In the center of the disk the 
sockets to remove tlie links are grouped. These date from the fifteenth to the six- 
teenth centuries. 

The Escorial sent a very beautiful lamp of bronze and coral of the seventeenth 
century. 

Mention may be made of the unique series of royal, ecclesiastical, and munici})al 
seals of wax and lead, the jewelry and miniatures and the largo collection of artistic 
ironwork for which Spain is so famous. 

The naval and military museums made an important chronological exhibit of their 
respective subjects. 

THE world's COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 

At the begiuiiiiig of the fiscal year, preparations lor tlie World's 
Fair had been iu active progress for fifteen months, and many of the 
exhibits liad been completed, monnted, ])rovided with labels, and were 
being packed. ]Much progress had also been made in the construction 
of cases, and the taxidermists had finished a number of the most 
important groui)S of animals. 

Uncertainty as to the amount of money which would ultimately be 
appropriated by Congress for our exhibit, and similar uncertainty as 
to the amount of space which would finally be available in the Govern- 
ment building, the dimensions of which had already been much con- 
tracted from those propo.sed iu the original plan, owing to the costli- 
ness of building in Chicago, made it impossible as yet to decide exactly 
what would be sent. Indeed, the indefinite manner in which the 
appropriations were made was a cause of great embarrassment, since 
no positive plans could l)e made, and work, which otherwise (;ould have 
been done deliberately and at moderate expense, was delayed until the 
last moment, to be finished in haste and at greater cost. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 109 

After the adjounimeut of Congress in Auiiiist. the character of the 
exhibit was linally decided upon, and as 80011 as the (xovcnnnent l>iiihl- 
iiig- had been completed and the space alh)tted, tlie plans for installa- 
tion were made. It was not until December, however, that the build- 
inu' was so farcompletc<l that the space could be studied with reference 
to the linal arraiiiicnient of the collections. 

The work of shipping began in February, and continued until late 
iu April, when the last cars were loaded. Twenty-five carloads in all 
were sent, among the last being the collections returned from the exliibi- 
tion at Madrid. The total number of boxes was 1,305, aggregating 145 
tons, or more than a quarter of a million pounds. 

The amount of space finally occupied by the Institution was 21,'J50 
square feet, of which 5.875 feet were set apart for main isles or thor- 
oughfares. This was much less than had originally been planned for, 
and necessitated the omission of many objects and the too great crowd- 
ing of others. The work of installation was begun in ]March, at which 
time ^Ir. Earll, the special agent in charge of the exhibit, Avent to 
Chicago to remain through the Exposition. Sixteen expert mechanics 
and pre])arators went from the Museum in March, and about twenty 
additional mechanics and laborers were constantly employed iu Chicago 
from that time until the installation was completed. Early in April a 
number of the curators went on to superintend the arrangement of 
then- resi^ective exhibits. 

Notwithstanding the delays of the railroads, many of our cars having 
been three weeks on the way, the exceedingly inclement weather, which 
caused nuich sickness in the force, and the unfinished state of the 
building, and the sliowers of rain and snow which found their way 
through the roof upon the specimens as they were being unpacked and 
upon the polished wood and glass of the cases, the installation was 
practically ended before the opening of the Exposition, and at the 
time when the doors were thrown open there was every appearance of 
completion, although, owing to the causes already mentioned, a con- 
siderable annumt of work had to be done in May. 

At the end of the fiscal year the Exposition had run (uily one-tliird 
of its course, but the throngs of visitors* and the appreciative com- 
ments of those qualified to Judge of the merits of tiie exhibition indi- 
cate that notwithstanding tlie many dilfirnlties which it lias been nec- 
essary to face the participation of the Iustituti(»n in the Exposition is 
a successful one. 

The character of the collections sent is discussed very fully in the 
review of the work of the scientific departments of the Museum. The 
description of the exhibit as a whole will be deferred until after the 
cU)se of the Exposition.

110 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

The exhibits of the Siuithsoiiiau Institution were designedly selected 
so as to supplement and be supplemented by those displayed elsewhere 
in Jackson Park. It was our purpose to avoid all riv^alry, and, so far 
as could be done without disobeying the implied requirement of the law, 
that the exhibits should illustrate all the functions of Government 
institutions, to show nothing which would be shown well by others. 

In consequence, our exhibits can not well be considered except iu 
connection with tlie others of a similar character. This has been well 
done by Mr. William H. Dall, in a series of three letters on "Science 
at the Fair," published by the IS'ew York Nation, as being the result 
of a careful review by an unbiased observer and the only really careful 
report of the kind which has been made.* 

The accompanying diagram of tlie floor space of the Government 
building shows in a general way the assignment of our space and its 
relation to that occupied by the other Departments of the Government. 
(PI. 56). 

The exhibit of the Government was made under the direction of a 
board of control and management, appointed by the President in 
accordance with an "Act providing for the celebration of the four 
hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher 
Columbus," etc., approved April 25, 1890. t This board was composed 
of one member representing each Department. At the beginning of 
the Exposition the board was composed of the original appointees, as 
follows: Sevellon A. Brown, whief clerk, Depai'tment of State; A. B. 
Nettleton, Assistant Secretary, Treasury Department ; Maj. Clifton 
Comly, U. S. A., War Department; Commodore K. W. Meade, U. S. 
N., Navy Department; A. D. Hazen, Third Assistant Postmaster- 
General, Post-Oftice Department; H.A.Taylor, Commissioner of Rail- 
roads, Department of the Interior ; E. C. Foster, General Agent, 
Department of Justice; Edwin Willits, Assistant Secretary, Depart- 
ment o f Agriculture ; J. W. Collins, Assistant, U. S. Fish Commission, 
and G. Brown Goode, Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution; 
but shortly after the opening of the Exposition Mr. W. E. Curtis 
became the representative of the Department of State, Mr, F. A. 
Stocks of the Treasury, Prof. F. W. Clarke of the Interior, and Dr. 
Tarleton H. Bean of the Fish Commission. 

The functions and responsibilities of this board were very different 
from those of the boards previously charged by Congress with the 
preparation of Government exhibits, and it remains to be seen whether 
the change is altogether advantageous, either iu the matter of efticiency 
or economy. In previous exhibitions the representative of each 
Department has been looked upon as the representative of its otticial 
head, and the Government exhibit has been an assemblage of indi-

vidiial exhibits, each illustiatiuu', under the control of the Department 
itself, its functions and administrative methods. 

The Chicago board, apparently rather through the decisions of the 
Treasury Department tlian by reason of the intent of the law, has been 
forced into (piite another position, lender tlie provision of section 18, 
which subjects the ''itemized accounts and vouchers" to the approval 
of the Secretary of the Treasury, jurisdiction in detail over the affairs 
of the board was assumed by officials of that Department, and their 
rulings have formed, of necessity, the dominant standard of judgment. 
l>y virtue of an early ruling based u])on the provision of section 10, 
which empowers the heads «»f the I'^xecutive Departments and the 
directors of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum, and of 
the U. S. Fish Commission, to designate the articles which should com- 
pose the contributions of their respective branches, the initiative in 
respect to each article exhibited was vested in the heads of the 
branches. The jjower of final approval was retained in the Treasury, 
the board of management serving as an intermediary between the two 
authorities. 

It is held by the Treasury that the board as a whole is responsible 
for the exhibit as a whole, and that the relation of the heads of the 
Executive Departments to the board and to their own individual repre- 
sentatives is advisory rather than supervisory. The tendency of this 
is to place the members of the board at times in embarrassing positions, 
and in at least one instance has resulte<l in a complete alienation of the 
Exposition work of a department from the Department itself, and an 
open hostility betweeii the head -of the Department and his representa- 
tive. Notliing could be more unfortunate, and nothing could more 
thoroughly prevent the preparation of an exhibit which would l>e 
thoroughly representative. 

In connection with this policy has grown up also a disposition on the 
j)art of certain elements of the board organization to criticise the con- 
duct of the re[)resentatives of the Departments, and to attempt to 
control their action under the plea of " securing harmony and prevent- 
ing duplication." The outcome has been far from satisfactory, when 
contrasted with tlie direc% business-like, and less complicated methods 
followed by previous boards of maimgement. 

The appropriation of an aggregate sum by Congress, instead of a 
special appropriation to each Department, has also heen a cause of 
embarrassment. It is (piite imi)ossible for ten men, representing ten 
distinct interests, to divide such a sum among themselves equitably 
and to the satisfaction of all. Still more perplexing, especially in the 
early days of the prei)aration for the Exi)Ositiou, were the joint claims 
upon the same appropriation of the Government board of management 
and of the National Commission. This was fcutunately settled by 
Congress in 1S1>1, but the un<'ertainty as to the amount of money avail- 
able during the first year of preparation was not the least serious of 



112 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

the many obstacles to effectiv^e work at the most impoitaiit period of 
exhibition work — the beginning. 

It shonld also be said that the establishment of a board with inde- 
pendent fnnctions and a separate legal status seems likely to prove a 
source of expense for general purposes, far greater in proportion than 
has been found necessary in other exhibitions. 

In addition to the •s4:0(),()0() appropriated for the building, the aggre- 
gate of the allotments for the use of the Government board was 
$1>41),000, (»f wliich amount .") per cent, or $47,450, were set apart for the 
general expenses of the board of management, the remainder being 
allotted among the several Departments. Tlie amount available for the 
use of the Smithsonian exhibit, after deducting the 5 per cent con- 
tribute<l toward the expenses of the board, was sl.>.3,S07.50. 

By the pn (visions of a joint resolution approved March 3, 1803,* the 
secretary of the Smithsonian Institution was authorized to prepare 
and send for exhibition in the Woman's building any articles from the 
Museum illustrative of the life and development of tlie industries of 
women. In accordance with this authorization, a special exhibit was 
prepared and installed in the Woman's building under the direc^tion of 
Prof. Mason. The character of this exhibit is described in the discus- 
sion of his department. 

The original model of the colossal statue of Leif Erikson (the prop- 
erty of the city of Boston), which had been presented to the National 
Museum by the sculptor. Miss Anne Whitney, was also installed in the 
Woman's building at the request of the Board of Lady Managers, as 
well as a collection illustrating the history of lacemaking, prepared by 
Dr. Thomas Wilson. 

Very many requests were made by the authorities of the Exposition 
and by exhibitors for the loan of objects from the Museum, to be exhib- 
ited elsewhere than in the Government building, but these were with- 
out exception refused, on the ground that the Government had already 
provided for the exhibition of such objects as could be sent from Wash- 
ington in a special building which was more nearly fireproof than any 
other on the grounds, and that there was no legal authority for alk)w- 
ing the Museum material belDUging to the Government to pass out of 
the custody of its officials. This limitation did not, of course, apply 
to tlie Government building. Si)ecimens were lent to almost every 
department of the Government, especially to the Fish Commission, the 
Patent Ofiicc, the (geological Survey, the War Dej^artment, the Dej^art 
ment of xVgriculture, and the Treasury Department. Certain historical 
objects were also placed in the Convent of La Ivabida, which was rec- 
ognized as a Government building, forming part of the exhibit of the 
Department of State. 

It was perha])s regarded as a hardship by the officials in charge of 
the Anthropological building that material should not have been sent 
from the Government collections to swell the very interesting miscella-

neons display of ethuological objects wliicli were gathered there, but 
settin<i- aside tlie question of lack of legal authority, this building was 
especially open to the objection of not being fireproof. Everything 
l)ossible was done, however, to avoid interference with this department, 
by refraining from exhibiting in the (rovernment building objects of a 
kind similar to those which we were informed would be shown by the 
Exposition authorities. 

The ethnological and arclia'ological collecticnis in the iSmithsonian 
space were the joint exhibit of the Museum and the Bureau of Ethnol- 
ogy, and too jnnch can not be said of the enthusiastic work of Maj. 
Powell and the otlicers of the bureau in the development of this por- 
tion of the display, and especially in the preparation of the group of 
costumed figures of the aborigines of Xorth America. 

In addition to the exhibits sent from the Museum and the Bureau of 
Ethnology, a special alcove was devoted to the exhibit of the Smith- 
sonian Institution and its methods of work. Here were shown photo- 
graphs of the Smithsonian and Museum buildings; portraits of the 
three secretaries — Joseph Henry (1840-1878), Spencer Fullerton Baird 
(1878-1887), and Sanmel Pierpont Langley; the publications of the 
Smithsonian Institution, including the Annual Reports, the Smithsonian 
Contributions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collections, the Eeports 
of the National Museum, together with the Proceedings and Bulletins; 
publications of the Bureau of Ethnology; the publications of the 
National Academy of Sciences; the Reports of the American Historical 
Association (affiliated with the Institution), and the reports of the 
various scientific expeditions which have been conducted under the 
direction of the Institution. There was also a screen of photographs 
illustrating the discoveries of Prof. Henry, including those which led 
to the invention of the electric telegraph. 

It had been intended to publish a series of popular handbooks 
explaining the various collections exhibited, and also illustrated pam- 
phlets in regard to the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum, but 
the regulations issued by the local directory governing the distribution 
of books and catalogues were found to be so oi)pressive that this was 
abandoned, although nutch work had been done in the preparation of 
this feature of the exhibition. 

By the action of the Local Directory of the Exposition the whole 
matter of catalogues and illustrative literature was placed in the hands 
of a single firm of printers, Avho were unwilling to print anything with- 
out a guaranty that their sales should considerably exceed the cost of 
printing, and who refused to allow other publishers to enter the field. 
This illiberal i)olicy undoubtedly reduced very largelj^ the extent of 
the literature which usually grows out of such expositions, and is not 
only its chief educational agency, but one of its most important ])er- 
manent results, and it is to l)e hoi)ed that no future exhibition will be 
led into a similar error.

114 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1S93. 

Ackuowletlgmeiit sliould be made for assistance rendered by a num- 
ber of friends of the Institution, wiio by tlieir advice and cooperation, or 
by the loan of objects for exliibition, contributed materially to the 
success of tlie occasion. 

]\Ir. Geor.iie F. Ivunz assisted by his advice in the forming;- of the 
collection of gems and aninuil products, and lent from his private col- 
lection a number of Russian eikons. shown in the collection of reli- 
gious ceremonial objects. 

Tiftany & Co., of New York, lent an extensive collection of leathers, 
prepared from the skins of animals not ordinarily used in the arts, 
which was displayed among the animal products, and, as has always 
been our experience on occasions of exhibits, exhibited a spirit of gen- 
uine interest in the work 

Dr. Marcus Benjamin, of Xew York, lent his collection of portraits 
and autographs of the members of the National Academy of Sciences, 
and Mr. Albert Rosenthal assisted in the formation of the collection of 
American historical portraits. 

Walter H. Harris, esq., ex-sheriff of London, and one of the Koyal 
Conunissiouers from Great Britain, lent his unique collection of British 
war models. 

Mr. Hieromich Shugio lent a number of Japanese porcelains and 
arranged the synoptical collection showing the history of the ceramic 
art in Japan. 

Mr. Fritz Kaldenberg, of New Y'ork, lent his collection of carved 
and tinted ivories, and in other ways helped to build up the collection 
of animal products. Mr. Sulzberger, of Philadelphia, and ]\Ir. Hadji 
Ephraim Benguiat, of Boston, aided materially by loans from his private 
collection to the collection of religious ceremonials. 

Acknowledgment is also due to the officials of the exposition in 
general, and especially to Mr. (xcorge It. Davis, Director General; to 
Mr. Lyman J. Gage and Mr. AVilliam T. Baker, during their terms of 
presidency of the Board of Directors; to Mr. J. \V. Ellsworth, a mem- 
ber of the board; Mr. r)eiijamin Butterworth, the lirst secretary of the 
board, and to his successor, Mr. II. O. Edmunds; to Mr. Frank 1). Mil- 
let, director of decorations, and to Mr. W. H. Holcombe, general man- 
ager of transp(n'tation, for nniiierous courtesies. 

To the members of the Government board the statt" of the Institntion 
were indebted for many acts of courtesies. 

^Ir. ^Villianl K. Cnrtis, aschief of the Bureau of American lvei)nblics, 
and subsequently as a member of the board, was especially helpful. 



IV.— REVIE^A^ OF THE WORK OF THE SCIENTIFIC 
DEPARTMENTS, INCLUDING THEIR PARTICIPATION 
IN THE WORLD'S COLUMBIAN EXHIBITION. 

DEPARTMENT OF ART« AND INDUSTRIES. 

The Department of Arts and Industries was the immediate and 
necessary outgrowth of the erection in 1881 of the new building intended 
to receive the collections presented by foreign governments to the 
United States at the Centennial Exposition. ]\Iost of these collections 
could not with propriety be merged with any already in the custody 
of the Institution, since tliey were neither geological, biological, nor in 
a strict sense anthropological. 

This new department was therefore formed, which was intended to 
include all the collections illustrating the utilization of the earth and 
its products by man, and the history and method of arts and industries 
within historic times. At first all the anthropological collections 
except those classed as prehistoric were administered by this depart- 
ment, but experience taught that there are large classes of objects 
which can be best exhibited and studied when arranged ethnically, 
and so in 1884 the Department of Ethnology was established. 

The distinction between these two departments is not easy to define, 
and is really not very strictly observed, and will perhaps in time disap- 
pear. There are, however, certain classes of objects which either for 
effective installation or for convenience it has been found better to 
arrange with reference to form rather than race. These are as a rule 
those in which the arts of civilized man are predominant, and which 
possess some special interest when arranged in progressive, or, as they 
are sometimes in (piesti(mable propriety called, ''evolutionary" series. 
Among these are such collections as those of musical instruments, land 
transportation, the models of boats and vessels, and the fishery appli- 
ances. 

Closely allied to some of these is another group of collections, pro- 
perly technological, in which the idea of materials, and tools and i)roc- 
esses of manufacture, together with the products of the processes, are 
the most prominent. 

It was atone time intended to develop this part of the Museum to 
such an extent that every product of the earth useful to man — mineral, 
vegetal, and animal— should be shown, in its natural condition and in 
the various stages through which it may pass, in preparation by man 
for his own use, together with the tools employed and illustrations of 
processes. This project has not yet been fully realized, chiefiv through 

115 



116 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

lack of room, thoujih also because of practical difticulties of arrange- 
ment and installation. It lias not been abandoned, bowever, and the 
Museum possesses the materials for an extensive technological disi^hiy. 

In the meantime the specimens of this class derived from the min- 
eral kingdom are incorporated with the geological collections, those 
from the vegetable kingdom with the textile, materia medica, and food 
and forestry collections, besides a great mass now in storage, while 
those from the animal kingdom, with the exception of what are 
arranged Avith the textiles, medicines, foods, and fishery collections, 
are brought together in the animal products collection. 

It is still an open question whether technological material is not 
more useful and instructive, distributed among tbe scientific depart- 
ments, than set aside in a special series. At the present time, this is 
the only practicable plan. If it were x>ossible to employ a special staff 
of technological curators, trained to appreciate and to keep abreast of 
the mechanical and chemical processes of modern industrial arts and 
manufactures, and the arts of design connected with their develop- 
ment, the case would be difterent. 

When the need shall be felt for a technological museum in Washing- 
ton, one of the best in the world can be erected upon existing founda- 
tions, with comparatively slight expense and in a very short time. 

In addition to those mentioned, there are certain other collections 
which are still assigned to the Department of Arts and Industries, 
which it would be ditficult to place elsewhere — those composed of objects 
made by civilized man, in which the idea of beauty predominates over 
that of utility. Here belong porcelains, pottery, bronzes, enamels, 
lacquer, laces and tapestries, musical instruments ; in jiart, costumes and 
their accessories, and the collections illustrating the graphic arts. 

Such objects are often arranged in art museums, but may with equal 
propriety remain in contiguity with ethnological collections, with which 
they have innumerable points of contact. Indeed the separation of 
the aesthetic from the industrial and ethnical series is, in the case of 
aesthetic races like those of eastern Asia, merelj' arbitrary and a mat- 
ter of convenience. 

We value the speciuieus iu an ethuological mnsenm (writes Mr. C.F.Binns) because 
they reveal to us the mauuers and customs of a bygoue age. We regard them as steps 
in education, as stages iu the evolution of a people, but the moment that a woik can 
be judged as artistic we remove it from the Dei>artment of Ethnography and ])hice 
it upon a phvtform with the art work of all ages and all nations, to stand or fall by 
another criterion."* 

This is a fair statement of the in'actice of most museum workers. 
Whetheritisentireh' justifiable, either on scientific or a'sthetic grounds, 
or is absolutely fair and advantageous, is a difiicult question, which 
deserves full consideration.

REPORT OK ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 117 

In addition to all these, there are the collections whose interest is 
chieriy historical — personal relics, national relics, portraits, autographs, 
coins, medals, memorials of past periods in the history of our own and 
allied races. These stand in a i;roup by themselves, and are in popu- 
lar estimation more interestiuj;' than anything- else that can be shown, 
and their influence upon the people who see them is not to be under- 
valued. They are surely not without instruction, and beyond this, tend 
to the development of lofty and ennobling sentiments. 

In the report for this year, the various collections assigned to the 
Department of Arts and Industries, except those which are under the 
control of a special curator, will be referred to only in rapid review. 

Fisheries collection. — The fishery hall has been almost dismantled by 
the withdrawal of material to form part of the exhibition of the Fish 
Commission in Chicago. The attention of Capt. Collins, the curator, 
has been for two or three j'ears devoted to other things, and few addi- 
tions have been made to the collection. 

The collection of naval models. — This, too, has been drawn upon 
largely for the exhibit of the Fish Commission at the World's Fair, 
many of the models of American fishing vessels having been withdrawn 
to be combined with a large number of additional models which have 
been constructed by the Commission. The entire series will be returned 
at the close of the Exposition. 

The general collection of models is one of the most extensive in the 
world, embracing, as it does, a very large number of boats of savage 
and semicivilized races, and material for a very full exposition of the 
vessels of America. The models of modern steamships and vessels of 
war are very few, and no attempt will be made to extend the collection 
in this direction until there is more space. Three times the amount of 
exhibition room now available is desirable for the proper display of this 
collection. Among the interesting additions have been models of the 
historic ships Sally Constant and the MayHoicer, prepared by the 
National Museum for Chicago, and exhil)ited in connection witli the 
historical relics. 

The animal products collection. — This collection, already referred to 
as forming an important part of the technological material belonging 
to the ^luseum, was transported to Chicago in its entirety and was 
greatly enlarged. Much attention has been given to developing a collec- 
tion illustrating the races of domesticated aninmis, and a specially good 
series of the breeds of domestic birds has been gathered. To secure 
the domesticated mammals is a more difficult matter, attended with 
great expense and delay. Even this would have been carried much 
further in Chicagobiit for obstacles interposed by the accounting officers 
of the Treasury, who objected to the payment of v(mchers for the pur- 
chase of foreign material. 

An extensive exliibit selected from this collection was sent to Chicago. 
This exhibit is intended to illustrate the utilization of the various ])arts 



118 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

of tbe different animals and the uses of substances derived from tlie 
animal kingdom in the arts and industries. It includes the following: 

Colle<'ti()ns showing the utilization of hair, wool, bristles, etc. 

Feathers, (inills, and their uses. 

Fish scales and articles made from tluiii. 

Tortoise shell and its manufactur<'. 

Furs of various kinds. 

Collection of leathers (including a loan collection of rare leathers belonging to 

Titfany A- Co., New York). 
Horns and antlers and articles made from them. 
Hoofs and chaws. 
Teeth of various kinds and collections illustrating the uses of different kinds of 

ivory. 
Whalebone and its utilization. 
Bone and objects made from same. 
Shell, coral, and objects made from same. 
Intestines and their utilization. 

The collection of animal i)roducts is now fully equal to that in any 
other nuiseum, not excepting the Bethnal Green Museum in London, 
which grew out of the London exhibitions of 1851 and 1862, and was 
classihed and labeled under the direction of Dr. Edward Lankester, 
With proper spa^e for exhibition, extensive enough to allow the addi- 
tion of a series of the modern manufiictured i)roducts, this collection 
would have great interest and educational value. 

The collection of fibers and textiles. — This collection, which is tolera. 
bly complete, is being temporarily withdrawn from exhibition, in order 
to relieve the crowded condition of the budding. The specimens are 
all admirably mounted and well labeled, and can, if necessary, within 
a week's time, be again displayed. Like the collection of animal prod- 
ucts, it possesses much educational interest and is very attractive to 
visitors. 

The collect io7i of foods. — This collection, for whicli tliere is a great 
amonntof material on hand, has never been developed for lack of room. 
It is especially rich in the food sul)stances of the North American abo- 
rigines and of the Orient. A single group of objects from this collec- 
tion was sent to the World's Fair. This included the cases representing 
the composition of the hunuin body, the elements and chemical com- 
pounds which make up the com[)ositi()n of the man of average size, 
accomi)anie<l by supi)lementary exhibits showing a number of typical 
rations and the daily income and outgo. 

The collection of musical instruments. — V\\\<. aAWctUm lias been nearly 
doubled Avithin the past two years through the efforts of several of the 
U. S. consuls abroad and the collections made by the Assistant Secre- 
tary in southern Europe in the spring of 18<)i*. A selected exhibit w;is 
sent to the World's Fair, which occupied a wall case 05 feet in length, 
and which was intended to show the method of installation adopted in 
the Mu.seum and to illustrate the evolution of the various types of

As soon as this material shall liave been returned froniChicajio, a com- 
plete rearrangement of tlie collection will be made in the two great 
wall cases in the main entrance hall, whose combined length is 150 feet. 
This collection is one of the most extensive in the world, being espe- 
cially rich in tlie instruments of savage and semicivilized races, and the 
primitive forms, which are especially interesting when arranged by the 
progres.sive method as sliowmg the types from which, in all ]>robability, 
all of our modern instruments are derived. 

Costumes. — Especial attention was devoted in the early days of the 
Museum to the collection of costumes, especially those of historical 
interest. Such of these as have been placed on exhibition are at pres- 
ent arranged with the ethnological collection, but there are many others. 
It is probable that at the next exposition in which the (iovernmeut 
participates, a special display from this department will be arranged. 

The coUection of cer<imivs. — This collection, thougli it contains many 
valuable and important specimens, is exceedingly incomplete and 
unsatisfactory. The Hippisley collection of Chinese porcelains still 
remains on deposit, and it is hoped that through some good fortune this 
may in time become the property of the (Tovernment. It is recognized 
as one of the best for its size in existence, and is constantly examined by 
connoisseurs, who find in it material for study. There is also a small 
collection of Japanese porcelains, a selection from which was arranged 
and labeled by Mr. H. Shugio and exhibited by the Museum at the 
^\'orl(^s Fair. In this collection were shown ty]iical products of each

In addition to the oriental porcelain and pottery, there are several 
smaller gronps ot objects, the most noteworthy of which is that illns- 
trating tlie products of the imperial manufactory at Sevres, |)resented 
by the French Government. This collection is of the greatest value to 
students of the decorative arts and to a large number of other visitors 
to the Museum, and it is hoped that it may receive extensive additions 
hereafter and be arranged in a hall by itself. 

In this same connection, as occupying adjacent cases, may be men- 
tioned the very instructive special cases of Japanese lacquer, showing 
the i)rocess of nianufticture ; of Japanese bronzes; of Eussian and 
American easting in iron, and the cases of enamel and metal work 
presented by the Siamese Government. All these together form a 
nucleus which it is hoi>ed in time will develop into a collection similar 
to that which is the chief glory of the South Kensington ^Museum in 
London, and Avhich there has as yet scarcely been any eflbrt made to 
reproduce in this country, save in the art museums of Boston, New 
York, and Cincinnati, whose plans, however, arc somewhat dilferent. 

THE HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS. 

A great i)ortion of the time of Mr. A. Howard Clark, the curator, was 
necessarily devoted to his other duties as editor of the Proceedings and 
the Bulletins of the Museum, and in charge of printing descriptive 
labels, the year being the busiest in the history of the IMuseum in these 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. " 121 

biaiiclu's of work, so that it is impossible to report imicli s])ecial work 
aec(nni)lisheil in advaiicing the historical collections, except in connec- 
tion with the prei)aration of the exhibits for the World's Fair. 

The crowded condition of the exhibition halls has necessitated the 
withdrawal and temporary storage of the entire collections of medals 
and money, and the general series of autograph papers of eminent 
Americans. The collections of historical objects remaining on exhibition 
include memorials and personal relics of Washington, Jefferson, Adams, 
Van Buren, Jackson, Lincoln, Grant, and other Presidents of the United 
States, and of soldiers, statesmen, and other eminent Americans, as 
well as memorials of important events in American history. 

There have been 70 accessions to the collection during the j'ear, 
aggregating nearly 1,000 specimens. The principal objects were a folio 
Bible belonging to Gen. Washington, with his autograph on the title 
page; a large number of memorials and personal relics of President 
Andrew Jackson; autograph letters of Gen. J. E. B. Stuart, of the 
Confederate Army, and of lion. G. W. Randolph, Secretary of War 
of the Confederate States; specimens of the earliest copper money 
coined in America, dating about 152.'>; medals presented by the corpo- 
ration of the city of London, commemorative of events in the history of 
that city; commissions bearing the signatures of Presidents John 
Quincy Adams and James Madison; a large collection of engraved and 
photographic ])ortraits of eminent Americans, and a collection of the 
decorations of the military and civic orders of P^urope and America. 
It was hoped that a large historical collection might be arranged for 
the World's Fair, but it was impossible to accomplish all that was 
planned, owing to lack of exhibition space. The exhibits sent to Chi- 
cago included — 

(.1) About 1,800 engraved and photographic portraits of members of 
the Continental Congress, the Federal Convention of 1787, the first 
Congress of the United States, members of the Xational Acadenu' of 
Science, and of other eminent Americans — statesmen, jurists, philoso- 
phers. Army and Xavy officers, physicians, clergymen, educators, 
artists, authors, merchants, and philanthropists ; 

(2) Medals, nearly GOO in number, illustrative of American history 
from the earliest Colonial period through the Revolutionary war to 
events of recent years, collegiate and ecclesiastical medals, and medals 
in memory of eminent Americans : 

(3) A monographic collection of the metallic money of the colonies 
prior to the establishment of the United States Mint ; 

(•4) A monographic collection of the American colonial and Conti- 
nental paper money, and ])a]»er money issued l)y State and private 
banks and by merchants ; 

(5) A series of early maps illustrating the development of geograph- 
ical knowledge of America, and of the territorial growth of the United 
States : 



122 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

(6) A series of water-color drawings, about 200 in number, of deco- 
rate<l powder horns carried by soldiers of the American Revolution; 

(7) Models of the Sally Constant and Mai/foirrr, the first passen.tter 
ships of the Virginia and Plymouth colonies ; 

(8) Engravings illustrating the settlement of Jamestown, Va., the 
landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, and other colonial and later 
events in American history, 

THE GRAPHIC ARTS COLLECTION, 

The collections illustrating the graphic arts have continued, as hitherto, 
under the care of Mr. S. R, Koehler, who divides his time between the 
National Museum and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, where he has 
similar responsibilities. 

Nearly all the time available during the year has been devoted by him 
to supplying the specimens placed on exhibition with written labels, and 
this important task is so nearly finished that but for the Columl>ian 
Exposition it would probably have been completed by this time. That 
part of the collections which is not on exhibition is still awaiting its 
definite arrangement and classification. 

The material so far gathered is not esi>ecially available for use in 
special researches. A useful series of notes on Japanese wood-cutting 
and woodcut printing was received from INIr. Tokuno, the chief of the 
Japanese Government printing office, which has been edited by Mr. 
Koehler and printed in the Museum report for 1892. This publication, 
which is fully illustrated, is the first treatise on this most interesting 
subject, based on authentic information received from a comi)etent 
native Japanese source; it has all the value of a treatise based on 
original research. 

Some additional specimens have been placed on exhibition, Mhich 
serve to complete or better the series previously arranged, but no new 
series have been begun, jior, indeed, will this be possible, so long as 
the means and the space at command are as limited as they are at present. 

Although the accessions by gift include a number of interesting and 
instructive specimens, it is difficult to point out any of them as of special 
im^)ortance. with the excejjtion, perhaps, of an impression of Adolf 
JVIenzePs celebrate<l original lithograph, Christ among the Doctors, 
presented to the Museum by ^Ir. ,]. W. Osborne, and a fine large photo- 
gravure reproduction of Stuart's portrait of Washington, known as the 
Atheneum head, by Messrs. A. W, Elson & Co,, of Boston, The 
thirty-three [)rints by Schongauer, Diirer, (roltzius, Rembrandt, Xan- 
teuil, Wille, Bartolzzi, Walker, Mercuri, (iaillard, etc, which, together 
with a number of technical specimens, were bought for exhibition at 
the World's Columbian Exposition, at a cost of about 81,100, will of 
course add valuable material to the collections. 

The exhibit prepared by Mr. Koehler for Chicago, thougli of necessity 
small, Avas exceedingly choice and instructive. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SFX'RETARY. 123 

An adequate presentation of the subject being out of the question, 
the attempt was made to show the beginnings of the more important 
processes used in the i)n)duction of printable pictures, and to contrast 
these with the hitest achie\ements of the same processes, in tlie hope 
that, by thus phicing into juxtaposition the two ends of the line of 
develoi)ment, the advances made would become apparent at a glance. 
The whole collection was therefore to be looked upon as a tal)leau 
illustrating the condition of the multiplying arts at or al)out the time 
of the discovery of America, and the condition of the same arts in the 
nineteenth century, with added specimens of the prin('ii)al processes 
introduced in the four huiulred years intervening between these ])eriods. 

With this end in view, sixteen large frames were filled with piints, 
each frame containing on an average about six prints, and arranged as 
follows: Frame 1 contained woodcuts of the tifteenth and sixteenth 
centuries, while in frame 2, alongside of it, were shown wood engravings 
by American wood-engravers, produced within the ten or twelve years 
last past. A similar arrangement was carried out for line-engraving 
and etching, which filled, respectively, frames 3 and 4, and frames 5 and 
G. The later processes, the <n'igin or at least the general acceptance 
and development of which dates from the seventeenth and succeeding 
centuries, had to be treated even more summarily. Thus, frame 7 was 
devoted to mezzotinting; frame 8 to dry-pointing and aciuatinting; 
frame 9 to the crayon manner and stippling; frame 10 to lithography, 
and frames 11 and 12 to the various photo-mechanical processes. Frames 
13 to 10 constituted a special division, in which the attempt was made 
to give some idea of the history of color-printing. 

The curator was far from satisfied with this dis])lay, as will be sliowu 
by the following extract from his annual report, and it is not at all to 
be wondered at, since the possibilities were so great and the resources 
were so small, compared with those of any similiar collection in a Euro- 
pean capital. 1 can say from personal observation, however, that the 
collection was greatly appreciated, and not only deserved but received 
much attention, as indeed a series of specimens so well selected and 
admirably arranged and labeled could not fail to do in any exhibition at 
home or abroad. 

1 can not well omit the curators own somewhat low-spirited estimate 
of the value of his work for the Exposition, since his statement of the 
great needs and great (>i)iM)i'tuiiities in this connection may very ]>ossi- 
bly attract the attention (»f jtersons who may be interested in improv- 
ing the present condition of affairs. 

I must reiterate [writes Mr. Koeliler] my remarks upon the necessity of more iili- 
eral appropriations for the section of grapliic arts. The unfortunate consetiuenres 
growing out of tlie present condition of things made tliemselves very seriously felt 
in connection with the World's C'(dunibian Ex]tosition, and I shall therefore beg 
leave to offer a few remarks on this snlijcct. 

Among the great achievements which make the tifteeutii century one of the most 
important epochs iu the history of the human race, the develoi)ment of the reiiro- 



124 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSF>UM, 1893. 

(luctive or nmltiplyiiig arts is by no means the smallest. Like the art of printing 
books from movable type, these arts woro the outfomo of the individualistic and 
humanistic movement of the time, and like it they have been instrumental in dis- 
seminating knowledge and training the human mind in the modern way of looking 
at things — the modern "world concejition" — not only by accompanying the printed 
word by printed i)ictures in books of iustruction, but still more by scattering broad- 
cast among the people in vast numbers veritable works of art, which ministered 
to the reawakened feeling for the beauty of nature, while they quickened at the 
same time the powers of observation. It is worth noting, moreover, how closely the 
dates of importance in the first period of the history of the arts in question cluster 
around the date of the discovery of America. The first book illustrated with copper- 
plate engravings, the Monte Sancto di Dio, appeared at Florence in the year 1477; 
Martin Schonganer, the lirst truly great artist north of the Alps who was active as 
an engraver, died in the year 1491, or thereabouts; the Nurembei'g Chronicle, cele- 
brated for its many illustrations by Wolgemuth, Diirer's teacher, is dated 1493; 
Diirer's Apocalyiise, the^rst great woodcut publication ever produced, appeared in 
the year 1498, and Andrea Mantegna. the first truly great engraver south of the 
Alps, died in the year 1506. It would have seemed fitting, therefore, that in the 
picture of the world's progress since the discovery of America, which the Columbian 
Exposition was to present to its visitors, the history of the multiplying arts should 
have been illustrated quite fully. The limitations of means and space, however, 
made such an illustration impossible, and the result was an exhibition which com- 
manded no attention, and, indeed, hardly deserved any. 

Small and inadeiiuate as this exhibition was,* its usefulness was still further crip- 
pled by the impossibility of having the descriptive pamphlet printed which had been 
pre])ared, and without which the fragmentary character of the collection must neces- 
sarily have proved'puzzling, even to well-informed visitors. 

As to the specimens shown, while they were all good, and some of them, indeed, 
very fine, there were nevertheless wanting quite a number of things which ought to 
have been included, but instead of which, from dire necessity, inferior examples 
were exhibited. 

When an institution like the U. S. National Museum, the only institution of its 
kind under the care of the Government of the United States, attempts to illustrate 
the beginnings of line-engraving, of mezzotinting, of color-printing from metal 
plates, etc., it ought to be able to show the rarest and best things, — for instance, a 
specimen of the best of Schongauer's, instead of only a late impression from a Schon- 
ganer plate; a mezzotint by Von Siegen, instead of merely aWallerant Vaillant; color- 
prints by Le Blon and Debucourt, instead of things of little inii>ortance by D'Agoty 
and Jaminet, and so on to the end of the list. It is aggravating to be compelled 
to appear before the assembled delegates of the civilized nations of the world with 
such a confession of poverty, more especially when it is universally known that the 
insufficiency of the efibrts put forth is due, not to the poverty of the nation, but to 
the neglect of the representatives of the people, into whose hands has been given 
the welfare as well as the upholding of the reputation of the United States. 

What the curator has said merits serious thought, for the collections 
are uudoubtedly pitifully poor iu comparison with those of othei 
nations, and a national i)rint collection onght to be maintained in 
Washington worthy of the nation. It has. however, never been pro 
vided for, and what there is of that kind has grown np in connection 
with quite another plan, which was to illustrate fully the technology 



"^Thiswas due to the unfortunate system of printing concessions made by the 
Exposition authorities, placing all printing privileges in the hands of a single 
establishment.

of tlie .li^rapliic arts. That the ettort in this direction lias been \ery 
successful is certain, lu continuatiou of this stateiueut 1 quote a few 
sentences from tlie official report of Prof. William Roose, chief of the 
chalcog'raphieal division in the German Government i)i'intinj>- office, 
who visited \Yashin<;ton and the ^lu-seum in the course of his mission 
to the World's Fair: 

This wouderful collection iu the National Museum [writes Prof. Roose] illustrates 
the grapiiic arts Iroiu their beginnings to the developments of the present day. It 
forms the most remarkable and unique collection of its kind, and probably stands 
alone in the world. It is nut a so-called collection of engravings or of the produc- 
tions of the graphic arts in the generally accepted sense, for theem])liasis is not jdaced 
here upon the artistic value of the specimens shown. The aim is rather to illustrate 
how the graphic arts developed in the course of time, and how they are practiced at 
present. All kinds of intaglio engravings, etchings^ mezzotints, aquatint, wood- 
engraving from its earliest products to the latest newspaper cut, lithography iu all 
its varieties, the latest photo-mechanical reproductions in copper, gelatine, zinc, 
brass, etc., are shown in many hundred specimens, in all stages of development, 
and arranged in chronological series, accompanied by detailed descriptions — ])artly 
on the walls, partly in table cases — together with the plates, stones, electrotyi>es, 
etc., needed for their elucidation. The purpose here is to exhil>it the technical, 
and to show how man managed to make pictures multipliable, wliat means he has 
thought out and used with this aim in view, from the l)eginniug down to our own 
day. An original, one-sided, genuinely American, but certainly also a practical 
and sensible idea. 

TnE MATERIA MEDICA COLLECTION. 

The work of this section, which is now under the care of Medical 
Inspector C. H. White, U. S. Xavy, has been confined to the preserv^a- 
tiou of the collection in its present form and in the preparation of such 
new specimens as were fouiul desirable for exhibition. The collection 
is in excellent condition for study, and the exhibition series is admira- 
bly installed, the greater part of it bein^ a most admiiable display iu 
tlie held of economic botany. 

The collection is so comi)lete that novel additions are few. 

DE PARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY, 

The ethnological collections are at present understood to include all 
objects illustrating the history and activities of mankind, save those 
classed as prehistoric and those which are assigned to the Department 
of Arts and Industries. The division is somewhat arbitrary, and there 
are of necessity constant changes of material, as the needs of the exhi- 
bition series show them to be necessary. 

The ethnological collections are particularly complete for North 
America, but as years go by, through exchange and gift, they are 
becoming fairly representative of the whole world. The Xorth Amer- 
ican collections are especially rich iu respect to the Eskimo stock, the 
stocks of the Northwest coast, the Shoshoneau tribes of the Great Inte- 
rior Basin, the buffalo-hunting tribes of the stocks alonu' the Phiins 



126 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

ofthe West, and those of the Puebh) re;L;iou of the southwest, which 
have beeu so thoroughly explored by the Bureau of P^thuology uuder 
the direction of ^laj. J. W. Powell. 

Perhaps no portion of tlie Museum is so cramped by lack of space as 
this. The material already luouuted and labeled for exhibition would 
fill five times the space which can now be assigned to it, and if installed 
in rooms of sufticient capacity, would form one of the most instructive 
and impressive ethnological collections in the world. At i)resent, how- 
ever, only a small portion of this treasure can be shown, and the result 
IS far from satisfactory, since the effective display of such objects 
depends largely upon the manner in which they are arranged with 
reference to one another and to some great ruling concept, a result 
which can only be accomplished in halls of ample dimensions. 

The curator of the ethnological collection, Prof. O. T. Mason, has for 
a number of years been bringing these vast materials under control, 
so that any object with its full history can be consulted without delay, 
a most ingenious system of storage, indexed by a card (;atalogue ren- 
dering the material available for the use of investigators. At the same 
time the material is at once ready for any new steps in the develop- 
ment of the exhibition series, and were space available, in a few weeks 
the entire collection could be jilaced before the public. If this could 
be once accomplished, the result, I am satisfied, would astonish those 
who are most familiar with the resources of the Museum in this field. 

During the past year the entire time of the curator has beeu devoted 
to the World's Fair to the exclusion of any new Museum enterprises. 
The usual routine of receiving new material and caring for the gen- 
eral collection has gone on, but no new specimens have been put on 
exhibition in the Museum. The number of specimens received during 
the year was 5,004, and 3,161 entries were made in the departmental 
catalogue. 

As has already been said, the participation of the Museum in expo- 
sitions is a detriment to its scientific work. A certain compensation 
is found, however, in the opportunity to instruct the public by an 
exhibit systematically arranged and labeled, and in the increase to the 
collections. 

In arranging for the ethnological and archa'ological portion of the 
exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition it was decided that the 
efibrts of this Department should be combined with those of the 
Bureau of Ethnology, which is another branch of tlie Smithsonian 
Institution, and which has already been so closely connected witli the 
Museuni in its activities that it is impossible to separate the interests 
of the two. In developing the plans for the Exposition, many projects 
were discussed, and, but for the fact that a general ethnological display 
had been arranged for under the direct control of the World's Colum- 
bian Exposition, a more comi)reliensive anthropological collection 
would liave been prepared. It being the first object, however, to avoid 



REPORT OK ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 127 

rivalry and (lupli(!atioii, and to contribute so far as jtossihic to the .yon- 
eral success of the fair, the scope of the National .Museum exhibit was 
limited to North .Vmerica. 

Ill order to bring into sharp comparison the concepts of race, speech, 
and activities among the American aborigines, it was ])roposed by 
Prof. Mason that a special exhibit of arts and intlustries by linguistic 
stocks should be the main feature, and that this should l)e founded on 
the great linguistic map of North America, just then ])ublished by the 
Director of the Bureau of Ethnology, as the crowning result of ethno- 
logical labors on our continiMit during fifty years. 

The details of this plan are quoted in the words of Prof. Mason, in 
the discussion of the labors of the Department of Ethnology. In this 
connection the staff of the ^Museum and Bureau of Ethnology cooper- 
ated — Prof. Mason representing the Museum and Mr. H. W. Henshaw 
the Bureau of Ethnology. This cooperation was interrupted for sev- 
eral months by ]\Ir. Henshaw's absence from the city, but a month 
before the opening of the exhibit Prof. W. II. Holmes was assigned 
by Maj. Powell to represent the interest of the Bureau of Ethnology, 
and by him most efficient services were rendered, not only in preparing 
illustrations of his own remarkable investigations, but in advising and 
directing the x)reparators in arranging groups of costumed figures, etc. 
In this work Mr. Frank H. Cushing, through his familiarity with the 
customs and arts of the Pueblo people, rendered also most valuable 
services. Mr. James Mooney also participated, and the group of Kiowa 
children, prepared under his direction, was among the most attractive 
of them all. But for his absence in the field, collecting material, he 
would have been able to devise others of similar excellence. Dr. W. J. 
Hoffman superintended the preparation of groups of Northern Indians. 

As has been stated, the plan upon which the combined exhibitions 
of the Bureau of Ethnology and of the National Museum were arranged, 
was developed by Prof, ^lason, who describes in the foHowing words 
its principal characteristics: 

The plan of setting up the products of aboriginal art in accordance with the lin- 
guistic chart .just published l)y the Bureau of Etlmology was carried out so far as 
the material would admit. Some of the stocks have disappeared altogether, and it 
would be impossible to give a picture of their arts. Others are reduced to such 
small numbers, and they are living now under such euforceil circumstances, that it 
would l)e of little use to attempt to reproduce their primitive mode of life. 

There are certain great stocks and groups of stocks, however, that are yet to be 
found in respectable numbers, and they were formerly spread out over vast areas, 
which iu themselves constitute culture-regions. The stocks selected for represen- 
tation at the Exposition were those which had developed unique types of culture; 
for example, the Eskimo for the Arctic area; the Koloschan, Wakashau, Haeltzukau, 
and Salishan stocks dwelling in the archipelagos and on the mainland of the north- 
west coast of America; the Athapascan stock, dwelling in three extremely diti'erent 
culture areas, to wit: iu northwest Canada and Alaska; iu northern California, 
and in New Mexico and Arizona; the Algonkiau stock, whose trilies once covered 
the entire region of northern and eastern North America, bounded on the south by 
southern Tennessee and ou the west by the 117th meridian; the Irocjuoian stock, sur-

rounding the Great Lakes; the Siouau stock, on the Missouri drainage; the Kiowan 
stock, forming au intrusion from unknown source into the buffalo region of the 
plains; the Shoshonean stock, covering the great interior basin and related to the 
Aztecs of Mexico; the tribes of California occupying the acorn and pinon and bas- 
ket-making area; the Piman and Yumau stocks about the Colorado mouth; the 
Pueblo peoples in Arizona and New Mexico. These stocks enable the student to 
exauiiue the relations that may exist between geography, ethnology, glossography, 
and technography. All technical and biological regions are covered by this arrange- 
ment, and all of the leading nationalities and tongues, and all of the characteristic 
Indian arts are also represented. 

The result of this study is most interesting. In the supply of natural wants, the 
various tribes have yielded to regional or geographic forces. This is well shown, 
both in the plains of the great West and in the southern desert, and, indeed, 
throughout the continent, as api)ears in comnariug Powell's map with Dr. Mer- 
riam's bio-geographic map, published by the Department of Agriculture. Along the 
eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains were formerly to be found Algonkian, 8iouan, 
Kiowan, and Shoshonean tribes. Their languages were radically different. Their 
tribal organizations, similar in plan, were still entirely unlike in their totemic sys- 
tems. But the all absorbing occupation of buffalo hunting, combined with the 
limitations of vegetal and mineral material, determined the diet, the dress, the house, 
the tools, and the ])roducts of industry. That is, the materialistic activities were 
controlled bj' the environment. 

SuperaiMed to this series of effects, as anyone could see at the Exposition, were 
others of a more refined nature. The spiritualistic, metaphysical expressions in 
these same specimens were overwhelmingly ethnical and linguistic. The arrow for 
killing a buffalo must be of a certain material and form; nature determined that. 
But the feathering, the streaking, the symbolism on thearrow, were distinct for each 
tribe and tongue. The buffalo or bearskin robe was nature's gift to all, and it was 
cured after the same general fashion. But the paintings were national, totemic, 
special, almost independent of the environment. 

The Pueblo region teaches some interesting lessons in these same particulars. 
Here are gathered also four stocks, the Shoshonean, the Tanoan, the Tewan, and the 
Zufiian, differing essentially in language and totemic system and mythology. But 
there are only certain articles of food to be had here naturally; the country lends 
itself kindly to the cultivation of corn, beans, and pumpkins. The peculiar geolog- 
ical formation, furnishing stone and adobe mud in abundance, almost forl);ide the 
erection of other than one style of house, the pueblo. Clay of the tinest (luality 
every where invited to the creation of pottery. As for textiles, the curious i)henom- 
euon is presented of tribes preserving their old arts in new areas. This reuuirk 
may be supplemented by the observation that the bringing of sheep to this region 
by Spanish missionaries stimulated the trade of frame and loom weaving in all the 
linguistic stocks alike. 

By the method of study pursued in this exhibit in Chicago, the lessons inculcated 
by other stocks are emphasized. For instance, while the Moki or Hopi Pueblos of 
northeastern Arizona are tenanted by Shoshonean tribes, the Utes, the Shoshones, 
the Bannacks, and even the Couianches, are of the same linguistic family. Now, 
in one of these is presented a buffalo-hunting people, in another an Indian of the 
woods, in a third the man of the desert, Avith corresponding occupati(tns. The coun- 
try has endowed and suggested the trades in each case. In one of the Hoju pueblos, 
furthermore, two styles of basketry are to be seen that are unknown among the 
other Shoshonean tril)es. One of them, the coiled ware, resembled in technique, 
but not in material, that of the wild Apaches or the southern Californians. The 
other is a wicker type, really unknown among other tribes hereabout but commoa 
everywhere in North America east of the Mississippi. It is impossible to bring out 
all the minor lessons taught in this first attempt ever made to briug the concepts of

tribe, language, and iiidiistiy into tln' same liiu- of cotniiaiatixc study tlirougli serie,s 
of objerts. 

The following is a concise descri]>tioii of the exhibits. Tlie ])lan was to svt apart 
:i definite space or alcove for each linguistic family or stock, to place in the center 
of each a group of lay figures of men and women or children, dressed in proper cos- 
tume and engaged in typical occupations. About this gronj), in wall cases and 
screens, would be assembled as many examples of the handiwork of that people as 
possible. Especial attention was given to selecting such arts as were <iuite charac- 
teristic and distinctive in each case. 

It is much to be regretted that the contracted space allowed in tlie Government 
building at Chicago prevented the curator from giving to the idea its fullest expan- 
sion. Enough was disi>laycd. however, to bring into prominence the statement that 
the eartli, witli its climate and natural resources, has much to say about the material 
and the form of human industries. Blood and language and social life anil religion 
have their say also in tlie arts of lile, but their influence is superacUled, and not fun- 
damental. 

lu the development of this i'olleetion,iu aceordanee with tiiese phtiis, 
Prof. Mason was engaged for nearly three years, and a large amount 
of ett'ort, which under other eircnmstances would have appeared in the 
form of contribution.s to the literature of ethnology, was devoted to the 
preparation of the descriptive labels and the educational material to be 
exhibited. In this work most etfective assistance was rendered by 
various members of the lUireau of Ethnology and the ^Museum staff. 
Mr. James Moouey spent several months among the Moqui Indians of 
Arizona, and Kiowas of Indian Territory, and while in the held was 
also instrumental in obtaining the Voth collection from the Cheyenne 
and Arapahoes. The collections sent in embraced over one thousand 
objects. Dr. W. J. Henshaw also collected among the Crow Indians, and 
obtained among other things some very beautiful costumes, especially 
the dress and outtit of a Crow warrior. Mr. ITenshaw while in Cali- 
fornia obtained an im])ortant collection of basketry and other objects 
of the Californian tribes. 

Another interesting and important outgrowth of tlu^ work of this 
department was the result of the curator's esi)ecial interest in the work 
of woman in savagery, or woman's share in i)riniitive industry. This 
subject was discussed by him in the lecture entitled •• Woman's Share in 
Primitive Culture/' delivered by him in the National ^Inscum Satur- 
day lecture course in 1888. The attention of many intelligent women 
was thus attracted to the subject, and at the special invitation of the 
Board of Lady Managers, and in accordance with the special resolu- 
tion of Congress, an exhibit of woman's industries was prepared aiul 
installed in theWoman's building. The idea Avhicli this collection was 
intended to illustrate is described as follows: 

The motive of this exhibit was to show woman's work in savagery, or woman's 
share in primitive industries. Reviewing Mr. Spencer's division of tlie course of 
history into an age of militancy and an age of industrialism, it occurred to tlie 
curator that this should rather be a sexual classification. This would give a sex 
of militancy, which is masculine, and a sex of industrialism, which is feminine. 
This is very clearly proveil by this exhibit. The highest classific concept would be

craft or trade — for «5xaiiii»le, the harvester, the miller, the cook, the tanner, the 
potter, tiie \vea\er, uud so on. Under each of these heads, by a collection of speci- 
meus, it was shown what women from every savage area are capable of doing. The 
division Avas lirst technic and tiien ctliiiic. The wh<de title of the exhibit would 
read, " What women of savagery in each trade could do, and how these works 
appeared Avhen compared ethnically. " 

Eeference has already been made to the participation of the Siuitb- 
sonian Tiistitutioii in tlie Colnrnbijin Historical Exposition at Madrid, 
and to the fact that the larger portion of the material was lent from 
the National Museum. 

As a matter of foct, most of the matter sent from the Museum was 
selected from the exhibits already prepared, mounted, and labeled for 
the World's Fair in Chicago, and but for the elaborate preparations 
which had already been made, it would have been impossible for the 
United States upon so short a notice to have made so creditable a 
showing- upon this most important anniversary. It was a matter of 
much regret that the pressure of the preparation of the exhibit for 
Chicago was so great that Prof. Mason could not accompany the col 
lection to Madrid, as it represented so much of his individual activity, 
especially since he had been identitied from the beginuing with the 
committee of organization, which was appointed by the Spanish min- 
ister in Washington, and which had already done much to excite pub- 
lic interest in this occasion. I lis assistant. Dr. Walter Hough, was 
attached to the American commission, and was charged with the instal 
lation of the material from this department, as well as with the prepa- 
ration of the Spanish catalogue, an English translation of which will 
appear in the forthcoming report of the Madrid Exposition. This cata- 
logue embodies the descriptive labels of a large portion of the collec- 
tion which was sent to Cliicago, and which will in time be utilized in 
the preparation of various memoirs illustrative of the Exi)osition mate- 
rial in the Museum. 

Although allnsi(m has been made to the Museum staff of preparators 
in connection with the Chicago exhibit, it seems only proi)er to refer 
here to the admirable work of those especially attached to the ethno- 
logical collections, notably Mr. Carl liergman, in the mounting and 
costuming of groups of tigures, and Mr. Thomas W, Sweeny in arranging 
and labeling the cases containing the comparative collections. Mr. 
Theodore A. Mills and Mr. Dunbar rendered excellent services in the 
modeling and casting of the bodies, heads, and limbs of the figures in 
groups. 

All the activities of the department were so absorbed by the work 
which has just been described, that this and the preceding year's work 
upon i)apers and monographs upon tne collection was to a large degree 
interrupted. A paper upon " The Ulu, or Woman's Knife of tiie 
Eskimo,'' by the curator, in the Keport of the Smithsonian Institution, 
appeared during the year.* This i):iper was prepared especially for

arcliteologists, to enable them to uiKlerstaiid the fuiKitioiis ofinaiiy stone 
iuipleiiients in tlieir eabinets. 

An address was also delivered by him on "The Land Problem" before 
the Brooklyn Ethnological Society. During the year also appeared 
Mr. Houjuh's "Catalogue of the Bernadou, Allen, and Jouy Korean 
Collections iu the National Museum/'* and also by the same studeut 
a paper ou time-keeping by lighting and fire, and another upon the 
method of fire making. ^Fr. J. D. ^NIcGuire's paper on the "Stone 
Hammer" was also written in connection with the Department of Eth- 
nology and was prepared in the Museum. In this same connection 
should be mentioned the essay by Surg. Washington Matthews, U. S. 
Army, on the (Jatlin collection of Indian paintings in the National 
Museum.t Mr. McGruire also prepared a series of objects for the 
World's Fair to illustrate the processes employed by the North Amer- 
ican Indian in working stone, by battering, boring, sawing, chip- 
ping, grinding, and polishing. 

A series of these objects, together with the apparatus used, was 
disjdayed at the Exposition, and an exact account given of the time and 
method used in the preparation of each one on an accompanying label. 
The case containing this collection occupied a ])romineut aisle in the 
Smithsonian space, and attracted much attention, not only from Ameri- 
cans, but also from Europeans. 

The most important accessions of American material have been, as 
usual, through the Bureau of Ethnology, including especially the val- 
uable collection made in connection with the Exposition by Messrs. 
Henshaw, Mooney, and Dr. Hottman. Mrs. M. M. Hazen deposited an 
exceedingly important collection of objects from the Sioux and Eskimo 
tribes, collected by her late husband, and from Lieut. W. E. Saftbrd 
was obtained a most important collection of paintings of I'eru by a 
native artist, as well as a large collection of dress and native material, 
including the very handsome feather costume, which is mounted upon 
the single figure of a Xivaro Indian. This was one of the most beau- 
tiful of the costumed figures shown in Chicago. The ^Museum obtained 
by purchase the ethnological collection procured by Lieut. Cook during 
his military services in the West; from Mr. Edward Palmer, a small 
collection from the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico, and from the heirs 
of Mr. J. Henry Turner, some interesting objects collected on the Upper 
Yukon, Alaska. Of special interest in this connection, was a wampum 
belt obtained from Mr. William Thompson, and said to belong to the 
great Shawnee chief, Tecumseh. 

A small African collection was received from Mr. William Aster C hau- 
ler, the result of his explorations in the eastern part of the continent, 
and others were obtained for the National Museum at Loanda by Mr. 
Heli Chatelain, and by Mr. Carl Steckelman, from Mayumba.

132 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Dr. W. L, Abbott, whose magnificent contribution.s to the Museum 
are referred to elsewhere, sent au important colleetion of objects from 
Bombay. Erhard Bissinger, esq., U. S. consul at Beirut, Syria, sent a 
collection of Syrian games of chance. 

Hon. W. W. Rockhill, Third Assistant Secretary of State, has placed 
at the disposition of the .^luseuni a large and exceedingly importautcol- 
lection illustrative of the arts and customs of Tibet, which was obtained 
by him in his two journeys in the interior, and which is to be the sub- 
ject of au illustrated catalogue to be published in the present report of 
the Museum. At Hoihow, China, Dr. Julius Neumaun continued his 
friendly cooperation by sending additional illustrations of the native 
arts of northern China. 

Polynesian collections were sent by Rounsevelle Wildmau, esq., U. S. 
consul at Singapore, who made special collections under the direction 
ofthe]Museum. Alexander B. Webb, esq., U. S. cousul at Mauila, sent 
by request a collection from the Philippines, including a very excellent 
series of games. Victor A. Jenny, esq., U. S. consular agent at Macassar, 
secured specimens illustrating the arts of Xew Cxuinea, while our old 
and valued correspondent. Prof. H. H. (riglioli, sent in exchange an 
important collection from the Andaman Islands, including over 100 
objects. 

I'KEHISTOHIC ANTHKOPOKOCY. 

The hall containing this collection is the largest and most impress- 
ive in the Museum, and, owing to the extent and value of the material, 
chiefly in American arclneology, it is one of the most noteworthy 
features of the establishment. Since the death of Dr. Charles Ran in 
1887, by whom the collection was organized and first arranged, it has 
been under the charge of Dr. Thomas Wilson, who has increased it by 
the dei)osit of his own cabinet of European material. 

The number of specimens at the end of the year is reported by the 
curator at 140,182, 1,104 having been added during the month of June. 

Under the administration of the present curator many changes have 
been made, especially in the fundamental plan of classification. The 
collection is at present arranged in two series. The general principles 
adopted ai)ply more to prehistoric objects from the Old World and are 
those of foreign arch;eologists. It has been deemed unwise by the 
curator to attempt any definite classification of the culture of antiquity 
in the T'nited States more than to put it generally into the neolithic 
period. 

1. A synoptical series, with reference to prehistoric man, assembling 
objects believed to have been employed during each given ei)och of 
early civilization. These epochs are then arranged in series, begin- 
ning with the earliest forms and continuing dowu to historic times. 

2. (xcographical series, in which the greater portion of the collection 
is arranged with reference to political subdivisions. The objects from 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 133 

the provinces of Cuuada, tlie various States of the United States, ami 
the Latin Republics are brought together. 

In this department, also, much of the energy of the year has been 
devoted to preparing collections for expositions. The curator was 
attached to the statf of the United States Commission at the Historical 
American Exposition at Madrid from August, 1802, until December, 
when he was unexpectedly called upon to return. 

The exhibit prepared under his supervision for the ^\"orld*s Fair 
was shown also at Madrid, and is explained at length in the special 
paper to be included in the report of the American (.'ominission. It 
is described in brief in the following statement from the pen of the 
antlior: 

The exhibit of this departmeut at Madrid comprised 2,500 prehistoric objects, 
which were displayed in 19 douljle slope-top cases iu the main hall assigned to the 
United States. The exhibit at Chicago comi)rised 1.250 specimens, arranged in 7 
flat-top cases in an alcove belonging to the space assigned to the V. S. National 
Mnseum. The general arrangement of objects iu these two expositions was much 
the same; that is, it was both chronological and according to function. The 
implements aud objects belonging to the earliest period showing human occupation 
were arranged in the first cases, and consisted principally of those belonging to 
that which is in England called the Alluvial or Drift Period; in France, the 
Chelleau Epoch of the Paleolithic Period. The various epochs of the Paleolithic 
Age were represented by implements from northern and southern England; from 
all parts of France; from Italy, Spain, and Portugal; from Egypt, by a loan display 
from Prof. H. W. Haynes, of Boston; and from Hindostan, Asia. There were casts 
of several prehistoric skulls from Europe — the Neanderthal, Olmo, Laugerie Basse 
and Engis. 

Implements similar iu form, style, and manufacture to. those of the Paleolithic 
Age of European countries were shown as coming from the United States, which 
objects, if found in Europe, would be undoubtedly accepted as paleolithic. The 
investigations in this respect in the United States of America have not been so pro- 
found as in Europe, and anthropologists are not unanimous concerning the conclu- 
sions to be drawn therefrom. There were shown a fossil human thorax and a fossil 
human skull aud thigh-bone, the two latter changed to limonite, all from Florida, 
found by Judge John G. Webb; a fossil i)yrula shell, beariugthe prehistoric engrav- 
ing of a mammoth; implements from the auriferous gravels under Table Mountain, 
California; others from the Walker River Canyon, in the extinct Quarternary Lake 
Lahontan, Utah; still others from Fossil Lake, Oregon. These were followed by 
prehistoric objects of the Neolithic or Polished Stone Age, those from Europe having 
precedence. England, France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Swe- 
den, Norway, Russia, the Island of Crete, .Japan, aud Cambodia were all represented. 
The implements from these countries were much the same as those from the United 
States. 

In the display made from the United States every .State and Territory was repre- 
sented by objects belonging to prehistoric man — polished stone hatchets, grooved 
axes and drille<l axes, arranged in series .according to form, style, and size; stone 
mauls, adzes, gouges, some from the West Indies of shell ; extensive series of caches 
of leaf-shaped aud other stone implements, priucipally from Pennsylvania and Ohio, 
though some were from Tennessee and Arkansas; a full series of implements from 
the quarries and workshops of Flint Ri<lge, Licking County. Ohio; scrapers, of all 
kinils; arrow- and spear-heads .arranged iu the latest classification, leaf-shaped, 
triangular, and stemuicd, ami those of peculiar form: large flint disks; ceremonial

the West Indies; jade, tuniuoise, rock crystal from Alaska, Mexico, Central and 
South America; obsidian from California and Mexico; gold objects and ornaments 
from Chiriqui and Antioquia, Central and South America; plaster models of aborig- 
inal towns and monuments helonging to Indian tribes; and, for purposes of com- 
parison, numerous objects from the modern North American Indians were shown 
in the glass case, duly labeled with the tribe, locality, and special point of com- 
parison indicated. 

The collection was arranged in groups, so that a single label would comprise as 
many objects as possible. The labels were prepared with care, printed on herbarium 
board, aud displayed with the objects so as to be easily read by the pul)lic. 
The collection was described in the official catalogue as follows : 
The exhibit under this head deals with man before the dawn of history, aud com- 
prises implements, iiteusils, and other objects found in different parts of the world, 
and recognized as his handiwork. 

OIUECTS OF THK PALEOUTHIC OI{ (IIIl'I'KI) STONE AGE.

In connection with the Exposition woik, Mrs. Wilson's ])rivat(' col- 
lectiou of hices, mounted, and with an elaborate series of descriptive 
labels, was placed in the Woman's building. 

An interestinii' and valuable collection of prehistoric antiipiitics com- 
prising 178 objects was given b}' Mrs. Schliemann on behalf of her 
husband, lately deceased. They were gatliered by the celebrated 
explorer during his excavations on the hill of Hissarlik and came from 
the buried cities on the site of Ancient Troy. 

The curator continued his duties as editor of the dei)artment of 
anthropology in the -'American Xaturalist" and also published a i>aper 
upon "Anthropology at the Paris Exj)osition in 1889." In addition to 
the routine work already described, the preparation of a series of casts 
of typical i)rehistoric stone implements for distribution to colleges and 
museums has been continued. 

THE COLLECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQl'ITIES. 

This collection is an outgrowth of the Department of Ethnology and 
was established in 1888 under the honorary curatorship of Dr. Paul 
Haupt, professor of Semitic studies in Johns Hopkins University, 
chietiy for the purpose of calling attention to the fact that the Kational 
Museum was ready to receive and care for objects obtained by archse- 
ological exploring expeditions in the East, and also to meet the con- 
stant demand from visitors for collections corresponding to those 
known iu London as of Biblical arch;eology. 

Owing in part to lack of space, the specimens have not been a very 
serviceable study collection. Special attention was given to the 
making up of a study series of casts of Assyrian and Babylonian 
seals, of which a large number were found to be in j)rivate possession 
of this country. It is hoped that in time this series will include a com- 
plete representation of every seal in America, and that this material 
of such importance for purposes of research will be elaborate enough 
to render it available for comparative study. 

Owing in part to lack of space and still more to the fact that it is so 
difficult to obtain genuine material, the growth of this collection has 
been very slow, but it still occupies a ])rominent place in the Museum, 
and every efibrt will be made for its improvement. 

A number of objects have recently been withdrawn from this series 
to form a portion of the collection of religious ceremonials which was 
prepared as a special feature for the World's Fair under the charge of 
Dr. Cyrus Adler, assistant curator of this dci)artment. 

Among the most important recent accessions arc two squeezes of 
ancient tablets at Persepolis, brought home by the Hon. Truxton Beale, 
from which have been made the beautiful plaster casts tigured and 
described by Dr. Adler in another ])art of this rci)ort. 

Another collection received during the year, which seems to deserve 
si)ecial remark iu this place, is referred to in a statement ])reparcd by 
the custodian of the collection : 



136 KEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

The most notable and welcome collection wiis obtained thr<mgh the kindness of 
Miss Olive Kislt^y .Seward, of Wasbington, wlio placed on deposit in the Mnseum an 
interest injj collection of Cypriote and Plnenician objects. Aside from their intrinsic 
value these ol)jccts have a historical value, in that they were ac(|uired at the actual 
scene of the excavation. 

THE COLI.KCTION OF HKMCilOUS CEHEMoNIAI, OIUECTS. 

Since 1889, objects of religious ceremonial have been exhibited in 
connection with the collection of Oriental antiquities, A beginning 
was made by the formation of an exhibit to illustrate the Jewish 
religion, but the scoi)e has since l)een widened and may in the future- 
include tlie lower ty[)es of religion, with the exception perhaps of those 
which it Mould be diflicult to illustrate by the separation of material 
from the general ethnological sei-ies. 

The idea of a collection of this kind was first taken up in this coun- 
try by the National Museum, and a proposal is made in regard to it in 
the Museum re])orts for 1881 and 1880. 

In 189L* a similar project was tak(Mi up by the rniversity of Penn- 
sylvania, and an admirable loan exhibition was prei)ared under the 
direction of Mr. Stewart Culin. 

In the " IJiblical World" for January, 1893, the following allusion is 
made to the subject: 

An important and indeed indispensable adjunct to the study of religions is the 
Mnseum, which in its ideal form should represent a tableau of the course taken by 
religious rites m their development. Credit is due to the V. S. National Museum for 
having taken the initiatory steps in this direction. In his report for 188!),* the Sec- 
retary of the Smithsonian Institution called attention to the importance of collec- 
tions of articles of worship, and since that time an excellent beginning has been 
made in the departments of American and Oriental antiquities. Messrs. Fewkea, 
Adler, and Kockhill have been instrumental in advancing the section of comjjarative 
religions in the National Museum and with the admirable facilities possessed by a 
Government institution for obtaining objects from all parts of the world, the scope 
of this section ought at an early day to be made coequal with the universe. At 
the University of Pennsylvania, also, the place of the Museum as the laboratory for 
study of religions was emphasized by a special loan exhibition of objects used in 
religious worship, which was opened last spring. The catalogue, which is of the 
entire exhibition, is due to the energetic and well-directed etforts of Mr. Stewart 
<Julin, the director of the University museums, and is an admirable piece of work, 
distinguished for its method, clearness, and accuracy. The exhibitiou, embracing 
Egypt, India, China, .Japan, America, and Mohammedanism, is noteworthy as the 
first of the kind in the country. 

The history of the collection has been epitomized in a paper prepared 
I)y Dr. Adler for the Anthropological Congress in Chicago, a revision 
of wdiich is printed in Part ii of this lleport. 

The special exhibit shown in Chicago is limited to a selection from 
the religions of the nations iidiabiting the Mediterranean basin, with 
special regard to the ceremonies, as forming the starting point for a 
comparative study of religious. 



'The plan was first announced in the Report of the Assistant Secretary for 1881.

Tin: ( OI.I.KCTION OF AMEKICAN AHOKKilNAL POTTERY. 

This colloction, a portion of wiiich would seoin to belong' to tliat of 
prehistoric antliro])olo<iy, has grown up under the direction of I'rof. W. 
H. Holmes, of the Bureau of Ethnology, and in connection Avith his 
studies of American art in clay. It is arranged in one of the central 
courts of the Museum building by tribes and regions, including not 
only the magnificent series of Pueblo objects obtained by the Bureau 
of Ethnology, but also the general collection from the mounds of the 
Mississippi Valley and from the burial cemeteries of Central and South 
America, and forming one of the most impressive exhibitions of the 
kind ever brought together. 

The series of vessels to represent the art of the Pueblo tribes was 
sent to the World's Fair They were grouped and arranged with life- 
size figures representing Zuni women making and decorating pottery, 
executed by Mr. F. H. Gushing. Mr. Holmes also prepared for the 
World's Fair illustrations of his other investigations upon the quarry- 
ing and stone industries of the Indians. 

The collections shown in Chicago illustrate the (piarrying of stone 
bji the aborigines of the United States, for utensils, pipes, ornaments, 
etc. ; the manufacture of stone implements from Hint, chert, novaculite, 
quartzite, and rhyolite; and the mining of coi)per and mica. 

Exhibit illustrating the ancient quarrying of quartzite bowlders (and the manu- 
facture of implements from them) on Piney Brancli, District of Columbia; 
including a series of specimens, showing processes and progressive steps of manu- 
facture; and photographs, drawings, and maps representing the site and nature 
of the aboriginal operations and the method of exploration. 

A group of exhibits illustrating by means of specimens, map>*, photographs, etc., 
the quarrying and manufacture of chert in Indian Territory, together with a 
mass of quarry refuse. 

Exhibits representing the novaculite quarries of (iarhand County, Ark., including a 
series of hanuner-stones. 

Exhibits rci)re8cnting the Hint (luarrics of Flint Ridge. Licking County, Ohio, and 
the manufacture of knives, spears, and arrow-heads. 

An exhibit representing the quarrying and shaping of rhyolite by the ancient 
inhabitants of Pennsylvania. 

Specimens illustrating the use of tiint nodules in implement-making by tribes of 
Texas.

Costumed figures — two negro workmen engaged in breaking up and flaking flint. 

The accessions of the year include a large number of entries, the most 
important being that of a series of ancient pueblo vases purchased from 
Mr. H. Hales, of New Jersey, to form a part of the department exhibit 
of aboriginal ceramics at the Columbian I^xposition. Small collections, 
mostly shreds only, have been made by Mr. Ccrard Fowke and Mr.

Williiim Diinviddio, of the Bni'e:m of Ethnology in Virginia and Mary- 
land, and Mr. 0. Mindelelf and Mr. James Mooiiey, of the same lUireau 
have added to the collections of aucieut and modern pueblo ware from 
Arizona. Donations have been received from Messrs. Thomas Dow- 
hug, W. II. Phillips, W. L. Abbott, C. Steckelniaii, E. A. Mearns, 
Thomas Lee, S. L. Frey, J. A. Maxwell, P. L. Jouy, and Miss E. Mayer. 
The important collection of ancient pueblo pottery madeby Mr. Thomas 
Keam, of Arizona, which has for a number of years been exhibited as 
a loan, was purchased by ^Nlrs. Mary Hemenway, of Boston. 

DEl'ARTMKNT OF MAMMA1.S. 

Very little regular work was done in the department during the 
year, owing to the work for the Columbian Exposition, and the detail 
of Mr. True, the curator, for general executive work of the Museum. 

In preparing plans of this exhibit two considerations were kept in 
mind: First, that the Exposition commemorated the discovery of 
America, and hence that the exhibit ought, as far as possible, to be 
American in character; and, secondly, that as the general display of 
the Museum was intended to furnish an indication of the difi'erent 
branches of its exhibition-work, it was desirable to show, as far as pos- 
sible, the several classes of such M^ork in which the department was 
regularly engaged. 

It was first i^roposed that a prominent feature of the exhibit should 
be a complete series of mounted skins of ISTorth American mammals, 
including every species, and also every variety that had received a 
distinctive name. It was intended that this exhibit should be a com- 
plete rei)resentation of the mammal fauna of the country, and at the 
same time should show the character and quality of the taxidermie 
work done by the department. To bring into stronger relief certain of 
the characteristic mammals of America, it was proposed, in addition, 
to exhibit groups of specimens, with accessories indicating natural sur- 
roundings. It was thought that these groups would also add to the 
attractiveness of the exhibit, and bring into view another branch of the 
taxidermie work of the Museum. 

At a later date, in order to enhance the interest of the exhibit, it was 
proposed to include a representation of some of the characteristic mam- 
mals of Central and South America, or possibly the genera complete. 

Finally, however, when the details of the allotment of space in the 
Government building became known, the idan underwent considerable 
modification. 

The complete rei)resentation of species of North American luammals 
was then abandoued in favor of a display of all the American families, 
by genera, as a part of a general series of American animals, arranged 
on the same plan. Thus the exliibit, as finally installed, consisted of — 

1. A series of single mounted skins, representing the families of 
American mammals, by genera. 



140 REPORT OF NATIONAL ISIl'SEUM, 1893. 

2. A series of groups of cbaracteiistic Xortli American inammals, 
each confined to a single species, and consisting of several specimens 
(adult males and females, and young of both sexes, in most instances), 
accompanied by accessoi-ies, indicating tlie surroundings and habits 
of the species in a state of nature. 

It is unnecessary in tins connection to give a detailed list of the genera 
included in tlic family series, as, Avith no great number of exceptions, 
the entire mammalian fauna of America was represented in this Avay. 
Only the Xorth American genera of bats were included, as these mam- 
mals are, for the most part, small, and do not present salient external 
characters. Tliey would hardly repay, in connection with an exposi- 
tion, the time and labor which it would be necessary to bestow upon 
them. The Cetaceans wei^e omitted, as not belonging strictly to the 
American fauna. 

Among the rarer genera exhibited were Chironectes, ChlamydophoruH^ 
Xenurus, Elasmof/nathu.s, Lagidium, Murodipodops^ tiolenodon, and 
Brachyiirus (or Ouaharia). 

Of some of the rarest families, such as J)i)iomyida', no representa- 
tives could be obtained. Pictures of some of these were introduced. 

A large proi)ortion of the specimens included in this systematic 
fiimily series Mere taken out of the Museum cases, but it was necessary 
to purchase a considerable number to till gaps. 

The families shown are as follows: 

CeMdcv, the American Monkeys. Soriridiv, tbe Shrews. 

Hapalida-, the Marmosets. Cenletida-, the Tenrecs and Ahni([ui8. 

Felida; the Cats. Sciurida>, the Squirrels. 

Canidn; the Dofjs. HapJodontida', the Sewellels. 

Mustelhhr, the Weasels. Caaiorida; the Beavers. 

Ursido; the Bears. Muridcv, the Rats and Mice. 

rrocyonldw, the Raccoons. Geonnjido', the Pouched Gophers. 

Cercoleptidd, tlie Kinkiijous. Saccomiiida-, the Pouched Rats. 

Otariidw, the Sea-Lions. D'lpodidd, the Jumping Mice and .Jerboas. 

Phocidw, the Seala. (hfodoiitidiv, the Spiny Rats. 

Odoboenidcf, the Walruses. Hiis/ricUhv, the Porcupines. 

Camel'uhv, the Camels and Llamas. Cliiiichilluhr, the Chinchillas. 

Boridiv, the Cattle. DaxtiprocVuhr, the Agoutis. 

J «/i7oc'a^;>-ifZrt", the Prong-horn Antelopes. Dinomi/idw (no English name; only one 

Cerridw, the Deer. specimen known ). 

Dicotylidw, the Peccaries. Cavi'idw, the Cavies. 

Tap'mdw, the Tapirs. Lagomyidiv, the Pikas. 

Tricheclddd', the Manatees. Leporidw, the Hares. 

rin/UostomUhr, the Leaf-nosed Bats. Myrmeeophagidw, the Ant-eaters. 

Emb<illi>»urkl(v, the Free-tailed Bats. Bradijpodidiv, the Sloths. 

VespertUioiiUhv, the Typical Bats. Dasiipod'nhv, the Armadillos. 

Talpidw. the Moles. Dklelphyhlw, the Opossums. 

The groups shown were as follows: 

A male Pacific Walrus, from Walrus Island, Bering Sea. 

A group of California S(;a-lions from the coast of California. 

Steller's Sea-lions, male and female, from the Prihilof Islands, Alaska. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 141 

A Sea-otter from Sanuak Island, Alaska. 

A fainily of Badgers from Kansas, with i)lant.s and ground-wr)rk, reprcsentiTii^ tlit^ 
natural surroundings of these animals on the plains. 

A group of three Woodland Caril>ou, from Newfoundland, with acccissoricH rrpre 
seating the more open portions of that island. 

A group of Barren-ground Caribou from Alaska, on the "tundias." or tn-dess 
jiiains. 

A group of four Rocky Mountain (Joats, from Montana and British Colunihia, rep- 
resented as standing on a ledge of a rocky mountain side. 

A grouj) of six Rocky Mountain Sheep, from Wyoming and Montana, rei)resented as 
climbing about a mountain pi'ak, near the snow-line. 

A group of nine-banded Armadillos, from Texas, with accessories showing the 
prickly vegetation of the arid regions. 

A family of Virginia Opossums, showing nest and young. 

Virginia Deer. A scene at tlie margin of a water-course iu Virginia. A group, 
comprising two bucks, a doe, and a fawn, with accessories, consisting of trees 
and plants characteristic of Virginia, intended to convey an idea of the surround- 
ings iu which the Virginia deer was tirst seen by the European colonists. 

Active work iu iustiillatiou was l)e,iiuii iu ^lay, 1891, when the curator 
visited the establislimeuts of the larger dealer.s iu uatural liistory sup- 
plies, and obtained such materials and specimens as were needed to begin 
the work. The force of taxidermists was iucreased from three to uiue, 
and divided into two parties, one of whicli worked on the groups and the 
other on the single specimens intended for the systematic series. Mr. 
William Palmer was appointed chief taxidermist, and had immediate 
charge of the work nuder the general supervision of the curator; by 
whose judgment and artisti<; taste tlie effectiveness of the groups was 
greatlj' enhanced. 

In preparing the groui)s every effort was made to produce an artis- 
tic effect, not less than to secure complete fidelity to nature, and 
sound and finished workmanship. Every one employed contiibuted 
his shaie of special skill and knowledge, and advantage was taken, as 
far as possible, of advice given by competent field naturalists. 

Photographs of living animals and of characteristic scenery were 
utilized when available. Special acknowledgment should be made to 
j\Ir. Oeorge Bird (Irinuell, of New York, f(n- advice and assistance in 
connection with the group of Mountain Goats; to Col. Cecil Clay, of 
Washington, and to Eev. M. Harvey, of Halifax, in connection with 
that of the Woodland Caribou. Mr. J. Stanley P>rown obtained large 
quantities of lichens and mos.ses in Alaska for the groui) of IJarreu- 
ground Caribou. 

A new feature in these groui)s was tlie introduction of natural leaves, 
grasses, plants, and .sea weeds, prepared by a process invented and 
satisfactorily carried out by Mr. William Palmer. Vines with leaves 
and tendrils which had never been detached from the natural stalk, 
and other similar accessories, were used, producing effects which couUl 
not be obtaine<l ))y artificial leaves fastened on artificial stems. 

Tiie production of these groups is attended with many dilliculties, 
and the number which can be constrncted in a given time would be 



142 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

disapp()iiitiii,i; to one nufainiliar with the conditions. It is often very 
difficult to obtain the skins of animals of the proper ages, or of both 
sexes. On account of the great geographical variation of Aniericaa 
mamnuils, the specimens for any one group must be from a single local- 
ity. The obtaining of accessories — plants, characteristic rocks, soil, 
turf, etc. — is often ditticult. Photograi)hs of living specimens for the 
guidance of the taxidermists are not always accessible, and, further- 
more, in many cases there is much diversity of opinion regarding 
habits. All these circumstances, together with the mechanical difficul- 
ties involved, cause the groups to be expensive both of time and labor. 

While the taxidermic work was progressing, attention was given to 
the preparation of labels. Those for the groups were descriptive, and 
were in several instances accompanied by small maps on which the 
geographical distribution of the species was indicated. The single 
specimens in the systematic series were provided with labels through- 
out, giving names, localities, etc., and, in addition, a larger label was 
made for each family, in which a brief summary of the characters, dis- 
tribution, and habits of the group was presented. All these labels were 
uniform with those regularly used in the Museum, and were printed at 
the Government Printing Office. 

Mention has been made of the series of domesticated animals, in the 
prei)aration of which this department gave some assistance. The series, 
so far as mammals were concerned, was not so successful as was desired, 
but some forms little known in the United States were, nevertheless, 
exhibited. As examples, may be mentioned the yak, obtained in India 
for the Museum by the late Dr. J. Wood-Mason; the zebu of India, the 
domestic buffalo of Africa, and the paca of South America. 

As ornaments to the general zoological exhibit a number of mounted 
heads of the large game of the world were displayed. The following 
species are represented : 

Eland, African. Clark's Gazelle, African. 

Greater Koodoo, African. Waller's Gazelle, African. 

Lesser Koodoo, African. Dorcas Gazelle, African. 

Argali, or wild sheep of Thibet, Asiatic. Sommering's Gazelle, African. 

Bnrhel, or blue wild sheep, Asiatic. Speke's Gazelle, African. 

Thar, or Himalayan wild goat, Asiatic. Salt's Gazelle, African. 

Asiatic Ibex, Asiatic. Sassaby, or Ilartbcest, Africa. 

Beisa Antelope, African. Jackson's Hartbeest, African. 

Nylghau, Asiatic. Siberian Boar, Asiatic. 

While the arrangement of the exhibit was, on the whole, effective, 
the necessity of 'crowding the cases together detracted considerably 
from its appearance. 

The curator has prepared the following statement of the events of 
the year : 

The accessions are, many of them, of a very interesting character. The Museum 
is especially indebted to Ur. W. L. Abbott, for a collection from Aldabra, the 
SevdicUes, and other islands of the Indian Ocean, iu which are included three

skeletons and two skulls of the genus J'ro(h'l2)hinns. accompanied by notes on the 
external coloration, which will doubtless throw light on tlie identity of the species 
of this genus of dolphins. The collection also includes several specimens of Fruit- 
bats, Fteropus, including some which appear to represent an undescribed species. Mr. 
William Astor Chanler deposited a collection of about 35 mounted heads of African 
antelopes. An excellent series of 31 skins of the large game of South Africa, includ- 
ing the true zebra, hartebeestes, gnus, and otlier antelopes, lions, hyenas, wart-hogs, 
etc., were presented by Mr. H. C. Mooi"e. Dr. P. L. Sclater, secretary of tlie Zoolog- 
ical Society of London, presented a number of pelts of antelopes, and other East 
African mammals, collected in Berbera, Somali, by Capt. Swayne. Mounted speci- 
nu!us o( Anomalitrus, Siuutnia, (lalcojiitluciiii. and Bathi/nrgus were purchased to till gai)8 
in the exhibition series. A number of small maunuals of liurmah, from the collection 
of L. Fea, were also purchased. Skins of Brown's Kangaroo, the Spotted Cuscus, and 
the Papuan wild hog, characteristic mammals of New Guinea, were obtained from 
Bruno Geisler. 

Dr E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, continued his extensive collection of mammals 
from the Mexican boundary. Mr. P. L. Jouy made a collection in Mexico, and Prof. 
B. W Evermann in South Dakota. Mr. C. H. Townsend, of the U. S. Fish Commis- 
sion, obtained a Califoruian Sea lion (in San Luis Bay, Lower California), three Sea 
elephants, and a Steller's Sea lion. Prof. C. H. Gilbert obtained for the Museum, 
near Monterey, Cal., a fietal specimen of the rare Steam's grampus, Grampua 
stearnsii. Forty-four mammals were received f'-om the Zoological Park, including 
4 bears, 2 Venezuelan deer, 3 llamas, a beaver, and several monkeys. A fine skeleton 
and a skull of the extinct Artie Sea cow, Rhytina, were purchased through the 
U.S. Fish Commission. The commission also obtained a skull of a Walrus. A skele- 
ton of the Rocky Mountain Goat was purchased. 

As already stated, few changes were made in the exhibition hall during the year. 
The collections presented a more or less chaotic appearance, owing to the necessity 
of withdrawing specimens for the Columbian Exposition. 

The regular routine work of the department was carried on as usual. The skulls 
and skins deposited by the Department of Agriculture were entered; the work of 
cleaning skulls belonging to these collections progressed continuously, and 122 skins 
were made up, including 15 deer, 27 fur-seals, and other larger forms. 

The system of cataloguing the skin and skull of the same individual under diflerent 
numbers, which had been in operation since 1852, has been abandoned so far as the 
collections deposited by the Department of Agriculture were concerned, and all 
specimens derived from a single individual, whatever their character, now receive 
the same number. The same system will be applied to the regular series as soon as 
the present volume of the catalogue is closed. The first number of the new series is 
50,001. The old plan, which was satisfactory while the collection w;ls small, had 
become very burdensome, and was furthermore constantly i>roducing confusion in 
numbers. 

A space in the upper part of the south-entrance laboratory was made available for 
storage pur])oses by the construction of a gallery, or second floor, at the south end 
of the room. 

As soon as they were relieved of work for the World's Fair, the taxidermists 
proceeded to overhaul the skins which had accumulated in the vats for the previous 
two years, and also early accessions. It was found that many had deteriorated 
more or less for lack of attention, and a few were entirely ruined As many as pos- 
sible were dried for the study series and others were laid aside to be mounted at the 
earliest opportunity. This work was still in progress at the clo.se of the year. The 
mounting of two antelopes, a gnu, and a hartbeest was begun. During the year 
82 dry skins were made up for the study series of the Museum, and, as already 
Stated, 122 skins belonging to the Department of Agriculture <leposit. 

Dr. E. A. Mearns, IJ. S. Army, with the aid of aa assistant, continued for some

months to make collections for the Mnsenm on the Mexican boundary. Mr. P. L. 
Jony was also engaged in tield work in Mexico for a part of the year. 

The 8^)ecimen8 lent for study, dissection, or other pnrpo.ses during the year were 
as follows :

DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS. 

The year's work consisted cbietly in preparing the exhibit of birds 
for the Columbian Exposition. This work, owing to the impossibility 
of securing an adequate number of skilled taxidermists, and extreme 
ditticulty of obtaining necessary materials and specimens, and the 
elaborate character of the labels ])repared, absorbed all the time of the 
curator and his assistants Jind stoppcMl the regular O])erations of the 
dei)artnient. 

More than 1,300 birds mounted on pedestals, representing nearly 900 
species, were sent to Chicago; but owing to a reduction of exhibition 
space many of those had to be repacked and stored. This collection 
of mounted birds contained representatives of every one of the families 
of birds found in the Western ITemisi)hcre (104 in number), except the 
American o.strich family, which was represented by water-color pictures. 
Among the smaller birds, each family was represented by sufficient 
number of si)ecies (mostly of different genera) to show the extreme 
variations of size, form, and coloration. 



* These statistics do not include the collections deposited by the Department of 
Agriculture, which are not ilirectly in the custody of the curator. Forty-six speci- 
mens were received on deposit from other sources.

euhauced by tlie careful and exi»licit lal>eliiii;-, in jxtpular language, of 
every object contained in it. 

The gifts <»f material in this department have been so numerous and 
valuable that it is not practicable to mention in this place e\en by 
name all the contributors. They are enumerated in the list of acces- 
sions in Api)endixYi. 

Among the collections containing more than lifty specimens may be 
menti(uied those of Dr. W. L. Abbott, from Kashmir and Baltistan; 
of Dr. W. L. Abbott, from the mountains and vale of Kashmir; of P. L. 
Jouy, from Jalisco, Mexico; of Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, from 
northern Mexico, and the adjacent parts of Isew Mexico, Texas, and 
Arizona, including 823 skins; of Lieut. Wirt Robinson, U. S. Army, 
from Colombia and Curasao. 

Mr. Ridgway reports as follows upon the state of the collection: 

The present state of the coUectioa is very satisfactory as regards preservation, but 
quite otherwise so tar as the arrangement of the skin collection of the larger birds,storefl 
chiefly in the \vest basement, is eoncerned. This is due to causes almost beyond con- 
trol, the chief of which is the congested state of the collection, which has far outgrown 
the space available for storage. The difficulty is, moreover, constantly increasing. 
To remedy the trouble considerable progress has, however, been made in rearrange- 
ment; but the space is so much overcrowded with cases that work can only be done 
slowly and at great disadvantage. At least five times the space now occupied by 
the collection would be necessary for its proper iirrangement, without consideration 
of future accessions. 

It has long been intended to make an extensive distribution of duplicate specimens, 
both to relieve the congestion of our storage facilities and to advance the study of 
ornithology in the various institutions of learning throughout the country ; but this 
has been delayed until the entire collection can be rearranged, since the two being 
simply different parts of the same undertaking, are necessarily carried on together. 

The total numberof specimens was, atthe end of June, 1893, substantially as follows : 

Total skin scries at end of June, 1892 60, 5^2 

Additions during 1892-"93 * 1^ 9j^5 

Total skins at end of June, 1893 62 517 

Exhibition collection at end of June, 1893 8, 154 

Total specimens at end of June, 1893 70 671 

Total specimens at end of June, 1892 68. 416 

Increase during 1892-'93 2 255 

The last entry at end of June, 1892, is 12(j,301. 
The last entry at end of June, 1893, is 128,852. 

Specimens were sent for study to the American Museum of Natural 
Hi.story, to Osbert Salvin, esq., and Count Salvador!, Loudon; to (iur- 
dou Trumbidl, of Hartford; Witmer Stone, of Philadelphia, and other 
specialists. 

DEPAKT3IENT OF BIRDS' EGGS. 

The collection of birds' eggs still remains in the charge of Maj. 0. 
E. Bendire, U. S. Army, retired, who, since the gift of his own unsur- 

" Less additions to mounted collection (370 in number) and specimens distributed

14<S REPORT OF NATIONAL MU.SEUM, 1S93. 

passed private collection to the Sniitlisoniau Institution in 1884, lias 
devoted bis entire time to the development of the national collection 
and the i)iei)aration of the treatise upon the eg,iis and nesting habits 
of North American birds, for which the Institution has been collecting 
material for nearly fifty years. 

Maj. Bendire has continued the preparation of his work on the Life 
Histories <»f North American Birds, and the text for another volume, 
which will include the Cuckoos, the Woodpeckers, the Goat-suckers 
and Swifts, the Humming Birds, the Flycatchers, the Horned Larks, 
the Crows, Jays, Magpies, Blackbirds, and Orioles, is well in progress, 
and the illustrations are being prepared under his direction by Mr. 
John L. Ridgway. 

The first volume of this work has been received with much favor, 
and it is gratifying that American work in illustration should receive 
such hearty commendation from European authorities as have the 
colored plates accompanying this Bulletin. 

Dr. Blasius, in the ""Rundschau," February 4, 181)3, says: 

The chroinolithot^raphs are perfect. The shading is so perfect, especially near 
the outlines of the eggs, which appear to be resting upon a light-gray surface, that 
one imagines himself to be looking at the original eggs. lam not acquainted with 
any work in English, German, or any other language, that has presented pictures 
of eggs approaching these in execution. One can not but express the highest regard 
for a scientific establishment like the Smithsonian Institution which produces so 
excellently executed a book, and we can but wish and hope that the entire work 
may be completed, so that we may have as comprehensive a treatise on North Amer- 
ican oology as we have of its ornithology in Baird, Ridgway, and Brewer's History 
of North American Birds, published m 1874. 

Dr. Hermann Schalow, of Berlin, in the "Ornithologische Monats- 
berichte," January, 1803, wrote: 

The original water-color drawings were made from nature l)y John L. Ridgway, 
and are reproduced in lithography in a most admirable fashion. The plates far sur- 
pass the best with which we are familiar. 

Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe, of the British Museum, in •' Nature," Novem- 
ber 2, 1893, wrote: 

The figures are beautifully rendered by chromolithography, and the publication 
is altogether a notable one. The letterpress is the work of Capt. Charles Beudire, 
wh<) IS known to be one of the most practiced oologists of the present day. He has 
described and figured in the present volume the eggs of all the North American game- 
birds, i)igeons, and birds of prey, and he has used his opportunity to the greate^'^t 
advantagt! by giving an excellent account of the life-histories of the species, together 
with the latest inlormation respecting their geographical distribution. Capt. Ben- 
dire's work forms one of the most important of the recent contributions to ornitho- 
logical knowledge, and the succeeding volumes will be awaited with interest by 
ornithologLsts. 

Special allusion sliould be made to the very important cooperation 
of Dr. William L. Ralph, of Utica, N. Y. Dr. Ralph has for twenty 
years been forming a collection of the eggs and nests of North American 
birds, very complete for the entire continent, though esi>ecially rich in 
southern and extremely northern forms. This collection, which is one 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 149 

of the most important ami most beautifully {)iei)are(l in existence, 
is esjiecially valuable to the student on account of the thorough and 
scholarly manner in which it is catalogued and labeled, has been given 
by him to the Smithsonian Institution, and nearlyhalf of it, numbering 
about 3,-.">0 eggs, has already been transferred to the custody of the 
curator. 

The collection is being constantly increased, and Dv. Italph spares 
no expense in obtaining representatives of rare species. By this agency 
ah)ne at least sixty species, either not atall re]>resented or represented 
by AYorthless specimens, have up to the present time been added. 

A large number of other gifts have been received, of which those of 
Dr. A. K. Fisher, Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, Lieut. 11. C. Benson, 
r. S. Army, and Walter F. AVebb are the most extensive, including each 
over tifty specimens.

DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND EATRArill ANS. 

Dr. Leojihard Stejneger, the curator of these collections, reports that 
if the progress of the department be measured by the number of speci- 
mens received and entered ui)on the books, the activity of the past 
year has been unprecedented, no less than 12,.{02 si)ecimens having 
been catalogued.* Some of these have furnished types for quite a num- 
ber of recently described si)ecies, both from this country and abroad. 

As a {!onsequencft of the greatly increased number of specimens 
received during the present year, the routine work of installing, identi- 
fying, caring for, labeling, and reporting upon them has been more 
than twice as great sta during any previous year. The department has 



* For comparison it may be mentioned that the number of entries in 189l-'92 was 
1,055; in 1890-'9L 908; iu 1889-90. 705: in 1888-89. 784 ; in 1887-'88, 19; in 188r)-'87. 138.

also liad on liaiul the ])reparation of its part of the exhibit for the 
World's ('olumbiaii Exposition in Chicago, so that the curator and his 
assistant have had their time fnlly occui)ie(l withont much cliance of 
effecting a better arrangement of the old collections. 

The curator has been specially engaged in the care of the collection 
of reptiles obtained in Death Valley by the expedition sent out from 
the U. S. Department of Agriculture, in charge of Dr. C. Hart Mer- 
riam, and has furnished a special report which, accompanied by four 
plates, was published in North American Fauna, Xo. 7, May, ISO.'?. 
In this are described 11 new species and subspecies, while a number 
of forms described by previous authors are more fully reported ujion. 

Among the most interesting additions to the collection is a new 
species of Xantusio, described by Dr. Stejneger as X. Heitshinci* This 
lizard belongs to a genus peculiar to California, two species only being 
previously known. The new species is remarkably distinct and forms 
altogether one of the most interesting herpetological novelties obtained 
in this country during recent years. I may add that the present species 
is only part of a very valuable collection sent home by Mr. Ilenshaw 
from southern Califonna. 

There has also been received another collection which throws con- 
siderable light on the geographical distribution of species in the south- 
western portion of the United States and contains many rare species. 
This was presented by Dr. Timothy E. Wilcox, U. S. Army, who col- 
lected at Fort Uuachuca, Ariz. 

Of extralimital collections obtained during the present year may be 
mentioned those made by Mr. P. L. Jouy in varicms i)arts of Mexico; 
by Mr. Charles W. liichmoud in Nicaragua, and by Mr. Harry W. 
Perry in Honduras. 

Especially important have l)een the collections received from Atrica. 
The Museum has l)een particularly deticient in material from that part 
of tiie world, but tlianks to the zeal and generosity of two American 
gentlemen, this deticiency is now gradually being remedied. i\Ir. 
William Astor Chanler has sent collections from the east coast of the 
mainland between the mouth of the Tana River and Hameye, about 300 
miles iidand, and Dr. W. L. Abbott, others from the Seychelles and 
various otlier groups of islands off the east coast of Africa. The study 
of the former collection by Dr. Stejneger reveals many rare and 
undes(Tibed species, while the latter furnishes the material for a full 
list of the herpetological fauna of the islands in ([uestion, which also 
shows a number of new species. 

Among other ])rominent contributors are Profs. ,1. T. Scovell and A. 
J. Woolraan; Julius Hurter, St. Louis, Mo.; F. Stephens, Santa

The work of Dr. St('Jiiej4er on tlie i)roi)0.sed .su[»i)lemeiitiiry \()liim(' 
of the Noiueiiclator Zoologicus has progressed as fast as couhl be 
exix'cted, and by the end of the year more than 17,000 generic terms 
had been card-catah)giied and arranged alphabetically by classes. It 
is evident that the original maximum estimate of 20,000 genera will l>e 
reache<l or even exceeded. 

Excellent facilities for studying the collections have been extended 
to Prof E. D. Cope, who, among other subjects studied, made extended 
anatomical researches for his new ophiological system, and to Dr. O. 
P. Hay, for liuishing his work on the Indiana reptiles. 

The estimate of the curator shows the status of the collection on 
June 30, 1893, to be as follows:

The exhibit of the reptiles and batrachians at the World's Colum- 
bian Exposition comprised two classes of objects, viz : (1) Groups of 
casts and mounted specimens, and (2) a series of specimens illustrating 
representative American families. 

Owing to lack of space and time three groups only were exhibited, 
though work on several more had been planned and partly begun. 

The tirst group consisted of 14 casts of some of the more typical 
poisonous snakes occurring within the United States, as for instance, 
various species of rattlesnakes, the water moccasin, the co])perhead, 
and the harlequin snake. The snakes were shown coiled or crawling 
among rocks, roots of trees, dead leaves, moss, etc. The accessories 
were not intended in every case to represent the actual surroundings of 
the species, as the specimens belonged to species inhabiting widely sepa- 
rated localities, and were exhibited together for the purpose of contrast- 
ing the various types. The casts composing the group were mostly of 
plaster, while two were made of a glue composition. They have in every 
instance been made from specimens sent alive to the Museiun, several 
of them exi)ressly for the Chicago exhibit. Among these I would call 
special attention to the magnificent Texas rattlesnake [Crotnlus atrox) 
and the red California rattler (C. ruhidiis) from southern California. 

The second group comprised 33 casts and mounted specimens of 
ditierent types of land and fresh water turtles inhabiting the United 
States, including gophers, box tortoises, terrapins, mud turtles, soft- 
shelled turtles, etc., the accessories, as in the snake group, illustrating in 
ageneral way only their natural sm roundings. water and sandy beaches 
consequently predominating.

The third giouj) showed a tine yellow boa, from Jamaica, in the aetof 
cliiiil)iii,u' the branches of a tree, typifying the non-venomous snakes in 
contrast to the group of poisonous ones. 

The secoud class of objects consisted of G8 species in alcohol, this 
series being destiued to illustrate by tyi)ioal si)eciniens the families of 
reptiles and batrachiaus occurring in the Western Hemisphere. Alto- 
gether 48 families were shown, several of the larger ones being repre- 
sented by a series of species to illustrate the extremes of forms included 
in them. All the specimens were carefully mounted upon glass i)lates, 
iu imitation of the natural positions of the animals, and displayed in 
square glass Jars, the larger ones in Dortlinger Jars, the smaller, in 
Benedict plate-glass Jars, The great advancement of this inode of 
exhibiting alcoholics over the old one of simply snspending the animal 
iu a round Jar, was very striking. The plate-glass Jars especially are 
so beautifnl and the animals show to such an advantage that it is hoped 
that the experiments which are now being made for improvements in 
their manufacture may meet with success. Each Jar was provided with 
two printed labels, one family label giving in a few terms the scientific 
characteristics of the family, in addition to a brief ])opnlar account of 
its other peculiarities, as well as the geographical distribution, the 
other label being the specimen label containing the popular and scien 
tific names, locality, ^luseum number, and donor's or collector's name.

Exposition, and tbis, together with his other duties in connection with 
the Commission, has enabled him to devote but little time to the work 
of the ^fuseum. He has cooperated Avitli the Assistant Secretary in the 
prei)avatiou of a Museum publication, "Oceanic Ichthyology," which 
is now in press. Mr. Barton A. Bean, assistant curator, has been 
engaged in the routine work of the department in the preparation of 
the exhibit for the Exposition at Oliicago, and in the arrangino- of 
drawings-of deep-sea tishes for publication. A general rearrangement 
of the collection of the department is needed, and will be undertaken 
this fall. There have been 418 catalogue entries; the number of speci- 
mens received is about 1,000. 

The most important collections contributed have been received from 
the V. S. Fish Commission, especially the additional deei)-sea and oceanic 
forms collected by the steamer Albdtro.ss. 

This exhibit at the World's Fair consisted of 154 families and sub- 
fanulies, represented by 107 species of the fishes of Xortli and South 
America. The specimens Avere displayed in rectangular glass Jars, to 
which were attached labels giving a diagnosis setting forth the family 
characters, followed by a statement of the number of the genera and 
species in the family, their geographical range, and an account of their 
habits, food, and uses. Small species labels were also attached to desig- 
nate individuals or groups of individuals. The object was to make a 
popular and instructive exhibit of the fishes of the Western Hemi- 
sphere, which aim was satisfactorily carried out by the means employed 
for the dis})lay. 
"The following is a list of the families and subfamilies represented:

REPORT OF ASSISTAXT SECKETARV. 155 

DE1>ART:mKX'I' of vertebrate FOSi^ILS. 

The work in tliis (lopartnuMit of the IMuseum during the past year 
has been partly devoted to moimtiug- and hibeliug the specimens 
ah-ead3' phiced in eases in tbe exliibition room, and this work has been 
under the special eliarge of ^fr. F. A. Lucas. 

The preparation of specimens secured by the honorary curator, Prof. 
O. C. Marsli, <luring his explorations in the West for the U. S. Geologi- 
cal Survey, has been continued at New Haven, and good progress has 
been niade, but the want of proper space to exhibit such specimens 
has prevented any of these being placed on exhibition in tlie National 
Museum during the past j-ear. 

The curator i)roposes to use the wall space above the cases for a 
series of life-size restorations of the large extiiK-t animals especially 
characteristic of North America, and an important beginning has been 
made by the production of a series of six restorations under the imme- 
diate direction of Prof. Marsli. These restorations represent on canvas 
the skeletons, natural size, of L> gigantic Dinosauriau reptiles from the 
Jurassic formation, Ccmtosaurus and Stegoscmrus; 2 others from the 
Cretaceous, Claosiiuru.s and Tricerafops; and 2 huge mammals from tiie 
Tertiary. Tinocrras and Brontothcrinm. These restorations have been 
made with great care, from type specimens, and this exhibition will be 
of much interest to the general public. Sinnlar restorations of other 
extinct animals are in preparation. 

The curator has published, during the past year, several papers 
relating indirectly to the collections of vertebrate fossils mentioned 
above, though more intimately in connection with the U. S. Geological 
Survey. In memoirs now in preparation, however, he will describe 
fully the more important specimens he has already deposited in the 
National Museum. 

There have been l.J specimens received during the year, involving 
the same number of (catalogue entries. 

l)El'AKT:\rENT OF MOLLUSKS. 

The curator. Mr. \V. U. J)al], reports that satisfactory ])rogress has 
been made in routine work during the year. The arrangement of 
specimens in the exhibiticm cases in the lower hall has been completed. 
The general collection has been revised, the species conveniently 
arranged for reference, and index sheets for each drawer, containing a 
list of the genera and species in each tray, have been prepared. At 
the same time the names of the species have been checked off on an 
interleaved copy of Paetel's Catalogue of Mollusks, thus facilitating 
reference to the collection and indicating deticiencies more clearlv. 
Duplicates have been eliminated and packed away in their proj)er 
boxes, as described in my last annual report. New material has been 
examined, labeled, and distributed to its proper jdace in the collection

after registration. Much attention has been paid to tlie Tertiary fos- 
sils, ill which the collection is very rich, and which were urgently 
needed for comparison with the material brought in by the U. S. Geo- 
logical Survey. The entire collection of Tertiary ibssils has been 
arranged for easy reference, and a provisional card catalogue of locali- 
ties and horizons has been i)i'epared. Much of the material from the 
Miocene has been cleaned, separated, arranged, and registered, and 
provided with labels showing locality, collector, etc., though in many 
cases the names had to be omitted until the specimens shall have been 
more thoroughly studied, A large part of the registration for the year 
has related to this class of specimens. The amount of registration is 
shown in the following table: 

Species of duplicates catalogneil 281

Drawings registered 29 

Envelopes filled out for dra wings 29 

Total t;20 

Adding to these the number of actual registrations for the vear we 
have a grand total of about 5,738 entries, as against a similar total of 
7,700 for lS01-'92. 

The number of accessions during 1892-'93 was 72, against 85 in 
1891-92. Several of them were of importance and many of great inter- 
est, but, as a whole, the accessions during the i»ast year do not comprise 
any very large single masses of material compared with those of some 
previous years. 

The most important contribution to the collection has been the result 
of a decision by the Rev. L. T. Chamberlain and Mrs. Frances Lea 
Chamberlain to contribute the means necessary to bring up to date 
and keej) as complete as practicable the Lea collection of fresh-water 
mollusks, especially the UnionUUc. In pursuance of this very desira- 
ble object, they have generously furnished the means for the purchase 
of several unique series of Asiatic and African uuios, and have author- 
ized the ordering of others, when necessary, for the object in view. 
Nearly all the material thus acquired is rare and new to the collection, 
and of the utmost value for the study of the group to which it belongs. 
Looking forwar<l to the publication of a catalogue of the Lea Collection 
as one of the special bulletins of the Museum, Mr. and Mrs. Cliamber- 
lain have also generously added to the sectional library by autliorizing 
the purchase of such works of recent date on the riiioiiithr as are 
necessary to the studies involved and not yet contained in the jMiiseum 
library. Several costly and important works have already been 
ordered or received under this arrangement, and more will follow. Our 
sincere thanks are due to Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlain for their wise 
and considerate generosity, which not only benefits science and the 
Museum, but continues the association of the name of Lea with prog-

ross in tlie study of tliese groups of animals in a graceful and most 
gratifying way. 

lu completion of an exchange sometime since entered into between 
Mr. Dall and Mr. Maurice Cossmaun, of Paris, the successor of Deshayes 
in the minute study of the successive eocene fauruis of the Parisian 
basin, the latter has sent to the Museum about 700 named species of 
mollusks from that formation, which, coming from him, have the authen- 
ticity of types. Sev^eral desiderata of the Museum Inive been supidied 
by Mr. Hugh Fulton, of London, through an exchange arranged with 
him. all of which were new to the collection, and several of extreme 
rarity and value. 

From Dr. W. L. Abbott has been received an interesting and very 
attractive lot of shells from the Seychelles and adjacent islands. 
The California Academy of Sciences, through Dr. J. G. Cooper, has 
donated about lo specimens of land shells from the peninsula of Lower 
California, most of which were very acceptable additions to the col- 
lection. Our faithful correspondent, Mr. I. Greegor, has continued his 
contributions to the Museum by donating specimens in alcohol of the 
rare Murexfuln'scens Sby., from Fernandina, Fla., and a number of inter- 
esting pathological s[)e('imens showing how mollusks repair the injuries 
they occasionally receive. Dr. H. von Ihering has contributed some 
interesting laud and fresh- water shells from Brazil, and Rev. H, Loomis 
others from Japan. Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, of the International Bound- 
ary Survey between the United States and Mexico, has forwarded the 
mollusks collected by the party, including a new species of Anodonta, 
with a view to the preparation of a report on the expedition and its 
collections. From Mr. J. D. Mitchell and Mr. J. A. Singley. and also 
the State geological survey of Texas, have been received interesting 
miscellaneous collections, including several species not before reported 
from the Texas coast, and a few which appear to be undescribed. Mr. 
Charles W. Richmond has furnished a few interesting species from the 
Nicaraguan region. Mrs. Ada M. Walton sent to the Museum a col- 
lection of specimens from the coast of California, which, from certain 
circumstances connected with the donation, deserves s})ecial nientiim, 
though the collection added little to the Museum series which was not 
already represented there. Mr. Ed. Saxon Wyard presented a few 
large ornamental shells, whi(;li, from their unusual size and beauty, were 
very desirable for exhibition jjurposes. Mr. William Moss, of Ashton- 
under-Lyne, England, contributed some microphotographs of the rad- 
ula, etc., of various British mollusks, which were exceptionally success- 
iul in showing dillicult anatomical details. An exchange with Mr. B. 
H. NN'right added a few desirable Uuiouidiie to the collection. The 
Department of Agriculture and the U. S. Fish Commision have con- 
tributed several lots of mollusks collected by members of their statts. 

Besides the work abo\'e referred to, the general o])erations of the 
department include the i»reparation of special reports on collections

made under goveininental auspices by various orj^anizatious, such as 
the U. S. Fish Coniinission, the U. S. Navy, the Revenue Marine, the 
Department of Aj^riculture, and special expeditions. xVmong them are 
two which bear particnhirly on the Tertiary geology and paleontology 
of the southeastern border of the United States. One of these (Bulle- 
tin 84 of the U. tS, Geological Survey, by William H. Dall and Gilbert 
D. Harris) summarizes our knowledge of the post-eocene Tertiary 
geology of the United States, including Alaska, up to about 18!K), the 
manuscript having been delayed in ijrinting nearly two years. The 
other is the second part of a report by the writer on the Tertiary fauna 
of Florida, including the gastropods and containing nuich new mate- 
rial. A third part, to comprise the Pelecypods and a geological sum- 
mary, will conclude the work. In addition may be mentioned certain 
reports on fauna! collections of the Southern States and a small collec- 
tion from eastern Siberia, and further researches by Mr. Simpson on 
the Unioni(l(v. 

Mr. Dall speaks as follows of the state of the collection : 
In pre lous reports I have explained why it is not possible to give the exact num- 
ber of species, specimens, duplicates, etc., contained in the collection. In my last 
report it was estimated that the collection contained about 482,725 specimens, of 
which about 100,000 are preserved in alcohol. During tlie year about 5,600 specie 
mens were received, which would malve a present total of 188,325 specimens now 
contained in the collection. The number of entries in the register for 1892-'93 is 
4,578, as shown in the appended table, representing some 13,734 specimens.

The total number of registrations to date, diulucting all duplications and omis-

date. The unmber of workers and their distribution in the building render it nec- 
essary to use siuniltaneously several volumes of the register, which explains why 
the foregoing table is necessary to show the total registrations for the year. The 
formal registration, with the gaps alluded to, terminates .luue 30, 1893, with the 
number 126,2.59. 

The work of assisting students in various parts of the country to 
identify their local fauna, to intelligently direct their studies, and to 
answer their numerous (pieries on different branches of the subject has 
always been regarded as an important function of this department, and 
has been made a special care by Mr. Dall, who states that correspond- 
ence of this kind was conducted in 1891-'92 with 166 different persons, 
involving over 300 letters and 600 to 700 pages of writing, besides the 
identiticatiou of many liundred s])('('iinens, while in 1892-''03, 90 ditlVreiit

ing-, nearly all of which Avas the woik of the curator. For want of time, 
owing' to tlie press of work and abseiu-eof suffi(!ient clerical assistance, 
the number of species identitied for students has not been recorded. 
In 1891-'92 the number amounted to over 3,000 species, for each of 
Avhich a label had to be written. During- the past year the nuuiber 
sent for identilication was considerably less. 

DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS. 

In this department, under Prof. C. V. Riley, hon<miry curator, consid- 
erable time has been devoted to the preparation of exhibits for the 
World's Columbian Exposition. In this work the Museum has cooper- 
ated with the Division of Entomology in the U. S. Department of Agri- 
culture. The exhibit, while devoted Iarg:ely to the science of entomology 
economically considered, also contained much material of purely educa- 
tional or scientific value. The systematic collection of Xorth American 
families and the collection of insects injurious to forestry were rear- 
ranged. A large amount of material has been identified for correspond- 
ents, and many students have been aided in their work by means of 
loans and exchanges. 

Among the most important accessions were: 

From Prof. A. L. Montandou, Bucharest, Roumania, 374 species, iiichuliag 2,332 
specimens, mostly exotic hemiptera not previously represented in our collection, 
and especially valuable as being identified by this well-known specialist. 

Coleoptera, representing the saline fauna of Great Salt Lake Hasin, Utah, 30 species 
from H. G. Hubbard, Detroit, Mich., and E. A. Schwarz, Washington, D. C. 

A collection of East African insects of all orders (more than 300), from William 
AstorChanler, Ilameye-on-Tana, East Africa. Donated on condition of having them 
studied and afterwards divided with the Imperial Museum in Vienna, Austria. 

A collection of miscellaneous insects (66 species), from Kashmir, from Dr W L 
Abbott. 

A collection of European JluscidiB (98 species), illustrating Brauer aud liergen- 
stamm's classification of this group, from the Imperial Museum of Vienna, Austria, 
through Dr. F. Brauer. 

North American Noctuidso (63 species), from Prof. J. H. Smith, New Brunswick, 
N. J., mostly types of new species described by him either in the Museum Bulletins 
or in the journals especially devoted to North American entomology. 

A collection of insects, mostly Coleoptera (25)6 specimens), collected in Mexico by 
J. T. Mason, Jalapa, Mexico, from the curator.

IXCUKASE OF THE COLLECTION. 

Thecollectioiiliasincreaseddnriugtheyearby the addition (if about TjdOOspeeitueiis. 

The last catalogue entry for June, 1892, was No. 1041. 

The last catalogno entry for June, 1893, was No. 1260. 

The routine work of the year has consisted chieliy of making up collections for 
exchange; reports on accessions for examination and report, about 100 such reports 
having been uuide duriug the year; naming of specimens for collectors (about 50 
larger and smaller series of insects of all orders have been identified for corresi)oud- 
ents, representiug more than 2,000 species); the selection of material to send to 
specialists for study and determination ; mounting and labeling of specimens; iden- 
tifying the material of the accessions and incorporating it in the collections. This 
is generally done in coimection with the work of arranging all the collections in 
permanent shai)e.

(rt) lieserve collection.'^.— In the IHptcra, learranjfeuientH have been made, i)iiii(ii)all.v 
in the iainilies Tacliinifhr and liombynidw. To the Lepidoplcra much time has l.ueu 
devoted in all groups, l.oth in the systematic and biologic series. In the Coleopfera 
several groups like the Kumolpini and Hijdrohimi lia\c been rearran"-ed. In the 
Hymenoptcra accessions have been incori)orat((l. In the Ifomoptera all the unar- 
ranged material has been incorporated and the entire collection has been arranged. 
{b) Duplicate collections.— The^^o are generally arranged in connection with tiie cor- 
responding reserve collections, but an exception was made this year in selecting a 
special series of North American Colcoplera, containing two specimens each of all 
the species (2,'212) available frnm the general duplicate collection. This will facili- 
tate exchanges. 

(c) Exhibit collecfions.—In order to temporarily fill up the vacancies in the Museum 
exhibition hall caused by the transportation to Chicago of the larger portion of the 
nniterial, 56 exhibit boxes were prepared from duplicates of native and exotic insects. 
At the beginning of the fiscal year a series of Xorth American insects were selected, 
showing 181 species that have more commonly-used vernacular names. These were 
arranged in 7 boxes and put on exhibition. 

Several of the papers by the curator, enumerated in the Bibli()grai)hy (.\ppendix 
VII 1, are based largely on Mu.seum material. Dr. A. S. Packard, who is engaged m 
the study of the North American Bombycid moths, has beeu allowed free study of 
the Museum collection, and was granted the loan of siu-h species as requir.'d a. more 
detailed investigation. Various papers have already appeared in the Canadian Ento- 
mologist and in the .lournal of the New York Entomological Society on this sub- 
ject. Mr. William Fox, of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, has 
borrowed the collection of the genus Tri/poxelon of the family Pemphrcdouula; to 
assist him in his review of this group, published in the Transactions of the Ameri- 
can Entomological Society. Prof. A. L. Monlandon, of Bucharest, Roumania, has, 
by exchange material from the Museum, been assisted in studying the North Ameri- 
can Hemiptera-Heteroptera, and as a result has published in the Proceedings of the 
MiLseum, Vol. xvi, pp. 45-52, "Notes on American HemiptcraHeteroptera/ Dr. F. 
W. Coding in his "Synopsis of the Subfamilies and Genera of the Membracida' of 
North America-' has studied Fitch's types, e.specially in the Museum collection, and 
his "MembracidiE of St. Vincent Island, West Indies," in the Canadian Entomolo- 
gist for February, 1893, pp. 53-56, contains seven new species from tvpes iu the 
Museum collection. Mr. O. F. Cook has studied tht> Lithobiidw in the collection and 
borrowed the African Myriapods of Abbott's collection for study and special report. 
Mr. Samuel H. Scudder has studied the Orthoptera of the Galapagos Islands, and 
Mr. William H. Ashmead has completed a valuable monograph of the Proctotrypidw 
based on material in the Mu.seum. Mr. L. O. Howard has continue.l his work upon 
the host relations of parasitic Hymenoptera, and has also prosecuted certain special 
studies on the Chalcidida; while Mr. C. L. Marlatt has be(>n engaged upon the revis- 
ion of the Tenthredinidiv. 

Prof. Kiley also coutiibiite.s tlio followino- notice of the exliibits in 
entomology in the Government buildino- at the World's Fair: 

The fact of the intimate connection of the Department of Insects in the National 
Museum with the Entomological Division of the Department of Agriculture, led to 
a certain and necessary commingling of interests in the arrangement for tlie repre- 
sentation of the two at the World's Columbian Exposition. The main Government 
exhibit in entomology was therefore brought together in the agricultural section of 
the Government buildiug, and while largely devoted to the economic phases of the 
subject, in which particular it more clos.dy represent.'d the Department of Agricul- 
ture, it contained also a large number of exhibits purely educational or .scientific iu 
scope, which appertained more strictly to the .Museum material and work. Of the 
former al.so practically all the insect material was drawn from the Museum lar.relv

bowevei', from the biologic and other coHectious transferred from the Department 
of Agriculture at or subsequent to the practical union of tlie two branches of Ciov- 
ernment work in entomology. The expense attending the preparation of all these 
exhibits, the securing of new cases, and the purchase of much new material, was 
defrayed, however, from the appropriation for the Dejiartment of Agriculture. In 
addition to the above, and to properly represent the Department of Insects in the 
National Museum, in conjunction with the exhibits of the Department of Agricul- 
ture, a sbowing was made in the Museum section covering a branch of the subject 
not included in the displays in the agricultural section. This consisted of a very 
elaborate and coiiii>lete exposition of the characteristics of the families of American 
insects and their allies among the Arthropods. The general charge of the prepara- 
tion of the exhil)it of the Department of Agriculture was assigned to Mr. C. L. Mar- 
latt, who also attended to its installation at Chicago, as well as of the Museum 
exhibit proper, which Prof. J. B. Smith was employed to prepare. Tbe exhibits of 
the Agricultural Department and of the Museum may be described somewhat in 
detail as follows : 

That of the Museum occupied 24 boxes of the standard Museum size, and consisted 
of a graphic representation, by means of specimens and tigures, of the grosser fea- 
tures of the classitication of insects and their near allies in the subkingdom Arthro- 
poda. Included in this were illustrations of the subclasses, orders, and minor 
groups down to and including tlie families of the classes Insecfa, Malacopoda, Myria- 
poda, Acarida and Arachnida. In addition to sample representative exhibits with 
each of the groups from class down to family, in many cases also with figures illus- 
trating typical specimens or structural details, were brief but intelligent and accu- 
rate definitions of the groups, carefully prepared and in the form of large lal)els. 
The amount of labor thus entailed will be better appreciated from tbe fact that to 
do this required tlie preparation of over 500 group characterizations. This exhibit 
while not a large one in the amount of space occupied, was much more complete 
than anything hitherto attempted of its kind, and was most instructive in repre- 
senting and defining in small space the entire scheme of the more general features 
of classification o{ Arthropods, other than Crustacea. 

The larger and main display in the agricultural section, representing primarily the 
Division of Entomology of the Department of Agriculture, may be described under 
the several sections into which it naturally divides itself, viz: (1) Injurious and 
beneficial insects; (2) systematic and biologic entomology; (3) professional ento- 
mological exhibits; (4) insecticides and insecticide apparatus; (5) entomological pub- 
lications, and (6) illustrations, maps, and charts. Of these the first three sections 
contain material drawn from the National Museum, with the addition of much new 
and original matter; the others are entirely original, and were prepared especially 
for the exhibit of the Division of Entomology of the Department of Agriculture. 

The economic series, namely, insects injurious to agriculture, had, as a basis, the 
old economic material which has hitherto been exhibited at various previous expo- 
sitions, but which, on account of its great educational value, could not well be 
omitted. It was, however, greatly extended and made to include the results of the 
later studies of life-histories and remedies, and was entirely remodeled and rear- 
ranged in new cases, with new labels, and was for the most part fresh material. It 
iiududed over 600 special exhibits of injurious species, affecting 31 distinct culti- 
vated plants, in addition to insects injurious to live stock and household pests. The 
number of exhibits of injurious species affecting some of the leading jjlants rei)re- 
rsented were cabbage, 34; ai)i)le, 3."); orange, 36; cotton, 37; grape, 43; clover, 67; 
and Indian corn, 129. Each of these exhibits gave a life-history, illustrated by 
specimens and figures, natural enemies, together with references to the literature 
and instruction as to remedies. In this same category conies the collection of forest 
insects, which occupied eight standard Museum drawers, and included the principal 
insect enemies of the leading forest trees of economic im])ortaiice. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETAKV. 1G3 

A very proniiuont, if not the main feature of the present exliibit. distinf,nii.shinj; it 
from all its predecessors, was the special display of wax models of i)lant's showUig 
tlie perfect development in eonjunetion with representation of the results of insect 
injury, and the enlarged models of some of the more important of the injurious and 
benelicial species. Most noteworthy in connection with tlie many plant models 
were those of Indian corn, cotton, and hop. These three plants were selected and 
elaborated because representing typical and leading American crops; the corn more 
particularly as the leading staple of the Northern Central States, the cotton for the 
Southern belt, and the hop as a leading industry of the Northeast and Northwest. 
They were all intended to illustrate and draw attention to the affecting insects dis- 
played in connection with them, which pur))08e they served admirably. 

The important models of injurious insects comprised the Hop Louse, Chinch Bug, 
and Oyster-shell Scale, each represented in all of their several stages. The beneh- 
cial insects were represented by models of the imported Australian Ladybird ( Fedalia 
cnrdinalis), showing life-history: structural models of the domestic silkworm, moth 
and larva ; and of the Honey Bee, all stages and economy. A similar anatomical model 
of the European Cockchafer was also exhibited. A further exhibit of useful insects 
was the showing of silk moths, the larva^ of which eith.-r now furnish an important 
article of daily necessity or may be capable of doing so, comprising a representation of 
the ditferent stages, in some cases witii silk, of 12 important native and foreign species. 
More strictly appertaining to the National Museum were the displays hi system- 
atic and biologic entomology and miscellaneous exotic and native insects, com- 
l)rising Section 2. The systematic and biologic series were represented by means 
of some 23 sample boxes taken from the national collection and indicating the 
actual present condition of the collections in ditferent orders and the system fol- 
lowed by the curator in the disposition and arrangement of the material, and was 
intended for the edification of visiting entomologists, who would be interested in 
the standard national collections as much if not more than the special educational 
displays in the economic series for the general pu1>lic. Here also mav be classed the 
general insect display consisting of some 28 boxes tilled with the striking insect forms 
of Central America, Venezuela, Honduras, and Brazil, much of the material for which 
was recently collected by Mr. H. H. Smith, and is undetermined and undescribed. 
It was found possible to secure this valuable collection out of the fund allotted for 
this Department, and by so doing at once greatly enrich the national collection in 
Central and South American insects, and secure material for the making of a showy 
exhibit to represent the beautiful and varied forms and colors assumed by insect 
life near the tropics. With this last, and serving a similar purpose, may be 
classed the display of Golden-rod insects, which was designed to appeal to the 
ajsthetic taste of those who see or are interested in the beautiful aspects of nature's 
handiwork, rather than in practical applications in the arts and sciences. The vast 
number of insects that frequent the Solidago, either to breed on the diflerent parts 
of the plant or merely attracted to its bloom, together with the great beauty of the 
plant itself and its wide distribution and distinctive American habitat, led to its 
special treatment. A very realistic model plant, in wax, served as a center about 
and on which to display its more characteristic or common insect frequenters. 

The remaining sections of the exhibit were economic in character and pertained 
more strictly to the Department of Agriculture, and may be very briefly referred to. 
What has been termed the professional exhibit was a display of the diverse appa- 
ratus and methods for collecting, rearing, mounting, and preserving insects, includ- 
ing in all some 66 displays of different styles of butterfly, sweeping and water nets, 
collecting umbrellas, sieves, collecting and pinning forceps, collecting bottles and 
boxes, breeding cages or vivaria of all sorts; spreading, drying, and mounting 
apparatus; preservative and mounting substances, vial-holders, and insect boxes'! 
The insecticide."! and apparatus for applying these to plants comprised of the former 
120 and of the latter 12.") exhibits. 



164 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

A display was also made of the official entomological puldicatious of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture and the U. S. Entomological Commission, and some 129 frames 
of entomological illustrations, maps, charts, and bromide enlargements. These 
illustrations will probably become Museum property, and are for the most part in 
standard ]\Iuseum fr.imes. They include 69 plates of illustrations of insects made up 
from iiguros published m Prof. Riley's reports on the insects of Missouri, and from 
illustrations from the reports of the Division of Entomology. De])artnient of Agri- 
culture, and the U. S. Entomological Commission. Tliere were also a series of ordi- 
nal charts representing classification and transformations ; charts of important insect 
pests representing life history; maps showing range of leading insects; views of 
insecticide o])erations and insect ravages, and a .series of bromide enlargements rep- 
resenting exterior and interior views of the insectary of the Department of Agricul- 
ture and interiors of the entomological rooms in the Department of Agriculture and 
National Museum. 

A detailed catalogue of 121 pages, covering the entire exhibit of the Department 
of Agriculture, was issued in midsummer as bulletin 31 of the Division of Entomology, 
and was distributed to interested visitors during the remainder of the Exposition. 
In it a full statement of the exhibits is given, and much information relative to them 
which could not be well displayed with the exhibits themselves. This was supple- 
mented by the stationing of some member of the division force at Chicago from time 
to time during the summer to more fully explain the exliibit. 

MARINE INVERTEBRATES. 

The honorary curator, Dr. Eichaid Kathbun, on aceouitt of his respon- 
sibilities to the U. S. Fish Connnissioii, has been unable to give more 
than a general supervision to the work of this department during the 
year, but substantial advances have been made. The number of acces- 
sions have been larger than usual, one of ^vhich will add a new and 
interesting feature to the display collection. Early in the year it again 
became possible to open the exhibition hall to the public, and while 
circumstances prevented any extensive improvement in the arrange- 
ment of the cases, the chief cause of interference in that matter, the 
preparation of material for the World's Columbian Exi)Osition, will 
necessarily i^rove of great benetit in the liiture. The introduction of a 
new style of rectangular glass jar for the display of alcoholic speci- 
mens will also permit of the extension of the exhibition series in a very 
important direction. 

Much progress has been made by Mr. Benedict and Miss Eathbun 
in their studies of the higher crustaceans belonging to the dei)artment, 
and several i)apers bearing upon these subjects have been completed 
for i)ublication. Arrangements have also been made with three well- 
known authorities in Euroi)e for the study of our large collections of 
foraminifera, hexactinellid sponges, and deep sea deposits, and it is 
exi)ected that the assistance of other collaborators will soon be secured, 
a result which is greatly to be desired, in view of the large amount of 
original material from recent explorations now contained in our store- 
rooms. 

The accessions made to the collection number 5(5, an increase of 10 
over last year. The most important one, from the standpoint of the 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRKTARY. 165 

exbibitiou series, consists of a large number of beautiful preparations 
obtained by ])urchaso from the /.()()lo,iii<'al station at Xa])les, Italy. 
These will add an interest inf>- feature to the display collection, as the 
specimens are chietly soft and delicate organizations, whi(;h few Jnive 
learned the art of i)reservinji,' in a manner at all presentable to the gen- 
eral public. Many groups are represented. From the I'. S. Fish Com- 
mission have been received the collection of actinians made during the 
voyage of the steamer .4. /ia/ross from Xorfolk to San Francisco, and 
described by Prof, J. Playfair McMurrich, and a series of crustaceans 
resulting chietly from recent explorations of the same vessel in the 
North Pacific Ocean. 

jVIr. W. L. Abbott has contributed a tine series of crustaceans, echin- 
oderms, corals, and sponges from the Indian Ocean; llev. H. Loomis, 
of Yokohama, crustaceans, echinoderms, and hydroids from Jai)an; 
Mr. Lewis Dexter, U. S. consul at Fayal, crustaceans, worms, and echin- 
oderms from the Azores; Mr. H. R. Saunders, of Nassau, Xew Provi- 
dence, 7() siiecimens of commercial sponges, representing the ditferent 
Bahama grades; and Mr. Harlan I. Smith, many crayfishes and other 
fresh-water crustaceans from Ohio and Michigan. Other collections 
which also deserve mention here are specimens of crustaceans and 
leeches from the fresh waters of Mexico, presented by Mr. P. L. Jouy; 
crustaceans and worms obtained in Nicaragua by ]Mr. Uharles W. Pich- 
mond; bird parasites from Mr. Walter Brett, of Lakeport, Cal. ; blind 
crayfishes, including a new variety, from caves in Indiana, presented 
by Mr. W. P. Hay; microscopic slides of fresh-water crustaceans from 
Wisconsin, contributed by Prof. C. Dwight Marsh; crustaceans and 
worms collected in East Africa, from Mr. Wdliam Astor Chanler; and 
a number of starfishes and ophiurans from Canterbury Museum, Christ- 
church, New Zealand. While the remaining accessions are of smaller 
size than those above mentioned, containing only one or a few spec- 
imens each, they add altogether many interesting features to our 
collections. 

The completion of the repairs in the west hall of the Sn)ithsonian 
Institution during the summer of 1892 permitted the temporary cov- 
erings of the cases to be removed, and steps were at once taken to 
place the display collection in presentable condition, in order that the 
room might be reopened to the jjublic. This was soon accomplished, 
but not without considerable work and a general overhauling of the 
specimens. At the beginning of the repairs, the large wall cases 
which surrounded the hall were boarded over and covered with a 
sloping metal top, which it was supposed would i)revent the entrance 
of any moisture. Considering, therefore, that no harm could come to 
them, the stony and large gorgonian corals, the sponges, and some of 
the other groups were allowed to retain their ])laces upon the shelves, 
as no other safe means of storing them could be provided. This sup- 
posed ])rotection, however, proved entirely inadequate, and when the 



166 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

cases were tiiially uncovered it was observed that much damage had 
been occasioned by the raiu. Tlie sponges and gorgouiaus were covered 
thick with mold, and the glue used to repair many of the branching 
stony corals had become softened, allowing the different pieces to fall 
apart. 

Before winter the exhibition room had been restored to its previous 
condition.but any iniin'ovement or increase in the disi)lay collection had 
to be temporarily deferred in consequence of the necessity of beginning 
preparations for the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago. 

The renewal of alcohol on the large collection now possessed by this 
department, the cataloguing of new accessions, and the continuation 
of the card or systematic catalogue as specimens are identified, have 
occupied much of the time of Mr. Benedict and Miss Eathbuu, and, 
notwithstanding the crowded condition of the storeroom, it can be said 
that the entire collection has been maintained in good condition 
throughout the year. 

Not taking into account the very small organisms, which it is impos- 
sible to enumerate, the number of specimens received by the depart- 
ment has been 2,090. The entries made in the serial catalogue books 
have been as follows :

Mr. Benedict, the assistant curator of the department, has continued 
during the year his work upon the large family l*((guri(la\ or hermit 
crabs, of which he is preparing a complete mouograi^h, the same being 
now well under way. He has also spent much time in a study of the 
larger forms of anomura of the Pacific Ocean, belonging to other 
groui^s than the above, and has classified the sponges recently' collected 
in the North Pacific, by a microscopic examination of their spicules, in 
order that the dilferent groups may be sent to specialists for study. 

The following paj^ers by ]\Iiss llathbun, completed during this period, 
have been submitted for publication in the Proceedings: "Catalogue 
of the Crabs of the family MalUlw in the U. S. National Museum;" 
"Descrijitions of new genera and species of crabs from the west coast 
of North America and the Sandwich Islands," based chiefly upon 
material recently collected by the steamer Albatross; and " Descrip- 
tions of new species of American fresh-water crabs." She has also 
completed the identification of the collection of Brachynra made in the 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 167 

Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea by the steameT Albatro.sa since tbe spring 
of 1888, with the object of preparing- a catalogue of the same, baving 
special reference to tbe fauna' of tbe lishing grounds, for publication 
by the Fisb Commission. 

The following specimens have also been identified, namely, the 
Abbott collection of crabs from the Indian Ocean, the invertebrates 
fnmi Japan, contributed with a request for names by Kev. H. Loomis, 
both mentioned among the accessions, and a collection of crustaceans 
belonging to the Provincial jMuseum of Victoria, Britisb Columbia, 
transmitted for examinati(m and report. 

The sponges belonging to the family MexactindUdw, collected in the 
Pacific Ocean by the steamer Albatross, have been sent to Prof. F. E. 
Scliulze, of Berlin, the well-known authority on this subject, who is 
now i)reparing a complete revision of the group. He will also submit 
a special paper for the Museum Proceedings, describing the specimens 
supplied from here. Similar arrangements have been made with Dr. 
Axel Goes, of Sweden, to work up the foraminifera collected by the 
same vessel in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Pacific Ocean ; 
and with Dr. John Murray, of Edinburgh, Scotland, to study the deep- 
sea deposits obtained by the Albatross and other United States ves- 
sels. The collections have accordingly been shipped to them. These 
same experts reported upon the corresponding subjects in the exten- 
sive series of volumes covering Ihe results of the voyage of H. M. S. 
Challenffcr, and the Museum is therefore fortunate in securing their 
cooperation at this time. 

Prof. Walter Faxon, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Har- 
vard Uiuversity, has continued to identify the crayfishes received from 
time to time by this department, and Dr. C. W. Stiles, of the Agricul- 
tural Department, has undertaken to study the intestinal parasites, 
which have now been set aside for his examination. 

The Fish Commission steamer Albatross has been employed during 
the past year chiefly in connection with the sealing investigations in 
the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, but she has also had the 
opportunity of doing some dredging work in the same region, from 
which important collections of natural history were obtained. Some 
of these have already been turned over to the National ^Museum. The 
natural-history work of the steamer Fish Raid- has been confined 
mostly to the oj^ster beds of Long Island Sound and Chesapeake Bay, 
and that of the schooner Grampus to surface towing and fishing off 
the New England coast, and to an investigation of the habits of the 
mackerel during the spring migrations. Mr. Benedict took ])art in 
the examination of the oyster beds in Long Island Sound, and through 
his own efforts was enabled to secure a much larger series of the 
smaller animals desired by the Museum than would otherwise have 
been obtained. 

The duplicate specimens belonging to the regular Series No. IV, 



168 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

which have been disnibuted to institutions of learuiiijj- duriug several 
years })ast, are now nearly exhausted, ouly a few sets still remaining. 
The following schools and collegers were supplied duriug the year: 
State Normal School, Oshkosh, Wis.; Clark University, Atlanta, Ga.; 
Columbia College, Van Allstyne, Tex.; Grammar School, Salem, Mass. 
A large general collection of marine invertebrates, representing mainly 
the dredging work of the Fish Commission, was also sent to the Impe- 
rial University, Moscow, Eussia. and smaller collections were distributed 
as follows: Anomuran crustaceans to the Museum of Comparative 
Zoology at Harvard University; hermit crabs to Leland Stanford 
Junior University and the University of California; miscellaneous 
specimens to Clark University, Atlanta, Ga. ; University of Georgia, 
Athens, Ga.; Normal School, Hampton, Ya.; and Miss Mary Y, Wors- 
tell. New York City; two species of sea urchins to Prof. Cuenot, Nancy, 
France; edible crustaceans to the Museum of Hygiene, Washington, 
through Dr. Howard E. Ames, U. S. Navy; echinoderms to Prof. A. J. 
Woolman, South Bend, Ind. ; foraminiferato Smith College, Northamp- 
ton, Mass., and Prof. E. R. Boyer, Englewood, 111. 

Collections were also sent to the following authorities for study and 
report, as mentioned elsewhere: To Prof. F. E. Schulze, Berlin, Ger- 
many, the hexactineliid sponges collected by the steamer Alb((fross in 
the Pacific Ocean, between 1SS7 and ISDO; to Dr. Axel Goes, Liidcoping, 
Sweden, a large collection of foraminifera from the Caribbean Sea, 
Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific Ocean, obtained mostly by the steamer 
Alh((tross; to Dr. John Murray, Edinburgh, Scotland, a large series of 
deep-sea soundings, representing the character of the bottom in dif- 
ferent oceans, and collected by the steamer Albatross and other explor- 
ing vessels of the United States; to Prof. Walter Faxon, Cambridge, 
Mass., the specimens of crayfishes recently received by the Museum. 

The exhibit from this department at the World's Fair consisted of 
a synoptic series, showing by means of sjx'cimens, models, drawings 
and explanatory labelsj important forms and anatomical details of the 
orders of invertebrates, contained in the groups Protozoa, Porlfera, 
Ccelcnterata, Vermes, and Echlnodermata. 

Marine invertebrates. A systematic series of specimens of marine invertebrates

was ill Chicago during about lour weeks in Aj)iil and May, arranging 
tlie eollections sent by this dei)artnient, and otherwise assisting in the 
preparation of the National Museum exhibit. 

DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATI VK ANATOMY. 

The time of the acting curator, Mr. F. A. Lucas, has been chiefly 
spent in the jireparatioii and instalhition of material for the World's 
Columbian Exposition and in preparing copy for the numerous labels, 
especially the somewhat lengthy descriptive labels for that portion of 
the synoptic series of invertebrates there shown. 

There have been few important accessions, the most noteworthy 
being a comparatively complete skeleton of the extinct Steller's Sea 
Cow {Rliytina SteUeri), received through the instrumentality of Prof. B. 
W. Evermann, of the U. S. Fish Commission. Dr. W. L. Abbott sent 
4 skeletons of cetaceans {rroiMphimis) from the Indian Ocean, and 
also a fine example of the Aldabra Tortoise ( Testudo elephantina). An 
important series of skulls of African mammals, collected by Mr. H. C. 
Moore, is mentioned in the report of the curator of mammals. A fine 
old male ]\Iountain Goat {Mazama americana) was procured from Mr. 
Allen Eupert. 

A series of Sandwich Islands birds in spirits was secured by purchase 
and gift from Mr. Scott i>. Wilson, and it is hoped that a study of 
these may throw a little light on the relationship of the avifauna of 
those islands. 

Attention has been given to tilling up gaps in the exhibition series, 
the additions being forms representing families, or important divisions 
of families. The general exhibition series of mammal skeletons is now 
fairly full, but few important forms being needed, while a limited num- 
ber of pieces might perhaps be witlidrawn. Many additions are neces- 
sary to the series of birds, while the collection of skeletons of fishes is 
very incomplete. The number of mounted skeletons is designedly 
restricted, as the distinctive features of various groups can be more 
clearly shown by a moderate than by a large number of specimens. On 
the other hand, the study series can not be too large, for only by large 
series of specimens can the relationships of species and the amount of 
individual variation be determined. 

Among the series supplementing the general collection of skeletons, 
and illustrating various jxnnts of anatomy and morphology, that show- 
ing the homologies of the i)rincipal bones was complet<'d for the Chicago 
Exposition. 

Among the projected seiies is one showing some of the modifications 
of tlie skeleton for oflCense or defense, one to illustrate the mori)hology 
of the hyoid ami branchial arches, and one to show the relations of the 
bones of the ear. 

Work on the study series has been mainly confined to such rearrange- 
ment of material as has been rendered necessarv bv the steadv growth 



170 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 



of the collections. Owing to the lack of storage room it frequently hap- 
pens that specimens are temporarily placed wherev^er space can be 
found for tlieni and rearranged when room can be made available. 

Mr. Lucas has been unable to devote any time to special researches, 
but the skulls of bears and of far seals have been carefully studied by 
Dr. C. Hart Merriam, the latter in connection with the ju'esentation of 
the case of the United States in the Bering Sea question. 

The curator submits the following statement of the condition of the 
collections: 

The comlition of the collectious is good; the increase, as indicated by the cata- 
logues, is as follows :

This total included museum specimens withdrawn for exhibition at the World's 
Columbian Exposition, but not those which have been purchased especially for that 
purpose. 

In the World's Fair exhibit from this department an effort has been 
made to illustrate the methods adopted by the Museum to render the 
exhibition of anatomical material instructive and attractive. To this 
end the material exhibited comprised several fully labeled series, illus 
trating various points of morphology or structure, grouped under the 
following heads: 

(1) HOMOLOGIE.S OF THE PRINCIPAL BOXE.S IN THE V.\RI()US CLASSES OF VER- 
TEBRATES. 

(a) General homologies. — Mounted skeleton of a man and a horse* 
having the principal bones of each labeled. Mounted and disarticulated 
skeletons of cat, crow, turtle, iguana, frog, and fish arranged in cases 
side by side, the disarticulated skeletons having the principal bones 



Illustrated in Plate 30.

labeled, tlius iciuloring' it possible to recogiii/.e the coiTespondiiigr bones 
of eai'li almost at a glance. 

(h) ISpecial homologies; the shnll. — Sknlls of sturgeon, gar i)ike, 
grouper, nienoponia, frog, boa constrictor, turtle, alligator, penguin, 
goat, and puma, liaviug tbe correspouding bones similarly colored. 
While this plau is not uew, special attention was given to securing a 
harmonious color scheme, and the smaller skulls were represented by 
accurately enlarged models, thus showing details that would otherwise 
have been invisible. 

{(■) Special homoJo</ic.s; ihr Intih.-i. — Articulated limbs of grouper, sea 
turtle, alligator, eagle, and dog, having the larger bones labeled and 
the smaller bones numbered, the specimens being accompanied by cor- 
respondingly numbered labels giving* the names of the various bones 
of the wrist and aidile. Limbs of fish, sea turtle, manatee, cormorant, 
great auk, sloth, bat, monkey, and man, showing the homologies of 
limbs specially modified for various nu'thods of locomotion, JNIauus 
and i)es of a horse, camel, moose, tapir, seal, bear, and lion, with the

DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS (PALEOZOIC). 

The honorary curator, Mr. C. D. Walcott, has been obliged to devote 
his time almost exclusively to work connected Avith the U. 8. Geological 
Survey. The department cooperated with the Survey in the prepara- 
tion of an exhibit for the World's Columbian Exposition. Such time 
as could be spared to laboratory work was given to the preparation of 
a collection to be exhibited at the World's Columbian Exi)osition. A 
description of this exhibit is given at the close of this report. 

The year's work upon the collections was mainly in the direction of 
working out and putting in condition for study the collections that had 
previously been made by the Geological Survey. Over 200 drawers of 
Upper Cambrian fossils have been worked up, preparatory to study in 
connection with the preparation of a monograph on the Upper Cam- 
brian fauna. A large number of Middle Cambrian fossils were received 
from the field, cleaned, and record numbers entered upon them. None 
of this material, liowever. was transferred to the National Museum, as 
1 thought it desirable to complete the study of the same before trans- 
mitting it. 

In the laboratory, attention was given to painting the record numbers 
on the specimens belonging to the accessions, and to the recording' of 
material which will be transferred from the Geological Survey as soon 
as the work upon it is completed. 

The publications of the year based on Museum material are noticed 
in the Bibliography. 

The catalogue numbers taken up were from 24153 to 24311, both 
inclusive. About 1,200 specimens have been added to the collection. 

Owing to the pressure of other work, a number of the recent acces- 
sions to the Museum exhibition series have not yet been entered, but 
special instructions have been given to attend to this matter early in 
the next fiscal year. 

Among- the most interesting additions were the collections made by 
Mr, Walcott. One hundred and fifty specimens of fossils of the Oriskany 
formation, at Cumberland. Md., and 100 specimens of Lower Devonian 
corals, from Genesee County, N. Y., from the Geological Survey. Also a 
large collection of 325 individual crinoids, together with 12 magnificent 
crinoid slabs from the Lower Carboniferous at Crawfordsville, Ind., from 
Charles E. Bcecher, Yale College, New Haven, Conn. Dr. A. L. Bene- 
dict, of Buffalo, N. Y., sent 24 specimens of fossils (tharacteristic of the 
water-limestone of Buffalo, and L. W. Stuart, Monmouth, Iowa, a con- 
siderable collection of Niagara fossils from jMonniouth, Iowa. 

It was decided that the Museum should unite with the U. S. Geolog- 
ical Survey in the preparation of a paleontological exhibit for the 
World's Columbian Exposition. A large number of specimens belong- 



174 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

ing to the Survey were used for tbis j)uri)()se, and a number came from 
tbe collections of the Museum. All of the material has now, however, 
been transferred to the custody of the latter, and is now on exhibi- 
tion in the Department of Geology. 

The principal feature of the exhibit was the collection of characteris- 
tic fossils and rocks arranged stratigraphically. This contained about 
1,850 species (probably G,000 specimens) of fossils, and 543 rocks. There 
were also exhibited a restored skeleton of Dinoceras mirahile, 4 large 
slabs with Liiigula, Protichnites, ClimachHcJmites, and Dactyloidifes, 2 
large casts of Orthoceras, 1 large specimen of Bacidites grandis, 1 large 
special case containing showy specimens of Criuoids, Trilobites, Euryp- 
terus, Ammonites, Corals, etc., and 2 special cases of showy fossil 
plants, principally Carboniferous, with a few from the Cretaceous and 
Tertiary. 

DEPARTMENT OF MESOZOIC FOSSILS. 

Comparatively little work has been done in this department during 
the past year. Owing to the fact that its personnel is only nominally 
or incidentally connected with the Museum, it has been impracticable 
to devote much more time to it than the most imperative of the routine 
forms required. This work has been mainly confined to the examina- 
tion of and report upon accessions, and to the transference of certain 
collections to the Museum from the U. S. Geological Survey. 

The most important accessions to the Museum through this depart- 
ment are those received from the Survey. Among these are the type 
specimens of fossils which have formed the basis of Bulletin No. 100 of 
the Geological Survey, of which Mr. T. W. Stanton is the author. This 
collection embraces 179 type specimens, all of which are figured in that 
bulletin. 

During the past year the entries in the record book of this depart- 
ment have ranged from 22,170 to 22,959. There have been catalogued 
6,440 specimens of fossils, 5,392 of which came from the U. S. Geological 
Survey, and 1,048 from all other sources. 

Dr. C. A. White, the honorary curator, has during the past year been 
engaged in the preparation of a work upon the Bear River formation 
of Wyoming and Idaho, which is largely of a paleontological character. 
This work is not yet published, and no work based upon the collections 
of this department has been published during the year. 

DEPARTMENT OF RECENT PLANTS. 

Dr. George Vasey, honorary curator and botanist of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, died March 4, 1893, after a long and faithful 
service in connection with the National Herbarium and with the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture.* Mr. Frederick V. Coville, his successor, 



* Notices of hie hie and scientific worli have been published in the Bulletin of the 
Torrey Botanical Club, vol. 20, 1893, pp. 218 to 220, and in the Botanical Gazette, 
vol. 18, 1893, pp. 170 to 183. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 1 75 

was appointod lionorary curator of the Dcpartiiiciit oC Botany in the 
National JMuseuni, March 28, 1893. 

During the past year, up to the time of liis deatli, Dr. Vasey was 
engaged upon researches in connection Avith a publication entitled 
"Monograph of the Grasses of the United States and JJritish America," 
basing his work upon the very full collection of Gramineae in the 
National Herbarium. The work on this subject was about four-fifths 
(;oniplet(Ml at the time of Dr. Vasey's death. The report on tlie botany 
of the Death Valley expedition, in preparation by Mr. Frederick V. 
Coville, was also continued during the first part of the present year 
and Avas finished in December, 1892. Work on the collecjtions made by 
Dr. Edward Palmer in western Mexico during the years 1890 to 1892 
was continued by Dr. J, N^. Rose. 

The Herbarium collection, which is deposited in the Department of 
Agriculture, consists of study and duplicate series only, no specimens 
having been prepared for exhibition purposes. In general the her- 
I)arium is in excellent condition, the system of classification being so 
carried out as to greatly facilitate access to the material contained 
in it. 

During the year about 33,000 specimens were received, involving 
567 catalogue entries. Specimens to the number of 14,308 were sent 
out as exchanges, and 4,117 mounted sheets were added to the Her- 
barium proper. 

Mr. Coville reports as follows upon the important accessions re- 
ceived during the year: 

A large collection of specimens from northwestern Idaho, collected by Dr. J. H. 
Saudberg and assistants. The whole collection contains 1,03.5 numbers. 

A collection of 168 numbers from Yakutat Bay, Alaska, made by Frederick Fun- 
eton during the summer season of 1892. These specimens are in excellent condition 
and excel in their value as specimens any collection heretofore received from 
Alaska. 

Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, captain, U. S. Army, has continued to send in collections 
made upon the International Boundary Commission (United States and Mexico), 
which, although not yet critically examined, will furnish material for a future 
report on the botauj^ of this region. 

Dr. H. E. Hasse of Soldiers' Home, Los Angeles County, Cal., has contributed a set 
of 255 specimeus from the southern ])ortion of the State of California. 

Mr. G. C. Nealley has continued his collections in Texas, having sent in about 1,650 
specimens from that State. 

Through Mr. P. A. Rydberg have been received a valuable collection from the 
Black Hills of South Dakota, containing about 2,500 specimens. 

From Dr. Edward Palmer has been received a collection of specimens from middle 
California in the vicinity of San Francisco Bay, and in the Sacramento and Sau 
Joaquin valleys. 

From Mr. J. W. Toumey, of Tucson, Ariz., was received a series of .■ii>ecinu'ns col- 
lected on a .journey from Tucson northward past San Francisco mountain to the 
Grand canyon of the Colorado and return. 

From Dr. E. F. Franchschi was purchased a collection of 21-1 plants from Attica, 
Greece, the specimens in by far the best condition of any yet received from Europe. 

From Mr. John Macoun, Ottawa, Canada, was purchased a set of 100 Canadian 
lichens ami 100 Canadian mosses. 



176 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

From Prof. C S. Craiidall, Fort Collins, Colo., has been reci-ive«l a collection of 
587 Colorado plants. 

From Mr. G. W. Lctterman, of Alleutowii, Mo., was received a small but interest- 
in<i and yaliiable collection consisting of 71 grasses of the genus Poa, collected at 
high altitudes in the Eocky Mountains of Colorado. 

From C. G. I'ringlc, of Charlotte, Vt., was purchased a collection of his plants of 
18!)2 from southern Mexico. 

From Dr. Franz Buchenau, of l^erlin, Germany, was recei\e(l a collection of Itil 
specimens of the genus Juncus. 

From Dr. H. H. L'usby, of New York City, a set of Miguel Jiang's ]?f)li\ian plants 
was received. 

Fascicles 8 and 9 of Mr. W. N. 8uksdorf's collections made in the .State of W ashiiig- 
ton have been acquired by purchase. 

M. C. Coi)ineau has sent in 260 specimens of French plants as an exchange. 

From Dr. B. L. Robinson was secured a set of 420 siiecimens collected by the late 
Mr. H. E. Seaton, of Cambridge, Mass., on Mount Orizaba, Mexico. 

In addition the first installments of severiil collections have been received from 
collectors which are more properly mentioned, together with the remainder of those 
collections, in the report for the succeeding year. 

Through the Smithsonian Institution has been received fromM. S. E. Lassiuiouue, 
of France, a collection of 200 specimens of plants from that country. 

From Baron Ferdinand a'ou Mueller, Melbourne, Australia, have been received 
several packages of Australian plants, in most cases new to the Herbarium. 

From Miss Elizabeth Taylor, of Troy, N. Y., were received a set of 115 specimens 
collected by herself in a journey down the Mclveuzie River, British America, during 
the season of 1892. 

From the U. S. Fish Commission was received a package of 650 specimens from 
the mainland and islands of Alaska, collected by Dr. B. W. Evermann. 

Ill addition to these specimeus many others, small in number but no 
less valuable in quality, have been received and incoriiorated in the 
Herbarium. 

DEPARTMENT OF FOSSIE PLANTS. 

The work of the year has been a continuation of that of the two 
preceding years, that is, the object kept constantly in mind has been 
"the arrangement of the specimens in such a manner as to facilitate 
their consultation and study." 

Prof. Lester F.Ward, of the Geological Survey, continues his services 
as honorary curator, and Prof. F. 11. Knowlton n-as reappointed assistant 
curator of this department in August. He was, however, only able to 
devote one-half of the time to this work for several months, but since 
December his whole time has been given to the ^Museum. Later by an 
arrangement madebetween the National Museum and the U.S. Geological 
Survey, Prof. F. H. Knowlton exchanged work with Mr. ]Javid White. 
The actual period of this exchange extended from November 28 to June 
27. During this i)erio<l Prof. Knowlton continued the revision of the 
flora of the Laramie group, mentioned in my last report, and at the 
end of the year he had settled the status of 241 species and had written 
about 450 i)ag<'s of the ])r('liminar>' manuscript. He has had prepared 
a large numlier of drawings to illustrate the new species, or those pos- 
sessing peculiar or curious features. The work thus far accomplished

rei)reseiits all but about L'.") ot tho species recorded in Lesquereux's 
Tertiary Flora. The whole liora of this group, as now known, will 
probably embrace about 350 species, and when completed it will repre- 
sent, it is thoujiht, one of the most satisfactory aids to geolof^y that 
has been atforded. 

Mr. AVhite's work for the Museum has been entirely on the great 
Lacoe collection, and at the end of the year about 125 boxes, weighing 
15,000 pounds, had been shi})ped to Washington. As the magnitude 
and value of this collection was stated at length in the report for last 
year, it is unnecessary to again refer to it. The larger part of this 
donation has now been labeled and sent to Washington, but much 
remains, especially in the way of duplicates It is probable that a fur- 
ther arrangement will be perfected whereby Mr. White will be enal)led 
to complete the transfer. 

No especially important accessions have been made during the year, 
the lots received being either single specimens or small collections from 
limited areas. The Museum has, however, obtained by purchase a very 
fine series of fossil cycadean trunks from Lower Cretaceous strata near 
Hot Springs. South Dakota. They are six in number, and range from 
10 inches in length and G inches in diameter, to over 3 feet in length 
and 2 feet in diameter. The finest specimen, which weighs 721 pounds, 
is undoubtedly the largest example of the kind ever found. The speci- 
mens have been photographed in various positions, and will be made 
the subject of a special monograph. 

The routine work in arrangement and classification of the collections 
has been of the same nature as in several previous jears. We had 
constructed in the west tower-room a large storage-case, capable of 
accommodating about 500 3-inch unit trays. The entire miscellane- 
ous Carboniferous collection, which is being studied l)y Mr. White, 
was jjut in this case, and the room on the balcony floor reserved for the 
Mesozoic and Tertiary iilants. Five quarter-unit table cases were also 
placed in the west tower room, and the Avhole collection of fossil wood 
was placed in them. At the present time everything in the department 
is perfectly accessible. This condition is only brought about, however, 
by storing in the Armory building all that can not l)e accommodated 
in the cases. This arrangement, wliile probably the best that the 
present division of space will admit of, often causes serious inconven- 
ience, as collections or specimens desired for study or comparison are 
in storage. When the great Lacoe collection is installed, the need of 
additional space will T)e nnn*li greater than now. 

Prof. Ward's work during the year has been practically a continua- 
tion of that recorded as in hand in his last report. He has continued 
the exploration of the Potomac formation, both in the innnediate vicinity 
of Washington and below Richmoml, Va., with the result of discover- 
ing a number of new plant beds, from which a large nund)er of new 
and interesting plants were obtained. The specimens from the Potomac

have come from Alabama, Virginia, the District of Columbia. ^Nlary-

jtrobably as complete a flora as that known for any formation. The 
results of their study will be embodied in a work on the correlation of 
the Cretaceous plants, now in preparation. 

Besides the work of revision above mentioned, Prof. Knowlton has 
also studied collections and made reports as follows: lie-examination of 
the fossil plants at Silver Cliff, Colo. ; list of the plants of the Post-Lara- 
mie beds of Colorado; report on a collection of fossil plants from Ellens- 
burg, Wash. ; report on fossil plants obtained by J. S. Diller in western 
Washington ; report on two species of fossil plants fiom ( )regon ; identi- 
fication of a collection of fossil i)Iants from the auriferous gravels of 
California, obtained by H. W. Turner; report on the bearing of the fossil 
plants of the auriferous gravels on the tjuestion of the temperature and 
elevation at the time of their deposition; determination of fossil plants 
collected by W. H. Weed in the Crazy Mountains on Big Timber Creek, 
Park County, Mont. ; report on collection of fossil plants from Cookville, 
Utah; report on fossil i^lants from Huefano Park, Colorado, as well as 
numerous reports relating to accessions received by the Museum. 

Prof. William M. Fontaine, of the University of Virginia, has studied 
and made an elaborate report on a collection of plants from the Trinity 
rocks near Glen Kose, Tex. He has determined no less than 23 species, 
of which number 6 are new to science. His paper, illustrated by 8 plates, 
is published in the proceedings of the National Museum. 

The last catalogue entry in June, 1892, is 555. 

The last catalogue entry in -Tune, 1893, is 581. 

Total number of specimens added to the collection during the year 
is estimated at 2,000. 

DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS. 

Prof. Clarke reports that apart from the usual routine little Mas done 
in the department except to i)repare, pack, and install its share of the 
exhibit made by the Museum at the World's Columbian Exposition. 
To that work all else was subordiimted. The preparation of the crys- 
tallographic series for Chicago, by Mr. W. S. Yeates, involved the care- 
ful measurement and description of a large number of characteristic 
crystals, representing many mineral S})ecies. The data thus obtained 
appear upon the printed labels of the specimens, whicli have thus 
acquired new value for the jjernianent collection. Toward the end of 
April Mr. Ideates went to Chicago to install the collection ; l)ut early 
in May he resigned as assistant curator, to become State geologist of 
Georgia, and the work of installation was completed by ^Ir. Wirt Tassiu 
and the Curator. The collection shown at the Exp<»sition lilled 2 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 179 

Liveii)()ol casos and 4 slope-top cases, and consisted entirely of choice, 
selected characteristic material. For the time being-, of course, the 
exhibition series in Washington was i>erceptibly weakened. 

Durin.i;- the year ."US entries were made in the catalogue of the depart- 
ment, representing ~)7\) specimens. Of these a considerable number 
were bought with reference to exhibition at Chicago, especially a fine 
group of representative gems from Amelia County, Va., a superb series 
of crystallized sulphurs from Sicily, and a suite of anglesite crystals 
fi'om Monteponi, Sardinia. Some remarkable Sicilian selenites and 
celestites, and the gToui)S of tiuorites from the Wilcox collection were 
also obtained in this way. 

By gift, little was received during the year. The most notable 
accession of this kind was a series of 7 cut turquoises and 1 specimen 
of turquoise in the matrix,, presented by the American Turquoise Com- 
pany, of Xew York. The exchanges also were few in nundxn". Six- 
teen specimens of miscellaneous minerals were thus obtained from jMr. 
E. E. Howell, and 51 sj)ecimens, all of European origin, were received 
from Prof. P. Groth, of Munich, in return for a collection previously 
sent to him. Still another exchange collection came from Prof. A. 
Brezina, of Vienna, but it was not catalogued during the year covered 
by this report. 

When the (;ollections now in Chicago shall have been returned to 
Washington, the incorporation of the new material obtained into the 
permanent series will involve a general reorganization of the exhibition 
hall. Much old nmterial will be retired to the study and duplicate 
series, to make room for new and finer specimens. Until that work 
has been done, no satisfactory census of the mineral collection can be 
made. 

The last catalogue entry of the preceding year, June 30, ISOli, was 
No. 80()40. The last entry of the present year, June 30, 1893, is ^o. 
80991. 

KXIIIUIT OF MINKKAL.S AT THE WOKLD'S COLUMBIAN EXrOSITIOX. 

The exhibit consisted of minerals, gems, and semi-precious stones, 
illustrating the principles of crystallography and those physical prop- 
erties of minerals which apply to the eye, and included the following 
series : 

Crystallography and the physical projierties of minerals. 

A series of crystallized minerals (with the i)riiicip:il forms in models of wood) to

A general series, arranged in the order of their intrinsic value. 
A series of American gems and semi-precious stones. 



180 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

DEPARTMENT OF OEOLOGY, 

A very large portion of the year was devoted by Prof. George P. 
Merrill, the curator, and his assistants, to the preparation of an exhibit 
for the Columbian Exposition, a general outline of which was given in

At the beginning of the fiscal year the curator was in southwest 
Missouri searching for materials to illustrate cave phenomena. This 
work was interrupted by leave of absence from July 8 to August 1, to 
be resumed again at a later date. On August IS the curator returned 
to Washington. The materials collected during these trips are noted 
under the head of "important accessions." Mr.W. H. Kewhall, assist- 
ant, made in November a trip to Weyer's and Fcmntain caves in Vir- 
ginia, and obtained a fine series of i)roducts from these sources, M'hich 
are also mentioned under the head of accessions. Our thanks are due 
to the managers of these caverns, as well as to those of Luray, Mam- 
moth, Wyandotte, ^Marengo, Percy and llobertson's, for the lively inter- 
est manifested and the assistance afforded in procuriug as fine a series 
as possible both for the Columbian Exi)ositi(»n and for the Museum. 
We are also greatly indebted for assistance of a high order to Prof. 
W.O.Crosby, of the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology, and to Mr. 
F. W. Crosby, of this city. Prof. Crosby was instrumental in i^rocuring 
a large i)roportion of our series of glacial products, and to the enthusi- 
asm of Mr. F. W. Crosby we owe a large and exceptionally fine series of 
Sicilian sulphurs and associated rocks and minerals, volcanic bombs 
from Lipari, and other materials elsewhere note<l. From April 15 to 
May 15 the curator was in Chicago, eugagcd in the work of installing 
the exhibit there. 

Below is given a list of the more im[)ortant accessions of the year: 

A series of typical iron ores froui S;iuti;ig(). Cuba. Gift of the Sigua Ir<ui Com- 
pany. 

A collection of asphalts and assorted roc i<s from Trinidad, (iift of Mr. Clidord

The character of the routine work lias varied but little from that of 
previous years. Especial effort was made in phmuing the World's 
Fair exhibit to so arrange the labels that, when returned to Washing- 
ton, it could be made to fill a definite place in our regular system of 
installation. Thus, excepting that it was impossible to devote a large 
portion of the time to a preparation of the three exhibits there 
included, and to work them out in considerable detail, almost no 
departure was made from ordinary museum methods, and but little 
labor actually lost. Copy for 1,175 labels was sent to the printer and 
1,301 printed forms received. 

A large proportion of the routine work of this department consists 
in the examination of geological material transmitted to the Museum 
for this purpose. During the year 130 packages of this character 
were examined and reported upon. The total number of packages of 
material of ;ill kinds received during the vear for examination was 516, 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 185 

and it is tlieretbie evident that this department has its full share of 
tliis kind of Avoik, A detailed list of the receipts of this character 
will be found in Appendix v. 

It may be observed that altliousih this class of work is reco<;nized as a 
regular part of the duties devolving- upon the officers of the Museum, 
and is always promptly i)erformed, it is probable that no work under- 
taken by the Museum produces less beneficial results to itself. The 
jMuseum can not charge for making these examinations, and it rarely 
happens that any of the material transmitted has any value for addi- 
tion to the collections. 

The fact that the collections are now divided, a portion being iu Chi 
cago, renders it impossible to give accurate figures regarding the num- 
ber of specimens either iu the reserve, exhibition, or duplicate series. 
The clerical force of the department has not been sufficient to keep the 
records in shape to furnisli this information otherwise than by an 
actual count. The accumulation of material has been greater than 
during any equal space of time since Mr. Merrill's connection with the 
department. The amount of new material tliat has been actually added 
to the Museum collections can, however, be scarcely in excess of that 
withdrawn for the World's Columbian Exposition. The catalogue num- 
bers for the fiscal year run from 00,001 to 00,927, inclusive, and from 
68.050 to 68,471, inclusive. 

As during the "^'ear previous, Mr. Merrill has been assisted by Mr. 
W. H.Xewhall, to whose energy, states the curator, is due much of the 
progress made.

v.— ADMINISTRATION. 

REVIEW OF THE WORK OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAl'S. 
OFFICE OF THE CHIEF CLERK. 

The chief clerk's office remains under tlie supervision of Mr. W. V. 
Cox. The duties belonging to this office are mainly of an executive or 
administrative character. Among these duties are the general super- 
vision of the expenditure of the appropriations; the preparation of 
proposals for supplies or labor; the opening of bids; awards of con- 
tracts; issuing orders for the purchase of supplies and employment of 
labor; the settling of accounts; the suj)ervisiou of correspondence 
other than that of a scientific nature, or of that relating to specimens; 
the general supervision over employes and their assignment to duty; 
the granting of leaves of absence and other matters aflecting the per- 
sonnel of the Museum; the issuing of passes to the buildings; the 
conducting of boards of inquiry, inspection, and survey ; the investiga- 
tion of complaints, etc. 

In Ai)pendix ii to this report a statement is i)resented showing the 
disposition of the unexpended balance on hand at the close of the year 
ending June 30, 1892. This is followed by a statement indicating the 
disbursements on account of the appropriation for the year ending 
June 30, 1893. 

Since his last annual report, the chief clerk, the superintendent ol 
buildings and labor, and the property clerk have had much of their time 
and that of their force occupied in the preparation of exhibits for the 
Columbian Historical Exposition in Madrid, and the World's Colum- 
bian Exposition at Chicago. Yet the extra work incident to the many 
additional retiuisitions made, and orders issued for supplies required 
to be purchased, together with tlie work to be done in the shops of the 
IMuseum by reason of these preparations, were all attended to by the 
regular employes, without additional cost to the Exposition, notwith- 
standing the fact that ever}' purchase of supplies thus made and every 
order for work required the stating of a bill, and also involved a large 
amount of other incidental work. In the office of the chief clerk 600 
vouchers, aggregating more than ■'^78,000, were stated and otlierwise coni- 
pleted for settlement, and transmitted to the Board of Managers for 
payment. To perfoiin this amount of extra labor the clerks were com- 
pelled to devote longer hours to their duties. 

CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS. 

This division of the administrative work remains under the charge 
of Mr. K. I. Geare. At the beginning of the year the force consisted 
of 2 stenographers, 1 accession clerk, 1 record clerk, 1 index clerk, 3 
typewriters and a messenger.

188 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

The amount of correspondence has hirgely increased each year since 
the establishment of this division. In 18SG, the total number of official 
papers prepared for signature was a little over 2,000. In the year 
covered by this report the total was 10,040. The reason for this growth 
is readily explained. Every letter asking for information is answered 
as promptly as possible, and the information, if obtainable, is always 
supplied. Tlie fact that requests of all kinds are thus noticed, soon 
spreads among the acquaintances of the writers, and before long they 
also are led to correspond with the Museum on some subject in regard 
to which they may desire information. Another reason for the large 
increase this year is that since May, 1892, the distribution of Museum 
publications has been added to the work of this office, necessitating a 
large number of letters on matters relating to the subject of Museum 
publications. 

The correspondence of the Museum also includes letters pertaining 
to the acquisition of specimens, and to their acknowledgment when 
received; also letters reporting the results of examination of material 
submitted for qualitative analyses. 

The preparation and general supervision of the proof of the Annual 
Eeport of the ]Museum is also a part of the work which has been 
assigned to this division. 

Distribution of Museum publications. — The edition of the Proceedings 
and Bulletin is entirely inadequate to supply the numerous demands 
made upon it, and in order that the edition might be increased, an 
estimate of §18,000 for printing was made for the year ending June 30, 
1892, an increase of $8,000 over the appropriation for the preceding 
fiscal year. The amount granted by Congress, however, was only 
$15,000. For the present fiscal year the sum of $18,000 was again 
asked for. The following extract from a letter accompanying the 
estimate will show how urgently this appropriation is needed : 

The Slim of $18,000 was asked for last year, for the purpose of cularjjjiug the 
mailing list so as to include in it the more important public libraries and educa- 
tional institutions, and to render it possible, in response to urgent requests, to send 
the publications of the Museum to individuals who need them for use in connection 
with scientific investigations. The sum appropriated ($15,000) enabled the Museum 
to enlarge considerably its mailing list, but the full amount estimated for will be 
necessary to insure a satisfactory distribution. 

The amount carried by the appropriation bill, as passed by Congress, 
however, was $12,000, and as a necessary consequence, this branch 
of the ^luseum work has been much crij^pled. 

The report for 1890 was distributed during the year. Coi^ies have 
been forwarded to all individuals and institutions upon the mailing 
lists for ^luseum reports, to the consular and other officers of the Gov- 
ernment who have cooperated with the Museum, and to persons who 
contributed to the collections during the fiscal year covered by that 
report. Editions of 500 copies each of several ethnological papers 
included in thereportsfor ISOOand 1S91 liave been sent out. The four- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 189 

teeiitli volume of the Proceediuiis of the National Museum lias been 
mailed to all addresses upon the regular list for Proceedinfrs volumes, 
and to more than L'.OOO domestic and foreign libraries. Five hundred 
copies each of Proceedings Separates, Nos. 887 to Klo, 1H9, 020, !)22 to 
92(>, !I2S, 92!), U'M, and advance copies of No. 944: have been sent to 
recipients upon the regular mailing-lists and to persons making special 
application. Tarts F and G of Bulletin 39, and Bulletin 40, have been 
distributed, and i)arts A to (1, inclusive, of the former have been sent 
to all institutions upon the f(n-eign and domestic library lists. Special 
Bulletin No. 1, entitled ''Life Histories of North American Birds," by 
Major Charles Bendire, has been distributed. In addition to the regu- 
lar distribution of ^Museum publications, more than l.r)00 si)eeial send- 
ings have been made during the year. 

REGISTRATION AND DISTRIP.TTION. 

Mr. S. C. Brown, registrar, states that the total luimber of packages 
of all kinds received during the year was 29,409. The entries covering 
these receipts number 2,830, 863 of these packages containing speci- 
mens for the Museum, the others consisting of exchanges, supplies, 
etc. The record of outgoing packages for the year embraced 1,315 
entries, covering 3,309 boxes and 902 packages, of which S^h] contained 
si)ecimcns from the Museum, sent out as exchanges, gifts, and loans; 
347 packages of specimens returned to owners, and 396 boxes con- 
tained material, exhibits, and cases sent to the Madi'id Exposition. 
During the mouths of March, April, and May the exhibits prepared for 
the World's Columbian Exposition were shipped to Chicago. There were 
1,340 packages of exhibits and cases transmitted by freight (twenty- 
six carloads), while packages containing the most valuable portions 
of the exhibits were forwarded by express. The storage record shows 
that 174 packages were stored and ."il were turned over to the curators. 

The total number of accessions, /. e.. lots of specimens received for 
the Museum during the year, was 1.226. In addition, 516 packages of 
specimens were received for exanunation and report. 

The records show that 13,581 specimens were sent out, including 
exchanges and specimens distiibuted to universities and colleges. 

COLLECTIONS TRAXSMl'l'TEI) To EDT'CATIOXAL ESTABLISUMENTS. 

It has for many years been customary to distribute to educational 
establishments, as far as j^racticable, the duplicate material contained 
in the collections of the National ]\Iuseum. Owing to the fact that there 
had accumulated a large number of applications for specimens from 
colleges and universities throughout the country, the curators of several 
of the departments were requested to separate into sets, for distribu- 
tion, such of the duplicates in their charge as might be available for 
this purpose. The time necessary for work of this character could, 



190 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 



however, be spared ouly with great iuconveiiieiiee, ou aceouut of the 
fact that the preparation of exhibits for the Workl's Cohimbian Exposi- 
tion (lemaiKk'd the greater part of the attention of the- curators. It is 
expected that witliin the course of a few months collections of iishes, 
marine invertebrates, and birds' skins will be ready for distribution. 
A number of sets of minerals, rocks, and ores, and casts of prehistoric 
stone implements have been already prepared. 

During the months of March and April, 1893, the work of distribu 
ting the collections of rocks and ores recently prepared by the curator 
of geology was undertaken, there being among the pending apidica- 
tious many requests for geological material. In a number of instances 
in which it was not apparent that the institution which had made the 
application was still in need of si)ecimens, a letter requesting informa- 
tion on this point was addressed to the Senator or Eepresentative who 
had indorsed the application. The reply in nearly every instance Avas 
to the effect that a collection would be acceptable. 

There have been distributed during the year loO collections of all 
kinds, including a large number of sets of minerals and rocks. 

GEOGKAPHICAL STATEMENT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIMENS DURING THE 
YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1893. 

In Appendix iii a geographical statement is given showing in detail 
the distribution of specimens of all kinds during the year. A brief

WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS. 

TAXIDKUMISTS. 

Mr. William Paluier, chief taxidermist, reports that a large pro])()rtiou 
of the tiuu' of his force has been devoted to completing aud installing the 
exhibits for the World's Columbiau Exposition. The actual work of 
mounting the specimens had already beeu finished, but the grouping of 
the pieces and the arrangement of the accessories remained to be done 
this year. Thirteeu-groups were prepared with great care, especial atten- 
tion being giveu to making their surroundings as natural as possible. 
Some progress has been made toward reducing the number of skins in 
pickle, and two new lead-lined tanks have been provided for the better 
accommodation of those which are still awaiting attention. Xumerous 
casts of various kinds ha ve been made, and other incidental work attended 
to. The number of skins received during the year was 206, the total 
on hand June 30, 1893, being 427; 271 skins have been worked up. 

About 30 si)ecimensof fowls and pigeons have been added to the series 
of domestic animals during the year. 

OSTKOLOCICAL rUKPARATORS. 

Mr. F. A. Lucas, in charge of this work, reports that the preparation

192 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

It may be stated tliat the labor involved in mounting the skulls is 
but partially indicated by the figures which appear in the table, since 
the mountings in most cases were complicated in their character and 
the component bones of the skulls were distinctively colored. In addi- 
tion to osteological work, there have been made 3 anatomical models, 
and 45 casts of reptiles, invertebrates, and coud)s and gills of domes- 
tic fowls. Besides this a group was completed, showing the common 
octopus and its surroundings, and a large number of specimens hav^e 
been mounted for the synoptic series of invertebrates. 

PHOTOC; ISA I'll KK. 

Mr. T. W. Smillie, tlie photographer, reports that 857 negatives and 
3,402 silver prints have been made during the year. A large propor- 
tion of these was for the departments of ethnology, mammals, geology, 
reptiles and batrachians, and prehistoric anthropology. 

In addition, 281 extra i)rints were mounted and 147 cyanotypes, 22 
lantern-slides, and 4 enlargements were made. 

The National Museum, as heretofore, has rendered assistance to the 
U. S. Fish Commission in photographic work, the Commissioner fur- 
nishing the material necessary, and one assistant to aid the photog- 
rapher. In this connection there were made G45 silver prints, 121

meet outstandiuii' liabilities. 

During the year the watch boxes, burglar alarms, time clocks and 
call-bell system were overhauled, and the unserviceable wire connected 
therewith removed. The latter was leplaced with okonite wire, nearly 
8,000 feet being required for this purpose. The telephone system has 
also been overhauled, the old wires having been removed and new 
ones substituted. Owing to the small appropriation for heating, light- 
ing, and electrical service, it was found necessary to reduce the number 
of telephones in service. This was reluctantly done, as the telephone 
has been very useful in taking the place of messengers.

APPENDIX IV. 

llriLDlNCS AM) LaBOK — POLICK AM) PUKLIC CoMFORT. 

The lollowiiiii' statement from the reeords of the SupeiinteiHleiit of 
Buildings is intended to indicate in a general \vay the character of the 
work iierformed by the mechanics and laborers during the year covered 
by this report : 

1892. 

Jidj. — The labor involved in packing and shipping exhibits for tlie Madrid Expo- 
sition consumed a large auionnt of time during the mouth. The tinner was engaged 
for several days in making necessary repairs to the roof of the Museum biiildiug. 
The valves connected with the steam-heatiug a]»i)aratus have been repacked and 
the radiators overhauled. 

August. — The lecture hall was cleaned and put in order after the completion of 
the work of preparing the exhibits for the Madrid Exposition. The windows of 
the east and west balconies were placed on pivots to provide better ventilation. 
The carpenters were engaged for a time in making packing cases for the shipment 
of exhibits to the \Vo:ld's Columbian Exposition. Considerable paving was done 
in the basement of the Museum building, and this necessitated the temporary 
removal of the material store 1 there. 

Scpteinhcr. — The buildings were suitably decorated on the occasion of the encamp- 
ment of the Grand Army of the Republic, and the laborers were busy for many days 
preparing for the reception of the crowds of persons visiting the buildings. The 
furniture and apparatus of the chemical laboratory connected with the U. S. Geo- 
logical Survey have been removed from the northeast pavilion, the Survey having 
found it necessary to make many changes on account of reduced appropriations. 

October. — Improv(?ments h.ave been made in the system of installation of the 
telephone and other electric wires. To increase the eflicieucy of the telephone serv- 
ice it was found necessary to remove a number of instruments about the buildings. 
Various improvements have been made in the laboratory of the department of mam- 
mals, in the department of prehistoric anthropology, and in the telephone room. 
The exhibition cases throughout the Museum were cleaned during the month. 

Xoreiiihcr. — A wagon shed was constructed south of the Smithsonian building. 
The exhiI)ition cases in the north hall of the Museum were rearranged, and a num- 
ber of specimens were withdrawn for transmission to the World's Fair. Work of a 
similar character in many of the departments demanded the attention of the 
laborers, and it was found necessary to use the lecture hall and several of the 
courts of the building for the preparation of exhibits. A workroom was fitted up 
for the use of the assistant curator of oriental antiquities. 

December. — A number of specimens were transferred from the north hall to the 
department of prehistoric anthropology. The shed south of the Smithsonian build- 
ing was painted, and also the hallway of the south tower. A number of storage- 
cases were removed from the northeast pavilion to the department of mammals 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 205 

1893. 

Jinuianj. — Several extra carpenters and laborers have been employed in conneetion 
with the World's l^iir work. A largo number of si)ocimens in the exlii))ition hall of 
the section of graphic arts were transferred to new cases. An air-shaft was con- 
structedin the northwest pavilion. The buildings were draped in mourning in respect 
to tlui memory of ex-President Rutherford B. Hayes. Screens were ]daced between 
the pillars, above tin? wall cases, on both sides of the north hall, to provide a back- 
ground for the collection of busts which has been arranged on these cases. 

Fehniarij. — An apparatus for the distillation of alochol was set up in the boiler 
room, and a new dynamo placed in the carjienter shop. Improvements Avere made 
in the laboratory of the nuimraal department at the south entrance. The shipment 
of exhibits to Chicago, for exhibition at the World's Columbian Exposition, was 
coumienced on the 27th. 

March. — Three of the basement rooms in the east wing of the Smithsonian build- 
ing, which have been used by the registrar I'or storage purposes, were cleared out, 
to be retitted for the use of the liureau of International Exchanges. The east shed 
■was moved a short distance farther from the south wall of the building, in order to 
provide better light in the basement. On the 25tli the lecture hall was prejjared for 
the first lecture of the course to l)e delivered under the auspices of the Anthropolog- 
ical Society. The superintendent, and a number of nun connected with his force, 
was ordered to Chicago, for the purpose of installing the exhibits. 

April. — The material sent to the Exposition at Madrid was returned during the 
month, and a portion of the specimens were repacked for transmission to the Colum- 
bian Exposition. The last shipment of exhibits to Chicago was made on the 29th, 
the total iiumber of carloads sent being twenty-four. Necessary repairs were made 
to the roof of the Smithsonian building. 

Maij. — The carpenters were engaged ibr a time in coustructiug storage cases on the 
north balcony for the use of the department of historical collections. New copper 
gutters were laid on the roof of one of the towers of the Smithsonian building, and sky- 
lights were placed in the roof of the southeast pavilion of the Museum building, 
the work being done by outside contract. The steam-heating apparatus in the base- 
ment of tiie Smithsonian building was extended, and the entire basement white- 
washed. The window frames around the roof and the skylight of tin; Museum were 
painted. 

Jiiitc. — The work on the roof and in the basement of the Smithsonian building was 
continued during the month. Awnings were put up at the windows of botli build- 
ings for the summer. The tiremen were engaged in making repairs to the steam 
pipes and radiators. Twenty -six incandescent lamps were hung in the lecture ball, 
the current being supplied l)y the dynamo in the carpenter shop.

Forty-six species are treated, special atten- 
tion being given to variation in size and to 
coloration as affected by seasonal molts, abra 
sion of the feathers by age, and through general 
fading of the plumage. The relationships of the 
widely-dispersed South American Mijiarchus 
tyrannulvs, to certain closely-allied West 
Indian, Central American, and Mexican forms, 
is made the subject of a short resum6, based on

Seventj'-five species are mentioned in this 
paper, of which one, Pijgmornis chapadensis, 
is described as new. Metopia galeata is treated 
at some length, a series of 127 specimens taken 
in every month in the year showing iu a very 
thorough manner the different stages of plum- 
age. Other species critically considered are 
Sijnallaxis Azarm, Thamnophilus ambiguus, 
Thamophilus radiatu.i, Dysithamnus mentalis, 
Herpsilochmus longirostris, Xijchtidromus alhi- 
collis Derbyanus, and Muinolus momota subru- 
fescens. 

In regard t* the development of the central 
tail feathers in the last-named species and their 
denudation by the bird for purjioses of jier- 
sonal adornment, some interesting notes are 
given, showing that in this species, at least, 
the barbs are forcibly removed by the birds 
themselves, in au attempt to make the feathera 
conform to a definite pattern. This paper is 
base<l upon Museum material.

This book discusses of 146 of North American 
species and subspecies. The main portion of 
the work is devoted to an exhaustive account of 
the life liistories of the species, mainly from 
original and recent sources with reference to 
breeding and migratory ranges, food, and time 
of incubation, and, tin ally, the eggs of each spe- 
cies, when known, are carefully described, and 
in every case the measurements given are the 
autlior's own. The averdge measurements have 
been obtained with great care from l.irge series 
of specimens, in some cases being tlie result of 
over two hundred separate measurements. The 
plates accompanying the volume are from draw- 
ings by John L. Eidgway. 

The following families are treated in the pres-

The early history and literature of the spe-

disinfect his granaries every year soon after 
the wheat is put in. This is best done with 
bisulphide of carbon, aiid the author gives the 
proper quantities to be used in rooms of various 
sizes. Against this insect as a corn pest the 
practice has been adopted of growing only such

Further notes on the new Herljariuni 

Pest. 

Insect Life, v, No. 1, September, 1832 pp. 
40-41. 
Tlie new herbarium pest, Carphuxera pte- 
learia. described in Insect Life, IV, pp. 108-113, 
was thought by Mr. R. McLachlan to be very 
like Acidalia herbaria fa. Fab., long known to 
injure herbarium specimens iu Europe. By 
comparison of the imagin of the two species, 
however, the author finds that the European 
motli is twice as large as the American 
species, more glossy, and differently marked 
in detail. In structural characters Carphoxera 
ptelearia is easily distinguished from Acidalia 
hcrbariata by the spatulate tubercles of the 
larviie, by the lateral projection on the fifth 
abdominal joint of the pupa, and by its much 
smaller size, more pulverulent, less glossy 
scaling, and difl'erent markings in the imago.

In a note in tlie August, 1892, number of the

the eggs of the Bean "Weevil "are preliminarily 
laid upon the bean \>od iu the field, but chietiy 
if not entirely upon those which are already 
matured and ripening." The X""'^''^*^iit note 
records the fact that tlie eggs hitherto taken 
for those of the common Bean Weevil arc, with- 
or,tmuc]idoubt,thoseof another Bruchus, eitlier 
Erticl.vs qiiadiimaculatus or B. scutetlaris, and 
that the eggs of the Bean AVeevil are thru.st 
into an ai)erture made by the jaws of the par- 
ent weevil along the ventral suture, or else laid 
iu clusters on the inside of the pod wherever 
this is sufficiently rijie to cause a partial open-

A r^'view of pa.st work iu apiculture, v.ith

to the Department of Agriculture, and toaches 
upon the work of the apicultural .stations at 
Aurora, 111., iu 1885, and at Michigan Agricul- 
tural College in 1891, summarizing the results of 
experiments ujwn foul brood, the relationof bees

The paper describes some of the remarkable 
striK'tures of the species of Pronuba and Pro- 
(/o.r((,5iuiider the heads : ( 1 ) The radiate bodiesin 
tin: receptacuhim seminis of Pronuba and Pro- 
doxtis; (2) Pseudo-cenchri; (3) The tegulro and 
I he i)atagia. The radiate bodies referred to, if 
they occur at all in other insects, are never 
found in anything like the remarkable develop- 
ment iu which they exist in the species of the 
family Prodoxidfe. Their function seems to be 
to liberate the spermatozoa from the si)erniato- 
phores. In conuection with two cenchri-like 
spots on th;} luetathorax of Pronuba synthetica, 
the author discusses the cenchri of Lepidoptera 
and coiK'ludes that they are more likely organs 
of sound than of any other sense. In discuss- 
ing the tegubv and patagia it is shown that 
nimh coufusidu on the part of authors in the 
use of those terms has existed, and the original 
definitions ot Westvvood and Kirby and Speuce 
are held to be the proper guides.

Hal)its of some social insects, and the polity 
of the hive of the honey bee. Refers to instincts 
of many social insects, and concludes tliat in- 
stinctive and inevitable actions on the part of 
insects are associated with others which result 
from the possession of intelligence, of conscious 
reasoning and reflective powers. 

"Just among the mammalia, the higher intel- 
lectual development, as in man, is physiologic- 
ally correlated with the longest period of de- 
pendent infancy ; that this helpless infancy has 
been, in fact, a' prime influence in the origin, 
through family, clan, tribe, and state, of organ- 
ized civilization; so in the insect world we tind 
the same physiological correlation between the 
highest intelligence and dependent infancy, and 
are.] ustifled in concluding that the latter is in t lie 
same way the cause of the high organization ami 
division of labor, the cause and explanation 
which so baffled Darwin in the application of his 
grand theory of evolution to social insects."

A general consideration of the subject of par- 
asitism among arthropods. As a useful work- 
ing system the author divides insect parasites 
into: I. Parasites proper, or those which cm 
not exist apart from the host; II. Fatal para- 
.sites, which as a rule involve the death of the 
host; and III. luquilmous parasites, including 
those insects which sponge on the labors of 
other insects. These primary divisions permit 
of subdivision, and the subject is dealt with in 
detail under the following subheads : Animals 
affected ; the jjarasites among insects, dealt with 
by orders; the derivative origin of inject para- 
sitism; eflects of the parasitic life; economic 
bearing of j)arasitism: conclusions.

fitt, Mayr and Wachtl, and his own observa- 
tions, and concludes that while there is every 
reason to believe that the genus is essentially 
parasitic, some of its species may be ])liyto- 
l>hagic.

and characterizes the hitherto unknown male of 
Prodoxus intermedins smA thelarvse of P. colora- 
dcnsis and P. cinereus. Ths larva of P. cinerexis 
is remarkable in that it bears on its ventral plate 
two stout, brown deourved horns, resembling 
those of tlie larva of Troijosita. Mentions tlie 
only other known instances of similar anal 
hooks in Lepidopterous larva?, viz, in Alucita 
Kellicottii, Fish, another Pterophorid, unde- 
seribed, and the larva of Hadena stipata, Morr., 
and argues that these structures, approaching 
as they do, those which are common to many 
boring Coleopterous larvw . are independent con- 
sequences of habit and environment, and show 
the relative valuelessuess of larval eliaracters 
for taxonomic purposes.

of the Bean Weevil. 

Insect Life, v. 'So. 1, September, 1892, pp.

In Dr. Horn's revision i/f the Bruchida?, 
the Bean weevil is given as liruchus obsolettis. 



RILEY, Charles V., and HOWARD 
L. O. — continued. 

Say. but the authors consider that the Bean 
weevil is distinct from obsolettis. Say found 
obsoletus on a species of Astragalus, from which 
he also obtained Apian segnipe.'^. 

Mr. Schwarz has found a Bruchus in connec- 
tion with this very Apinn segnipes on Tephrosia 
virginiana, near AVashington, and this Bruchus 
agrees fully with Say's description of B. obso- 
letus. All wlio have gone over the synonymy 
carefully will admit that B. obtectus, Say, which 
precedes B. obsoletus in the descriptions, is more 
plainly referable to our Bean weevil. The .syu- 
('inymy of the species from B. obtectus Say (1831) 
to B.subarmatus Janson (1889) is given. Its 
habits of oviposition in the field are discussed, 
and it is found that the eggs are invariably 
placed in the ])od.

STANTON, Timothy W. The faunas of 
the Shasta and Chico formations; 

Bull Geol. Soc. Am ,n'. June 1893 pp. 245- 
256. 
A brief discussion of tlie cretaceous fossils 
of the Pacific Coast regiou, based mainly on 
collections from the Sacramento Valley, )u 
northern California. It is shown that the 
Shasta and Chico formations are closely related 
faunally, having many species in common, and 
they are therefore regarded as parts of one 
continuous series. This paper is based upon 
Museum material.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 



WALCOTT, Charles D.— contiuued. 
lug Middle Paleozoic time. It is accompanied 
by three maps, one of which illustrates the 
relative amount of sedimentation within the 
typical geologic provinces of North America 
during Cambrian time. The second is a hypo- 
thetical map of the continent at the beginning 
of Lower Cambrian time, and the third is one 
of the same character, representing the conti- 
nent at the beginning of Lower Silurian (Ordo- 
vician) time. Several important conclusions 
were arrived at. Among them are : 

1. The preCambrian Algonkian continent 
was formed of the crystalline rocks of the 
Archean nuclei, and broad areas of superjacent 
Algonkian rocks that were more or less dis- 
turbed and exten.sively eroded in i)re-Canibrian 
time. Its area was larger than at any succeed- 
ing epoch until Mesozoic time. 

2. At the beginning of Cambrian time three 
Ijriucipal areas of sedimentation existed: (rt) 
The Atlantic coast province, including various 
seas between the several pre-Cambriau ridges; 
(h) a narrow sea extending along the western 
side of the Paleo-Appalachian range, from the 
present site of Labrador to Alabama; (c) a 
broader sea on the western side of the conti- 
nent, west of the Paleo-Rocky Mountain 
ranges, that extended from the southern por- 
tion of the present site of Nevada northward 
into liritish Columbia and probably toward the 
Arctic Circle, and south to the Paleo-Gulf of 
^Mexico, and thus connecting with the Paleo- 
Appalachian Sea. 

3. The Cambrian age began to invade the 
great interior continental area in late Cambrian 
time, and extended far to the north toward the 
close of the period, as indicated on PI. xlv. 

4. The depression of the continent in rela- 
tion to sea IcTel began in pre-Cambrian time 
and continued with few interruptions until the 
close of Paleozoic time. 

5. The relative i)ositions of the contincnta 
area and the deep seas have not changed since 
Algonkian time. 

6. The sedinvents of Cambrian time were 
accumulated to a great extent in approximately 
shallow seas, except in poi-tions of the Paleo- 
Rocky Mountain and Paleo-Ajipalachian seas- 

7. The lower Cambrian fauna lived in the 
seas of the Atlantic coast province, the Paleo- 
Appalachian and the Paleo-Rocky Mountain 
seas. 

8. The Middle Cambrian fauna of the Atlan 
tic basin is not known to have penetrated into 
the Paleo-Appalachian or Paleo-Rocky Moun- 
tain seas, except in the case of a few species 
now found in Alabama and jtrobably eastern 
New York. The portion of the fauna occupy, 
ing the same relative stratigrai)hic position in 
the grouj) is essentially the same as the Paleo. 
Appalachian and Paleo-Rocky Mountain sec- 
tions. 

9. The Upper Cambrian fauna was distrib- 
uted over the broad interior continental area 
and in the Paleo-Appalachiau and Paleo- liorky 



WALCOTT, CiiARLE.S D.— continned. 

Mountain seas, but it has not been recognized 
by the same genera and species in the Atlantic 
coast province, the fauna of the latter being 
more closely allied to that of the Upper Cam- 
brian of the eastern side of the Atlantic basin. 

Notes on the Cambrian rocks of Peun - 

sylvauia and Maryland, from the Sus- 
qnelianua to the Potomac. 

Am. Journ. Sci., XLIV, 1892, pp. 469-482. 
This paper is a continuation of the study of 
the Cambrian locks of the Appalachian range 
north of Virginia, between the Potomac and 
the Susquehanna rivers. It records the dis- 
covery of the Middle Cambrian fauna in a 
series of quartzites that extend from Harpers 
Ferry on the Potomac to South Mountain in 
; Pennsylvania, and which also occur in Tork 
County, Pa., on the Susquehanna. It was also 
discovered that a series of limestone shales 
severa thousand feet in thickness belong to 
the Lower Cambrian series.

The psychologic basis of social eco- 
nomics. 

Ann. Am. Acad. PoliticalandSocial Science, 
HI, Philadelphia, January, 1893, pp. 72-9U. 
The distinction is pointed out between what 
is described as animal or biologic and human 
or psychologic economy. The former is care- 
fully formulated, explained, and illustrated, and 
it is shown that the current political economy 
as well as the individualistic philosophy of 
Herbert Spencer and his disciples is primarily 
founded upon it. Examples of the prodigality 
of nature are given to show that it is not eco- 
nomical, and a sharp contrast is shown between 
nature's metliods and those of rational man. 
The fundamental defect of all systems of eco- 
nomics is thus shown to be that they rest upon 
biology or the law of unregulated nature, in- 
stead of iijwn psychology or the law of mind. 
A true system of economics will be based upon 
the latter, which is antithetical to the former 
and is economical in the correct sense of the 
word.

REPORT OF THE MINISTRY OF SPAIN TO THE QUEEN REGENT, CON- 
CERNING THE COMMEMORATION OF THE FOURTH CENTURY OF THE 
DISCOVERY OF AMERICA. 

[Translation.] 

Senora : lu defereuce to the glorious past of the couutry, your majesty's previous 
miuistry submitted for royal approval the two decrees of February 28, 1888, for an 
exposition to commemorate, iua wortliy manner, the fourth centenary of the discov- 
ery of America. In order to carry out these plaus, inspired by sincere sentiments, 
with the efficacy and rapidity which such enterprises demand, we have clearly 
traceil, and indeed goue over, in great part, the road by which the desired end will 
be reached. But in spite of the good will of all, and for reasons which it would be 
idle to investigate at the present time, almost three years have gone by without any- 
thing having been prepared or even considered. 

Some very important rules have been adopted, notwithstanding, and are about 
to be put into execution by the zealous commission appointed under the second of 
the aforenamed royal decrees. It will publish, without delay, scholarly volumes 
intended to illustrate minutely the history of the discovery and, in greater or lesser 
degree, cause the creation of works of art to contribute to the commemoration of 
that uni>aralleled exploit. But even though coiintiugupou such efforts, and upon the 
special poetic award recently offered by the Royal Spanish Academy, and upon other 
interesting ijrojects of private associations, there is still much to be done and the 
time is very short. In order to facilitate the carrying out of the work, the present 
decree is otfered Avhich, upon some points, alters the former provisions, but retains 
the essential bases and elaborates them. 

It is well known that though Columbus tore away the veil which hid the New 
from the Old World, to our country belongs the honor. If the holy Christian religion 
illumines to-day the consciences of the human race from Capo Horn to the heart of 
Mexico it is due to the Spaniards. If Europeans enjoy the wealth of the rich Amer- 
ican soil, they owe a debt of gratitude to the untiring labor and to the unyielding 
valor of our forefothers. For these reasons, though the event may be of international 
and cosmopolitan interest, it concerns above all the Spanish people on both hemi- 
spheres. So certain is this that foreign potentates repress the murmurings of their 
amour propre, and tacitly or expressedly accord to Spain the right to take the initia- 
tive in the commemoration of the event. And the peoples of the New World will 
admit, with greater reason even, that Spanish soil is like the fatherland of the 
Eiirojieans in America, although they are not all descended from us, nor even speak 
our native tongue. But whilst we cannot refuse, without dislionor, to undertake 
the flattering task assigned us, it would, on the other hand, be presumptuous to try 
to compete with the gigantic national demonstration of pride and enthusiasm 
which have been displayed in other j)lace3 than Spain. For many well known 
reasons we are unable, for the present, to enter into such costly rivalries. 

The modesty of the people who have lost what once they held within their gi'asp^ 
the destinies of the world, is suited to their dignity which might )>e compromised by 
vain ostentation, 



328 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Tliis must have been the convictiou of your inajesty's former ministry when it did 
not think, as otliors did. that the fourth centenary of the discovery of America 
should be celebrated in Madrid by an international exposition. But what is now 
proposed goes still farther, and does not limit the exposition simply to an industrial 
<'xhibit by the Hispano-Americans, who recently proved, in their sumptuous struc- 
tures at the Paris exhibition, their common and increasing prosperity. It is not 
obligatory, for this reason, tbat such a display should be made at the approaching 
centenary. Fortunately, we of the Peninsula and of America possess other elements 
which, togetlier with those we may be able to borrow, for the purpose from foreigners, 
would be sutticient to form a basis for a demonstration appropriate to the occasion. 
!No Hispano-American country can fail to possess, as docs the mother country, in 
museums, and in the hands of private individuals. pre-Columbian relics and those 
contemporaneous with the discovery which, brought together, would excite their 
common remembrances with no slight benefit both as to science and art. Hence the 
Govei'nment of your majesty proposes to organize a simple exhibit of such articles, 
lenounciug, for lack of sufficient means and time, any more arduous enterprise. 
From such an exposition might be gathered abundant fruits for the study of archae- 
ology, anthropology, and above all of history, if. in view of the wishes of Spain and 
still more of the occasion which inspires them, other nations should concur, as there 
are many such possessing full collections of the desired objects. 

The coumiission constituted in February, 1888, had begun to discuss another sort 
of exposition, and the present ministry has hastered to put it into execution. The 
plan is to collect the greatest number possible of the specimens of Iberian produc- 
tions anterier to the discovery of Ameri(>a, from the time when the new nations of 
the Peninsula were being formed until, when triumphant within themselves, they 
sought and found vast territories beyond the seas in which to extend their power. By 
this means it will not only be possible but easy to compare the respective conditions 
of culture of comj^uered and concjuerors at the time when they came together, without 
discriminating among the latter, between S])aniard8 and Portuguese, although at 
l)resent they belong to separate and independent states. The fame of incomparable 
discoverers belongs to us in common, and Spain has always included Portugal in its 
present plans. No one is ignorant that the cathedrals, churches, museums and 
private galleries of the nobility of the Peninsula contain ])recious works of Iberian 
art collected during the long period referred to, and, perhaps, for the greater part 
unknown. It maybe hoped, therefore, that this second exposition, combined with 
the first, will redound to the credit of both. 

Meanwhile, it is an important fact that the jiresent ministry does not forget that 
these two enterprises are not restricted by their official ch.aracter, but will rather 
stimulate the zeal of private individuals, in general, and that of their several and 
independent centers of action, .\nyoue who wishes to do so may bring to the com- 
mon treasiiry his intelligence and abilities with all the enthusiasm and freedom he 
possesses. But it cannot be denied that it is necessary that between the private 
individuals and the officials there should be established sufficient union as to render 
each other effectual assistance, and avoid, at least, disturbing each other in their 
respective efforts, so that the free actions of each may not degenerate into anarchy. 
And in fact it must be stated that this is not the least of the means, in virtue of 
which, the ministry now proposes to your majesty to appoint a committee of direc- 
tion which shall concentrate, assist, and lend organic force to all the elements offered 
to the enterprise. 

As a matter of course your majestj^'s ministry will still have the supreme control, 
because of its greater powers and its national character; but this will not interfere 
with any private efforts which coincide with the endeavors to obtain a good result. 

The expositions alluded to and many of the lai'ger entertainments will, of course, 
take place in Madrid; but the ministry also desires that the assistance of the com- 
mittee of direction, as well as that of the existing commission, should be extended 



COLUMBIAN HISTORICAL EXHIBITION IN MADRID, 1892. 329 

to the provinces and cities desiring it, and above all to such as possess the clearest 
titles as prominent actors in the centenary celebration. Granada, Santa F^, Valla- 
dolid, Barcelona, Sevilla and certain places in Hnelva, all of which are doubtless 
included in the number, will to the best of their respective abilities join with Madrid 
in tiiis laudable and patriotic manifestation. But it is impossible not to recognize 
that Hnelva, with its never-to-be-forgotten thoughmodestmonastery of Santa Maria 
de la Rabida, and its neighboring coast, rather than port, of Palos de Mogiier, where 
Columbus found asylum, resources and men to second and accompany him, and from 
which sailed the ships that first reached the New World, deserves on the part of the 
Government particular attention. It has been arranged that that place and that 
arm of the sea will be traverseil, during the first days of the centenary celebration, 
by the members of the congress of Americanists who will celebrate in Huelva their 
ninth anniversary. 

On the other hand, the committee appointed under the second of the decrees of 
1888, so frequently cited, had already thought of commencing operations in those 
famous places on the occasion of the centenary. It is now the part of the Govern- 
ment to see that those intentions are extended and fulfilled. And when all the 
foregoing shall have been well considered, it will be clearly seen that there remains 
so much to be done to carry out the intentions of the former and of the present 
ministry, that assiduous and active work will be needed so as to combine all the 
elements into a useful and complete entirety. This is the object to be attained by 
the committee of direction which, in virtue of this decree, is to be appointed. In 
particular the ministers, who form an important part of the committee, from hence-

a review of our knowledge coueerning- the poisonous snakes of Xorth 
America; to make the results of the specialists in the field accessible 
to a larger public; to bring together in one place a summary of an 
immense literature very often beyond the reach even of the student; 
to point out where our knowledge is defective, and to suggest new 
avenues of research. 

Many popular errors will be corrected, while others will be disposed 
of by a simple statement of facts, from which the reader is expected 
to draw his own conclusions. No attempt will be made to discuss and 
controvert the purposely exaggerated stories with which the literature 
of the day abounds. 

THE so CALLED "HARMLESS" POISONOUS SNAKES. 

If a snake is caught, killed, or seen, and any question raised as to its 
poisonous or harmless nature, it will be found that the presumption of 
guilt is against it, and that incontrovertible proof will be required by 
even highly educated people, not specially informed, before they are 
willing to believe in its innocence. An expert insisting that the snake 
in question belongs to a species wholly devoid of poison would probably 
during this discussion be met with the statement that a serious case of 
poisoning had once come under the observation of one of the persons 
present, the result of a bite of this very kind of snake. In spite of the 
fact thatnothingiscommouerand easierthan misidentitication of snakes, 
and that consequently the bite might have been caused by a really 
different kind of snake, the expert would not be in a position to contra- 
dict the accuracy of the statement, though he might be able to recall to 
his oi)ponent quite a number of similarly serious cases resulting from 
the bites of animals unquestionably non-poisonous in the accepted mean- 
ing of the word. He might quote Livingston's statement that the bite 
of the large felines is commonly followed by symptoms of poisoning, 
and he would relate cases of swelling and inflammation of serious

extent, perliaps even death, nndoubtedly caused by the bites of rats, 
dogs, eats, cows, liorses, and even luaji himself. 

It is clear then that we can not always conclude that a snake belongs 
to a venomous kind from the fact that its bite results in symptoms of 
poisoning. ^Modern science shows us that such results in other animals 
are due to the presence in their saliva of those minute organisms, the 
bacteria whose name at least is nowadays so well known to everybody. 
The general public knows these cases as blood-poisoning, the pro 
fessional man refers to them as cases of septic:emia. The fact that 
the poison of snakes is only a modified saliva should not lead anybody 
to suppose that snake poison and the bacteria-infected saliva — though 
both may lead to fatal results — have anything in common in their 
nature. On the contrary, the sooner both the general public and the 
medical practitioner understand this difference and act accordingly, the 
better. 

When speaking of poisonous or venomous snakes, therefore, T shall 
only refer to such snakes as are provided with a specific — to them 
peculiar — poison and an apparatus especially adapted for the introduc- 
tion of this poison into the wound of the victim. 

The question naturally will be asked : " Which, then, are our poisonous 
snakes?" 

The i)roi)er answer would be that only those of our snakes are refer- 
able to this category which are possessed of a movable or constantly 
erect lioison fang at the anterior end of the upper jaw bones, and even 
those who, on slight information, profess to be well informed, would in 
most cases admit that the above answer is correct. But it may be 
shown that this is only partly so. 

Students of snakes have for more than fifty years kei)t an eye on a 
certain category of snakes as " suspects.'' 

It seems that the Dutch professor, Keinwardt, while in Java, was the 
first to discover that certain snakes, dreaded by the inhabitants of that 
island as venomous, are provided with long grooved fangs at the pos- 
terior end of the maxillary bone. He communicated this discovery to 
]3r. H. Boie in Leyden, who published it in 182G.* The suspicion 
expressed by Prof. Reinwardt that this channel or groove on the 
anterior side of these fangs might convey the fluid from aj^oison gland 
led to several important investigations, the first of which to be pub- 
lished was Dr. Hermann Schlegel's memoir on the salivary glands of the 
serpents with grooved teeth. t 

He came to the conclusion that inasmuch as he found the structure 
of their glands to be similar to that of other salivary glands, there could 
be no doubt that they secrete "a fluid similar to the ordinary sahva;" 
and as "recent observations of travelers" served to show that the 
bites of snakes with grooved teeth produce no fatal results to man, he

asserted with characteristic positiveness that it is "erroneous" to class 
with venomous serpents those snakes which have the posterior teeth 
long and channeled. However, a short time after, Prof. G. L. Duver- 
noy, of Strasbourg-, published a no less important treatise on the sub- 
ject.* He pointed to the yellow portion of the supramaxillary gland 
as being structurally different from the white portion, and from Us being 
connected with a large grooved fang by a single duct he concluded, with 
equal assurance, that we have here before us a venom apparatus only 
in degree differing from that of the snakes with poison ftings fixed to 
the anterior end of the maxillary bone. His results were accepted and 
introduced into the classification adopted in the monumental herpeto- 
logical work of Dumeril and Bibron, the Erpetologie Generale, in 
which the snakes with grooved posterior fangs were placed in a separate 
group as ^'Opistofflyphsr On the other hand, Schlegel, paying no 
attention whatever to Duveruoy, in his "Physiognomic des Serpentes," 
maintained his standpoint, and so great was the authority of the learned 
Leyden professor that his view was until quite recently accepted by 
some of the most prominent systeraatists. It seems that neither side 
ever attempted to end the dispute by direct experiments, and gradu- 
ally the Opisto(jhjphs to many herpetologists ceased even to be "sus- 
pected." 

About ten years ago the interest in this question was suddenly 
revived, and as it may now be fairly regarded as a burning one, some 
space will be devoted to a short review of several of the recent inves- 
tigations into this theme. 

Two Italian students, M. G. Peracca and C. Deregibus, were led to 
make special investigations into the possible venomous nature oi Mal- 
polon lacertina { = Ccvlopeltis insignitus), a snake common about Nizza 
and in parts of Italy. In a communication to the Academy of Medicine 
at Turin, in May, 1883, f after first describing the grooved fangs, the 
glands, and the duct leading to the fang, they recounted their experi- 
ences with the snake in question: 

Their experiments were carried out with two specimens of Coelopeltis 
{=2MpoJon), one of medium size, the other much larger; the victims 
consisted of lizards, frogs, and toads. The snake did not bite them 
voluntarily; it was necessary to open its mouth and to force the animal, 
into its throat; whereupon the snake inoculated the venom, the motion 
of the bone carrying the poison fangs being very distinctly seen on 
account of the manner in which they were standing out from the poste- 
rior part of the head. The act of biting lasted some moments, and 
the snake repeated this act several times without allowing its prey to 
escape. 

The animals were bitten in the hind limb; in the case of the frog the 
skin had to be removed from the part to be bitten, as the irritating

348 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

secretion of the skin appeared to be particularly distasteful to the 
snake. Without reciting the various experiments in detail, the authors 
state the more apparent phenomena accompanying them to be, (1) the 
suspension of the respiration, which, in the main, occurs in a very few 
minutes (thirteen minutes being the maximum in a toad) and may 
happen suddenly, or maybe preceded by a gradual sinking interrupted 
by a deep breathing itause; (2) the cessation of reflex movements in the 
bitten limb, while still persisting for some time in the rest of the body; 
the excitements applied below the bitten point ceased almost immedi- 
ately to be transmitted to the medulla and to show reflexes. This 
alteration maintained itself local for some time, afterwards ])rogressing 
toward the periphery along the nerves of the wounded limb. The 
general paralysis does not delay long in coming. It is but rarely 
accompanied by convulsions. The heart continues to beat for a long- 
while (in the toad) but its strength decreases gradually. The blood 
revealed nothing notable under the spectroscope; as a matter of course 
it had become venous at the suspension of the respiration. The rapid 
changes which were observed at the wounded point are noteworthy; 
the muscular tissue became livid and inexcitable. Death ensued 
generally in half an hour, or less; in a toad it took place in twenty-six 
minutes. The heart of a frog continued to beat for many hours after. 
The authors then call attention to the interesting similarity between 
the above symptoms and those accompanying the poisoning by the 
cobra de capello, and Anally state that they have made controlling 
experiments with innocuous snakes which did not have such eftect 
upon the animals bitten. 

In a subsequent resume of this article* the same authors add that 
the effects of the bite of the Malpolon are not to be feared by man. "It 
seems," they say, " that the bite is only dangerous to reptiles, birds, 
and small mammals (mice); young dogs have resisted the poison rather 
well." 

Similar investigations and experiments were carried out about the 
same time, or a little earlier (1882), on an American species in Guana- 
juato, Mexico, by Prof. A. Duges, who has published his notes concern- 
ing Trimorphodon hiscniatHS,] a snake belonging to a genus representa- 
tives of which have been found along our Southern, border. He gives 
figures of his dissections, showing the venomous gland with its duct 
supplying the grooved posterior fangs with the poison. He records his 
experience as follows: 

One day as I was admiring the snake I saw liim seize a Cnemidophorus HCxUneatua 
[the striped swift, a lizard], at the middle of the body, advancing its jaws so as to 
bring the coiner of the month in contact with the body ot the lizard; for several 
moments it clieired (a rare occurrence in a snake) its victim without the latter mov- 
ing, letting go after having killed it; but at this juncture the saurian was swallowed

by another snake (Ophibolus doUaiits) which was kept in the same cage, thns iire- 
venting me from finishing the observation. A few days after, the same Trimorpho- 
(lon caiight another Citemidoiihorns by the left arm and chewed it several limes. At 
the end of a few minntes the bitten animal died withont convnlsions, without 
agitation, as if asleep, a little bloo<l issuing I'rom the wound. 

A little later (1885), Mr. Otto Ednmud Eiife* published some observa- 
tions, also made in 18S2, on Tarhophis inrax, an opistoglypli snake 
inhabiting the countries bordering on the Eastern Mediterranean, and 
from his account we quote as follows: 

I offered the half grown snake a perfectly healthy Lacerta rivipara, which he at 
once commenced to lap with his tongue and then grasped slowly behind the fore legs. 
The lizard defended itself as best it could and used its teeth well on the enemy. In 
less than a minute the lizard was almost motionless, the jaws were powerless, and 
the eyes closed; before the expiration of another half minute the lizard died, and 
was then swallowed. 

Prof. Leon Vaillant, of the Museum of Natural History, at Paris, 
observed the poisonous effect of the bite of another of the opistoglyph 
snakes, Tragops prasinusy Wagler, and gives the Ibllowing interesting 
account of one of the observations :t 

A small living green lizard was presented to the snake by means of a forceps. The 
enake seized it across the neck without descending from the shrubbery among which 
it used to live, and by the play of the jaws drew it back to the corner of the mouth. 
The lizard tossed and bent about, winding its body and tail round the head of the 
snake; three minutes later it hangs down inert, only the tail still trembling; after a 
similar space of time convulsions of the whole body occur again, twining itself 
around the head, then relajtsing Avithout motion, except some spasmodic undulations 
of the tail; this lasts for two minutes, and the animal is dead. It will be seen that 
this poison must have been tolerably active, as it caused the death of the lizard in 
about eight minutes after the puncture by the fangs, which must have taken place 
when the lizard reached the angle of the mouth, as the snake made no movement 
after that. 

It seems quite plain from these observations that we have here to 
do with a specific poison. The victims succumbed within a very short 
time, and while it is evident that death was not caused by the mechau- 
ical injury inflicted by the bite, much less by the shock, there is as 
little room for assuming that it was due to the action of bacteria- 
infected ordinary saliva. 

These experiments have agaiu roused the interest in the morphology 
and physiology of -these glands, and two years ago, sixty years after 
Duveruoy's work, Mr. F. Niemann published f some investigations 
upon this subject. Among other snakes he dissected and described 
two species with posterior grooved fiings, and he clearly demonstrates 
that, in both, the yellowish gland has already passed the innocuous 
stage and become a true poisou gland, though structurally somewhat 
intermediate — as are, in fact, the fangs. He found in both species the 
yellowish gland well circumscribed and clearly differentiated from the

true supralabial glaud, although both glands are eontaiued in the same 
envelope of connective tissue, and he was able to trace the single duct 
leading from the yellowish gland to the groove of the posterior elon- 
gated fang. One of the species was Tragops prasinns, Wagler (the same 
species with which Prof. Vaillaut experimented), and an inhabitant of 
the East Indies, the other heiug Lepiodeira anun- 
lata, (L.), from tropical America. Fig. 1 is a copy 
of Mr. Niemann's schematic representation of the 
arrangement in the former. Fig. 2 shows a sec- 
tion of the grooved fang near its base, copied from 
the same author. 

That, these snakes are not entirely harmless, 
even to man, is evident from the very recent expe- 
rience of Mr. J. J. Quelch, of Georgetown, British 
Guiana,* who was bitten on the first finger by a large specimen of the 
common red-white-andblack-banded snake, Eryihrolamprns venustlssi- 
mus, driving its hinder grooved teeth three times- down into the flesh. 
About half an hour after, the linger became much swollen at the place 
and distinctly very painful. It was not till about four hours after- 
ward that real relief was obtained, though the place 
was tender for a much longer time. Another case 
was that of the clerk in the Museum, who was bitten 
on the finger by a young specimen of the. common 
frog snake or Mattipi, Xenodon sererus, whose binder 
enlarged teeth were driven deeply into the flesli, with 
a result similar to that described in the case of the 
other snake. 

It will be observed that while the snake by which 
Mr. Quelch himself was bitten is a true opistoglyph 
with grooved posterior fangs, the. one which caused 
a similar result in the clerk, viz, the Xenodon, has 
the enlarged posterior teeth solid and not grooved. 
I would call attenti(m to the fact, however, that this 
identical species is described by Duvernoyt as iiaving the yellowish 
gland well differentiated. That the bite of the allied species, Xenodon 
rliabdoceplwlus, did apparently have no unpleasant effect on Dr. Strad- 
liiigl is not difficult of explanation in view of the fact that occasionally 
the bite of even some of the most dangerous snakes has been ineffective, 
but enough is said to show that the question is not an unreasonable one: 
Is it essential for a truly venomous snake to possess grooved fangs? 

As a matter of fact, at the very moment of this sentence going to 
press, the (piestion seems answered conclusively in the negative by the 
experiments of Phisalix and Bertrand, who have shown that the saliva

of even ordinary solid-toothed harmless snakes contains the same 
specific poison which characterizes the dreaded thanatophidia. Fuller 
account of their discoveries will be found in the concluding chapter of 
this treatise. 

However, since the character of the saliva of the harmless snakes 
does not seem to play any role in their economy, so far as obtaining 
food, or defending themselves against enemies, is concerned, we are 
still justified in regarding the opistogl^-phs as a distinctly specialized 
group of poisonous snakes, aside from any consideration of their prob 
ably more or less close genetic relationship. 

Allhoagh thus in the strictest sense poisonous, these comparatively 
harmless snakes do not claim the deep interest which snakes, dangerous 
to human life, through dread of the mysterious power excite in the pop- 
ular mind. No attempt will be made then to treat of their structure 
and other peculiarities, in the present connection, beyond remarking that 
we have within the confines of the United States the representative of 
four genera of opistoglyph snakes, which may easily be referred to 
their respective divisions by the following characters:

There has been almost as nuich doubt about the poisonous nature of

these pretty animals may be fatal even to man, and as they are unde- 
niably very nearly related to the deadly cobra, || the scourge of India, 
the verdict has decided against them long ago. 

There are numerous doubters yet, however. Letters are often received

there, is poisonous or not, and the Museum is asked to decide bets 
made by persons taking opposite sides on this question. 

The cause of this diversity of opinion is usually that the person 
defending the character of tlie Harlequin Snake, by quoting cases in 
which the bitten persons did not suffer any more injury than if they 
had been bitten by an ordinary gartersnake, has mistaken the identity 
of the snake and confounded the really poisonous Harlequin Snake, or 
Flaps, with one or the other of two or three entirely innocent snakes 
which resemble it greatly in color and which inhabit the same locality. 
It is a remarkable tact that this curious imitation or "mimicry" of the 
gaily colored Elapn by one or more harmless species takes place almost 
throughout the range of the former. So close is the resemblance in 
some instances that even alleged experts have been deceived. 

On the other hand, it appears that some, at least, of the species of 
Elaps are of a temperament so gentle that they only use their weapon 
in very extreme cases. Prince Max von Wied seems to have been the 
first to have raised the question as to the venomous character of two 
Brazilian members of the genus {Elaps coraUiiiits and Ekq)s marq/ravii), 
for he states* that he used to carry them about his person and that 
they never even attempted to bite. The prince can not well be sus- 
pected of mistaking the species, f(n^ not only was he an expert herpeto- 
logist, but he described and figured them both most accurately and 
minutely. Our own well-known Elaps fulvius has a defender of no less 
high standing among the students of reptiles, Mr. Holbrook, the South 
Carolinian author of the monumental "North American Herpetology," 
printed in five sumptuous quarto volumes, who statest that the indi- 
viduals he ha<l seen had been of a very mild character, and could not 
be induced to bite under any provocation whatever. "Indeed," he 
remarks, "although possessed of poisonous fangs, they are universally 
regarded as innocent snakes, and are constantly handled with impunity, 
never to my knowledge having injured any one."| 

The "instruments of destruction" (which he refers to in the same 
paragraph) are the hollow fangs, fastened, one on each side of the upper 
jaw, to the anterior end of the maxillary bone. It will be seen that this 
is an arrangement exactly the reverse of what obtains in the opistoglyph 
snakes of the previous chapter, hence the genus Elaps and its allies 
are known as proieroglyphs.^ The fang being at the front of the mouth 
makes it much more effective as a weapon — in the opistoglyphs it can 
even hardly be regarded as such — aLd in it will be shown that the 
little beauty is fully capable of using it when required. 

The following case is a celebrated one, and in many respects highly

instructive. For lull details the reader is referred to the report upon 
it pubisljed by Mr. Frederick W, True* after the occurreuce. A brief 
account is, bowever, inserted here. 

The victim was Mr. Zeno Sbindler, an employee of the U. S. National 
Museuui, aud tbe ofteuder a medium-sized Ulaps fulvins, received 
from Mr. James Bell, of Gainesville, Fla. 

On June 1, 1882, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon, prepara- 
tory to making the color sketch from the live snake which should serve 
for a guide m paiuting the plaster cast to be made from it, Mr. Shin- 
dler attempted to transfer the suake from the terrarium to a glass jar^ 
holding it tightly by the neck. At the moment he let go, the snake's 
tail touched the bottom of the jar, and before he had time to remove 
his hand the snake fastened its fangs in his left index finger. The 
snake did not strike like the rattlesnake, but bit hard closing the lower 
jaw upon the finger, and held on so firmly that it had to be wrenched 
off, by which operation one of the fangs was broken off in the wound. 

The first symptoms, which appeared immediately after the bite, 
according to Mr. True, consisted of violent pain at the wound. The 
symptoms continued without material change to 4:30 p. m. At that 
hour the first symptoms of drowsiness or unconsciousness made their 
appearance, and remained until the morning of the third day. 

At 7:30 p. ni. on the day of the bite Mr. Shindler felt so ill that he 
deemed it prudent to call upon his physician, Dr. L. M. Taylor, of 
Washington, whose treatment is given in full in Mr. True's report. 

In three days after treatment the patient felt in good health again. 
About two months after the event, however, jiain set in once more at 
the bitten finger, extending to the knuckles; and after a few days an 
ulcer made its appearance above the latter. 

Mr. Shindler's troubles were not yet over, and as the periodical 
recurrence of the symptoms have been very marked, I shall bring it 
down to date (December, 1894 1). 

Mr. Shindler tells me that every summer, a few days before June 2, 
the day he was bitten, the wounded finger commences to pain, mostly 
at night. A sore is formed and soon breaks open, aud as a result the 
nail invariably comes off. The attack lasts for about two weeks. 

Two years ago, liowever, and ten years after the accident, the recur- 
rence was prevented by a remedy commonly used in Brazil against 
suake bite, and brought to Mr. Shindler from that country by his friend, 
Dr. A. de Bausset. The remedy consists of the leaves and stem of a 
vine {2Iica)tia guaclin) an infusion of which was taken internally imme- 
diately before the expected recurrence of the symptoms, with the result 
that, although the pains arrived on time, no eruption took place. His 
experience in 1893 and 1894 was similar.

354 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Mr, True, in the same article, also published letters froiu two Texan 
physicians reporting three cases of bites by Coral Snakes, two of which 
ended fatally, the tirst ones on record, I believe.* 

Dr. Thomas Kearney, of San Antonio, relates one case, as follows: 

The foUowiug case of a bite of a Coral Snake, followed by death, occurred near 
Corpus Christi, Texas, during the last year of the '• late unpleasantness." An infant 
child of Mr. Alexander Stringer was playing in the yard, and being attracted by the 
bright colors of a coral snake, grasped it near the middle. The screams of the child 
brought its parents to its relief, but too late; the snake had done its work. The 
child lingered in great agony until the following nujrningand died, as above stated. 
The snake, as described to me, was about 18 inches long. 

The other cases were reported by Dr. J. Hertt", also of San Antonio, 
who wrote that one of the bitten men died in twenty-four honrs, while 
the other one recovered after an almost fatal prostration of thirty-six 
hours' duration : 

Thcffatal case I know of came under my observation a few minutes before death 
occurred under the symptoms of paralysis of toe heart. The second case was 
brought soon enough for me to try stimulants — whisky, hypodermic injections of 
ammonia, and fomentations of digitalis leaves over the region of the kidneys. The 
man, a strong young Scotchman, recovered in three days, and felt only a feeling of 
tingling in his extremities for some time after. * * * Both men kept the snakes 
as pets, and the last one usedtojiut his linger in the animal's mouth very often to 
show how tame he was. One day he put it in a little deeper than usual, and while 
trying to extricate it the teeth bit him. 

It would, however, seem that death from the bite of this snake is not 
so very uncommon, for Mr. Frederick A. Lucas informs me that a 
brother of Mr. S. A. Eobinson, of Orlando, Fla., has told him that he 
knows of three fatal cases. I may also refer to the cases recently 
reported by Dr. Einar Lcennberg in the Proceedings of the F. S. 
National Museum (vol. xviii, 1S94, p. 334). 

That great authority on snake poison, Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, of Phila- 
delphia, nevertheless asserted! as late as 1889 that " the beautiful Coral 
Snake, the little Ela^j.s of Florida," is "too small with us to be danger- 
ous to man." Dr. Paul B. Barringer, of the University of Virginia, in a 
well written account of '-The Venomous Reptiles of the United States," 
read before the Southern Surgical and Gynecological Association, Nov- 
vember 1-, 1891, | strongly ])r()tests against this and quotes a case, 
reported by Mr. Charles E. Coe, § of a workman at Oakland, Orange 
County, Fla., who died from the effects of a bite. About half an hour 
after being bitten pains came on in his hand and arm, followed by 
drowsiness and a dull pain in the head. A doctor was called, but the 
man died eighteen hours after receiving the bite.

POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 355 

In view of these facts before us it will no louger answer to applj' such 
adjectives as " harmless"* or " innocuous to man '' t to a snake of which 
it is positively known that its bile is dangerous. It is granted that 
Flaps is comparatively rare; that it is retiring in its habits, mostly 
living under ground, and that it has a very gentle and amiable tem- 
jjerameut. When it does bite, however, its bite is as venomous as that 
of a rattlesnake or moccasin of the same size, and even more so. It is 
probably quite true that the snake, in all the cases referred to above, 
was handled roughly and provoked beyond endurance; but it is also 
true that it would not, in most cases, have had an opportunity to do the 
mischief, if it had not eujoyed such an excellent reputation. 

It has been repeatedly asserted that the mouth of the Elaps is so 
small that it can not bite as well as the other poisonous snakes. This, 
however, is somewhat of a mistake. Externally and superficially the 
head of the Elaps appears very short and narrow, and the opening of 
the gape of but slight capacity. An examination of the skeleton, how- 
ever, shows the skull to be comparatively large and rather elongate, 
especially the cranial part, which occupies fuUy two-thirds of the total 
length of the head. The articulation of the lower jaw, which is cor- 
respondingly lengthened, is consequently far enough back to permit, by 
means of the elasticity of the ligaments, the opening of the mouth quite 
out of proportion to the external asi)ect of the snake. 

That this capacity is not a theoretical one is shown by the fact that 
an Flaps fuli^ius has been found which contained a well preserved 
whip snake, of the same length as the Elaps^ besides the half digested 
remains of a garter snake. The body of the Elaps was so distended 
that the scales, instead of overlapping, were separated from each other 
by considerable spaces of skin. \ 

The good reputation of the Elaps in combination, on the one hand, 
with the apparent insignificance of the wound and the lack of alarming- 
local symptoms, on the other with the great similarity it bears to really 
harmless snakes, makes its bite more fatal in proportion to the number 
of reported cases than any other snake in the country. The w ounded 
person usually does not know his danger, and does not take the i^roper 
measures against a puncture which on the surface looks so innocent; 
and as the action of the specific venom of the Elaps is both quick and 
violent when admitted into the circulation of the blood, the remedies 
when finally applied cau do but little good. 

^Morphologically the Elaps is not distantly related to the cobra of 
India, § that is, they agree closer in external and internal structure than 
either of them does with the typical harmless snakes on the one hand, 
or with the vipers on the other.

356 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

That their venom also is more nearly the same than is that of the 
cobras and the rattlesnakes there can be no doubt. As will be shown 
later on, the poison of these last-mentioned snakes has been investi- 
gated and found to be considerably different, and although no examin- 
ation of the chemical composition of the Flaps poison has been made 
as yet, as far as I know, the similarity in the symptoms shows that the 
venom of the cobra and the Coral Snake are very much alike. 

In Mr. Shiiidler's case the doctor's report does not mention any local 
symptoms beyond the swelling of the finger, and Mr. Shindler informs 
me that there was no discoloration, as in the case of rattlesnake bites, 
beyond the reddening near the wound. The absence of special men- 
tion of violent local changes in the other cases is indication enough 
that none took place, while Dr. Herif expressly states that "different 
from our common poisonous snakes, the bitten part would neither swell 
nor become discolored," nor could anything be observed on the wound, 
except the small impression caused by the teeth of the serpent. But 
this absence of local efiect is just one of the essential characteristics of 
the cobra poison as contrasted with that of the rattlesnake. 

I have alluded to the extraordinary similarity between the Flaps 
and several perfectly harmless snakes inhabiting the same region, and 
it is quite probable that the innocent nature of the latter is in a great 
measure responsible for the former's good reputation, just as reversely 
several of the harmless snakes have received bad names on account of 
their external similarity to the venomous moccasin or copperhead. 

It will therefore not be amiss to institute a comi>arison between the 
coral snakes and their imitators,* in order to furnish a means of readily 
distinguishing the venomous and dangerous reptiles from the innocuous 
ones. 

With the dead specimens in hand tlie correct identification is not 
difticnlt. I7i the first place, the Flaps is provided with permanently 
erect, perforated fangs, that is, there is found at the front end of each 
upper jawbone one solitary curved tooth, which has a channel running 
through its wenter and a groove on its anterior surface, and which is 
not followed by any other teeth f ©w the upper jawbone, while the 
other snakes with which it can be confounded have no such perforated 
fang but instead a series of smaller solid teeth on the entire length of 
the bone in ([uestien (tigs. 3 and 4). Ilunning the j)oint of a pin or a 
penknife along the bone just inside the upper lip will soon disclose 
tte presence or absence of these teet-li. There are several other minor 
points of structure and proportion which serve to distinguish the Flaps. 

*It seems as if the harmless snakes are the imitators, and not rive versa, because 
the peculiar coloration of the various species o£ Elaj)s is more or less the same every- 
where, while the harmless snakes resembling them belong to many different genera, 
in some of which there occur species of widely different color awd pattern. 

t Except, of course, the reserve iaugs, likewise grooved.

Thus it Las very small eyes, smaller than the shields between which 
the nostrils are placed, while in the inocuous snakes the eyes are con- 
siderably larger. The snout of the Elaps is short, blunt, and rounded, 
while in the others it is elongate, conical, more or less pointed. More- 
over, in the former the frontal shield is small, less than one-half the 
size of one of the parietals, the latter much more than one-half.

With the live animals, free or captive, these characteristics are often 
difficult of application. In such cases it is necessary to rely upon dif- 
ferences in the color pattern as a means of identification. 

There are in the United States only two well-defined species of EIa2)s. 
The characteristic coloration of these consists of a series of transverse 
rings of black, vermilion, 
and yellow. This pattern is 
repeated in several species 
and subspecies of the genus 
Lamirropeltia (or OpMboJus), 
known as "Scarlet King- 
snake," L. doliatus; "Eed 
king snake," L. coccineus; "Kinged Khig-snake," L. annulatus; 
"Arizona king snake," L. pyrrliomelas, etc., as well as "Osceola's 
Snake," Osceola eJapsoideu; the "Scarlet Snake," Cemophora coccine, 
and to a less extent in "Le Conte's Snake," Rhinocheilus lecontei, all or 
some of which inhabit the same region as one or the other species of 

Elaps. In all of these red, 

?^-l^'^"' '^"^-W" "'■^^°*»s*. black, and yellowish is 
" ' ' arranged in more or less 

perfect transverse rings. 
Le Conte\s Snake is less 
characteristic and like the 
Cemophora^ easily told apart by having the entire under surface whitish, 
while in the others, including the Elaps, the red and black is more or 
less continued across the belly. There is one fundamental difference 
in the arrangement seen in the species of Elaps within our boundary 
and that in Lampropeltis, Osceola^ and Cemophora, which is that in 
our Elaj)es that black rings are uorderd on each side by a yellowish 
ring (fig. 5) while in the others the yellow rings are bordered on each 
side by a black ring (fig. (»).

Postfrontal bone wanting; internasal plate not reaching labials; two 
nasals; no loreal: subcaudal shields (urostoges) divided; eyes very 
small, pupil a sliort vertical ellipsoid. 

The snakes of this genus are cyhndrical, rather elongate, but with 
short tail, and characterized by bright colors of red, black, and often 
yellow, forming rings. In many of the exotic species the black rings 
are arranged in threes, while in the North American species those of 
the body are equidistant. The scales are smooth and iridescent. 

The exact number of species can not be given at present on account of 
the uncertainty of the status of many of the described forms, but at 
least twenty inhabit the New World, of which only two occur north of 
Mexico. 

While the poison apparatus of the rattlesnakes and their nearest 
relations has been studied very minutely, that of the genus Elaps has 
been sadly neglected, as has been, in fact, its entire anatomy. Drs. 
Matthes and Voigthender have given short and superficial accounts 
of Elaps fulvhis^ from which t I make a few abstracts: The functional 
fang in Elaps fulvius is followed by reserve fangs of the same struc- 
ture as the functional one, but successively smaller. The functional 
fang is solidly united to the maxillary bone, being directed backward 
at a permanent angle of about 45° with the latter. Although com- 
paratively smaller than the fangs in the crotalid snakes, that of Elaps 
is large enough to distinguish it at the first glance as different from 
the solid teeth of the palate and of the lower jaws. In front, at the 
base of the fang, the opening of the canal is distincly visible, and on 
the convex, or anterior, surface of the fang a shallow groove. The 
terminal slit, being the lower opening of the canal, is situated slightly 
on the outer side of the fang. 

As already stated there are found in the United States only two well 
defined species of Elaps, but these are so sharply defined that they may 
be told apart at a glance, by the following characters: 

* The brilliant colors of all these snakes fade soon in alcohol ; the red becomes gray- 
ish or li<;jht brownish ; the yellow grows pale, often quite white j and the deep blact;, 
often bluish, turns a dull brown.

Description * — The red may be considered as the ground color of the 
body, though the black rings occui)y nearly as much space above as 
the red, so as to give the general appearance of succession of red and 
black rings. The yellow is intermediate. The anterior part of the 
head from the posterior point of the vertical plate [frontal] embracing 
the orbits is black, as is also the tip of the lower jaw. A yellow ring- 
passes across the occipital [parietal] re- 
gion down to the inferior surface of the 
head, embracing the space between the 
I)osterior rim of the eye and the angle of 
the mouth. Then comes a black ring, 
covering 8 dorsal scales, margined poste- 
riorly with yellow. From this region to 
the origin of the tail, the black and red 
rings from 14 to 11> in number each, alter- 
nate, being separated from each other by 
a narrow band of yellow. The black rings cover 7 entire scales, and 2 
halves; the intermediate red space 5 entire scales and 2 halves, and the 
yellow either 1 and 2 half scales or 2 halves only. Some red spaces may 
occasionally cover 11 and 10 scales. The tail.is alternately black and yel- 
low ; the first caudal ring is black and embraces 10 scales ; the second is 
yellow and covers 3 scales. Two black and 2 yellow succeed and cover 
the same ground. The tip of the tail is black on 5 scales. The tip may be 
either black or yellow, for according to the size there are either 3 or 4 
black rings. Underneath the colors are the same but dull : occasionally 
one or more black rings may not surround the body. The reddish 
spaces are irregularly blotched with deep black as also sometimes on the 
upper surface. 

Number of ventrals [gastrosteges], 202-237 ; of sub-caudals [uro- 
stegesj, 25-4.5.

tendency toward iucreasing the number of ventral sliields (gastrosteges), 
narrower frontal and parietals, widening of the yellow rings, and 
greater size of black spots in the red rings. Individuals showing these 
characters well developed have been called Elaps tencre, or Elaps fulvius 
tenere, but there does not occur in any locality a sufficient percentage of 
individuals typical of the form to make it profitable to recognize a 
subspecies. 

The status of some Florida specimens differing considerably in 
pattern from normally colored U. fulvius has not been satisfactorily 
settled as yet. They are stated not to differ at all in structure or 
proportions. Only a few specimens seems to have been collected — I 
have myself only seen one — and that in a locality in which the normal 
form also occurs. More material is highly desirable. Prof. Cope calls 
them JElajJS distans. The chief difference from typical E. fulvius con- 
sists in the greater width of the red rings, which are not spotted with 
black, and the consequent narrowing of the black rings to 2 or 3 scales. 

Geograjyhical distribution. — I do not know how reliable the informa- 
tion was, upon which Holbrook states that the range of this species 
may "be said to begin in North Carolina and southern Virginia," for I 
am not aware of any definite record of specimens taken in those States, 
though it may well occur there, as we have quite a luimber of records 
and specimens from South Carolina even as far north and back in the 
country as Society Hill and Columbia. It extends over Georgia and 
the entire State of Florida. From Alabama, Mississippi, and Louis- 
iana there are numerous records. The Bead Snake evidently follows the 
Mississippi River up a considerable distance notwithstanding the mea- 
gerness of details known, and notwithstanding the fact that the vigi- 
lant observers in St. Louis, among them Mr. Julius Hurter, have failed 
to find it. It even ascends the Missouri River, as Dr. Hoy obtained it 
near that river in about 39° latitude. How much reliance can be placed 
upon the identity of the specimen which Holbrook quotes as in the 
possession of Prof. Green, of Philadelphia, and said to have been 
brought by Lewis and Clarke from the " Upper Missouri," I do not 
know, but almost certainly there is some mistake. Recently two spec- 
imens liave been captured in southeastern Indiana and southwestern 
Ohio under circumstances which make it appear probable that the 
species occurs along the Ohio River (Hay, Batr. Rept. Indiana, p. 122; 
Butler, Journ. Cincinn. Soc. Nat. Hist., 1892, p. ITS). lu the southern 
part of Texas this snake is found in all suitable localities, ascending a 
considerable distance into the interior along the great river valleys. 
Thus along the Rio Grande it extends up to the mouth of the Pecos, 
even ascending the latter, as Capt. John Pope's siiecimens were col- 
lected certainly not farther south than the tliirty-first parallel. In 
southern Texas, moreover, it reaches a higher altitude than farther 
east, viz, over 1,000 feet, while none of the records of the eastern local- 
ities show it to reach e^•en an altitude of 500 feet. 



3G2 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, ls93. 

Eahits. — Comparatively little is kuowii of the habits of this beautiful 
sualve, which like its harmless mimickers is often known as the bead 
snake, beyond the paragraph by Holbrook (op. cit. p. 50) repeated 
by most writers on the subject since his days, viz, that it is found 
livin*;- under ground in the sweet jwtato flelds, and is frequently dug 
np by the laborers when harvesting. 

The food of the Harlequin Snake seems to consist chiefly of other 
snakes and reptiles. I have already referred to a specimen which had 
swallowed a Bascan'wn as long as itself before it had fully digested a 
garter snake. Dr. Matthes (op. cit., p. 58) opened three more Elapes 
with the following result: Xo. 1 contained a half-grown Enmeces fas- 
cidtus; Xo. 2 had in its stomach a small snake, remnants of a lizard and 
a few beetles, the latter possibly the contents of the lizard's stomach; 
No. 3 also contained a small snake besides remains of a small rodent. 
Dr. O. P. Hay (Batr. and Kept. Indiana, 1S03, p. IL'L') reports having 
found a Storer's snake, 13^ inches long, in a Florida EUipn, "21 inches 
long. 

Xothing at all seems to be known of the breeding habits of our 
harlequin snakes. 

This group offers a i^romising field for study by persons luiving the 
opportunity to observe these snakes alive.

very slightly notched for the vertical [frontal]. Seven labials above; 
posterior very small. 

The fore part of the head is black, but the black, instead of jDassing 
forward from the anterior part of the occipitals [parietals] to near the 
eye, and there leaviug the three posterior labials yellow as in E.fulvius 
and E. tener, involves nearly the whole of the occipitals [parietals], and 
passes backward entirely behind tbe angle of the mouth and involves 
the whole of the lower jaw to behind the posterior labial, leaving 
a broad emargination in the black on the occiput, in the bottom of 
which emargination are seen the white posterior tips of the occipitals 
[parietals]. 

Behind this is a creamy-white ring (probably yellow in life), which is 
situated more posteriorly than in U./nlriio-;, and involves only the pos- 
terior tip of the occipitals [parietals] and none of the labials. Xext 
behind this white ring, instead of a black ring, as in the other species, 
is a broad light brick-red one involving eleven scales. A creamy- white 
ring three and a half scales wide separates this first red ring from a 
black one eight scales in width. Behind this are alternate immaculate 
black and red rings, seven or eight scales wide, and separated by white 
rings three to three and a half scales in width. There are eleven black 
and eleven red rings on the body, separated by twice as many white 
ones. The tail is ringed with black and white without any red. All 
the rings run entirely around the body of the same color and are wholly 
without spots above or below,

Geoyraphical distribution. — This species is yet so little known that its 
disti'ibution can only be mapped out in a preliminary manner. It 
belongs to the '• Lower Souoran '' jtrovince, but seems restricted to the 
regions east of the great Colorado Eiver and west of the Continental 
Divide. It has been found as far north as Fort Whipple and at various 
places in southern Arizona, extending south into Mexico at least as far 
south as Batopilas, in the State of Chihuahua, in the interior, and to 
Guaymas, Sonora, on the Gulf of California. 

In Arizona it reaches an altitude above the sea of at least 5,000 feet.

THE PIT VIPERS. 
Fniuily Crotalid^e. 

''PitYiper" is a "book name" meant to include the Eattlesnakes, 
Moccasins, Copperheads, etc., but unlike many others it is a most excel- 
lent one, for not only does it indicate the relationship of these snakes 
to the true vipers, but it also contains a reference to the remarkable 
character which at once distinguishes them both from the vipers and 
fi^om all other snakes as well. 



364 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

The uaine refers to the deep pit or liole found in the Rattlesnakes 
and their nearest relations on tlie side of the face between the nostril 
and the eye, and well shown in fig 0. This cavity sinks deep into the 
maxillary bone and represents a "blind" sacliued with epidermis and 
is not connected with any of the other cavities or organs in the head 
by any inside opening or canal. There is nothing similar to be found 
in any known reptiles outside of this family, if we except the labial 
l)its in the pythons and boas, nor is there in any other class of animals. 
When the earlier zoologists came to examine this peculiar structure 
they, of course, tried to comj^are and identify it with other organs 
already known, some hinting at the closed nostrils of the fishes, Avhile 
others pointed out its similarity, in position at least, to the so-called 
^' tear-sacs '' of the deer. It was even suggested that in view of the close 
approximation of the pit to the poison apparatus it might have for 
object the admission of air to act in some unknown way upon the secre- 
tion of the venom glands, thus rendering the poison more powerful.

It was plain, however, even to those who proposed these ex])lanations, 
that they were not the true solution of the question, and most authors 
were satisfied with a reference to the pits as "mysterious." 

In the meantime naturalists have become compelled to assume the 
existence of a "sixth sense*' in various animals, for which they had 
discovered special sense organs, such as, the lateral line in fishes. 

It was (piite natural, then, that Prof. Leydig should come to the con- 
clusion that the pit of the CrotalUUv is the organ of a sixth sense, when 
upon a microscopic examination of the pit's lining he found it supplied 
with a thick nerve, ending in a way the only analogue of which is found 
in the retina of the eye or the labyrinth of the ear. 

Leydig's material was in some resi)ects defective, for he had only 
specimens preserved in alcohol, and in his valuable memoir* ou the sub- 
ject twenty-five years ago he distinctly encouraged the Xorth American 
naturalists to take the matter up and continue his investigations on fresh 
specimens, but, as far as 1 know, nobody has as yet done so. It may 
therefore not be out of place to give a brief synopsis of his observations.

The external layer of the liuiiig of the i)it Leydig foiiud to be a coii- 
tinuatiou of the outer skin, Avhich, however, upon entering the cavity 
becomes thin and considerably modiiied. The granular tubercles grad- 
ually disappear toward the bottom, and the surface is found to be com- 
posed of large angular epidermis plates containing nuclei (fig. 10). 
Underneath this he found a layer of connective tissue, in which the fine 
ramifications of the thick nerve supplying the pit are lost in a granular 
substance which under high power reveals itself as containing numerous 
true, rounded, but pale nuclei. The granular substance he found 
arranged around the nuclei in such a way as to form groups or islands 
of various forms and sizes separated by light narrow spaces. These 
structures can only be regarded as terminal ganglions, and it does not 
seem doubtful that we have here to do with a true sense organ.

Wherein this " sixth sense" consists we do not know, nor do we know 
of anything in the habits of these snakes which would indicate its 
nature, or to what use the animal puts the organ. Future research 
may reveal it, th(mgh ])erhaps man will never fully comprehend the 
nature of a sense which he himself does not possess. 

The "loreaF' pit, so called because of its location in that portiou of 
the snake's face in herpetological terminology known as the "lores," 
being a character exclusively ])ertaiuing to the Crotalid snakes, its pres- 
ence in any of our North American snakes at once designates it as a 
dangerously poisonous snake. It is an unfailing character of our native 
"death vipers," Mith the exception of the Ehq)s, which I have already 
characterized. 

Another unfailing character is, of course, the j)reseuce of long curved 
fangs in the anterior portion in the upper jaw. Since an account of our 
poisonous snakes would manifestly be incomplete were I to omit a 
description of the i^oison apparatus, a brief outline of its structure is 
here presented. 

I stated above that Elaps has two permanently erect and perfo- 
rated fangs in the anterior portion of the upper jaw. In the Pit Vipers

there are similar fangs, but much larger, and difiering from those of 
the Ehip^ by being folded up toward the palate, somewhat like the 
blades of a jackknife when not in use. This must not be understood 
to mean that the fangs themselves are movable; on the contrary, the

viper's faugs are as solidly fixed iu their sockets as are those of the 
Elaps, but while iu the latter (see fig. 3) the maxillary bones, into which 
the fangs are fastened, are elongated and horizontal, as in the harmless 
snakes (see fig. 4), in the Crotalids they are extremely shortened and 

higher than long, so as to appear iu a 
vertical position. In the former the 
fangs are consequently inserted nearly 
at right angles, like the pickax on its 
handle, Avhile in the latter the fang 
more nearly represents the blade, and 
the jawbone the handleof aknile, and 
it is the jawbone which is movable in 
the vertical i)lane, notthe fang alone. 
In order fully to understand the 
mechanism iu question, it is necessary 
to remember that the bones of the head 
of nearly all snakes (figs. 11-13) are so 
loosely joined together as to allow a 
most extraordinary amount of move- 
ment and distention. Elastic ligaments connect bones which in other 
animals are either grown solidly together or articulated by means of 
close joints, hence a snake is capable of swallowing a prey many times 
as thick as the snake's own body. 

As Jilready noted, the upper jawbones (maxillaries) are situated ver- 
tically, one on each side of the anterior portion of the mouth, the hollow 
fang being fastened into tlie lower end of the boue. On the outer face

of the bone there is above a deep cavity foriuiiig the bony walls of the 
" pit " already referred to, which separates two articular surfaces. Tiie 
upper oue at the top of the in axil- ^ 

lary forms with the corresponding 
concavefaceof the lachrynuil bone, 
which projects from and articu- 
lates with the frontal bone, a 
hinge like Joint, allowing consid- 
erable freedom of motion. The 
lower surface receives the flat- 
tened anterior end of the external 
pterygoid bone. It will be seen 
from the accompanymgcut (fig. 14) 
that if the latter bone {a) be moved 
forward or backward, the maxil- 
lary hinges on the lachrymal, and 
that if the pterygoid be pushed 
forward, the fang is erected. 

There are several muscles engaged in producing this erection and 
the opposite motion, the depression of the fang, but we shall only 
mtntion the two principal ones. 

The elevator muscle of the fang is the 
sphenopterygoid muscle (fig. 15, «), which 
arises along the median ridge of the base of 
the skull [d), and running backward is in- 
serted upon the enlarged posterior eud of the 
pterygoid bone. The contraction of this 
muscle pulls (direction l-m fig. 10) the ptery- 
goids forward, which thus push the lower 
end of the maxillary forward, the upper eud 
being held in position by thelachrymal hinge. 
The tip of the fang describing part of a cir- 
cle, finally points downward instead of back- 
ward. The chief retractor muscle, which 
antagonizes the elevator muscle by acting 
in the opposite direction, is the external 
pterygoid (ecto-pteiygoid) muscle (fig. 15, i), 
which arising from the Joint between the 
quadrate bone and the lower Jaw, runs for- 
ward and is inserted on the outside of the 
maxillary bone a little below the joint of the 
latter with the outer pterygoid bone. It 
will be seen that contraction of this muscle 
means a pulling backward of the maxillary bone (in the direction p-e 
fig. 16), resulting in the backwaid and upward movement of the point 
of the fang.

The taii.u' itself is a large, very pointed, and curved tooth containing 
two cavities, the pnlp cavity and the iwison canal, the toriner situated 
on the concave side, the latter on the convex side of the tooth (tig. iM)). 
The poison canal has a more or less slit-shaped opening near the base, 
on the anterior side of the fang, and another slit, narrower and longer 

on the same side, some little dis- 
tance from the very sharply 
pointed ti]). Between these open- 
ings it is often possible to trace a 
more or less well-defined depressed 
line. A microscopic inspection of 
cross sections of the fang reveals 
the fact that the canal is nothing 
but a deep groove, the walls of 
which have closed over it ante- 
riorly, the depressed line indicating 
the meeting of the walls, or the 
" seam." This structure of the fang 
may be easily understood by com- 
paring it to a leaf curling up in drying, the edges meeting and over- 
lapping in the middle, leaving an upper and a lower opening. By making 
sections <»f growing and full-grown fangs of the same individual, the 
evolution of the grooved fang into the " perforated" fang is easily traced, 
and the inexactness of the latter term clearly demonstrated. As a 
consequence of this origin of the canal, it is lined with the same hard 
layer of dentine as the outer side of the fang, for it will be seen that 
this inner lining of the canal is in reality the 
anterior surface, while the outer layer is only 
the i)OSterior surface of the normal tooth. An 
inspection of the accompanying figure (fig. 17), 
which represents a cross section through the 
upper jaw, with the functional full-grown fang 
followed l)y the moreor less uiuleveloped reserve 
fangs, will show this plainly, as the same prin- 
ciple is involved in the Pit Vipers. 

As already stated, the fang is above fixed 
firmly in the socket of the maxillary bone, ''its 
base being luted to the portion of the bone 
around its side and anterior aspect," to borrow 
Dr. Weir Mitchell's words.* "Posteriorly, the 
bone possesses a hollow, in which is lodged the 

tooth sac. In the open mouth of this alveolar process, within the mucous 
membrane, and upon the pterygoid bone, lie one behind and below 
another, the reserve fangs, each smaller than the one in front and less

and less developed, uutil the situation of the last whicli is visible is 
marked by a minute papilla alone. I have counted from 8 to 10 of 
these on each side. When the fang is lost by natural process, it is 
replaced within a few days; when violently displaced, several weeks 
sometimes elapse before the next fang is fixed firmly enough to be useful 
to the snake. If the functional fang be lost or shed, the next tooth 
gradually assumes its position," and finally, occupying the place of the 
lost one, becomes anchylosed. 

In the same manner as the hollow fang is developed from the grooved 
fang, and this again from the plain solid tooth, so is the poison gland 
evolved from the ordinary salivary gland by a specialization of the 
yellow portion of the latter, as already mentioned nnder the opistho- 
glyph snakes. 

The typical venom gland is found in its fullest development among 
the Pit Yiijers, and is located on each side of the head below and behind

the eye. The shape is that of a flattened almond, the pointed end 
toward the front and below the eye, tapering to a narrow duct, which 
carries the poison to the inlet at the base of the fang. The relative size 
of the organ may best be understood by a glance at the accompanying 
figure (fig. 18.) 

The interior structure of the gland may be described briefly as con- 
sisting of a basal cavity into which the small ducts of the glands open. 
These ducts run toward the walls of the gland, branching, and finally 
ending in minute blind bags, the whole system of ducts being sup- 
ported by a network of numerous fine threads and thin sheets of fibrous 
tissue. The ducts are lined with a more elongated epithelium, the blind 
pouches with angular nucleated epithelial cells.

POISON 



The external covering of the gland is made up of two more or less 
distinct layers of fibrous tissue, the outer one being continued pos- 
teriorly in a ribbon-like ligament running backward and inserting itself 
upon the joint of the jaw (fig. 18, e). A short ligament on the side 
_ ^ _ _ facing the skull attaches the gland firmly 

to the latter, and a third one below con- 
nects with the external pterygoid nuiscle 
(fig. 15, c). 

At the anterior end of tlie gland the cap- 
sule continues as the outer covering of the 
duct which carries the poison from the gland 
to the fang. This duct, in its normal posi- 
tion, makes a sudden upward curve (fig. 18, 
fl') under the eye, descending from which 
it follows the i^osterior wall of the pit and 
finally passes over the rounded outer front 
edg(^ of the maxillary bone, at the base of 
which it meets the upper opening, or inlet, 
of the canal through the fang. 

Until Prof. Jeffries Wyman, in 18G0, 
and, about simultaneously, Dr. Christopher 
Johnston, i^ublished opinions to the effect that the poison duct does 
not enter the canal of the fang, it was generally held that it actually 
continued inside of the channel. This latter view has been revived 
quite recently by Dr. F. Niemann, who not only describes this arrange- 
ment, but figures longitudinal and transverse sections 
of it as seen by him in a crotaloid snake, Bothrops 
lanceolatus* The longitudinal section is reproduced 
here as fig. J9, the transverse one as fig. 20, The latter 
shows at a^ the poison canal lined with the duct, which, 
even inside of the fang is characterized by its epithelial 
lining. As this opens up the question again, and makes 
future research necessary, and as Mr. Niemann seems to 
be ignorant t of the investigations referred to, it may 
be well to quote their evidence a little more fully. 

Prof. Wyman's account of some dissections of the poison apparatus 
of the Eattlesnake was read at a meeting of the Boston Society of

In spite of the apparent conclusiveness of Mr. Niemann's figures, I am compelled 
to remark that his paper contains several indications of carelessness Avhich makes 
it imperative to receive his conclusions with extreme care. That anyone should 
attempt an investigation of that kind without knowiug and quoting Dr. S. Weir 
Mitchell's epoch-making labors, is scarcely reassuring in the first place, but there 
seems to be even less reason for a confusion of such terms as Solenoglyph for Opis- 
toglyph on p. 282, and the mistaken identification of the ectopterygoid bone for the 
maxillary, pp. 277 and 279. 



POISONOUS SNAKES OP NORTH AMERICA. 371 

Natural History, May 16, 1860 (Proceedings, Vol. vii; published July, 
1860, pp. 293-294), and is quite brief, as follows: 

The duct proper does uot reach the opening at the base of the tooth, but ends at 
a short distance from it. The communication beyond this is made by means of the 
sheath of the tooth, which is too loose to prevent the poison from escaping around 
the exterior of the tooth instead of entering its canal, were it uot for the circumstance 
that as the tooth is protruded the sheath is crowded back, and thus made to fit 
tightly the circumference. 

Dr. Johnston's statement is much more elaborate, and includes an 
interesting- account of the successive growth and advance of the reserve 
fangs. It was written by him as early as October 3, 1859, and given 
to Dr. Weir Mitchell for publication.* 

After discussing the probability of a periodical shedding of the fangs 
and describing the successive formation and growth of the secondary 
or reserve fangs. Dr. Johnston proceeds as follows: 

At length the prime fang is removed, if spontaneously, by the atrophy of the pulp, 
and, I believe, by erosion of the basal anchylosed portion ; if it be broken off by vio- 
lence the freedom of the pseudo-socket is accomplished by the same means. And 
now the fust tooth of reserve is urged forward into a recess in the maxillary bone 
directly adjacent to and on the inner side of the fallen fang; and the requisite 
advancement is brought about by the developmental r(s a iergo of the remaining 
reserve pulp, and probably also by the traction in front exerted by the cicatrizing 
parts. It is evident that the fang emerges from its capsule, and that the point and 
crown repose in the den, but the base is closely invested with the capsular remains 
under the form of a periosteal expansion, which is the mediate bond of union between 
the base and the new and shallow socket of the maxilla. 

As may be perceived upon examination at this stage, two sockets coexist in the 
same jaw, the inner, new one, supporting the recently promoted fang, and the outer, 
old, and now vacant (me, which is fast becoming disencumbered of the vestiges per- 
taining to its former resident. In this maxilla the new fang occupies the innermost 
part, having the old socket on the outer side, while in the opposite maxilla, the 
older venom fang may be discovered in its normal situation, leaving the recess to its 
inner side vacant for the temporary lodgment of its successor. Or, both fangs 
being recently fixed to the jaw, the vacuities will both be formed on the outside, 
and all the reserve fangs will appear to follow backward and outward in direct line. 

Now, let us look at the situation of the poison duct and examine into the mode by 
which it is brought into relation with the fang. 

The venom duct arising from the gland makes a bend upward, immediately 
beneath the eye, then advances forward under the skin as far as the crotaline fos- 
sette [pit], and lying upon the maxilla externally, plunges downward, and pierces 
the gum in front of the fang, where it terminates in a papilla, which projects slightly 
into the proximal aperture of the tooth. In this position it is maintained by the 
gum, which clasps the base laterally and in front with considerable firmness, its 
inferior or distal edge encompassing the annular enlargement already alluded to. 
Nor is there any other than a mediate application of the poison papilla against the 
fang, for, as the whole venom canal of each tooth is really ujjon the outside of the 
organ, no special membrane lines it, which might be continuous with the duct that 
discharges into the ui)per aperture. 

Such is the condition of things in an old fang, occupying its normal exterior posi- 
tion. But when the tooth drops out, or is broken, the gum is left entire; or, if its

1861.) 




372 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

exodus iias been forced, the gum escapes with Liceration only. lu either case, how- 
ever, the gum remains as a barrier, limiting the progress of the advancing reserve 
fang; and while the latter is establisliing itself provisionally the gum encircles it, 
clasps it tenaciously, and l>rings the poison papilla in opposition with its dental 
aperture. As time passes, the new fang moves gradually outward to its permanent 
seat; the inner maxillary recess is restored, and the first fang of reserve is againdis- 
covered. on the inner side of its senior, resting with its pulp attachment in the bot- 
tom of the recess. Thus, the reserve fang has become an adult functioning fang, 
nor does its pulp relax its hold until fate or mischance dislodge the now fatally- 
armed tooth which it animates. 

Dr. Mitcliell adds that although it is often, or usually, the case that, 

as stated by ])r. Johnston, the tirst reserve fang enters the semilunar 

socket in the maxilla to rhe inside of the active fang, it is not uncommon 

to find the two fixed fangs unsymmetrically 

placed, one on the inner, the other on the outer 

Q side, of their respective sockets, or both on the

In the uon-poisonous snakes the closing of the 
mouth is effected by the three temporal muscles, the anterior, the 
middle, and the posterior. The anterior temporal arises from the 
parietal crest and its continuation on the postfrontal bone, turns back- 
ward around the joint of the lower jaw and is inserted on the latter 
l)one; the middle temporal arises from the posterior half of the parietal 
crest, runs downward and forward under the former and is similarly 
inserted, while the posterior temporal, the strongest of them all, arises 
from the quadrate bone and is inserted on the inside of the entire length 
of the angular bone of the lower jaw. 

In the crotalids this arrangement is considerably modified (fig. 
18). The posterior (c) and middle {g) temporal muscles remain essen- 
tially as in the non-venomous snakes, and their function is also the 
same, viz, by contraction to pull the lower jaw up against the upper 
one, or, in other words, to close the moutli. The anterior temporal (^), 
however, has now both a different rise and a different function. In- 
stead of connecting with the cranial Avail, it has lost all connection with 
the latter and arises Irom the upper posterior portion of the firm, tendi- 
nous capsule of the poison gland («), runs backward under the ribbon- 
like ligament [e] which fastens the gland to the joint of the jaw, winds

around this joint and inserts itself {¥) broadly upon tlie lower jaw. It 
may easily be shown that a contraction of these muscles will produce a 
tremendous pressure up(m the poison gland. It is also apparent that the 
closing of the mouth does not necessarily affect the gland, as only the 
posterior and middle temporals need be employed in the action, and 
that the pressure exerted by the anterior temporal is voluntary, as well 
as independent of the closing of the jaw. 

While thus the flow of poison is regulated by the pressure upon the 
gland, there are additional safeguards against waste of the precious 
fluid. Dr: Weir Mitchell has discovered tbat the visible thickening of 
the poison duct anterior to the sudden turn under the eye is due to an 
increase in the amount of the fibrous tissue of the walls, and not to any 
widening of the canal. As he also found the walls of the duct at this 
place to contain nonstriated muscular tissue, he concludes that the 
enlargement is a real ring-muscle, or sphincter, w^hich by its contrac- 
tion closes the duct, and he demonstrated the correctness of his con- 
clusion by experiments. He found that when in the living and active 
Kattlesuake the jaws were separated, and the fangs caught on the edge 
of a cup and erected, it was usually very difficult to produce a flow of 
venom against the will of the snake, even when the operator pressed 
upon the glands, but that on the contrary it was easy to force the poison 
out along the duct and through the fang, if the snake was dead or insen- 
sible from chloroform. 

The whole poison apparatus has very appropriately been compared 
to-a hypodermic bulb syringe, the needle, with its obliquely cut point 
and slit-like outlet, representing the fangs, the bulb corresponding to 
the poison glands, and the muscles of the hand which presses the bidb 
performing the same task as the anterior temporal muscle. 

The nature of the poisonous fluid secreted by the gland in the pit 
vipers seems to be almost as diagnostic as the apparatus itself. The 
discussion of its properties is so closely connected with the question of 
antidotes and remedies that a summary of the interesting results of 
Drs. Mitchell and Eeichert's recent studies and discoveries in this field 
will be reserved for (juotation in the closing chapter of this paper, and 
I shall now devote some space to the action of the snake in utilizing 
the formidable weapon which has been described. 

The action referred to is not a "bite" pure and simple, it is the com- 
bination of a bite and a blow delivered with such lightning rapidity 
tliat it is very difficult, if not impossible, for the unaided eye to follow 
the various movements composing it and to record their occurrence in 
the proper sequence. The testimony furnished by our eyes as to the 
movements and sequence involved in an action as familiar and com- 
paratively slow as that of a running horse was proven utterly false by 
the instantaneous photographs, and it is very likely that there are simi- 
lar surprises in store for us when some one shall have rigged up a "bat- 
tery" of cameras and fixed the successive movements of the striking

Eattlesnake on pai)ei' in .such a inauiier as to leave no more room for 
guesses, interpretations, and disputes. 

How desirable sucb a series of pictures is may well be understood 
by a reference to an extended discussion which was carried on in the 
well known New York weekly. Forest and Stream, about two years ago. 
In the issue for May 26, 1892,* the editor called attention to a state- 
ment by the greatest herpetological authority in the country with regard 
to the action of the llattlesnake, and which the editor characterizes as 
"very extraordinary." The statement is to the following effect: 

The species of this genus [Crotahisl are of rather sluggish movements, and are not 
quiik to bite, unless trodden on. They throw the body into a coil and sound the 
rattle, giving a sigmoid llexure to the anterior part of the body, on which the head 
is poised with o])en mouth ready for action. At this time drops of the ]ioisonous 
saliva fall from the fangs, and by a violent expulsion of air from the lungs are thrown 
at their enemy. t 

It is evidently the last half of the account which called forth the 
criticism and led the editor to call upon the readers "to contribute 
some evidence on the point in question." In the very next number two 
observers controvert the statement in decided language. Few men are 
such keen observers or have had such opportunities for observation as 
Maj. Charles E. Bendire, from whose reply | we quote as follows: 

During a residence of more than twenty -five years in the western portion of the 
United States, a considerable part of this time having been spent in the field, where 
Rattlesnakes were and are still common, and during which time I have seen hun- 
dreds of these reptiles, I have never yet observed one with its mouth open when 
coiled and ready to strike; neither have I ever seen one attempt to throw poison, 
even when teased and much provoked. 

The other reader, who signs himself J. M. W., and who evidently has 
had some experience with Battlers, concludes § a similar protest with 
the following statement: 

While living in southern Illinois I had a captive nearly 5 feet long — a vicious 
fighter, who would strike at any object thrust toward him, and often caught his 
curved fangs in the fine wire netting covering the cage, thus holding his o])en mouth 
in position for a fraction of a minute. The venom from each fang, a light amber- 
colored fluid in drops about the size of No. G shot, could be seen on the gauze where 
it collected when he struck, but there was nothing more, no saliva, no spitting or 
hissing, nor have I ever seen these manifestations in any of the many individuals 
that have come under my innnediate notice. Nor have I ever seen a snake's mouth 
open, with fangs exposed, while waiting a chance to strike. When they strike, the 
jaws open at an angle of nearly 180 degrees, but not until the final moment. 

In the next issue is a very interesting note by Dr. M. U. Ellzey,|| from 
which the following sentence is quoted : 

I have seen Rattlers in coil, and seen them strike from coil very often, but never 
saw one holding its mouth open, witli erect fangs, dripping poisonous saliva.

POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 375 

For several weeks similar accounts, some, however, more or less mixed 
with decided ''snake stories," appeared in the columns of the paper,* 
with one exception, that of '-E. D. W. S." (June 10, 1892, p. 5G2), whose 
experience in California with a "Black Eattler," which "arched his head 
and neck and hissed or blew quite a quantity of froth or sinttle,^^ seems to 
prove nothing, as it proves too much. The discussion was finally con- 
cluded by Prof.' E. D. Cope, who disclaimed having represented in the 
paragraph criticised the normal action of the rattler when ready to 
strike, as the following quotation t shows: 

I did not state that Rattlesnakes always maintain the position described when 
about to bite. On the contrary, it is only when prevented from either biting or 
rnnning away that they act in the manner mentioned. If a Rattlesnake is annoyed 
by being stirred up with a stick and jiebbles, etc.. thrown at him, and is prevented 
from escaping, if he is in good condition and the weather is warm he will some- 
times act as I have stated from actual observations made on tlie Crotalus confiiientiis 
in New Mexico. When the mouth is opened widely, the masseter muscle compresses 
the poison gland, t and, if the latter is full, forces. some of it to escape through the 
duct, and it drops from the fangs. This is an observation Avhich has been often 
made on various venomous snakes. If the snake expels air from the lungs in hiss- 
ing, as it generally does when on the defensive, the drops will be thrown out with 
the air toward the enemy. I do not suppose, and did not state, that this was done 
voluntarily by the snake; it is simply a necessary consequence of the mechanical 
conditions. 

I hii vereviewed this controversy so fully because it shows thenecessity 
of an authoritative account of the normal action of the snake when 
striking. During the discussion one writer quoted a few disconnected 
l)assages from Dr. S. Weir Mitchell's elaborate article on the subject, 
but as a clear understanding of the action involved can only be gained 
from a detailed account, I have no hesitation in reprinting nearly the 
entire chapter devoted by the famous specialist on the rattlesnake and 
its poison, especially because the original is now out of i)rint, and 
there is no other account eciualing it in accuracy and clearness, and 
there is not apt to be much added to it or corrected in it until we 
shall have the series of photographs alluded to above. His account is 
published in the third chapter of his "Researches upon the Venom of 
the Rattlesnake" (published in 1861 by the Smithsonian Institution as 
one of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge), entitled "The 
Physiological Mechanism of the Bite of the Crotalus," and is to the 
following effect: § 

When the Rattlesnake is in repose and unmolcvSted, it sometimes lies at length, 
sometimes coiled or wrapped fold on fold in the loops formed by other snakes which

t The masseter muscle is the same as is above called the temporal muscle. It is 
difficult to see.how in opening the mouth this muscle can compress the poison gland. , 
This can only be done by a contraction of the muscle, but this contraction must 
necessarily close the mouth.

may liappcn to be iu the same box. So soon, however, as cause is seen for alarm, 
the snake extricates itself, if among others, and at once throws its body into the 
coil so familiar to any one who has seen serpents, whether venomous or not. Some- 
times on the edge, more often in the center of the coil, the tail projects far enough 
to admit of its vibrating freely and with singular swiftness. The head is raised a 
little above the rest of the body, but uot usually more than 3 or 4 inches, even in 
large snakes. The neck and upper end of the trunk are uot thrown into complete 
circles, but lie in two or three abrupt curves across the mass of the coiled body. 
The snake is now in position to strike. While thus at bay, in an attitude of singu- 
lar grace, the long black tongue is frefiuently protruded — a common movement among 
all serpents when irritated. Just before the blow the snake makes a hissing sound, 
which is caused by the act of exi^iratiou, and is due to the passage of air through 
the narrow glottis. It is louder iu certain innocent serpents than in the crotalus. 

The mechanism of the forward cast of the body, which next occurs, is a very 
simple matter. The muscles which lie upon the convexity of the bending formed 
by the upper part of the snake are suddenly and violently contracted, so as abrujitly 
to straighten the body, and thrust it forward in a direct line. The force resulting 
from this motion is uot very great, as I have often ascertained when a snake has 
struck the end of a pole which I was holding, nor could it alone suffice to bury the 
fang in a tough skin were it not for the acts which follow and aid it. In effecting 
this forward thru.st of the neck and head the serpent employs only the upper part 
of its body, and cousequeutly is unable, under any circumstauces, to strike at a 
greater distance than one-half its length, while usually its projectile range does not 
exceed a third of its length. An impression prevails that when the snake lies coiled 
its head is raised very high to enable it to strike downward. It seems, however, 
to be of no moment in what direction the danger threatens, since it can at will 
cast itself forward, downward, or almost directly upward. 

As the animal comes within reach, of which the snake does not always judge with 
accuracy, the latter executes the movement just described. At the instant and while 
in motion the jaws are separated widely and the head is bent somewhat back upon 
the first cervical bones, so as to bring thejioint of the fang into a favorable position 
to penetrate the opposing flesh. Owing to the backward curve of the tooth, this of 
necessity involves the opening of the jaws to such an extent that an observer stand- 
ing above the snake can see the white mucous membrane of the mouth as the blow 
is given. The peculiar articulation of the lower jaw upon an intermediary bone in 
place of upon the body of the skull greatly facilitates this action. On examining 
the neck and head it will also be seen that the head, under the influence of the cer- 
vical prolongation of the mass of the spinal muscles, is capable of being bent back- 
ward to no inconsiderable extent. Consentaneously with the forward thrust of the 
body and with the opening of the mouth the spheno-pterygoids act from their Arm 
cranial attachments to draw forward the pterygoid plate, and thus, through its 
attachment to the maxillary, to erect the fang. The function of elevating the fang 
belongs alone to this muscle, which has no analogue in the other vertebrate animals. 
I have frequently tested its power to raise the fang by stimulating it with galvanic 
or other irritants, after decapitating the snake, and, although some French observers 
seem to have had doubts as to the agencies which eflect the elevation and depression 
of the fang, there does not seem to me to be any reason to doubt the share which the 
spheno-pterygoid takes in this mechanism. That the mere act of openiug the mouth 
of necessity raises the weapon has often been affirmed, but it is only necessary to 
separate the jaws of a crotalus to be convinced that this is not the ease, and that 
even when the mouth is widely opened the animal has the most perfect control over 
the movement of the faug, raising or depressing it at will. 

• As the spheno-pterygoid acts, the maxillary bone rocks forward upon its lachry- 
mal articulation. When the motion reaches its limit, and is checked by the liga- 
ment which I have described, the supporting lachrymal bone, in turn, yields to the

power applied through the maxillary bone. These movements elevate a little the 
muzzle of the snake, so as to give to the face a very siugular expression during the 
act of striking. Their more obvious and important result is the elevation of the 
fang, which, rising, thrusts off from its convexity the cloak-like vagina-deutis so 
that it gathers in loose folds at its base (fig. 22.) 

As the unsheathed tooth penetrates the flesh of the victim a series of movements 
occur, which must be contemporaneous, or nearly so. The body of the snake, still 
resting in coil, makes, as it were, an anchor, while the muscles of the neck contract- 
ing draw upon the head so violently that when a small animal is the prey it is 
often dragged back bv the effort here described. If now the head and fang remained

passive the pull upon the head would withdraw the fang too soon ; but at this 
moment the head is probably stayed in its position by the muscles below, or in front 
of the spine; while the pterygoideus externus and spheuo-palatine acting upon the 
fang through their respective insertions, into the posterior apophysis of the sub- 
maxillary bone, and the inside of the palate bone, draw its point violently back- 
ward, so as to drive it more deeply into the flesh. The muscles alluded to, there- 
fore, antagonize the spheno-pterygoid. At this instant occurs a third series of 
motions, which result in the further deepening of wound and in the injection of -the 
poison. The lower jaw is closed upon the bitten part or member. Where the surface 
struck is flat and large this action will have but slight influence. 

Where the jaw shuts on a small limb or memljer, the consequent eflects will be far 
more likely to prove serious, since the power thus to shut the mouth materially aids 



378 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

the purpose of the blow. The closure of the jaw is effected by the posterior, middle, 
and anterior temporal muscles. The first two teud simply to shut the mouth; the 
anterior temporal, however, is so folded about the poison gland that while it draws 
up the lowerjaw.it simultaneously compresses two-thirds of the body of the gland. 
This force is applied in such a manner as to squeeze the lluids out of the upper and 
back parts of the gland and drive them forward into the duct. The anterior lower 
angle of the gland, as well as a portion of the duct, is subjected to similar pressure 
at the same instant, owing to the flat tendinous insertion of a part of the external 
pterygoid upon the parts in question. 

It will thus be observed that the same muscular acts which deepen the wound fix 
the prey, and inject the venom through the ducts and into the tissues penetrated by 
the teeth. The whole process here described at such length is the work of an 
instant, and the serpent's next effort is to disentangle itself from its victim. This 
step is eftected by relaxing the muscles of the neck so as to leave the head passive, 
while the continued traction of the muscles of the body pull upon it, aud thus with- 
draw the fang, over which glides the elastic mucous sheath as the pterygoid, again 
acting, depresses the fang, and the servient recovers its posture of defense. 

It happens, not infrequently, that the teeth of the lower jaw catch in the skin of 
the bitten animal, and thus prevent the snake from retreating at once. When this 
takes place the serpent shakes its head from side to side with a motion which so 
nearly resembles the shake a dog gives its prey that it has been mistaken by at least 
one observer for an expression of rage. It is really an attempt to escape; nor is it 
always successful, since a large animal will often drag a snake until the fangs them- 
selves break loose aud are left in or on the bitten part. 

In cousidering this portion of our subject it is well to notice what has been too 
much overlooked, the fact that, while the snake commonly employs both fangs, it 
does often inflict but a single wound. When obtaining venom from living snakes, 
I have been accustomed to allow them to bite upon the inner edge of a cup, and I 
have observed that on some occasions both fangs were used at once, and that on 
others only one was active. Or, the fangs were used in succession, an appreciable 
interval of time intervening. If this occur when a snake at freedom strikes an 
object, it is, of course, possible that the animal may escape before the second fang 
is driven in by the traction of its proper external pterygoid muscle. At all events, 
it is certain that these facts should receive due appreciation in estimating the dan- 
ger of a given bite and the value of an antidote. 

There remains for consideration one muscular motion, which I have observed to 
accompany the eftort to bite when the snake is held by the back of the neck. It 
consists in a turning outward of the points of the fangs, so as to separate them 
from one another.* This divergence of the fang points is disadvantageous, inas- 
much as it causes them to enter somewhat obliquely, and frequently throws one 
fang beyond the part bitten, when that part happens to be small. It has a use with 
reference to the snake itself, since the fang points, when thus widely separated, lie 
oustide of the lower jaw, and are thus prevented from wounding it. This purpose is 
greatly aided by the action of a muscle analogous to themylo-hyoid, which approxi- 
mates the anterior extremities of the lower maxillary, or mandibular bones, so as 
to make narrow the extremity of the jaw. The protection thus obtained is very 
essentia], since the serpent always closes the jaw violently when biting, but does 
not always succeed in seizing its prey. Whether or not this divergence of the fang 
points occurs when the snake bites unrestrainedly, I can not say, but as I have been 
very often astonished at the distance between the wounds, when both fangs had 
taken effect, it is highly probable that it occurs under all circumstances. 

The power with which the veuom is ejected from the tooth depends somewhat 
upon the amount contained in the gland and its ducts. When the snake fails to 

* I could not determine whether this divergence took place when the snake, at 
freedom, struck an animal. 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 379 

strike the object aimed at the poison is sometimes projected several feet. In one 
case which is known to me, it was thrown into the eye of a man standing 5 or 6 feet 
from the snake, when it struck upward at a stick held above its coil. 

The study of the complicated mechanism which we have endeavored to explain 
will aid ns in understanding several points of interest in connection with the bite 
of the rattlesnake. 

It must be perfectly ajjparent that in a sequence of movements so elaborate it will 
occasionally happen that, from a failure in some one of the essential motions, the 
ultimate purpose of the whole will be interfered with. Thus, it sometimes chances 
that the serpent miscalculates the distance, and fails from this cause. Or, again, 
when the object aimed at is very near, the initial force of the blow is lost, and the 
tooth does not enter; no uncommon occurrence, where the animal struck is an old dog 
with a tough skin. Again, if the upper jaw be not elevated sufficiently, the fangs 
are sometimes driven backward, by the force of the forward impulse, as they touch 
the part attacked, and the venom is then apt to escape between the tooth and the 
fovering mucous cloak. Upon one occasion, having allowed a small snake to strike 
a dog, the former became entangled, owing to the hooked teeth of the lower maxil- 
lary bone having caught in the skin. Upon examining the snake closely, the dog 
being held, I found that the convexity of the fangs lay against the skin, on which 
were thrown one or two drops of venom. On remoA'ing the snake, and inspecting 
the part struck, I could find no fang wound, although the skin was visibly torn by 
the smaller teeth. I have seen the rattlesnake strike with great apparent ferocity, 
a number of times, when I have been unable to discover any fang wound whatso- 
ever, and this has taken place, occasionally, with small animals, such as the rabbit, 
which must have been seriously eft'ected by even a small amount of venom. 

It scarcely ever happens that an animal is bitten without a part of the injected 
venom being cast on the skin near the wound made by ihe fangs. This wasted 
material probably escapes from the duct, where it is in opposition with the lower 
opening of the fang canal, and may be merely that excess of fluid which the fang 
can not carry. In some cases, however, it is quite possible that the relations of the 
fang and the duct are so disturbed that the venom never enters the tooth at all. It 
is certainly true, as has been already stated, and as Dr. Wyman has shown, that the 
fang must be fully erected in order that the duct shall be so tirmly held in contact 
with the fang, as to insure the passage of the venoui through this latter organ. 

Finally, it sometimes happens that the blow is given, the fang enters, and from 
the quick starting of the animal injured, or from some other interrupting cause, it 
is withdrawn so soon that the larger portion of the poison is thrown harmless upon 
the surface near the g^vound. Under these circumstances, the resulting symptoms are, 
of course, trifling, and how well such an occurrence would be calculated to deceive 
the observer, who employed an antidote in a like case, can be readily conceived. 

In a more popular paper* Dr. Mitchell remarks that the nervous 
mechanism which controls the act of striking seems to be in the spinal 
cord, for if we cut off a snake's head and then pinch its tail the stump 
of the neck returns and with some accuracy hits the hand of the experi- 
menter if he has the nerve to hold on. A little Irishman who took care 
of the doctor's laboratory astonished him by coolly sustaining the test, 
but did it by closing his eyes and so shutting out for a moment the too 
suggestive view of the returning stump. In the memoir previously 
quoted, on the other hand, he mentions that in one or two instances 
persons who were ignorant of the possibility of this movement have 
been so terrified at the blow which has greeted them as to faint on the

380 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

spot. The educated public which has seen so luany wonderful tales 
concerning- snakes disproved have in turn become skeptical about almost 
everything told about them not of the most commonplace character. 
Hence, the somewhat ironical introduction to the following story, which 
made its round through the daily press of the country, and which is no 
doubt correct in every particular : 

Prof. Brewer, of Yale, recently told a good snake story. Years ago be was in Cali- 
fornia and bad bis tripod and otber surveyor's instruments in tbe field. Stepping 
along in tbe bnsbes be felt a movement under bis feet, and found tbat be was stand- 
ing on a 4i-foot Rattlesnake — a large, vicious and figbtiug fellow. But tbe snake 
was so pinioned tbat be could not strike tbe tbick boot tbat beld bim fast. Prof. 
Brewer beld tbe rattler's bead down witb bis tripod and cut it off. Tben be 
cut off bis rattles. Stepping aside, be saw tbe body of tbe snake, partly coiled, 
lying very still. Taking out bis rule to measure its lengtb, tbe professor took bold 
of tbe serpent to straigbteu bim out. 

"Quick as an electric sliock,'' said Prof. Brewer, "tbat beadless snake broiigbt tbe 
bloody stump over and struck a bard blow upon tbe back of my band." He added: 
"I knew tbat bis bead was off and tbat be could not poison me, but tbat quick and 
bard blow of tbe rattler made my bair stand on end." 

However, the most dramatic incident of this kind is undoubtedly Mr. 
George Catlin's adventure on the Kio Trombute, one of the tributaries 
of the Amazon River in South America. The story as told by Mr. 
Catlin's comjjanlon * is to the effect that Mr. Catlin having shot at the 
head of a huge Rattlesnake had apparently missed it, as the snake was 
seen to strike and hit him in the breast, where it left a bloody spot on 
the shirt. The dress was torn open and one of his half-breed compan- 
ions prepared to suck the poision out of the supposed wound; but 
looking a moment for the puncture, he got up, and with a smile of 
exultation he said, "There's no harm; you'll find the snake without a 
head." In the weeds near-by the snake was found, closely coiled up, 
where he had fallen, with his headless trunk erect and ready for another 
spring, the head having been shot oft'. 

If we make some allowance for the necessarily high coloring of the 
narrative and the exaggeration almost inseparable from an account of 
an occurrence so strange and exciting, there seems to be no good rea- 
son to doubt that it took place in the main as related. 

Beyond the "pit" there is but little to distinguish the Pit Vipers as 
a whole from the other vipers, and, beyond the poison apparatus and 
the changes in the various organs of the head <lirectly or indirectly 
connected with this apparatus, they differ not materially from the bulk 
of the snakes. One group of the pit vipers possesses, however, an 
organ quite unique, not only among the vipers, but among all the snakes 
as well, so that it seems the better plan to treat of it in the present con- 
nection instead of later on under the head of that particular group. I 
refer to the "rattle" of the Rattlesnakes.

It may seem superfluous to describe this well-known instrument in 
detail, but as the internal structure may not be clear to everybody, and 
as without such a knowledge it will be diiificult to explain the develop- 
ment and use of this organ, we are obliged to investigate it more closely. 

It will be seen (tigs. 23, 24) that the tail end of the Rattlesnake instead 
of gradually ta})ering to a point covered by a cone-shaped more or less

acute scale, as in most other snakes, continues rather thick to where 
the rattle is appended. The rattle itself in its perfection is shown in 
the above ligures, and appears externally to consist of a series of 
strongly compressed horny rings joined rather loosely together, the 
terminal one, the so-called "button," ending iu a compressed, somewhat 
cone-shaped cap, which is set off from the basal swelling by a slight 
constriction.

The upper and lower outlines of the rattle will be seen not to be 
straight but curved lines, the tendency of the joints to sag downward 
by their own weight being counteracted by the fact that the width of 
each ring is greater at the lower edge of the rattle than at the upper. 
Mr. Quelch, the director of the museum in Georgetown, Demerara, has 
shown that the object of this arrangement is to protect the rattle

against injury and moisture when the snake is moving over the ground 
by keeping the somewhat delicate instrument automatically raised.

tbe organ (fig. 24). It is tlien seen tbat each "ring" is in reality a 
"button" tbat fits ov.er and conceals tbe terminal portion of tbe fore- 
going (proximal) joint, leaving exposed only tbe basal swelling, tbe 
ring. Tbe joints are consequently a series of partly overlapping tbin 
horny capsules or "cones." These "cones" have a wavy outline con- 
sisting of two or three swellings and two constrictions. It will also be 
observed that the free edge of tbe cone is bent inward and fits into tbe 
basal groove of tbe preceding cone, so that tbe basal swelling of tbe 
more distal cone clasps around tbe second swelling of tbe one nearer 
tbe body. Tbe opening being narrower than this swelling, tbe two cones 
are effectually linked together by means of a kind of restricted ball- 
and-socket articulation, modified by the shape of the joints. 

It will furtbermore be noted, uj^on actually dissecting the tail end 
of tbe body, tbat tbe basal cone of the rattle forms tbe horny cover of

In vei-y early embryos of the Ground Rattlesnake, Sistrurus milia- 
rius, some of them already 3 inches long, tbe tail was not yet furnished 
with scales, though tbe entire body was well provided. Outwardly 
the tail was short, thick, blunt, slightly compressed, but with no indica- 
tion of the characteristic feature so prominent after birth. Embryos 
of a nearly allied species, tbe Massasauga, 8. catenatus, however, which 
were older and twice as large, showed a distinct promise of tbe future 
rattle in the shape and size of tbe terminal cap, or button (figs. 26, 27),

which is as yet incomi)lete aud but little more tlum half what it ulti- 
mately becomes. There are now scales on the tail, but tbey show no 
fusion with the button around its front border. Within tlie button the 
vertebriB are still distinct and surrounded by muscle. The next step

part of each ring having been now acquired. In no case is there any 
disposition on the part of the scales to fuse with the button. Inside 
of the latter the changes have been even greater; the vertebrne, still 
plainly outlined, have consolidated into a single elongate mass, the 
size of which is being increased by both lateral and terminal growth; 
the vertical processes have grown together; and the muscles have been 
displaced by the enlarging bone and the thickening skin. Figs. 30 
and 31 finally show us the status of a 14-inch-long Prairie Eattlesnake,

Grotalus conjluentus, which was taken, with the third button about 
half grown, when the process of pushing back the second ring was 
well under way. The first ring had been set free with the first slough, 
holding only by the collar, and if the snake had been allowed to live a 
little longer, the second sloughing would have discovered the third 
button perfected, clasped by the second ring, the latter pushed back 
and loosened from the balance of the epidermis. 

It should be added that the period of appearance of the first joints 
seems to vary, inasmuch as there are apparently trustworthy records of 
embryos having been found with more than one joint,* It is interest- 
ing, in this connection, to remember Dr. Hay's observation thathognose 
snakes commenced to shed their skin within a few minutes after having 
left the egg.t As the young Rattlesnake leaves the egg covering before 
being born, may it not also occur that it sheds its skin before birth — 
at least, sometimes ?

384 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

How hard it is to overcome a popular error which has once taken 
hold of the public mind is strikingly exemplified in the matter of the 
growth of the rattle. It was obsfrved long ago, and commented upon 
by competent observers and scientists, that the common belief that each 
ring on a Eattlesnake's rattle represents a year of its life, and that its 
age consequently can be ascertained by simply counting the number of 
rings, is entirely erroneous. Still, the belief is so common that every 
scientific writer who treats of Kattlesnakes finds it necessary to reiDeat 
the (in print) threadbare denunciation of this fallacy, but evidently 
without the slightest effect so far as the general public is concerned, 
for the next newspaper report of the latest Ivattlesnake killed in the 
neighborhood, and the newest edition of certain "popular" natural 
histories, repeat the same old fallacy. I do not expect to have better 
success than my jiredecessors in this respect, though it would not seem 
to be difficult to make people understand that the rattle is a delicate 
instrument which easily breaks; that old and huge Rattlers are often 
found with but one or a few rings; that a variable number of joints are 
added each year; and that the production of a ring can be accomplished 
in the course of every two or three months. 

On the other hand, it is often asserted by good scientific authorities 
that a new joint is formed at each general sloughing of the skin. 
Schlegel* seems to have been the first to suggest this idea, which has 
been indorsed, among others, by Garman, who says {op. cit, p. 259) that 
the Rattlesnakes differ from other snakes " in retaining a portion of 
each slough, that covering the tip of the tail, to form one of the rings 
of the rattle." 

It has already been shown that the formation of the rings, or but- 
tons, is a process of sloughing analogous to, or rather identical with, 
that of the rest of the outer skin, but this does not necessarily imply 
that the sloughing takes place at the same time, or that a new button is 
formed every time a sloughing of the skin takes place. Recent obser- 
vations by a prominent Russian investigator. Dr. A. E. Feoktistow, 
seem to indicate that the two processes are, to some extent at least, 
independent. His conclusions are sufficiently important to warrant 
the following quotations from his paper: t 

In June, 1887, 1 received ten living specimens of Crotalus durissus, which I have 
since been able to observe closely. Owing to wiint of a sufficient quantity of suita- 
ble food (the animals refused to eat anything but very young rabbits), I lost five of 
them in the course of the first six mouths. The remainder are in good condition, 
and now (August 16, 1888) devour birds in addition to rabluts. They live in a large 
terrarium provided with a spacious water reservoir, cement fioor, and a permanent 
hot-water heating apparatus which renders it possible to maintain the temperature 
of the air in the interior at 20= to 22-^ R (=77° to 81.5- F). The snakes are provided 
with living food in sufficient abundance, and are equally lively in winter and summer.

This opportuuity has enabled me to make accurate observations upon the growth, 
falling off, and renewal of the rattle. I am in the fortunate position of having been 
a))le to make certain observations upon healthy specimens with good appetites, 
which decide these questions. 

In live of my snakes the long rattles fell off independently at different times, and 
I was now able especially to observe how rapidly these redevelop. I would first, 
however, remark that it is perfectly natural for the rattle of the Rattlesnake to fall 
off periodically or at irregular intervals, for the organ in question consists of dead, 
horny tissue, developed into the well-known hollow "cones," which, while partly 
inclosing one another to form the rattle, are yet only somewhat loosely connected 
together. Now, it may be readily understood that such a series of links, when it 
attains a certain length, is greatly exposed to mechanical injury, and, consequently, 
may easily break off". Without any harm to the snake itself, this chain may be also 
cut off or torn off" by force. This is, indeed, the simple reason why the rattle never 
becomes particularly long, and rattles with 15 to 18 joints are rare. As a rule, the 
rattle only lasts long enough to become 8 or 9 jointed. 

As I have already stated, I was able to follow the reproduction of the rattles in 
the case of five of the Rattlesnakes which had lost these organs. So long as their 
rattles remained short, the snakes were naturally also unable to make a noise. But 
the joints were gradually replaced, and in such a way that in all cases, in the course 
of from three to four mouths, two new ones were added to the remaining (now termi- 
nal) joint. Three-jointed rattles like these produced already a fairly loud sound. 
In the course of a year the rattles developed into chains with from 5 to 6 joints, and 
were then capable of producing the usual intense rattling sound. The reproduc- 
tion of the rattles had no connection with the recurring sloughing of the skin. It 
is well known that the epidermis is shed without the rattle, separating close to the 
margin of the latter, and, indeed, in such a way that the end of the tail in the cast 
skin is represented by an aperture with finely notched edges corresponding to the 
rows of scales. 

It consequently follows from my observations that a joint of the rattle can be 
produced in the course of every two to three months (during winter, autumn, and 
spring, of course by means of artificial warmth, the growth of the rattle evidently 
proceeding much more slowly in the natural state), and I do not understand why 
other observers have not noticed the growth of the rattle in captive Rattlesnakes. 
Probably the snakes were kept under conditions unfavorable for their welfare, 
whereby the vital processes were checked. Perhaps, too, the observations were not 
conducted with sufficient care. 

Dr. Feoktistow's strictures upon previous observers are not quite well 
founded, for Dr. Holbrook has recorded, as early as 1838, that Leknew 
two joints to have been added in one year, and that Dr. Bachman had 
observed four produced in the same period.* It has also been stated 
before that Dr. Cotton, of Tennessee, "had a Eattlesnake which shed 
its skin on an average twice a year, and he observed a new link to the 
rattle on each shedding." t 

The observations made by the Russian naturalist do not in all parti- 
culars agree with those of a somewhat later investigator, whose facilities 
were not inferior. On the contrary, Mr. J. J. Quelch, who conducted 
his experiments with snakes born in confinement in the museum in

Georgetown, Demerara, consequently in a tropical climate and the 
home of the snakes, must be said to have had even superior advantages. 
In a very interesting paper pul)lished in "Timehri,"* of which he is 
editor, he gives as his experience that the sloughing, or exuviation, of 
the general skin and that of the terminal button, or cap, of the tail 
forming the new rattle joint take place at the same time and are part 
of the same process. It is consequently possible that Feoktistow's 
results may have been caused by irregularities of the sloughing process, 
due to the captivity. Out of twenty- four specimens bred in a cage in 
the museum, Mr. Quelch brought two up on mice till they reached a 
length of more than 3 feet, when the paper was written. Here is an 
abstract of his account relating to these specimens: 

At birtli they were from 9-10 iuclies in length and. J to ^ inch thick, and like the 
other 22 of the set possessed but a terminal, elongated, horny, stump, though under 
the termination of the scales an anterior iiiece was to be observed. Now, 16 months 
after, they are more than two feet in length and more than an inch thick — one, 
which has throughout been the more voracious, being somewhat longer and thicker 
than the other — and the larger one possesses a rattle of four separable links, while 
the other has six of these, but the individual links considerably smaller than those 
of its brother. In the case of the smaller snake, with sis pieces in the rattle, these 
correspond with each exuviation, the rattle being perfect, and bearing the terminal 
elongated stump with which it was born. In the other, with four, three terminal 
links have been lost, these having been detached during its sixth exuviation. 
During 16 months, therefore, the one has had seven exuviations, and the other and 
smaller T)ut six. 

In a later note, supplementary to the above (oi). cit., pp. 170-171), Mr. 
Quelch adds the following: 

Since writing the foregoing paper it has been possible, from actual observation of 
these young forms, to trace the development of the rings still further. On Feliruary 
5th the larger of the two young specimens was about 2^ feet in length and possessed 
four rattle rings. Since then two exuviations have taken place, one on Wednesday, 
March 2.5th, when an extra ring was added to the rattle, thus making tive; and 
again, about two months after, on May 27th, when the sixth ring was added. In 
the case of the smaller snake, which on February 5th was about li feet in length, 
two exuviations have also taken place, at intervals also of about two months between 
each exuviation. On February 28th an extra ring was added by change of skiu; 
and again on May 4th, when 8 rattles were registered in total number. It is note- 
worthy that in the larger specimen of these two young ones there are only six 
rings, three having been lost in early changes, while in the smaller specimen there are 
eight, the total number from birth being retained, as shown by the presence of the 
original terminal button with which they were born. The larger specimen is now 
(June 11th) about 3J feet in length, while the smaller is about 2f feet. During early 
life these vipers are thus, with free diet, observed to exuviate and thus add to the 
rings of the rattles every two months-. 

Dr. Feoktistow, where he speaks of rattle^s with from 1~) to 18 joints 
as being rare, adds in a footnote that " rattles of 42 joints, as figured 
by Seba, surely exist only in the imagination." There is said, however, 
to be a later account and figure of a rattle of no less than -44 joints,

viz, in the '' Columbian Magazine or Monthly Miscellany " for November, 
1786, as follows : 

The common number of libuke seldom exceeds 14 or 15 in a rattle; but tlie cue 
given (fig. 4) is certainly a very great curiosity, even to a person who has seen a 
great number of this genus of snakes. The libuhi? are 44 in number. The snake 
from which this rattle was taken was not, as might be expected, of a size propor- 
tionate to the prodigious length of its rattle, but rather of a middling-sized snake. 
It was killed some time in the summer of this year, at Fort Allen.* 

The most plausible explanation seems to be that some practical joker 
joined several rattles, thus deceiving the unwary paragrapher.t The 
greatest number of joints recorded so far by a fully trustworthy 
authority is, I believe, 21 as seen by Holbrook (N. Am. Herpet., 1 ed., 
II, p. 85), unless we accept Miss Hopley-s somewhat vague statement, 
possibly only made on hearsay, that "a Crotalus [species not given] 
at the London Reptilium had twenty -five links at one time" (Snakes, 
p. 301), or Catesby's figure of a G. horrklus witli -1 joints. (Carolina, 
1743, II, pi. xli.) 

If the reader will again examine the representation of a perfect and 
full-grown rattle, given above (fig. 23), it will be seen that the basal 
rings are nearly equal in size, while the terminal ones rapidly diminish 
in size toward the tip. The latter were, of course, formed during the 
early years of the snake's life, when its growth was rapid, the increas- 
ing size of each succeeding joint testifying to the corresponding increase 
of thickness of the end of the tail. Later on this increase is much 
slower and the new joints do not materially differ in diameter from the 
preceding one. If, therefore, in the adult snake the rattle breaks 
near the base, the new rattle which will grow out to succeed the lost 
one will have an entirely different shape, the upper and lower outlines 
being nearly parallel and the terminal button as large as the basal 
ring, while the perfect, unbroken rattle tapers off toward a small and 
rather elongate button. This difference between the parallelogrammic 
rattle and the tapering rattle was once held to indicate specific differ- 
ences and was used as a systematic character, but Garman has effec- 
tually disposed of this notion in the paper on the rattle so often referred 
to above. 

When crawling over the ground the rattle, as shown in fig. 23, is 
carried with the greatest width vertical and somewhat raised off' the 
ground, so as to prevent it from dragging. 

It is often sounded even in this way, but the usual position assumed 
by the snake when vibrating the rattle in earnest is when coiled up and

more credence in the story of the man who told Kalm that in his younger days he 
had killed a Rattler with 30 joints than in the one quoted above. (Kalm, Svenska

possession of a " fossil rattle " of about 45 joints. The fossil, when received, proved 
to be an Orilioceras, a mollusk of the Devonian age.

ready for defense or offeDse. The rattle is then as a rule raised nearly 
vertically in the middle of the coil, though it not only can, but really 
does, rattle \yith the instrument poised outside of the body rings. When 
shown the original drawing of the Banded Eattlesnake, now reproduced 
on pi. 9, a friend of mine criticised the position as unnatural, since in 
his opinion the snake could not sound the rattle outside of the coil. 
Fortunately I had a huge live Texas Battler, CrotaJvs atrox, near by, 
and upon repairing to the cage and trying to induce the monster to 
rattle, his very first performance was g'iven in the i^osition shown in the 
criticised illustration. 

The rattling- sound is ])roduced by a vigorous shaking and vibrating 
of the end of the tail, the dead, horny cones i)roducing a noise of dif- 
ferent pitch and volume dependent upon the size and vigor of the ani- 
mal and the dryness of tlie rattle. Under ordinary circumstances the 
sound is not kept up constantly for any length of time, but that is not 
for want of ability, for it is well known that captive Rattlesnakes may 
be induced to rattle continuously for hours. 

Dr. Feoktistow, in the memoir already quoted, has given an account 
of an interesting experiment made for the purpose of ascertaining the 
number of vibrations which the rattle makes i^er minute, which deserves 
to be reproduced here : 

A large Rattlesnake was grasped by the neck, while an assistant thrust a needle 
through the middle joint of its seven-jointed rattle in such a way that it pierced 
the rattle in its greatest diameter, consequently from above downward, if we imag- 
ine the snake lying quiet with its tail outstretched upon the ground. Now, since 
the rattle (in the position in which we have supposed the snake to be) is, in making 
a noise, moved from left to right and back again, the needle was able to trace curves 
of vibration upon paper blackened with soot. As a registering apparatus I used 
Dudger-n's polygraph, with a strip of blackened paper which Avas made to slide rap- 
idly forward by means of the clockwork. The tail of the snake was, to a certain 
extent, fixed by my holding the snake with my hand in the region in front of the 
vent. After much trouble I succeeded in bringing the needle in a suitable manner 
into contact with the strip of paper, and in obtaining curves of vibration, from 
which the number of the vibrations per minute (the rajtidity of the progression of 
the strip of paper being known) could be calculated witli a fair degree of accuracy. 
In this manner it was found that the movements of the rattle are composed of gi'eat 
vibrations of the entire tail itself and of smaller vibrations of the actual rattle in 
such a way that the tail makes 75 and the rattle, on the other hand, 110 vibrations 
per minute. These are approximate average numbers, since I was able to obtain 
only faulty curves, because the rattle does not perform its vibrations precisely in one 
plane. Movements kept up for hours with rapidity like this are absolutely amazing. 
When observed with the naked eye, only a blurred image is seen of the rattle mov- 
ing at this rate. 

The Russian investigator was not the first, however, to attempt a 
determination of the vibrations of the Rattlesnake's tail. Dr. Isaac 
Ott, as early as 1882, tried an exj)eriment similar to that of Dr. Feok- 
tistow. From his statement* it may be sufficient to quote the fol- 
lowing : 



* The Vibration of the Rattlesnake's Tail. Journ. Nerv. and Mental Disease, 
New York (n. s.), vii, Jan. -Oct., 1882, pp. 514-516. 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 389 

The suake experimented with was one which had been kept about nine months, and 
was not as energetic as one recently caught, but the note of his rattle was as usual. 
His head was secured by means of a wire around the neck, and at the end of his rattle 
was attached a short piece of thin copper wire by means of sealing wax; then the 
tail was taken in hand and the point of the copper pen directed against the smoked 
revolving drum of a Marey-Secretan apparatus. A tuning fork was run over the 
drum to determine the rate of movement of the drum. By an analysis of the curve 
it was found that the rate of vibration of the tail was about 60 per second. 

Dr. Ott, it should be added, admits the possibility that the number of 
vibrations recorded are less than the actually normal number. Remem- 
bering the fact that the snake experimented upon was less than nor- 
mally energetic, the result agrees tolerably well with that obtained by 
Feoktistow seven years later. 

The question, "For what purpose does the suake rattle?" is still an 
unsolved one. Possibly it will ever remain so if we continue to look 
for one single purpose which may be considered so important in the 
animal's economy as to have brought about development of such a 
specialized instrument. Philosophers when attem])ting to explain 
the utility to the snake of acquiring the rattle have often failed, 
because it seemed evident that the rattle, so far from being useful 
to the snake, in most cases appears to be a disadvantage, which 
has led to the almost total extinction of the Rattlers in the cultivated 
and more densely inhabitated districts of the country. It must not 
be forgotten, however, that the rattle was evolved long before man 
appeared upon the stage, and that the question of its disadvanta- 
geousuess in the struggle against his supremacy could have no influence 
upon its evolution. The history of evolution is full of similar examples 
of animals having acquired an advantageous character which, when 
new enemies appeared, was turned against the owner because it could 
not be undone or raodilied to suit the new conditions, thus leading 
directly to his extermination. 

The theories of the use of the rattle are numerous, even though we 
exclude from the discussion the one that it is " a providential arrange- 
ment to prevent injury to innocent animals and man." 

An interesting discussion of this question was started by Prof. N. S. 
Shaler about twenty years ago, in a paper entitled " The Rattlesnake 
and IS^atural Selection,"* in which he receded from the position previ- 
ously held by him that "the tail appendage ot the Rattlesnake was not 
to be explained on the doctrine of natural selection, inasmuch as it could 
contribute in no way to the advantage of the animal." Having once him- 
self in the field mistaken the rattling for the sound nmde by the " locust," 
Cicada rhnosa, Say, he conceived the idea that the object of the noise 
is to decoy insect eating birds " into the range of the serpent's spring" 
by an imitation of the cicada's sound, and he consequently admitted 
that the case of the Rattlesnake did no longer seem " the bar to the 
acceptance of the theory it once did." 

* American Naturalist, vi, 1872, pp. 32-37. 



390 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

The similarity of the rattling sound to that of certain grasshoppers 
has been commented on by many writers both before and since, and is 
indeed in many cases astonishingly deceptive; but there are several 
great difficulties about this theory, chief of which are that birds seem 
to form a very small i)ortiou of the Kattlesnake's diet, and that on the 
other hand the birds do not seem to rely principally on their ear in 
hunting grasshoppers. 

Prof. F. W. Putnam (oj^. cit., pp. 693-694) took issue with Prof. Shaler, 
and suggested that the true function of the rattle is most likely to serve 
to call the sexes together. This theory received shortly after valuable 
support from an observation made by Prof. Samuel Aughey, who 
recorded* his experience while surveying in July, 1869, along the Logan 
Eiver in Wayne County, Nebraska. 

While washing a collection of uuios at the water's edge [lie writes] 1 heard the 
familiar rattle of the Massasauga ( Crota Joplwrus tergemin us [=Sistru7'iis catenatus] ). I 
quickly crept up the hank and cautiously looking over the level bottom I saw, at 
the distance of ahout 30 feet, a rattlesnake coiled up with the head erect and gazing 
in an opposite direction from my position. Every three or five minutes the snake 
would cease rattling for a minute or more and then commence again. In about half 
an hour from the time that I first -saw the snake I observed another Rattlesnake 
approach the first one. Closer and closer the second one approached, until at length 
they met and indulged in a sexual embrace. I -watched them for at least an hour and 
left them at last without disturbing them. 

He also related an instance where three Rattlesnakes made their 
appearance on the scene of a battle between hogs and another Rattle- 
snake, apparently called in by the rattling of the latter. 

The same observer also hints at another use of tlie rattle, suggesting 
that the noise may possibly frighten and thus paralyze the victim into 
submission, at the same time explaining the phenomena which by other 
observers have been attributed to a peculiar "charming" power sup- 
l)osed to be possessed by these reptiles, and of which we shall hear 
more further on. 

The theory which appears most commonly accepted nowadays is one 
which was elaborated by J. G. Henderson, in a reply t to Shaler's arti- 
cle above referred to. He advanced the idea that the sounding of the 
rattle, so far from inviting the destruction of the snake, 

is one of the most effective means of self-protection, and is as useful to it in the 
race for life as is the growl of the tiger when threatened with danger. The snake 
does not sound its rattles until it considers itself discovered, and not then unless it 
apprehends danger. It tlnows Itself in position to strike and says in unmistakable 
language, "Look out, I am ready for you I" If pushed upon, it makes its leap at its 
antagonist, and again throws itself in i)osition to renew the coutlict, and again 
sounds the note of defiance. ^ * ■ The ability of the snake to defend itself does 
not consist in its strength or size, or in its power of overcoming its adversary by a 
prolonged conflict, for most of its enemies are its superior in size and strength. Nor 
does its deadly poison act quickly enough to secure its own safety when it is

POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 391 

attacked, but, in most cases, the victim, after the deadly stroke is given, may still 
revenge itself by the destruction of the snake. But the certainty of the effect of the 
poison serves as a warning and is advantageous, not in defense after the attack is 
made, but in preventing an attack from being made. 

The poiut here made is certainly a strong one, and the theory has 
been given a fnrther application by the consideration, especially advo- 
cated by Garman^* that inasninch as the snccess of the snake in cap- 
ture of food depends on an ever-ready supply of poison, the rattling- 
sound is advantageous if it keeps away disturbers which can not serve 
as food and tlius prevents useless expenditure of venom or even the 
breaking of the fangs. 

If we now look at the various explanations given, it seems possible 
to accept them all as partly true. The rattle having once been 
acquired it seems even probable that the snake used the sound for the 
various purposes indicated, though of course it may be difficult to 
point out which one has mostly influenced the evolution of the instru- 
ment. To me the rattling appears as a substitute for a voice, and I 
think it is quite logical to conclude that it may be put advantageously 
to all the uses to which an animal may apply its voice. 

It has long been known that most snakes when agitated produce a 
whirring or rustling sound, which often strongly resembles the noise 
of the Eattlesnake,by rajndly vibrating the end of the tail among dead 
leaves, or against some other object, even their own body. Many an 
innocent snake has, on tliis account, suffered an untimely death, having 
been mistaken for the deadly rattler. This fact has been used as an 
argument in favor of the preventive theory, since, if the rattling is 
advantageous to the rattlesnake in preventing attack by its enemies, 
the imitation of the noise must also prove advantageous to the mim- 
ickers. The fact that this pseudo-rattling is indulged in by the deadly 
snakes without a rattle does not mitigate against this theory of imita- 
tion, for of course, if it is advantageous to the rattlesnake to have a 
means of preventing unneccessary waste of poison or useless exposure 
to breakage of the fangs, the imitation must be equally advantageous 
to the Copperhead or the Moccasin. But the futility of the theorj^ is 
shown not only in the fLictthat this vibration of the tail is so universal, 
but still more so because it does not seem to be confined to the snakes 
of America, to which part of the world the Rattlesnakes are restricted. 

It is evident, then, that this vibrating of the tail, so tar from being an 
imitation of the rattlesnake's way of making itself heard, was a common 
characteristic of most snakes before' the Rattlesnake evolved from the 
common ancestral stock of Pit Vipers. Whatever the cause of this 
phenomenon — and we may well accept Herbert Spencer's suggestion, 
as applied by Shaler (oj?. cit., p. 3G), that the wagging of the dog's tail 
and similar movements of that appendage is an escape of nervous force 
restrained from other modes of expression at the moment — we may take

392 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

it for granted that the forms from which the Eattlesnake evolved were 
in the habit of vibrating- the tip of the tail at a high rate of speed. 
This condition clearly understood, there is no diflficulty in tracing the 
origin of the rattle. 

In this connection I may again call attention to Garman's often 
quoted article,* and to reproduce his figure of the tail and of a speci- 
men of the Copperhead, Aglistrodon contortrix (fig\ 32). It does not 
need long explanation to show how easily a tail cap like the one repre- 
sented might be modified into the button, the ring-like swellings of 
which would prevent the slough from being- pushed oft". The develop- 
ment once started, the increasing irritation would lead to heightened 
nutrition and excessive accumulation of tissue. In tracing mentally 
this evolution it must not be forgotten, as Garinan on a later occasion 
(Science, xx, 1892, p. 17) remarks, that the present 
development of the rattle '' embraces much that is a 
consequence of its possession, much that has been 
Fig 32. induced by its presence and use." 

TAIL END OF THE COP- Garmau expressly protests against the assumption

rattlesnake genera have had a double origin, *S7.9fr/frM.s 

having been derived from a stock more nearly related to Agldstrodon; 

the Crotah proper, with small head scales, from forms nearer to Lachesis. 

I can not agree to this proposition, which lays more stress on the 
number and size of the head shields than upon the rattle and the other 
characteristics of these snakes. The rattle is a highly specialized 
instrument, essentially alike both in Crotalus and in Sistrurus, while 
the nine large head shields, in the possession of which the latter genus 
agree with Agkistrodon, is the common, generalized arrangement which 
they share with nearly all the nonvenomous snakes, and which was 
undoubtedly a characteristic of the ancestor from which they all^ 
including Lachesis and Crotalus — have been derived. There are, indeed, 
numerous examples among various species of Crotalus of individuals 
showing a tendency to a reversion to this ancestral arrangement. 

The popular belief in the power of the poisonous snake to "charm" its 
victims into a state of helplessness is by no means exterminated. In 
spite of all that has been argued and explained against it there are 
people still wiio profess to have ocular proof of this power. Time and 
again it has been related by trustworthy observers how birds or small 
mammals have been seen to approach the coiled snake, drawn toward 
it £i^ by a magic spell they were unable to withstand ; how, under the 
mCuence of an excitement which made them forgetful to everything 
around them-, apparently dreading- the terrible fate awaiting them yet 
unable to avoid it, they finally ventured too near, only to be hit by the 
lightning stroke of the hitherto almost motionless snake, whose only

POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 393 

sign of life consisted in the following of tlie victim's mad efforts 
with the staring eyes and the incessant darting out and in of the 
rapid tongue. Many of these blood-curdling tales are unfortunately 
embellished with such absurd details, evidently the children of an 
inflamed imagination, as to throw discredit on the whole story. It is 
not uncommon to hear it stated that the eyes of the snake were emit- 
ting fire, and that the unfortunate victim finally darted directly into 
the widely exijanded mouth of the expectant reptile. 

In spite of these extravaganzas, however, there is evidently enough 
truth in the numberless observations of this nature to keep the scien- 
tists (whose duty it is to doubt and dissect all these things) busy try- 
ing to evolve a theory by which to explain so much of the stories as 
appeared worthy of being admitted as facts. Old as the stories are, the 
explanations and theories of the doubters are not of y^esterday either. 
One hundred ami forty years ago Peter Kalm, a Swedish naturalist, 
and pupil of Linnaeus, wrote a detailed and, considering the time, accur- 
ate and interesting account* of the Rattlesnake, based upon his experi- 
ence during his travels in Eastern North America, in which he gives 
an elaborate description of how the fascination is said to take place. 
He then continues as follows: 

This is the story as commonly told by the inhabitants of North America, both by 
the common people and by the better classes, by the ignorant as well as by the 
learned. I myself have never seen it, and have even now great difficulty in believ- 
ing it. Among the many hundreds who have* told me of it not more than ten or 
twelve asserted that they had seen it with their own eyes. However, among these 
there were some men so trustworthy, and their accounts agreed in most particulars 
so well, that I almost gave w]} all doubt as to the truth. 

I have attempted to explain this alleged charm in this way : I have seen in America 
how numerous birds in the woods were running on the ground in search of food and 
so tame that a man could approach very close; they might in the same manner get 
too near to the snake, which is lying quiet and thus might easily have a chance to 
strike them; the bird is unable to get away farther than the nearest tree, where it 
is obliged to rest and tinally falls down, the snake now seizing its prey. This exjila- 
nation was particularly suggested to me by the story told me by a woman in America, 
who had once seen a rabbit running across tiie road, then suddenly stop and fall 
down as if crazy. She then saw a Rattlesnake which had followed the rabbit, but 
she did not take time to observe what followed. We often see that when a cat is 
out hunting, the little birds collect about him from some distance, uttering a certain 
cry. If the bird has its nest in the neighborhood, the greater noise it will make and 
the nearer it will approach. The cat walks quietly along, as if it does not concern 
him at all ; the bird becomes the more daring ; it a^jproaches nearer and nearer till 
it comes within reach of the cat, or even darts down upon his back; that is the 
opportunity of the cat to grab it. Some small birds in America, not at all afraid or 
having their nest near the roadside, often act in the same manner at the approach of 
man, often flying almost direct in the faces of the passers-by. As the sparrows pursue 
the hawk, thus small birds make outcries at their enemies and become more daring 
the quieter the latter are; the same, possibly, takes place with the fascination of the 
rattlesnake. Or may it be that they approach too close out of curiosity, since his 
eyes glitter and burn like fire when angry or when said to be fascinating? Or is it

394 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

possible that the charm is due to some fetid uud poisonous odor wliich he emits aud 
by which the auimals are overcome and made unconscious? Or may not every one 
of these suggestions contribute toward the result? 

The speculations of a centiuy and a half have added scarcely any new 
suggestion of apparent plausibility to those of Dr. Kalm, except, per- 
haps, the idea that the whirring noise of the rattle might producetsuch 
a terror in the intended victims as to completely paralyze their will 
power. 

On the other hand, there has accumulated a mass of negative evi- 
dence in the shape of observations on snakes in captivity, which have 
led some authorities to deny entirely the actuality of the phenomenon. 
Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, who has had unexcelled opportunities of obser- 
vation, has this to say* upon the subject: 

I have very ofteif put aiumals, such as birds, pigeons, guiuea pigs, mice, and dogs, 
into the cage with a Rattlesnake. They commonly exhibited no terror after their 
recovery from alarm at being handled and drojiped into a box. The smaller birds 
were usually some time in.becoming composed, and fluttered aboiit in the large cage 
until they were fatigued, when they soon became amusingly familiar with the snakes, 
aud were seldom molested, even when caged with six or eight large Crotali. The 
mice, which were similarly situated, lived on terms of easy intimacy with the snakesi 
sitting on their heads, moving round on their gliding coils, undisturbed and uncon- 
scious of danger. Larger animals were not so sate, especially if they moved 
abruptly aud rapidly about the snakes. The birds, mice, and larger auimals often 
manifested an evident curiosity, which promj)ted them to approach the snake cau- 
tiously. Sometimes this was rewarded by a blow, as was sure to be the case when 
a dog indulged his inquisitiveuess by smelling the snake with his muzzle. Some- 
times the snake retreated, and struck only when driven to bay. Usually, the smaller 
anijuals indulged their inquisitive instinct unhurt, and were allowed to live for 
days in the same cage with the dreaded reptile. t 

These are the sole facts which I have seen bearing any relation to the supposed 
fascinating faculty. They appear to me to lend no strength to the idea of its exist- 
ence. 

Similar evidence is given by numerous other observers, some 
expressly adding that even the most threatening rattling did not seem 
to have any terrorizing effect upon the captive animals. 

It should not be forgotten, however, that llattlesnakes in captivity, 
as a rule, are very timid, dull, and with but very little desire to eat. 
Their victims, moreover, if wanted, are within easy reach, consequently 
there would be no necessity for exerting any faculty ot fascination, 
even if the snake possessed it. 

Dr. Alfred Brehm's experience, on the other hand, is more positive 
and seems di rectly to corroborate Kalm's first suggestion. According to 
Prof. F. L. Oswald's version, Brehm procured ;i coupleof able-bodied Eat. 
tlesnakes and turned them loose in a well-lighted garret, where he could 
observe all their movements without betraying his presence. At first 

* Researches on the Venom of the Rattlesnake, 1861, p. 5, 

t It is proper to add that the curiosity thus exhibited by animals, and especially 
by mice aud dogs, was as active when the snake was not regarding the intruder as 
at other times. 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 395 

his prisoners stayed in tlieir lair in the recess of an open box, but on the 
morning- of the third day they began to show symptoms of appetite, 
and the professor treated them to a breakfast of live blackbirds. About 
live minutes after the appearance of the newcomers, one of the snakes 
left her headquarters and crawled across to the corner next to the 
front window, while her mate took post behind a waterpot near the 
center of the room. The birds were too busy to notice them at all. 
The temptation to attempt escape in a lightward direction seemed to 
occupy them too much to mind such inferior incidents as the maneuvers 
of a crawling object on the floor. The front window with its large 
panes seemed to prove specially attractive, and the ambushed snake 
had just contracted her coils for the third time when the descent of a 
fluttering bird gave her a chance to bring matters to a crisis. 

'"Ko need of charming in this case," thought the professor when the 
stricken blackbird recoiled with a frightened squawk. But there was 
still need, of patience. For nearly a minute the doomed bird fluttered 
about in an aimless way before the chemicals began to operate in earnest 
and he fell over on his side with half-opened wings. He was too far 
gone even to keep on his legs, and only then the snake crawled up to 
take possession of her prey, tliough she had all along watched her 
victim with glittering eyes, 

Brehm repeated his experiment with s^jarrows, gophers, common rats, 
weasels, quails, woodpeckers, and meadow larks, and always with an 
analogous result, except in tlie case of a woodpecker that made its way 
to the top of the window and died out of reach of the serpent. In everj- 
other case the victim at first made its escape, but was captured in 
articuJo mortis, after betraying its waning strength by all sorts of curi- 
ous symptoms. Even the weasel gave up its attempt at retaliation 
after a short struggle, and in its last moments staggered out of its 
hiding-place and finally directly toward the approaching enemy. 

I think I have seen it suggested somewhere, though I am now unable 
to find the reference, that the alleged faculty of fascination might be of 
a hypnotic nature. This suggestion may not be so entirely absurd as 
at first appears, if ^\e remember the highly nervous and excitable 
nature of the birds and the ease with which some of them, at least, are 
brought under influences similar to those of hypnotism. In this con- 
nection I may call attention to a very curious device used in some parts 
of Germany for decoying larks, the so called '"lark mivror^'' (Lerchen- 
spiegcJ). As described and figured by Naumann* it consists of an oval 
piece of wood studded with small pieces of broken looking-glass, some 
not larger than a pea, which is made to revolve upon a low stick put 
into the ground. The glittering of the revolving glass pieces reflecting 
the sun seems to attract the larks, which dart down upon it and are 
then caught in the nets. The flickermg light seems to "fascinate" the 
bird.

396 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

After all, is not the objection which some authors make to the power 
of ''charming" or "fascinating"' more directed against the use of these 
words themselves than against the phenomenon which they are intended 
to describe? 

The possibility, already expressed by Kalm, that the victims might be 
overcome by a special fetid smell, said to be emitted by the snake, does 
not'seem to have any foundation in fact, much less the more fanciful 
suggestion by more "i)opular" writers that the cause is a poisonous 
quality of the snake's breath. It is true that there are situated some 
glands about the vent which eject a fluid of a penetrating odor, if the 
snakes are handled roughly, but it is a common observation that the 
crotalids under ordinary circumstances issue no peculiar odor. Dr. 
Mitchell states that the lluid referred to is of a yellow or dark brown 
color; that it may be ejected to a distance of 2 or 3 feet, and that it is 
irritant when it enters the eye, although not otherwise injurious. lam 
not aware that these glands and their secretion in the pit vipers have 
been studied in detail. 

Occasionally we hear of the finding of large numbers of Rattlesnakes 
or copperheads in caves in rocks brought to light by blasting for a rail- 
road or a quarry. We are also all familiar with the periodically 
recurring story, now at least 200 years old, however, of the man who 
built his log cabin against the side of the mountain in such a manner 
that the perpendicular face of the rock formed the back wall of the 
hut, and who with his family had to spend the first night among the 
rafters because the heat from the fire had thawed out the inhabitants 
of a vast rattlesnake "den" somewhere iu the rock, the noisy serpents 
coming out by the hundreds and taking possession of the lioor and 
the beds. We have also heard the more modern and improved edition 
of this story, apparently due to the vivid imagination of western 
journalists a^-cordnig to which the Kansas farmer erected the same log 
cabin in the same position — not for himself, however, but for his son, who 
intended to spend his honeymoon in it, and who, with his young bride, 
was found the morning after the wedding, killed and partly eaten by an 
army of the loathsome reptiles. It would fill an entire volume were I to 
mention all the gruesome snake stories that are served up by an enter- 
prising press with an ever increasing amount of high seasoning to 
satisfy the cravings of a public now habitually fed on sensations. 
Stripped of all the lurid word painting, of all the epithets suggesting 
sliininess and other qualities not belonging to any snakes, and of all 
exaggerations as to numbers, stench, and noise, there lies at the bottom 
the truth that these poisonous snakes, like many others of the harmless 
kind, in winter often congregate in great numbers in some cavity iuthe 
ground or among rocks. In these retreats they spend the cold season 
in a state of. more or less deep stupor, or lethargy, until warm weather 
comes to <piicken their pulses, when they issue from their winter

quarters, spreading out over the ueighboriug region and passing tbe 
summer solitary or in pairs. In very liot and dry climates this hiberna- 
tion has an equivalent in the aestivation, by which term Dr. Cooper 
has designated a similarly lethargic state during the hottest and driest 
portion of the summer. 

Considering the small number of these snakes met with in the fields 
or in the woods during the warm seasons, the large numbers some- 
times found in these Ivattlesnake dens in winter is simply astounding. 
It seems as if all the pit vipers of the surrounding country had come 
together in one spot, and there are good reasons to suppose that so is 
actually the fact. The question naturally arises: How have all these 
snakes obtained their information about this apparent place of rendez- 
vous and how have they been able to find their way to it? It is a 
phenomenon in its nature not unlike that of the migration of birds, 
and IS apparently even more difficult of a satisfactory explanation. 
The old i^re darwinian conception of the inherent and infallible instinct 
explains neither, but how is the more scientific idea of the inherited, 
unconscious knowledge accumulated and crystallized, as it were, dur- 
ing countless generations, how is it to apply in the present case? 

As a matter of fact we know yet too little of the habits of the snakes 
and of their whole life history to give any explanation much better 
than a conjecture. I shall, therefore, not attempt any solution of the 
question here, but for the benefit of those who might want to take it 
up I shall quote an ingenious theory pioi)ounded recently by Mr. W. H. 
Hudson,* whose charming pictures of animal life in the Argentine 
Kepublic has made his name a household word among naturalists. 
After having briefly alluded to the habit of the rattlesnake to hiber- 
nate socially in dens, he proceeds as follows : 

Clearly in this case the knowledge of the hibernating den is not merely tradi- 
tional — that is, handed down from generation to generation, through the yonng each 
year following the adults, and so forming the habit of repairing at certain seasons 
to a certain place — for the young serpent soon abandons its parent to lead an inde- 
pendent life; and on the approach of cold weather the hibernating den may be a 
long distance away, 10 or 20, or even 30 miles from the spot in which it was born. 
The annual return to the hibernating den is then a fixed unalterable instinct, like 
the autumnal migration of some birds to a warmer latitude. It is doubtless favor- 
able to the serpents to hibernate in large numbers massed together, and the habit 
of resorting annually to the same spot once formed, we can imagine that the indi- 
viduals — perhaps a single couple in the first place — frequenting some very deep, dry, 
and well-sheltered cavern, safe from enemies, would have a great advantage over 
others of their race; that they would be stronger and increase more, and spread 
during the summer mouths farther and farther from the cavern on all sides, and 
that the farther afield they went the more would the instinct be perfected, since all 
the young serpents that did not have the instinct of returning unerringly to the 
ancestral refuge, and that, like the outsiders of their race, to put it that way, merely 
crept into the first hole they found on the apjiroach of the cold season, would be 
more liable to destruction.

398 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Of all our native snakes, the habits of none are better known than 
those of our pit vipers, yet there are many points in dispute which it will 
require time and patience and good luck to settle. Other questions 
which we have considered to be answered must be discussed over again, 
because later observations seem to cast doubt upon the conclusions 
long* since arrived at. Thus, we have believed it an undoubted fact 
that all the Pit Tipers bring forth their young alive. Gradually the 
conclusion had been gained that all of them in this respect are essen- 
tially alike, and that the progeny is comparatively limited in number. 
The constantly repeated stories of Copperheads having had innumerable 
young ones have been shown to rest on confusion with the young of the 
spreading adder. The average number of young Pit Vipers born by 
species occurring in our country seems to be 8 or 9. exceptionally as high 
as 14, while as many as 24 have been authentically recorded for some 
exotic forms. But now we read in the very latest edition of Brehm's 
"Thierleben" (Vol. vii, 1892, p. 444) that credence is given to the account 
of Geyer that he has observed a nest of about 40 Rattlesnake eggs in 
the very act of hatching! Now it is quite true that there are reptiles 
in which the time of the hatching and that of the expulsion of the eggs 
are so close that sometimes the young ones are hatched within the body 
of the mother, and thus born alive, but with these snakes the case is 
somewhat different, for the egg covering is so thin that it is most 
improbable that the eggs are ever expelled before the young have 
broken through. 

In close connection with the above we are confronted by a not unfa- 
miliar question : " Do the snakes swallow their young for the sake of pro- 
tection!" Concerning, as it does, the snakes in general and not the 
pit vipers in special, except in so far as they are reported to be among 
the ones observed to do this very thing, I should have left this theme 
at the present occasion with a reference to Dr. G. Brown Goode's admi- 
rable summary of all the evidence up to 1873, * as it would carry us too 
far to present all that has been written about the subject since then in 
this connection, but from the many unpublished letters in my possession 
bearing upon the question, and which I have reserved for a later sep- 
arate publication, I wish to print the following extracts from one 
by the late ]^r. William C. Avery, ot Greensboro, Ala., because they 
pointedly expose the inconsistency of some of those who deny the actu- 
ality of an occurrence testified to by numerous and competent witnesses, 
simply because it seems improbable and because they have not seen it 
themselves. Apropos of an account in a previous letter of how he 
himself once saw a young water moccasin run down its mother's throat, 
Dr. Avery wrote as follows: 

My reason for mentioaiug in my last letter the fact that I had seen a snake take 
her young into her throat was that it had been denied hy some writers. In a work 



* On the question "Do Snakes Swallow their Young?" Proc. Amer. Assoc. 
Advanc. Science, Portland Meeting, 1873 (pp. 176-185). 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 399 

by Charles C. Abbott, M. D., entitled "Model Book of Natural History," the writer 
says, on page 499: "The threadbare subject of snakes swallowing their young has 
been discussed again and again. The sum and substance of the matter is — they 
don't." * * * The fact of the matter is — Ihey do; and men believe they do, because 
they have seen the young in the act. Dr. Abbott denies this truth, and yet on page 
72 of his "Model Book," he Avrites: "Honey badgers are said to sit on their 
haunches and shade their eyes with one paw while on the lookout for a bee tree. 
This may seem a fishy story, but there is no reason for not accepting it. The world 
is more full of marvels than mankind have imagined." 

Surely, tlie alleged performance of the snakes is not any more mar- 
velous than that of the liouey badger! 

It was noted under tlie Harlequins, or Bead Snakes, that those poison- 
ous snakes are closely imitated by certain kinds of harmless ones, so 
close, in fact, that it is sometimes necessary to discriminate very nicely 
in order to distinguish them. Some of the crotalids are subjects 
of a similar mimicry which has given rise to a similar confusion of 
names. Thus the ordinary and very harndess hog* nose snake, or 
spreading adder, is in many districts known as the copperhead, on 
account of its superficial resemblance to the latter and the dread 
inspired by its certainly formidable looking antics is still heightened

UNDER SIDE OF TAIL OF WATER MOCCASIX. 



by the terror which tradition attaches to the name. The case of the 
water moccasin is similar. The name Moccasin has nearly lost its sig- 
niticance and needs a qualifying adjective in order to convey with cer- 
tainty the meaning of the employer whether he intends the poisonous 
or the harmless kind. Dr. G. Brown Goode has called attention* to the 
close imitation of Af/l-istrodon piscivorus (the Moccasin) by the Banded 
Water-snake, JSfafrixfasciatus, and asks justly, "Is not this a fair case 
of protective mimicry?" 

There should never be any difficulty in distinguishing these imitators 
from the poisonous species they mimic, with the specimens in hand, for 
the absence or the presence of the " pit " would at once settle the 
question. Very often the slayer ot the serpent deems it a religious duty 
to immediately put his heel to its head and crush it out of all recogni- 
tion. In such cases the tail may serve as a distinguishing character, 
for in the hog-nose snake, Heterofton, and in the water snake, Natrix^ 
the large scales covering its under side are divided on the middle line, 
while in the venomous Copperhead and Water Moccasin the greater 
majority of these subcaudals are undivided. The accompanying fig- 
ures (figs. 33, 34) show this distinction, and the heads of the harmless

familiar with the various kinds of snakes, their appearance and their 
habits, there may be no special difficulty in quickly recognizing them, if 
he gets a good view of them, but it would be useless to attempt by

It does not appear tliat any competent lierpetologist has ever exam- 
ined a specimen of the so-called " Highland Moccasin," described by 
Troost as Acontias atrofnscns, and said to occnr in the monntain regions 
from Virginia southward, and its status is therefore so doubtful tbat I 
have not ventured to treat it as a separate form. Even Holbrook, who 
gave a tigure and a lengthy description, did not see a specimen, and 
furnished it only on Troost's authority. On the whole, this variety 
appears to be only a partial melanism, as we fre(iuently tind it among 
snakes in similar localities. 

DescriiMon* — Loral present. Labials not entering into the orbit. 
Dorsal rows of scales, 23. Color, light chestnut, with inverted y- 
shaped darker blotches on the sides. Labials yellowish white (figs. 
41 aud 42). 

More slender than Toxicophis [Agl-istrodou] piscivorus. I'lates on 
neck and side smaller. Two anterior orbitals, one above the other, the 
lower narrower aud forming the posterior wall of pit. A distinct loral

between these and tbe posterior nasal. Labial uot forming part of tlie 
orbit, but separated by the four post and suborbitals. Labials not so 
largely developed; 8 above, third and fourth largest; below. 

Above light hazel brown, rather brighter on the top of the head, and 
everywhere minutely mottled with very fine, dark points. On each side 
is a series of 15 to 20 darker chestnut-colored blotches resting on the 
abdominal scutelhe [ventrals, or gastroteges], and suddenly contracting 
about the middle of the side, so as somewhat to resemble an inverted Y- 
These blotches extend to the vertebral line, where they may be trun- 
cated or end in a rounded apex. Generally, those of opposite sides 
alternate with each other, but frequently they are continent above, form- 
ing continuous bands. They are so disposed that the intervals between 
the successive blotches are pretty much of the same shape and size, 
though inverted. The centers of the blotches are lighter; in some cases

so much so as greatly to increase the y-s^iaped resemblance. Color 
beneath dull yellowish, with a series of distinct large, dark blotches, So 
to 45 in number, on each side. Chin and throat unspotted. Sides of 
head cream color; the line of demarcation very distinct; this passes 
along the upper edge of head, in front of the eye, and involving the 
lower three-fourths of the orbit, intersects the middle of the second 
postorbital plate (counting from above), and extends along the first 
row above the labials to the posterior edge of the last labiaL The line 
then comes back through the middle of the lower labial range, where it 
is marked by a narrow black line. Eostral of the same color. A small 
areolated dark spot near the inner edge of each occipital [parietal] plate.

404 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Variation. — There is considerable individual variation in the size of 
the parietal plates, and the number of sui)ralabials varies bet\Yeen 7 
and 8, as shown by Prof. Cope. The regular number of scale rows 
across the middle of the body is 23, but occasionally a specimen may 
be found with 25. 

We have already referred to the probably melanistic variation of 
specimens from Tennessee which have been described as A. atrofuscus. 
The number of dark cross-bands is also very variable, as shown in the 
description given above. Mr. Ragsdale has, in letters to me, alluded 
to the fact that the specimens taken by him in Texas had the tip of 
the tail greenish, while in eastern specimens it is stated to be blackish. 
The material at hand, faded through long immersion in alcohol, throws 
but little light upon the question, but in freshly killed specimens from 
the neighborhood of Washington, 1 find that in the adult specimens 
the tip of the tail above is of the same dark brownish color as the 
dorsal blotches; in the young specimens, liowever, it is bright greenish 
yellow, and it seems quite probable that in half-grown si^ecimens it 
may be of an intermediate olivaceous color. 

Geographical distrihution. — In a general way the range of the Copper- 
head is coextensive with that of the Banded Kattlesnake, Grotalus 
horridus, though as a rule it does not extend quite as far North. As 
a compensation it goes considerably further South in the western por- 
tion of its range, extending into the southern part of Texas. 

In the Kortheast it does not seem to reach further North than central 
Massachusetts, though DeKay states that Ilolbrook had received spec- 
imens from Vermont. Dr. J. A. Allen (Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., 
XII, 18G8, p. 11) speaks of its occurrence in Massachusetts as follows: 

There is a well-known den of this specieis on Mount Tom, near which a consider- 
able number of specimens are annually killed by different individuals. I have not 
heard of it elsewhere in the State [Massachusetts], thongh Linsley has reported it 
from Connecticut. 

It is repeatedly asserted that the Copperhead does not occur in 
Florida; but while it does not appear to be found in the peninsula 
proper, it has been taken at its very base, as testitied by specimens 
from Gainesville sent to the National Museum by Judge J. Bell. 

In Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nebraska it is lacking, and apparently 
also in Iowa, as I find no reliable record of its capture in that State. 

In Indiana, writes Dr. Hay, this venomous serpent, once abundant 
in most localities of the southern half of the State, is now happily 
becoming rare; in most localities it is probably entirely exterminated. 
Where, however, the country is not thickly settled, and where there 
are abundant forests and rocks, it may even yet be found in consider- 
able numbers. In the northern portion of the State it has probably 
always been scarce, but still present. The record for Illinois as given 
by H. Garman is similar: ''Throughout the State; rare north, frequent 
south." 

West of the Mississippi it has been recorded from Missouri and 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA 405 

Kausas, Indian Territory, Loiiisiaua, all the way down to the pine 
"woods north of Lake Pontcbartrain, where Dr. G. Kohn informs me 
that it is scarce, however. In Texas it seems well represented east of 
the one hundredth meridian and north of the twenty-ninth parallel. 

Habits. — It is agreed by almost all observers that the Copperhead, or 
Upland Moccasin, Chunk-head. Deaf Adder, or Pilot Snake, as it is 
called in various localities, is a much more vicious animal than the 
Eattlesnake; not only because it strikes without giving the warning of 
the rattle, though it is sometimes known to attempt this by quickly 
vibrating the tail against some hard and dry objects, but also because it 
is of a much more aggressive nature. However, although considerably 
quicker of motion than the Rattler, it is a comparatively slow snake, 
and as Dr. Weir Mitchell has shown that its poison in proportion to the 
quantity is less virulent than that of the Rattlesnake, its bite is less 
dangerous, and as it but seldom exceeds 3 feet in length,* it is a much 
less terrible animal than generally supposed. 

Dr. H. C. Yarrow has reported quite an interesting series of cases of 
poisoning from bites of copperheads (Am. Journ. Med. Sc. (n. s.), 
Lxxxvii, 1884, pp. 422-435). Of the umuy cases recorded in the medi- 
cal journals he had only found one fatal case, viz, that of a 6-year-old 
boy, although some of them were very severe, particularly the one which 
came under his own observation, a case the more remarkable as the 
snake was very small, "not over 14 inches long." It is plain from the 
symptoms, however, that the case owed but very little of its severity 
to the venom injected by the snake, and it is an excellent example of 
how complicated such cases may be, and how difficult it is in cases both 
of recovery and death to say how much is due to the activity of the 
venom and how nuich to other circumstances. 

Dr. R. E. Kuuze (Am. I^atural., xvii, 1883, pp. 1229-1238) thinks 
that the Copperhead does not strike from a regular coil, like the Rattle- 
snake, but tbat its effective blow is delivered when the middle of the 
body is thrown into long, almost rectangular curves, and the head held 
only slightly elevated above the ground. 

S, Garman, as quoted by Dr. Hay, having studied the Copperhead in 
captivity, states that they usually eat the prey as soon as it is dead and 
even before it ceases to struggle. Sometimes lively mice would elude 
two or three strokes, and this would seem to throw the snake into an 
ecstacy of excitement. They would not eat fishes. 

The Copperhead produces living young like the other crotalids, the 
average number apparently varying between seven and nine. State- 
ments often seen in newspapers referring to female copperheads Avith 
an enormous number of young ones having been killed are due to a con- 
fusion of this species with other snakes. 

* A large male killed this year near Washington, D. C, and presented by Dr. J. 
W. Blackburn to the Museum, measured, when fresh, 38 inches (about 965 mm.), 
while a female killed near the same place last year was only about 1 inch shorter.

Description.* — No loral. Inferior wall of orbit constituted by third 
labial: 25 dorsal, rows. Dark chestnut brown, with indistinct vertical 
dark bars. Line from superciliary along the edge of the head, through 
the middle of the second supralabial row. A second line from the 
lowest point of the orbit parallel to the first (figs. 43 and 44). 

Scales all large and well developed; those on the sides and back of 
head consiiicuously so. Two nasal plates, with the nostril between 
them. Anterior orbitals 2, one above the other, the 
upper extending from the eye to the posterior nasal, 
the lower linear and forming the npper wall of the 
pit. Lower and posterior wall of pit constituted by 
a narrow plate resting along the third labial and ter- 
minating on the second. Third labial very large, 
constituting the inferior wall of the orbit, of which '^ 
scales form the posterior. Upper labials 8, very large 
and broad; lower 10. Occipitals [parietalsj terminated 
each by a triangular plate. All the scales on the 
back of the head carinated. Dorsal scales all cari- 
nated. 

General color, dark chestnut-brown with darker 
markings. Head above, purplish black. An obsolete 
chestnut-brown streak passes from the posterior end of the superciliary 
along the upper edge of the head, through the middle of the second row 
01 supralabial scales. A narrow yellowisli white line passes from the 
third labial, or begins just below the lowest part of the orbit, and pass- 
ing backward parallel with the first stripe crosses the angle of the mouth 
at the seventh labial and meets the first stripe on the side of the neck, 
where it is confluent with yellowish white of the throat. On the lower 
labial are 3 short, nearly vertical, light bars; on fourth, sixth, and 
seventh, the rest of the jaw itself, as well as the interval between the 
stripes on the sides of the head, dark purplish brown, of which color is 
also the space in front and below the eyes. General color above, dull 

dark chestnut-brown. On each side a series 
of 20 or 30 narrow, vertical, purplish black 
bars 1 or 2 scales wide. Of these, sometimes 
2 contiguous to each other on the sameisideare 
united above into an arch, inclosing a space, 
the center of which is rather duskier than the 
ground color ; at others, corresponding bars 
from the opposite sides unite and form half rings, encircling the body. 
Sometimes there is a lighter shade bordering the dark bars. Beneath, 
black, blotched with yellowish white. 

Number of veutrals [gastrosteges], 130 to 145; of subcaudals [uro- 
stegesj, 39 to 45, of which divided, to 21.

408 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893, 

Variation.— The supposed species, or subspecies, .1. pufina.r^ was 
based ui)on an alleged different arrangement of the anterior supra- 
labials in specimens from Texas, the second being crowded up from the 
commissure by the iirst and third. Later investigations of much addi- 
tional material have shown that the character is very variable and 
entirely too unstable to serve as a tbundation for a division. 

The number of divided urosteges is also highly variable and seems to 
have no significance. 

In the young s])ecimens the colors are much ligliter and the pattern 
better defined than in the adults. 

Geographical (listrilnition.— In the main, the Water Moccasin, or the 
Cotton-Mouth, as it is also often called from the whiteness of its mouth, 
has the same range in the United States as the harleciuin snake, Ula2)s 
fulri>(.s, extending as it does from North Carolina along the coast to 
the Mexican boundary, including the entire peninsula of Florida, It 
is also found a considerable distance up the Mississippi Kiver and some 
of its southern tributaries. 

In North Carolina it is found in several localities. We have speci- 
mens from Wilmington and New Berne, and Messrs. Brindey, of 
Raleigh, inform me that in the summer of 1891 one specimen over 3 
feet long was taken on Neuse Kiver, 1 mile above Milburne, some 6 
or 8 miles east of Kaleigh. According to Coues and Yarrow, it is very 
numerous in woods of Bogue banks on the mainhuul near wet and 
marshy jdaces. Holbrook locates its northern limit at Pedee River. 
In the coast regions of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Missis- 
sippi it is very numerous, as well as over the whole of Florida as tiir 
as Key West, The same may be said of Louisiana, and Dr. Gustave 
Ivohn informs me that the moccasin, or the Congo serpent, as it is 
called by the Creoles, is common even within the limits of the city of 
New Orleans, Along the Mississippi River it ascends into southern 
Missouri, Illinois, and Western Kentucky, In Illinois it occurs along 
the Wabash River at Mount Carmel, and Mv. Robert Ridgway assures 
nie that trustworthy witnesses have told him of its former occurrence 
as far as Yincennes, in Indiana. On the west side it ascends the 
Arkansas River the entire breadth of the State of Arkansas, and 
seems to reach as far up as the boundary of Oklahoma Territory at 
least. In eastern Texas it follows the rivers into the interior even as 
far up as Dallas, where Cope regards it as still abuiulant, but in the 
western, more arid portion of the State it does not seem to go fsirther 
up than about the thirtieth parallel, though on the coast it is quite 
plentiful, 

HahiU.—rnlike the other Pit Yipers inhabiting the United States, 
the AYater IMoccasin, as the name implies, is distinctively a water snake. 
Holbrook, wlio had ])lenty of opportunity to observe its habits, writes 
that it is found about dam]> swampy places, or in water— far from 
which it is never observed. In summer, numbers of these serpents are

seeu resting on the low branches of siicli trees as overhang the water, 
into which they i)lunge on the slightest alarm. Catesby, he continues, 
thinks they select these places to watch for their prey. They merely 
choose them in order to bask in the sun; for in those situations deprived 
of trees, as the ditches of rice fields, their basking places are often on 
dry banks. They are the terror of the negroes that labor about rice 
plantations, where they are more dreaded than the Rattlesnake, which 
only bites when irritated, or in self-defense, or to secure its prey; the 
water moccasin, on the contrary, attacks everything- that comes within 
his reach, erecting his head and opening his mouth for some seconds 
before he bites. 

ISTotwithstanding the fact that the poison of the Water Moccasin has 
been found proportionately less virulent than that of the liattlesnake 
and the Copperhead, the fear it inspires is well founded, for it is a much 
larger and especially much heavier snake than tfie Copperhead. I do 
not know the extreme length to which it may grow, but it probably 
exceeds 4 feet considerably, as the largest specimen in the ]S"atioual 
Museum collection measures 45a inches (1.160 m.) with a circumference 
around the thickest part of the body of uot less than 7^ inches (190 
mm.). Records of cases of Moccasin bites are rather scarce, however, 
and the fatalities are probably not numerous. A serious case was 
recently reported to the writer by Mr. E. P. Alexander, of Georgetown, 
S. C, of a woman bitten in one finger. On September 26, 1893, he 
wrote again : 

The woman recovered, but surtered much for two weeks, tlesh sloughinj^ from 
linger, so that amputation of the tiuger, or eveu of the hand, was seriously consid- 
ered by the attending physician. 

The habits of the Water Moccasin have been studied very little in 
their native haunts, but as this Crotalid seems to bear captivity better 
than any of the others, there have been made very valuable observa- 
tions in the Zoological Garden in Berlin by RudoIi)h Efteldt.* He 
obtained four specimens, which had been born in the Zoological Garden 
in London, and reared there with great success. They became exceed- 
ingly tame and gentle toward their keeper, who finally handled them 
without fear in an almost reckless manner. They would take the food, 
preferably fishes, but also other cold or warm blooded animals, or even 
raw meat, from tlie forceps in the hand of the keeper. Toward other 
snakes, including Rattlesnakes, they were very savage, and, curiouslj^ 
enough, their bite proved dangerous to other poisonous snakes, but 
uot to others of their own species. They would often fight among 
themselves, chiefly for a place in the water basin or during the pairing- 
season. 

The pairing wah observed by Effeldt repeatedly at various seasons, 
in spring, summer, and even in the autumn as late as October 10, and 
described by him in detail. A pair which he obtained in 1871 and

1872 paired on January 21, 1873, and on the following July 6 he found 
8 recently-born young in the cage. They were about 260 mm. long by 
15 mm. thicli, and, unlike the parents, of a pale flesh color, with black- 
ish brown zigzag bands. After the first molt, about two weeks after 
birth, the ground color became more reddish brown, and at the next 
one, about five weeks later, copper brown, the head being more brightly 
colored in all stages. This color lasted into the second year, when 
they gradually assumed the dark color of the parents. During the 
first two weeks they took no food, then they accepted young frogs, but 
refused fishes. At the end of two months they were 340 mm. long, 
with a proportionally large head. The parents seemed to show some 
affection for their offspring.

Between 1822 and 1826 several authors, led by Fleming, for the first 
time undertook to subdivide the old genus Croialns into two genera 
according to the scutellation of the top of the head, but they were 
very unfortunate in adopting for the ground rattlers names which had 
been used before. Considerable confusion in the nomenclature of the 
rattlesnakes was the result, as partly pointed out under the head of 
Grotalus. S. Garman was the first to fully understand the situation, 
and, in 1883, to supply a tenable name for the genus of the ground 
rattlers. He has fully demonstrated the correctness of his position.t 

The Ground Rattlesnakes form a small compact genus of only three 
species, one of which is confined to Mexico. Their distribution in the 
United States is rather curious, inasmuch that they are found in the 
eastern portion east of the Rocky Mountain region proper, although 
one form enters the Sierra Madre plateau, even occurring on the west- 
ern slope of it in Arizona. 

The two species inhabiting the United States occupy two distinct 
areas, which only overlap to a comparatively slight extent in the 
Indian Territory and adjacent region.

The ground color a bove is brown ; the blotches are deep chestnut- 
brown, blackish externally, and with a yellowish-white margin. The 
dorsal blotches are 34 in number from the head to the region opposite 
the amis, 20 of which are transversely and irregularly oblong, anteriorly 
and posteriorly emarginated — less so, however-, posteriorly; 8 are sub- 
circnlar. Five or (J exist on the tail from the anus to its tip, extending 
on the sides, the last two forming sometimes a complete ring. The next 
series on either* side is composed of small blotches, but as intensely 
colored as in the other series. They alternate with the dorsal ones. 
They have no regularity either in outline or jjosition. The second lateral 
row is composed of the largest lateral blotches. They are transversely 
oblong or oval on the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth rows of scales, 
and opposite the blotches of the dorsal series; consequently alternating 
with third series above. The first lateral series again is composed of 
blotches intermediate in size between those of the third and second 
series; they occupy the first and second rows of scales, and extend 
somewhat to the abdominal scutelhe [ventrals, or gastrosteges], and 
alternating with the adjoining series. Two undulated vitti^ extend 
fro jn. the supraorbital plates along the neck to the first dorsal blotch, 
and often confiuent with the latter. A linear vitta margined with yel-' 
lowish white extends from the posterior edge of the eye to the sides of 
the neck; the inferior yellow margin is the broadest, and passes from 
the pit close to the angle of the mouth, turning forward to the middle of 
the lower jaw, inclosing a semielliptical brown patch. Two elongated 
yellowish spots may be observed diverging from both sides of the pit to 
the lip. The cephalic plates are deep chestnut brown; a transverse 
light brown band extends across the head from one orbit to the other. 

Variation. — The ground color varies from brownish gray, through 
brown, to blackish, the latter being the so called C. kirtlandi. It 
appears that specimens living in swamps and marshy places are chieHy 
of the latter color. The alleged differences in the shape of the head 
between Ohio and Wisconsin specimens (Smith, Joe. eit.) I have been 
unable to verify. 

Geoyraphical distribution. — The area inhabited, now or formerly, by 
the Massasauga lies approximately between the seventy- seventh and 
ninety-eighth meridians and the thirty-eighth and forty-fifth parallels. 

In the State of Xew York theyhave been found in Genesee County, 
in the western portion, draining into Lake Ontario, where their occur- 
rence in the town of Byron was recorded for the first time in ISoS by 
Mr. John Gebhard. They then inhabited a white-cedar swamp con- 
taining an area of about 1,000 acres. In Ohio, whence came the 
types of Kirtland's C. messasamjus (or Holbrookes G. kirtlandi), they 
are presumed to occur in all parts. It is also common in parts of 
Michigan, though it must be remembered that this expression " com- 
mon" in all these snakes is a very indefinite term. The accessible rec- 
ord may show them to have been common in a given place at the time 



414 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

it was made, yet at the present day oue may search long and often in 
the same phice and not hnd one. Dr. Hay says that it is yet abundant 
in some localities in Indiana, but he has not been able to confirm its 
occurrence south of Indianapolis. He also states that on the prairies 
of Illinois, before the country became thickly populated, they were 
extremely abundant, and the killing of two or three dozen of them in a 
season was not an unusual thing for any farmer's boy, while now, in that 
same region, not one is seen in years. H. Garman states that it occurs 
on the prairies throughout Illinois, but I can find no reliable records 
for the southern part. The only place where Hurter has found it there 
is the ''Wet Prairie," near Edwardsville, Madison County, where they 
seem to be common, however. The massasauga also occurs in suitable 
localities in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa. Taylor quotes it as com- 
mon in eastern and middle ]S^ebraska, and the record for Kansas is 
similar. Farther in the Southwest it is replaced by 8. edwardsii. In 
the Northeast the Massasauga extends into Canada, where it occurs in 
various localities in the peninsula of Ontario. The National JNEuseum 
has a specimen from Lucknow, by Dr. (iarnier (No. 127.-)2), and Mr. 
James M. Macoun informs me that he knows of specimens from 
Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, and Pelee Point, Lake Erie. 

Habits. — The Massasauga is emphatically a species of the prairies 
and their swamps and marshes. Its life history offers as yet some 
unsolved or disputed questions, but thanks to Dr. O. P. Hay's inter- 
esting studies of this species, much light has of late been thrown upon 
it, and to those who want a more detailed biography I would recom- 
mend his article, " The Massasauga and its Habits," in the American 
Naturalist (Vol. xxi, 1887, pp. 211-218), which also contains some 
interesting observations ou two specimens which brought forth living 
young — one five, the other six — in captivity. 

Being a comparatively small species, the maximum length probably 
not exceeding 40 inches, its bite is correspondingly less dangerous 
than the larger Eattlesnakes. There seems to be great diversity of 
opinion, however, as to the extent of its poisonous j)ower, for while 
Dr. Kirtlaud asserts that the bite is scarcely more than the sting of a 
hornet, the farmers fear it very much, and Dr. Hay thinks that one 
Massasauga would probably be equivalent in virulence to a whole 
colony of hornets, which I think is more nearly correct. 

Dr. Hay also characterizes the statement that the sound of the rat- 
tle of the Massasauga is so feeble that it is scarcely audible, as cer- 
tainly incorrect, asserting from experience that it can be heard at a 
distance of several feet. Dr. Morris Gibbs, who has examined a great 
many specimens, found the largest number of rings in the rattle to be 
10. The largest number in any specimen in the National Museum is 1> 
(No. 12752). 

Dr. Taylor, writing of the Massasauga in Nebraska, states that an 
examination of the contents of the stomachs of this species shows that 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 415 

its food is almost wholly made up of mice and otber rodents, and he 
consequently considers it decidedly useful, aside from its venomous 
qualities. It seems hardly advisable, however, to suggest j)rotectiou 
for this species on this account, but I would advise that the farmers 
spare the life of every large harmless snake on their land, and there 
would be no harm in killing off ev^ery Eattler, for harmless snakes will 
destroy the mice fully as well as the poisonous ones.

The status of the present form is very doubtful. It was described by 
Baird and Girard from a single specimen collected at Indiauola, Tex., 
which now appears to be lost. The original descrij^tion does not fur- 
nish any very tangible character by which to separate it from typical 
S. catenatus with 25 scale rows, but its scutellation is compared chiefly 
with 8. miUarius, which seems to indicate that it may have had the pre- 
ocalar and posterior nasal separated, although the otherwise so char- 
acteristic color pattern of the head is that of S. eatenatns. The figure 
111 the Pacific Railroad Eeport [pi. xxiv, fig, 8], gives only the top of the 
head, but the above suggestion is strengthened by that figure, which 
certainly seems to show a separation of the shields mentioned by a loreal, 
but whether by an upper loreal, detached from the anterior i)ortion of the 
preocular, or by a large loreal jjroper, is not clear, although the former 
alternative seems most j)robable. In that case we have probably to do 
with an individual variation only, and the only ground for the separa- 
tion of the subspecies would lie the smallness of the dorsal spots. The 
25 scale rows would then distinguish it from the subspecies S. c. edivardsii. 

Iain inclined to think that the 8. catenatus reported by Garman (Bull, 
Essex. Inst., xxiv, 181>2, p. 4.) from Deming's Bridge, Matagorda County, 
Tex., not very far from the type locality of 8. eorisors, and which, like 
the latter, had 25 scale rows, belong here. They have, moreover, 48 to 
51 dorsal blotches. 

For the sake of completeness, I add the original description by C, 
Girard. 

Description. — Twenty-five rows of dorsal scales, all cariiiated except 
the two first rows on either .side. Seven series of blotches, one dorsal 
and 3 on each side, all very small. A yellowish white line passing from 
behind the nostril below and behind the eye.

416 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Eesenibles C. miUarius in its general appearance, but without the ver- 
tebral brownish red line. The ground color is olivaceous brown, the 
blotches of a deeper brown, encircled with a black tillet margined with 
a whitish yellow line. There are about 50 blotches in the dorsal series, 
emarginated anteriorly only, 30 of which are transversely elongated, 
very irregular; the 20 remaining ones nearly circular, with regular out- 
lines. The blotches of the lateral rows are comparatively small and 
of nearly etjual size, though sometimes one of either row may appear 
much the largest. The blotches of the first lateral series are opposite 
to those of the dorsal and afl'ect the first, second, and third rows of 
scales and the extremities of the abdominal scutelkB [ventrals, or gas- 
trosteges]. The blotches of the second series alternate with these, 
extending on the third, fourth, and fifth rows of scales. The blotches 
of the third series are obsolete and alternate with those of the second 
series, and are generally opposite to those of the dorsal series situated 
in the fifth, sixth, and seventh rows. The upper surface of the head is 
brown; there are li vittte extending from the vertex along the neck to 
the first dorsal blotch. A broader and deep chestnut- brown band 
extends from the eye to the neck. The frontal region is deeper brown 
than the vertex. A yellowish white line starts from the nostrils near 
the ujiper surface of the head, extending backward, in passing between 
the eye and the pit, to the angle of the mouth. A vertical whitish bar 
extends from each side of the pit to the labial. The belly is yellowish 
white, marbled with black, transversely oblong patches. The vertical 
plate [frontalj is cordiform; the anterior frontal plates [internasals] pro- 
portionally small; the occipital [parietal] rather broad. The scales of 
the body are elongated, a little smaller than in G. miliar nis, but not 
quite so acute posteriorly. The 2 lateral and smooth rows are much 
broader than the rest, and conspicuous. Most of the scales of these 2 
rows are black, with the posterior edge straw-colored, giving the appear- 
ance of a succession of distinct crescents. The tail is conical and taper- 
ing; the rattle composed of one ring besides the terminal one.

Description* — Twenty-three rows of dorsal scales; first and second 
lateral rows smooth. Vertical plate [frontal] siibpeutagonal, taperiiig- 
posteriorly. Lateral rows of blotches proportionally very small. 

The gronnd-color is yellowish brown, with three lateral series of deep 
chestnnt brown blotches. Two elongated brown blotches extend from 
the superciliaries [supraoculars] backward. A narrow band of chestnut 
brown, from the posterior frontal plates [prefrontals], passes over the 
eyes to the neck, under which a yellowish stripe extends from the nos- 
tril to the angle of the mouth. The snout and upper Jaw are brown, 
with two yellow" fillets diverging from the pit. The lower jaw and chin 
are mottled with brown and yellow. There are about 42 dorsal brown 
and irregnlar blotches, margined with deep black and encircled with a 
yellow fillet, from the head to theti]) of the tail, the thirty-fourth oppo- 
site the anus, the last three passing to the sides of the tail, but do not 
meet below. Subcircular on the posterior half of the body, the blotches 
on the anterior half are longer transversely than longitudinally, emargi- 
nated anteriorly only. 

The blotches of the two lateral series are proportionally small. 
The blotches of the upper series are more or less obsolete, and alter- 
nate with the dorsal ones. Those of the second lateral series are the 
smallest, and alternate also, being of as deep a color as the dorsal 
ones, but do not extend beyond the anus, occupying the second, third, 
and fourth rows of scales. The first and lower series affect the first 
and second rows and only one scale. The belly is of a light straw color, 
dotted and sprinkled irregularly with brown. 

Scales elliptical, subtruncated posteriorly, constituting 23 rows, 
strongly carinated, except the two lateral rows, which are smooth. 

Head, when seen from above, subelliptical; vertical i)late [frontal] 
proportionally more elongated than in C. tergeminus [ = tS. catenatus]. 

Number of ventrals[gastrosteges], 143 to 153; of caudals [urosteges], 
24 to 31 ; scale rows across middle of body, 23. 

Variation. — The chief variation in scutellation I have found in this 
subspecies consists in the occasional separation of the anterior prolon- 
gation of the preocular so as to form an upper loreal separating the 
preocular from the posterior nasal. 

In coloration there is considerable difference between the specimens, 
chiefly consisting in an obliteration of the markings on top of the head, 
thus obscuring the characteristic dark spot on the middle cf the parietal 
suture. 

Geographical distribution. — The present subspecies represents the 
typical Massasauga in the Southwest. Curiously enough it does not

POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 419 

ities. Vertical i^late [froutal] subcordiform, occipital [parietal] oblong 
and elongated. A narrow white line commences at the lowest point of 
tlie orbit and passes obliquely backward to the angle of the mouth. 
Ground color dark grayish ash, minutely mottled. A series of 38 to 45 
subcircular dorsal blotches extending from head to tail, dark brown, 
each with a narrow, distinct yellowish border. Interval rather nar- 
rower than the spots themselves. A broad band of purplish red passes 
from head to tail through the blotches. On each side may be distin- 
guished three series of blotches, the first on the first and second lateral 
rows of scales and i)artly on the abdominal seutelhe [ventrals or gas- 
trosteges] ; the second alteruating with this on the second, third, fourth, 
and fifth rows of scales, and opposite the dorsal series; the third alter- 
uating with the second and the dorsal series on the fifth, sixth, seventh, 
and eighth rows of scales. The latter series is dusky and obsolete; the 
others are uniform and distinctly black. 

The shape of the blotches is subjected to some variation, according 
to individuals. Generally subcircular or slightly oblong, they become 
sometimes a transversely elongated quadrangle, three times as long as 
wide. Their shape varies according to the region of the body ou which 
they are found. On the anterior third they are subquadrangular, 
anteriorly and posteriorly emarginated; on the middle region they elon- 
gate, and toward the posterior third become nearly circular. Backward 
of the arms the five or six blotches of that region extend on the sides, 
without, however, meeting on the lower surface. The blotches of the 
first lateral row are subquadrangular and a little snuiller than those of 
the second and third rows, the blotches of the second row being trans- 
versely oblong and largest on the middle region of the body. Side of 
the head purplish brown, a narrow, distinct white line from tl\e lowest 
part of the orbit passing obliquely backward to the angle of the mouth. 
Above and continuous with that white line a deep chestnut-brown 
vitta is observed, of the same length but broader, and lined above 
with a narrow, dull, yellowish margin. Two undulated dark brown 
vitta' extend from the vertex to the first dorsal blotch and confluent 
with it. A donble crescentic blotch is observed on the frontal scutelliB 
[internasals and prefrontals], leaving a transversal fulvous band across 
the head between the orbits. Tlie color underneath is reddish yellow, 
marmorated with brownish black blotches and minute dots. 

The scales are elongated, carinated, and acute posteriorly. Those of 
the lateral row are slightly carinated also, but narrower than in C. 
Gonsors, and more acute posteriorly. 

Number of ventrals [gastrosteges],132 to 13G; of caudals [urosteges], 
27 to 36; scale rows, 21 to 23. 

The greatest number of joints to any rattle of this species in the 
U. iS. National Museum is nine. 

Variation. — While the scutellation of this species appears rather 
constant, there is considerable variation in color, inasmuch as speci- 



420 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

mens from moist localities appear much darker, often quite blackish 
with large si)ots, while in those from more arid districts the grouud 
color is much paler, and the markings more restricted. There is also a 
certain amount of variation with regard to the red dorsal stripe, which 
seems to be wanting in tlie young. 

Geographical distribution. — Holbrook asserts that on the Atlantic 
coast this species does not occur north of the thirty-fifth iiarallel, and 
I am aware of no later record which contradicts this. In fact, the most 
northerly record I have been able to find seems to be that of Drs. 
Cones and Yarrow (Proc. Phila. Acad., 1878, \). 20) from the neighbor- 
hood of Fort Macon in North Carolina, a little south of the- latitude 
mentioned. They write that a few individuals are said to have been 
seen on Bogue banks; none, however, observed or secured by them; 
but thafthey are quite common on Shackleford banks, a few miles from 
Fort Macon, and that it has also been taken on the mainland. The 
ground rattler is found south of this point along the coasts of North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. In the latter State it 
is distributed all over the peninsula and along the Gulf coast to Ala- 
bama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. It ascends the Mississippi River 
Valley and the valleys of its southern tributaries, but curiously enough 
seems to be more common on the western side of the great river, being 
apparently common in Arkansas and Indian Territory even as far west 
as central Oklahoma, whence the National Museum has a young speci- 
men collected by Dr. Edward Palmer at Old Fort Cobb. 

In Texas Prof Cope has recorded it as occurring at Dallas; Mr. 
Eagsdale has collected it in Cooke County, and Capt. Pope brought a 
specimen (No. 4JM) home from the head waters of the Colorado Eiver, 
at about the one hundred and first meridian. On the coast .of Texas 
Mr. Garmau has recently recorded it (Bull. Essex Inst., xxiv, 181>2) 
from Matagorda County. 

Habits. — The Ground Battler appears to prefer dry ground, and Hol- 
brook states that it is found among leaves, and frequently in high grass 
in search of small field mice, on which it feeds. 

The only observation about its breeding habits of which I am aware 
is a note by Prof F. W. Putnam in the American Naturalist (Vol. ii, 
1808, p. 131) that he had once dissected a specimen having 14 eggs, all 
with embryos two inches in length in the oviduct. 

According to Holbrook the common jieople dread the ground rattler 
and consider it much more destructive than the Banded Eattlesnake, 
both on account of its greater aggressiveness, tlie scant warning its 
faint rattling aftbrds, and the supposed greater activity of its venom. 
He, however, satisfied himself by experiments of the fallacy of the 
alleged greater virulence of its poison, for while he found it sufficient 
to kill small birds, or field mice, repeated bites failed to affect a cat 
beyond causing it to droop for thirty- six hours, at the end of which 
time the effects of the poison entirely disappeared. 

While thus the bite of these small snakes maybe attended with com- 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 421 

paratively little danger, a person bitten would act very foolishly were be 
to neglect to pay proper attention to the wound and to apply as soon 
as possible proper remedies, as otherwise lie might pay dearly enough 
for his carelessness. 

Although, as a rule, not fatal to man, the Ground Kattler is not harm- 
less enough to secure it against destruction wherever it may be found. 
It is undoubtedly useful in destroying a great quantity of small rodents, 
but the protection of the other innocuous snakes will compensate for 
the killing of any number of Ground Eattlers.

There has, at various times, been some confusion in the application 
of the generic terms of this and the following genus. From 1861 to 
1875 Prof. Cope used Laurenti's Caudisona for the present group, 
restricting' Crotalns to the Ground Eattlers, following Fleming's example 
of 1822. In 1875, however, he suddenly reversed the two names, 
employing Caudisona for the Ground Eattlers. This latter has later 
been exchanged for Crotalopliorus, as will be shown under the follow- 
ing genus. 

The case is very simple. When Linnjeus, in 1758, first applied the 
binominal nomenclature he did not know or name any of the ground 
rattlers, consequently the name Crotalus can only be used as done 
here. Houttuyn's Crotalophoriis is identical with Linna^i Crotalns of 
the tenth edition of his Systema IS^aturae, being, in fact, simply an 
emendation and, therefore, nothing but a synonym. The status of 
Laurenti's Caudisona is exactly similar. 

The geographical distribution of the genus Crotalus is highly inter- 
esting. 

Jointly with the other genus, Sistrnrus, the Eattlesnakes are peculiar 
to the New World. Their center of distribution appears to be the table- 
land of Mexico with its extension northward into the southwestern 
United States, at least 8 out of a total of the 17 species constituting 
the genus Crotalus occurring at, or near, the boundary between the 
United States and the Mexican Eepublic.

Xo rattlesnake occurs in any of 
the West India Islands proper, and 
only one species appears to be con- 
fined to South America, where also 
another species occurs, the range of 
which, however, extends into south- 
ern Mexico. 

Within the United States not less 
than ten species, with several sub- 
species, are found; but their dis- 
tribution within that area is very 
uneven. Thus, while tliere are but 
Pi„_;5j few localities in which Eattlesnakes 

DORSAL COLOR PATTERN OF cROTALus MOLOfsus. ^jq ^jq^ occur, or did uot occur before 

they were exterminated by man, yet 
the area inhabited by more than one 
species of Crotabis is comparatively 
very limited. Thus in the southeast 
the range of the Diamond Rattle- 
snake, C. aclamanteus, is overlapped 
to a great extent by that of the 
Banded Rattlesnake, C. horridits, 
while in the center of the Union 
there is another limited area in- 
habited by two species, viz, the 
Banded Rattlesnake, C. horridus, 
and the Prairie Rattler, C. eon- 
fiuentus. 

As we approach the Mexican 
boundary and the northward exten- 
sion of the Sierra Madre the density 
of the distribution of the species 
increases rapidly, until in southern 
Arizona we find no less than 7 dif- 
ferent species of Rattlesnakes, viz: 
C. molossus, G. <itro.x\ C. coHjiuentHS, 
C\ tigris, G. cerastes, G. lepidus, and 
('. mitcheUii pyrrhus, out of a total of 
10 species inhabiting the entire area 
of the United States. 

North of our northern boundary 
only two species of Grotalus extend 
a short distance into the British 
possessions, in the western part G. 
lueifer and in the central portion G.

POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 425 

Description* — Muzzle broad; rostral small. Scales between super- 
ciliaries [supraoculars] small, uniform, except the two anterior. Two 
frontal plates [iuternasalsj, 4 postfrontal [prefrontals], 2 intersupercil- 
iary [interorbitals],aIl in contact. Five rows scales between the labials 
and suborbital row; middle row not extending beyond the middle of 
the orbit; labials, 18 above, fifth and sixth largest; 17 below. Dorsal 
rows of scales, 20; two external rows, small. Tail uniform black. Color 
roll sulphur; a series of chestnut-brown transverse lozenges [fig. 53] 
with exterior corners produced to the abdomen ; centers of lozenges 
with one or two spots; each scale but one color; a brown patch below 
and behind the eye. 

One of the most strongly marked of all species. Head very broad in 
front; outline nearly rectangular. Rostral small. Two anterior front- 
als [interuasals]; behind these, four plates, the exterior resting on the 
superciliary; behind these two other plates, between and in contact 
with the superciliaries [supraorbitals]. Anterior nasal subtriangular. 
Top of head with numerous smooth subtuberculous scales. Suborbitals 
large, extending to the anterior canthus. General aspect smoother than 
in crotali generally; scales rounded at the posterior apex, carinatedbut 
slightly. 

General color above, that of roll sulphur; beneath, pale yellowish; 
posteriorly, very faintly clouded with brownish. Tail black. Anteri- 
orly the scutelUe [ventrals, or gastrosteges] are entirely immaculate. 
Along the back is a series of transverse reddish or chestnut-brown 
lozenges embraced in a width of 12 or 11 scales and 4 or 5 scales long, 
and with the exterior angles produced to the abdomen [fig. 53J. 
These lozenges are frames with the outline generally one scale in 
width and with the centers of the ground color; sometimes divided by 
a median line of brown so as to show two yellowish sjwts inside of the 
lozenges. The scales exterior to the lozenges are rather lighter. 
Sometimes the brown rings and the lozenges widen at the abdomen 
and indicate lateral spots of four scales; at others, and especially ante- 
riorly, the rings are obsolete and the brown is in a dorsal series. In 
fact for the anterior fourth of the body we have a dorsal patch of brown 
showing alternately, at successive intervals, one large yellowish spot 
and then a pair of smaller ones, owing to the confluence of the suc- 
cessive lozenges. The superciliaries and scales anterior to them, as 
well as broad patch below and behind the eye, light greenish-brown. 
Tail uniform dark-brown above, paler beneath. 

A remarkable character of this species is that each individual scale 
is of the same uniform tint to its base, and not showing two colors as 
in other species. 

Variation. — The head scutellation of the present species is exceed- 
ingly variable. I have seen about nine specimens, hardly two of which

are alike in that respect. In all of them the snout is covered above 
with large shields, which sometimes extend to between the orbits, but 
their number and mutual relation is very variable, and often they are 
more or less separated by small scales. "The size and shape of the ros- 
tral also varies, and the rows of scales between eye and labials vary 
between 4 and (>. 

The coloration of this undoubtedly our most beautifully tinted crotalid 
is more stable. The chief variations consist in the greater or lesser 
degree of definition of the spots, and in the color of the tail, which in 
most specimens is solidly blaclvish though in a few it presents alter- 
nating cross bands of black and light color. 

Geographical (Ihtrihution. — In the main the range of (7. molossus, at 
least within the borders of the United States, coincides with that of C. 
Iepidi(s,hemg coniAned to the States and Territories bordering upon the 
Mexican frontier. 

It was first described from a specimen collected at Santa Rita del 
Cobre, near the present Fort Bayard, in Xew Mexico, and not far from 
that locality it has since been taken by Prof. Cope. Henshaw procured 
it in southern Arizona, probably not far from Fort Buchanan, whence 
the Museum got a specimen from Dr. Irwin, while quite recently Dr. 
Thimothy E. Wilcox has sent it from Fort Huachuca. Two specimens, 
collected by Dr. E. Coues on San Francisco Mountain, Arizona, were 
identified by Cope as the present species. C. lepidus has not been found 
so far from the Mexican boundary. The range into Mexico is unknown. 

The Texan specimen, upon which Hallowell based the G. ornatus, was 
collected by Dr. Heermann at the Pecos River, en route between El 
Paso and San Antonio, and is so far the only specimen obtained in 
Texas. 

HahltH. — Nothing is known of its habits, .except that it is found 
among rocks.

large scales: two rt>ws between this and labials. Labials 12 to 14

25, all carinated : carination on outer row obsolete. Tail black. Above 
sulphur-brown, with 2 rows of confluent browu lozenges. Light liue 
from superciliary to angle of the mouth; behind this a dark patch (figs.

Head above covered with small subtuberculous scales. Superciliaries 
(supraoculars) large. Anterior frontals (internasals) large, triangular, 
emarginated behind to receive a series of three small plates. A single

frontal (iuteruasal). The exterior plate of the posterior frontal (pre- 
frontal) row is much the largest, and is in contact with the super- 
ciliaries (supraoculars). A series of 3 or 4 large flat scales extend 
from the posterior extremity of the superciliary (supraocular). Scales 
on the cheeks (temporals) very large, truncate. Anterior orbitals 
(preoculars) double; the upper one rectangular, elongated longitudi- 
nally, separated from the (posterior) nasal by 2 small plates (loreals). 

General color above that of roll sulphur; beneath, whitish yellow. 
Along the back is a double series of subrhomboidal blotches, looking 
as if they had been in contact, and then the line of junction partially 
effaced for the 3 or 4 central rows. (See fig. 52.) The impression 
conveyed of the color of these blotches is that of coarse mottliugs of 
soot or gunpowder grains, more crowded exteriorly. There are 21 of 
these blotches from the head to the anus, the tail being entirely black. 
The rhomboids are inclosed within about 12 dorsal series of scales. 
Directly opposite to these spots on each side is a series of subtriau- 
gnlar blotches similarly constituted as to color, and extending from the 
abdomen to about the fifth lateral row, and some 6 or 7 scales long. 
Anteriorly these are distinct from the dorsal series, but posteriorly 
they are confluent with them, forming a series of zigzag blotches across 
the body. The scutelhe below show more or less of the grain-like 
mottlings. Posteriorly the yellow of the body is suffused with darker. 

There are no markings of lines distinctly visible on the sides of the 
head. In the center of the spaces between the dorsal and lateral series 
of blotches are indications of small obselete spots, and in some cases 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 429 

the yellow scales external to the blotches are of a lighter color than 
the rest. 

Number of veutrals (j;astrosteges), 106; of subcaiulals (urosteges), 25; 
dorsal scale rows, 23. 

Total length, 42 inches; tail, 5 inches. 

Variation. — There is considerable individual variation, both in 
scutelhition of the head and the ground color of the body. 

The variation in the scutellation on top of the head is especially 
marked with regard to the prefrontals and the scales covering the can- 
thus rostralis. Normally the large plates consist of 2 internasals, 2 
supraoculars, and between these, on each side, a large shield, the pre- 
frontals usually being small scales like those covering the rest of the 
head. In two of our specimens, however (Nos. 277 and 12748), there 
are a^iair of large prefrontals following the internasals, while in Nos. 
277 and 248 there are 2 scutes l^etween the iuternasal and the supra- 
ocular on each side instead of 1. 

The ground color varies greatly from light yellowish and light red- 
dish gray through brown to almost black in some instances. In old 
specimens the tail is generally uniform black, but in the young ones it 
is banded light and black. In many specimens from localities in the 
Alleghany Mountains, with a moist climate, this black of the tail and 
sometimes even of the entire posterior half of the body is often of a deep 
velvety gloss. 

In the majority of the Western specimens there is a broad, ill-detined, 
but very distinct, ochraceous baud running down the center of the 
back. Most of them also have the postocular dark band darker and 
better defined than Eastern specimens; but I have been unable, with 
my material, to draw any line sufiliciently constant. 

Geographical distribution. — In former times the Banded Eattlesnake, 
or "Timber Eattlesnake,'' as it is often called in regions where other 
species also occur, was commonly distributed in suitable localities all 
over the eastern United States, except the peninsula of Florida, as far 
west as the subarid portion of the Great Plains, but they have now 
become exterminated or nearly so, in many localities, having been 
driven back to the wilderness by the advancing cultivation of the 
country. 

Prof. Yerrill (Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., ix, 1868, p. 197), speaking 
of the reptiles of Norway, Me., states that it is rare, and only found in 
Albany and Paymond; he had never detected it east of the Androscog- 
gin Eiver. In Massachusetts, according to Allen (Proc. Boston Soc. 
Nat. Hist.. XII, 1868, p. 179), it is not unfrequent on ]Mount Tom, and 
occasionally killed on rocky hills in several of the towns near or adjoin- 
ing Springfield; it a-lso occurs at a few similar localities in the eastern 
part 01 the State. 

In 1886 Prof. A. S. Packard had an article in the American Natu- 
rahston " The Eattlesnake in New England" (Vol. xx, pp. 736-737) from 
which I quote the following: 



430 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

We have been told that Rattlesuakes arc still occasionally killed iu Conuecticut 
near the Rhode Island border. It is generally stated that the last Rattlesnake was 
killed iu Rhode Island twenty years ago, but we are informed by Prof. Battey that 
one was killed at Tiverton, R. I., within a period of four years. Its skin is now iu 
the museum of the Friends' School at Providence. Mr. Henry H. Buxton, a member 
of this school, from Peabody, Mass., gives us the following statement regarding its 
occurrence at that locality : 

'Tn South Peabody there is a rock called Rattlesnake Rock, surrounded by woods 
in which there are a great many snakes, including tho Rattlesnake. During the last 
year three or four have been killed by different persons. They coufiue themselves 
to the part of the town which is the most rocky and slightly elevated. In the winter 
they get luider this rock and go to sleep." 

Rattlesnakes are still common in the Milton Hills, near Bostou, and at Hyde Park. 

Iu coiifiriuatiuii of the occurrence of the Rattlesnake iu Conuecticut, 
my friend, JNlr. John H. Sage, sent uie two specimens iul893 from Port- 
laud. He wrote me at the same time that quite a uumber are killed iu 
this immediate vicinity (Portland) each season. As early as 1842 
Thompson (Hist. A^ermout, i, p. 119) says that iu Vermont they have 
uow uearly disappeared, but that formerly they were found in consid- 
erable numbers, thouiih mostly confined t<» a very few localities. 

In the same year De Kay speaks of the Itattlesnake in the State of 
New York (Zool, X. Y., iii, p. 57) as follows: 

The Rattlesnake is common iu various parts of the State, and in the Northern States 
generally appears to prefer rocky situations. They abound in Clinton, Essex, and 
WaiTen counties, along the shores of Lakes Champlaiu and George. Some idea 
may be formed of their numbers in certain districts iu this State bj' the following 
extract from the Clairon newspaper, published in Warren County: 

"Two men, in three days, killed 1,104 Rattlesnakes on the east side of Tongue Mouu- 
tain,in the town of Bolton. Some of the reptiles were very large, carrying from 
15 to 20 rattles. They were killed for their oil, or grease, which is said to be very 
valuable." 

Although numerous iu the rocky, mountainous districts of this State, they are rare 
or entirely wanting in those elevated regions which give rise to the Moose, the 
Raquet, and the Hudson rivers. They are found iu tlie counties of Sullivan, Ulster, 
Orange, and Greene. A few still linger iu the swamps of Suffolk County. 

This may be sui)plemented with the following statement from Prof. 
Baird's "Serpents of N^ew York," p. 10 (ISjI): 

In New York it seems to be most abundant on the shores of Lake George and Lake 
Champlaiu; especially iu Rattlesnake Mountain of the former and Rattlesnake den 
of the latter, a rocky blutf between Westport and Essex. It is a little remarkable 
that the rattlesnake does not occur in the Adiroudaik regions of New York ; at least, 
au instance has never come to my knowledge. Such a region iu Pennsylvania would 
be Infested by them. 

As indicated in the last sentence it is still fairly common in the 
Alleghany ]Mountaius, from Pennsylvania southwards, though by no 
means confined to the high altitude, as we have specimens from Wil- 
mington, in North Carolina, Liberty County and Saint Simons Isle, 
Georgia, while Dr. E. Coues quotes it as conuuon in the vicinity of 
Fort Macon, North Carolina, and certainly occurring on the islands 
as well.

POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 431 

The Banded Eattlesuake probably does uot euter the Florida peuiu- 
sula in-oper, but the Natioual Museum is indebted to Judge Bell for a 
flue specimen from Gainesville, in the interior, at the base of the penin- 
sula. It occurs also in all the other Southern States, and I have even 
seen a specimen from Houma, in the i)ine lands southwest of ISTew 
Orleans. 

In the mountains of Tennessee and Kentucky the Banded Rattlesnake 
is still fairly common, but uot so in Ohio and Indiana. Kirtland, as 
early as 1838 (in Mather's Sec. Hep. Geol. Surv. Ohio, p. 167), stated that 
in the former State it was then but rarely seen, though formerly very 
abundant, and with regard to Indiana we have Dr. O. P. Hay's recent 
assertion (Batr. Kept. Indiana, 1893, p. 129) that it is to be found, in 
all probabilit}', in nearly all the counties of Indiana, though in most 
places quite rare. He can only name two localities where it has been 
taken recently and record of it preserved, viz, New Harmony and 
Monroe County. In Michigan it appears to be rare, the onlj^ definite 
record I can lay hand on at present being that of Dr. Morris Gibbs 
(Wolverine Naturalist, February, 1890, p. 12) of a specimen killed in 
Kalamazoo County. 

H. Garman (Bull. 111. State Lab. Nat. Hist., in, 1892, p. 312) is author- 
ity for the statement that it occurs throughout Illinois in hilly, forest 
regions, though being rapidly exterminated, while Higley (Trans. Wis. 
Acad. Sc, vii, 1884, p. 161), in regard to its distribution in Wisconsin, 
has only this to say, that it was formerly very common, but is now sel- 
dom met, and that it may be found in the rocky bluflts of the larger 
rivers. 

Mr. Julius Hurter (Trans. St. Louis Acad. Sc, vi, Dec. 1893, p. 
258) has an interesting note on a local increase of this snake. Years 
ago, he says, it was rather scarce in St. Clair County, 111., as in those 
days there was no stock law, and the pigs roamed around and exter- 
minated a good many snakes, but since the stock law has gone into 
effect, comi)elling swine to be i^euned up, the snakes have become more 
numerous again. In early spring they are found near the bluffs under 
rocks, but later on they go to the wheat fields and meadows, where 
they are very safe till harvest time, when a good many are destroyed 
by the farm hands. 

West of the Mississippi they are still found in eastern Iowa, at least, 
Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, and Indian Territory. The Banded Bat- 
tlesnake even extends into Texas, as Dr. Shumard sent to the Smith- 
sonian Institution a specimen collected on the upper Brazos during 
Capt. INIarcy's exploration of that river. 

Habits. — In a general way most of what has been written about the 
habits of the rattlesnake refers to the present species. In contradis- 
tinction to the Water Rattlesnake, C. adamanteus, and the Prairie Rat- 
tlesnake, C. confluentus, the present species is often called the "Timber 
Rattler," because of its predilection for wooded districts. It does 
undoubtedly often in summer take uj) its abode in prairies and mead- 



432 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18i*3. 

0W3,- but it prefers rocky aud mountainous places, where it can find 
boles and crevices to hide itself, or sunny ledges, where it may enjoy 
the heat of the day. 

It has been repeatedly denied that the Kattlesnake climbs trees, and 
it is certain enough that it does not do so habitnally. It is but ill fitted 
for climbing, yet there are unquestionable proofs that they do so occa- 
sionally. Of course, they do not climb up tall, smooth, perpendicular 
trunks, but it is not more difficult for it to climb up a rough-barked 
slanting tree with plenty of side branches than to wriggle up the rocks 
of a mountain side. 

The food of the Banded Eattlesnake consists in all sort of smaller 
warm-blooded animals which may come its way, as rabbits, squirrels, 
rats, mice, and an occasional bird. Ilolbrook pictures this species as 
remarkably slow and sluggish, lying quietly in wait for his prey, and 
never wantonly attacking nor destroying animals, except as food, 
unless disturbed by them. A single touch, however, will effect this; 
even rattling the leaves in his neighborhood is sufficient to irritate him. 
On such occasions he immediately coils himself, shakes his rattles vio- 
lently in sign of rage, and strikes at whatever is jdaced within his 
reach. In his native woods, Holbrook continues, one may pass within 
a few feet of him unmolested. Though aware of the passenger's pres- 
ence, he either lies quiet or glides away to a more retired spot. He 
never follows the object of his rage, whether an animal that has unwa- 
rily approached so near as to touch him, or only a stick thrust at him to 
provoke his anger, but strikes on the spot, and prepares to repeat the 
blow, or he may slowly retreat like an unconquered enemy, sure of his 
strength, but not choosing further combat. 

Compared with the Diamond-backed Kattlesnake, the Banded Battler 
is the more timid and less aggressive. Speaking of these animals one 
does not quite feel like characterizing any of them as " gentle," yet this 
is an expression used by many a one who has had plenty of experience 
with them. The late Gen. Kirby iSmith once told me of an incident 
which illustrates the amount of provocation a Eattlesnake will pass 
unnoticed under certain circumstances. Gen. Smith's home in Ten- 
nessee was located on a high plateau, aud a narrow path led from the 
house to the small railway station in the valley below. One day a 
party of ladies went down the path in Indian file, the general in the 
lead, and the rear being brought up by a barefooted lad carrying a 
valise. Suddenly tlie latter shouted. A Battlesnake was lying coiled 
in the path, and he had ju.'.t discovered it in stepping over it without 
touching it. By the merest chance they had all avoided stepping upon 
it, though it seemed almost impossible that the ladies' dresses should 
not have touched it. Gen. Smith said he felt like sparing the snake's 
life. In captivity a Banded Kattlesnake may be handled with impunity 
by a self-possessed man, if he moves (piietly and deliberately, not 
frightening it by any sudden and unexpected movements. There even 
seems to be trutli in some of the stones about children having been

found placing with and carrying about live Rattlesnakes without 
having been hurt.* 

It is somewhat curious that the breeding habits of this species are 
still almost unknown. At least, very little definite informatiou is on 
record. The time of pairing is difficult to ascertain. The number of 
young born at oue birth appears to be about uine. The largest of a 
number of embryos i)reserved by Prof. S. F. Baird (U. S. Nat. Mus,, 
No. 1292) and apparently ready to be born is about 245 mm. (9^ inches) 
long, with a diameter of 12 mm. (one-half inch).

Description * — Head tiiaiiguliii-. Two auterior frontals (iuternasals), 
connected with superciliaries (supraoculars) ou each side by two large 
plates; inside of these a second row; included space tilled by small 
scales. Scales margining su])erciliaries (supraoculars) small; S(;at- 
tered larger ones toward the center of the intermediate sfjace. Three 
rows of scales between the suborbitals and labials. Suborbitals extend- 
ing to the middle of the orbit. Labials 15 or IG above; lirst, fifth, and 
seventh largest, and vertical; below, 18; lirst, fourth, and fifth largest. 
Dorsal rows, 27; outer rows obsoletely carinated. Three or 4 dark 
rings on tail. Three series of well defined perfect rhombs, 1 dorsal, 2 
lateral, separated by narrow lines. Light stripe from sui^erciliary to 
the angle of the mouth. 

Scales on the cheek smooth. Three rather large plates on the edge 
of the upper part of the head, between the superciliajies (supraoculars) 
and rostral, inside of which is a second row of o, also larger than the 
rest. 

The two lower rows of lateral scales smooth. Third and fourth very 
hiintly carinated. Scales ou the back and sides not conspicuously dif- 
ferent in size except the lower two or three rows. Posteriorly, near the 
tail, all the scales are carinated except the lowest. 

General color, yellowish gray, with rhomboidal black blotches, lighter 
in the center, and with all the angles perfect. Or rather there is a 
series of dull yellowish lines crossing obliquely from one side of the 
abdomen to the other over the back, following the oblique series of 
scales, and occupying generally the jiosterior half of each scale, the 
basal portion being black. These lines, of which there are about 36 
crossing from each side, from head to tail (9 on tail), decussate first on 
the fifth or sixth lateral row, and then on the back, where they are 
more or less confluent three or four rows. The rhomboids thus inclosed 
and crossing the back are generally black for li or 2 scales within the 
yellowish brown, mottled with darker. The intervals ou the sides 
between the lines are mostly dark yellowish brow n, minutely mottled 
with dark brown. These intervals constitute a lateral series of trans- 
verse rhomboids, sometimes with the lower angle truncated. Opposite 
to the dorsal rhomboids is a series of small triangles in the angles of 
the first decussation. The distance between two i)arallel transverse 
stripes generally consists of five rows of scales, occasionally of six. 

On the sides and posteriorly these markings are more or less indis- 
tinct, though generally recognizable. The tail usually exhibits a good 
deal of black. The under parts are dull yellowish white, or greeuish 
white, clouded toward the sides with brown; no regular spots visible. 
The black on the tail does not constitute complete rings, but is inter- 
rupted in the middle of the lower surface, and in fact the black patches 
alternate with each other, and are not opposite.

POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 435 

The top of Lead is liglitbrowu, with occasional black scales, A ckill 
yellowish streak starts at the posterior edge of the superciliary plate, 
and passing obliquely backward, through two rows of scales, extends 
to angle of the mouth (fig. 58). A second band starts on the plate in 
advance of the superciliary, and crossing the anterior orbitals, expands 
till it involves the seventh, eighth, and ninth nipper labials. Interval 
between the first two stripes dark brown. There are also indications 
of a second vertical light bar in front of the nostril, and two below the 
pit. Eostral dark yellowish, lighter in the margin. 

Number of ventrals (gastrosteges), 1G9; of subcaudals (urosteges), 
32; scale rows across body, 27. 

Variation. — With the exception of the nsual variation of the ground 
color through the various tinges of grayish and brownish, the color 
and pattern of this species is unusually constant. The characteristic 
whitish stri^jes on rostral, nasals, and on the sides of the head are 
well marked, even in the largest sj)ecimeus, and the dorsal i^attern is 
also nearly always very distinct. 

Geograi)hical distribution. — The diamond rattler inhabits a compara- 
tively small area in the southeastern corner of our country. Florida 
seems to be the center of its distribution, and from that State it extends 
along the coast northward into the southern portion of North Carolina 
at about the thirty-fifth parallel, Mr. H. H. Brindey having in letter 
advised me of a specimen, presumably of this species, having been 
taken in 1885 at the Neuse Eiver, across fiom New Berne. Along the 
gulf coast it extends at least as far west as the Mississippi Eiver, being 
still found not far from New Orleans, as Dr. Gustave Kohn informs me, 
although very scarce. It also ascends the Mississippi Eiver some dis- 
tance, exactly how far I do not know, but a specimen is in the National 
Museum (No. 4393) which is said to have been collected by Col. Kear- 
ney in Arkansas. 

In Florida the species is found everywhere, including the Keys. 

Habits. — The Diamond Eattler, or Diamond-backed Eattlesnake, is 
usually called the Water Eattler in localities where the Banded Eattle- 
snake also occurs in order to distinguish it from the latter, which is 
then known as the Timber-Eattler. As the name indicates, this species 
is rather partial to the neighborhood of water, although it is not a 
water snake to the extent of pursuing its prey into the water. Yet it 
is said to be a good swimmer and not even afraid to cross over from 
Key to Key {Loennhcrg, I. c). 

Although rather common, and i^robably the Eattlesnake most fre- 
quently seen in captivity, at least in this country, but little detailed and 
reliable information concerning its habits can be found in the litera- 
ture. The observers who have had anything to say about it are 
often much at variance. Some regard it as very slow and clumsy, others 
again insist that it is much more active than the Banded Eattlesnake 
and much fiercer. Some report their inability to induce this species 



436 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

to eat ill oouflueuient, Avliile others again claim that it ta;kes food with- 
out trouble. Equally defective is our knowledge in regard to its 
breeding habits. 

The Diamond Rattler is our largest species', and in fact one of the 
largest of the whole family. The largest specimen in the National 
Museum collection (No. 10947) is only feet H^ inches long, but much 
larger specimens are on record. Dr. C. S. Allen has recorded 1 speci- 
men 8 feet 5 inches, with a circumference of 15 inches, which was shot 
near Oak Lodge, Fla., by Clias. F. Latham, in November, 1890, while 
Mr. Frank M. Chapman mentions one 8 feet 9 inches long, and killed 
by J. H. Norton, of Jacksonville.* 

We often enough hear of Florida Rattlers 9 feet or more long, but in 
all cases I have investigated it was found that the measurements were 
taken from skins, or mounted ppecimens, which of course may be 
stretched almost to any desired length. 

With a supply of venom proportionate to its size the dangerous 
nature of a stroke of one of these large brutes, if well delivered, may 
well be imagin'ed. Nevertheless, fatalities are comparatively rare, and 
even cases of bites are not heard of nearly as often as one miglit bo 
led to suppose from the number of specimens which are still found in 
many places.

Description.* — Head subtriangular; plates on head; 2 anterior fron- 
tals (iuternasals) in contact; between these and superciliaries (snpra- 
ocnlars), on side of the crown, 2 imbricated phxtes; space inclosed occu- 
pied by smaller scales; superciliaries (supraoculars) bordered by a row 
of larger scales; the anterior much largest. Three rows of scales 
between labials and suborbitals; labials 16 above, first, fifth, and sev- 
enth, largest; 15 below, first and third largest; dorsal rows 25-27; 2 
exterior rows smooth ; on the tail 3-0 half riugs. Color yellowish brown, 
with a continuous succession of dorsal lozenges, sometimes truncate 
beforeand behind ; intervals all narrow. A single transverse light line ; 
superciliary stripe from superciliary directly to the angle of the mouth. 

General style of coloration somewhat as in C. adamanteus. Ground 
color above, dull yellowish brown, with a series of subhexagonal 
patches from the head nearly to the tail, in an uninterrupted series, 
separated throughout by narrow lines. We may refer the markings to 
the intersection of two series of light yellowish lines, about 40 in 
number, crossing obliquely from each side across to the other, along 
the anterior half of as many oblique series of scales. The lateral 
decussation is along the sixth row of dorsal scales; on the back, where 
they cross, the lines are confluent for a breadth of 5 or G scales, mak- 
ing a series of transverse lines across the back, truncating the obtuse 
angles of the rhomboids, which would otherwise be produced. Some- 
times the acute lateral angles of the rhomboids are also truncated. 
Laterally, the yellowish lines are more or less obsolete, leaving a more 
or less distinct chain pattern. The rhomboids or subrhomboids 
inclosed have a narrow margin of dark brown, lighter toward the 
center. In all cases the interval between the successive rhomboids is 
but 1 or 2 half scales in width. The lateral rhomboids and triangles 
referred to in G. adamanteus are indicated by two alternating series of 
dark brown blotches, the first along the third and fourth lateral row, 
opposite the apices of the rhomboids; the second along the sixth and 
seventh, and alternating with the same; the spots occupy 1 scale, or 
liart of 4 contiguous ones. Space between these rhomboids and the 
yellowish lines, dull yellowish brown. Beneath nearly uniform yellow- 
ish, slightly clouded on the sides of the scales. On the tail the 
blotches are confluent into 3 or dark brown half rings, interrupted 
on the surface. General distribution of lines on the head much as in 



* Original description by S. F. Baird, in Baird and Girard, N. Am. Serp., p. 5, from 
tbe type specimens from Texas. 



438 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

C. adamanteus ; a narrow light line from the posterior end of supercil- 
iary backward directly to the angle of the mouth; a second from the 
anterior extremity, nearly parallel with the first, the two inclosing an 
indistinct patch and separated on the labials by 4i scales. There is 
also a single narrow light line across the superciliary perpendicular 
to its length, obsolete in old specimens. 

It may readily be distinguished from C. <((!(( manteus by its light color 
and the truncations of the rhomboids, as well as the general obsolete- 
ness of the lateral markings. The rhomboids are longer in proportion 
and more roiTuded. The 2 lateral rows of scales are smooth, the next 
2 more strongly carinated than in C. adamanteus. The fifth upper 
labial is largest, and transverse, the rest nearly uniform. The stripes 
on the side of the head are less distinct. 

From C. confiuentus it may be distinguished by the greater compara- 
tive size of the interval between the dorsal blotches, especially poste- 
riorly. In G. conlinenius there are two light lines across the supercil- 
iary plate, dividing it into three sections, the central rather narrower. 

Here, too, the j)osterior facial stripe, instead of passing to the angle of 
the month, goes back of it on the second row above the labials, in C. 
atrox, passing directly to the angle of the mouth. Other important 
distincti(ms are seen in the narrower scales of C. confluentus, etc. 

From C. lueife)\ the more narrow head, fewer and larger intersuper- 
ciliary scales, lighter color, arrangement of color along the head, will 
at once distinguish it. 

Number of ventrals (gastrosteges), 177 to 187; number of subcaudals 
(urosteges), 23 to 28; number of scale rows across the body, 25 to 27. 

Variation. — This species exhibits a considerable variation in the 
scutellation, less so in coloration. The ground color is usually more or 
less grayish, with a varying amount of brownish, olive, or yellowish 
admixture, while on the Pacific coast there seems to be a reddish form, 
geographically liinited, which will be considered separately as a race. 
The head pattern is fairly constant and will at once serve to distinguish 
this species from C. adamanteus, the nasals and anterior labials being 
unicolor, densely dusted over with minute black dots. 

As for the scutellation, the greatest variation is shown in the pres- 
ence, or absence, of an upper loreal, as well as in the size of the scales 
or scutes covering the upper surface of the snout. In a number of 
specimens the upper head scales are more or less enlarged, in some 
forming on the snout a series of paired scutes reaching to between the 
orbits, very much after fashion of C. molossus and its nearest allies. 
This character, however, is shared by specimens belonging to other 
species, for instance C. horrid ns, and notably in C. coniiuentus, so much 
so, in fact, that the so-called C. scntulatus, which is based upon such 
specimens, is composed of specimens of both species. The character 
is mostly exhibited4n specimens from the Mexican tableland and its 
extension into Arizona, but it is apparently not constant enough to

warrant us in recognizing? it as a geographic subspecies even. The 
character is an ancestral one, and its appearance may probably be 
attributed to reversion. 

Geographical distribution. — Crotalus atr ox covers a considerable area, 
embracing the arid portion of Texas, parts of southern New Mexico, 
Arizona, and California, southward into Mexico. In western and 
southern Texas, west of about the ninety- seventh meridian this species 
appear to be the Rattlesnake, being apparently common in all suitable 
localities. It does not appear to occur in the moist region of eastern 
Texas, and as a matter of fact we do not know which form occupies 
that region at all, whether C. adamanteus extends so far west as to 
meet its western representative, G. atrox, or whether there is an actual 
gap between the two species, occupied by neither. Toward the north. 
Prof. Cope (Proc. Phila. Acad., 1S92, p. 336), has found it at the eastern 
foot of the Staked Plain, about the head of the Colorado River, but he 
did not meet with it on the Plain itself, nor north of the region men- 
tioned. That it extends considerably farther north is proven, however, 
by a specimen (Ko. 4225) in the National Museum, collected near the 
western boundary of Texas, just south of the Canadian River and at 
the northern foot of the Llano Estacado. 

Habits. — Very little has been written concerning the habits of G. 
atrox, but in a general way they may be considered to be similar to 
those of G. adamanteus, except that the former is apparently less 
partial to water. Being a large and powerful snake, though not quite 
so large as the Diamond Rattlesnake, it is capable of intiicting very 
dangerous bites.

Description.} — Rostral plate a little wider than high; plates of upper 
side of canthers rostralis smaller tlian in other subspecies, the posterior 
especially smaller than the anterior, and partly decurved laterally. 
One loreal. Five rows of scales between orbit and labial; eight rows 
between superciliary plates. Second pair of inferior labials with the 
marginal portion cut off from the postsymphyseal portion. (Perhaps 
an abnormality.) 

The color is light red, marked above with deep red spots. These are 
of a longitudinal oval form anteriorly, but posteriorly they have a 
diamond-shai^ed form. They have no distinct lateral borders, either 
light or dark, but they are separated on the median line of the back bj- 
a single row of yellow-tipped scales. Traces of brownish red indefinite

spots opi)Osite tbeir lateral angles as well as their intervals. Head 
without marking, except a faint trace of a pale line from the eye to the 
border of the mouth below it. Inferior surfaces yellow. Tail white, 
with five black cross bands, of which all but the first are complete rings. 

Gastrosteges (ventrals), 186; urosteges (subcaudals), 20; scale rows, 
27; total length, 1.245mm. 

Variation. — The characters upon which this form were originally 
based, viz, the small size of the scales on canthus rostralis and the 
absence of either light or dark borders to the dorsal rhombs do not 
seem to hold in a larger series, for of the additional specimens which I 
have seen some have the cauthal scales of normal size, while in nearly 
all the specimens there are traces at least of the borders to the dorsal 
spots, these borders becoming apparently less distinct as the snakes 
grow larger. The only character which seems to fairly distinguish this 
form as a subspecies is the bright cinnamon red color of its upper sur- 
face, at least in the large specimens. 

Geograpliical distribution. — This subspecies was originally described 
from a specimen the habitat of which was not known. Since then I 
have seen, thanks to Dr. C. Hart Merriam, several large specimens from 
Twin Oaks, San Diego County, on the Pacific slope of the coast ranges, 
which fixes the range of the form. A young specimen in the National 
Museum (No. 88.-)6), somewhat darker and less bright red than the 
others, probably either on account of its age or the long time it has 
been in alcohol, is recorded as collected by A. W. Chase at San Fran- 
cisco, November, 1875, but it is probably very doubtful if the specimen 
really came from the immediate vicinity of that city. 

Hahits. — Nothing special is known of the life history of this form,

Description.* — Head siibtriangular. Plates on top of liead squami- 
foriii, irregular, aiigulated, and iiubricated ; scales between snpercili- 
aries (supraoculars) small, numerous, uniform. Four rows of scales 
between the suborbital series (which only extends to the center of the 
orbit) and the labials. Labials 15 or 18, nearly uniform. Dorsal series 
27-29. Dorsal blotches quadrate, concave before and behind; intervals 
greater behind. Spots transversely quadrate posteriorly, ultimately 
becoming 10 or 12 half rings. Two transverse lines on superciliaries, 
inclosing about one-third. Stripe from superciliary to angle of jaws 
crosses angle of the mouth on the second row above labial. Eostral 
margined with lighter. 

This species bears a considerable resemblance to C. atrox, but the 
body is more slender and compact. Scales on tlie top of the head 
anterior to the superciliaries nearly uniform in size. Line of scales 
across from one nostril to the other consists of 0, not 4 as in C. atrox. 
Superciliaries more prominent. Labial series much smaller. Upper 
anterior orbitals (preoculars) much smaller, as also is the anterior nasal. 

* From S. F. Baird's description of specimens from Wichita Mts. and Texas, in 
Baird and Girard's N. Am. Serp., p. 8. 



442 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Scales on the top of the head less carinated. Scales between super- 
ciliaries smaller and more numerous, 5 or C in number instead of 4. 
Two lateral rows of scales smooth, first, second, and third gradually 
increasing in size. Scales more linear than in C. atrox. 

General color yellowish brown with a series of subquadrate dark 
blotches, with the corners rounded and the anterior and posterior sides 
frequently concave, the exterior convex (fig. 53). These blotches are 10 
or 11 scales wide and -lor 5 long, lighter in the center, and margined for 
one-third of a scale with light yellowish. The intervals along the back 
light brown, darker than the margins of the blotches. Anteriorly the 
interval between the dark spots is but a single scale; posteriorly it is 
more, becoming sometimes 2 scales, where also the spots are more 
rhomboidal or lozenge shaped ; nearer the tail, however, they become 
transversely quadrate. The fundamental theory of coloration might 
be likened to that of Crotalus adainaiiteus, viz, of 40 or 50 light lines 
decussating each other from opposite sides; but the angles of decus- 
sating, instead of being acute, are obtuse, and truncated or rounded otf 
throughout. Along the third, fourth, an<l fifth lateral rows of scales 
is a series of indistinct brown blotches covering a space of about 4 
scales and falling opposite to the dorsal blotches; between these 
blotches, and opposite to the intervals of the dorsal blotches, are others 
less distinct. Along the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth rows is a 
second series of obsolete blotches, each covering a space of about 4 
scales, and just opposite the intervals between the dorsal spots. Tlie 
dorsal and lower series are separated by an interval of 3 scales, this 
interval light brown. Beneath the color is dull yellowish, and 10 or 13 
darker half rings are visible on the tail. 

In point of coloration the principal features, as compared with C. 
atrox, lie in the dorsal blotches, being disposed in subquadrate spots 
instead of subrhomboids; the intervals thus forming bands across the 
back perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. This tendency to assume 
the subquadrangular pattern has broken up thechainwork into isolated 
portions, as in Coluber eximius or Crotalophorus tergcminus {Sistnirus 
calenatus). The intervals of the dorsal blotches are wide and darker in 
the middle, while in C. atrox they are narrow, not linear, and unicolor. 
The sides of the head (fig. 59) present the usual light stripe from the 
posterior extremity of the superciliary; it passes, however, to the angle 
of the jaw on the neck, along the second row of scales above the labials. 
A second stripe passes in front of the eye to the labials, widening there, 
A small, light vertical bar is seen below the pit and another on the 
outer edge of the rostral. On the superciliaries are seen two light trans- 
verse lines inclosing a space nearly one-third of ihe whole surface. In 
C. atrox there is a single median line. Sometimes, as in C. atrox, the 
single blotches on the nape are replaced by two elongated ones parallel 
to each other. 



POIHONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMEKICA. 443 

Variation. — There is some slight variation in the size of the scales 
covering- the top of the head, which is, in a general way, correlated with 
the latitndeof the locality, but the character is so exceedingly unstable 
and apparently unsupported by any other character tliat it would be 
unprofitable and misleading to adopt any subspecies at the present 
stage of our knowledge, at least. This instability in the size of the 
head scales sometimes goes so far as to fuse them into nearly regular 
shields on the snout and between the eyes, exactly in the same manner 
as in certain specimens of Crotalus atrox, which have been called Cro- 
talus sciitulatus, the result being that this so called species or subspecies 
is a mixture of rt/ro.P and confliientus. Such scutulated specimens have 
been found both in Arizona and in Montana, the two extremes of its 
geographical distribution. A specimen from Fort Hayes is recorded by 
Garman as having the outer edge of the supraocular produced into a 
horn, as in G. cerastes. 

The color varies also greatly being sometimes duller, sometimes 
brighter, lighter or darker, depending upon age, season, condition of 
skin, climate, and the predominating color of the surroundings, but I 
have seen no differences of such a character or stability as to render 
the recognition of geographical races possible or profitable. 

Oeographtcal (listribiition. — Broadly speaking, the Prairie Rattlesnake 
occui^ies the area bounded in the East by the ninety-sixth meridian and 
the Upper Missouri Valley; by the main divide of the Rocky Moun- 
tains in the West; by the thirty-third parallel in Texas and the Mexi- 
can boundary further west in the South; and by the fiftieth parallel in 
the North. In the Northeast its distribution apx3ears to be limited by 
the watershed between Missouri and the Red River of the North, 
according to Dr. Coues (Bull. Geol. Surv. Terr, iv, 1878, p. 207), who 
cellected numerous specimens along the Canadian border between this 
watershed and the crest of the Rockies. He also states that it is to be 
considered fairly common in the region of the Upi^er Missouri and Milk 
River and some of their northern tributaries; its range thus extending 
some distance into the British Possessions, where Mr. James M. 
Macoun informs me that it is most abundant from Medicine Hat, on the 
Saskatchewan, to the boundary. In the region just south of the above, 
Dr. J. A. Allen, while attached to the Union Pacific Railroad expedi- 
tion, found itcommon, esi^ecially in the bad lands of the Little Missouri 
and along the Yellowstone, outnumbering all the other ophidians 
together, and on the expedition of 1872 not less than 2,000 were killed 
(Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., xvii, 1874, p. 69). In Nebraska, Taylor 
(Amer. Natural., xxvi, Sept. 1802, p. 752) observes that it was formerly 
abundant all over the State, but that it is now confined almost wholly 
to the middle and western part, where it is by no means rare. The dis- 
tribution in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Indian Territory is very similar, 
while in northwestern Texas it is recorded from between the main 



444 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

folks of tlie Brazos River and on the Llano Estacado as far south as 
Canon Blanco (Coi)e, Zool. Pos. Texas, p. 24; Proc. Pliila. Acad. 1892, 
p. 330). Further west Capt. Pope collected specimens at the Pecos 
Eivernear the thirty-second parallel. As we leave the plains in going 
west M'C find this species ascend higher into the mountains, as it is not 
uncommon in New Mexico and Arizona and Colorado above 5,000 feet 
altitude. Even in Montana and Idaho it reaches this elevation, at least 
in places, though it probably does not occur much higher. Although 
the main divide of the Rocky Mountains in this northern region seems 
to be the limit of its extension to the west, yet in at least one place 
where there is no high crest to obstruct its passage across, has it been 
found on the western slope, viz; at Lemhi, Idaho, in which locality it 
was collected by parties of Dr. Merriam's Idaho exi)loration party, as 
recorded by me in North American Fauna, No. 5, p. Ill (1891). 

Habits. — The Prairie Rattlesnake being one of the smaller species, 
as it seldom reaches a length of over 4 feet with a proportionately 
slender body, does not seem to be a very dangerous snake. Dr. Allen, 
as referred to above, found it so common in the region visited by the 
expedition that several hundred were killed by the different members, 
yet the only casualty resulting from it was one horse bitten. On the 
expedition of J 872 not less than two thousand were killed and not a 
man nor an animal was bitten. Allen also comments ui^oii the fact that 
they were found abroad quite late in the season, as they were met with 
quite frequently after several severe frosts had occurred. During July 
two pairs were found in coitn, indicating the season at which they fjair. 
Dr. O. P. Hay (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xv, 1892, p. 387), on the other 
hand, quotes Prof. S, W. Williston as stating that the sexes pair in May. 

Taylor (/. c.) found its food habits similar to those of the Massasauga. 
It is the species often found in or around the homes of the prairie 
dogs, where they are most abundantly found during the breeding 
season of the doj,.^ 

Professor Cope records a similar observation (Proc. Phila. Acad., 
1892, p. 330) and remarks that the snake protects itself by retreating 
quickly into the holes of the prairie dogs. The popular belief that 
these rodents and the rattlesnakes live together because of any special 
friendship is certainly erroneous, as there can be no doubt that the 
latter to a great extent feed upon the offspring of the former. 

In addition to the hibernation, which, according to Dr. Coues, lasts 
about six months, terminating with the loosening of the ground from 
frost, Dr. Suckley (Pac. R. R. Rep., xii, Pt. iii, p. 290) observed these 
snakes m a more or less sluggish and stupid condition during the 
drought of summer, a condition which he calls " aestivation."

Ground color, light brown above. Along the back a series of sub- 
hexagonal or octagonal blotches, formed by a skeleton of dull yellowish, 
constituting a dorsal chain. The space thus inclosed ot the ground 
color is margined faintly with dark brown; the width of the interval 
between the suc(;essive blotches is from one-half to li scales. These 
spots are frequently confluent, two and three running together. Where 
most distinct the spots are 1 scales long and 11 wide. On each side of 
this dorsal series is a second, separated by a single row of scales, the 
blotches extending from the abdominal scutelhe to the fifth or sixth 
row. These are smaller than the dorsal, and subcircular. Opposite the 
transverse light bands, and in the open space between four contiguous 
blotches on the sides, smaller blotches are indistinctly visible. Poste- 
riorly, the spots on the back and sides are confluent and darker; in one 
s[)ecimen forming 17 half rings, encircling the back, leaving about 21 
dorsal blotches. Abdomen greenish yellow, more or less clouded with 
brown at the bases of the scales. Head dai'k brown ; a light line from 
posterior portion of the superciliaries along the fourth row of suprala- 
bial scales back to the angle of the jaws, on the occiput, where it 
expands into the color of the under part. Upper labials of the same 
light color behind, rapidly widening anteriorly so as to include whole 
front and side of the face, leaving only the top of the head dark. The 
space about the facial i)it darker. (See fig. 00). 

The theory of coloration is that of decussating lines, which, when 
they intersect, unite so as to have the angles of intersection truncated. 

The species has a general resemblance to C. atrox in the arrange- 
ment of the blotches, but is darket, and has about 17 dark half rings 
posteriorly instead of 4 or 5. In C. atrox the head is narrower and 
more triangular, the space between the superciliaries narrow and occu- 
pied by angulated larger scales, instead of small tuberculous ones. In 
(J. atrox the row bordering the superciliaries is much larger th^in the 
rest, and the scales on the top of the head generally more angulated. 
In C. lucifer the line on the side of the head (fig. GO), instead of going 
directly from the posterior end of the superciliary to the commissures, 
passes back nearly parallel to the mouth, crossing along the fourth row

of scales above the labial. The second line in front of the eye is much 
wider below in C. Incifer, and the face generally shows more of white, 
while the dark portions are much darker. 

Variation. — There is a great deal of variation observable in the vari- 
ous specimens before us, particularly in the, shape of the head, as well 
as in the general coloration. As with most of these snakes, the char- 
acteristic head pattern becomes obsolete as tlie individuals grow large, 
and this character, which is otliei wise so constant and reliable in the 
young, is sometimes difficult of application in very large and old ones. 
However, I have yet to see a specimen in which the essential parts of 
it can not be made out if care be exercised. The ground color also 
varies greatly according to climatic and other local conditions, very 
dark, nearly black specimens with strongly contrasted color pattern 
in whitish being frequently found near the coast, or in mountain regions 
with a very moist climate, while, on the other hand, specimens living 
in the arid region among light-colored surroundings are often greatly 
faded, as shown by various specimens from Utah and other portions of 
the great basin. Upou an examination of a large series, however, I 
can not find any more reliable or stable color difference than is usual in 
most species covering a large area and subject to varying, often very 
restricted, local influences, and I can uot see my way clear to recognize 
any subspecies of G. lucifer on this account. 

The difference in the outline of the snout and the proportionate 
Avidth of the head Agarics apparently greatly, as stated, though hardly 
more than in several other species. These differences depend greatly 
upon the general condition of the snake, upon the amount of venom in 
the gland, and, in alcoholic specimens, upon their state of i^reservation, 
specimens dried and hardened in too strong alcohol showmg a much 
more pointed snout than those preserved in a moderately strong solu- 
tion, while in soft examples kept in a too Aveak fluid the face is often 
swollen and rounded. 

It appears probable that Holbrook's C. oregonus is based upon such a 
hardened specimen, but as I have not been able to examine it I have 
refrained for the present from exchanging the well-knowti name lucifer 
for the older appellation. The material at my disposal is not sufti- 
cieutly extensive, nor is its quality sufficiently satisfactory to allow me 
tojiass a final judgment upon the question Avhether there really occurs 
one or two subspecies or forms on the Pacific province, a question 
AAiiich therefore must be considered still open. 

Geographical distribution. — Crotalus lucifer is the characteristic snake 
of the Pacific province as well as the northern portion of the Great 
Basin. In southern California it occurs on the Avest slope of the coast 
ranges of San Diego and Los Angeles counties from the sea level high 
up into the mountains. It is even found on at least some of the islands 
off the coast, as, for instance, Santa Catalina Island and Los Coronados. 
In the southern jiart of the great interior A^alley of California this 



448 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Eattlesiiake is equally at home iu the foothills aud on the higher slopes 
of the Sierra Nevada, at least up to an altitude of 8,600 feet above the 
level of tbe sea. In the lower cultivated country it is rapidly becoming 
extinct in some places, while on the other hand there are records of its 
increase in other localities, Dr. Behr (Proc. Calif. Acad. Sc. (2), i, 1888, 
p. 94) has called attention to this curious circumstance with regard to 
its occurrence in various localities around San Francisco Bay. Our 
records for northern California are less complete, but it is undoubtedly 
equally widely distributed in all suitable localities, though probably not 
so high up in the mountains. Townsend (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., x, 1887, 
p. 230) found it ''pretty generally distributed, but more numerous in the 
foothills of Shasta County than elsewhere. Very few snakes were met 
with in the elevated coniferous forests, aud none high up on the mouu- 
tahis." In Oregon and Washington this species is still common ini)hu'es. 
In the early days of these states Dr. Suckley (Pac. E. R. Rep., xii, Pt. iii, 
p. 295) found them to be so numerous at the Dalles as to be very annoy- 
ing, having been known to enter dwelling houses. Dr. Cooper (/. c.) 
states that they are much less numerous north of the Columbia River 
than south, and also that none are found west of the Cascade Range, 
except an occasional straggler carried down the Columbia River. How- 
ever that may be in Washington, it certainly does not hold for Oregon, as 
the National Museum possesses a specimen from Fort [Jmi)qua (No. 
4234). Lord (Naturalist in Vancouver Island, 1860, p. 303) says that at 
the Dalles, the Snake, Pelouse, and Spokane rivers, indeed along the 
entire bimndary line between the British Possessions and the United 
States west of the continental divide, and high up in the Rocky Moun- 
tains " its name is legion.'''' The exact northern boundary of the species 
in British Columbia is not recorded, but Mr. James M. Macoun, of the 
Geological Survey of Canada, writes me that it is confined to a small 
area in the interior of British Columbia, bounded on the west by Lytton, 
on the North Thompson River, being found in that latitude as far east 
as Shuswap Lake. The farthest eastern record is about 10 miles east 
of Okanagan Lake, in the vicinity of which they are very abundant. 

This species evidently follows up the tributaries of the Columbia into 
the interior, for a number of specimens were collected in Idaho, at Big 
Butte aud Little Lost River, by parties of Dr. Merriam's Idaho explora- 
tion party (N. Am. Fauna, No. 5, 1891, p. 111). 

Whether the distribution of this species into Nevada is continuous to 
the north with the Oregon and Idaho localities remains yet to be seen, 
though it seems probable. It is also continuous into the eastern por- 
tion of northern California. Robert Ridgway, during King's explo- 
ration of the fortieth parallel, found it excessively abundant on the 
little island in the Pyramid Lake, and also collected it at the Truckee 
River, and later explorers have also recorded it as common from that 
neighborhood. Farther east it has been obtained in Nevada and Utah 
by the various Government exploring parties at altitudes of 5,000 feet 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA, 449 

and upwards, and in the southern portion of these States this Eattle- 
snake almost certainly does not descend below 5,000 feet. Dr. Mer- 
riam's various parties, which in 1891 were scouring the mountain ranges 
and deserts of Nevada and Utah south of the thirty-eighth parallel, 
failed to find a single specimen, so that it seems almost certain that it 
does not occur there. The records of this species from Arizona are 
very dubious, as the specimens so recorded which I have had an oppor- 
tunity to examine have either been inisidentified, or else the locality 
was very doubtful. 

Habits. — The Pacific Rattlesnake undoubtedly in a general way shares 
in the habits of its congeners, bat is perhaps even less offensive than 
most of them in spite of the fact that it often reaches dimensions which 
might make it dangerous enough. It seems to prefer rocky places, 
whether timbered or not, but it does not invade the desert proper.

450 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Variation. — Beyond the usual iudividual variation in number of scale 
rows, loveals, labials, size of scales on top of head, etc., nothing special 
has been noticed in the material examined. The color varies from 
whitish to tawny. The head markings are rather indistinct, especially 
the postocular stripe, which is often lost in the dense si)rinkling of 
minute black dots covering the sides of the head. 

Geographical distrihution. — This rare snake was formerly only known 
from a few localities in southern Arizona near the Mexican boundary, 
until in 1891 the Death Valley exploration under Dr. Merriam extended 
its range very materially into the desert mountains of southern Cali- 
fornia and Nevada south of the thirty-seventh parallel, from Owens 
Valley to the Great Bend of the Colorado, where these snakes Avere 
found to be quite common, as Dr. A. K. Fisher and his party killed no 
less than nineteen in or near Shepherd Canyon, Argus Range, Califor- 
nia, during the latter part of April and first week of May, 1801 The 
vertical range is considerable, as Dr. Merriam's party collected speci- 
mens at altitudes varying between about 2,000 and 0,500 feet above the 
sea. 

Habits. — The Tiger Eattler which has received its name, not from any 
extreme degree of bloodthirstiness or fatal aggressiveness, but from its 
tawny color and marked cross stripes, seems partial to the barren moun- 
tain ranges with their rocks and crevices in preference to the desert 
valleys surrounding them. It is one of the smaller species and com- 
paratively harmless, though, of course, a bite when inflicted might be 
serious enough. 

During the Death A'alley expedition under Dr. C. Hart Merriam, a 
specimen was found in a wood rat's nest that was dug open. Its stomach 
contained a kangaroo rat {Dipoclomys) and a pocket mouse {Pero(/ita- 
thns), indicating nocturnal habits. 

Mr. Stephens, of the same party, on April 15, 1891, killed a pair of 
these snakes which were on a ledge of rock, standing erect with their 
heads near together, " apparently playing." They were probably pur- 
suing their amours, and the time would thus indicate the XJairing season 
of the species.

rows of scales between the suborbital series (which is complete of large 
scales) and the labials. Upper labials 11 to 13, lower 12 to 13. Dorsal 
rows of scales 21, slightly carinated; each scale along the middle of the 
baek with a tubercular swelling toward the center. Crown tubercular. 
Entire head and upper parts of a slight yellowish, with a dorsal series 
of small, indistinct blotches, below which are several irregular rows of 
isolated brown dots. A narroAv, brown stripe extends from the orbit 
back over the angle of the mouth. 

Geofjraphical distribution. — In a general way the horned rattlesnake 
inhabits the same region as C. tigris, viz, southern Arizona, California, 
and Nevada, but while the latter inhabits the mountain ranges of this 
area the former is more confined to the desert plains and valleys. 

The type locality is Mojave Desert, whence Dr. Merriam, in 1801, 
rediscovered it and secured specimens. His Death Valley expedition 
brought home numerous specimens from nearly all the suitable locali- 
ties visited, and he found it to be " the characteristic snake of the 
Lower Sonoran deserts of the Great Basin, from southern California 
easterly across southern Nevada to Arizona and southwestern Utah." 
We have received specimens from Mr. E. C. Orcutt, who obtained them

452 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

in the Colorado Desert, San Diego County, Cal., near Salton, from 
Cbrystoval, Ariz., aud other phvces in the GiUi and Cok^rado deserts. 
It occurs at least as far east as Tempe, where we have specimens from 
Dr. Wortmau, and I myself have collected it at Vulture, Ariz. 

Eahits. — The Horned Eattlesnake is known locally as the '' side- 
winder " throughout its range, as Dr. Merriam explains, on account of 
its peculiar mode of progression : 

When disturbed it moves awaj^ sideways, keeping its broadside towards the 
observer instead of proceeding in the usual serpentine manner. 

Its feeding habits seems to be similar to those of the Tiger Eattler, as 
a specimen collected by the Death Valley expedition contained a kan- 
garoo rat and 2 pocket mice. As it is a small snake It is probably 
comparatively harmless, though it has a very bad reputation, but there 
is nothing to indicate that its venom is more virulent than that of the 
other Eattlesnakes. Dr. Merriam's iiarties brought home 15 specimens 
and killed a good many more, but no one was bitten. 

As to the breeding habits we have the following observation by Dr. 
Merriam : 

During the latter part of April aud the earlj- part of May these Rattlesnakes were 
often found in pairs and were doubtless mating. At such times they lemained out 
in plain sight over night, instead of retreating to holes or shelter under desert 
brush, and on two occasions they were found by us on cold mornings so early that 
they were too chilled to move until considerably disturbed. I stepped on one of 
these by accident as it lay in a compact coil with its head in the center, but it was 
held so firmly by my weight that it was unable to strike. A moment before I had 
killed its mate.

The color above is greenish gray, which is crossed by 19 jet-black 
rings on the body (fig. 54), which do not extend on the abdomen. 
These rings are 2^ scales wide on the middle line, and narrow down- 
wards on each side so as to cover but 1 scale in width. The scales 
which border the annuli are half black and half green, the eflect of which 
is to give the edge of the ring a turreted outline. The edges of the 
ground-color are paler than any other part of the scales, thus throw- 
ing the black into greater relief. 
A large black spot, shaped like U 
hearts side by side with the apices 
posterior, marks the najye, and there 
is an irregular small black spot on 
each side of the occiput. Some black 
specks between the orbits. No other rio^ 68 

marks on the head. Near the middle head of crotalus lepidus, side view. 
of the gray spaces of the body some ^" '" '""'' ""■ '' ''^ "^ 

of the scales of many of the rows have black tips. The tail is light 
brown above and has a basal broad black, and 2 other narrow brown 
annuli. Below, dirty white Avith closely placed shades of brown. 

Variation. — Prof. Snow, in 1884, in a letter to the reptile department 
of the National Museum, describes the fresh color of the specimen just 
described, taken by him at the head of Water Canyon, New Mexico, in 
August of 1881, from memory, as being of " an unmistakable glaucous 
or grayish green" which contrasted beautifully with the jet-black bands. 
In the specimens in the National Museum the bands are brown in the 
center, black at the edges. 

In the scutellation of the head there is some variation, but nothing 
out of the unusual. The nostrils are comparatively small, and Keniii- 
cott originally described the species as having them situated in an undi- 
vided nasal, which afterwards led Cope to institute the genus Aploaspis. 
The two heads upon which the species was originally based do not seem 
to be in existence any more, but in the si^ecimens which I have examined 
there is certainly a division of the nasal at least below the nostril. 
The upper preocular appears always to be divided vertically. 

In 3 specimens examined by me the scale rows varied from 21 to 23; 
the ventrals (gastrosteges), from IGO to 163; subcaudals (urosteges), 
from 21 to 25. 

Geographical distribution. — This species, although apparently ex- 
tremely rare, seems to occur all along our Mexican border, at least 
from Eagle Pass on the Rio Grande to Yuma on the Colorado. Since the 
two heads collected by the Mexican Boundary Survey parties at Eagle 
Pass and Presidio del Norte, no specimens have been recorded from 
Texas. Prof. Frank Snow, however, in August, 1881, obtained a specimen 
at the head of Water Canyon, just west of Socorro, N. Mex. Shortly

Tucson, Ariz., the one figured, and recently Dr. Thimothy E. Wilcox 
obtained it at Fort Huachuca in the same Territory. How far it extends 
south into Mexico we do not know. 

H((Mts. — Nothing is known about its habits except that it is a moun- 
tain species, and as it is our smallest crotalus, its bite is probably pro- 
portionately less dangerous than that of the others.

length they form brown cross bands; 5 upon the tail are black on a 
very light ground, as in C. atrox. Anteriorly there is an ill-defined 
series of spots which are opposite those of the dorsal line. A yellow 
band extends from the nasal plates anterior to the eye, involving from 
the ninth to the last superior labial. Superior to this is a brown band 
extending from the eye and ceasing on a line with the angle of the 
mouth. Some indistinct brown marks on the top of the head are 
arranged as follows: One on the inner border of each superciliary; 3 
posterior to these, the median short and broad; 4 further posterior, the 
median pair longer, diverging, reaching the neck. 

Variation. — The characters of scutellation hitherto relied upon for 
distinction betweeu C mitchellii and C. pyrrhns, viz, the breaking up of 
the large horizontal preocnlar of the former into 2 or more "loreals," does 
not hold, as shown by specimens more recently received. Mr. Charles 
Orcutt has sent us a specimen from the Colorado Desert, San Diego

County, Cal. (U. S. l^at. Mus., ^o. 10353), which is in all other respects 
almost identical with Belding's specimen from La Paz, Lower California, 
(No. 12625), but with the preocnlar on one side divided completely; on 
the other side, however, only with a faint indication of a division, while 
another from the same locality has it divided on both sides. These 
specimens I formerly identified as C. pyrrhus on this account, especially 
as the specimen of so-called G. pyrrhus from the Mojave Desert, Califor- 
nia, (Ko. 8069), has the preocnlar divided on both sides exactly as No, 
16501 and the left side of No. 16353. This specimen is, therefore, also 
a true C. mitchellii. The ftice scutellation of the type of C. pyrrhus (No. 
6606) is practically identical with that of Dr. Loew's specimen, from 
the Mojave Desert, and the only difference which I can see consists in 
the deep reddish color, a difference which can not be regarded as more 
than subspeciflc, if indeed it is more than an individual variation. In 
the California and Lower California specimens the ground color is iiale 
yellowish, almost white. 

While reading the proofs of this article 1 received a paper by Mr. 
John vanDenburgh (Proc. Cal. Acad. Sc. (2) iv, pp. 450-455), who, from 
an examination of 10 specimens in the California Academy from Lower 
California, comes to the same conclusion. In these the granules be- 
tween the nasal and the rostral occur indiscriminately, in one or two

series, aud lie shows conclusively that there is no difference between C. 
mitehellii and G. pyrrhns in so far as scutellation is concerned. He 
even goes so far as to assert that there is no color difference either, as 
two of his specimens were ^'decidedly red." I have myself seen speci- 
mens more or less suffused with vinaceous cinnamon or ochraceous- 
rufous, but the color is essentially different from the red of the type 
of C. pyrrhns, the status of which I, therefore, consider still unsettled. 

Geographical distribution. — Originally described from the Cape region 
of Lower California from a specimen collected by Xantus and later 
found in the same locality by Belding, it has but recently been discov-

highly colored form has been obtained, and that the suspicion seems 
well founded that it is but little more than an individual variation.

THE POISON OF THE POISONOUS SNAKES. 

The deadly Huid which from time immemorial has inspired dread and 
wonder in the human mind, not only by its fatal results but also by its 
mysterious apparent variability, early became a subject of study and 
speculation. More than two hundred years ago a lledi and a Charras 
published their observations on the European vipers and their poison, 
and all through the eighteenth century experiments with various ven- 
oms and their supposed antidotes were common. Some of the investi- 
gators of those early dates did good work, notably the Italian savant, 
Felix Eontana, who arrived at some results which, though contradicted 
and unheeded by many authors who (mght to have known better, have 
been fully corroborated by the latest investigations. 

Very little was discovered as to the real nature of the poison, how- 
ever, the definite constituency of which the older experimentors had 
no means of ascertaining. They could only know its grosser physical 
characteristics, for chemistry, and especially organic chemistry, had 
not yet reached such a development that it could tackle the intricate 
problems involved in such investigations. All that was gained was a 
prodigious number of so-called antidotes, most of which, in their turn, 
were declared infallible, though very few of them ever gained a gen- 
eral acceptance. In nearly all instances miraculous cures and surpris- 
ingly sudden recoveries were recorded, but, sad to say, in other cases 
even the best reputed remedies failed. It has remained for the last 
decades to ruthlessly annihilate the claims of most of these " antidotes." 

Prince Lucien Bonaparte, in 1843, seems to have been the first to 
make a chemical analysis of the viper poison, the result of his research 
being that it is albuminoid or proteid in its nature. The supposed 
active principle he called echidnine, or viperine. Less than twenty 
years after, Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia, commenced a series 
of analyses and experiments on the poison of the rattlesnake, giving 
a result similar to Bonaparte's, the corroboration of the albuminoid 
nature of the venomous substance, which in this case received the name 
crotaline. 



458 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

In the meantime organic clieraistry, physiology, and bacteriology 
made immense strides forward. The deadly work of the microbes 
began gradually to be understood, and their action in the process of 
putrefaction, as well as their role in many of the diseases which in their 
symptoms recalled those of snake poisoning, became known or 
suspected; the ptomaines and the leucomaines were discovered; and 
the chemists in their improved laboratories became enabled to deal 
with the proteids, to separate them, and to classify them. 

Xew theories as to the nature of the powerful poison were the 
necessary result; some thought the toxic property due to the presence 
of leucomaines, or alcaloid bodies ; others preferred to regard the fatal 
results as due to the work of some bacillus; others maintained its 
albuminoid origin; while others again regarded a combination of all 
these causes as the true solution of the question. 

While works dealing rationally and scientifically with this theme 
were few formerly and far between, one important discovery has fol- 
lowed closely upon another during the last ten years, and, even at the 
moment of publishing this, the writer is anxiously scanning each new 
number of the various journals, magazines, and proceedings, for fear 
that the latest mail may bring some important information that might 
make it necessary to modify or even rewrite this account, lest it should 
become antiquated even before it reaches the hand of the reader. 

Before giving a resume of these late discoveries, the methods of work 
by which they have been obtained will be briefly discussed. 

Attention is directed at the very outset to the fact that the poison 
of the various kinds of snakes (we speak only of that of the elapoid 
and viperoid snakes, as the iioison of the opisthoglyph snakes has not 
yet been investigated in the same manner) differs a great deal both in 
external or physical (qualities as well as in chemical composition, and 
that the poisoning occasioned by its injection often shows very marked 
symptomatic dift'erences. Within certain limits these differences are 
only those of degree, and it will be possible in the following to make 
the statements somewhat general, though in the details there may be 
slighter deviations according to the kind of snake we have to deal 
with. 

The first thing, of course, is to obtain the poison. The investiga- 
tors prefer the fresh secretion, if it can be had, for although dried or 
kept in alcohol the venom is not made innocuous, yet even a slight 
modification of its properties is to be avoided if possible. A sufficient 
number of live snakes is therefore highly desirable (Weir Mitchell at one 
time had at least one hundred in his laboratory), for the quantity of the 
fluid which each snake yields at anyone time is comparatively small. 

The methods for obtaining the venom are somewhat various. To 
kill the snake in order to extract it from the glands directly is a waste 
of material well to be avoided. The process of allowing it to bite into 
a soft material from which it is afterwards extracted is open to the 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 459 

objectiou that some of tlie fluid is lost, that it is unnecessarily brought 
into contact with substances which may aflect its nature more or 
less, and that it is not obtained in a concentrated state, as it must be 
washed out with distilled water. Dr. Weir Mitchell, after having seized 
the snake by the neck with the tongs or loop, forced a saucer between 
the jaws, into which the enraged animal would then bite vigorously, 
leaving a quantity of the poison on the saucer. Prof. Kaufman having 
experienced that the snake often breaks its teeth on such a hard sub- 
stance, or even refuses to bite, used a stick covered with rubber. The 
late Dr. C. S. Allen, of New York, for the same reasons covered the 
mouth of a wineglass or similar vessel with an animal membrane 
through which he induced the snake to strike the hollow teeth, the 
fluid being squirted into the glass. Dr. Paul B^rringer, of the Uni- 
versity of Virginia, has, it seems to me, improved upon this method by 
using several thicknesses of Altering paper, the object being to clean 
the fangs of possibly adhering saliva, and thus prevent the venom from 
coming in contact with foreign substances and the microbes inhabiting 
them. 

The substance thus obtained is a more or less yellowish, exception- 
ally colorless, transparent, sticky fluid, without any appreciable smell 
or taste, easily soluble in water, insoluble in absolute alcohol or ether. 
If vigorously shaken it becomes frothy. Examined under the micro- 
scope, epithelial cells and other impurities are found, as well certain 
albuminoid bodies resembling micro-organisms, but they do not respond 
to the dye tests for bacteria, nor are they multiplied by cultures. 
Drs. Mitchell and Keichert have demonstrated the i)reseiice of bacteria 
(/. c. pp. 6-7), but their own researches, as well as those of others, 
also show that they form no constant or essential accompaniment. 

Mitchell and Keichert (/. v. p. 137) injected large quantities of the 
pure micrococci from a sixth generation, in various manners, into 
rabbits, cats, i)igeons, etc., but no signs of any lesions resembling 
those of venom i^oisoning were observed. 

Drs. Wolfenden and Dawson Williams* endeavored to grow cobra 
venom in gelatine, " but without the slightest success;" Dr. A. Yiaud- 
Grand-Maraist states that "bacteria and other protoorganisms are 
seen to make their appearance when the solutions of the venom 
commence to undergo alterations, but only then." 

Fredet is said to have made similar observations, and Kaufniann| 
corroborates these statements from his own experiments. 

Another essential point is, that even boiling, unless continued for a 
long time, does not altogether destroy the poisonous qualities of the 
fluid. Mitchell found that the rattlesnake poison suflers a gradual 
mipairment of the toxicity of the venom increasing with the increase

of temperature, but that it is still toxic even wben boiled; Dr. Wall's 
experiments,* as quoted by Wolfenden, seem to show that cobra 
Ijoison resists the heat even better, for it is stated that prolonged 
application of heat (for two hours) at a high temperature at last 
destroys the toxicity of cobra venom, and that a dilute solution is 
more easily destroyed by heating than a strong, such a toxic dilute 
solution being destroyed after heating at lOfio C. for half an hour. 

When exposed to the air, even for a short time, the fluid poison takes 
up bacteria, and putrefaction proceeds particularly rapid if the venom 
be diluted with water. Continued alteration of this kind finally appears 
to destroy its toxicity. 

Excluded from the air, however, or preserved in pure alcohol or 
glycerine, the venom retains its properties for almost any length of 
time, as shown by the fact that a glycerine solution in the i^ossession of 
Dr. Mitchell for twenty years was still toxic. 

Dried and kept from atmospheric humidity it is equallj' permanent, 
twenty-two years not being able to alter it in the least. It is there- 
fore advisable to handle the dried isolated fangs of the large venomous 
snakes with caution. It dries somewhat like a gum or varnisli, and 
will crack and scale off in a similar manner. 

In discussing the chemical characteristics of snake poison, it is 
hardly necessary at the present day to refer to the now thoroughly 
refuted theories of the crystalline nature of any of its active toxic con- 
stituents. The last attempt (that of A. Wynter Blyth) t to prove the 
poisonous quality of the cobra venom to be due to a certain " cobric 
acid" was effectually disposed of by Dr. 11. Norris Wolfenden, | and 
need not detain us here. 

There are, on the other hand, still some physiologists who are not 
satisfied that the negative results obtained by Prof. Wolcott Gibbs at 
the request of Drs. Mitchell and lieichert in their search for alkaloids in 
the venom of the rattlesnake are absolute conclusive, in view of Dr. 
Armand Gautier's positive determination of leucomaines or alkaloids 
derived from living protoplasm in snake poison. In his much discussed 
article, " Sur les alcaloides derives de la destruction bacterienne ou 
physiologique des tissus animaux,"§ Gautier positively affirmed his 
assertion of 1881 (Bull. Ac. Med., Taris (2 ser.), x, 1881, pp. 947-053, 
and discussion following, pp. 053-9.j8) that from the venom of a Trigo- 
noceplialus^ and particularly from that of the cobra, he had been able 
to extract a small quantity of matter belonging to the organic alkalis. 
From the cobra poison he prepared two new alkaloids, which, among

other peculiarities, possessed tbe property of immediately precipitating 
Prussian blue wlien treated successively with ferrocyauide of potassium 
and the ferric salts. He expressly remarks, however, that these alka- 
loids do not constitute the most dangerous part of the venom, which 
he asserts is of a nitrogenous nature. They seem chiefly to stupify, 
but are not necessarily fiital. In the course of the discussion he fur- 
ther emi)hasized the fact that these leucomames in the normal state of 
the tissues only occur in minimal proportions {toni. cif. p. 431), 

Other careful investigations simultaneous with and later than tliose 
of Prof. Gibbs have fully substantiated the claim that theleucomaiues 
play no role in the poisoning, and that, if present, they form no essen- 
tial part of the venom. Dr. Wolfenden {loc. cit. p. 335) made examina- 
tions of cobra venom by the Stas-Otto method for ptomaine, or alkaloid, 
in three different instances, but did not succeed in linding the slightest 
trace of any such body. There was neither trace of fixed nor volatile 
alkaloid, the residues were noncrystalline and, moreover, nontoxic, and 
gave none of the alkaloidal test reactions. 

Prof. Gautier, as I have already intimated, insisted that the toxic 
constituent of the venom is of a different nature. The researches of 
the last ten years have proved beyond a shadow of doubt their proteid 
nature, and that Bonaparte was correct when, in 1843, he referred to it 
as an albuminoid. 

The achievements during the last decade in the study of the chem- 
istry of snake venoms have been of such a nature, are so recent, and 
even now progressing, that the best way to record them is to treat them 
historically and chronologically. 

The tirst progressive step was taken when, in 1883, Dr. S. Weir 
Mitchell and E. T. Reichert, of Philadelphia, laid before the National 
Academy a preliminary report on the results of studies, which, after a 
lapse of twenty years, Dr. Mitchell had resumed. He had in some way 
become convinced that the complexity of the symptoms in snake 
poisoning could not be the result of a single simple constituent, but 
that they might be explained by the assumption of a similarly complex 
nature of the albuminoid body, the crotaline, previously thought to be 
simple. Dr. Mitchell, in a later popular article,* has given a clear and 
interesting insight in the mental process Avhich led to the important 
discovery and the laboratory processes by which it was demonstrated, 
from which vvc make the following abstracts: 

When I first studied tliis strange poison I thought of it as a single albuminous 
body. As such it had always been regarded since it had been proved by Priuco 
Bonaparte to belong to the albuiuens. When once I chanced to think that venom 
might be a complex lluid, holding in solution more than one poison, reasons for such 
a belief multiplied^ and so excited my interest that, in 1882, Avith Prof. Eeichert's 
aid, I began to put my theory to the sharp test of experiment. To prove in the 
outside laboratory what the inside mental laboratory has comfortably settled is not 
always easy, and many months of careful research were reijuired before the answer

462 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

came to us. I Avill try to make clear our methods and results. When a little of the 
venom is placed in sutticient water it dissolves readily. If now we heat the solution 
a coagulation takes place, just such as happens when white of egg hardens on boil- 
ing. If by means of a filter we separate this substance, clotted by heat, it is found 
to be mnocuous. The clear fluid which passes through the filter is, however, pois- 
onous, but does not cause much local effect. As a whole the poison has been damaged 
by heat, presumably becauseone or more of its ingredients had been injured by heat. 
The next ste]) is to learn if the substance made solid and inert by boiling can not be 
separated in some other way and in such a form as will leave it also poisonous. 

Allsoluble substances are divisible into two classes, one of which will pass through 
an animal membrane into a current of pure water, and one of which will not. Those 
which can so pass are said to be dialysable, and the filter is known as a dialyser, and 
the process is called " dialysis." We disolve some of the poison in water and put it 
in an inverted funnel, the Avide mouth of which, being covered with a thin animal 
membrane is placed in distilled Avater. Under these circumstances the water goes 
through the membrane, and dilutes the lluid above it and certain substances pass out 
to the water. 

The matter which thus finds its way out to the water is said to be dialysable. 
When examined it proves to be poisonous — to be uncoagulable by heat, and to be the 
same as the matterleft unaltered when we boil the diluted poison for a few moments. 
This substance resembles the albuminous matter which is formed when gastric juice 
digests white of egg, and as the material so obtained is called peptone, we name our 
product wliioh jiassed through the dialyser to water venom peptone. 

As the thinner Avater outers the dialyser and the peptone goes out within the vessel 
there falls duAvn a white substance, which is easily redissolved if Ave add a little com- 
mon salt. It falls out of solution because the salts belonging to A-euom and Avhich 
keep the white matter dissolved are, like all saline substances, dialysable and i)ass 
out along Avith the peptone. This white precipitate has certain likenesses to the 
albuminous bodies known as globulin, and of which there are seA'eral kinds in our 
bodies. That Avhich falls out of the solution of venom we named venom globuVni. 

The final results of Mitchell's and Eeichert's investigations were 
embodied in a fine quarto volume published by the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution in 188G as one of its " Contributions to Knowledge " under the 
title "Researches upon the Venoms of Poisonous Serpents," to which 
we must refer the reader for details. 

There are in those results, with regard to the chemical nature of the 
venom, two points, however, to which I will call particular attention as 
beingof a fundamental nature, and which the reader must keep steadily 
in mind if he wishes to understand the present status of the question, 
viz, first that the crotalus poison, as well as the cobra venom, consists 
of several proteids, two of which are preponderating, although present 
in a varying degree. One of these, the globulin, is not dialysable; the 
other proteid, which passes through the membrane of the diaylser, 
Mitchell referred to the peptones, though possibly it belongs to another 
class, as will be seen later on. 

The second point is that these two chief constituents are present in 
different proportions in the various i:>oisons, the globulin occurring 
mostly in the crotalid snakes, but only in a minimal quantity in the 
cobra. This difference in the composition of the venoms corresponds 
markedly with the difference in the symptoms accompanying poisoning 
by the Grotalidw (and the nearly related Viperidcv) on the one hand, and 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 463 

by the Xajidw or cobras (and the nearly rehited IJlapid(v) on the other, 
as will be shown farther on, 

Simultaneonsly with Mitchell and Keichert's report there appeared in 
England a couple ofartides by ])r. E. Norris Wolfeiiden of a vscarcely 
less import,he, however, having had the benefit of the preliminary report 
by his American precursors. He published them in the Cambridge 
Journal of Physiology under the common title " On the nature and 
action of tlie venom of poisonous snakes," ths first one being a treatise 
on "The Venou) of tlie Indian Oobra, Naja trijntdians,^^ the second "A 
Note upon the Venom of tlie Indian Yiper, Dahoia russelii.^^ 

Wolfenden's results are in the main the same as those of Mitchell and 
Eeichert, Pursuing a different method of subdividing the proteids there 
are some differences in detail, which mean very little so far as the general 
result is concerned, but there is also one diangreement as to the nature 
and the nomenclature of the dialyzable portion. Mitchell referred it, 
as Ave have seen, to the peptones, but Wolfenden maintains that it can 
not possibly be a peptone since it is precipitated by acetic acid and 
potassic ferrocyanide. He, on the other hand, refers it to thealbumoses, 
and in his analysis of the daboia poison he names it '•'■alhumose or syn- 
to)iiny This is therefcrepractically the same as Mitchell's renompeptone. 

Wolfenden found in the ^'obra an overwhelming quantity of the 
globulin, but scarcely any albumose; in the daboia, on the other- 
hand besides the globulin, a certain quantity, proportions not given, of 
^'albumose or syutonin," which seems to be more difficult to dialyze than 
the crotalus i^roteid of the same class. As will be seen, MitchelFs con- 
clusions were amply and independently confirmed. 

The very latest studies of the chemical nature of the venom are those 
of Dr. C. J. Martin and Mr. J. M'Garvie Smith, of Sydney, Australia, 
who have successfully investigated the poison of the Australian black 
snake, Pseudechis porphyriacus, a very dangerous snake related to the 
Indian cobra.* Tbeir results corroborate in the main those of their 
predecessors, and in their endeavor to identify the various proteids 
which constitute the venom, they successfully separated three proteids, 
viz., "one an albumin, and the other two albumoses. The albumiu is 
not virulent, but the two albumoses (corresponding to proto and hetero- 
albumoses of Kiihne) are extremely poisonous. They each have the 
same physiological action and this is the same as that produced by the 
venom itself." 

It is one of the great merits of Mitchell and Eeichert's work that 
they undertook to test directly upon the venom the numerous chemical 
antidotes which from time to time have been suggested or from their 
known action on similar substances seemed to give promise of favorable 
results. It was found that many are worthless, that in fact only a few

exert such an iutiueuce upon tlie venom as to make them available as 
local antidotes. We emphasize local, because from the very nature of 
the poison as an albuminoid and consequently chemically closely related 
to normal constituents of the blood, there can be no chemical antidote 
which after the introduction of the venom into the circulation would 
be able to destroy the poison without also destroying the blood itself 

I wish to call attention here to the fact that Mitchell repeatedly 
makes distinction between the poisoning resulting' in death within a 
few hours and when it is slower in coming. He found that in the most 
rapid poisoning there is frequently nothing appreciable to the naked 
eye beyond the slight local lesion, or here and there minute capillary 
hemorrhages, when death has been delayed beyond a minute ; while in 
examples of chronic poisoning, both the local and the systemic changes 
are enormously more extensive. This distinction between local and 
systemic changes is one of considerable importance, since the rational 
treatment of any given case hinges upon the full understanding of this 
point. 

Only two years pass, and another very important contribution to our 
knowledge of the intricate question of snake poison was published, 
this time by a llussian, ])r. E. A. Feoktistow, the same whose work on 
the rattle of the rattlesnake we have already had the occasion to quote 
In 1888 he issued a doctor dissertation with the following title: Expe- 
rimentelle Ilntersuchungen iiber Schlaugengift,* based upon about 400 
experiments with the fresh venom from about 200 specimens belonging 
to several species of vipers and Crotalus dnrissus. His researches 
cover to a great extent those of Mitchell and Eeichert. In some cases 
the disagreement between the results of these eminent students is 
highly perplexing; for instance, in regard to the etfect of the venom 
upon the blood and the blood vessels. The disagreement as to the 
causes of death as formulated by Mitchell and Eeichert, on one hand, 
and Feoktistow on the other, also seems startling at tirst, for the former 
conclude that death occurs through paralysis of the respiratory cen- 
ters, paralysis of the heart, hemorrhages in the medulla, or possibly 
through the inability of the iDrofoundly altered red corpuscles to per- 
form their functions, and they positively assert that the direct action 
of the venom upon the nervous system, save as concerns the paralysis 
of the respiratory centers, is of but little importance, while Feoktistow 
with equal positiveness concludes that the snake venom is a nerve 
poison i)ar excellence, which i^aralyzes the vaso-motor center, and in 
large doses the respiratory center as well. It is im])ossible for us here 
to carry out a comiiarative analysis of the two works, but I think it 
will be found that the disagreement between these authors is more 
apparent than real, and that it consists more in the interpretation of

the phenomena than in the results of the experiments themselves. But 
it would be a thankful task for an experienced physiologist to correlate 
all the facts, to eliminate possible errors, to reexperiment where there 
may be doubt as to the facts, and to weigh the evidence impartially 
for and against the various explauations. His work would not have 
to be contined to the works already mentioned, for the very next year 
there appeared another independent treatise of considerable importance. 
In 1889 the French Academy of Medicine, in Paris, awarded the 
Orfila prize for 1888 to M. Kaufmann, professor of physiology at the 
veterinary school at Alfort, in recognition of his studies of the venom 
of the common viper of France, Vipera asjns* Kaufmann's work is for 
the greater part a study of the action of the poison of the viper upon 
the nerves, the circulation, and the tissues, and of certain chemical 
antidotes upon the venom. It corroborates that of his predecessors,, 
and shows the similarity of action of the viper venom to the crotalus. 
venom, but it also contains several valuable new observations and new 
discoveries. 

I have said that Mitchell has already called attention to the differ- 
ence between the rapid and slow.poisoning. Feoktistow made similar 
observations, but Kaufmann has emphasized it still more, and in part 
based his study upon this difference. His experiments, to a greater 
extent than his predecessors', were separately directed upon ascertain- 
ing the results of the injection of the venom directly into the circula- 
tion and those following only its hypodermic application to the tissues. 
The results deserve a closer examination here. 

Injected directly into the veins of the animals experimented upon, 
the venom produces its effects with almost lightning rapidity, consist- 
ing in nervous, circulatory, respiratory, and digestive disturbances. 
The nervous disturbances consist of a primary excitation of very short 
duration, followed by a drowsiness, which lasts until death,- the intel- 
lectual foculties are not impaired for a long while, but the general sensi- 
bility, as well as the voluntary and reflex movements, are rapidly 
affected. The circulatory disturbances consist in an enormous lowering 
of the arterial tension, due to a considerable vascular dilatation, princi- 
pally in the abdominal digestive viscera 5 in a considerable acceleration 
of the pulse, and in a very great feebleness of the blood waves propelled 
by the heart. The respiration and calorification do not undergo pro- 
found alterations, only a slight diminution of their activity being 
observed. The conclusion is reached that the death whicli follows the 
introduction of the venom into the circulation must be attributed to 
gastrointestinal apoplexy and the stupefying action exercised directly 
upon the nervous system. This is in confirmation of Feoktistow's 
views. 

The hypodermic injections produce both general systemic effects 
identical with the ab ove, due to the absorption of the poison into the

circulation, and local effects wliicli develop at the point of injection 
and in tbe adjoining tissues. These local lesions consist in a more or 
less intense swelling, and in a purple or black discoloration produced 
by extravasation of blood and serum in the tissues allected by the 
venom. The death, which is due to the direct absorption of the venom, 
arrives very rapidly, and the characteristic internal hemorrhages are 
observed; the death, however, which is the consequence of the infec- 
tion of local origin is slower, and the ordinary internal lesions are not 
found, but, on tlie contrary, considerable local alterations. The danger 
from the injection varies with the part of the body inoculated; thus 
injections of venom made on the inner side of the thighs or on the nose 
are very dangerous; those practiced on the side of the thorax muscles 
less so. The micro-organisms accompanying the local lesions are only 
accidental and secondary productions; they find excellent conditions 
for their propagation and multiplication in the altered or mortified 
tissue, but inoculated into healthy animals they do not produce the 
specific effects of the venom. After the injection under the skin, the 
poison is slowly diffused in the adjoining tissues and determines their 
progressive alteration without itself being altered in any way, for the 
venom can be traced in its full activity in the local lesions, and serum 
taken from the altered tissues, if injected into healthy animals, devel- 
ops the ordinary effects of the venom; this serum, consequently, con- 
tains a certain quantity of active venom. On the other hand, venom 
does not accumulate in an appreciable quantity neither in the liver, the 
kidneys, nor the nervous centers, as serum taken from these tissues 
has remained inactive in animals inoculated with it. 

Mit(;hell and Keichert had confirmed the destructive action of certain 
chemicals upon the venom and discovered others of similar action, 
notably permanganate of potassium, ferric chloride, iodine and bromine. 
To these Kaufmann adds chromic acid, which he highly recommends as 
a remedy for the local lesions. 

The fact that chromic acid in a solution of 1 to 100 is one of the 
reagents which produces the greatest precipitate in the venom, besides 
being an energetic oxidizer, led Prof. Kaufmann to institute a series of 
very interesting experiments with it, which only lack of space prevents 
me from reproducing here in their entirety. Suffice it to say that they 
prove conclusively the potent and beneficent action of the chromic acid, 
not only when it is injected mixed with the venom, but also when intro- 
duced some time after the poisoning. The last experiment of the series 
(Xo. XXXV) is very instructive. Four dogs of about equal size were 
inoculated on the inner side of the thigh with two drops of fresh viper 
venom obtained immediately before the injection. One was left with- 
out further treatment, the others had injected in the puncture, five 
minutes after, respectively 1:100 solutions of chromic acid, perman- 
ganate of potassium, and bichoride of mercury. The following morning 
all showed local congestions, and in the evening of that day the dog

Avhick had received uo remediaiy iujectiou died. Ou the third day in 
the one treated with chromic acid the local congestion was red, in ihe 
other two o-dematons and blackish. On the fonrth day the reddening 
had almost disappeared in tlie former and no ulceration was to be 
observed; m the dog- treated with permanganate the discoloration had 
also nearly disappeared, but there was a large ulcer, while the one treated 
with bichloride of mercury had not even improved so much. They after- 
wards all fully recovered. Kaufmann sums up the result of this experi- 
ment as follows: This experiment demonstrates that the three ao-ents 
employed have preserved the animals from death; the bichloride has 
the inconvenience of producing a caustic action, forming a scar and a 
wound long to heal; the permanganate, although less destructive, also 
leaves a wound which takes long time in scarifying, while the chromic 
acid most completely checked the action of venom without occasioning 
any cauterization or ulceration. 

The point essentially proved by the above experiment is the relative 
superiority of the chromic acid over the permanganate and the bichlo- 
ride ot mercury. 

Three years later. Dr. Albert Calmette, surgeon of the first class of 
the colonial medical staff and director of the bacteriological institute 
at Saigon, Cochin China, published a similar series of experiments* 
with a solution of chloride of gold, upon the venom of the cobra He 
chums to have secured quite a success in saving the animals experi- 
mented upon, the experiments being conducted very much like those of 
Kaufmann, by injection of the venom mixed with the chemical, and by 
injecting them separately, the latter as late as five minutes after the 
fonner. Very li, tie can be gathered from his experiments as to the 
efficacy of the chloride of gold m counteracting the local disturbances 
as compared with that of chromic acid, because of the slight local 
eliects ot the cobra venom. Whether the chloride of gold in this respect 
IS the ecpial of the chromic acid is therefore doubtful, although from the 
tacts that It forms an insoluble precipitate with the venom and that its 
cauterizing effect is but slight, it may probably be inferred that there 
IS bat little difference between them. 

Dr. Calmette has recently t recommended a solution (1 :11) of chloride 
of lime as superior to the chloride of gold, it being effective up to fifty 
minutes with rabbits which would otherwise have died in two hours 

Unfortmiately for Dr. Calmette's claim for the efficacy ot chloride of 
gold, an English physiologist, J undertook a series of similar experi- 
ments with an entirely different result. From his criticism it would

468 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

by injection of a chemical destroyer at the ^vound is chimerical, but 
siich a conclusion, it seems to me, ^v•ould be premature to say the least 
It is true that the introductiou and non-efficacy of the venom mixed 
with the chemical proves nothing as being practically no venom; it is 
also true that the introduction of the chemical live minutes after the 
bite would be of but little practical use if five minutes were the extreme 
limit for its beneficial action. It is also undoubtedly true that even 
withiu this time it is not always capable of, alone and unassisted, to 
save the life of the patient. On the other hand, it must not be for- 
gotten that the above experiments had been chiefly theoretical, and 
that no means were taken to assist the remedy experimented with. It 
is rather sinjiular that the experimenters should not have extended 
their experiments somewhat, and it is particularly surprising that those 
testing the efficacy of the local treatment should not have introduced 
the use of ligatures to a greater extent. By thus confining the action 
of the poison to the neighborhood of the point of inoculation the 
experimenter would probably have been able to extend the period 
within which the chemical agent showed itself beneficent considerably 
beyond the five minutes. I think this is a point worthy of consider- 
ation by those contemplating future experiments with local chemical 

remedies. 

After the important discoveries of Mitchell and Eeichert as to the 
multiple chemical composition of the snake poisons, it was but nat- 
ural that the attention of the searchers for remedies was principally 
drawn in the direction of looking for local chemical destroyers. It was 
also natural that these researches should prevail in those countries in 
which the crotalids and the vipers predominate, because of the local 
destructiveness of the poison of these snakes. But the other side was, 
fortunately, not lost sight of, and the search for remedies to counteract 
the poison after it has reached the circulation, was naturally carried 
on most vigorously in the home of the najid and elapid snakes, m 
India and Australia. 

Mitchell had already pointed out the hopelessness of finding a chem- 
ical which, introduced into the veins, would be able to destroy the 
poison without also destroying the blood. The only rational line of 
research would be to discover such remedies as would, to use Mitchell's 
words, ^^ oppose the actions of venom upon the most vulnerable parts of 
the system," or, as he calls them, "physiological antagonists." It will 
be remembered that Mitchell and Eeichert came to the conclusion that 
" there can be no question, however, that the respiratory centers are 
the parts of the system most vulnerable to venom, and that death is 
most commonly due to their paralysis." Although, according to them, 
paralysis of the heart generally only plays a secondary role in the case 
of snake poisoning, yet the cardiac power is sensibly enfeebled, especi- 
ally in the early stage. The kind of remedies to be looked for would 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 469 

consequently be such as will stimulate the vital functions of respiration 
and circulation. 

The remedy which to them seemed to hohl forth the greatest promise 
of success was alcohol, a stimulant the effects of which are well known ; 
which IS, moreover, usually readily at hand, and which has been exten- 
sively tried for the purpose. It has been used both by the layman and 
the practitioner, often with apparent success, and its application has 
undoubtedly saved many a life. On the other hand, reports are numer- 
ous ot patients having died which were under the influence of liquor 
when bitten, or to whom whisky was afterwards administered. But it 
is safe to say that in most of these cases the alcohol had been taken in 
excess so as to depress instead of stimulate the vital functions. It 
can not be emphasized too much, or too often, that intoxication, so far 
from helping the cure, helps the poison, and that persons having been 
made intoxicated beyond excitement, when under treatment for snake 
bite, and yet recovered, have so recovered not from the treatment but 
in spite of It. It should also be remembered that the alcohol has no 
beneficent direct action upon the venom ; on the contrary, applied 
locally or intravenously, it seems to add to the virulence of the poison 
Notwithstanding all that has been written about the utter uselessness 
of ammonia, we see still occasionally in medical literature reports from 
physicians who have obtained cures in spite of its application. Injected 
directly, it is worse than useless. It should not at this late date be 
necessary to fill pages m order to emphasize this fact, which has been 
conclusively demonstrated by all rational experiments from the time of 
Fontaua to that of Mitchell and the other physiologists of to-day 
Internally, as a stimulant, it has also been shown to be much inferior to 
alcohol. The radical defect of ammonia in severe cases consists in the 
fact that It increases the arterial pressure, thus aiding the poison in 
producing the internal hemorrhages. 

The remedy which has come prominently to the front during the last 
five years, however, and wliich really seems to come up to all reason- 
able expectation, is a poison scarcely less terrible than the snake venom 
Itself, VIZ, strychnine. The theory upon which the application of this 
drug has been based is, on the one hand, that the snake poison acts as 
a specific nerve poison, depressing and more or less suspending the 
luuctiou of the motor nerve centers throughout the body without inter- 
fering with the structure of the nerve cells, and, on the other, that the 
physiological action of strychnine upon the same organs is diamet- 
rically opposed to the action of the venom, or, in brief, that ^' strychnine 
IS the exact antithesis of snake poison in its action." To use the words 
of the main advocate of strychnine as an antidote : 

WhiJ.st suake poison turns off the motor batteries and reduces the volume and force 
ot motor-nerve currents, strychnine, Avheu following it as an antidote, turns them 
on again, acting with the unerring certainty of a chemical test, if admnistered in 
sufficient quanUty. Purely physiological in its action, it neutralizes the effects of the 



470 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

suake poisou, aiicl aunouuces, by unmistakable symptoms, when it has accomplished 
this task, and wonld, if continued, become a poison itself. Previous to this announce- 
ment its poisonous action is completely neutralized by the suake poison, and the lat- 
ter would therefore be equally as efficacious in strychnine poisoning as strychnine 
is in snake poisoning.* 

I am not aware tbat this te.st lias beeu applied, but I may here call 
attention to the fact tbat Dr. A. O. Ameden, of Glens Falls, X. Y., by a 
similar train of reasoning, was led to apply rattlesnake poison to a case 
of tetanus apparently with most signal success, t 

It seems that the great discovery of strychnine as the antidote par 
excellence was barely missed by Dr. Louis Lanszweert, who in 187 L 
published a short article, "Arseniate of Strychnia: Xew Antidote to 
the Poison of Snakes," t in which he somewhat vaguely refers to hve 
cases successfully treated by him in San Francisco, as well as to some 
equally successful experiments made by him in Paris upon rabbits. 
It is evident that he regarded the arsenic as the antidote, and it is not 
at all clear why he added the strychnine, except that by this addition 
he obtained "a more readily soluble substance than ar.senious acid." 
It is now well known that arsenic is no specitic antidote, and it seems 
almost certain that the success of Dr. Lanszweert's treatment was due 
to the strychnine. From what I have shown above, Dr. Ameden, in 
1883, came also dangerously near making the same discovery. 

It has recently been claimed that Dr. John Shortt, of India, as early 
as 1808 experimented with strychnine, but that it was given up on 
account of the failure of experiments upon animals. Dr. Shortt\s eftbrts 
may possibly have been published in the unprofessional local press; 
but in 18G8 as well as in 1870 he recommended liquor potassa? as an 
antidote, without mentioning strychnine. The honor of the discovery 
can, tlierefore, not be claimed for him. 

This was reserved, however, to a then obscure Australian practi- 
tioner. Dr. A, Mueller, of Yackandandah, Victoria, who in 1888, in the 
most positive mannner, claimed that he had practically proved strych. 
nine to be the specific antidote by the success of his cures, and to have 
demonstrated the scientific correctness of the theory by accounting 
satisfactorily for all the i)henomena observable in connection with the 
subject. 

Dr. Mueller's discovery, which was published in a series of articles 
in the Australasian Medical Gazette, in Sydney,§ at once started a vig- 
orous, sometimes even acrimonious, discussion in Australia, and the

strychniue was most earnestly tested and enthusiastically indorsed by 
Dr. Mueller's followers, while his antagonists of the old school went to 
the other extreme of denouncing the subcutaneous injection of the 
drug in snake venom cases as being of equal value to so much water. 
The medical journals of the colonies from that time on are full of the 
controversy, which soon spread to India. 

The opposition gleefully recorded several cases of death in spite of 
the administration of strychnine. In addition they clamored for a 
series of experiments upon animals by which the theory could be 
" scientifically " tested, at the same time pointing out that the exi)eri- 
ments which had so far been undertaken did not seem to support Dr. 
Mueller's contention. 

These criticisms Dr. Mueller has met by explaining in an apparently 
satisfactory manner why in the fatal cases reported the treatment had 
failed, it being mostly due to the fact that not enough strychnine had 
been administered. As to the experiments on animals, it was con- 
tended that the physiological effects of strychnine upon man and the 
various kind of test animals is so different that no safe conclusions 
can be drawn, and tliat, moreover, the numerous tests afforded by the 
cases of human beings having been bitten and saved from death by 
the administration of the strychnine is the best possible proof of its 
efficiency. 

From an article recently published (Australas. Med. Gaz., Sydney, 
XII, December 15, 1893, pp. 401-403) it will be seen that the opposition 
to the strychnine treatment is on the wane and that the Governments 
of Australia and India are alive to the importance of Dr. Mueller's dis- 
covery. The latter, in his recent book,* furthermore states that he 
knows from good authority that Sir Joseph Fayer, the president of the 
medical board at the India ofiBce, the celebrated authority on snake 
poison, and author of the monumental work "The Thanatoj)hidia of 
India," has recommended to the English Government the adoption of 
the strychnine treatment of snake bite in India. It is but fair in a 
case like this to render the results of Dr. ^Mueller's discovery in his 
own words. Hence the following quotations from his book, which I 
have deemed it essential, should be as full as practicable, especially 
since his work has so far received but little attention in this country: 

It is self-evident from precediug statemeuts that in the treatment of snake bite 
with strychnine the ordinary doses must be greatly exceeded, and that its adminis- 
tration must be continued, even if the total quantity injected within an hour or two 
amounts to what in the absence of snake poison would be a dangerous, if not a fatal, 
dose. Timidity in handling the drug is fraught with far more danger than a bold 
and fearless use of it. The few failures among its numerous successes recorded 
during the last four years in Australia were nearly all traceable to the antulote not 
having been injected in sufficient quantity. Even slight tetanic convulsions, which 
were noticed in a few cases, invariably passed off quickly. It should be borne in 
mind that of the two poisons warring with each other, that of the snake is by far 

"Snake Poison and its Action. Sydney, 1893, p. 70. 



472 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

the most insidious and dangerous one, more especially in its effects on the vaso- 
motor centers. The latter are wrought very insidiously and where they predom- 
inate rec^uire the most energetic use of the antidote; for whilst the timid practi- 
tioner, after injecting as much strychnine as he deems safe, stands idly by waiting 
for its effects, the snake virus, not checked by a siititlcient quantity of it, continues 
its baneful work, drawing the blood mass into the paralyzed abdominal veins, aud 
finally, by arrested heart action, bringing on sudden collapse. In such cases even 
some tetanic convulsions are of little danger and may actually be necessary to o\er- 
come the paralysis of the splanchnicus and with it that of the other vaso-motor 
centers. 

Whilst then it must be laid down as a principle that the antidote should be 
administered freely and without regard to the quantity that may be required to 
develop symptoms of its own physiological action, the doses in which it is injected 
and the intervals between them must be left to the practitioner's judgment, as they 
depend in every case on the (quantity of snake poison a1)8orbed, the time elapsed 
since its inception and the corresponding greater or lesser urgency of the symptoms. 
If the latter denote a large dose to have been imparted and it has been m the system 
for hours, delay is dangerous and nothing less than 16 minims of liq. strychuiie P. B., 
in A-ery urgent cases even 20 to 25 minims, should be injected to any person over 15 
years of age. Even children may re<]uire these large doses, as they are determined 
by the quantity of the poison they have to counteract and are kept in check by it. 
The action of the antidote is so prompt and decisive that not more than fifteen to 
twenty minutes need to elapse after the first injection before further measures can 
be decided on. If the poisoning symptoms show no abatement by that time, a second 
injection of the same strength should be made promptly, and unless after it a 
decided improvement is preceptible, a third one after the same interval. As the 
action of strychnine when applied as antidote is not cumulative, no fear need to be 
entertained of violent efi'ects breaking out after these doses repeated at short 
intervals. * * * 

If under the influence of these large doses the symptoms abate, or if the latter are 
comparatively mild from the first, smaller doses of strychnine should be injected, say 
from one-fifteenth to one-tenth of a grain, but under all circumstances the rule that 
distinct strychnia symptoms must be produced before the injections are discontinued 
should never be departed from. This rule is a perfectly safe one for its observance 
entails no danger, a few muscular spasms or even slight tetanic convulsions being 
easily subdued and harmless as compared with that most insidious condition exem- 
plified in case No. 1, cited below, the first-one treated with strychnine by the writer, 
Avho, having no experience in the treatment, did not administer quite enough 
strychnine. The patient, after apparently recovering from a moribund condition 
and being able to walk and even to mount a hoi'se, remained partly under the 
infinences of the poison and succumbed to it during sleep, when, according to subse- 
quent experience, one more injection would have saved him. 

The tendency to relapses is always great when much snake poison has been 
absorbed. Apparently yielding to the antidote for a time, the insidious venom, after 
a shorter or longer interval during which it appears to have been conquered, all at 
once reasserts its presence, and has to be met by such fresh injections, regardless of 
the quantity of strychnine previously administered, but the amount required in 
most relapses is not a large one. 

In speaking of the applicability of the treatment to bites of snakes 
with longer fangs antl more powerful venom than those of Australia, 
he concludes as follows : 

In those cases only where the long fangs of these snakes perforate into a vein 
and a large quantity of venom injected into the blood stream overpowers the nerve 
centers so as make death imnunent, if not almost instantaneous, the subcutaneous

injections may be found of little use. Here intravenous injections of half a grain 
and even 1 grain doses would appear to be indicated, and might yet fan the liame 
of life afresh, even when respiration and pulse at wrist have already ceased. We 
have seen both these functions extinct in Australia and restored by comparatively 
small doses of the antidote, and can see no reason why a more energetic use of it 
should not restore them in India. 

Dr. Mueller uext enumerates in detail 50 cases, only 2 from his own 
practice, some of them very remarkable and several, as it seems, quite 
conclusive, but as none of these cases were caused by snakes directly 
related to our American poisonous serpents, except to the Elajndce, it is 
not thought necessary to reprint any of them here. The first case 
reported is the one alluded to above, the first case treated by Dr. 
Mueller with strychnine. The case ended fatally. 

The death of the unfortunate lad, however, has saved some lives since. It taught 
the writer the lesson never to trust to the apparent success of the antidote until it 
shows distinct signs of its own physiological action, and even then to watch his 
patients carefully for the first twenty-four hours, and let them sleep for short periods 
onlj- 

The cases from India reported by Dr. Banerjee, also reprinted in the 
book, have been assailed as unreliable, but since the publication of the 
book others have been recorded in the Indian Medical Gazette, for 1S93, 
and reprinted in the Australasian Medical Gazette (see, for instance, 
two in Vol. XIII, January lo, 1894), which seem to indicate a success for 
the treatment in India as great as in Australia. 

An entire chapter is devoted to the unsuccessful cases, which are 
analyzed and explained. The last one Dr. Mueller finds to convey a 
new lesson even to him, as he draws from it the conclusion that the 
antidote can only be relied on within the first twenty-four hours after 
the bite. 

It can not for a moment be supposed that the discovery of the strych- 
nine treatment will be accepted as the final settlement of the question 
of a physiological antidote. As a matter of fact, our knowledge of the 
physiological action of the various venoms is as yet but imperfect, and 
the physiological properties of many of the drugs which may be called 
to play a role are not better known. Experiments are still carried on, 
but as no definite results have as yet been obtained we shall only men- 
tion them very briefly. 

In 1888, Dr. H. 0. Yarrow published a scries of articles in Foi^est 
and Stream concerning "Snake bite and its Antidote."* In the intro- 
duction he gives an interesting historical sketch of the search for anti- 
dotes, and then submits in detail a series of experiments of his own, 
among which I wish to call special attention to those with jaborandi, 
or its alkaloids pilocarpine and jaborine, the use of which was first

introduced, it seems, by the French physician, Dr. Josso. * Rabbits 
and fowls were inoculated with crotalus poison and treated with extr. 
jaborandi, both hypodermically and in the stomach. It appears that 
the rabbits recovered even from a fourfold lethal dose of the venom, 
while in the fowls the etfect of the antidote was less marked, as it was 
only capable of prolonging- but not saving life. 

Another drug which it might possibly pay to experiment with is 
stropltanthus, as suggested by Dr. T. L. Bancroft, of Australia. In 
short, there is yet a wide field open for the investigators. 

The beneficial effects of the jaborandi are probably to be ascribed to 
the influence of this drug both upon the skin and the liver, and this 
fact opens up another question which must be taken into consideration 
before we conclude this chapter, viz, the question as to the way in 
which the poison is eliminated by the system; for it is plain from all 
that we now know of the physiology of the case that when the poison 
has once entered into the circulation all that can be done in this direc- 
tion is to counteract its immediate effect upon the nerve centers, thus 
prolonging life and enabling the system to throw off the poison. Any 
remedy that would assist in doing so would be a distinct help. But in 
order to find such a remedy it is necessary to know exactly how the 
poison is finally got rid of. Unfortunately, this is a point upon which 
no conclusive studies have been made. As already mentioned, experi 
ments have been made which go to show the presence of the venom in 
the liver, kidneys, etc., although in but small quantity. I am not 
aware that there has been made any extended experiments to ascertain 
the presence of the poison in the perspiration, a poiut well worth 
investigation in view of the fact that there are cases of severe systemic 
poisoning which have been reported t cured simply by means of pro- 
fuse perspiration. Inoculation of urine of the bitten subject has been 
occasionally undertaken to test the presence of venom, and fatal results 
have been reported, but the experiments have not been conducted in 
such a way as to satisfy us that death was not due to the ptomaines 
contained in the urine. 

However, Feoktistow found, in addition, gross anatomical changes in 
the kidneys of poisoned cats, and Dr. Mueller has recently f called atten- 
tion to the probability that the snake poison is elimiuated through the 
kidneys. 

Quite recently Dr. Konrad Alt, of Germany, in a pai)er read before 
the Natural History Society of Halle on the Saale, on July 23, 1802, § 
has demonstrated that a portion of the venom, at least, is eliminated by

the stoinacli. Two sets of experiments were made upon dogs. In the 
one set the stomach was washed out carefully, the result being that the 
animals so treated showed a distinctly less degree of iioisouiug than the 
control animals. In the other set, the contents of the stomach with 
proper precautions were inoculated into other dogs, the result being 
symptoms of poisoning identical with those of the control animals. 
INIoreover, the presence of the unaltered venom was demonstrated by 
chemical tests. 

The conclusion seems justified that a washing out of the patient's 
stomach ought to be part of the treatment of a case of snake bite. 

This entire question seems a promising field for future investigation, 
which we earnestly recommend to physiologists having the opportunity 
and wishing to advance our knowledge of snake poison and its treat- 
ment. 

TREATMENT. 

It is not for the present writer to recommend any one special treat- 
ment of cases of snake-bite poisoning; but he is willing to state what 
would seem to be a rational treattaeut, in view of our jiresent knowl- 
edge of the subject. He will, however, confine himself to such cases as 
may arise from poisoning by snakes occurring in this country only. 

Evidently the first thing to ascertain is whether the case is really that 
of a bite by a poisonous snake, ieaving here out of consideration the 
opistlwglyphs, the bite of which probably is too rare and too insignificant 
to need special mention. If consisting of one or of two isolated punc- 
tures, the wound is almost certain to be caused by a poisonous bite, and 
the distance between the two punctures will usually give a clew to the 
size of the snake and consequently to the presumable degree of the 
poisoning. If the snake or its head are secured, the identification may 
be comparatively easy, as all our poisonous snakes, with the exception 
of the JiJlaps, or harlequin snake, of the Southern and Southwestern 
States, are readily recognized by the pit between the eye and the 
nostril, as before stated (p. 365, fig. 9). The characters of the Elaps 
have also been given in this work (p. 356, figs. 5, 7, 8), and no difficulty 
should be found in making a correct identification. As will be plain 
from what has been said above concerning the difterence in the action 
of the crotalid and the elapid snakes, this distinction may be of some 
importance in selecting the correct treatment. 

In very severe acute cases, in which the venom has been injected 
directly into the circulation, no matter by what kind of snake, the 
chances for recovery are very slight indeed. The only chance in 
such cases seems to be to stimulate the nervous centers as speedily 
as possible, the best known means to this end being injection of large 
doses of strychnine, if necessary, intravenously, until tetanic effects are 
obtained and the patient roused from the coma which has probably 
seized him. This result obtained, other systematic or local remedies, as 
the case may require, can then be applied. 



476 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

A similar treatmeut also seems advisable iu such cases of slow poison- 
ing* in wliicli the patient lias already reached a stage of collapse, or 
coma, before assistance can bo rendered, provided not more than 
twenty fonr hours have elapsed since the bite was ioflicted, in which 
case injections of strychnine seem inapplicable. 

If iu case of slow poisoning help can be administered very soon after 
the infliction of the wouud and the venom has been localized by liga- 
tures and uiininiized by incision of the wound, sucking, or, better, cup- 
piug of the blood, the treatment next to be applied depends upon 
whether the ottendiug snake is a Pit Viper (Crotalid)or an Ulaps, for if 
it was a rattlesnake, a copperhead, or a water moccasin, atteution 
should at once be directed to the local lesion, unless the state of the 
patient imperatively demands an immediate stimulant, in which case 
smaU doses of alcohol may be useful. Apparently the best treatment 
of the local lesion is an 1 to 100 solution of chromic acid injected into 
the incised wound, the punctures of the fangs, and into the surrounding 
swelling, as quickly as the circumstances will allow, since the success 
of this treatment depends upon the chemical reaching and destroying 
the venom before it is absorbed into the circulation. Kneading of the 
tissues surrounding the wound in order to bring the venom and chemi- 
cal in close contact may be useful. If chromic acid is not at hand, 
chloride of gold, permanganate of potassa, etc., may be substituted. 

There does not seem to be any necessity for amputation in a case 
where hj^podermic injection of any of these chemicals can be applied. 
It can only be recommended in such extreme cases in which these 
remedies are not to be had, and the danger great. But even in this 
case the amputation must follow quickly or not at all. 

The local lesion having been attended to, the general systemic treat- 
ment may commence, as by this time the venom has probably already 
entered the circulation, it being necessary occasionally to loosen the 
ligatures for a moment to ijrevent mortification. Alcohol in small 
doses and washing out of the stomach may now be in order, as well as 
the administration of sudorific and diuretic remedies, preferably 
extract of jaUorandi. Hypodermic injections of 15 to 20 minims of 
liqu. strychni;e repeated every twenty minutes until slight tetanic 
spasms appear, seem to be warranted. Constant watching for relapses 
and attention to the local lesion will do the rest. 

The acti(m of the venom of the elapid snakes being so much more 
rapid and the local changes so insignificant as not to cause any great 
alarm, the chances are that when the i^atient asks for help and treat- 
ment the venom has already entered the circulation, and that attempt 
to destroy any appreciable quantity of the poison in the wound would 
be futile. However, whenever possible this should not be neglected. 
The usual first treatment would nevertheless be general, viz, the 
administration of stimulants, sudorifics and duiretics as instanced 
above, since the danger from a quick paralysis of the nerve centers is 
so much greater in these cases. 



I 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 477 

It may be well to emphasize here, that in the case of children the 
amount of the antidotal remedy to be administered must not be judged 
by the age of the child, but by the amount of venom to be counter- 
acted as well as by the character of the snake, and it is worth remem- 
bering in this connection — besides the different action of the crotalid 
and the elapid snakes — that the degree of danger chiefly depends upon 
the size of the snake; that of our i^it vipers the rattlesnake is the most 
dangerous, the copperhead less so, and the water moccasin the least 
so, although in itself not to be trifled with. 

As for the preliminary treatment before medical assistance can be 
obtained or rational remedies applied, but little can be added to the 
old methods employed. The fi.rst thing to be done is to tie a strong 
ligature or two, a string or a handkerchief, between the wound and the 
heart, whenever i)racticable ; next, cutting deeply into the punctures so 
as to make the blood flow freely; sucking out of the blood from the 
wound, a procedure perfectly harmless, unless the person doing it has 
an open wound in the mouth; next, careful loosening of the ligature so 
as to admit a small quantity of fresh blood to the ligated member in 
order to prevent mortification; next, administration of a stimulant; if 
at hand, small doses of an alcoholic liquor being given internally at fre- 
quent intervals; if alcohol is not at hand, and a stimulant appears 
imperative, a small dose of ammonia might be given, but only very 
shortly after the bite, not on a later stage when it will certainly do 
harm, at least in cases of poisoning by rattlesnake, copperhead, or 
water moccasin; if the patient has to wait for the arrival of a doctor, 
now is the time to try all reliable means to produce a i^rofuse perspi- 
ration. 

There may occasionally be such extreme cases in which amputation 
and cauterization by heat or otherwise would be the only available 
remedies, but as a rule such barbaric treatment need not be resorted 
to, and in most cases wouhi probably be a cure worse than the disease. 

There has been placed on the market several specially constructed 
contrivances for use in cases of snake bite, to which I wish to call 
attention. 

A cupping instrument specially constructed for snake bite so as ta 
be easily applicable to small surfaces or the extremities was made 
several years ago by William Hume, instrument maker, Lothian street,, 
street, Edinburgh, Scotland, at a iirice of 10s. (Sd. 

In France, MM. Pelliot & Delon, 2G Rue du Koi-de-Sicile, Paris, at 
the instance of Prof. Kaufmanu, have arranged a pocket case contain 
ing hypodermic syringe, chemicals, directions for use, etc., for the local 
treatment by chromic acid. Price, 6 francs. 

Kaufmann's own directions for the injection of this fluid are as 
follows : 

Two or three drops of an aqueous solution (1 to 100) of chromic 
acid or permanganate of potash are injected with a Pravaz syringe 
exactly into the jjuncture of each fang. It is necessary to let the 



478 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

liquid penetrate into the tissues to the same depth as the venom; the 
injection must, therefore, be more or less deep according to the size of 
the snake. To make absolutely sure, three or four more similar injec- 
tions are made a little distance around the point bitten. 

If, at the time of treatment, the swelling has already obtained a 
certain size it may be necessary to make injections into various points 
of the tumor. After the injections the part is pressed gently with the 
hand so as to distribute the injected fluid in all directions and facili- 
tate its mixture with the venom. Next, some punctures are made with 
the point of a knife. Usually a rather large quantity of yellowish 
serosity flows from the wound, mixed with a part of the injected fluid. 
In order to facilitate this discharge the swelling should be kneeded 
repeatedly with the hand. Then the surface should be washed with 
the permanganate or the chromic solution, and a small piece of lint 
soaked with one or the other of these liquids applied. If, after some 
time, the swelling continues to grow, additional injections into the i)arts 
must be made as well as punctures. With this treatment the tissues 
preserve their vitalitj^; the skin does not turn black but remains red. 
The microbes are destroyed by the injected agents, which act as anti- 
septics as wgI\ as antidotes. 

For the strychnine treatment the Australians have also constructed 
a pocket case containing patent poison sucker, hypodermic syringe 
with two needles, glass mortar and pestle, two tubes of strjxhnine 
tabloids, and directions for use. The manufacturer is L. Bruck, 13 
Castlereagh street, Sydney, and it sells for £1. 

It seems as if a combination of these two cases wo«uld be the thing 
for this country, and ought to be of great service not only to physicians 
residing in those parts ot the States in which poisoning by snake bite 
is not unusual, but also to such persons who.from their occupation are 
particularly exposed to dangers of this kind. 

PREVENTIVE INOCULATION — THE IMMUNITY OF SNAKES AGAINST 

SNAKE VENOM. 

It has been noticed from time to time by various experimenters that 
animals which had recovered from snake-venom injections showed a 
certain amount of resistance afterwards, so as to make then) useless 
for future experiments. It naturally suggested itself to investigators 
that by continued inoculation of small doses of the pure or modified 
venom, immunity from the poison, even in otherwise fatal doses, might 
finally be obtained. 

Such a preventive inoculation, although of doubtful use in this 
country, with its comparatively small number of fatalities from snake 
bites, might be highly beneficial in India and Australia, or to travelers 
or others in tropical countries, who might be specially exposed to such 
dangers. 

As early as 1887 Prof. Henry Sewall, of the University of Michigan, 



I 



POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA. 479 

undertook and leported * npon a series of experiments with massa- 
sauga venom on pigeons. Tlie conclusions drawn were that repeated 
inocuhition with sublethal doses produced a continually increasing- 
resistance toward tlie injurious eftects of the poison without apparent 
influence on the general health of the animals. It was also shown, 
however, that the efficiency of resistance against the venom gradually 
fails in absence of fresh inoculation, although at least one of the 
pigeons retained its immunity over an interval of five months. 

There is another class of observations which have a certain bearing 
on this question. 

It has been long known, although occasionally doubted or contra- 
dicted, that the poisonous snakes are proof against their own venom. 
Big doses of snake venom have repeatedly been inoculated into the 
bodies of the producers themselves absolutely without effect. The cur- 
rent stories of "suicides" of rattlesnakes are easily explained, and in 
none of the many cases reported is there any conclusive proof that 
death resulted from a self-inflicted wound. It is also well known that 
a number of the so-called harmless snakes remain unaffected whether 
bitten by a venomous snake, or inoculated in the laboratory with enor- 
mous doses. 

Considerable light has very recently been thrown upon this curious 
immunity, as well as the question of preventive inoculation, by the 
studies and experiments of two French physiologists, C. Phisalix and 
G. Bertrand, who are at the present moment, I believe, still engaged in 
further work along the same lines. They have published a series of 
articles in the Comptes Eendus of the French Academy of Sciences, 
describing their experiments with the venom of the viper. Having pre- 
viously found that the blood of the toad and the salamander contain the 
same toxic principles they turned their attention to the viper. Guinea 
pigs were injected with the blood of the viper and died within two hours 
under the ordinary symptoms of Yiper-bite poisoning; tlie post mortem 
examination gave the same result; and an examination of the poison in 
the viper blood showed it to be insoluble in alcohol. Tlie authors con- 
clude that there exists in the blood of the viper some agent similar to 
the venom; that it is due to an internal secretion of the glands, and 
that the presence of this toxic principle in the gland must be considered 
as the true cause of the immunity of the vij^er from its own venom. t 

The next step was to examine the blood of some of the poison-proof 
harmless snakes, the two French species of. Natrix being selected for 
the purpose. Guinea pigs injected in a similar manner as in the 
experiments with the viper blood .gave similar results — they died in two

hours with all tbe sj-mptoius of viper-bite poisoning. Having thus 
determined that there exists in the blood of the Xatrix a poisonous agent 
in at least as great a quantity as in the viper and that the immunity 
of these snakes also is due to this cause, the question naturally arose 
as to the origin of the venom in the " harmless" snakes— iu other words, 
by which organs is the venom furnished to the blood. Successive inoc- 
ulation of organic extracts of the principal intestines, liver, pancreas, 
spleen, thymus, thyroid body, and salivary glands gave the result 
that only those of the latter had any effect at all and that this effect 
showed the characteristics of viper-venom poisoning. The natural 
conclusion is that the presence of venom in the blood of the harmless 
snakes is due to internal secretion of the salivary glands.* 

The authors referred to had now reached the stage when they could 
look around for a suitable attenuation of the venom in order to secure 
a proper "vaccine," and they found that heat had this effect. Some of 
the results obtained by them by heating are not new — for instance, that 
boiling the viper venom for a few seconds affects it in such away as to 
disassociate from it the local phenomena, the undestroyed portion left 
being practically elapid, or cobra, poison. When the authors there- 
fore heated a lethal dose of viper venom and, after cooling, inoculated 
it into a guinea pig, they did practically nothing but inoculate the 
animal with a much reduced, nonfatal dose of cobra venom. The result 
of their experiments shows that this vaccination with the thus attenu- 
ated venom results in a certain amount ot immunity, f 

Naturally the authors next experimented with a view to ascertain 
the effects of the blood of the animals thus vaccinated. The experi- 
ments demonstrated the presence of the venom in the blood serum 
after three days (21st to li4th of January), and that this blood serum 
also possesses vaccinating properties. | Of course, the results having^ 
been published on February 12, sufficient time had not la|)sed to deter- 
mine if the immunity thus obtained is lasting. The authors seem to 
be hopeful of obtaining such modifications of the Wood as will enable 
them to utilize it as a therapeutic agent. Experiments and time alone 
will show. 

It is but fair to add that Dr. Calmette claims priority for the dis- 
covery of the ''serum" vaccine treatment. §

POISONOUS SNAKES OF NORTH AMERICA, 481 

EXTERMINATION OF POISONOUS SNAKES. 

It can be stated as a general rule that our poisonous snakes are 
decreasing rapidly in numbers, and that consequently the danger from 
their bites is constantly diminishing. In many localities where rattle- 
snakes were formerly numerous they have now become entirely exter- 
minated, while in others they are extremely rare. The causes that 
liave led to this are various, but the commonest cause is undoubtedly 
the increasing cultivation of the country. In other places the decrease 
in the number of the snakes can be traced directly to their being killed 
off by the hog, an animal certainly not proof against the venom if it 
enters the circulation, but usually well protected by its fat, which is in 
most cases sufficiently thick to prevent the fangs of the serpent from 
penetrating to the nnderlying tissues. 

From other localities there is reported a similar decrease without it 
having been possible to offer a satisfactory explanation. As a striking 
illustration of this, I may cite the experience of an exploring party 
under Dr. C. Hart ]Merriam, camping for several months at the base of 
the San Francisco Mountain, Arizona, in 1889. The party consisted of 
a number of naturalists, specialists in mammalogy, ornithology, herpe- 
tology, and botany, who were busily engaged in studying the fauna 
and tlora of that mountain for several months during the summer. Yet 
not a single rattlesnake was collected or seen by the party in that 
locality where twenty-five years previously Dr. E. Cones had collected 
quite a series of them, belonging to several species, during a compara- 
tively short stay, notwithstanding the fact that the character of the 
country has apparently not changed in any essential particular. It 
has not been brought under cultivation; there are no hogs running 
about, only herds of cattle 5 no regular burning over of the ground 
takes place; no special enemies could be discovered; a few people pass 
occasionally through the district, and fewer still live there permanently. 

On the other hand, there are instances on record of localities in which 
certain species of poisonous snakes have actually increased. This may 
occur in places, for instance, where the land was formerly burned over 
regularly everj^ year, thus destroying the snakes in great numbers. 
Dr. H. H. Behr* attributes the increase in the number of rattlesnakes 
in some localities not far from San Francisco to the killing off of the 
enemies of the snake, notably birds of prey and other snakes, and 
probably correctly, while Mr. Hurter (Trans. Acad. St. Louis, vi, 1893, 
11. 258) reports a similar increase in western Illinois as due to the new 
stock law compelling swine to be penned up. 

The poisonous snakes have a great many natural enemies which keep 
them in check, but there does not seem to exist in this country any 
animal which makes a specialty of the business and is particularly

adapted for it, with the possible exception of some of the harmless 
snakes. We have seen that the latter, at least a great many of tliem, 
are poison-])roof, and thus have but little to fear from the bite, and it is 
a well known fact that some of them are able to kill and eat a poisonous 
snake at least eciualing- them in size. Amongthe most redoubted enemies 
of the rattlesnake is quoted the common king snake or chain snake, 
LampropeHis gctulus, and the remnants of poisonous snakes are often 
found in the stomachs of other species. 

This fact emphasizes the desirability of a correct discrimination 
between the poisonous kinds and the harmless snakes. The former 
ought to be killed and, if possible, exterminated wherever found; the 
latter should not only be spared, but protected and their multiplication 
encouraged, as they rank among the best friends of the farmer and the 
gardener. 

I do not know whether it has ever been tried anywhere in this 
country to pay a bounty or a premium per head, or rattle, for the 
extermination of the dangerous snakes, but it is occasionally suggested, 
and may deserve a moment's reflection in this connection, notwithstand- 
ing the fact that there are but few localities in North America in which 
the really dangerous snakes are numerous enough to render even an 
ex]>eriment with bounty desirable. It would be different, of course, if 
the system should have i^roved to possess any merit or to have been 
followed by success in countries where it has already been tried. A 
brief mention of some of the more noteworthy attempts in this line will 
show, however, that such has not been the case. 

It has been tried and is still in vogue in India, where large sums are 
paid annually for the purpose. But it does not seem to do much good, 
except perhaps the moral effect in a country in which the dreaded 
cobra* is considered sacred by a great portion of the poi)ulation. Even 
in the little island of Martinique, it appears to have had but scant 
effect in diuiinishing the number of the deadly '' ler-de-lance."t 

Prof. Kaufmann, in his book so often referred to, on the other hand, 
indorses the system as having been instrumental in diminishing the 
number of vipers in France, and submits that if it has not always 
given good results where it might be expected, the reason is solely that 
the system has not been applied in a thorough manner, in other words, 
that it has not been adopted over the whole country. In defense of 
this he appends a table showing the number of vipers killed in three 
" departments " (counties) since the beginning of the system. The 
table is verj' interesting, but as the results are very similar in all three 
( Haute-Saone, Doubs, Jura), I shall not weary the reader with more 
columns of figures than those from the department of Haute Saone as 
being most characteristic.

Let us look at this table for a moment. Nearly 300,000 vipers killed 
during twenty-seven years in a department of France almost the exact 
size of the State of Delaware (Haute-Saone, 2,028 square miles; Dela- 
ware, 2,050 square miles)! Haute-Saone, in 187G, about the middle of 
the period covered by the table, had a population of 304,052 souls ; 
consequently there is said to have been killed in one generation one 
viper for each human inhabitant! But let us analyze the table a little 
closer. 

We observe first that in the years of the Franco-German war and 
those next following there was a great drop in the number of vipers 
killed, for the people naturally had other things to attend to. We 
also notice that when, in 1882, the authorities reduced the premium 
from 25 centimes to 15 centimes per viper the people evidently lost 
interest in the business, which must have become unj)rofitable, since 
the number killed suddenly dropi^ed from nearly 14,000, in 1882, to 
a little more than 1,000, in 1883. The result evidently was that, the 
authorities became alarmed at the possible increase of the dreaded 
reptile and again raised the premium to the old figure, undoubtedly to 
the great satisfaction of the snake hunters and a corresponding deple- 
tion of the county treasury. Furthermore, if we average the number 
of snakes killed during the six years before the war we will find that 
the annual average of vipers killed was 2,952, or nearly 3,000. The 
corresponding figure for the six years following the excessive drop 
caused by the war is 2,544, or somewhat less than the average of the 
first six years. Two conclusions seem warranted by these figures, 
first, that the average of these twelve years, viz, 2,748, represents the 
normal number which a diligent search throughout the department 
might yield; second that the decrease in the number of vipers killed 
during the years 1870-1872 did not materially increase the number of 



484 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

vipers diiriug the period following, unless it might be assumed that 
the premium had already effected a diminution of the vipers as early 
as 1807, which is, of course, barely jiossible. We would now be pre 
pared for a constant decrease in the number of vipers killed yearly 
from 1879 on, but on the contrary, in 1880 the figures jump to 15,000, 
and with the exception of the years affected by the reduction of the 
premium, the number of alleged vipers killed is steadily increasing, 
until in 1880 it reaches the astounding number of 67,620! 

At what rate must the vipers of Haute-Saone have been multiplying 
since 1880! And this is what Prof. Kaufmaun considers a successful 
system. 

The conclusion seems irresistible that tlie functionaries paying the 
bounty have either made false returns and pocketed the money, or else 
that they have paid for every snake brought in whether poisonous or not. 
The latter sup])osition Avould be the more disastrous one to the county, 
because of the enormous number of useful species that must have 
perished. One only wonders if a single snake is left in Haute-Saone. 

But whichever of the two suppositions is the correct one, this case 
corroborates only the experience which has been had everywhere that 
bounties, as a rule, are failures where a nice discrimination has to be 
made by the premium-paying functionary, and that it very often leads 
to fraud both on the side of this otiticial and on that of the bounty 
hunter.

CHINESE GAMES WITH DICE AND DOMINOES. 



By Stewart Culin. 



" The earth hath V)ubhles, as the water has, and these are of them." 

This paper,* of which a preliminary study was printed in 1889,t is the 
first of a series on Chinese games, to be continued by similar accounts 
of playing cards and chess. It has been considerably extended, through 
recent studies in connection especially with the collection gathered by 
the author in the Anthropological Building in Chicago, and that in the 
National Museum. | 

The games described are chiefly those of the Chinese laborers in 
America, a limitation found as acceptable as it is necessary, since even 
among these people, who all came from a comparatively small area, there 
exist variations in the methods of gambling, as well as in the termi- 
nology of their games. The latter is made up largely of slang and col- 
loquial words and presents many difficulties. The gamblers are usually 
men of the most ignorant class, and those most familiar with the games 
are often the least able to furnish correct Chinese transcriptions of the 
terms employed in them, so that the task of interpretation would have 
been extremely difficult but for the assistance received from Chinese 
and Japanese scholars.§ 

' This paper lias been prt-pared at the request of the authorities of the U. S. National 
Museum, to illustrate a portion of its extensive collection of games.

of Philadelphia. | March 14, 1889. | Philadelphia. | 1889. 8^. pp. 1-21. 

tThis collection, though the author modestly refrains from mentioning the fact, 
owes much of its completeness to Mr. Culin's own generous contributions.

"Tonic Dictionary of the Chinese Language in the Cauton Dialect," Canton, 1856.

Korean words, in the absence of any native standard of orthogra])hy, and for the 
purpose of convenient reference, have been made to accord with that admirable work,

CHINESE DICE. 



GAMES WITH DICE. 

Chinese dice* are small cubes of bone marked on each side with 
incised spots from 1 to (5 in number, (fig-. 1) which are arranged in the 
same manner as the S])ots on modern European dice, as well as those of 
Greece and Eomeof classical antiquity;! the " six" and "one," "five" 
and "two," and "four" and "three" being on opposite sides. 
The "four" and "one" spots on Chinese dice are painted red, and the 

"six," "five," "three," 
and "two" are painted 
black. The "one" is 
always much larger and 
more deeply incised than 
the other spots, possibly 
to compensate for its 
op])osite, the " six." 

The origin of the cus- 
tom of painting the 
"fours" red is accounted for, according to the Wa Kan san sai dzu e,| 
by the following story: 

An emperor of the Ming dynasty (A. D. 1368-1643) played at suqorokn with his 
queen. He was ahnost defeated by her, but had one way of winning through the 
dice turning "fours." He cried and threw the dice, and they came as he desired, 
whereupon he was exceedingly glad, and ordered that the "fours" thereafter be 
painted red, in remembrance of his winning. 

A similar story was related to me as a cominon tradition among the 
Cantonese, by an intelligent Chinese, who gave the emperor's name as 
Ld Ling Wong^\ who reigned under the title of Chung Tsung (A. D. 

* The common name for dice among the Cantonese is shik tsz', composed of shilc, 
"colors," and tsz\ " seed," " dice." 

In Medhurst's English and Chinese Dictionary, Shanghai, 1847, three other names 
for dice are given: t 'an tsz' composed of t' au, written with a character compounded 
of the radicals, kivat, "bone," and shii, "a weapon," "to strike," and the auxiliary 
tsz'; sJietuig Ink, "double sixes," from what is regarded as the highest throw with 2 
dice, and htk ch'ik, literally "six carnation." The last name may be considered as 
a compound of the terms for the most important throws: "six" and carnation or 
red; the "four," to which, as will be seen, an especial signiticance is attached, as 
well as the "one," the lowest throw with a die, being painted red. In Japanese dice 
are called sai, a word written with a Chinese character, ts'oi, "variegated," "lucky." 

t About the only dotted cubical dice which depart from this arrangement are those 
of the ancient Etruscans, which are regarded as having the "one" and the "three," 
"two" and "four," and "five" and "six" opposite, a system which does not appear, 
according to the writer's observation, to have been constant. 

t "Japanese Chinese Three Powers' (Heaven, Earth, Man) picture collection." 
Osaka, 1714; vol. 17, fol. 4. 

^ Whence a vulgar name for dice among the Cantonese, hot lb, composed of hot, 
"to call out loud," and lb, for Lb Ling Wong. 

Modern Indian dice are usually marked with black and red spots. In the Mahab- 
harata (iv, 1, 25) reference is made to "dice, dotted black and red." (Prof. E. W. 
Hopkins, J. A. O. S., vol. 13, p. 123.) 



CHINESE GAMES WITH DICE AND DOMINOES. 493 

684, 701-710). Mr. Herbert A. Giles* tells me that this story is men- 
tioned by a Chinese author, but I am inclined to regard the account as 
fanciful, and think that it is probable that the color of the '' fours" 
was derived, with the dice themselves, from India. 

Several sizes of dice are used by the Chinese, varying from a cube 
01 two-tenths to one of seven-tenths of an inch. Difterent sizes are 
employed in different games, according to custom. 

Dice are usually thrown by hand into a porcelain bowl, the jdayers 
throwing around in turn from right to left, and accompanying their 
efforts with cries of lot! "come !" 

The Chinese laborers in the United States play several games with 
dice, but they are not a popular mode of gambling, and are generally 
neglected for fan fan, and Chinese dominoes. 

sz' 'ng luk. 

The best known of these games is called sz^ ''ng lul\ " four, five, six," 
commonly contracted to sing lul; and is played with 3 dice of the 
largest size. The throws in it in the order of their rank are: ''Tliree 
alike from three "sixes " down, called teat A " Four, five, six," called 
sing Jul- or chiin fd.^ Two alike, the odd die countingfrom " six " down 
to ace, the last throw being called yaf fat, "ace negative." One, 
two, three, called mo lung, "dancing dragon," or she tsai, "little 
snake." 

The first player is determined, on throwing around, to be the one 
who throws the highest number of red spots. The other players lay 
their wagers, usually in sums di\asibleby3, before them. The first player 
throws until he makes one of the above mentioned casts. If he throws 
sing litJc ("four, five, six"); 3 alike; or 2 alike, "six" high, each of the 
players at once pay him the full amount of their stakes; but if he 
throws mo lung or yat fat, he pays them the full amount of their 
stakes. If he throws 2 alike, "five," "four," "three," or "two" high, 
the next player on his left throws. If the latter makes a higher 
cast, the first player must pay him, but if a lower cast, he must pay 
the first player. The amounts thus paid are usually proportionate 
to the difference between the throws with the odd die. If it is 4 
or 3, the full amount; if 2, two-thirds, or if 1, one-third of the stakes 
must be paid. 

The third player throws in the same way, and the game is continued 
until the first player is out- thrown. 

* Chinese dice are the exact counterpart of our own except that the ace and four 
are colored red; the ace because the combination of black and white would be 
unlucky and the "four" because this number once turned up in response to the call 
of an Emperor of the T'ang dynasty, who particularly wanted a "four" to win him 
the jiarfie. (Strange stories from a Chinese Studio, Vol, ii, p. 145.) 

t Wai means "to inclose," and is a term that is also employed in Chinese games of 
chess and cards. 

t Literally, "strung flowers." 



494 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

KON MIN YEUNG. 

Kon min yeung, " pursuing sheep," is played with 6 dice of the larg- 
est size. It is a game played for small stakes, usually for something 
to eat, and is seldom resorted to by professional gamblers. 

In it the player throws until he gets 3 alike, when the sum of the 
spots on the other dice is counted. 

The throws in the order of their rank are: Six " sixes," called tdi 
min yeung, " large sheep." Six " fives," " fours," '• threes," " twos," or 
"ones," called min yeung Jcung, ^^ yauis.^^ Three alike and "six, six, 
five," called wm y<?MM5' M(/, "ewes." Three alike and the other throws 
than the above. These are designated by the number representing the 
sum of the throws with the 3 odd dice. 

The throws, tdi min yeung and min yeung Jcung, take all the stakes. 
If min yeung nd, or any other cast of 3 alike, is made, the next player 
throws until he gets 3 alike, when he pays if his throw is lower, or is 
paid if it is higher, as in sing luk. 

The throw of 3 "fours" is called ivong i^ang fui, concerning the 
origin of which name the following story is related : 

A boy ami girl were betrothed by their parents. The girl's father died, and the 
family having been reduced to poverty, her brother sold the girl to become a prosti- 
tute. This she resented, and anxious to lind her betrothed, whose face she well 
remembeied, she caused it to be advertised that she would yield herself to the man 
who could throw 3 '' fours" with the dice. Many, attracted by her beauty, tried and 
failed, until her husband, Wong p'ang-fiii, Avho had obtained the rank of kdi iin, or 
senior wrangler at the provincial examination, presented himself. For him she sub- 
stituted loaded dice, with which he threw 3 "fours," whereupon she disclosed her- 
self, and they were happily united. 

chIk t'in KAU. 

ChdTi fin I'liu, "throwing heaven and nine," is played with 2 dice. In 
this game the 21 throws that can be made with 2 dice receive different 
names, and are divided into two series, or suits, called man, "civil," 
and mo, "military." 

The 11 mail throws, in the order of their rank, are figured on the 
right of Plate i. They are: 

" Double six," called fin, "heaven." 

"Double one," called ti, "earth." 

" Double four," called yan, "man." 

" One, three " called tvo,* " harmony." 

" Double five," called miii, "plum (dower)." t 

*Thi8 throw is called by some ngo, a " goose," a name, like those of the throws 
that follow it in this series, evidently derived from a fancied resemblance of the 
spots on the dice. 

tThe 5 spot is also called by the name of mitme or " plum (flower)," in Japan. In 
Korea the same name, mai-hoa, "plum flower," is given to the sequence " five, one;" 
"five, two;" "five, three;" "five, four;" "five, five;" "five, six " in the game of 
Ho-hpai, with dominoes.

"Double two," called j;a'» tang, "bench." 

" Five, six," called /«' fan, '' tiger's head." 

" Four, six," called htuig fan shap, " red head ten." 

" One, six," called kb ke'uk ts'at, " long leg seveu." 

" One, five," called hung ch'ui luk, "red mallet six." 

The 10 mo throws in the order of their rank are figured on the left 
of Plate I. They are: 

" Five, four," and " six, three," called kau, " nines." 

" Five, three," and " six, two," called pat, '■ eights."

" Four, two," called luk, " six." 

"Three, two," and "four, one," called 'ng, " fives." 

"One, two," called sdm, " three," or srfw kai, "three final." 

The first player determined, the other players lay their wagers on 
the table. The first player then throws and his cast determines the 
suit, whether wmw or mo, for that round, i^o other throws count and

the players throw again, if necessary, until they make a cast of the 
suit led. If the first player throws the highest pair of either series, 
that is the " double six " of the man, or one of the '' nines '' of the mo, 
each player at once pays him, but if he leads the lowest of either suit, 
tliat is, the "five, oue,"or '^ one, two," he pays them the amount of 
their stakes. 

If he throws any other pair than the highest or lowest of either suit 
the second player throws, and is paid his stakes, if he throws higher, 
by the first player, or pays him if he throws lower. The game is con- 
tinued until the first player is outthiown. when he is succeeded by the 
second player, and the others lay their wagers as before.

Pelt chd, " grasping eight," is played with 8 dice, preferably of the 
smallest size. In this game the banker is provided with a diagram 
(fig. 2) numbered or dotted, lilie the G faces of a die, upon which the

players place their stakes. It bears the iegeud ^jat fung, " unlike," 
which expresses the desire of the banker as to the manner in which 
the dice sliall fall. A player throws 8 dice. If at least 3 fall like the 
number bet on, the gamekeeper pays him 8 times, or if G or more are 
like the number bet on, 16 times the amount of his 
stakes. In any other event, the player loses. A 
similarly marked tablet is used in playing with the 
chh' me, or teetotum (fig, 3). This implement is made 
with G dotted sides. The players lay their stakes 
upon the numbers on the tablet, and wia 4 times 
the amount of their stakes if the one played on turns 
uppermost, or lose, if another number comes up. 
The ch^e me is said to have its sides decorated 
sometimes with pictures of fish and animals instead 
of numbers or spots, and the diagram, which is 
called the c/i'J me p^di, or the • "tablet for the 
teetotum," is then similarly inscribed (flg. 3).* 

CHONG UN CH'AU. 

CJiong ihi cWaii is a game played with tallies, ch'au, the highest of 
which is called ehong iin, the name given the 02)timi(s at the examina- 
tions for the degree of Hanliu, whence I have styled it "The Game of 
the Chief of the Literati." (pi. 3.) Two or more persons may play, using 
6 dice and 63 bamboo tallies. The latter receive the following names: 

First. One piece about G inches in length, called chong iin, the tirst 
of the Hanlin doctors. This counts as 32. 

Second, Two shorter pieces called j^omj ngdn, second of the Hanlin, 
f dm fa, third of the Hanlin. Each count as 16. 

Third. Four shorter pieces called ui iin, the First of the tsun sz\ or 
literary graduates of the third degree. Each count as 8. 

Fourth. Eight shorter pieces called tsun zs\ literary graduates of the 
third degree. Each count as 4. 

*A similar game from Mauila, Philippiue Islamls, in the United States National 
Museum (Plate 2), consists of a cardboard with 6 equal divisious, with numbers, 
represented by disks of colored paper, from 1 to 6; a hexagon-shaped top with num- 
bers from 1 to 6, and a saucer in which to spin it. It is described by the collector, 
Hon. Alex. R. Webb, United States Consul, under the name of prinola, as a popular 
game in the market places with the native women. " Bets are placed on the spots on 
the board, the top is spun rapidly in the saucer, and the winners are paid double the 
amount of their bets. Only one number can win, of course the one corresponding 
to that which turns up when the top stops turning, and the chances are therefore 
quite largely in favor of the dealer." The name is evidently the Portuguese pirinola, 
but the game is probably of Chinese or Indian origin. In India a 6-sided teetotum, 
chuK-ree, identical with the Chinese, is used, and is turned like a top on a wooden or 
china plate. " The stakes are placed on a board with 6 partitions, and the game is 
decided on the settling of the die with a particular number uppermost. The play 
of this game is allowed only during the Diwali festival, when gambling is sanc- 
tioned as a religious observance," (Ms, catalogue of Indian games and toys pro- 
cured for the Chicago exhibition. Provincial Museum, Lucknow, India.)

Fifth. Sixteen shorter pieces called Jcil yan, graduates of the second 
degree. Each count as 2. 

Sixth. Thirty-two shorter pieces called sau ts^oi, graduates of the 
first degree. Each count as 1. 

The first, second, and third classes bear rude jDictures and names, 
but the others are usually distinguished only by their size. 

Two or more persons can play. The players throw in turn from right 
to left, and after throwing each draws the tallies he is entitled to 
according to the appended table. If the tally called for by a throw 
has been drawn, its value maybe made up from the remaining ones; 
but the winner of the chong iln must surrender it without compensation 
if another player makes a higher throw than that by which he won it. 
The one who counts highest becomes the winner. 

The game is said to be played by women and children, and is not 
played b}' the Chinese laborers in the eastern United States, although 
they are generally acquainted with it. 

A set of implements for this game from Johore in the collection of 
His Highness the Sultan at the Columbian Exposition was similar 
to that above described, and was evidently of Chinese Avorkmanship. 
It was catalogued under the name chong tcan chiani {chong iin ch^au), 
the tallies being called huah-buah bertulis. 

The throws in chong iln ch^au, in the order of their rank, are: 

6 "fours." 6 "fives." 6 "twos." 

6 "sixes." 6 "threes." 6 "ones." 

These throws are called ts'un shik, and take all the tallies: 

5 "fours" ami 1 "six," or 1 "five," or 1 "three," or 1 "two," or 1 "one." 

.5 "sixes" and 1 "four," or 1 "five," or 1 "three," or 1 "two," or 1 "one."

CHINESE BACKGAMMON. 
( From De Lmlis Orienlalibus. 1694, ) 



The Chinese game similar to backgammon, which that accomplished 
scholar, Dr. Thomas Hyde, described in his work on Oriental games 
under the name of Chinensium Nerdiludium ( The Nerd Game of the 
Chinese) * is not played by the Chinese laborers in America, nor do 
any I have met appear to be acquainted with it (fig. 4.) 

According to Dr. Hyde, it is called by Chinese goan Ki, which he 
translates as erectns ludus, or erectorum Indus, but which might be 
rendered as " the bottle game " or " bottle chess" go<ni {tsnn), meaning 
a vase or bottle, aud Ki (A:'r) being a generic name for games played 
with men as chess. 

This game is played with dice and small upright pillars, from which the name is 
derived. The board is divided into eight equal parts by transverse lines, and the 
pieces, which are from 2 to 3 inches high and number IG on each side, are arranged 
upon it when the playing commences, as seen in the figure. 

The pieces are moved line by line, according to the throws with the dice, from the 
places on the left to the eighth place on the right, and from thence ascending'to the 



*De Ludis Orientalibus. Oxford, 1694, p. 65. 



CHINESE GAMES WITH DICE AND DOMINOES. 499 

opposite side and back to the starting jilace, the player who first gets all his pieces 
there winning the game. 

Two dice are thrown, and the pieces are moved to the places which the nnmlter of 
the throws directs. One may move whatever piece or pieces one chooses, according 
to the number, either pieces which have been moved before or those which have not 
yet been moved. If, instead of upright pieces, one plays with small flat discs, which 
is also permitted, they may be placed side by side or piled on top of each other, as 
seems most convenient. 

A throw of 2 "ones" causes a piece to be set aside and delivered uji as lost, or, if 
the game is played for money, it loses the player the tenth part of his stakes. Who- 
ever throws "twos ■' or " threes " begins moving to the second or third lines, and so 
on. If doublets are thrown, one may move to the place corresponding to the half 
uximber of such doublets; and this maybe done by moving 1 piece once to such 
half number, or 2 pieces at the same time to the place corresponding with such whole 
number, for in this case either 1 or 2 pieces together may be moved. If " five " and 
"six," which make 11, are thrown, one may move 1 piece to the fifth place and 
another to the eleventh, or else move 2 pieces at the same time to the tenth line 
or place, and then 1 of them to the next line, which is the eleventii. And thus 
with resi>ect to other throws : If single (as " two " and " four "), for the single num- 
bers move as many places, but if joined (as "five" and "six"), then otherwise, as 
already stated. 

The game of backgammon, played upon a board of 24 stations simi- 
lar to the boards in common use in Spain at the present day, exists 
along the entire eastern coast of Asia, from Korea to the Malay Penin- 
sula. 

SSANG-RYOUK. 

In Korea the game of backgammon is known as ssang-ryouk (Ohi^lese 
slu'umj Jul), doable sixes. It is played with wooden pins or men 
(fig. 5), called mal (Chinese md), '' horses," upon a hollowed board, «san^- 
ryouk-lipan* according to the throws with two dice. 

The throws receive the following names: 

1-1, syo-syo (Chinese siu siii), " smallest." 

1-2, tjoui-hko (Chinese shii pi), "rat nose. ' 

1-3, syo sdm (Chinese sUl sdm), " small and three." 

1-4, putk 8(i (Chinese jja'/t sz'), " white and four." 

1-5, |jfliA; i (Chinese pdk 'ng), " white and five." 

1-6, pdik ryoiik (Chinese j>a'A; luk), "white aiul six." 

2-2, tjoun-a (Chinese tsun a), "superior two." 

* Hpan, the ^ord used for "board " in ssana-ryouk, as well as Korean chessand other 
Korean games, is written with the Chinese character meaning "an order," "rank," 
which the Cantonese call kuk. The men are about 31 inches in height. I^ifteen are 
employed on each side, one set being painted red and the other left the natural color 
of the wood. They are usually made of boxwood, but some softer wood is emjjloyed 
for the cheaper sets. 

Dice are called in Korean //]/0M-.9rt-« (Chinese c/u* sftrf, " vermillion," d f ), and are 
identical in every respect with those of China. The only other Korean games with 
dice than ssang-ryouk with which I am acquainted areas follows: One which my 
informant tells me has no particular name, but which might be calledtjyou-sa-d-nol-ki 
Three or four boys sit around, and one puts a peanut or pine nut on the floor and the 
die is thrown, the nut going to the one throwing the highest. The other, consists 
in the substitution of a cubical die for the four staves used in the prevailing Korean 
game of nymit-nol-ki.

A diagram of the board, net as at the coimneucement of the game, 
is shown in tig. C. 

The board lias mortised sides, which extend abont 2 inches above the 
surface. The divisions on either side, called jja^ (Chinese f in, "helds"), 
are simply outlined in black. The larger ones in the middle are not 
counted in moving, and are used to throw the dice in. The first player 
is determined by the highest throw with 1 die. The pieces are moved 
around according to the throws, as in the English game of backgam- 
mon; but it is customary to move 2 pieces when doublets are thrown, 
and doublets do not entitle the player to another throw, nor to any 
additional count than if the dice were dissimilar. 

A player may take an opponent's piece, which must be again entered, 
as in the English game. This is called tjap-ta,'^ to catch." When a 
player gets all his men around into his home place he bears them off 
according to his subsequent throws. •

CHINESE GAMES WITH DICE AND DOMINOES. 503 

The moves are made according to the throws of the dice, the name 
being derived from that of the highest throw, suf/oroJcu (Chinese, s/imwp 
luJc), or '-double sixes."* 

tSugorolcu appears to be of great antiquity in Japan. The Wa Kan 
sdn sat states that it is recorded in the Japanese Annals that sugoroku 
was forbidden in the time of Jito Tenno (A, D. G87-C02), and that it is 
probable that it was played in Japan before the game of <7ot was brought 
to that country. The same encyclopedia, in the careful manner usual 
in such works, makes a number of citations from Chinese authors with 
reference to the origin of the game. It says it is recorded in the Suh 
sz' ch'it that Ts'ao Chih§ of Wei invented svgoroliu^ and used 2 dice 
for it, but at the end of the Tang dynasty (A. D. 618-013), the number 
of dice was increased to 6. 

It is written in the Wii tsah tsu that sugorolu is a game that was 
originally played in Hu (Japanese, Ko), the country of the Tartars. It 
relates that the King of Hu had a brother who was put to deatli for a 
crime. While in prison he made the game of sugoroku and sent it to 
his father, writing with it a few words in order to make known how men 
are' oppressed by others when they are single and weak. 

The Ngau lui yau states that sugoraku came Irom the T'ien Chuh, 
''India.'' 

The name of stigorolu is applied at the jiresent day in Japan to 
various games played upon boards or diagrams, in which the moves 
are made by throwing dice.|| Of these there are many kinds, among 



* Sugoroku is also called rokiisai, as will be seen from the names appended to fig. 11. 

t Chess, by whicli tlie game of 360 men, half black and half white, called by the 
Chinese tvai k'i is meant. 

JIamnnable to identify either this or the two following works quoted in the 
Wa Kan san sai. 

^ Ts'ao Chih (A. D. 192-232) was the third son of the great usurper, Ts'au Ts'au, 
who overthrew the Han dynasty. He was distinguished by precocious talent and 
poetical genius, and devoted himself wholly to literary diversions*. (The Chinese 
Reader's Manual, No. 759.) 

II The name is also applied to at least one simple dice game in which no board or 
diagram is used. Mr. Kajiwara informs me tliat in the Province of Aomori, a com- 
mon game with 2 dice is called ichi-san suyoroku; so called from the name of the 
highest throw, ielii san, "one, three." 

Japanese dice at the present day usually have their 6 faces marked with black 
dots. Those used by gamblers are said to be larger than the kind employed in 
popular amusements. The dice games are said to vary in dift'erent parts of the 
Empire. Japanese sailors in New York City play a game with 2 dice called cM han, 
" even and odd." They throw 2 dice under a cup. The even throws are called cho 
and the odd han. The players, two or more in number, bet on the even or odd by 
calling out and laying their wagers before them while the cup remains inverted over 
the dice. They use foreign playing cards cut lengthwise in strips and tied in bundles 
of 10 as counters, instead of money ; a custom that they say has its origin in the use 
of the narrow Japanese playing cards, or bamboo tallies at home for this purpose. 
The same game, under the same name, called by the Chinese dieumj pun, is known 
to the Cantonese laborers in the United States as a common game in China.

whicli the most popular is called <io chiuj or " trave]iii_j>" sngorol-n. It 
is played upon a large sheet of paper, ou which are represented the 
various stopping- places upon a journey; as, for example, the 53 post 
stations between Tokio and Kiyoto, and resembles the games of " snake" 

and "steeplechase," familiar to 
English and American children.* 
Such games are much played by 
the Japanese at the season of the 
the Xew Year, when new ones are 
usually published. In 18S9, Japa- 
nese newspapers reported that two 
new games oi sugoroku found much 
favor in Tokio. 

Fig. 12. 

The same general name would 

JAPANESE CHILDREN PI-AYING SUGOROKD. * 

be given by the Japanese to the 
following Chinese game, which I have occasionally seen played by 
the clerks in Chinese stores in our cities. 

SHINCI KUN t'o. 

Shing kun fo, the "table of the promotion of the officials," is the 
celebrated game which is best known through Dr. Hyde's account as 
''the game of the promotion of Mandarins,''' t 

It is played by two or more persons upon a large paper diagram, on 
which are printed the titles of the different officials and dignitaries of 
the Chinese Government. The movements are made by throwing dice, 
and the players, whose positions upon the diagram are indicated by 
notched or colored splints, are advanced or set back, according to 
their throws. f 

The following story was related to me concerning the invention of 
the game : 

* A paper diagram for a game of sugoroku is entitled, according to the characters 
on the sheet, Hokkaido shin do ichi ran sufioroku. or "A glance at the Hokkaido new 
road sugoroku." This game was published in 1873 ou the occasion of the opening of 
a new road tlirough the sontheru part of the island of Yesso, from Hakodate to Sap- 
poro, the capital. 

The diagram consists of an impression in colors, 32^ by 20 inches, and is divided 
into 38 parts, exclusive of the goal and starting place. These contain pictures of 
the scenery at the diffiereut stations ou the road, each division liaving a taljlet beside 
it ou which the name of the place is written, with the distance to the next stopping 
place. The game is played with 1 die, the players throwing in turn, and advanc- 
ing from the lower right-hand corner to the goal at the center. Each spot of the 
throw counts as one station on the diagram. If a player's move leaves him upon a 
division having the character tomare, " stop over," he loses his next throw. When 
a player near the goal makes a higher throw than is just necessary to take him to 
the central space, he is set back; if he. has an excess of 1, to the fifth place from the 
goal; 2, to the fourth place, and so ou.

The Emperor Kienliing (A. D. 1736-1796) was in the habit of walking at nightfall 
among the houses occupied by the candidates for the degree of Hanlin, who came 
up to Peking for the triennial examination; and hearing, night after night, the song 
of the dice issuing from one of them, he sum- 
moned the oftender before him to exjilam his 
conduct. In excuse, fearing jiunishment, he 
told the Emiieror that he had constructed a 
chart, on which were written the names of all 
the official positions in the Government, and that 
he and his friends threw dice, and according to 
their throws traversed the board, and were thus 
impressed with a knowledge of the various 
ranks and steps leading to official advancement. 
The Emperor commanded him to bring the chart 
for his inspection. That night the unfortunate 
graduate, whose excuse was a taction created at 
the moment, sat until daybreak, pencil in hand, 
and made a cliart according to his story, which 
he carried to the Emperor. That august prince 
professed to be much pleased with the diligence 
of the scholar who improved his mind, even 
while amusing himself, and dismissed him with 
many commendations. 

This familiar sounding story can not 
be accepted without question, especially 
since it will be seen that Dr. Hyde jiub- 
lished his account many years before the 
period mentioned; but my informant, a 
clerk in a Chinese shop in Philadelphia, 
may not have stated the date correctly. 

The paper charts for the game may be 
purchased at the Chinese stores in New 
York and San Francisco. The names of 
the different offices are arranged upon 
them in rectangular divisions, alongside 
of each of which is a tablet with the 
name of the board or class under which 
those within it are included. They 
ascend from the lowest to the highest 
in successive stages, arranged in order 
around the chart from right to left, and 
from the outer division, which is devoted 
to provincial officials, to the innermost, 
which has the titles of the members of 
the metropolitan administration. The 
center is occupied with rules for play- 
ing. Four dice are thrown in turn by each player, instead of G, as 
formerly recorded by Dr. Hyde. Entrance is obtained by making a 
cast, either of 4 alike, by which the player is at once advanced to an 
''hereditary rank;" of ''three, four, five, six," called cWihifd; of 3 alike

or 2 alike. All of these tlirows, in descending' order, enable the player 
to enter one of the positions from \vhi(;h advancement may be obtained. 
Subsequent promotion depends upon the tlirows, doublets enabling the 
]>]ayer to move once; .'? alike, twice; and 4 alike, 3 times. "Double fours" 
count highest, "double sixes" next, and so on down to "ones," through 
which the'player is set back. The appropriate move for eacli throw is 
indicated in small characters beneath each of the titles on tlie chart. 

A curious contrast is presented between the little sheet reproduced 
by Dr. Hyde (fig. 13), upon which only the principal officials of the 
Ming dynasty are represented, and that now current, whereon may be 
seen the innumerable ramifications of the Chinese "civil service" under 
the present Tartar domination. 

The charts such as I have seen used in the United States are printed 
in Canton, and bear an impression about 23 inches square. They 
are divided into 63 compartments, exclusive of the central one and 
the place for entering at the lower right-hand corner. The latter 
contains the names of 13 different starting places from ymi shany, or 
"honorary licentiate," down to fund *'/'f"'i/, or "student," between 
which are included the positions of fin man shawj, " astrologer," and 
i shang, "physician." These are entered at the commencement of the 
game by the throws of " three, four, five, six," 3 " fours," 3 " sixes," 3 
" fives," 3 "threes," 3 "twos," and 3 "ones;" and then in the same 
manner double "fours," and so on down to double "ones." 

The 03 compartments, representing as many classes of officials or 
degrees of rank, comprise 397 separate titles, of which the highest, and 
the highest goal of the game, is that of man fa tin tdi hok sz\ or " grand 
secretary." This, however, under favorable conditions, can only be 
reached by a player who starts from a favorable point, advancement 
in the game being regulated by rules similar to those which actually 
regulate promotion under the Government. Thus a player whose 
fortune it is to enter as a physician or astrologer can only obtain pro- 
motion in the line of his service, and nuist be content with a minor 
goal, as he is ineligible to the high civil office of "grand secretary." 

The dice are thrown into a bowl placed in the center of the sheet, 
the players throwing in turn, and each continuing to throw until he 
has made a cast of doublets or higher. It is noticeable that " fours," 
as in Dr. Hyde's account, constitute the highest throw. A pair of 
"fours," according to the rules, is to be reckoned as talc, " virtue," and 
leads to a higher place than those of other numbers. "Sixes" are 
next highest, and are to be reckoned as tv'oi, "genius;" and in the 
same manner, in descending degree, "fives" are to be reckoned as 
Mng, "skill;" "threes" as leung, "forethought;" "twos" as yaii, 
"tractability;" and "ones," chong, "stupidity." 

The game is much complicated by being played for money or counters, 
which is necessary under the rules. \\y this means advancement may 
be purchased, degradation compounded for, and the winner of a high 
position rewarded.

The main point of difference in the game as it exists to-day and as 
described by Dr. Hyde is in the number of dice employed. The 
enlarged form of the diagram is of minor importance, as he himself 
says that the names of the officials written on the tablet are many or 
few, according to the pleasure of the players. 

The game of .shing lihi fo and the Jai)anese game of many stations, 
described under the name of sugorolu, I regard as having been derived 
from the ancient Tartar game played Avith staves, which exists at the

jiresent day in Korea under the name of nyout-nol-M. As to the back- 
gammon game, which I consider to be a develojmieut of the same game, 
and which I have described as existing in Korea, China, Japan, Siam, 
and the Malay Peninsula, I am uncertain whether it is indigenous, has 
come over from India, or been acquired from the Portuguese or Span- 
iards in the fifteenth or sixteenth century.

The po tsz\ or covered die, is not, proi)erly, a die at all. It consists 
of a small wooden cube (fig. Ha), which is i^laced in a square recep-

tbe cube fitted was sligbtly convex on tbe bottom, and, wben placed 
upon a smootb surface, could be twirled rapidly. Tbe game is i^layed 
by placing tbe box containing tbe pb in tbe center of a square crossed 
by diagonal lines, wbicb is drawn upon a mat. One of tbe four 
divisions of tbe square is painted red. Tbe players lay tbeir bets upon 
tbe otber divisions, and tbe box is spun rapidly by tbe gamekeeper, 
wbo repeats tbe operation until it comes to rest squarely witb tbe cor- 
ners corresponding witb tbe intersecting bnes. Tbe cover is tben lifted, 
and tbose wbo bave staked ojiposite tbe red side of tbe die win. Tbe 
banker wins wben tbe red side comes opposite tbe side of tbe square 
painted red.* Tbere is said to be a current notion, amounting to a 
superstition among tbe Cbinese in Jobore, tbat if a player stops tbe 
box as it is spinning tbe luck will surely go against bim.

Anotber specimen in tbe Sultan's collection, called at Jobore, l;ong 
poll (Obinese fung po), " current treasure," furnishes an explanation ot 
the name po. It consists of a wooden die (fig. 15((), witb a face 1|

witb a broad base (fig. loh). A wooden cover (fig. 15 c) fits over tbe

it, and tbere adjusted by the gamekeeper. Tbe face of the wooden 
die is carved witb tbe characters fang po (fig. 15 a), on one side in the

are duplicated are paired with their doubles, aud form a series or 
suite, to which they give the name of man^ "civil," while the remain- 
ing 10 pieces are paired with each other, in accordance with the sum 
of their spots, and from a suite called wo, "military." 
The man pieces, in the order of their rank, are: 

6-6, called /'('/(, •' hea\ en." 

1-1, called ti, '• earth."' 

4-4, called yan, '"mau." 

1-3, called wo, ''liariiiouy."

in the order "iven, except those which compose the pair called chi tsiin, 
which together form the highest pan-, but separately are the lowest of 
the mo series. 

The arrangement of the dominoes called skeiing tuny, or " stack," at 
the opening of games, is shown in tig. 19. 

Tif u. 

A simple game called thi it, "to angle," is played by 2 or 3 persons 
with 2 sets of dominoes. The pieces are well mixed and piled face 
down, side \>y side, m a stack 4 high. Four piles of 4 each are now 
drawn from one end of the stack and placed face up on the table. 
When 2 play, both players draw 3 piles (12 dominoes), or if 3 play, 2 
l)iles (8 dominoes) from the same end of the stack. The i)layers then 
examine their pieces, and the tirst player endeavors to mate one of 
his pieces with one having the same number of spots among those 



512 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

turned up ou the table. If successful, he places the mated pair, face 
up, before him. lu either case he draws the bottom piece of the pile 
at the end of the stack from which the last piles were drawn and 
endeavors to mate it with one of those on the table. If successful, he 
takes the pair, but if not, he places the piece drawn among those on the 
table. The second player then tries to mate one of his pieces, and 
also (IraM'S one from the stack, and the game is continued in this man- 
ner until the stack is exhausted. A pair of double "sixes" in a 
players hand is at once laid out. If a player holds a piece in his hand, 
identical with 2 pieces on the table, and the fourth piece of the same 
kind has not been played, he may, at his turn, pile the 3 i)ieces that 
are alike one upon the other, with the uppermost face up, at the oppo- 
site end of the stack to that drawn from, and the player who first lays 
out the fourth piece may take the 3 pieces. The 2 pieces composing 
the chi isiln mate with each other, and form an exception in this game 
to the rule by which all pieces having the same number of spots mate 
with each other without reference to their belonging either to the man 
or wto series. When the last domino is drawn, the players examine 
those they have taken. The pieces on which the spots number 8 or 
more are called tdi ii, "large fish," and count 2 points for each spot. 
The pieces below 8 are called sai it, " small lish," and count 1 point for 
each red spot. If this latter sum is between 2 decades, the highest 
decade is counted. The player counting the highest becomes the win- 
ner, and is paid by each of the players for each point he has in excess. 

TS'l^NG SHAP. 

Ts'ung shaj), " to dispute tor tens," is played by 2 persons with 1 set 
of dominoes. The pieces are piled face down, side by side, in a stack 
4 pieces high, which the players divide between them, each player 
taking 8 of the 16 piles. The first player draws the top piece from the 
end pile towards the right of his pile, and lays it face up ou the table. 
The second i)layer, iu turn, draws a piece and lays it face up alongside 
of the piece played by the first player. The players continue to draw 
and place the pieces ou the table in this manner either on the right or left 
of the row thus formed. If a player lays down a piece which is a dupli- 
cate of one of the pieces at either end of the row, he takes both pieces, 
called tin, a " pair," and they count 10 for each spot on them at the end 
of the game. Or, if a player lays down a piece on which the spots, 
added to those on 2 pieces at one end of the row, or on the pieces at 
each end, form a sum that is a multiple of 10, the player takes the 3 
I)ieces, and they count 1 for each spot on them at the end of the game. 
If there are but 2 pieces on the table, and a player takes them, he piles 
them upon each other to mark the play, called tdj) K, literally "to tread 
on earth," i. e. a " sweep," which counts 40. The winner draws and lays 
out another piece. Should he fail to take up a winning combination of 



CHINESE GAMES WITH DICE AND DOMINOES. 513 

2 or 3 pieces, liis opponent may take it, and follow by laying out a piece 
and continuing tbe game. The game proceeds until one of the players 
has laid out all of his pieces, when the one who counts highest 
wins. 

k'ap tai shap. 

Khn tai shap, " to grasp many tens;" 67/'i tdi shap, "to grasp many 
tens ; " K''ap tdi shap, " to complete many tens ; " is played by any number 
of persons from 2 to 20 and upward, and is the favorite game with 
dominoes in the Chinese gambling houses in the United States. In 
many of these houses a large table covered with matting to deaden 
the sound is kept apart for this game. As there played, many sets of 
dominoes are used which are well mixed by the players and piled faces 
down, side by side, in piles 5 pieces high in a long stack upon the table. 
The croupier, or one of the players, shakes 4 dice under a cup, and 
counts around to the right, commencing with the player on his right, 
up to the number thrown. The one at whom he stops becomes the first 
player. The top piece on the third j^ile from one end of the stack, with 
each alternate piece on the top up to the number of persons playing, 
less'one, is now removed and placed in a pile at the other end of the 
stack. The first player takes 2 piles at the end and gets 10 pieces; the 
second player on his right takes the 2 next piles and gets 9 pieces, and 
so on, each player except the first getting 9 j)ieces. 

In this game each piece in a set of dominoes may be mated with a 
dui)licate piece to form a pair called ngdu, " eye." The ngdn or eyes 
thus formed by the pieces on the left (pi. 6) are called iln ngdn or 
"weak eyes," while those formed by the pieces on the right are called 
ngdng ngdn, or " strong eyes." The object of the game is to get 10 
pieces in each of which 2 are the same and form either an iln or ngdng 
ngdn, and the others form 4 pairs, in each of which the sum of the 
spots is 10 or a multiple of 10, whence the name of the game. The 
j)iece 2-4 is only counted as 3 in making up tens. 

The players examine their pieces, and the first player if he has not 
drawn a winning hand, discards a piece which he throws face up on 
the table. The next player to the right may take this piece to comi)lete 
a winning hand, or in exchange for a piece from his hand, which he 
places face up on the table. He also draws a piece from the bottom of 
the exposed pile of the stack. If it does not complete a winning hand 
he may either throw it face up on the table, or keep it and discard a 
piece from his hand. The third player may now take one of the pieces 
on the table and draw one from the bottom of the exposed pile. The 
game proceeds in this way until one of the players gets 10 pieces, of 
which 2 form a ngdn, and the others pairs on which the sum of the 
spots is 10 or a multiple of 10 and wins the game. 

In gambling houses the stakes are placed in a box on the table at

the commencement of each game, the players all contributing the same 
amount. Five per cent is at once taken from the box for the gambling 
house, and the remainder goes to the successful player. 

k'ap shap. 

K''ap shap, ''to complete tens;" K'lm shap, " to grasp tens;" Shap 
/s«i, "little tens." ICap shap corresponds with the preceding game 
and is the name given to it when played by 2 persons. One set of 
dominoes are used and the pieces are arranged in a stack 4 high. The 
first player takes 8 and the second 7 pieces. The object of the game 
is to get 8 pieces, 2 of which form a ngdii, or pair, and the others pairs 
on which the sum of the spots is 10 or a multiple of 10. In this game, 
as in A;'rt7> fdi shap, a winning hand is required to contain 1 lujdn, or 
" eye." Slight variations from the manner here described occur in 
playing these games. The first player is frequently determined by 
drawing a domino and counting around, instead of by throwing dice. 

nau t'in kau. 

N'aii tHn Icau, literally "turning heavens and nines," from the names of 
the highest pieces of the 2 suits, is played by 2 jjersons. One set of 
dominoes are used, which are piled face down in a stack 4 high. The 
first player draws the top domino from the end of the stack toward his 
right, and the second player the one beneath it. The second player 
must draw a higher domino of the same suit, either man or mo, or the 
first player takes both ])ieces and places them on the table before him, 
with the face of the winning i^iece exposed on top. The winner con 
tinues drawing first until the other player draws a higher [)iece, when 
the latter takes both pieces and has the lead. The game is continued 
in this way until the stack is exhausted. Each of the players then 
counts the red spots on the exposed faces of the dominoes before him 
and the one having the highest total becomes the winner, and is paid 
for each red spot he has in excess by the loser. 

TA t'in kau. 

Td fin kau, "to play neavens and nines," called, like the preceding 
game from the names of the highest pieces of the two suits, is the best 
and most highly developed of the Chinese games with dominoes. It is 
played by 4 persons with 1 set of dominoes. The 32 pieces are arranged 
face down in a stack 4 high to form 8 piles of 4 pieces each. One 
of the plaj^ers throws 2 dice, and counts around to determine who shall 
be the first player. He is called tso chong, " builder of the barn," or 
chong M, and usually places some object on the table before him to 
indicate his position, A disk of wood inscribed with the character 
chong frequently accompanies sets of dominoes for this purpose. The 
first player takes 2 piles of dominoes. If the dice fall near one end of 
the stack of dominoes, the first i)liiyer takes the 2 piles at that end.

Method of pairing Chinese Dominoes in the game of Kap t'ai shap. 



CHINESE GAMES WITH DICE AND DOMINOES. 515 

tlie player oii his right the next li piles; the third player to the right, 
the next two, and the fourth player the remaining rows. But if the 
dice fall near the middle of the stack, the first player takes the 2 
middle rows; the player on his right the piles on the right and left of 
the middle ones, the third player the piles outside of these, and the 
fourth player the piles at the ends. The first player leads by placing 
1, 2, 3, or 4 pieces face up on the table. One piece of either suit may 
be thus led, and a higher piece of the same suit will be required to 
take it; or a pair of either suit may be led, and a higher pair of the 
same suit will be required to take it; or one or both pieces of the first, 
second, third, or fourth pair of one suit (see pi. 5) may be led with 
one or both pieces of the corresx)onding pair of the other suit, and 2 
3, or 4 pieces of corresponding higher pairs will be required to take 
them. That is, one or both of the 6-6 may be led with one or both of 
the pair 6-3, 4-5, and the pair of 1-1 with one or both of the pair 6-2, 5-3, 
and vice versa. 

The other players follow from right to left, by playing as many pieces 
as are led, putting them on top of those on the table if they are higher, 
or beneath if they are lower than those already played. They are not 
required to follow suit. The winner leads again, and the game is con- 
tinued until all the dominoes have been played. The player who takes 
the last round wins the game. He becomes the tsd ehong for the next 
game. It is required of the winner, however, to take at least 2 tricks, 
so that if only 1 piece is led on the last round a player who has not 
won a trick is not allowed to take the trick, and the game goes to the 
next higher player. Td fin kau is invariably i)layed for money. A 
trick counts 1 point, for which any sum may be agreed upon. At the 
end of the game the players each pay the winner according to the 
number of tricks they have taken. The holder of 4 or more tricks pays 
nothing; of 2 tricks, for 2 points; of 1 trick, for 3 points, and a player 
who does not take a trick for 5 points. The first player, or tsd chong, 
however, always pays twice the amount when he loses, and is paid 
double when he wins, and so on throughout the game, paying and 
receiving in every case twice as much as the other players. Should 
the tsd chong, through winning the last round, hold his position over into 
the next game, his gains and losses are then in the ratio of 3 to 1 to 
those of the other i>layers. In the third game they would be as 4 to 1, 
and so on. 

If any player except the first player wins a round with the pair 2-4 
1-2, called chi tsiiuj the first player must pay him 4 times, and the 
other players twice the sum agreed upon for 1 point; but if the first 
player takes a round with the chi tsiin, the other players must pay him 
4 times the value of a point. 

If any player except the first takes a round with 4 pieces of 2 
corresponding pairs, the first player pays him 8 times and the other 
])layers 4 times the value of a point, but if the first player takes the 
round the other players pay hmi S times the value of a point. 



516 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 



If a player takes 2 rounds with the chi tsiin or 2 rounds with 2 
corresponding pairs in 2 successive games, the amounts that must be 
paid him by the other players are doubled, and if he takes 3 such rounds 
in succession they are trebled. In gambling houses the winner of a 
round with the chi tsiin must put the value of I point and the winner 
with 2 corresponding pairs of 2 points in a box for the house. This 
constitutes the only revenue derived by gambling houses from thegame. 

It is said that the custom of requiring the winner to take at least 2

taking the last trick became the winner, although it was the only trick 
taken by him during the game.

Combinations of Dominoes, significant in fortune telling.

the fourth row, D, E, F of the fifth row, and G, H, I, K of the sixth 
row. The piece A is then placed transversely, face up, across the top 
of the oi'igiual j)yramid, and the other pieces that were withdrawn 
formed into a line, face up, at its base; the pairs G-H and I-K being 
put at the ends, D and F within them, B, C next within and E in the 
middle, as in the diagram on the right of tig. 20. The players then 
proceed to mate the pieces that are faceup, according to the arrangement 
found on pi. 5. When no more pairs can be made with the exposed 
pieces the outside piece on the right of the second row from the top 
may be reversed. If it can not be paired it is left in its place, but if 
mated the outside piece on the third row is liberated, and may be 
reversed, and so on. When the right-hand side is blocked, the piece 
on the left of the second row may be reversed, and the same plan followed 
as before. When the piece A is mated the two pieces beneath it may 
be reversed ; and the removal of the two pieces at the ends of the lowest 
row, as G H, permits the pieces directly above them to be reversed. 
The i^rocess is continued until the game is blocked, or the player has 
mated all the pieces comprising the x)yramid. 

This game is said to be used in divination, the success or failure in 
mating all the pieces being regarded as furnishing a clew to the deter- 
mination of the event under consideration. 

rORTUNE TELLING WITH DOMINOES. 

Dominoes are regularly used in fortune telling in China at the present 
day, and their use for this i)urj)ose is generally known to the laborers 
who come to America. I have before me a book entitled Kgd p'di slum 
shb fo chii ts'eung Mi, "■ a chart for finding out the numbers by divine 
aid and with ivory dominoes, with an explanation and commentary." 
This work was printed in Canton in 1865, the name of the author 
being given as Ch'ing Ngok. The preface, which professes to exjolain 
the attributes and astrological significance of the dominoes, is followed 
by a series of diagrams illustrating different combinations formed with 
dominoes taken three, or in one class, two at a time. Specimens of the 
different classes are represented in pi. 7. 

The following names and numerical values are given to them: 

pat fung, "unlike," counts 6. 

hop lidu, "ingeniously divided," counts 4. 

'ng tsz', "five spots," counts 5. 

fan sheung, " divided reciprocally," counts 3. 

via kwan, " cavalry," counts 3. 

i sdm luk, "two, three, six," counts 3. 

iu i sdm, "ace, tvro; three," counts 3. 

tiii tsz', " corresponding spots," counts 3. 

ching fdi, "correctly satisfied," counts 1. 

In telling fortunes an entire set of dominoes is placed face down upon 
a table and well mixed. The dominoes are then all placed side by side 
in a row and reversed. The manipulator selects from this row as many 



518 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

combinations as possible, formed by adjacent pieces, according to the 
diagrams, and adds together the numbers corresponding with them. 
This sum is referred to the following table and result noted: 

1 to 4 is to be esteemed hd hd, " lowest." 
5 to 7 is to be esteemed chung hd, "below the middle." 
8 to 9 is to be esteemed chum/ p'ing, " even middle." 
10 to 11 is to be esteemed sheung sheting, " highest." 

The dominoes are then reversed again and mixed, and the preceding 
operations twice repeated, and 3 sets of terms from the above series 
obtained. Reference is then made to the text of the book. This con- 
sists of 125 pages, arranged in order under all the different combina- 
tions that may be formed with the 5 i>airs of terms given above, taken 
3 pairs at a time, commencing with sheung sheung, shewing sheung, sheung 
sheung. An oracular verse, apparently of original composition, is found 
on each page, referring to some well-known personage or incident, with a 
short text to aid the diviner in applying the prognostication to the various 
affairs of life. 

DOMINOES FROM FUHCHAU. 

Before proceeding to discuss the origin and antiquity of the Chinese 
game, an account will be given of dominoes used in other parts of China, 
and among the people of the adjacent countries. 

A set of dominoes from Fuhchau* in the Oriental Section of the 
Museum of Archieology and Palaeontology of the University of Pennsyl 
vauia is made of bamboo and numbers 32 pieces. They measure f ^ 
by fl by -^| inch, and have slightly curved faces that follow the natural 
curve of the reed. The concave faces are marked with incised spots 
that are painted red and green, and are arranged in the Chinese series 
(iig. 17), green taking the place of black spots. These dominoes are 
accompanied with 16 wooden disks resembling draughtsmen, an inch 
in diameter, the faces of which are reproduced in plate 8. They 
each bear a Chinese character referring to one of the 16 pairs formed 
with the 32 dominoes.t Four of these, fm, ti, yan, and wo, are the same 

* Received through the courtesy of J. P. Cowles, esq., U. S. vice-consul, Fuhchau. 

tProf. Rudolfo Lauciani, iu the Atheuieum, January 7, 1888, gave an account of 
the discovery of a tomb iu Perugia twenty-one centuries old, in which an inveterate 
gamlder had been buried together with his gambling apparatus. Aniong other 
remarkable sets were "16 tesserw, or labels, cut in bone, 4 inches long, with a word 
engraved on one side and a numlter on the other." The imi^ortanceof the discovery 
is concentrated on the words and numbers engraved on the bone labels. The ancients 
used to give a special name to a certain number, or addition of numbers, which they 
obtained by throwing the dice. * * * As regards the newly discovered labels, it 
appears that any number from 1 to 12 was considered a very bad throw, and conse- 
quently the corresponding words or names were very objectionable indeed {Moechus 
Vappa, ect.). The "13" is neither good nor bad; hence its name, vix rides, "you 
hardly smile." The names corresponding to higher numbers are all of good omen, 
such as benignua (25), amator (30), and/e/ix (60), wliich seems to be the maximum of 
the game discovered at Perugia." While the agreement of number of tablets in this 
Etruscan series with those in the Chinese is probably a mere coincidence, it is curious to 
note the occurrence of such similar usages in ages and countries so widely separated.

Korean Dominoes

as those used to designate the four highest pieces iu the man series, 
plate 5, but the remainder, iu place of the vulgar names usually given 
to the other j)airs, have the characters shii, ngau,fu, to, lung, she, nid, 
yeung, hau, lai, hiin, and chii, which represent the names "rat," "ox,'' 
"tiger," "hare," "dragon," "serpent," "horse," "goat," "monkey," 
" cock," "dog," and "pig," the 12 animals of the duodenary cycle.* I 
understand these discs are used in connection with a kind of lottery. 

I am informed that bamboo dominoes, similar to the above, are used 
at Shanghai, and at all the Chinese ports from Fuhchau northward. 

There are several very interesting sets of Chinese dominoes from 
Fuhchau in the museum of the Long Island Historical Society, Brooklyn, 
N. Y, t One of these sets (A) consists of 120 marked pieces and 
2 blanks. They are made of bamboo, faced with bone or ivory, which 
is attached to the wood with glue, or, in the case of one of the sets, 
with small brass pins. The pieces measure about t ^y I by f inch. 
This set is composed : iirst, of 3 suits of 21 pieces marked with black 
and red dots, each comprising the Chinese series without the dupli- 
cates; second, of 2 suits of 21 pieces, similarly marked with black and 
red dots with the addition of ornamental devices of flowers in red and 
green; third, of 1 suit of 21 pieces, each with double sets of dots, 1 
set being placed at each end of the pieces, and between certain devices 
in red and green, comprising the emblems of the Eight Genii, the 
characters for "sun" and "moon," a tiger, and various flowers. 

A similar set was exhibited by W. H. Wilkinson, esq.. Her British 
Majesty's consul-general, Seoul, Korea, in his collection in the section of 
games at the Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893. They were from 
Shanghai, and designated as Hua ho {fd ho) ' 'flower harmony." f 

Another set (B) in the museum of the Long Island Historical Society 
comprises 141 marked pieces and 2 blanks. They are made of bamboo 
with a bone or ivory face, which is skillfully mortised to the wood, and 
measure J by ^ by f inch. This set is composed : 

First, of 1 suits of 9 pieces each, marked in red, green, and blue, 
with from 1 to 9 circles. 

Second, of 1 suits of 9 pieces each, marked in red and green, with 
from 1 to 9 narrow rectangles. 

Third, of 4 suits of 9 pieces each, marked with the characters yat 
man, "one ten thousand," to Mu man, or "nine ten thousand." The 
characters for "one" to "nine " are in blue, and that for man, "ten thou- 
sand," is in red. 

Fourth, of 4 pieces marked ^aA;, "north," in blue; of 4 pieces marked 
nam, "south," in blue; of 4 pieces marked tung, "east," iu blue; of 4

marked ts^aUj "autumn," in red; 1 piece marked tnng, "winter." 

Fifth, ot' 8 blank pieces. 

A set nearly identical with this was also exhibited by Mr. Wilkinson. 
It lacked the pieces designated as "rulers of the five directions," the 
fin, ti, yan, and wo wong, and the 4 pieces with the names of the sea- 
sons. It had, however, 4 pieces bearing- the character fat. This set 
was from Ningpo, and was designated by Mr. Wilkinson as chung fa 
{chnng fat). "The coloring," he states, "whether in red, green, or 
blue, is purely ornamental, and has nothing to do with the play of the 
game.* 

Another set (C), from Fuhchau, in the museum of the Long Island 
Historical Society, is made entirely of bamboo. This set is composed 
of 32 pieces, measuring § by 1% by --^ inch. They are inscribed on one 
face with the usual dots and the characters that represent the names 
of the pieces of the Chinese.game of chess, tseung ¥i. 

These marks are arranged as follows : 

6-6 6-6, A;(V, "chariot," in red. 
1-1 1-1, tseung, " elephant," in green. 
4-4 4-4, A"i7, "chariot," in red. 
1-3 1-3, seuny, " elephant," iu red. 
5-5 5-5, tsut, " soldier," iu red. 
3-3 3-3, ping, " soldier," iu green. 
2-2 2-2, ss\ " secretary," iu green. 
5-6 5-6, md, " horse," in green. 
4-6 4-6, md, "horse," in red. 
1-6 1-6, tsut, "soldier," iu red. 
1-5 1-5, tsut, "soldier," iu red. 
6-3 4-5, sz', " secretary," iu red.

2-3, tsut, "soldier," in red. 
2-4, tseung, "general," iu green. 
1-2, shui, " general," in red. 

Mr. Himlyt describes a set of Chinese bamboo dominoes, 32 in the 
set. with the characters of the chessmen, which is identical with the

preceding, except for slight variations in tlie association of the names 
of the chessmen on the dotted pieces. He offers it in explanation of 
the number, 32, of the domino game, and says that it could only have 
been made to save space while traveling. As in the preceding, the 32 
dominoes do correspond, piece for piece, with the 32 men in the Chinese 
game of chess. It is clear that the devices on some, at least, of the other 
decorated dominoes were copied from playing cards, those on the set A 
being identical in number as well as in devices with a set of the dotted 
cards from Fuhchau in the same collection, while the set B has the 
names of the familiar suit marks, j>iH$r, sole, and man, of the cards; 
hence it is possible that the "chess dominoes" were imitated from the 
corresponding "chess cards," and that the true explanation of the 
number of the domino pieces must be found elsewhere. 

Mr. W. H. Wilkinson also exhibited at the Columbian Exposition a 
set of dominoes from Wenchow, called hua tang chiu, " flowery tang 
»chiu." They consist of 5 suits of 21 pieces each and 17 extra pieces 
(total, 122) and 4 blanks. The extra pieces are (1) G-O 6-3, (2) 1-1 1-3, 
(3^ 4_4 1-3, (4) 2-4 4-4, (5) 3-3 5-6, (6) 1-2 2-2, (7) 1-2 2-4, (8) 4-5 5-5, 
(9), (10), (11) 3 pieces marked with the sequence 1-6 — that is, 1-4 2-6 
3-5 ; 1-6 2-5 3-4; 1-5 2-3 4-6, and 6 pieces bearing the characters 
{a) wen, "civilian;" {b) wu, "military;" (c) tsung, "universal;" (^)t'ai, 
" highness;" {e) ho, " lily;" (/) p'ei, " heap up." " The blanks are used 
only to replace cards lost." The material was wood, stained black, 
with incised spots, painted white and red. " The coloring of the cards 
is immaterial." They measured 1 by f| by -^g inch, and the inner face 
was slightly concave, like the dominoes from Fuhchau, mentioned on 
page 518.* 

CH'IU p'ai. 

Another form of Chinese dominoes remains to be described which are 
current at Tientsin. There are the ch^iii p^di, "leaping dominoes," t 
which consist of 32 slips of bamboo about 14 inches in length, with the 
domino spots marked at one end, contained in a cylindrical bamboo box. 
This game is carried on by cake, candy, and fruit sellers. The player 
draws 3 of the bamboo slips, and if the 3 marks form what is described 
under the following account of Korean dominoes, pages 523, 524, as yat 
p'ai, "perfect tablets," the player wins; if not he loses. 

KOREAN DOMINOES. 

A set of Korean dominoes from Seoul (pi. 9) in the National 
Museum is made of ivory and numbers 32 pieces. They measure f by 
T^g by tV inches, and are marked with incised spots arranged according 
to the Chinese system. The "one" and "four" spots are painted red 
and all the others black, and the " one" spots are much larger than the 
others and very deeply incised. 

* Cf. Descriptive Catalogue, p. 88. 

t There is a set from Fiilicliau iu tlie museum of tlie Long Island Historical Society. 



522 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

The Koreans call dominoes Ml-hpai (Chinese kwat p''di)^ "bone tab- 
lets." A more correct name is said to be ho-hpai, (Chinese iTp^U), "bar- 
barian tablets." This latter name is also ai)p]ied to a special game. 
The 32 dominoes are paired as shown in pi. 6, those of which there are 
two being mated with each other, and those of which there are but one 
with reference to the sum of the spots, but not in the manner of the 
Chinese series (PL 5). 

The ])ieces receive the same names as those of the dice throws of 
the Korean game Ssang-ryouJc, "backgammon," viz: 

1-1, 8i/o-8yo (Chinese siii siii), "smallest." 
1-2, tjoui-hko (Chinese shit pi), "rat nose." 
1-3, syo sam (Chinese siii sdm), "small and three." 
1-4, puik s(i {Chmese pdk az'), " white and four." 
1-5, paik i {Chinese pdk 'ng), "white and five." 
1-6, piiik ryoiik (Chinese j;aA; luk), " white and six." 
2-2, tjomt-a (Chinese tsun a), "superior two." 
2-3, a sam (Chinese a sam), "two and three." 
2-4, a sd (Chinese d s~'), "two and four." 
2-5, koan-a (Chinese kitn d), "sovereign two." 
2-6, a ryoiik (Chinese d luk), "two and six." 
3-3, tjyaug-sam (Chinese ch^e'iing sdm), "long three." 
3-4, sam sd (Chinese sdm s,'), "three four."

Dominoes are regarded as a vulgar game in Korea. They are used in 
gambling houses and are not much played as a social game by the higher 
classes. 

HO-HPAI. 

The commonest Korean game of dominoes is called Eo-hpai, i. e., 
"Barbarian tablets." It is played by 3 or 4 persons. When 4 persons 
play an entire set of dominoes are used. When 3 play the following 
pieces are withdrawn : 6-6, 5-5, 4-4, and 3-3. The dominoes are turned 
face down and shuffled. On commencing to play, the players all draw 
1 piece to decide who shall play first. The one who gets the piece with 
the highest number of spots becomes tlie Tjyang-ouen (Chinese, Chong 
Un).* The pieces are again shuffled and the Tjyang-ouen draws 7 pieces 
and each of the other players 6, The Tjyang-ouen then whirls his 7 
pieces about between his fingers in the right hand until 1 piece slips 
out. This piece he turns face up. Should the piece turned up be either 
5-4, 1-2, 1-4 or 2-3 he keeps the pieces he has drawn. If it should be 
either 6-6, 5-5, 4-4, 3-3, 2-2, 1-1, 6-5, 6-4, 6-1, 5-1, or 3-1, that is to

is applied to the first of the Hanlm doctors in China.

say one of the pieces of wliich there are duplicates, he hands his 6 
pieces that are yet undisclosed to the player on his right who in turn 
gives his pieces to the player next to him, and so on until the Tjyang- 
ouen receives those of the fourth player. If on the other hand, he 
turns up either 6-3, 6-2, 5-3, 5-2, 4-3, or 4-2, he hands his 6 pieces to the 
player on the left who in turn gives his pieces to his immediate neighbor 
until the Tjyang-ouen receives those from the player on the right. The 
seventh piece that was turned up is now turned down and mixed with 
the remaining pieces, which are placed side by side in a line, and covered 
with a slip of paper, or a strip of bamboo made for the purpose. If 
the Tjyang-ouen keeps his pieces, he becomes the first player, but if he 
exchanges them, the one on the right or left to whom he gave his pieces 
becomes the first player. In this game certain combinations of 3 pieces 
are called han-hpai {Chinese ynt p' di), "perfect tablets," and the object 
of the game is to get 2 such combinations. The game is then spoken of 
as hte-tjye-ta, ''broken". Hohpai is played for money and a certain 
stake agreed upon, the player winning once, twice, thrice, four or five 
times this amount for each player, according to the combination which 
composes his winning hand. These combinations and the numbers they 
count are as follows : 

(1) A sequence, as 1-3, 2-4, 5-6, called ssang-syo-han-hpai (Chinese, 
sheung tsil yatp'di)., counts 3 in combination with another ssang-syo, and 
1, in combination with any other hanhpai. A ssang-syo composed of 6 
pieces, which pair according to the Korean system, is called tdi-sd-ttai 
(Chinese, fui sz^ tai), literally, "corresponding four times," and counts 
4, the name referring to the count. 

(2) The sequence 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, and the corresponding 
sequences in which 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2 replace the ones in this exaniple, are 
cnUed pou-tong (Chinese, j>rti f'ung), "unlike," and count as follows: 

1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6 counts 3. 
2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6 eouuts 5. 
3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4. 3-5, 3-6 counts 3. 
4-1, 4-2, 4-3, 4-4, 4-5. 4-6 counts 3. 
5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 5-4, 5-5, 5-6 counts 4. 
6-1. 6-2, 6-3, 6-4, 6-5, 6-6 counts 3. 

(3) The sequence 1-2, 3-6, 4-5, 1-4, 2-6, 3-5, called hoUsmng-syo (Chi- 
nese, tukshenng tsii), " solitary double sequence, "counts 5. 

(4) Two doublets, and 1 piece upon which the sum of the spots, or 1 
of the 2 sets of spots is equal to the single number of the doublets, as 
1-4, 5-5, 5-5, or 4-2, 4-4, 4-4, called soA- (Chinese, noi), "inclosed," 
counts 1, both when paired with another sok or any other hanhpai. A 
hanhpai composed of sixes is called ryonl--soTi; of fives, o-sok; of fours, 
hong-soJc; of threes, sam-sok; of twos, a-sok, and of ones, pdik-sok. 

(5) Three pieces upon which the spots are equally divided between 
2 numbers, as 4-4, 2-4, 2-2, called tai-sam-tong (Chinese, tui sdni fung)y 
"three alike, opi»osite," count 1. 



524 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

(6) The combination G-G, 5-5, 4-4, called ro4n (Chinese, Id yan), "old 
man," counts 3 when combined with itself and 1 with any other han- 
hpai. The combination 3-3, 2-2, 1-1, called a-M (Chinese, a chi), 
"child," counts 3 when combined with itself and 1 with any other 
hanh2)ai. 

(7) The combination G-G, 3-3, 2-2, called ssang-pyen (Chinese, sheung 
pm), "doublets," counts 3 when combined with itself and 1 with any 
other hanhpui. The combinations 2-3, 3-1, 1-2, and 4-5, 5-G, 4-G, 
called Yo-Soun^ count 3 when combined with each other and 1 in com- 
bination with any other han-hpai. 

As the soli are combinations which may be formed very easily, it is 
sometimes agreed to play without them. If the first player has not 
■drawn a winning hand he puts down a piece from his hand at the end 
that is nearest to him of the concealed row and takes up the piece at 
the other end, at the same time-sliding the row of pieces along, so that 
the piece he puts down is concealed, and the piece he takes up is exjjosed. 
If he then does not make a winning combination, the next player, if he 
has not already a winning combination, puts down a piece and takes up 
another as before, and this is continued until some one obtains a win- 
ning combination, and so wins the game. He then becomes the Tjyang- 
ouen in the next game. 

TJAK-MA-TCHI-KI. 

Tjak-ma-tcM-Jci, "i^air making," is played by 2, 3, or 4 jjersons. The 
pieces are reversed and shuffled and covered with paper. The first 
player draws G and the other i)layers each draw 5 dominoes. The first 
player endeavors to play out a pair from those he has drawn, but if he 
is unsuccessful he lays out 1 piece face up on the table. The second 
player takes up the piece discarded if he can combine it with a domino 
in his hand to form a pair. If not, he draws a piece from those left 
under the paper, and discards a domino, which he lays out face up. 
This process is continued around until 1 player gets 3 jiairs in his hand, 
and becomes the winner. When 2 or 3 play, the 6-G can not be played 
to complete the third pair, but when 4 play it may thus be played 
and the winner must be paid alone by the player who discarded the 
corresponding piece. 

If the pair is completed by a piece drawn from the unused pile, all 
the other players pay the winner, but if it is completed by a piece which 
has been discarded, the player who discarded that piece alone pays the 
winner. It is sometimes agreed that the third pair by which a player 
wins must be completed with a piece drawn from the unused pile. 

KKO-RI-POUT-TCHI-KI, 

Kko-ri-povt-tchi-ki, "tail joining," is played by 2, 3, or 4 persons; 3 or 4 
usually play. The set of dominoes are reversed and shuffled and each 
player draws 8 dominoes. When 3 play, the pieces G-G, 5-5, 4-4, and 



CHINESE GAMES WITH DICE AND DOMINOES. 525 

3-3 are first withdrawn. The game is begun by someone asking who 
has the Tcoan a ? The holder of this piece, the 5-2, lays down any 
piece he may select from his hand, face up, at the same time crying out 
a number on one side of it, which number must be paired. The next 
player must mate the side designated with one of his pieces, but if 
unable to do so, must lay a piece from his hand, face down on the table. 
The game is continued around until all have been paired or all have 
laid down their pieces. Then each counts the spots on the pieces they 
have been compelled to lay down, which naturally have been selected 
from those with the fewest spots in their hands, and the one who has the 
highest number of spots pays the one who has the lowest number of 
spots. When 4 play, all players who count more than 30 must pay; 

KOL-YE-SI.* 

Kol-ye-si is played by two or more persons, not exceeding ten. The 
set of dominoes is placed face down and shuffled, and i;)art, if not all 
of the set, are placed end to end in an irregular line. One of the 
players acts as banker, Moul-tjyou (Chinese, Mat chii "things' ruler"). 
The other players each draw 1 piece in turn from the line. They exam- 
ine this piece and each put whatever stake they choose on the piece 
drawn. The Moul-tjyou puts down the same amount, whatever it may 
be, beside each j)layer's stake and takes the next 2 pieces. If his pieces 
are identical, a perfect pair, he at once wins all that has been staked. 
Otherwise the other players draw in turn either 1 or 2 pieces from 
the line. This done, they and the J/oj<7-/(?/o« turn their pieces face up. 
They all count the spots on their dominoes. The remainders, after deduc- 
ting the tens, count, and if the Moul-tjyou has an excess over that of 
any player, he takes the stakes, but if a i^layer has an excess over that 
of the Moul-tjyou when the tens are deducted from the sum of the spots, 
that player wins the amount of the stake he has staked. 

This is a common game in gambling houses. It is customary to keep 
a water jar there, in which the i)layers voluntarily put a portion of 
their stakes before the result is disclosed, or, if unmindful, at the sug- 
gestion of some one interested in the house. 

RYONG-HPAI. 

Dominoes are used in Korea as in China in playing solitaire, which, 
as in China, is a favorite kind of sortilage, not regarded seriously, but 
often j)layed at the beginning of the day, the player wishing for a happy 
omen. The solitaire game described under the name of hoi fdp, 
page 516, is known under the name of Ryong-hpai (Chinese, lung p''di)y 
"Dragon tablets," while another arrangement is shown in fig. 20. 



^Kol-ye-si means Ml {lipai) or "domiuo" ye-si, the latter being the name of a 
game played with cards.

KE-POUK-HPAI. 

In this sj'Steiu, called kepouk-hpai (Chinese, hwai p^di), "Tortoise 
tablets," the 32 dominoes are laid face down to form a representation 

of a tortoise (fig. 21), with 2 pieces 
at head and tail and 2 for legs at 
each of the 4 corners. The pieces 
at these extremities are turned 
face up, followed by those marked 
A, B, C, I), and mated according to 
the Korean system, (pi. 9). The 
player loses when he fails to mate 
all the pieces. 

SIN-SYO-TYEN. 

Sin-syo-tyen (Chinese, sh<in sho 
chim), "personally counting divi- 
nation," is a kind of fortune telling; 
practiced with dominoes. The in- 
quirer shuffles a set of dominoes 
face down and arranges them side 
by side in a line. He then turns 
them face up, preserving the ar- 
rangement, and selects as many of 
the combinations referred to on 
pages 523, 524, as can be formed by 

contiguous pieces. The sum of the numbers there given, in connection 

with the combinations thus formed is noted, 

and the operation twice repeated. The three 

results are added together, and if their sum 

amounts to 32, the number of the domino pieces, 

the augury is very good; more or less being 

estimated proportionally good or indifferent.

Another popular method of divination with

An entire set of 8 dominoes is reversed and

have been described under ho-hpal In addi 
tion to the han-hpai already enumerated, pages 
523, 524, the following additional ones are permitted in oloan: Three

spots is equal to i), called H<im-1on<j-tan-o-Uiem (Cbiiiese sdm fung idn'ng 
f()u), " three alike and ouly five spots,'' and 3 pieces upon wliicli 3 of 
the spots are alike and the sum of the other 3 spots is equal to or more 
than 14, called sam-tong-sip-sd-tyem (Chinese sdm fung shap sz^ tim), 
" three alike and fourteen spots." 

In forming these combinations, 3 contiguous ])ieces in a row may be 
taken, or 1 or 2 pieces at one end of a row may be used in combination 
with 2 pieces or 1 piece at the other end, the pieces thus taken being 
always placed on the inner side. Thus the piece A may be mated with 
C D to form a combination A C D, or B A may be mated with D to 
form a combination A B D. The combinations thus formed are 
removed and placed in a line face uj) above the 5 rows, the one found 
nearest the bottom being placed to the left and successive ones to the 
right of the line thus started. When no more combinations can be 
discovered, 5 pieces are*drawn from the unused pile of 12 pieces which 
have been left with their faces down, and one-of them placed face down 
to the right of each of the 5 rows. These 5 pieces are then turned face 
up, and an attempt made to form combinations of threes 'with their 
aid. The results are successively placed to the right of the line at 
the top and this process is continued until the 12- extra pieces are 
exhausted. AVhen this happens, 5 pieces are withdrawn from the left 
of the top line and added in succession to right of the 5 rows. If, by 
chance, but 4 or a less number of rows remain, only a corresponding- 
number of pieces are drawn. This process is continued over and over 
until all the jneces are combined in sets of threes in a long row at the 
top, or the top row is exhausted and a block ensues, determining suc- 
cess or failure. The name of the game is said to have been taken from 
a well-known episode in the life of Koau Ou* (Chinese, Kwdn tj), the 

*Kw:iu Yii {Kwdn tj) I). A. D. 219. Deaiguated Kwau Chwiiug Mift aud deified

rose to celebrity toward the close of the second century through his alliance with 
Lin Pei aud Chang Fei in the struggles which ushered in the period of the Tliree 
Kingdoms. He is reputed to have been, in early life, a seller of bean-curd, but to 
have subsequently applied himself to study until, in A. D. 184, he casually encoun- 
tered Liu Pei at a time when the latter was about to take up arms in defense of the 
house of Han against the rebellion of the Yellow Turbans. He joined Liu Pei and 
his confederate, Chang Fei, iu a solemn oath, which was sworn in a peach-orchard 
belongingto the latter, that they would fight hencefortli side by side aud live and die 
together. The fidelity of Kwan Yii to his adopted leaders remained unshaken dur- 
ing a long series of years in spite of many trials ; and similarly his attachment to 
Chang Fei continued throughout his life. At an early period of his career he was 
created a t'ing how (baron) by the regent Ts'ao Ts'ao, with the title of Hdn shu 
ting ban. * * * j^jy martial powers shone conspicuously in many campaigns 
which were waged by Liu Pei before his throne as sovereign of Shu became assured, 
but he fell a victim at last to tlie superior force .and strategy of Sun K'iian, who 
took him prisoner and caused him to be beheaded. Long celebrated as one of the 
most renowned among China's heroes, he was at length canonized by the superstitious 
HweiT'suug, of the Sung dynasty, early in the Twelfth century, with the title Chung 
hwui Kung. In 1128 he received the still higher title of Chwaug miu wu ngfin 
Wiiug, and after many subsequent alterations and additions he was at length raised 
in 1594 by Ming Wan Li to the rank of Ti, or God, since which date, and especially 
since the accession of the Manchow dynasty, his worshij) as the God of War has been 
firmly established. (Chinese Reader's Manual, No. 297.)

celebrated Chinese general, now universally worshiped in China as the 
God of War, and one of the heroes of the famous historical romance, 
the Sam Kwok cht, or "Annals of Three States." In escaping from 
Ts'ao Ts'ao,* it is recorded that he killed six generals at " five frontier 
passes," o-koan (Chinese 'ng kwdn). The vicissitudes of his life at 
this time are typified in the varying fortunes of the game, which at one 
moment approaches a successful termination, only for the player to be 
unexpectedly set back to overcome its obstacles anew. The conquest 
of the " five koan,^' which Eoan Ou achieved, finds it analogue in the 
5 rows of the dominoes which the player struggles to overcome. Many 
educated people play this game every morning, and scholars who have 
nothing to do play it all day long, finding intellectual pastime in its 
elusive permutations. 

BURMESE AND SHAN DOMINOES. 

A set of Burmese dominoes in the National Museum are of teak 
wood and measure 2 by 1 by f inches (pi. 10). The spots are marked 
with incised circles. They number 24 pieces, marked as follows: 6-6, 
1-1, 4-4, 1-3, o-5,.3-3, and 2-2 duplicated, and one each of the following 
pie(;es : 6-3, 4-5, 6-2, 5-3, 4-3, 5-2, 2-4, 1-4, 2-3, and 1-2, the las t having 
2 smaller spots adjoining the "1." 

They are accompanied by a cubical die about three-fourths inch 
square, with 2 opposite faces marked with 1 spot, 2 opposite faces 
marked with 2 spots, and 2 opposite faces marked with 3 spots. This 
is used to decide who shall play first. 

A set of Burmese dominoes, from Rangoon, sent to the writer by the 
Hon. Sir C. H. T. Crosth^aite, lieutenant-general Northwest Prov- 
inces, British India, are identical with the preceding, except that the 
spots are marked with small brass disks. 

A set of Burmese domiiioes in the British Museun) are made of black 
horn, and number 32 pieces. They measure If inches in length by 
three-fourths of an inch in width and have incised spots, which are 
painted red and yellow and arranged according to the Chinese system. 
The backs are uniformly marked with "1" and "3" spots composed of 
concentric circles, and the ends each bear 1 spot similarly inscribed. 
Another set of Burmese dominoes in the same collection are made of 
black wood, with the spots painted red and white. 

Dice are called anzamia (singular anzd) in Burmese. The Burmese 
dice in the museum of the University of Pennsylvania are small ivory 
cubes, regularly marked and having the fours in red, and are identical 
with the Chinese. 

A set of Shan dominoes in the British Museum, presented by Maj. 
E, B. Gladen, are identical in every respect with the horn dominoes 
from Burma in the same museum.

Siamese Dominoes. 



CHINESE GAMES WITH DICE AND DOMINOES. 529 

SIAMESE DOMINOES. 

Dominoes are called in Siamese tan tern (^Chinese td tim) "arranging 
or connecting spots.'^ Two sets of dominoes exhibited by tbe Govern- 
ment of Siam in the Section of Games at the Columbian Exposition 
consist of 24 thin rectangular tablets of ivory, one with face of |f by 
h, and the other 1|| by H inches (pi. 11). ihe "ones" and "fours" 
are marked with red and the others with black spots, in the following 
series: The pieces Q-G, 1-1, 4-4, 1-3, 5-5, 3-3, 2-2, 5-6, 4-6, 1-6, and 1-5 
duplicated, and one of each of the pieces 6-3 and 6-2. 

ESKIMO DOMINOES, 

A set of Innuit dominoes in the U. S. National Museum, Washington, 
(pi. 12), is described by Mr. Lucien Turner, who conducted the expe- 
dition for the Smithsonian Institution in 1884.* 

"The Inuuit," Mr. Turner says, " who come from the western end of Hudsou Strait, 
the so-called Northerners, have a game which they play with sets of pieces of ivory 
cut into irregular shapes, and marked on one face with spots arranged in diftereut 
patterns. The number of pieces in a set varies from 60 to 148. The name of a set 
is A ma zii a Idi, and somewhat resembles our game of dominoes. 

"The game is played in the following manner: Two or more persons, according to 
the number of pieces in the set, sit down and pile the pieces before them. One of 
the players mixes the pieces together in plain view of the others. When this is 
done he calls them to take the pieces. Each person endeavors to obtain a half or 
third of the number, if there be two.or three players. The one who mixed up the 
pieces lays down a piece and calls his opponent to match it with a piece having a 
similar design. If this can not be done by any of the players the first has to mat'ch 
it, and the game continues until one of the players has exhausted all of the pieces 
taken by him. The pieces are designated by pairs, having names such as ka miu tik 
(sled), kaiak (canoe), kale sak (navel), d ma zut (many), a tail sik (1), md kok (2), ping 
a sut (3), si td miit (4), and td H mat (5). Each of the names above must be matched 
with a piece of similar kind, although the other end of the piece may be of a diHer- 
ent design. A kamuiik may be matched with an amauit, if the latter has not a line 
or bar cut across it; if it has a bar it must be matched with an amazut. 

"This game is known to the people of the Ungava district, but those only who 
learn it from the Northerners are able to play it. The northern Eskimo stake the 
last article they possess on the issue of the game. Their-wives are disposed of tem- 
porarily, and often are totally relinquished to the victor. I have heard of wives so 
disposed of often sit down and win themselves back to their former owners." 

Dr. Franz Boas informs me that the Eskimo name for dominoes 
means "standing upright side by side." 

MISCELLANEOUS GAMES. 

Several fanciful games have come to my notice which have been 
suggested by the European domino game. In the Section of Games in 
the Department of Anthropology at the Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 
1893, a modern French game was exhibited under the name of Xe 2Iafjister 
Dominoes Geographique, consisting of oblong pieces of cardboard, each 
bearing on its face a portion of the map of the Valley of the Seine. 
It was intended to be used for teaching geography. Another game,

Imoiii the foregoing accounts it will be seen liow widely tin' i)ecnliar 
Chinese game of doininoes is <listiil)ute(l, from Korea to Durma and 
Siam. Dr. Gustav Sclilegel states that tl»e European game of dominoes 
is without doubt borrowed from the Chinese, only that in it the 
idiilosophic-astronomic elements have been done away with and only 
the arithmetical retained. 1 have been unable to discover tiie connect- 
ing links between the two games. The Levant may furnish a clew to 
the relationsiiip if any sncli now exists, but 1 am w ithout information 
on the yubject. 

The game seems to date from a recent period in Europe. According 
to Brockhaus' Conversations Lexicon, Art ''D.nnino," it was introduced 
into (iermany through France from Italy about tiie middle of the last 
century. In England it appears from a writer in Notes and (,)ueries* 
to have been introduced by T^rench prisoners about the close of the 
last century. 

INVENTION OF TIIE GAME. 

According to a tradition current among the Chinese laborers in the 
United 8tat(!S, dominoes were invented by lhi)i(j Miii(j,\ a hero of that 
poj)ular romance, the 8dm Kwokchi.X for the amusement of his soldiers to 
keep them awake during the watches of the night in their camp before 
the enemy. Others attril)ute them to the ingenuity of lu'nn<i f<(i ywrw//,§ 
and give a similar reas(m for their discovery. A Chinese physician, 
the most scliolarly of my informants among his class, insisted tliat they 
were invented by Fan L>(l,\\ wliose picture, fiom a popular illustrated 
edition of the Tniiff rlum lit kicolc,^] is re|>roduce(l in lig. 2:i. Little 
importance nee<l be attached to these stories, which are given as

uneducated Chinese regarding things which are a matter (.f record.

CHINESE GAMES WITH DICE AND DOMINOES.

Avho presented tbeni to the Emperor Hwui tsung', and that tlie game 
with its explauatiou was locked in the imperial treasury and first came 
into general use iu the reign of Hwui-tsung's sou, Kao-tsung (1127-11G3 
A. D.). 

Mr. Karl Himly * cites Kanghi's Dictionary as saying that according 
to general tradition dominos were invented iu the second year of 
Siuen-ho (1120) and circulated abroad by imperial order at the time of 
Kao-tsung. 

Mr. Chatto t quotes the other great Chinese dictionary of the last 
century, the Ohing tsz' t'ung, on the authority of Mr. Samuel Birch, as 
saying that the cards now known in China as " Teen-tsze-pae" {tim tsz^ 
p'di), or "dotted cards," were invented in the reign of Siuen-ho, llL'O, 
and that they began to be common iu the reign of Kao-tsung. 

Mr. W. H. Wilkinson has recently show:' |that in the citation iiuule 
by Chatto from the Ching tsz' tuiig, he 

omits the concluding and most important ^T'^ ->/" 

sentence: "Itidoes not follow that this class vm ^-4>-. ^^ 

of games originated in the period Hsiiau-ho," 
and says that the passage, adduced again 
and again by European writers to prove 
that cards (dominoes) \vere first invented iu 
the reign of Siuen-ho, when carefully "-ex- 
amined, distinctly declares that such a con- 
clusion would be unsound. 

"It is perfectly clear," Mr. Wilkinson says, "that 
all that was done or asked lor in 1120 was an imperial 
decision as to which of several forms of T'ieu-kiu 
(Heavens and Nines) was to be considered orthodox. 
The game iind the cards must have been in existence 
long before. The passage from the Cheng-tza-t'nng 
runs thus: 'Also ya p'ai, now the instruments of a 
game. A conuuon legend states that m the second 
year of the Hslian-ho, in the Sung dynasty 
(1120 A. D. ), a certain official memorialized the 

throne, praying that the ya p'ai (ivory cards) might be fixed as a pack of 32, 
comprising 127 pips (sic, it should be 227, but Chinese printers are careless), in order 
to accord with the expanse of the stars and constellations. The combination, 
'Heaven,' (6—6, 6 — 6) consisted of two pieces, containing 24 pips, figures of the 24 
solar periods; ' earth ' (1 — 1, 1 — 1) also composed of two pieces, but contained 4 pips, 
the four points of the compass — east, west, south and north; ' man' (4 — 4, 4 — 4) two 
pieces, containing 16 pips, the virtues of humanity, benevolence, propriety and wis- 
dom, fourfold; 'harmony' (1 — 3, 1 — 3) two pieces of eight pips, figuring the lireath 
of ' Harmony' which pervades the eight divisions of the year. The other combina- 
tions had each their names. There were four players having 8 cards apiece for their 
hand, and the cards won or lost according as the number of the pips was lessor 
more, the winner being rewarded with counters. In the time of Kao-tsung

(1127-1163) pattern packs were issued by imperial edict. They are now known 
throughout the euijjire as ku p'ai, 'bone pai;' but it does not follow that this class 
of games, 2)o-sai, ko-wu, and the rest originated in the reigu Hsiiau-ho." 

As tbe foregoinji- shows that the liistorical evidence is iucouchisive 
as to the actual iiiveutiou of dominoes, and as the Chinese accounts of 
the invention of other games are not particularly trustworthy, and 
especially as the history of all games seems to be one of gradual evo- 
lution, rather than direct invention, the following pages are devoted 




Fig. 24.

( Fnim specimens in Museum ol' University (.1 reniisylvania. ) 

to an examination into the origin of the game from internal evidences 
rather than an historical point of view. 



DOMINOES A FOE3I OF DICE. 

It is readily apparent that the 21 individual domino pieces represent 
the possible throws with 2 dice, and that the domino pieces may be 
regarded as conjoined dice. Of this the Korean dominoes furnish the 
best material evidence. Consonant with many other Korean objects, 
they are typical of an earlier age of Chinese culture than that now 
existing in China. 

Their material, color of spots, and the manner in which the "one" 
spots are incised and made larger than the other spots, complete their 
resemblance to 2 conjoined dice. It we accept this theory the bone- 
faced bamboo dominoes may be regarded as directly related to the pre- 



CHINESE GAMES WITH DICE AND DOMINOES.

cediug, the wooden backs beiug- substituted as a matter of economy. 
Dominoes made entirely of wood would naturally follow, and the long 
dominoes used in the south of China might be regarded as a later type. 
Even they bear a suggestion of their origin in the spots with which 
their ends and tops are decorated. 

The names of the dominoes are the same as those of the corre- 
sponding throws with the 2 dice, and the pieces are divided, like the 
dice-throws, into the series of miui and 
mo, in which they rank in the same order 
as the dice. The correspondence extends 
to the game as well, the most character- 
istic domino game, td fin Avru, closely 
resembling the most characteristic dice 
game, chdl- fin kau. Indeed, if dominoes 
were invented for the purpose of a game, 
they doubtless had their origin in the 
game with 2 dice. This game with 2 
dice, sJu'ung /»/>•, which, according to one 
Chinese authority, is said to have come 
from India, finds a parajlel in an Indian dice game. 

Several kinds of dice are employed in games in India. One (fig. 24) 
called ^ff.s'^ (plural of p^fsvO i^re used in the game called chausar, SLud 
consist of rectangular bone or ivory prisms, marked on 4 sides with 1, 
2, 5, and G spots. These dice are sometimes made shorter and pointed 
at the ends (fig. 25). Their origin I assign to the staves referred to on 
page 507. Another kind of Indian dice, called by the Arabic name of 

l-ab, or kabat, from k'ab, 



"ankle," "ankle Done," are 
used in the game of k'-aha- 
tain, 2 dice being thrown. 
Either natural astragali, 
consisting of the knuckle 
bones of a goat, or dice 
marked on 4 sides with 
"three," "four," "one," and 
"six" spots, or cubical dice 
regularly marked on the 6 
sides (fig. 27) are employed. 
The "four" spots on these 
dice are usually marked in red, and often both the "three" and 
"four" are marked in this color.* Thus cubical dice appear to be

' Thi.s account of k'ah was communicated to tlie writer by the Hon. Syad Moham- 
med Hadi, of Sultanpnr, India. Two sets of ivory dice, received by the writer from 
Lucknow, are cubical, and marked on their 6 sides with from 1 to spots, in the same 
manner as our common dice. The '• fours" alone are in red.

directly conuected with the knuckle boues. The Arabic name for the 
knuckle bone and the die is the same, l-^ab, and, like the knuckle 
bones, which are commonly thrown in pairs, natural pairs from the 
ri<>iit and left leg being used, cubical dice are also thrown in pairs. 
Carrying out the resemblance, cubical dice in India are sold in pairs, 
and by varying the arrangement of the "threes" 
and "fours"* are actually made in pairs, rights 
and lefts, like the knuckle bones. If this is the 
true history of the descent of the cubical dotted 
die, its evolution must have occurred at a very 
early time, as the regularly marked stone die 
(Fron, specimens in Museum of froui thc Greck colouy of Naucratls, EofVBt 

Unlveri'ily ol Penn-^ylvania. 1 ^ "' ?5J1'" 

(fig. 28), assigned by the discoverer, Mr. Flinders 
Petrie, to 600' B. C, bears witness. 

]S"ow, the 4 sides of the knuckle bone (talus) (fig. 30), Avhich were 
designated among the Eomans as supinum., pronum^ planum^ and tor- 
tuosnm, and corresi)ond Avith the numbers "three," "four," "one," and 
"six," receive in the Mohammedan East the names of ranks and con- 
ditions of men. The Persians, according to Dr. Hyde, t name them, 
respectively, "^w;^^?," "slave," "f7//j7>aM," "peas- 
ant," ^^vezir,^^ "viceroy," and shah, ov padi-shah, 
"king." Similar names are given by the same 
author as applied to them by the Arabs, Turks, 
and Armenians, From this it api^ears that the 
names and rank given to the significant throws, 
"three," "four," "one," and "six," with knuckle 
bones and dice in Western Asia find their coun- 
terparts in the names and rank of the same 
throws in China, the names of the classes of 
human society found among the Arabs being- 
replaced in China with the terms for the cosmic 
powers: "Heaven" ("six"), "Earth" ("one"), 
and "Man" ("four"), and the "Harmony" 

("three-one"), that unites them. It will also be observed that the 
use of 2 dice, which appears to follow that of the natural pair of 
knuckle bones, and is displayed in the Indian ¥abatain, and the 
ancient and widely diifused game of backgammon, is paralleled by 
the use of 2 dice in. China, where shvumj Ink (Japanese, sugoroku)

* If a Chinese die be turned ace up and revolved toward the person holding it so 
that the "two," "Hve," and "six" are disclosed iu succession, it will be found that 
the "thr(!e" is usually to the left and the "four" to the right, while the opposite is 
more usually the case on European dice. In the Indian dice here referred to, this 
arrangement is alternated, one having the "three" on the right and the other on 
the left.

"tlirees" and "fours'' are marked in red on Indian dice, while in 
China the "ones'' and "fours" are so marked. The Wale Ian san

Chio go, " double five."

From this it would appear that the dice anciently u.sed in Japan and

Where and for what i)nrpose were the dice-throws united in the 
domino form, and why was the number of the doraino pieces increased 
from 21 to 32 ? Dominoes are unknown in India as a native game, but 
as it seemed possible that they might have had their origin there for 
use in fortune telling, the writer made a carefnl exam iinition of the prin- 
cipal East Indian systems of fortune telling with dice, bntthe resnlts 

clid not throw any light u])on the origin of 
dominoes. * The Thibetan astrologers, ac- 
cording to Schlagintweit, t use dice which 
are either cubes like European ones, or 
rectangular parallelopipedons, sometimes 
comparatively very long; the latter, in con- 
sequence of their form, having two sides

ing, which I regard as derived from the game Avith staves, but the

* This diagram coincides -with the most renowned of the arithmetical stjnares 
whicii are used as charms both by Hindus and Mohaniniedans iu India. It is usually 
writleu as below, an inversion of the Chinese arrangement. 



This square appears in its numerical form on the Thibetan charts, reproduced by 
iSchlagintweit. where it is arranged in the Chinese order. 

It is believed iu India, said one of my Mohammedan informants, that to write this 
charm will biing good look and money by honest meaus. The object for which it is 
used is always written beneath it. He told me that his grandfather wrote it every 
day after prayers and would place beneath it the words ri:k, "bread," or chardj, 
"expenses."' Snch numbered diagrams are cut iu squares, each containing a number. 
These are made into pills with wheateu bread and thrown into a pond or river to be 
eaten by fish. 

Auother Indian, a Hindu, says that this magic square is called in Hindustani 
Fiiiidra vo yiiiitra, or the"' l.") yuntra."' 

It is written both with numerals and with dots. In the latter case the set of dots 
from 1 to 9 frequentl}' are made each of a different color and certain names are 
given to them. 

It is not improbable that this diagram was borrowed by the Chinese from India, 
and that, too, at a much later period than is usually assigned to it by the Chinese. 
The writer found a cojiy of it — in Arabic numerals, among the written charms iu a 
soldier's kit captured iu Tt)uquin — in the Municipal Museum of the city of Havre. 

The spots, like those on the dice, are doubtless survivals of a primitive system of 
notation, like that which existed iu Mexico at the time of the Conquest.

"It now remains for iis to speak of stones, or in other wonts, the leading folly of the day ; to say noth- 
ing at all of our taste for gems and amber, crystal and murrhine vases. For everything of which 
we have previously treated (down to the present book) may by some possibility or other have the 
ai)pearance of having been created for the sake of man ; but as to the mountains, nature made these 
for herself, as a kind of bulwark for keeping together the bowels of the earth ; as also for the purpose 
of curbing the violence of rivers, of breaking the waves of the sea, and so. by opposing to them 
the very h.irdest ot her materials, putting a check upon those elements which are never at rest. 
Antl yet, we must hew down these mountains, forsooth, and carry them off; and this for no other 
reason than to gratify our luxurious inclinations." — Pliny. 

Since very early times civilized man has shown an ever increasing 
teiulency to decorate his home and his temples with objects beautiful 
and rare. With but a limited knowledge of metallurgy, with methods 
of manufacture crude in the extreme, the scope of his means was at 
first limited to such materials as nature had already prepared for his 
use or as could be wrought into objects of beauty by the few arts at his 
command. It is but natural, therefore, that the gems aud precious 
stones early came into demand for household as well as ])ersonal adorn- 
ment, while the marbles and alabasters, the granites, porphyries, and 
more vulgar lime and sandstones became equally desirable for purposes 
of interior decoration and for the rougher exteriors of houses and pal- 
aces, temples and tombs, where\^er civilization had gained sufficient 
footnold to rendei them objects of admiration, or where a desire for 
immortality had spurred the builder to seek a less perishable material 
than wood. 

Hence it is that the onyx and sardonyx, the diamond, the opal, 
and the i>earl, as well as marbles and alabasters were thousands of years 
ago as well known and — among the wealthier classes — even more univer- 
sally used than to day. It is indeed a singular fact that in all these years 
that have elapsed since history began, scarcely a gem or ornamental 
stone of more than local importance has been discovered but was 
known, in at least some of its varieties, and utilized by a jieople so 
ancient that we can read their history only m their ruins. 

Among the most beautiful of the many stones thus used for both 
building and for interior decoration, were certain travertines and cave 

541 



542 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

deposits, the so-called ouyx marbles, or oriental alabasters, the lapis 
oniscits, or onychites, of the Eomaus, It is the purpose of the writer 
to present herewith in considerable detail the results of his own 
researches and observations on this class of rocks, together with so 
much additional information as can be gleaned from available sources. 

It is unfortunate in our discussion of the subject in hand, that both 
the popular names by which these stones are known are erroneous and 
misleading. The term onyx as properly used, includes a banded variety 
of chalcedony — a purely siliceous rock — the name being derived from 
the Greek <ryu^ or (r^uj(u>v, a nail, in allusion to the wavy bands by 
which the stone is traversed, and its translucency, both of which are 
characteristics of the nails upon tbe hand. That such a name should 
have become applied to this particular variety of travertine is by no 
means strange, since both the characteristics of banding and translu- 
cency are often as pronounced as in the true onyx. And, inasmuch as 
the name has become too firmly engrafted upon the literature to ever 
become wholly eradicated, it is the name used here, but in its adjec- 
tive form only, as descriptive of a kind of marble. 

The term alabaster as applied to the stone is even more misleading 
than onyx, since both stones are used for nuich the same purposes, 
and when reading published accounts we are not infrecprently at a 
loss, unless descriptive qualities are mentioned, to know at all times 
whether the material under discussion is a true alabaster (gypsum) or 
an onyx marble. Thus Chateau * states that the alabasters are trans- 
lucent, of a greater hardness than the marbles proper, and are hence 
more expensive to work. Finally he says the alabasters "presenteut 
des veines festonneeset onduleuses, que 1' on ne remarque jamais dans 
les marbres avec cette meme irregularite." It is obvious that this is a 
travertine and not a true alabaster. Again (on p. 453) he speaks of 
" Valabatre dnr,^^ or '■^ealcaire,^' having a yellow or variegated tint, and 
which is found in grottos and caverns in calcareous rocks. The '^ ala- 
batre tendre'''' or '■'(jijpseux'''' of this writer is the true alabaster. 

Pliny, the elder, from whom we quoted at the beginning of this arti- 
cle, wrote with an equal lack of perspicuity, though this perhaps is to 
be little wondered at. He says: "Our forefathers imagined that onyx 
was to be found only in the mountains of Arabia, and nowhere else, but 
Sundines was aware that it is also found in Carmania. Drinking ves- 
sels were made of it at first, and then the feet of beds and chairs. Cor- 
nelius Nepos relates that great was the astonishment when P. Lentulus 
Spinther exhibited amphorse made of this material, as large as Chian 
wine vessels in size, 'and yet five years after,' says he, 'I saw columns 
of this materml, no less than 2 and 30 feet in height.' At a more 
recent period again some change took place with reference to this stone.

for four small pillars of it were erected by Cornelius Balbus in his 
theater as something quite marvelous. Ajasseu, however, thinks these 
were of yellow jasper or sardonyx, and I myself have seen 30 columns 
of larger size in the banqueting room which Callistres erected." 

Again, "this stone is called 'alabastrites' by some, and is hollowed 
out into vessels for holding unguents, it having the reputation of pre- 
serving them from corruption better than anything else. In a calcined 
state it is a good ingredient for plasters. That which is of a honey 
color is the most esteemed, covered with spots curling in whirls and 
not transparent. Alabastrite is considered defective when it is of a 
white or horn color, or approaching to glass in appearance." * 

"Alabastrites is a stone which comes from Alabastron in Egypt and

"Ajasseu remarks that under this name (alabaster) the ancients 
meant, first, yellow, calcareous alabaster, and, secondly, chalcedony, 
unclassified."! 

It seems most probable that the drinking vessels and feet of chairs 
and beds referred to in these quotations were of the true onyx (chal- 
cedony). The amphora? and large columns, on the other hand, were 
most likely of the onyx marble (travertine or stalagmite). The ala- 
bastrites, which on being calcined is good for i)lasters, would seem at 
first thought to be a true alabaster (calcium sulphate) since this when 
thus treated yields the well-known plaster of paris. I have as yet, 
however, to learn with absolute certainty of the use of the sulphate 
by the Egyptians for the purpose he mentions— that of making vessels 
for holding unguents; and, inasmuch as the calcium carbonate would 
yield quicklime on calcining, it seems most probable that the material 
referred to in the second and third quotations from Pliny's work was 
of the last-named material. 

In the descriptions of St. Marks Cathedral at Venice, as given by 
Baedecker and others, mention is made of an altar with " four spiral 
columns of alabaster, said to have once belonged to the temple of Solo- 
mon, of which the two white ones in the middle are semitransparent." 
To one at all acquainted with the physical properties of the true ala- 
baster it seems impossible that the material- can be other than an onyx 
marble or perhaps chalcedony. 

The above illustrations together with the references wliich follow will 
serve to show the confusion existing in the literature on the subject. 

The derivation of the name is interesting, and may well be dwelt 
upon briefly here. The original Greek word from which our word

the vessels was carried on. The ancient Eoman name of the stone wa? 
alabastrites.* Be this as it may, the name alabaster, as now used by 
all authorities, applies only to a white, though sometimes variously 
veined and mottled variety of gypsum, a calcium suli»hate, while the 
onyx marbles with which we have to do in this work, are of calcium 
carbonate and mineralogically either aragonite or calcite, principally 
the latter, 

ORIGIN AND MODE OF OCCURRENCE. 

The origin of these stones is purely chemical, and of interest on 
account of the very simplicity of the process. Simple aud well known 
though it may be, we are apparently not yet able to account in a 
manner entirely satisfactory for the varying physical conditions, as 
texture and hardness or form of crystallization, under which the mate- 
rial occurs. Pure water, although an almost universal solvent, never- 
theless acts so slowly upon most substances belonging t% the mineral 
kingdom that the results are quite inappreciable to the ordinary 
observer. When, however, holding minute quantities of carbonic acid, 
and especially when, as deep in the surface of the earth, it is under 
considerable pressure, its solvent property is very considerably aug- 
mented, and results are produced both in the way of solution and 
redeposition which are readily noticeable, even to the most casual 
observer. 

One of the most common mineral substances found in aqueous solu- 
tion is carbonate of lime, the essential constituent of ordinary limestones 
and marbles, as well as of the beautiful onyx marbles, as we shall 
notice later. It is to be found in the water of all springs, streams, 
lakes, and seas, aud furnishes the means whereby the uniltitudinous 
shellfish aud corals build up their calcareous shells and skeleton-like 
supports. Pure water will dissolve only 1 part in 10,800 when cold 
and 1 part in 8,875 when boiling. When the water is saturated with 
carbonic acid gas at ordinary atmospheric pressure and a temperature 
of 10° C, its capacity for solution is increased to nearly 1 part by 
weight in 1,000 (0.88 grams per liter of water). With an increase in 
pressure the amount of carbonic acid that can be held by water is 
also increased, and there is as a natural result an augmentation in its 
solvent power. The maximum amount of lime which can be dissolved, 
even under the most fiivorable circumstances, is stated by Roscoe and 



*JoxES, T. Rupert. Demonstratiou oh the marbles aiitl other monumental stones 
in the British Museum.— (Proceedings Geologists Association, Vol. vin.) 



THE ONYX MARBLES. 545 

Scborlemmer to be about 3 grams per liter of water, or 3 parts by 
weight to 1,000. 

As has loug been kuowu, it is to the escape from solution of half 
the combined carbonic acid, aided in some cases by the secreting power 
of algous vegetation, that is due the deposition of the lime carbonate 
in the form of sinters and tufas about the orifices of springs, in that 
of scale in steam boilers and other vessels, or in the form of stalagmitic 
and stalactitic deposits in caves. With its solvent power diminished 
by the loss of the acid gas, the water deposits its load as rapidly as the 
gas escapes. 

Kow, although we know this to be the i)rocess by whi(;h the calca- 
reous deposition takes place, we do not know absolutely just what are 
the conditions which control the character of the deposit as regards 
compactness and condition of crystallization. Why in some cases the 
deposit should be so compact as to be susceptible of an enamel-like 
polish, and of such colors as to make a beautiful marble, or again light 
and tufaceous like those now forming at the Mammoth Hot Springs in 
the Yellowstone National Park, or the more compact lapis Tiburtinus 
of Tivoli, Italy. Such synthetic work as has been done fails to throw 
much light upon the subject. G. Rose* has shown that by humid 
methods it is possible to produce out of the same solution crystals of 
both aragonite and calcite, the one or the other forming according to 
the temperature of the solution, Aragonite was formed exclusively by 
a rapid evaporation of hot solutions, while calcite was produced from 
similar solutions, both hot and cold. As the investigations here 
chronicled have shown the onyx marbles to be almost invariably of 
calcite, it is at once evident that we must look for other controlling 
conditions than those of temperature for a satisfactory solution. Such 
literature as bears upon the subject enables us, however, to draw, 
from analogy, certain conclusions, and it may not be without interest 
to refer here briefly to the expressed opinions of others. Thus Dr. 
Edward Hitchcock, writing half a century ago, says:t 

"I have alluded to tbedepositiou ofm irble, or alabaster, by certain springs in the 
vicinity of Lake Oroomiah (Persia). What is called the Tabrez marble has been 
repeatedly described by travelers; but I doubt whether definite geological ideas have 
yet been entertained respecting the mode of its formation. With the exception, 
perhaps, of a deposit of travertine around Rome, in Italy, resembling statuary 
marble, I am not aware of any case besides those around Oroomiah in vrhich the 
most beautiful marble is produced by springs. The Tabrez marble is usually of 
a yellowish or light blue color, perfectly compact, and so translucent that it is used 
in thin slices for the windows of baths and other places, like the phengites of the 
ancients. * * * The common opinion is that the springs now deposit it; but one 
or two facts have led me to suspect that this may not be the case. Above the marble 
there lies a deposit, several feet thick, of common tufa, or travertine. No\y, my sus- 
picion is that this tufa is all the deposit which has been formed since the springs

assumed their present state, and that the alabaster was deposited when their temper- 
ature was higher, and when, perhaps, they were beneath deep waters. However, 
this opinion is little better than conjecture." 

Bischoff,* iu discussiug similar phenomena, says: 

"It is interesting to know that mineral springs can deposit granular limestone. I 
dou])t whether hot springs are V)etter suited to this than cold, from which the depo- 
sition takes place slower than from the former ; but the slower the CaCOt is deposited, 
the more likely is it to assume a crystalline form. " 

J. L. Smith, writing- of the thermal waters of Hierapolis, says:t 

"The amount of water is very great, and it is so highly charged with carbonate of 
jimeasto incrust all bodies that it comes in contact with, and it takes place sorajjidly 
that the coucretion does not possess great solidity, and frequently has a granular 
form, resembling driven snow." 

W. H. Weed, in writing on the deposition of calcareous matter by 
the waters of the hot springs of the Yellowstone National Park,says:t 

"Another variety * " * is that which forms the lining of hot-spring ventholes. 
This is deposited comparatively slowly, and occurs in shelly layers half au inch to 
3 inches thick, with a smooth, rounded, and globular surface. It is crystalline and 
marble-like and pure white. This travertine is a crystallization out of a supersatur- 
ated solution of carbonate of lime, due to the relief of pressure as the waters 
approach the surface. A similar deposit lines the ventholes of the Orange and other 
springs, and is analogous to the deposit so quickly formed in the conduit pipes 
leading the hot water to the hotel baths, also due to supersaturation, experiments 
showing that such solutions do not deposit their excess of lime at once, but in the 
coiirse of a short time." 

Bearing iu mind that these onyx marbles are of calcite, and so com- 
pact as to acquire under proper manipulation an enamel-like i)olish, 
and fitrtber that, as noted later, they are all superficial deposits, it re- 
mains to formulate our own opinions regarding their origin and to note 
Low far they differ, if at all, from those above given. It is well to 
note, at the very outset, that while there is no apparent doubt but that, 
with the exception of the deposits in caves (see p. 550), the onyx marbles 
are the result of spring- action, I have been able to learn of no single 
instance in which material of this nature is now forming, the recent 
deposits invariably taking- a tufaceous structure. It is singular, to say 
the least, that widespread phenomena due to purely local causes should 
be so nearly synchronous in action and that we should be living in an 
age of cellular deposition only. 

It is evident that, so far as their mineralogical nature is concerned, 
the onyx nuirbles may be products of deposition from water of any 
ordinary temperature, hot or cold. Accepting the fact that such depo- 
sition would take i)lace more slowly from a cold than from a hot solu- 
tion, and that the more slowlj' deposition takes place the more likely is

the dei)Osit to assume a crystalliue structure, we miglit at first thought 
conclude these to be cold rather thau hot water deposits. Bearing in 
mind, however, that they bear evidence of comparatively rapid growth, 
such as would indicate deposition from waters of a high degree of sat- 
uration, it would seem more probable that at the time of issuing the 
waters were comparatively hot, and perhaps under conditions of con- 
siderable pressiire as well as saturation.* The tendency of such to 
immediately lose their excess of carbonic acid and deposit a light 
tufaceous travertine or sinter, as upon the immediate surface at the 
Mammoth Hot Springs, would be checked provided the discharge took 
place in pools of quiet water. We know that deposits sufficiently com- 
pact to receive a polish are sometimes formed in steam boilers, where, 
however, more than ordinary degree of saturation prevails and under 
unnatural conditions of pressure, t The onyx deposits being, how- 
ever, purely superficial, no such conditions of pressure could exist, and we 
must apparently fall back upon such conditions as should retard the 
loss of carbonic acid and thus cause the deposit to take place more 
slowly. Such conditions, we may fairly assume, would exist at the 
bottom of pools of water, and it is under such conditions, in the 
writer's opinion, based upon observation as well as on theoretical 
grounds, that the onyx marbles have been formed. To account, then, 
for the alternating tufaceous and compact character of the beds which 
everywhere exists, we have to make only the natural assumption that 
the temperature of the water and its degree of saturation periodically 
varied, the variation being accompanied perhaps by a difference in 
volume or place of discharge, whereby the water hitherto accumulating 
in pools, ran off almost immediately, permitting a ra})id loss of carbonic 
acid and an equal rapid diminution in temperature. This intermittent 
character of the deposition, and in fact the general history of onyx 
formation is, so far as my own experience goes, best shown in a region 
rather difficult of access known locally as the Tule Arroyo, a deep cation 
or ravine on the peninsula of Lower California, some 150 miles south from 
San Diego, and 15 to 20 miles from the gulf coast. The country rocks 
here are nearly black mica schists and blue gray silicifled limestones 
and quartzites standing nearly vertical with a strike some 20^* west of 
north, the whole being cut by the ravine, or arroyo, as it is called by 
the Mexicans. On the steep slopes of the hills on either side, and 
before the ravine had assumed anything like its present depth, springs 
have from time to time gushed out and deposited their calcareous load 
upon the surface over which they tlowed. As a rule the first material 

*T]ie fact that nearly every deijosit of tliis nature of which I have thus far found 
trace is iu a region of comparatively recent volcanic activity increases the probabil- 
ity of their being hot-spring deposits. 

tTbe writer has in his possession such a crust some .5 c. m. in thickness, taken from 
the boiler of an ocean steamer plying between New York and Portland, Me. In this 
case, however, the mineral is anhydrite (anhydrous sulphate of lime) rather than a 
carbonate. 



548 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1{^93. 

thus deposited was a dull-colored cellular travertiue which cemented 
together the augular fragments of older rocks with which the slopes 
were strewn, giving rise to a coarse conglomerate, or breccia. After 
this had gone on for some time and the travertine layer had grown, it 
may be, to several feet in thickness, the conditions changed as I 
have attempted to outline above, and the deposit took the form of the 
compact and beautifully veined and tinted stone to which the name 
onyx is commonly applied. In time the onyx-forming action ceased in 
its turn, and for a period no calcareous deposition whatever took 
place, the slopes becoming once more covered with angular particles 
of older rocks from higher up, these in their turn becoming cemented 
into breccias when the springs resumed their work. In this way were 
built up the alternating layers of breccia, tufa, and onyx, until finally 
all deposition practically ceased, and spasmodic but fiercely rushing 
streams cut the arroyo to its present depth, exposing in either wall the 
irregularly alternating beds described. In the bottom of the caFion 
still exist two diminutive springs, each building up in its feeble way 
small beds of tufaceous material. The water still flowing is so highly 
carbonated as to bubble like a glass of Vichy fresh from the fountain, 
and leaves, when drank immediately, a pleasant prickly sensation in 
the mouth and throat 

In discussing the origin of the onyx marbles, it is perhaps but fair 
to question the possibility of their having been originally deposited as 
tufaceous materials, and subsequently compacted and crystallized by 
pressure, heat, and percolating solutions, or other of the ordinary agents 
of metaniorphism. This can be best answered by pointing out the 
alternating character of tufaceous and compact layers. It is ditticult 
to conceive of conditions such as should have metamorphosed any one 
bed without aft'ecting, in the least, those either above or below, or both. 
The wavy, undulating lines of deposition, comparable with the rings of 
growth upon a tree, are well defined and unbroken, and though ditter- 
ing frequently from one another in color and crystallization preserve 
their parallelism and individuality throughout. (iSee pis. 1 and 3.) 
There are apparently good reasons for supposing the material to have 
been deposited as we now find it, the crystallization being contempo- 
raneous with deposition, as is the case with the stalagiuitic material in 
caves. * The wonderful variations in color, even in the same block or 
slab, are, however, in part due to changes subsequent to their deposi- 
tion, and it may be well to dwell upon this branch of the subject in 
considerable detail. Few rocks possess so wide a range of colors or 
shades of the same color. Pure white, opaque, milk or chalk white to 
almost colorless, gray, brown in hues from light ochre to deep mahogany, 
buff, amber, ochre yellow, pink, red, and green are all common; the 



* These latter deposits tlo, however, in some cases undergo a recrystallization 
whereby the whole internal structure is luodiiied without change of external form, 
as 1 have mentioned elsewhere.

various hues beiug sometimes constant throughout large masses, some- 
times intermixed and blended, sometimes occurring in alternating par- 
allel bands, and sometimes in distinct veins and spasmodic dashes. In 
the majority of cases the coloring matter is supposedly iron in some of 
its forms, aided in part by manganese; in any case the api^arent color 
may be modified by conditions of crystallization and structure, a clear 
translucent stone, by transmitted light, appearing much lighter and 
of more delicate tints than one that is opaque,* Assuming that the 
color constituents are only the two metals named, it yet remains to 
account for their presence and explain the conditions under which they 
give rise to such a variety of hues. It is easy and presumably correct 
to assume that the coloring matters were deposited contemporaneously 
with the calcite, but we must not in accepting this overlook the fact 
that these substances are unequallj- soluble, and under proper con- 
ditions would not be deposited together at all, but would undergo a 
process of natural separation. As is stated by Bischof,t water which 
contains carbonate of lime and i^rotoxide of iiou "may, when it passes 
for long distances in contact with the air, finally deposit pure carbon- 
ate of lime."' This, for the reason that the iron early becomes con- 
verted into the condition of sesquioxide and is deposited almost at 
the start. We can here account for their intimate association only on 
the f-upposition that at the time of deposition the water was not flow- 
ing, but lying in quiet pools where oxidation as well as loss of car- 
bonic acid was retarded. The variation in color of the bands might 
thus be in jiart accounted for on the suj)position that the waters, as 
they issued, contained at times varying amounts of the oxides men- 
tioned. (See pi. 3). I 

In fact, however, the varying hues are by no means due wholly to 
the proportion of metallic oxides, but rather to the conditions under 
which these oxides exist and to organic matter. In certain cases, as 
in the slabs shown in jjl. 3, the bands are of alternating white, 
green, and brown color, though all show practically the same percent- 
ages of iron when calculated as i^rotoxide carbonate. As a matter of 
fact, however, the iron exists in this state only in the white and faintly 

* A good illustration of the popular ideas regarding the cause of the color in these 
rocks is given in the accompanying paragraph from the Engiueeriug and Mining 
Journal (New York), vol. 49, p. 678. "Mexican onyx is a form of stalagmite, and 
its colors are formed l»y oxides of metal in the earth over the caves through which 
calcareous water passes. Gold is represented by purple, silver by yellow, iron by 
red, copper by green, and arsenic and zinc by white." It is difficult to conceive of 
any wording by which more errors could be comprised within the limits of a single 
paragraph.

iThe higher or the lower the temperature of the water, the more or less rapid its 
cooling, the greater or less abundance of bicarbomite of lime and jirotoxide of iron, 
and the different proportions in which these compounds occur — all these circum- 
stances may give rise to the most varied deposits of these substances as regards 
their relative quality. — {Bischof, p. 147.) 



550 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

greenish layers, the brown layers contaiuiiig it in the form of both 
protoxide and more or less hydrated sesqnioxides. , Bischotf, in speak- 
ing of a like condition in the so-called sprudelstein of Carlsbad, says:* 

The brown coutaiiis a considerably larger (juautity of peroxide of irou than the 
white, Avhich is sometimes quite free from it. This difference jtresupposes either 
that there is a difference in the quantity of irou contained in the water, or that 
sometimes the atmospheric air has a greater influence than at others, and that in 
those cases a larger quantity of protoxide of iron is peroxidized. 

In the case of the stones here described the percentage of iron in the 
green and brown and red varieties is nearly the same, the varying hues 
depending mainly upon its chemical condition. While it is possible 
that a part of the change from protoxide carbonate to sesquioxide 
took place at the time of deposition, a large part is due to oxidation 
which has taken place since the beds were in substantially their present 
condition, and is due to i^ercolating solutions. That this is the case is 
abundantly proven by the fact that the oxidation in most cases can be 
readily seen to have iirogressed along lines of Jointing and fracture 
and along the more porous layers. In many cases the oxidation is 
accompanied by a partial removal of the lime carbonate, whereby the 
stone is rendered cellular and unfit for use. Such, however, is not 
always the case, and many of the oxidized varieties are beautiful in the 
extreme, as well as uni(jue. {^See under chemical and physical proper- 
ties, p. 558.) 

The cave marbles differ from the travertines mainly in method of dep- 
osition, being cold-water deposits irpon the walls and floors of limestone 
caves. Eain water passing through the atmosphere and soaking 
through the layer of soil by which the earth is covered becomes charged 
with a varying amount of carbonic acid, which gives it the power of 
dissolving slowly the lime carbonate forming the essential constituent 
of the rock limestone, as already noted. Filtering downward through 
cracks and fissures or between the laminje com])osing the beds, it thus 
gradually enlarges them until what are popularly known as caves or 
caverns are produced. But after this cave-forming process has gone 
on for awhile another process sets in, whereby the cavern may be wholly 
or in part refilled. The water from the surface percolating down through 
the roof of the cave dissolves out a portion of the lime carbonate, just 
as when running through a crack or fissure, but in this case the 
water comes through the overlying rock and renmins for a time sus- 
pended, in the form of a drop, from the ceiling. Here it evaporates or 
loses a part of its carbonic acid, and, unable longer to hold the lime in 
solution, begins to deposit it in the form of a ring around the outer mar- 
gin of the drop. As time goes on this ring becomes prolonged into a 
quill-like tube, growing in length always from its lower end. After a 
time, as a rule, this frail tube becomes partially or wholly closed, when 
the water flows down over the outside, the growth now being wholly

external. In this way are fornieil the elongated pendant cones from 
the roofs of caves, and to which the name stalactite is given.* Such 
on being cut and i^olished show a beautiful zonal structure, not wholly 
unlike the rings of growth upon the trunk of a tree. (PI. 13.) 

But it rarely happens that all the water evaporates upon the ceiling; 
a portion usually falls upon the floor, where by a similar process it 
builds up a deposit chemically the same as the stalactites, but difteriug 
in that owing to the spreading out of the water as it falls, the floor 
deposits are more massive in form. To these floor deposits the name 
stalagmite is given. In some cases they rise in the form of blunt 
trunks or cones to meet their corresponding stalactites above until 
there are formed continuous pillars from floor to ceiling, as shown in 
l)late 1. If this process goes on for a suflicien t time the entire cave may 
be refilled, and since the water in percolating through the roof dissolved 
only the pure lime carbonate, or with but a trace of impurity, leaving 
nearly all the carbonaceous, siliceous, and clayey constituents behind, 
so these stalactitic and stalagmitic deposits are of purer lime, refined by 
nature's methods and recrystallized under new conditions. The form 
of crystallization, it should be stated, is sometimes that of aragonite, 
but so far as the writer's experience goes, more commonly that of 
calcite. It is sometimes, though not always, possible to distinguish 
between the two forms of crystallization by the unaided eye, stalac- 
tites (or stalagmites) of aragonite showing interiorly a radiating 
fibrous structure, the fibers being not infrequently beautifully curved 
and of a silky luster, while those of calcite are more granular. It some- 
times happens that deposits of both kinds are to be found in the 
same cave, though so far as my own observation goes they belong in 
such cases, as at Wyandotte, Indiana, to diftereut periods of growth. 
What the conditions are upon which these varying forms of crystalli- 
zation dei^end is not now apparent. 

It follows almost from necessity from their mode of origin, as above 
given, that the beds of onyx marbles, both spring and cave deposits, are 
as a rule lar less extensive and regular in their arrangement than are 
the ordinary stratified and bedded limestones and marbleSc Spring 
action is more or less intermittent, and the |)Iace of discharge, as well 
as the character of the deposit, variable. The latter usually take the 
form of a comparatively thin crust, conforming to the contours of the 
surfaces on which it lies. The various layers thicken aud thin out 
irregularly, and are often lenticular in cross section. Sound and homo- 
geneous layers of moi-e than 20 inches thickness are not common. 
Where two or more layers, of sound and merchantable material occur 
they are not infrequently separated by tufaceous material, foreign 
debris, or by impure aud porous onyx of little value. This condition 
of aft'airs will become more apparent as particular occurrences are

described. The cave marbles vary even more irregularly, both in extent 
and quality. The deposit may be a mere veneering over the face of the 
rock, and although there is apparently an abundance, judging from 
appearances alone, the actual amount of available stone may be 
extremely small.* Moreover, such deposits are rarely uniform tor any 
great distance, either in texture or color. Owing to coarse crystalli- 
zation, they fracture easily, and, moreover, are more than likely to con- 
tain numerous cavities, large and small, known popularly as " thumb 
holes" and "i)iu. holes." The small amounts of metallic oxides and 
organi-c matter they contain render the colors light and usually dull. 
White, yellowish, amber, and reddish, with a resinous luster, are com- 
mon. The rock as a rule is less translucent than the true onyx marbles, 
and when polished appears "muddy" and unsatisfactory. Neverthe- 
less, such deposits do not infrequently yield comparatively small blocks 
of beautiful material and material that is doubly desirable because it 
is unique. 

Properly managed such can be worked up to good advantage, but too 
much has been expected from them, and it is this fact that ha^s led to 
the disastrous failures following every attempt that has thus far been 
made to work the cave marbles in America. If the material as taken 
from the ledge could be assorted by some competent person and worked 
up, each block for such a purpose of ornamentation as it seemed best 
adapted, then we might hope for some interesting results. But at best 
the cave marbles of America must rank as "uniques" rather than 
objects of commercial value. They will never become regular sources 
of supply. There is too much waste and too much uncertainty regard- 
ing amount and quality. 

A marked and very beautiful feature of the onyx marbles in gen- 
eral, and particularly of those which originate as spring deposits, is 
the fine, undulating, parallel bands of growth or lines of accretion 
shown on a cross section, and which are of course due to its mode of 
origin through successive depositions upon the surface (see pi. 1). The 
stone owes its chief value for decorative purposes to its translucency, 
fine veination, and color. In many instances the original hues have 
become enhanced by oxidation and through the development of retic- 
ulating veins of small size, due to incipient fracture, into which perco- 
lating waters have introduced new coloring solutions or locally oxidized 
the protoxide carbonates, which seem to form tlie chief coloriug constit- 
uent, as already noted. 

The localities from which the finer grades of stone oi tnis type have 
in times past or jjreseut been obtained are few and widely scattered, 

* The writer has met with just sucli cases iu his experience. A certain deposit 
was represented as a solid mass of inercliautable stone, showing a (juarry face 100 
or more feet in length by some 20 or 30 feet in height. On inspection it was 
shown that the "quarry face" was but a thin coating of stalactitic matter over 
the sloping wall of an old cavern. Not a cubic yard of merchantable stone ctiuld 
have been obtained in the entire outcrop.

and it is interesting to note that, with tlie exception of the cave deposit, 
all that have thus tar come under the writer's notice wliich are of such 
color as to make them preeminently desirable for ornamental purposes, 
occur in hot and arid countries and regions not far distant from recent 
volcanic activity. This is as true of foreign as of American occurrences. 
It is to be noted that all the deposits known are of slight geological 
antiquity, belonging to late Tertiary and early Quarternary periods. If 
materials of like nature were earlier deposited they would seem to have 
so far lost their identity as to be no longer recognizable. Contrary to 
the general belief, as indicated in the literature of the subject, or by 
the labeling of samples in museums, the onyx marbles, as shown by 
the investigations here chronicled, are almost without exception of cal- 
cite and not aragonite. It is true that the basis for such a statement 
is founded mainly upon specific gravities, the results of which may in 
certain cases seemingly be open to doubt. While, however, it is possi- 
ble that certain of these stones may be made up of finely alternating 
bands of calcite and aragonite, there would seem no legitimate reason 
for doubting the main mass of the material to be calcite, particularly 
when microscopic examinations have borne out the results obtained by 
gravity methods. 

USES, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 

As already noted, the onyx marbles were used in Egypt during very 
early times for making small articles, as jugs, bowls, canopic vases, 
and amphorai, employed to hold offerings to the gods, the ashes of 
the dead, and for other religious and domestic purposes. We find 
them thus utilized as early as the second dynasty. It is worthy of note 
that few, if any, of these articles were polished, though many of them 
show great skill in workmanshii^. In the Abbott collection of Egji^tian 
antiquities of the New York Historical Society are several fine examples 
of this nature, one of which is shown in pi. 9, fig. 2. 

According to the guide book to the fourth Egyptian room of the 
British Museum (1892, p. 117) the vases, bowls, saucers, spoons, and 
other vessels, which were placed in the tombs to hold the wine, oil, 
honey, sweetmeats, perfumes, and cosmetics offered to the dead, were, 
during the first six dynasties, commonly made from plain white "ala- 
baster" (whatever that may be). Afterwards, variegated marbles and 
stones were frequently employed, including aragonite, granite and 
diorite, steatite and schist. Mr. G. F. Harris states* that the oynx 
thus used during the earlier periods — the fifth and sixth dynasties — 
was plain and of one uniform layer, but about the time of the twenty- 
fifth dynasty a zoned variety of a yellow color came into use. This 
authority further states that the principal shapes shown in the British 
Museum are "hemispherical vases with wide open mouths, for holding 
wines; basins, cylindrical vases, with wide rims for unguents or oils; 
vases in the shape of wiue jugs, two-handled amphorjv, and drop-shaped 

" The Bnilder, London, vol. 61, 1891, p. 14. 



654 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUxM, 1893. 

alabasters.'' These latter forms were held in sneb high esteem that 
they were exported from Egypt, aud it is stated that "the names of 
Persian mouarchs have been found in hieroglyphic and cuneiform 
characters upon them, whilst vases apparently of Egyptian material, if 
not of Egyptian fabric, have been discovered in the early tombs of Asia 
Minor, Greece, and the isles of the Arcliipelago." According to other 
authorities,* the first mention of articles of this nature by Greek writers 
is that of Herodotus (born 484 B. C), who speaks of a p-upo'^ a\iia<TTp„,> as 
one of the presents sent by Cambyses to the Ethiopian king. " Some 
of these vessels," it is stated, '"had a long and narrow neck, which was 
sealed; so that when the woman in the gospel is said to break the box 
of ointment, it appears probable that she only broke the extremity of 
the neck, which was thus closed." The Egyptians did not, however, 
confine their use of the stone to these small articles, but at a very early 
period began utilizing it for the interior decoration of their tombs and 
temples. According to Dr. J. VV. Dawson, t the magnificent granite 
temple of Kephren at Gizeh was lined with this stone in the early age 
of the pyramid-building kings. 

" Some of the very old touibs iu the Memphite cemetery at Sakkarah are liued with 
alabaster, or i^artially so lined. A curious example of the latter may be seen in the 
tomb called that of Unas. The inner sepulchral chamber of this tomb is liued with 
slabs of alabaster. The work is then continued in common limestone, aud the 
entrance of the tomb is line-l with the stronger and more enduring red granite. At 
Abydos are the remains of a magnificent monolithic shrine of this stone, and at 
Karuak a similar shrine is built of alabaster slabs, some of them 20 feet in length. 
In this and other cases one is astonished that so tine work and material should be 
lavished on places enshrouded in darkness; and the question is raised, but can not 
be answered, What means of illumination had the ancient Egyptians, beyond the 
smoky oillamps and torches, which would scarcely suffice adequately to illuminate 
the interior of tombs aud temples, aud would soon have destroyed their beautiful 
workmanship.'' 

"The finest work in Egyptian alabaster that I have seen [says the writer] is the 
sarcophagus of Seti I, father of Rameses II, { found in his tomb in the 'valley of the 
kings,' by Belzoui, and now in Sir John Soane's Museum in London. It is 9 feet 4 
inches m length, 3 feet 8 inches wide, and from 2 feet 8 inches to 2 feet 3 inches deep ; 
and is hollowed out of a single block so delicately that its general thickness is only 
2| inches, and that a lamp placed within shines through the translucent sides. On 
the bottom of the coffin is a figure of Netpe, or Athor, the mother goddess, with 
arms extended to receive the body of the King ; and the whole surface is covered 
with inscriptions and professional figures representing the liturgy of the dead. The 
lid was of similar character, but has been broken to pieces. v^ By a singular com- 
bination of accidents, the mummy of this great King, which had been transferred 
by its guardian priests for greater security to Deir el Bahari, is now in the Boulak 
Museum. The noble sarcophagus prepared for it is in London, and his A-ast and beauti- 
fully decorated tomb stands open for the inspection of travelers in the ' valley of 
the kings.'"

The materials employed in the Temple of the Sphinx in Egypt are 
rose granite and " alabaster," The supporting piers are of granite, the 
lining slabs of the walls and the ceiling of " alabaster" without carving 
or any form of relief. 

Onyx was also employed for statuettes, some few of which are pre- 
served in the museums of to-day. The statue of Eameses, now in the 
Musee du Louvre, in Paris, is stated by Chateau to be of Egyptian 
alabaster, while in the Boulak 31useum at Cairo are '' alabaster" statues 
of Queen Ameneritis, mounted on abase of gray granite; also of Osiris, 
the scribes Xeferhotep and Awi. 

According to Hull,* a beautifully iridescent variety of the Egyptian 
stone was used in constructing the four columns, each about 8 feet in 
height, which adorn the Sala containing the cabinets of gems in the 
Galleria degli Ufflzi at Florence. He also describes large cinerary urns 
formed from this material, one of the finest being in the museum of the 
Vatican at Eome, which measures 9 feet in length and 4 feet in depth. 
Also tables in the Galleria Pitti at Florence. 

During the reign of Moliamed Ali, the founder of the present 
dynasty, onyx from the Beni-Souef quarries was largely atilized in the 
embellishment of the celebrated "Alabaster Mosque" at Cairo. This, 
it will be remembered, was partly completed in its present form by Said 
Pasha in 1857. The alabaster used for the incrustation of the masonry 
consists partly of blocks and partly of slabs. The beautiful yellow 
tint of the stone fades on prolonged exposure to the sun.t I am 
informed by Mr. H. A. Ward that the stone here used is so translucent 
that when the sun is shining upon it, shadows of passers-by upon the 
street are distinctly noticeable fi'om within, even where the wall is 18 
inches in thickness. 

Following the Egyptians, the Romans, with their characteristic lux- 
uriousness, did not fail to overlook so promising a material, and early 
adopted it for similar puri^oses. A portion of the vessels found in 
Grecian and Roman ruius are of undoubted Egyptian materials and 
manufacture. The quarries at Ain Tembalek were worked with great 
activity at a very early period by the Romans. This is proven not 
merely by the abundance of works of art in this stone among the 
Roman ruins, but also by the finding of actual quarry sites. In all the 
Arabian monuments found in the region, especially at Tlemcen, there 
has been frequent use made of the onyx. In the grand mosque D'jama- 
Kebir, built during the tweltth century, may be seen the remains of an 
old court flagged with onyx, in the center of which is a fountain of the 
same material. In the mosque Djama-Abou'l Hassen, the numerous 
columns supporting the arcade are also of onyx. Beautiful examjiles 
of the character of the (juarry product are also to Toe seen at Sidi Bon 
Medin and at the museum at Tlemcen. The onyx columns of the

ancient mosque of Mansourali are said to be particularly fine. Chateau 
states that the tunic of the statue of Diana in the Louvre is of the 
Algerian onyx. Material of the same nature, derived either from 
Algeria or the numerous caverns of Italy, was extensively utilized for 
sarcophagi by Eomans, Etruscans, and Greeks, the body and cover in 
such cases being each of a single jiiece, and in many instances elabo- 
rately carved. The Etruscan sarcophagus in the Boston Museum of 
Fine Arts is of material* of this nature. 

Onyx from dei)osits near Lake Oroomia and Yezd was extensively 
used in the balmy days of the Persian Empire by the native nobles. 
I am informed by the Eev. Benj. Labaree that it has been used in the 
form of slabs to lace the elegant fountains or to pave their baths. 
Small blocks were also used in the doors and windows of their baths 
in place of glass. "The most beautiful slab I know of," he writes, "is 
one some 8 by*4 feet, as near as I recall, serving as a table or sideboard 
in the English consulate at Tabreez. It must be some 4 inches thick. 
It is of a charming yellow tinge with darker reddish lines shading 
through it.'' 

Writing on the same subject, the Eev. P. Z. East( n states that the 
grand staircase of the new palace of the Crown Prince at Tabriz is 
paved Avith this marble. In the bazaars one finds it employed by the 
lithographers. Small ornaments, such as saltcellars, vases, etc., are 
cut from it, and sometimes slabs for table tops. "In cemeteries it is 
used to some extent, but generally only where the cemetery is inclosed, 
as otherwise it is likely to be broken and carried off. In Moslem cem- 
eteries, however, this is not so apt to be the case. I remember seeing 
a fine block at Maraud, about 40 miles from Tabriz, which had not been 
disturbed." Mr. Eastou further states that there must be some varia- 
tion in quality, as in some cases stones which have been exposed even 
for a comi)aratively short period change in color and become compara- 
tively valuless, "while in other cases, as in those of the magnificent 
slabs at the back of the Blue Mosque, which have stood for four cen- 
turies, and for a century or more have been more or less exposed to 
the action of the weather, there is comparatively little change." In 
ancient times, when there was more wealth in Persia, this stone was 
probably nuich more extensively used, and larger pieces were hewn 
out. A Persian prince of to-day would hardly incur the expense of 
moving such masses as the blocks in the Blue Mosque. Morier states * 
that the tomb of the Persian Poet Hafiz is also of this stone. He 
describes this as " a parallelogram with a projecting base, and its super- 
fices carved in the most exquisite manner. One of the odes of the poet 
is engraved upon it, and the artist has succeeded so well that the let- 
ters seem rather to have been formed with the finest pen than sculp- 
tured by a hard chisel. The whole is of the diaphanous marble of 
Tabriz, in color a combination of light green, with here and there

THE ONYX MARBLES. 557 

veins of red aud sometimes of blue.'' Curzon, however, writing in 
3892,* describes the tomb of Hatiz as having once had a lid of marble, 
but which was carried away by Kerwin Khan and built into the tank 
in Jehan Neniak, replacing it by the present sarcophagus made of yel- 
low Yezd marble. Morier further says that the Haft-ten, a Persian 
pleasure house erected by Kerwin Kahn at Shiraz, is w ainscoted with 
the Tabriz marble, one of the largest slabs being 9 feet long aud 5 feet 
wide, such wainscotings being often inlaid with gold. The college 
called Medresse Shah Sultan Hassein, at Ispahan, also contains some 
of the same material. 

Many Italian churches, ancient and modern, contain numberless 
illustrations of the extensive use of these materials, and which, in 
many cases, have been taken for their x^rt^sent use from the ruins of 
still more ancient structures. The Cathedral of S. Paolo le Mura, at 
Rome (rebuilt in 1853), contains two beautiful columns of the Egyptian 
"alabaster" near the entrance, and four others in the canopy of the 
high altar. These were presented, it is stated, t by the present vice- 
roy of Egypt, and hence came, without doubt, from the valley of the 
Nile. 

The use of the onyx in thin slabs for window i)anes in cathedrals 
has often been reported in Mexico as well as in Europe. I am informed 
by Dr. G. Brown Goode that a portion of the windows in the Cathe- 
dral of Orvieto (Italy) are of a yellow-brown banded stone, which is 
doubtless a lime carbonate from cave or sirring deposits in Italy, Alge- 
ria, or Egypt. The Church of San Miniato, in Florence, has likewise 
live windows of similar material. The adaptability of the Mexican 
onyx for certain forms of interior decoration is well shown iu the col- 
umns and arch about the entrance of the ark containing the manuscripts 
of the pentateuch in the new Jewish Synagogue on Fifth avenue, JS^ew 
York City. 

In modern times the Algerian onyx has been largely used by the 
French for interior decoration, as in the grand staircase of the Parisian 
opera house, aud in the uuiuufacture of tops for small stands, turned 
columns, tables, lampstands, clocks, and similar articles for household 
use and adornment. The same may be said regarding those of Mexico 
and the United States. The native Mexicans utilize small pieces in the 
manufacture of pajter weights and knives, penholders, inkstands, card 
receivers, and plaques, which are sold to tourists. In the United States 
the material has been utilized, in addition, in the construction of man- 
tels and fireplaces, some of which are very elaborate. In some of our 
modern hotels there is a lavish display, but m only too many cases, as in 
the Auditorium at Chicago, most astonishingly poor taste has been 
shown. The walls are simply sheathed with slabs, apparently without 
any attempt at selection as to quality, color, or veination, but one laid on

after another as carelessly as bricks iu a wall. One-half of the amount 
of material might have been more effective had proper taste been exer- 
cised. It is Avorthy of remark that our architects, decorators, and arti- 
sans of to-day seem to rely for effect wholly upon perfection of surface 
and color, beauty of design and excellence of execution being alnu)st 
Avholly overlooked. Everywhere are Hat surfaces, moldings, and machine- 
made columns, all brilliantly polished, but nothing more. Yet the stone 
will cut to as sharp an edge as the finest Carrara marble, and is emi- 
nently adapted for bas-relief, small statues, busts, and objects of like 
nature. Its transluceucy and ever varying shades of color, so far from 
being defects, are, under proper treatment, actual merits, and it seems 
almost unaccountable that they have so long been overlooked. Modern 
manulacturers are not infrequently guilty of the utterly reprehensible 
custom of seeking to improve the paler hues by paint or other coloring 
materials applied to the back or unexposed side of the thin slabs, the 
transluceucy of the stone being just sufficient to transnut the colors, 
without permitting its cause to be discovered. This is especially the 
case with much of the Parisian work now brought into America, but 
unfortunately the practice is not confined to the French. 

CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. 

As has been noted, the onyx marbles consist essentiallv of carbonate 
of lime crystallized in the form of calcite; very rarel/as aragonite. 
The results of quantitative chemical analyses of some of the princi- 
pal varieties are given in the accompanying table. As will be noted, 
the percentage of lime carbonate rarely falls below 90. J^-ext to the 
hme, iron as carbonate or oxide forms the most prominent constituent, 
and IS apparently the main cause of color variation, the tints depending 
upon its state of combination, whether as carbonate or sesquioxide! 
The small amounts of manganese may have some effect, but this could 
not be ascertained with any degree of certainty. It is interesting to 
note that the almost milk-white varieties from San Luis Obispo, Calffor- 
nisi (25571), and Lower California (08240) carry, respectively, 3.03 and 
2.70 per cent, of iron, calculated as carbonate (FeCO^). The most pro- 
nonnced green and brown varieties carry but from 4.19 to 5.51 per cent, 
of the carbonate, while the faintly tinted greens from Lower Calilbruia 
run as high as 7.49 per cent. As a rule, it seems safe to say that the 
green and red-brown colors are due to this ferruginous constituent, the 
green colors containing the iron as a carbonate, and the ocher red, yel- 
low, and browns being derived, therefore, by a process of oxidation^ as 
noted on p. o48. Certain amber browns and yellows, (and iu one case a 
bright tiesh-piuk color), as exemplified in the stones from Suisin City 
and Sulpliur Creek, California, and in all the stalagmitic marbles, both 
American and Egyptian, are, however, due to organic matter, all burn- 
ing white, giving off the characteristic empyrenmatic odor, and showing 
but the merest traces, if any, of metallic oxides. It ma v fnrther be said

that the most constant distinction between those of the onyx marbles 
which are spring deposits and those which are formed in caves is the 
absence, in the hitter, of appreciable quantities of metallic oxides. This 
is presumably' to be accounted for on the supposition that the cave mar- 
bles result from the solvent action of cold carbonated water on limestone 
containing, aside from the iron oxides, only mechanically included 
impurities which do not enter at all into solution, but remain in the form 
of the ochreous residual clays which are so characteristic of limestone 
caverns the world over. The travertines, on the other hand, result from 
the solvent action of heated solutions on deep-seated siliceous rock, and 
which as a result carry not merely lime, but a considerable proportion 
of rarer constituents as well. That these rarer constituents are not 
more abundant in the deposits themselves is due to their unequal solu- 
l)ility and the consequent fractional separation which takes place on 
evaporation. This separation has already been alluded to, on p. 549. 
The reverse of the above-stated rule does not always hold good, since, 
as above noted, the Suisin City deposit, which is a travertine, contains 
scarcely a trace of iron. The percentage of manganese, as will be 
noticed, is, with but two exceptions less than one-half of one per cent. 
These exceptions are (I) a faintly greenish stone from Lower California, 
and (-) a pure milk white variety from Lake Oroomiah, the latter yield 
ing 4.34 per cent, of this material calculated as a carbonate, (MnCOs) 
or 2.68 per cent, when calculated as oxide (MnO). The magnesium car- 
bonate is almost invariably present in small amounts, and singularly 
enough is highest in the cold-water (cave) deposit from Syout, Egypt 
(01336), where it reaches 0.88 per cent. Careful tests were made for the 
rarer elements, but with negative results in the most cases, the Suisin 
City stone showing 1.59 per cent, of strontium carbonate; that from the 
Hacienda del Carmen, Mexico (01337), 1.34 per cent, of calcium sulphate, 
and that from San Luis Obispo 0.25 per cent, of tricalcic phosphate, 
Ca:,(P04)2. The milk white stone from Lake Oroomiah yielded 2.30 per 
cent, of calcium sulphate and 0.24 per cent, of tricalcic phosphate. 

In order to illustrate the possible changes in color from secondary 
oxidation, pis. 5, 0, and 7, are given. The slabs were all sawn from the 
same block, not above 10 inches in thickness, and which was at first 
supposed to be nearly uniform throughout. In pi. 5, it will be observed, 
there is a wide vein of ocherous brown extending somewhat diagonally 
from top to bottom, with smaller veins cutting it from left to right. In 
the second slab the vein has extended so as to include the whole upper 
left section, while in the third the original green has been almost wholly 
obliterated. It is easy to perceive that this change in color has been 
brought about wholly through the oxidizing influence of percolating 
solutions which followed the lines of existing flaws. In no case that 
has thus far come under my observation am I inclined to regard these 
veins and dashes of red and brown as original, but as results of secon- 
dary oxidation.

560 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Au intermediate stage in the process is shown in the small block 
figured on pi. 8, where oxidation has gone on from all sides until only 
a nucleal mass of green remains, into which the oxidizing process was 
extending along the lines of deposition, much as the process of serpen- 
tinizatiou extends along the curvilinear cracks of an olivine granule. 

Two independent analyses of the green and oxidized portions from 
this specimen (67825) yielded in the one case 5..j1 per cent, of iron car- 
bonate (FeCOa) for the green variety, and 4.06 per cent, of the carbon- 
ate, and 1.73 per cent, of sesquioxide (Fe20,t) for the brown. In the 
second case 4.27 per cent, of FeCOs in the green variety, and but 1.22 
per cent, of the same salt in the brown, with 3.53 per cent, of the ses- 
quioxide. In both cases the total amount of iron calculated as Fe seems 
a trifle the largest in the oxidized portion (2.65 per cent, in the green 
as against 3.06 per cent, in the brown). 

The completed stage of oxidation is shown in pi. 15. The original 
green color is wholly effaced, and the block, when cut across the grain, 
gives a unique combination of red-brown colors which, together with 
the original lines of deposition, give an appearance so like that of cer- 
tain tapestries that I have given it the name of tapestry onyx. 

In a few instances the shades of color are produced by mechanically 
included impurities, as in pi. 12, from a specimen from San Luis Obispo, 
California. Visitors to the California pavilion in the mines building 
during the Exposition at Chicago in 1893 will recall the beautiful and 
unique pictures in stone there shown. This coloring matter, in its 
various shades of smoky brown, is due to inclusions of clay parallel to 
the plane of deposition. It would appear that during the time the 
stone was being deposited the waters became temporarily charged with 
silt, which settled in thin films over the uneven, often botryoidal sur- 
faces already formed, to become entombed in the mass of the stone 
when the onyx-forming stage was resumed. 

In structure the onjx marbles are invariably holocrystalline, some- 
times granular, but much more commonly with a fibrous or radiating 
columnar structure, the fibers or columns being composed of calcite 
crystals elongated in the direction of their principal axes and standing 
at approximately right angles to the jdane of deposition, as noted by 
Sorby* in deposits of similar origin. 

Twin forms so characteristic of the calcite of metamorphosed sedi- 
mentary deposit, or even the secondary calcite in veins and cavities of 
eruptive rocks, are quite lacking. Mechanical inclosures of any kmd 
are almost wholly wanting, as may be inferred from the analyses. The 
banded aragonite from New Mexico (60631) shows the dark color to be 
due to included particles of a coal-black color, which give reactions for 
manganese oxide. 

The characteristic banding or •' grain" of the stone is due to lines of 
accretion comparable with the lines of growth upon the trunk of a tree,

each layer represeiitiug successive surfaces over and ujion which the 
lime-holding solutions have deposited new materials. In some instances 
the successive layers vary more or less in character of crystallization 
and color, due to a slight change in contents of organic matter or metal- 
lic oxides, or physical conditions, whereby the material, is rendered 
more or less opaque. The characteristic feature which above all others 
adds beauty to the stone is its trauslucency, which is a purely physical 
quality. As a rule the crystallization, in sound blocks, continues unin- 
terruptedly upward through the successive layers for a distance of 
several millimeters, so that there is no tendency toward separation 
along these layers until a point is reached where, owing to impurities 
in the water, or it may be a temporary cessation of deposition, crystal- 
lization ceased. On beginning once more, such lines not infrequently 
form lines of weakness. A not uncommon structure is that shown in 
lig. 1 of pi. 9. Crystallization starts from a series of points on a 
preexisting surface and progresses upward and outward forming 
a series of inverted cones. This structure is evident only on close 
inspection and in slabs suflticiently thin to be translucent. 

Asa natural consequence of its mode of deposition the surface struc- 
ture is usually botryoidal. Cut across the plane of deposition the 
structure is then as shown in flg. 1 of pi. 1. Cut at right angles to 
this, the structure, owing to the wavy, botryoidal nature of the original 
surfaces, is often wonderfully beautiful and always interesting. The 
colors continually appear and reappear in varying degrees of intensity 
accordingly as they lie upon the immediate surface or are subdued by 
intervening layers of colorless material. One sees in fact not merely 
the colors which lie upon the surface, but those beneath as well, sub- 
dued, enhanced, enriched it may be, by those which overlie or lie 
beneath. It is in this characteristic that lies the chief claim for beauty, 
and its entire separation from marbles of the common, sedimentary 
type. The figures given on the pis. 14, 17 and 18 will serve to show, 
so far as is possible by photograph, the varying structure described. 

The cave marbles are as a rule much less translucent than the trav- 
ertines, coarser in crystallization, and hence more liable to fracture. 
They are, moreover, less homogeneous, containing many cavities and 
interspaces which have never been filled. In the columnar forms a 
pronounced zonal structure is common, as shown in the cross and longi- 
tudinal sections in figs. 3 and 4 on pi. 13. In the more massive forms 
we find the bandings as in the travertines, but without the delicate 
crystallization. 

LOCALITIES: DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN. 

Arizona. — Several deposits of onyx have within a few years been 

located in Arizona, though so far as at present known to the writer, but 

two are of such extent as to be of any commercial value. These two 

are both in Yavapai County, and possess many characters in common. 

H. Mis. 184, pt. 2 36 



562 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1S93. 

The first to be described lies at Mayers Station , ou the stage road lead- 
ing from Prescott to l*ii(enix, and some 28 miles southeast of the tirst- 
iiamed town, which at time of writing, is the nearest accessible point 
by rail. What stone has thus far been shipped is hauled by waoon to 
Prescott, and by the Prescott and Arizona Central liailroad 70 miles 
north to the Atlantic and Pacihc Railroad, which affords an outlet botii 
east and west, as occasion demands. At time of writing there is how- 
ever, in process of construction a new line connecting the Santa Fe 
system on the north with the Southern Pacific, and which will pass 
snffi(uently near the deposits to greatly diminish the hauling distance 
as well as afford the benefit of competing freight rates furnished by the 
two lines. The deposits occur on the western side of what for a con- 
siderable portion of the year is a dry ravine, but which in the winter 
and rainy season carries a variable and often turbulent body of water, 
and rejoices in the name of Big Bug Creek. The country rock is highly 
metamorphic schist standing nearly on edge with occassional dikes of 
basic eruptives. The onyx proper occurs interbedded with a coarse 
breccia formed ofschistose and dioritic fragments embedded in a sandy 
and calcareous matrix, the entire formation occupying a low range of 
hills, of which an area of 200 acres is estimated by the company to 
comprise all the quarryable material. Standing at the stage station and 
looking westward across the creek, one sees the low blufts of onyx where 
the edges of the bed have been exposed in the work of exploitation. At 
first glance the outlook is not inspiring. The rock weathers gray and 
rusty brown, breaks down under the prolonged exposure to which it has 
been subjected, and appears like anything but the beautiful stone it 
really is. Closer inspection is, however, more assuring. At the shal- 
low openings that had been made in the bluffs and on the top of the 
hill, at the time of the- writer's visit (1891), the onyx occurred in 
irregular somewhat concentric layers, (pi. 2), from the fraction of 
an inch to 2 or more feet in thickness, and wliich are traversed par- 
allel with the plane of deposition by wavy bands of color in all shades 
of amber, white, ocher yellow, brown, dee}) ocherous red, and green 
of a most beautiful emerald shade. The sound layers of stone are 
separated from one another by porous cellular layers, so that slabs 
of large size can be obtained only by cutting parallel with the banding; 
/. e., with the plane of deposition. This in itself is no drawback, since 
the colors blend much better and the general effect is vastly richer 
than when cut across the grain. No two of the openings show mate- 
rial of exactly the same nature as to color and markings, or as to 
size and thickness of the blocks. In all, the stone lies in layers 
readily separable from one another, and which, as a rule, thicken 
and thiu out irregularly. The more highly colored varieties carry, 
as shown by analysis, nearly 5 per cent, of carbonate of iron. Through 
•the oxidizing effect of percolating solutions this carbonate has in 
many instances been converted into a more or less hydrated oxide, 
whereby the green is changed to red, brown, or amber-yellow colors in

all sliades. This oxidation has naturally followed along the lines of 
jointing" and penetrated the more porous layers, so that what were once 
large blocks of homogeneous green are now surrounded by a crust of 
varying thickness of the oxidation product. All stages of the process 
are seen at the various openings, from those in which the green stone 
is covered with a mere crust, and scarcely sufficiently veined to give a 
desired variety, to those in which scarcely a trace of the original green 
remains, but the whole block is of a red brown color in varying shades. 
At times the oxidation has been accompanied with a removal of so 
large a proportion of the lime carbonate that the texture is destroyed; 
the stone becomes somewhat cellular or spongy, and does not acquire 
a good surface and polish. In other cases, the stone still retains its 
compact structm e and susceptibility to a high polish, though necessa- 
rily it loses its transluceucy and becomes quite opaque. Nevertheless, 
the stone is by no means undesirable for either furniture toppings or 
for decorative purposes. The colors are rich but not gaudy, and, when 
properly prepared, are capable of effects both unique and beautiful. 
There is in the National Museum a slab of the oxidized stone ((30845) of 
brown and red color so cut with the grain as to resemble in a wonder- 
ful degree a piece of antique tapestry, (pi. 15.) The details of its 
structure are intricate in the extreme, and since what is to be seen by 
a careful study of them depends almost wholly on the vividness of 
one's imagination, the writer drops the subject to be taken up, it may be, 
by those more gifted, either in imagination or in the faculty of expres- 
sion. This type of onyx, I may say, differs from anything 1 have seen 
elsewhere, and, while the present workers regard it as valueless, and it 
is doubtful if the quarries can be relied upon to produce any large 
supply, or even two blocks alike, I still regard it as a beautiful stone, 
and one well worthy of consideration. In certain of the outcrops no 
green at all appears, but the stone lies in somewhat wavy layers of 
from 1 or 2 to 12 or 15 inches in thickness, and which are traversed by 
narrow alternating bands of brown, white, yellow, and sometimes pink. 
This variety of onyx is more granular in structure— due to coarse crys- 
tallization—than the green onyx, less translucent, and, on the whole, 
much less desirable. It is, nevertheless, a tine marble. Owing to the 
wavy nature of the bands, they appear and disappear in the form of 
veins, blotches, streaks, and clouds of varying intensity in color when 
the stone is sawn into slabs. The compact, highly lustrous green stone, 
with a surface almost as close as enamel, and with its veins and dashes 
of red and brown, is, however, the most desirable of all. 

The so-called Cave Creek quarries of Arizona are also in Yavapai 
County, but in the extreme soutliern part, near the Mariposa County 
line. At present they are accessible only from Phoenix, and over a 
road the latter 12 to 20 miles of which is hilly in the extreme. In 
riding over it one can but be reminded of a saying in reference to 
the Territory to the effect that "If Arizona 'd been laid flat it would be 
bigger'u any two States in the Union." But to reach the market the 



564 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

quarried stone must be dragged on wagons over this 50 miles of roadway 
to riioeuix, and tlience sliipped by rail. With tliis great drawback, 
coupled with high freight imposed by a railroad free from competition, 
tlie <]uarries labor under great disadvantage, 

Tlie country rock here is a slaty schist injected with quartz porphyries 
and diorites, all sporadically overlaid by basalt, the diorite cropping 
out in the rounded foothills, and weathering reddish. The main onyx 
letlge lies on the western slope of alow basalt-capped hill. The lowest 
underlying rock, as exposed in the creek bed a few rods below the 
quarry, is also basalt, but of a coarse texture and gray color. In the 
quarry opening the lowest rock exposed is a calcareous breccia, formed 
of fragments of slate and pebbles of basic eruptive rocks cemented by 
i\ friable travertine. At the time of the writer's visit (August, 1S92) the 
©ntcrop, as exposed by digging, was some 200 yards in length and pre- 
sented some remarkable features. The maximum thickness of the bed 
was about 10 feet. As exposed, it was not, however, continuous, but 
evidently had been thrown out of place and more or less shattered and 
broken by the extrusion of the basalt, the face of the quarry having 
the appearance shown in pi. 10. 

The prevailing colors here, as at Mayers Station, are green and yel- 
lowish, with veins of ocherous brown and red. The tints are beautiful 
in the extreme, and the best quality of the stone is certainly very tine. 
Clear uniformly green stone is not to be had in blocks of any size, but 
all are filled with reticulating veins. There is a large amount of waste 
material in the stone thus far removed, owing to the oxidation which 
has gone on in the same manner as at Big Bug Creek. There are also 
occasional small masses of chalcedonic quartz. The deposit is unique, 
in that the largest blocks thus far obtained have their greatest dimen- 
sions at right angles with the plane of deposition. Slabs 4 feet wide 
could thus be cut across the grain, and while by this method the beau- 
tiful blending of the colors is lost, still the wood-like grain, or onyx-like 
banding, is thus brought out, and is greatly preferred by some. At date 
of writing nearly all the material thus far quarried has been literally 
dug out of the tufaceous material, in the form of corroded, irregular 
blocks of all shapes, and in sizes including at most but a few cubic feet 
What the large bed will yield, and how far it extends into the hill, is 
yet to be ascertained. (See pi 11.) 

California. — Within the State limits of California are several deposits 
of onyx marble, which may, with the increasing wealth of the country, 
become important sources of supply. At present but one is actively 
worked, difficulty of access and cost of transportation, together with 
a limited market on the Pacific Coast, operating against an extensive 
development. The most noted of these deposits, and indeed the only 
one that has yet proven of any commercial importance, is located near 
the town of Musick, San Luis Obispo County, in the heart of the Santa 
Lucia Mountains. According to the report of the State mineralogist*

there are two openings or outcroppings, some half a mile apart, 
lying in sections 9 and 16 of township 31 sonth, range 15 east, INIount 
Diablo meridian. The inclosing rock is a slaty sandstone, the ledges 
standing nearly on edge and having a thickness of about 10 feet. The 
outcroppings lie one on the northern slope of the ridge and the other 
on the southern, the hill rising about 80 feet between them. Whether 
the two are parts of the same vein or bed is as yet unknown. The 
strike of the more northern croppings is directly toward the southern, 
though that of the southern is diagonal to the course of the others. 
The stone is very close in texture, acquires a high lustrous polish, and 
shows when cut across the grain a beautiful wood-like banding. The 
colors are quite variable, but not so pronounced as those ot Arizona. 
White, translucent, with a pearly luster, is the prevailing type, but 
pinkish and purple shades, with tinges of blue, orange, red, and olive, 
are not uncommon, the colors being sometimes in blotches and some- 
times in veins. A peculiar translucent, smoky variety is not uncommon, 
resembling some varieties of true alabaster. A pair of columns pre- 
pared some time ago excited considerable admiration from showing two 
apparent geode-like cavities lined with crystals of burnished gold set 
in a dark olive and purple ground. In reality no cavities existed, the 
stone being solid and sound throughout. 

One of the most remarkable and uniqne varieties, but which occurs 
only sporadically, is of a translucent white, but so injected jiarallel 
with the bedding with argillaceous matter as to give most wonderful 
cloud-like effects, such as words can not satisfactorily describe. Vis- 
itors to the California pavilion at the World's Columbian Exposition 
at Chicago in 1893 will recall the unique pictures in stone there displayed 
by the Kesseler Brothers, of San Francisco. In some slabs the dark 
coloring matter was so distributed as to give the effects of jjrecipitous 
mountains, with tops in the clouds and lakes and valleys at their feet. 
In others the effect was as if the surface were roughly mammillated with 
smoky clouds of varying degrees of density. In all these forms the slabs 
must be cut moderately thin and parallel to the bedding and viewed by 
transmitted light in order to bring out the best effects. (PI. 12.) The 
coloring matter in these cases was found to be mechanically included 
clay, which remained as a muddy sediment in the bottom of the beaker 
when the stone was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, as already noted. 

It is stated in the report above referred to that the stone could 
be taken out in blocks 10 feet square (thickness not stated) with- 
out a flaw. The material is hauled by wagon from the quarries to 
Musick, and shii^ped thenc^e by rail to San Francisco, where it is 
worked up. Active and systematic quarrying was begun here in the 
summer of 1890. 

Several years ago a resinous travertine occurring as superficial 
deposits on a bare hillside near Suisun City, in Solano County ,wa8 
worked somewhat spasmodically, but was soon abandoned, owing in part, 
it is said, to the damage done by injudicious blasting. It is probable, 



566 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

however, tliat but little could have beeu done under the most favorable 
of circumstances, owing to color and textural qualiticatious. The stone 
varies in color from light amber to deep resinous brown, and often shows 
most beautifully the peculiar wavy, undulatory bands of color so char- 
acteristic of rocks of this class. Both color and texture are, however, 
variable, and it is impossible to obtain slabs of any size that are not 
rendered undesirable through porous layers, or monotonous and even 
objectionable from their dull resinous hues. tSome beautiful material 
was here obtained, and doubtless more might yet be found, but Amer- 
icans, and tliose who call themselves such, have yet to learn how to 
conduct such an enterprise profitably. Another small deposit that was 
worked to some extent exists on Sulphur Creek, in Colusa County 
This is a very beautiful stone, of a rich deep-brown color, with bedding 
veins of lighter yellowish-brown. The quantity is said to be quite 
limited and to be obtained only in blocks of small size. The coloring 
matter in both these cases is wholly organic, analyses showing scarcely 
a trace of metallic oxides or other impurities. In the reports of the 
State mineralogist the Sulphur Creek stone is described as occurring 
in the form of a vein cousistiugof two seams, each about 5 inches thick. 
A quantity of the rough stone was at one time sent to England, where 
it found a ready market. Some onyx of a light-brown color, beautifully 
veined, occurs in the quarries of the Colton jNIarble Company, in San 
Bernardino County. It is said to have been used only to a slight 
extent. The writer never having seen samples, can express no opinion 
regarding its qualities. Near Crescent Falls, on the Sacramento River, 
6 miles below Sisson, in Siskiyou County, is still another deposit, yield- 
ing material of a beautiful emerald-green color. I am informed by Mr. 
J. S. Diller, of the U. S. Geological Survey, that the stone occurs onlj' 
in the form of a vein 4 to G inches wide in granite, the vein being open 
in the middle and allowing the escape of an excellent spring of soda 
sulphur water. The deposit is very irregular and of limited extent 
along the strike, and probably also limited in depth. It is too irregular 
to furnish large slabs and of too small extent to afford any con- 
siderable quantity of material. Onyx marbles have also been reported 
at Gold Euu, in Placer County ; Las Penas-qintos Creek, San Diego 
County; Oro Grande, San Bernardino County; Vacaville, Solano 
County ; Geyserville, SonomaConnty; Tuscan Springs, Tehama County; 
Three Rivers, in Tulare County; near the head waters of Eel River, 
in Lake County; Bridgeport, Mono County; Little Castaca Cafion, Los 
Angeles County, and on Santa Catalina Island. None of these have, 
however, as yet been shown to be of sufficient extent to have any 
commercial value, nor has the writer seen any of the material. 

Eastern Appalachian L'egion. — The valley of Virginia, extending 
throughout the entire length of the State, running in a southwesterly 
direction from Harpers Ferry on the north, is underlaid by limestones of 
Silurian or Cambrian age. Percolating waters, acting through untold 
years, have dissolved out, in these, numerous caverns in the manner

already described. The Luray Caves, in Page Coimty, and Weyers Cave, 
in Augusta County, are among the most widely known of these. There 
are, however, hundreds of smaller and less interesting ones, whicli may 
have become wholly or partially refilled by stalactitic and stalagmitic 
matter. Very many instances present themselves in which portions of 
tlie roofs or sides of these caves have been removed by erosion, leaving 
the white, (!reamy, or amber yellow stalagmitic material exposed on the 
surface, where it shows up in strong contrast with the dull gray lime- 
stone which forms the i)revailing country rock. It has not infrequently 
happened that these deposits, are of sufficient extent to M^irrant the 
opening of small quarries, though the stone is rarely of sufficient 
beauty to enter into active competition with the onyx marbles of Mex- 
ico, Arizona, California, or Algeria, with which they are chemically 
almost identical. Nevertheless fine blocks are fre(juently obtainable, 
showing a pronounced banded structure when cut across the ijlane of 
de])osition (pi. 13), and it is rather to be regretted that no more suc- 
cessful attempts have been made toward keeping them upon the market. 
Such attempts as have been made have almost uniformly failed, partly 
ownig to a lack of definite knowledge as to the character of the depos- 
its on the part of those in control, and partly from the fact that the 
work was undertaken on too extensive a scale. The average American 
has yet to learn that a small business, carefully conducted, may be a 
surer source of income than many of the gigantic schemes which flood 
the country to-day. The managers of the caverns above alluded to 
might add materially to their incomes, as well as to the satisfactiouof their 
visitors, by exposing for sale small objects made from such blocks of 
stalactite or stalagmite as could be spared without defacement of the 
cave. So lar as the writer is aware it is only at Mammoth Cave, in 
Kentucky, that any attempt is made in this line, and here one finds 
only a few small charms and paper weights manufactured at odd 
moments by the natives. Near Harrisonburg, in Owen County, are con- 
siderable deposits of stalagmitic material which have yielded small 
j)ieces of great beauty. An attempt was made not long ago to work 
the quarries, but with little success. The marble dealers, knowing 
they could not be relied upon as constant sources of material, ignored 
them utterly, and it will not be until our wealthier classes learn to 
more fully appreciate home products that we may hoi)e t3 see these 
marbles receive the attention they deserve.* Nevertheless it is not 

*It must lie acknowledged, however, that the difficulty lies not wholly with the 
wealthier classes, who can scarcely be expected to admire or demand auy article con- 
ceruiuy the existence of which they are ignoraut. Americans abroad pay fancy prices 
for small articles of ornament and art simply for the reason that these are everywhere 
exposed for sale, and the attention is at once attracted. Let but the American exert 
ecpial taste and patience in Avorking up our native materials, and it is possible we 
might be able to tell f^uite another story. Brazilian agates, colored and polished iu 
(Germany, are sold to the tourists of Colorado and other Western resorts as local 
products, and 1 have seen the so-called "tiger-eye" (Crocidolite) from South Africa 
sold by dealers in Montana to the unsuspecting tourist as fossil wood from Auzona. 



568 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

uncommon to find mantels and chimney pieces of the stone in the 
houses of people living- in the vicinity. Such, as a rale, are the work of 
local stone dealers, and cut from blocks fouud loose in the fields. Fine 
blocks of stone from caves that have been almost completely refilled 
have been found near Lexington, in Eockbridg^e County, a slab some 
18 inches square of which is among the collections of the National 
Museum. In one of the extreme southwestern counties deposits 
of this nature Avere worked some thirty years ago by a local stone- 
cutter, bnt who, it needs scarcely be said, was a foreigner. The 
material, singularly enough, was utilized mainly for tombstones. As a 
result the churchyards of the region present an appearance quite 
unique, and wholly unlike anytliing I ever saw elsewhere. In place of 
the white marbhvs, gray granite, or dull slate of the ordinary church- 
yard, we find here rows of white, amber, and resinous stalagmitic mar- 
bles, some of which are translucent and still beautiful in spite of their 
years of exposure, though naturally roughened and in some cases badly 
flawed and seamed. 

Quarries in the broken-down caves of eastern Tennessee, southwest- 
ern Missouri, and Arkansas have also been opened and worked for a 
limited period, some of them furnishing a fair grade of material, but 
for which there proved only a limited market. The attempt is invariably 
made to utilize the product mainly for furniture tops ami wainscotings, 
in M'hich line it must be brought into competition with the more desir- 
able travertines and high-grade decorative colored marbles, as those of 
Siena and Algeria. For small ornaments, vases, columns, and certain 
forms of bas-relief the material is best adapted, and it is of little use 
to seek a market elsewhere. 

Colorado, Utah, and New 2Iexieo. — Deposits in every way similar 
to those noted above have been reported from Colorado, and, indeed, 
are likely to occur in any limestone country. Dark and light amber 
varieties were exhibited as from Pelican Point, Utah County, in the 
Utah exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. A much 
more striking variety was in the form of bright lemon and orange, 
dark bnfi', and chrome yellow and white slabs from deposits near Lehi, 
in the same Territory. The stone was beautifully translucent and 
the colors of astonishing depth and brilliancy — so much so that it at 
first seemed scarcely possible that they could be natural. The writer 
was informed by Mr. F. T. Millis that the material occurs in the form 
of a vein some 4 feet in width in limestone. Near Eio Puerco Station of 
the Atlantic and Pacific Kailroad, in Valencia County, New Mexico, are 
deposits of travertine, or stalagmitic matter, which have been exploited 
thus far only in a ]>reliminary way. The stone varies from whitish to 
deep smoky, almost black, and from translucent to opaque. The better 
varieties show on a polished surface a silky luster and a radiating 
fibrous structure. It is distinctly banded parallel with the plane of 
deposition, tfie bands varying from faintly whitish to nearly black, the 
dark bands being mere lines of inclosures. The stone, while lacking

in riclmess of color, is, owing- to its luster and fibrous structure, very 
attractive. The specific gravity is L>.S8; before the blowpipe it turns 
white and crumbles away, agreeing in these as well as its fibrous struc- 
ture with the properties of aragonite. 

2[exwo.— To the average American the name onyx is inseparable from 
that of Mexico, since from this source has, until withiu a few years, 
been brought the almost entire commercial supply, though small quan- 
tities are imported from Algeria and Egypt. 

There are many small, sporadic occurrences of onyx throughout the 
volcanic areas south of the city of Mexico, and doubtless in other parts 
of the republic as well, but which are as yet unknown or uuworked owing 
to lack of facilities for transportation. Until quite recently the prin- 
cipal source has been the region southeast of Pnebla, between Tecali, 
Tzicatlacoya, and Tepene. Recently deposits have been found near 
San Antonio.* The underlying rock, so far as I am able to glean, is m 
most cases a Cretaceous limestone, though frequently associated with 
recent lavas. Those deposits now worked are naturally along or near 
the lines of railway leading to Vera Cruz and the city of Mexico. 

The stone of these localities has been worked from a very early period 
of American history, perhaps even before the advent of the Spaniards 
and the blotting out of Aztec civilization. The best modern account 
of the quarries, if such they can be called, that I am able to find is that 
given by an unknown writer in the Engineering and Mining Journal for 
December 26, 1891. On this I have drawn very largely in the descrip- 
tions given below, although I cannot vouch for its accuracy. 

Among the Aztecs the stone was so highly prized for its beauties that 
it was deemed too sacred to be given to the ordinary uses of common 
mortality, and was devoted almost solely to the ornamentation of reli- 
gious edifices or the manufacture of sacrificial vessels. So strict and 
arbitrary was this limitation on its use that its Indian name, "tecali," 
is merely a corruption of the Aztec word "teocall" (Lord's mansion), 
a name given by the Indians to their temples.t With Cortez and his 
freebooting followers the stone found as high favor, while with that 
peculiarity that always distinguished them of picking out the best under 
all circumstances, the padres regarded it as a most meet and proper 
offering to the church from the devout. Altars and baptismal fonts 
were always made of it when it could be obtained, and among the most

notable sights connected with a tour of Mexico are tlie magnificent 
collections of articles of this marble which are to be found in many 
churches, particularly that in the cathedrals of the cities of Mexico and 
Puebla, and in the churches of Leon, Queretaro, and Guadalajara, 
several of which contain perfect slabs 3 and 4 feet square, an extraor- 
dinary size on account of the small and irregular shape iu which the 
stone is found. 

During recent years fashion has taken up what the ])riests of these 
two religions thus marked with their approval, and the stone under the 
name of Mexican onyx, with its capricious markings, has become so 
well known as to make a detailed description of its different varieties 
unnecessary. To those who have made its acquaintance, though only 
through the medium of the ordinary onyx table top, clock, or the 
interior ornamentations of public buildings, beautiful as such are, it 
Avould be hard to convey a correct idea of the exquisite beauties of the 
tiner grades of the marble. While the ordinary grades commonly 
encountered probably surpass iu elegance any similar material, it is 
oidy in the light and dark green, the ivory-colored, the brilliantly 
banded, and the dark-red varieties that a full realization of the stone 
at its best is had. 

iu the quarries the stone is found iu the form of detached masses, 
ranging in size from a few inches up to 10 or 12 cubic feet. Larger 
sizes are occasionally found, but so rarelj^ that the event is a notable 
one, while the value per cubic foot is correspondingly increased. For 
example, the value of a piece containing 1 or 2 cubic feet would be 
estimated to be ordinarily $3 per cubic foot iu Mexican money, but 
were the piece to contain 25 or 30 cubic feet, the valuation would be 
about $15 j)er cubic foot. This is for ordinary stock; with green and 
the other finer grades it would be very difficult to form any estimate 
whatever. This smallness of available sizes is one of the principal 
defects of the stone, and one with which the best skill has battled in 
vain. With its other defects, that of occasional fiaws or holes, ranging 
from a tenth of an inch to 2 or 3 inches iu diameter, more success has 
been had iu remedying the negligence of nature by filling the smaller 
with a cement mixed with powdered portions of the stone, while in the 
larger a piece of the onyx is very often boldly inlaid with such skill as 
to defy detection on a cursory inspection. With the growing inability 
to supply the demand for onyx, this last method of making the most 
out of what remains of the stone has been pursued to a great extent, 
and with very good success except where the article so "improved" is 
subjected to sudden changes of tempeiature, in which case the effect 
of our northern climate at once becomes apparent, and the best of 
work under the irregular processes of expansion and contraction soon 
becomes unsightly. Almost as common but a more questionable 
method of "improving" the stone is that of sawing the inferior qual- 
ities that lack color into very thiu slabs, so thin as to be almost 
translucent. These are then operated on by an "artist," who adorns

one side with a variety of colors and peucilings that make a very fair 
counterfeit of the real first-class article, after which the side that is 
painted is covered with a coatinj^- of very tine cement, which gives it 
the appearance of having been merely sawed and left unpolished. 
This class of work is often done so w^eil that when first finished it will 
deceive any but the sharpest of experts, but under a year or two of use, 
the swindle becomes apparent, and soon nothing remains but a thin, 
transparent slab of stone. 

The formation in which tlie marble or onyx is found is a tough, red- 
dish or dark-brown clay, overlying a closely cemented conglomerate. 
This is the usual form, but in one instance — that of the Antigua 
Salines, on the liancho del Carmen — it is found in a hard. Hint-like 
country rock which appears to be more of a bastard jasper than any- 
thing else. In this instance the onyx appears as a regular vein 
formation, the veins varying from 1 to 12 inches in width. 

Of the quarries themselves all are small. The most famous — La 
Pedrara, in the district of Tecali, 21 miles from the city of Puebia — 
does not cover more than 3 acres, while the average depth of the 
quarrying is not over 7 feet. The value of the onyx taken from this 
small area, though, is hard to realize. The high leputation of the stone 
is recognized the world over, but it is very doubtful if one-tenth of 
what has been sold as "■ La Pedrara" during the last quarter of a cen- 
tury ever came from it. At i)resent no attempt is made to work the 
quarry, in fact no indication of onyx in the place is to be seen; the 
only effort made in obtaining onyx from it being by sorting over the 
old dumps or refuse places which have accumulated during its active 
existence. From these is taken every piece of onyx that will square 
6 inches or over. The process is slow, while the yield is seemingly 
Aery small in return for the labor. The onyx obtained is of a very fine 
quality of green, ranging from a very light to a very dark tint, and, 
as a rule, showing a slight dash of red or pink. Occasional pieces of 
variegated colors are found which are very tine, while the texture is 
very good. 

Xext in inq)ortance to La Pedrara is AntUjua iSaJiiies, in the district 
of Tehaucan, and which has already been briefly mentioned on account 
of its peculiar geological formation. The quarry covers over an area 
not exceeding two acres, and forms the face of a hill about 250 feet 
high. lu working it, the system has been simply a process of gouging 
out the onyx and the rock which encases it, until into the side of the 
hill there has been excavated a hole 100 feet in width by 50 feet in 
height and 00 feet deep, looking very much as if an immense shovelful 
had been taken out. The onyx is variegated in colors, and is ranked 
next to La Pedrara. 

Ranking third, probably, in importance is La Sojiresa, which covers 
an area of about 5 acres, and is located about So miles west of Antigua 
Salines, in the same district. The onyx from this quarry is semitrans- 
hicent, white, totally devoid of colors, save where an occasional mass 



«^72 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

of green is fomid. The quarry has been worked for the last fifteen 
years only, and is at ])resent the largest producer of onyx in Mexico. 
Sizes ranging as large as from 2 to 3 feet square can be obtained, which 
is something extraordinary in Mexican onyx deposits, and the supply 
in "sighf'seems to be sufficient for several years. The total absence 
of any color to set off tlie pure white is to be regretted, but as it is, the 
demand for the stone is sufficient to tax the quarry to its utmost to 
supi)ly it. 

Directly east from Sopresa, about 4 miles, is found the quarry of La 
2lesa, lying, as its name indicates, on a level table-topped mountain. 
The quarry shows quite extensive working, the product being a varie- 
gated onyx, which, however, lacks the brilliancy shown in the stone of 
Antigua Salines. It covers an area of nearly 30 acres, being the largest 
quarry in Mexico. Occasionally quite large pieces are obtained,'but 
the. average sizes prepared for shipment will not exceed 15 by 10 by 6 
inches, while pieces as small as 10 by G by 10 inches are also shipped, 
both to Europe and America. This, however, is the case with all thl 
quarries, and it is the exception when pieces larger than the first 
mentioned are exported. 

In addition to the quarries here mentioned there are many others 
of less importance, either by reason of their small output or from having 
been worked out. Among these the most interesting, on account of 
historical associations or past records, are those known as El Mogote, 
Lajas, Agua Esconda, Desamparo, Mehauntepec, Tepeyac, Tecohico' 
La Paoma, and La Eeforma. ' 

Baja California.— ThQ last, and perhaps most important of the Amer- 
ican deposits to be described are also on Mexican territory, but on the 
peninsula of Lower or Baja California, near the Gulf Coast, and some 
150 miles south from San Diego. One of these, that at tlie Tule Arroyo, 
has been already sufficiently described on p. 547. The second deposit, 
or rather series of deposits, lies in the open desert some 3 to 5 miles to 
the southwest of the arroyo. The region is one of low rolling hills and 
flat-topped mesas, with shallow valleys and dry water courses. The 
prevailing rock, a friable sandstone, with alternating layers of calcare- 
ous conglomerate and onyx in isolated patches. The surface is every- 
where covered with irregularly rounded and angular fragments of 
eruptive rocks from ilie hills in the near vicinity.* Aside from the 
onyx and the charaeteristic lake bed deposits all traces of spring and 
lake action have long since disappeared, and (he region is an arid waste 
with only cacti, "sirios" [Fouquieria splendens) and the agave shaivi in 
ti\e immediate vicinity, with the mesquite, paolo verdes, stout, low-branch- 
ing elephant wood {veatchi Cedrocensis) and pole-like fouquieria colum- 
naris, or giant cactus {cerevs pringlei {!)) like clustered mill logs along 
the dry water courses or extending for dreary miles along the flat-topped

plateaux. The agave, the lefresliiug i)lumpaess of whose virgiu leaves 
stands out in marked contrast with the dried and shrunkeu forms of 
the flower-bearing adults, forms, together with the thorny Fouquieria 
splendens, the most striking floral feature of the waterless land. The 
onyx occurs in the form of spasmodic and isolated ])atches, sometimes 
forming apparently a superficial pavement upon the surface, or again, 
where the beds have been cut by the winding course of the now dry 
ravine in the form of three distinct layers, from 20 inches to 3 or more 
feet in thickness, interstratified with tufaceous and lake bed material. 
(PI. 10). 

Nothing can be more fascinating to the lover "of the beautiful in 
stoues than tliis occurrence, where huge blocks of material of almost 
ideal soundness, with ever varying shades of color and veination lie 
everywhere ex])osed in countless numbers. Under the blistering sun 
of an almost tropic climate the exposed blocks have become to some 
extent corroded, and covered upon their immediate surface with a thin 
film of oxidation products which just sufficiently disguise the true 
color and transluceucy to keep one running here and there, ever 
cracking off new fragments in the vain attempt to collect a fairly 
typical series. The colors are peculiarly delicate, and there is a 
wonderful uniformity in quality. Pearl white ( the virgin onyx), deli- 
cate rose tints, and light greens are the more co mmon, all variegated 
by a network of fine sharj) veins of a rose-red co lor, as shown in Plates 
17 and 18 The rose color is, so far as my present knowledge goes, 
quite unique and wonderfully beautiful. 

The analyses given in the table show this to be the most dense of any 
of the onyx marbles thus far examined. Although less highly colored 
than some of the Mexican varieties, it is nevertheless one of the most 
beautiful, owing to its uniform translucency, freedom from flaws, and 
fine veination. 

Algeria. — The celebrated dejjosits from whence the ancient Romans 
drew their supplies of onyx, alabaster, calcareous onyx, or oriental 
alabaster are situated in the northern part of Algeria, in the province 
of Oran. The deposits as now worked are two in number, one some 05 
miles from Oran, on the route to Tlemcen, and the second a few miles 
to the west, both lying to the right of the Isser. The first of these, 
known by the name of Bled Bekham, is divided into three parts by 
two ravines, the Oiied Abdallah on the east and the Oued Calkra on 
the west. M. Comynet estimates the area occupied here by the onyx 
as about 12 acres, and gives the following section: (1) A bed of 
about 4 feet thickness, under which lies compact travertine of no value j 
(2) a second bed of onyx 3 feet 4 inches thick, separated by impure 
travertine from a third bed of onyx 2 feet in thickness, and lastly, 
several thinner beds from to 16 inches in thickness, alternating 
with impure travertine, making in all a mean thickness of some 10 
feet of quarryable material. It was stated at the time that blocks of 
extraordinary size could be quarried for shafts, columns, or friezes, 



574 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

even up to L'O feet in length by 4 feet square. At this date it is stated 
bhicks may be liad 10 feet in length by 3 feet in width and thickness. 
The second deposit noted, called ArdJa-el-Beida, lies some 3 kilometers 
to the west of Bled Bekham, upon a plateau Avitli steep north, west, 
and south escarpments. It was once continuous with a bed called El 
Cellon, but from which it has become separated by a ravine called the 
Chabbat-Karonba. The onyx of this locality is said to be inferior to 
that of the first, both as regards quality and size of blocks obtainable. 
The beds vary in thickness from 30 inches with a total of some 10 feet, 
and cover an area of about 20 acres. All the deposits are Quaternary, 
and lie unconformably upon lime and sandstones of Tertiary (]Middle 
Miocene) age. The stone, as is usually the case, varies greatly in color 
and shade, from jjure white to rose-colored and bright red, golden yel- 
low, and, more rarely, green. The present quarriers (Sauville & Co., 
Paris) divide the output into four classes, le Blanc, le Ruhaune ov Yeine^ 
le Cacheniire and le Cachemire hois. The white (blanc) variety is the 
more abundant, and is found in nearly all the quarries, occurring in 
layers sometimes upward of a meter in thickness, and blocks have 
been removed containing upwards of 5 cubic meters. It varies from 
translucent to opaque, sometimes milk white or veined with fine ribbons 
of pale yellow. The milk-white variety is employed for columns, arti- 
cles used in religious ceremonies, and in place of ordinary white marble 
in furniture. The translucent variety is employed in statuary, and has, 
besides, many other applications, as for the glazing of church windows 
and for shades. The ribboned or veined onyx is also abundant, and 
there are many places for its extraction. The ribbons are parallel with 
the plane of deposition, and of a clear deep yellow, sometimes rose or 
violet tint. Other irregular veins traverse the stone in all directions, 
giving very beautiful effects. This variety is also obtainable in blocks 
of good size, and is used for buildings, columns, pilasters, balustrades, 
stairways, panels, or for furniture tops. A green variety also occurs, 
though now somewhat sparingly. The prevailing color is paler than 
the better varieties of the Mexican or American stone. A rose variety, 
said to have been especially admired by the Romans, is found in small 
blocks, scarcely larger than a paving stone. White translucent varieties 
with irregular veins of lively red or orange yellow also occur, though 
sporadically and in small masses.* 

*Iu a publication entitled "Notice Mineralogique par la Service des Mines" 
(Algeria, 1889) I find references to onyx quarries as below: In the province of 
Oran, at Ain Seboa, some 17.5 kilometers south 32° west from Nemours, an onyx of 
yellow, gray, and vermilion tint, apparently belonging to the Quaternaiy period 
and resting upon Oxfordian beds; at Sidi Brahim, 10 kilometers south 4° west of 
Nemours, a similar stone, but of poorer quality, and at Tekbalet, 26 kilometers north 
21- east from Tlemcen, a very beautiful variety of diverse hues intercalated in isolate<l 
Quaternary areas resting upon Miocene; in the province of Coustantiue, in Oued 
Zergua, some 40 kilometers southeast of Souk-Ahras, a marble approximating onyx 
occurring in veins in Ceuomanieu beds. This doubtless a stalagmitic or stalactitic 
deposit.

Altliougli not described in the published accounts, it is evident that a 
process of oxidation has gone on in certain hiyers of the Algerian stone, 
as in that of Arizona, for such material is found in the shape of turned 
columns and stands for statues and other ornaments in the art and.fur- 
nishing- shops. The colors are ([uiet ocher and mahogany brown, 
clouded and veined, and though not as translucent and highly lus- 
trous as objects of the uuoxidized stone, such are by no means lacking 
in beauty. The dealers, in their ignorance of the nature of the mate- 
rials they handle, will abuost invariably assure a customer that such 
are not of onyx, but "marble," even though as the writer has shown 
them, there may still be veins or layers of unoxidized material running 
through them. 

Ef/i/pt.—Vnhka the onyx of Algeria, that of Egypt, at least so far as 
the better known locality is concerned, is stalagmitic, that is to say, a 
cave deposit. 

According to various authorities* there are two known sources of 
stone, the first near Beui-Souef, some 25 leagues south of Cairo, and 
the other at Syout, farther to the south, but also in the Nile Valley. 
The writer is informed by Dr. Ernest Sickenberger, of Cairo, that the 
stone of the first-named locality is found in cavities and clefts in 
Eocene limestone at Gebel Oorakera ( Wady Sanoor) east of Beni-Souef, 
and in smaller amounts east of Assioot. That used in the mosque of 
Mehemet Ali, as already noted, was taken from the Gebel Oorakam 
quarries, as was also the material for the beautiful monolithic columns of 
the Church of S. Paolo fuori le Murs, at Kome. Samples of this stone 
kindlysentto Washington by Dr. Sickenberger were of a nearly white 
or only faint straw color, of a granular texture, and in no way remark- 
able for their beauty, bat such as might be duplicated by the hundreds 
of tons from the broken-down caves in the Silurio-Cambrian limestones 
of the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. Miueralogically the stone is 
calclte and carries only a trace of organic matter in the way of impuri- 
ties. According to Delesse this deposit was worked by the Egyptians 
at a very early date, and later by the Ronums. As, however, published 
accounts speak of the stone only as "Egyptian alabaster," we have in 
most cases no means of ascertaining the exact locality from whence it 
was derived. The Syout stone differs from that of Beui-Souef in hav- 
ing a micro-radiating instead of granular structure, and in being of a 
light yellowish or straw color. It is translucent and close in texture, 
and has a beautifully mellow and pleasing tint either when carved or 
polished. The date at which these latter deposits were first opened 
can not be ascertained from available literature. Delesse states, and 
after him Chateau, t that they were discovered by Selim Pacha, to

576 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

whom they were conceded by the vice roi. Boscawen,* however, 
gives us to understand that they were worked at a much earlier period 
by kings of the sixth dynasty (3703 B. C. according to Mariette; 
2744 B. C. according- to Prof. Lepsius). He describes the quarry as 
situated in tlie hills to the east of the Syout road, some 10 miles south- 
east of the plain of Tel-el Amarna, and as being about 250 feet long 
by 50 feet in width, cut into the face of the hill. It was worked, he 
says, upon a most regular system, layer after layer being cut away, 
the product being both " alabaster " and ordinary limestone. The 
detailed description of this author is as follows: 

"Starting from the quarry is a broad roadway, from 15 to 20 feet wide, crossing the 
hille into the line of the Siout road, and thence across the plain of Tel el- Amarna to 
the Nile. This roadway is a wonderful piece of eogiueeriug work. In one place a 
rapine some 40 or 50 feet is crossed, the roadway being carried across by a solid 
causeway built by bowlders so arranged on a road basis as to support very heavy 
weights. The gradients are regulated with great care. 

"This quarry does not seem to have been worked much during the later dynasties 
of the Middle Empire. The other day the Arabs brought us news of a large 
niagharah. or quarry, witli inscriptions, situated one day's journey into the desert. 
So Mr. Newberry and myself started on camels. It was a long, dreary ride across 
the plain of Tel-el-Amarna, along the Siout road, and across the hills, slightly to 
the south of Hat-Nub. Here we crossed a number of barren wadies and reached 
the slopes of a low limestone range, proljably the northern jiortiou of the Jebel- 
Kaiwlch, and after a hard climb reached the entrance to a large quarry, which was 
partially blocked with drift and rubbish. It required but a very casual inspection 
to find that we had struck a very ancient quarry, for on the lintel of the door were 
a number of inscriptions of King Teta, the founder of the sixth dynasty. The 
inscriptions on the doorway were very archaic in type, especially the rudely-drawn 
figures of a dog and a hawk and the portrait of Teta wearing a crown. The entrance 
chamber of the quarry ran due south for a distance of about 80 feet and then struck 
XI broad isle running slightly southeast for a distance of about 110 feet. All around . 
were fragments of beautiful alabaster, of a typo not used for building purposes, but 
the fine, rich, yellow, close-grained sort, often with brown veins, used for statues, 
vases, and toilet and sacrificial pots. The walls were covered in many places by rude 
votive inscriptions, usually painted panels representing a sacrificial scene, with the 
table of offerings. Some of these are grotesque almost to caricature. The face and 
limbs are the dark Egyptian red, the robe white, while the grotesque nose of the 
figure and the green palm branch seem to quite burlesque the scenes near Over the 
figure is a short hieratic inscrijition. On other walls are dated inscriptions in the 
reign of Amenemhat II, of the twelfth dyna.sty, and a fine rock-cut tablet of Usertesen 
III. The king is here represeuted seated on his throne, with his hunting dog by 
his side. 

"The c[uarry does not seem to have l»een worked after the period of the twelfth dyn- 
asty. We slept in the quarry that night, and it was indeed about as old and as weird a 
bedchamber as was ever my fortune to occupy. Bats flew over our heads and blinked 
at the lamp, and about midnight two foxes, whose home we had usurjied, came to 
the top of the neighboring hills and barked defiance. * * * The morning was 
devoted to examining the quarry, and with some interesting results. The alabaster 
vein was not very thick, but very rich in color, and the method of working seemed 
to have been to cut out blocks about 4 or 6 feet long and 3 feet in depth and width 
These were hewn out and roughly dressed with stone hammers and chisels made

from hard bowlders. * * ' The hands were protected by hide bands -wound 
around the chisel, and several strips were found in the d<5bris. That the alabaster 
from this mine was only transported in small portions is shown by the fact that 
there is no made roadway for sledge transport. 

"Another alabaster (quarry remains to be mentioned, situated to the east of the Tel- 
el-Amarna plain, behind the northern tombs. This was worked by Rameses II and 
his son Meneptah, the Phnroahs of the Oppression and the Exodus, audits steep sides 
may have echoed to the blows of the picks of the toiling Israelites.'' 

Per.s'ia.— rThe ouyx fouud in the vicinity of Lake Oroomiah lias 
already been referred to in discussing the origin of this class of rocks. 
For a description of its mode of occurrence we have to rely mainly 
upon the accounts of travelers who are neither chemists or geologists. 
The writer is informed by Mr. P. Z.^Easton that the quarries, if such 
they can be called, lie not far from the main road from Tabriz to Mara- 
gha, about 44 miles from the former place and 28 miles from the latter. 
I hnd two somewhat detailed accounts of the occurrence in the liter- 
ature at hand, and venture to give both in full, though the first more 
as a curiosity than as a contribution to scientific knowledge. This is 
by Morier * and is as follows: 

" (;)n the 24:th we proceeded to Shirameeu, a village near the lake, and distant 3 fur- 
snugs from the preceding stage. At the distance of 1 fursung on the right of the 
road is a spring of chalybeate water, and 2 fursungs farther on, after having discov- 
ered the expanse of the lake, we diverged from the road to visit the petrifactions. 

"This natural curiosity consists of certain extraordinary ponds or plashes whose 
indolent waters, by a slow and regular process, stagnate, concrete, and petrify, and 
produce that beautiful transparent stone commonly called Tabriz marble, which is 
so remarkable in most of the burial places in Persia, and which forms a chief orna- 
ment in all the buildings of note throughout the country. These ponds, which are 
situated close to one another, are contained in a circumference of about half a mile, 
and their position is marked by confused heaps and mounds of the stone, which 
have accumulated as the excavations have increased. We had seen nothing in Per- 
sia yet which was more worthy of the attention of the naturalists than this ; and I 
never so much regretted my ignorance of subjects of this nature, because I felt that 
it is of consequence they should be brought into notice by scientific observation. 
However, rather than omit all description of a spot which perhaps no Europeans 
but ourselves have had the opportunity of examining, and on which, therefore, we 
are bound (injustice to those opportunities) not to withhold the information which 
we obtained, I will venture to give the following notes of our visit, relying upon 
the candor and the science of my reader to fill up my imperfect outline. 

"On approaching the spot the ground has a hollow sound, with a jiarticularly 
dreary and calcined appearance, and when upon it a strong mineral smell arises 
from the ponds. The process of petrifaction is to be traced from its first beginning 
to its termination. In one part the water is clear, in a second it appears thicker 
and stagnant, in a third quite black, and in its last stage is white, like a hoar 
frost. Indeed, a petrified pond looks like frozen water, and before the operation is 
quite finished a stone slightly thrown upon it breaks the outer coating, and causes 
the black water underneath to exude. Where the operation is complete a stone 
makes no impression, and a man may walk upon it without wetting his shoes. 
Whenever the petrifaction has been hewn into the curious jtrogress of the concre- 
tion is clearly seen, and shows itself like. sheets of rougli paper one over the other in 
accumulated layers. Such is the constant tendency of this water to become stone

that where it exudes from the ground in bubbles the petrifaction assumes a globu- 
lar shape, as if the bul>bles of a spring, by a stroke of magic, had been arrested in 
their play, and metamorphosed into marble. These stony bubbles, which form the 
most curious specimens of this extraordinary quarry, frequently contain within them 
portions of the earth through which the water has oozed. 

''The substance thus produced is brittle, transparent, and sometimes most richly 
streaked with green, red, and copper-colored veins. It admits of being cut into 
immense slabs, and takes a good polish. We did not remark that any plant except 
rushes grew in the water. The shortest and best deiinitiou that can be given of the 
ponds is that which Quintus Curtius gives of the Lake Ascanius, '• Aqua spoute 
concrescens" (Lib., xi., c. 12). The present royal family of Persia, whose princes do 
not spend large sums in the construction of public buildings, have not carried awav 
much of the stone; but some immense slabs which were cut by Nadir Shah, and 
now lie neglected amongst innumerable fragments, show the objects which he had 
in view. So much is this stone looked upon as an article of luxury that none but 
the king, his sons, and persons privileged by special firman are i)ermitted to exca- 
vate; and such is the ascendancy of pride over avarice that the scheme of farmino- 
it to the highest bidder does not seem to have ever come within the calculations of 
its present possessors." 

The second accoimt, that of Curzoii,* is apparently the more accu- 
rate, though he also refers to the stone as a '' petrifaction,'' and is 
quite in error in stating that the springs in the Yellowstone Park have 
deposited "gleaming blocks of snow-white marble." He says: 

"Near the eastern shore of the lake (Oroomiah), and at about 6 miles from the 
village of Dehkliaregau, are the pits or springs from which is extracted the famous 
semitransparent marble, sometimes called after the neighboring town of Maragha, 
sometimes after Tabriz. A number of springs, clustered within an area of half a 
mile in circumference, are constantly bubbling up and precipitating the limestone 
which they hold in solution. This is deposited in the form of horizontal layers, 
which are like a thin crust to start with, and ran be cracked or broken, but which 
gradually solidify into hard blocks, with an average thickness of 7 or 8 inches, the 
best of which are believed to have been formed when the springs had a much hioher 
temperature than the present (65^ F.). When quarried this petrifaction can be 
sawn either in the thinnest plates, when it is nearly transparent, and is sometimes 
used for windows, or in more substantial slabs, in which form it is much used for 
pavements and mural wainscotings. It is a singularly beautiful substance, being of 
a pink or greenish or milk-white color, streaked with reddish or copper-colored veins 
(from the oxide which it contains); and I have seen l)eautiful samples of it in the 
palaces and mosques of the East. I have very little doubt that the wainscoting of 
the Gur Amir, or Tomb of Timur, at Samarkand, which I have described in my 
former work, and which has puzzled all travelers, is composed of this marble, 
which there is nothing more natural than the great couquerer should have carried 
home with him at the close of his Persian campaign. t The process of petrifaction 
bears a marked resemblance to that which was in existence till the great eruption of 
a few years ago at the i)ink and Avhite terraces in New Zealand, and to that which 
may still be seen at the Mammoth Hot Springs in the Yellowstone Park, in North 
America, where the induration may Tie observed through all its stages, from a tijm- 
like frosted sugar to gleaming blocks of snow-white marble." 

The Tabriz stone seems to have formerly been quite extensively used

1 1n footnote to above statement he says: "Since writing the above I have come 
across the statement as a matter of fact that Timur took lack with him to Samar- 
kand a large supply of the marble of Azerbaijar."'

by the wealthier classes, as already noted (p. 550), aud is still utilized to 
some extent, though mainly in the manufacture of small oruameuts. 

The Museum collections contaiu but a few small pieces of material 
from this source, and which are either pure milk white in color and 
verj" translucent (62009), or of a dull red brown color aud opaque 
(02010), the latter being" apparently au oxidation j^roduct from the 
white. The stone is interesting from a chemical standpoint, as already 
noted (p. 550). 

Other localities than those mentioned above are known. Thus Blau- 
ford* says: 

"Moimt Kuh Hazar,t lying between Bam and Karman, consists mainly if not wholly 
of volcanic rocks and ash beds. At the base of the mountain, near Rayin, there is 
much calcareous tuffa in horizontal beds, apparently deposited by springs, some of 
which are seen a short distance up the side of the mountain, forming calcareous 
deposits. Large 1)locks of massive carbonate of lime of a slightly greenish tint, 
and apparently formed in stalagmitic masses, are found in the neighborhood, and 
are used for ornamental purposes. A similar stone is said to be brought from Yezd 
and other places, aud it is generally known in Persia as Yezd marble. It closely 
resembles the Egyptian stone known as oriental alabaster, except that the color is 
greenish white instead of yellow." 

This is doubtless the stone described by Curzon as — 

''An excellent yellow, semitransparent marble, quarried in the mountains near Yezd, 
the actual spot being Turuu Pusht, 40 miles from Taft and 56 miles from Yezd. As 
already noted, it is from the Yezd stone, according to Curzon, that was constructed 
the tomb of the poet Hatiz. From this stone, too, according to the same authority, 
were constructed the superb marble throne and the twisted marble pillars that now 
adorn the throne room or talar in the royal palace at Teheran. " 

Still another locality for this stone or one answering well its descrip- 
tion is near the village of Tauris,in Susiane. Chardin| describes it as — 

'•transparent presque comme le cristal de roche, et on voit a travers de tables qui 
ont un pouce d' epassier et meme plus. Ce marbre est blanc, mele de verd, pale 
comme une maniere de jadde. II est si tendre que le couteau 1' entame: ce qui fait 
peuser a plusiers que ce n'est pas uu vrai mineral, ni qui ait la consistance d' une 
vraie j)ierre. " 

Italy. — The writer is informed by Chevalier Jervis that very many 
localities exist in difterent parts of Italy where natural caverns in lime- 
stones of varying geological age are to be met with, and which are cap- 
able of affording nuich tine marble for decorative purposes. A very 
complete list of these is given in Mr. Jervis's treatise on the economic 
geology of Italy,§ aud we will here mention only the more important 
and widely known. Singularly enough the ancient Romans, with all 
their love for lavish display in articles beautiful and rare, seem to have

worked but little these deposits, but to have preferred briugiug their 
materials from more distant sources. A rich houey-yellow marble of 
this class occurs in caverns in Archeau limestone at Busca, Cuneo 
province, and may be seen worked up in the royal palace at Turin, 
and in some of the private houses. It is stated to be very beautiful. A 
banded dark yellow and white variety, forming- a handsome ornamental 
stone, is found at Indiano Olona, in the province of Como. The stone 
occurs in caves in Mesozoic limestone not far from the Swiss frontier. 
At Albino, in the Val Setiaua, province of Bergamo, stones of this 
class may be quarried in slabs of considerable superficial area but 
limited thickness. It is used for making mantels and other articles of 
ornament as well as for inlaid work. There are two localities of the 
stone in the province of Brescia which may be mentioDed. One at 
Pisogne. on the eastern side of the lake of Iseo, where a yellow-brown 
material is obtained from stalactites iuTriassic limestone, and the other 
at Eezzato, a few miles to the east of Brescia. The stone here is dark 
brown, and occurs in caverns in the Liassian limestone. 

In the Appenuine range a large number of localities may be specified 
where stalactitic and stalagmitic marbles of great variety and beauty 
are to be found. Special mention must be made of the stone known as 
alahastro del Gazzo, from the fact of its coming from Monte Gazzo, at 
San Giovanni Battista, province of Genoa, overlooking the Mediter- 
ranean Sea. The cave is in a Triassic limestone. The stone is described 
by Chevalier Jervis as a beautiful and gorgeous material, and as hav- 
ing been largely used in former centuries for internal decoration in the 
churches of Genoa. A great number of stalactites from the same part 
of Ligaria were employed with wonderfully artistic effect in making 
the artificial cave in the celebrated gardens of the Marquis Pallaricini, 
at Pegli, near Genoa. In the province of Siena there is a cavern in 
Liassian limestone whence large masses of cave marl>le have been pro- 
cured for decorative purposes, while at Castelnuova dell' Abbate, in 
the commune of Monte Alcino, considerable quantities are found under- 
lying a Qnateuary travertine. Stones of this same class are found 
also at Terracina, province of Rome, and at Gesualdo (principato 
Utteriore), near the central chain of the southern Appeniiines. This 
last locahty furnished the architect Vauvitelli 32 monolithic shafts or 
columns for the royal palace at Caserta. The same stone, togetlier 
with other marbles, was used by the King of Naples for the internal 
decoration of the royal palace at Portici, now the higher school of 
agriculture. 

Miscellaneous localities. — According toD'Orbigny and Geute,* France 
has an abundance of beautiful "calcareous alabasters*' in grottoes and 
caves, but the material is less esteemed than that of Italy, whence the 
commercial supply was largely obtained. 

They also state that a veined, undulated "alabaster" of a beautiful

THE ONYX MARBLES. 581 

wax yellow color is found in caverns at Malaga, in Spain. When cut 
across the bedding it shows veins of two very i)leasing tints, but 
when cut parallel it shows only large, confused, cloudy areas (taohes 
embroueUies), and is not nearly as beautiful. The Palais at Madrid is 
decorated with this stone. C. P. Brard, in his Mineralogic Appliquee 
aux Arts, 1821 (p. 396), describes the onyx marbles as cave deposits, 
and seems never to have heard of their occurrence as hot-spring 
deposits. Under this head he describes, very brieliy, clouded white, 
limpid to opaque varieties, sometimes of a beautiful green tint, from 
Arcena, in Andalusia, Spain. The translucent varieties were the 
soundest and most esteemed by the ancients (whoever they may have 
been). He also speaks (p. 402) of a honey yellow, almost transparent 
variety from the isle of Malta, and which was used in making statues 
of large size. Other varieties are also found on this island, one of a 
clear yellow color, veined with white, or white variegated with black, 
or brown and white. This same authority further states that a brown 
"alabaster" with clearer veins, and which receives a beautiful polish, 
is found in the territory of Saguna, in Sicily, and near Montreal and 
Caputa other varieties, with lively red and yellowish veins or clear 
yellow and white. A white variety with yellow and red veins is found 
at Mount Pellegrino and a yellowish one at Bactia, in Corsica. 
Unfortunately, this author's descriptions are meager, and the use of the 
name alabaster, as already noted, is so misleading that we can not in all 
cases discriminate, and it is possible some of the stones here mentioned 
may be true alabaster (gypsum). 

Pliny* writes of a white alabaster, which is i)resumably a true car- 
bonate, as occurring at Damascus, in Syria. He compares it with that 
found near Thebes (Syout?) , in Egypt, but of a white color. The most 
next esteemed variety, he states, is that of Carmania (Carmoua, in 
Spain?), and the least that of Cappadocia, in Asia Minor. Next to 
that of Carmania he considers a product of a locality, not mentioned, 
in India, as of greatest value, and places that of Syria as third in the 
list.

THE COWBIRDS. 



By Maj. Charles Bendire, 
Honorarii Curator of the Oological Collections, U. S. National Museum. 



Among our American birds comparatively few present such an inter- 
esting tield for systematic investigation and study of their habits and 
mode of reproduction as the Cowbirds or Cow Buntings. 

The family to which they belong, the Icteridce, containing such familiar 
birds as the Bobolink, the Oriole, Blackbirds, etc., is confined to the 
American continent, and the genus Molothrus (with its subgenus Cal- 
lothrus) is represented by 12 species and subspecies. Of these, three are 
found in the United States, namely: Molothrus ater, Molothrus ater 
obscurus, and Callothrus robustus; and a fourth, CaUothrus (erieus, is a 
resident of western Mexico and portions of Central America. The 
remaining species are confined to South America. Callothrus armenti 
is found on the coast of Colombia and Venezuela ; Molothrus atroniteus 
in Guiana, Venezuela, and Trinidad; M. purpurascms in western Peru; 
M. cassini in Venezuela and Colombia; M. frimjillarius in Brazil; M. 
honariensis in Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Brazil; 31. rufoaxil- 
laris in Argentina and Uruguay, and .1/. biidius in Argentina, Para- 
guay, and Bolivia. 

Respecting the general habits of some of the species, comparatively 
little is as yet known excepting those found in the United States (but 
even here a great deal remains to be learned) and the three last, which 
have been pretty fully described m Sclater and Hudson's excellent 
work on Argentine ornithology. 

It is probable that nearly all these species are parasitic to a greater 
or less degree, laying their eggs in the nests of other birds and letting 
them perform the duties of incubation and rearing the young, with the 
exception of Molothrus badius, the Baywinged Cowbird, which occa- 
sionally builds a nest of its own or appropriates nests of other species, 
but incubates its own eggs or cares for its young like other respectable 
members of the Avian family. 

This same parasitic instinct is also found among members of the 
more cosmopolitan family of the Cuckoos, notably with Gueulus cano- 
rus, the European Cuckoo, about which a great deal of interesting lit- 
erature has already been published, and the same traits, only in a much 
more modified degree, are also said to be occasionally observed in at 
least one of our North American species, the Blackbilled Cuckoo, Coc- 
cijzus erythrophthalmus^hnt no such instance has as yet come under my 
own observation, and I consider it of rare occurrence.

590 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

On tlie whole, our Cowbirds present a far wider and more interesting 
field for careful observation and studj* than does the European Cuckoo, 
as their habits differ greatly in many respects; for instance, they are 
among the few, if they are not the only birds, which practice polyan- 
dry, which is probably caused for the reason that the males generally 
outnumber the females about 3 to 1. 

In order to give the reader some idea of these disreputable but never- 
theless interesting birds, my articles written for Life Histories of North 
American Birds, Part ii, are printed from advance sheets without alter- 
ation, excepting the addition of a concise description of each species, 
taken from Mr. 11. Kidgway's Manual of North American Birds. 

Fgures of an adult male and female Cowbird, Molothrus ater, are 
here given (pis. 2 and 3) as well as a nest of the Yellow Warbler, Ben- 
(Jroica aestiva, (pi. 1) containing three eggs of its own and one of this 
parasite. 

The articles on the Cowbirds found in the Argentine Eepublic are 
copied from Messrs. P. L. Sclater and W. H. Hudson's work on Argen- 
tine ornithology, the notes on their habits being based on observations 
made by the latter gentleman. The two series of articles combined 
will enable the reader to arrive at a better understanding of the gen- 
eral habits of some of the members of this interesting genus.

THE COWBIRDS. 



591 



Cow Blackbird, Shinyeye, Blackbird, Lazy Bird, Clodhopper, aud in 
former years on the plains as Buft'alo Bird, extends from our southern 
States, excepting Florida, southern and western Texas, north into the 
southern parts of the Dominion of Canada, as already indicated. West- 
ward its breeding range extends to eastern British Columbia, eastern 
Washington, eastern Oregon, Nevada, and probably southeastern Cah- 
fornia, where Dr. A. K. Fisher shot an adult male at Furnace Creek, in 
Death Valley, June 20, 1891. East of the Rocky Mountains the Cow- 
bird is pretty generally distributed over the greater part of its range, 
excepting the extensive forest regions and some of the more southern 
States, where it appears to occur only sparingly. Its center of abund- 
ance is found in the States bordering the Upper Mississippi Siver 
and its numerous tributaries. West of the one hundred and thirteenth 
meridian (Greenwich), in the United States at least, it must be con- 
sidered as a rare summer visitor, and as far as 1 have been able to 
ascertain it has not yet been found anywhere on the Pacihc Coast, west 
of the Cascade aud the Sierra Nevada mountains, except as a straggler. 
In the southern portions of the provinces of Alberta and Assmiboia, 
Dominion of Canada, as far west as Calgary, 1 found this species 
remarkablv abundant in the latter part of May, 1894, along the line of 
the Canadian PaciHc Railway, small parties from to 12 being almost 
constantly in sight, evidently on their way to their breeding grounds. 
The most northern point where its eggs have been taken appears to 
be in the vicinity of Little Slave Lake, in southern Athabasca, in latitude 
550 30' north. Mr. S. Jones, of the Hudson Bay Company, forwarded 
specimens from.there to the Smithsonian Institution in 1868, but it is 
quite probable that this species ranges farther north. 

Although I have traveled extensively over our westernmost States 
and Territories I noticed the Cowbird on but very few occasions, aud 
only found its eggs there twice ; once on June 21, 1871, near Fort Lapwai, 
Idaho, in the nest of the Long-tailed Chat, Icteria vire7is longicmida, 
and again near Palouse Falls, in southeastern Washington, on June 18, 
1878, in a nest of the Slate-colored Sparrow, Passerella iliaca scMstacea, 
aud which I believe is the most western breeding record known. 

Both of these specimens are now in the United States National 
Museum collection. 

The most southern breeding records I have knowledge of, are from 
Wayne andMcIntosh counties, Ga., Petite Anse Island, Louisiana, and 
Harris County, Tex. It does not appear to breed anywhere in the imme- 
diate vicinity of the gulf coast in Texas, where it is replaced by its smaller 
relative, the Dwarf Cowbird. While the majority of these birds pass 
beyond our borders in the late fall and winter, mainly to southern Mex- 
ico, still a good many remain in our Southern States, and a few even 
winter occasionally as far north as New England, .Alichigan, etc. 

Dr. G. Brown Goode tells me that while on the German Lloyd steamer 



592 REPORT OF XATK^XAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

NecTcar, in April, 1880, a Cowbiid tlew ou board, fully 1,000 miles east 
of Newfoundland, and was captured. 

The Cowbird ordinarily arrives in good-sized flocks in the middle 
States from its winter home in the south, during the last half of March ; 
in the more northern States, rarely before the first week in April, more 
frequently after the middle of this month, the males predominating in 
numbers over the more plainly colored females, and generally preceding 
them several days. Soon after, these flocks commence to break up and 
scatter in small companies of from G to 12 individuals and disperse gen- 
erally over the country. It prefers more or less cultivated districts, 
river valleys, etc., where other birds are abundant, and rarely penetrates 
far into heavily timbered sections in mountainous regions, excepting in 
Colorado, where it has been met with at altitudes up to 8,000 feet. 

The food of the Cowbird consists principally of vegetable matter, 
such as seeds of different kinds of noxious weeds, like ragweed, smart- 
weed, foxtail or pigeon grass, wild rice and the smaller species of 
grains, berries of diflerent kinds, as well as of grasshoppers, beetles, 
ticks, flies, and other insects, worms, etc., and in this respect it does 
perhaps more good than harm. 

While the Cowbird is fairly common in most of the States east of 
the Mississippi River, it is far more noticeable in the regions west of 
this stream, although perhaps not much more abundant. In the prairie 
States this is especially the case, and one will rarely see a bunch of 
cattle there without an attending flock of Cowbirds, who perch on their 
backs searching for parasites, or follow them along on the ground hunt- 
ing for suitable food among their droppings. They generally act in 
concert; when one settles on the ground the others follow shortly 
afterwards, and let one start to fly the remainder take wing also. Their 
flight resembles that of the Red-winged Blackbird. When the nesting 
season approaches the males become very demonstrative in their actions 
toward the females, but do not appear to mind the attentions paid by 
other males to the same female, as other birds usually do, and rarely 
fight for her possession. Free lovers as they are, they do not object 
to such trifles. 

At this time of the year several males nuiy frequently be seen, while 
perched on some fence rail, or the limb of a tree, with the feathers of 
their throats raised, tails spread, and wings trailing, each endeavoring 
to pour out his choicest song to one of his protective mates, which con- 
sists of various unreproducable guttural sounds uttered while all the 
feathers are pufl'ed out, the head lowered, and evidently produced only 
by considerable ettbrt on the part of the performer. One of their call 
notes sounds somewhat like "' spreele," others resemble the various 
squeaks of the Red-winged Blackbird, and all are difficult to repro- 
duce on paper. 

It IS a well-known fact that the Cowbird is a parasite, building no 
nest, but inflicting its eggs usually ou smaller birds, leaving to them 



THE COWBIRDS. 593 

the labor and care of rearing- its young. It appears to be entirely 
devoid of conjugal aftection, and practices polyandry, tbe small flocks 
in which it is found during the season of reproduction generally con- 
taining several more males than females. 

It is at all times more or less gregarious, especially so in fall and 
winter, when it often forms large Hocks, and associates then Avith the 
other blackbirds, like Brewer's and the Red-winged. 

The laying season rarely begins before May 15, and continues for 
about two mouths. During this time probably from 8 to 12 eggs are 
laid by each female, or the equivalent of two broods, and I believe that 
several days elapse between the laying of each egg. It is not likely, 
and this is very fortunate indeed, that more than half of these eggs 
are hatched, as some are occasionally dropped in old and abandoned 
nests, or, when the female is hard pressed, even on the ground; others 
in just completed nests in Avhich the rightful owner had not yet laid, 
and. seeing the parasitic egg in its nest, either abandons it entirely or 
constructs another over the first, burying the stranger egg among the 
building material. 

When the Cowbird is ready to lay she quietly leaves her associates 
and begins her search for a suitable nest, usually selecting one of a 
species smaller than herself, but if such a one is not readily found a 
nest of a larger bird will answer equally well, especially if the full 
complement of eggs has not been deposited in it. She does not forcibly 
drive the owner from her nest, but watches her opportunity to drop her 
egg in it when it is unguarded. In rare instances only will a fresh 
Cow bird's egg be found among incubated ones of the rightful owner. 
I have only observed this on a single occasion. From 1 to 7 of these 
parasitic eggs have been found in a nest, the larger numbers usually in 
those of ground-building species, especially in that of the Ovenbird, 
where from 3 to 5 eggs, with perhaps 2 or 3 of the owner, are not 
especially uncommon. I know of one instance where not less than 7 
Cowbirds' eggs were found in a nest of this species with a single one of 
its own. Kot unfrequently 2 or more eggs, in all probability laid by 
the same bird, will be found in one nest. There is so much variation in 
their eggs, both in size and markings, that the close resemblance of 
any 2 eggs at once attracts attention. It is not unusual to find some 
of the eggs of the species imposed on thrown out of the nest to make 
room for those of the parasite, nor to find minute punctures in the 
shells of some of the remaining eggs. This is possibly done on purpose 
by the Cowbird with her beak, to keep the eggs from hatching, or with 
her sharp claws while sitting on the nest and depositing her own egg. 
I am inclined to attribute this puncturing to the latter cause, but there 
is no doubt that the Cowbird sometimes throws the rightful owner's 
eggs out of the nest purposely to enhance the chances of its offspring 
coining to maturity. I have yet to see a punctured Cowbird's egg. It 
is astonishing how many different species are thus imposed upon by the

Cowbird. One would naturally suppose that birds breeding in holes 
in trees or under rocks would be exempt from this infliction, but this 
is not the case. Perhaps among the strangest and most unlikely of 
foster parents selected are the Red-headed Woodpecker and the Eock 
Wren. 

]Mr. Williani G. Smith, formerly of Loveland, Colo., writes me that he 
found a Cowbird's egg in a Kock Wren's nest which was placed under 
a ledge of rock fully 2 feet from the entrance, and which was barely 
large enough for the wren to squeeze through. It seems almost in)pos- 
sible that a bird of this size would be able to enter the small pendent 
nest of the Parula Warbler and deposit its egg therein in the usual 
way; still this species is occasionally imposed on, and it is possible 
that the egg is dropped in the nest with the beak. The following is a 
list of species in whose nests eggs of the Cowbird have been found, 
and undoubtedly a number of others yet remain to be added to it:

Among these the nests of the Phoebe, Soug Sparrow, To whee, Indigo 
Bnnting, Ovenbird, and Yellow-breasted Chat seem to be most 
frequently selected, and these usually contain also more of the para- 
sitic eggs than the majority of the others. 

The egg of the Cowbird usually hatches in from ten to eleven days, 
generally^'in advance of those of the foster parent, and the growth of 
the young interloper is rapid. Mr. M. A. White, of Mathews, Va., 
writes on this subject as follows, and his observations correspond fairly 
well with my own : 

It was on the 9th of June, 1891, that I placed a fresh egg of the Cowbird in the nest 
of a Chipping Sparrow containing two of her own that had an advance of one and 
a half days' incubation over the first. I watched results. About the 19th, Mr. Cow- 
bird emerged from his prison walls, large and vigorous. A day later a little sparrow 
came forth from his delicate shell, but much smaller, and exhibiting less strength 
than his fosterbrother. The other egg failed to hatch. 

The daily increase in dimension of the Cowbird was something immense, while 
that of hisVounger companion seemed rather to diminish than enlarge, until finally, 
at the end of three days, he died-evidently for want of food, as the Cowbird, being 
laro-er greedily devoured everything that came in contact with his capacious mouth. 
The untimely end of the rightful heir was but gain to this usurper, as he now 
received the whole attention of the parent birds. Nature having now, at the early 
ao-e of seven days, provided him with a respectable dress, he was no longer con- 
tented to remain within the small compass which the nest furnished, whereupon he 
betook himself to the branches of the tree in which the nest had been placed. But 
soon this area became too limited for his ambitious spirit, for at the end of his 
second week he was flitting from bush to bush, exploring the fields anfl hedges, his

fled«'ed bird. About July 20 I saw him for the last time.*

596 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Such seems to be tbe fate of nearly all the young whicli have tlie 
misfortune to be liatclied with a Cowbird for a companion. I have yet 
to see a nest containing young birds of both species more than a few 
days old; by that time the rightful offspring are either smothered or 
crowded out of the nest by their stronger foster brother, or starved, 
and he then absorbs the entire attention of the parents. Only in such 
cases where these are as large or larger than the imposter is there any 
likelihood to be an occasional exception to this rule. It can readily be 
seen what an immense amount of harm a Cowbird causes in the econ- 
omy of nature, granting that only a single one of its eggs is hatched 
in a season; to accomplish this a brood of insectivorous and useful 
birds is almost invariably sacrificed for every Cowbird raised, and they 
are certaiidy not dinnnishing in numbers. 

While a few of the selected foster parents resent the addition of a 
parasitic egg in their nest, either by abandoning it entirely or by build- 
ing a new one over it, and occasionally even a third one, the majority 
do not appear to be much disturbed by such an event, and after a short 
time go on as if nothing had happened. A few species, like the Indigo 
Bunting, for instance, will sometimes abandon their own eggs should 
the stranger egg be removed, but apparently do not mind the loss of 
one or two of their own, and continue incubating just the same. 

Almost invariably the nests in which one or more of these parasitic 
eggs have been deposited contain only incomplete sets of their right- 
ful owners. Where the Cowbird drops an egg in the nests of species 
considerably smaller than itself, as the Gnat-catcher, etc., its much 
larger size .seems to be a positive advantage to the more rapid develop- 
ment of the embryo, as the egg must necessarily receive more animal 
heat than the smaller ones, which can scarcely come much in contact 
with the body of the sitting bird, and the development of the embryos 
in these nuist be more or less retarded thereby. 

It is ludicrous to see a fat, fully fledged young Cowbird following a 
pair of Chipping Sparrows, or some small Warbler clamoring inces- 
santly for food and uttering its begging call of seerr-seerr most i^ersis- 
tently, only keeping quiet while its gaping beak is filled with some 
suitable morsel, and stranger still to note how devoted the diminutive 
nurses are to their foster child. One would think that they might see 
through the fraud, at least after the young interloper left the nest, if 
not before, and abandon him to his fate, but the greatest attachment 
seems to exist between them until the Cowbird is able to shift for him- 
self, when he leaves and joins his own kiud. 

It has been asserted that, in the W^est, Cowbirds occasionally build 
nests and rear their own young, but this is undoubtedly incorrect, and 
on proper investigation it will be found that the supposed CoM'l)ird is 
really Brewer's Blackbird. 

When the laying season is over they collect again in larger flocks 
and frequeut the marshes in company with the Blackbirds, where they

find an abundauce of food at that time of tlie year, and tlie return 
migration to their winter liomes begins usually in the latter half of 

October. 

The eggshell of the Cowbird is compact, granulated, moderately 
glossy, and relatively much stronger than in the eggs of its near 
allies the Icteridce. The ground color varies from an almost pure 
white to grayisli white, and less often to pale bluish or milky white, 
and this is usually profusely covered over its entire surface with specks 
and blotches varying in color from chocolate to claret brown, tawny 
and cinnamon-rufous. In an occasional specimen the markings are 
confluent and the ground color is almost entirely hidden by them; in 
the majority, however, it is distinctly visible. These markings are 
usually heaviest about the larger end of the egg, and in rare .nstances 
they form an irregular wreath. The eggs vary greatly in shape, 
ranging from ovate to short, rounded, and elongate-ovate, the first 

predominating. o xr +• 

The average measurement of 127 specimens in the U. S. :Nationai 
Museum collection is 21.45 by 16.42 millimeters, or 0.84 by 0.65 inch; 
the largest egg measures 25.40 by 16.76 millimeters, or 1 by 0.06 inch; 
the smallest 18.03 by 15.49 millimeters, or 0.71 by 0.61 inch.

The breeding range of the Dwarf Cowbird in the United States is 
coincident with its geographical distribution. It can only be considered 
as a summer resident, although a few appear to winter in southern 
Arizona, as I shot an adult male on Rillito Creek, near Tucson, on 
January 24, 1873. It usually arrives from its winter home in southern 
Mexico about the middle of March, and is then found associating with 
different species of Blackbirds, especially Brewer's Blackbird, and fre- 
quenting the vicinity of cattle ranches, roads, and cultivated fields. 
By April 15 the flocks have scattered, and small parties of from 5 to 12 
may now be seen in suitable localities, such as the shrubbery along 
water courses, springs, etc., where other small birds are abundant. 
The character of its food and its general habits as well, are similar to 
those of the common Cowbird, which it closely resembles, being only a 
trifle smaller. In middle Texas the two races intergrade to some extent, 
and It is claimed both breed there. In the lower Kio Grande valley, 



598 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Texas, the typical Dwarf Cowbird is common, and I found it equally so 
in tlie vicinity of Tucson, Ariz., where I have taken quite a number of 
its eggs. 

Mr. F. Stephens writes me that it is a common summer resident as 
far west as tbe Colorado River, beyond the immediate vicinity of which 
he lias never seen it. Mr. L. Belding found it common in the streets 
of San Jose del Carbo, Lower California, associating with Brewer's 
Blackbirds during April, but rarely saw it later. It is questionable if 
it breeds there. 

Like its eastern relative, the Dwarf Cowbird drops its eggs in the 
nests of other birds, principally in those of species which are smaller 
than itself. The following is a list of those in which they have thus 
far been found: 

Coniopus rkhardsoiii, Western Wood i Canlinalis cardinalis canicaiidus, Gray-

P.olioptila plumbea, Plumbeous Gnat- 
catcher.

Doubtless a number of others still remain to be added. 

According to my observations the Least Vireo seems to be oftener 
imposed upon, in southern Arizona at least, than any other bird; the 
Desert Song Sparrow, Black-tliioated Sparrow, and Vermiliou Fly- 
catcher following in the order named. 

The earliest date known by me on which an egg of this subspecies 
was found is April 18, the latest August 2, showing that the laying 
season lasts considerably longer than with Molothrus ater, and it 
appears to be at its height during the month of June. 

I found it almost impossible to obtain a full set of the Least Vireo's 
eggs; nearly every nest found contained I or 2 eggs of this parasite, and 
usually only 1 or 2 of its own, and the latter were frequently punctured. 
In fact, this was so often the case that I am inclined to believe that it is 
done purposely and not by accident; but whether made by the beak 
or claws of the bird I will not venture to say, but believe it is done 
with the latter. In many nests I found 1 or 2 of the owner's eggs thrown

out and broken, and occasionally every one, the foster parent sitting 
on the parasite's eggs alone. Among other instances I found this to be 
the case in a nest of the Plumbeous Gnatcatcher placed in a thick 
mistletoe bunch growing from a limb of a mesquite tree about 15 feet 
from the ground, and well hidden. I first observed the nest on June 
10, 1872, when it contained a single egg; on visiting it again on the 
17th, the female was sitting on a couple of Dwarf Oowbird'S eggs alone, 
and on looking on the ground I found the remnants of 3 eggs, which 
evidently had been thrown out. Bullock's Oriole may occasionally rid 
herself of the parasitic egg; at any rate I noticed the remains of such 
a one lying under a nest of this species with portions of one of her 
own. This nest contained only 3 eggs of the rightful owner, and the 
bird was sitting on these. The largest number of Dwarf Cowbird's 
eggs found by me in one nest was 3, that of a Desert Song Sparrow, 
and all its own eggs were missing. I several times found nests con- 
taining single eggs of this parasite abandoned, and also picked up 2 
uninjured from the ground where they evidently had been dropped by 
the bird, not finding a suitable nest in time to deposit them. None of 
the young of the foster parents seem to survive the advent of a young 
Cowbird in their nest longer than two or three days; they are starved 
by that time by their more vigorous and voracious foster brother. After 
the young Dwarf Cowbird is old enough to care for itself it abandons its 
foster parents and seeks the company of its own kind, gathering in small 
bands and roving from place to place. Later in the season, about the 
latter part of October, these gather into larger fiocks, associate at this 
time with other congenial species, and shortly after return to their 
winter homes in Mexico. 

In general appearance and shape the eggs of the Dwarf Cowbird 
resemble those of the former, and the same description will answer for 
both, but they appear on an average to be somewhat less heavily 
spotted, which gives them a lighter appearance; and they are also 
considerably smaller. 

The average measurement of 37 specimens in the F. S. National 
Museum collection is 19.30 by 14.99 millimeters, or 0.76 by 0.59 inch; 
the largest egg in this series measures 20.57 by 15.19 millimeters, or 
0.81 by 0.61 inch; the smallest 18.03 by 13.74 millimeters, or 0.71 by 
0.54 inch.

Geographical range. — Mexico and Central America, north to southern 
Texas, south to Panama. 

The breeding range of the Red-eyed or Bronzed Cowbird, a larger 
and darker colored species than the two preceding, coincides with its 
geographical distribution in the United States, and extends, as far as 
known, north and eastward only to Bexar County, Tex., where Mr. H. 
P. Attwater reports it as a rare summer resident near San Antonio, 
and found one of its eggs in the nest of a Bullock's Oriole in that 
vicinity. 

We are indebted to Dr. James C. Merrill, U. S. Army, for the addi- 
tion of this interesting species to our fauna, who first recorded it in the 
Bulletin of the iSTuttall Ornithological Club, Vol. i, 1876, p. 88, as an 
abundant summer resident in the vicinity of Fort Brown, Tex. A full 
account of the breeding habits of this species by Dr. Merrill may be 
found in the above-mentioned bulletin, Vol. ii, 1877, pp. 85-87, from 
which I extract the most interesting notes : 

My first specimeus were taken at Hidalgo, oa the Rio Grande, 70 miles northwest 
of Fort Brown, where, however, they are not so abundant as lower down the river. 
Here they are common throughout the year, a small proportion going south in winter 
Those that remain gather in large flocks with the Long-tailed Grackles, common 
Cowbirds, and Brewers, Red-winged, and Yellow-headed Blackbirds; they become 
very tame, and the abundance of food about the picket lines attracts them for miles 
around. C. rohustus is readily distinguishable in these mixed gatherings from the 
other species by its blood-red iris and its peculiar top-heavy appearance, caused by 
its habit of puffing out the feathers of the head and neck. 

This habit is most marked during the breeding season and in the male, but is seen 
throughout the year. 

About the middle of April the common Cowbird, Brewer's, and Yellow-headed 
Blackbirds leave for the north ; the Long-tailed Grackles have formed their colonies 
in favorite clumps of mesquite trees; the Redwings that remain to breed have 
selected sites for their nests; the Dwarf Cowbirds, MoJoihvns pecorls ohscurus, arrive 
from the south, and CaVothnis robustiis gather in flocks by themselves and wait for 
their victims to build. The males have now a variety of notes, somewhat resembling 
those of the common Cowbird Molothrus pecoris, but more harsh. During the day 
they scatter over the surrounding country in little companies of one or two females 
and half a dozen males, returning at nightfall to the A'iclnity of the picket lines. 
While the females are feeding or resting in the shade of a bush the males are eagerly 
paying their addresses by puffing out their feathers, as above noted, strutting up and 
down, and nodding and bowing in a very odd manner. Every now and then one of 
the males rises in the air, and poising himself 2 or 3 feet above the female, flutters 
for a minute or two, following her if she moves away, and then descends to resume 
his puffing and bowing. This habit of fluttering in the air was what first attracted 
my attention to the species. In other respects their habits seem to be like those of 
the eastern Cowbird (J/, pecoris). 

My first egg of C. rohustus was taken on May 14, 1876, in a Cardinal's nest. A few 
days before this a soldier brought me a similar egg, saying he found it in a Scissors- 
tail's {Milvulus) nest. Not recognizing it at the time, I paid little attention to him,

aud did not keep the egg. I soon found several others and have t-^^«" "^ ^ _;' 
specimens the past season. All but 2 of these were found in nests of the Bu lock s 
Hooded, and Orchard Orioles. It is a curious fact that although fellow-breasted 
Chats and Redwinged Blackbirds breed abundantly in places most frequented by 
these Cowbirds, I htn-e but once found the latter's egg in a Chat's nest and never in 
a Eedwing's, though I have looked in very many of them. P^^lj;'!- *^«J; f^.^^^f^ 
the line should bJ drawn somewhere, and select their cous.ns, the Blackbxrds, as 
coming within it. The Dwarf Cowbirds are not troubled by this scruple, however 
Several of these parasitic eggs were found under interesting conditions. On s x 
occasions I have found an egg of both Cowbirds in the same nest. ^ ^our of these 
there were eggs of the rightful owner/ who was sitting. In the other two the Cow- 
birdl eggs were alone in the nests, which were deserted. But I have known the 
Hooded Oriole to set on an egg of C. robastus, which was on the point of hatching 
when found. How its own disappeared I can not say. Once 2 eggs of C. rohnstus were- 
found in a nest of the small Orchard Oriole (var. affims). Twice I have seen a broken 
ec. of C. robustus under nests of Bullock's Oriole on which the owner was sitting, 
larly in June a nest of the Hooded Oriole was found, with 4 eggs, and one of C. 
robuJs all of which I removed, leaving the nest. Happening to pass b y i a few 
days la er, I looked in, and to my surprise found 2 eggs of ,-o^««.,. which were 
broken. These were so unlike that they were probably laid by difterent bird . btill 
another egg, and the last, was laid in the same nest within ten days. But the most 
;Tmarkab!e instance was a nest of the snuUl Orchard Oriole, found June 20, con- 
taining 3 eo-gs of C. robustus, while just beneath it was a whole egg of this parasite , 
also a broken one of this and of the Dwarf Cowbird M. obscurus Two o the eggs 
iu the nest were rotten. Tlie third, strange to say, contained a living embryo As 
the nest was certainly deserted, I can only account for tliis by supposing that th. . 
rotten ones were laid about the first week of June, when there was considerable ram, 
.ud that the other was deposited soon after, since which time the weather had been 
clear and very hot. On one occasion I found a female C. robustus hanging with a 
out thread around its neck to a nest of the Bullock's Oriole. The nest contained one 
younc. of this Cowbird, and it is probable that its parent alter depositing the egg 
was e^ntangled in the thread on hurriedly leaving the nest, and there died It had 
rppaxentlv been dead about two weeks. This case supports the view hat the eggs 
or youncr of the owner are thrown out by the young parasite and not removed by 
its parent, though I could find no trace of them beneath the nest. 

Among tbe species imposed on by tlie Bronzed Cowbird are the 
following: 

Mih-ulus forficatus, Scissors-tailed Fly 

catcher. 
Icterus auduboni, Audubon's Oriole. 
Icterus cucuUaius, Hooded Oriole. 
Icterus spurius, Orchard Oriole. 
Icterus buUocki, Bullock's Oriole. 

Otber species undoubtedly will have to be added to tbis list. 

Tbe Orioles appear to be tbe especial victims of tbe Bronzed Cow- 
bird, and among tbe.se Andubon's seem to be tbe worst sufterer In 
nine sets of tbis species in tbe U. S. National Mnsenm collection tbere 
are only two wbicb contain tbe normal number of eggs, 4. ibe other 
seven all contain from 1 to 3 of tbese parasitic eggs, witb 1 or 2 ot 

*It would be interesting to know what would have become of the three species in 
one nest, and had the latter been near the fort where I could have visited them 
daily I should not have taken the eggs. It is probable, howe^•er that C. robusus 
wol have disposed of the young Dwarf Cowbird as easily as of the young Orioles.

their own, and some of these are usually punctured. In none of these 
nests were eggs of the Dwarf Cowbird found in addition to those of the 
GallothruH robustus. The former appears to confine itself to the smaller 
Orioles only. 

The eggs of the Bronzed Cowbird are rather glossy ; the shell is finely 
granulated and strong. Their shape varies from ovate to short and 
rounded ovate. They are pale bluish green in color and unspotted, 
resembling the eggs of the Black-throated Sparrow and Blue Grosbeak 
in this respect, but are much larger.

the Tordo Gomun of Azara, and is usually called '■^ Tordo^^ or '■'•Pajuro 
Kegro'''' by the Spanish, and ^'- Blacl-bird''^ by the English-speaking- 
Argentines. A more suitable name, I think, is the Argentine Cowbird, 
which has been given to it by some writers on ornithology, Cowbird 
being the name of the closely allied North American species, Molothrus 
pecoris. 

This Cowbird is widely distributed in South America, and is common 
throughout the Argentine country, including Patagonia, as far south 
as Chupat. In Buenos Ayres it is very numerous, especially in culti- 
vated districts where there are i)lantations of trees. The male is 
clothed in a glossy plumage of deep violaceous purple, the wings and 
tail being dark metallic green; but seen at a distance or in the shade 
the bird looks black. The female is inferior in size and has a dull, 
mouse-colored i)luniage and black beak and legs. The males are much 
more numerous than the females. Azara says that nine birds in ten are 
males, but I am not sure that the disparity is so great as that. It 
seems strange and contrary to nature's usual rule that the smaller, 
shyer, inconspicuous individuals should be in such a minority; but the 
reason is perhaps that the male eggs of the Cowbird are harder shelled 
than the female eggs, and escape destruction oftener when the i)arent 
bird exercises its disorderlj^ and destructive habit of pecking holes in 
all the eggs it finds in the nests into which it intrudes. 



THE COWBIRDS. 



603 



Tbe Cowbirds are sociable to a greater degree than most species, 
their companies not breaking up during tbe laying season ; for, as they 
are parasitical, the female merely steals away to drop her egg in any 
nest she can find, after which she returns to the Hock. They feed on 
the ground, where, in their movements and in the habit the male basin 
craning out its neck when disturbed, they resemble Starlings. The 
male has also a curious habit of carrying his tail raised vertically 
while feeding. They follow the domestic cattle about the pastures, and 
frequently a dozen or more birds may be seen perched along the back 
of a cow or horse. When the animal is grazing they group themselves 
close to its mouth like chickens round a hen when she scratches up the 
ground, eager to snatch up the small insects exposed where the grass 
is cropped close. In spring they also follow the plow to pick up worms 
and grubs. 

The song of the male, particularly when making love, is accompanied 
with gestures and actions somewhat like those of the domestic pigeon. 
He swells himself out, beating the ground with his wings, and uttering 
a series of deep internal notes, followed by others loud and clear; and 
occasionally when uttering them he suddenly takes wing and Hies 
directly away from the female to a distance of 50 yards, and performs 
a wide circuit about her in the air, singing all the time. 

The homely object of his short-lived passion always appears utterly 
indifferent to this curious and pretty performance; yet she must be even 
more impressionable than most female birds, since she continues scat- 
tering about her parasitical and often wasted eggs during four months 
in every year. Her language consists of a long note with a splutter- 
ing sound, to express alarm or curiosity, and she occasionally chatters 
in a low tone as if trying to sing. In the evening when the birds con- 
gregate on the trees to roost they often continue singing in concert 
until it is quite dark; and when disturbed at night the females fre- 
quently utter their song while taking flight, reminding one of the 
Icterns pyrrhoptcriis, which has only its usual melody to express fear 
and other painful emotions. On rainy days, when they are driven to 
the shelter of trees, they will often sing together for hours without 
intermission, the blending of innumerable voices producing a rushing 
sound as of a high wind. At the end of summer they congregate in 
flocks of tens of thousands so that the ground where they are feeding 
seems carpeted Avith black, and the trees when they alight appear to 
have a black foliage. At such times one wonders that many small 
species on which they are parasites do not become extinct by means of 
their pernicious habit. In Buenos Ayres, where they are most numer- 
ous, they have a migration, which is only partial, however. It is notice- 
able chiefly in the autumn, and varies greatly in different years. In 
some seasons it is very marked, when for many days in February and 
March the birds are seen traveling northward, flocks succeeding flocks 
all day long, passing by with a swift, low, undulating flight, their wings 



604 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

producing a soft musical sound ; and tliis Immming flight of tlie migrat- 
ing Cowbirds is as familiar to every one acquainted with nature iu 
Buenos Ayres as the whistling of the wind or the distant lowing of 
cattle. 

The procreant instinct of this Molothriis has always seemed so impor- 
tant to me, for many reasons, that I have paid a great deal of attention 
to it; and the facts, or, at all events, the most salient of them, which 1 
have collected during several years of observation, I propose to append 
here, classified under different headings so as to avoid confusion, and 
to make it easy for other observers to see at a glance just how much I 
have learned. 

Though T have been familiar with this species from childhood, when 
I used to hunt every day for their wasted eggs on the broad, clean 
walks of the plantation, and removed them in pity from the nests of 
little birds where I found them, I have- never ceased to wonder at their 
strange instinct, which in its wasteful, destructive character, so unlike 
the parasitical habit in other species, seems to strike a discordant note 
in the midst of the general harmony of nature. 

Mistakes and imperfections ok the procreant instinct of Molotiikus hon- 

ariensis. 

1. The Cowbirds, as we have seen, frequently waste their eggs by 
dropping them on the ground. 

2. They also occasionally lay in old forsaken nests. This I have often 
observed, and to make very sure I took several old nests and placed 
them in trees and bushes, and found that eggs were laid in them. 

3. They also frequently lay in nests where incubation has actually 
begun. When this happens the Cowbird's e^^ is lost, if incubation is 
far advanced; but if the eggs have been sat on three or four days only, 
then it has a good chance of being hatched and the young bird reared 
along with its foster brothers. 

4. One female often lays several eggs in the same nest, instead of 
laying only one, as does, according to Wilson, the Molothrus pecoris of 
North America. I conclude that this is so from the fact that in cases 
where the eggs of a species vary considerably in form, size, and mark- 
ings, each individual of the species lays eggs precisely or nearly alike. 
So when I find 2, 3, or 4 eggs of the Cowbird in one nest all alike in 
color and other particulars, and yet in half a hundred eggs from other 
nests can not find one to match with them, it is impossible not to 
believe that the eggs found together, and possessing a family likeness, 
were laid by the same bird. 

5. Several females often lay in one nest, so that the number of eggs 
in it frequently makes incubation impossible. One December I col- 
lected ten nests of the Scissortail, ilf?7t'«/*/s tyranuus, from my trees; 
they contained a total of 47 eggs, 12 of the Scissortails and 35 of the 
Cowbirds. It is worthy of remark that the Milvuliis breeds in October 



THE COWBIRDS 605 

or early iu November, rearing only one brood; so that tliese ten nests 
found late in December were of birds that bad lost their first nests. 
Probably three-fourtbs of the lost nests of Milvulus are abandoned in 
consequence of the confusion caused in them by the Cowbirds. 

6. The Cowbirds, male and female, destroy many of the eggs in the 
nests they visit, by pecking holes iu the shells, breaking, devouring, 
and stealing them. This is the most destructive habit of the bird, and 
is probably possessed by individuals in different degrees. I have often 
carefully examined all the parasitical eggs iu a nest, and after three or 
four days found that these eggs had disappeared, others, newly laid, 
being in their places. I have seen the female Cowbird strike her beak 
into an egg and fly away with it; and I have often watched the male 
bird perched close by while the female was on the nest, and when she 
quitted it seen him drop down and begin pecking holes in the eggs. In 
some nests found full of parasitical eggs every egg has holes pecked in 
the shell, for the bird destroys indiscriminately eggs of its own and of 
other species. 

Advantages posskssed by M. boxariensis over its dupes. 

After reading the preceding notes one might ask, if there is so much 
that is defective and irregular in the reproductive instinct of 21. 
honariensis, how does the species maintain its existence, and even 
increase to such an amazing extent, for it certainly is very much more 
numerous, over an equal area, than other parasitical species. For its 
greater abundance there may be many reasons unknown to us. The 
rarer sjiecies may be less hardy, have more enemies, be exposed to 
more perils in their long migrations, etc. That it is able to maintain 
its existence in spite of irregularities in its instinct is no doubt due to 
the fact that its eggs and young possess many advantages over the 
eggs and young of the species upon which it is parasitical. Some of 
these advantages are due to those very habits of the parent bird which 
at first sight appear most defective; others to the character of the egg 
and embryo, time of evolution, etc. 

1. The egg of the Cowbird is usually larger, and almost invariably 
harder shelled than are the eggs it is placed with ; those of the Yellow- 
breast, Psendoleistes virescens, being the one exception I am acquainted 
with. The harder shell of its own egg, considered in relation to the 
destructive egg-breaking habit of the bird, gives it the best chance of 
being preserved; for though the Cowbird never distinguishes its own 
eggs, of which indeed it destroys a great many, a larger projiortiou 
escape in a nest Avhere many eggs are indiscriminately broken. 

2. The vitality or tenacity of life appears greater in the embryo 
Cowbird than in other species; this circumstance also, in relation to 
the egg-breaking habit and to the habit of laying many eggs in a nest, 
gives it a further advantage. I have examined nests of the Scissor- 
tail, containing many eggs, after incubation had begun, and have been 
surprised at finding those of tbe Scissortail addled, even when placed 



606 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

most advantageously in the nest for receiving heat from the parent bird, 
while those of the Cowbird contained living embryos, even when 
under all the other eggs, and as frequently happens, glued immovably 
to the nest by the matter from broken eggs spilt over them. 

The following instance of extraordinary vitality in an embryo Molo- 
thrus seems to show incidentally that in some species protective habits, 
which will act as a check on the parasitical instinct, may be in the 
course of formation. 

Though birds do not, as a rule, seem able to distinguish parasitical 
eggs fnmi their own, however different in size and color they may be, 
they often do seem to know that eggs dropped in their nest before they 
themselves have began to lay ought not to be there? and the nest, even 
after its compljetion, is not infrequently abandoned on account of these 
premature eggs. Some species, however, do not forsake their nests; 
and though they do not throw the parasitical eggs out, which would 
seem the simplest plan, they have discovered how to get rid of them 
and so save themselves the labor of making a fresh nest. Their method 
is to add a new deep lining, under which the strange eggs are buried 
out of sight and give no more trouble. The 8iso2)ygis ieterophrys, a 
common Tyrant Bird in Buenos Ayres, frequently has recourse to this 
expedient, and the nest it makes being rather shallow the layer of 
fresh material, under which the strange eggs are buried, is built 
upward above the rim of the original nest, so that this supplementary 
nest is like one saucer placed within another, and the observer is gen- 
erally able to tell from the thickness of the whole structure whether 
any parasitical eggs have been entombed in it or not. Finding a very 
thick nest one day, containing 2 half-fledged young birds besides 3 
addled eggs, I opened it, removing the upper portion, or additional 
nest, intact, and discovered beneath it three buried Molothrus eggs, 
their shells encrusted with dirt and glued together with broken egg- 
matter spilt over them. In trying to get them out without pulling the 
nest to pieces I broke them all. Two Avere quite rotten, but the third con- 
tained a living embryo, ready to be hatched, and very lively and hungry 
when 1 took it in my hand. The young Tyrant Birds were about a 
fortnight old, and as they hatch out only about twenty days after the 
parent bird begins laying, this parasitical egg with a living chick in 
it must have been deeply buried in the nest for five or six weeks. 
Probably after the young Tyrant Birds came out of their sliells and 
began to grow, the little heat from their bodies jDenetrating to the 
buried egg, served to bring the embryo in it to maturity; but when I 
saw it I felt (like a person who sees a ghost) strongly inclined to doubt 
the evidence of my own senses. 

3. The comparatively short time the embryo takes to hatch gives it 
another and a great advantage; for, whereas the eggs of other small 
birds require from fourteen to sixteen days to mature, that of the Cow- 
bird hatches in eleven days and a half from the moment incubation 
commences; so that when the female Cowbird makes so great a mistake 



THE COWBIRDS 607 

as to drop an egg with others that have already been sat on, unless 
incubation be very far advanced, it still has a chance of being hatched 
before or contemporaneously with the others; but even if the others 
hatch first, the extreme hardiness of the embryo serves to keep it alive 
with the modicum of heat it receives. 

4. Whenever the Molothrus is hatched together with the young of 
its foster parents, if these are smaller than the xJarasite, as usually is 
the case, soon after exclusion from the shell they disappear, and the 
young Cowbird remains sole occupant of the nest. How it succeeds in 
expelling or destroying them, if it indeed does destroy them, I have not 
been able to learn. 

5. To all these circumstances favorable to the Molothrus may be added 
another of equal or even greater importance. It is never engaged with 
the dilatory and exhaustive process of rearing its own young, an.d for 
this reason continues in better condition than other species; and, more- 
over, l^eing gregarious and practising promiscuously sexual intercourse, 
must lay a much greater number of eggs than other species. In our 
domestic fowls we see that hens that never become broody lay a great 
deal more than others. Some of our small birds rear two, others only 
one brood in the season, building, incubation, and tending the young 
taking up much time, so that they areusually from two to three months 
and a half employed. But the Cowbird is like the fowl that never incu- 
bates, and continues dropping eggs during four months and a half. 
From the beginning of September until the end of January the males 
are seen incessantly wooing the females, and during most of this time 
eggs are found. I find that small birds will, if deprived repeatedly of 
their nests, lay and even hatch four times in the season, thus laying, 
if the full complement be 4, 16 eggs. I^o doubt the Cowbird lays a 
much larger number than that; my belief is that every female lays from 
60 to 100 eggs every season, though I have nothing but the extraordi- 
nary nuTuber of wasted eggs one finds to judge from. 

Before dismissing the subject of the advantages the Molothrus pos- 
sesses over its dupes, and of the real or apparent defects of its instinct, 
some attenti(m should be given to another circumstance, viz, the new 
conditions introduced by land cultivation and their effect on the spe- 
cies. The altered conditions have in various ways served to remove 
many extraneous checks on the parasitical instinct, and the more the 
birds inu]ti]tly the more irregular and disordered does the instinct 
necessarily become. In wild districts where it was formed, and where 
birds building accessible nests are proportionately fewer, the instinct 
seems different from what it 1i"oes in cultivated districts. Parasitical 
eggs are not common in the desert, and even the most exposed nests 
there are probably never overburdened with them. But in cultivated 
places, where their food abounds, the birds congregate in the orchards 
and plantations in great numbers, and avail themselves of all the nests, 
ill-concealed as they must always be in the clean, opeu-foliaged trees 
planted by man. 



608 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

DivEKSiTY IN Color of Eggs. 

There is an extraordinary diversity in the color, form, and disposi- 
tion of nuirkiugs, etc., of the eggs of M. honariensis; and I doubt 
whetUer any otlier species exists hiying eggs so varied. About half 
the eggs one finds, or nearly half, are pure unspotted white, like the 
eggs of birds that breed in dark holes. Others are sparsely sprinkled 
with such exceedingly minute specks of pale pink or gray as to appear 
quite spotless until closely examined. After the pure white, the most 
common variety is an egg with a white ground, densely and uniformly 
spotted or blotched with red. Another uot uncommon variety has a 
very pale, tiesh-colored ground, uniformly marked with fine characters, 
that look as if inscribed on the shell with a pen. A much rarer variety 
has a pure white shell Avith a few large or variously sized chocolate 
spots. Perhaps the rarest variety is an egg entirely of a fine deep red; 
but between this lovely marbled egg and the white one with almost 
imperceptible specks there are varieties without number, for there is 
no such thing as characteristic markings in the eggs of this species, 
although, as I have said before, the eggs of the same individual show 
a family resemblance. 

Habits of the Young of M. Bonariensis. 

Small birds of all species, when first hatched, closely resemble each 
other. After they are fledged the resemblance is less, but still com- 
paratively great. Gray, interspersed with brown, is the color of most 
of them, or at least of the uj^per exposed plumage. There is also a 
great similarity in their cries of hunger and fear — shrill, querulous, 
])rolonged, and usually tremulous notes. It is not, then, to be won- 
dered at that the foster parents of the young MoJothrus so readily 
respond to its cries, understanding the various expressions denoting- 
hunger, fear, pain, as well as when uttered by their own offspring. 
But the young Molothrus never understands the language of its foster 
jjarents as other young birds understand the language of their real 
parents, rising to receive food when summoned, and concealing them- 
selves or trying to escape when the warning note is given. How does 
the young Molothrus learn to distinguish, even by sight, its foster 
parent from any other bird approaching the nest? It generally mani- 
fests no fear even at a large object. On thrusting my fingers into any 
nest I find the young birds, if still blind or but recently hatched, will 
hold up and open their mouths, expecting food; but in a very few days 
they learn to distinguish between their^ parents and other objects 
approaching them, and to show alarm even when not warned of danger. 
Consider the different behavior of three species that seldom or never 
warn their offspring of danger : The young of SynaUaxiH ,spi,ri, though in 
a deep, domed nest, will throw itself to the ground, attempting thus to 
make its escape; the young of Mimusjyatagonicus sits close and motion- 
less, with closed eyes, mimicking death; the young of our common 



THE COWBIRDS. 609 

Zenaida^exen before it is fledged, will swell itself np and strike angrily 
at tbe intruder with beak and wings, and by making so brave a show of 
its iueftieient weapons it probably often saves itself from destruction. 
But anything- approaching the young Molothrus is welcomed with lint- 
teriug wings and clamorous cries, as if all creatures were expected to 
minister to its necessities. 

December 24. — To-day I found a young Molothrus in the nest of 
Spermophila ccerulescens. He cried for food ou seeing my hand approach 
the nest. I took him out and dropped him down, when, finding himself 
on the ground, he immediately made off, half flying. After a hard 
chase I succeeded in recapturing him, and began to twirl him about, 
making him scream, so as to inform his foster parents of his situation, 
for they were not by at the moment. I then put him back in, or rather 
upon, the little cradle of a nest, and plucked half a dozen large 
measure worms from an adjacent twig. The worms I handed to the 
bird as I drew them from the cases, and with great greediness he 
devoured them all, notwithstanding the ill treatment he had Just 
received, and utterly disregarding the wild, excited cries of his foster 
parents, just arrived and hovering within 3 or 4 feet of the nest. 

Last summer I noticed a young Cowbird in a stubble field, jierched 
on the top of a slender, dry stalk. As it was clamoring at short inter- 
vals, I waited to see what bird would come to it. It proved to be the 
diminutive Hapalocercus flaviventris, and I was much amused to see 
the little thing fly directly to its large foster oft'spring and, alighting on 
its back, drop a worm into the upturned open mouth. After remaining 
a moment on its singular perch, the Flycatcher flew away, but in less 
than half a minute returned and perched again on the young bird's 
back. I continued watching them until the Molothrus flew off, but not 
before I had seen him fed seven or eight times in the same manner. 

In the two foregoing anecdotes may be seen the ])eculiar habits of 
the young Molothrus. As the nests in which it is hatched, from those 
of the little Serpo^jhaga and Wren to those of Miiuus, vary so much in 
size and materials, and are placed in such different situations, the 
young 2[olothrus must have in most of them a somewhat incongruous 
appearance. But in the habits of the young bird is the greatest incon- 
gruity or inadaptation. When the nest is in a close thicket or forest, 
though much too small for the bird, and although the bird itself can 
not understand its foster parents and welcomes all things that, whether 
with good or evil design, come near it, the unfitness is not so api)areut 
as when the nest is in open fields and plains. 

The young Molothrus differs from the true offspring of its foster 
parents in its habit of ([uitting the nest as soon as it is able, trying 
to follow the old bird, and placing itself in the most conspicuous place 
it can find, such as the summit of a stalk or weed, and there demand- 
ing food with frequent and importunate cries. Thus the little Fly- 
catcher had acquired the habit of perching on the back of its charge to 
H. Mis. 184, pt. 2 39 



610 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

feed it, because parent birds invariably perch above their young to feed 
tliem, and the young Cowbird prevented this by always sitting ou the 
summit of the stalk it perched on. The habit is most fatal on the opeu 
and closely cropped pampas inhabited by the Cachila, Anthtis corren- 
dera. In December, when the Cachila Pipit rears its second brood, 
the Milvago chiniango also has young, and feeds them almost exclu- 
sively on the yonng of various species of small birds. At this season 
the Chimango destroys great numbers of the young of the Cachila and 
of SynaUa.ris hudsoni. Yet these birds are beautifully adapted, in 
structure, coloration, and habits, to their station. It thus happens that 
in districts where the Molothrus is abundant their eggs are found in a 
majority of the Cachilas's nests; and yet to hnd a young Cowbird out 
of the nest is a rare thing here, for as soon as the young birds are able 
to quit the nest and expose themselves they are all or nearly all carried 
off" by the Ghimangos. 

Conjectures as to the Origin of the Parasitic Instinct in M. BoNARiENsig. 

Darwin's opinion that the "immediate and final cause of the Cuckoo's 
instinct is that she lays her eggs not daily, but at intervals of two or 
three days" (Origin of Species), carries no great appearance of proba- 
bility with it; for might it not just as reasonably be said that the para- 
sitic instiiKit is the immediate and final cause of her laying her eggs at 
long intervals? If it is favorable to a species with the instinct of the 
Cuckoo (and it probably is favorable) to lay eggs at longer intervals 
than other species, then natural selection would avail itself of every 
modification in the reproductive organs that tended to produce such a 
result, ami make the improved structure permanent. It is said (Origin 
of Species, Chap. Vii) that the American Cuckoo lays also at long inter- 
vals, and has eggs and young at the same time in its nest, a circum- 
stance manifestly disadvantageous. Of the Coccyzus melanocoryphus, 
the only one of our three Coccyzi whose nesting habits I am acquainted 
with, 1 can say that it never begins to incubate till the full complement 
of egfts are laid — that its young are hatched simultaneously. But if it 
is sought to trace the origin of the Euroi)ean Cuckoo's instinct in the 
nesting habits of American Coccyzi^ it might be attributed not to the 
aberrant habit of ])erhaps a single species, but to another and more dis- 
advantagecms habit common to the entire genus, viz, their habit of 
building exceedingly frail platform nests, from which the eggs and young 
very frequently fall. By occasionally dro])ping an egg in the deep, 
secure nest of some other bird an advantage would be possessed by the 
birds hatched in them, and in them the habit would perhaps become 
hereditary. Be this as it may (and the one guess is perhaps as wi<le of 
the truth as the other), there are many genera intermediate between 
CucnlnH and Molothrus in wliich no trace of a i)arasiti(! habit ai)pears; 
and it seems more than i)robable that the aiudogous instincts originated 
iu different ways in the two genera. As regards the origin of the 



THE COWBIRDS. 611 

instinct in Molothrns, it will perhaps seem premature to found specula- 
tions on the few facts Lere recorded and before we are acquainted with 
the habits of other members of the genus. That a species should totally 
lose so universal an instinct as the maternal one, and yet avail itself of 
that afteetion in other species to i)ropagate itself, seems a great mystery. 
Nevertheless, I can not refrain from all conjecture on the subject, and 
will go so far as to suggest what may have been at least one of the many 
concurrent causes that have produced the parasitic instinct. The a])iKir- 
ently transitional nesting habits of several species, and one remarkrable 
habit of .1/. hotutriemis, seem to me to throw some light on ai)oint bear- 
ing intimately on the subject, viz, the loss of the nest-making instinct 
in this species. 

Habits vary greatly; were it not so, they would never seem so well 
adajtted to the conditions of life as we find them, since the conditions 
themselves are not unchangeable. Thus it happens that while a spe- 
cies seems well adapted to its state in its habits, it frequently seems 
not so well adapted in its relatively immutable structure. For exam])le, 
without going away from the pampas, we find a Tringa with the habits 
of an upland Plover, a Tyrant Bird, ntangiis helUcosus, preying on 
mice and snakes, another Tyrant Bird, Myiotheretes rujiventris, Plover- 
like in its habits, and linally a Woodpecker, Colaptes campestris, that seeks 
its food on the ground like a Starling; yet in none of these — and the list 
might be greatly lengthened — has there been anything like a modifica- 
tion of structure to keep pace with the altered manner of life. But, how- 
ever much the original or generic habits of a species may have become 
altered — the habits of a species being widely difterent from those of its 
congeners, also a want of correspondence between structure and habits 
(the last being always more suited to conditions than the first) being- 
taken as evidence of such alteration — traces of ancient and disused 
habits frequently reappear. Seemingly capricious actions, too numerous, 
too vague, or too insignificant to be i ecorded, improvised definite actions 
that are not habitual, apparent imitations of the actions of other species, 
a peri^etual inclination to attempt something that is never attempted, 
and attempts to do that which is never done — these and other like 
motions are, I believe, in many cases to be attributed to the faint 
promptings of obsolete instincts. To the same cause many of the occa- 
sional aberrant habits of individuals may possibly be due — such as of 
a bird that builds in trees occasionally laying ou the ground. If recur- 
rence to an ancestral type be traceable in structure, coloration, language, 
it is reasonable to expect something analogous to occur in instincts. 
But even if such casual and often aimless motions as I have mentioned 
should guide us unerringly to the knowledge of the old and disused 
instincts of a species, this knowledge of itself would not enable us to 
discover the origin of present ones. But, assuming it as a fact that the 
conditions of existence and the changes going on in them are in every 
case the fundamental cause of alterations in habits, I believe that in 



612 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

many cases a knowledge of the disused instincts will assist us very 
materially in the inquiry. I will illustrate my meaning- with a suppo- 
sititious case. Should all or many species of Cohimhidw manifest au 
inclination for haunting rocks and banks, and for entering or peering 
into holes in them, such vague and purposeless actions, connected with 
the facts that all doves build simple platform nests (like Columha liria 
and others that build on a flat surface), also lay white eggs (the rule 
being that eggs laid in dark holes are white, exposed eggs colored), also 
that one species, C. liria, does lay in holes in rocks, would lead us to 
believe that the habit of this species was once common to the genus. 
We should conclude that an insufficiency of projjer breeding places, 
i. e., new external conditions, first induced doves to build in trees. 
Thus C. liria also builds in trees where there are no rocks; but, when 
able, returns to its ancestral habits. In the other species Ave should 
believe the primitive habit to be totally lost from disuse, or only to 
manifest itself in a faint, uncertain manner. 

!N'ow, in Molothnis b(>)iarienfiis we see just such a vague, purpose- 
less habit as the imaginary one 1 have <lescribed. Before and dur- 
ing the breeding season the females, sometimes accompanied by the 
males, are seen continually haunting and examining the domed nests 
of some of the Bendrocolaptida'. This does not seem like a mere 
freak of curiosity, but their persistence in their investigations is 
precisely like that of birds that habitually make choice of such 
breeding places. It is surprising that they never do actually lay in 
such nests, ex(;ept when the side or dome has been accidentally 
broken enough to admit the light into the interior. AVhenever I set 
boxes up in my trees the female Cowbirds were the first to visit them. 
Sometimes one will spend half a day loitering about and inspecting a 
box, repeatedly climbing round and over it and always ending at the 
entrance, into which she peers curiously, and when about to enter 
starting back as if scared at the obscurity within; but after retiring 
a little spa(;e she will return again and again, as if fascinated with the 
comfort and security of such an abode. It is amusing to see how per- 
tinaciously they hang about the ovens of the Ovenbirds, apparently 
det rmined to take jiossession of them, flying back after a hundred 
repnlses, and yet not entering them even when they have the oppor- 
tunity. Sometimes one is seen following a wren or a swallow to its 
nest beneath the eaves, and then clinging to the wall beneath the hole 
into which it disappeared. I could fill many pages with instances of 
this habit of .1/. bonariensis, which, useless though it be, is as strong 
an affection as the bird possesses. That it is a recurrence to a long- 
disused habit 1 can scarcely doubt; at least, to no other cause that I can 
imaguie can it be attributed; and, besides, it seems to me that if M. 
bonarieiifiis, when once a nest builder, had acquired the semiparasiti- 
»m1 habit of breeding in domed nests of other birds, such a habit 
might conduce to the formation of the instinct which it now possesses. 



THE COWBIKDS. 613 

1 aiay lueutiou tliat twice 1 have seen birds of tliis species attempting 
to build nests, and that on both occasions they failed to complete the 
work. So universal is the nest-making instinct that one might safely 
say tlie M. honariensis had once possessed it, and that in the cases I 
have mentioned it was a recurrence, too weak to be eliicient, to the 
ancestral habit. Another interesting circumstance may be adduced as 
strong presumptive evidence that M. honariensis once made itself an 
open exposed nest as M. hadius occasionally does, viz, the difference 
in color of the male and female, for while the former is rich purple 
the latter possesses an adaptive resemblance in color to nests and to 
the shaded interior twigs and branches on which nests are usually 
built. How could such an instinct have been lost? To say that the 
Cowbird occasionally dropped au egg in another bird's nest, and that 
the young hatched from these occasional eggs possessed some (hypo- 
thetical) advantage over those hatched in the usual way, aud that the 
parasitical habit so became hereditary, sui)planting the original one, is 
an assertion without anything to support it, and seems to exclude the 
agency of external conditions. Again, the want of correspondence in 
the habits of the young parasite and its foster parents would in reality 
be a disadvantage to the former; the unfitness would be as great in 
the eggs and other circumstances, for all the advantages the parasite 
actually possesses in the comparative hardness of the eggshell, rapid 
evolution of the young, etc., already mentioned, must have been 
acquired little by little through the slowly accumulating process of 
natural selection, but subsequently to the formation of the original 
parasitical inclination and habit, I am inclined to believe that M, 
honariensis lost the nest-making instinct by acquiring that semipara- 
sitical habit common to so many South American birds of breeding in 
the large covered nests of the Dendrocolaptidw. We have evidence 
that this semiparasitical liabit does tend to eradicate the nest-making 
one. The SynaJlaxes build great elaborate domed nests, yet we have 
one species [S. wgithaloides) that never builds for itself, but breeds in 
the nests of other birds of the same genus. In some species the nest- 
making habit is in a transitional state, Machetornis rixosa sometimes 
makes an elaborate nest in the angle formed by twigs and the bough of 
a tree, but prefers, and almost invariably makes choice of, the coverec; 
nest of some other species or of a hole in the tree. It is precisely the 
same with our Wren, Troglodytes furvus. The Yellow House Sparrow, 
Sycalis lyehelnii, invariably breeds in a dark hole or covered nest. The 
fact that these three species lay colored eggs, and the -first aud last 
very darkly colored eggs, inclines one to belive that they once invari- 
ably built exposed nests, as M. rixosa still occasionally does. It may 
be- added that those species that lay colored eggs in dark places con- 
struct and line their nests far more neatly than do the species that 
breed in such places but lay white eggs. As with M. rixosa and the 
Wren, so it is with the Bay- winged Molothrus; it lays mottled eggs, and 



614 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

occasionally builds a neat, exposed nest; yet so great is the partiality 
it has acquired for large domed nests, that whenever it can possess 
itself of one by dint of lighting it will not build one for itself. Let us 
suppose that the Oowbird also once acquired the habit of breeding in 
domed nests, and that through this habit its original nest-making 
iustiuct was completely eradicated. It is not difrtcult to imagine how 
in its turn this instinct was also lost. A diminution in the number of 
birds that built domed nests would involve 3/. bonariensis in a struggle 
for nests, in which it would probably be defeated. In Buenos Ayres 
theWhite-rumped Swallow, the Wren, and the Yellow Seed-tinch prefer 
the ovens of the Furnarius to any other breeding i)lace, but to obtain 
them are obliged to struggle with Progue trtprra. for this species has 
acquired the habit of breeding exclusively in the ovens. They can 
not, however, compete with the Prague, and thus the increase of one 
species has, to a great extent, deprived three other species of their 
favorite building place. Again, Maclietornis rixosa prefers the great 
nest of the Annmhius, and when other species compete with it for the 
nest they are invariably defeated. I have seen a pair of Machetornis, 
after they had seized a nest, attacked in their turn by a Hock of or 8 
Bay-wings, but, in spite of the superior numbers, the fury of the 
Machetornis compelled them to raise the siege. 

Thus some events in the history of our common Mohthrus have per- 
haps been accounted for, if not the most essential one — the loss of the 
nest-making instinct from the acquisition of the habit of breeding in 
the covered nests of other birds, a habit that has left a strong trace 
in the manners of the species, and perhaps in the pure white unmarked 
eggs of so many individuals; finally, we have seen how this habit. may 
also have been lost. But the parasitical habit of the M. honariensis may 
have originated when the bird was still a nest builder. The origin of 
the instinct may have been in the occasional habit, common to so many 
species, of two or more females laying together; the progenitors of all 
the species of Molothrus may have been early infected with this habit, 
and inherited with it a facility for acquiring their present one. M. 
pecoris and M. honariensis, though their instincts differ, are both para- 
sitic on a great number of species; i\[. rufoaxiUaris on M. badim; and 
in this last species two or more females frequently lay together. If we 
suppose that the 71/. honariensis, wheu it was a nest builder or reared 
its own young in the nests it seized, possessed this habit of two or 
more females frequently laying together, the young of those birds that 
oftenest abandoned their eggs to the care of another would probably 
inherit a weakened maternal instinct. The continual intercrossing of 
individuals with weaker and stronger instincts would prevent the 
formation of two races differing in habit; but the Avhole race wouhl 
degenerate, and would only be saved from final extinction by some 
individuals occasionally (Iropi)ing their eggs in the nests of other 
species, perhaps of a Molothrus, as M. rufoaxiUaris still does, rather than 



THE COWBIRDS. 615 

of birds of other genera. Certainly in this way the parasitic instinct 
may liave originated in M. honariensis withont that species ever having 
acquired the habit of breeding in the covered dark nests of other birds. 
I have supposed that they once possessed it only to account for the 
strange attraction such nests have for them, which seems like a recur- 
rence to an ancestral habit.

Description. — Silky black, washed with purple; wings and tail with 
a slight greenish gloss; a chestnut spot on the axillaries; bill and feet 
black; whole length 8 inches, wing 4.5, tail 3.3. Female similar, but 
somewhat smaller. 

Habitat. — Argentina and Uruguay. 

This bird has no vulgar name, not being distinguished from the 
common Cowbird by the country people. The English name of Scream- 
ing Cowbird, which I have bestowed on it, will, I think, commend 
itself as appropriate to those who observe this bird, for they will always 
and at any distance be able to distinguish it from the species it resem- 
bles so nearly by listening to its impetuous screaming notes, so unlike 
anything in the language of the common Cowbird. 

The Screaming Cowbird is larger than the allied species. The female 
is less than the male in size, but in color they are alike, the entire 
plumage being deep blue-black, glossy, and with purple reflections; 
and under the wing at the joint there is a small rufous spot. The beak 
is very stout, the plumage loose, and with a strong, musky smell; the 
oesophagus remarkably wide. 

It is far less common than the other species of ^[olothrus, but is not 
rare, and ranges south to the Buenos- Ayrean pampas, where a few 
individuals are usually found in every large plantation; and, like the 
3f. badius, it remains with us the whole year. It is not strictly grega- 
rious, but in winter goes in parties, never exceeding five or six indi- 
viduals, and in the breeding season in i^airs. One of its most note- 
worthy traits is an exaggerated hurry and bustle thrown into all its 
movements. When passing from one branch to another, it goes by a 
series of violent jerks, smiting its wings loudly together, and when 
a party of them return from the fields they rush wildly and loudly 
screaming to the trees, as if pursued by a bird of prey. They are not 
singing birds, but the male sometimes, though rarely, attempts a song, 
and utters, with considerable effort, a series of chattering uumelodious 
notes. The chirp with which he invites his mate to fly has the sound 
of a loud and smartly-given kiss. His warning or alarm note when 
approached in the breeding season has a soft and pleasing sound; it 



616 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

is, curiously enough, his only mellow expression. But his most com- 
mon and renuirkable vocal performance is a cry beginning with a hol- 
low-sounding internal note, and swelling into a sharp metallic ring; 
this is uttered with tail and wings spread and depressed, the whole 
l)lumage raised like that of a strutting turkey cock, whilst the bird 
hops briskly ui)and down on its perch as if dancing. From its pufied- 
out appearance, and from the peculiar character of the sound it emits, 
I believe that, like the pigeon and some other species, it has the fac- 
ulty of tilling its crop with air, to use it as a "chamber of resonance." 
The note I have described is quickly and invariably followed by a 
scream, harsh and impetuous, uttered by the female, though both notes 
always sound as if proceeding from one bird. When on the wing the 
birds all scream together in concert. 

The food of this species is chiedy minute seeds and tender buds; 
they also swallow large caterpillars and spiders, but do not, like their 
congeners, eat hard insects. 

I became familiar, even as a small boy, with the habits of the Scream- 
ing Cowbird, and before this species was known to naturalists, but 
could never find its nest, though I sought diligently for it. I could 
never see the birds collecting materials for a nest, or feeding their 
grown-up yonng like other species, and this might have made me sus- 
pect that they did not hatch their own eggs ; but it never occurred to 
me that the bird was i^arasitical, I suppose because in summer they 
are always seen in pairs, the male and female being inseparable. Prob- 
ably this is the only parasitical species in which there is conjugal 
fidelity. I also noticed that, when approached in the breeding season, 
the pair always displayed great excitement and anxiety, like birds 
that have a nest, or that have selected a site on which to build one. 
But year after year the end of the summer would arrive, the birds 
reunite in i)arties of half a dozen, and the mystery remain unsolved. 
At length, after many years, fortune favored me, and while observing 
the habits of another species {Molofhrus hadius), I discovered by chan.ce 
the procreant habits of the Screaming Cowbirds, and as these observa- 
tions throw some light on the habits of M. badius, I think it best to 
transcribe my notes here in full. 

Ai^air of Lenateros {Anumhius ucutkaudatuH) have been nearly all 
the winter building a nest on an acacia tree 00 yards from the house; 
it is about 27 inches deep, and 10 or 18 inches in circumference and 
appeais now nearly finished. I am sure that this nest will be attacked 
before long, and I have resolved to watch it closely. 

September 28. — To-day I saw a Bay- wing (J/, badius) on the nest; it 
climbed over it, deliberately inspecting every j^art with the critical air 
of a proprietor who had ordered its construction, taking up and rear- 
ranging some sticks and throwing others away from the nest. While 
thus engaged two common Cowbirds (.1/. bonariensis), male and female, 
came to the tree. The female dropped on to the nest and began also to 
examine it, peering curiously into the entrance and quarreling with the 



THE COWBIRDS. 617 

first bird. After a few niiiintes she flew away, followed by her glossy 
escort. The Bay-wiiig contiuued its strange, futile work until the 
owners of the nest appeared, whereupon it hopped aside in its usual 
slow leisurely manner, sang for a few moments, then flew away. The 
similarity in the behavior of the two birds struck me very forcibly. In 
the great interest they take in the nests of other birds, especially in 
large covered nests, the two species are identical. But when the 
breeding season comes their habits begin to diverge; then the common 
Cowbird lays in nests of other species, abandoning its eggs to their 
care, while the Bay-wings usually seize on the nests of other birds and 
rear their own young. Yet, as they do occasionally build a neat, elab- 
orate nest for themselves, the habit of taking possession of the nests 
of other birds is, most likely, a recently acquired one, and probably its 
tendency is to eradicate the original building instinct. 

October 8. — This morning, while reading under a tree, my attention 
was aroused by a shrill note as of a bird in distress issuing from the 
neighborhood of the Lenatero's nest; after hearing it repeated at 
intervals for over twenty minutes I went to ascertain the cause. Two 
Bay- wings flew up from the ground under the nest, and on searching in 
the rank clover growing under the tree I discovered the female Lefiatero, 
with plumage wet and draggled, trembling and appearing half dead 
with the rough treatment she had experienced. I put her in the sun, 
and after half an hour, hearing her mate calling, she managed to 
flutter feebly away to join him. The persecutors had dragged her out 
of the nest and would, no doubt, have killed her, had I not come so 
opportunely to the rescue. 

Since writing the above, I have continued to watch the nest. Both 
the Bay-wings and Leilateros left it for some days. Six days after 
picking up the ill-treated female, the Lenateros came back and resumed 
possession. Four days later the Bay-wings also came back; but on 
finding the nest still occupied, they took possession of an unfinished 
oven of an Ovenbird on another tree within L'O yards of the first, and 
immediately began carrying in materials with which to line it. When 
they had finished laying I took their 5 eggs, at the same time throwing 
down the oven, and waited to see what their next move would be. 
They remained on the spot singing incessantly, and still manifesting 
anxiety when approached. I observed them four days, and then was 
absent from home as many more; on returning I found that the 
Lenateros bad once more disappeared and that the nest was now held 
by the Bay- wings. I also noticed that they had opened an entrance 
very low down at the side of the nest which they were using; no 
doubt they had killed and thrown out the young Lenateros. 

It was now early in November, the height of the breeding season, 
and numbers of common Cowbirds constantly visited the nest; but I was 
particularly interested in a pair of Screaming Cowbirds that had also 
begun to grow fond of it, and I resolved to watch them closely. As 



618 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

they spent so iiuicli of tlieir time near the nest, sliowino- great solicitude 
wlien I approached it, I strongly hoped to see them breed in it, if the 
Bay-wings could only be got i id of. The Screaming Cowbirds would 
not, or dared not, attack them; and, as I always think that the worst 
possible use one can put a little bird to is to shoot it, I could not help 
them by destroying the Baywings. I therefore resolved to take their 
eggs, hoping that that would cause them to leave in disgust. 

When I was satisfied from their movenients that they had finished 
laying, I got up to the nest and was astonished to find 10 eggs instead 
of 5 as I had confidently expected; for, though the common Cowbirds 
Lad paid a great deal of attention to the nest, I knew the Bay-wings 
would not allow them to lay in it. 

The 10 eggs in the nest were all unmistakably Bay-wings' eggs, and 
having observed before that several females do occasionally lay together, 
I concluded that in this case two females had laid in the nest, though 

1 had only seen two birds — male and female. After taking the 10 eggs 
the Bay-wings still remained, and in a very short time they appeared 
to be laying again. When I had reason to think that the full comple- 
ment was laid, I visited the nest and found 5 eggs in it; these I also 
took and concluded that the second female had probably gone away, 
after having been deprived of her first clutch. During all this time 
the Screaming Cowbirds remained in the neighborhood and occasion- 
ally visited the tree; but to my very great surprise the Bay-wings still 
stubbornly remained, and by-and-by I found that they were going to 

ay again — the fourth time! When I next visited the nest there were 

2 eggs in it; I left them and returned three days later, expecting to 
find 5 eggs, but found 7 — certainly more than one female had laid in 
the nest on this occasion. After taking these last 7 eggs the Bay- wings 
left, and though the Screaming Cowbirds continued to make occasional 
visits to the nest, to my great disappointment they did not lay in it. 

April 12. — To-day I have made a discovery, and am as pleased with 
it as if I had found a new planet in the sky. The mystery of the Bay- 
wings' nest twice found containing over the usual comjdement of eggs 
is cleared up, and I have now suddenly become ac(piainted with the 
procreant instinct of the Screaming Cowbird. I look on this as a great 
piece of good fortune, for I had thought that the season for making 
any such discovery was already over, as we are so near to winter. 

The Bay-wings are so social in their habits that they always appear 
reluctant to break up their companies in the breeding season. Xo sooner 
is this over, and while the young birds are still fed by the parents, all 
the families about a plantation unite into one tlock. About a month 
ago all the birds about my home had associated in this way together 
and went in a scattered flock, frequenting one favorite feeding spot 
very much, a nu'adow about fifteen minutes' walk from the house. The 
flock was composed, I believe, of 3 families. 10 or IS birds in all. 
The young birds are indistinguishable from the adults, but 1 knew 



THE COWBIRDS. 61 9 

tliat most of these birds were yoiiiio-, liatclied late in the season^ 
from their incessant strident hnnger notes. I lirst observed them about 
the middle of March. A week ago, while riding- past the meadow where 
they were feeding, I noticed among them 3 individuals with ])urple 
S])ots ou their plumage. They were at a distance from me, and I 
naturally concluded that they were young common Cowbiids {M. bona- 
riensis) casually associating with the Bay wings. I was suriirised to 
see them, for the young nuile M. honurioisis always acquires the pur- 
ple plumage before March, so that these individuids were changing 
color five weeks after the usual time. To-day, while out with my gnu, 
I came upon the flock, and noticed 4 of the birds assuming the purple 
plumage, 2 of them being almost entirely that color; but I also noticed 
with astonishment that they had bay or chestnut-colored wings, also 
that those with least purple on them were marvelously like the Bay- 
wings in the mouse colored plumage of the body and the dark tail. I 
had seen these birds before the pur[)le plumage was acquired, and there 
was then not the slightest difference amongst them, the adults and their 
supposed offspring being alike; now some of them appeared to be under- 
going the process of a transmutation into another species. I at once 
shot the 4 spotted birds, along with 2 genuine Bay-wings, and wa& 
delighted to find that the first were young Screaming Cowbirds. 

I must now believe that the extra eggs twice found in the nest of the 
Bay-wings were those of the Screaming Cowbird ; that the latter species 
lays chiefly in the nests of the former; that the eggs of the two species 
are identical in form, size, and color, each bird also laying 5; and that, 
stranger still, the similarity is as perfect in the young birds as it is in 
the eggs. 

Ap7'il 15. — This morning I started in quest of the Bay-wings, and 
observed 1 individual, that had somehow escaped detection the day 
before, assuming the purjde dress. This bird 1 shot; and after the 
flock had resettled a short distance oft" I crept close u]) to them, under 
the shelter of a hedge, to observe them more narrowly. One of the 
adults was closely attended by 3 young birds; and these all, while I 
watched them, fluttered their wings and clamored for food every time 
the old bird stirred on its perch. The 3 young birds seemed pre- 
cisely alike; but presently I noticed that 1 of them had a few minute 
purple spots, and on shooting this one I found it to be a young ]\L 
rnfoaxillaris, while the other 2 were true young Bay-wings. 

The hungry cry of the young M. hadius (Bay-wing) is quite different 
from that of the young M. l)on((Hensis. The cry of the latter is a long\ 
shrill, two-syllabled note, the last syllable being prolonged into a con- 
tinuous squeal when the foster ])arent ajiproaches with food. The cry 
of the young ^^. baditis is short, reedy, tremulous, and uninflected. The 
resemblance of the young M. rufoaxillans to its foster brothers in 
language and idumage is the more remarkable when we reflect that the 
adult bird m its habits, gestures, guttural notes, also in its deep purple 
l)lumage, comes much nearer to M. bonariensis than to 21. baditis. It 



620 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

seems impossible for mimicry to go further than tliis. A slight differ- 
ence m size is quite iniperc'e])tible when the birds are flying about, 
while in language and i)luniage the keenest ornithologist would uot be 
able to detect a difference. But it may be questioned whether this is 
really a case of an external reseniblan(;e of one species to another 
acquired by natural selection for its better preservation. Possibly the 
young .1/. rufoaxillaru in the first stage of its plumage exhibits the 
ancestral tyi)e — that of the ])rogeuitor of both species. If M. badius 
belonged to someother group — Sturnclla or rseudolchtes, for iustance — 
it would scarcely be possible to doubt that the resemblance of the young 
M. riifoaxiUaris to its foster brothers resulted from mimicry; but as 
both species belong to the limited, well-defined group Molothrus, the 
resemblance may be ascribed to community of descent. 

Formerly I believed that, though M. badius is constantly seen rearing 
its own young, they also occasionally dro])ped their eggs in the uests 
of other birds. 1 could not doubt that this was the case after having 
witnessed a couple of their young following a Yellowbreast and being 
fed by it. I must now alter my opinion, for what then appeared to be 
proof positive is now no proof at all, lor those two birds were probably 
the young of M. ritfoa.villaris. There are, however, good reasons for 
believing that- ^1/. rufoaxillaris is parasitical almost exclusively on M. 
badius. 1 have spoken of the many varieties of eggs M. bonarieH,sis 
lays. Those of M. badius are a trifle less in size, in form elliptical, 
densely and uniformly marked with small spots and blotches of dark 
reddish color, varying to dusky brown ; the ground (;olor is white, but 
sometimes, though rarely, pale blue. It is not possible to confound the 
eggs of the two species. Now, ever since I saw, many years ago, the 
Yellow breast feeding the supposed young Bay-wings, I have looked 
out for the eggs of the latter in other birds' nests. I have found hun- 
dreds of uests containing eggs of ^[. bonariensis, but never one with 
an egg of M. badius, and, I may now add, never one with an egg of 
31. rufoaxillaris. It is wonderful that M. rufoaxillaris should lay only 
in the uests of M. badius, but the most mysterious thing is that M. 
bonariensis, indiscriminately i)arasitical on a host of species, never, to 
my knowledge, drops an egg in the iiest of M. badius, unless it be in a 
forsaken nest. rerhai)S it wdl be difficult for naturalists to believe 
this, for if the M. badius is so excessively vigilant and jealous of other 
birds approaching its nest as to succeed in keeping out the subtle, 
silent, gray-i)lumaged, omnipresent female 21. bonariensis, why does it 
not also keep ott' the far rarer, noisy, bustling, conspicuously colored 
il/. rufoaxillaris f I cannot say. The only explanation that has occurred 
to me is that M. badius is sagacious enough to distinguish the eggs of 
the common parasite, and throws them out of its nest. But this is 
scarcely probable, for 1 have hunted in vain under the trees for the 
ejected eggs, and I have never found the eggs of il/". badius with holes 
pecked in the shells, which would have been the case had ilf. bonariensis 
intruded into the nest. 



THE COWBIRDS. 621 

With the results just recorded I felt more than satistied, though so 
much still remained to be known, and 1 looked forward to the next 
summer to work out the rich mine ( n which 1 had stumbled by chance. 
Unhappily, when spriug came around again ill health kept me a prisoner 
in the city, and finding no improvement in my condition, I eventually 
left Buenos Ayres at the close of the warm season to try whether 
change of climate would benetit me. Before leaving, however, I spent 
a few days at home and saw enough then to satisfy me that my conclu- 
sions were correct. Most of the birds had finished breeding, but 
while examining some nests of Annmbius I found one which Bay-wings 
had tenanted, and which for some reason they had forsaken, leaving 10 
unincubated eggs. They were all like Bay-wings' eggs, but I have no 
doubt that 5 of them were eggs of ilL rufoaxillaris. During my rides 
in the neighborhood I also found two flocks of Bay-wings, each com- 
posed of several families, and among the young birds I noticed several 
individuals beginning to assume the purple plumage, like those of the 
previous autumn. I did not think it necessary to shoot more specimens. 

The question why M. hadius permits M. rufoaxillaris to use its nest, 
while excluding the allied parasite, M. bonariensis, must be answered 
by future observers; but before passing from this very interesting 
group {Molothrns), I wish to make some general remarks on their habits 
and their anomalous relations to other species. 

It is with a considerable degree of repugnance that we regard the 
parasitical instincts in birds. The reason it excites such a feeling is 
nuinifestly because it presents itself to the mind as — to use the words 
of a naturalist of the last century, who was also a theologian, and 
believed the Cuckoo had been created with such a habit — "a monstrous 
outrage on the maternal affection, one of the first great dictates of 
nature." An outrage, since each creature has been endowed with this 
all-powerful affection for the preservation of its own, and not another, 
si)ecies; and here we see it, by a subtle process, an unconscious iniq- 
uity, turned from its puri)ose, perverted and made subservient to the 
very opposing agency against which it was intended as a safeguard. 
The formation of such an instinct seems, indeed, like an unforseen con- 
tingency in the system of nature, a malady strengthened, if not induced, 
by the very laws established for the preservation of health, and which 
the vis medicairix of nature is incai)able of eliminating. Again, the 
egg of a parasitical si)ecies is generally so much larger, differing also 
in coloration from the eggs it is placed with, while there is such an 
unvarying dissimilarity between the young bird and its living or mur- 
dered foster brothers, that, unreasoning as we know instinct, and 
especially the maternal instinct, is, we are shocked at so glaring and 
flagrant an instance of its blind stupidity. 

In the competition for place, the struggle for its existence, said with 
reason to be most deadly between such species as are most nearly 
allied, the operations are imperceptible, and the changes are so gradual 



622 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

that tbe (liiniuution and final disappearance of one species is never 
attributed to a corresponding increase in another more favored species 
over tlic same region. It is not as if the regnant species had invaded 
and seized ou the province of another, but appears rather as if they 
liad ([uietly entered on the possession of an inheritance that was theirs 
by riglit. Mighty as are tlie results worked out by such a process, it 
is only by a somewhat strained metaphor that it can be called a strug 
gle. But even when tlie war is open and declared, as between a 
raptorial species and its victims, the former is manifestly driven by 
necessity. And in this case the species preyed on are endowed with 
peculiar sagacity to escape its persecutions, so that the war is not one 
of extermination, but, as in a border war, the invader is satisfied with 
carrying off the weak and unwary stragglers. Thus the open, declared 
enmity is in reality beneficial to a species, for it is sure to cut off all 
such individuals as might cause its degeueration. But we can conceive 
no necessity for such a fatal instinct as that of the Cuckoo and Cow- 
bird destructive to such myriads of lives in their beginning. And 
inasmuch as their preservation is inimical to the species ou which they 
are i)arasitical, there must also here be a struggle. But what kind of 
a struggle? Not as in other species, where one perishes in the combat 
that gives greater streugth to the victor, but an anomalous struggle in 
which one of tlie combatants has nuide his adversary turn his weajjons 
against himself, and so seems to have an infinite advantage. It is 
impossible for him to suffer defeat; and yet, to follow out the meta- 
phor, he has so wormed about and interlaced liimself with his oppo- 
nent that as soon as he succeeds iu overcoming him he also must 
inevitably perish. Such a result is, perhaps, impossible, as there are so 
many causes operating to check the undue increase of any one species j 
consequently the struggle, nnequal as it appears, must continue for- 
ever. Thus, in whatever way we view the parasitical habit, it ajipears 
cruel, treacherous, and vicious in the highest degree. But should we 
attempt to mentally create a perfect parasitical instinct (that is, one 
that would be thoronghly efficient with the least possible prejudice to 
or injustice toward another species — for tlie ])reservation of the spe- 
cies on which the parasite is dependent is necessary to its own) by 
combining in imagination all known parasitical habits, eliminating 
every ofi'ensive quality or circumstance, and attributing such others 
in their place as we should think fit, our conception would probably 
still fall short in simplicity, beauty, and completeness of the actual 
instinct of M. rufoaxillaris. Instead of laying its eggs promiscuously 
in every receptacle that offers, it selects the nest of a single species; so 
that its selective instinct is related to the adaptive resemblance in its 
eggs and young to those of the species ou which it is parasitical. Such 
an adaptive resemblance could not, of course, exist if it laid its eggs 
in the nests of more than one species, and it is certainly a circumstance 
eminently favorable to preservation. Then, there not being any such 



THE COVVBIRDS. 623 

incongruity and unfitness as we iiud in nests into wliicli other para- 
sites intrude, there is no reason here to regard the foster parents' aftec- 
tion as blind and stupid, tlie similarity beiug close enough to batSe 
the keenest sagacity. Nor can the instinct here appear in the light of 
an outrage on the maternal affection, for the young 71/. rufoaxillaris 
possesses no advantage over its foster brothers. It is not endowed 
with greater strength and voracity to monopolize the attentions of the 
foster parent or to eject the real offspring; but being in every particu- 
lar precisely like them, it has only an equal chance of being preserved. 
To this wonderful parasitical instinct we may well ai)ply Darwin's 
words, when speaking of the architecture of the hive bee, "Beyond 
this stage of perfection natural selection could not lead."

drab color, with a black spot between the eye and beak; tail dark, the 
quills cinnamon color; beak and legs black. Azara, describing it under 
the name of Tordo pardo ro.iiso, says it is a rare bird, so that it has 
probably increased since his time, as it is now quite common in the Plata 
district. 

The Bay-wings usually go in small flocks, numbering from 10 to 30 
individuals, and are not migratory, but in winter they travel about a 
great deal from place to place without extending their journeys more 
than a few miles in any direction. They are fond of coining about 
houses, and are frequently seen pecking at the fresh meat hanging out 
of doors; and, like otlier birds of the same tribe, feed chiefly on the 
ground. They spend a great portion of their time on trees, are familiar 
with man, and inactive, and in their motions singularly slow and delib- 
erate. Their hmguage is varied. Curiosity or alarm is expressed by 
trilling notes, and before <iuitting a tree all the birds of a flock cere- 
moniously invite each other to fiy with long clear notes, powerful enough 
to be heard a (juarter of a mile away. 

They also sing a great deal m all seasons, the song being composed 
of soft, clear, rather sweet notes, variously modulated, uttered in a 
leisurely manner, and seeming to express a composed frame of mind, 
all the birds in a flock singing m concert. During the cold season the 
flock always finds some sheltered sunny spot on the north side of a 
wood pile or hedge, where they spend several hours every day, sitting 
still and singiiig in their usual quiet, soft style. 



624 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893, 

Their extreme sociability affects tlieir breeding habits, for sometimes 
the flock does not break up in spring, and several females lay in one 
nest together; but whether the birds are paired or practice a pro- 
miscuous intercourse, I have not been able to discover. They have a 
great partiality for the large domed nests made by the Aiiiimhins 
acHiicaudatus, called Leilatero in the vernacular. One summer a flock 
of about 10 Bay-wings took i^ossession of a LenaUro's nest on one of 
my trees, and after a few cays I took 14 eggs from it. Though the 
birds hopped, chirping around me, numifesting great solicitude, the 
eggs were quite cold, and had I left them many more would have been 
laid no doubt; but as they were piled up 3 or 4 deep in the nest they 
could never have been hatched. 

As a rule, however, the flock breaks up into pairs, and then a neat, 
well made nest is built in the fork of a branch, lined with horsehair; 
or, oftener still, a Lertater<>\s nest is seized, the Bay-wings fighting with 
great spirit to get i)OSsession, and in it, or on it, their own nest is made. 
Like their relations, the common Cowbird, they seem strongly attracted 
by domed nests, and yet shrink from laying in the dark interior. As a 
rule, when they have captured a Le)latrro\s nest they break a hole in 
the side and so admit the light and form an easy entrance One sum- 
mer a pair of Bay-wings attacked a Le)lafeyo\s nest on one of my trees, 
the fighting was kept up for three or four days, and then at the foot of 
the tree I found .") young LenaUros, fully fledged, which had been 
pecked to death and thiown out of the nest. 

The eggs of the Bay-wing are 5 in number, nearly round, and densely 
marked with dusky reddish brown. 

Once I observed 2 young Bay wings following a Yellow-breast, 
Fseudoleistes riresceiis, with their usual peculiar hungry cry, and while 
I watched them they were fed several times by their foster parents 
Naturally I concluded that the Bay-winged Cowbird is sometimes para 
sitical on other species, but I never saw anything afterward ^o comfirm 
nie in that belief, and I believe now that I was mistaken, and that the 
young Bay-wings were not real Bay-wings, but the young of MolutJirus 
ru/oaxUlaris.

PRIMITIVE AMERICAN ARMOR. 



By Walter Hough, Ph. D., 
Department of Ethnology, U. S. National Museum. 



" Cornelius Tacitus doth pleasantly quip and Jest at the men of war of our ancient Gaules, so armed, 
only to Tuaiutaine themselves, as thej- that have no means either to be offended or to raise them- 
selves being overtbrowne." Montaigne, Of The Parthian Amies. 

In the U. S. I^ational Museum there are many examples of primitive 
American armor. These defensive weapons may be classed as parrying 
armor, or the shield, and body armor, for the defense of the head, 
trunk, legs, and arms. The subject will be treated under form, mate- 
rial, structure, decoration, function, mythology, and distribution. 

I. Shield. 

The shield is the first defensive weapon both in point of time and of 
usefulness. While the shield on first thought may seem merely 
intended as a covering for the vulnerable points of the body, its impor- 
tance is far greater in parrying. Therefore, with this idea in view, the 
shield may be as simple as the plain parrying stick of the Australians, 
which begins the classic series of Lane Fox. 

If one bears in mind that defensive weapons are the concomitants of 
offensive weapons, the development of the shield becomes clear. Thus, 
where missile weapons are used, the i)arrying stick is a natural and 
adequate defense. Where missiles are given greater velocity with the 
throwing strap, the throwing stick, or the bow, the shield must cover 
the body better. It would seem that the broad shield is the counter- 
growth of the bow. 

The circular shield characterizes the Western Hemisphere. The 
North American shield is convex and from 12 to 26 inches in diameter. 
The Mexican area is perhai)S an exception, though the Codices almost 
invariably depict the round shield, and the surviving Mexican shields, 
on which Mrs. Zelia Nuttall is authority, are circular.* The Nahua 
shield was " sometimes rounded and sometimes oval, sometimes rounded 
on the lower side." Some shields were of an ordinary size; others were 
intended to cover the entire body and were constructed so that when 
not in use they could be folded up and carried under the arm.t Latitau 
conveys the idea that the Iroquois had shields of difterent shapes.^ 

As to material, nearly all American shields are made of thick raw- 
hide, that of the buffalo and elk being most available. Shields worked

Athamsc'ans and the similar cane shields of the Nahuas of Mexico. 

Among the Ceris and Chicoratos of New Mexico, "Another kind of

PRIMITIVE AMERICAN ARMOR. 



629 



The construction of the North Americau shield is given in detail by 
George Oatlin. The ingenious 
process of contracting and 
hardening the hide by fire was 
common. 

Sioux shield made of the skiu of 

the buffalo's iieek, hardened with 

glue extracted from the hoofs aud 

joints of the same animal. The pro- 
cess of "smoking the shield" is a 

verj' curious as well as important 

one, in their estimation. For this 

purpose a young man about to con- 
struct for him a shield digs a hole 

of 2 feet in depth in the ground, 

and as large in diameter as he 

designs to make his shield. In this 

he builds a fire, and over it, a few 

inches higher than the ground, be 

stretches the rawhide horizontally 

over the fire, with little pegs driven 

through holes made near the edges 
of the skin. The skin is at first 
twice as large as the size of the 
required shield ; but having got his 
particular and best friends (who are 
invited on this occasion) into a ring 
to dance and sing about it and solicit 
the Great Sph'it to instill into it 
the power to j)rotect him harmless 
against his enemies, he spreads over 
it the glue which is rubbed aud dried 
in, as the skin is heated; and a 
second busily drives other and other 
pegs, inside of those in the ground, 
as they are gradually giving away 
and being pulled up by the contrac- 
tion of the skin. By this curious 
process, which is most dexterously 
done, the skin is kept tight whilst 
it contracts to one-half of its size, 
taking up the glue and increasing 
in thickness until it is rendered as 
thick and hard as required (and his 
friends have pleaded long enough 
to make it arrow, and almost ball, 
proof), when the dance ceases and 
the fire is put out. When it is 
cooled and cut into the shape that 
he desires, it is often painted with 
his medicine or totem upon it, the 
figure of an eagle, an owl, a buffalo, 
or other animal, as the case may be,

tect him from harm. It is then frin<jred with

may have chosen and slung with a broad leather strap that crosses his breast. 
These shields are carried by all the warriors in these regions, for their protection 
in battles, which are almost invariably fought from their horses' backs * 

The shield was invariably held on the left arm,t usually by a simple 
thong- of buckskin attached to the interior. Wooden handles, believed 
to have belonged to Pima Indian shields, were found in a cave with 
war clubs on Superstition Mountain in Arizona, by Dr. E. Palmer. 
(Cat. No. 7C028, U. S. N. M.) 

It is the custom of most tribes to put one or more covers of dressed 
buckskin over the shield, the covers being decorated.| (See. pi. i and 

fig. 2.) 

The decoration of the North American shield forms one of the most 
fruitful sources for the religious beliefs and practices of the Indians.§ 

The decoration was inspired by a revelation through a dream, follow- 
ing among the Crows the teriible initiation ceremony and among all 
tribes following an ordeal. The protection of the shield has largely 
become fetichistic and in many cases the survival of this ancient means 
of defense has been brought about by its cult relations. 

The warrior fraternities of the Moki and Zuni tribes have an elabo- 
rate ceremonial of the shield.|| In the Moki ceremony, held at the

winter solstice by the warrior societies, the sun is represented by a 
shield, and attack and defense is graphically dramatized. The shields 
of the sun warrior fraternities are decorated with the totems of the 
individual societies. A description of this ceremony will soon be pub' 
lished by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes. 

The various feathers, hoofs and horns, and skins of animals, etc., 
hung to shields, are also personal fetiches. 

The distribution of the shield shows that most of the American 
tribes possessed the shield, and a majority appear to have had no other 
weapon of defense. There is strong presumption, however, that the 
use of body and shield armor was widespread in America, as historical 
notices show. 

Charlevoix, writing of the Iroquois, observes that while the western 
tribes use bucklers of buffalo hide, "it is pretty siu'prising that other 
Indian nations never use them."* Lafitau and the earlier mission- 
aries, however, credit the Iroquoian people with the shield in the 
following words: 

Their shields were of ozier or bark covered with one or many peaux pass^es; there 
are some made of very thick skin. They had them of all sizes and all sorts of figures. t 

Some South American tribes who use body armor are said to be 
unacquainted with the shield. Likewise the Eskimo seem to be desti- 
tute of this weapon. 

There are probably fifty American shields in the National Museum, 
some collected as early as 1830. Several have been handed down from 
father to sou for a period of sixty-five years. 

These shields are from the tribes of the western portion of the con- 
tinent and include the Crows, Sioux, Comanches, Kiowas, Navajoes, 
Utes, Apaches, Pimas, Zunis, Mokis, etc. 

II. Body Armor. 

The aboriginal armor of North America was intended to protect the 
vital organs and to allow free movement of the limbs. The form 
assumes that of a sleeveless jacket, coat, or wide band going around 
the trunk, suspended from the shoulders. The selection of defensive 
materials and their adaptation to defensive covering for the body form 
an interesting study in native invention, while the evidence in North 
America of the migration of inventions awakens no less interest. 
Thus we find that at the period of the disuse of armor by the aborig- 
ines there were six types of body armor found on the North Amer- 
ican Continent and contiguous regions, viz: 

Plate armor. — Eows of overlapping plates, perforated and lashed.

Rod armor. — Wooden rods twined together. Aleuts, Sitkans, Colum

Chinooks, Navajoes, Mohawks, Shoshones, Pawnees, Comanches, 

etc. 

Cotton-j)added armor. — Mexicans, Isthmians, and Peruvians. 

Three well-defined areas, including the above-mentioned types of 
North American body armor, will be now considered, viz: 

(1) Bering Strait area, the American shore of Bering Sea, and the 
islands as far north as Cape Prince of Wales, inhabited by the Eskimo, 
and the Asiatic side, inhabited by the Coast Chukchis. (Plate 
armor.) 

(2) Western area, extending from Sitka through northern California 
and the central basin to Mexico. (Slat, rod, and skin armor.) 

(3) EaHtern area, extending from southeastern Canada to Virginia, 
inhabited by Algonkian and Iroquoian tribes. (Slat, or rod, and skin 
armor.) 

The first two areas are known by actual specimens, while the third 
area is historical. In the interior of the continent, according to his- 
torical notices, several stocks used armor. There is, therefore, suffi- 
cient testimony to show that if not universal the use of armor was at 
least general among the North American tribes. 

1. BERING STRAIT AREA. 

The National Museum possesses a number* of examples of Eskimo- 
Chukchis plate armor from Cape Prince of Wales, Diomede Island, St. 
Lawrence Island, Alaska, and Cape Wankarem, Siberia. 

The most perfect specimens are from Cape Prince of Wales and Dio- 
mede Island. (See pis. 2 and 3.) * 

* DESCBIPTIOX OF PLATK 2. 

Fig. 1, plate armor. — Made of three rows of walrus-ivory plates, averaging 1 inch 
in width and 6 inches in length. Each plate contains 6 holes, through which pass 
rawhide thongs, thus lashing the plates together. These plates are slightly imbri- 
cated, as are also the different rows, so as to ward off more effectually the weapons 
of the enemy. The lower row contains 43 plates, and the middle 38. The upper 
row consists of two sections; one containing 10 plates, protecting the breast, the 
other 8 plates, protecting the upper part of the back. A rawhide strap passes over 
the shoulders and sup])ort8 the armor. This armor very closely resembles that of 
.lapan. Length when spread out, 44 inches. (Cat. No. 153491, U.S.N. M. Eskimo

PRIMITIVE AMERICAN ARMOR. 633 

This type of armor consists of small, flat, oblong plates of ivory or 
bone pierced near the edges with from 4 to or more boles. They are 
laslied in series with rawhide thongs passing through the holes, form- 
ing what is known as the " clove hitch." The longer edges of the 
plates are chamfered to admit of overlapping and curving the armor 
around the body; it could thus be rolled up in small compass when not 
in use. 

The coat would be formed of from 3 to 5 imbricating rows of plates 
so constructed, having offsets under the armpits and straps for the 
shoulders. Sometimes a yoke of skin fitting the neck and shoulders 
formed a support for the rows of plates, as in specimens from St. Law- 
rence Island. The coat is fastened at the back, being tied with thongs 
or having a toggle and loop. 

Iron armor plates were dug up in a marsh at Cape Prince of Wales 
(see pi. 3), and plates of iron and copper were found on St. Lawrence 
Island. 

There is an interesting statement from Lisiansky, who wrote his voy- 
ages in 1805, that the Tlingits,on the introduction of iron and firearms, 
adopted a new form of protection, consisting of a buckskin strip around 
the neck with iron plates attached pendant down the breast. 

Nordenskkjold figures a suit of armor like that of the Eskimo from 
the Chukchis.* In the Museum there are 4 plates of fossil ivory from 
the Chukchis of Cape Wankarem. 

The hoop or band armor mentioned as type 4 (pi. 4, fig. 2) is found 
only on the Siberian side of this area and, as well as the plate armor, 
recalls well-known forms in Japan. This hoop armor is interesting as 
showing the reproduction of plate armor types in skin, being made of 
horizontal bands of sealskin instead of rows of ivory i)lates, the rings 
telescoping together when the armor is not in use. This type may be 
compared with the banded mail of the Middle Ages, about which there 

dug up in a bog near where the ivory armor on this plate was found. Length of 
each plate, 41 inches; width, 1^ inches. (Cat. No. 1.53492, U.S.N.M. Eskimo of Cape 
Prince of Wales, Alaska. Collected by H. R. Thornton). 

DESCRIPTION OF PLATE 3. 

Plate armor. — Made of five imbricating rows of plates of walrus ivory of unequal 
size in the different rows, pierced with from 6 to 13 holes, lashed with sealskin thongs. 
The vertical edges of the plates are chamfered. The upper row has 40, 3 by 1|- 
inches; second row, 49 plates, 5 by 1 inch; third row, 28 plates, 3^ by If inches; 
fourth row, 31 plates, by 1^ inches; fifth row, 16 plates, 6 by 1^ inches. Two 
pointed plates cut from a tusk aie laslied to one side, forming a clasp. This armor 
was wrapped around the body after the manner of a cuirass and is said to have been 
an efficacious protection against arrows. In the form, lashing, and adjustment of 
the plates it is identical with certain types of Japanese armor. Width extended, 49 
inches; height, 24 inches. (Cat. No. 64290, U.S.N.M. Eskimo of Diomede Island, 
Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson).

lias been much discussion.* The upper portion of this war panoply 
(pi. 4,t fig. 1) is unique. 

It serves as a shield and resembles the neck fender of the Kingsmill 
Island armor; designed, without doubt, to protect the warrior from 
attack in the rear, a common occurrence in all savage warfare. 

The whole armor is very heavy and clumsy. The method of wearing 
the suit is shown in plate 5.| Captain Hooper says: 

Their war spears aud those used in huuting bears are made of steel, with a handle 
about 6 feet lonj;-. The blade is kept very sharp and h-ighly polished. These weapons 
are often beautifully iulaid with brass ornamented figures, and are purchased from 
the Russian traders at Gazhaga.^ 

The Chukchis of Plover Bay formerly wore a cuirass made of long 
strips of baleen, reaching from the neck to the middle of the thigh. 
The thickest baleen was not selected for making the armor. The 
strips were- arranged vertically, en echelon^ and tied through perfora- 
tions on the edges. Over the joints were applied other strips of 
whalebone, as in a thatch fastened by thongs, passing through perfora- 
tions at their edges and in the middle of the foundation strips. Owing 
to the material aud construction this armor was somewhat elastic. 
When spread out it was in shape of a band with cuts below the 
armpits and having suspending straps going over the shoulders, resem- 
bling the Hupa armor. (See pi. 15.) The coat was tied at the back 
with cords, requiring the assistance of another person. 

The Chukchis told my informant, Capt. E. P. Herendeen, that this

Capt. Herendeen also saw the band armor (pi. 4) among the Chukchis. 
Ivory was not observed by Capt. Herendeen, as that material is very 
scarce on the Asiatic side; but, no doubt, the materials for plate armor 
were procured by barter with 
Eskimo. In any event, fossil 
ivory plate armor was made 
by the Chukchis. 

Driftwood is also very rare 
on the Siberian coast, while 
on the islands and American 
shore it is abundant. The 
quest for this indispensable 
material must have been a 
strong incentive for the 
Asiatic migrants to cross the 
straits. 

As far as known the Chuk- 
chis did not use either hel- 
mets or shields. 

Of interest in comparison 
with the Eskimo-Chukchis 
armor is that used by the 
Giliaks of Siberia. This is 
composed of plates of iron 
lashed together (fig. 3).* 

They also wear an ingeniously constructed conical helmet with a neck 
cover. The Giliak coat of plaited thongs, figured in the same work, 
does not occur in America, but has its counterpart in the cocoanut-fibcr 
armor of the Polynesians and the plaited armor of the Malays. 

The Kamtschadales have bows, arrows, spears, and a coat of mail 
made of mats or jilaited thongs.t 

The Kalmucks have coats of mail bought from their neighbors.^: 
They use lances. 

Descending the coast toward Japan, which seems to be the origin of 
the plate armor ranging from that country into the American continent, 
we notice that the Colletske make use of a leather coat covered with 
lilates of iron about 6 inches long and a pot-shaped helmet of smaller 
plates having neck covers.

2. WESTERN AREA. 

In the western area the slat type of wooden armor seems to be cen 
tral among theKoluschans in the north, Avhile the rod type runs south- 
ward and is central among theTinne of British Columbia. 

The slat armor has some resemblances to the Eskimo coat, and might 
be regarded as the working out of the plate-armor idea in a region 
where wood is abundant and twined weaving common. 

The slat coat or coat of slats and rods combined is always made in 
two sections, one for the front and the other for the back, while the rod 
coat is in a single \nece. 

Plate 6* shows the front and back of the slat coat, and Plates 7 
and 8* show the combined rod and slat armor. These specimens 
are very old. The woodwork shows great skill, especially the inter- 
locking joinery at the edges. The hardest wood procurable was 
selected, and usually sinew cord was employed to join the slats. 
Plate J>,* taken from Niblack after Lisiansky, shows the parts and 
method of wearing the slat armor. 

* DESCRIPTIONS OF PLATES 6-9. 

Plate 6, slat armor. — Made of 32 slats of cedar aud other wood woven together 
by line weaving of line sinew and otlier cord. A baud of weaving of 3 inches width 
is carried along the front at the top and the weaving is continued, downward in two 
places, meeting a baud crossing the bottom and forming a geometrical figure. 
The middle series of slats, 8 in number, extends below the other 4 inches, 3 of which 
are intact, while 2 on either side are united, forming a swallowtail aud allowing the 
free bending of the thighs. 

The front and back are distinct, joined by elk-skin cords at the sides. A section 
of short slats, 8 in number, is placed in front of the throat, and a similar row, 7 in 
number, protects the back of the neck. The armor is held in place by a broad 
baud of elk skin over the right shoulder, aud fastened on the left side by a loop and 
thong. A toggle on the left side of the collar in front was probably for suspension 
of tlie (luiver. Height, 21^ inches; width, 20 inches. (Cat. No. 9243, U. S.N. M. 
Tliugit Indians, Sitka, Alaska. Collected by Dr. A. H. Hott", U. S. A.) 

Plates 7 and S, slat armor {back and front). — Made of slats aud rods of hard wood 
li to li inches wide, five-sixteenths inch thick, woven together by means of fine 
sinew cord so as to admit of considerable flexibility. The rods and slats are pared 
down to form channels for the reception of the cord weaving. The front and back 
portions are woven separately, being connected by cords of leather on the left side 
aud on the right side by a loop and toggle. The rods on the border of the rear of 
armor are neatly " toed in." The neck portions are made up of short slats and sewed 
on by means of a strip of rawhide 1^ inches wide. The shoulder supports are of 
very thick elk hide, the one on the right being fastened by a slash and toggle. 
Width of rear i)()rtion, 24 inches ; height, 20 inches ; width of front portion, 18 inches ; 
height, 19 inches. (Cat. No. 74437, U. S. N. M. Tlingit Indians, Sitka, Alaska.

Tlingit Helmets and Slat Armor. 



PRIMITIVE AMERICAN ARMOR. 637 

As representative of the northwestern coast culture the Tlingits and 
Haidas are most prominent. Captain Cook noticed that — 

They iucase almost the entire body in a wooden or leathern armor.. They make a 
breast plate of wood and an arrow-proof coat of thin flexible strips bonnd with 
strings like a woman's stays. They wear helmets with curiously carved visors.* 

A kind of jacket, or coat of mail, made of thin laths bound together with sinews 
which makes it quite flexible, though so close as not to admit an arrow or dart.t 

It seems, therefore, necessary to treat the Northwest Coast as one cul- 
ture area, where the arts of the ethnic units can scarcely be ditteren- 
tiated. A close study as marked out by Xiblack and shown in the care- 
ful collections of Lieut. G. T. Emmons, U. S. Navy, may disentangle 
the borrowings of the stocks of this area. 

There are 4 suits of this type in the Museo Arqueologico in Madrid. 
'J hey were collected by the Malespina Expedition of 1791. The exact 
locality is not stated and an account of Malespina's exploration was 
not published, as far as I can learn. 

If one may judge by the Spanish names which have remained on the 
map, such as Malespina Island, CapeMuzou, Cordova Bay, and others, 
the Malespina Expedition explored the north side of Dixon Entrance 
and came in contact with the Haidas as well as the Tlingits. Although 
there is some probability of these armors being Haidan, I incline to 
believe them to beTliiigit. 

During the course of this study, one piece of armor of unknown 
function in the National collection was found to be a greave, or armor 
for the lower leg (pi. 10). f This unique piece discloses the hitherto 
unnoticed fact that the Northwest Coast warriors were more completely 
armed than had been imagined. This greave leads to the inference 
that a similar protection was extended to the upper legs and the arms. 
With heavy wooden helmet, the slat coat and armor for the limbs, we 
have a picture of an Alaskan warrior armed cap-a-pie. In no way was 
this armor inferior to that employed in ancient or feudal times or at a 
late period among the Japanese. The resemblance of the specimen in 
question to the Japanese greave is striking. 

It is made up of 12 slightly tapering hard wood slats and 8 rods 
woven together with sinew cord. The portion not covered with 
weaving bears a totemic painting. When curved around the leg,

t Description of Plate 10. — Greave made up of 12 slightly tapering hard wood slate 
and 8 rods woven together with twisted sinew cord. The weaving is diversified in 
the central portion by carrying the threads in pairs alternately over the rods. The 
portion not covered with weaving bears a totemic painting. When the greave is 
curved around the calf of the leg, the hollowed out portions, which are also beveled, 
accommodate the instep and knee joint. Tied at the front with thongs. The holes 
along the upper edge are probably for attaching the greave to the armor for the 
upper leg. Length, 15 inches ; width of upper edge, 17+ inches ; width of lower edge, 
16i inches. (Cat. No. 74438, U. S. N. M. Tlingit Indians, Alaska. Collected by J. J. 
McLean. 



€38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

tlie hollowed oat portions accommodate the instep and knee joint. It 
was secured by thongs and probably with a band or garter. The holes 
along the upper edge are probably for attaching the greave to the 
cuissard. 

Charlevoix, in speaking of the Iroquois, says : 

Tbey had even formerly a kind of mail for the arms and thighs made of the same 
material,* i. e., small pliable sticks pretty well wrought.! 

The resemblance between the culture of the west and east coasts of 
North America is striking in other instances. 

Many of the figures in the Mexican codices and sculptures wear a 
covering around the calf of the leg, which may be the greave. In the 
sculptures from Yucatan this greave or legging seems to be of horizontal 
bands and square plates. 

The rod type of armor of the western area is well represented by 
specimens in the National Museum. All the examples extant range 
from Sitka to northern California in a region comparatively lately 
■explored. 

The rod and slat types are mixed; in the method of twining together 
the elements they are identical. In some localities the broad band of 
rods is alone found, while among the Tlingits, or around Sitka, occur 
rod armor, slat armor, and a combination of both types in the same 
piece, as well as skin armor. 

In form the Aleut armor, instead of following the Eskimo type, 
belongs with the rod type of the Indians. The perforation of the 
rods, however, and the method of lashing, show Eskimo handiwork. 
D'Orbigny says : ^'Les amies defensives consistaient en une cotte de 
joncs tresses qui leur couvrait tout le corps." | 

Dr. W. H. Dall, during his exploration of the caves of the Aleutian 
Islands, found the armor figured in pis. 11 and 12.§ " Under the

Plate 11, rod armor. — Made up of two series of cedar rods, one-half inch in diame- 
ter and different lengths, painted red. The lower series containing 68 rods; the 
upper series, two side sections of 10 rods and a curved piece each, and a central sec- 
tion containing 22 rods with curved side pieces. The rods are perforated through 
either end and held in series by a sewing of finely plaited sinew cord, the cord being 
brought through the hole in the first rod, leaving two long ends. These are brought 
past each other froni opposite sides through the hole in the next I'od, and so forth. 
The sections are joined by a rickrack lashing, engaging with the horizontal sewing. 
The rods are perforated from side to aide and a thin rod of whalebone drawn 
through, rendering the armor llexible. At the lower and upper edges of the armor 
the ends of the rods are chamfered. There are two wooden toggles on the right side.

carved wooden pieces about the arraholes. This is the only piece of

Eod armor. — Composed of 72 jieeled rods of uniform length and diameter, held in 
vertical series by alternate bands of weaving of woolen and sinew cord. The rods 
are bunched in the middle of the band. The ends of the rods are neatly hollowed 
out, forming cup cavities, and there are 4 equidistant vertical bands of red paint. 
This band was probably worn with a skin coat, both specimens having been secured 
from the same native. There appears to be no device to prevent the rod band slip- 
ping down. Width, 30 inches ; height, 23.V inches. (Cat. No. 168158, U.S.N.M. Taku

U represent the part of one cord, and 2a and 26 represent those of another. The 
view represents the upper left-hand corner of the weaving and two upper threads, 
showing 7 rods in both plan and section. As stated, this method of running the 
cords or twine is varied by occasionally running them in pairs. * 

Bands of rods of this character are intended to be worn under or 
over the skin armor, encircling the body below the armpits, and there 
are no shoulder straps to prevent the armor slipping down over the hips. 

To the southward the rod band assumes a more effective form. It is 
cut out for the arms and has shoulder straps. Just where this form 
begins it is not possible to say with exactness, probably witli the 
Tinne. The specimens are from the Shastas, Hupas, and Klamaths of 
Oregon and California (pis. 14 and 15). t 

The following references may be of interest:

The Chinooks wear "a kind of vest, made of small round sticks of 
the size and shape of arrows 12 inches long; they are laid side by side, 
and then sewed together and fixed on the body like a waistcoat."§

with cord made of human hair. Short rods are worked in below the armpits. All 
the rods are split at either end, the finishing cords drawn into the split to secure 
the weaving. In addition the armor is bound on the upper and lower edges with 
skin sewed with sinew. The shoulder straps are of otter ( ?) fur. The surface of the

PRIMITIVE AMERICAN ARMOR. 641 

Among tlie Hupas " there is another kind of armor made of wattles 
and twine, woven and bound with buckskin. This is worn in battle 
to protect the body; it is tied across the breast from left to right. The 
red lines denote the number of enemies slain or captives taken; also 
the rank of the wearer. This class of armor was in common use among- 
the Natano and Kenuck Indians before the introduction of firearms^ 
but it is now nearly obsolete."* 

The rod coats were put on like a vest and were tied in front. The 
rear i^ortion, being- a little longer, protected the back of the neck. 

On the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains and on the Great Plains 
the natural defensive i)rotection of the great land and sea mammals, 
transferred by man to his own body, becomes, in turn, his efticient armor. 

The skins of the elk and moose on the northwest coast and the bison 
in the interior to the south furnish excellent material for defensive 
clothing. These skins are invariably tanned to render them flexible, 
and are often coated with glue and sand over certain portions. 

Father Morice, in his clear description of the process, says : 

Another sort of armor, indigenous to the Dene nation, was tbe peoesta (wheveiu 
one sits). Tliis h^.d the form of a sleeveless tunic falling to the knees, so that ifc 
afforded protection to the whole body save the bead — in hard tights the D(^ues invari- 
ably sbot kneeling. The armor or cuirass was of moose skin, which, when sewed 
according to tbe proper pattern, was soaked in water, then repeatedly rubbed on tbe 
sandy sbores of a stream or lake and dried with the sand and small pebbles adhering 
thei'eto, after whicb it was thoroughly coated witb a species of very tenacious glue, 
the principal ingredient of which was boiled isinglass, obtained from the sturgeon. 
Being again, before drying, subjected to a thorough rubbing over sand, it received a 
new coating of the aforesaid glue. When this process had been repeated three or four 
times, it formed an armor perfectly invulnerable to arrows over the parts which were 
thus protected.! 

The skin coats were always made in one piece folded over, sewed above 
the shoulders, leavingan orifice for the head and with a hole cut out of the 
left side for the left arm, the right side of the garment remaining open. 
The skin was often doubled, but more freciuently the coat was reinforced 
with pieces of thick hide. Sometimes shoulder guards were added. 

It will be seen that the leather coats from Sitka are short and follow 
the tyi)e of slat armor. This will be noticed in the "swallowtail" for 
the protection of the pubic region, or which assumes this shape by the 
cutting away of portions of the skirt over the groins (pis. 16 and 17). f 

Sometimes a slash was made over the thigh and in front of the thix)at.

The shoulder guards were worked out of the hide at the left arm- 
hole or added over one or both shoulders. On the front are one or two 
loops of buckskin, probably for the attachment of the bow and quiver 
or dagger. 

On the right side the armor was usually fringed, and m some cases 
a band of lighter skin was sewed along the same side. This baud was 
often decorated.

tanned, lined inside with another piece sewed around the lower portion. Ample 
cuts for arm holes. Over the left shoulder is fastened an epaiiliere, made of a heavy 
piece of folded hide. For convenience in putting on or off the armor, the baud over 
the right shoulder is buttoned over a wooden toggle. Fastened with thongs on the 
right side. Two loops in front are probably for the bow. Width, 20|^ inches ; height, 
29 inches. (Cat. No. 60240, U.S.N.M. Tlingit Indians, Alaska. Collected by J. J.

* DESCRIPTION OF PLATES 18 AND 19. 

Plate IS, Fig. 1, skin armor. — Front view. Made of very heavy hide, with cor- 
rugated appearance, single thickness. A strip of lighter leather, cut from a 
painted garment, has been sewed to the left side. A double shoulder protector has 
been sewed to the left side of the neck opening, and the skin has been cut and 
enlarged by gussets to protect the right shoulder. A slit cut in the skirt of the coat 
admits of free movemeut of the knee. The fringe is wrapped with strips of grass, 
tied, by thongs, on the left side. 

Fig. 2, skin armor. — Rear view of armor. Curiously, this armor must have been 
■worn by a left-handed man, as it is put on in the reverse of the other coats described. 
Width, 30 inches ; height, 37A inches. (Cat. No. 130588, U.S.N.M. Alaska. Lent by 
Max B. Richardson.) 

Plate 10, Fig. 1, skin armor. — Made of tanned caribou skin folded in the usual way 
ami reinforced. Fringed on the right side. The coat is longer than those worn to the 
North. The leather has apparently been stiffened with glue. The feature of this 
coat is that two very heavy pieces of hide go over the shoulders and form a slit in 
front of the neck. The buckskin loops in front are for the attachment of the quiver. 
Width, 32 inches; height, 37 inches. (Cat. No. 46464, U.S.N.M. Chilcat Indians, 
Alaska. Collected by Dr. T. H. Bean.) 

Fig. 2, skin armor. — Made of thick tanned elk or moose skin folded twice into 
oblong form like a sheet of note paper. Sewed over the shoulders and strengthened 
inside by hinge pieces. Open along right side the edges cut into coarse fringe. A 
short slit down left side below the shoulder leaves a passage for the left arm. 
About midway near the right side is fastened a wooden toggle, by which, probably, 
was suspended the dagger. The front of the coat is discolored and dented as though 
an attempt had been made to render the leather more dense by hammering. The 
leather has perhaps also been treated with glue, as described by Father Morice among

PRIMITIVE AMERICAN ARMOR. 643 

The long- coat culminates among the Hupas and Klamaths, although 
some Alaskan tribes Nvore long- coats identical with the ceremonial 
coats (pi. 20).* 

Two modern armors from Sitka, in form of a waistcoat, are curious. 
Both open in front and are fastened by lappets and brass buttons of 
English manutacture. One is plated over the entire front and a por- 
tion of the back with Chinese coins, like the penny armor of Europe; 
the other is plain. The derivation of these coins is not known, but the 
collector supposes the work to be that of Chukchis. These are cur- 
rent Chinese coins like those brought to this country by the Chinese 
to be used in gambling. There are a few Japanese coins on this coat. 
The armor was collected in 1870 (pi. 21). f 

Decoration of the war armor was infrequent. The fringe has been 
mentioned. Applied bands of quill work on leather fringe have been 
observed. The slat armor often bore totemic devices, and the rod 
armor was diversified by bands of weaving of different colored cords 
or by painted bands. In the interior of two coats from southern 
Alaska (Takus and Tlingits) are elaborate colored totemic paintings. 
Since the painting is not seen, it can not be for ornament. Perhaps it 
is a fetichistic protection.

the national collection are of problematic purpose. They were sent m 
as armor by the collector, and from the thickness, weight, and other 
points are evidently defensive. There is, however, no armhole on the 
left side nor projection for the shoulder. In one suit the neck opening 

is large and is surrounded with a 
leather-covered collar made of short 
Avooden slats, slightly interlocking, 
held together with a cord twining. 
In the other suit the collar is of 
hide (pi. 22).* 

If these objects are defensive they 
could scarcely be used by a man on 
all fours for stalking, as they are 
too wide and long, and the arms 
would be completely hampered. 
They would be most useful as armor 
for some animal. While one tribe-at 
least (the Shoshones of the Upper 
Missouri) is known to have protected 
their horses with armor,! the North- 
west Coast tribes did not have 
horses. A further suggestion is 
that they were ceremonial. 

These objects are noticed here 
with the view of ascertaining their 
functi<jn. 

Padded armor, which was used 
in Mexico and Central America, is 
the remaining type. No specimens 
of Mexican padded armor are extant. 
In some of the sculptures quilted 
armor is perhaps represented by a 
groundwork of small squares. A 
search of the codices and an examina- 
tion of the sculptures will doubtless throw m uch light upon this subject.

PRIMITIVE AMERICAN ARMOR. 645 

Padded armor has beeu of widespread adoption. In Mongolian 
conntries it survived to a recent date. Tlie Korean armor (fig. 5*) 
will give an idea of this type. 

Prescott says, in reference to the Peruvian armor: 

Men's bodies were protected by casques made either of wood or the slcins of wild 
animals, and sometimes richly decorated with metal and with precious stones sur- 
mounted by the brilliant plumage of the tropical birds. * * * Men's defensive 
armor consisted of a shield, or buckler, and a close tunic of quilted cotton, in the 
same manuer as with the Mexicans.! 

Probably not very different from the cuirass of hide of the northern 
tribes. 

Hansard tells us the Spaniards invented felt covering for their horses 
as a protection against Floridan arrows. | He also states that — 

The Spaniards, who fight on horseback with the Indians of those provinces, carry 
a doublet well lineil with cotton wool. ^ 

It may be surmised that the Simniards introduced this style of 
armor both into Mexico and Peru. 
Dr. Brin ton, in his "American Kace," says of the Tarascos of Michoacan : 

Nowhere else do we find such complete defensive armor. It consisted of helmet, 
body pieces, and greaves for the legs and arms, all of wood, covered neatly with 
copper or gold plates, so well done that the jiieces looked as if they were of solid 
metal. 

The following excerpts, arranged geographically, describing armor 
from other tribes not represented by extant specimens, are introduced 
here to show the range of armor in America. 

The Nass Indians of the Tsimsbiau stock follow the other stocks on 
the Nortliwest Coast in that — 

Their war garments were formed of 2, 3, or more folds of the strongest hides of 
the land animals they were able to procure. In the center was a hole sufiicient to 
admit the head and left arm to pass through, the mode of wearing them being over 
the right shoulder and under the left arm. The left side of the garment is sewed 
up, but the right side remains open ; the body is, however, tolerably well protected, 



* This consists of a coat, helmet, and wide belt made up of many thicknesses of 
coarse cotton cloth covered with yellow stuft'. The coat is made up of two wide 
flaps connected by a band which passes over the left shoulder. These flajjs are cut 
out to fit the neck, and are tied at either side. A plastron of cloth is hung over the 
chest. The surface of portions of the coat is printed with Sanscrit dharani, or 
prayers for victory. A belt resembling those worn by Korean women at the present 
time, but much thicker, is tied around the waist. The helmet is padded, and is 
stili'ened by four perpendicular bands of iron riveted through the cloth and termi- 
nating in a brass ball at the apex. Visor, small; wide and heavy d^paules, one at 
either side at the back. The helmet has also Sanscrit dharani written upon it. 
Length ol coat, 34 inches; width, 30 inches; length of belt, 54 inches; width, 11 
inches; height of helmet, 12 inches. (Cat. No. 128344 U. S. N. M. Korea. Deposited

and both arms are left at liberty for action. As a farther security, on the part which 
covers the breast they sometimes fix on the inside thin laths of wood.* 

On Vancouver Island the Nootkas make use of— 

A thick tanned leather mantle, doubled, and appears to be the skin of an elk or 
buffalo. This is so contrived as to cover the breast quite up to the throat, part of it 
falling down to the heels. This garment is sometimes very curiously painted, and 
is not only strong enough to resist, but, as we understand from them, spears could 
not penetrate it. So it may be considered their complete defensive armor, t 

The Cliiuooks of the Oohimbia River use skin and rod armor. Eoss 
says, in reference to the former, their war garments are of two kinds; 
one is termed denial, of elk skin, dressed and worked to the thickness 
of nearly half an inch, and arrow proof. The denial nearly covers the 
whole body, with an opening" left on the right side to allow the arm free 
action in combat. (Ross, Alex., Advent., etc., on the Oregon or Colum- 
bia River. Lond., 1849, i3. 89.) 

Franchere says of the Columbian River tribes: 

For defensive armor they wear a cassock or tunic of elk skin, double, descending 
to the ankles, with holes for the arms. It is impenetrable for their arrows, which 
can not pierce two thicknesses of leather; and as their heads are also covered with 
a sort of helmet, the neck is almost the only part in which they can be wounded. 
They have another kind of corselet made like the corsets of our ladies, of splinters 
of hard wood interlaced with nettle twine. The warriors who wear this curious 
dress do not use the tunic of elk skin. He is consequently less protected, but a good 
deal more free, the said tunic being very heavy and very stiff. t 

Passing eastward, Lewis and Clarke, when speaking of the Shoshoni 
of the Rocky Mountains, at the head of the Missouri River, remark : 

They have a kind of armor, something like a coat of mail, which is formed by a 
great many folds of dressed antelope skins, united by means of a mixture of glue 
and sand. With this they cover their own bodies and those of their horses, and find 
it imjiervious to the arrow. § 

Mr. Dorsey informs me that there is reason to believe that the Pawni 
formerly employed a kind of hide cuirass and a defensive helmet, and 
as Da Pratz states that the Padoucas (Comanches) "cover their horses 
with dressed leather (probably bison hide), hanging down quite round, 
which secures them from darts," it is perhaps permissible to infer that 
their riders were protected in the same way. 

In that wonderful origin-epic of the Navajoes the Indian singer chants 
to Dr. Matthews of " suits of armor made of several layers of buckskin. 
The warriors in those days wore such armor, but they wear it no 
longer." ||

PRIMITIVE AMERICAN ARMOR. 647 

Among the Pueblo tribes "they also wore cuirasses of elk or bison 
skin, or of padded cotton and yucca, and carried round shields of 
basketry of heavily and closely netted cotton, or of thick rawhide, 
symbolically painted." * 

Coming- to the great civilizations of ancient Mexico, Bancroft says of 
the Xahua Iiidians of Mexico : 

The chimalli, or Mexican shield, was made of various materials and of divers 
forms, sometimes rounded and sometimes oval; sometimes rounded on the lower side. 
It was commonly constructed of flexible bamboo canes bound firmly together and 
covered with hide. The face of the shield was ornamented according to the rank 
and taste of the wearer; that of a noble was generally covered with thin plates of 
gold, with a heavy boss in the center. In Tabasco and along the coast tortoise shells 
inlaid with gold, silver, or copper were commonly used as shields. Reeds, grass, hides, 
or 'nequen cloth, coated with India rubber, served to protect an Aztec common soldier. 
Some shields were of an ordinary size; others were intended to cover the entire body, 
and were c*istrncted so that when not in use they could be folded up and carried 
under the arm. The body armor of the nobles and higher grades of warriors con- 
sisted of a breastplate made of quilted cotton, one or two fingers in thickness, called 
"ichcahuipilli." Over this was a thick cotton coat which covered part of the arms 
and thighs, made in one piece, fastened behind and decorated with feathers of the 
color of the company's uniform. The cotton armor was completely arrow proof. 
Arm and leg guards made of wood, covered with leather or gold plates and trimmed 
with feathers, and of the same material, shaped and painted to represent the head of 
a tiger, serpent, or monster with mouth open and teeth bared, complete the 
defensive armor. t 

Again, in treating of theToltecs, Yeytia relates: 

The body armor worn by the principal warriors was made of double cloth padded 
with cotton. It difl^ered from that of the Aztecs, reaching down the ankles, and was 
worn over a thin white tunic. The private soldier painted the upper part of the 
body to represent armor, but from the waist to the thighs they wore short drawers, 
and over them fastened around the waist a kind of kilt that reached to the knee, 
and availed them somewhat for defense. Across the body was a sash made of 
feathers that passed from the right shoulder to the left side of the waist, t 

Cotton-padded armor seems to have been the principal type used in 
Mexico. Among the Mayas of Mexico — 

In addition to shields the Mayas had for defensive armor garments of thickly- 
quilted cotton, called escawpiles, which covered the body down to the lower part of 
the thigh, and wei-e considered impervious to arrows.^ 

There are a few references among the Isthmian tribes of the use of 
armor where the skin and rod types persist. Gabb says that the Bri 
Bris and Tiribis, Costa Rica, use " an iron-headed lance with shaft 
barely 4 feet long. Round shields were carried on the arm, made of 
the thickest part of the hide of the tapir." ||

The Mosquito Indians of Honduras also employed armor. Bancroft 
says: 

Armor is made of plaited reeds covered with tiger skins aud ornameuted with 
feathers; besides this they employ a breastplate of twisted cotton.* 

Entering- tbe continent of South America we find that — 

The Abipoues are unacquainted with shields and targets, but they cover greatest 
part of their bodies with a sort of defense made of an undressed anta's hide, a tiger 
skin being sewed either in the in or outside; it is open in the middle, that the head 
may come through, and extended on each side iis far as the elbows and middle; it is 
impenetrable to common arrows, but not to spears and bullets. t 

In the vast continent of South America there are only scattering 
references to the use of armor. In the southern extremity, where the 
phase of life assumes a resemblance to that of our North American 
tribes, we find well-known forms of armor. The cavalry of the Arau- 
canians is "armed with swords and lances; formerly used bows and 
slings. The soldiers are not clothed in uniform, according to the 
European custom, but all wear beneath their usual dress cuirasses of 
leather, hardened by a i)eculiar mode of dressing; their shields and 
helmets are also made of the same material."! 

The Patagonians also wear a helmet with coat of mail, made of sev- 
eral folds of hide, and have a shield of bull's hide for use on foot.§ 
Their weapons are bows, lances, bolas, and clubs. 

3. EASTERN AREA. 

There is sufficient historical evidence that the defensive weapons of 
the east coast were similar to those of the west coast. The lakes and 
rivers with short portages rendered communication easy across this 
vast distance, and points out a great line of migration both of peoples 
and inventions. This is shown by the following reference: 

Some sixty or seventy years ago a party of Iroquois, having crossed the Rocky 
Mountains, reached L. Tathaiu two wooden canoes, which at once excited the covet- 
ousness of a band of Carriers, who killed the strangers for the sake of their canoes. 
These having been brought here (Stuart's Lake) served as models for the building of 
the first home-made "dugouts." |I 

On the Atlantic slope there is abundant evidence to show that the 
Iroquois used body armor. Cartier (Hakluyt Voy.,Vol. in, London, 
1810), speaking of the Toudamani (Iroquois, probably Onondaga and 
Seneca) says: 

Also they showed us the manner and making of their armor; they are made of 
cordes and wood, finely and cunningly wrought together.

PRIMITIVE AMERICAN ARMOR. 649 

Lafitau, whose famous work "Moeurs des Sauvages Ameriquains," 
was published in 1724, gives a more detailed account of the defensive 
armor of the tribes of the northeastern part of the present United States 
and of Canada, probably referring chiefly to the Iroquois and Huron, 
with whom he was most faujiliar. He says (Vol. ii, p. 107) : 

Their cuirasses were a tissue of wood, or of small sticks of reed cut of proportionate 
lengths, strongly pressed against each other, woven and enlaced very neatly with 
small cords made of deer skin. They had cuissards and brassards (defensive cover- 
ings for the thighs and arms) of the same material. These cuirasses were proof 
against arrows armed with bone or stone, but not against those mounted with iron. 

Charlevoix says of the Iroquois : 

Most had no defensive weapon, but when they attacked any intrenchmeut, they 
covered their wh(de body with small, light boards. Some have a sort of cuirass or 
breastplate of small, pliable rings, very neatly worked. They had even formerly a 
kind of mail for the arms and thighs, made of the same materials. But as this kind 
of armor was found not to be proof against firearms, they have renounced them 
without putting anything in their place.* 

Sagard says that the Hurons (Iroquois) had armor made of wood.t 
Champlain also describes the Iroquois' armor as made of wood and 
thread.l A plate in the same volume shows a warrior in armor. Wooden 
breastplates were worn.§ Copper breastplates have been found, like 
the gold breastplates of Peru.|| One has been described as a plate of 
rich copper, in length a foot, in width half a foot, for a breastplate. 1] 
Lucian Carr thinks these breastplates were for ornament, like those 
found in the Ohio mounds. The size of the New England breastplates, 
however, would render them a tolerable protection if used as a i^lastron- 

The only reference to eastern skin armor is of the Mohawks, who 
" wear sea horse skins and barks of trees made by their art as impene- 
trable, it is thought, as steel, wearing a headpiece of the same."** 

In reference to the Virginia Indians, Hariot says: 

They are a people clothed with loose mantles made of Deere skms, and aprons of 
the same rounde about their middles; all e^se naked; of such a dift'erence of statures 
only as wee in England; having no edge tooles or weapons of yron or Steele to ofteud 
us withall, neither know they how to make any: those weapos that they have are 
onlie bowes made of Witch hazle, and arrowes of reeds; flat edged truncheons also 
of wood about a yard long, neither have they any thing to defend themselves but 
targets made of barcks; and some armours made of stickes wickered together with 
thread, ft

650 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

I have not met with accounts of armor among the southern tribes, as 
the Muskoki group and others, but should hesitate to conclude that the 
idea of a defense for the body against arrows and spears, other than 
the shields, had not occurred to these progressive tribes. 

As a rule, the helmet is the most striking and prominent portion of 
body armor. 

War bonnets and various head coverings of the American aborigines, 
in many cases, may be classed with helmets. The function of the hel- 
met, after protection, is to adorn the head, but an almost constant fea- 
ture is that of inspiring fear by grotesque or horrid construction. Thus 
the helmet is connected with the mask. 

There is a large series of Northwest Coast helmets in the National 
Museum. (See pi. 0.) They are always of wood, fitting the head, 
carved above to represent animals, grotesque faces, etc., always painted 
and sometimes carved with a rim like a hat. There is in the collection 
one helmet of wood covered with leather. Another fine helmet (Cat. No. 
168157) from the Taku Indiaus of southeru Alaska is carved from solid 
wood in form of the Japanese type, called Kabuto or pot helmet. The 
front is finely worked out into the form of a grotesque face, with deep 
furrows across the nose, cheeks, and forehead, like New Zealand tattoo- 
ing, and painted green, red, and black. The ears at the side of the mask 
are accurately executed. The mask projects above the crown of the 
helmet and the upper ridge is studded with wooden pegs, which once 
held a fringe of sea-lion whiskers or bristles. Pegs are also seen on the 
chin and lips. The rear and rim of the helmet bear a totemic-painted 
carving in low relief. 

Through the inner edge of the rim of the helmet four slanting holes 
have been bored. These were probably for the passage of thongs 
which held a mask- visor before the face. 

Visors were worn, carved to represent a face, or bowed visors ingen- 
iously made by cutting deep scarfs in the wood, allowing it to bend- 
On the interior of this style of visor was a projecting grommet which 
was taken between the teeth, holding the visor in place. Other mask- 
like visors were suspended from the helmet with cords and a couvre de 
nuqne was often attached to the back. 

The only other survival of helmets in North America is among the 
Pueblo Indians, where they appear in ceremonies, in the form of mask 
helmets. 

A few historical notices have been given of the helmets used by the 
eastern Indians. 

A summary of the main conclusions which may be drawn from the 
foregoing paper will show : 

(1) That a majority of the American tribes had advanced to the stage 
where they made use of body armor — that is, were sedentary tribes. 

(2) This also implies differentiation of weapons rendering armor 
necessary, or the migration of the invention, or independent inventioiu 



PRIMITIVE AMERICAN ARMOR. 651 

The coat of thick skin which has appeared at all times and places- 
may have arisen independently, following the prime idea of the con- 
comitance of weai)on and autiweapon, but — 

(3) Plate armor in America is a clear case of the migration of inven- 
tion, its congeners having been traced from Japan northeastward 
through the Ainos, Giliaks, and Chukchis, across Bering Strait by the 
intervening islands to the western Eskimo. Here the armor spread 
southward from the narrowest part of the strait, passing into the slat 
armor of the Northwest Coast, which is possibly a development of the 
plate idea. The plate armor also may have spread to the eastern coast 
of l!^orth America. Hence it appears to be conclusive that plate armor 
in America had Asiatic origin. The date of this introduction is not 
considered.

THE WEAPONS AND WINGS OF BIRDS. 



By Fkedekic A. Lucas, 
Curator, Department of Comparative Anatomy, U. S. National Museum. 



A more accurate, if not a better, title for this article would perhaps 
be " Some weapons of birds, " for the weapons to be considered are 
mainly such as are very evidently designed for ofteiisive i:>urposes, and 
a peaceably disposed bird might very well disi^ense with. 

This paj)er does not treat of the beaks, claws, and ordinary spurs of 
birds, not only because they are pretty well known, but because peculiar 
modifications of bills and claws usually have more to do with preserv- 
ing than destroying life, being related to some peculiarity of food or 
feeding. 

The toothed beak of the falcon has, of course, a double purpose: to 
preserve the life of the falcon by destroying that of its prey, aiid the 
same is true of the spear-like bill of the heron, but the curious, crossed 
mandibles of the crossbill, the bent beak of the crook-billed jdover, and 
the open bill of Anastomiis all have to do with the mere procuring of 
food. Neither will we say anything of the ostrich, cassowary, and other 
big birds which strike with their feet, for although the feet are formi- 
dable Aveapons, they are designed rather for running than for fighting, 
except in the case of the cassowary, whose long, straight, sharp inner 
toe can inflict a serious wound. Leaving out all these birds, we are 
practically restricted to such as carry their weapons on their wings, and 
not only fight " tooth and claw," but buffet an adversary abont the head, 
and have their spurs where they seem best adapted to do mischief. 
Rather strangely, it does not appear that birds with wing spurs are any 
more combative than those without, for, while the jacanas are said to 
fight well, Hudson, who studied them long and carefully, describes them 
as noisy birds, more given to scolding than to actual fighting.* Neither 
are the spur-winged plovers, which are also querulous and vociferous, 
said tobe particularly pugnacious, although Gould says that io^iraweZto 
personatus uses its wing spur with good effect to repulse the attacks of 
birds of prey.t By no means all birds which fight with their wings 
have spurs upon them. The swan has none, audyet beis a famous fighter, 
and can deliver a tremendous blow, although the force and effect of a 
stroke of his pinions have undoubtedly been much exaggerated.

656 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1«93. 

The common pigeon is anotlier bird which nses its wings with good 
efi'ect, and althongh the dove is lield np as the type of gentleness, there 
are few birds of more quarrelsome disposition, and more given to pick- 
ing upon their weaker neighbors. The company manners of thepigeon 
are unobjectionable, and the members of a flock will tly irnd feed abroad 
in harmony, but, once within the shelter of their own loft, woe betide 
the bird which dares put foot on his neighbor's territory, for he will be 
set uj)on and cuffed without mercy. 

The pigeon, too, is a skilled boxer, feinting and guarding with one 
wing and striking with the other, the blow being delivered by the wing 
farthest from his opponent, the intention being that the wrist, which 
is the most effective part of the wing for striking a blow, shall strike 
the adversary about the head. While this mode of combat is not 
peculiar to pigeons, it is eminently characteristic of the group, so that 
they may be called pugnacious in the strictest sense of the term; the 
Latin verb j>«y/ho meaning sjiecially to tight with blows of the fist, or, 
as we say, to come to fisticuffs. 

Pigeons, according to our ideas, do not fight quite fairly, and if they 
have no positive spur upon their wings, they certainly come very near 
it. If one will carefully part the feathers on the outer edge of a 
pigeon's wing near the bend, commonly called shoulder, but really the 
wrist, he will find a small bare spot and a blunt, well-marked promi- 
nence, often covered with integument so thick and hard that it can 
almost be called horn. In some wild pigeons this tubercle or boss is 
well developed, especially in the curious Samoan DidunciiJns, while at 
least one extinct species was provided with a sort of natural slung- 
shot that must have added not a little to the effectiveness of a blow. 
This bird was the fat and flightless Solitaire, of Rodriguez, a near 
relative of the dodo, and, like it, a great, ungainly, aberrant member 
of the pigeon family, taller than a turkey. 

All that we know about the Solitaire has been gathered from the 
journal of Francois Leguat, who tells us that, while the birds were 
nesting, they would not sufl'er any other bird of the same species to 
approach within 200 yards of the jilace. He writes — 

But what is singular the male will uever drive away the females, only when he 
perceives one he makes a noise with his wings to call the female, and she drives the 
unwelcome stranger away, not leaving it till it is without her bounds. The female 
does the same to the males and he drives them away. The combats between them 
on this occasion last sometimrs pretty long, because the stranger only turns about 
and does not tly directly from the nest. 

Leguat says, furthermore, that ''the bone of their wing grows greater 
toward the extremity and forms a little round mass under the feathers 
as big as a musket ball. That and its beak are the chief defense of 
this bird." 

"As big as a musket ball " very aptly describes the swollen bone at the 
base of the metacarpus (fig. 1), and this, swung by the short, stout little

wing, must have beeu capable of hitting a pretty liard blow, even if, as 
is probable, it was surrounded by thick, callous skin. The outer end 
of the forearm (radius) is also rough and swollen, and it looks very 
much as if this enlargement of the bone had originally been brought 
about by the solitaire's combative habits, the wrist joint having beeu 
banged and bruised until that diseased outgrowth known as exostosis

took place, and tinally became a constant character of the bird. Dr. 
Weismann might object to this, but to a Xeo-Lamarckian the thing 
seems quite i)lausible. 

The true game birds, fowls and pheasants, which have spurs on their 
legs, have none on their wings, although, as everyone knows who has 
seen a quarrel in the barnyard, they use their wings in fighting. Some 
of their Australian cousins, however, the mound-builders, or megapodes, 
which have no leg S])urs, have blunt tubercles on their wings, very much 
like those found among pigeons. 

Although the swan, as we have seen, has no wing spurs and trusts 
to the sheer force of its wing stroke, some of its near relatives, the

African Spur-winged Geese {Plccfropteri), have a very peculiarly armed 
pinion. The peculiarity lies in the fact that while in most spur- winged 
birds the spur does not occur n\)on the wrist itself, but upon the meta- 
carpus, or next row of bones, in the Spur-winged (loose (fig. 2) that 
one of the wrist bones known as the radiale projects quite beyond the 
other bones and is capped with a sharp spur. 

The majority of spur- winged birds are plovers, nearly related to the 
common Lapwing, Vanellus cristatKs, and ])laced by different system- 
atists in various genera and subgenera named from tlieir spurs or the

face wattles which occur xu some si>ecies, Hojdopterus, Belonoptems, 
Lohi vanel Ins, and Sarciopliorus. A curious fact about the wattled species 
is that there is a direct relation between the size of the wattles and 
the size of the spurs (fig. 3); when the spur is long the wattles are 
large, and when the spur is short the wattles are small. There is also 
in those species where the spur is small-an increase in its size during the 
breeding season, so that it then becomes fully available as a weapon.* 

There are no wattled lapwings in the l!Tew World, and only one 
species straggles northward beyond the latitude of the Himalayas. 
Africa, south of the Sahara claims half a dozen species, while seven

more are found between southern Asia and New Zealand. Spur- winged 
plovers without wattles occur in South America, Africa, and parts of 
Asia, but none come from Australia. A small and quarrelsome species 
[HopJopterus.spinosus) belonging to this latter group is very abundant 
in northeastern Africa, and its restless habits — for night and day it is 
continually on the move — are explained by the Arab tradition that on 
account of former laziness it was condemned to live in a state of 
perpetual unrest. 

The largest and finest of the South American spurred plovers is 
BelonopieruH chiJensis (fig. 4), a species ranging southwards to Patago- 
nia, and armed with a. long, vicious-looking spur just at the base of the 
metatarsus. I was about to say "thumb," but it seems quite probable

that birds long ago lost tlieir thumbs, and that the middle finger lias 
come to do duty in its place. However, this digit has been termed thumb 
for a long time, and since it is one by analogy, we will still call it so. 
There is a curious instance among the gigantic extinct group of rep- 
tiles, well named Dinosaurs,* where the thumb itself has become changed 
in function, and instead of aiding the 
other digits to lay hold of things, has 
become transformed iuto a long, sharp 
sjjike. This occurs in the Iguanodons 
(fig. 5), and among them the species 
particularly noticeable is I(juano<Jon 
heruissartensis, one of nearly two score 
that were haj)pily swept iuto a con- 
venient Jurassic gully and there re- 
mained for long ages, until brought to 
light by the picks of the coal miners of 

Bernissart. That in this case the spike did duty as a weapon is a little 
uncertain, and it may have served no more harmful purpose than that 
of ripping oft" the husk of some fruit or vegetable which formed part of 
the food of these great herbivorous reptiles. 

When these pointed thumb-spikes were first found, they were not 
associated with the fore limbs, and so in restoring 
the Iguanodon he was figured with the spike on 
the end of his nose, something like a rhinoceros. 
The late Dr. W. K. Parker, in a memoir on 
the morphology of the duck and auk tribes, 
rather hints that the thumb of Iguanodon and 
the spur of Chauna chavaria are, morphologically, 
not so far apart, t 

Another group of spur-winged birds is the 
Jacamdfv, a family of small birds related to the 
rails, having such long slender toes that they 
run as easily over lily pads and tloating vegeta- 
tion as other birds do over drv land. These little 
birds, which are found in th6 warmer parts of 
America, Africa, southern Asia, and Australia, 
like the spur-winged plovers, have a spur on the 
metacarpus, although it is not so large as in those 
l)irds. As in the spur-winged i^lovers we find 
si^urs associated with wattles for the African and 
Asiatic species which have no wattles, have only

Till' Jacuiiii, like the Iloactziu and Mouud Builder, acquires its full 
activities at an early date, and Hudson says : 

While I was looking- rlosely at one of the eggs lying in the iialni of my hand, all 
at once the cracked shell parted, and at the same moment the yonng bird leaped 
from my hand and fell into the water wliere it swam rapidlj' to a small mound and 
escaping from the water, concealed itself in the grass, lying close and perfectly 
motionless like a yonug jilover. 

lam quite sure that the young bird's sudden escape from the shell was the result 
of a A'iolent effort to free itself, inspired by the loud persistent screaming of the 
parent birds Avhich it heard while in the shell. 

In the jacanas belonging to the genus Metopidius the spur is much 
reduced in size, but the bone of the wing itself is so modified as to 

become available as a weapon, 
being flattened and widened so 
as to be a scimeter on a small 
scale (fig. 6). The apparent draw- 
back to this weapon lies in the 
fact that, like a two-edged sword, 
it must cut both ways, and unless 
the skin immediately over it is 
particularly dull and insensible

CM. N„. 18785, 1, s. N. M. Whether or not this tends to pro- 

mote peacefulness we do not 
know, but from what we know of bipeds, who claim to be higher in 
the scale of life, it may be presumed that Metopidius does not mind 
being hurt himself provided the "other fellow" is hurt still more. 

Largest and most formidable of all spur- winged birds are the Screamers 
{Anhimida;), three species of birds related to the ducks, although they 
do not look it, and restricted to South America.* 

These birds have two si)urs, instead of one, upon the outer part of the 
wnig (fig. 7), the outermost a short affair, the inner an ugly three-sided, 
stiletto-like blade, about an inch and a quarter long and almost as sharp 
as a needle. In fact, it is not unlike part of one of those large needles 
used by sail-makers known as roping needles, and it would seem quite 
capable of being driven completely through a man's hand by a stroke of 
the screamer's i)owerful wing. And yet we are told that the screamers 
are peaceable birds, associating amicably in large flocks, so that this 
array of spurs, like our modern ironclads, is strictly in the interest of 
peace. 

* South America is particularly rich in anomalous birds, remnants or relics, one 
luiglit say, of a bygone avifauna. The Hoactzin, Opisthocomiis cristatus, forms au 
order by itself, and the three species uf screamers, Anhbna anhima, Chaiina chaiuuia 
and C. derbhia form another. So do the Tinamous (Crypfuri), while the Trumpeter 
(Psophia crepitans), Cariama (Cariama cristata). and Guacharo Bird {Stcatontis cari- 
pensis) each and all are isolated forms. 



THE WEAPONS AND WINGS OF BIRDS. 661 

From spurs to claws is an easy transition, since tlie only difference 
between them is in their location, claws being at the ends of toes and 
fingers, while spurs are placed on or near the ankle and wrist. While 
the claws on a bird's wing, for claws as well as spurs are found there, 
serve no purpose as weapons and are seemingly of no use at all in old 
birds, they have a great deal of interest attached to them. 

One who has had the good fortune to see the purple gallinule in its 
native swamps may have seen the little ones climbing out of their nest 
and scrambling over the branches very much like four-footed animals. 
Or, if not the purple gallinule, he may perhaps have seen the young of 
its humble relative, the Florida gallinule, pulling itself up some little 
incline by its wings, something as a bat hooks himself along.* If the

observer has investigated he will have found on the outermost finger 
of the wing a small, sharp claw, and may have wondered what this 
claw was doing there. 

Tliis claw is of very common occurrence, and is especially frequent 
among water birds, or those which are lowest or most generalized in 
their structure. Sometimes this claw is so small as to almost escape 
detection, and again, as in the turkey buzzard, it may be so large that 
it can be found at once. Occasionally, very occasionally in fact, there 
is a second minute claw, or rudiment of a claw, hidden among the 
feathers at the very end of the wing bone, but this needs to be care- 
fully looked for. Without a knowledge of fossil birds, it might be diffi- 
cult to satisfactorily explain the presence of this useless claw, but if 
we regard rudimentary organs in existing forms as shadows of the past 
and vestiges of complete useful parts in extinct animals, the reason for 
its presence is clear, and we will look upon the little wing claws of mod 
ern birds as reminiscences of well-clawed ancestors. The earliest bird 
with which we are at present acquainted is the well known Arclmop- 
teryx, from the lithographic states of Solenhofen, Bavaria, and this form 
seems not only to have had wings for flight, but hands for climbing.

[Jnfortunately there is still some doubt as to the exact struetnre of the 
wing of ArclKvoj^teryx, and it seems probable that it is misrepresented 
in most text books.* One thing, however is undeniable, there were in 
this wing 3 well-formed, clawed fingers, and if only 2 of them Avere free, 
ArcJucopteryx could certainly climb about very readily. 

It seems quite a transition from the long-tailed, toothed Archceopteryx, 
with its three clawed fingers, to the ordinary birds of to-day, the more 
that very few of the intermediate stages have been brought to light. 
Fortunately, however, there is a bird still living, and not uncojnmou, 
in parts of South America, which goes some distance toward bridging 
over the gap between gallinule and Archwopteryx. This bird, which 

on account of its many peculiarities, 
stands quite alone among modern 
birds, and is looked upon as the sur- 
vivor of a great grouj) of birds which 
has become extinct, is Opisthocomns 
cristatns. From the unpleasant odor 
of its liesh, acquired from its food of 
wild arum leaves, the bird is more 
commonly known as the stink bird, 
or stinking pheasant, while what 
Dr. Cones would term its "book" 
name is Hoactzin or Hoatziu.t 
The adult birds not only have no claws upon their wings, but their 
thumbs, even, are so poorly develoi)ed that one would hardly suspect 
that in the nestlings we have the nearest approach to a quadruped 
found among existing birds. Mr. J. J. Quelch, who studied them in 
British Guiana, f tells us that soon after the hatching of the eggs the 
nestlings begin to crawl about by means of their wings and legs, the 
well-developed claws on the pollex and index being coustantljnn use for 
holding and hooking to the surrounding objects (fig. 8). If they are 
drawn from the nest by means of their legs, they hold on firmly to the 
twigs both with their bill and wings ; and if the nest be upset by means 
of a rod liushed uj) from below, they hold on to all objects with which 
they come in contact by means of bill, feet, and wings, making con- 
siderable use of the bill, not only to reach objects above them, but also, 
with the help of the clawed wings, to raise themselves to a higher level. 
When the parent bird is driven from the nest, owing to the close 
approach of a boat, then the young birds, uidess they be only quite 
recently hatched, crawl out of the nests on all fours, and rapidly try to 
hide in the thicker bush behind.

THE WEAPONS AND WINGS OF BIRDS. 663 

Oue curious feature noticed with a nestling whicli liad been upset into 
the river was its power of rapid swimming and diving when pursued. 
As soon as the hand was placed close to it, it rapidly dived into the 
dark water, in which it was impossible to see it, and would rise at dis- 
tances of more than a yard away. Owing to this power, the little 
creature managed to evade all attempts to seize it, taking refuge 
eventually far under the bushy growth where it was impossible to pur- 
sue it. The prolonged immersion which a nestling will thus instinc- 
tively and voluntarily undergo, or which an adult bird will bear in an 
attempt to drown it, seems quite remarkable. 

The nestlings, even when quite small, are frequently found far away 
from any nest, climbing by the help of their clawed wings, after the 
parent birds during their feeding time. 

Not the least of the many interesting features of the Hoactzm is the 
rapid change which takes place in the fore limb during the growth of 
the bird by which the hand of the nestling with its well-developed, well- 
clawed fingers, becomes theclawless wing of the old bird with its abor- 
tive outer finger. It gives us, as it were, an epitome of the past history 
of birds, and as the events of a century are summed up in a page of 
history so the slow progress of birds from the Jurassic Archa'opteryx 
to the thrush of to-day is represented by a few weeks in the life of the 
Hoactzin.

NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET 

[Based on Collections ln the U. S. National Museum.] 



By William Woodnille Rockhill. 



aiBET — ORIGIN OF THE NAME — LIMITS — HISTORY OF ITS CIVILIZA- 
TION DERIVED FROM TIBETAN AND CHINESE SOURCES. 

The word "Tibet," also freiiueiitly though erroneously written Thibet, 
represents two Tibetan words,* meaning " Upper Bod," by which name 
the central and western portions of Tibet are occasionally called by the 
natives, to distinguish them from the eastern portiou, which is some- 
times referred to as Miin-Bod {Sman Bod), meaning " Lower Bod." 

As to the meaning of the word Bod, different explanations have 
been offered by European scholars— that which has been most gener- 
ally accepted, though on insufticient grounds, I think, derives it from 
the verb /tfcofZ-pa (pronounced hodpa)'-^ to call, to speak," and attention 
has been called to the fact that the name Slav has a similar meaning. t 
Schiagintweit says the name is derived from a word meaning "force," 
aid Vigue (Travels in Kashmir, ii, p. 248) thinks it comes from the 
turKic and means nothing less than "the mountains of the people pro- 
fessing the Buddhist religion."! 

However this may be, Tibetans from whatever part of the country 
they come speak of themselves as Bod-pa, pronounced in some dis- 
tricts Beuba, in otliors,Bopa, and even Gopa. In colloquial Tibetan 
the country is called Beu lumba, Ben sa-ch'a or Beu yul, all meaning 
"the Beu (ba) country. ' 

The earliest mention I Lave found of the word "Tibet" is in the 
Arab Istakhri's works (circa 590 A. D.), where it is used undertheform 
Tohbat. Other Arab authors of a later date transcribe the word 
Tobbat, Tiibbat, Tibbat, Tibat,iind Thabbat. The earliest use of the

word by an European author is found in Piano Carpini's Historia Mon- 
galorum (A. D. 1247), wliere it occurs under the form Thabet-, Kubruk 
in his Itinerariuin uses the form Tehet, as does also Marco Polo. (See 
H. Yule, Glossary of Anglo-Indian words, pp. 332, 698.)* 

Mongols speak of Tibet as Tan</ut, and Tibetans they call Tan- 
gutu, and this is the origin of another appellation for this people and 
country sometimes used by European authors, Tangast (Tlieopliy- 
lactus) and Taugut (Prjevalsky), which should, however, be discarded 
as useless and misleading, as the people inhabiting this section of 
country are pure Tibetans. 

Tibet is geographically, roughly speaking, that section of central Asia 
which extends between the 76° and 102° of east longitude and from 
the 28° to 36° of north latitude, and, with the exception of its extreme 
western, southwestern, and southern portions, it forms an integral por- 
tion of the Chinese Empire. 

Elisee Reclns (Geographic Universelle, vii, p. 20 et seq.) says that 
Tibet forms a vast half circle with a radius of 800 kilometers, and that 
it is one of the best defined natural regions in the world. He roughly 
estimates its area, rightly including in it the Kokonor Tibetan region 
on the northeast, and the other Tibetan-speaking countries on the west 
and south, at about 2,000,000 square kilometers. 

It would be premature at the present stage of our researches into 
the question to give any opinion on the varied affinities of the Tibetans. 
Philologically they belong to the same linguistic family as the Bur- 
mese. Their national records have been so badly kept that they are of 
little service to us in solving the problem of their early home, and the 
Chinese annals do not enable us to go back earlier than the eighth 
century, A. D., at which time the Chinese came in contact with tribes 
of this race, then scattered throughout the northeast corner of Tibet 
between the upper Yang-tzu kiang, the Kokonor, and the western 
section of Kan-su and Ssu-ch'uan as far east as the river Min, in the 
latter province. 

The purest type of Tibetan is still to be found among the pastoral 
tribes of that race, and when proper allowance has been made for foreign 
influences, everything points to a time when the whole Tibetan race 
lead a purely pastoral life, and it would seem that the early home of 
the Tibetan nuist be sought, not as they claim, in the valleys to the 
south of the city of Lh'asa, but to the northeast section of the country, 
somewhere near the Kokonor, to which region they probably caiue, as 
Chinese annals lead us to believe, from the east. 

Reference has been made to Tibetan historical works as a guide in 
the intricate question of their national origin, but it is believed that 
these works are of little, if any, assistance. As a means of studying

cues.

the growth of the country and its advance in civiUzatiou they are 
fortunately of a little more use. 

I will here briefly give the principal data bearing on the subject which 
interests us, contained in a "Book of Kings," or Gyal-rabs sal-vai 
m6-long (Dr.Emil Schlagiutweifs edition, 18G6), which it must, however, 
be admitted is of comparatively modern origin and was unquestionably 
compiled under Chinese influence. 

From this work we learn that in the first century B. C. there 
appeared in Tibet, in the valley of the Tsaugpo ch'u and to the south 
of the city of Lh'asa, a marvelously endowed child whom the wild 
natives thought heaven had sent to rule them, and whom they took as 
their chief. This would point to intercourse with India during the 
earliest days .of their national existence, but as the work goes on to 
show that this prince was a direct descendant of the Buddha Gautama, 
a descent than which none could be higher in the eyes of the devout 
Tibetans, we may doubt the accuracy of the record on this point. 

In the reign of this first prince's seventh successor, consequently 
sometime in the second century A. D., it is stated that charcoal was 
made for the first time, and iron, copper, and silver were extracted from 
the ore, plows were introduced, and the irrigation of fields made known. 

In the fifth century A. D., in the reign of Tri-nyan zung-tiin, fields 
were for the first time fenced in, skin garments were made, walnut trees 
were planted, and reservoirs dug to supply water for irrigating the 
fields. 

In the reign of his successor the yak was crossed with the domestic 
cow and the valuable cross-breed called djo obtained. Mules were 
imported into the country and the people were taught how to make 
bundles of hay. From the fact that grass is still at the present day 
twisted into heavy cables and allowed to dry in this shape and is so 
kept, both in Kashmir (see W. Moorcroft, Travels, II, 153) and in Tibet, 
it is probable that this method of bundling hay was learned from the 
former country. 

In the seventh century Srong-tsan gam bo ascended the throne of 
Tibet and in his long reign the country made rapid strides in civiliza- 
tion. Under his rule Tibet became an aggressive power and its armies 
attacked all the neighboring countries, China not excepted. 

The King sent T'onmi Samb'ota to India to there find a system of 
writing applicable to the Tibetan language, and also to open negotia- 
tions for his marriage with a ]S"epalese princess. 

TV)nmi brought back an alphabet based on the nagari in use at the 
time in Kashmir, and composed of 30 consonants, 34 of wliich repro- 
duced more oi; less closely their prototypes, and G were invented for 
sounds which did not exist in Sanskrit. 

It is recorded m the Bodhimur (I. J. Schmidt, Geschichte der Ost 
Mongolen, p. 329) that the King wrote a treatise on horse breeding, 
besides several other lighter works. 



672 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

With the Nepalese (;oiisort he had takeu to himself, Buddhism, which 
had probably beeu kuowu to, though not adopted to auy extent by, 
the Tibetans prior to this date, became the state religion, and the form 
of that religion obtaining in Nepaul was adopted by the Tibetans, 
though a number of ceremonies and customs peculiar to tlieir national 
Boubo religion were retained by them and incorporated in the new 
foith. 

With the Chinese princess who was married to Srong-tsan-gambo, 
somewhere about 635 A. D., many Chinese customs and valuable inven- 
tions found their way into Tibet. The Tibetan history from which most 
of the preceding data are obtained says that rice wine {samshu) and 
barley wine {eh''an(j), butter, and cheese then for the first time became 
known in Tibet, the people learned how to make i^ottery, and water 
mills and looms were introduced into the country. 

Chinese history tells us that when the king took the princess Wen- 
ch'eng to his capital, which he had but recently transferred to Lh'asa 
from a point further south, at or near the capital of the first king, Nya- 
tri tsanpo, he built her a ])alace in Chinese style. 

But the princess, disliking tlie reddish-brown color Avitli which the people were 
in the habit of coating- their faces, * the king forbade the practise throughout the 
realm. He himself, discarding his felt and sheepskin garments, wore fine silks 
and brocades, and gradually adopted Chinese customs. He sent the children of his 
chief men to attend the schools of China, there to study the classics, and his official 
communications to the Emperor were written in Chinese. He asked the Emperor to 
send him silkworm eggs, wine ]tresses, paper and ink makers. These things, 
together with the imperial almanack, were all sent him. (Wei-Tsang t'u chih, in 
Jour. Roy. Asiat. Soc, n. s., xxui, p. 191.) 

But more than anything else the introduction of, and the rapid con 
quest of the country, by Buddliist missionaries from Nepal, Kashmir, 
and China helped to mold the culture of the country into its present 
foini, in which the arts and customs of India and China are found side 
by side overlaying the rude native civilization, though the latter is 
never entirely hidden from view. 

Under the reign of the grandson of Srong-tsan gambo, Guug-srong 
du-je by name, tea was introduced into Tibet from China, and earrings 
and new modes of hairdressing were brought there from India. 

A little later on it is said that works on astronomy and a>trology, 
medicine and surgery, were translated from Sanskrit and Chinese into 
the stilted, artificial literary Tibetan which had grown up since the 
introduction of the alphabet and tJie adoption of Buddhism in the 
country. (See W. W. Eockhill, Life of the Buddha, p. 201 et seq.) 

At this point in the history of the civilization in Tibet, Chinese and 
native works alike fail us, but enough has been got from them to show 

* Tibetan women at the present day cover their faces with a black paste made of 
catechu and grease, to protect the skin, which in such a dry and windy countrN \\()ul(l,

NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 673 

US that the present civilization and rather advanced degree of culture 
is entirely borrowed from China, India, and, I may add, possibly Turke- 
stan, and that Tibet has only contributed the simple arts of the tent- 
dwelling herdsman. What history has partially disclosed to us will 
be more fully demonstrated by an examination of the Museum's Tibetan 
collections, and by a comparison of the habits and customs of the 
country with those of the people living beyond its eastern and southern 

borders. 

II. 

CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY AND PEOPLE. 

Tibet is naturally divided into three parts, according to the altitude 
of the country above sea level and the trend of the valleys: 

(1) The northern plateaux, extendiug over more than 12° of lougi- 
tude (from east longitude 80° to 92°) and over 0° of latitude (from oOo 
north to 30°), which are over an average altitude of 15,000 feet above 
sea level and are inhabited by a scanty population of seminomadic 
pastoral tribes called Drupa {Hbrog-pa.) 

(2) Valleys which run either parallel to the southern edge of this 
great northern i^lateau or which, having their heads on its eastern 
edge, trend in an easterly direction for a few hundred miles, and which 
nowhere descend below an altitude of 10,000 feet above the level of 
the sea. 

(3) Valleys trending approximately north and south in the eastern 
portion of this country and which descend to an altitude of 0,000 feet 
above the level of the sea. 

In the country comprised in these last two regions permanent habi- 
tations and cultivation are found up to an average altitude of about 
13,500 feet, which is also apijroximately the height of the timber line 
in this latitude. 

The northern and southern trend of the valleys in the eastern portion 
of this third region, opposing no barrier to the moisture-laden clouds 
driven by the southwest monsoon, the region around the Kokonor 
and all the country to the southwest of it has probably a much heavier 
rainfall than any other i)art of Tibet, and the lower portions of all 
the valleys in this region are consequently much more fertile than 
others of the same altitude, but trendin g east and west, along the 
northern slope of the Himalaya. 

All these natural conditions have exercised marked influence on the 
degree of culture and on the ijeopling of the different sections of this 
country, and must not be lost sight of in any study of the inhabitants 
and their relationship and intercourse with other tribes and peoples. 

With the exception of the extreme northern and northeastern por- 
tions of the region here called Tibet, the population belongs essentially 
to one race, and, as elsewhere mentioned, the purest representatives of 
this stock are to be found among the pastoral tribes, or Drupa, which, 
H. Mis. 184, pt. 2^ 43 



674 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

whether fouud around the Kokonor, in eastern, western, or central 
Tibet, offer a uniform type which may be called the Brupa type. 

The second type of the Tibetan race is found in those sections of the 
country in which there are permanent habitations. It is a mixed race, 
becoming more Chinese as one goes toward China, or more Indian 
(Xepalese or Kashmiri) as one travels southward or westward. The 
reason of the very pronounced departure of this portion of the present 
Tibetan population from its original type is easily accounted for in the 
custom of foreign traders, soldiers, pilgrims, or ofticials inhabiting 
the country, of never bringing their wives into Tibet, but taking 
native concubines, a custom, by the way, common in most parts of Asia. 
In as small a population as that of Tibet, which does not probably 
exceed 3,000,000 (Journ. Eoy. Asiat. Soc, n. s., xxiii, p. 14), where the 
principal centers of population are and have been inhabited by com- 
paratively large numbers of foreigners for several centuries at least, 
this profound alteration of the primitive tyi)e is easily accounted for 
in this manner. 

Among the Drupa Tibetans the males measure about 5 feet 5 inches; 
the feiiiales not appreciably less.* The head is brachycephalic ; the 
hair, when worn, is nearly invariably wavy; the eyes are usually of 
a clear brown, in some cases even hazel; the cheekbones are high, but 
not as high as with the Mongols; the nose is thick, sometimes 
depressed at the root, in other cases prominent, even aquiline, but 
usually narrow, but the nostrils are broad; the teeth are strong, but 
irregular; the ears, with tolerably large lobes, stand out from the head, 
but to a less degree than with the ^Longols; the mouth is broad, the 
lips not very full, and among the people in the lower regions decidedly 
thin; the beard is very thin and, with the exception of the mustache, 
which is sometimes worn, especially in central Tibet, it is carefully 
plucked out with tweezers. Though 1 have seen a few men in central 
Tibet, at Draya and Ch'amdo, for instance, with tolerably heavy beards 
and hair all over their bodies, as a general rule Tibetans liave no hair on 
their limbs or chests. The shoulders are broad, the arms normal; the 
legs not well developed, the calf especially small. The foot is large, 
the hand coarse. 

The women are usually stouter than the men, their faces much fidler; 
their breasts are not large, nor are they very pendent. They do not 
appear to be very prolific; I have never seen in any one family more 
than six or seven children; many are barren. They do not entirely 
lose their good looks before 30 or 35. Thej^ are as strong, or perhaps 
even stronger than the men ; because, obliged to do hard work from child- 
hood, their muscles are more fully developed than those of the men, 
who neither carry water on their backs, work at the looms, nor tend 
the cattle. The women's hair is long and coarse, but not very thick; it 
remains black, or only mixed with a little white to extreme old age. I 
have rarely seen one with white hair ; this remark applies also to the men. 

*See Brian H. Hodgson, miscellaneous essays relating to Indian subjects, ii, p. 95. 



NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 675 

There is very little, if any, perceptible odor about the Tibetan's per- 
son, save that which is readily traced to dirty clothes. Partial baldness 
in both sexes is not uncommon. Their heads they keep tolerably clean by 
frequently anointing the hair and scalp with butter, but vermin is com- 
mon among them, especially with the women, and it is a very common 
sight to see a number of them crouching before their houses in the sun 
cleaning the head of a husband, a child, or a friend; all captures belong 
to the original owner, who eats them with relish, saying, "As they 
live on me, they can not be unclean food for me, though they might be 
for anyone else," Washing the body is never, or hardly ever, indulged 
in, except involuntarily when fording a stream or wiien drenched by the 
rain.* 

The skin of the Tibetan is coarse and greasy. Its color is a light 
brown, frequently nearly white, except where exposed to the weather, 
when it becomes a dark brown, nearly the color of our American 
Indians. Eosy cheeks are quite common among the yimnger women. 

The Tibetans' voices are powerful, those of the men deep; those of 
the women full and not very shrill. Their hearing is good, and they 
can converse freely from one side of a valley to the other, a distance 
of fnllj^ a half a mile, without ever having to repeat phrases or jier- 
ceptibly raise the voice. In singing their voices are pitched in a lower 
key than is usual among Chinese or Mongols, and in their church serv- 
ices the voices are always a deep bass. Their sight does not appear to 
be exceptionally sharp, but I have seen few nearsighted persons among 
them, though blindness, resulting generally from cataracts, is rather 
common, also opthalmia, attributable in a great measure to their using 
hats but rarely, and to the pungency of the smoke in their dwellings. 

They can endure exposure without any apparent inconvenience. In 
the coldest weather I have seen them slip the upper part of their 
bodies out of their sheepskin gowns to i)erforin any kind of work requir- 
ing freedom of motion. The women do nearly all their work with the 
the right side of the body completely exposed, and they put no clothes 
on very small children except in the coldest weather, allowing them to 
move about naked, or with only a pair of boots on. 

Hunger they can also endure, and they are at all times small eaters. 
Eating a little whenever they drink their tea, they never take a hearty 
meal, but stave off continually the pangs of hunger. Though the 
nature of the food they use is such that they can not endure absolute 
privation from all food for any considerable length of time, they can 
with ease travel for long i^eriods on starvation rations. 

The average length of life is not very much shorter in Tibet than 
among the Mongols, though it is certainly lower than among the 
Chinese. I have seen but few old men among them, and they were not 

* Speaking of their neighbors, the Mongols, William of Eubruk remarks : " Vestes 
nimcinam lavant quia dicunt qiiod Dens tunc irascitnr, et quod fiat tonitrua si 
8us])endantur ad siccandum. Immo lavantes, verberant, et eis auferunt." (Itinera- 
rium, Edit. Soc. G4og. de Paris, p. 234.) 



67B REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

over 80 years of age. A luan of 70 is liekl to be very old, and I liave 
not seen a woman of that age. The age of ])nberty is reached in the 
males about the fifteenth year, and among the girls possibly a little 
sooner. The women bear until at least 35. The mothers never wean 
their babies; a child continues to suckle until another comes to take its 
place; I have repeatedly seen children of 4 years of age walk up to 
their mother and take her breast. Anumg the natives married to 
Chinese infanticide is sometimes practiced, as I have been assured by 
the husbands themselves, but as a general rule the Tibetan women are 
good mothers, and the fathers show great fondness for their offspring. 

The most common abnormality I have noticed among Tibetan men is 
a supplementary iinger, usually growing from the thumb, and in one 
case from the side of the palm nearest the little finger. This is also a 
common deformity in China. I have seen two cases of men having club 
feet, or an imperfectly developed foot with a shortened leg. One case 
of distortion of the spine and one of supernumerary teeth (or double 
row of lower teeth), have also come to my notice, and Ashley Eden 
(Eeport on the state of Bootan, p. 70) mentions three albinos in a family 
of Tibetans in Bhutan. 

Father Desideri, Avho lived in Tibet for thirteen years (A. D. 1716- 
1729), says that "The Tibetans are naturally gentle, but uncultivated 
and coarse" (Markliam's Narrative of the mission of George Bogle, 
p. 306); and Father Horacio della Penna, another missionary to that 
country in the eighteenth century, says: 

The Tibetans, speaking as a rule, are inclined to viudictiveness; but they know 
■well how to dissemble, and when opportunity offers will not fail to revenge them- 
selves. They are timid and greatly fear justice. * * * If, however, they are 
protected by some great lord, they lay aside all fear and become arrogant and proud. 
They are greedy of money ; * * * they are also somewhat given to lust; ** * * 
they are addicted to habits of intoxication . * * * tliey are but slightly loyal to 
their chiefs; * * * they are also dirty and nasty and without refinement. {Ibid, 
p. 318.) 

Father Desgodins, who has been living in Tibet since 1856, thus 
describes the Til)etan : 

It appears to me that the Tibetan, no matter who he may be, is essentially a slave 
to human respect. If he believes you great, powerful, and rich, there is nothing he 
will not do to obtain your good will, your favors, your money, or even a simple mark 
of your approval. If he has only something to hope for, he will receive you with all 
the signs of the most profound submission or of the most generous cordiality, accord- 
ing to circumstances, and will make you interminable compliments, using the most 
fulsome and the most honied expressions that the human mind has been able to invent. 
In this line he might give points to the most accomplished fiatterer of Europe. If, 
on the contrary, he thinks you of low station, he Avill only show you stiffness, or at 
the most, formal, unwilling politeness. Should your fortune change, have you 
become a beggar in his eyes, abandoned and Avithout authority, he at once turns 
against you, treats you as a slave, takes the side of your enemies, without being 
ashamed at the remembrance of his former protestations of devotion and friendship, 
•without listening to the dictates of gratitude. A slave toward the great, a despot 
to the small, whoever they may be, dutiful or treacherous, according to circum- 
stances, looking always for some way to cheat, and lying shamelessly to attain his 
end. In a word, naturally and essentially a false character. Such is, I think, the 
Tibetan of the cultivated countries of the south, who considers himself much more 



NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 677 

civilized than the shepherd or herdsman of the north, with whom I have had but 
little intercourse, and of whom I do not pretend to draw the portrait. 

One readily understands that with such a character, with dissolute habits, the 
Tibetan becomes easily cruel and vindictive. Often discussion, begun in laughter 
and usually while drinking, ends with drawn knives. If he has not appeased his 
anger, he never forgives. Revenge alone can jiacify him if he believes himself 
insulted. But he does not show it at tirst. On the contrary, he affects to live on 
good terms with his enemy. He invites him, trades in preference with him, but he 
wull put a ball in his chest after a good dinner, during which lie has shown himself 
most friendly and has sworn the other lasting friend.ship. 

Such are the principal faults of the Tibetan. What are his virtues? I believe his 
mind is instinctively religious, and this leads him to willingly perform certain 
external devotional practices and even to go on long and trying pilgrimages, which 
cost him, however, but little money. As to religious convictions, he has absolutely 
none, a result of the profound ignorance in which the lamas leave tlie people, either 
on account of their incapacity to teach them, or perhaps so as to keep the business of 
Avorship in their own hands, as it insures them a large revenue. The religious acts 
of the i^eople are ouly performed through routine; they do not understand them or 
care to understand them ; hence ignorance in the lower classes, scepticism and indif- 
ference in the others, principally among the mandarins and lamas. The Tibetan's 
other virtues are nearly all material ones, if I may use such an expression ; thus, he 
bears with ease and for long periods cold, fatigue, hunger, and thirst; but if he 
finds good compensation for his sulferings, he will never overlook it. He is generally 
active, but less industrious than the Chinese, and arts have advanced much less in 
Tibet than in Cliina. While at work, he sings without a care; at a feast, he goes 
gossiping about and drinking with his friends; he sings, dances, and drinks during 
the night without a recollection of the sorrows of the day before, or without think- 
ing of the cares of the morrow. Such is the Tibetan as I have known him. (C. H. 
Desgodius, Le Thibet, pp. 251-253.) 

Though Father Desgodius has lived longer among Tibetans than any 
other foreigner of whom I know, still the opinions of other travelers 
must not be overlooked. Turner (Embassy to the Court of the Teshoo 
Lama, p. 350) says: 

The Tibetans are a very humane, kind people; I have personally had numerous 
opportunities of observing their disposition. 

Humanity, and an unartiticial gentleness of disposition, are the constant inheri- 
tance of a Tibetan. I never saw these qualities preserved by any people in a more 
eminent degree. Without being servilely officious, they are always obliging; the 
higher ranks are unassuming; the inferior, respectful in their behavior; nor are they 
at all deficient in their attentions to the female sex ; but, as we find them moderate 
in all their passions, in this respect also their conduct is eiiually remote from rude- 
ness and adulation. 

Capt. Turner, it is not amiss to remark, attributes these pleasing 
qualities of the Tibetan to the much-abused practice of polyandry. 

Though I would not care to put up my opinion against men who have 
had so much more exi^erience than I of the native character, I can not 
but think that the Tibetan's character is not as black as Horace della 
Penna and Desgodius have painted it. Intercourse with these people 
extending over six years leads me to believe that the Tibetan is kind- 
hearted, aflectionate, and law-abiding, and that many of the most objec- 
tionable features in his character, those on which Desgodius chiefly 
dwells, only appear in his intercourse with foreigners with whom he 
has had hardly any relations, and whom he instinctively fears and 



678 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

mistrusts, in view of tlie open hostility shown them by the official class 
throughout the country. 

Let us finish this sketch of Tibetau character by quoting what they 
say of themselves, and we need not judge them more harshly than the 
author of the Mani Kambum : 

The earliest inhabitauts of Tibet descended from a king of monkeys and a female 
hobgoVdin, aud the character of the race partakes of those of its first parents; from 
the king of monkeys (he was an incarnate god) they have religions faith and kind- 
heartedness, intelligence, and application, devotion to religion aud to religious debate ; 
from the hobgoblin, their ancestress, they get cruelty, fondness for trade and money 
making, great bodily strength, lustfulness, fondness for gossip, and carniverous 
instincts. (Land of the Lamas, p. 359.) 

III. 

ORGANIZATION — CONSANGUINE AL — POLITICAL — INDT STRIAL. 

Our preseut knowledge of Tibetan society is still too imperfect to 
justify touching on this subject except with extreme caution. 

As far as I have been able to ascertain during my residence among 
the Drupaor tent-dwelling tribes of Tibet, which, as previously stated, 
I am led to believe represent the purest type of that race, and in which 
the earliest form of Tibetau civilization has been well j)reserved, all the 
members of a clan have no family name excejit that of the chief or clan 
which is prefixed to their own. Thus, there are the Konsa. Chamri, 
Arik, ^Nyam-ts'o, Chu, Su, Na, etc., clans, and individuals of these clans 
are spoken of as Chamri Solo, Nyam-ts'o Purdung, Konsa Arabtan, etc. 
While a man may marry a woman either of his own tribal name or one 
of another, he may not a relative within at least three degrees, and 
chiefs do not marry, I think, in their clans. The looseness of the mar- 
riage relations, the difticulty of identifying people who are only known 
by -surnames, such as Lobzaug, Dorjc, Drolma, etc., all names of Bud- 
dhist origin, together with the habit of never using a person's name 
when addressing him or her, aud the very marked disinclination of 
this peoi)le, in common with most Asiatics, I may remark, of speaking 
of their families or family affairs, make researches on this subject 
extremely difficult. The fact that throughout Tibet not only polyandry 
but also polygamy obtains, adds wonderfully to the confusion in which 
the question of consanguineal organization is involved. 

Sarat Chandra Das (Narrative of a journey round Lake Yamdo, p. 
73) says: 

In Tibet there are no social restrictions or hindrances to marriage. The rich may 
bestow their daughters on the poor, the daughter of a poor man may become the 
bride of the proudest noble of the country. 

The Annals of the T'ang Dynasty (T'ang shu, Bk., 221, quoted in 
Land of the Lamas, p. 338) si^eaking of the T'ang-hsiang, a pure Tib- 
etan tribe living in the seventh or eighth century, A. D., somewhere 
near the western border of the Chinese province of Kan-su, says of 
them : 



NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 



679 



A son may marry his deceased father's or uncle's wife (or wives); a younger 
brother his deceased brother's wife, but he may not marry a person of the same cog- 
nomen as himself. 

Speaking of the Eastern Kingdom of women {Tung nil Tcuo), also a 
principality of eastern Tibet of the same period, and of which the 
people may have been Tibetans, the same work remarks that "the sons 
take the family name of their mothers." (Land of the Lamas, p. 341.) 

In the more highly civilized portions of Tibet there is no trace of 
family or tribal organization, nor is there any of castes. Certain fami- 
lies in each district, town, or city have acquired wealth, and numbers 
of them have held official positions — some in the church, others in the 
state — for many generations past. Around them, or on the land granted 
them by the state {jaghirs, they call such grants in India), live numer- 
ous tenants, serfs {misser), or slaves in some i)arts of the country, but 
they are held as membei'S of the family they serve, and the misser at 
least are not bound to the land, but may move where they please. 

Butchers, those who cut up corpses, beggars, and criminals, are the 
only persons at the present day who do not enjoy the same social priv- 
ileges as are granted to the highest classes. Dyers and workers in 
metal are also, in some localities, looked down on, and the ostracism of 
these two latter classes is in all probability a result of continued inter- 
course with India. 

As further bearing on the subject of relationship, it is interesting to 
note that, while the Tibetan language is comparatively rich in words 
expressing "father," "mother," "brothers," in relation to age, or to 
sisters, uncles, and aunts, it has only one word for " nephew" or "niece," 
and this is also used for "grandson" and "granddaughter," and it has 
none to express "cousin," but the word pon (spun), "brothers," or 
"brothers and sisters," is sometimes used to express this relationship. 
(Land of the Lamas, p. 213.)

680 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Politically Tibet may be divided into three parts: (1) Country under 
direct Lh'asau rule or influence; (2) country under Cliinese rule or 
influence; (3) country under British or other rule or influence. 

The first part comprises all central, western, most of the northern 
portion of the country, and a few outlying districts in eastern Tibet, 
such as Mark'ams, i^I^yarong, Ts'aroug, etc. The second part includes 
all northeastern Tibet, most of eastern, and a long, narrow strip 
called Jyade, extending nearly as far west as the Tengri nor. The 
third part comprises iSikkim, Bhutan, Ladak, etc. 

The spiritual and temporal ruler of the Kingdom of Lh'asa (Dcba 
djong is the term usually employed by natives to designate this por- 
tion of Tibet) is an incarnation of the god Shenrazig, the patron saint 
of the land. He is called Jyal-wa Jyamts'o or Tale lama. Prior to 1720 
the Tale lama was only spiritual ruler of Tibet, but at that date he was 
also made temporal ruler of the country by the Chinese. ( Journ. Roy. 
Asiat. Soc, n. s., xxxiii, pp. 74, 285 et seq). 

Under him is a regent, colloquially called " King of Tibet,'' or Desri, 
who is also a lama, chosen in turn from one of the four great monasteries 
{linf/) of Lh'asa, and whose appointment is made, like that of the Tal4 
lama himself and of all otlier high dignitaries of the state, subject 
to the approval of the Emperor of China. The Desri is president of 
the- council of ministers, or Kalmi, who are five in number, one lama 
and four laymen. These administer the country and act also in a 
judicial capacity. (Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc, loc. cit., p. 239.) The 
country for administrative purposes is divided into 53 djong or "dis- 
tricts," over which are Djong-pon, appointed by the Council of Minis- 
ters; they are both civil and military chiefs of their districts. Besides 
these there are a number of I>eha, some of whom are chiefs of the 
pastoral tribes, or DruiJa, inhabiting the more elevated and open 
parts of the country. 

Certain tracts of land are assigned to officers of high rank for their 
support, in lieu of salaries, and others are given as endowments to 
lamaseries. On many, if not all, of these the beneficiaries have not 
only all the revenues derivable therefrom, but exercise also judicial 
rights over the people inhabiting these estates, who are their serfs, sub- 
ject to all such corvees as they may see fit to order, such as working the 
laud, going on caravans, on which they have also to supply pack ani- 
mals or saddle ponies, supplying food to officers when passing through 
their place of residence, etc., all such service being known as ula* 

Although I do not believe that slavery exists in the greater part of 
Tibet, and certainly not among the pastoral tribes, beyond, perhaps, a

of Tibet, I must refer the reader to the following works: Sarat Chandra Das, Nar-

mild form of domestic slavery or serfdom, in some of tlie outlying dis- 
tricts where there is a large non-Tibetan population, as in the Ts'arong 
province in southeastern Tibet, regular slavery prevails, persons becom- 
ing slaves through birth, debt, or crime, and their offspring being 
also slaves. (Land of the Lamas, pp. 285, 286.) 

The second part of Tibet comprises that which is under Chinese rule 
and influence. It consists of tlie 18 districts of eastern Tibet, whose 
organization I have described elsewhere (Land of the Lamas, p.,218 
et seg.), the Jyade or "Chinese Province," and the Kokonor Tibetan 
districts. In the Jyade there are 36 chiefs or Debas, chosen from among 
the most influential headmen of the country ; they receive their appoint- 
ment from the imperial Chinese minister resident at Lh'asa. and are in 
receipt of a yearly stipend from the Emperor of China of 100 ounces of 
silver. Under them are numerous chiefs of clans whose charges are 
hereditary. (Geographical Journal, in, p. 377.) The organization of 
the Tibetan tribes living around the Kokonor is similar to that of Jyade, 
but the chiefs receive their commissions from the imperial resident at 
Hsi-ning (Kau-su). (Land of the Lamas, p. 73 et seq., and Diary of a 
journey in Mongolia and Tibet, p. 122 et seq. and p. 288.) 

The advantages to China of this organization are manifold, and have 
been demonstrated during many centuries of its history. With a min- 
imum ex])eiiditure of foi'ces and money, China attaches the frontier 
tribes to it through small allowances made to the most powerful chiefs, 
by granting the people certain advantages in trade (exemption from 
duties at all Chinese towns along the border), and by giving them lib- 
erty as to the administration of the internal aftairs of their country. 
Whenever necessary a Chinese military ex])edition can vindicate the 
supreme authority of the Emperor by a small display of force, whether 
it be in Lh'asa or in the unruly districts of northeast Tibet. 

T. T. Cooper (The Mishmee Hills, p. 131), speaking of the application 
of this system to the wild Indian hill tribes, says : 

It is a curious fact that, while we have ouly for a few years adopted this system 
of quieting some of tlie Indian hill tribes, the Chinese Government commenced several 
centuries ago by a similar system the subjugation of the numerous triljes on her 
western frontiers, which to-day form one of the iinest and most effectual frontier 
guards formed by any country in the world. Along a hill frontier of over 600 milea 
the tribes of western China form a complete barrier against ingress from the west. 
The chief of every clan or tribe has a nominal rank conferred upon him, to which is 
attached a trifling annual stipend. He is furnished with an ofdcial dress, which he 
wears in the presence of all Chinese officials. He is allowed to visit the court of 
Pekin every five years at his own expense, if he chooses, as a mark of homage to the 
Emperor. Such visits, however, are properly discouraged by the Chinese officials, 
though the nominal privilege of being allowed to go to Pekin is grateful to the pride 
of the barbarians, and makes them feel that, although subjects paying tribute, they 
are still persons of conse(iueuce and allies of a powerful empire. 

Although incorrect as to some details, 1 think Cooper has accurately 
weighed the value of this system to China. 

The political organization of the third section of Tibet, which com- 
prises Bhutan, Sikkim, and Ladak, is properly beyond the scope of this

study. Suffice it to say that in Bliutau the dual organization noticed in 
Lh'asa of a spiritual and temporal ruler is found in the Dharma Raja, 
the spiritual head of the state, and the Deb Raja or temporal ruler; 
there is also a council (or Lenchen) often members, which has under it 
a certain number of district officers or Djongpon. (Ashley Eden, Report 
on the State of Bootan, p. 108 et seq.) 

In Sikkim and Ladak a similar form of government obtains, with 
only slight differences, due to continued intercourse with or subjection 
by people of different origin.* 

Industrial organization. — In all parts of Tibet, whether among the 
pastoral tribes or in the towns and villages, the women not only do most 
of the household work, but they attend to much of the bartering, make 
the butter, assist in milking the cows and looking after the flocks and go 
on the ula. The men, aided by the women, work in the fields, or go on 
distant journeys, hiring out their yaks or mules to carry freight, or 
hiring themselves out as mule or yak drivers to merchants or to some 
neighboring lamasery. Those who remain in their town or village some- 
times follow a trade which occupies them during a small portion of their 
time. Some are smiths, working silver, copper, or iron, and, when needs 
be, becoming carpenters, gunsmiths, or locksmiths ; others, again, occupy 
themselves, when industriously inclined, twisting yarn, weaving garters, 
or making felt. In the towns nearly all shops are kept by women. 

Although the division of labor between the sexes is very unequal, 
much the greater part devolving upon the women, the position of that 
sex is not affected injuriously thereby. The wife's opinion is always 
asked in household matters and in questions of trade, and her author- 
ity in the house is supreme. She joins with the men in all discussions 
with perfect freedom and assurance, and in nearly every walk of life 
she is held to be on a footing of perfect equality by the male sex. Thus 
Turner (Embassy to the Court of the Teshoo Lama, p. o50) says : 

Comparatively with tlieir northern neighbors, tlie women of Tibet enjoy an ele- 
vated station in society. To the privileges of unbounded liberty the wife here adds the 
character of mistress of the family and companion of her husband. The company 
of all, indeed, she is not at all times entitled to expect. Different pursuits, either 
agricultural employment or mercantile speculations, may occasionally cause the 
temjiorary absence of each ; yet whatever be the result, the proht of the laborer 
flows into the common store, and when he returns, whatever may have been his 
fortime, he is secure of a grateful welcome to a social home. 

Father Desgodins, speaking, however, more especially of eastern 
Tibet, says (Le Thibet, p. 244) : 

It is not amiss to give here a further sketch of the condition of women in Tibet, 
where they are not contined to their homes as in India and in China. Here the women 
go about, look after their household affairs, or trade on the market place, work in the 
field, spin before their doors while gossiping with their friends, go on long journeys — 

* See J. D. Hooker, Himalayan Journals, ii, p. 290 et passim; G. T. Vigne, Travels in 
Kashmir, Ladak, Lskardo, II, p. 252 et seq.; W. Moorcroft, Travels in the Himalayan 
Provinces of Hindoostan, ii, pp. 11, 15, 20, 42, etc. 



NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 683 

sometimes on foot, at others on horseback. In this resi)ect the Tibetan woman is 
very free, but she is, nevertheless, the slave, the drudge of one or more husbands; 
she is bought like any other goods without asking her consent. In this way she, by 
right, becomes a kind of household chief, but she has to submit herself to all the 
wishes, the caprices, the brutal passions of her husbands. * * * In all heathen 
countries the woman is looked down upon as an inferior creature to man. The 
Tibetans have even a word to designate her by, which m9,y be translated by "low 
creature."" 

Father Hue (Souveuirs d'uii voyage dans la Tartarie et le Thibet, ii, 
p. 260) looks at the subject in a different light. 

One thing which tends to make me believe that in Tibet there is possibly less 
depravity than in certain other heathen countries, is the great freedom enjoyed by 
the women. Instead of vegetating imprisoned in their homes, they lead a laborious 
life full of activity. Besides having the care of their households, they monopolize 
all the small commerce of the country. They peddle goods here and there, spread 
them out in the streets, and keep nearly all the retail shops. In the country they 
also take a large share in all family pursuits. 

Chinese authors have found the cause of this superior position of 
Tibetan woman over those of most other Asiatic countries in their 
superior physique (Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc, n. s., xxiii, p, 230, also 
Land of the Lamas, p. 211), but it is probably in part due to Buddhism, 
and still more to i)olyandry. The former by admitting women into the 
sangha raised them materially in the- social scale ; the latter by the 
important role it makes them play in the family life has had the same 
effect.t 

Inheritance. — Property is inherited by the sons or brothers of the 
deceased. The daughters or wife get nothing. It is common, if not 
usual, for a wife, on the decease of her husband, to shave her head and 
become a nun or ani. This custom is also found among the Mongols. 

According to Chinese authors (but I have been unable to corroborate 
their statements), none of the personal property of a deceased person 
is inherited by his relatives. 

One-half of the property of the deceased is given away in charities and the other 
half is sent to the Lamas, who are invited to read the sacred books to his intent and 
entertained while so doing. It follows that all the (personal) property of the 
deceased is disposed of, the parents, children, husband, or Avife retaining no part of 
it whatever. (Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc, n. s., xxiii, p. 232.) 

The real estate remains, however, in the family, and, consisting 
usually of a large house and some very small and not by any means 
fertile fields, not sufficient to support several families, it is usual to 
keep the estate undivided; all the children of the deceased live in the 
house of their parent, the sons only taking one wife to themselves- 

*Sman-ia (pronounced vmnla). This inferiority is not very noticeable among 
pastoral or nomadic tribes. 

Uaeschke, Tib. Engl. Diet., s. v. sptoi, says: "Several neighbors or inhabitants 
of a village, who have a common Ih'a and thus become rus-pa-{ichi(j-chig , ' members of 
the same family,' are called spun or brothers. This common tie entails on them the 
duty, whenever a death takes place in their number, of caring for the cremation of 
the dead body." 



684 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

(Laud of the Lainas, p. 211.) Amoug the pastoral tribes, the sons 
divide the Hocks aud herds of their deceased father, after deductiug a 
considerable portion for presents to the clergy, bnt among them, as in 
the more civilized regions of the country, the widow does not inherit; 
she goes back to her family, or, if she has children, becomes depend- 
ent on them, or else she becomes an ani. 

IV. 

DRESS AND PERSONAL ADORNMENT. 

The earliest description I have met with of a Tibetan tribe, the 
T'ang-hsiang previously referred to, is in the Annals of the T'aug 
dynasty of China (A. D.G18-907). It is said of them : " Men and women 
wear long skin gowns, or gowns of coarse woolen stuff with a rough 
surface" (Land of the Lamas, p. 338). Of the Tukuhun, who inhabited 
the Kokonor, and were possibly of Tibetan stock, we read in the 
Annals of the Sui dynasty (A. D., 581-618) that their women " did up 
their hair in plaits, on which they sewed beads and cowrie shells; they 
wore long gowns and the men wore broad-brimmed hats." {0}). .su}). 
cit., p. 33G). 

Friar Odoric, who visited Tibet in the early part of the fourteenth 
century remarked that "the women have their hair plaited in more 
than one hundred tresses" (H. Yule, Cathay and the way thither, 
I, p. 150), and since that time the fashion of dressing and wearing the 
hair has not materially altered in the wilder parts of the country, 
although under Chinese and Indian influences the fashion has been 
sliglitly changed in parts of the country adjacent to those inhabited by 
people of these two races. 

The national dress of both sexes consists in a very full, high col- 
lared, large, and long-sleeved gown called ch'uha (a word of Turkish ori- 
gin). This gown is of sheepskin in winter, of native cloth {trulc or ta)* 
in summer. It is tied tiglitly around the waist with a woolen girdle so 
as to make it very baggy about the waist, and it reaches down to about 
the knee when worn by men aud to the ankle when worn by women. 
In a large part of the country this is the only garment worn. The col- 
lar and cuff's and hem are sometimes faced with black velvet or red or 
blue cloth, or striped truJc, or with otter or leopard skin. Buttons are 
not usually used, although those of Chinese make or army buttons 
obtained from India are much sought after, and small silver coins (half 
rupees generally) are frequently made into buttons, but more on 
account of them being ornamental than for any use they are put to. 

The cut of the cfi'uba and the way of wearing it differ in various 
parts of the country; the pastoral Tibetans wear it much shorter than 
those living in towns and villages, and who do not pass much of their 
time riding or climbing. So likewise the trimming of the cuffs and 
sleeves differs according to the tribe. 

* See for a descrii^tiou of these native clotbs, p. 699.

NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 685 

In the case of the summer cloth ch'uba, the favorite color for men when 
it is made of trul: is purple. The color of the chhiba worn by women is 
blue, or striped throughout eastern Tibet. Ta (or Imva) is an undyed 
woolen stuft" usually of coarser texture than the trnJ{. One ch'nha in the 
collection (Xo. 107195)* is of fine purple tniJc trimmed with leopard skin. 
Another is of undyed ta, made at Draya, the collar faced with striped 
tndc (No. 107196).* In this section of country the people do not usually 
wear sheepskin chiChas, and a gown of undyed ta is commonly worn 
over an inner one of purple or blue trul<. The length of the cWuba 
shown in pi. 1 is 5 feet 5 inches; this is the average length of all such 
garments, which have no particular tit, or rather which fit any wearer. 

The sheepskin cKnha (No. 167194) *, such as is worn by the Tibetans of 
the Kokonor, is also found in eastern Tibet. The 3ollar and cuffs are 
faced with red cloth and otter skin, and the hem with black velvet 
stitched with silks of different colors. This gown is a very handsome 
one of the kind. 

Another ch'uba in the collection (Xo. 131062) * is of red trulc lined with 
sheepskin. Such gowns are usually worn by lamas, but many laymen 
also wear red clothes, the color being a fiavorite one in Tibet and Mon- 
golia. 

In pi. 1 is shown a chhiha for a girl of 11*. It is nmde of striped truh, 
in which green, red, white, and blue preponderate. It is trimmed on 
the collar and cuff's with otter skin. 

In L'hasa and the more civilized portions of Tibet generally, cKuhas 
of foreign broadcloth or Chinese gowns {ao-tzit and p'ao-tzti) of silk or 
satin are frequently worn by the wealthy of both sexes. These are too 
well known to require description. 

Kain coats made of felt and cut on a pattern similar to the ch'uha, 
though somewhat shorter (4 feet 8 inches) on account of the stiffness of 
the .material, are worn in the Kokonor district and in some other por- 
tions of northeastern Tibet. The museum collection contains one of 
these (No. 131050).* A circular cape of felt is worn instead of this in 
the Horba country. It is especially useful on horseback, covering not 
only the rider but the horse completely, and is large enough to enable 
the wearer to wrap himself in it and sleep well protected without any 
other covering. I do not believe that similar garments are worn in 
central or western Tibet. Good tntJc is waterproof, and light chhthas 
are often carried by travelers to use in bad weather. 

The girdles worn are usually of woven wool, from 2 to 3 inches 
broad and 6 or 7 feet long. Tbe patterns vary in color, but little in 
design, which is always a narrow traverse stripe. The collection con- 
tains one of red, blue, white, brown, and yellow wool (Xo. 167291),* 
terminating at either end in a fringe. Another girdle is of red, blue, 
green, black, and white wool (No. 167289).* Very frequently a few yards 
of Chinese silk or a piece of Chinese blue cotton cloth take the place

686 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

of tlie home-made girdle. Other specimeus iu the collection, such as 
the one from Jyade, may be compared with this. 

A pair of boots {Ui-am) completes with the cWuha the costmne of the 
wild Tibetan. Near tlie Chinese border, in the Kokonor, these boots 
are of cowhide and of (^liinese make and pattern, as shown in pi. L*. 
Women and men wear the same kind of boot. It is bound tightly 
below the knee with a leather thong or a loug garter of wool. 

In localities more distant from China the national boot is found. It 
has a sole of raw yak hide which laps and turns up around the sides, 
which are of several thicknesses of white cotton cloth stronglj- stitched 
together with a broad seam down the middle of the top to the turned- 
up pointed toe. Sometimes, in men's boots, the upper and leg is of red 
leather, brought to Tibet from western China, the best coming from the 
Chien-ch'ang, iu southwestern Ssu-ch'uan. The legs of most boots are 
of tricky sometimes of one color, sometimes of pieces of different and 
somewhat gaudy colors, as shown in pi. 2, figs. 1 and 2. The leg of the 
boot is usually lined with a very coarse woolen stuff, and no socks are 
worn on the feet. The garters are about 4^ feet long and 1 inch broad, 
the designs usually very narrow longitudinal stripes. Some of them 
are beautifully fine and show great taste in the selection of the colors. 
(See pi. 13.) 

Among lamas the legs of the boots are invariably red and the uppers 
are always of white cotton clotli. Some fine boots are made with the 
uppersiand legs of red leather, or the legs of red and black leather, 
as in fig. I. Another very handsome pair of boots in the collection 
(No. 167179 and Diary of a Journey, etc., p. 14, fig. 5)* is worn only b^ 
high lama dignitaries in the northeast part of the country (Kokonor). 
This boot is entirely of red russian leather, and the seams are covered 
with embroidery in different colored silks. 

In Lh'asa and among Tibetan officials in the more civilized portions 
of the country generally the Chinese official velvet or satin boot is fre- 
quently worn, as is also a boot of black buckskin of Chinese pattern, as 
far as the foot and sole are concerned, but with a high Tibetan leg. 
This latter style is worn with a garter, is made in many localities by 
Chinese artisans, and is much liked by the natives. (See Diary of a 
Journey, etc., p. 14, fig. 6.) 

Trousers are occasionally worn by the men; they are always made 
like those worn iu China, and are of either sheepskin, native cloth, or 
coarse cotton, rather baggy, and reach down to about the ankle, where 
they are held by a garter. The boot is worn over them. In some of 
the more civilized portions of the country leggings {tao-Jcu), like those 
used by Chinese, are also worn by* the wealthy. 

Men»and women frequently wear a short shirt of raw silk {Imre, in 
Tibetan), reaching to above the waist and with long sleeves. Among 
tlie Kokonor Tibetans and in eastern Tibet it is made with a broad

collar faced with red cloth and edged with otter fur. The style of shirt 
worn at Lh'asa and in central Tibet generally is similar to the above, 
except that the collar is narrower. Examples of these shirts are in the 
Museum collection. Bure is manufactured in Bhutan. 

In central and western Tibet the women frequently wear over their 
shoulders a shawl (kadri)^ fastened at the neck with a large buckle of 
gold or silver. In Ladak, instead of this shawl a sheep or lambskin 
cape is worn. 

The Tibetans have adopted the Chinese Avaistcoat or kan-chien, a 
rather close-titting garment buttoning at the neck and down the right 
side under the arm, with no sleeves, and large armholes. This they 
make of native cloth {trulc) among the less civilized tribes, and in 
eastern Tibet it is nearly invariably of the striped pattern. It is worn 
next to the skin under the cWuha. The Chinese riding jacket {mu Ina- 
tzU), with short, wide sleeves and reaching down to a little above the 
waist, made of native cloth or of foreign broadcloth, is also often worn 
in central Tibet by officials and soldiers. 

As previously stated, the chhiha is the garment par excellence of all 
Tibetans, but only the pastoral tribes have strictly adhered to it; 
elsewhere the women more especially have adopted a modified costume. 
Thus, in parts of eastern Tibet, Bat'ang, for instance, over the ch'ubas, 
usually made of native cloth, but sometimes of blue cotton, they wear 
a kind of box-plaited i)etticoat reaching to the ankle and made of striped 
truk, or else an apron which nearly meets in the back. Others, as in 
Chala, wear a long sleeveless gowu over the cloth cWtiba, the two bound 
around the waist by a sash. 

In central Tibet the costume of the women of wealth is most elabo- 
rate, frequently of brocaded silk or satin, but the general style of dress 
is essentially the same, one or perhaps two long gowns, a shirt, and 
l^ossibly a kau-chien. The boots of men and women are the same, 
though wealthy women also frequently wear Chinese velvet boots. 

The men of Ladak wear a cloak (La-pa-sha) of wooleu, thick aud -warm. It is 
usually white, or rather it has ouce been white; for as the people only wash them- 
selves once a year, aud never wash their clothes, their cloaks are always of a dirty 
hue. Round their legs, from knee to ankle, they have coarse woolen leggings (rkang 
phying) of felt, fitting tightly, or else wrapped close round the leg and secm-ed by a 
garter (rkang-gduh), which is wound spirally round the leg from the ankle upward. 
The garter is generally black, but sometimes red. On their heads they wear either 
quilted skull caps, as tilthy as their cloaks, or capes of sheepskin with the wool 
inside, and with a large flap behind, which covers the back of the neck as well as 
the ears. Those in better circumstances have fur caps of the same shape. Their 
boots are of ftlt, with soles of sheep or goatskin, which are turned uji all round 
and sewn to the felt. The upper part of the felt boot is open to the front and is 
allowed to fall over, something in the manner of the boots worn in England in 
Chailes II's time. (Alex. Cunningham, Ladak, p. 303.) 

In Ladak the women wear a black woolen jacket with a large striped woolen 
petticoat of many colors, generally green, blue, red, and yellow, reaching below the 

LTiid leg. Over all they wear a sheepskin with the wool inside, secured, or rather 
=• ewered, in front by a large iron or brass needle. The poorest classes have the out- 

3 of the skin plain, but those in better circumstances cover it with coarse woolen

biii/c, cither red, l)liie, green, or yellow, with a broad border always of a different 
color. The ui)per classes cover this sheepskin cloak eitlier witli brocade <.r witli 
silk. (Cnniiinghani, loc. sup. cit.) 

In Hhiitan the dress is a loose woolen coat reaching to tlie knees, l)onnd round the 
waist by a thick fold of cotton cloth. The full front of the coat is used as a pocket 
and is well stored with bctelnut, prepared chununi, etc. The women's dress is like 
that of the Sikkiniese, a long (doak with loose sleeves. Their chief ornaments are 
am))er beads, corals with those who (;an afforilthem, and large pins. (Ashley Eden 
Report on the State of Hootan, pp. 129, LSO.) 

7/<r/.s.— Among the Kokoiior Tibetans, on accoimt of tlie custom pre- 
vailing' among- tlie men of sliaving- all the liair oil" tlie head, some head 
covei' is invariably worn. A low- pointed cap of green, red, or blue 
cloth or cotton and faced with lambskin is the most common head cover 
Avorn by men and women (pi. 3). Tiiis ca|> is also worn by the IMon- 
gols in this region, but the latter usually add to it a red tassel or fringe 
fixed to the apex and hanging all over the crown.* 

In winter the men wear a pointed cap of felt, sometimes covered with 
blue or red silk, with ear flaps, a large fla]) behind and one in front, 
which is frecpiently worn slightly inclined forward so as to make a 
visor. These flaps are covered with fox skin (pi. 4). The women and 
girls of all ages wear, winter and summer, the low-]»ointed cap described 
above, though many always go bareheaded. Some of the wealthy ones 
wear a round cap wadded or made of felt and covered with silk, with a 
wide turned-up brim faced with fur, fox, or sable. It is copied on the 
Mongol hat tor women, worn alike among the eastern as well as the 
western tribes of that race. 

The above are the hats peculiar to the Kokonor Tibetans, and the one 
shown in pi. 3, tig. 2 ai>i)ears, from Chinese works, to have been worn 
by them as early as the eighth century of our era. But besides these 
national ones, the Chinese felt hat is frequently worn by them, usually 
dark brown or black, with a brocaded band around the turned-up brim. 
This hat, which is very jK)|)ular throughout Tibet, is woin by both men 
and women. A turban nuide of a piece of rather coarse raw silk dyed 
purple, about ten feet long and a foot broad, is also frequently worn by 
the men among the Kokonor Tibetans and in all other ] tarts of the 
country. 

In those sections of Tibet where the men never trim their hair, and 
where it forms a thick and tangled mass falling over the shoulders, 
only cut in a fringe just over the eyes, the jworer people either wear 
no head cover at all or only a piece of cloth or sheepskin arranged so 
as to come down over the ears. This rude head cover has no top to the 
crown; the tangled hair under it is a sufiicient protection against the 
weather. A summer hat of a peculiar form is, however, worn in eastern 

* According to a Chinese work entitled Hsi-Tsang fu, p. 2, these Kokonor Tibetans 
are descended from Turkish tribes which used to live in the Altai Mountains, and 
who at that tune wore conical iron helmets shaped like the caps these Tibetans now 



wear.

and uortbern Tibet, and also by the Mongols of the Ts'aidam. That 
worn by the Mongols of the Ts'aidam (pi. 4, tig 3) is of felt, the crown a 
truncated cone about 8 inches high with a flat top and about U inches 
in diameter where it joins the brim, which is some 15 inches in diame- 
ter. The brim is usually faced with red or blue cotton, and a string, 
with a slipknot drawn tight under the chin, holds it on the head. The 
summer hat worn in Tibet, and called shara or chyar dja, is higher and 
heavier. The crown and brim are made of blades of coarse grass bound 
together with woolen thread; over this is sewn white cotton. The 
inside of the brim is faced with red cloth. A band of felt about an inch 
broad projects from the base of the crown, and the head fits in it. It 
is held on the head by a throatlatch, on which slides a bead as seen in fig. 
4. The specimen in the Museum is an exceptionally tine shara, made in 
Namru de,near the Tengri nor. The inhabitants of this district are noted 
for the quality of the summer hats they manufacture. This hat is not, 
as far as I am aware, used in central or western Tibet, but I have seen 
it in common use among the K'amba of eastern Tibet. (Land of the 
Lamas, pp. 182, 256.) 

The common fur-trimmed cap with a large flap behind and broad ear 
pieces, in general use in northern China and Mongolia (pi. 3, tig. 1), is 
manufactured in Peking for the trade; it is also in common use in Tibet. 
The Tibetan form is shown in pi. 4, fig. 1. In Lit'aug the men wear in 
summer a circular piece of white cotton cloth ornamented on the top 
with a blue-cloth disk, the center of which is red. A drawing string 
fixed in the lining enables them to fasten it on their heads, and their 
heavy queues are twisted around it. (Land of the Lamas, p. 243.) 

Ge<)rge Bogle, who visited Shigatse, in Ulterior Tibet, in 1774, thus 
describes the dress of the people of that country : 

The servants and peasants wear horizontal caps made of locks of sheeps' wool, 
dyed yellow. They are like the Scotch bonnets, but much larger. I never saw one 
above 3 feet in diameter. The women in the winter time cover their heads with 
small, rough caps of the same materials. Sometimes they dye them a deep blood-red. 
* ' " The higher laymen wear tunics of satin, brocaded or plain, lined with sheep 
and lamb skin or Siberian furs, a round cap faced with fur and crowned with a 
silk tassel, and Bulgar-hide boots. Red broadcloth tunics are also far from uncom- 
mon. The women wear a jacket and petticoat, reaching a little below the knee, of 
coarse blanket, or serge, striped or plain, or of Chinese satin, according to their con- * 
dition; Tatar stockings, soled with leather and gartered uuder the knee. When 
dressed, they have a piece of cloth thrown cloak -like over their shoulders. All ranks 
of them are at great pains in adorning their heads, plaiting their hair neatly enough 
with coral and amber beads, bugles, or pearls. They wear, also, necklaces of them, 
where the pieces of amber are sometimes as large as a hen's egg. The ((uantity of 
the two first kinds of Iteads that is on the head, even of a peasant's wife or daughter, 
IS amazing. The last two sorts fall to the share only of the ladies. (C. R. Markham, 
Narrative of the Mission of George Bogle, etc., p. 120.) 

Before passing to a description of the ornaments worn by Tibetans, 
it is necessary to describe the mode of wearing the hair, as most of the 
ornaments worn by the women are attached to their hair. 
H. Mis. 184, pt. 2 44 



690 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Among tlie men the bead is either entirely shaved, as among the 
Panaka of the Kokonor, or they follow, in central and parts of eastern 
Tibet, the Chinese fashion of shaving all the hair exce]»t on the crown, 
and doing that up into a queue, or else the hair is allowed to hang 
down naturally over the shoulders and is trimmed over the eyes, as 
among the Drupas. Among these latter a concession is usually made 
to Chinese ideas, and while wearing the hair in the last-mentioned way, 
a portion of it is i)laited into a queue, or a queue of false hair is fastened 
onto the shaggy mop of natural hair and tails down to the ground,* 

Among the women the national mode of arranging the hair, a mode 
which in slightly modified forms is found from Ladak to the Kokonor, 
is to make innumerable little plaits falling from the crown of the head 
down over the shoulders and reaching to the waist. (See Diary of a 
Journey, etc., p. 266.) In some parts of the country, as in Bat'ang, 
Chala (Ta-chien-lu), etc., the hair is worn in one big plait hanging 
down the back, Avhile in central Tibet (Lh'asa, Shigatse, etc) it is done 
up in two or three large plaits, worn either hanging down in front 
or more usually twisted around the head. In certain i)arts of Jyade 
a combination of the national headdress and the Chinese queue is 
the style adopted. The mode of dressing the hair does not vary in 
the same locality among the unmarried and married women, though the 
ornaments do, the married ones wearing many more, but among the 
males it is customary to keep boys' heads completely shaved till they 
are nearly nubile. 

Though the men among the ])astoral Tibetans take absolutely no 
care of tlieir hair, beyond rubbing occasionally a little butter on the 
scalp, by which means, they say, they keep out vermin and the skin is 
made healthier, the women devote much time to rearranging cheir fre- 
quently elaborate headdress, combing the hair (they use the coarse 
heavy woodeu Chinese combs) and in plaiting it once or more a week. 

The only Tibetan men who wear ornaments on their hair are to be 
found among the pastoral tribes, where a large queue, usually of false 
hair, is worn in addition to their full suit of tangled locks. On this 
queue, which terminates in a tassel of black silk and frequently reaches 
to the ground, they either string finger rings (pi. o, tigs. 10 and 11) and 
rings of ivory, or they sew on a narrow strip of red cloth big pieces of 
turquoise and small charm boxes, similar in shape and size to tig. 12. 
This band is fastened on the queue at about the height of the shoulders 
and reaches to the waist or lower. The queue is usually worn wound 
around the head, and the ornaments on it form a cro^vn, the big ivory 
ring being always in front. 

An earringis worn in the left ear by the men in most parts of Tibet. 
In the Kokonor it is a large gold or silver hoop about 2 inches in diam 

* E. H. Parker, China Review, x viii, p. 57, says : " Long before the Mongols existed 
as a State the Niicben Tartars were called inen-fa-cho ('queuo wearers') by the 
Chinese, and, like their kinsmen, the Manchiis, they made the Chinese they conquered 
shave their heads."

eter set with a coral or turquoise bead. (See pi. 6, figs. 4 and 6.) 
Althougb made iii Korluk Ts'aidam, the hitter is a Tibetau earring in 
shape and style. Frequently a little strap passes over the ear and 
takes the weight of the earring off of the lobe of the ear. A small disk 
of leather or bone fixed on the hoop presses against the ear, prevents 
the earring from turning, and keeps the jewels in front, which would 
without it fall to below the ear by their weight. 

Among the pastoral tribes of central Tibet (Namru, Jyade, etc.) the 
men, while sometimes wearing the above-described earring, wear also a 
larger one consisting of a pendant of gold or silver in the middle of 
which is a large coral bead. The lower part is a hoop, on which is fas 
tened a circular or heart-shaped plaque set with turquoises. (PI. 6, 
fig. 1.) This earring is about 3 inches long. A rough piece of tur- 
quoise is frequently tied to the right ear, without any setting whatever. 
This is a favorite ornament all over Tibet, even among the wealthy 
people in the most civilized parts of the country. 

In Lh'asa and other parts of central Tibet, besides the hoop pre- 
viously described, officials usually wear a plain gold hoop to which is 
fixed a pendant about 3 inches long, in the middle of which is a large 
pearl; m this pendant are set turquoises; the lower end is enameled a 
turquoise blue. (J. D. Hooker, Himalayan Journals, ii, p. 271, and 
Diary of Journey, etc., p. 230.) 

Around their necks most Tibetans wear charm boxes {gawo) of wood, 
silver, copper, or leather, in which arecarried charms against the various 
accidents which may overtake them. These charms are usually unin- 
telligible or meaningless Sanskrit words (see Emil Schlagintweit, Bud- 
dhism in Tibet, pp. 174, 254, etc.), or sometimes a copy of a short canon- 
ical work, as, for example, the "Diamond cutting sutra" {Dorje chodpai 
do). A bit of the gown of a saintly lama, a little of the tsamba left 
over from his meal and which has been molded into a small disk, on 
which is impressed the image of a god (on one in the Museum the 
image is that of Tsongk'apa), are also frequently kept in these gawo, 
together with painted images of some god or guardian saint, also a 
piece of peacock's feather, supi)osed to keep oft' moths. 

Some of these (/a ico are very elaboratel}- decorated. In the Museum 
collection is an oblong silver box (No. 130391)* 4^ inches long by 3 
inches broad and 1^ inches deep. On either side of the box is a silver 
tube, through which the cord passes by which the box is worn around 
the neck or fastened to a broad strap passed over one shoulder and 
under the other arm, by which means five or six such gcuro are carried, 
as is frequently the case. The decoration of this box consists in ara- 
besques, Chinese dragons, and the "eight signs of good luck" {trasJd 
tarjyd)A This gau-o was made at Lh'asa, but shows Chinese influence 
in its style of decoration.

Ou pi. o, tig-. 12, is shown a small gilt (/a wo set with turquoises. It is 
1^ inclies square. This (/awo is also of Lh^asa make, but is distinctly 
:N'ei>alese in its filagree style of ornamentation. Other (/awos showing 
this Kepalese style of ornamentation (the best silversmiths in Tibet are 
Nepalese and Chinese) are shown in Dr. J. D. Hooker's Himalayan 
Journals, i, pp. 170, 270. A small wooden gaico purchased in Mon- 
golia, containing a gilt terracotta image of a tutelary deity, is in the 
Museum collection. It is probably of Tibetan origin. 

The other ornaments worn by the men of Tibet are finger rings, whi<h 
are the same as those previously referred to as being worn on the queues, 
or else bands of chased silver in which are set turquoises or coral beads 
(pi. 5, figs. G-11). The women frequently wear a smaller gold ring set 
with a.cluster of small turquoises. These Tibetan rings are found nmoug 
the Mongols of the Ts'aidam, who obtain their jewelry from passing 
Tibetan travelers or when visiting Lh'asa or Trashilunpo on a pilgrim- 
age. Two of these rings shown on the plate mentioned are known to 
the Chinese in Tibet as the "Tibetan saddle ring," on account of their 
shape. They are chiefly made in Derge, in eastern Tibet (Laud of the 
Lamas, pp. 202, 227). 

I have seen in certain portions of Tibet (Miri, near Shobando, for 
instance) the men wearing necklaces of coral beads and a substance 
which I believe is onyx, and which is called by them ze. (Diary of a 
journey, etc., p. 275.) 

Most of the ornaments worn by Tibetan women are displayed on 
their hair. Among the Panaka of the Kokonor, where, as previously 
explained, the women's hair is plaited in innumerable little braids fall- 
ing from the crown of the head over their shoulders and back like a 
cloak, they have three broad bands of red satin or cloth fastened to 
the hair. On these are- attached embossed silver plates or cowrie 
shells, pieces of chank shell, and large pieces of red agate called "Chi- 
nese cornelian" {Han ma-nao) by Chinese traders, and which are said to 
be brought from Liao-tung. Besides these they wear turquoises, coral, 
or glass beads. Two of the bands begin at the height of the shoulders 
and the middle one at the waist; all of them reach down to the lower hem 
of the gown. The same kind of hoop earring as previously described 
is worn in both their ears, but most of the women wear none. 

Among the Iv amba of eastern Tibet the hair of the women is dressed 
in the same way as among the Panaka, but the usual ornaments are 
discoidal pieces of amber, in the center of which coral beads are fre- 
quently set. A number of these disks are worn on the crown of the 
head. On the bauds of cloth which de]iend from the plaits hanging 
down the back are also sewn similar amber disks or silver ornaments. 
(Land of the Lamas, p. 181.) 

In portions of eastern Tibet, more especially the Horba country, 
Lit'aug and Chala (Ta-chien-lu), the married women wear large gold or 
silver plaques on their heads, sometimes wearing one set in front or on 
the back of the head (as in Hoiba and Chala), sometimes one on either

side of the head and meeting over the crown, as in Lit'ang. Fig. 10 of 
pi, 5 is a silver one set with torquoises and coral, and is of the j)attern 
worn in Hor Chango (Land of the Lamas, 260). In fig. 13 of pi. 5 is 
represented the kind worn in Chala where such ornaments are called 
melong, pongi/il or A'o^-'or. In portions of western Tibet, where they 
are also the fashion, they are known as cJiirchir (j/?/?>--y^iV). 

In portions of the country, Mark'ams and the adjacent country, for 
example, where the women wear a long queue down their backs, large 
pieces of turquoise set in silver are worn fastened the whole length of 
the queue; between each consecutive piece is a small coral bead. (PI. 7.) 

Turner thus describes the dress of a Lh'asan lady of high rank, the 
mother of the infant Panch'en rinpoch'e lama: 

Her complexion was somewhat darker than her son's. She liad regular features, 
black eyes, and a character that particularly distinguishes ladies of rank in Tibet, 
the corners of the eyelids being extended as far as possible, by artificial means, 
toward the temples. Her hair was black, but scarcely visible, from the vast pro- 
fusion of ornaments that nearly covered it, consisting of pearls, rubies, emeralds, and 
coral. Pearls, intermixed with beads of gold, and some relics, constituted the orna- 
ments of her ears. Chaplets of larger gems hung round her neck, among which 
were balas rubies,* lapis-lazuli, amber, and coral in numerous wreaths, one chaplet 
beneath the other, descending to the waist. Her vest was close buttoned round 
the neck. A girdle embraced it round the waist, which was fastened by a golden 
buckle, having a large ruby in the center. A garnet-colored shawl, wrought with 
white stars, completed her dress, which descended to the knee. She wore bulgar 
boots. (Capt. Sam. Turner,.Embassy to the Court of the Teshoo Lama, p. 3.36.) 

Hue (Sou-venirs d'un Voyage, ii, p. 257), si^eaking of the women of 
Lh'asa, says: 

The Tibetan women's dress is very like that of the men. Over their gowns they 
wear a short jacket of many-colored stuff. They divide their hair in two plaits, 
which they let fall down on their shoulders. Women of low class wear a little yel- 
low cap, resembling somewhat the liberty cap which used to be worn under the 
French Eepublic. The grandes dames only ornament their heads with an elegant 
and graceful crown made of pearls. t 

The fashion in earrings among women varies considerably in Tibet 
from one locality or district to another. Besides those referred to on 
preceding pages, the Museum's collections contain several other vari- 
eties. On pi. 6, fig. 5, is shown a favorite style in central Tibet, 
Ch'amdo, and other districts. It is a large silver hoop over 2 inches in 
diameter, on the front of which is a heart-shaped plate thickly set with 
bits of turquoise. A small hook is attached to the plate and to the 
wearer's hair so as to take the weight of the ring oft" the ear. The pair 
in the Museum was worn by the native wife of a Chinese soldier sta- 
tioned near Ch'amdo, and jade rings, such as are worn on earrings in 



* A balas or balass ruby. The word halas is a corruption of Balal-hshi, a popular 
form of Badakhahi, because these rubies came from the famous mines on the upper 
Oxus, in one of the districts subject to Badakhshan. See H. Yule, Glossary of Anglo- 
Indian Words, p. 39. 

fFor further details, see Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc, n. s., xxiii, pp. 121-133 and pp. 
222-226, where I have translated all that is to be found in Chinese works on the 
subject. Also Dr. L. A. Waddell, The Buddhism of Tibet, p. 572. 



694 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Chiua, especially in tlie south, have beeu added to these by the Chinese 
husband. 

In tig. 3 of this plate is shown the Bat'aug style of earring, also worn 
in all Tibetan localities east of that district. It approaches more the 
Chinese style of earring than any other worn by Tibetans. It is fre- 
quently made of gold, but is invariably of the form here shown. The 
jewel in the lower part of it is also invariably a red coral bead. 

The silver earrings worn by the women of the Chin-cli'uan, a border 
district of Ssu-ch'uau inhabited by Tibetans, are shown in lig. 2. They 
are made by Chinese silversmiths, and represent the peculiar form of 
citron called in Chinese Fo-shou, on "Buddha's hand." 

The shirts described previously (p. 086) are buckled at the throat 
in eastern Tibet, when worn by women, with gold or silver buckles set 
with coral beads and turquoises. This buckle is sewn on to the shirt. 
A very fine specimen in gold, of Nepalese workmanshii), is shown in 
fig. 2 of pi. 5. It was made in Lh'asa for a wealthy woman of Ta-chieu-lu 
(Chala). Figs. 3 and 5 of pi. o are of silver set with turquoises and 
small coral beads. The design is in one case butterflies, in the other an 
open lotus fiower. These were purchased in the Horba country in 
eastern Tibet. 

Two small buttons of coral linked together by a gold or silver orna- 
ment are also much used in eastern Tibet on the shirts worn by women 
to fasten them at the shoulder and take the place of buttons. Fig. 4 in 
pi. 5 shows one of these linked shirt buttons. 

In central and western Tibet the shawl [Jiiulri) worn by the women 
is held together in front by a broad breastpin of gold or silver, called, 
I believe, chah-pang. A picture of one of these buckles is given by 
Dr. Hooker. {Op. cit., ii, p. 195.) 

Capt. Gerard, speaking of the people of Spiti in the extreme western 
part of Tibet, says : 

The womeu were literally almost weighed down and groaning under a load of 
ornaments, such as immense anklets and bracelets of silver or pewter, heavy ear- 
rings, metal chains of various kinds, beads of silver, precious stones, colored glass, 
and cowrie shells strung around the necks, ankles, and arms, and attached to different 
parts of their dress. 

The Tartars of both sexes are A'ery fond of ornaments, and they wear as many as 
they can afford to purchase, some laying out large sums upon their pipes, knives, 
and trinkets of all sorts. They have necklaces upon which are strung large irregular 
pieces of a yellow substance called Posliel, * which looks like amber, and when rubbed 
attracts feathers. They have beads of coral and other precious stones which resemble 
rubies, emeralds, and topazes, and have tassels of red beads hanging from the back 
part of their caps. (Capt. Alex. Gerard, Account of Koonawur, Vol. iii.) 

Capt. Alexander Cunningham (Ladak, p. 304), speaking of the Ladaki 
women, says: 

Their heads are always bare, the hair being arranged in a border of narrow plaits, 
■which hang round the head like a long fringe. From the forehead, over the division 



*Spos-8liel (pronounced 2>t;-s/«7) is the Tibetan word for amber. It means literally

of the hair, they all wear a long narrow band of cloth studded with coarse many- 
flawed turquoises, which hangs down behind as low as the waist, and is usually tiuished 
off with a tassel of wool or a bunch of cowries. The ears are covered with semicircular 
woolen lappets, fastened to the hair and edged with brown or black fur, generally 
of the otter skin, called Kunduz.* These ear flaps are always red, the inside being 
woolen, and the outside brocade. These are made coarse or flue according to cir- 
cumstances, for the Ladaki women seem to pride themselves upon the style and 
material of these lappets just iis much as European ladies do upon the fashion of 
their bonnets. 

These " ear lappets," I may add, are commonly worn in northern 
China, where they are known as erh mao. 

Although rosaries {treng-wa) belong properly to the chapter on objects 
used in religious worship and will be more fully described in that 
connection, they are considered by all Tibetans as not only indispensa- 
ble in their daily devotions, but as ornaments, and are also used by 
many as a means of reckoning sums. (Land of the Lamas, p. 253.) They 
are worn by both men and women around the neck or on the wrist, and 
have invariably 108 beads. Some are made of ivory, others of seeds, 
of wood, of bone, of coral, turquoises, crystal, or glass. 

Throughout northern and eastern Tibet most people carry a needlecase 
(kab-cho), suspended to a silver or brass chatelaine frequently of 
elaborate workmanship, to which is attached a short broad leather 
strap, through which the belt or sash passes. (Land of the Lamas, p. 166 
and pi. 11.) A Chinese chatelaine (Xo. 167222)t is in the Museum collec- 
tion. These needlecases are usually flat, bell-shaped, and made of red 
leather. The interior case can be pulled out by means of a strap or tassel 
from the cover, which is open along the lower edge (pi. 8.) Another form 
of needlecase, manufactured in Derge, is a narrow iron case with a sliding 
top held in -place by a spring, and is often highly ornamented (pi. 10). 

Another article, frequently most elaborately ornamented and worn 
by all Tibetans and hanging from the same chatelaine to which the 
needlecase is attached, is a tinder | and flint pouch on the lower edge 

* Probably the name of the country from which they are obtained. 

t Not illustrated in this paper. 

t The tinder is made from the flowers of a small plant of the edelweiss family. It 
ifi cixUed pai jxio-tzii in Chinese. Moorcroft (Travels, 1, 408) thus describes the prejia- 
ration of tinder in Ladak: 

"At Undiir or iShak-than Ring-juo (in Ladakli) I witnessed the preparation of a 
peculiar kind of tinder. A small shrub, not above an inch and a half high when in 
flower, was gathered and placed on the bottom of a dry iron vessel over a Are. As 
the hairy heads expanded they were plucked off and thrown away. The ])lants were 
repeatedly turned over to prevent their being burnt. When considered sufficiently 
dry the pan was inverted, and the leaves, placed on its l>lackeued under surface, were 
beaten upon it with a small stick until well impregnated with the soot, any loose dirt 
being carefully blown ott". In this state the slightest sjiark was sufficient to ignite the 
preparation. This substance, wrapj>ed up in a thin roll of paper, is also used as 
moxa, or as actual cautery, pieces about three-fourths of an inch thick being laid 
upon the skin and set fire to. This is a favorite application for pain in the stomach." 
I have myself seen it prepared in exactly the same way among the Panaka of the 
Kokonor and the K'amba of eastern Tibet. Insteadof soot they mixed a little very fine 
gunpowder with the parched and crushed plant.

of which is a steel. These are called me-clian (written me Icliags) and 
are in common use all over Til >et, China, and Mongolia. The Chiuese style 
of tinder pouch shown in Dr. Hooker's work (Himalayan Journals, ii, 
p. 219) as existing- in Sikkim, has been found by other travelers in 
Bhutan and even among the Abors and Mishmis. The Tibetan me-chag 
is of two styles, the Dergc and Pomiid forms. The first is always 
decorated with silver bosses, coral, and turquoise beads, and is of 
either red cloth or leather. (pLO, fig. 2.) The Pomiid kind, as shown 
in the specimen m the Museum collection, is a beautiful piece of work 
iu open gold and silver, in which are set 3 large beads, 2 of coral, 
and 1 of turquoise. The poucli is of red cloth, and is 5i inches long 
and 2^ inches broad. An embroidered cloth case fits over it to protect 
it from the weather (pi. 0, fig. 4) In pi. 0, fig. 3. and another specimen 
not here illustrated* are me-chag of Mongol manufacture, and were prob- 
ably made in eastern Mongolia among the Halhas, though the former is 
Tibetan in its style of decoration. 

Another orimment sometimes worn in eastern Tibet by women is 
shown in pi. 0, fig. 1. It consists of a toothpick, ear spoon, and tweez- 
ers, the latter, however, being only used as a toothi)ick. It is attached 
to the gown by a ring at the end of a silver chain; the implements 
hang by a few links of chain to a half rupee surrounded by silver work, 
in which are set coral and turquoise beads. 

A short knite is carried suspended from the belt of all Tibetans; 
with it they cut their meat. The scabbard in some cases is highly 
orminiented; especially is this the case with knives of Derge make (pi. 10 j. 

A finely-ornamented belt with knife, needlecase, and strike-alight, 
belonging to the writer, and of Derge manufacture, is shown iu j)l. 10. 

The knife used in the Kokonor region is 0| inches long — the blade, 
which is of iron, 5J. The handle is of horn, andiron and copper wires 
are inlet into it ; the scabbard is of iron. These knives are made in two or 
three localities along the Kokonor border by Chiuese blacksmiths. The 
knives from Shang-wu-chuang (about 20 miles from Hsi-ning in Kan-su) 
are especially prized, as are also the swords coming from the same 
locality (see Diarj- of a Journey, etc., p. 104). The products of this 
locality are recognizable by the damascening on the blades. The people 
in this locality are a mixed Chinese-Turkish race, and this industry was 
Ijrobabl}' brought here from Turkestan. 

In the more civilized portions of Tibet the Chinese knife and chop- 
sticks are frequently used, the case often richly ornamented with 
embossed silver, the handle of the knife and the ends of the chopsticks 
being also covered with worked silver (pi. 11, right-hand figures). 

As a general rule Tibetans allow no hair to grow on their faces, but 
pluck out the few" hairs growing on them as they appear with tweezers 
[chyanintser), which they carry suspended around their neck or from their

belt or prayer beads. * In the more civilized portions of the country, 
especially in the south and near China and India, it is not uncommon to 
see men wearing- a mustache, aud in some instances, among- lamas 
especially, I have seen men wearing full beards, some quite thick and 
long. Chinese razors, or the sheath knives above referred to, are used 
to shave the head and face. I have seen no razor of native manufacture. 

Dr. Griffiths, speaking of the ornaments worn by the women of Bhu- 
tan, says that they "wear a plate of silver fastened round the head and 
crossing on the upper part of the forehead, wire earrings of large dimen- 
sions, and peculiar rings fastened to a straight silver wire, and worn 
projecting beyond the shoulder." (William Griffiths, Journal of the 
Mission to Bootan in 1837-'38, p. IGO.) 

Dr. Hooker (Himalayan Journals, ii, p. 86) describes as follows the 
dress of some Tibetan women from K'amba djong,t a district to the 
north of Sikkim, witliiii the confines of Ulterior Tibet (Tsang): 

The men were dressed as usual in the bhinket cloak, with brass pipes, long knives, 
flint, steel, aud amulets; the women wore similar but shorter cloaks, with silver and 
copper girdles, trousers, aud flannel boots. Their headdresses were very remark- 
able. A circular band of plaited yak's hair was attached to the back hair, aud encir- 
cled the head like a saint's glory, at some distance round it. A band covered the 
forehead, from which coins, corals, and turquoises hung down to the eyebrows, 
while lappets of these ornaments fell over the ears. Their own hair was plaited iu 
two braids brought over the shoulders, aud fastened together in front, aud a little 
yellow felt cap, traversely elongated, so as not to interfere with the shape of the 
glory, was perched on the head. 

This mode of dressing the hair, as well as that of Bhutan referred to 
by Griffiths, are but modilicatioiis of the crowns worn at Lh'asa. 

Tattooing as a means of ornamentation is hardly ever practiced by 
Tibetans. I have seen a few men from Lh'asa, or the adjacent coun- 
tries, who had a "hooked cross" [yung-drunij) tattooed on the back 
of their hands near the thumb, and some others with a round dot or 
two tattooed at the same place, but beyond this I have neither read nor 
heard of any tattooing among tins people. The jiersons on whom I 
saw tattooing were traders, who had frequently visited China and India, 
where tattooing is known and practiced to a limited extent, and in 
either one of these countries, or by a man from one of these countries 
residing- in their own, they may have had the marks on their persons done. 
Weavinfj. — Although according to Tibetan accounts (see p. OTi') the 
art of weaving was only introduced into this country iu the seventh 
century, after intimate relations with China had been established, we 
may on good grounds doubt the accuracy of this tradition, for the Sui 
shu, or Chronicles of the Sui dynasty (A. D. 589-618) Bk. 83, speaking 
of the Tibetan T'ang-hsiang tribes, says: "They weave yak and goat 



* Du Plan Carpin (Historia Mongalorum, 658) says of the people of Tibet (his Terra 
Biirithabet) : " Isti pilos iu barba uon habent: imo quoddam ferrum iu manibus por- 
tant, sicut vidimus, cum quo semper barbam depilant, si forte aliquis crinis crescit 
in ipsa." 

t These Tibetans are black-tent dwellers and originally came from northeast Tibet. 



698 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

hair aud sheep's wool, aud make tents/' aud the Aunals of the Tnng 
dynasty (T'ang shu, Bk. i*21), which covers the period from A. i). 618 
to 907, says of these same people, "Men aud women wear long skin 
gowns, or gowns of coarse woolen stuff with a nappy surface." 

Among the pastoral Tibetans of the present day cloth is woven from 
the hair of yaks and goats and from the wool of sheep. The wool is 
cut oft' the sheep with a knife and isof very irregular staple; very gen- 
erally it is not washed before it is s])un into yarn. The usual occupa- 
tion of pastoral Tibetan men and women, or perhaps one may call it 
their usual amusement, is spinning yarn. They carry a small package 
of wool or yak hair in the bosom of their gowns and twist the yarn as 
they walk along herding their sheep, or when sitting in their tents 
over their tea. The spindle, of which a specimen is in the nniseum 
(see Diary of a Journey, etc., p. 132), is about 11^ to 12 inches long and 
consists of a straight wooden rod with a notch at the end in which 
the yarn is caught, and terminates at the lower end in a flattened clay 
whorl about 2 inches in diameter. 

Sometimes the clay whorl is replaced by two sticks at right angles, 
and a little iron hook is fixed in the end of the rod instead of the notch 
above referred to. There is in the collection even a more primitive spindle, 
ill which the whorl is a short bone and the rod has a fork at the end on 
which the yarn catches. This spindle was collected among the Ordos 
Mongols, who spin and weave, by the way, exactly as the Tibetans do, 
though they practice the latter art to a much less extent (see Diary of 
a Journey, etc., p. 22). 

The loom usually used in Tibet is of extreme simplicity; it is also in 
use in Mongolia and generally in the border country of northern China. 
The warp, which is hardly ever over 10 inches to a foot broad aud about 
40 to 50 feet long, is fastened to the ground by large pegs at either end; 
the weaver squats over this and pushes the balls of thread through the 
warp; two or three blows from a heavy wooden batten are given on each 
thread of the woof, aud the alternate threads of the woof are kept 
separated by two small sticks and the batten itself. The part of the 
warp near the weaver is kept raised to a convenient height from the 
ground by either a little rounded piece of wood raised on feet and placed 
under it, or else by a big stone. The woof, according to Jaeschke 
(Tib. Engl. Diet., p. 331), is called ^>M>t {sjmii), the spindle, [pang] and 
the whorl ( pang-lo). In this primitive fashion the material for the black 
hair tents of the pastoral tribes is woven, and also the woolen material 
used to make clothes, boot-linings, bags, etc. This latter stuff", which 
is always used undyed, is called la-iru, or ta in some sections of the 
country, and is sometimes quite fine. The coarser varieties, all man- 
ufactured by the Kokonor Tibetans, are represented in the Museum's 
collections by Xos. 13120S, 1(37202, and 167203,* in the last there are 
narrow bands of l)lack wool.

NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 699 

In some parts of tlie country a rude vertical loom (called, I believe, tag- 
tan written htag-sfan) is used, but, as far as my uui^racticed eye could 
discern, it showed no material difference in the mode of weaving from 
that above described. Jaeschke (Tib. Engl. Diet., s. v. dong po) speaks 
of a shuttle made of a piece of bamboo called dong po. This implement, 
which I have never seen used, may be common in western Tibet, where 
that missionary resided, but in all parts visited by me the yarn was 
made up into balls. The woof in the vertical looms is wrapped around 
two rollers so that the weaving may be done in a confined space, but I 
noticed no such mechanical devices as I was expecting to find for 
drawing up the parts of the warp as required, but only snmll sticks, 
varying in number, as in the ruder loom previously referred to. This 
loom has unquestionably been borrowed from China, audit ishighly prob- 
able that in many parts of Tibet the one in use is of the pattern usual 
in China; unfortunately, I can find no description of one in any works 
to which I have access, and my own knowledge of the subject is too 
limited to make a description of it intelligible. 

Father Desgodins says: 

111 Tibet the professioii of weaver, called Ta-keii (htag-mk'an), is coutiiied to the 
■women. The loom employed is not complicated; it has ouly the essential elements 
usually found in such appliances. 

Nearly all the woolen stntfs are diagonals. The pieces are from 30 to 35 centime- 
ters broad, often less, and 10 meters long. They are thick and rather coarse, for the 
surface is not shorn as is done with cloth with us, but they are very warm and nearly 
waterproof. 

I have been told of a woolen stuff, very line and rather loosely woven, called 
tirma. It is a very fine texture, and resembles somewhat the stuff we call serge; it 
is frequently used to make the scarfs worn by the lamas over their shoulders during 
prayers; it is, I believe, the most expensive tissue they manufacture. They do not 
know how to weave wide stufts as in Europe, but all the little narrow strips are 
afterwards sewn together with woolen thread, and look very well, though they would 
not suit French taste. (Desgodins, Le Thibet, p. 390.) 

The cloth most commonly used in Tibet is that called prug (pro- 
nounced tntJi-), but which is perhaps better known under its Chinese 
name of j)?</o, a transcription, I take it, of the native name. It is chiefly 
manufactured in Ulterior Tibet, near the city of Shigatse (see Turner, 
Embassy to the Court of the Teshoo lama, p. 225), whence it is exported 
to all parts of Tibet, to Mongolia and China. The principal colors are 
red, purple, blue, white stamped with crosses, narrow stripes of blue, 
yellow, green, etc., running across the stuft", or a combination of the 
stripes and crosses. (PI. 12.) 

The price of pulo varies from an ounce of silver a piece to 30 or 40 
ounces for the finest kinds. It is usually 10 or 11 braces {damha) long. 

The variety of cloth called tirma, mostly used, as Father Desgodins 
remarks, for lamas' shawls, is invariably dyed red. It is of the same 
width as the tnd-, about 9 inches, a good sample of it is in the Museum 
collection. 

In Po-yul, in southern Tibet, a very closely woven stuff, which is 



700 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

quite waterproof, is woven by the natives. It is extremely narrow, 
about 4i to 5 inches in breadth, and in it are narrow stripes of red, 
white, green, blue, and yellow. This stuft' is very much prized. The 
women make their aprons and skirts of it in some portions of the 
country (Mark'anis and Bat'ang for instance), and blankets of it are in 
great demand, 13 bands of the stuff being sewn together to make a 
blanket, never more or less. 

I have found but few notices concerning Tibetan weaving in books 
accessible to me. William IMoorecroft, however, gives some interest- 
ing details on the methods of weaving of the northern Ladakis: 

To the northward a coarse loom is iu use, little unlike in its parts to the cue com- 
mon in Europe. Here the two ends of the warp are fastened together, and it is then 
stretched upon two rods, one tixed to the body of the weaver (who is invariably a 
woman) by a cord, which admits of the work lieing loosened or tightened at pleas- 
ure, and the other well fastened to some stones at a distance equal to half the length 
of the cloth. The whole is close to the ground, on which the work woman sits, but 
the porti(m close to her is slightly elevated by a third rod. Loops, each including a 
thread, and received upon a small stick like a rattan, supply the place of a heddle;^ 
of these there are three sets, which draw up parts of the warp alternately as 
required. A large heavy mash, into which a thin bar of iron is inserted, is a substi- 
tute for the reed, and three or more heavy strokes are made with its armed edge upon 
every thread of the woof. The last instrument must be taken out after«the inser- 
tion of each piece of yarn, and when placed perpendicularly, with its two edges 
8ei)arating the warp, abundance of room is given for the passage of the balls of 
worsted made use of, without the covering of a shuttle. This part of the process is 
tedious, but the warp is prepared in a quick and simple way. Several pegs are driven 
into the ground so near each other that the whole may be reached without any 
material movement of the body; the yarn is fastened to one of them, and carried on 
round the others till a sutiicient quantity has been wound; all are then taken olf 
except three, which have their places supjilied by rods, and the warp only requires 
spreading. - >* * Each piece is about 17 inches broad, and the average length 
may be stated at 74 yards. * * * Very good sacking is also made of the hair and 
wool taken from the yak. (Travels in the Himalayan Provinces of Hindoostan, 
etc., II, pp. 72-74.) 

Felt {chyin(i-j)(() is also largely used in Tibet. Its mode of manufacture 
is extremely simple. The wool, having been first picked over, is s])read 
out a handful at a time on a large piece of felt on the ground, each hand- 
ful overlapping the preceding one iu such a way that a piece of uniform 
thickness and of whatever size is desii'cd is made. This is rolled up 
tightly and with much pounding of the closed tist and then unrolled, 
and this work is kept up for an hour or more; then the roll is soaked in 
water and the work of rolling, unrolling, kneading, and beating with 
the closed fist goes on for another hour or two. I was told that a piece 
of felt had to be kneaded at least 1,000 times before it was ready for use. 
After the roll has been left to dry for a while it is opened, and by pulling 
it slightly in different directions the surface is made smooth, and the 
edges are trimmed with a knife. Sometimes it is bleached. Altogether, 
Tibetan and Mongol felt is vastly inferior to that made by the Chinese. 



The Navajo loom, I take it, resembles this one very closely.

NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 701 

There are fairly good specimens of Tibetan, Chinese, and Mongol felts in 
the Museum's collection. A specimen of tine Chinese felt formed into 
a pair of socks by the Eastern Mongols is also in the Museum. It was 
made at Chang-chia k'ou (Kalgan). 

All the cotton stuffs used in Tibet are broughtthere either from China 
or India, as are also the silks, satins, broadcloths, etc., there made 
use of. 

Dyeing. — Desgodins says : 

Th« profession iu which Tibetans excel is that of dyeing; not that there are artists 
specially given to this work, for every family can dye the stuffs woven iu the house. 
Vegetable dyes are nearly exclusively used, and they know how to fix the colors so 
wtiU that they are practically permanent. * * * To dye red they use a kind of 
garance ten and ka, which imparts to the former a deeper but very tine color. I am 
unable to say what this latter substance is. With the refuse of Art they make sealing 
wax lagiiia. * For dyeing yellow a very bitter root is used, which is also used iu med- 
icine for inflammatory diseases; they call it chiruj-tsa and the Chinese linaii(i-lien. 
ludigo, which they call ram, comes to them from India, but they can also get it from 
certain of the warm valleys of their country. * » * Sometimes they paint on the 
stuffs flowers and princi])ally crosses. These colored stuffs are then called Laoua- 
chra-cha or diru-clui according as the stufl' is laoua or chrit. (Desgodins, Le Thibet, 
pp. 391, 392.) 

The dye called ten by Desgodins is possibly the tztl-ts'ao of the 
Chinese [Anclmsa tinctoria:^), and huang-Uen is the Picrorhiza kurroa 
(Eoyle). Dr. Hooker (Himalayan Journals, p. 41) says that the leaves 
of a shrub {symplocos) are dried in Sikkim to be sent to Tibet, where 
they are used as a yellow dye. I have seen in parts of Tibet (west of 
Ch'amdo) people gathering a yellow gooseberry which, 1 was told, su])- 
plied a yeUow dye, and the root of the rhubarb i)lant is also used to 
supply that color in parts of Tibet and in the Ts'aidam. I have been 
unable to learn where the Tibetans get their brown or green colors. 
The latter are especially line. In northwest China a fine brown is 
obtained from the acorns of the holly-leafed oak {ching Wayig in Chinese). 
Possibly this is used by Tibetans, for the tree is very abundant in 
many places of eastern and southern Tibet. 

According to Abbe Hue (Souvenirs, ii, p. 208), the Xepalese at 
Lh'asa do most of the dyeing, but, he adds, they are only allowed to 
dye native cloths, and all imported stuffs must be used as received 
there, this being done to encourage the consumption of native jjroducts. 

V. 

HABITATIONS — HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS — FOOD — TOBACCO. * 

The i)astoral Tibetans throughout the country inhabit tents made of 
yak hair. The Tibetan tents are rectangular, with a tlat roof. Some of 
them are not more than 10 or 12 feet long, but I have seen many 50 feet 
long by 30 feet broad. A space about 2 feet wide is left open along the 
center of the top to admit light and let smoke escape. Under it is a

702 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

ridge pole supported at each end by vertical posts. These are the only 
posts used for holding up the tent. The roof is stretched by cords 
whicli are fastened outside to the sides and corners, and which, passing 
over short ])oles some distance from the tent, are pegged to the ground. 
The lower edge of the tent is held down by iron pins or by horns of the 
Antilope Hodgson i. Hue most felicitously compares these tents to huge 
black spiders with long thin legs, their bodies resting upon the ground. 
Sometimes to keep off the wind and snow the inmates build a low wall 
of mud and stones, or else of dry dung, around the outsule of the tent, 
or, when large enough, inside of it; but they do not frequently resort 
to this ex])edient m the Kokonor section, where there is but little snow. 

In the center of the tent is a long, luurow stove made of mud and 
stones, with a fireplace in one end and a flue passing along its whole 
length, so that several pots may be kept boiling at the same time. 
These stoves, in which only manure is burnt, have sufficient draft to 
render the use of bellows needless, and are altogether a most ingenious 
contrivance (see Diary of a Journey, etc., p. 123). Around the walls of 
the tents are piled up leather bags in which the occupants keep their 
food; also saddles, pieces of felt, and innumerable odds and ends, of 
which only the owner knows the use and value. A small stone or birch- 
wood mortar for pounding tea, a wooden tea churn about 2 feet high — 
made of a hollowed log and hooi)ed with wood (i>l. 14, fig. 9). or out of 
a joint of bamboo, which are, in some parts, used also to churn butter 
in — a few small and very dirty wooden milk pails with handles of plaited 
yak hair ( see Diary of a Journey, etc., p. 204), a log or two of wood roughly 
squared, and which take the place of tables, and a small quern are the 
principal articles of furniture in these "black tents." 

Food.— The food of the tent-dwelling Tibetans consists principally of 
tea and parched barley or tsamha; the barley they buy from the agri- 
cultural Tibetans in exchange for butter, hides, or wool. The prepara- 
tion of tsamha is not ditticult. The grain is parched in a pan and 
winnowed, when most of the husk falls oft"; after this it is ground in a 
small quern, when it is ready for use. The flavor of tsamba depends 
on the browning or roasting of the grain, and on the fineness of the 
meal. When it is too fine it is not considered good, nor is it liked 
when it is ground in a large water mill, altliough large quantities of it 
are prepared by the Chinese for the Kokonor Tibetans in this way. 
The Museum has several samples of tsamba. The meal Avhen ready for 
use is kept in small bags {tsam kuJi), some of cloth, others of red 
leather, the lower part of the bag being sometimes covered with mar- 
mot or leopard skin {i)l. 14, fig. 4). The other articles of diet of these 
people are mutton and, occasionally, game, sour milk (sho or taral), 
granulated cheese {chura), cream cheese (jrima), the root of the poten- 
tilla anserina {chotmia), and, occasionally, vermicelli (hua-mien) and 
wheaten cakes [pale or Icore). (See also Diary of a Journey, etc., pp. 
239, 274, and 278.)

Articles used in making Tea. 



NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 703 

Tea is, however, tlie principal article of food amoug all Tibetans. It 
is not simply tlie beverage but the food of tbis people, for it is nearly 
invariably taken mixed with butter and tsamba and the leaves are not 
infre(iuently eaten. For a full description of the "brick tea "used in 
Tibet and its mode of preparation 1 must refer the reader to tbe account 
I have pubhshed elsewhere.* Tbe Museum collection contains a num- 
ber of specimens of brick tea of various grades (pi. 14, fig. 7, shows one). 
I shall oidy describe here the way in which the beverage is prepared. 

Tea, previously reduced to powder in a mortar, is put in the kettle 
(Diary of a Journey, etc., p. 96, figs. 1 and 4) when the water is hot, but 
before it is boiling, and is left to boil for about five minutes. Freipiently 
a little concentrated extract of tea, kept for the purpose in a small tea- 
pot, is added to give additional flavor, and a little salt or soda is also 
thrown in. Sometimes it is partaken of at this stage of its preparation, 
but much more generally it is poured through a small bamboo strainer 
called ja-ts'ag (pi, 14, fig. 2) into one of the i^reviously described tea 
churns {dong-mo), and a chunk of butter and alittle tsamba having been 
added, it is vigorously churned for a minute or so, when it is ]>oured into 
tea-pots of earthenware or metal (pi. 14, figs. 1 and 5, and pi. 15) and is 
then ready to be drunk. Each one draws from the bosom of his gown 
a little wooden bowl {purba), frequently lined or otherwise ornamented 
with silver (pi. 14, fig. 3), and, a little tea having first been sprinkled 
toward the four cardinal points as an ofl'ering to the gods, the bowls 
are filled. Taking with his fingers a chunk of butter from a sheep's 
paunch in which it is kept, or from a wooden butter box i^marpa) (pi. 14, 
fig. 0), the drinker lets it melt in his bowl, drinking the while some of 
the tea and blowing the melted butter to one side. When but a little 
tea is left in the bottom of the bowl, a handful of tsamba is added, and 
tbe tea, butter, and meal are deftly worked into a ball with the right 
hand, the bowl being meanwhile slowly turned around in the lett. The 
resulting lump of brown d<mgh, which is of a rather agreeable taste, if 
the butter is not too rancid, is then eaten, and enough tea is drunk to 
wash down the sodden lump. When dried cheese [chura) is eaten it is 
first soaked in tea and then eaten with buttered tea and tsamba. \ 

The Tibetans of all parts of the country make tea as above described, 
and eat their tsamba in tbis way. They have no regular meals; tbe 
kettle is always kept full of tea and each one takes tea when he is 
hungry. I Those who, like lamas reading the sacred books and others, 
are continually emjiloyed during the day, keep beside them a pot of 



*LaiKl of the Lamas, pp. 278-281 and p. 310, and also to E. Collioiirne Baber's 
Travels and Reseax'cbes in Western China, p. 192 et seq. 

tFre(ineutly, also, the tea is drunU plain with the addition of about a fifth its 
volume of milk. 

tin Knnduz the people use Keimiik chali or cream tea; fat is sometimes added 
and salt is the uniform substitute for sugar. (Wood, Journey to the Source of the 
Oxus, p. 143, 2"' edit.) Milk tea is or was served a taudiences given by the Emperor 
of China. 



704 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

tea on a heap of hot ashes or a little hmsero, and occasionally give it a 
stirring up Avith a small churning stick (pi. 14, tig. 8) resembling that 
used in chocolate pots with us. 

When one has eaten sour milk {sito or taral-), or anything which soils 
the bowl, it is customary to lick it clean before putting it back in the 
gown. 

If mutton or any other meat forms part of the meal, it is boiled in 
the same kettle in which the tea is prepared, and each one picks out a 
piece from the pot and holds it in his hand, cutting mouthfuls oft" it 
with his sheath knife and carefully removing every particle of meat 
from the bone. The Kokonor Tibetans and the K'ambas have a saying 
to the effect that one can Judge of the way a man will manage impor. 
tant business by seeing him pick a bone. (Land of the Lamas, 79-80.) 

Butter is nmde either in the tea churn or in a goatskin bag roughly 
shaken about. Dr. Hooker ( Himalayan Jouinals, ii, p. 77), speaking of 
some black-tent Tibetans he visited in Upper Sikkim, says: 

The ohiirus vi-eve of two kinds, cue being an oblong box of birch bavk, or close 
bamboo wickei'work, full of branched rhododendron twigs, in which the cream is 
shaken. - ^ » xhe other churn was a goatskin, which was rolled about and 
shaken by the i'onv legs. The butter is made into great squares and packed in yak 
haircloths; the curd is eaten either fresh or dried and pulverized (when it is called 
"Tschenzip"). 

Wherever I have traveled in Tibet I have found the butter made 
into balls, sometimes weighing L'O pounds or more; it is sewed up in a 
sheep's i)auuch or wrapped in a bit of goatskin with the hair left on. 
Dr. Hooker's Tschenzip is perhaps better known as chura; it is not 
used to any great extent except among the tent dwellers. 

Moorcroft (Travels, ii, p. 79) says: 

At Kinar (in Ladak) I first learned that dahi, or curdled milk, is churned into but- 
ter, and found a pail employed as a churn, the churning stick being supported by 
two arms fastened to a post and turned by a rope, as in Hindostan. The natives 
affirm that butter made from milk in the tirst instance disagrees with them. 

The teapots used by Tibetans are of earthenware or metal, and, 
though the ornamentation on them varies somewhat in different locali- 
ties, the general shape is everywhere the same — a very narrow neck, 
a large globular body, and a rather small base. The spout is most fre- 
quently ornamented so as to represent a dragon's head, the extremity of 
the spout projecting from out the mouth. A metallic cover is attached 
by a chain to the handle, in which, in the case of earthenware tea- 
X)ots, a hole is made for the extremity of the chain. In some of the 
earthenware teapots, especially those from Lit'ang and farther east, 
irregular cubes of broken chinaware are pressed into the parts so as 
to form a rough kind of ornamentation. The mouth, spout, and handle 
of these teapots are luted on, and there are lines grooved around the 
neck and body of the pot, the lines on the latter part being usually 
vertical. Some pots are made of black earth, but most of them of 
coarse red<lish clay, in which there is a good deal of mica, ami all are 
very porous. Before being used, earthenware pots are slightly heated

Earthenware Teapots 



NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 705 

and well rubbed with butter. Good specimens of earthenware teapots 
are shown on pi. 15.* The best metal teapots are made in Derg6 in 
eastern Tibet, and in many of them brass, copper, and silver are com. 
bined so as to produce a highly ornamental effect. A Derge j)ot of 
wrought brass is in the collection, and on pi. 14, fig. 5 is shown a tea- 
pot of copper with chased spout and handle; both have highly orna- 
mental tops. Several teapots in my private collection are of silver and 
brass, and show much taste and great cleverness in execution. 

Throughout Tibet it is not uncommon to now and then find poor people 
reduced to using a substitute for tea — chips of wood, roasted pease, or 
willow leaves, anything, in fact, which can impart a little coh>r and slight 
astringent taste to their drink. 

Among the Kongwa Tibetans of northwest Kan-su it is customary to 
eat tsamha dry, with a small spoon. (PI. 14, tig. 'Sa.) They throw a 
little meal into their mouths, taking it from a large bowl placed before 
them, and then wash the dry stuff' down with a guli) of tea from their 
wooden bowls. 

Dr. Griffiths says of the people of Bhutan: 

They use brick tea from Tibet and make rungapah, a substitute prepared from the 
leafofapearormcdlar; also c/faw;/, made from rice. (Dr.W. Griffiths, ojj.sHi^.d/., p. 167.) 

In the more civilized parts of Tibet tea and tsamba are used in the 
same way and lu^.arly to the same extent as amongthe tent dwellers, and 
vegetables form a very small portion of the diet of any of the Tibetan 
people, liice, imported from China and Bhutan, is occasionally used, 
sometimes boiled with milk, sometimes made into a pillaw {dre-sil in 
Tibetan), in which is put melted butter {marl-ti), raisins, and sugar. 
Spaghetti (in Chinese, 7nien) is also eaten by the house-dwelling Tibet- 
ans, by whom it-is known asjyafuf/, and this dish, as well as vermicelh 
{A-ua-mieH), has been introduced into the country by the Chinese. 
Chinese condiments are also used by the wealthy Tibetans, who fre- 
quently have their meals served in purely Chinese fashion. 

While pork is never eaten by the tent-dwelling Tibetans, it is used 
to a considerable extent by the people of central and some parts of 
eastern Tibet, but mutton and yak flesh supply by far the largest part 
of the animal food eaten by them. The pastoral Tibetans export in 
winter to Lh'asa and elsewhere frozen sheep's carcasses, and they them- 
selves use large quantities of dried mutton {sha Mm). The meat is cut 
in strips, boiled, and then dried. In this shape it will keep for nearly 
a year, and is much used while traveling. 

Cabbages, turnips sometimes dried, radishes and potatoes, pease, and 
several varieties of beans are eaten, but in very small quantities, the 
people preferring tea and tsamba to any other diet which can be placed 
before them. 

*I have never seen pottery manufactured in Tibet, and the only reference to the 
subject I have fouud in any work ou Tibet is in Captain Pemberton's Report on 
Bootan, p. 74. 

H. Mis. 184, pt. 2 45 



706 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

The only alcoliolic drink of the Tibetans is barley wine, or nds cWang. 
Jaeschke (Tib. Engl. Diet., p. 154, s. v. cli'ang) tbus describes its jjrepara 
tion: 

When the boiled barley has ^rown cold some pahs (or yeast) is added, after which 
it is left standing for two or three days, until fermentation commences, when it is 
called (jlum. Having sufficiently fermented, some water is poured on it, and the 
beer is considered ready for use. 

In some parts of the country this nlis cWang is distilled, and a very 
strong colorless liqnor of considerable strength thus obtained, which 
is called arralc. 

Houses. — Tibetan liornes are so nutch alike throughout the whole 
country that a description of one will serve for all. They may, how 
ever, be divided into two classes, those of the ricli, in which there is a 
central court, around three or more generally four, sides of which rise 
buildings usually three stories high, and those of the poorer class, which 
are two storied, and have a coitrtyard in front or behind them. In both 
classes of houses the ground floor is used as a stable and godown. 
The following description of the houses of East Tibet will apply, with 
such slight differences as the scarcity or abundance of timber in the 
different localities must occasion, to houses throughout Tibet: 

The walls of the houses are generally made of Hat stones, held together with mud 
mortar. I do not believe that lime is ever used. Often the walls are of beaten earth. 
The ground floor is ordinarily given up to cattle; On the tirst floor are the rooms, 
usnally large, and lit by means of little square or oblong windows divided by a bar 
in the shape of a cross. There is no glass in the window frame — not even paper, as in 
China. The windows have wooden shutters, which are carefully closed at night. 
Around the doors and windows is sometimes a molding painted in red, white, and 
blue, consisting of the ends of the projecting rafters, and freqitently on this kind of 
cornice are flat stones, on wliich are written the famous prayer Oni mani peine hum. 
In large buildings the first-story apartmeuts form three sides, and sometimes even a 
square around an interiorcourtyard, which is always disgustingly dirty. In the bet^ 
ter sort of buildings there is always a covered gallery opening onto the courtyard in 
front of the rooms. The roof forms a terrace, is of earth, and is used as a thrashing 
floor. On the uppermost terrace there is usually a little pavilion, or idol room, sur- 
mounted by a terrace, where are ]ilanted la-der, long poles to which are attached 
narrow pieces of linen covered with sn])erstitious sentences.* As a general rule, at 
each corner of the house there is a small tower, on the top of which is an earthen 
vase, in which every morning the devout burn in honor of the devil, sweet-smelling 
wood, little twigs of cypress or pine.t Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the 
stairway is only a long log of wood 6 or 8 inches broad and 4 or 5 thick, on one 
side of which and 7 or 8 inches apart are notches about 2 or 3 inches deep, just 
enough to rest half the foot in when going up sideways. The })eople prefer these 
ladders to ordinary stairways because in case of an attack by robbers they can 
draw them up and defend tliemselves better. It is also as a measure of safety that 
they are careful to have only one door leading into the courtyard, and no windows 
on the ground floor. (C. H. Desgodins, Le Thibet, pp. 379-381.) 

Cunningham, speaking of the houses of Ladak, says: 

*Gcorgi, Aphabetum tibetanum. p. 509, calls these "iarpocli'e arbor salutaris, 
depulsoria mali." 

t Conf. Land of the Lamas, p. 218. 



NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 707 

The bouses usually eousist of 2 or 3 stories and sometimes of 4. The foundations 
and lower parts of the walls are built of stone, the upper walls of large sun-dried 
bricks, 20 by 10 by 6 inches. In the better houses some of the rooms are of consid- 
erable size, 25 feet long and 18 broad, but they are always very low, the highest 
not exceeding 7^ or 8 feet. The roofs of these large rooms are always supported by 
plain wooden pillars. The roof is formed of iioplar spars 5 or 6 inches in diameter, 
peeled white, and laid only 1 to 1^ feet apart. The beams are covered in with small, 
straight pieces of pojdar branches about 1 inch in diameter, peeled white, and 
placed touching each other.* Generally they are laid straight across the beams, 
but sometimes at ditterent angles, in the alternate intervals, so as to form a pattern 
like herring bones. The whole is then covered with a layer of leaves and a thick 
coat of well-beaten clay. The floors are generally of earth, but the better sort are 
paved with small slit pebbles, about the size of turkey's eggs, set in clay wnth the 
flat surface upward. Thej^ form a clean, hard, smooth, and lasting floor. 

The principal room generally has a balcony toward either the south or the west 
from 10 to 20 feet iu length and usually about 2^ feet in width, where the family sit 
to enjoy the sun in the winter season. The doors are mere rough planks of wood, 
joined together by wooden tenons, and sometimes strengthened by crossbars fastened 
by wooden jiins. Purdahs or wadded curtains are also used as an additional means 
of excluding the cold wind,t but when the doors are shut there is only a dim light 
admitted into the apartments through one or two loopholes, which are closed with 
small shutters at night. * * * In Ladak the upper story is usually reached by 
a flight of earthen steps, but in Lahul by the sloping trunk of a tree notched into 
steps. (Alex. Cunningham, Ladak, pp. 313,314.) 

Ill the iii(tuiitaiiK»us and well-timbered regions of western Kan-sii, 
inhabited by Tibetans, log houses of one story are much used, and in 
portions of eastern Tibet the second story of many of the houses is 
made of logs. This work is, in most cases, done by Chinese carpenters. 

As regards the houses of eastern Tibet and such other portions of 
the country as I have visited, there is absolutely no furniture iu them. 
Sometimes a log of wood, roughly squared, or a low Chinese table is 
found near the hearth, the smoke from which escapes as best it can 
through a hole in the ceiling' or by the low door and little windows. 
Some houses contain furnaces or cooking stoves, similar to those used 
in the black tents, on which the kettles boil over a dung or wood tire. 
In others there are large, open hearths, in the center of each of which 
are three stones to rest the pot on. The simplicity of the nomad is 
found in all the appointments of the agricultural Tibetan's house. 
(Land of the Lamas, pi). 191-195, Comp. C. R. Markham, Narrative of 
the mission of Geo. Bogle, p. 122.) 

The houses of the people of Bhutan dilfer principally from those pre- 
viously described in the roofs, which are made of " shingles of pine, 5 
or 6 feet iu length, laid over- a framework and kept in their i>lace with 
stones. Theslope is, of course, very inconsiderable, otherwise thestones 
would roll off. * * * The appearance of the houses is precisely that 
of Swiss cottages. They are singularly picturesque and comfortable, and 

* When a house has been used for a year or more the ceilings become a shining black 
color from the smoke of the fires. 

t These are also used in parts of eastern Tibet, where they have been introduced 
by the Chinese. Felt or wadded door curtains are used all over northern China. 



708 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

the only drawback is a want of cbimneys; but the Bootanese do not 
know how to construct these, and the smoke linds its way out as best 
it can." (Ashley Eden, Report on the State of Bootan, p. 121.) 

Tibetan houses are lit by means of small lamps {mar me or zumar) filled 
with butter in which a little cotton wick is stuck. Sometimes this 
lamp is of brass or copper and is about 3J inches high. Lamps of the 
same pattern are used on altars in temples, where one will frequently 
see long rows of them, several hundred in number, burning before the 
sacred images. Other lamps are but small earthenware saucers or cups, 
in design similar to the brass ones. Besides this mode of lighting the 
house the only other Avhich I have seen consisted in chips of pitch 
pine burnt on a flat stone, put in the middle of the room. As a general 
rule, Tibetans go to sleep as soon as it becomes dark, and in many houses 
there are not even to be fouiid the primitive lamps above described. 

The kettles used iu Tibetan households, whether it be among tent 
dwellers or people living in houses, are the same; they are usually 
rather flat and thin so that they can be easily heated by a dry dung 
fire, as dung is the only kind of fuel available in the greater part of the 
country. These kettles, several of which are in the Museum collections, 
vary in size from 8 to 10 inches in diameter to 24 inches or even more. 
The Shigatse kettles, which are all tai>ering from the middle toward 
the bottom so as to fit in the holes on the cooking stoves, are frequently 
of very large dimensions in the houses of the rich and in lamaseries. 
I have seen some over 2 feet in diameter. The rounded form is in 
general use in Mongolia, northern and eastern Tibet, though in the two 
latter countries it is usually without handles. Most of the copper ket- 
tles in use iu eastern Tibet, Bat'ang, Lit'ang, etc., are made in China 
in the Chieu-cli'ang (iu southwest Ssu-ch'uan). Those used in the 
Kokonor and adjacent countries are also made by the Chinese of Hsi- 
ning and Sung-p'an (see Diary of a Journey, etc., p. 96). 

In some parts of the country near Ladak, and which are inhabited by 
tent dwellers, large stone vessels are also in use. In the report of 
Nain Singh's journey of 1873, when speaking of the people inhabiting 
the tablelands in northwest Tibet, it is said — 

At the permaueut cauii)S tliey had large caldrous, generally made of atone; iu 
these they used to make a very weak soup, into which they threw a handful of flour. 
At their smaller camps they cook in smaller vessels made of stone or copper, both 
of which are imported from Ladakh. All articles of copper or iron are very much 
valued. * * * (Jour. Roy. Geog. Soc, xlvii, p. 93 ; Couf. \Vm. Moorcroft, Travels, 
I, p. 397.) 

Among the other household utensils rei)resented in the Museum col- 
lections are small birch bark pails, in use wherever the tree is found 
growing, iu northwest Kan-su, in Bat'ang and Sikkim, and closely 
resembling those made by the Ainu. There are also small, round 
wooden boxes with tops, turned by the Chinese in Yiiu-nan, and used to 
keep salt or red pepper {latze) in, brass ladles, and bellows made of

tanned goatskin. In this latter implement an iron nozzle abont 18 inches 
in length is tied in the skin of one of the legs, the skin is cnt off at the 
fore legs, and the opening left by the other hind leg is sewed np. The 
month of the bag is held with the left hand stretched ont from the 
body, and with the right hand the open end is opened and shnt; 
when filled with air the right hand is held firmly against the body and 
the left arm, against which the closed mouth of the bag presses, is 
lowered, and the air thus expelled through the nozzle. These bellows, 
called kiimo. are used throughout Tibet in camp as well as in the houses. 
In some of the lower valleys near regions where the bamboo grows, a 
simple bamboo tube is used instead, and through it the cook blows the 
fire, applying the tube against his mouth. This simple contrivance is 
used also throughout Ssu-ch'uau. 

The Lh'asan iron padlock {dongpa) has the hasp armed with 4 springs, 
and slides inside the lock until the springs have passed 2 shoulders on 
the inside which catch and secure it. By means of a forked key worked 
horizontally on slides along the under side of the lock, the springs of 
the hasp are i>ressed down from the shoulders and the hasp flies out. 
The key is quite complex, owing to the number of guides along which 
it must i^ass in order to move the spring. These guides vary in each 
lock, and the lock is copied on those in general use throughout China 
(see Diary of a Journey, etc., p. 281). 

Wickerware is never used among the tent-dwelling Tibetans, and 
none of that which I have seen in other parts of the country was made 
by the people'themselves. In Poyul, in southern Tibet, the people of 
which are not pure Tibetans, very pretty wickerwork is made. PI. 16 
shows the usual shape of a little covered basket which comes from 
that country. It is made of white, black, yellow, and red strips of 
cane woven in diagonal pattern. In shape the basket is cylindrical, 
11 inches in diameter and ] inch deep; the cover fits over the bottom. 
I have also seen joints of bamboo covered with similar wickerwork and 
made in the same country. They are used to keep cWang in. 

The Tibetans in some parts of the country make very coarse crates 
of a truncated pyramidal form which they carry on their backs; they 
use them principally to collect dry dung in. The tea strainers pre- 
viously referred to are made either by the Chinese or by the people 
living near the Indian border. In the various books of travel to which 
I have had access, I have found no mention of wickerware in Tibet, and 
the various names giving different forms of baskets by Mr. Jaeschke 
in his dictionary {pe-ra, "a flat basket;" gzed-ma, "a box-shaped basket 
with lid;" tse-jM) or tsel-po, "a basket carried on the back;" bag-tse, "a 
little basket for wool or clews of wool,") are nearly all i^eculiar to 
portions of the country in close proximity to India. 

Tobacco. — Tobacco is in general use in Tibet, but probably from the 
fact that lamas are only allowed to take it in the form of snuff, this 
mode of using the weed is much more popular than smoking. The 



710 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

tobacco used comes from either China, Bhutan, Silikini or Nepaul, that 
from Bhutan being, as I understand it, greatly preferred. Tliis tobacco 
is, however, rather expensive and strong, so it is frequently used for 
smoking either mixed with the leaves of the rhubarb plant, or the latter 
substance is even used pure in its stead. This substitute for tobacco 
is in great demand in Tibet among smokers, and is exported from Lh'asa, 
or the countries to the southwest of it rather, where the plant is found, all 
over eastern Tibet where it is called LWam fob-eho. Snuff is made in 
the country or imported from China; the latter variety is, however, too 
much perfumed to suit the Tibetan taste. Frequently, to make the 
snuff milder, ashes are mixed with it. In the northeastern part of 
Tibet well-polished ox horns are used to hold the snuff, several examples 
of which are shown on pi. 17.* One of these is handsomely orna- 
mented with silver bauds, bits of coral, and turquoise. In other parts 
of the country (among the K'amba of northeastern Tibet for example), 
the coarsely pounded tobacco is put in a leather pouch, and when a 
pinch is wanted the tiner particles are scraped off" the sides with a knife. 

In Lh'asa a snuffbox is made of wood of oblate-si)heroid shape, 
across the interior of which is stretched a tine cloth sieve. The coarse 
tobacco is put in the top of the box through a hole made for that pur- 
pose, and by lightly striking the box on the knee the liner parts are 
sifted throngh into the lower compartment. By a little hole in the 
lower part of the box the snuff"' is poured out onto the nail of the left 
thumb held against the index, and is thus inhaled daily in enormous 
quantities. PI. 18 shows a line specimen of this kind of snuffbox. 
Women use snuff, but rarely smoke; when they do, they use the Chinese 
water pipe. 

Tlie tobacco i)ipes used by the Tibetans are usually of Chinese make, 
the bowls of brass, iron, or white coi)per (pi. 19, tigs. 1 and -), the stem 
of bamboo and about 2 feet long. Mouthpieces are not usually used. 
I have only seen threekindsof"pii)esof purely Tibetan manufacture; one, 
in use among the Panaka, is made of the horn of the antel(»i)e {hu<uuj 
yam/), with a metallic mouthjiiece and a metal bowl. iSonie of these 
pipes, in which they only smoke Chinese water tobacco, and which are 
a moditication of the short bamboo pipe in use in iSsu-ch'uan for the 
same purpose (as seen in fig. 4), are ornamented Avith coral and tur- 
quoise beads. Another pipe, in use in Jyadc, is made of a forked twig; 
the larger i)art is hollowed out, then lined with iron, and this forms the 
bowl; in the smaller and longer branch the pith is removed, and rhis 
constitutes the stem. In southeastern Tibet, in tbe Ts'arong and among 
the Mishmis and the hill tribes along southern Tibet, the root of a 
small mountain bamboo is used to make the bowl of the pipe, and the 
same plant supplies the stem. (Fig. 3). 

*Similar mulls or snuff borus are iu use not only iu Scotlaud', but ainon^ tbe 
Wachaga of Kiliniaujaro, iu East Africa. (See Cat. Nos. 151242, 151243, ami 151244,

Tobacco Pouches and Fire Holders. 



NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 711 

Smokers carry their tobacco in long- red leather pouclies (pi. 20, fig. 2), 
or ill the black leather poaches iu general use in China (fig. 3). To 
these are suspended a small metal or wooden fire bowl (figs. 4-6) and a 
pipe cleaner. The pipe is usually carried passed through the belt, in 
front of the i)ersou, and the pouch either hangs from the belt, or, when a 
short pipe is used, it is stuck in the pouch and both are carried inside 
the gown. 

Those among the Tibetans who smoke the water pipe use the Chinese 
l)ipe, or else the short wooden hubble-bubble in use in Kashmir. The 
tobacco used in water pipes is prepared in China, in Ssuch'uan and 
Kan-su, that coming from Lan-chou, in the latter province, being con- 
sidered the best; its preparation I have described in Land of the Lamas 
(pp. 34-35). Dr. Hooker, iu his Himalayan Journals (ii, p. 152), tells us 
that the Phii)unof Lamteng.in Sikkim, "was an inveterate smoker, using 
a pale, mild tobacco, mixed largely with leaves of the small wild Tibetan 
rhubarb, called 'chula.' Snuff, he says elsewhere (ii, p. 232), is little 
used, and is principally procured from the plains of India." 

VI. 

AGRICULTURE — WEAPONS — HUNTING — MUSIC — DANCING. 

Throughout Tibet the only instruments of husbandry are the hoe and 
the plow. The former is usually made entirely of wood. The handle, 
about 30 inches long, is slightly curved, and on the natural bend at the 
end of the handle is tied a pointed wooden blade (see Diary of a Journey, 
etc., p. 362). The plow is of the same rude description, and is without 
even a share in most parts of the country. It is drawn by one yak; a 
yoke or stick resting on its neck is fastened to the plow. A man leads 
the yak and another guides the plow, scratching slightly the soil. For 
harvesting a rude sickle is used, consisting in a handle about 18 inches 
long, in which a short iron blade is set at right angle. The flail is iu 
use in some parts of the "country, but as a general rule the grain is 
thrashed out by goats or i)ouies driven over it, and is afterwards 
winnowed on the housetops. (See, for further information on the sub- 
ject, C. H. Desgodins, Le Thibet, p. 397.) 

Irrigation is well understood in Tibet and is extensively used. (See 
Pemberton's Eeport on Bootan, p. Q().) Among the Tibetans of North- 
west Kan-su water is carried considerable distances across valleys in 
troughs dug in logs supported by light trestlework, and this system 
is also found in many jiortions of southern Tibet. The fields are usually 
fenced either with brush, poles, or low stone walls. 

We((2)OHs. — The bow is apparently not a Tibetan weapon, as all those 
in ut>e in the country are imported from China or Bhutan. The quiver, 
bow case, and all the accouterments arc purely Chinese or Bhutanese 
in style. The usual length of the Chinese bow {<lzu in Tibetan) is about 
5 feet, and the arrow {da), 2 feet 6 inches. PI. 21 shows the best 
arrangement of these articles. This specimen is a beautiful piece of 



712 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

workmansliip ; the leather used is red Kussiau {hvlgarm Tibetan), aud 
tlie metal work very higlily fiuished and thickly gilt.* 

The Tibetan sword.is oftwo kinds. Both^are straight and of iron, but 
in one kind the extremity of the blade runs to a sharp point; in the 
other (copied from the Chinese) the point is oblique, like the Japanese 
and Chinese swords. The average length of the blade of Tibetan 
swords is 2a inches. Fig. 3 of pi. 22 shows a flue sword of the latter 
pattern, made in Poyul. The hilt is covered with shagreen, and 
in the pommel, which is of iron, wires of brass and copper have 
been set in the metal. The scabbard is of wood covered with shagreen 
and plain bands of silver extend half its length. The upper half 
of the scabbard is covered with red cloth, a strap fastened to the 
scabbard near the hilt passes around the wearer's waist, and the sword 
is worn in front of the person, as are nearly all Tibetan swords. In 
Lit'ang, Ch'amdo aud a few other localities, however, a variety of sword 
is made which is worn in Chinese fashion, hanging from the left side 
(see Diary of a Journey, etc., p. 330), but the usual Tibetan mode of 
carrying a sword is passed in the belt in front so that the right hand 
rests on the hilt. Fig. 2 represents a sword with a rough wooden 
scabbard, and was manufactured in the Horba country, in eastern 
Tibet. It is in shape like the preceding. 

In Land of the Lamas (p. 257) is figured a fine sword of Derge make. 
The scabbard and hilt are highly ornamented with.repoMsst' silver work, 
in which are set coral beads. The edges of the scabbard are protected 
by a rim of iron. This style of sword is the most highly prized of any 
in Tibet, and large sums of money ($100 to $150) are frequently paid 
for them. (PI. 22, fig. 1.) 

The Tibetan matchlock gun {me-da or ^j^^o; the latter is a Chinese 
term) has a barrel about 48 inches long with a half-inch bore. The 
stock is of wood, sometimes covered with wild ass skin, and extends to 
near the muzzle of the barrel. This gnn aud the accouterments to be 
described are shown on pi. 23. A wooden ramrod fits in the stock, 
and the barrel is fastened into it by either rawhide thongs or brass 
wire. Through the stock, about 6 inches behind the breech of the gun, 
passes a trigger, the upper end of which is forked so as to hold a slow- 
match of plaited cottoii soaked in powder and then dried. The lower 
end of the trigger projects slightly beyond the lower side of the stock 
so that the match can be depressed onto the pan. The unused part 
of the slow-match is held in a leather case on the right side of the 
stock from which it i)asses out by a small iron tube. It is held firm in 
the fork of the trigger by a strap fixed'on the left side of the stock to 
a small ring. The powder in the pan is in like fashion protected by a 
leather cover. Attached to the muzzle of the gun by a bolt is a long 
wooden fork [ra-jo) with iron or antelope horn tips. When the gun is

being used this fork rests on the groiiiid and the marksman shoots 
kneeling or even lying down. 

Most Tibetans carry a number of horn or brass chargers around their 
necks or in their bosoms, and in a leather bag hanging from a belt on 
their right side is a horn primer, which can be opened by a bit of thiu 
elastic horn which covers the end, also a powder horn, frequently made 
Oi' the horn of an ovis poll, or of wood covered with leather. In 
another small pouch hanging from the same belt, but on the left side, 
is kept a supply of leaden bullets. 

The gun described is a good specimen of the matchlocks used in 
eastern Tibet and among the Ts'aidam Mongols. Guns mounted by 
these latter people are much prized in parts of Tibet, as they are much 
lighter than any others. 

The stock and lower end of the giin are kept wrapped in a waterproof 
case of different colored woolen cloths or in a case of pulo or one made 
of marmot skin or simply in a piece of felt. 

The barrels of all Tibetan guns are imported from either China or 
India, the Tibetans not being able apparently to make them, though 
those 1 have seen were of very rough workmanship and far from being 
true.* 

Dr. Griffiths (Journal, p. 106) says that the matchlocks used in 
Bhutan are of Chinese manutacture but gun forks are not used among 
this people, ^ain Singh, speaking of the nomads of northwestern Tibet, 
says: 

Most families possess a matchlock, generally of Nepal mannfactnre, and the men of 
the Rndokh district seldom move about without either a gun or a bow and arrows, 
in the use of which latter they are very expert. (.Jouru. Roy Geog. Soc, XLVii, 
p. 93.) 

To the fork of their gun Tibetans often attach a small piece of white 
cotton cloth on w^hich are printed magic formulas, and it is customary 
among the wilder tribes to smear the stock of the gun with some of the 
blood of any animal they may kill. This, as explained to me, was " for 
good luck." 

The spear {dumj) is a weapon in common use in Tibet, especially 
among the black-tent people. It varies in length from 7^ feet to 10 or 
12 feet. One in my possession (See Diary of a Journey, etc., p. 170), 
made in Poyul, has a shaft 5 feet 7^ inches long; the point is of iron, 
the shaft fitting into a socket at its end. The point is a long, nar- 
row two-edged blade. The butt of the shaft has a heavy iron shoe. 
A strong band of iron is coiled around the shaft its whole length; 
this device is resorted to throughout the country to strengthen the 
shaft, for making which the country supplies no good wood. The shaft 
of the spear in my possession appears to be of cocoanut wood. 

*' Kashmh- produces fine gun barrels. In all likelihood many are imported into 
Tibet. On their manufacture, see Moorcroft, Travels, ii, 203-213. 



714 REPORT. OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

The Tibetans are very expert in using the sling {orta, or gudo, accord- 
ing to Jaeschke), and among the tent dwellers and the i>eople of the 
more remote localities, one is always seen hanging from the belt of both 
men and women. It is made of wool and hair mixed; one string ter- 
minates in a leash, and the instrument is also used as a whip in driving 
sheep or cattle (see Diary of a Journey, etc., p. 264). I have seen time 
and again a stone thrown a distance of over 300 yards from one of 
these slings. 

Hunting is not allowed in many parts of Tibet, it being forbidden by 
the religion of the country to take animal lite. In the remoter parts 
and in eastern Tibet generally, the people hunt, however, yak, deer, 
antelope, and especially musk deer. 

i!iain Singh says: 

The Champas are keeu in the pursuit of game, which they kill in large quantities, 
partly with firearms and bows and arrows, but chicdy with a kind of trap called 
Bedokh chum, A-ery similar in principle to an English rat trap. It consists of a ring 
made of rope, to whose inner surface are attached elastic sharp-pointed slips of 
wood converging toward the center of the ring, where a space is left sufficiently 
large to allow the passage through it of the animal's foot. Small holes are dug in 
the ground near the water which the wild animals are known to frequent. These 
traps are placed at the top, hidden from view l)y a covering of earth, and attached 
by a strong ro]ie, also concealed from view, to a stout peg, which is driven into the 
ground at a considerable distance off. The animals on their way to the water pass 
over the holes, and the weight of the body drives the foot through the ring. Once 
through, it is impossible for the animal to free his foot from the trap, and he soon 
falls a victim to the sword and spear of the hunter, who lies concealed somewhere in 
the neighborhood. Great numbers of wild horses, sheep, and antelopes are killed 
in this manner. (Journ. Roy. Geo. Soc, xlvii, p. 94.)* 

Capt. Samuel Turner says of the father of the then Panchen Riu- 
poche lama of Tashilunpo: 

I found Gyap to be not only a lover of manly sports and martial exercises, but 
also a perfect connoisseur on the sultject of arms. His collection was exhibited, 
and he liberally descanted on the peculiar merits of each weapon. There were arrows 
famed for their remote and steady fligbt, which had names inscribed on each of 
them, and jilaces assigned to them in a quiver, in separate ceils. He honored me 
with a present of three of these, and a large Chinese bow, near 5 feet in length, 
made of the horns of bufialoes, which he had used, he said, for many years. " ' « 
His own favorite bows were of bamboo, a species produced in the mountains bor- 
dering upon Tibet, of great strength, and almost entirely solid. The bow is framed 
from two pieces of bamboo, sjilit off next the outside; the inner sides of which, 
after being well fitted, are united together by many strong bands. Gyap put one of 
these bows into my hands, which, when bent, was of extreme tension. I was unable 
to di'aw the arrow, but taking it himself, he pointed it at a mark upon the opposite 
hill, at a distance, as I judged, of 500 or 600 yards. I could not trace the fiight of 
the arrow, though steadily intent upon it, when he discharged it. * * * He 
mentioned also the dexterity with which a horseman here would dismount his adver- 
sary, particularly when in pursuit, by means oi a running noose. (Turner, Embassy 
to the Court of the Teshoo Lama, pp. 341, 342.) 

* One of these traps is figured in Capt. H. Bower's Diary of a Journey through 
Tibet, p. 117, From this we further learn that the converging slips in the trap are not 
of wood but of horn. It is interesting to find an identical trap used by the Shuli 
near Khartuni on the Nile. (F. Eatzel, Vr.lkerkunde, i, p. .004.) 



NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 715 

Musical instruments. — Exclusive of the musioal instruments used in 
religious worship, which will be described in another section, the only- 
instruments I have seen or heard of amon<? the Tibetans are, tirst, the 
whistle {ling-hu), (pi. 24, figs. 1-3) made of bamboo or the bone of an 
eagle's wing, and with or 7 keyholes; second, the jew's-harp (Fa-pi) 
(figs. 4-6) and third, the banjo or guitar {piwang, liopong, or dra-nyan), 
with 3 or more strings. 

The jew's-harp is made not by the Tibetans, but by the Lissus and 
other non-Tibetan trib.es inhabiting southeast Tibet, and is a favorite 
instrument in eastern Tibet, where nearly all the women carry one 
suspended from their girdles. Three harps are used simultaneously, 
each giving a different note; the deepest note is called j)'o hi or '' male 
sound," the intermediate one ding Jed or '' middle sound," the sharpest 
one mo Id or "female sound." They are held the one below the other in 
the order above given between the thumb and the index of the left 
hand, and struck with all the finp-ers of the right hand, the one after 
the other. These Fajn are carried in small bamboo cases ornamented 
with little rings of bamboo, often dyed, and also with geometric carv- 
ings, which are also colored. They are shown in the lower portion of 
this plate.* 

The banjo or guitar is similar to that instrument in China and Kash- 
mir, being round-bodied aud long-armed. Desgodins (Le Thibet, p. 
393) mentions a rude one with only 2 strings, which are struck by 
means of a plectrum. 

Capt. Turner, in tlie work previously cited (p. 343), says: 

Gyap gave into my baud a flageolet, and desired me to use it. I was nnable. He 
then took it, and accompanied Gyeuug upon the cittanr (a stringed instrument, 
something resembling a guitar) and they played several pleasing airs together. At 
length, Gyeung accompanied the instruments with her A'oice, which was by no 
means inharmonious; and I am not ashamed to own that the song she sung was 
more pleasing to my ear than an Italian air. * * * Gyap regretted his inability 
to entertain me with a great variety of instrumental music, saying that he was 
obliged to leave behind him his collection on leaving Lassa. * * * jjg ^qI^I me 
that their music was written down in characters, which they learnt. 

The statement made at the end of the preceding quotation is highly 
interesting, but I fancy that Turner's host only referred to church 
music, which is recorded by an ingenious system of descriptive nota- 
tion. (See Land of the Lamas, p. 88.) 

Vocal music is an amusement of which all Tibetans are very fond, 
and the power and sweetness of their voices have been noted by most 
travelers. (Dr. J. D, Hooker, Himalayan Journals, i, i). 304, C. H. Des- 
godins, Le Thibet, p. 393, etc.) 

Tibetan dancing (tra-chyam or chyam) is of the most primitive kind. 

* Jew's harps similar to those used in Tibet are found among the Ainu and in New 
Guinea, but in many other countries where a bamboo harp is used, the sound is pro- 
duced by jerking the harp by a string — this is the case in Assam, in parts of Sumatra, 
among the Yakutd, the tribe of Torres Straits, etc. 



716 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Single female dancers sometimes perform while playing on the Jew's-harp. 
In this dance they shuffle slowly about, without raising the feet, and 
keeping time to their music. In other dances tive or ten men stand on 
one side holding hands, and facing them stand as many women. One 
line sings a verse while slowly moving forward and backward, then 
the other side does likewise. (See C. H. Desgodins, op, sup. cit., 304, 
and Land of the Lamas, p. 247.)* 

George Bogle thus describes a dance lie witnessed near Shigatse. 

The court held about 30 ilaucers, half of them men, half of them womeu. The 
men were dressed in different and party-colored clothes, with their large sheep's- 
wool bonnets, a bit of colored silk in one hand, and a leather machine, something 
iu shape of, but rather less than, a fiddle at their side. The women had their faces 
washed, and clean clothes, abundance of rings upon their fingers, and of coral, 
amber beads, bugles, etc., on their heads and necks, and each wore a small round 
hat, covered with circles of white beads. They formed a ring, the men being alto- 
gether, the women altogether, and five men were in the middle of it. They danced 
to their own singing, moving slowly round in a sort of half-hox) step, keeping time 
with their hands, while the five in the center twisted round and cut capers, with 
many strange and indescribable motions. The second part of the entertainment was 
performed by four or five men, with winged rainbow-colored caps, who jumped and 
twisted about, to the clashing of cymbals and the beating of tabors. Among the 
rest was a merry Andrew with a mask stuck over with cowries, and a clown with 
a large stick in his hand. These two men were more alike than the others, and 
between whiles carried on a dialogue, and the grimace and conversation gave great 
entertainment to those who understood it. (C. R. Markham, Narrative of the Mis- 
sion, etc., p. 92.)

TRANSPORTATION. 

Wheeled vehicles are practically unknown in Tibet; all traveling is 
done on horse or mule back or on foot, and freight is carried by yaks, 
mules, horses, donkeys, or sheep, hardly ever by men, except for short 
distances over exceptionally rough or steep ground. 

The Tibetan riding saddle {taga) difters but little from that used in 
China; in eastern Tibet those most prized are made in Derge (see 
Diary of a Journey, etc., p. lOii.), and iu central Tibet saddles of Chinese 
make, but ornamented with silver and j)recious stones in Tibetan style, 
are much sought after. 

PI. 25 shows a Kokonor pony equipped with a good Derge saddle. 
The tree is made of four pieces of birchwood, covered on the outside 
before and behind with shagreen and trimmed with polished iron 
bands. The seat is of several thicknesses of felt covered with pulo. 
The stirrup straps are of plaited rawhide, the stirrup irons of Chinese 
make. The girth passes over the saddle ; frequently a hind girth is used. 
A broad crupper ami a breast band are generally used. From the lat- 
ter hangs, when the rider is an official, a long red tassel or doni, 
(called chHhsiln in Chinese), such as are worn in China by military

officers. The bit used throughout Tibet is a very light, hirge-riuged 
suaffle, and the headstall and reins are of either rawhide or plaited 
hair. A long iilaited rawhide rope is usually carried, tied to the sad- 
dle, one end attached to the ring of the bit. Under the saddle are two 
pads made of felt and covered with ornamented leather facings; those 
of this saddle w^ere made in Poyul. These pads, which do not quite 
touch along the upper edge, keep the saddle well off the horse's back. 
Underneath them is a large blanket or a felt rug- which extends nearly 
to the horse's tail. Sometimes, especiallj' in eastern Tibet, the whole 
saddle is covered with a green cloth cover with a felt lining. 

Woolen saddle bags {sata), varying in size and in fineness of texture, 
are used by most Tibetans when traveling; in them they carry all their 
provisions. ISome of them are so closely woven that they are quite 
waterproof. 

The Tibetans use rawhide and yak hair hobbles, with which they 
fasten the two fore feet and one hind foot of their horses and mules. 
Sometimes iron chain hobbles fastened with a padlock are used. This 
latter kind of hobble is of Chinese make. 

The pack saddle, used alike on mules, horses, and yaks, consists of 
two light wooden wings with a light wooden arch at each end, as seen 
in pi. 26. On either side are two i)arallel sticks projecting about .3 
inches beyond the arches. The girth, which is of wool, is fastened to 
the lower stick, and the hair or rawhide ropes with which the load is 
fastened on, passes over and under the upper one. When carrying 
loads done up in rawhide so as to protect them from the weather (and 
in this way all the tea and other valuable merchandise is carried), short 
rawhide loops fastened to the loads by means of sticks fitting in small 
slits made in the rawhide are x>assed over the end of the upper stick 
of the saddle and the load hung by them. Crupper sticks, as well as 
cruppers and broad breast straps of wool, are always used. The form 
of pack saddle used in eastern Tibet and the Kokonor is a little larger 
and heavier than that used in other parts of the country. Two rec- 
tangular felt pads covered with coarse cloth {laica) are tied to the 
saddle, and under these again are one or more felt rugs. (See Diary of 
a Journey, etc., p. 108.) 

The Tibetans do not generally use riding whips: the end of the rope 
tied to the bridle is used in its stead ; when they do, it is made with a 
short wooden handle to which is tied a heavy lash about.lS inches long. 

Pilgrims traveling on foot usually have on their backs a light wooden 
framework about 20 inches high, made of a couple of small twigs bent 
into a rectangular shape; on this they tie their small load of baggage, 
a similar frame tied to the lower part of the first one folds up against 
it and holds the load in jjlace, and woolen straps pass over the bearer's 
shoulders. This contrivance is called a k''ur-sMiif/. 

Women carrying water in the long narrow wooden barrels in use 
throughout Tibet for that purpose, rest the bottom of the barrel on the 
thick folds of their gown gathered above the waist, and i)assing a strap

around the top of the barrel aud across their breasts, thus ascend the 
steepest hills, their arms folded before them. 

Boats. — The only purely Tibetan boat I have seen or heard of is the 
skin coracle or ku-dru. It is composed of yak hides stretched over a 
few bent twigs with a slightly heavier piece of wood bent around the top 
to which the skin is lirmly sewn. So frail is it that one must be careful 
not to put one's foot on the hide, but only ou the ribs, for the least direct 
pressure on the skins makes the seams give way. A man kneeling in 
the bow i^addles or stears with a short paddle, crossing the river 
diagonally, and then carrying his boat on his back upstream so as to 
come back to his starting point when swept across again. These 
coracles are about 5 feet long, 4 broad, and 30 inches deep; two or 
three men and a couple of hundred pounds of goods can be carried in 
one. When leaking slightly the lioles are filled with butter. With 
these skin boats we may compare the " bull boats " used by the Mandans 
on the Upper Missouri, which are, however, slightly smaller than the 
Tibetan ones, though identical with. them in all other respects. 

All other boats used in Tibet are. made by the Chinese. On some 
of their rivers the Tibetans use heavy rafts, which four or six men 
paddle across. They are about 12 feet long and 6 feet broad, made of 
heavy squared logs held together by a pinned crosspiece in front and 
behind.

MONETARY SYSTEM — MEDIUMS OF EXCHANGE — WRITING — PRINT- 
ING — TIME RECKONING — MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE — MISCELLANEOUS 
OBJECTS. 

A Chinese author, called Wei Yiian, in his work entitled Shengwu 
chi (Book XIV, p. 53), says that in ancient times the Tibetans used cow- 
rie shells and knife-shaped coins, but that since the Sung, Chin, and 
Ming periods (i. e., since the twelfth century) they have used silver. 
He further adds that since the Cheng-tung jieriod of the Ming (A. D. 
1436) they have paid their'taxes (or tribute to China) in silver coins. 

As far as my information goes the present coinage of Tibet has been 
in use since the middle of the eighteenth century. It comprises only 
one coin, a silver one called tranka, of the nominal value of about 16 
cents of our money. Fractional currency is made by cutting the 
tranka into pieces. (Land of the Lamas, p. 207.) The only mint I 
know of in Tibet is at Lh'asa. The trankas minted there bear on the 
obverse the inscription Jyal-icai Gadiin p^odrang chyog-las, " From the 
Jyal-wa's castle of Gadan," — Jyal-wa standing for Jyal-iva jya-mts'o^ 
the usual title of the Tal6 lama. On the reverse are theeight signs of 
good luck, each inclosed in a small circle, and in the center is what I take 
to be a lotus flower. These trankas are colloquially called Gadan tranka. 

Coins ot similar value, but minted in Nepaul, Indian rupees and 
Chinese bullion, are also in use, and rupees, from their purity and the 
impossibility of counterfeiting them, are in much greater demand than

have 110 means of testin<i,'. 

In the Museum collection is a full set of Tibetan coins (see also jjl. 27, 
fig. 3) ; all the older ones, bearing Chinese and Tibetan inscriptions, are 
plaster casts obtained from the British Museum cabinet, 

Chinese money scales {jama) are used by the Tibetans and in Mon- 
golia. The form met with throughout China iS shown on pi. 27, fig. 1, and 
pi. 28 shows a rough copy made in Taichinar Ts'aidam. In the latter 
the wooden beam is roughly indented to indicate onnces, tenths, and 
hundredths of ounces (in Tibetan called sraiKj, djo, and l-arma); instead 
of a brass tray one of buckskin suspended by horse-hairs is used, and 
the weight is a bullet rou?,hly flattened out. These scales fit in a wooden 
trough roughly whittled out with a knife. 

Money (see fig. 3) is carried either in a small leather bag (pi. 27, fig. 4) 
with a long buckskin string by which it is tied to the gown, or in a small 
pouch with a leather loop through which the girdle passes (fig, o). A.t 
Lh'asa the i^eople use portemonnaies of semicircular form made of red 
leather embossed and with an ornamental border. They have two 
pockets and close with a hook, with a large silver boss on the flap. 

In most parts of the country money is but little used, the people 
bartering for most of the things they require. Brick tea is used to such 
an extent in their.mercautile transactions that it is, for all practical pur- 
poses, a unit of value. Salt, f samba, boots in the Kokonor,2J/^/o, cotton 
cloth, and even walnuts (in the Bat'ang country), are accepted without a 
murmur instead of silver, and in most places one or any of these articles 
are preferred to it. 

Wriihig. — Tibetans write from left to right in horizontal lines, using 
a bamboo pen or nyugu (pi. 29, fig. 8), which they carry in pen cases 
(nyushii) of metal, brass, copper, or silver (figs. and 7), in form like a 
sheath, with a sliding top and rings on either side, by which it may be 
suspended by a cord from the girdle. Hanging from the same string 
is a small ink pot {napang) also of metal, in which they carry dissolved 
iiidia ink [natsa). In fig. 7 is shown a Lh'asan silver pen case and ink 
pot finely chased. The brass pen-case shown in fig, 6, made at Lit'aug, 
has the eight signs of good luck in repousse work on it, A small cast 
brass ink iiot from Lh'asa is shown in fig. 3. 

Chinese paper is usually used for letter writing, but when copying 
books or when printing the Tibetans use paper made in Nepaul and 
Bhutan from the bark of various species of Daphuene, and especially of 
Edgeworthia gardneri, which has been previously washed with a little 
milk and water, so that it may not blot. They also manufacture them- 
selves a paper from the root of a small shrub, which is of a much thicker 
texture and more durable than Daphne paper. In western Tibet this 
paper is manufactured with a species of Astragalus, the whole shrub 
being reduced to pulp. (J. D. Hooker, Himalayan Journals, ii, 162,)* 

* See also B, H, Hodgson, Miscellaneous essays relating to Indian subjects, ii, p. 251. 



720 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Printiufi. — Printing is done in Tibet exactly as in China. The manu- 
script, written on very thin paper, is pasted over a smooth, thin bh)ck of 
wood, and with a small chisel the surfoce of the block around the letters 
is carefully removed to a depth of about one-eighth of an inch. Ink is 
rnbbed lightly over the block, a sheet of paper is then placed on it and 
a brush lightly passed over the sheet, which is, when removed, left to 
dry, when the other side is printed in like manner from another block. 

The Tibetans distinguish nine or ten diflerent styles of writing, but 
these may be reduced to three, capitals [icu-chan), small capitals 
(icu-med), and running hand {chyuff-yiff). Books are usually written in 
the first, and the two other forms are used in correspondence and for 
all the ordinar}^ purposes of life.* 

Like most Asiatics the Tibetans never sign their letters but seal 
them, nearly every one, even those who can not write, carrying a small 
seal {titse) suspended from his girdle. These seals have on them a letter 
or a religious symbol surrounded by an ornamental design. They are 
cut in iron and are frequently of very delicate workmanshiix In pi. 29, 
fig. 4, is shown a seal made in Derge; it is cylindrical, 2^ inches long, 
terminates in a knob head, and is bored out, chased, and fretted. 
The design is a sirastila or "hooked cross" in the center of a foliated 
motive. 

Letters and i^ackages are sealed with wax {lajya) made of lac, and on 
the wax is an impress of the sender's seal. A piece of wax is carried 
suspended to the girdle with the seal, as shown in the figs. 1, 2, and 5. 

Time recloning. — '• The Tibetans received their astronomical science 
from their neighbors in India and China, the Chinese also becoming 
their teachers in the art of divination. Their acquaintance with the 
astronomical and calendrical systems of these nations coincides with 
the propagation of the Buddhist religion by the Chinese and Indian 
priests, to whom they are also indebted for the respective systems ot 
defining the year. Both systems are based upon a unit of sixty years, 
differing, however, in the modes of denominating the years.'' (Emil 
Schlagintweit, Buddhism in Tibet, 273.) 

In these cycles of sixty years, when numbered according to the 
Indian principle, each year has its particular name, but when the 
Chinese mode is used, the names used in the Chinese duodecimal cycle 
are used five times, coupled with the names of the five elements or their 
respective colors, each of the latter being introduced in the series twice 
in immediate succession. A masculine and feminine are also frequently 
added to the above, represented alternately by p^o (male) and mo 
(female). 

* For further details on the suhject aud for specimens of all the various Tihetau 
scripts, I must refer the reader whom the subject interests to Sarat Chandra Das' 
paper ou " The sacred and oruanieutal characters of Tibet," in Journal Asiatic Society 
of Bengal, Lvii, part 1, pp. 41-48, and to the Appendix in Csoma de Koros' 
Tibetan grammar.

NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 721 

The first year of the first cycle of sixty years is A. D. 1026, conse- 
quently 1894 is the twenty-ninth year of the fifteenth cycle, or the 
" Wood Horse" (simig ta) year of the fifteenth cycle. 

The cycle of twelve years is copied on the Chinese, and needs no 
description here. This cycle is, in Tibet as in China, the one most 
commonly used, and in both countries to ask a person's age they say 
"to what sign (of the duodecimal cycle) do you belong- ?" 

Schlagintweit {Op. cit., p. 276) says: 

In books as well as in conversation, the dates of past events are not nnfrequently 
deteruiiuecl by counting back from tlie current year. For instance, the present year 
being 1863, the birth of Tsongkhapa, which occurred in 1355 A. D., would be said 
to have taken place five hundred and eight years ago. 

I may add that in conversation events which have occurred more 
than three or four years ago are invariably spoken of as having hap- 
pened in "olden times" or "a long while ago." Sometimes an event is 
referred to such and such a year of the reign of such and such a Tale-lama. 
On the whole Tibetans care very little about chronology of any kind. 

Another method of counting, but very little used, is that based on a 
cycle of two hundred and fifty-two years made by a combination of the 
five elements, 12 animals of the duodecimal system, and the masculine 
and feminine particles previously referred to. (Schlagintweit, op. cit.^ 
p. 281.) 

The Tibetan year (/o) is divided into twelve lunar months {dawa)^ 
named "first month," "second month," etc. Every three years an inter- 
calary month {(1(( Wafi) is added to compensate for the difference between 
the solar and the lunar year. The days are divided into twelve hours, 
as they are among the Chinese, from whom they have borrowed these 
divisions.* 

Medical knowledge. — As with their astronomy and other sciences, so 
with their medical science, the Tibetans have borrowed it from India 
and China. While nearly all their medical works are translations 
from Indian originals (see Csoma de Koros.Journ. Bengal Asiatic Soc, 
IV, 1 et seq.), their pharniacopceia is largely borrowed from China, and 
is nearly entirely vegetable. The Chinese derive a great number of 
their most valued simples from Tibet, and the large lamaseries of that 
country have medical faculties and pharmacies attached to them which 
supply not only their own people with drugs, but nearly the -whole of 
Mongolia. 

The Museum contains a few^ samples of Tibetan drugs, among which 
I will only mention the chi/ar-tsa gong hu {Cordyceps sinensis), tsampaka 
seed, or pod of the orxylum {Colosanthus indica, Blum.), and the yadro 
{Anemarhena asphodeloides, Haubury). 

* For further details on Tibetan chronology and astrology I riust refer the reader 
to Emil Schlagintweit, Buddhism in Tibet, pji. 273-328 ; Csoma de Koriis, Grammar 
of the Tibetan Language, 148 et seq.; Ph. E. Foucaux, Grammaire Tibctaine, and

722 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Rhubarb {djim-tsa), tlioiigli used sometimes for a dye, is never 
employed as a medicine in Tibet. Among the MongoJs its medicinal 
properties are known, but its use is contiued to camels. 

Ophthalmia is one of the commonest diseases in Tibet. When so 
affected the sufferer either wears Chinese smoked glasses or eye shades 
{migra) of horsehair (pi. 30, fig. 1). These eye shades consist in a baud 
of closely- woven horsehair about 2^ inches broad. The ends are -sewed 
into bits of embroidered flannel. Some of these shades are convex over 
the eyes, but 1 believe tbat these are not made in Tibet, but ou the 
Kan-su frontier, by Chinese. The eye shades are carried suspended 
from the girdle in a cylindrical cotton case, which can be pulled out of 
another case of similar material, but usnally handsomely embroidered, 
which slides over it. 

PI. 30, tig. 1, shows a migra and case made in eastern Tibet. The 
Chinese form of eye shade (fig. 2) is also occasioually used by Tibetans. 

It is interesting to note that a similar horsehair shade is worn by 
Persians in some parts of their country. (John Bell, Lives of Cele- 
brated Travellers, ii, p. 133.) 

Miscellaneous objects. — In Tibet sewiug is about equally divided 
between the two sexes, the men making most of their own clothes and 
all tailors being men. They use scissors and needles of Chinese make 
and woolen thread which they twist themselves. They sew toward 
the body. The men do not use a thimble, but women have a small ring 
made of copper resembling a seal ring, but where the stone should be 
there is lead. They put this ring on the forefinger and press the needle 
against it. It is used in parts of Mongolia (Ts'aidam) as well as in Tibet, 
but the Chinese thimble, in shape like our tailor's thimble, is rapidly 
superseding it in popular favor. 

A fly brush, made of the tail of a small yak, is shown in fig. 2, pi. 
31. The hair of the upper j^art of the tail has been scraped off and a 
handle made of the hardened hide. The hair is dyed a light red. The 
other fly brush (fig. 1) is of coir, and is in use in China. 

Rouge pads of felt which have been soaked in a red coloring matter 
are used by Mongol and Tibetan women. A portion of this is readily 
transferred to the cheek by slightly moistening the pad. These pads 
are i^repared in China. The Mongols use them much more commoul,y 
than do the Tibetans, who have naturally rosy cheeks. 

Loosely \voven scarfs of silk, called in Tibetan Watag (k\i-hiags)^ are 
in common use. Some of them have Luddhist symbols or inmges of 
the Buddha woven in the texture; others are of less value and are 
stiffened with plaster or rice powder. The usual color of these Watag 
is light-blue or white. The smaller ones are about 20 inches long 
and inches wide, and are worth a few copper cash apiece. The 
largest are frequently 40 or 50 feet long and of proportionately greater 
value. Most of these Fatag are made in Ch'eng-tu in Ssu-ch'uan for 
the Tibetan and Mongol markets. Hue thus describes the use of the 
Ic'atag :

NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 723 

The khata or scarf of felicitation plays such au important role iu Tibetan life that 
it is in place to say something of it. The khata is a piece of sillv, nearly as tine aa 
gauze. Its color is a bluish white. Its length is al>out three times its width ; the 
two extremities usually terminate in fringes. There are khata-s of every size and 
price; for it is an object that the poor as well as the rich can not do without. No 
one ever goes anywhere without carrying a small supply of them with him. When 
one pays a formal visit, when one has a service to ask of some one, or to thank a 
person, the first thing to do is to unroll a khata; it ia taken iu both hands and offered 
to the person one wishes to honor. If two friends, not having met for some time, 
suddenly run across each other, the first thing they do is to offer each other a khata. 
It is done with as much empressement and as promptly as one shakes hands iu Europe. 
It is also customary when one writes a letter to fold Tip in it a little khata. It is 
incredible what importance the Tibetans, Si-Fan, Hung-Mao-£ul, and all the people 
living to the west of the Blue Sea attach to the khata ceremony. It is among them 
the purest and sincerest expression of all noble sentiments. The finest words, the 
most costly preoents, are nothing without the khata. With it, on the contrary, the 
most ordinary object acquires immense value. If some one asks a favor of you, a 
khata in his hand, it is impossible to refuse it, unless one wishes to show contempt 
%r all rules of propriety. (Hue, Souvenirs d'uu voyage, ii, p. 88.) 

Besides these everyday usages referred to by Hue to which the Ic'atag 
is put, it is the most ordinary form of ottering- to the gods. Huudreds 
aud thousands of tliem are suspended on the statues of the gods in 
every temple or shrine in Tibet and Mongolia, and in some sections of 
the country a Ihxtag of a certain quality, called by the Chinese icu chai 
shou-pa, is a recognized standard of value in commercial transactions. 
(Land of the Lamas, pp. 66y 105, and p. 122, note.*) 

Ceremonial scarfs appear to have been at one time used among the 
Chinese. In 1575 Mendoza visited Fu-chou, in the province of Fu-kien, 
and was received with several other missionaries by the viceroy, 
who — 

commanded iu his presence to put about the neckes of the friers, in manner of a 
scarfe, to eyther of them sixe peeces of silke and unto the shoulders of their com- 
panions, and unto Omoncou and Suisay, each of them foure peeces and to everyone 
of their servantes two a peece * * * so with the silke about their neckes, and 
with the branches iu their hands, they returned out of the hall and downe the 
staires the way they came, and through the court into the streetes. (Mendoza, 
History of China, Hakluyt Soc. Edit., ii, p. 83.) 

A similar custom would appear to have existed in India in olden 
times; for we read in early Buddhist works of a piece of light stuff 
being put over the shoulders or around the neck of an honored 
person. 

Games and toys. — I have given much time, while traveling iu Tibet, 
to inquiring concerning toys for children and games, and have also 
carefully examined nearly all the works of Asiatic and European trav- 
elers for information on these subjects, but I have failed to hear of or 
learn anything of any importance on these subjects. What I wrote in 
The Land of the Lamas (p. 248) concerning the Tibetans of the Horba 
country seems applicable to the whole land:

724 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

I DDticed but few games of chance among them. Dice they have, but they are for 
divining ])urpose8, not for gambling. A few men who had passed much of their time 
among the Chinese i)layed cards, and chess is also known among them, but both are 
of foreign importation, and I coukl hear of no national game. . 

I have seen children amusing themselves with rag dolls and little 
bows and arrows, and Dr. Hooker (Himalayan Journals, i, p. 317), 
speaking of a place in upper Sikkim, says: 

I was much amused here by watching a child playing with a popgun, made of 
bamboo, similar to that of quill, with which most P'.nglish children are familiar, 
which propels pellets by means of a spring trigger made of the upper part of'the quill. 

Jack stones, or knuckle bones, is the only game I have seen played 
in the country, and that only on two or three occasions. This game is 
also known in China and Mongolia and, in fact, throughout eastern 
Asia. (See Bergmann, Voy. chez les Kalmuks, p. 151.) 

In Ladak and Balti the men play polo, which some authors say is a 
game of Tibetan origin. It was once very popular under the name of 
chaogan in India, in which country it was introduced by the Mussulman 
conquerors toward the end of the twelfth century, but after Baber's time 
it gradually became obsolete. (Alexander Cunningham, Ladak, p. 311.) 

Dr. Hooker (Himalayan Journals, i, p. 317) says that the Lepchas 

play at quoits, using slate for the purpose, and at the Highland game 

of "putting the stone" and "drawing the stone." The game of quoits 

is also played in the adjacent country of Bhutan and, I believe, in other 

portions of southern Tibet. Wrestling is also a popular amusement in 

most i)arts of Tibet; it is, I believe, that known among us as Greco- 

Koman. 

IX. 

BIRTH — MARRIAGE — DEATH. 

Birth. — " They (the Tibetans) do not wash and bathe a newly-born 
child, but the mother licks it as soon as it is born. After three days 
they smear the child's body all over with butter and expose it to the 
sun's rays for several days. Children are fed on parched meal (tsamba) 
mixed with soup, the greater part of them getting no milk whatever." 
(Journ. Boy. Asiat. Soc, n. s., xxiii, j). 231.) 

As a general rule the name given the children is chosen Dy a lama, 
who also casts the child's horoscope, and no festivities attend this nam- 
ing. The name chosen is usually a Buddhist term, such as Lozang, " the 
intelligent," or Dorje, "the thunderbolt {vadjra}^^^ iov a boy, while 
Padma, "the lotus," and Drolma, the name of the goddess Tara, who 
was incarnated in the Chinese and Nepalese consorts of King Srong-tsan 
gambo, are favorite names for women. Frequently two sons of a same 
mother will have the same name, and CKen. " the big one, senior," and 
Chhing^ "the little one, junior," will be added to their names. There are 
no family names. 

Cunningham says that in Ladak they celebrate a " birth feast " ( Tsas- 
Ton) and a "naming feast'' {Ming-Ton). 



NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 725 

The birth-feast (Tsas-Ton) is held one week after the mother's confinement, when 
all the relatives assemble at her home to celebrate the child's birth. All the guests 
make presents to the mother, according to their means, of pieces of cloth and food, 
and occasionally of money. The partj then dines, and the entertainment ends with 
a bowl of chang. The mother remains at home for one month. 

The naming-feast (Ming-Ton), which answers to our christening, is held just one 
year after the birth. The child is then taken before some great lama, to whom an 
offering is made of a rupee or a quantity of wheat or barley, according to the means 
of the parties. The lama pronounces a name, and the relatives retire to the usual 
entertainment of dinner and chang. (Alex. Cunningham, Ladak, p. 307.) 

Marriaffe.—MiiTvinge by capture still survives in portions of western 
Tibet, in Spiti, in Sikkim, and Bhutan, where the bridegroom and his 
friends, when they go to bring the bride from her father's home, are 
met by a party of the bride's friends and relations who stop the path ; 
hereupon a shain fight of a very rough description ensues, in which the 
bridegroom and his friends, before they are allowed to pass, are well 
drubbed with good thick switches. 

In other parts of Tibet the preliminaries of marriage are very simi- 
lar to those of China. Go-betweens [Bar mi or Long mi) on the part 
of* the man make overtures to the family of the girl, and if these are 
well received, astrologers are consulted to see whether the horoscope 
of the man and woman do not antagonize each other, and " if the good 
and evil of the life of the male harmonize in the calculation with those 
of the life of the female, longevity is counted upon. If not, the happi- 
ness of the couple will be short-lived." 

As soon as the astrologer declares that the Thun-tsi, i. e., the circumstances of har- 
mony necessary in the marriage, are favorable, the parents consult their friends and 
relations in order to ascertain the suitability of the match, and send one or two 
Bar mi (go-betweens) to.ascertain the views of the maternal uncle of the maiden 
selected regarding her marriage. He generally withholds his opinion under various 
excuses. According to the customs of the country the Shangjw (maternal uncle) of 
a maiden is the real arbiter of her fate in the matter of marriage. Nothing can be 
settled without reference to him. When his leave is secured the marriage proposal 
can be formally made to the maiden's parents.* 

The Bar mi, with the permission of the Shangpo, on an auspicious day during the 
increasing lunation of the month, proceed to the home of the parents of the maiden 
to present them with the Long chang, and therewith formally make the proposal of 
marriao-e. ^ * * The parents of the maiden receive the Bar mi with politeness, 
and.ser've them with wine and tea. After emptying one. or two cups of tea the 
Bar mi present them with a scarf, and beg leave to state their mission. Then they 
pour out chang, but before the parents will partake of it, the maternal uncle of the 
girl must be got to give his consent, and as soon as he has, the parents drink the 
chang and the betrothal is made. 

The marriage festivities generally last for three days at the home of the bride's 
parents, when the friends and relatives make her presents and the parents give her a 
dowry of cattle, clothes, jewelry, furniture, etc. 

Before leaving the bridesmaid's house the domestic dieties are propitiated by a 
Bonbo lama, and here also is performed the ceremony of trashi tre-wa, or calling down 
blessings and long life on her. After this the bride rides to her husband's house 

* This seems to point to a survival of the custom of reckoning descent through 
the females. 



726 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

preceded by a mau in white riding a white liorse.* On arriving there she is received 
with other ceremonies, especialiy noticeable among which is that of driving away 
any evil spirits which may have accompanied her from her parents' honse. The 
mother of the groom advances now toward the bride and presents her with a k'atag, 
tsamba mixed with butter, ahd ajar of milk. 

There is after this a marriage dinner and the friends and relatives of the groom 
present them with k'atag and presents, and it is they who supply the provisions for 
the marriage feast. 

After this a Ronbo priest gives the bride a new name which she is henceforth to 
bear, connecting it in some manner with the name of her mother-in-law. When this 
is performed a small piece of wood about 6 inches long is held to the lips of the 
bridegroom. The bride now sits in front of her husband, and takes the other end 
of the wood between her lips. 

In the meantime a tuft of wool is placed in the hands of the bridegroom, who 
draws out the fibers to some length. The bride takes it from his hands and twists 
it into a thread. This is called the ceremony of the first work of harmonious union. 
Then the party of the bride separate from that of the bridegroom, and sitting in 
rows of seats facing each other sing repartee songs. When the festivities terminate 
the bridegroom dismisses the kyel mi (the men who have escorted the bride from her 
home) with suitable presents. (Sarat Chandra Das, Marriage Customs in Tibet, 
Jouru. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, i, 1893, Pt. in, pp. 6-31. t) 

Although the cereinouies in differeut parts of Tibet vary somewhat 
from the above, they are analogous, as the betrothal and the marriage 
ceremonies, which are nothing but a long feast, are their essential fea- 
tures. Chandra Das, in the interesting articles from which the preced- 
ing facts are derived, describes the ceremonies as they are performed 
in Ladak, Sikkim, and central Tibet, and I must refer tbe reader'whom 
the subject interests to his paper for further details on the subject. 

So much has beeu written about Tibetan polyandry that it is only 
necessary to touch on it here. 

As far as my information goes the husbands of a given woman are 
always brothers, the elder brother choosing the woman and the younger 
brothers cohabiting \vith her. Whatever may have been the origin 
of i)olyandry, there can be no doubt that poverty, a desire to keep down 
population and to keep ])roperty undivided in families, supply suffi- 
cient reasons to justify its continuance. The same motives explain its 
existence among the lower castes of Malabar, among the Jat (Sikhs) 
of the Punjab, among the Todas, and probably in most other countries 
in which this custom prevails. 

Polygamy is not uncommon among the wealthier classes of Tibet 
throughout the whole extent of the laud, and monogamy is, naturally 
enough, frequently met with, esj^ecially among the Drupa tent dwellers, 
where it is in fact the invariable rule, I believe.f 

* Among the Mongols it is deemed proper when inviting a guest to one's tent to 
send him a white horse to ride.

NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 727 

Sarat Chandra Das, iu his paper on Marriage Customs of Tibet, says 
(quotiug Crooke's Notes aud Queries) : 

In Spiti polyandry is not recognized, as only the elder brother marries and the 
younger ones become monks. But there is not the least aversion to the adea of two 
brothers cohabiting with the same woman, and I believe it often happens in an 
nn?eco 4ized watparticnlarl^ among the landless classes, who send no sons ante the 
Znast'erest * ^ * In Spiti there is a regular ceremony ot divorce which xs 
Zetr used when both parties consent. Husband and wife ^oU tbe e^^^^^^^ 
thread repeating meanwhile, "Our father and our mother gave, another father and 
L h r took awa^y. As it was not our fate to agree, we separa e with -utual good 
will " The thread is then severed by applying a light to the middle. After a 
divorce a woman is at liberty to marry whom she pleases. 

I do not believe that in other parts of the country divorce or second 
marriage exist, though among the Kokonor Tibetans, at least it some- 
times happens that a wife deserts her husband to cohabit with another 
man or a husband his wife for another woman. 

Beath-Mortuary ceremonies.-Spe'^^^mg of the T\iug-hsiaiig, the 

Sui shu says : 

When people of eighty or over die the relatives do not mourn, for they say that 
thlll^^'re a'ched thf end of their allotted time, but if a young person ^ -« ^^^ -^ 
and lament, saying that it is a great wrong. (Sui shu, Book, 80; Conf T ang shu, 
Book, 221.) 

The T'ang shu (Book, 221), speaking of the Tung nil kuo which 
embraced in the seventh or eighth century the greater part of north- 
eastern Tibet, says : 

They wear mourning for three years, not changing their clothes and not washing 
When a man of wealth dies they remove the skin from the body and put it aside 
the flesh and bones they place iu an earthen vase, mixe.l with gold dust, and h^ 
they carefully bury. When the sovereign is buried several tens of persons lollow 
the dead into the tomb. 

Early European travelers in eastern Asia tell us that the Tibetans 
used to devour the bodies of their dead parents. Thus William ot 
Eubruk (Itinerarium, Edit. Soc. Ceo. de Paris, p. 289) says: 

Post istos sunt Tebec, homines solentes coraedere parentes suos defunctos, ut causa 
pietatis non facerent aliud sepulcrum eis nisi viscera sua. Modo tamen hoc demise- 
runt quia abhominabiles erant omni nationi. Tamen ad hue faciunt pulcros ciphos 
de capitibus parentum, ut iUis bibentes habeant memoriam eorum m jocunditate sua. 
Hoc dixit michi qui viderat. 

Piano Carpiui (Historia Mongalorum, ix, p. 058) says: 
VenitadterramBurithabet * * * qui sunti pagani. Quieonsuetudiuemmira- 
bilem imo potius miserabilem habent: quia cum alien, jus pater humana>, natura, 
debitum solvit, umnem congregant parentelam, et comedunt eum sicut nobis diceba-

Friar Odoric, who was the first European traveler to visit Tibet, 
gives a differeut account of their mortuary customs, and one more in

accordance with what we know to have obtained among the Tibetans 
for some centuries back. Charge.s of cannibalism against a remote 
people only known to the informants of the writer of a narrative by 
hearsay are not uncommon. To only mention one, I find tliat the early 
Arab travelers in China charged the Chinese of the 7th century, A. D., 
with eating all their enemies killed in war.* Altogether, I think there 
IS very little foundation for the charge made by Kubruk and du Plan 
Carpin. It is probably the result of a jumbled-up account of the true 
methods of disposing of the dead, which will be described f\irther on 
Friar Odoric says (H. Yule, Cathay and the Way Thither, i, p. 151): 
Suppose such an oue's father to die, then the son will say, "I desire to pay resi.ect 
to my father's memory;" and so lie calls together all. the priests and monks and 
players in the country round, and likeNvise all the neighbors and kinsfolk, and they 
carry the body into the country with great rejoicings. And they have a great table 
in readiness, upon which the priests cut off the head, and then this is presented to 
theson and the sou and all the company raise a chant and make manv prayers for 
the dead Then the priests cut the whole of the body to pieces, and wh;n they have 
done so they go up again to the city with the whole company, prayino- for him as 
they go. After this the eagles and vultures come down from the mountains and 
every one ta^kes his morsel and carries it away. Then all the company shout aloud 
saying. Behold ! the man is a saint. For the angels of God come and carry him to 
paradise. And m this way the son deems himself to be honored in no small de-ree 
seeing that his lather is borne off in this creditable manner by the angels. An"^d so 
he takes his father's head and straightway cooks it and eats it, and of the skull 
he maketh a goblet, from which he and all the family always drink devoutly to the 
memory of the deceased father. And they say that by eating in this way they show 
thoir great respect for their father. 

Colonel Yule, commenting on the preceding passage, says: 

Klaproth quotes passages showing a knowledge of this mode of disposing of the 
dead from Strabo, Cicero's Tusculan Questions, and Justin. Strabo also ascribes to 
theCaspi. the opinion that those whose bodies the birds appropriated were blessed. 
Herodotus and Mela ascribe such practices to the Issedonians and Scythians "Cor- 
pora ipsa lauiata et c*sis pecorum visceribus immista epulando consumunt. Capita 
ubi fabri expohvere auro viucta pro poculis gerunt." (Pomp. Mela, ii, p. l.)t 

I have shown in my paper "On the use of skulls in lamaist cere- 
monies" (Proc. Amer. Orient. Soc. Oct., 1888, p. xxii) the notions pre- 
vailing in Tibet on this subject. As further elucidating the above pass- 
age from Odoric's travels, I may mention that the rapidity with which 
the body of the dead is devoured by the birds or other animals to whom 
it IS fed IS held to be a proof of the good luck (or Imrma) of the deceased, 
and therefore the skull of one who has been so devoured is a good one 
out of which to make a libation bowl. 

Chinese authors describe as follows Tibetan mortuary customs: 
When a person dies in Tibet the corpse is tied up with ropes, the face being put 

the everyday clothes of the deceased and put in a rawhide bag. The men and

ropes from the rafters and re(iuest the lamas to come read the sacred books. 
A few days later the body is cavrit-d to the corpse cutter's place, where it is tied to 
a stake and the Hesh cut oti' and given to dogs to eat. This is called a " terrestrial 
burial." The bones are crushed in a stone mortar, mixed with tsamba, made into 
balls, and also given to the dogs or thrown to the vultures, and this latter mode of 
disposing of them is called a " celestial burial." Both these methods are considered 
highlv desirable. . 

Tiie poor dead are buried in the streams, the corpse being simply thrown m. This 
is not an esteemed mode of burial. The bodies of lamas are burnt and cairns erected 
over their remains. (Jour. Roy. Asiat. Soc, n. s., xxiii, pp. 231-232; Conf. Land of 
the Lamas, pp. 81, and 286-287.)* 

Georgi {oj). cit., p. 443) gives some interesting details, which I have 
not seen noticed elsewhere. He says : 

Mos estetiam, ut Summorum Lhamarum, aliorumque paucorum cadavera velsan- 
dalo quodcum aloes li-no nounulli confundunt, comburantur, vel balsamo condita 
sacri's in loculis reponantur. * ^ * Vulgaris <iuo.iue ac fere quotidiana consul- 
tudo in Civibus, houestisque hominibns sepeliendis ist haec servatur. Lhania, vel 
Traba quivis aninam, nt somniaut, e sunimo capite cadaveris ad hue tepescentis 
prinium educit. Educit autem hoc pacto cutem verticis digitis arete prehendam, et 
coirncratam tam celeri ac vehement! succussionis impetu attrahit, ut eam uuo momento 

subsifire, ac crepitarefaciat. Tum vero, inqmuut, anima defuncti erupisse creditur. 
Capt. Samuel Tiu'ner (Embassy, p. 260) says: 

It is the custom of Tibet to preserve entire the mortal remains of their sovereign 
lama only; every other corpse is either consumed by fire or given to be the pro- 
miscuous food of beasts and birds of prey. As soon as life has left the body of a 
lama it is placed upright, sitting in an attitude of devotion, his legs being folded 
before him, with the instep resting upon each thigh and the soles of the teet turned 
upward. " ' * The right hand is rested with its back upon the thigh, with 
the thumb bent across the palm. The left arm is bent and held close to the bo.ly, 
the hand being open and the thumb at right angles with the tingers touching the 
point of the shoulder. This is the attitude of abstracted meditation. 

If we seek for mortuary customs similar to those of the Tibetans we 
have not far to go to and them among other Buddhist people, who 
may probably have seen in the custom of having their dead bodies 
fed to birds or beasts a supreme act of charity, for which Gautama 
Buddha himself set the example when, in several of his births, prior to 
his reaching Buddhahood, as related in the Jataka, he gave his body 
as food to hungry tiger whelps or other famished animals. 

In Siam it is not uncommon for a person to direct that his body after 
death shall be cut up and fed to vultures and crows (Sir John Bow- 
ring, The Kingdom and People of Siam, i, p. 122), and in Korea it is cus- 
toutary, after the bodies of lamas have been consumed by fire, to mix 
the ashes with rice flour and feed them to birds. The "towers of 
silence" of the Parsees in which the bodies of the dead are devoured 
by birds is another analogous method, but the reasons which have called 
this custom into existence with them, are, of course, quite different.t 

* For a vivid description of a " terrestrial burial," see Annales de la Propagation 
de la Foi, 1865, p. 289; Conf. also Georgi, Alph. Tibet., p. 441 et seq. 

tThe Kafirs put their dead in boxes and expose them on the tops of high moun- 
tains (Sir P. Lumsden, Jour, Anth. Inst, iii, p. 361. 



730 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

In Ladak bodies are burned fifteen or twenty days after death, during 
wliieli time prayers are said by lamas. In the case of a very wealthy 
man or a chief, after the body has been burned in a metal vessel, 
the ashes are carefully collected and made into an image of the 
deceased. A ch'iirten or pyramid is erected for the ashes, and in it are 
placed various kiuds of grain, precious stones and metal, rolls of 
prayers and incense. 

The body of a great lama is interred in a sitting posture with his 
clothes and all the implements of worshii) he was accustomed to use 
daily. The coftiu is deposited in a ch'iirteu, before which for some time 
food and water are offered daily, and a light is kept burning every 
night. (Alex, Cunningham, Ladak, p. 309.) 

As to their signs of mourning, Chinese authors tell us that the Tibe- 
tans, both " men and women put on mourning clothes, and for one 
hundred days they wear no colored clothes, and during that period 
they neither comb their hair nor wash. The women do not wear their 
earrings and put away their prayer beads, and these are the only changes 
(in dress) they make. The rich invite lamas at short intervals to come 
and read the sacred books, so as to procure for the deceased the joys 
of the nether world. After one j^ear it is all at an end." ( Journ. Koy. 
Asiat. Soc, n. s., xxiii, p. 233.)

RELIGION-LA3IAS-RELIGMOUS ARCHITECTURE-OBJECTS CONNECTED 
WITH RELIGIOUS WORSHIP. 

It does not enter into the plan of this paper to describe even cur- 
sorily the religious beliefs of the Tibetans. Many works have already 
been written on the subject, but much remains yet to be done before 
we possess a thorough knowledge of it. Buddhism, which was intro- 
duced into the country in the seventh century A. D,, has remained 
since then the religion of Tibet. It is that form of Buddhism which is 
known as Mahayana Buddhism, in which magic demonolatry and mys- 
ticism have become such commanding features that it is with difficulty 
that we can trace in the forms of worship obtaining at present in Tibet 
any of the simplicity characteristic of early Buddhism and still to be 
found, to a certain extent, among the Buddhists of Southern Asia.* 

The Buddhism of Tibet is usually called Lamaism, the word "lama," 
written 6/a-»irt and meaning "the superior one," being that given by 
Chinese and foreigners generally to the members of the Buddhist 
monastic order in Tibet. In Tibet, however, this word is reserved for 

* Primitive Lamaism may be defined as a priestly mixture of .Shivaic mysticism, 
magic aud Indo-Tibetan demonolatry overlaid by the thinnest veneer of Mahayana 
Buddhism. And to the present day Lamaism still retains these features. * # * 
But neither in the essentials of Lamaism itself nor in its sectarian aspects do the 
truly Buddhist doctrines, as taught by Sakya Mum, play any leading part. (L. A. 
Waddell, Lamaism and its Sects, in lmi>. and Asiatic Quarterly Review, vii. and his 
Buddhism of Tibet, p. 17.) 



NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 731 

those monks who have not only taken the highest theological degrees, 
but who have also led a saintly life and become famed for their knowl- 
edge. The word draba is used by Tibetans as a generic term for all 
persons connected with the order, monks as well as lay brethren.* 

The usual dress of the lamas consists in a kilt reaching down to a 
little above the ankle, a close-fitting waistcoat, similar to that worr by 
the laity (see p. 087), and a shawl passed around the body, and the 
left arm, the end thrown over the right forearm, so as to leave the right 
shoulder and arm uncovered. The head is shaved and the lamas wear 
no head covering except during church ceremonies or when traveling j 
in the latter case they wear the same kind of hats as the laity and also 
the same kind of clothes; and in the former, hats of yellow or red 
color, varying in shape according to the school or sect to which 
their convent belongs. Gelugpa lamas usually wear a high yellow hat 
with a fringe, closely resembling the helmets worn by carabiniers. (pi. 32.) 
It is called dja-ser or " yellow hat." t The clothes of the wealthier lamas 
are made of tirma (see p. 699), on which are neatly sewed a few little 
patches, as it is forbidden them to wear any but torn or worn-out stuffs. 
Those of the poorer lamas are of pniT^t 

Emil Schlagintweit (Buddhism in Tibet, pp. 170-173) says of the dress 
of lamas (he in all probability refers to those of Ladak) that "their 
caps are made of double felt or cloth, between which are put charms. 
The shaii^e of the cap varies considerably, but it is curious that they 
are all of Chinese or Mongolian fashion, whilst the form of the robes 
has been adopted from the Hindus. ' Most of the caps are conical with 
a large flap, which is generally doubled up, but is let down over the ears 
in cold weather. The head lamas wear a particular cap, generally low 
and conical, and some head priests of western Tibet have an hexagonal 
hat formed of pasteboard, and showing four steps diminishing toward 
the top."§ 

Others wear a miter of red cloth oruamented with flowers of goUl worked in the 
stnft". This latter kind of cap bears a remarkable resemblance to the miters of 
Roman Catholic bishops. 

The gown reaches to the calves, and is fastened round the waist by a slender gir- 
dle ; it has an upright collar and is closely buttoned up at the neck. In Sikkim the 
lamas occasionally wear, slung round the shoulders, a kind of red and yellow striped 
woolen stole. 

The inner vest has no sleeves and reaches to the haunches. The trousers are 
fastened to the waist by a sort of lace running in a drawin g hem. In winter they

Kceppen, Die Religion des Buddha, Vol. ii , and Emil Schlagintweit, Buddhism in

for various interesting details, to Sarat Chandra Das, Indian Pundits in the Land of 
Snow, and to Dr. L. A. Waddell's, The Buddhism of Tibet, now the standard work on 
this subject.

are woru over the larger gown as a better protection against the cold. In Bhutan 
the lamas wear, instead of trousers, philibegs hanging nearly as far as the knee. 

The cloak is worn, in the way previouslj^ described, by all lamas; it 
is their distinctive ecclesiastical dress. 

The costume of the nuns {ani) is in all essential particulars the same 
as that of the monks; in fact, it is quite difficult to tell an old ani from 
a man when one meets her with shaved head, a prayer-wheel in one 
hand and alms bowl in the other, wandering- from house to house 
begging. 

Other styles of headdress, as worn in eastern Til)et, are described in 
my Land of the Lamas, p. 238. (See also Alex. Cunningham, Ladak, 
p. 372.) 

The boots of lamas are of the kind previously described (p. 680), the 
only peculiarity being as there stated, that the vamps are of white cloth 
and the tops of red pulo. 

The costume worn by lamas in Tibet is, with slight modifications, the 
same as that still worn in Nepal by Buddhist monks, and which was 
originally the national costume of the inhabitants of that country, and 
was probably borrowed from the latter by the early Tibetan monks. 

At religious ceremonies the priests wear * * * a close-fitting jacket called the 
"chivasa" and a long skirt or petticoat called the "nivasa," which reaches to the 
ankles, and which is gathered at the waist into a number of small plaits or folds. 
The chivasa and nivasa are joined together into one dress at the waist, round which 
there is wrapped an ordinary " kammerband" or thick-rolled waistcoat. (H. A. 
Oldfield, Sketches from Nepal, ii, 140.) 

Eelicjious buildings.— UeligUms bnildings and monuments in Tibet com- 
prise, (1) Gon/>a or monasteries; (2) X/ra-AVin// or temples; (3) Mch^od- 
rten (pronounced cWiirten), literally "otteriugs receptacle," and perhaps 
better known by their Indian name of chaitya, and tsa-tsa Wang, recep- 
tacles for offerings called tsa-tsa-, (4) 2Lani walls, or piles of stones on 
which are incised prayers or magic formulas; (5) Lab-tse, or heaps of 
stones on the summits of mountain passes. 

The monasteries usually consist of rows of small houses of the usual 
Tibetan style of architecture, built in close proximity to, and commonly 
around, one or more temples. These houses consist of a dwelling, gen- 
erally two stories high, a storehouse and a small courtyard. The 
ground floor of the dwelling is used as a stable. The outside walls of 
the houses are painted white, and those of the dwellings of high lama 
dignitaries red. These houses belong to individual lamas, who .rent 
portions of them to pilgrims or to resident lamas who have no homes of 
their own. 

Around the whole monastery is usually a high wall, and the approach 
to the main entrance is marked by rows of ch'iirteus and mani walls. 
All lamas- residing within a gonba are entered on a register, and are 
obliged, when duly qualified after a period of study, to take part in the 
daily ceremonies performed in the house of assembly [duWang). In

cousicleratiou of this they are supplied daily with tea, and aiso receive 
an annual allowance of barley. The lamas partake of their first meal 
after noon, until which time they are only allowed to moisten their lips 
with water. For this purpose they carry in their belts a little copper 
or silver bottle sewed in a bit of trulc (see pi. 33, fig. 2). This one has 
two brass bands around the mouth; it has a brass stopper, on the top 
of which is a hole, through this passes a leather string, by which the 
stopper is held in place. 

The temples {Wa-Wang) are throughout Tibet of a Chinese style of 
architecture, the roofs being, however, flat, dirt covered ones, except in 
some of the larger and more famous temples, where Chinese tiles, yellow 
or blue, have been used. The orientation of the temples does not appear 
to be a matter of much importance, as I have seen some facing south, 
others facing east, but 1 do not remember having ever heard of any 
lacing west. Schlagintweit [op. cit., p. 188) says: 

Tbe walls of the temples look toward the four quarters of heaven, aud each side 
should be painted with a particular color, viz, the north side with green, the south 
side with yellow, the east side with white, aud the west side with rod, but this rule 
seems not to be strictly adhered to. 

Most temples, as a matter of fact, are painted red, and the columns 
in front of them are also frequently painted of the same color. 

As to the interior arrangement of the temples, I must refer the reader 
to Dr. Waddell's work (p. 287 et seq.) aud to Georgi's Alphabetum Tibet- 
anum (p. 406 et seq.),m which latter work will be found a very detailed 
description of the great temple of Lh'asa (the Jo k'ang). 

The ch'iirten or "receptacles for offerings" are built over the remains 
of revered lamas, or else they are simply decorative or commemorate 
some important event. When simply used as receptacles for offerings 
they are filled with tsa-tsa, that being the name given to a small 
clay cone which the Tibetans make m incalculable thousands in molds 
and deposit in these ch'iirtens. In some parts of the country they build 
little hutches of rough logs for this purpose. These are called tsa-tsa 

li'ang. 

These tsa-tsa are usually conical, in imitation of the form of the ch'ur- 
en. In figs. 3, 4, and 5, of pi. 33, are depicted another variety of tsa- 
tsa, flat and in the shape of a shrine. In one of these, which is 3 inches 
long and about 2 wide, are 10 ttgures of gods in relief; in another is 
Tsepamed (Amitayus), and in a third Tsongkapa is represented. 

The form of the chortens varies much more than that of their prototypes, the 
stupas. The base of the stupa is a cylinder or cube, upon which a body shaped 
like a cupola is set up. Stupas which have been broken down have been found to 
be solid buildings, with a little shrine in the center only, in which has been deposited 
the burnt bones of a human being, together with coins, jewels, and inscribed slabs. 
The bones are sometimes inclosed in small cases made of the precious metals. 

In the Tibetan chortens this form has in general undergone considerable modifica- 
tions. The unaltered ancient type has remained limited to the smaller chortens put 
up in the temples. The principal difference between a stupa and chorten is that in 



734 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

the latter the cupola is either surmounted by a cone or that it is inverted. The 
most general style is the following: The base is a cube, upon which rests the 
inverted cupola. This cu])ola is the principal part. It incloses the objects enshrined, 
and in it is the hole leading to the sjjace for the ofierings. A graduated pinnacle 
rises above it, and tins is either a cone of stones or a wooden spire. It is surmounted 
by a disk placed horizontally and a spear-shaped point, or, iustead of it, by a crescent 
supporting a globe and the pear upon that. * * » 

The materials used for the choiteus in the open air are rough stones, bricks, or 
clay; they are almost all of solid masonry. The outer surfaces are thickly plastered 
with mortar, which is colored red with the dust of pounded bricks. * * # j'Ijq 
height of the chorten is in general from 8 to 15 feet, though a few considerably 
exceed this latter height. » ^ * Those set up in the temples are molded from 
metal, or, more generally, from clay mixed with chopped straw. Occasionally they 
are carved of wood, but such chorten scarcely ever exceed 4 feet. They are often 
not higher than as many inches. (Emil. Schlagintweit. Buddhism in Tibet, pj). 192- 
196.)' 

There is iu the Museum collection a i)hotograi»li of the celebrated 
lamaist sauctuarv of Wu-t'ai shau {Ri-vo tse na), iu Shau-hsi, in uorthern 
Ohiua, which shows a very fine ch'lirten, probably 00 feet high, with a 
large gilt spire of the horizontal circle and vertical disk and crescent 
style described by Schlagintweit. In this ch'lirten is said to be kei)t a 
body relic of the Buddha Gautama. 

Mdni walls. — This name is given to long, low walls of rough stones, 
on the surface of which are incised sacred formulas, usually the 
famous six-syllable formula Omi mdni padme hum. The name given 
tlie wall is derived from the name of this prayer, which is col 
loquially called "the mani." They are also known as inendong, prob- 
ably written mang dong, " many stones." Frequently images of gods 
are incised on the stones, and I have also seen long passages of the 
Scriptures on them. Frequently a whole mdni wall will be covered with 
slabs on which are inscribed one of the long theological works in which 
lamas so delight, sometimes the Pradjna paramita in 8,000 verses. 
Plate 34 shows an inscribed stone from iimd)ii wall in a Bonbo country 
^f northeastern Tibet (Jyade). It is of slate, is painted red, and the 
mantra incised on it is Om, matrimuye sale hdu, a favorite one of the 
Bonbos. 

Schlagintweit {op. cif., p. 197) says the longest mdni wall known of 
is 2,200 feet long. Some, he says, have a kind of tower at either 
■end, occasionally in the form of a ch'iirten, with a sacred image in 
front, and a large pole to which flags with prayers are attached are 
also not unfrequent at the ends of manis. Travelers, when passing 
along these mdni walls, leave them on their left side if they are true 
believers, and on their right if they belong to the Bonbo faith. t 

Labtse or lieaps of stones, also called dobong^ and in Mongol obo, are 
to be seen on the summit of every pass in Tibet, and frequently at the

mouths of the valleys leading up to them. Though in all probability 
they had no religious signitication originally, they have acquired one, 
and the stone which every traveler as he passes by does not fail to 
throw on the heap, is now put there as an offering to the gx)ds, and 
when throwing it down each one makes a short prayer, which ends 
with, '^Lhajya-lo, Ilia jyaW ''Gods, (give me) a hundred years; gods, 
(give me) a hundred years." 

In these stone heaps are usually stuck large bunches of brusliwood 
and also freciuently huge wooden arrows, the meaning of which latter 
I have failed to ascertain. Bits of wool, rags, and pieces of cotton on 
which are stamped mantras and dhdranis flutter from the branches or 
hang in long rows from strings tied to them and to some big stone 
fifty or more feet oft'.* 

Stone heaps similar in shape and built for similar purposes are found 
in the Navajo and Moqui countries in Arizona. Speaking of the 
Moqui, Fewkes says : 

Ma-sau-wub shrines are simply heaps of sticks or piles of stones, and it is cus- 
tomary for an Indian toiling up the trail with a heavy bundle of wood on the back 
to throw a small fragment from the load upon these shrines or to cast a stone upon 
them as he goes to his farm. These are offerings to Ma-sau-wuh, the fire god, or 
deity of the surface of earth. (.1. Walter Fewkes, Journ. Araer. Ethnology and 
Archaeology, iv, p. 41.) 

The custom of making ofteiings on mountain tops is too common in 
other countries, especially in South America, to require more than a 
passing reference here. Acosta, in his History of the Indies (ii, p. 309, 
Hakluyt Soc. Edit.), says of the Peruvians; 

They have used as they goe by the way, to cast in the crosse ways, on the hilles, 
and toppes of mouutaines, which they call Apachitas, olde shooes, feathers, and 
coca chewed, being an herb they use much. And when they have nothing left, 
they cast a stone as an offering, that they might passe freely, and have greater 
force, the which they say increaseth by this means. ** * * They used another 
offering nolesse absurd, pulling the hair from the eyebrowes to offer it to the Sunne. 
hills, Apachitas, to the winds, or to any other thing they feare. 

VYe also find this custom of offering rags at sacred shrines in Ire 
land and among the Mohammedan peoples of northern Africa. 

The custom of walking around a sacred building or monument, a 
custom called li'onca in Tibetan, was followed in India in the early 
days of Buddhism as well as by the wild Turkish tribes which inhab- 
ited northern and northeastern Asia in the second century B. C. Thus 
in the Ch'ien Han shu, book 94, it is said that the Hsiung-nu and the 
Sieu-pi, at the great autumnal sacrifice to heaven, rode three times 
around a little clump of trees. It is also common in parts of Africa, 
as, for example, among the Oromo of Abyssinia (Borelli, L'Ethiopie 
meridionale, p. 210), and was followed centuries ago in northern Europe 
and m other parts of the world. (See Land of the Lamas, p. 67.)

work, pp 198-200. 



736 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

A Tibetau history of the sandal wood image of the Buddha, known 
as the Tsandan Jovo and now preserved in the Chan tan ssu at Peking, 
referring to the benefits to be derived from walking round sacred monu- 
ments, says (p. 11 et seq.) : 

He who walks around a cli'iirten. 
In all circuuistauces of life, 
By gods, nagas, and yakshas, 
As by rakslias, shall be honored. 

Whoever makes a ceremonial circle 

Of the ch'iirten of the Lord of the world [i. e . the Bnildha] 

Acquires more [might] than by reciting 

Chai'ms during a million of world jteriods. 

Fire and ])oisun and weapons 
Shall never bring about his death; 
Living in wisdom, in the fullness of time — 
When his life is run, he shall die. 

He who circumambulates a ch'iirten 

Shall have wealth of castles, wealth of land, 

Of villages a goodly stoie; 

He shall reach the summit of worldly bliss. 

While walking round the ch'iirten he must repeat the following Sans- 
krit charm: 

Namo Bhagavate ratna ketu radjaya Tathagathayu aryate samyak-sam-Buddhaya 
tatyatha. Om ratne, ratne, maha ratna, ratna vidzaya. Swaha. 

Objects connected with relif/ious ivorship. — The roii'a,ry {treng-wa) is not 
only an essential part of the lama's dress but of that of nearly all the 
laity, male and female, in Tibet. 

As a Buddhist article [says Dr. Waddell] the rosary is especially peculiar to the 
northern school of Buddhists, and the outcome of the esoteric teachings of the 
Mahayana school, instilling belief in the potency of muttering mystic spells and 
other strange formulas. (L. A. Waddell, Jour. Asiat. See. Bengal, lxi, p. 24, et seq.) 

On pi. 35 is shown the form of rosary in common use among lamas. 
It contains 108 discoidal shell beads, of uniform size, divided into four 
groups of 27 beads each by 3 red coral beads; where the two ends of 
the string of beads come together they are passed through a large 
amber bead, a smaller discoidal, and a conical one, so that the two 
look like a fat, long-necked vase. These last two beads are called 
dodzin {rdog-hdzin)^ "retaining or seizing beads.'' 

Four short leather thongs strung on the rosary beside the do-dzinhy 
silver rings have silver beads on each of them, and at the lower end of 
one there is a little silver dorje. These strings are used as counters 
{drang-dzin) in the following fashion : When a certain charm has been 
recited 108 times the first bead on the string, to which is attached the 
dorje, is slid up the string, and so on for each series of 108 repetitions till 
the tenth time; then the first bead on the string next to the dorje string 
is slid up, and so on for the four strings of counters. Usually the string

next to tbe one on which is huug the dorje has a bell {drilhu) attached 
to it; the third string has a magic peg [imrhii) on it, and the fourth a 
wheel [li'or-lo). 

Eosaries are frequently ornamented with small coral or turquoise 
beads hanging from them, and it is usual to put narrow silver rings on 
either side of the large coral beads dividing the successive groups of 
beads in the string. 

Another treng wa, the beads of which are sections of human skulls, 
and the dividing beads pieces of conch shell, is in the Museum collec- 
tion. The (io-dzin are two in number, a large amber bead and a small 
wooden one. Such rosaries, Dr. Waddell remarks (loc. siq). cit.), are 
especially used for the worship of Borje jig-cWe (Yama), the King of the 
Dead. 

One set of small beads, of narrow discs of rosewood, with four red 
coral beads, is shown in fig. 1 of pi. 36. In this set the coral beads have 
to be counted, so as to complete the number of 108. This string is as 
it came from the dealer, and has no counters on it. Such rosaries are 
apparentlyof the class called " red sandal- wood rosary" by Dr. Wad- 
dell, which, he says, are used only in the worship of tlie fierce deity 
Tamdrin, a special protector of lamaism. 

Fig. 2 shows a rosary of discoidal beads of yellow wood, in which 
narrow lines of lighter color radiate from the center to near the circum- 
ference. The dividing beads are of the same material as the rest of 
the rosary but slightly larger and thicker. This rosary belongs to the 
class called ser-treng, or " yellow rosary," and is the special rosary of 
the Gelupa, or reformed school of lamaism. It may be used for all 
kinds of worship, including that of the furies. 

On pi. 37 is shown a Chinese rosary of IS olive-shaped beads of 
some hard, light-brown wood (or seeds); each bead is cut into an 
image of one of the 18 Lohan (Arhats). This is the usual number of 
beads used in rosaries {su-chu) in China. Another Chinese rosary, 
made of some kind of rough brown seed, possibly the same as that 
used in Tibet for rosaries, and there called Bodhi shing, is in the Museum 
collection.* Dr. Waddell {op. sup. cit., 28) says the tree which bears 
this seed grows in the outer Himalayas. 

Besides the materials used in the manufacture of rosaries mentioned 
by Dr. Waddell, I found that the Tibetans greatly prized for this pur- 
pose two varieties of .seeds, the one, called by the Chinese feng-yen 
po-ti mu or " Bodhi wood with phoenix eyes," the other hsing y'ueh mu or 
" wood with the stars and moon on it." These seeds are turned spher- 
ical and then polished. The feng-yen Jcno is, I believe, the same as the 
Piii-po of the Cantonese, identified, if I am not wrong, with JSterculia 
lanceolata. 

Eosaries made at Wu-t'aishan, the famous lamaist sanctuary of 
northern China, are turned from pieces of poplar wood and stained

yellow. Great quantities are carried away from this place every year 
by Mongol aud Tibetan pilgrims. 

PI, 3G, tig. 3 shows a rosary of 99 bone beads divided into three series 
of 33 beads each by date stones. The two ends of the string pass 
through a large bead made of a piece of conch shell. This is the style 
of rosary used by Mohammedans in China. The number 99 corresponds 
to the number of the nauies or attributes of Allah.* 

Prayer icheels. — The same teachings which caused the northern Bud- 
dhists to believe in the eflQcacy of continually mumbling unintelligible 
formulas must be held responsible for the invention of the ingenious 
mechanical contrivance known as a " j)rayer wheel " or "prayer-barrel," 
which, when turned the right way — from left to right — is as efficacious 
as if the person turning it, or who had it built, recited himself all the 
prayers inclosed in it on printed slips of paper. Each complete revo- 
lution of the wheel counts as one repetition of all the prayers contained 
in the barrel. 

Alexander Cunningham (Ladak, p, 37o) says that the earliest men- 
tion of the prayer- wheel is found in the Records of the Western World 
of the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Fa-hsien, who visited India in the fifth 
century of our era. This, however, is an error resulting from a mis- 
translation in Abel Remusat's rendering of the Chinese text. Gen. 
Cunningham also gives a medal of Hushka (first century A. D,) on 
which is a man holding in his hand what he takes to be a fjrayer 
wheel. At all events the prayer wheel is and has been for five or six 
centuries at least a popular instrument in not only Tibet but in Korea 
aud Japan, in which two latter countries, however, only the larger 
cWos Vor-Jo are found. (See on this subject Emil Schlagintweit, Bud- 
dhism in Tibet, p. 229 et seq. and Land of the Lamas, p. 334.) 

The prayer-wheel is of two kinds: The first comprises hand wheels, 
wheels turned by the wind or by water, and small stationary wheels 
or barrels placed either in a house or in rows near a temple or along 
an interior gallery of a house or the base of a ch'iirten. The second 
class are nnich larger machines and are only found in temples. They 
are sometimes 30 or 40 feet high and !■> or 20 feet in diameter. In them 
is placed a collection of the canonical books of lamaism (Kandjur), and 
by means of bars fixed in the lower extremity of the axis of the barrel 
it is put in motion. These wheels, from the works in them being "the 
law " (ch^os), are called cJi'os k^or-lo, while the first class of wheels hav- 
ing usually only the formula oni mani pudme hum (colloquially called 
"the mani'') printed on the pages wrapped up in them, are known as 
mani li'or-lo. 

The prayer- wheel consists of a cylinder of metal, or, in the larger 
wheels, of leather pr even wood, through which runs an axle of wood 
or iron around which it pivots. In the interior are arranged, one on

top of the other, sheets of paper or leaves of a book on which =' the 
manV^ or some other spell is printed in very fine characters, the tiner 
the better. The sheets are wonnd on the axle from right to left, aud 
the wheel when set in motion must revolve in the opposite way, so that 
the writing passes in front of the person turning the wheel in the Tfnj 
in which it is to read, i. e., from left to right. 

A roughly made hand prayer-wheel with a felt barrel covered with 
coarse woolen cloth is represented in pi. 38. An iron pivot runs through 
the barrel and fits in a roughly carved wooden handle. The cylinder 
is covered with a piece of red cotton cloth, to the corners of which are 
attached glass beads. 

On pi. 39, fig. 2 is shown a hand prayer- wheel. The cylinder is of 
bronze, the top being ornamented with a silver wheel decorated with 
coral aud turquoise beads. The bottom has four dorje, aud on the 
sides is the six-syllable spell in landza characters in silver. On a band 
above this are dorje, and on a band around the bottom are lotus leaves. 
On the top is a wheel in silver in which are set coral and turquoise 
beads. This is a' very fine specimen of Tibetan workmanship. The 
top of the axis terminates in a silver ornament of pineai^ple shape. 

On this plate is also represented a small stationary table or wheel 
(fig. 1), the axle of which projects above the top, so that it maybe put in 
motion without moving it from the stand on which it rests. The cyliu- 
dei is of bronze with raised ornamentation of tJorje, and the mani 
prayer in Xepalese Sanskrit characters. 

In tig. 1 there is also represented a strip of Chinese paper on one side 
of which is printed the forumla Om, mani padine^ hum. This formula 
is repeated nearly 400 times on this sheet, and in one of the small 
prayer- wheels previously described about lOOx^ages can be wrapped in 
the cylinder. Consequently a complete revolution of the wheel is equiv- 
alent to repeating the formula 40,000 times. A prayer- wheel complete, 
from Darjeeling, India, is also shown in fig. 3. 

The cups used with the small j)rayer-wheels turned by the force of 
the wind are cut out of pieces of pine wood and are in shape exactly 
like the cups of an anemometer. (See Smithsonian Report, 1802, p. 
076, where is also shown a prayer- wheel turned by water.) 

Bits of cotton with prayers printed on them and tied to strings or to 
high poles placed over houses, and knowu as la-der, belong to the same 
class of objects as the prayer- wheels; each time these bits of stuff 
flutter in the breeze it is as if the prayer written on them had been 
recited. The figure of a horse is frequently stamped on these pieces of 
cloth and around it is a long formula. These are called Unig ta, or '' wind 
horses," and are, among many other uses, for the special protection of 
travelers. (See Bmil Schlagintweit, Buddhism in Tibet, p. 253 et seq., 
and Waddell, op. eit., p. 408 H seq.) 

The j)riucipal objects used by lanms in church ceremonies, or while 
reading the sacred books, are the small hand drum {damaru), frequently 
made of children's skulls and covered with snake skin, the bell {drilbu), 



740 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

and the dorje (the ludian I'iajra or Indra's thunderbolt). Next in impor- 
tance to thera come the holy-water vase {biimha), the mirror {me-long)^ 
the triang-ular nail {purbn), and tlie skull bowl {fUdpa). 

On pi. 40, iiji-. 2 is shown a damaru, made of two skulls attached 
together by a wooden disk cemented to them. Heads of devils and 
skulls are painted on them in red and blue. A small cotton band 
covers the disk between the two heads and projects a few inches, so 
that the person nsiiigthe drum may hold it in his hand, his thumb and 
forefinger being- placed around the disk of wood :;etween the drum- 
heads. There are two small knobs covered witli cloth depending from 
this band by short strings of such length that when the drum is twirled 
sharply around they strike the heads. This damaru was collected by 
Kev. C. H. A. Dall. 

The other figure on the same plate re])resents a damaru rather smaller 
than the preceding' one. The skulls of which it is made are not deco- 
rated, but the band by which it is held in the hand is of embroidered 
satin decorated with elaborately knotted silk tassels of Chinese make. 

The bell [dril-bu) of the lamas is of bronze and usually about 2f inches 
in diameter. In pi. 41, fig. 4 is shown a bell having on its outer 
surface near the handle certain mystic syllables, eight in number. On 
the interior surface are three mystic syllables and a 7-petalled flower 
in the dome. The handle is cylindrical and has a head of Dharmasiiv- 
mounted by a dorjc. This bell was made in Derge, whudi country is 
famous for the clear toned bells cast there. 

Similar to tlie preceding, except that the head of Dharma does not 
appear in the handle, which is only a half dorje, is the bell shown in 
fig. 5. This bell comes from the famous lamasery of Dolon nor, in 
eastern ^Vlongolia. 

The usual position in which the bell is held is in the left hand, the 
opening- of the bell pointed towards the body, the thumb against the 
handle and the fingers around the body of the bell. (For description 
of lamaist bells see Alex. Cunningham, Ladak, p. 373.) 

The dorje, or thunderbolt, is generally used with the bell, it being 
customary to hold it in the right hand between the thumb and index, 
the other fingers extended. It was looked upon in early times in India 
as a sacred symbol of Indra, and in Nepal it has become symbolical of 
the Buddha and his religion. Possibly this symbolism is known to the 
Tibetans, but I have not seen it mentioned in any of their sacred books 

The Nepalese scriptures say that a contest once occurred between Bnddha and 
Indra, in which the latter was defeated, and had wrested from him his chief and 
pefuliar instrument of power, the vajraor thuuderl)olt, which was appropriated as a 
trophy by the victor, and has ever sime been adopted by his followers as the favorite 
emblem of their religion. * * ** 

The Vajra and the ghanta or bell have a peculiar symbolic meaning attached to 
them by Buddhists, similar to that attached by Hindus to the Linga and Yoni. The 
Vajra represents linddha and corresponds to the Linga; the ghanta represents 
Prajna Devi or Dharma. whose head is often figured on its handle, and corresponds to 
the Youi. (H. A. Oldtield, Sketches from Nipal, ii, 199—200.)

Libation Bowl and Holy-water Vessel. 



NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 741 

The usual form given the dorje in Tibet is shown in tig. 3. It is of 
bronze and about 5 inches long. Exactly the same form is found iu 
Japan (tig. 2). 

Fig. 1 is another form of tlic dorji- used by certain sects in Japan. 
Here there are but tluee prongs at eacli end instead of tive, as in the 
more commonly used one. 

The holy- water vase (/>/n///><r or ts%'hi(m) is used in certain lamaic cere- 
monies connected with tlie worship of Ts'e-pa-med.* 

On pi. 42, tig I, is shown one of these vases made of brass, with the 
spout, top, and base heavily gilded. The vase is of Persian shape, 
with a large spherical body and slender bent spout. The neck is short 
and narrow and terminates in a tlaring mouth, in shape lilce an over- 
turned boMi. In the top of this is a suudl circular opening, in which a 
chased metal tube tits, reaching far down into the vase and liaving iu 
its u]>per end a bunch of lusa grass and some peacock feathers — this 
instrument is the asi)ergil. The vase has a covering of silk fastened 
around the neck so as to completely hide the vase. Such coverings are 
not only put ou these vases but on most objects used iu church worship, 
on the sacred images, books, etc., probably as a mode of honoring these 
sacred objects. The water used iu these vases has a little satfrou iu it 
and sometimes a little sugar. The vase is 6.J inches high and elabo- 
rately chased where exposed to view. The portion of the vase under 
the silk covering {iKtbzv or ''gown'') is ronglily beaten copi)er. Fre- 
quently these vases are of silver and liiiely chased over the whole of 
their surface. 

Tbo Tuisol, "to pray for ablution," ranks among the most sacred of the 13udclbist 
rites, ami is performed at everjf solemn assembly for the wasbiug away of sins. 
Water is poured out from a vessel similar to a teapot, called man«j;u,and alsobumpa, 
over the vessel's well-cleaned cover, called yanga, or a i)articnlar metallic mirror, 
melong, which is held so that it retlects the image of Sakyamnui, ■which stands on the 
altar. The water falls down into a tlat vessel, called dornia, jdaced ujuju a tripod. 
(Kmil Schlagiutweit, IJuddhism iu Tibet, p. 239, and T. W. Khys Davids, buddhism, 
p. '21S ct aeq.) See also Waddell, loc. siij). cit., in which he describes the ceremony 
called "The obtaining of long life;'' also W. W. Kockliill, Ou the lauiaist ceremony 
called ''The making of mani jtills'' (Journ. Amer. ( )rient. Soc, xui), which is ai cere- 
mony of the same class as that described by Dr. Waddell. 

The purhu or nail is a triangular nail ending in a sharp point. The 
handle is iu the shape of a half dorji', with a hunmn head terminating 
it. It is used iu exorcising evil spirits. (See Waddell, Buddhism of 
Tibet, pp. 483 and 488). 

The skull bowl is used in worshiping Ts'^-pa-med, when it is tilled with 
nectar brewed from ch'ang. After the ceremouy it is drunk by those 
l)resent. It may bo noted that various gods — among otliers TsV-pa iiied 
and Paldiin-lh'amo — are represented with skulls in their hands fdled 
with and)rosia [duil-isi, literally "devil's juice'*). The custom of using 
skulls as holy vessels, or eveu as eating bowls, is a very old one in Asia; 

*See L. A. Waddell, The so-called ''encharist" of the lamas, in Asiatic Quarterly 
Review, April, WM, and Buddhism of Tibet, p. 298, 444 et aeq. 



742 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

a certain class of lamas use them for the latter purpose at tlie present 
time. We find, however, in the Buddhist Vinaya or canon law, which 
dates from the early days of Buddhism, that monks were forbidden 
using skulls as alms-bowls as being then used by devil worshippers. 
(Sacred Books of the East, vol. xx, p. 89.) 

Fig. 2, on pi. 42, represents a libation bowl made of a human skull(a) ; 
it has alining of iron, with an ornamented coi^per gilt rim fitting on it. 
The cover {h) is finely and intricately chased; on each side is a landza 
character — or rather monogram — the mystic syllable om, with an ara- 
besque design surrounding it. The top is surmounted with four half 
dorje at right angles, a fifth and larger one forming a handle. The 
stand (<^') on which the skull rests is of gilt copper and triangular in 
shape. At the three angles are human heads painted white, red, and 
green. The triangular design on the face of the base seems to 
be flames, and the Chinese symbol of the ymig and the yin (the two 
principles of nature) appear in the middle of each side. For further 
particulars bearing on the mode of selecting and consecrating such 
skulls, I must refer the reader to my pai)er "On the use of skulls in 
lamaist ceremonies." (Proc. Amer. Oriental Society, Oct. 1888, p. 
XXIV, et seq.) 

The Museum collection contains also a few images of gods of the 
finest workmanship. They are made of copper, cast and then very 
finely gilt, chased, and polished. The interior, which is hollow, is filled 
with some of the same articles as are put in ch'iirtens (see Cunning- 
ham, Ladak, p. 30!)). When the image rests on a circular base of the 
open lotus flower style, these articles are inclosed in it. These images 
are all distinctly Brahmanic — a peculiarity of nearly all lamaist 
images — with the exception of the heads, which are usually made with 
terrifying features colored red, blue, or green. 

PI. 43 represents a small gilt image of Jambyang, the "sweet singer" 
{]\fanjushn) of the Indians, He is here represented seated, holding in 
his right hand the sword of wisdom with a flaming point, to dissipate 
darkness among men, and a noose in his left. Behind his left arm is an 
open flower, in which rests a book. 

Jambyang is the god of wisdom, and his principal sanctuary is at 
Wu-t'ai-shan, in the Chinese province of Shan-hsi. 

PI. 44 is an image of Drolma, "The Savioress," called in Sanskrit 
Tard. 

It is [says Dr. Waddell] to tliis attribute of being ever ready to help and ever 
approachable that she owes her popularity; for most of the other deities of 
"northern Buddhism" can not be approached without the mediation of a lama, 
while the poorest layman or woman may secure the immediate attention of Taraby 
simply appealing to her direct. 

Slie has tlie attributes of a female Avalokita, and in Tibet she is expressly regarded 
in her most poptilar forms as the Sakti or female energy of Avalokitesvara. (Dr. L. 
A. Waddell, .lonrn Roy Asiat Soc, 1894, p. 63 <>< se^.) 

This image was made at Ch'amdo in eastern Tibet.

NOTES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF TIBET. 743 

PI. 45 represents au image of Ts'e-pa-med, the " god of endless 
life;" in Sanskrit, Amitayns. This god is also known as Wu-pa-med, or 
"Endless light;" in Sanskrit, Amitabha. Under the name of Ts'e-pa- 
med he is implored for longevity. The god is represented seated, hold- 
ing before him in his right hand a bowl (often a sknll) filled with the 
water of life; the left hand rests with nptnrned palm in his lap under 
the right. 

PI. 46 represents Tamdrin; in Sanskrit, Ilayagriva. This god is 
one of the Drag-shed or gods who protect man against evil spirits. 
He is here represented with three faces of hideous expression and on 
his head is a crown of flames. He has six arms and two legs, and 
around his waist is a girdle of leaves. In his upper right hand he 
holds a noose, and in the lower an arrow; m his ui^per left hand is a 
8-leaved flower( ?) and in his lower left a bow. The middle rigiit hand, 
which he holds before him, has in it a cross dorje. The middle left 
hand is empty, the thumb touching the second and third fingers, the 
index and little linger held extended. A long rosary hangs around 
his neck, and he is kneeling on his left knee. He has three eyes in 
ea<'h foce, the third eye upon the forehead being that of wisdom.* 

PI. 47 shows a remarkably fine specimen of work, representing the 
god of wealth or god protector of treasures {Gnnl-ar yijiri norhn), also 
a Drag- shed. The god is three-faced, with a crown of flames. He 
stands erect on two elephants, and has six arms. The middle ones are 
held before him with offerings in them. The upper right hand holds 
a dorje, the npi^er left a beclion or club. The lower right holds a damaru 
or small hand drun), and the lower left a snare {dzagpa). This image 
was made at Lh'asa. 

PI. 48 is supposed to represent Ch'os-bjin jainba. The saint is 
clothed in a mantle fiilling over the arms, while his hands are held in 
the position of prayer or supplication. The earrings are peculiar and 
unusual. This image and the following were bought at the great lama- 
sery of Kumbum, and are not of as fine workmanship as the three pre- 
ceding ones. 

PI. 49 represents the image of some holy man, apparently a Chinese; 
but I have not been able to identify him. 

One of the principal treasures of the great lamasery of Kumbum is 
the so-called white sandal wood, si^rung from the hair of Tsongk'apa, 
the founder of the " Yellow church," who was born at this place 
toward the middle of the fourteenth century of our era. The leaves 
of Lhis tree are carefully collected and sold to pilgrims, who use them 
as medicine or wear them as charms in their gaico. Abbe Hue says that 
when he saw the tree, characters of the Tibetan alphabet were visible 
on every leaf and in the bark. At j^resent it is said that images of 
Tsougk'apa are sometimes visible on some of the leaves, when the person 

* Wherever seen in images of gods, the third eye in the middle of the forehead la 
the eye of wisdom, or foreknowledge. 



744 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

looking for them has sufficient faith.* The tree is probably a lilac. 
{Syringa villosa, Vahl.) 

A lot of leaves of this tree were bought by me at Kumbum in 1891. 

Trees sprung from the hair of saints are quite numerous in Tibet. 
Explorer U — G — saw, on the left bank of Tsangpo ch'u, below Chet'ang 
and near the Sangri Khama monastery, a hill overshadowed by cypress 
trees, "all of which sprung from the scattered hairs of a saint, which 
were cast to the winds hereabouts." (Keport of Explorations in Tibet, 
Bhutan, etc., p. 28.) Sarat Chandra Das saw at TashiFuupo a juniper 
bush in which the hair of Gedundrub, the founder of the lamasery, is 
still "said to exist." 

The Arab traveler Ibn Batutah saw, in the fourteenth century, at 
Deh Fattan, on the Malabar coast, a tree on the leaf of which there 
appeared every year, "written by the pen of divine power," the words, 
"There is no god but Allah, and Mohammed is the envoy of Allah." 
(Ibu Batutah, Travels, Defremery's edition, iv, p. 88.) This last-men- 
tioned tree was probably, according to Mr. T. Dyer, a c/raftophyllum. 

A small mold of wood with a number of figures of a loaded yak, of a 
man, a dog, etc., and Buddhist emblems cut in it, may be found in pi. 
33, fig. 1. It is used to mold figures in fsa^nba, which are afterwards 
colored and figure in certain ceremonies for expelling the demon of 
sickness.t 

The two most commonly used kinds of incense {sjws) are the larger 
sticks of the shakama pos or satfron-colored incense, also known as 
jamhling liun-jyab or " world pervading," on account of the great strength 
of the perfume, and a smaller variety which is of a deep violet color, 
and is in common use in all temples and for household worship. Great 
quantities of it are manufactured in central Tibet (Lh'asa and Shigatse) 
and exported to China, Mongolia, and every corner of Tibet.|: 

A frequently used substitute for incense consists in dried spines of 
the juniper {shiika) mixed with a little butter and salt, these ingredients 
making the spines burn more readily and completely. This kind of 
incense is very extensively used throughout Tibet and parts of 
Mongolia. 

PI. 50 shows a j)itcher G inches high, of cast brass, in the shape 
of an ewer. ]t is roughly ornamented with a series of lines and dots, 
and around the base is written in Tibetan characters a mantra. The 
handle is large and cast at the same time as the body. The use to 
which this ewer is put is not known, but it is certainly not a household 
utensil. It is a rough piece of work -, probably in an unfinished state. 

Musical instruments. — Music, both instrumental and vocal, is a promi- 
nent feature in lamaic ceremonies. The principal instruments used 
are the drum, trumpet, flageolet, cymbals, and conch shell. The drums

are of two kinds — the small hand drum previously described, aud the 
large drum [cWorna), which is cylindrical, about 2 feet in diameter and 
8 or 10 inches high. To it is fastened a handle about 3 feet long, by 
which it is held erect. It is struck by means of a stick shaped like a 
sickle, with a long handle. This drum and also the hand drum are 
apparently copied from two well-known kinds of Chinese drums. (See 
J. A. Van Aalst, Chinese Music, p. 70.) 

The big trumpet or dnnf/-eh''en is from 6 to 8 feet long, made of cop- 
per, aud is slightly bent so that the end may rest flat on the ground. 
A smaller trumpet is made of a human tibia, and is called lang-diing 
"leg-bone trumpet." No. 130386 is one of these.* A piece of skin 
(supposed to be human) is sewed around it, and a plaited lash about 20 
inches long hangs from its end. Such trumpets are used in exorcising 
ceremonies. Another form of lang-duufj is made with the mouthpiece 
and the lower portion of chased copper, the central part only being of 
bone. 

The hautboy (jyelinf/) used by the lamas is of Chinese origin and pat- 
tern, and calls for no particular remark beyond stating that most of them 
have loose or sliding tubes by which means the sounds are modulated. 
The cymbals {sinyen) used are also Chinese in shape and probably man- 
ufacture. A small kind of cymbal called ding-sha, the disks of which are 
about 2 inches in diameter and suspended horizontally by a short string 
so that their edges may be struck together, is also used by the lamas — 
not in church ceremonies, but only when reading prayers in their 
houses. This latter instrument is the Indian mandira, used to measure 
time in musical performances. 

Conch shells are used to call to prayers and for other i^urposes 
similar to those for which the big trumi)ets are used. They have fre- 
quently a metallic mouthpiece and are handsomely ornamented around 
the rims. There is a most beautiful specimen of such a conch shell with 
inscriptions on it in Chinese, Tibetan, Mongol, and Manchu in the Brit- 
ish Museum. Conch shells with whorls turning to the right are espe- 
cially prized, and a lamasery which is so fortunate as to possess one is 
famed throughout the land. (Land of the Lamas, p. 110.) 

A system <»f musical notation is used by the lamas to teach chant- 
ing and accompanying liturgies. These books, called yang yig, " hymn or 
songbooks," contain akind of descriptive score, consistingof wavy lines, 
showing when and for what space of time the voice should rise or fall. 
Plate 51 shows several pages of this music. Where the conch shells 
should be sounded or the drum beaten is shown by a figure of a shell or a 
drumstick. This system of notation is specially interesting from the 
fact that it is, so far as I am aware, the only one found in eastern or 
central Asia. (Plate 51, and Land of the Lamas, p. 88, also Waddell, 
Buddhism of Tibet, p. 432.) t

746 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS FROM THE CHINESE BORDER LANDS. 

lu fig, 1 of pi. 52 is shown a sboe made of oxliide and in sliape some- 
what like an Indian moccasin. The sole is turned up all round the 
vamp, which latter has a tongue coming over the instep. These shoes, 
called p'i-hai in Chinese, are worn in the extreme western part of Kan-su 
by the poorer classes. 

Inside these shoes coarse woolen socks, tnit of sheep's wool, are 
worn (tig. 2). These socks are invariably knit by the men. It is, by 
the way, no uncommon thing in Mohammedan countries for the men to 
knit. I have noticed it in Algeria, and Friar Odoric, speaking of the 
people of Huz in Khuzistan (Persia), remarks of them "and 'tis the 
custom for the men to knit and spin, and not the women." (H, Yule, 
Cathay and the way thither, i, ^. 53.) 

Sandals made of hemp (figs. 3 and 4) are known as ma hai in western 
Kan-su where they are made and worn. They closely resemble the 
Ssu-ch'uanese sandal (tigs. 5 and 6), woven of rice straw over hem])en 
cords, with some slight difference in the width of the piece in front to 
protect the great toe. The Kan-su sandal is in all respects like the 
Korean one. In all these sandals a string ])asses through loops fast- 
ened to the sole and heel and is tied around the ankle. 

In western Ssu-ch'uau, where these sandals are the only foot gear 
worn by hill porters, iron clamjis or crampons, consisting in an oval 
plate of iron with four short fiat i)oints on them, are tied to the middle 
€f the foot when the ground is wet or slippery. 

'The collection contains a brass saucepan 9 inches in diameter, the 
back and handle beaten out of the same piece. It is used by Mongol 
and Chinese traders when traveling, not only as a pan but as a ladle. 

A copper tea-kettle with top fitting closely in it is also in the collec- 
tion. It is egg-shaped, with a rude handle, and is without a spout. It 
is manufactured by the Chinese of Hsi-ning and Tankar in western 
Kan-su for the Tibetans and Mongols of the Kokonor. 

A wooden pail in the collection, made of numerous wooden staves 
held together by three brass hoops, is from the Ordos Mongols. It has 
a brass ear and ring on each side and through this passes a yak hair 
handle. It is a little larger at the bottom than at the top. Such pails 
are very much valued by these Mongols, and the handles are frequently 
decorated with cowrie shells or beads. 

In the collection is a fine blanket of mixed goat hair and sheep's 
wool dyed a clear brown color. It is made of four strips, each IS inches 
wide. Such blankets are woven by the border Chinese for travelers 
and are practically waterproof. This one was bought in Kuei-hua 
Ch'eng (eastern Mongolia). 

Fig. 15 of pi. 5 represents a breast ornament worn by Mongol women. 
It is in the shape of two of the eight signs of good luck, "the fishes," 
and the "chest-mark'' (or "intestines," as the Chinese call them). It

The Museum collection also contains a curious picture executed by 
some Chinese painter, probably in the latter part of the eighteenth 
century It represents a town in Chinese Turkestan, and gives a vivid 
picture of the people of that province, their mode of living, tbei^ons 
occupations and amusements. It is 30 feet long and about 30 inches 
broad, and deserves careful and detailed study, it being replete with 
valuable ethnological data. It was purchased in Peking mlSbi.

TOO PERSEPOLITAN CASTS IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



By Cyrus Adlek. 



A private expedition was sent out from England with the assistance 
of Lord Saville, in the winter of 1891, for the purpose of securnig molds 
of the sculptures and inscriptions at Persepolis. 

Although frequently drawn, and even photographed,* it was impor- 
tant that these splendid monuments of Persian sculpture should be 
presented to the archivologist and student of art in a more worthy form. 
Some excavations were found necessary in order to uncover sculp- 
tures which were partially or wholly buried. These were made under 
the direction of Mr. Herbert Weld Blundell, whose observations are 
recorded in an interesting paper read before the ^^inth International 
Congress of Orientalists.t 

Under date of March 10, 1892, the Hon. Truxton Beale, then U. b. 
minister to Persia, in a communication to the late Hon. James a. 
Blaine, Secretary of State, announced that he had obtained permission 
from the Persian Government to remove some objects from I'ersepolis 
for the U. S. National Museum. Upon reaching Persepolis, however, 
Mr Beale saw that nothing very characteristic could be obtained with- 
out orossly defacing the ruins. The detached parts that had fallen to 
the o-round were huge drums and capitals of columns, each ot which 
weighed many tons. Their transportation across the desert and two 
ranges of mountains was therefore out of the question. 

When Mr. Beale arrived at Persepolis, he found that Mr. Bluudell 
was alreadv engaged in taking molds of the bas-reliefs and cuneiform 
inscriptions on the walls, for the British Museum. Mr. Bhmdell pre- 
sented to Mr. Beale two molds for the U. S. National Museum. These 
were shipped to Washington and there cast. These two molds were 
the first ever taken of Persepolitan inscriptions.

752 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893 

The paper molds were most carefully made and the Museum model- 
ers succeeded in securing excellent casts, as the accompanying plates 
sliow, 

A Spanish diplomat, Garcias Silva Figueroa, who was sent asambas- 
sador to Goa, a fortified Portuguese settlement on the west coast of 
India, about 250 miles from Bombay, by Philip III, had his interest 
excited by some monkish tradition and stopped on his way back at 
Peisepolis. "He was on the ground in 1618 and was the first, not only 
to put on record any descrii)tion of the ruins that even approached 
sober accuracy, but also to give an account of the strange characters 
that covered them." (Francis Brown.)* 

In view of this fact it is not without interest that the first mold 
taken at this place should have been brought back to the United 
States by an American in the diplomatic service of his country. 

Mr. Blundell's work was eminently successful. In a letter from 
London, under date of August 30, 1802, he wrote: 

Tbey (tbe moldings) have all arrived safely and they comprise nearly all the best 
known examples of the bas-reliefs at the group of palaces and halls at Persepolis 
and the figures of Cyrus at Meshed Murgbeb. 

The inscription on pi. 1 is in the language of Ancient Persia, and 
is written in the Persian cuneiform character. It was engraved at the 
command of Artaxerxes (HI) Ochus, Avho reigned 358-344 B. C, or, 
according to some, from 359-338 B. C. 

Ochus was a ruler of great vigor, and under him the Empire took a 
new lease of life. Phenicia and Cyprus, wliich had been Persian col- 
onies, rebelled, but he reduced them to submission. Egypt he recon- 
quered. The accession of Ochus to the throne was marked by his mur- 
der of three brothers; according to some, of his entire family. His 
own death was by poison at the hands of his vizier. 

The inscription is well known and has been frequently translated.! 

Most of the Achiemenian building inscriptions have the same style. 

In Persepolis there are on the north side of Artaxerxes's Palace three 
identical old Persian inscriptions. The present inscription is, however, 
that from the west staircase, t

A great god is Auramaztla, who created this earth, who created that heaven, who 
created maulvind, who gave prosperity to mankind, who made me, Artaxerxes, king, 
the sole king of multitudes, the sole ruler of multitudes.

by Herodotus, of whom 9,000 had at the end of their spears a silver 
apple, 1,000 a golden apple. He wears long drapery, sandals, and an 
upright quilted headdress; over his shoulders is slung a bow and 
quiver, and in his hands he holds upright a spear which terminates in 
a ball (probably the silver apple). This figure closely resembles the 
figures in the frieze of enameled bricks found by Dieulafoy at Susa,

I 



MUSEUM COLLECTIONS TO ILLUSTRATE RELIGIOUS HISTORY 
AND CEREMONIALS* 



Bv Cyrus Adler. 



Museum collectious perform a double function. They instruct the 
public and they furnish material for the investigator. . They render the 
reading of books more intelligible, and their writing more accurate. 
Infinitely more than the popular illustrated magazine or scientific 
monthly are they the means of communication between the average 
man and the scholar. 

The study of religious history and ceremonial institutions stands 
on a footing different from that of any other branch of knowledge. 
Political history, though in a lesser degree, suffers under similar 
disadvantages. 

The study of biology or the physical sciences is approached with 
no predisposition. Their terminology is arbitrarily given, and the 
errors of their followers are due to infirmity of the j)owers of observa- 
tion or generalization. 

The study of political history, no matter how scientific the spirit in 
which it be api^roached, is influenced by an emotion — that worthy emo- 
tion known as patriotism — for which men sacrifice life, health, and for- 
tune. An emotion even stronger is religion; its influence is second 
only to that of domestic affection, and sometimes overcomes it; its les- 
sons are the earliest instilled into the mind; none escapes its influence. 
Even with unusual precautions in the case of a human being bereft of 
most of the avenues of perception, religious teaching could not be 
excluded. t 

All modern literatures presuppose a definite belief, and the creeds 
which differ therefrom are described in terms which carry a derogatory 
implication, i: 

It is obvious, therefore, that if the public is to be taught the history

jThis sometimes occurs as a result of scientific prejudice; witness the placing of 
many religious objects under the headings of "superstition" and " cruelty '^ in the 
Museo Psychologico at Florence.

758 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

of religion or religious ceremonies, it will be most advisable to approxi- 
mate tlie methods of those braiiclies of study in which the knowledge 
is acquired for its own sake, without thought of professional use or 
partisan advantage, simply for the enlargement of the mental horizon 
of the individual and the increased mental power thereby attained. 

Modern investigation and modern teaching are based upon phe- 
nomena. Science deals with objects and phenomena; it collects them, 
describes them, and classities them. A few great men in the world 
generalize; speculation, acknowledged to be such, is out of fashion. 

This tendency of investigation to deal with phenomena has reacted 
upon all forms and grades of instruction, the higher as well as the 
popular. It has given the impulse to and shaped the growth of the 
highest modern method of popular instruction, "the most powerful and 
nseful auxiliary of all systems of teaching by object lessons"*— the 
educational museum. 

Religious history and ceremonial have been tlie very last to profit by 
the awakened impulse acquired through the museum and the general 
exhibition. 

The first museum established solely for the collection and preserva- 
tion of objects having to do with religion was the Musee Guimet, 
founded at Lyons in 1879 by M. Emile Guimet on his return from the 
mission intrusted to him by the French ministry of i)ublic instruction 
to study the religions of the extreme Orient. The collection thus 
assembled is the largest and best single collection of objects relating to 
religion ever put together. It has occasioned the publication of a series 
of volumes which form by far the most remarkable contributions yet 
produced to the scientific study of religions. 

In 1885 this museum was removed to Paris, a special building erected 
for it, and it is now included among the series of museums under Gov- 
ernment control. 

But, in spite of the splendid character of the collections and the 
great impetus they have given to scientific research, the museum has 
serious weaknesses which should not be overlooked. The general 
classification as well as the special arrangement are defective from the 
point of view of a museum of religions. 

Geograi)hical considerations have dictated the general classification, 
so that the Chinese, Japanese, and Indian Buddhism, for example, are 
shown out of relation to one another. .Esthetic considerations have 
directed the arrangement of the groups themselves. The S])ecial objects 
are in the main without labels, making the use of the i^rinted guide, 
always tiresome and distracting, an absolute necessity for the general 
visitor. So strongly has the aesthetic arrangement predominated that 
I am informed the character of the museum is to be changed, and that 
in future it will be devoted to Oriental art.

COLLECTIONS OF RELIGIOUS CEREMONIALS. 759 

The most serious fault of the museum, however, is that it fails to 
furnish au intelligent train of thought to the mind of the average vis- 
itor. The real method of popular education consists in imparting the 
unknown in terms of the known. Just as the scientific investigator 
obtains results by the comparison of facts and phenomena does the 
musenm visitor have his interest awakened by the opportunity of com- 
paring familiar objects with those brought to his knowledge for the 
first time. From the point of view of popular education it is theretore 
a capital error that the Musce Guimet has not included the Christian 
religion, as well as the IMohammedan and Jewish religions, with which 
the first named has su-ch close affiliations, in the series which it places 

on exhibition. 

Many museums contain objects which would find place in a collection 
of religions. These are usually installed in ethnological exhibits, and 
more frequently still are shown as objects of art. 

In a few museums religious art is treated as a distinct subject, and, 
being arranged chronologically, may be considered as showing the 
development of both church history and religious symbolism. The 
most important of these is the Lateran Museum at Kome. In 1843 
Pope Gregory XVI set apart the Palazzo del Laterano as a museum 
for heathen and Christian antiquities, styling it iMuseum Gregorianum 
Lateranense. The Christian Museum was founded by Pius IX. It 
contains a most valuable collection, including a series of early Christian 
inscriptions arranged by De Rossi. 

The Xational Bavarian Musenm at Munich contains a rich collection of 
Chiistian ecclesiastical art, as well as a goodly series of Jewish religious 

objects. • 4. X. 

The Arab Museum in Cairo, although not erected Irom the point ot 
view of religious, is yet to a considerable extent a collection of Moham- 
medan ecclesiastical art. Its purpose is the preservation of monuments 
of Arab art, but, as the moscpie was the chief inspirer of elegant work, 
most of its objects are directly or indirectly related to Mohammedan 

worship. 

The U. S. National lAIuseum contains Buddhist objects from India, 
Siam China, Corea, and Japan, as well as considerable collections 
from 'Polynesia— the result of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition. In 
the department of ethnology much attention has been paid to col- 
lections of objects of religious import employed by the aborigines of 
Xorth America, and special series, as, for instance, mortuary customs 
have been for some time on exhibition. 

As a result of the travels of Hon. W. W. RockhiU in Tibet, the 
National Museum secured a rich and unique collection of the religious 
objects of the Buddhists of that little known country. 

In 1889 a collection of objects illustrating Jewish rebgious cere- 
monials was placed on exhibition, and in his report for that year Dr. 
Goode announced the purpose of the Museum to form a collection which 
would illustrate the comparative history of religion. 



760 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Having" found a lilace in the museum, it was but proper that the 
subject of religion should be assigned space in the great exhibitions 
and that in the natural course of events special exhibits of religious 
objects should be inade. These exhibits are quite distinct from the 
church exhibits — either from the point of view of propaganda or 
philanthropy — which have usually been included in exhibition classifi- 
cations. 

A special religious exhibition of considerable importance was the 
Esposizioue Yaticana, held to commemorate the jubilee of Pope Leo 
XIII, from December, 1887, to May, 1888. It took place in the Basilica 
di San Pietro e Palazzi Vaticani and its story is told in a serial publi- 
cation, L' Esposizioue Yaticana Illustrata Giornale TJfficiale per la Com- 
sione Promotrice, as well as in a valuable catalogue.* 

While not exclusively religious, the exhibition was in the main an 
exhibit of ceremonial objects of the Eoman Catholic religion, although 
costumes of other religious functionaries were admitted. 

In the same year there was held in London, in honor of the Queen's 
jubilee, the Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition, in which the richest 
collection of Jewish ceremonial objects ever gotten together was placed 
on exhibition. t 

At the Paris Exposition of 1889 the Society of Anthropology of Paris 
included a history of religions in its classification, Avith the subdivisions 
of amulets and divinities. Amulets, however, Avere given most attention. 

In April, 1802, a loan collection of objects used in religious ceremonies 
and charms and implements for divination was held at Philadelphia 
under the auspices of the department of archoeoiogy and paleontology 
of the University of Pennsylvania. 

A useful catalogue of this collection (edited by Mr. Stewart Culin) was' 
published. The classification followed that of the Musee Guimet, and, 
was geographical in the main, though not strictly so. I A decided 
improvement on the Musee Guimet plan was the admission of one great 
Semitic religion, Mohammedanism. 

In the Columbian Historical Exhibition at Madrid (1802), 7,000 square 
meters were devoted to a splendid exhibit of Christian ecclesiastical art, 
arranged by cathedrals. 

The Chicago Exposition has made considerable advance on its prede- 
cessors in this regard. Two exhibits of religions are to be found here, 
one in the Ethnological building and one in the United States Govern- 
ment building. On the Midway Plaisauce there is a mosque in charge 
of an Imam, officially appointed by the Sultan of Turkey, in his capacity 
of Caliph, i. e., successor, or rather substitute, of Mohammed, the title 
of the head of the Mohammedan Church. 

A i^arliament of religions has been called which, while conducted 
on church lines, and almost exclusively from the propagandist or

philanthropic point of view, yet possesses a certain interest, in that it 
enables the i)resentation of many creeds by their own professors. 

Of the exhibits I shall not speak in detail, as the congress has set 
apart a special day for visiting them, yet I may be pardoned for making 
a few general statements covering the exhibit in the Smithsonian sec- 
tion.* Some time before the plans for the National Museum exhibit 
were under way, the purpose of forming a section devoted to compara- 
tive religion luul been deiinitely announced. It was accordingly decided 
to prepare a type exhibit for the World's Fair. This exhibit suffered 
under limitations as to space and time for preparation. It was further 
decided to limit the religions shown to a selection of the nations inhab- 
iting the Mediterranean basin. This selection had a conscious signifi- 
cance already referred to in the discussion of the Musee Guimfet, which 
is of considerable practical value for the advance of the study of religions 
in America. The Mediterranean basin has been the seat of the civili- 
zations of the modern western world. Tlie art, philosophy, and religion 
of Europe and America arose among the ancients of that region, and 
the highest ideals even of the moderns are still to be found in the 
books and the works of art of those ancient peoples. In an attempt, 
therefore, to introduce the study of religions into universities, or to 
create departments of religious ceremonial in museums, it behooves us 
for the nonce to put aside the American Indian, and the Central Afri- 
can, and to begin at least with those religions whose history has an 
interest for all men of our day, the knowledge of which should really 
become a part of general culture. 

The exhibits comprised the following religions: Assyro-Babylonian, 
Jewish, Oriental Christian, Mohammedan, Greek, and Roman. 

It is expected that in the coming year a collection of religious history 
and ceremonial institutions will be installed in the National Museum. 
For the present, museum economy will render it necessary that objects 
relating to the religion of the aborigines of North America be retained 
in the general ethnological exhibits, though they will be carefully 
differentiated. 

With that exception the museum collections already referred to, those 
on exhibition at the Exposition, and some recently acquired, Avill be 
labeled and installed as soon as practicable. So fully is the imjiortance 
of this subject recognized that, in spite of the great pressure for floor 
space at the Museum, adequate room will be provided, although it will 
require the retiring of some interesting collections. 

Eeligion consists in what men believe concerning the supernatural, 
and what they do in consequence of that belief, in creed and cult. 

It is the cult which most readily lends itself to museum exhibition, 
and this will be taken up first, although there are devices by which 
even creeds may be shown in museum collections. 

" See Appendix 4. 



762 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

The objects will be exliibiced in religious groups and not in any geo- 
graphical relation, except in so far as the worship has actually been 
affected by geographical considerations. 

The cult objects will be arranged under certain well recognized heads. 

There is usually a public worship in which the sacerdotal and lay 
classes have definite functions; there are places of worship with fur 
niture and appointments, symbols about them and shrines within them; 
there is the sacerdotal person, his costume and the implements he 
employs; the sacred writings, the filtar or its equivalent; the special 
public religious occasions, such as feasts; the public religious cere- 
monies on si)ecial occasions that affect the community, as wars, tri- 
umphs, distress, famine, and drought. 

The relation of the individual to the cult will come next in order- 
marriage, birth and death, in some cases, bethrothal; ceremonies at 
certain ages, more especially of the attainment of puberty; the rela- 
tion of religion to the organized community, state religious observ- 
ances; finally the secret religious practices, among which charms and 
divination would i)robably fall. 

Such collections once made for the individual religious, certain groups 
of ceremonies will be taken up in the hope that a comparison of the 
underlying ideas may form a fruitful subject of study.* 

A double purpose would be served, for instance, by an exhibit of 
sacred books, which would furnish an opportunity for the classification 
of the book religions. This may be followed by a collection to illus- 
trate the altar and sacred inclosure. Another subject that would lend 
itself to such a comparative collection would be votive offerings. Still 
another would be music and musical instruments. Mortuary and 
marriage customs and many other subjects will readily suggest them- 
selves. 

1 can not do better than quote a sentence from the suggestive article 
of Prof. Jastrow t as expressing the aspirations of the National Museum 
in this connection : 

With the admirable facilities possessed by a goveriiiiieiit institution [he says], for 
obtaining objects from all part.s of the world, the scope of this section ought at an 
early day be made coequal with the universe. 

The study of religions is one by no means narrow, but full of signifi- 
cance for the historian and anthropologist. The greatest movements in 
political history have either been occasioned by or resulted in religious 
movements ; and these are not infrequently stereotyped in some religious 
ceremony. 

]t is no exaggeration to say that the history of the Koman Church, 

How eiiectively this may be done as a matter of iuvcstigntion has already been 
shown by the study of sacrifice among the Semites by the late Prof. W. Robertson 
Smith in his work. The Semitic Religions: Fundamental Institutions, the most 
notable contribution to the study of Semitic religious which haa ever been made. 
tBiblical World, January, 1893, pp. 24-32.

as well as the history of tlie cliiircli symbolism, might be studied in a 
collection of Papal medals: yet, so far as I am aware, no attempt has 
ever been made to form such a collection. 

As Dr. Brinton has pointed out, religion has had much to do with the 
growth of the arts and forms of government.* 

A subiect of such wide import and so great general interest ought 
rapidly be admitted to our museums, find a place in the curriculum of 
our universities, and gain an entrance to all the avenues of public 
instruction.t

Museum of Comparative Religions, and at least two college presidents are urging 
the establishment of similar collections.

766 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 



Appendix IY. 

The following account of tbe exhibit appeared in the Xew York 
P^vening Post, September 9, 1894: 

To stmlents of religious ceremonial an exhibit made by tbe Smitbsouiau lustitution 
in the Government Build iu.i» will jirove of absorbing interest. Placed iu a small 
room on the south side of the building, it might escape notice by casual observers; 
but while not extensive, being only tbe nucleus of acollection recently commenced, 
it comprehends a rather large quantity of objects used in the Jewish, Greek, Moham- 
medan, and Assyro-Baby-lonian religions, and a great many copies of ancient statues 
and bas-reliefs representing characters and scenes from the Roman and Greek mythol- 
ogy. For comparative study it oft'ers.an opportunity truly rare, as it is the only col- 
lection of the kind in the world except that of the Royal Museum at Berlin. 

In the first two cases are articles, ancient and modern, used by the Jews iu the 
religious observances of the synagogue and household. Among these are scrolls of 
the law or Torah wrapped in embroidered velvet cloth with silver-worked belt and 
silver bells on the rollers; also a manuscript copy of the Book of Esther, inserted iu 
a revolving silver case, with illuminations illustrating the chief eveuts narrated in 
the book. The Book of Esther, generally called Megillath Esther (roll of Esther), 
is read iu the synagogue in the feast of Purim on the 15th of Adar (March-April), 
which was established to commemorate the deliverance of the Jews from the machi- 
nations of Haman. It is one of the five rolls read on various occasions in the syna- 
gogue, the others being the Song of Solomon, Ruth, Ecclesiastes, and Lamentations. 
There are several objects connected with the Passover meal or seder. Among these 
are brass and pewter plates for holding the green herbs, and twelve wine glasses 
with engravings upon them representing human life. During the seder, each person 
is supposed to drink of four cups of wine, and the glasses are refilled at stated parts 
of the service, one cup being set apart for the prophet Elijah, the expected herald of 
the Messiah. 

Of especial interest is a delicately Avrought silver spice box, supposed to have been 
manufactured in Wiirtemberg about 1740. This box, filled with spice, is usedinthe 
.Tewish service known as Habdalah (or separation), the service of the conclusion of 
the Sabbath. There is a tradition that at the beginning of the Sabbath a special 
angel accompanies the Avorshiper from the synagogue and remains with him until 
the holy day is ended. The departure of the angel leaves the man fiiint, and the 
spices are intended to restore him. The objects used in this service are a cup of 
Avine, the spice box, and a candle. A blessing is first said over the wine, then over 
spices, and lastly over the light, the candle being then extinguished by having wine 
poured upon it. 

A Jewish marriage contract is exhibited, dated at Rome in the year of creation 
5576 (1816). In the kethubah or marriage contract the obligations of the husband 
to love, honor, and provide becomingly for his wife are set forth, and also the amount 
of dowry allowed to the bride. The minimum of the dowry is fixed by the law at 
200 shekels (about $50) for a virgin and 100 shekels for a widower divorced woman. 
To this is usually added what the bride has received from her parents and what the 
husband settles A^oluntarily, all of which she gets in case of the death of her hus- 
band or of divorce. The established form of the kethubah usually commences 
" Under good auspices and with good luck to bridegroom and bride, whoso findeth 
a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favor of tlie Lord.'' The contract exhib- 
ited is decorated around the margin with symbolical figures, and contains the liturgy 
of the wedding ceremony and passages from the Bilde and the Talmud The .Jewish 
marriage is made valid by the bridegroom's putting a ring on the hand of the bride 
while saying the words, "Behold thou art wedded to me according to the law of 
Moses and Israel." These are the only words uttered by either bride or groom. 



COLLECTIONS OF RELIGIOUS CEREMONIALS. 767 

Ne-.itto the contract a wedding ring of odd design in gold is shown. Against the 
back of the first case is a veil of the Holy Ark, made in Padua, Italy, in 1736, of yellow 
silk, richly embroidered in silver, gold, and silk, with the beginning of the ten com- 
mandments IjeantifiiUy worked in gold. In the Holy Ark are kept the scrolls of the 
law or the Pentateuch, written on parchment, for use in the services of the syna- 
gogue. The Holy Ark, being the most important object in the synagogue, is richly 
adorned, and whenever opened the congregation rises in reverence, for it contains 
the Law of God. There is also another veil of blue silk elaborately decorated in gold. 
In the same case are two interesting tapestries in green and white, supposed to 
have been made in England in the thirteenth century. One represents the story of 
David and Bathsheba and the other that of Uavid and Goliath. A kuilb and cup 
used in the rite of circumcision are exhibited, and a number of amulets, or charms, 
such as are still used and prized among the Eastern .Jews; cushions, heavily embroi- 
dered in silver, used at the Passover meal ; prayer books in Dutch and Spanish, printed 
at Amsterdam early in the eighteenth century, and a Jewish horn, or shofar, usually 
made from a ram's horn and employed in the ceremonial on various solemn occa- 
sions—notably New Year's Day, the first of the month of Tishri (September- Octo- 
ber), and Atonement Day, 10th of Tishri. The long peculiar knife used for the 
slaughter of animals is also seen. The killing of animals for food is performed by a 
person especially trained and authorized. After the throat is cut the internal organs 
are examined for traces of disease, and during each act short prayers are recited. 
If there be a notch in the knife or trace of disease found, the animal is (terefa) unfit 
to be eaten. 

Lamps used at the feast of Hanuka are another evidence of the elaborate cere- 
monial of the Jewish religion. The lamps, eight in number, joined, are of ancient 
Roman design. This feast is held in remembrauce of the rededicatiou of the temple 
after its defilement by Antiochus Epipbaues, 169 B. C. Josephus records that it 
was a feast of lights. The celebration lasted throughout eight days, on the first 
night one light being lit, on the second two lights, etc. Examples of phylacteries, 
or tefillin, are also shown as used by the Jews at morning prayers, except on Satur- 
days. These objects are employed in the Jewish ritual in pursuance of the com- 
mand that the word of God should be "a sign upon thy hand and for frontlets 
between thy eyes." They consist of parchment cases containing the passages Deu- 
teronomy vi, 4-0, and xi, 13-21, written on slips of parchment attached to leather 
straps for binding on the forehead aud left arm. 

Next to the Jewisli articles comes a case containing a variety of articles explana- 
tory of tlie form of worship in the Greek Church, of which the Czars of all the 
Ku'ssias have since Peter the Great been the head. The full title of the Greek Church 
is the Holy Oriental Orthodox Catholic Ai)ostolic Church. The title Holy Catholic 
Apostolic, derived from the Nicene Creed, is also claimed by the Roman Church in 
an exclusive sense. The numerical strength of the Greek Church is estimated at 
about 80,000,000, being less than half as large as the Roman Catholic membership. 
The doctrine of the Greek Church is substantially like the Romau, though the gov- 
ernment is a patriarchal oligarchy, while the Roman is a papal monarchy. Perhaps 
the most valuable relic in this collection is a Russian icon set in a gold frame studded 
with pearls and precious stones. The lids are decorated with scenes from the lives 
of Christ and Mary. The emeralds, ruby spinels, and garnets are all genuine and 
very old, dating probably from the eleventh or twelfth century, if not earlier, as they 
are all drilled and were evidently used for some other purpose before they were set 
m the icon. This piece was bought at Nizhni Novgorod for Tiffany & Co. in 1891, 
and IS said to be the finest icon in the United States. There are also several other 
icons, one very interesting one showing painted figures of Cosmos and Damianus, 
the two brothers who died as martyrs in the persecutions organized by the i:mperor 
Diocletian between 303 and 311 A. D. A curious object is a gilded bronze crown 
which atone time decorated an image in the demolished church of St. Anna, the 
former nunnery in the old Post street of Prague. 



768 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

At the back of the cabinet is an eighteenth century ooTcr for a coffin, and an altar 
cloth of the same period, of brocaded silk. On either side are richly embroidered 
vestments of the last century, done in white and gold upon a purple background; 
there are also vestments, such as are worn in the Russian churches to-day. Gongs, 
scepters, and many other objects explain the ceremonial of the Greek Church. 

The Mohammedan forms of worship next claim attention. Prominently displayed 
in the adjoining cabinet is a Koran stand and a Koran open upon it. The stand is 
inlaid with mother-of-pearl and tortoise shell; inscribed upon its face is the usual 
invocation, "In the name of God," and at the top edge, the date, A. H. 1210. The 
Mohammedans treat the Koran with at least great outward veneration. It is always 
placed upon a high and clean place, and never held or broui>ht in contact with other 
books or objects. Its reading is preceded by legal ablution and the usual prayer, 
"I seek protection with God against Satan, the accursed," after which follows the 
invocation, " In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate." In the services 
of the mosque the prayer and invocation are chanted by the imam or leader in prayer. 
The Koran upon the stand is in a richly illuminated text and binding. Under the 
Koran stand is displayed the costume of a Persian priest, consisting of vest, inner 
and outer coat, girdle, stockings, green morocco shoes, etc., also the costume of a danc- 
ing dervish. The different orders of dervishes are distinguished by their dress, 
chiefly the cap (taj),the most common being made of felt in the shape of a cone. By 
these is a dervish drum used at festivals by the p]gyptian dervishes, and also employed 
by the criers who go abotit the streets at night during Ramadan reciting prayers. 
The instrument, of a kettledrum order, is held in the left hand and beaten with a 
small leather strap. 

There is no sacerdotal class in the Mohammedan religion, but each mosque has 
its imam, jiroperly "leader," who reads the Koran and leads in i)rayer in public serv- 
ice. In the larger mosques there are usually two imams, one whose duty it is to 
lead the prayers and preach the sermon on Friday, the Mohammedan Sunday, and 
the other who recites the five daily prayers in the mosque. In most of the smaller 
mosques the ofiSces are performed by the same jierson; each mosque has also one or 
more muezzins who call the faithful to prayer from the minaret. 

In the back of the case are hung many silver cases for charms against evil spirits, 
witchcraft, or disease, a belief in the etticacy of these charms being very general 
throughout the East. For this purpose a small copy of the whole or certain portions 
of the Koran is usually employed. This cabinet contains miniature Korans, silver 
Koran cases, and a quantity of other accessories to the Mohammedan ceremonial. 

Another case is devoted to the Assyro-Babylonian religion, and contains several 
bas-reliefs and many seal cylinders in cast. A sacrificial dish, the original of which 
is m the Royal Museum of Berlin, is adorned on the four corners with the head of a 
bull, an animal much .venerated by the Assyro-Babylonians, and engraved upon the 
sides are various symbols and figures. One monument represents Shamash, the 
God of the Sun, by his symbol, the sun disc. Another shoAvs the head of a priest 
in bas-relief. According to Diodorus Siculus, the Assyro-Babylonian priests were 
divided into three grades, the temple priests, who made sacrifices and performed 
the purification, the expiatoi'y priests, who by conjurations and penitential exer- 
cises kept off or-exoi'cised the evil spirits, and the augurs, who explained portents, 
interi»reted dreams, and divined from the flight of birds. In the back of the case 
are bas-reliefs representing eagle-headed and winged divinities, and also divinities 
holding in the hands baskets and live cones. Beyond the Assyro-Babjlonian case 
are others-devoted to Roman and Grecian mythology. These contain the busts and 
full lengths of the deities familiar to all, but they become especially interesting in 
this connection. Altogether the collection is veiy unique and deserving of careful 
study.

IF PUBLIC LIBRARIES, WHY NOT PUBLIC MUSEUMS? 



Bv Edward S. Morse. 



The success which has accompanied the public library act in Massa- 
chusetts encourages the friends of science to believe that the time is 
propitious for establishing public museums in the smaller towns of the 
Commonwealth. It certainly is time to direct public attention to the 
importance of the museum as an adjunct to the public library. The 
tendencies of modern public-school education which introduce Sloyd as 
part of its work, and ask for pictures and casts to decorate the barren 
schoolroom, are indications that the time is ripe to found, in a modest 
way, museums of science, art, and history in our smaller towns and 
villages. 

A few devoted students have in past times endeavored to establish 
institutions of this kind, but in most instances their efltbrts have been 
abortive. A few larger cities in the country have managed to keep 
alive the interest manifested, and their museums are now permanently 
established. The failures, however, have outnumbered the successes 
ten to one, and for this there must be a reason. 

The founding of a museum is far more difticult than that of a library. 
People are trained to the latter in the development of a private library; 
and one capable of cataloguing books can establish a small library. 
The furniture is reduced to the simplest expression in the form of a case 
of shelves. The material to be put upon them can readily be ordered 
from the nearest book mart. On the other hand, the building of a 
museum requires special gifts and special training. Besides, one 
thoroughly imbued with the spirit of a collector should have charge of 
a museum, though this is equally true in regard to libraries of any 
magnitude. The absence of a public demand for museums in the past 
has arisen from the methods of public instruction. Lessons from books, 
and not from nature, have been the tiresome lot of school children. 
Questions and answers, cut and dried, have tended to deaden the 
inquiring spirit. That portion of a child's brain which is involved in

771 



772 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

observation lias beeu reduced to atrophy by the usual public-school 
methods. A distinguished English authority suggests to school boards, 
high and Ioaa', "that the teaching is out of all proportion in excess of 
the training, the latter being with difficulty weighed in the scales of 
school examination." Agassiz said: "The pupil studies nature in the 
schoolroom, and when he goes out of doors he can not find her/' I 
shall never forget the bitter disappointment 1 felt as a boy, on my first 
journey, when the stage driver pointed out to me with his whip the 
dividing line between the States of Maine and New Hampshire. There 
was no colored line! There was no change in the color surfaces of the 
two sides! I felt grieved and rebellious at the imposition which had 
been practiced upon me. Nor can I ever forget the surprise — my delight 
was distracted by the novelty of my ignorance — when my father, in one 
of the i^eriodic family drives, chanced to remark, on a shore road near 
Portland, that the water expanse before us was the Atlantic Ocean, Had 
he said that one of the islands in sight was Madagascar, I should not have 
been more astonished. Every one can recall experiences of a similar 
nature, and I venture to believe that these two truthful incidents are 
l)ertinent examples of the results of pernicious educational methods 
universal forty years ago and by no means uncommon to-day — book- 
cramming, with no reference to the objects or illustrations in sight from 
the windows, or within stone's throw of the school door. This unde- 
niable condition of many schools in the land emphasizes the necessity 
of museums where the objects may verify some of the lessous learned 
at school. The book method of education has almost paralyzed ijublic 
desire for museums, and the result has been that the museum, when 
instituted, has been in the interest of specialists, and mainly through 
their efforts. The whole animal kingdom may be epitomized, in a man- 
ner, between the covers of a single book; the specimens properly to 
illustrate such a book would require a good-sized hall in which to be 
displayed. 

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has liberally provided a way 
in which every town may have a collection of books free to all. So 
successfully has the enactment been carried out that only 3 per cent of 
the State's population is unprovided with a free public library, and 
this remnant will soon be favored with its public stock of standard 
books. This is all very well, and in the right direction ; but is it not 
possible to create a similar public sentiment for the establishment of 
some kind of a museum as a proper accompaniment of the library? 
If there is the slightest necessity for a museum in the crowded metrop- 
olis, why does not the same necessity hold good for the small town or 
village? In the Public Libraries Act of England and Ireland (1855), 
provision is made for the erection of buildings " suitable for public 
libraries or museums, or both, or for schools of science and art; " and 
a similar act for Scotland (1867) provides for the erection of buildings 
" suitable for public libraries, art galleries, or museums, or each, respec- 
tively." Every community, borough, district, or parish exceeding five

thousand iu population may, by a two-tbirds majority, adopt the Pub- 
lic Libraries Act, and a sum not exceeding a penny in a pound may be 
levied for carrying out the provisions of the act. 

Thomas Greenwood, the author of a special work on museums and 
art galleries, expresses his belief that ''the museum of the future must 
stand side by side with the library and the laboratory, as a part of the 
teaching equipment of the college and the university, and in the great 
cities cooperate with the public library as one of the principal agencies 
for the enlightenment of the people." 

Prof. Goode, the officer in charge of the U. S. National Museum, says: 

I am confident, also, that a museum, wisely organized and properly arranged, is 
certain to beuetit the library near which it stands in many ways through its 
power to stimulate interest iu books, thus increasing the general popularity of the 
library and enlarging its endowment. 

England discovered that art schools were not sufficient to i^lace her 
art manufactures on a level with those of her continental competitors, 
and was forced to supplement her schools with museums of art handi- 
work, and the large endowment granted the South Kensington Museum 
was fully justified by the results shown in the great exhibition of 1867. 
A museum seems as much an integral part of the public library as are 
the experiments part of a lecture on chemistry or physics. If the 
public library is established primarily for educational purposes, surely 
the public museum should come in the same category. The potency 
of an object in conveying information beyond all pages of description 
is seen in the fact that in the museum a simple label associated with a 
veritable object is often sufficient to tell the story at a glance; the eye 
seizes the essentials at once. 

The rapid development of the modern arts of illustration, and the 
conspicuous use of these methods in books, magazines, dictionaries, 
and even the daily papers, attest the power of the pictorial art, bar- 
barous as it is in many cases, in imparting information (quickly and 
clearly. If illustrations are so imj)ortant in the modern publication — 
and to do without them would seem well-nigh impossible — how far 
more important it would seem to be to provide an exhibition of the 
objects themselves in science, art, and history, to which the public 
might have free access. 

A museum adds dignity to a trifle. What seems a worthless object 
to the minds of the multitude becomes at once endowed with interest 
when carefully framed or mounted, and clearly labeled. Furthermore, 
the object is seen to have a definite relation to other equally common 
objects with which it is associated; a lesson is learned, and sooner or 
later the observer finds an added interest in his studies, if indeed he is 
not aware for the first time of regions of thought utterly unknown to 
him before. The charm that attends the demonstration of the minor 
factors of natural selection comes from the love of causality, a desire 
which, as Peschel truly says, accounts for the intellectual supremacy 
of Europe over the great Asiatic nations lying east of her. 



774 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

Charles Kingsley, in an address to workiugmen, said: 

You must acciuiie something of that industrious habit of mind which the study 
of natural science gives— the art of comparing, of perceiving true likenesses and true 
differences, and so of classifying and arranging what you see— the art of connecting 
facts together in your mind in cause and eft'ect. 

The public museum fosters the art of collecting; and of all habits to 
encourage, in the young and old alike, the habit of collecting is one of 
the best. It has been said that one who does not learn to play whist 
is laying up a dismal old age; the same might be said of one who has 
not cultivated the collector's spirit. It induces habits of neatness, 
order, and skill, says one writer. Young- people are kept out of mis- 
chief; to middle-aged people it is a rest and relaxation, and old people 
find in their collections a perennial source of pleasure. 

Prof. Groode quotes an eminent English lecturer as stating that our 
nation is deteriorating in regard to culture; that where, twenty years 
ago, five hundred towns supported, year after year, courses of lectures 
on scientific and literary subjects, to-day scarcely fifty of these places 
feel encouraged to continue the effort. If there is no apparent reason 
for this decadence, then it will be well-nigh useless to hope for the 
establishment of museums. If, however, it can be shown that with the 
advent of the lecture bureau the market was flooded with poor or sen- 
sational lecturers, comic readers, etc., and as a result the lecture plat- 
form, as we formerly knew it, became converted into an amusement 
stage; if, furthermore, it can be shown that the magazine literature of 
the country gives far greater space to matters of science and art, thus 
providing the kinds of intellectual food formerly given from the lecture 
platform, then we may hope that there is no decadence in the culture 
of the people, and that an interest in ijublic museums may be easily 
aroused. 

A change has certainly taken place in the last thirty years in the 
tendency of the community toward collecting objects of natural history. 
Private collectors of shells, insects, birds, etc., were far more numerous 
thirty years ago than they are today. The same is true of England. 
An eminent authority laments that " private collections are failing in 
Liverpool and all around ; and teaching is everywhere hard and harden- 
ing in its results." Yet there is surely no dying out of the collector's 
spirit in certain lines, as witness the thousands interested in postage- 
stamp collecting, with their established societies and periodicals. 

To awaken a desire in the smaller towns for a i)ublic museum, it is 
needful that a good example be cited. To see examples of any kind, 
one must go up to the great cities to find them. For Kew England the 
fingers of one hand could almost count them, and for the rest of this 
great Republic, outside of college museums, the fingers of the other 
hand would be sufflcient to keep tally. 

If we examine into the character of these museums, we shall find 
that, with some notable exceptions, they stand where they did before

Darwin's time. The museum then, as now, consisted of aecumahitions 
of species of animals that were of interest only to speciaUsts in their 
respective branches of study. The interest attaching to such collec- 
tions was incomprehensible to the layman. He strayed through a 
museum bewildered by cases tilled with apparently simdar kmds ot 
shells insects, and the like. The insects were always in their mature 
state.' Not a suggestion of the life history of even a single species 
could be found. Regiments of shells were marshaled in pasteboard 
trays, with no inkling of the kind of life associated with them. The 
collection of birds gave no hint of the quaint appearance of the young, 
or of the infinite variety in the construction of their nests. As to 
whether the creatures ever laid eggs could be ascertained only by going 
to some other part of the hall. The schoolbooks of the time gave no 
idea of the way in which these collections might be studied; and if by 
chance the text-book had a more thoughtful chapter on morphology or 
other point of view, the museum might be ransacked in vain for an 
illustration. If one chanced to have a general book on natural history, 
it told him about the elephant and the kangaroo, which he already 
knew by name, at least, through the lines of a popular ditty, bnt not a 
word of the Uttle creatures that hid under his own doorstep. The 
museum might have a small collection of mammals, but to find a com- 
plete collection of those of his own State he would have to go to the 
museums of the Old World. 

Within recent years a great change has taken place, in this and some 
other respects, in the large museums of the country, notably in Boston, 
Cambridge, Salem, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington; but 
advances are yet to be made in some of these museums to bring their 
collections abreast of the knowledge of to-day. Prof. Goode insists 
that the "museum of the past must be set aside, reconstructed, trans- 
formed from a cemetery of bric-a-brac into a nursery of living thoughts." 
That the importance of a museum of some kind connected with the 
larger schools has been realized in the past is seen in the custom of 
every country academy and female seminary which sets apart a room 
for the purposes of a school museum. But no more ingenious device 
could have been planned to create a loathing for museums in the minds 
of the young than those wretched travesties called "cabinets of natural 
history." With few exceptions they were dismal failures. The scant 
collections rarely contained anything belonging to the surrounding 
country, unless it might be a moth-eaten owl, a plethoric paper wasps' 
nest, or a horseshoe crab from the nearest seacoast; clutter, dust, and 
disorder, and poorly executed labels, usually written with a hard lead 
pencil on the bluest of writing paper, ajul all concealed in cases, the 
wood of whose doors generally exceeded the glass in superficial area. 
This description applies not ouly to the class of schools above men- 
tioned, but to many of the large institutions of learning as well. Even 
to-day there are many colleges and universities that have no museums, 



776 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

and others that would be better otit" if deprived of the wretched apolo- 
gies they have. A proiuiueiit Western university has a museum liter- 
ally bathed in soot, the most instructive features of which are the foot- 
tracks of various insects delicately traced on the soot-laden shelves. 
I mention these facts not in a way of reproach, but to emphasize an 
important truth, and that is that the creating of a proper museum 
requires the services of one endowed with special taste and talent for 
the work. A man may be an excellent collector and systematist, but 
disorderly to the last degree. As a collector and specialist he may 
have made a record; but museum work demands more than these 
qualifications. One must have the power of clearly illustrating truths 
in science by the proper and adequate display of specimens. Labels 
must be neatly, clearly, and concisely drawn. A hand-made label, if 
well done, is better than a printed one. Prof. Goode, to whom we are 
greatly indebted for numerous essays and addresses on museum mat- 
ters, has said with truth that " an efficient educational mnseum may 
he (lescrihed as a collectioti of instructive labels, each illustrated hy a well- 
selected specimen.'''' 

But we anticipate. The importance of the museum as an adjunct of 
the public library having been indicated, the pre-Darwinian condition 
of many of the smaller and some of the larger museums having been 
shown, we come now to consider the question, What kind of a museum 
may i^roperly be denumded as the working companion of a public 
library? Museums are almost as varied in their character as human 
knowledge. There are zoological, anatomical, botanical, mineralogical, 
geological, paleontological, ethnological, archaM^logical museums; his- 
torical museums of art and armor; museums of architecture, terres- 
trial and marine; industrial museums; museums showing the history 
of a nation, such as the wonderful one at Nuremberg; museums solely 
to commemorate the work of great men, as the Thorwaldsen Museum 
at Copenhagen; museums, again, limited in scope to the last degree, as 
seen in the unique one at Berlin, illustrating the history and develop- 
ment of the postal service. Obviously, not one of these various muse- 
ums would answer to parallel the i)ublic library; but an epitome of all 
of them would answer the purpose comj^letely, were it possible to bring 
the material together. And such an epitome is within the reach of any 
well-ordered community willing to spend a portion of its library 
endowment for such a collection. 

Thomas Greenwood, of England, in his work already alluded to, 
summarizes the main objects of a public museum as follows : First, that 
it provide rational amusement of an elevating character to the ordinary 
visitor; second, that it be in the fullest sense an educational institu- 
tion, easily accessible to all classes; third, that it provide a home for 
examples of local objects of interest of an antiquarian, geological, or 
other character; fourth, that a section of it be a commercial museum, 
containing specimens of manufactures resembling those produced in the 



IF PUBLIC LIBRARIES, WHY NOT PUBLIC MUSEUMS? 777 

immediate locality ; tiftli, that it be oue in a series of institutions whose 
object shall be to further the education of the many and the special 
studies of the few. The section that Mr. Greenwood devotes to a com- 
mercial museum would be far better devoted to objects of art. The 
commercial products of a community are always accessible, and every 
recurring State or county fair makes full display of the material, with 
the machinery and men pro<lucing it in full operation. 

In a committee's report, made to the British Association for the 
Advancement of Science, upon the provincial museums of the United 
Kingdom, it is stated: 

The specialobjectsof afree r.ite-siipported museum in a provincial town should be— 

(1) To contribute its share to the general scientific statistics of the country by 
collecting and preserving specimens of the natural and artificial productions of the 
district in which it is situated. 

(2) To procure such other specimens as may be desirable for illustrating the gen- 
eral principles of science, and the relations of the locality to the rest of the world. 

(3) To receive and preserve local collections or single specimens, having any scien- 
tific value, which the possessors may desire to devote to public use. 

(4) So to arrange and display the specimens collected as to afford the greatest 
amount of popular instrnctiou consistent with their safe preservation and accessi- 
bility as objects of scientific study. 

(5) To render special assistance to local students and teachers of science. 

r. T. Mott, esq., a member of the above-mentioned committee, in a 
paper read before the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society, on 
the "development of museums as public educators," says: 

Museums, free libraries, and art galleries have this in conunou : that they are each 
expected to fulfill two purposes which are somewhat iucongruous, and require to be 
pursued by different methods and with difierent appliauces. Each of these institu- 
tions is expected to minister to the wants both of trained students and of the 
untrained and ignorant public; and the demands of these two classes of persons are 
so diverse that they must be provided for separately. The free library must have 
its lending department for the general public, and its reference department for stu- 
dents. The art gallery must have attractive and interesting pictures for ordinary 
visitors, but it must also have masterly studies for the instruction of young artists. 
The museum, however, has a still more complex and difflcult part to play. It has 
not only to provide for the diverse wants of students and of visitors, but it has also 
to contribute to the general progress of scientific knowledge. Every museum, at 
least every provincial rate-supported museum, which is a public and in some sense 
a national institution, has a threeftdd duty: (1) to the nation at large, (2) to the 
stiTdents of the neighborhood, and (3) to the local public. If museums are ever to 
be more than a confused compound of the curiosity shop and the peep show, which 
is what very many of them are at present, this threefold duty must be very clearly 
recognized, and means must be found for the efficient carrying on of each department. 

First and foremost, then, the town museum should illustrate the 
natural products of the immediate region. By natural products is 
meant, of course, the animals, plants, rocks, and minerals found in the 
county, or possibly in the State, for a county collection would require 
but a few extra-limital forms to compass the State; second, a general 
collection of similar material from elsesvhere, to show the relation of 
the country to the rest of the world. Anatomical, physiological, and 



778 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

morphological series should next find place in such a museum. The 
minor factors of natural selection, such as protective, alluring, and 
warning coloration, mimicry, etc., should be illustrated, as far as possi- 
ble, from collections made in the immediate neighborhood. And finally, 
a series of forms to show the phyllogenetic development of the animal 
kingdom should in some way be given. Such a series would require 
large floor space, and the solution of many perplexing problems as to 
form of cases and methods of display. Yet a scheme of this sort must 
ultimately be devised. The importance of developmental series is 
clearly brought out by a comiDarison between the famous Cluny Museum 
in Paris and the University Museum at Oxford under the charge of Prof. 
E. B. Tylor. In the former is a homogeneous mass of beautiful and 
elaborate objects of mediaeval times, each exciting thought so disjointed 
that fatigue soon ensues from the rich surfeit, and one comes away with 
the feeling that he has seen a marvelous lot of most exquisite objects 
in the dim light of an artistic receptacle. Not an emotion has been 
evoked that will be set vibrating again unless he drops into a choice 
bric-a-brac shop, and the medley there seen pleases him less in its 
ensemble than that of the Cluny collections; with the advantage, how- 
ever, that he can buy, if he has the means, and not burn with envy. 
The Pitt-Eivers collection now displayed in the Oxford Museum arrests 
the thoughtful attention at every step; inquiry is provoked at every 
turn ; doubt may be engendered, yet ever after one finds fertile subjects 
to think about, to discuss, or to impart to one's friends. In other words, 
the collection has stimulated inquiry; and this is what a properly 
arranged collection should always do. 

This, then, is a general idea of what a public museum should be. It 
has been attained in part by the Peabody Academy of Science in 
Salem. The collections comprise, first, a remarkable series of the ani- 
mals and plants, rocks, minerals, and archaeological si^ecimens collected 
in the county of Essex. These collections are continually increasing as 
new forms are added. They occui^y upright cases to an extent of over 
three hundred running feet, or a superficial area for their display of 
nearly three thousand square feet. Besides this there is an epitome 
collection of the animal kingdom, brought from all parts of the world, 
requiring an area of sixteen hundred square feet for its pro^^er display; 
and, finally, an ethnological collection, arranged ty countries, filling a 
hall 60 by 48 feet, with broad galleries and spacious cases. These col- 
lections are all fully and clearly labeled. At close intervals throughout 
the entire collection special colored labels are displayed, calling atten- 
tion, by title and shelf number, to books in the public library referring 
to the immediate group, so that a student or xHipii from the public 
schools need only transcribe on a bit of pai^er a set of numbers and 
present it at the delivery window of the public library to be provided at 
once with the books on the special subject desired. Great credit is 
due to Mr. Robinson, in charge of the museum, for the good taste 



IF PUBLIC LIBRARIES, WHY NOT PUBLIC MUSEUMS? 779 

sLown in the arrangement of the collection, and to Mr. Jones, the 
librarian of the public library, for cooperating so heartily m the work 

of the academy. , . ,

educational way, and for the good of the general public. The collec- 
ttns t^is made available are the results of years of devoted labor by 
many ardent students and collectors. , 

Is it to be supposed that other communities may call into existence 
even a limited collection of objects for a museum, as they might bring 
tooether the material for a public library ? With any reasonable appro- 
priation of money this can be done. At the present time there are many 
reputable firms which stand ready to furnish, at reasonable prices, col- 
lections representing the various departments of science. ^^^^^^T, 
cantile features of a museum, such as cases, adjustable bracket^, table s, 
insect boxes, jars, etc., can be got from the proper sources ^^JJ^'f^^ 
library has its salaried oflicer and assistants, and buys it. books, why 
should not a public museum be installed under precisely simdar condi- 
tions^ There is no reason, save the fact that most of the museums in 
the country have had a fortuitous beginning, usually due to a coterie of 
men directly interested in science who, bringing together collections of 
interest, have been generous enough to permit the public to enjoy them 
on certain days in the year. In some cases a large endowment has 
enabled the society to share its treasures with the pubhc more freely. 
But we are digressing. With the facilities thus indicated for purchas- 
ing material, a definite plan is to be laid out, upon which the collec^ 
tions are to be brought together. An epitome collection ot the annual 
kingdom, large or small as the case may be, is to be seemed^ This 
will come to hand properly prepared, mounted and labeled. Having 
obtained this, the museum has the models upon which to pi^pare the 
local collection. Home talent will have to be looked to tor this mate- 
rial- and if none are found competent to do the work, a collector irom 
elsewhere must be employed for the purpose. The initial steps having 
been taken, the lines are indicated along which it is possible to utihze 
the voluntary aid of such collectors as the community may possess, 
although the museum of to-day can not depend upon voluntary service 
entirely. Special private collections of shells, insects,-minerals, areh.eo- 
logical relics, etc., will naturally gravitate toward the public museum, 
either by gift or by purchase; and thus, slowly but surely, the 
foundations of a museum will have been fairly started. 

Finally, in the museum of the future the errors of tiie past should be 



780 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. 

avoided. Private collections, when given to a museum, must be incor- 
porated with the other collections. Collections should not be accepted 
with the condition that they are to have sejjarate rooms or cases for 
their display. There are occasions when an exception can be made; 
as when, for instance, the collection is far more complete than the 
one already possessed, though in this case the smaller collection should 
be merged with the larger. An inconvenience has always arisen from 
the continual accession of material which necessitates the rearranging 
of collections for their admission. This difficulty can be overcome by 
setting apart a special room or a set of cases in which the donations 
can be kept for one year, this receptacle to be plainly marked "new 
accessions to the museum." In this way a rearrangement, and conse- 
quent disturbance, takes place only once a year. Furthermore, the 
exhibition of these accessions separately will stimulate the activity 
and i)ride of local collectors and others interested. 

Above all, the bane and misery of dubious accumulations should be 
avoided. A specimen is either of use, or it is not. If worthy of pres- 
ervation, it should find its place in the collections; if not, it should be 
transferred to those who will make use of it, or be destroyed. The 
rubbish which accumulates in many of our museums and is hoarded 
from year to year with the hope that it may some time be of use is 
paralleled by the collections of junk with which some are inclined to 
encumber their premises. 

That some kind of a public museum, along the lines and in the ways 
above suggested, is possible for smaller towns there is no doubt. A 
wholesome spirit of rivalry might naturally arise, and each town having 
its museum would excel in certain departments, in the same way that 
each town can pride itself on certain special features, such as a fine 
park, spacious town hall, public library, or superior high school build- 
ing. Unfortunate, indeed, is that town— and there are hundreds of 
them in this country— that can show nothing but the mere elements of 
material existence ; in this respect not a whit removed from the barren- 
ness of a sheep pasture. To bring up young children in such a town 
is to stunt their intellectual powers, and to narrow persistently the 
horizon of their life.
