JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF 
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 



Washington, January U, 1888. 

The stated annual meeting of the Board of llegeuts of the Smithso- 
nian Institution was held this day at 10:30 o'clock A. M. 

Present : Chief-Justice M. R. Waite, Chancellor of the Institution, 
Hon. S. S. Cox, Hon. W. W. Phelps, Hon. Joseph Wheeler, Dr. 
Henry Coppee, Dr. J. B. Angell, Dr. J. C. Welling, General M. 
C. Meigs, and the Secretary, Professor Langley. 

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Dr. Noah Porter and 
Senator J. S. M(»rrill. The Secretary made a statement that the ab- 
sence of Dr. Asa Gray was caused by his severe illness. 

The journal of the proceedings of the Board at the meetings on Janu- 
ary 12 and November 18, 1887, was read and approved. 

The Secretary stated that in accordance with the instructions of the 
Board at the last meeting, he had again consulted with the widow of 
the late Professor Baird, and ascertained that while she desired to 
defer to the wishes of the Regents, her own preference would be that 
the interment of the remains of her husband should be strictly private. 
It was necessary therefore to depart from the arrangements which had 
been contemplated at the last meeting of the Board, and by the advice 
of the Executive Committee, a meeting of the Board of Regents was not 
called as had been anticipated in December, and the stated annual 
meeting is therefore now held at tbe regular time, as provided by the 
regulations of the Board of Regents. 

The Chancellor announced the appointment by the President of the 
Senate, on December 19, 1887, of Hon. Randall L. Gibson, of Louisiana, 
as a regent of the Smithsonian Institution, vice Senator Maxey, whose 
term had expired. 

The Chancellor also announced the appointment by the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives, on January 5, 1888, of Hon. S. S. Cox, 
of New York, as regent, vice Hon. O. R. Singleton, who had not been 
re-elected to Congress ; and on the 10th of January, of Hon. Joseph 
Wheeler, of Alabama, vice Hon. W. L. Wilson, and the re-appointment 
of Hon. W. W. Phelps, of New Jersey. 

Dr. Welling, chairman of the Executive Committee, presented its an- 
nual report for the year ending June 30, 1887. 

Dr. Welling, in presenting the report, called attention to !f paragraph 
on the third page, relative to the appropriation for "ethnological re-

XII JOURNAL OP PROCEEDINGS. 

s<';nclics,":iii(l he wIsIkmI it niHlcrstood— notas a matter of cntiolsm,biit- 
jii ('X|»laiiiitioM — that the I'^xoeiitive Coiniiiittee made no examination 
or iiisi)ection of the accounts of the Bureau of Ethnology. These were 
exclusively under the control— according to the acts of Congress mak- 
ing the appropriations — "of the /Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion." In this respect a difference existed between the duty of the com- 
mittee in regard to these accounts and those of the Museum or of other 
trusts cammitte<l to the Institution, of which careful examination was 
made of every voucher. 

The Secretary stated that he would be very willing to be relieved of 
this weighty responsibility and would be gratified if it could be assumed 
by the Regents. He had no desire to assume a personal responsibility 
in regard to the approjjriation referred to, and he hoped that in the 
future it might be found possible to make the approi)riations to the 
" Smithsonian Institution'''' instead of to the " Secretary.''^ 

Dr. Welling remarked that the Executive Committee does not care to 
share this responsibility. 

Dr. Copp«'e said he thought it the duty of the Regents to share in 
this ; and that if the language of the act was doubtful, and if in relation 
to one trust it was the duty of the Secretary to confer with the Execu- 
tive Committee, he thought that in others, although the Regents or the 
Institution were not specially mentioned, he ought to come under the 
same arrangement. 

General Meigs said that Congress made the distinction referred to by 
Dr. Welling, and it was not for the Board to advise or dictate to Con- 
gress. 

[This view was assented to by various members of the Board.] 

The Secretary having stated that the accounts of the Museum were 
settled by the Interior Department, and that the estimates for preserva- 
tion, etc., of the collections were sent by him through the Secretary of 
the Interior to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chancellor remarked 
that he thought that all the accounts of the Institution in regard to 
any operations committed to it, should be settled directly with the 
Treasury Department, and not through an intermediate department. 

The Secretary said that the Chancellor had anticipated what he was 
about to say. As the Executive Committee had observed, the relations 
of the Museum with the Department of the Interior on the one hand 
and with the Regents on the other, are undoubtedly ambiguous, since 
the late Secretary of the Interior himself wrote to say that he did not 
understand them. At present the Secretary of the Institution transmits 
the estimates for the Bureau of Ethnology to the Secretary of thi^ Treas- 
ury, but does not transmit those of the Museum, which are sent through 
the Secretary of the Interior. It would seem desirable that some ar- 
rangement should be made by which. in the future all the estimates 
should be submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury, and all appro- 
priations for the Museum, as well as for the Bureau of Ethnology, made 



JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIII 

to the Smithsonian Institution, and that the sundry civil bill should be 
changed in the items relating to the Museum and the Bureau of Eth- 
nology. 

The Chancellor expressed the opinion that all the appropriations 
ought to be disbursed and controlled by the Institution. 

After remarks by several of the Regents, on motion of Dr. Welling, 
the following resolution was adopted : 

Resolved, That the Regents recommend to Congress that the form of 
the sundry civil appropriation bill be so changed in the items relating 
to the Museum and the Bureau of Ethnology as to provide, 

First, That these moneys shall be disbursed under the direction of 
the Smithsonian Institution. 

Second, That the estimates for the appropriations of the Museum in 
future shall be sent direct to the Secretary of the Treasury by the 
Smithsonian Institution through its Secretary. 

On motion, it was resolved that the report of the Executive Committee 
be accepted. 

The Secretary presented the annual report for the year ending June 
:30, 1887, which had been printed; but he regretted to say that he had 
not been able to procure copies from the Public Printer in December, in 
accordance with the resolutions of the Board. 

The Chancellor suggested that some action ought to be taken by Con- 
gress to avoid delay in printing the annual reports of the Institution. 
He thought provision might be made by law for the printing of the 
Smithsonian Institution outside of the Government Printing Office, ns is 
done in the case of the printing for the Supreme Court. The attention 
of the Congressional Regents was especially called to this subject. 

The Secretary stated that a large amount of indispensable i)rinting 
was now done through the Department of the Interior, and some pro- 
vision ought to be made for this if the connection of the Museum with 
the Department should cease. He hoped that the Congressional Re- 
gents would take some action in this matter. 

On motion of Mr. Cox, it was resolved that the report of the Secre- 
tary for the year ending June 30, 1887, be accepted, and that the Sec- 
retary transmit the same to Congress. 

The Chancellor announced that on December 2, 1887, in accordance 
with the statute, he h.id appointed Mr. G. Brown Goode to act as Act- 
ing Secretary in case of the absence or disability of the Secretary. 

The Secretary called the attention of the Board to a bill introduced in 
the Senate by Senator Edmunds on the 12th of December, as follows : 

A BILL to provide for payiujj the widow of tbo late Spencer F. Baird for the services 
rendered by Iiim as Comniissiouer of Fish and Fisheries. 
Be It enacted by the Senate and Home of Representatives of the United 
mates of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the Treas- 
ury be, and he is liereby, directed to pay ]\Irs. Mary C. Baird. widow of 
the late Spencer F. Baird, the sum of titty thousand dollars, out of any 
money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, in full compensation 



XIV JOUKNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 

tor the services and expenses of the said Spencer F. Baird during his 
adininislration of the ottice of Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries, from 
February twenty-tiftli, eighteen hundred and seventy-one, to the time 
of his death in August, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven. 

The Secretary also called attention to the fact that Senator Morrill 
had introduced a bill in the Senate on the 12th of December, 1887, as 
follows : 

A BILL for the erection of a bronze statue of Spencer F. Bairtl, late Secretary of the 

Smithsonian Institution. 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the liegents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution be, and are hereby, authorized to contract for a statue 
in bronze of Spencer F. Baird, late Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, to be erected upon the grounds in front of the National Museum ; 
and for this i)urpose, and for the entire expense of the foundation and 
pedestal of the monument, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, or so 
much of said sum as may be needed, is hereby appropriated, out of any 
moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated. 

On motion of Mr. Phelps it was resolved that the Executive Commit- 
tee and the Secretary be authorized to act for the Board of Eegents 
in case of the ])assage of any act of Congress relative to the erection of 
a statue of Professor Baird. 

The Secretary stated that he had but one more matter to which to 
call the attention of the Board ; it was brief, but of considerable im- 
portance. 

It may be remembered that several years ago the Secretary of the In- 
stitution, Professor Baird, called the attention of the liegents to a bill 
ntroduced in the House of Representatives as follows, viz: 

"For the erection of a tire-proof building on the south portion of the Smithsonian 
Reservation for the accommodation of the U. S. Geological Survey, aud for other 
purposes. 

" Beit enacted by the Senate and Rouse of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the sum of two hundred 
thousand dollars be, and hereby is, appropriated out of any money in 
the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the erection of a fire proof 
building on the south i)ortion of the Smithsonian Keservatiou for the 
accomiiiodatiou of the U. S. Geological Survey, and for other purposes: 
Prot'idcd, That theconsent of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution 
l>e first obtained thereto, and that the building be under their direction 
when completed : And provided further, That the bnihliug be erected by 
the Architect of the Capitol in accordance with plans approved by the 
Director of tlie United States Geological Survey, the Secretary of the 
Smithsonian Institution, and the Architect of the Capitol, acting as a 
board therefor. 

^' After a very full expression by the Regents in favor of immediate 
action, on motion of General Sherman, it was 

''Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution 
recommend to Congress to enlarge the National Museum, so as properly 
to exhibit the mineral, geological, and other collections already on 
hand and increasing each year, by the erection of a tire-proof building 



JUUKNAL OF PKOCEEDIxNGS. XV 

on the southwest corner of the Smithsonian Keserv'ation. similar in 
style to the present National Museum, and they requestau appropriation 
of $300,000 therefor, to be ex[>ended under the direction of the Kegents 
of the Institution." * 

The Secretary remarked that the placing of the offices of the Geologi- 
cal Survey upon laud heretofore reserved exclusively for Smithsonian 
purposes might be perhaps considered as committing the Institution 
toward the policy of a union with other scientitic bureaus of the Gov- 
ernment. It was in view of the questions of general i)olicy thus involved, 
that it seemed proper that he should ask instruction from the llegents. 
He could only infer their opinion on the former bill from the language 
of the resolution, which apparently implied, 

First That increased provision was desirable for the Museum col- 
lections. 

Second. From its silence as to the Geological Survey, tliat the building 
proposed in the bill was not to be appropriated to that use. 

The Secretary had lately been informally advised that it was the desire 
of the Geologica'l Survey to obtain his opinion with reference to this, in 
anticipation of a bill to be brought before the present Congress, and he 
desired to be ftivored with the. judgment of the Regents. 

The Chancellor stated that it was desirable that uew Museum build- 
ings should be erected in any case, but that since by act of Congress 
a certain part of the public grounds had been set apart and appropri- 
ated absolutely and exclusively to the Smithsonian Institution, he for 
one did not want to see anything else placed on these grounds. He 
further said: "If the Smithsonian Institution is to grow it will need 
chem all, and whatever is put upon them should be under our exclu- 
sive control." 

After remarks by a number of Regents, expressing concurrence in 
the views of the Chancellor, it was suggested by Mr. Pheli)s that the 
unanimous opinion of the Board ought to be embodied in a resolution. 

The Chancellor did not think this was necessary. He supposed all 
the Secretary wanted was the moral support of the Board in a policy 
which would forbid the placing of any building on the Smithsonian 
grounds except for the exclusive use of the Smithsonian Institution. 

The Secretary alluded to another bill, which proposed to occupy part 
of the public grounds, including the Smithsonian reservation, with 
building's for the Columbian celebration in 1892. ' It was here remarked 
by a Regent that there was no danger of this being done immediately, 
to which the Chancellor said, " With my consent, never." 

On motion of Dr. Angell, it was resolved that the income of the Insti- 
tution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1888, and ending June 30, 
1889, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended 
by the Secretary, with the advice of the Executive Committee, upon the

basis of the operations described in the last annual report of said cora- 
niittee, with full discretion on the part of the Secretary as to items of 
exi)endituies properly falling under each of the heads embraced in the 
established conduct of the Institution. 

The Chancellor informed the Board that he had the melancholy duty 
to perform of announcing the death, yesterday, of Dr. Peter Parker, 
who had been for many years a Kegent of the Institution and chairman 
of its Executive Committee. 

On motion of Dr. Angell, it was resolved that the Executive Commit- 
tee prepare resolutions relative to the death of Dr. Parker. 

Dr. Welling, of the Executive Committee, presented the following 
resolutions, which were adopted : 

Whereas the Board has received the afflictive intelligence that the 
venerable Dr. Peter Parker, who, for sixteen years, was a member of 
the Board of Regents, and who for this whole period served with tidelity 
on its Executive Committee, has departed this life after a long career 
tilled with useful labors in the service of God and of man : Therefore, 
be it 

Resolved, That in the retrospect of such a life-career, protracted as it 
was beyond the limits usually allotted to men, and yet at each stage of 
its progress dedicated to beneficeut works in the cause of religion, 
philanthropy, and science, we desire to testify our respect for tiie exalted 
worth and scrupulous conscientiousness which Dr. Parker brought to 
the discharge of every duty, and which, during his connection with the 
government of this Institution, were nobly exemplified by the zeal and 
diligence with which he ever watched and worked for its prosperity 
and usefulness, even during the later period of his honorable service, 
when the burden of years was added to the burden of his official cares, 
ami when with a less conscientious sense of public duty he might 
have claimed an exemption from the tasks of life. 

Resolved, That since the retirement of our departed colleague from the 
membership of this Board we have continued to follow him with the 
grateful recollections inspired by the association of this council cham- 
ber, as well as with a reverent respect for the Christian patience with 
which he bore the infirmities of advancing age and the unfaltering 
Christian hope with which he awaited " the inevitable hour" in full 
assurance of immortality. 

Resolved, That these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of the 
Hoard, and that the Secretary of the Institution is hereby requested to 
transmit a copy of them to the family of our late colleague. 

On motion, the Board then adjourned sine die. 



SPECIAL MEETING OF THE EEGENTS. 

Washington, March 27, 1888. 

A special meeting of the Board of Kegents was held this day at 11 
o'clock A. M. 

Present, Hon. J. J. Ingalls (President of the United States Senate 
pro tern.); Hon. Samuel F. Miller (acting Chief Jusiice of the United 
States) ; Hon. J. S. MoRRiLL, Hon. S. M. Cullom, Hon. S. S. Cox, 
Hon. Joseph Wheeler, Hon. William W. Phelps, Dr. James C. 
Welling, General M. C. Meigs, and the Secretary, Prof. S. P. Lang- 
ley. 

The Secretary called the Board to order. 

On motion of Senator Morrill, Hon. J. J. Ingalls was elected Chair- 
man. 

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Dr. Porter, Dr. Coppek, 
Dr. Angell, and Dr. White. 

The Secretary stated that this special meeting had been called at the 
request of three of the Kegents as provided in the organic act. There 
were two subjects requiring consideration : First, the recent death of 
the Chancellor of the Institution, Chief Justice Waite ; second, the elec- 
tion of a Chancellor. 

Professor Langley remarked that it would be for others who had 
known the late Chancellor longer than he had to speak of his worth and 
I)ublic services. He could only say that Judge Waite was not only a 
tower of strength to the Institution ; he was much more ; he had the 
regard, the respect, and the reverence of all those who were brought into 
relation with him. He could only speak of him with the real affection 
he felt, and say that the loss the Institution had experienced was to 
him that of a dear and revered personal friend. 

On the second point, the Secretary stated that the joint signatures of 
the Chancellor and Secretary were required on requisitions for money 
from the United States Treasury for carrying on the operations of the 
Institution, and that on the 1st of next July the semiannual interest; 
would be due, and some one who could act as Chancellor, within the 
provisions of the law, must sign the requisition in connection with the 
Secretary, at that time. 

On motion of Dr. Welling, a committee was appointed to express the 
sense of the Board in relation to the death of the Chancellor. 

The Chair appointed Dr. Welling, Senator Morrill, and Professor 
Langley.

XVIII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 

The committee retired ;ind oii its return reported tbrougli the chair- 
man, Dr. Wellinjj, the following preamble and resolutions, which were 
unanimously adopted: 

Whereas the Board of llegents of the Smithsonian Institution has 
been called to meet in extraordinary session by the atflicting intelli- 
gence that iMoRRisoN Remick Waite, late Chief-Justice of the 
5ui)reme Court of the United States, and late Chancellor of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, has been removed by the hand of death from the 
scene of his high activities and distinguished usefulness; therefore be it 
Resolved, That sitting as we do at this time and jdace, in the very 
center of that dark shadow whicii has fallen upon the whole land in the 
lamented death of the late Chief-Justice Waite, and appalled as we 
are by the suddenness as well as by the magnitude of the great afflic- 
tion which in coming to the nation at large has come to us individually, 
with an added pathos of sorrow because of the nearer view we have 
had, for so many years, of the talents, virtues, and graces which found 
their fauiiliar home in the person of our honored friend, we could with 
much good reason crave for ourselves, in this hour of bereavement, the 
humble ].ermission of mourning apart, that we might silently gauge 
the depth and the dimensions of a calamity which brings to us its 
message of personal grief and which has also torn away from our high- 
est seat of justice its venerated and beloved chief; from the legal i)ro- 
fession of the country its foremost ofdcial representative and therefore 
its crowning exponent; from the walks of social life in this national 
capital a commanding i)resence no less remarkable for his genial and 
open hearted sincerity than for his aft'able and gracious benignity ; and 
from the (Christian communion a true and faithful disciple who wit- 
nessed a good confession as much by the simplicity and humility with 
which he walked before God as by the unswerving consistency with 
which he wore the ornament of a pure heart and of a meek and quiet 
si)irit before the scrutiny of his fellow-men. 

Kesolved, That while an obvious sense of propriety must dictate that 
we should leave to others in that great forum which was the chosen 
arena of his life's career the sad privilege of depicting, with minute 
and detailed analysis, the remarkable combination of strong and lovely 
traits which met in the person of the late Chief-Justice and gave to the 
symmetrical character of our beloved friend its blended sw^eetuess and 
light, we can not omit, even in this hour of our special sorrow, to bear 
our cheerful testimony to the pleasing amenity with which he presided 
over the deliberations of this council chamber as the Chancellor of the 
Smithsonian Institution, and sharing, as we all do, in a i)rofound ad- 
miration lor lue intelligence he brought to our discussions, while ever 
moderating them by the guidance of his clear thought and mild wisdom, 
we can but render our reverent homage to the engaging personal qual- 
ities which endeared him to us as a man, while at the same time grate- 
fully confessing our obligations to him for the provident care and deep 
interest which he always brought to the discharge of his official duties 
111 this place, where, through all the years of his honorable and useful 
service at the head of this Board, the Secretary of the Institution in 
common with ourselves has leaned on him as the wise and true coun- 
sellor who could be trusted as well for the rectitude of his moral intui- 
tions as for the clear perceptions of his calm and judicious intellect. 

Resolved, That we will attend the funeral of our departed Chancellor 
111 ;i body, and that the Secretary oi' the Institution, together with a. 
«le])utation irom the memlx'rs of the Board, berecjuested to accompany 



JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIX 

the Other friends and associates of the hite Chief-Justice who will bear 
his remains to their hist resting place in Ohio. 

Eeiiolved, That these resolutions be entered on the minutes of the 
Board, and that the Secretary be requested to send a copy of them to 
the family of our departed friend in token of our sincere condolence 
with them in their great atfiictiou. 

On motion of Senator Cullom it was resolved, that Acting Chief- 
Justice Samuel F. Miller be elected Chancellor j;ro tem. 

On taking the cliair, Justice Miller remarked that in this hour of 
grief it was a consolation to be honored with the appointment which 
bad just been conferred upon him, especially as it was not a necessity 
of law that he as Acting Chief- Justice should have been selected to fill 
this important position. While it would not be expected of him on the 
present occasion to deliver a eulogy on the late Chancellor, it was only 
proper for him to say that, sitting beside Judge Waite as he had done 
for four hours a day for about fourteen years, he felt as well qualified 
to appreciate his character as any man living. He was an able judge, 
an upright man, honest in every fiber of his nature. No soi)histry 
could induce him to act in violation of his conscience. He never was led 
to believe only what he desired to believe, or to decide against his con- 
victions of right. He was a sound jurist, and above all an able manager 
of our complicated legal administrative affairs. We can not do too 
much to honor his memory. 

He thanked the gentlemen of the Board for the honor they had con- 
ferred in electing him Chancellor. 

On motion of Mr. Phelps, it was resolved, that all or any of the mem- 
bers of the Board, and the Secretary, who wish to attend the funeral 
services of the late Chancellor at Toledo, be appointed to represent the 
Board of Regents. 

On motion, the Board then adjourned sine die.

REPORT OF SAMUEL P. LANGLE7, 

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR 1887-'8d. 



To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution: 

Gentlemen : I liave the honor to preseut with this the customary 
report for the year ending eJune 30, 1888. 

This year is memorable for the loss to the Institution, not only of its 
Chancellor and of others to be mentioned later, but of its late Secretary, 
Spencer F. Baird. 

I have endeavored elsewhere to characterize his character and serv- 
ices, while yet feeling that one who has been so recently called to fill 
his place is hardly the fittest person to adequateij^ describe them ; but 
that may surely be repeated here which is no secret to any one, that 
a most honored and useful life, which might have been prolonged for 
many years, came to an end which can not but be called premature, 
largely through a too self-sacrificing devotion to the public service. 

I shall also have to speak later of the loss to the Institution of its 
Chancellor, the late Chief-Justice of the United States — a man whom 
those honored with his acquaintance grew, in proportion to their 
knowledge of him, to look up to and trust ; and of one of its Eegents, 
Prof. Asa Gray, pre-eminent in science, but in whom, as in the Chief- 
Justice, the qualities of the intellect were supplemented by others, such 
that both inspired even in their official relations, a feeling not only of 
respect, but of afi'ection, which the formal intercourse o£ public life 
rarely brings. 

The past has, indeed, been a fatal year to the Institution ; but these 
great losses have been spoken of at length in its necrology, and 1 will 
now ask to be allowed to preface this and the rest of my report by a 
few personal words. 

Although long acquainted with both Professor Henry and Professor 
Baird [ had no official relationship with either until two years ago, when 
the latter, in view of the end which he must have felt to be approaching, 
asked me if I was disposed to assume a connection with the Institution 
wkile continuing the scientific researches to which my life had been 
chiefly devoted. 

The position then tendered me, and later at your hands, that of Sec- 
retary, was accepted, from the knowledge that in your view such re- 
gea^rches for the increase of knowledge, no Jess thau administrative la* 
H. Mis, 143 1 ^ 



2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

bors, formed tbe essential duties of the place to which I was honored 
by your invitation, though it has happened that this, the first year of 
these duties, has been passed all but exclusively ia purely administra- 
tive work, of which there is alone occasion at present to speak. 

The year was begun with the feeling that it was best to closely follow 
the methods of my predecessors till a longer experience should have 
brought material for independent judgment; but at its close I desire to 
be allowed to say that every experience has enhanced my confidence in 
their polic;^ as a permanent guide; and if it be true, as has sometimes been 
said, that men eminent in science are apt to be devoid of capacity in the 
management of daily affairs, we must conclude that Professor Henry 
was a singular exception to such a rule ; for the practical wisdom of the 
general lines of conduct laid down by him, and adopted by my honored 
predecessor, so commend themselves to me in the light of daily service 
that more trust in them is felt with every new trial. 

From them there may, it seems to me, be deduced some general con- 
siderations with reference to the Smithsonian Institution and its asso- 
ciate interests, of which the following brief summary' represents those 
general principles of official action by which I have sought to be guided. 

If the position of the Smithsonian is that of a ward of the Govern- 
ment, having property of its own, for which that Goveniment acts the 
part of a trustee, while leaving its administration wholly with the Ee- 
geuts, it follows that the Institution enjoys a measure of independence, 
and in it a power of initiative for good which ought to be deemed its 
most privileged possession ; so that any action which is taken by one 
having its interests at heart, ought to be with this consideration of its 
independence always in mind. 

The Institution is for "the increase and diffusion of knowledge among 
men." It is not primarily for the promotion of utilitarian interests, 
which can be advanced through other channels, but for knowledge 
in the highest and v/idest sense, including not only all pure science, 
but even, in the words of Henry, " the true, the beautiful, as well as the 
immediately practical;" and these interests it is to guard from all en- 
tangling alliances- 

In dealing with the circumstances of to-day, the Institution should 
still be guided by these principU\s; but in bringing them to the test of 
present needs, we are daily reminded that these same principles are now 
to be often applied to quite new conditions. 

The Smithsonian has under its charge besides the Museum, tbe Bureau 
of Ethnology, which will be referred to later, and some minor interests, 
which are, however, insignificant in comparison. 

It has from time to time been proposed by friends outside of this 
Institution that it should take on much wider cares than these, and 
that it should be the center around which all the scientific establish- 
ments of the Government might cluster. In the writer's opinion it 



KEPOKT OF THE SECKETAKY. 3 

would not be perhaps impossible, but it would certainly be difficult, to 
make such a permanent arrangement consistently with the independence 
of the Smithsonian, and its continued devotion to the original objects 
of its being; but since the project is from time to time renewed, it may 
not be superfluous to observe that in any case the Museum would stand 
on an entirely diflereut footing from any other governmental bureau of 
applied science, if only because it has been created in a very consider- 
able degree out of the endowment income of the Institution; while other 
scientific bureaus have grown up wholly independent of the Smithso- 
nian, which has neither legal nor moral title to their property. 

It must be admitted, however, that the line of demarcation, even in 
the Museum, between the property to which the Smithsonian has an 
undoubted legal title; that to which this claim is only presumptive; and 
that to which it has no claim, is not in all cases at present clearly drawn, 
and we are endeavoring to remedy this uncertainty. As regards the 
care of this property, a great gain has been made in the past year by 
carrying out (with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior) the 
wishes which the Eegents expressed in regard to the Museum at their 
last meeting; so that it is no longer uncertain how far this care falls 
upon the Institution, and how far upon the Interior Department. 

Keference has just been made to the question of the general policy to 
be followed by the Smithsonian with regard to its accepting the charge 
of other Government departments of science, and this question is so far 
from being an idle one that the Secretary has been called upon during 
the past year to consider whether it was his duty to advise that the Fish 
Commission, which until lately had such intimate though unofficial re- 
lations with the Institution, should be united with it by a legal bond, 
or not. While feeling that it would be in many respects most desira- 
ble to connect with the Smithsonian the purely scientific portions of the 
Fish Commission and its ai)paratus of research, he could not but recog- 
nize that these were almost iudissolubly mingled with certain great 
utilitarian interests, which were not equally proper subjects of the 
Smithsonian's care; and after consultation with those Kegents whose 
advice he could separately obtain, he felt unable to urge such a union 
with any confidence thiiv it would meet the approbation of the Board. 

The President saw tit to appoint as Commissioner, Dr. G. Brown 
Goode, the Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who, 
while still, with my full consent, retaining that place, accepted the 
office provisionally, from a sense of duty to the interests of the Fish 
Commission, concerning which he had obtained an intimate acquaint- 
ance under the late Professor Baird. 

Having placed these interests on a proper footing ; after a brief period 
of laborious but wholly gratuitous service, he declined the higher salary 
and permanent appointment of Commissioner which was pressed upon 
him, and resumed the duti«?s hereto which his scientific life has beeu 
chiefly devoted. 



4 REPOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

On the 2(1 of December, 1887, the eliancellor, Chief-Justice Waite, 
under the provision of the law, designated Dr. G. Brown Goode as 
Acting Secretary of tlie Smithsonian Institution during the absence of 
the Secretary. 

If only from the ordinary need of a periodical revision, nearly every 
department of the Institution has been the subject of examination, and 
in some cases of considerable modification during the past year, and I 
now proceed to speak of these in some detail, prefacing each with a 
brief statement of such considerations as seem to me deserving of the 
particular attention of the Regents. 

BOARD OF REGENTS. 

Meetings ofths Board. — A special meeting of the Board was held No- 
vember 18, 1887, to take action in regard to the death of the Secretary, 
Spencer Fullerton Baird, and at this meeting Samuel Pierpont Langley 
was elected his successor. 

The stated annual meeting of the Board was held on the 11th Jan- 
uary, 1888. 

A special meeting of the Board was also held on the 27th March, 1888, 
to take action in regard to the death of the chancellor of the Institution, 
Chief-Justice Waite. 

The journal of proceedings of the Board is given in full, as usual, in 
the introduction of the Eegents' report. 

Changes in tJie Board of Regents. — Other vacancies than those already 
mentioned have occnrred in the membership of the Board during the 
year by the expiration of the legal terms of service. 

Senator Maxey's term ended March 3, 1887, and with the close of 
the Forty-ninth Congress the terms of the Hon. 0. 11. Singleton, of the 
Hon. W. L. Wilson, and of the Hon. W. W. Phelps, members of the 
House of Ilepresentatives, also expired; and on the 19th of December, 
1887, the President of the Senate appointed the Hon. Randall Lee Gib- 
son, Senator from Louisiana, a Regent for the terra of six years, to fill 
the vacancy occasioned by Senator Maxey's retirement. On the 5th of 
January, 1888, the Speaker of the House of Representatives appointed 
the Hon. Samuel S. Cox, of New York, a Regent in the place of the 
Hon. Otho R. Singleton ; and on the 10th of January, 1888, he appointed 
the Hon. Joseph Wheeler, of Alabama, a Regent in the place of the Hon. 
William L. Wilson, and re-appointed the Hon. William Walter Phelps, 
of New Jersey, to continue his service as Regent. Lastly, by joint reso 
lution of Congress, approved by President Cleveland, February 15, 1888, 
Dr. Andrew D. White, of New York, was elected a Regent for the term 
of six years, to fill the place of Dr. Asa Gray, deceased. 

At the special meeting of the Board of Regents, held March 27, 1888, 
Mr. Justice Samuel F. Miller, senior Associate and acting Chief Justice 
of the United States Supreme Court, was eleQted to act as chancellor of 
the Institution pro tempore. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5 

FINANCES. 

While with this is preseuted the report of the Executive Committee 
aud other statements, showing that the fimds are iu the usual sense iu 
a satisfactory condition, this seems to be a proper occasion to say some- 
thing about the hirger questions of finance, for, as time passes, the 
purchasing- power of money imperceptibly but surely alters, until finally 
the consideration is forced upon us that these slow changes, though 
almost inappreciable from year to year, have, in the half century already 
elapsed since Congress accepted Siuithson's bequest, essentially dimin- 
ished the actual value of the fund, while its nominal value remains 
unchanged. 

I do not now refer merely to the fact that we measure all things by 
another scale in 1888 from what we did in 1S3G; or that, owing to the 
immense increase of public wealth, the capital of the original bequest, 
which then was greater than any but a few private fortunes, has be- 
come relatively so inconsiderable to-day. More than this is meant. Ft 
is meant that the actual purchasing power of each dollar is, for our 
purposes, notably less ; that it is being forced upon us that we can not 
print as many books, or pay as many employes, or make as man}" re- 
searches as when the scheme of expenditure was first fixed, and that, 
consequently, a scheme which was wise then, because not only desirable 
but feasible, is not necessarily so now. 

I know that this consideration is not presented to the Eegents for the 
first time, and that a«committee of their number, as long ago as 1877, 
observed — 

"That the income of the Smithsonian fund, while nominally fixed, is 
growing actually less year by year, with the rapidly-changing value of 
money, and of less and less importance in.the work that it accomplishes 
with reference to the immense extension of the country since the Gov- 
ernment accepted the trust." 

In a time, short with reference to the probable life of the Institution, 
the income of the Smithsonian fund proper will necessarily become en- 
tirely inadequate to carry on the object of Henry's care on the scale 
which he inaugurated. Even when this is the case, it seems to me that 
this income of the Smithsonian bequest will still have a value wholly 
beyond its nominal one, for it will at least maintain the Institution in 
that position of independence and disinterestedness which are its most 
potent means of influencing others to aid iu carrying out the intention 
of its founder. 

It is, nevertheless, most evidently desirable that the fund should be 
enlarged both by Governmental recoutribution and by private bequest, 
so as to constantly represent at least the original i)ositiou of its finances 
relatively to those of the country and contemporary institutions of learn- 
ing; a position which we can estimate from the observation that there 
are several such institutions, which were at first scarcely on a par with it 
financially, but whose funds, having been invested so as to share in the 



6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

growth of the country, and aided by private benefaction, now surpass 
ours from ten to twenty fold. 

We can never regret the generous spirit which has dictated the direc- 
tion of the expenditure of the Smithsonian income in tlie past, but it is 
true that if a less absolutely unselfish i)olicy had been followed — if, for 
instance, though keeping up all proper expenditures for the increase 
and diffusion of knowledge, those funds whose expenditure has practi- 
cal! j^ inured chiefly to the benefit of the General Government had been 
allowed to accumulate — the Institution would have been comparatively 
wealthy to-day. 

I will instance, in explanation of my meaning, the remark of Profes- 
sor Elenry in 1872, to the effect that the Government, in equity, should 
then have paid the Institution $300,000 for the use of the present build- 
ing. This building, erected wholly out of Smithsonian funds at the cost 
of over half a million dollars, has, with the exception of a small por- 
tion, been ever since that time used rent-free by the Government ; and 
if the observation had force then, it has double force to-day. 

Again, the Institution has left in perpetual charge of the nation, in 
the Museum alone, property acquired out of its private fund (and to 
which it has apparently the same title), which is probably now more 
than equal in value to the whole amount of the Smithsonian bequest. 

While it is gratefully recognized that Congress has never dealt in any 
ungenerous spirit with the Institution, I can not tliink it superfluous to 
keep such facts as those just cited in mind at a time when it becomes 
necessary to review the whole scheme of expendilure, in view of an 
income practically diminishing, and which would, if not for these facts, 
be more than double its actual amount. 

The will of James Smithson, of England, " to found at Washington, 
under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for 
the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men," was made Octo- 
ber 23, 1826. 

The existence of the bequest was communicated to Congress by a 
message from the President of the United States December 17, 1835, 
and by an act of Congress approved July 1, 1836, the bequest was ac- 
cepted, and the President was authorized and enabled to assert and 
prosecute with effect the claim of the United States to the property 
thereby bequeathed and then held in trust by the English court of 
chancery. 

Under this authority the sum of $508,318.46 was received in gold by 
the United States and placed in the Treasury. 

The "Smithsonian Institution" provided for in the will of Smithson 
was not established, however, hy Congress until August 10, 1846, when 
a definite plan of organization was adopted and operations commenced. 

By act of Congress February 8, 1867, the Secretary of the Treasury 
was authorized to receive a residuary legacy of Smithson, which had 
been received by the Institution in 1863, amounting to $26,210.63, on 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7 

the same terms as the ori<?iual bequest. I>y the same act the Regents 
were authorized to add to the Smithsonian fund such other sum as they 
might see fit to deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the 
sum of $1,000,000. 
The original bequest and the sums since added are therefore as follows: 

Bequest of Smithson, 1846 $515,169.00 

Residuary legacy of Smithson, 1867.... 26,-210.6:i 

Deposits from saviugs of income, etc., 1867 108,620.37 

Bequest of James Hamilton, 1874 1,000.00 

Bequest of Simeon Habel, 1880 500.00 

Deposit from proceeds of sale of bonds, 1881 51 , 500. 00 

Total permanent Smithsonian fund in the Treasury of the United 

States, bearing interest at 6 per cent. ])er annum 703, 000. 00 

At the beginning of the fiscal year the balance on hand of the income 
from the fund was $1,423.14. The interest paid semiannually July 1, 
1887, and January 1, 1888, w.as $42,180. 

To this was added from sales of publications and miscellaneous sources 
$752.8(5, making a total available amount for carrying on the operations 
of the Institution of $44,3oG; total expenditures for theyear, $39,540.77; 
leaving a balance July 1, 1888, of $4,809.23. 

It is proper in this connection to state that the Institution is charged 
by Congress with the care and disbursement of sundry appropriations, 
those for the past year being as follows : 

For international exchanges $12,000 

For ethnological researches 40, 000 

For preservation of Government and other collections In natural history, 

ethnology, etc., in the National Museum 116,000 

For furniture and fixtures for the National Museum 40, 000 

For heating, lighting, and electrical service for the Museum 12. 000 

The vouchers for all the expenditures from these appropriations as 
well as those from the Smithsonian income are carefully examined and 
I)assed upon by the Executive Committee of the Board of Regents, with 
one exception — those for ethnological researches. 

The disbursement of this appropriation from its commencement has 
been made under the direction of Maj. J. W. Powell, who has been in 
charge of the Bureau of Ethnology. 

The necessity of greatly increased appropriations for the proper con- 
duct of the interests committed by Congress to the care of the Insti- 
tution is daily more manifest, and has been made known in the strongest 
terms to the National Legislature. 

The estimates prepared to be submitted for the fiscal year ending 
June 30, 1889, are as follows : 

International exchanges $27,500 

Ethnological researches 50,000 

Preservation of collections 150, 000 

Furniture and fixtures 40,000 

Heating, lighting, etc 12,000 

279, 500 



8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

lu accordauce with tbe instructions of the Board of Regents at its 
last annual meeting, I requested the Committee on AppropriatioDS of 
the House of Kepresentatives to make certain changes iu the assign- 
ment of appropriations and the method of their disbursement. 

The following is the correspondence ou the subject with the Secretary 
of the Interior and with the chairman of the Committee ou Appropria- 
tions. 

Smithsonian Institution, 

February 29, 1888. 
Sir: I have the honor to make tbe following requests iu regard to 
the assignment of the appropriations for the maiutenance of the U. S. 
National Museum for the coming fiscal year: 

(1) That the items for "preservation of collections," "heating and 
lightiug," " furniture and fixtures" be transferred from their present 
position in the schedule of "Estimates of Appropriations, 1888-89" (p. 
237), under the Department of the Interior, to a place under the gen- 
eral head of "under the Smithsonian Institution," and along with and 
iu proximity to the other items to be expended under the direction of 
the Smithsonian Institutiou or its Secretary. 

(2) That each of these items be placed directly under the subhead 
" Under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution as 
director of the National Museum." 

(3) That a special item be inserted under the caption " Public print- 
ing and binding," providing the sum of $10,000 for printing labels and 
blanks for the use of the National Museum and for the " Bulletins" and 
annual volumes of the " Proceedings" of the Museum. 

In explanation of these requests, I submit the following statements: 

Theactof Congress establishing the Smitlisonian Institution, approved 
August 10, 1846 (Revised Statutes, Title LXXIIl, sections 5579, 5594), 
provided that all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and 
all objects of natural history, plants, and "geological and miueralogical 
specimens belonging or hereafter to belong to the United States, which 
may be in the city of Washington, shall be delivered to the Regents of 
the Smithsonian Institution, and, together with new specimens obtained 
by exchange, donation, or otherwise, shall be so arranged and classified 
as best to facilitate their examination and study. 

The National Museum, as it is now called, was thus placed under the 
sole control and direction of the Smithsonian Institution, and has ever 
since remained under its control ; Congress having, since 1858, made 
annual appropriations for its maintenance. Untiri880, however, the 
sums thus appropriated were inade(]uate, and the yearly deticiences 
were paid from the income of the Institution. 

In accordance with a practice of nearly thirty vears the estimates for 
the annual appropriations have been each year, at the request of the 
Secretary of this Institution, forwarded by the Secretary of the Interior 
to the Secretary of the Treasury for ti-ansmission to Congress, and tbe 
disbursement of the appropriation has been made by the disbursing 
agent of the Interior Department. 

This arrangement is somewhat inconvenient and cumbersome, and at 
the last meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian lustitutiou 
the following resolution was adopted: 

J^Resolced, That the Regents recommend to Congress that the form 
ot the sundry civil appropriation bill be so changed in the terms relating 
to the Museum and the Bureau of Ethnology as to provide— 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9 

" (1) That these moneys shall be disbursed under the direction of the 
Smithsonian Institution. 

" (2) That the estimates for the ai)proi)riations of the Museum in the 
future shall be sent direct to the Secretary of the Treasury by the 
Smithsonia!) Institution throujih its Secretary." 

In obedience to the wishes of the Board of Kegents thus expressed, 
the matter was brought to the attention of the Secretary of the Inte- 
rior, in a recent interview, by Chief- Justice Waite (the Chancellor of the 
Smithsonian Institution) and myself. As a result of this meeting a 
letter has been receiv^^d from the vSecretary of the Interior, in which he 
expresses the opinion that changes may be made with great propriety 
both in the manner of voting the appropriation and in the method of 
its disbursement. A copy of this letter is herewith inclosed, together 
with a copy of a second letter received in response to an inquiry as to 
the manner in which this change may best be effected. 

In further explanation of the third request, I wish to say that this 
does not involve a new appropriation, since the estimate for this amount 
is included, as I understand it, in the sum of $375,525 estimated by the 
Secretary of the Treasury for the printing of the Interior Department 
and its Bureaus (see i)age 121) of the "Estimates of Appropriations, 
1888-89"). I may say in further explanation of this item that an ap- 
propriation has thus been made for the printing of the National Museum 
for at least twelve years past, and 1 am informed that the amount al- 
lotted during recent years has usually been $10,000. 

I believe these changes will l>e in the interest of the public service, 
and respectfully ask tliat they be made.

Department of thk Interior, 

Washingfon, Fchruary 14, 1888. 

Sir: I have considered the topic of the conference which I had the 
honor to have yesterday with the Chancellor of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution and yourself, being the relation of the Interior Department to 
the expenditure of the appropriation for the increase and care of the 
National Museum, which is a part of the Smithsonian Institution, and 
whether there be objection to the recommendation of an independency 
in the disbursement of the funds provided for its support as well as in 
its management. 

The first collection of scientific curiosities which appears to have been 
a special object of care on the part of Congress was that made by the 
Wilkes Exploring Expedition, provided for by the act of May 14, 183(3 
(5 Stats., 29). Tliis collection was first placed in the care of the Na- 
tional Institution for the Promotion of Science, and afterwards was 
transferred to the hall in the second story of the Patent Office. In 
1846, when the act for the establishmentof the Smithsonian Institution 
was passed, it was])rovided that, "as suitable arrangements could be 
made for their recei)ti()n, all objects of art, and of foreign and curious 
research, and all objects of natural history, ])lants, geological and min- 
eralogical specimens, belonging or hereafter to belong to the United 



10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

States, wliicli may be in the city of Wasbiugtoii, in wbosesover custody 
the .same may be, sball be delivered to sncb i)ersoiis as may be author- 
ized by the Board of Kegeuts to receive them, and sliall be arranged iii 
siicii order and so classed as best to facilitate the examination and study 
of them in the building so as aforesaid to be erected for the Institu- 
tion ; " provision having been made in the act for a suitable building, 
etc. It was provided by Congress that the Smithsonian Institution 
might be constructed adjacent to the Patent Office Building, but the 
project was not accepted, and an independent building, where now 
located, was arranged, this being completed in the year 1853. 

It is said that the Secretary of the Inteiior and the Commissioner of 
Patents were <lesirous of removing the collections of the exploring ex- 
pedition and of the National Institution out of the Patent Office Build- 
ing, and requeste<l the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to receive 
them. This appears to have been acceded to by the Regents on the 
condition imposed that the Secretary of the Interior should provide for 
the payment of the expenses of the keeping and care of the collections. 

An approj)riation of $15,000 was made by Congress in the act of 
March 3, 1857, for the construction of cases, and of $2,000 for the re- 
moval of the articles. It was then held by the Attorney-General, in 
resi)()nse to a request of the Secretary of the Interior for his opinion, 
that the provision in the eighth section of the act of the 4th of August, 
1854 (10 St-its., 572), placitig the collections under the control of the 
Commissioner of Patents, and authorizing the employment by him of 
keepers therefor, was designed to be temporary only, and that the act 
establishing the Smithsonian Institution, as well as that making the 
appropriation in 1857, were to be regarded as indicating the purpose of 
Congress respecting permanent provision for these collections. 

In 1858, by the act of the 2d of June (11 Stats., 301), an appropria- 
tion of $4,000 " for the preservation of the collection of the exploring 
and surveying expeditions of the Government" was made as a contin- 
gent expense in the office of the Secretary of the Interior. Tliis ap- 
pears to have been the product of the condition acceded to by the Sec- 
retary of the Interior upon tlie occasion of the removal of the collections 
from the Patent Office to the Smithsonian ; and, pursuing the same 
practice in October, 1858, Professor Henry, your illustrious predecessor, 
requested of the Secretary of the Interior the renewal of the same ap- 
projiriation. Since that time this (jourse appears to have been ]iursued 
without any other reason for its support than this summary narration 
indicates. 

By the seventh section of the act for the establishment of the Smith- 
sonian Institution (9 Stats., 105) the Secretary is directed to discbarge 
the duties of " keeper of the Museum," and authorized, with the con- 
sent of the board, to employ assistants. No power of appointment of 
any of the ofticers who expend the money provided by these annual ap- 
propriations is supposed to exist, or, since the transfer to the Smith- 
sonian, has ever been exercised by any officer of this Department. 

The manner of the appropriation has operated to impose upon the 
disbursing officer of this Department the duties of an auditor and a 
treasurer for this fund, as an officer for whom the Secretary is respon- 
sible. But no authority over the expenditures appears to rest with the 
Secretary of the Interior or at least ever to have been exercised, so that 
any scrutiny supposable has been thatonly of an auditor. Practically the 
disbursement of this appropriation has been made by the officers of the 
Smithsonian Institution, subject to two audits, one by this Department 
and the other by the Treasury, while the disbursing officer of the lu- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 1 1 

terior Departuient acts as the (lislnirsino- officer for tbeSmitlisouiaii, and 
a clerk has been assigned, as I am informed, by the Smithsonian todnty 
in the Interior Depart nieiit to assist the disbursing otficer. 

Obvionsly tliere is nothing in the rehitions between tlie Smithsonian 
and the Interior Department to require the continuance of this state of 
things. The National Jtluseum enjoys now an annual approi)riation of 
a large amount in the various items, not usually less than $ 150,000. In 
the last act the appropriation was of $12,000 for heating, lighting, elec- 
trical, and telephonic service; of $110,000 for the preservation, exhibi- 
tion, and increase of the collections ; and of $40,000 for cases, furniture, 
fixtures, and appliances ; both of the latter items embracing salaries. 
These items indicate not only the considerable proportions which the 
Museum has attained, but that their disbursement should be in the 
hands of those who have ^he government ot the Museum and a direct 
responsibility exacted. 

So tai', then, fiom there apjiearing to be objection, the facts suggest 
to my mind the wisdom and desirability of providing for the National 
Museum directly, and imposing responsibility for the disbursement of 
the ai)propriation immediately upon the officers of that Institution, and 
with accountability to the Treasury, as in other cases. 

The act of July 7, 1884 (23 Stats., 214), was a stej) in the direction 
of this independency of requiring the director of the National Museum 
to report annually to Congress the progress of the Museum during the 
year and its present condition. 

The papers you kindly loaned me are herewith returned. 
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, 

Wm. F. Vilas, 

i^ecrctary. 

Prof. S. P. Langley, 

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 



Department of the Interior, 

^yashin(^ton, Fehniary 20, 1888. 

Sir: Eeplying to your favor of the 10th instant, I beg to say that it 
seems to me that so long as Congress has made the ai)propriation for 
the current year "under the Interior Department" in terms, it is neces- 
sary that it should be expended according to the practice hitherto 
l)revailing; and that, if the same terms of appropriation should be 
continued, it would be with the expectation that the fixed practice of 
disbursement would continue also. It is therefore probably uecessary 
that the language of the appropriation should be changed in order to 
effect the object desired. It may be presumed the accounting officers 
of the Treasury would require it. 

The same observations may be applied to the appropriation for print- 
ing", 1 think it desirable that that should be separately made, so that 
the Smithsonian Institution should be independent, in its use of the 
provisions made by Congress, of this Department, and this Departmeut 
freed of care in resi)ect to it. 
Yours, respectfully, 

WiAi, F, Vilas, 

Secretary. 

Prof. S. P. Langley, 

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 



12 REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 

It was anticipated that wben the wishes of the Eegents were communi- 
cated to tlie Ai)piopriatious Committee of the House, the objection 
might be raised that the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, as 
snch, was not an officer of the Government in the sense that the head 
of an executive department is, and that this might be an obstacle to 
the proposed transfer. 

Such objection was, in fact, made in the committee, and for this rea- 
son the bill as reported from the House committee places the Museum 
appropriation '' under the Secretary'of the Smithsonian Institution as 
director of the IsTational Museum ; " while at the same time this, with the 
other appropriations, is subordinated to the general title "under the 
Smithsonian Institution." 

In regard to the Bureau of Ethnology, the Secretary had already 
represented to the Eegents his desire to see such a modification of the 
wording as might relieve him from the personal responsibility imposed 
by the language of former bills. The change actually introduced by 
the committee consists in making the former words " under the di- 
rection of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution" subordinate 
to the same general title "under the Smithsonian Institution." 

Should the bill as reported pass both houses the disbursements for 
the National Museum will hereafter be made by an officer designated 
by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, duly qualified and 
bonded to the acceptance of the Secretary of the Treasury, whose of- 
fice will be in the Smithsonian building, instead of by the disbursing 
officer of the Dv^partment of the Interior, as heretofore. 

The appropriations for " international exchanges " will also be dis- 
bursed by the same clerk at the Institution, instead of the disbursing 
clerk of the Treasury Department. 

This new arrangement, while adding greatly to the responsibilities 
and cares of the officers of the Institution, will, it is believed, secure 
good results. 

International exchanges. — The regular estimate submitted to Congress 
was as follows: 

For expenses of the system of international exchanges between the 
United States and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, including salaries or compensation of all necessary 
employes, $15,000. 

A revised estimate was submitted to Congress through the Secre- 
tary of the Treasury, on May 31, 1888, asking for $27,050 for the ex- 
changes. 

The House committee declined to recommend the proposed increase. 
It was then laid before the Senate Committee on Appropriations and 
an argument presented in favor of the increase, which induced the com- 
mittee to report an amendment to the sundry civil bill increasing the 
appropriation from $15,000 to $20,000.* 

* See Congressional Record, July 29, 1888, page 7666. 



KEPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 13 

This ainendmeut was adopted by the Senate, rejected by the House, 
aud finally lost in conference committee of the two houses, so that the 
increase of appropriation for exchanges is only $3,000 for the next fis- 
cal year. 

Preservation of collections. — The appropriation asked for this service 
was $150,000. The House committee reported $120,000 ; the Senate 
committee, $125,000, and this latter amount was finally agreed to. 

Furniture and fixtures. — An estimate of $40,000 was submitted, ac- 
cepted by both committees, and passed by Congress. 

Heating and lighting. — The original estimate "for expense of heating, 
lighting, and electrical aud telephonic service for the National Museum," 
was $12,000. This sum was reported by the House Committee on Ap- 
propriations and adopted by Congress without change. 

Armory building. — For several years this building has been occupied 
jointly by the National Museum and the U. S. Fish Commission, the lat- 
ter paying the expenses of its care aud repairs since July 1, 1885. 

The House Committee on Appropriations in reporting the item of 
$120,000, for "preservation of the collection of the National Museum" 
inserted the following clause : " And for the care and custody of the so- 
called Armory building,''^ thus transferring the whole of the building and 
its maintenance to the Museum. 

The Senate Committee on Appropriations, after hearing a statement 
from the U. S. Fish Commissioner,* struck out this clause, aud inserted 
the following under the items for the Fish Commission :t 

Provided, That the building known as the Armory building, Wash- 
ington, District of Columbia, is hereby transferred to the charge of the 
United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries for use as a hatching 
and distributing station and for offices. 

These diverse views were finally reconciled by the conference com- 
mittees, who reported the following, which became a law : " Under the 
U. S. Commission of Fish and FitheriesP 

Provided, That the building known as the Armory building, Wash- 
ington, District of Columbia, shall be occupied as at present, jointly by 
the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries and the National 
Museum. 

North American Etlmology. — The regular estimate for "continuing 
ethnological researches among the American Indians, under the direc- 
tion of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, including salaries 
or compensation of all necessary employes," was $50,000. 

The House Committee on Appropriations, however, only reported 
$40,000, the sum which has been appropriated annually since 1884. 
This sum was accepted by both the House and the Senate, and is the 
amount appropriated. The appropriation is placed in the language of 
former years " under the direction of the Secretary," but at his request 
this with other departments is placed under the general caption "under 
the Smithsonian Institution."

14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Bejwrt of the expenditures to he made to Congress. — The House Com- 
mittee ou Approi)riatious proposed a clause in the sundry civil bill for 
the next fiscal year which was agreed to by Congress and forms part of 
the act (No. 307), which is as follows: 

That the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution shall submit to 
Congress at its next session a detailed statement of the expenditures of 
the fiscal year 188S, underappropriations for "International Exchanges," 
"Xorth American Ethnology," and the "National Museum," and annu- 
ally thereafter a detailed statemeut of expenditures under said appro- 
priations shall be submitted to Congress at the beginning of each reg- 
ular session thereof. 

BUILDINGS. 

Among other matters discussed at the last meeting of the liegeuts 
was the erection of a new Museum building. On this occasion the Re- 
gents tacitly re-afiflrmed their resolution of 188J, recommending to Con- 
gress the enlargement of the National Museum by the erection of a fire- 
proof building ou the southwest corner of the Smithsonian reservation, 
similar in style to the present National Museum ; but on viewing the 
sketch plans, which had been pre[)ared subsequently to the resolution, 
so as to include offices for the Geological Survey, they adde<l au ex- 
pression of their opinion that the new building should be planned ex- 
clusively for Museum purposes. 

It was not at first intended to take action in this matter during the 
present year, but the overcrowded condition of the building, on account 
of which not only the current work but the proper development of the 
collections is greatly impeded, seemed to render immediate action nec- 
essary. A still more urgent need appeared to be the unsatisfactory 
sanitary condition of the new Museum building. A committee, consist- 
ing of Dr. J. 11. Kidder, chairman. Dr. James M. Flint, U. S. Navy, and 
Mr. J. E. Watkins, was appointed on April 14 to make a careful study 
of the water supply, ventilation, and drainage, and in May submitted 
a preliminary report, from which it appeared that an alarming amount 
of sickness and mortality has been manifest among the employes since 
1881 — a mortality which can not be attributed to the location of the 
building, which has sometimes been pronounced unsanitary, since there 
has been no corresponding percentage of ill health in the old Smithson- 
ian building adjoining. The number of days lost by employes ou ac- 
count of sickness in 18S0 was 706; in 1887,875; and in 1888, up to May 
10, 213, by far the largest part of this loss of time being attributed on 
the books of the Museum to miasmatic diseases. The committee states 
that there is no reasonable doubt that some, if not all, of the ten deaths 
since 1881 were hastened or induced by the unwholesome condition of 
this building. The committee suggested repairs and modifications of 
considerable extent, including the construction of continuous cellars 
under each of the four sides of the building, which, in addition to the 
otUer necessary expenses, would cost in the neighborhood of 140,000, 



REPORr OF THE SECRETARY. 15 

This state of affairs seemed to demaad decided action, and it being 
absolutely impossible to make any changes in the present building with- 
out entirely vacating a portion of it for a considerable period of time, 
the exigency for more accommodation seemed a great deal more urgent 
than had been at first supposed. 

AYhile it became evident, on study ot the question, that for the ulti- 
mate needs of the Museum, a building of but one story occupying the 
same area as the present Museum would be insufficient, the question 
of immediate action was unexpectedly brought up in May by one of the 
senior Eegents, a member of the Senate, who, when visitiug the Museum 
with some friends, noticed its crowded and unsatisfactory condition. 
Having learned from me of the mortality and sickness of the employes, 
he inquired as to the feasibility of erecting a new building, and offered 
to use his influence to procure an appropriation, if 1 could obtain for 
him a set of sketch plans within a week, time being, as he stated, a very 
essential condition. After consulting with the chairman of your Exec- 
utive Committee, I had no hesitation in accepting such an offer, but a 
difficulty arose from the fact that the sketch plans which had been laid 
before the Eegents in 1882 were in part for purposes which the Eegents 
had at their last meeting disapproved, and that hence they could not 
be used. By great diligence, however, plans for a building to be de- 
voted exclusively to Museum purposes were prepared within the time 
mentioned. These were based upon an extensive accumulation of 
notes and drawings, embodying the record of the best recent work of 
museiim construction in this country and in Europe, and they were for 
a building, as far as was consistent with these improvements, like the 
existing Museum. The report submitted by Senator Morrill, to accom- 
pany Senate bill 3131, contains the correspondence on which action 
was taken, and I have discussed the acts therein presented elsewhere 
under the proper heads.* 

The following bill was introduced by Senator Morrill on June 12, was 
passed by the Senate on June 20, and at the end of the fiscal year was 
in the hands of the House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds: 

A BILL for tlio erection of iui additioual fire-proof building for the use of the National 

Miiseunj. 

Be it enacted by the ISenate and House of RepresentativcH of the Cnited 
States of America in Congress assembled, Tiuit the sum of five hundred 
thousand dollars is hereby appropriated, out of any money in the Treas- 
ury not otherwise api)ropriated, or so much thereof as may be neces- 
sary, for the erection of a tirei)roof building for the use of the National 
Museum, to cover three hundred feet square, and to consist of two 
stories and basement, to be erected under the direction of the Eegents 
of the Smithsonian Instituti(m, in accordance with the plans now on tile 
with the Committee on Public Buildings and (rrounds, on the south- 
western portion of the grounds of the Smitiisonian Institution. Said 
building to be placed west of the Smithsonian Institution, leaving a 

* iSee museum, etc. 



16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

roadway between it and the latter of not less than forty feet, with the 
north front on a line with the south face of the building of the Agricult- 
ural Department and of the Smithsonian Institution; and all expendi- 
tures for the purpose herein mentioned shall be audited by the proper 
officers of the Treasury Department. 

The building, as proposed, covers the same area as the present 
Museum, and is of the same general style, so far as is consistent with 
the introduction of a second story, thus affording uearly three times as 
much accommodation under the same area of roof as the building now 
iu use. The arrangement of the interior of the proposed new structure 
is, however, considerably modified, as the result of the experience of 
seven years' occupation of the present building. The eighteen exhi- 
bition halls on the two main floors are completely isolated from each 
other, and are capable of subdivision into smaller halls. The lighting 
will be equall}'^ as good as in the present building, the ventilation will 
be much better, and in other important respects the sanitary arrange- 
ments will be far more satisfactory. 

A basement story is absolutely necessary, uot only with a view to 
promoting the comfort and health of visitors and employes, as well as 
for securing greater dryness and better preservation of the specimens, 
but also for the purpose of providing large apartments for store-rooms 
and workshops. These i)roposed improA^ements iu arrangement will 
not, however, interfere with the possibility of constructing a building 
which shall conform in the essential points of exterior proportion with 
the main features ot the present building. 

The present building contains about 80,000 square feet of Hoor space 
available for exhibition and storage. The building proposed will con- 
tain about 220,000 square feet. The amount of room for offices and 
laboratories would be about the same in each. The net area in the new 
building available for exhibition, storage, and office rooms, as esti' 
mated, would be between 5 and" 6 acres. 

For the construction of the present Museum Building an appropria- 
tion of $250,000 was made. This sum w as supplemented by the follow- 
ing special appropriations: $25,000 for steam-heating apparatus, 
$26,000 for marble floors, $12,500 for water and gas fixtures and elec- 
trical apparatus, and $1,900 for special sewer connections. The total 
amount expended on this building was therefore $315,400, and it is 
generally admitted that the cost of its construction was considerably 
less than that of any other similar building in existence; in fact, per- 
haps too cheap to secure the truest economy. 

The proposed structure can be erected at a proportionately smaller 
cost. I have obtained from responsible bidders, who are willing to give 
bonds for the completion of the work in accordance with the bids which 
they have submitted, estimates for the erection of the building com- 
plete, with steam-heating apparatus and all other essential appliances, 
excepting the electrical equipment, amounting in the aggregate to 
$473,000, These bids, upon which tbP estimatf\s of cost have been made^ 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17 

were uot competitive, and it is possible that something may be saved 
tbrougli competition. It is, however, necessary to provide also for the 
architect's superintendence, and for the removal and reconstruction of 
the Smithsonian stable, which now occupies the site. I therefore think 
it advisable to make request for the sum of $500,000, in order that these 
additional items and other contingencies may be covered. 

The plans, though drawn in the limited time imposed, represent the 
results of an exhaustive study — which has extended over several years — 
of plans of the best modern museum buildings in Europe and America, 
nearly all of which have been personally inspected by officers of the 
Smithsonian Institution. 

It will be remembered by the Kegeuts that neither the central por- 
tion of the Smithsonian Building nor the so-called '' chapel," at its west- 
ern extremity, has ever been made fire-proof. The first contains valua- 
ble collections, which are in somewhat menacing neighborhood to the 
paint shop outside and to alcoholic stores within. These ought to be 
provided for separately, but the representations made of the necessity 
have not yet obtained attention from Congress. A special occasion 
having arisen which made it desirable, at any rate, to complete the tire- 
proofing of the " chapel," on the 21st May, at the request of the Sec- 
retary, Hon. J. S. Morrill reported from the Committee on Public 
Buildings the following bill : 

A BILL to provide for making tbo west end of the Smithsonian Building fire-proof, 

and for other purposes. 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Bepresentatwes of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That for the purpose of making 
the roof of the Gothic chapel at the west end of the Smithsonian Build- 
ing fireproof, and for other purposes, under the direction of the Re- 
gents of the Smithsonian Institution, the sum of seventeen thousand 
five hundred dollars, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby 
appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appro- 
priated. 

This bill was adopted without a dissenting vote by the United States 
Senate. 

It was referred in the House May 22, 1888, to the Committee on 
Public Buildings, but no report was made b;>' the committee. The same 
bill was offered in the Senate on the 28th of June by Senator Morrill as 
an amendment reported by the Senate Committee on Public Buildings 
and Grounds to the sundry civil bill. This was referred to the Senate 
Committee on Appropriations, but was not reported back. 

Fire-proofing ivest range of Smithsonian building. — In 1887 Congress 
made an ai)propriation of $15,000 ''for urgent and necessary repairs to 
central and western portions of the Smithsonian Institution."* 

This was expended in removing the combustible material in the west 
range, as this was the most urgent work required. The contents ot

18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

this part of the buildiug, consistiug of the alcoholic collections, were 
very iiiflaiiiiiiable and dangerous. The fire-proofing was intrusted to 
Messrs. Cluss and Schulze, architects, from whose report the following 
account of the work is taken : 

"The reconstruction extended over the curtain between the main 
building and the west wing, a buildiug of GO feet in length and 54 feet 
in width, with an adjoining turret containing stairs. It contaius a 
basement where alcoholic specimens are kept. 

"The main story is mostly occupied by an exhibition hall, extending 
up into the roof, with a clerestory. Along the north front was origi- 
nally an open cloister, which had been, for many years, temporarily fitted 
up, by frame- work, for offices. 

" Permanent provision was made for these purposes, and a mezzanine 
story formed by the insertion of a fire proof upper floor. 

"Besides the old, rotten, combustible floors and roofs, a complicated 
system of decorative hollow columns and vaults, framed of wooden 
scantlings, boards, and lathed jflastering, had to be carefully removed, 
so as not to injure the outside walls, consistiug of a thin cut-stone fac- 
ing, backed by ordinary rubble-work. 

" In the reconstruction the Eomanesque general character of the 
building was preserved with the greatest simplicity compatible with 
the surroundings, and also made a necessity by the limited appropria- 
tion, in conjunction with the increased cost of decorations in fireproof 
materials. 

"The first advertisement for bids for the work was confined to what 
was required for making the reconstructed building ready for occu- 
pancy; and to leave desirable but not absolutely necessary improve- 
ments and internal finishings to any balance left from the appropria- 
tion. 

" Under date of June 27, 1887, an advertisement was issued for the 
wrought and cast iron work, and the award made to C. A. Schneider's 
Sous, of this city, at $1,848, the lowest bid received. 

"On July 6, 1887, another advertisement was issued for cut-stone 
work, brick-work, fire-proofing, metal-roofing, lighter iron-work, corru- 
gated-iron lathing, carpenter's work, plastering, and miscellaneous work.

KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11) 

The east room, used for tlie meetiug of the Kegeiits, has had such 
improvemeuts made iu its ventilation as the defective construction of 
the building in this respect admitted, and I have taken occasion to draw 
on the different departments of the Smithsonian for its furniture, so 
that this may recall iu some measure the various interests under the 
Regents' care. 

RESEARCHES. 

From the fouiuhition of the Institution the promotion of original re- 
search has been regarded as one of its important functions under the 
general provision of Smithson's bequest, and by encouraging and facili- 
tating the discovery of new truths it is obvious that the primary pur- 
pose of the founder — the increase of knowledge — can be most efficiently 
attained. 

Natural science falls into two great divisions, the biological and the 
physical, and since it has been the case that of late years the first of 
these has been almost exclusively encouraged by the Smithsonian, it 
was the desire of the late Secretary, Professor Baird, to do something 
to restore the balance, and with this end iu view he had made prepara- 
tions to secure an astro physical observatory and laboratory, aud though 
these pi*eparations were interrupted by his death it is understood that 
througli his action some friends of the Institution have already offered 
to give the means for the erection of the modest structure needed for 
the accommodation of such a special observatory. The site would nec- 
essarily be suburban, on account of the especial need of seclusion and 
the absence of tremor in the soil, such as is felt in the neighborhood of 
the streets of a city. 

No steps have yet been taken to secure a site, but iu view of the 
promise of means for the buihliug, and the fact that the construction of 
the necessary apparatus will occupy a long time, I have ordered such 
of the essential pieces as are not likely to be ready, even under these 
conditions, till the building is prepared to receive it. With the excep- 
tion of this preparation there has been nothing done for the increase 
of knowledge in the physical branches of science in the past year, but 
it may be remarked that the Institution is in possession of a certain 
amount of philosophical apparatus. This is formed of the debris of its 
first collection (nearly destroyed by the fire) and of a certain few pieces 
purchased by Professor Henry in the later years of his life. 

There are also a number of historical relics, as the philosophical 
instruments used by Dr. Joseph Priestly and others. These were on 
exhibition in the new Museum Building, but the room they occupied 
being wanted for other purposes the collection was transferred to the 
Smithsonian Building where they were placed in an apartment adjoining 
the laboratory. Arrangements are now being uuide for a more suit- 
able depository and for the exhibition to the public of such articles of 
this class as may be of general interest. 

The Institution has continued to give an important impulse to the 



20 REEOKT OF THE SECRETARY. 

l)rosecutiou of the biological scieuces, bat most largely so, iudirectly 
through the Museum aud Bureau of Ethnology. 

The chief research has been under an arrangement made by the 
late Secretary. Prof. E. D, Cope has been engaged during the en- 
tire year in completing and preparing for publication the results of 
an investigation upon the reptiles and batrachians of North America, 
which has been in progress under the direction of the Institution for 
more than twenty years. The first part, consisting of a Monograph on 
the Batrachians, has been handed in and sent to the Public Printer, and 
the work of printing it as one of the bulletins of the National Museum 
has been already begun. 

The expense entailed in the publi(,*ation has been much greater than 
the late Secretary anticipated, but I have felt it proper to continue it, 
not only to carry out a purpose which had engaged the interest of Pro- 
fessor Baird, but on account of the great intrinsic importance and value 
of the work itself. No complete memoir on the Batrachians of North 
America has ever been published ; while the projected work enters 
fully into questions of anatomy and geographical distribution, in addi- 
tion to the customary discussion of classification and synonymy, and 
will supply a long-felt need of biologists not alone in America but 
throughout the world. 

The second part, relating to the Eeptiles, is in progress, and its com- 
pletion is promised during the coming year. 

Important investigations are in progress at the hands of the curators 
and their assistants in every department of the Museum, for which ref- 
erence may be made to that portion of my report. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

Our function in promoting the increase of knowledge has always been 
regarded as including in its scope aud object explorations at distant or 
less familiar localities. Though no special explorations indei)eudeut of 
those already undertaken in connection with the Fish Commission have 
been made during the past year, I am in hearty accord with the policy 
of giving such encouragement to the lines of investigation heretofore 
prosecuted in this respect as may be practicable from the portion of 
our income which can be thus appropriated. 

The activity in exploration this year is not less than heretofore, but 
it has chiefly been carried on by the appropriation for ethnological re- 
searches. This has been placed by law under your Secretary, who has 
continued the arrangement, in some sense inherited from his predeces- 
sors, under which the direction of the expenditure has been left almost 
wholly within the discretion of Maj. J. W. Powell, from the confidence 
felt equally in his scientific acquirements as an ethnologist and his 
known capacity as an administrator. The usual report of the Bureau 
of Ethnology is given elsewhere. 

There has also been a limited amount of exploration carried on in con- 
nection with the Museum. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21 

Mr. Rouiyn ITitcbcock, one of the curators of the Mu.seiiui, has been 
for two years on leave of absence, while perfonuiiig- the duty of profes- 
sor of Euglish at the University Osaka, Japan, and has been assisted 
as far as has been practicable in bis explorations in the west and north 
of the Japanese Archipelago. 

Two of the geological curators have explored numerous mineral locali- 
ties in connection with the work of completing the sets of minerals for 
distribution. Their work is referred to in the report of the Museum. 

Two employes of th% Museum accompanied the Fish Commission 
schooner Grampus on her trip to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, for the pur- 
pose of taking advantage of the opportunity, should any offer, of 
exploring the natural history of the islands of that region, and par- 
ticularly to make search for the remains of the Great Auk. They 
were successful in their efforts, obtaining important collections and 
material for a report which will be presented in connection with the 
work of the Museum. 

At the beginning of the fiscal year Mr. Charles H. Townsend, of the 
TJ. S. Fish Commission, was engaged in the joint service of the Commis- 
sion and the Museum in natural history exploration in Central Amer- 
ica. He returned in October, 1887. 

Ensign A. P. Niblack, 11. S. Navy, (for three years attached to the 
scientific staff of the Museum,) during a cruise upon the coast of Alaska 
made extensive collections and obtained material for a report on the 
ethnology of that region. 

PI'BLICATIONS. 

Classes of publications. — Of the Smithsonian publications, the first 
class — both in priority of introduction and in scientific importance — is 
the quarto series of Contributions to Knowledge. This series, numbering 
twenty-five volumes, was inaugurated forty years ago. 

An early hope had been entertained that the Institution might be 
enabled to issue one volume of the quarto series each year, but it was 
soon discovered that original memoirs of merit, embodying new acquisi- 
tions to our knowledge, could not be procured at any such rate. Partly 
by reason of the rapid growth of scientific institutions in our country, 
and partly by reason of the largely increased endowments of some of 
them, other channels of scientific publication have been opened, and 
there has been a steady reduction both in the number of memoirs pre- 
sented to this Institution for publication and in the numbers of these 
judged deserving of a place in the ranks of the " Contributions." This 
diminution of fertility is perha])s best exhibited by the following table 
of volumes issued during each successive period of ten years: 

During first decade (from 1848 to 1857), nine volumes. 

During second decade (ending 1807), six volumes. 

During third decade (ending 1877), six volumes. 

During fourth decade (ending 1887), four volumes. 



22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

It may be stated that the last volume of tbis series (Volume xxv) was 
issued in 1S85, aud that one memoir of 196 pages, with five chromo- 
lithographic plates, " Eesearches upon the Venoms of Poisonous Ser- 
pents" (by Br. S. \Yeir Mitchell and Dr. Edward T. Reicbert) has since 
been published (188()) as an installment for Volume xxvi. 

The second class of Smithsonian publications is the octavo series of 
Miscellaneous CoUeetions, which was not organized until nearly a quarter 
of a century later than the " Contributions," the first volume having 
been published in 18G2. 

As estimated by the number of volumes published during the period 
of its existence, now amounting to thirty-three, this series (as was to 
have been expected) has grown about twice as rapidly as the former. 

In addition to these two classes of works, published at the expense 
of the Smithsonian fund, three other series of works are issued under 
the direction of the Institution, the publication of which is provided for 
by Congressional appropriations. 

Of these, first in order may be mentioned the Annual Reports to Con- 
gress of the Board of Regents of the Institution, in accordance with the 
provisions of Revised Statutes, section 5593, enacting that the Board 
shall submit to Congress at each session thereof a report of the opera- 
tions, expenditures, and condition of the Institution. These are in 
octavo form, and have gradually increased in bulk from a few hundred 
pages to two thick volumes per annum. Although printed by the Gen- 
eral Government, these reports have been a constant and increasing 
charge upon the funds of the Institution, required by the preparation 
of suitable material for the usual appendix, in illustration of particular 
investigations, or of the principal advances made in science. For a 
number of years past the expenditure for this purpose has amounted to 
several thousand dollars for each year, and it has become a serious 
question whether we can longer afford to bear the burden. If Congress 
can be induced to make a small appropriation for the collection and 
preparation of information relative to the annual progress in the United 
States of scientific discovery, and of its technological appUcations, to 
be appended to the Smithsonian Report, such a record would not only 
be in keeping with the great objects of this Institution, but would main- 
tain for its report its high popular and educational character as well as 
promote the industrial interests of our country, and the trifling expend- 
iture would seem to be well justified by the precedents of similar appro- 
priations for obtaining and diffusing valuable information through the 
medium of the Agricultural and other official reports. 

In the original " programme of organization," a])provedby the Regents 
December 8, 1847, was specified among the details of the plan for diffus- 
ing knowledge " the publication of a series of reports giving an account 
of the new discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to 
year in all branches of knowledge not strictly professional." And it was 
added, ''The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent in the 
different branches of knowledge." 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23 

Tn the Smithsonian Keport for 1854 appeared for the Orst time an "ap- 
pendix," containing- an acconnt of American explorations for the years 
1853 and 1854, by Prof. S. F. Baird ; a full report of lectures delivered 
before the Institution by Marsh, Brainard, Loomis, Channing, Reed, and 
Russell ; extracts from the scientific correspondence of tlie Institution ; 
and miscellaneous papers relating to American archiBology, geology, 
etc. This general ap])endix to the Annual Report of the Regents has 
been regularly continued to the present time (for more than the third of 
a century), and has served to bring the Smithsonian Report into great 
popular demand. 

In the Report for 1880 (alter the abandonment by the publishing 
house — the Harpers, of New York — of an "Annual Record of Science 
and Industry"), a systematic " Record of Scientific Progress," compiled 
by various specialists, vras made the principal feature of the general ap- 
pendix by my predecessor. This annual scientific summary, however 
acceptable and however conformable to the plans originally laid down, 
has labored under two very serious difficulties : First, that from the vex- 
atious delaj' of publication the record of recent science lost much of its 
interest and value; and, secondly, that the expense of its preparation 
(averaging $2,500 per annum) has become more and more a tax upon 
the Smithsonian income that could be but illy afforded. To this may 
be added a practical difficulty in getting all the different summaries 
completed at the time of making up the general appendix, so that au 
omission of one or more branches occurred in every report. Under these 
circumstances, it has become a serious question as to the manner in 
which this appendix to the Report is to be maintained, if maintained 
at all. 

An additional complication of the question may be referred to, arising 
out of the construction given to au act of Congress approved August 
4, 1886, and siuce continued from year to year, which prescribes that 
heads of departments " before transmitting their annual reports to Con- 
gress, the printing of which is chargeable to this appropriation, shall 
cause the same to be carefully examined, and shall exclude therefrom 
all matter including engravings, maps, drawings, and illustrations, ex- 
cept such as they shall certify in their letters transmitting such reports 
to be necessary, and to relate entirely to the transaction of public busi- 
ness." (Statutes, Forty-ninth Congress, first session; chapter 902, 
page 255.) 

This restriction has been held by the Public Printer to apply equally 
to the reports of the Regents to Congress, which are printed under the 
provisions of this appropriation. This consideration seems to furnish 
an additional reason for having the supplementary matter of the report 
placed under a special clause of authorization, for the avoidance of all 
question as to the "necessity and entire relation to the public business" 
of such general scientific information. 

The second series to be mentioned uniler this head consists of the 



24 RErORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

publications of the U.. S. National Museum, comprising its ''BuUetius" 
and its "Proceedings." The Bulletins of the National Museum were 
instituted for the puri)ose of furnishing a proinj)! publication of origi- 
nal descriptions of specimens received, and of thus illustrating the 
mineral, botanical, zoological, and ethnological collections belonging to 
the Museum. They consist of monographs on biological subjects, check- 
lists, taxonomic systems, etc., and are jirepared mainly by the curators 
and other attaches of the establishment. This series was commenced 
in 1875, and now numbers thirty-two Bulletins. These memoirs, from 
their variety of subject, are naturally of very unequal extent, ranging 
from fifty to over one thousand pages. Collected, they form nine large- 
sized octavo volumes. , 

The Proceedings of the National Museum consist of shorter and less 
elaborate papers, designed to give early accounts of its recent acces- 
sions, or of freshly acquired facts relating to natural history, etc., and 
are promptly issued in single " signatures," as soon as matter sufficient 
to fill sixteen pages has been prepared, the date of issue being given 
on each signature. These " Proceedings" thus partake of the character 
of an irregular periodical, the numbers of which — continuously paged — 
form an annual volume. 

This series was commenced in 1878, and now extends to nine annual 
volumes, averaging about 650 pages, and illustrated with numerous 
wood-cut plates. Both these series of publications of the National 
Museum have hitherto been printed at the expense of a fund under the 
authority of the Interior Department; but it is proposed to ask for 
legislation which will permit them to be printed at the Government 
Printing Office on the requisition of your secretary. 

The third and last series to be mentioned comprises the annual re- 
ports of the Bureau of Ethnology, which are large sized volumes of royal 
octavo form, well printed and well illustrated with cuts and lithographic 
plates. These volumes (of which four only have thus far been issued, but 
of which the material for four more awaits the printer) present matter 
of great interest to the anthropologist, and in their ])roduction reflect 
credit upon the scientific staff of the Bureau of Ethnology. 

Distrihution of pubUcations. — Since the diffusion of knowledge, next 
to efforts for its increase, is one of the principal functions and duties of 
the Institution, it would doubtless be desirable if we could offer a copy 
of its works to every "intelligent inquirer specially interested in any 
subject of which some of these volumes might treat. Since, however, 
the Institution can not afford to print, in ordinary cases, more than 
from 1,250 to 1 ,501) copies of one work, three-fourths of which are required 
to be supplied to our regular list of " correspondents," for the mainte- 
nance of our exchange series, it has been found necessary to restrict the 
gratuitous distribution to these, and to hold the small reserve, more 
strictly than in earlier times, for sale to those sufficiently interested to 
purchase them. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25 

The remarks made ou this subject by the first secretary so loug ago 
as 1850, are no less pertiuent to-day : " It must be evident that from the 
small port^^n of the income which can be devoted to this object the 
distribution must be circumscribed. Fifteen hundred copies of each 
memoir have been printed; but this number, though all that the in- 
come could furnish, has not been found sufficient to meet a tenth part 
of the demand. It should be recollected that though these, memoirs 
consist of the results of new investigations of the highest importance to 
the well-being of man in extending the bounds of his knowledge of the 
universe of mind and matter of which he forms a part, yet they are not 
in all cases of such a character as to be immediately appreciated by the 
popular mind, and indeed they are better adapted to instruct the teacher 
than to interest the general reader. They should therefore be dis- 
tributed in such a way as most readily to meet the eye of those who 
will make the best use of them in diffusing a knowledge of their con- 
tents." 

That our present circulation, however, is placed on a liberal basis, 
is sufficiently shown by the published conditions on which we are en- 
abled still to offer them gratuitously. This distribution is made, first, 
to those learned societies of the first class which give to the Institution 
in return complete sets of their own publications. Secondly, to colleges 
of the first class furnishing catalogues of their libraries and students, 
and publications relative to their organization and history. Thirdly, to 
public libraries iu this country having twenty-five thousand volumes. 
Fourthly, they are presented in some cases to still smaller libraries, 
especially if no other copies of the Smithsonian publications are given 
in the same place and a large district would be otherwise unsupplied. 
Lastly, to institutions devoted exclusively to the promotion of particular 
branches of knowledge, such of its publications are given as relate to 
their special objects. 

These rules apply chiefly to distribution in the United States. The 
number sent to foreign countries, under somewhat different conditions, 
is about the same as that distributed in this country. 

Economy of jjuhlication demanded. — In view of the natural expansion 
of the Smithsonian operations with advancing years, with its resources 
fixed to a rigidly measured income which, as I have already observed, 
is itself undergoing a slow depreciation in intrinsic value or actual pur- 
chasing power, it would seem that some curtailment will be necessary 
in the appropriations for preparing and printing the works that may be 
offered. In looking to see in what direction this economy may be 
most advantageously exercised it has seemed to me that a more critical 
supervision over the series of "Miscellaneous Collections" might be 
adopted so as to limit it to works of a more general interest or of 
a higher scientific value. This series already extending (as above 
stated) to thirty-three volumes, has included a number of the Museum 
Bulletins and Proceedings as well as the proceedings of several scieu- 



26 KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

tific societies established in this city. In tbe infancy of the Philosopli- 
ical, the Antiiropological, and the Biological Societies of Washington, 
this form of patronage appeared to be a very proper metlKJd of pro- 
moting the increase and diffusion of knowledge. But now that these 
societies are well established on a permanent basis, with a large mem- 
bership for each, such a support appears to be less required. In like 
manner the publications of the National Museum being provided for by 
a Congressional appropriation, this Institution may well relinquish the 
expense of any reissue of them, while still employing its exchange 
service for the gratuitous transmission of such copies of the " Bulle- 
tins" and "Proceedings" as maybe intrusted to its care. Thus far 
eight volumes of the Miscellaneous Collections have been occupied 
with these issues, to wit: Volumes xiii, xix, xxii, xxiii, and xxiv, 
with the publications of the National Museum; and Volumes xx, 
XXV, and xxxiir, with those of the societies named. I propose to 
discard these from the series in the futurfe and to make such other 
restrictions as may^ seem judicious under present conditions. In con- 
nection with this I have had in mind tlie renewal of an experiment 
made bj^ your first secretary of placing (in certain exceptional cases) 
the excess of copies beyond those regularly distributed, in the hands of 
a publisher. 

With regard to the quarto series of Smithsonian Contributions to 
Knowledge there will probably be no occasion to suggest any change, 
at least for the present. 

THE SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGE SYSTEM. 

The " diffusion of knowledge among men," which, next to its "in- 
crease," is the reason for the existence of this Institution, has been, ever 
since its foundation, largely carried out by means of the exchange sys- 
tem, under which all knowledge, but especially new knowledge, as em- 
bodied in scientific and other literature, is disseminated by the gratu- 
itous efforts of the Smithsonian. 

The system of exchanges, even in its present condition, involved in 
lS8G-'87, the shipping of about ten thousand domestic and over forty 
thousand foreign packages of books, and this has been increased to over 
twelve thousand domestic and sixty-two thousand foreign packages by 
the operations of the past year. 

Before the writer's connection with the Smithsonian Institution he 
had abundant opportunity to know that the regard and confidence in 
which it is held by all scientific men did not prevent a then general rec- 
ognition of the fact that its exchange system did not work the benefits 
contemplated, in that it took a time wliich ordinarily seemed excessive 
to send a package to Europe or to get one in return. 

The writer having been assigned to the charge of exchanges on his 
first connection with the Institution as Assistant Secretary, gave early 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27 

attention to tbis snbject. The result of his investigation appears to 
show that the reproach for dehiy was then well founded, but that the 
blame did not lie at the door of the Institution, which did not, nnd does 
not, possess the means to efticiently fulfill the tnsks now imposed ui)on 
it. He hopes some improvement has already been effected ; but much 
doubtless remains to be done. 

In the early period of the history of the exchang-es nearly all trans- 
portation was slow, but if it took the Smithsonian two or three months 
to send a package to Europe and as much to bring it back, it took the 
private individual the same time. The early steam-ship lines, then or a 
little later, generously aided the Smithsonian plan by giving the ex- 
changes free transportation, a privilege which the Institution has often 
used, but now that rapid transportation is general, does not wish to 
abuse by making a request that such companies should continue to 
transport the whole of its greatly- increased freight without charge. 

There is another reason why they should not be requested to do so 
in the fact that the character of the freight the exchange department 
sends has changed, as the greater part of it is now the property of the 
nation, and if the General Government desires this to go by rapid transit, 
it is certainly able to pay for it. As Congress does not pay for rapid 
transit, it is a reasonable conclusion that it does not desire it, but it 
may be doubted whether either the extent of the actual use of the 
Smithsonian exchanges by the Government or the degree of delay of 
governmental business is understood. 

To bring the facts in the case to mind let me recall, first, that the 
original exchange system commenced in 1.S46, and, second, that after 
twenty years of useful work exclusively in the interests of knowledge, 
an entirely new duty was imposed upon it by the act of March, 1867, 
which established the International Exchange of Government Publica- 
tions and made the Smithsonian Institution the agency for this ex- 
change, giving it for distribution 50 copies of all documents printed 
by order of eillier house of Congress, 50 additional copies of all docu- 
ments printed in excess of the usual number, together with 50 of each 
publication issued by any Department or Bureau of the Government; 
while the resolution of July 25, 1808, makes it obligatory upon the De- 
partments to furnish 50 copies of each i)ublication issued by them, 
wherever printed. 

Accordingly, of late j^ears, there has been added to the primitive 
Smithsonian exchange system and merged with it the additional feature 
of carrying the Government's exchanges. 

The Institution possessed unequaled experience and facilities for 
such work, and though the new class of books brought to its exchange 
department was partly foreign to its original object, the propriety ot 
its assuming such a service, if the Government's interests could be pro- 
moted b^' this experience, is evident. It certainly, however, was not 



28 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 



to have beeu anticipated that tlie Institution sliould conduct a purely 
administrative work for the General Government out of its private 
funds, as it appears to have done for thirteen years from 1868 to 1881, 
when the first appropriation of $3,000 was made by Congress.* If we 
look back to the commencement of the Government system we find that 
up to 1880, inclusive, the Smithsonian had paid $92,386.29 for exchanges, 
of which it is estimated that more than two-thirds were on Government 
account, for which the Government paid nothing whatever. Subse- 
quently to 1880, as the foot-note more exactly shows, tbe service has cost 
$96,005.85, for which the Government has paid $57,500, leaving nearly 
$30,000 of the cost to be borne by the Smithsonian Institution, and this 
exclusive of the rent of the rooms, which represents about $3,000 a 
year more. 

All exchanges are now conducted by Government, but here "Govern- 
mental" signifies all publications received from or for any bureau or office 
of this or any Government, and "Miscellaneous" all others.! 

It would appear that there is no doubt that in the intent of Congress, 
as expressed in the act of 1881, these appropriations should now be ap- 
plied indifterently to all exchanges, whether to those which it under- 
takes for the Congressional publications, for those of governmental 
bureaus, or for other literary and scientific objects ; but the amount as-

t Under tlie classification wliicli has prevailed heretofore tbe publications passing 
through the exchange office have been divided into "official" and "literary and 
scientific," meaning by the former designation only the publications furnished by 
the Public Printer for distribution among the national libraries of the Governments 
participating in the international exchanges, and including in the latter all of the 
publications sent or received by the bureaus of this Government in direct ex- 
change with the bureaus of others, and for the benefit of the bureau libraries. The 
classification appears to be misleading, since this latter subdivision of the exchanges 
is(iiiite as strictly official, or for the service of the Government, as the former. I 
have therefore directed that hereafter all publications issued or received by the Gov- 
ernment, whether by legislative, .judicial, or Executive authority, shall be desig- 
nated as "Government.al," and all others as "Miscellaneous." 



EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29 

signed is inadequate for the proper conduct even of the former, as has 
just been shown.* 

Having- been assigned to the charge of the international exchanges 
when Assistant Secretary, the writer has always taken particular inter- 
est in this part of the work of the Institution ; but so far as its success 
depends upon the provision by Congress of the indispensable means to 
meet the expenses which it has just been shown tbat the Government 
connection has made needful, his labors have been but jjartially suc- 
cessful. The department of exchanges, however, has continued to be 
the object of more than usual attention, first under the immediate care 
of the writer, and later under that of Dr, J. H. Kidder, appointed cura- 
tor of laborator}^ and exchanges on the 19th of March, 1888. 

It has been remarked that the present system is unsatisfactory because 
of the delay involved, while it will shortly be shown that the expenses 
of shipment by a prompt and efficiently conducted system would be sub- 
stantially the same per ton of freight asH^y the present inefficient and slow 
one, which is largely carried on by what might be called the charity of 
the transportation lines. Unsatisfactory as is the service, however, and 
necessarily conducted as it is (under the present appropriations) in a 
manner prejudicial to every interest concerned with it, these appropria- 
tions do not, as we have seen, meet all the inevitable expenditures, and 
the deficiency still continues to be met from the proper funds of the 
Institution. 

The expense for the service for this fiscal year has been $15,113.75, 
of which sum $12,000 were voted by Congress and $205.75 were re- 
funded by the Patent Office, Signal Office, and a correspondent in 
South America, leaving a net deficit of $2,908, paid by the Smithsonian 
fund. In the coming fiscal year, at the present rate of expenditure, 
the cost will be $16,050, making no allowance for the usual annual in- 
crease in the (luantity of business or for increased salaries of employes. 
The domestic exchanges, it will be understood, form no part of this 
estimate. Finally, it should be stated that nearly every department of 
the Government has some small appropriation to partially cover serv- 
ices which should be gratuitoush' rendered. 

Kecurring now to one of the effects of this insufficient appropriation, 
the writer repeats that there are too many and too great delays in the 
transit of packages sent by the international exchanges. These delays 
do not occur in the office at Washington, nor in those of the agents of 
the Institution at London and Leipzig. They are due, broadly speak- 
ing, to the fact just stated that the Institution has not the means to 



* The act approved iu 138-2 reads, " For expenses of the international exchanges be- 
t^'een the United States and foreign countries, iu accordance with the Paris conven. 
tiou of 1877; " aud this wording is repeated in 1883. Although the phrase referring 
to the Paris convention was afterwards dropped from the law, there seems to bo no 
doubt that it has tixed its meaning, since tin; point has been raised more than once 
by the accounting ollicers of the Treasury, aud so decided. 



30 EEPOKT OF THE WECKETARY. 

pay for rapid transit on laud or sea, and that for what it obtains on the 
latter it is dependent upon the courtesy of several ocean steam-ship 
companies, Nvith the natural result that the free freight is often delayed 
to make room for that which is paid for.* A subordinate cause, how- 
ever, lies in the apathy or indifference, or possible insufficient clerical 
force, of most of the foreign-exchange bureaus. 

In a recent test case parcels shipped on the same day to London, 
Leipzig, and Paris, with letters requesting immediate notification of 
receipt, were acknowledged by the agents of thfe Institution at London 
on the fourteenth day, at Leipzig on the fifteenth, and by the Bureau 
des lilchanges at Paris on the fortieth day. 

In the hope of insuring a regular and certain ocean-steamer service, 
I requested, on the 30th of May last, through the honorable Secretary 
of the Treasury, an increase in the approi)riation for the fiscal year 
1888-89 to $27,050, based upon a careful consideration of the cost of 
"fast freight" at the ordinary commercial rates and upon the quantity 
of material which past experience has made probable. 

The following brief statement wil give the essential facts on which 
the application was based. 

It should be premised that only about one-third of the Government's 
publications are actually received from the office of the Public Printer 
and elsewhere, for transmission abroad, and that while special appli- 
cation on our part might call out the remainder, we can not under- 
take to do this while only partly paid the actual outlay for the portion 
we carry already, while a sufficient appropriation to justify the employ- 
ment of a special exchange agent in Europe, as has been frequently and 
earnestly recommended by the Librarian of Congress, would bring back 
in return probably about eight times what we now receive. Accord- 
ingly, in the subjoined estimate of what should be done, if Congress 
paid the actual cost of efficient service (the services of the officers of 
this Institution being given without charge), more packages appear 
under the new plan than under the old. 

*A shipment sent from Rome in December, 1887, for example, lay at Naples until 
the latter part of March, 1888, before the steam-ship company forwarded it.

July 29, 1888, page 7666, and contains the leading facts in a succinct 
form : 

^^International Exchanges. — Present system established by resolution 
of Congress approved March 2, 1867, and by subsequent legislation. 
Fifty copies of all Government imblications put at disposal of Commit- 
tee on Library for international exchange. 

Uniform system agreed upon at international geographical conference, 
Paris, 1875, and modified by conferences for this particular purpose at 
Brussels in 1880, 1883, and 1886. Treaty now before Senate is the re- 
sult of these conferences. There is now no comi)leted treaty obligation. 
England, Germany, and France have declined to ratify the treaty, and 
were not represented at the last conference. 

The Smithsonian is not concerned with the system otherwise than as 
the agent of the Government, but has paid a material part of the cost 
annually from its private fund. 

As the oflBce is now organized the annual expeiiditure is at the fol- 
lowing rates : 

Pay-rolls, $965 per month $11,580 

Foreign agents 1,500 

Boxes, freight, etc., estimated 3, 000

addition to the proper personnel of this institution, the services of whose officers are 
given without charge. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33 

This means ' slow ' freight, and for the most part gratuitous, on the 
ocean. The average time for transmission of a parcel to western Europe 
is now thirty-six days. By ordinary fast freight it could be reduced to 
sixteen days. Extraordinary delays occur frequently because of the 
fact that the freight is carried gratuitously. Boxes ship[)ed from Kome, 
for example, in December last were held in Naples three months by the 
steam ship line because its steamer's space was all filled by paying 
freight. The same thing has occurred frequently on this side of the 
ocean. As at present organized, the Smithsonian sends out about one- 
third of the United States Government publications, and receives from 
foreign governments less than one-tenth of their otiicial publications. 
Very much is thus lost which is of great interest and value to our Gov- 
ernment offices. 

Many of the Executive Departments which wish to use the exchange 
system are obliged to adopt other measures at considerably increased 
cost. Some of them have special appropriations to defray part of the 
cost of special transmissions by the Smithsonian. 

The sum estimated for ($27,050), is the result of careful calculation, 
based upon a comparison of the details of the business for several years 
back. It is the Secretary's opinion that it will far more than repay it- 
self by an increased efficiency in the service and by the number of val- 
uable works whicli it will bring to Congress and the Executive Depart- 
ments of the Government." 

I am aware that it hardly lies within the power of the Eegents as a 
body to correct the evils I have referred to, but I present this summary 
and imperfect statement of them, in the hoi)e that those of the Eegents 
who are legislators will perhaps be able and willing, in their individual 
capacity, to do something to remedy the state of things which I have 
just shown to be actually existiug. 

I have represented a wearisome and trying matter very briefly. For 
a statement more at large of the actual condition of the exchanges, I 
beg to refer to the valuable report made to the Secretary b}^ the»curator 
of exchanges, which will be found in the appendix. 

Preparation of new exchange lists. — In March, 1887, the writer, then 
Assistant Secretary, acting under the general instructions of the Secre- 
tary, Professor Baird, with a view to perfecting the collections of the 
Smithsonian Library so that thej' might include scientific periodicals 
j)ublished throughout the world, where these were obtainable by ex- 
change, undertook to ascertain as far as possible the names of all useful 
(particularly of all modern) publications which were not on the old 
Smithsonian lists. 

To do this it was necessary to get information not existing in print, 
and as the search for the names of desired publications was necessarily 
im an extended scale, it seemed proper to enlist as many expert coad- 
jutors as possible. To this end the principal branches of human 
knowledge to the number of thirty were indexed on as many separate 
lists. Several copies were made of eacli list, and then it was sought, 
by sending a copy of each to an eminent specialist in the branch in 

n. Mis. 142 3 



34 EEPORT OF THE .SECKETAKY. 

question, to enlist liis services as n coadjutor by obtiiining- from him 
a list of the publications not actually on our records which would be 
most desirable in his own department. 

Medicine was omitted, but Belles Lettres, History, Law, Fine Arts, 
and, in fact, Theology are evidently to be considered even in a purely 
scientific list, at least so far as they illustrate anthropology. 

Periodicals devoted to science in its more restricted interpretation 
generally fall under one of two great divisions : 

First, those connected with the biological, and second, those connected 
with the physical, sciences. 

As the former are represented by many distinguished specialists 
connected with the Smithsonian Institution as curators in the Museum 
there was at first ])repare.d a circular letter (Appendix IV) to these bio- 
logical curators, requesting them to furnish — 

(1) ''A list of those periodicals, whether transactions of societies or 
otherwise, which were deemed most nearly indispensable to their re- 
spective departments ; " and 

(2) "A list of recent serials, whether transactions or otherwise, of 
interest in connection with the special investigations of the curators? 
even if not exclusively devoted to them. " 

Pending the replies, which related almost altogether to biology, the 
writer himself prepared a list of the main divisions and subdivisions of 
physical science meant, with the preceding exceptions, to represent 
every department of knowledge outside of the biological sciences. 

This list was submitted in April to Professors F. A. P. Barnard, 
Samuel H. Scudder, and H. Carrington Bolton, with the requests — 

First. "To examine the list and see whether these headings them- 
selves are judiciously chosen ; " and 

Next. "To indicate the names of the two most fitting j^ersons, under 
each head, to give 'advice as to the periodicals belonging to their re- 
spective departments." The list was also submitted to the Hon. A. R. 
Spofford, Librarian of Congress, and Mr. William J. Rhees, the Chief 
Clerk of the Smithsonian Institution. 

A full list of the names of eminent specialists who could advise in each 
branch having been thus obtained, and the classification of subjects 
having been determined in the manner above indicated, circular letters 
(in three forms) were forwarded on the 9th of May, 1887. A third or 
supplementary circular (in two forms) was mailed on the 15th of June, 
1887. One of these, which willi ndicate the general character of all, is 
given in Ai^pendix IV. 

The circular letter of March 19, sent to twenty-six curators of the Na- 
tional Museum, was responded to by twenty-two curators, among whom 
Prof. L. F. Ward was pre-eminent for the extent and character of the 
lists of periodicals specified {:V}tl lilies). 

Of the circulars of May 9 and June 15, 1887, 274 copies were sent out

deducting those found on more than one list, 3,5*J4: independent titles 
remain ; but of these, as will appear, a considerable portion was on our 
list already. It may be interesting, however, to notice how these titles 
are distributed throughout the world, the little tables in the footnote* 
giving incidentally an interesting exposition of the activities of different 
peoples as well as of different professions in this direction.

articles) are foimd to reach the enormous iminber of 3,594:; and yet 
these by no means comprise, as it will be seen, all that the Smithsonian 
lists contain. 

Five thousand seven hundred and thirty names were in fact received, 
but many of these were duplicates, after striking out which, 3,504: titles 
remain, and a careful investigation by Mr. Boehmer, then in charge of 
exchanges, shows that of these, 2,328 were foreign, and 1,2G0 were 
domestic • and that of the foreign titles but 792 were on our old lists. 
As regards these latter, then, the iinal result of the inquiry is the nearly 
trebling of our foreign lists by adding to them 1,53G new titles (con- 
sisting largely of periodicals begun in the past twelve or fifteen years), 
and this list will be used by the library in obtaining, so far as possible, 
the periodicals themselves. 

LIBRARY. 

Chiefly through its exchange system, the Smithsonian had in 1865 
accumulated about forty thousand volumes, largely publications of 
learned societies, containing the record of the actual progress of the 
world in all that pertains to the mental and physical development of 
the human familj^, and affording the means of tracing the history of at 
least every branch of positive science since the days of revival of let- 
ters until the present time.* 

These books, in many cases presents from old European libraries, 
and not to be obtained by purchase, formed even then one of the best 
collections of the kind in the world. 

The danger incurred from the fire of that year, and the fact that the 
greater portion of these volumes, being unbound and crowded into in- 
sufficient space, could not be readily consulted, while the expense to 
be incurred for this binding, enlarged room, and other purposes con- 
nected with their use threatened to grow beyond the means of the In- 
stitution, appear to have been the moving causes which determined the 
Eegents to accept an arrangement by which Congress was to place the 
Smithsonian Library with its own in the Capitol, subject to the right of 
the liegents to withdraw tiie books on paying the charges of binding, 
etc. Owing to the same causes (which have affected the Library of 
Congress itself) these principal conditions, except as regards their 
custody in a fire proof building, have never been fulfilled. 

The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though they 
have now accumulated from 40,000 to fully 250,000 volumes and parts 
of volumes, and form without doubt the nu)st valuable collection of the 
kind in existence, they not only remain unbound, but in a far more 
crowded and inaccessible condition than they were before the transfer. 
It is hardly necessary to add that these facts are deplored by no one 
more than by the present efficient Librarian of Congress, who would. I 
am confident, gladly give, as far as it lies in his power, effect to any ex-

38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

pressioii of the wish of the Regents that in the new buikliug a hall or 
balls worthy of this really magnificent collection of a quarter of a mill- 
ion titles should be exclusively devoted to it, under the name of the 
" Smithsonian Halls", or in any such other method as may point it out 
as an acquisition of national importance due to the Institution under 
the Eegents' care. 

It will be remembered that a small portion of these volumes, repre- 
senting in number something like one-twentieth of the whole, is ordi- 
narily retained for consultation in the ^National Museum. 

A certain limited number of books, chietiy of works of reference, 
obtained by purchase from the Smithsonian fund, is kept in the Smitli- 
sonian building, under the titles of "The Secretary's Library" and 
" Editor's Library." 

With these exceptions, it will be understood that a large part of the 
Smithsonian exchange system, and a considerable portion of the best 
rooms in the main building of the Smithsonian, continue to be given to 
this portion of the Library of Congress without any return. 

On April 1, 1887, upon the resignation of Miss J. A. Turner, who had 
for many years performed the duties of librarian with the greatest dili- 
gence and faithfulness, the provisions for the care of the books supplied 
to the Congressional Library were reorganized under the regulations 
which I had prepared upon my appointment as assistant secretary.* 
Mr. John Murdoch, formerly assistant librarian in the National Mu- 
seum, was appointed librarian in Miss Turner's place, and was also 
given the charge of the collection of books kept in the Museum as a 
working library for the use of the curators and other officers. 

A force of three clerks was detailed to report to the librarian, in 
order to enable him to carry out the new regulations, which require 
greater j^roraptness in disposing of accessions than it was possible to 
effect when one person alone was emi^loyed on this work. All acces 
sions received during any week must now be completely recorded and 
ready for a final disposition to be made of them on the Saturday of the 
same week. All accessions, as heretofore, except the comparatively 
few retained for use at the Institution, and certain medical publications 
which are specially loaned to the library of the Surgeon-General's Oflice, 
U. S. Army, are sent to the Library of Congress. 

Publications retained for the use of the Institution must, under the 
regulations, be entered and ready for use within twenty-four hours 
from the time they are received. 

A "full entry" of any publication, according to the regulations, is 
" to consist of both a day-book and a ledger account entry." 

The day book is simply a continuation of the old Smithsonian record 
of accessions, in which the running numbers reached on June 30,1888, 
182,050. The ledger account is supi^lementary to the manuscript cata- 
logue in thirteen large bound volumes, called "Publications of Learned

Societies, Periodicals, eh',, ill tlir Lihraiy of tlic Sinitlisoiiian Iiistitu 
tiou," wliidi was complclc up to April I, lb.S7. TIk' new record is Uei)t 
on large cards, one tor each institution or iiulividual from whom the In- 
stitution has received any publication, and on each card is entered the 
title of everything- received from the person or institution whose name 
ap[)ears at the head of tlie card, eacli marked witli its accession or 
"day book" number, by means of which reference can be made to the 
"day-book" for furtlier particuhirs. These (;ards are now arranged 
alphabetically by the name of the donor's residence. 

These regulations have been carried out without failure since the re- 
organization of the library, though tliere have been weeks when, owing 
to the arrival of large invoices through the department of foreign ex- 
changes, the librarian and his clerks have been hard pressed to com- 
plete the work in the time specified. Upwards of five hundred acces- 
sions have been recorded in a single week. 

The books destined for the Library of Congress are sent regularly on 
Monday of each week, and it is impossible for publications to be/lelayed 
at the Institution for the length of time which was frequently unavoid- 
able under the former arrangements. It is, however, to be regretted 
that the Librarian of Congress is unable to take advantage of the in- 
creased promptness of the Smithsonian library administration. Owing, 
as I am informed, to the pressure of co])yright work and the oxer- 
crowded condition of the present quarters of the Library, the chests 
sent up from the Institution frequently lie for mouths unopened, so that 
their contents are inaccessible to readers. 

This is the more to be regretted as, on account of the limited space 
at the disposal of the Institution for keeping books and periodicals, only 
the most important publications can be retained for use liere. 

The books thus retained for use at the Institution form part of the 
National Museum library (the rest of which consists of such publica- 
tions as are donated directly to the Museum or purchased from the 
Museum appropriation for the use of its curators), and are loaned under 
certain necessary conditions to the officers of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion, the Smithsonian editor, the scientific staff of the Museum, and 
such i)ersons as are authorized to borrow books by special written per- 
mission from one of the officers of the Smithsonian Institution. 

llow important these contributions from the Smithsonian accessions 
are to the Museum library may be seen from the fact that out of the 
G,0:i3 accessions to the Museum library (including parts of regular 
serials) during the fiscal year, 3,015, or a trifie more than 50 per cent., 
were from this source. 

From lack of .space in the Museum library it had been jiractlcally 
impossible to provide for the proper display of new accessions to the 
library, and especially of the current numbers of periodicals. At my 
direction, therefore, the iibrari.in prepared plans for a reading-room in 
the Smithsoniiui liuilding. This room was opened to readers in the- 



40 REPORT OP THE SECRETARY. 

latter part of April, 1887, and has remained in active use since then 
It now contains the cnrrent numbers of two hundred and sixty live se- 
rials, embracing most of the chief scientitic and technical publications, 
and including also a few of the more important literary periodicals. It 
is much used by the employes of the Smithsonian Institution and the 
Museum; and to a less degree by other persons in Washington who 
wish to consult the scientific periodicals. Such a scientific reading- 
room has long been needed at the Institution, and the one now in opera- 
tion ai)pears to fill the want satisfactorily. 

The i)olicy that has been pursued in regard to the library has been, 
in general, to obtain as large and as valuable a return as possible for 
the works published by the Institution, and to make the best possible 
use of these returns when they are received. With this end in view, 
the librarian has been instructed to watch for all opportunities of ob- 
taining new publications by exchange and to bring to my knowledge 
every occasion of this kind. The results of this increased activity in 
seeking new exchanges are to be seen in the fact that for the fiscal year 
1887-'88 the total number of accessions amounted to 18,948, an increase 
of 2,401 over the total number for the preceding fiscal year (1886-'87), 
which was 16,547. 

As has been previously stated, 3,045 of these accessions have been 
transferred to the Museum library, and, in addition to these, G75 med- 
ical dissertations have been loaned to the library of the Surgeon-Gen- 
eral's Office, U. S. Army. The remainder, 15,228 in number, have been 
transferred to the Library of Congress. It is impossible, as it seems to 
me, not to consider this as an ample return for whatever expense the 
Library of Congress is put to in paying for the recording of these acces- 
sions. 

The following is a statement of the books, maps, andcliarts received 
by the Smithsonian Institution from July 1, 1887, to June 30, 1888 :

ZOOLOGICAL PARK. 

Collections of living Animals. — It has been customary, ever since the 
Institution commenced to form collections, that skeletons and skins of 
wild animals should be sent here for preparation, so that a certain reg- 
ular supply of such material now comes in without solicitation every 
year, together with occasional live animals, which have been usually 
sent to the Zoological Gardens in Philadelphia. It seemed to me worth 
while to try the experiment of having all animals sent on alive when 
this could be done without enhanced cost; and thus has been formed 
the nucleus of a collection of living animals, which, though still small, 
has attracted the popular interest in a very marked degree. 

It is understood that this interest, and the consideration that the 
buffalo, the mountain sheep and goat, the elk, and other vanishing races 
of the continent deserve protection at the hands of the Government, 
was the cause of a bill which was introduced by Senator Beck to create 
a Zoological Garden on Rock Creek, such that these animals might not 
only form the subject of study, but be expected to increase as they do 
not do in,ordinary captivity. 

I present herewith the amendment to the sundry civil appropriation 
bill reported by Senator Morrill, of the Committee on Public Buildings

and Grounds, June 4, 1888, Tlii.s is identical with the bill proposed l>y 
Senator Beck April 23, 1888 (S. 2752), which was read twice and re- 
ferred to the Committee on Public Buildiugs and Grounds with the ad- 
ditions of the paragraphs inclosed in brackets. 

This establishment it is proposed, when completed, to place under 
the care of the Kegents, with a proper provision for its maintenance. 
The bill has not yet become a law, but in the event of its doing so, the 
trust created, being in the interest of knowledge, and incidentally ofler- 
ing a most obvious means for its popular diffusion, seems to be one which 
falls entirely within the proper function of the Smithsonian Institution, 
and I hope I may be able to state that the trust is one of a nature which 
the Eegents, if called upon, are likely to favor. 

[A BILL for the establishmeut of a zoological park in the District of Columbia.] 

That, in order to establish a Zoological Park in the District of Colum- 
bia, for the advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of 
the people, a commission shall be constituted, composed of three persons, 
namely: the Secretary of the Interior, the president of the board of 
Commissioners of the District of Columbia, and the Secretary of the 
Smithsonian Institution, which shall be known and designated as the 
commission for the establishaient of a zoological park. 

That the said commission is hereby authorized and directed to make 
an inspection of the country along Eock Creek, beginning at the point 
on that creek where the Woodley road crosses said creek, and extend- 
ing upward along its course to where said creek is crossed by the 
Klingle road, and to select from that district of country such a tract of 
land, of not more than one hundred acres, which shall include a section 
of the creek, as said commission shall deem to be suitable and appro- 
priate for a zoological park. 

That the said commission shall cause to be made a careful map of said 
zoological park, showing the location, quantity, and character of each 
parcel of private property to be taken for such purpose, with the names 
of the respective owners inscribed thereon, and the said ma]) shall be 
filed and recorded in the public records of the District of Columbia; 
and from and after that date the several tracts and i)arcels of land em- 
braced in such zoological park shall be held as condemned for j)ublic 
uses, subject to the payment of just compensation, to be determined by 
the said commission and approved by the President of the L'nited 
States, provided that such compensation be accepted by the owner or 
owners of the several parcels of land. 

That if the said commission shall be unable to purchase any portion 
of the land so selected and condemned within thirty days after such 
condemnation, by agreement with the respective owners, at the price 
approved by the President of the Cnited States, it shall, at the expira- 
tion of such period of thirty days, make application to the Supreme 
Court of the District of Columbia, by petition, at a general or special 
term, for an assessment of the value of such land, and said petition shall 
contain a particular descrijition of the property selected and condemned, 
with the name of the owner or owners thereof, and his, her, or their 
residences, as far as the same can be ascertained, together with a copy 
of the recorded map of the park; and the said Court is hereby author- 
ized and required, u[)()n such applictation, without <lelay, to notify the 
owners and occupants of the land and to ascertain and assess the value 



44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

of tbe land so selected aiid condemned by appointing' three commis- 
sioners to appraise the valne or values thereof, and to return the ap- 
praisement to the Court, and when tlie values of such land arc thus 
asceitained, said values shall be paid to tlie owner or owners, and the 
United States shall be deemed to have a valid title to said lands. 

That when the said commission shall have obtained the land for a 
zoological park, as herein provided, it shall have power to lay out the 
same as a park and to erect such building or buildings thereon as may 
be necessary for the scientific purposes to which the jiark is dedicated 
and proper, for the custody, care, and exhibition of a collection of ani- 
mals. 

That when the said commission shall have established a zoological 
park m the District of Columbia uiuler the provisions of this act, by ac- 
quiring the necessary lands and by laying out the same as a park and 
by the erection of the necessary buildings, thereupon it shall be the 
duty of said commission to turn over the said zoological park, with all 
its buildings and appurtenances, to the custody and care of the Regents 
of the Smithsonian Institution ; and when such transfer of the custody 
and care of the zoological park shall be made, the duties of said com- 
mission shall cease and its existence terminate. 

That when the said commission shall tender to the Regents of the 
Smithsonian Institution the care and custody of the zoological park pro- 
vided for in this act, the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are 
hereby authorized to assume the care and custody of the same; and 
the said Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are hereby authorized 
to make such rules and regulations for the management of the park, 
and of the i)roperty, appurtenances, and collections of the park, as they 
may deem necessary and wise to secure the use of the same for the ad- 
vancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the peo])le. 

[That the said commission is hereby authorized to call upon the Di- 
rector of the Geological Survey to make such surveys as may be neces- 
sary to carry into ettect the provisions of this act; and the Director of 
the Geological Survey is hereby authorized aiul required to make such 
surveys under the direction of said commission.] 

I will take this occasion to observe that we have found great liberal- 
ity in the donors of specimens. Among those to whom we are esjjecially 
indebted is the Hon. Eugene G. Blackford, commissioner of tisheries 
for the State of New York, and an old and valued supporter of the 
work of the Institution, who has presented us with two buffaloes, an 
animal now become so rare as to have a high money value. 

The proposition for the establishment of a National Zoological Park 
has met with a very surprising amount of sui)port from all parts of the 
United States.* ' 

*The followlug extract from "Public Opinion" will serve to give somewhat of an 
idea of tlie character and extent of this support: 

[Public Opinion, New York.] 

The National Zoological rark.— Of all the bills that have been introduced in Con- 
gress this session, no other has been more universally approved by the press than 
Senator Beck's bill for the establishineut of a National Zoological Park at Washing- 
ton, on a grand and lil^eral scale, " for th(3 advancement of science and the instruc- 
tion and recreation of the people." With all our great game animals being swept 
out of existence by modern breech-loaders, a magnificent site within 2 miles of the

ART AND MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS. 

Art collections. — The words of your first secretary, that the Iiistitutfoii 
exists for knowledge iu the highest sense, iucltidiug not only science 
commonly so called, bUt "the ti-iie, the beatltiilllj as Well as the immedi- 
ately practical," remind us that one of the lines on which the Institiltloil 
was to develop according to the views of Congress, that of its connec- 
tion with art, has been allowed almost entirely to lapse. It is now, liow- 
ever, understood that a very valuable collection of art objects, repre- 
senting, perhaps, over $1,000,000 in value, has been left to the Smith- 
sonian Institution ; and it is not an abstract question when we ask 
what these relations are to be. It seems to me that here again'the fact 
of the independence of the Smithsonian is of inestimable value in its 
possible future usefulness. No possessor of a great private gallery like 
either of the two or three in this country which are rising now to al- 
most national importance— no possessor of such a gallery, knowing on 
the one hand What art is and on the other hand what the relatiDus of 
the (jovernment to art have been in the past, is likely to bequeath it 
to the nation without some guaranty, not only for its care and mainte- 
nance, but for its judicious use iu the cause of national art itself. 

the Smitlisoiiiau, the pubiio clamoring for a National " Zoo," and a competent natu- 
ralist ready and anxious to build it up, what reason is there why the bill should not 
be passed and work begun at 'once ? If it is neglected much longer some of our 
gramlcst game species will have become so nearly extinct it will be almost, if not 
quite, impossible to procure living representatives of them at any price. At the rate 
mountain goats are now being killed off for their pelts five years hence it will be im- 
possible to procure a living specimen. A live buffalo is now worth from $500 to 
$1,000, according tc sex and size, whereas three or four years ago they were worth 
only one-fifth as much. As an index to public sentiment in regard to the proposed zo- 
oh)gi3al pjS-k at Washington, we may quote a few editorial exi)ressions from our ex- 
changes. It IS interesting to note the unanimity of the opinions that come to us iu 
journals of all kinds and parties, from Boston to San Francisco. The Boston Globe 
exclaims : " Give us a National Zoo. Senator Beck has introduced a bill of great in- 
terest to the people of the United States, conoerning which there can be no partisan 
difference of opinion, and which ought to be passed. This is the only great nation 
in the world which does not possess such an institution, and it is the one of all others 
Avhich needs it most. A national museum of living animals would be one of the 
leading attractions of Washington, and would show the citizen and foreign visitor at 
a glance the animals of this country as they could never bo seen otherwise. By all 
means let this country have a National ' Zoo.' Senator Beck's bill ought to pass." 
The Pittsburgh Dispatch declares that the bill "should meet with the hearty in- 
dorsement it deserves. That a iiatiou so far in advance in the march of progress as 
the United States should be entirely without some such institution under Gov- 
ernment protection seems almost incredible." The New York Forest and Stream 
asserts that " the importance of preserving living North American mammals can 
hardly be overestimated. The buffalo is practically extinct, and the range of the 
elk has become so contracted in the last few years that it is apparent the same 
fate awaits that noble species. There are others that will survive longer, but the 
people at large, know nothing, and never can know, about them, unless they sh.ill be 
brought close to their homes. All these animals should be secured before it is too 
late." The Chicago Inter-Ocean, iu a lengthy and very earnest editorial on this sub- 



46 KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

The Smithsonian stands burc in the position of a disinterested and 
independent party, absolutely res])ousible, having a permanency such 
as no individual or private corporation can represent, and it might very 
well, it seems to me, in pursuit of its proper objects accept a trust of 
this kind on the coudition either of seeing itself that the Government 
accepted it and provided for it iu a proper way or handing it back to the 
heirs of the conditional donor. It is i)erhaps not too much to say that 
an important function of the Smithsonian which has lain long in abey- 
ance may yet be develoj^ed in this direction. 

Assignment of rooms for scientific icorJc. — During the past year the use 
of rooms in the Smithsonian building has been granted to the Director 
of the Geological Survey for draughtsmen ; to the Coast and Geodetic 
Survey for pendulum experiments under the direction of Assistant C. S. 
Peirce; to the Fish Commission, during the commissionership of Dr. 
Goode for the sessions of a committee for revising the work and organi- 
zation of the Commission, and for the storage of the stereotype plates of 
its publications. 

Kooms and facilities for work have also been granted to Dr. J. F. 
Bransford, surgeon, U. S. Navy, for the preparation of a report on the 

ject, dwells with special emphasis on the fact that " if the Government i)urchases 
and fits np a park or extensive gardens there will not be the slightest difficnlty in ob- 
taining suitable inhabitants. No better illustration need be cited than the menagerie 
at the Smithsonian. Nearly all the really valuable animals there have been pre- 
sented to it. The zoo in London, the gardens in Paris, the parks in the cities of the 
United States, not the least of which are those of Chicago, set forth, with pointed 
object-lessons, the value and interest these zool-ogical exhibitions possess. A great 
garden at the national capital could, on the plan proposed, bo made one of the most 
interesting and instructive of public resorts." The Minneapolis Journal says with 
confidence that " inasmuch as the expense would be comparatively trifling under the 
management of th at object of national pride, the Smithsonian, there is every reason 
to expect that the project will meet the approval of Congress." The San Francisco 
Call earnestly advocates the measure as one of interest to the entire American peo- 
ple. It says: "That such a park would be of advantage 'for the advancement of 
science and the instruction and the recreation of the people ' needs no demonstration. 
It would be a national benefit, as similar gardens have proved themselves to be in 
other countries. But there are jieculiar reasons for establishing an American zoo. 
The original wild animals of this country are being rapidly exterminated. The 
American bison, better known as the buffalo, is almost extinct. There are a few in a 
remote corner of Texas, and a few still survive in the Yellowstone Park. But if 
nothing is done to preserve them, iu a few years they will have disappeared as com- 
pletely as the pterodactyl. A few moose can still be found in uortliern New York 
and Maine ; there are still a few specimens of the mountain sheep and goat in the 
mountains of Colorado ; an occasional caribou is still shot in the Adirondacks ; a herd 
of antelope is still seen, once iu the way, on the prairies; a few grizzlies survive in 
the Rocky Mountains, but hunters know to their sorrow that these creatures, once so 
plentiful, are growing scarcer every year, and will soon have vanished altogether. 
The traveler on the eastern slopes of the Rockies finds pkiuty of beaver dams, but few 
beavers, and the anountain lion is almost a thing of the past. To find a complete 
collection of the wild boasts which once roamed iu freedom over the mountain slopes 
and the i)rairie8 one must uow go to the north ern section of the Dominion of Canada.

Toner Lecture Fund. — The Secretary of the Institution is cx-officto 
chairman of the board of trustees. No lectures have bi^en delivered 
for several years. The fund remains as originally invested, increased 
annually by the unexpended income. It consists partly in real estate 
in Washington, find partly in Government bonds, the estimated value 
of which is about $3,000. 

American Historical Association. — A bill was introduced in the Senate 
by Hon. G. F. Hoar on the 21st of May, 1888, and in the House on the 
4th of June by Hon. James Phelan, to incorporate the "American His-

request of Prof. J. Capellini, rector of the University of Bologna, the 
Smithsonian Institution appointed two representatives to bei)resent at 
the eighth centenary of the university, which occurred on the 1-tii of 
June, 1888. Dr. S. AVeir Mitchell, of Philadelphia, and Dr. C. Ciardini, 



48 KEPOKT OF THE SECKETAKY. 

United States consul at Dologna, were appointed. A letter from Doc- 
tor Mitchell is herewith appended: 

To the Kegents of the Smithsonian Institution: 

Gentlemen : As representing the Institution over which you preside 
I went to Bologna, and was present at the eight hundredth anniversary 
of its famous university. The ceremonies consisted in addresses and a 
poem by Professor Carducci, Avith presentations to the King and Queen, 
and with the conferring of degrees in law, letters, science, and med- 
icine. Mr. James Bussell Lowell was thus honored in letters, Mr. David 
Dudley Field in law, Alexander Agassiz in science, and myself in med- 
icine. The "Laureati" were not given LL.D.'s but were made doctors 
in their respective branches ; a more sensible plan. I shall send a medal 
and the volumes presented to me, that of these you may make such dis- 
posal as seem best. 

And I have the honor to be, very respectfully. 

Weir Mitchell. 

Grants and suhscrlptions. — In accordance with a precedent established 
by the tii>st Secretary to encourage meritorious scientific enterprises 
undertaken wholly for the advance of knowledge and not for pecuniary 
gain, a subscription of twenty copies was made for the Astronomical 
Journal of Dr. B. A. Gould, published at Boston. 

Privilege of floor of the House of Eepresentatives. — A resolution having 
been introduced in the House of Eepresentatives on the Gth of February, 
1888, to admit to the privileges of the floor certain officials of the Gov- 
ernment, Hon. Mr. Cox, of New York, one of the Kegents, introduced a 
resolution, which was referred to the Committee on Uules, to confer the 
privilege on the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 

It is proper to state that for many years this privilege has been ex- 
tended to the Secretary by the Senate of the United States. 

Reception. — It was the habit of the first Secretary, when he resided in 
the Smithsonian building, to give receptions there from time to time, 
which juany still pleasantly remember. It is, perhaps, proper for the 
writer to mention that though these rooms are now devoted to official pur- 
poses he, desiring that the traditions of this kindly hospitality should 
not entirely lapse, used them on the 17th of April of the i^resent year 
on an occasion, which, so far as he was able to make it so, was not dis- 
similar in kind to the former ones in the same place, and which he has 
reason to hope will be pleasantly associated with them in the recollec- 
tions of old friends of the Institution. 

Employes of the Institution. — Few changes have occurred in the cleri- 
cal force. Owing to the independence of the Smithsonian Institution of 
those alterations which take place with changes of administration in 
Government Departments, the tenure of office of all its employes is 
justly regarded as more secure than in other public establishments : 
and accei)table persons are commonly found willing to take emi)loymeut

uuder the Regents ou lower terms tbau the same nominal service is 
elsewhere paid for by the Government. At the same time with this 
fixity of tenure and permanence of position, closer and perhaps kindlier 
relations are found to arise than exist else where in the midst of frequent 
change ; and the writer is happy to believe that the best and most val- 
uable part of this service is often an unbought and voluntary one, and 
that this is recognized by both employer and employed. 

U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The relations of the Museum to the Smithsonian Institution have so 
frequently been discussed, that it is unnecessary to dwell upon them at 
the present time. The connection of the Museum with the present 
establishment has not only always been ver^' much more intimate than 
that of many of the other undertakings which were projected at the time 
of the foundation of the Institution, but as has already been observed, 
it rests on a radically distinct footing from any other, since the Smith- 
sonian Institution has actual property in the Museum, equalling probably 
its whole original fund. Through the agency of the Museum the Insti- 
tution is able to direct the work of a goodly number of investigators, who, 
in addition to their regular administrative work, are doing each year im. 
portant service in the increase and diffusion of knowledge. In fact so 
much is done in the name of the Institution by the officers of the Museum 
and the Bureau of Ethnology in all the fields of biological, anthropologi- 
cal, and geological work, that the Institution can devote a larger pro- 
portion of its own funds to the encouragement of investigation in phys- 
ical sciences than it coidd were not the biological sciences thus well 
provided for. 

The statement of the work of the year in the Museum some years 
since became so great in extent that it was found necessar3^ to add a 
second volume to the Smithsonian Eeport to contain it. Referring then 
to the report of Dr. G. Brown Goode, the assistant secretary in charge 
of the Museum, for a history of the work as performed in its various 
departments, I need here refer only to some of the most important gen- 
eral considerations. 

Prominent among these are the financial relations of the Museum to 
the Smithsonian and to the General Government, and the changes ob- 
tained by legislation in the past year, with regard to placiug the appro- 
priations more immediately under the care of the Regents, but these I 
have already spoken of under the head of " Finance." 

During the past year a committee appointed by mo to investigate the 
sanitary condition of the present Museum structure, has reported in 
urgent terms on the need in the interest of health, of very great changes 
such as can not be undertaken till another building exists to receive 
the present personnel, the collections, and the jiublic duringthe changes.

50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Thioiigb the ageucy of one of your body tliis ivS likely to be providetl. 
The particulars have already been stated uuder the subject of "Building.^' 

I may add in tliifs couiiectiou that the preseut Museum building is 
not more than large enough for the ethnological and technological 
material already available. The proposed new building will aftbrd ac- 
commodation for the natural history collections which are at present 
very inadequately housed. For instance, the amount of space assigned 
to the collection of mammals is about G,500 feet. At least double that 
amount of space will be needed to accommodate the material now on 
hand, as soon as the taxidermists of the Museum shall have been able 
to prepare it for exhibition, it being our desire to have mounted groups, 
similar to the buffalo family recently finished, in order to i^reserve for 
future generations representations of the large quadrupeds native to 
this continent, which are on the verge of extinction. 

At the close of the last fiscal year (June 30, 1887), a very careful esti- 
mate showed that the collections were about fifteen times as great in 
number of specimens as in the year 1882. I desire to call your attention 
especially to the inclosed statement bearing upon this point. 

The Museum is growing, as it is fitting that the National Museum of 
a great country should grow ; and it is not only necessary to care for 
what is already here, but to provide for the reception and display of 
what is certain to be placed in our hands within the next few years. 

Since the erection of the preseut Museum building there have been 
more than 12,000 groups or lots of specimens added to the collection, 
chiefly by gifts. From the year 1859 to 1880 the accessions numbered 
8,475. It is thus evident that within the last eight years the number 
of accessions has been half as large again as during the previous twenty- 
one. 

Many of the more recent accessions are of very great extent, as for 
instance the bequest of the late Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, Avhich con 
tains 20,000 specimens of shells, besides minerals and other objects ; 
the Jefireys collection of fossil and recent shells of Europe, including 
40,000 specimens; the Stearns collections of mollusks, numbering 100,000 
specimens; the liiley collection of insects, containing 150,000 specimens; 
the Catlin collection of Indian paintings, about 500 iu number ; the col- 
lection of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the transpor- 
tation of which to Washington several freight-cars were required. 

There are also the extensive collections obtained at the Fisheries 
Exhibition at Berlin and London and at the close of the New Orleans 
Cotton Centennial ; the Shepard collection of meteorites ; the Wilson 
collection of archaeological objects (more than 12,0. .0 specimens); the 
Lorrillard collection of Central American antiquities, and very many 
others nearly as extensive. In addition to these are the annual accre- 
tions from the work of the U. S. Fish Commission, the U. S. Geological 
Survey, and the Bureau of Ethnology, as well as the contributions from 
several expeditions of the Government, from Army and Navy offlcers, 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51 

and from other Goveriimont officials. These are very exteusive, and 
are yearly increasing in bulk and value. 

In the Armory building are stored many hundreds of boxes of valu- 
able material which we have not room to unpack, and the great vaults 
under the Smithsonian building and many of the attic and tower rooms 
are similarly occupied. 

For several important departments of the Museum no exhibition 
space whatever is available, and no portion of the collection can be 
publicly displayed. Indeed, the growth of many of the departments is 
in large measure prevented by the fact that wo have no room for addi- 
tional exhibition cases, or even for storage. Many valuable collections 
elsewhere than in Washington are at the service of the Museum, but 
we have no space for their reception. 

The collection of birds, which, so far as North America is concerned, 
is the finest in the world, is very inadequately shown, and requires 
double the case room now available. 

The collection of mollusks, which is one of the most complete in the 
world and contains more than 450,000 specimens, is at present almost 
entirely unprovided for. 

The collection of insects, which, though smaller, is, so far as North 
America is concerned, equally perfect, is also practically without any 
exhibition space. And so I might continue. 

It should be borne in mind that under the roofs of the Smithsonian 
and new Museum buildings are grouped together collections which in 
London, Paris, or any other of the European capitals, are provided for 
in a group of museums, for the accommodation of which a much larger 
number of equally commodious buildings is found needful. 

One of the most striking features in connection with the affairs of 
the Museum is the remarkable increase in the extent of its collections, 
which each year becomes greater. This increase is in a large degree 
spontaneous, onlj^ a very small sum of money being available for the 
purchase of new material. As might be supposed, a considerable pro- 
portion of the objects given duplicate material already on hand, and 
although these contributions can, with the utmost advantage, be used 
for distribution to other museums and schools, they do not increase as 
much as is desired the value of the collections for study by specialists, 
and for general educational purposes. The need of a larger fund lor 
the purchase of specimens is yearly more manifest. Exceedingly im- 
portant material is constantly offered to us at prices very much below 
what it would cost to obtain it by collecting, and in many instances, 
when refused, it is eagerly taken by the museums and institutions of 
Europe. The extent and character of the recent additions to the collec- 
tions may, perhaps, be better shown by the appended table than in any 
other way. This table shows comi)aratively the results of a census of 
the collections, taken for the past six years, and from it appears that 
the number of specimens or of lots of specimens on liand at the close of

increased before the publication of the Miiseiiui report for Mie year, in 
wliicli a complete tabulated statement will be given. 

The registrar states that 12,400 boxes and packages were received 
during the year and entered upon the transportation records of the 
Smithsonian Institution. In this number are included 1,482 " accession 
lots" for the Museum. 

Many valuable contributions have been made, as in past years, through 
the friendly co-operation of the Departments and Bureaus of the Gov- 
ernment and of officers of the Army and Navy. For this assistance the 
sincere thanks of the Museum are tendered. The geographical index 
to the "list of accessions," which will be published in the report of the 
assistant secretary in charge of the Museum, will show the sources of 
the material received during the year. Among the most important 
accessions are the following : A collection of old coins, chiefly Eoman, 
deposited by Mr. Thomas Wilson ; a collection of archaeological and 
ethnographical specimens bequeathed to the Museum by Dr. Charles 
Eau ; the Lea collection of shells and minerals presented during Pro- 
fessor Baird's life-time, but not received until this year ; ethnological 
objects from Egypt, presented by Dr. James Grant Bey, and from the 
Congo region, by Lieut. E. H. Taunt, U. S. ]S"avy ; a collection of birds from 
Central America and islands in the Caribbean Sea, collected by Mr. 
Charles H. Townsend ; a pair of living bufi'aloes presented by Mr. E. G. 
Blackford ; a skin of an unusually large moose, purchased from Mr. A. 
B. Douglas; the first cast made in the mold taken from the living face 
of Abraham Lincoln, by Leonard Volk, in 1860; also the first casta 
made in the molds from Lincoln's hands, and the first bronze cast of 
the face mold, and bronze casts of the hands presented to the Govern- 
ment of the United States, for deposit in the Museum, by thirty-three 
subscribers, through a committee composed of Thomas B. Clarke, Au- 
gustus St. Gaudens, Richard Watson Gilder, and Erwin Davis; Indian 
pottery from the pueblos of the Jemez Valley, in I^ew Mexico, collected 
by Col. James Stevenson, of the Bureau of Ethnology; a collection of 
bird eggs from Lieut. H. C. Benson, U. S. Army, and from Dr. J. C. Mer- 
rill, U. S. Army ; a collection of reptiles and batrachians from Dr. R. Ells- 
worth Call; extensive collections of fishes and marine invertebrates, 
collected by the L^. S. Fish Commission ; a large collection of Syrphid;e 
from Dr. S. W. Williston, forming the types of Bulletin 31 of the Na- 
tional Museum ; a valuable series of paleozoic fossils from the New 
York State Museum of Natural History; a series of fossil plants, sev- 
eral of them new to science, from the coal-measures of Alabama, pre- 
sented by Prof. I. C. Russell, of the U. S. Geological Survey ; a large 
collection of eruptive, metamorphie, and sedimentary rocks from Colo- 
rado, collected by Dr. S. F. Emmons, of the TJ. S. Geological Survey ; an 
extensive series of rocks, collected by Mr. G. P. INIerrill in Now Jersey, 
Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine; a very interesting series of 
aluminum bronzes and other rare alloys, made by Bierman, of Hanover,

and prcseuted by the " Iron Age," of New York (3ity. Some objects of 
vaUie Lave also been added to other sections and de[)artments of the 
Museum, especially to those of Transportation and Gra phic Arts. These 
will be enumerated in the "list of accessions" already referred to. 

A collection intended to illustrate the application of photography to 
scientific purposes is now being prepared by Mr. T. W. Smillie for exhi- 
bition at the Cincinnati Exposition. This collection includes interest- 
ing contributions from Prof. E. 0. Pickering, of Harvard University ; 
U. S. Magnetic Station, U. S. Coast Survey, Army Medical Museum, U. 
S. Light House Board, U. S. Signal OfQce, the proving ground at An- 
napolis, Commander C. F. Goodrich, U. S. Navy ; Mr. J. W. Osborne, and 
Dr. Thomas Taylor, of the Department of Agriculture. 

The increasing popularity of the Museum seems to be proved by the 
fact that during the year the number of visitors to the Museum Build- 
ing was 249,025, or 32,463 more than last year, and the number of visit- 
ors to the Smithsonian Building was 103,442, or 4,891 more than last 
year. 

Following the usual policy, free access to tlie collections has been 
granted to students in the various branches of natural history, and in 
many instances specimens have been lent to specialists for comparison 
and study. Instruction in taxidermy and i)hotography have been given 
to several applicants. This has in some instances been done at the re- 
quest of an executive department ; otherwise, the students have been 
expected to render voluntary service as an equivalent. Permission has 
been granted by the Superintendent of Police, upon the indorsement of 
the Smithsonian Institution, to several young men to shoot birds in the 
District of Columbia for scientific purposes. This privilege is provided 
for by law in section 14, chapter 213, vol. i of the " Supplement to the Ee- 
vised Statutes of the United States." The use of the lecture hall in the 
Museum has been granted for lectures and meetings of scientific socie- 
ties, as follows : A course of Saturday lectures, twelve in number, com- 
mencing on February 18 5 four lectures given under the auspices of the 
Amateur Botanical Club of Washington, on December 10, 21, January 
7, 21 ; the annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences, April 
17-21. The Biological Society of Washington and the Botanical Sec- 
tion of this society also held some of their meetings in the Museum. 
The usual courtesies have been extended to other public institutions 
by the gift and loan of photographs and working drawings of Museum 
cases, drawings and photographs of specimens, and copies of Museum 
labels. 

Two hundred and sixty-four lots of specimens have been distributed 
to museums, colleges, and individuals. Applications for duplicate spec- 
imens are each year increasing in number. During this year fifty-three 
have been received. It has always been the j^olicy of the Smithsonian 
Institution to distribute in this way the duplicate material which accu- 
mulates in the departments of the Museum, and the importance of this 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55 

policy Las been repeatedly commented upon in pievions reports. It 
bas not yet, bowever, been lound practicable to comply witb tbese 
applications as fast as received, because tlie curators bave not yet bad 
time to arrauge tbo duplicate material into sets for distribution. It is 
to be boped tbat in future it may be ])ossible to relieve tlie curators of 
some of tbe routine work wbicb tbey arc now obliged to attend to per- 
sonally, in order tbat among otber tbiugs tbey may devote more of tbeir 
time to tbe classification of duplicate material. 

Tbe importance of museum collections for purposes of education in 
scbools is becoming of late years mucb more fully appreciated, and it 
seems desirable to make some cbanges in tbe manner of distributing 
specimens; especially to make tbe collections sent out so complete — 
witbin sucb limits as it may be possible to develoj) tbem by metbods of 
arrangement and labels — tbat tbey may be ready for immediate use in 
instruction. In order to do tbis it is often necessary to supplement du- 
plicate material on band by otber material specially collected. Witb 
tbis in view tbe curators of mineralogy and i^bysical geology bave been 
requested to obtain during tbe year in large quantities, for tbe special 
])urpose of distribution, specimens of minerals from certain ricb locali- 
ties. By tbis means material for a considerable number of series of 
minerals and rocks bave been obtained, wbile at tbe same time valua- 
ble additions bave been made to tbe Museum collections. Mr. Merrill, 
curator of pbysical geology, visited during tbe summer, i^oints in Nortb 
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Massacbusetts, Maine, New Hampsbire, Ver- 
mont, and New York. Mr. Yeates, assistant curator of minerals, vis- 
ited tbe States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Nortb 
Carolina. Special attention bas been tbus given to obtaining geologi- 
cal and mineralogical material ibr distribution, owing to tbe fact that 
there is on file a very large number of applications for specimens of 
this kind, wbicb it bas been impossible so far to meet. Collections of 
tbis character are, furthermore, mucb better suited for school museums, 
especially those which have not much .money to spend in tbe prepara- 
tion and installation of specimens, than are the more fragile and perish- 
able zoological collections. It is boped that during the coming year it 
will also be practical to make up a considerable number of sets of bird- 
skins, illustrating the classification of birds into families. 

The report on the operations of tbe National Museum for the first 
half of 1885, and forming Part ii of the Report of tbe Smithsonian In- 
stitution, bas been received from the Public Printer. This report in- 
cludes Mr. Thoccas Donaldson's paper on " Tbe George Catlin Indian 
Gallery." Tbe bound volumes of volume 9 of the "Proceedings of the 
U. S. National Museum" were received from the Public Printer in Au- 
gust. Two hundred copies of this volume had been distributed, signa- 
ture by signature,to tbe collaborators of tbe Museum and other scientists 
throughout the world. Tbis volume consists of 720 pages, and is illus-

tratcd by twenty five ])hites and six figures. It includes fifty-five papers 
by Messrs. Eidgway, Eatbbim, Stejueger, Dall, True, aud otber otticers 
of the Museum, and by Messrs. Jordan, Eigeuiuauu, Evermann, ]ja\v- 
rence, and other coHaborators. Six new genera aud fifty-one new species 
of animals are described for the first time in this volume. Signatures 
7-31 of volume 10 of tbe '' Proceedings of the U. S. National Museum," 
were printed and distributed. These include 400 pages, aud embrace 
thirty-three papers by Messrs. Bean, Bollmau, Cope, Eigenmauu, C. H. 
Gilbert, Lilljeborg, Linton, Lucas, Mc]!?eill, Eathbun, Eidgway, E. W. 
Shufeldt, J. B. Smith, Stejueger, Towusend, and Vasey. In these sig- 
natures are contained descriptions of fifty-one new genera and species 
of birds, mammals, reptiles, fishes, aud insects. Bulletin 32, " Cata- 
logue of Batrachians and Eeptiles of Central America and Mexico," 
by E. D. Cope, has been issued. Considerable progress has been made 
in the printing of Bulletin 33, " Catalogue of Minerals," by Thomas 
Egleston, and of Bulletin 34, " Batrachia of Ii^orth America," by E. D. 
Cope. 

The Museum report for 1887-'88 is now being prepared, and will in- 
clude literary contributions from Dr. H. C. Yarrow, Prof. Otis T. Ma- 
sou, Mr. F. A. Lucas, and others. 

Circular 30, "Concerning the Department of Antiquities," was printed 
and widely distributed by the curator of that department. A large 
correspondence has resulted, and valuable facts have been collated there- 
from. These will be published in the report of the curator. 

Nearly 250 papers have been published by the officers of Museum 
and about 50 by collaborators. In the latter case the papers are 
based upon material in the Museum. Of the entire number, 79 relate 
to insects, 70 to birds, 12 to reptiles, 11 to fossil invertebrates, 9 to min- 
erals, and 8 to plants. 

The number of labels printed for the Museum during the year is 
2,600. In addition, copy for more than 2,000 labels was sent to the 
Government Printing Office, but the labels had not been printed at the 
end of the fiscal year. It is hoped that next year it may be possible 
to secure quicker returns of labels from the Printing Office, since upon 
them depends in great part the instructive value of the objects exhib- 
ited. 

The number of publications added to the Library during the year 
is G,063, of which l,3iG are volumes of more than a hundred pages. 
The most important accession was the bequest of Dr. Charles Eau's 
library, consisting of 715 volumes and 1,722 pamphlets and other docu- 
ments. 

Through the co-operation of the U. S. Fish Commission the Smith- 
sonian Institution has been enabled to secure from Funk Island, for 
the National Museum, a collection of bones of the Great Auk, and in- 
cidentally important collections of mammals, birds, bird eggs, fishes, 
plants, ores, rocks, stone implements, and fossils were obtained from

tbis expedition will be given in a paper by Mr. F. A. Lucas in Part II 
of the Keport of tlie Smithsonian Institution for 1888. 

The collection of the department of Ethnology has- been enriched 
by the receipt of a most valuable and interesting contribution of 
specimens brought from Easter Island, and also of a series of photo- 
graphs taken on the island by Paymaster William J. Thomson, U. S. 
Navy. 

Mr. W. T. Hornaday, curator of living animals, made a collecting 
trip to the Northwest in November aud secured a large number of living 
animals. 

Under the joint auspices of the Fish Commission and Smithsonian 
Institution J\Ir. Charles II. Townsend made a collecting tour on Swan 
Island and in Central America. As a result large collections of mam- 
mals and birds were obtained for the Museum. 

During the summer Mr. P. H. Kuowiton made a collection of the 
plants, rocks, and ores of Vermont. 

During the year important changes have taken place in connection 
with some of the scientific departments of the Museum. Dr. Charles 
Ran, Curator of the Department of Prehistoric Anthropology, died on 
June 2G, 1887.* His successor is Mr. Thomas Wilson, who received his 
appointment as Honorary Curator on December 1. In November Dr. H. 
G. Beyer, U. S. Navy, Honorary Curator of the Section of Materia Medica, 
was ordered to other duties, and Dr. J. M. Flint, U. S. Navy, the first Cura- 
tor of this collection, has again taken charge. The Museum has com- 
menced the formation of a collection of casts of Assyrian and Babylonian 
antiquities, in association with the Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Paul 
Haupt, Professor of Semitic Languages in the Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity, was in February a])pointed Honorary Curator, Dr. Cyrus Adler, of 
the same university, consenting to act as Honorary Assistant Curator. 
The Section of Transportation, under the care of Mr. J. E. Watkius, has 
now reached that point in its history where it may take rank with the 
other sections of the Department of Arts and Industries. The Section 
of Graphic Arts, under the curatorship of Mr. S. R. Koehler, has made 
excellent progress toward the illustration of the resources of the art of 
engraving in all its branches. On May 9 the Department of Living 
Animals was organized, with Mr. W. T. Hornaday, Chief Taxidermist, as 
curator. 

As in years past, we have been called upon to contribute to local ex 
hibitions, and numerous applications have been made for material, 
which has always been refused on the ground that nothing couhl be done 
without an order from Congress. Numerous bills of this kind have been 
before Congress for consideration. Oneof these, passed during the fiscal 
year of 1887, applied to the present year. This was the bill authorizing

tbc sending of colloctions to Minneapolis. The joint resolution, vvliicU 
was approved March 3, 1887, is here qnoted : 

[Public resolution No. 18.] 

JOINT RESOLUTION authorizing tbe several Executive Departments of the Govern- 
meut to h)au to the Miuneapolis ludiistrial Exposition certaiu articles for exliibit. 

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States 
of America in Congress assembled, That it is desirable, in any way con- 
sistent with existiugc laws, and without risk to Government property 
or expense to the National Treasury, to encourage the effort being- 
made for the oi)ening and holding of a grand industrial and educational 
exposition of the Northwest, at the city of Minneapolis, in the State of 
Minnesota, and the interests of the whole northwestern section of our 
country demand it be made an unqualified success ; and it be, and is 
hereby, approved that the heads of the several Executive Departments 
shall, in whatever respects they may in their judgment see convenient 
and proper, loan any articles or material suitable to such purpose : 
Provided, That such loan be made entirely on the responsibility of said 
Minneapolis Industrial Exposition, and shall not be of material needed 
for use in either Department, and shall not in any way interrupt the 
daily routine of duty or order in any branch of the Government, and 
shall be returned to the proper Department, in good order, within one 
month after the close of the exposition: And provided further, That 
before any such loan shall be made, the proper head of the Department 
shall require and receive a good and sufficient bond, by or in behalf of 
such exposition, for the safe return thereof as aforesaid, and to indem- 
nify and save harmless the Government of the United States, or any 
Department thereof, from any liability or expense on account thereol, 
or on account of this resolution. 

Approved, March 3, 1887. 

The exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution was prepared under the 
direction of Mr. W. V. Cox, Chief Clerk of the National Museum, who 
was api)ointed representative of the Institution on this occasion. The 
exhibit may be classified under the following heads : Ethnology, Tex- 
tiles and Fabrics, Metallurgy, Deer Antlers and Horns, Casts of Fishes 
of North America, Photographs of Government Buildings, including the 
Smithsonian Institution and National Museum, collection of specimens 
illustrating the composition of the human body. The total weight of 
this exhibit was 21,507 i^ounds. The entire Government exhibit at- 
tracted much attention, and repeated requests were made by the man- 
agers of the exposition for the privilege of keeping the articles for 
another exhibition. 

A much more extensive enterprise was the Ohio Valley and Central 
States Exposition at Cincinnati, opening July 4, 1888, which, together 
with an exhibition at Marietta on July 15 to July 19, was made the sub- 
ject of a bill which, having passed both Houses, was api^roved May 28, 
1888. A co])y of the act approved May 28, and of the explanatory act 
approved July IG, is here given.

Resolved by the Senate and Rouse of Representatives of the United States 
of America in Gonfiress assembled, That it is the true intent and meaning 
of the act of Congress approved May twenty eighth, eighteen hundred 
and eighty-eight, by the President of the United States, entitled "An

Institution, iucludiug the l^atioual Museum and the Com mission of Fish 
and Fisheries, to participate in the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio 
Valley and Central States, to be held at Cincinnati, Ohio, from July 
fourth to October seventh, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight," that 
the President of the United States may, in his discretion make an order 
directing that any documents, papers, maps not original, books or other 
exhibits which properly and pertinently relate to the establishment of 
civil government in the territory northwest of the Ohio Kiver, may bo 
sent upon an executive order from any of the several Departments in 
said act named, or from the exhibits now at Cincinnati, and that the 
appropriation of money in said act to defray the expenses of such ex- 
hibits, may be made applicable, in so far as the President of the United 
States may direct, to the payment of the exi)enscs of the care, trans- 
portation to and return of such exhibits from Marietta. And the same 
shall be paid from such fund heretofore set apart for each Department 
as the President may order. Nor shall anything in said act be so con- 
strued as to prevent the purchase of suitable materials, and the em- 
ployment of proper persons, to complete or modify series of objects, and 
classes of specimens, when in the judgment of the head of any Depart- 
ment such purchase or employment, or both is necessary in the proper 
preparation and conduct of an exhibit. Nor to authorize the removal 
from their places of deposit in Washington of any original paper or 
document or laws or ordinances whatever. 
Approved, July 16, 1888. 

The Assistant Secretary, Dr. Goode, was appointed representative of 
the Smithsonian Institution in the preparation of this display, in ac- 
cordance with the provisions of the act. Preparations for these exhi- 
bitions were nearly completed at the close of the fiscal year, and some 
fourteen car-loads of material have been sent by this Institution to 
Cincinnati. The sum of $50,000 was appropriated for the use of the 
Smithsonian Institution (including the National Museum and Fish 
Commission), and $10,000 of this sum was transferred to the Commis- 
sioner of Fisheries. 

In this connection it may be well to say that, although sympathizing 
with the efibrt to extend the educational work of the Institution and of 
the National Museum througliout the country, the growing tendency to 
withdraw for a considerable portion of each year some of the most in- 
teresting and valuable parts of the collections, is liable to many objec- 
tions, — objections which are much stronger now, since the Museum is 
approaching a final arrangement in classification than some years ago, 
when the collections were unsettled and unformed. Not only is the 
work of the entire Museum seriously impaired, but the collections sent 
out are invariably damaged, some irreparably, some to such a degree 
that it requires much time and expense to restore them. Furthermore, 
the standard of local exhibitions is yearly becoming higher, and tlie 
local managers are no longer satisfied to accept from us the specimens 
which, in the judgment of the j\Iuseum ollicials, can be spared, but are 
disposed to insist upon having tlio most valuable and costly objects, 
which if destroyed would be irreplaceable, and if sent at all are espe- 
cially liable to damage. In addition to this should be taken into account 



G2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

the fact that temporary exposition buildiugs are never fire- proof, and 
that the time is sure to come, if the present practice prevails, when some 
exhibition building containing Government collections, to the value of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, will be destroyed. The experience 
of the Mexican Government in its participation at the New Urleans 
Exposition and of the Government of New South Wales in 1883 may 
be taken as warnings. If, however, in future years Congress is dis- 
posed to order such participation in exhibitions, I would urge as a ne- 
cessity that legislation should be provided at least six months in ad- 
vance of the date of the exhibition; other «^ise, the participation can 
not but be unsatisfactory and expensive. I am also disposed to lay 
stress upon the necessity of liberal appropriations, which should be 
made with the understanding that new material may be obtained, which 
shall not only replace that which has been lost in past exhibitions, but 
shall enrich the Museum collections for home use and for use in future 
exhibition work. If this necessity is not recognized, the result will be 
that in a few years the Museum will be greatly impoverished, not only 
by the destruction of material, but also by the dissipation of the energy 
of its staff, which being applied to temijorary purposes in this way is 
taken away from its legitimate 'work. It would indeed seem only fair 
that a distraction of this kind, which afiects in large degree every 
oflBcer and employe, should be compensated for by the opportunity to 
purchase new material which will remain permanently the property of 
the Government and increase the usefulness of the Governmental 
Museum work. 

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. 

The prosecution of ethnologic researches among the North American 
Indians, under the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and in com- 
pliance with acts of Cougress, was continued during the year 1887-'88 
in charge of Maj. J. W. Powell, as director, who has furnished the fol- 
lowing account of operations. 

The work of the year is most conveniently rei)orted upon under two 
general heads of field work and ofQce work. 

FIELD WORK. 

The field work of the year is divided into (1) mound explorations and 
(2) general field studies, which during the year were chiefly directed to 
archaeology, linguistics, and pictography. 

Mound explorations. — The work of exploring the mounds of the east- 
ern United States was, in former years, under the superintendence of 
Prof. Cyrus Thomas. 

Much of his attention and that of his assistants was directed to the 
preparation for the publication of his reports on the work of the mound 
division during the previous years of its labors. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63 

As tli(; work of writing up the report from the field-notes, examining 
the collections, and preparing the plats and illustrations proceeded, it 
was found that here and there were omissions in the original examina- 
tions which left the details of certain sections incomplete. It therefore 
became necessary to close these gaps as far as possible. The most im- 
portant hiatus was filled by an examination of the lake border of the 
United States from Detroit westward to the head of Lake Superior, to 
ascertain whether the historic Indian localities along that line were 
marked by mounds or other ancient works. 

Another undertaking which had been begun during the last month 
of the preceding year was a survey of certain inclosnres and other an- 
cient remains of Ohio, to test the reliability and accuracy of the surveys 
made by Squier and Davis and others. This was continued during a 
portion of the past year. 

A third item consisted in completing, as far as possible, the list of 
mound localities to be used in preparing the maps. 

During the year the assistants were Messrs. James D. Middleton, 
Gerard Fowke, and Henry L. Eeynolds. 

On July 15 Messrs. Middleton and Fowke went to Ohio, where they were 
engaged about one month in surveying the ancient works of that region. 
During the same time Mr. Eeynolds was employed in the same State 
collecting data for the archajologic maps. From Ohio Mr. Fowke went 
to Michigan, making the tour of the lake border of the United States 
from Detroit westward to Duluth at the head of Lake Superior. lie 
made careful examinations for ancient works and aboriginal remains, 
especially at the following-named points : Detroit; Port Huron j Sagi- 
naw; Ogeman County; about Traverse Bay; Beaver Island; Mackinac 
Island and the main land on both sides; Sault Ste. Marie; Marquette; 
Munissing; the copper region; Ontonagon; Ashland; Bayfield; La 
Pointe (the Old Chaquamagon), and Duluth. Eeturning by way of 
Prairie du Chien, Wis., and Davenport, Iowa, he stopped at Carbon- 
dale, 111., the point selected as headquarters for the season. After 
writing out a preliminary report of his trip he went to Kentucky to 
examine certain works in the northern i)art of that State, and thence 
to Washington. During Maj- and June, 1888, he Avas engaged in ex- 
ploring mounds in Pike County, Ohio. 

From Ohio Mr. Middleton went to Wisconsin to survey certain grou])s 
of works in the southern and southwestern part of that State, which 
occnpied him until autumn. He then went to Carbondale where he was 
engaged most of the winter iu working up the plats and other results 
of his surveys. Before the close of the winter he made a survey of 
certain groups in southeastern Missouri and of the Seltzertown groui> 
in Mississippi. During April, May, and June he was engaged in sur- 
veying and examining groups in southern Ohio and northern Iveutucky. 

Mr. Eeynolds, after leaving Ohio, was engaged dining the remainder 
of the summer, and uutil he went to Carbondale in autumn, collecting 



64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

material for niap.s, iu Micliigan and Wisconsin. He remained at Car- 
boudale until the last of December. 

General field studies. — While engaged in making a geological recon- 
naissance of the Tewau Mountains, the Director was enabled to study 
on the ground a large field of archaeology. This is an extensive district 
of country drained by the Chama and Jemez, and other tributaries of 
the Rio Grande del Norte. In prehistoric and early historic times the 
region was mainly occupied by tribes of the Tewan stock. The people 
lived in villages or pueblos, many of which were built of the rude stone 
that abounds iu convenient forms for such structures. The cliffs of the 
caiions carved by the many streams that drain the mountain area are 
often composed of volcanic tufa so soft that it can be easily worked with 
rude stone tools, and many of the people had learned to hew it into 
convenient shapes for architectural purposes. 

Some of the tribes at different periods iu their history left their stone 
pueblos and constructed homes for themselves by excavating chambers 
iu the tufa cliffs. These cavate dwellings, now abandoned and in ruins, 
and the ruius of many other Poucieut dwellings, are scattered through- 
out this entire country. 

On the northern flank of the Tewan Mountains, near the river Chama 
and about 3 miles below Abiquiu, an extensive ruin was visited, the 
walls of which were constructed of clay built up iu a mass. By what 
mechanical devices they were built was not discovered, but it is evident 
that the clay was not made into adobes. During the study of all these 
ruins interesting archseologic collections were made, especially of articles 
in stone and clay. 

Mr. James Stevenson, who had accompanied the Director in the above- 
mentioned explorations, proceeded, at the beginning of October, 1887, 
to the pueblo of Silla, about 8 miles south of Jemez, aud spent six weeks 
engaged, with remarkable success, in making a collection and studying 
the customs, sociology, and mythology of the people. 

The Silla retain their ancient religion iu great purity in spite of the 
efibrts of Christian priests which have been continued for centuries. 
Their ceremonial chambers contained brightly-colored altars of wood, 
before which many idols and other sacred objects were placed, while the 
walls were hung with various my thologic emblems of great delicacy and 
beauty. Mr. Stevenson was invited to inspect all these freely. The 
fact was disclosed that the people had a finer variety of idols than even 
the Zuni. Their stoue idols in human form presented a special feature, 
the carving being of a higher type than any before seen in the region. 

From one of the large ceremonial chambers he was passed through a 
concealed opening into a much smaller room literally filled with masks 
made in imitation of their idols, all of which he was permitted to examine 
at leisure, a most unusual privilege, as these jieople have a superstitious 
dread of their masks being seen when off" the i)erson. This collection of 
masks is not only large but interesting in variety. Sketches were made 
of many of them. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65 

The Silla, like the other pueblos, have shrines scattered around the 
village near and far, which Mr. Stevenson was invited to visit and in- 
spect, finding some of theui guarded by colossal stone animals crudely 
formed. Having unexpectedly discovered, while studying their mythol- 
ogy, that these people, like the Moki,held ceremonials with living snakes, 
including the rattlesnake, he asked to be shown the exact place where the 
snake ceremonies were held. This proved to be 5 or 6 miles distant from 
the pueblo, in a desolate spot among arid hills, where there was a small 
square log structure in which the snake order held ceremonies previous 
to the dance, the snakes being contained in two large pottery vases. 
The cave when found was closed and completely concealed by a stone 
slab, upon the removal of which two splendid specimens of ancient vases 
weredisclosed, decorated with pictures of the rattlesnake, mountain lion, 
and bear, and one of these vases now occupies a position in the National 
Museum as a part of the collection of the past season. 

This collection, consisting of 864 specimens, is in many respects the 
most valuable ever secured by Mr. Stevenson, as it not only includes a 
great variety of form and decoration in pottery (some of the pieces being 
very old), but it embraces the largest and most interesting collection of 
idols and fetiches yet made. Many of the stone images are in human 
form and different from anything possessed by the Zufd or Moki In- 
dians ; those of the latter being, with few exceptions, carved in wood, 
while the Silla possessed a large number of well-carved stone idols in 
human form. The stone animal idols are also superior to and larger 
than any heretofore collected. One of the features of the collection is 
the beautiful variety of plumed and other fetiches. 

Mr. Stevenson made copious notes on the mythology and sociology 
of the Silla, and obtained the most complete cosmogony ever secured 
by him from any people. 

He closed his field season with the ZuQi priest-doctors, obtaining 
from them additional detailed accounts of their secret medicine order. 

During the months of August and September Mr. W. H. Holmes was 
engaged in studying the antiquities of Jemez Valley, New Mexico. 
This valley is tributary to the Kio Grande on the west, and its middle 
portion is about 50 miles west of Santa Fe. 

Fifteen important ruined pueblos and village sites were examined. 
They correspond closely in type to those of the north, and bear evi- 
dence in most cases of pre-Spanish occupation. Besides the larger 
ruins there are a multitude of minor ruins, small houses and lodges of 
stone, scattered through the forests. Mr. Holmes carried his investi- 
gations of the ruins of Colorado and New Mexico as far south as ibi- 
quiu, which village lies at the northern end of the group of mountains 
in which the Rio Jemez takes its rise. His work of the year has 
therefore enabled him to connect his studies of the northern localities 
with those of the south in whi(th the numerous modern i)ueblos are lo. 
cated. The chain of observations thus secured is of valu.o JU 4\ study

of the art products of tlie vast regiou formerly occui»ieil by town- build 
iug tribes. 

Particular attentiou was i;iveu to an exaniinatu)ii of the cerauiic re- 
niaius. These constitute one of the means of developing the history of 
the pre Columbian inhabitants. A large series of specimens was for- 
warded to the Museum. 

Mr. Victor Mi))deleff, with Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff as his assistant, left 
Washington for the field, September 1, 1887, and returned March 18, 
1888. A group of cave lodges, excavated in the top and sides of a cin- 
der cone at the base of San Francisco Mountain, and situated about 18 
miles northeast of Flagstaff, Ariz., was visited and sketches and dia- 
grams were made. The cliff dwelliugs of Walnut Ca&on, about 12 miles 
southeast of Flagstaff", were also examined. 

Later the work of the field party was among the ruined pueblos near 
Keams Canon, which connect traditionally with the present Moki vil- 
lages. These ruins, six in number, are distributed on the north border 
of the Jeditoh Valley, and are scattered along for a distance of 12 miles. 

The party afterwards camped for some time in the vicinity of Oraibe, 
the largest of the present villages of Tusayau. Here a study was made 
of the primitive constructional devices still in use. Two interesting 
ruins were discovered in this neighborhood and their ground plans se- 
cured. In the northern ruin a cave or underground apartment was 
found containing vestiges of stone walls and supporting timbers. The 
small village of Moen-Kopi was surveyed. This is an outlynig farming 
pueblo, occupied mainly during the planting and harvesting seasons. 
A very extensive system of irrigation is m operation in this vicinity. 

Subsequently the party spent six weeks at the Chaco ruins in New 
Mexico. An accurate architectural survey of the more important ruins 
was made, and the ijlans secured reveal many points of interest. The 
degree of mechanical knowledge disi)layed by the builders of these 
l)ueblos has been greatly exaggerated by earlier explorers, as also the 
(juality of the masonry. Close examination reveals on the part of the 
builders ignorance of some of the simplest princii)les of construction. 
Several ruins, not previously known, were surveyed and others were 
visited. Late in the season the party platted the pueblo of Jemez, 
situated upon a river of the same name, a tributary of the Kio Grande. 

At various times during the progress of the field-work studies were 
made of the more primitive Navajo architecture, and many sketches 
and diagrams were pre[)ared illustrating the Navajo system of framing 
these " hogans," or conical wood and earth houses. Several photographs 
of typical exami)les were taken. 

Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff' left Washington for the field September 1 and 
returned February 23. In addition to general assistance to the party 
under charge of Mr. Victor Mindeleft", he was in immediate charge of 
the surveying. Ground plans of thirteen important ruins, in addition 
to sketch i)laus of a number of others of less im])ortance, and of two 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ()7 

inliiibited i»iicblos, were added to those alreiidy in the possession of tlie 
JBureiiu. Tlie methods of surveying followed in previous years were 
continued in this. The plans, as a rule, are drawn to a scale of L'O leet 
to 1 inch, and the drawing is finished in the held. The topography is 
in all cases indicated by contour lines of 5-foot intervals, sketched upon 
a basis ot a number of points determined with a level. The ground plan 
was usually drawn over a number of points and lines, which were locate«l 
with an instrument, and the direction of all the walls was determined 
by a compass, in order to detect any irregularities. It was found that 
the regularity and symmetry of plan which characterizes many pub- 
lished groun<l i>lans of ruins in the southwest — notably those of the 
Chaco ruins — are not justified by the facts exhibited by the ruins them- 
selves, though upon cursory examination, and even upon preliminary 
survey, the ground plans of many of these ruins are apparently sym 
metric. The plans obtained will be published in articles now being 
prepared. 

Mr. A. M. Stephen was engaged during half of the fiscal year in col- 
lecting traditions and other matter from the Tusayan villages and 
among the Navajos. lie has transmitted a number of valuable short 
papers on these topics and also on the house-lore of the Moki Indians, 
and has furnished descriptions and drawings of the "Kisis" or rude 
temporary shelters of the Moki, comparing these with the primitive 
structures of the Navajos. 

The publications of Henry R. Schoolcraft, issued in 1853, upon the 
pictographs of the Ojibwa, give the imi)ression that they were nearly 
as far advanced in hieroglyphic writing as were the Egy[)tiaiis imme- 
diately before their i)ictorial representations had become syllabic. 
Doubts had been entertained of the accuracy of this account which it 
was considered to be the duty of the Bureau of Ethnology to resolve; 
therefore at the beginning of the fiscal year Col. Garrick INIallery and 
Dr. W. J. Iloffnum were directe<l to proceed to Indian reservations in 
Minnesota and Wisconsin and learn whatever remained accessibk^ on 
the subject. 

Dr. Hoffman proceeded to the White Earth and Ked Lake Reserva- 
tions, IMinnesota, and renuiined for three months, nudving the required re 
searches among the Ojibwa. lie found that the most important birch- 
bark records are those relating to the Ojibwa cosmogony, the institu- 
tion of the Midewin or Grand Medicine Society (in which is preserved 
all that pertains to the supposed sacred mission of the Shaman), ami 
the songs used in connection with the ritual and the initiation of candi- 
dates into that society. 

The pictographic charts are, as a rule, in the possession of the Midc 
or Grand Medicine Man, though records relating to liuntiug and per- 
sonal exploits, as well as directions for killing game, gathering fruits, 
and making journeys, and even personal letters, are made byollHi 
members of the tribe who possess more than ordinary intelligence. 



68 KEPOKT OF THE SECRKTAHY. 

Tlie j^reat iikiss of charts consist of imiemonic sonj^s, juMtainiiig to 
incautatioiis, exorcism, and other ceremonies, and a considerable number 
of these records were obtained, together with their interpretations. 
Sketches of tattooed Indians were also made, but it was learned that 
this custom is almost extinct, the only modern markings being those 
applied to various portions of the face for the exorcism of evil spirits 
causing neuralgia, headache, and other i)ains. Hasty sketches were 
obtained also of an old Grand Medicine chart at lied Lake, a protracted 
examination of it not being permitted by the keeper of the record. 

In addition to the pictograi)hic material, a quantity of mythologic 
matter was collected, all or nearly all of which- was intimately con- 
nected with the rites of the secret society of the Midewin, or Grand 
Medicine. 

Colonel Mallery directed his attention chiefly to the examination of 
the OJibwa on the La Poiute and lied Cliif Reservations in Wisconsin, 
and although it is a less favorable iield for ethnologic research than 
those mentioned in Minnesota, owing to the larger and closer influence 
of civiliza'ion, he obtained evidence complementing the observations 
and conclusions of Dr. Hoffman. As a general result it is found that 
there still exists among the Ojibwa a remarkable degree of pictographic 
skill and it is em])loyed in ordinary affairs of life as well as in the serv- 
ice of religion and ceremonial rites. The statements of Schoolcraft, 
however, are shown to be exaggerated, or at least erroneous, especially 
in their attribution of mystic symbolism to devices purely ideographic 
or mnemonic. The apparently significant coloration of his figures is 
deceptive, as colors are not now and probably never have been used in 
the genuine records. 

In August, Colonel Mallery i)roceeded alone to Cape Breton and 
Prince Edward Islands, iS^ova Scotia, and Maine, to investigate the 
bark records and petrogly])hs of Micmacs and the Abnaki. Special 
study was made as to the probability of an aboriginal source for many 
ot the characters supposed to have Ix^eii first used by French mission- 
aries in 1052, and afterward printed at Vienna, Austria, in 1862, with 
additions and changes, under the direction of Hev. Charles Kauder, 
and now generally styled the " Micmac Hieroglyph s." 

A most interesting and unique body of rock etchings was discovered 
at and near Kejimkoojic Lake, Nova Scotia, and accurate copies of 
many of them were secured. On account of their number, their in- 
trinsic interest and the evidences of their antiquity, these etchings 
form a highly important addition to the collections before made, es- 
])ecially as they are in a region from which no representation of that 
nature ha<l been reported. A petroglyph of interest near Machias, 
Me., not before known, was also copied. A valuable collection was for 
the first time obtained of birch-bark pictographs still made or formerly 
used by the Passamaqiioddy and l\Mi()bs(;ot jribes of the Abnaki in 
Maine, showing i\ simUwt.y h} the use, of picture-writing betvve.en the

members of the extensive Algoiikian stock in the regions west of the 
Great Lakes and those on the nortlieastern sea-board. The correhition 
of tlie pictograpliic practice in manner and extent was before inferen- 
tially asserted, but no satisfactory evidence of it had been presented 
until the researches of the present year brouglit into direct comparison 
the pictography of the Ojibwa with that of the Micmacs and Abnaki. 
Colonel Mallery returned to Washington in October. 

Mr. James Mooney spent the earlier months of the fiscal year in the 
examination of the northern division of Cherokees with reference to the 
dialectic difference of vocabulary between them and the main body of 
the same tribe in the Indian Territory from which they have long been 
separated, and also, in studying for the same comparison their reli- 
gions practices, traditions, social customs, and arts. The northern 
Cherokees are found to have been less affected by civilization than 
those of the south, and they can therefore be studied with manifest 
advantage. Mr. Mooney procured a large amount of valuable material 
from them. 

OFFICE WORK. 

Director Powell was frequently occupied during the year in the ex- 
amination of undetermined problems pertaining to his work ui)on the 
classification of the Indian linguistic stocks, the scope of which has been 
explained in his former reports. It was found necessary to defer decis- 
ion respecting some of the stocks until after obtaining the result of 
additional field-work planned for the ensuing year. 

Colonel Mallery, after his return from the field-work, was engaged in 
study of important and novel points developed thereby, and in contin- 
ued research and correspondence on sign language and pictograi)hy. 

Dr. Iloff'man, while assisting in the same work, prepared an atlas and 
topograhic chart showing all the petrogylphs within the limits of the 
United States and adjacent countries so far recorded in the archives of 
the Bureau, and all i)articulars of manipulation, coloration, position, 
and other characteristics of interest, with descriptions and references 
to authorities. 

Mr. U. W. Ilenshaw was chiefly employed in a solution ot probk^ns 
relating to the geographic distribution of the linguistic families of North 
American Indians in the territory north of Me.\i(!0. When not engaged 
in this work or with execnitive duties he continued the prei)aration of a 
dictionary in the nature of a synonomy of tribal names of the North 
American Iiulians, now well advancx'd toward (;ompletion, the gen«n'al 
character and object of which have been set forth in a former report. 

While in general charge of that division of the office work he specially 
attended to the Sahaptinian, Salishan, Chemakuman, Chinookan, and 
several other linguistic st()(;ks of the Pacific slope. 

During the first five months of tlie year Mr. A. S. Gatschet was en- 
gaged in digesting the residtsof his recent trii) to Louisiana, Texas, and 



70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Mexico, and utilizing tlicm in the compilation of tlic Indian tribal 
synonomy now in course of preparation by the Bureau. 

His designated share in that work comprised the families of the south- 
ern Indians from the Kio Grande to the Atlantic sea-board of Florida, 
namely, the stocks of the Natchez, At<^ikapa, Shetimasha, Tonkawe, 
Pakawa (otherwise known under the vague designation of " (Joahuilteco 
o Tejano"), Tonica, Yuchi, and Tim mucua, and the most important stock 
of them all, the Maskoki family. His work of correlating the informa- 
tion of these tribes for the synonomy can now be considered as com- 
l)leted, though some important tribes can not be classified linguistically, 
e. fj., the Koroas and Pascagoulas, on account of the absence of all 
information in the documents of early chroniclers relating to these 
extinct tribes. The Adai, classed by Gallatin as a distinct family, is 
believed by Mr. Gatschet to be affiliated with the Caddoan stock as a 
dialect distantly related to Yatassi and Caddo proper. 

After concluding his labors on the tribal synonomy, Mr. Gatschet re- 
sumed his work on the grammar of the Klamath language of south- 
western Oregon. He combined all the results of his recent studies of 
both dialects, the northern and the southern, with the facts previously 
acquired by him and composed a treatise on the morphology of the lan- 
guage. This has now been rewritten three times by him in order to 
secure completeness and accuracy- The ''phonetics" are already cast 
in plates as are the chajiters on radicals and on pretixion. 

From July to December, 1SS7, Kev. J. Owen Dorsey was engaged in 
translating the Teton texts of Mr. George Bushotter, a Dakotan, who 
was working under his direction. Mr. Bushotter's collection consists 
of myths, legends, historical papers, an autobiography, accounts of 
games, folk-lore and epistles, amounting to two hundred and fifty-eight 
textual manuscripts. This work was continued until the following 
December when Bushotter resigned, leaving one hundred and twenty- 
nine texts to be translated. Mr. Dorsey then continued the work alone 
until April IS, 1888, when another Dakotan, Mr. John Bruyier, of Chey- 
enne Itiver Agency, began to revise and interpret the Teton texts, 
making many corrections in the originals, and supplying important 
parts omitted by Bushotter. 

Mr. Bruyier also furnished Mr. Dorsey with many examj^les of the 
Teton, as spoken at the Cheyenne River Reservation, which showed that 
it differed considerably from that spoken at the Lower Brule and Pine 
Ridge Reservations. He also wrote new versions of several myths, 
continuing his work until June 30, 1888. 

During tue autumn of 1887, Mr, Dorsey completed his work on the 
Siouan, Caddoan, Athapascan, Takilman, Kusan, and Yakonan cards 
for the Indian synonomy referred to in a former report of the Director. 
He also prepared nearly four hundred type-written foolscap pages of 
(/-ehiga epistles, legends, and other texts, which constitute an important 
addition to those published in the Contributions to North American 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 71 

Etliuolouy, vol. VI, part 1, He also transliterated on slips in alpha- 
betic order his Winnebago material, obtained in 1878-79, collating it 
with the additional material obtained in 1880. This contains fully four 
thousand entries. 

He gave much attention to the Catawba language, collating parts of 
a recent vocabulary (that procured by Mr. Gatschet) with all others 
which were accessible. 

Mr. Jeremiah Ourtin contributed to the Indian synonomy with reference 
to several tribes in Oregon and California, and devoted much study to 
the large number of myths obtained by him from the same tribes, also 
to those of the Iroquois, 

Mr. James C. Pilling has continued throughout the year to give a por- 
tion of his time to the preparation of bibliographies of the more impor- 
tant stocks of North American languages. As stated in the last report, 
the manuscript for the Siouan bibliography, the second of the series, was 
sent to the printer late in the fiscal year 188G-'87. The proof was read 
during the summer months and the work received from the Public 
Printer November 12. Work was then begun on the Iroquoian stock of 
languages, and the close of the fiscal year found it ready for the printer. 
Some preliminary work was also done on the Muskokian bibliography. 
Late in December Mr. Pilling made a visit to the library of the His- 
torical Society of Pennsylvania, at Philadelphia, for the purpose of 
inspecting and taking descriptions of several important manuscripts in 
Indian languages, written by Moravian missionaries, manuscripts then 
temporarily in that city and permanently preserved in the Moravian 
archives at Bethlehem, Pa,, and Fairfield, Canada. 

Mr. James Mooney, when not in the field, continued to be charged with 
the synonomy relating to the Iroquoian and Algonkin linguistic stocks, 
and also worked upon the vocabularies, myths, and notes of informa- 
tion procured by him from the northern Cherokees. 

During the entire year, except at short intervals when he visited the 
field to make personal observations, Professor Thomas has been busily 
engaged upon his report. The manuscrii)t for the first volume with 
the illustrations was ])resented for publication about a month before 
the close of the fiscal year. The manuscript, illustrations, and maps for 
the second volume are well under way and will soon be ready for publi- 
cation. Mr. Henry L. Reynolds, from December until the close of the 
fiscal year, was at Washington occupied in the preparation of mai)s, 
plates, and diagrams for the report. 

During the winter and until the 1st of May, 1888, Mr. Gerard Fowke 
was engaged in preparing a paper for a report on the articles of stone 
in the Bureau collections. 

Mr. W. H. Holmes has charge of the illustrations intended for the 
Bureau publications as in previous yt^ars, and has as far as possible con- 
tinued his studies in aboriginal art and archaeology. 
The collections acquired during the suininer, although not lacking 



72 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 

interest and value, are not so extensive as those of previous years. 
Acquisitions are made in three distinct ways : first, through members 
of tlie Bureau and the Geological Survey who act as collectors ; second, 
by means of exchange for publications or du|)licate specimens from 
previous collections; and third, by donation. Professor Thomas and 
his assistants, working in the Mississippi Valley and on the Atlantic 
slope, report but few accessions during the year. Mr. James Steven- 
sou secured important collections from the Pueblo country, especially 
from the villages of Jemez and Silla, in the Jemez Valley, New Mexico. 
These collections include about fiv^e hundred specimens of pottery and 
nearly four hundred of stone, wood, and other substances. A large per- 
centage of these specimens are ancient. A considerable number of 
ancient relics of pottery and stone were obtained from ancient ruin sites 
in the Jemez and Rio Grande Valleys, New Mexico, by the Director and 
Mr. Hohues. Mr. A. P. Davis collected a number of fragments of ancient 
pottery from the ruin of Pueblo Alto, New Mexico. A very interesting 
series of objects, illustrating the present condition of the arts among 
the Cherokee and Catawba Indians, was procured by Mr. James Mooney 
of the Bureau. Mr. DeLancey VV. Gill, of the Geological Survey, has 
added to the collection many specimens of rude stone implements 
from the vicinity of Washington. Donations have been received from 
the following persons : Mr. C. C. Jones, fragments of ancient pottery 
from Stallings Island, near Augusta, Ga.; Dr. Taylor, fragments of 
ancient pottery from Baldwin County, Ala.; General G. P. Thruston, 
fragment of an enormous earthen vase from a suburb of Nashville, 
Tenn. ; Mr. W. W. Adams, articles of stone from Union Springs, N. Y.; 
Mr. C. L. R. Wheeler, cast of a unique stone knife from Westchester 
County, N. Y.; and Mr. James Tilton, fragments of pottery from Plum 
Island, Massachusetts. 

By exchange for books and duplicates from the National Museum the 
following acquisitions have been made : 

From Mr. H. P. Hamilton, fragments of ancient pottery from Two 
Rivers, Wis., and from Mr. II. W. Hakes, fragments of pottery from 
Broome County, N. Y. 

By purchase or part purchase the Bureau has obtained from Mr. J. 
A. McNiel one hundred and seventy pieces of ancient pottery from 
Chiriqui, Panama, besides some very interesting objects of stone. From 
Mr. Ward Bachelor it has acquired a fine collection of earthen and 
stone objects from Mexico. From Dr. E. Boban a few fine samples of 
Mexican pottery were obtained. All these have been catalogued and 
turned over to the National Museum. 

Mr. L. B. Case, of Richmond, Ind., has presented to the Bureau the 
records of the State Archa^ologic Association of Indiana, which fell 
into his hands as secretary at the discontinuance of the society several 
years ago. 

Valuable photographs of archaiologic subjects have been received 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 73 

Iroiii I'lul'. Anastasio Alfaro, secretary of the National Museum of Costa 
Itica; also from Mr. (J. F. Low, of Cincinnati; from Mr. A. F. Sears, 
of Portland, Oregon; and Mr. D. S. Sears, of Cuba, 111. 

During the lirst two mouths of the liscal year Mr. Victor Mindeleff 
was engaged upon a report on the architecture of the Cibola and Tus- 
ayan groups of pueblos, in New Mexico and Arizona. Subse<iuent to 
his return from the field on March 18 that repoit was resumed, but it 
was not completed at the end of the fiscal year. The additional data 
secured from the Tusayan district during the field season is being pre- 
pared for incorporation into the same report. 

During the early part of the year Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff wa^occupied 
u])on that portion of the report on pueblo architecture which had been 
assigned to him. On his return from the field on February 23 he re- 
sumed work upon that report, but it was suspended in order to take up 
the preparation of an exhibit to be made by the Bureau at the Cincin- 
nati Centennial Exi)osition. An exhibit to cover nearly 2,000 square 
feet of floor space was prepared, but as the space was limited only the 
field work of the Bureau in one especial region, viz, the Pueblo coun- 
try, was illustrated, though a small amount of other material was added 
for purposes of comparison. This work was not completed at the close 
of the fiscal year. 

The work of the modeling room was continued throughout the year 
in his charge. No new work was taken up, all available labor being 
used in preijaring a series of duplicates of models previously deposited 
in the National Museum. This work was continued from last year. The 
series is not yet completed, but the accumulations on hand at the end 
of the fiscal year were sufficient to enable the Bureau to make a credit- 
able display at the Cincinnati Centennial Exposition without withdraw- 
ing, to any large extent, the models deposited in the National Museum. 
During the year eight models were added to the duplicate series, and 
three other models commenced. 

Dr. Washington Matthews, surgeon U. S. Army, continued work upon 
a grammar and dictionary of the Navajo language. 

Mr. E. W. Nelson was still engaged in the completion of his paper 
mentioned in the last leport ui)on the Eskimo of northern Alaska, com- 
prising a dictionary with notes upon the gramnuir of the language and 
also upon the myths and customs of the people. 

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt has continued the stud}- of the Iroquoian lan- 
guages and the preparation of a Tuscarora-English dictionary. He 
also worked upon the comparison of words, radicals, and terms in the 
Iriquoian languages with those in the Cherokee, and in determinivigthe 
prehistoric habitat of the Iroquois. 

The work of Mr. Charles C. Koyce, before rei)orte<l upon, presenting 
the former title of Indian tribes to lands within the [>resent boundaries 
of the United States, and the nu'thods of securing their relincpiish merit, 
was substantially prepared for publication, the charts having all been 
finished. 



74 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

J<\>r several years past it lias been part of the work of tlie Hureaii to 
take a(lvantay,e of the tre<iuei»t presence in Washington of i)arties styled 
"delegations," of the several Indian tribes visiting the capital, for the 
purpose of photograjdiing all the individuals composing them. These 
are generally the prominent men of the tribes represented by them and 
their pliotographs have biograi)hic and historic interest as well as an- 
throjjologic importance. Mr. J. K. Dillers has been in charge of this 
branch of the work, and during the past year has secured ninety-nine 
l)hotographs of prominent Indians in both full face and profile, in order 
to exhibit to better advantage all their facial characteristics. The sub- 
jects we^e from the following tribes, viz: 

White Mountain Apache, 15 persons ; Chiracahua Apaches, 20; Jica- 
rilla Apaches, S; Sac and Fox,?; Utes, 4 ; Shawnee, 0; Omaha, 2b; 
Dakota, 11; Oto and Missouri, 5. 

In connection with the name of each Indian photograi)lied it has been 
the practice to note his age, status in the tribe, and such biographic in- 
formation as could be obtained.

NECKOLOGY. 

MORRISON R. WATTE, CHANCELLOR. 

In the order of official precedence, I am called on to first mention the 
loss sustained by the Institution during- the year, of its Chancellor, the 
late eminent Chief-Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Morri- 
son R. Waite, who died in this city on the 23d of March last (1888). 

His biography belongs to the whole country ; but though I have only 
to speak of his relations to this Institution, yet one who knew him even 
in this limited part of his important duties ca!i not but feel that liis was 
a character of a singular sincerity, iu the proper meaning of the word; 
so that it has been well said of him that he possessed not only a moral 
but au intellectual integrity. Of the affection, as well as respect, he 
inspired, I have already spoken. Remarkable for this admirable sim- 
plicity of character as for his kindness of heart, in his unwavering con- 
scientiousuess of purpose in the discharge of every duty, he made him- 
self, perhaps, the most influential and efficient Chancellor among the 
very able ones the Institution has been so fortunate as to possess. 
Taking pains to acquaint himself accurately with tlie character and 
requirements of the Institution, evincing an earnest sympathy in its 
objects and in its adopted policy, he was a faithful attendant on the 
meetings of the Board during the fourteen years of his jnesidency. 

It seems proper to here record, as a i)art of llu^ official history of this 
bereavement, that a special meeting of the Roard of Regents was called 
on the 27th of March, 1888, to take appropriate action on the occasion, 
and thattlu^ following resolutions, expressive of the general sentiment, 
were unanimously adopted and placed upon the j(mrnal of the 
Board : 

Whereas the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution has 
i)oen <'alle<l tomeetin extraonlinary session by thealllicting intelligence 
that Morrison Remick Waite, late Chief-Justice of the Supreme C'ourt 
of tln» United States and late Chancellor of the Smithsonian institution, 
has been removed by the hand of death from the scenes of his high ac- 
tivities ami distinguislie<l usefulness: Therefore^ be it 

h'('solr('(i, That sitting as we do at this time and place, in the very 
center of that dark shadow which has fallen upon the wlioUHand in tiie 
lamented death of the late Chief -Justice Waite, an<l ajipaHed as we are 
by the suddenness as well as by the magnitude of the great afllietion 



76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

which ill coiiiiiij;" to the nation at hirge has come to us individually with 
an added pathos of sorrow, because of the nearer view we have had for 
so many years of tlie talents, virtues, and graces which found their fa- 
miliar home in tlie person of our honored friend, we could with much 
good reason crave for ourselves, in this hour of bereavement, the humble 
permissionof mourning apart, that we might silently gauge thedepthaud 
the dimensions of a calamity which brings to us its message of i)ersonal 
grief ami which has also torn away from our highest seat of justice its 
venerated and beloved chief; from the legal professiou of the country 
its foremost ofilicial representative and therefore its crowning exponent; 
from the walks of social life in this National Capital a commanding 
presence, no less remarkable for his genial and oi)en-heai ted sincerity 
than for his aftable and gracious benignity ; and from the Christian 
communion a true and faithful disciple who witnessed a good confession 
as much by the simplicit^^ and humility with which he walked before 
God as by the unswerving consistency^ with which he wore the ornament 
of a pure heart and of a meek and quiet spirit before the scrutiny of his 
fellow men. 

Resolved. That while an obvious sense of propriety must dictate that 
we should leave to others in that great foruui \vhich was the chosen 
arena of his life's career, the sad privilege of depicting, with minute and 
detailed analysis, the remarkable combination of strong' and lovely 
traits which met in the person of the late Chief- Justice aiul gave to the 
symmetrical character of our beloved friend its blended sweetness and 
light, we can not omit, even in this hour of our sj^ecial sorrow, to beai 
cheerful testimony to the pleasing amenity with which he presided o\er 
the deliberations of this council chamber as the Chancellor of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, and sharing as we all do in a profound admiration 
for the intelligence he brought to our discussions, while ever moder- 
ating them by the guidance of his clear thought and mild wisdom, we can 
but render our reverent homage to the engaging personal qualities which 
endeared him to us as a man ; while at the same time gratefully con- 
fessing our obligations to him for the provident care and deep interest 
which he always brought to the discharge of his official duties in this 
place, where through all the years of his honorable and useful service 
at the head of this Board, the Secretary of the Institution, in common 
with ourselves, has leaned on him as the wise and true counsellor who 
could be trusted as well for the rectitu<le of his moral intuitions as for 
the clear i)erceptions of his calm and judicious intellect. 

Resolved, That we will attend the funeral of our departed Chancellor 
in a body, and that the Secretary of the Institution, together with a 
<leputation from the members of the Board, be requested to accom])any 
the other friends and associates of the late Chief- Justice, who will bear 
his remains to their last resting-place in Ohio.. 

Resolved, That these resolutions be entered on the minutes of the 
Board, and that the Secretary be requested to send a copy of them to 
the family of our departed friend, in token of our sincere condolence 
with them in their great affliction. 

It only remains for your Secretary to add that, in accordance with 
your request, he proceeded to Toledo, where he was joined by one of 
your body. Dr. J. B. Angell, and in his company paid the final tribute 
of respect, by representing your honorable body at the obsequies of 
this eminent and good man. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 77 

rROFESSOR BAIRD. 

I have referred, at the begiuning of this report, to the death of the late 
Secretary. Both the greatuess of the loss to science aud to this Iiisti- 
tutiou iiiake me feel the ueed of speaking agaiu aud more particularly 
both of him aud of his work. 

Wheu, in Jauuary, 1887, the Secretary asked of your honorable body 
authority to appoiut two assistant secretaries to relieve him from the 
growing burden of his otticial occupations, it was doubtless with the 
consciousness that his failing strength no longer permitted the contin- 
uous attention to his varied duties which he had previously, with ready 
zeal, bestowed. When, under the imperative orders of his physician, he 
■withdrew himself (as much as his active mental interest permitted) 
from the executive oi)erations of his position, the comparative relaxa- 
tion of effort and responsibility seemed to have been accepted too late 
to give him its expected relief and recui)eration ; and his exhausted 
jiowers continued to decline until he quietly breathed his last, on the 
afternoon of the IDth of August, 1887, at the headquarters of the U. S. 
Commission of Fisheries, at Wood's Holl. 

In recognition of his distinguished services, a bill was introduced in 
the Senate of the United States, and passed by that body February 10, 
1888, making an appropriation for the erection of a bronze statue to 
commemorate his merits. 

A bill was also introduced in the Senate for the benefit of his widow. 

At a specml meeting of the Board of Regents, held November 18, 
1887, the following resolutions were passed : 

Whereas, in the dispensation of Divine Providence, the mortal life 
of Spencer Fullerton Baird was ended on the lUth of August last, the 
Ilegents of the Smithsonian Institution, now at the earliest practicable 
moment assembled, desire to express and to record their i)rofound sense 
of the great loss which this Institution has thereby sustained, and 
which they personally have sustained. And they accordingly resolve : 

1. That, in the lamented death of Professor Baird, the Institution is 
bereaved of its honored and eliicient Secretary, \vho lias faithfully and 
unremittingly devoted to its service his rare administrative abilities for 
thirty-seven years — that is, almost from the actual foundation of tiie 
establishment — for the last nine years as its chief executive othcer, under 
whose sagacious management it has }i;reatly i)rospered and widely ex- 
tended its usefulness and its renown. 

2. That the JS'ational Museum, of which this Institution is the ad- 
ministrator, and the Fisli Commission, which is practically affiliated to 
it, both organized and in a just sense created by our late Secretary, are 
by this bereavement deprived of the invaluable and unpaid services of 
their indefatigable otticial head. 

3. That the cultivators of science, both in this country and abroad, 
have to deplore the loss of a veteran and distinguished naturalist, wlio 
was from early years a sedulous and succes.stul investigator ; whose 
native gifts and whose ex[)erien(',e in systematic biological work served 
in no small degree to adapt him to the administrative duties which 
filled the later years of his life, but whose knowledge and whose inter- 
est ip science widened aud deejjeued as the opportunities for special 



78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

iuvestigatioD lessened, Jind wlio accor(linj;ly used his best endeavors 
to promote the researches of his fellow naturalists in every pari of 
the world. 

4. That his kindly disposition, e<iuable temper, sinjj^leness of aim, and 
unsullied purity of motive, along with his facile mastery of affairs, 
jireatly endeared him to his subordinates, secured to him theconlidence 
and trust of those whose iuHuence he sought for the advancement of 
the interests he had at heart, and won the high regard and warm af- 
fection of those who, like the members of this Board, were ofticially and 
intimately associated with him. 

5. That, without intruding into the donniin of private sorrow, the 
Regents of the Institution would respectfully offer to the family of their 
late Secretary the assurance of their profound symjiathy. 

6. That the Eegents invite the near associate of the late Secretary, 
Professor Goode, to jirepare a memorial of the life and services of l*ro- 
lessor Baird for publication in the ensuing annual report of the Insti- 
tution. 

The address made by Maj. J. W. Powell, an old and personal friend 
of the late Secretary, at the memorial meeting held by the scientific 
societies of Washington January 11, 1888, containe I so just and elo- 
quent a tribute to Professor Baird's memory, that I feel inclined to 
quote from it a few words which, it seems to me, will characterize the 
large purpose and attainment of his life, and its relation to others, bet- 
ter than any of my own : 

"Baird was one of the learned men of the world. He knew the birds 
of the air; he knew the beasts of the forests and the prairies, and the 
reptiles that crawl through desert sands or slimy marshes ; he knew 
the fishes that s(;a]e mountain torrents, that bask in (piiet lakes, or that 
journey from zone to zone through the deep waters of the sea. The 
treasures of the land did not satisfy the desires of Baird ; he must also 
have the treasures of the sea, and so he organized a fish commission, 
with its great laboratories and vessels of research. 

"The Pish Commission was an agency of research ; but it was more ; 
he made it an agency by which science is ap[)lied to the relief of the 
wants of mankind — by which a cheap, nutritious, healthful, and luxuri- 
ous food Ls to be given to the millions of men. 

" In the research thus organized the materials for the work of other 
scientific men were gathered. He incited the men personally to under- 
take and continuously i)rosecute their inva^tigations. lie enlisted the 
men himself; he trained them himself; he himself furnished them with 
the materials and instruments of research, and, best of all, was their 
guide and great exemplar. Thus it was that the three institutions 
over which he presided — the Smithsonian Institution, the National 
Museum, and the Fish Commission — were woven into one great organi- 
zation, a university of instruction in the methods of scientific research, 
including in its sco[)e the entire fieUl of biology and anthropology. 

" In his work with his assistants, he scrupulously provided that every 
one should receive the meed of honor due for successful research, and 
treated all with generosity. Many an investij^ation begun by himsell\ 
was turned over to assistants when he found that vuluable conclusions 
could be reached; and these assistants, who were his warm friends, his 
younger brothers, reaped the reward ; and he had mon^joy over every 
young man's success than over the triumphs and honors iieaped upon 
himself from every quarter of the globe. He was the sympathetic couu- 



REPORT OF THE .SECRETARY. 79 

selor of many iiieii; into his ears were [»oure(l the sorrows aud joys of 
others, and he nioiiriied with the inourniii^', and rejoiced with the re- 
joicing". His life at home was pure and sweet and lull of joys, for he 
j>ave and received love and trust and tender care. But the history of 
his home life is sacred. 

" For nuiuy long months he contemplated the day of parting. Labor 
that knew no rest, responsibility that was never lifted from his shoulders, 
too soon brought his life to an end. In the summer of the i)ast year he 
returned to his work by the sea-side, that he might die in its midst. 
There at Wood's Holl he had created the greatest biologic laboratory of 
the world ; and in that laboratory, with the best resnlts of his life-work 
all about him, he calmly and philosophically waited for the time of 
times." 

The memorial which is being prepared, in obedience to the desire of 
the Regents, by the Assistant Secretary of the Institntiou, is partly writ- 
ten, but the pressure of official work has prevented its completion in 
time for publication in the present report. 

Jt seems essential, however, that this report should not be pub- 
lished without at least a brief biographical sketch of my [iredecessor 
from one of his scientitic family, and the following notice, which antici- 
pates the coming fuller memorial by Dr. Goode, has accordingly been 
prepared by him at my request. 

" iSpencer Fullerton liaird was born February 3, 1823, in Reading, a 
town in southeastern Pennsylvania about GO miles from Philadelphia, 
where his ancestors, people of education and proniinent in the commu- 
nity, had lived for several generations. About 1831 his mother, then a 
widow, removed to Carlisle. Carlisle Avas the seat of Dickinson Col- 
lege, where he was graduated in 1810, at the age of seventeen. His 
tastes for scientific investigation had already developed in such a re- 
markable manner that his mother felt that she was justified in allowing 
him, after graduation, to devote himself for a time to his favorite pur- 
suits, and his time for several years was devoted to studies in general 
natural history, to long pedestrian excursions for the purpose of observ- 
ing animals and plants, and collecting specimens, and to the organiza- 
tion of a private cabinet of natural history, which a few years later be- 
came the nuck'us of the museum of the Smithsonian Institution. During 
this period he [)ublished a number of original papers on natural his- 
tory. There were at that time no schools for young naturalists, and 
his education was in large degree self-directed ; during this time, how- 
ever, he ])artially completed a course in medicine at the College of 
I'hysicans and Surgeons in New York,* and drew inspiration and in- 
struction from such men as Audubon and others of the older natural- 
ists whom at this i)eriod he visited, forming the tbundationof lifelong 
Iriendships. His home studies continued for six years, and were 
scarcely interrupted by his election in 1841 to the chair of natural his- 

* He read iiicilicinc with Dr. Mi(l<ll«ton Gold.siiiitli, and attondcd a winter course of 
lecturers at Uie College of IMiysicians and 8uif;<Miiis in Ni'w York, in 1812. Hisnit'diea!

M. D., honoris causa, from the Philadelphia Medical College.

tory and chemistry in his own college, wlieic he remained until 1850, 
having married, meantime, Miss Mary H. Churchill, the daughter of 
General Sylvester Churchill, U. S. Army, for many years Inspector- 
General. 

"The inheritance of a love of nature and a taste for scientific classi- 
fication, together with the companionship of a brother similarly gifted, 
tended to the development of the young naturalist. In 1841, at the age 
of eighteen, we find him making an ornithological excursion through 
the mountains of Pennsylvania, walking 400 miles in twenty-one days, 
the last day GO miles between daylight and rest. The following year 
he walked more than 2,200 miles. His fine physique and consequent 
capacit^^ for work are doubtless due in part to his outdoor life during 
these years. 

"The coming of Agassiz to the United States in 1846, was an inspira- 
tion to him, and one of the first great works projected by the Swiss sa- 
vant was a joint memoir upon the fishes of North America, which was 
eiTthusiastically begun by the young Dickinson professor, but never 
brought to the point of publication. 

"Agassiz did not become established in Cambridge until 1848, and it 
is to'Baird rather than to him that should belong the credit of having 
introduced into American schools the system of laboratory practice and 
field explorations in connection with natural history instruction. Mou- 
cure D. Conway, who was one of his pupils, has often told me how fas- 
cinating were Professor Baird's explanations of natural phenomena, and 
how the contagion of his enthusiasm spread among his pupils, who fre- 
quently followed him through the fields and woods 20 or 30 miles a day. 

" His mentor at this period was the Hon. George P. Marsh, of Vermont, 
already prominent in public affairs, and his warm friend and admirer.* 
To him Professor Baird felt that he owed his real start in life, for Mr. 
Marsh, feeling that h\s protege was disposed to bury himself too deeply 
in the technicalities of a specialty, proposed that he should undertake 
the translation and editorship of an edition of the ' Iconographic Ency- 
clopicdia,' a version of Heck's BUder- Atlas ^ imblished in connection with 
the famous Conversations- Lexilcon of Brockhaus. This task, though ex- 
ceedingly laborious and confining to a young man of twenty-six, en- 
tirely untrained in literary methods, was efiQciently and rapidly per- 
formed, and resulted in a great extension of his tastes and sympathies, 
while the training which he acquired was an excellent x>i"eparation for 
the tremendous literary tasks which he undertook without hesitation 
in later years. It was also to the interest of Mr. Marsh, who was one 
of the earliest Kegents of the Smithsonian Institution, that he owed his 
nomination to the position of Assistant Secretary of that Institution, 
then recently organized, which he accepted July 5, 1850, and October 
3, at the age of twenty-seven years, entered upon his life-work in con-

esting letters from Mr. Marsh to Professor Baird are quoted.

iiectiou witli that foundiitioii, "the increase and (lilliLsioii of knowledg^e 
among men." His appointment, if we may judge from a statenient in 
I'rofcssor Uenry's fifth report, was due quite as much to his training 
in editorial methods as to his professional acquirements. His appoint- 
ment, it is stated, was made at this time more particularly in order that 
his services might be secured to take charge of the publications, and 
tliat the Institution might take advantage of theample experience which 
he had gained m this kind of work. 

"It was, of course, impossible that the Regents of the Smithsonian 
Institution could have appreciated the fact that he had invented, in 
connection with his work upon his own i^rivate collections, a system of 
nuiseum administration which was to be of the utmost value in the de- 
veloi)meiitof the great National Museum which he afterward was instru- 
mental in founding. All the elaborate and efticient methods of admin- 
istration which are now in use in the National Museum were present, 
in germ at least, in the little private museum which grew up under 
his control at home, and which he brought with him in a single freight 
car to form the nucleus of the great Smithsonian collections.* Among 
the treasures of this collection, which are still cherished by the Institu- 
tion, were a number of the choicest bird skins collected by Audubon, 
who had always felt for him a sincere friendship from the time when 
In^ proposed to the boy of seventeen that he should accompany him on 
a voyage to the headwaters of the Missouri, and become his partner in 
the prei)aration of a great work on the quadrupeds of North America, 
which afterward he brought out in conjunction with Bacbman, of South 
Carolina. 

"The tirst grant made by the Institution for scientific exploration 

* The only specimens in possession of the Institution at the time of his arrival were 
a few boxes of minerals and plants. The collections of the Wilkes Exploring Expedi- 
tion, which constitute the legal foundation of the National Museum of the United 
States, were at that time under the charge of the National Institute; and although 
by the act of incorporation the Smithsonian Institution was the legal custodian of 
the national cabinet of curiosities, it was not until 18.')7 that the Regents finally ac- 
cepted the trust, and the National Museum w^as definitely placed under the control 
of the Smithsonian Institution and transferred to its building. Until this time Con- 
gress had granted no funds for the support of the Smithsonian cabinets, and the collec- 
tions had beeu acquired and cared for at the expense of the endowment fund. They 
had, however, become so large and important in 1857 that the so-called "National 
Collection" at that time acquired was small in comparison. 

The National Museum thus had a double origin. Its actual although not its legal 
nucleus was the collection gathered in the Smithsonian building prior to 1857. Its 
methods of administration, which were in fact the very same that had been developed 
by rrofcssor JJaird in Carlisle as early as 1845, are those which are still in use, and 
which hav<; stood the test of thirty years without any necessity for their modilicatiou 
l)eeoming apparent. In the Fifth Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution, now 
exceedingly rare, is a re|)ort by the assistant secretary in charge ot the natural his- 
tory department, for the year 18.50, which enumerates the specimens belonging to the 
Museum on .January 1, 1851, including a full account ofliis own deposit.

and Held researcU was in 1848 to Spencer F. Baird, of Carlisle, for the 
exploration of the bone caves and the local natural history of south- 
eastern Pennsylvania. 

"From the start the department of explorations was under his 
charge, and in his reports to the Secretary, published year by year in 
the annual report of the Institution, may be found the only systematic 
record of Government explorations which has ever been prepared. 

"The decade beginning with ]850 was a period of great activity in 
exploration. Our frontier was being rapidly extended toward the 
West, but in the territory between the Mississippi and the Pacific coast 
were immense stretches of country practically unknown, Numerous 
Government expeditious were sent forth, and immense collections in 
every department of natural history were gathered and sent to Wash- 
ington to be studied and reported upon. The Smithsonian Institution 
had been designated by law the custodian of these collections, and 
within the walls of its buildings assembled the naturalists by whose 
exertions these collections had been brought together. Professor Baird 
was surrounded by conditions most congenial and stimulating, for he 
found full scope for his administrative skill in the work of arranging 
the scientific outfits for these exi)editions, i)reparing instructions for 
the explorers, and above all in inspiring them with enthusiasm for the 
work. To him also fell in large part the task of receiving the collec- 
tions, arranging for the necessary investigations, and the collation and 
publication of their results. The natural history portions of the re- 
ports of the Mexican boundary survey, the Pacific Railroad surveys, the 
expeditious of Ives, Emory, Stansbury. and others, were under his su- 
l)ervision, as well as, in considerable degree, the natural history collec- 
tions of the Wilkes exploring expedition, which were still uude^ inves- 
tigation, 

"The period of the civil war was one of comparative quiet, but much 
was accomplished by Baird and his pupils, and two of liis most impor- 
tant memoirs, viz, Review of North American Birds and The Distribu- 
tion and Migrations of North American Birds, were published. During 
this decade, too, continued the summer expeditious usually extending 
over three months, which were becoming yearly more and more exclu- 
sively devote<:l to the investigation of marine life, and whicii ultimately 
led to the organization of the Fish Commission in 1871. During the 
latter part of this decade the early impressions of his work in connec- 
tion with the I(50uograi)hic Encyclopiedia began to revive, and a new 
interest was shown by Professor Baird in the popularization of scien- 
tific subjects. At the solicitation of Mr, George W. Childs, in 18G7 he 
began to devote a column to scientific intelligence in the Philadelphia 
Public Ledger, ami about 1870 he became the scientific editor of the 
periodicals published by the llarper Brothers, of New York. His con- 
nection with this firm continued until 1878, and in addition to the weekly 
and monthly issues there resulted eight aniuuil volumes of the Annual 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 83 

Eecord of Science and Industry, the successor of the Annual of Scien- 
tific Discovery, established by J)avid A. Wells, in 1850. When Pro- 
fessor Baird became Secretary of the Snjithsonian Institation his edito- 
rial labors were abandoned, but the idea of his Annual Record of Science 
and Industry was continued in the yearly appendices to the Smithsonian 
report under the title of Record of Progress, and the scientific work of 
the world for as many consecutive years is i>assed in review in the thirty- 
eight volumes which combine the three series just referred to. 

"In the memoir which the writer is preparing it is his intention to 
discuss in detail the great labors of Professor Baird in scientific admin- 
istration and investigation, but his life was so full that it is only bj' 
careful condensation that even an outline of its eventful -features can 
be brought within the brief limits of this notice. 

"There may be noted in the career of Professor Baird several dis- 
tinct phases of activi ty, namely : (1) A period of twenty-six years 
(1843-1809) occupation in laborious investigation and vol utni nous i)ub- 
lication upon the vertebrate fauna of North America; (2) forty j'ears 
(184:0-1880) of continuous contribution to scientific editorship; (3) five 
years (1845-1850) devoted to educational work; (4) forty-four years 
(1843-1887) devoted to the encouragement and promotion of scientific 
enteri)rises and the development of new workers among the young men 
with whom he was brought in contact; (5) thirty-seven years (1850- 
1887) devoted to administrative work as an officer of the Smithsonian 
Institution and in charge of the scientific collections of the Government, 
twenty-eight (1850-1878) as principal executive officer, and nine (1878- 
1887) as Secretary and responsible head; (6) sixteen years (1871-1887) 
as head of the Fish Commission, a philanthropic labor for the increase 
of the food supply of the world, and, incidentally, in prou»oting the 
interests of biological and })hysical investigation of the waters. 

"Tiie extent of his contributions to science and scientific literature 
may be at least partially comprehended by an examination of the bib- 
liography of his i)ublications issued by the Institution in 1883.* The 
list of his writings is complete to the end of the year 1S8L*, and contains 
1,003 titles. Of this number, 775 are brief notices and critical reviews 
contributed to the Annual Record of Science and Industry, while under 
his editorial charge; 31 are reports relating to the work of the Smith- 
sonian Institution ; 7 are reports upon the American fisheries ; 25 are 
schedules and circulars officially issued, and 25 are volumes or jiapers 
edited. Out of the remaining 200 the majority are formal contributions 
to scientific literature, among them the two classical works upon the 
Mammals of Xorth America and the Birds of North America (Volumes 
VI I r and ix of the Pacific Railroad Reports). These were the only ex- 
tended systematic treatises upon those groiii)s which had at that time 
been prepared, of scope sufficient to embrace the fauna of the entire 
continent. They are still standard works of reference, and every spec-

tion, 4<5 to geology, mineralogy, and pabeontology ; 45 to antliro[)ology,

"Wbile tbe number of new species described does not necessarily 
ntford any clew to tbe value of tbe work accomplisbed, it may not be 
uninteresting to refer to it as an indication of tbe pioneer work wbicb 
it was necessary to do even in so prominent a group as tbe vertebrates. 
1 note among mammals 40, birds 70, rei)tiles 180, fisbes 50. Forty-nine 
of 21.'0, or nearly one-fourtb, of tbe mammals discussed in tbe Mammals 
of North America were there described for the first time. In the cata- 
logue of serpents not more than GO per cent, had been named, and in 
])reparatiou for studying the specimens each was carefully ticketed with 
its locality, and then the 2,000 or more individuals were thrown indis- 
criminately into one great i)ile, and the work of sorting them out by 
resemblances was begun. Not tbe least valuable have been the numer- 
ous accurate figures of North American vertebiates, i)rei)ared under 
Professor Baird's supervision. These include representatives of 170 
species of mammals and 100 s^^ecies of reptiles, besides many hundreds 
of birds. 

"On the 9th of February, 1874, Congress passed a joint resolution 
wbicb authorized the appointment of a Commissioner of Fish and Fish- 
eries. Tlie duties of the Commissioner were thus defined: 'To })rose- 
cute investigations on the subject (of tbe diminution of valuable fisbes) 
with tbe view of ascertaining whether any and what diminution in tbe 
number of tbe food-fishes of the coast and tiie lakes of tbe United 
States has taken i)lace, and, if so, to wbat causes tbe same is due; and 
also whether any ami what protective, prohibitory, or i)recautionary 
measures should bo adopted in the premises, and to report upon tbe 
same to Congress.' 

"Tbe resolution establishing the ofdce of Commissioner of Fisheries 
retpiired that the person to be api)ointed should be a civil officer of the 
Government, of proved scientific and practical ac<juaintance with the 
fisbes of the coast, to serve without additional salary. The choice was 
thus practically limited to a single man. Professor Baird, at tbat time 
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, wasai)]H)inted, and, 
at once entering upon his duties, soon developed a systematic scheme 
of investigation. 

" The Fish Commission now fills a i)lace tenfobl nuu'e extensive and 
useful than at first. Its work is naturally divided into three sections : 

"(1) Tbe. systematic investigation of the waters of the United States 
and tlH' biological and i)liysical problems wliicb they present. The 
scientifii; studies of tbe Commission are based upon a liberal and piiil- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 85 

osophical intcrpivtatioii of the law. In makiiij;- liis original plans the 
Commissioner insisted that to study oidy food fishes would he of little 
importance, and that useful conelusions must needs lest upon a i»road 
foundation of investi.gations purely scientitic in character. The life his- 
tory of species of economic value should be understood from he<iinnin,i^ 
to end, but no less recitiisite is it to know the histories of the animals 
and plants upon which they feed or upon which their food is nourished ; 
the iiistories of their enemies and friends, and the friends and foes of 
their enemies and friends, as well as the currents, temi)eratures, and 
other physical phenomena of the waters in relation to mijiration, repro- 
duction, and firowth. A necessary accomplishment to this division is 
the amassing of material for research to be stored in the National and 
other museums for future use. 

"(2) The investigation of the methods of fisheries, past and present, 
ami the statistics of production and commerce of fishery products. iMau 
being one of the chief destroyers of fish, his Influence u[ion their abun- 
dance must be studied. Fishery methods ami apparatus nuist be ex- 
amined and compared with those of other lands, that the use of those 
which threaten the destruction of useful fishes may be discouraged, 
and that those which are inefficient maybe replaced by others more 
serviceable. Statistics of industry and trade must be secured for the 
use of Congress in making treaties or imposing tariffs, to show ro pro- 
<lucers the best markets, and to consumers where and with what their 
needs may be supplied. 

"(3) The introduction and multiplication of useful food fishes through- 
out the country, especially in waters under the jurisdiction of the Gen- 
eral Government, or those common to several States, ncuie ot which 
might feel willing to make expenditures for the benefit of the others. 
This work, which was not contemplated when the Commission was es- 
tablished, was first undertaken at the instance of the American Fish 
Cultural Association, whose representatives induced Congress to make 
a si)ecial appropriation for the purpose.

tified, the Smithsonian Institution, its ward, the National Museum, and 
the Fish Commission, can in this place only be incidentally mentioned, 
and the numerous biographical notices which have appeared since his 
death have not failed to re\ iew critically the significance of his cojinec- 
tion with them and his influence upon them. To his friends who knew 
him best and miss him most it seems pleasanter to dwell upon the rec- 
ognition which his labors received than upon the labors themselves, his 
devotion to which shortened his life so many years. 

" Almost every civilized country in the world has paid him n<»nor. 
In 1875 he receiveil the decoration of Knight of the; lloyal Norwegian 
order of St. Olaf from the King of Norway and Sweden. In 1878 ho 
was awarded the silver medal of the Acclimatization Society' of Mel- 
bourne, and in 1871) the gold medal of the Societe d'xVcclimation of 
France. In 1856 he received the degree of doctor of physical science 
from Dickinson College, and in 1875 that of doctor of laws from Co- 
lund)ian University. A few months before his death, on the occasion of 
the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Harvard University, the 
same degree, ad evmUm, was conferred on him as an eminent promoter of

science. This was one of tlie few occasions npon which he was induced 
to ascend tlie phitforni in a public place. He was one of the early mem- 
bers of the National Academy of Sciences, and ever since the organiza- 
tion was a member of its council. In 1850 and 1851 he served as per- 
manent secretary of the American Association for the Advancement 
of Science, and since 1878 was one of the trustees of the Corcoran 
Gallery of Art, Washington. He was a president of the Cosmos Club, 
and for many years a trustee of Columbian University. Among bis 
honorary relations to numerous scientific societies of the United States 
and other countries are included those of foreign membershi[> in the Lin- 
nanm Society of London and the Zoological Society of London, hon- 
orary membership in the Linnjean Society of New South Wales, and cor- 
responding membership in the K. K. Zoologisch-botanische Gesellschaft, 
Vienna; the Sociedad de Geographia, Lisbon; the New Zealand Insti. 
tute; the Koninklijke Natuurkundige Vereeniging in Nederlandsch 
Indit^, Batavia; the Magyar Tudomanyos Akademia, Buda-Pesth ; the 
Societe Nationale des Sciences Naturelles, Cherbourg ; the Academia 
GermanicaNatura'Curiosorum, Jena; the Naturforschende Gesellschaft, 
Halle; the Naturhistorische Gesellschaft, Nuremberg ; the Geograph- 
ical Society, of Quebec ; the Historical Society of New York ; the 
Deutsche Fischerei-Verein, Berlin. 

" The nomenclature of zoology contains many memorials of his con- 
nection with its history. A partial enumeration shows that over twenty- 
five species and one genus of fishes bears his name, and that not less 
than forty species have been named in his honor. These will for all 
time be monuments to his memory as undying as the institutions which 
he founded. 

" A post-ofBce in Shasta County, Cal., located near the McCloud liiver 
Salmon Hatching Station of the U. S. Fish Commission, was named 
Baird by the Postmaster-General in 1877. 

" Even Japan was not unmindful of Professor Baird's services to 
science, for from distant Yezo, the most northern ishiiul of tlie Japanese 
Ar(;hi|)elago, came, soon after his death, a little volume beautifully 
printed upon silk, containing his portrait and the story of his char- 
acter. 

"The importance of his services to fish-cull ure was perhaps more 
fully recognized in Germany than in any other country, not excluding 
the United States. In 1880, on the occasion of the first great Inter- 
national Fishery Exhibition held in Berlin, his name was found to be 
widely known among the scientific men there present. The magnificent 
silver trophy which was the chief prize was awarded to him by the 
Emperor William. This now stands in the fishery hall of the National 
Museum. While Professor Baird's portrait hung over the entrance to 
the American section at Berlin, the Kammerherr von Behr, the presi- 
dent of the German Fishery Union, the most powerful and influential 
fishery organization in the world, never passed under it without taking 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 87 

oil' his hilt in lionor of the ' first lisii-culturist of the world,' as he de- 
lighted to cull him. He also insisted that any who might be in his 
company shonld pay the same respect to Professor Baird. Indeed, I 
am not snrc that the late Emperor Frederick, at that time Crown Prince 
and protector of the German lisheries, did not do homage in this way 
to the American philanthropist. After Professor Baird's denth a cir- 
cnlar was issued by the Germkn Fishery Union which contained a most 
appreciative eulogy. 

" His ever ready assistance to his fellow-workers in Europe won for 
him their deep regard. Mr. K. Bowdler Sharpe, of the British Museum, 
writes as follows to Nature : ' As chief of the Smithsonian Institutiou 
Professor Baird possessed a power of conferring benefits to the world 
of science exercised by few directors of public museums, and the man- 
ner in which he has utilized these powers has resulted not only in the 
wonderful success of the United States National Museum under his 
direction, but in the enrichment of many other museums. We know 
by experience that the British Museum is indebted to Professor Baird 
beyond measure. We had only to express our wants, and immediately 
every effort was made to supply all the desiderata in our ornithological 
collection.' 

" Professor Baird was the most modest of men. He seemed never to 
care for jjublic recognition. In speaking of any honors which he had 
received he appeared to deprecate what had been done, as if ashamed 
of the attentions, feeling himself unworthy to receive them. 

" He once remarked to me, some years before his death, that he was 
satisfied that no man's life was of such importance to the people among 
whom he lived that he could not shortl^^ be replaced by another who 
would fully fill his place. As I looked at the man before me, a giant in 
body and in mind, a treasury of untransferable experience and wisdonj, 
I thought to myself that if this judgment was a true one (which 1 did 
not believe, nor, at his heart, 1 suppose, did he), in him at least there 
was an exception. I speak not now of his official usefulness alone, but 
of the broader and more essential relationships which he held to science 
and to humanity. 

" Such a man has a thousand sides, each most ftimiliar to a few, and 
perhaps entirely strange to tiie greater part of those who know him. 

<' Future historians of American science will be better able than are 
we to estimate justly the value of the contributions to scientific litera- 
ture which are enumerated in his bibliography; but no one not living 
in the present can form an accurate idea of the personal influence of a 
leader upon his associates and upon the progress of thought in his 
si)ecial dei)artment, nor can such an intiuence as this well be set down 
in words. This inlluence is a[)paienfly due not oidy to extraordinary 
skill in organization, to great i>ower ot application and concentration 
of thought constantly applied, and to a i>hilosophical ami compreiien- 



88 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

sive miud, but to an entire and self-sacrificing devotion to tlie interests 
of Lis work and that of others. 

" His extreme diffidence and hick of self-seeking were among his con- 
spicuous characteristics. He was alwa.ys averse to addressing audi- 
ences, and this is all the more remarkable to his friends, who remem- 
ber how winning and persuasive his eloquence was when he talked in 
the presence of a few. His ability as a talker and organizer was never 
better seen than when, as already observed, in the presence of Con- 
gressional committees, before whom he was summoned from year to 
year to give reasons for his requests for money to be used in expanding 
the work of the Fish Commission or the National Museum. He was 
always received by the members with the heartiest welcome; and it 
seemed that always these pushing, brusque men of business, who ordi- 
narily rushed with the greatest haste through the routine of committee 
work, forgot their usual huriy when Professor Baird was before them. 
They listened attentively as long as he could be induced to talk about 
his plans for the development of the organizations whose success he 
had at heart. Not uufrequently they would wander from the business 
before them as they asked him questions upon subjects which his sug- 
gestive remarks impressed upon their attention. 

" No man was more easily approached than Professor Baird. He 
seemed especially fond of meeting young persons, whom he immedi- 
ately set at their ease by his geniality and frankness of manner. A 
writer in the Ration has said: ' It seemed as if in his mind he had an 
epitome of all the characteristics of mind and habit of each and every 
man. No tliought of self seemed to enter into his calculations. Those 
who felt themselves the object of his personal regard sometimes halted 
for a moment in a comical dismay, perceiving themselves frankly moved, 
like chessmen, in directions which they would not themselves have se- 
lected, but an overwhelming sense of Baird's entire devotion to the 
promotion of science, his perfect unselfishness, and his incomparable 
good judgment, always carried the day.' 

"From his early youth until his failing strength forbade, he kept a 
journal of his daily pursuits, and this, together with the immense piles 
of copy-books and files of letters received, will atiord a boundless treas- 
ure to his biographer; and when his biography is written, if it be prop- 
erly done in accordance with the modern theory of biography-making, 
it will form essentially a history of the natural sciences in America for 
the past half century. 

" For many months before his death he knew that his life was drawing 
to a close. In the summer of 1887, a few weeks before he died, he went 
to Wood's Holl, as usual, to direct the operations of the Fish Commission. 
Of all the tributes to his character none were more eloquent or touching 
than one at the funeral service at Wood's Holl. The simple burial 
service was read, and then the clergyman recited these sentences from 
the Sermon on the Mount : ' Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain 



REPORT OP THE SECRETARY. 89 

mercy. Blessed are the pure iu heart, for they shall see (lod. Blessed 
are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God.' So 
appropriate were these words that scarcely one of those present could 
refrain from tears, realizing how great, how benevolent, how sim[)le- 
hearted had been the friend whom they had lost." 

A memorial meeting was held January 11,1888, iu the lecture-room 
of the Columbian University of Washington, under the Joint auspices of 
the Philosophical, Anthropological, and Biological Societies of this city, 
at which addresses were made by members of the several societies 
commemorating the lite and scientific work of Professor Baird. 

An oil portrait of Professor Baird, of life-size, painted by Mr. Henry 
Ulke, of this city, was purchased by the Regents for the Institution. 



PROFESSOR ASA GRAY, REGENT. 

In addition to the loss of our honored Chancellor and Secretary, the 
Institution has further been called upon to mourn the decease of one of 
the oldest and most distinguished members of the Board of Regents, 
Dr. Asa Gray, whose death took place on the 30th day of January last 
(1888), and brought the mournful loss not only of a great man of sci- 
ence, intimately and long connected with the Institution, but of one 
personally endeared to all who knew him. 

Professor Gray may be said to have been identified with the Institu- 
tion from its very beginning as a chosen and trusted counselor of its 
first Secretary, and an active member of the Board from January, 1874. 

Born iu the town of Paris, Oneida County, N. Y., on the 18th of No- 
vember, 1810, Professor Gray was at the time of his death, therefore, 
over seventy-seven years of age, though few would have so supposed, 
judging from his continued activity and vigor. lie was graduated at 
the Fairfield College of Physicians and Surgeons, Herkimer County, 
N. Y., in 1831, as doctor of medicine. Relinquishing, however, his pro- 
fession, he devoted himself to the study of botany under Profissor 
Torrey ; and he prosecuted for years this branch of natural history 
with such zeal and energy as ultimately to even surpass the tame of 
his distingushed preceptor, and to become the acknowledged chief of 
Am<irican naturalists in his chosen field. 

In 1842 he was elected the Fisher professor of natural history at 
Harvard College, a position he retained for more than thirty years. 
From this college he received, in 1844, the degree of A. M., and from 
Hamilton College, in 18G0, the degree of LL. D. He published various 
botanical manuals and systematic treatises, several of which becaiuc 
universally-accepted popular text-books. He was one of the original 
members of the National Academy of Sciences, iiuiorporated by act 
of Congress Maich 3, 18G3. Fronj 18G3 to 1873 he was president of the 



90 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Americau Academy of Arts aud Sciences, and was president of the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science for the year 1872. 

More than forty years ago, in the very infancy of this Institution, Dr. 
Gray, at the instance of its Secretary, undertook to prepare for i»nblica- 
tion, nnder its auspices, a comprehensive illustrated work on American 
Forest Trees. In the Secretary's third report (for 1849) it is recorded, 
with reference to contemplated "Eeports on the Progress of Knowledge," 
that " the most important report now in progress is that on the Forest 
Trees of Xorth America, by Dr. Gray, i^rofessor of botany in Harvard 
University. It is intended in this work to give figures from original 
drawings of the flowers, leaves, fruit, etc., of each principal species in 
the United States proper, for the most part of the size of nature, and 
so executed as to furnish colored or uucolored copies; the first being 
intended to give an adequate idea of the species, and the second for 
greater cheapness and more general diffusion. This work will be com- 
pleted in three partvS, iu octavo, with an atlas of quarto plates, the first 
to bo published next spring. - - - As the work will be adapted to 
general comprehension, it will be of interest to the popular as well as 
the scientific reader." 

This very interesting and important enterprise, delayed by Dr. Gray's 
visit to Europe the following year, and afterward from time to time 
postponed by various hindrances, was never completed. Simultaneously 
with his engagement upon this great work, other interests and investi- 
gations were pressing upon his attention. A botanical expedition — 
assisted by the Institution — made by Mr. Charles Wright, through 
Texas and New Mexico iu the summer and autumn of 1849, was re- 
warded by an extensive aud valuable collection of the plants of these 
regions, which were placed iu the hands of Dr. Gray; and iu 185Lit 
wa^s announced that his report on this new material was ready for pub- 
lication. This memoir was issued iu two parts, quarto size. Part i, 
comprising 146 pages of text, illustrated by ten engraved plates, was 
included in Vol. iii of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, 
and Part ii, comprising 119 pages, illustrated by 4 plates, was included 
in Vol. V of Coutributions to Knowledge. 

In the winter of 1854-'55 Dr. Gray delivered, iu the lecture-room of 
this Institution, a course of nine lectures " On Vegetation." 

In 1884, Dr. Gray presented to Harvard College his herbarium, con- 
taining more than 200,000 specimens, and his botanical library of more 
than 2,500 works ; for the reception of which a lire-proof building was 
provided. In 1873, he resigned his professorship in the college, retain- 
ing, however, the charge of its herbarium. In 1874, he was selected by 
joint resolution of Congress a Eegent of this Institution, taking the 
place made vacant by the death of Professor Agassiz, who had been a 
Kegent for the i)receding ten years. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 91 

ini. PETEU PAKKEK, EX-KEGENT. 

While recounting' the inioiuls made by death ou the earlier por- 
tion of the ineuibership of the Institution and its Board of liegents, it 
seems proper to uotice also the demise of Dr. Peter Parker, who had 
been a Regent from 1808 to 1884, when he was induced to resign his 
position on the Board in consequence of infirmity and failing health. 
His death occurred at his residence in this city ou the 10th day of Jan- 
uary last (1888). 

The stated annual meeting of the Board occurring ou the following 
day (January 11, 1888^, expression was given to the regret occasioned 
thereby, in the following preamble and resolution : 

Whereas the Board has received the afldictive intelligence that the 
venerable Dr. Peter Parker, who for sixteen years was a member of the 
Board of Regents, and who for this whole period served with fidelity 
on its executive committee, has dej^arted this life after a long career 
rille<l with useful labors in the service of God and of man : Therefore, 

lie it resolved, That in the retrospect of such a life- career, protracted 
as it was beyond the limit usually allotted to men, and yet at each stage 
of its progress dedicated to beneficent works in the cause of religion, 
philanthropy, and science, we desire to testify our respect for the exalted 
worth and scrupulous conscientiousness which Dr. Parker brought to 
the discharge of every duty, and which during his connection with the 
government of this Institution were nobly exemplified by the zeal and 
diligence with which he ever watched and worked for its prosperity and 
usefulness, even during the later period of his honorable service, wiien 
the burden of years was added to the burden of official cares, and when 
with a less conscientious sense of public duty he might have claimed 
an exemption from the tasks of life. 



DR. CHARLES RAU, CURATOR OF ANTIQUITIES. 

Dr. Charles Rau, for many years in charge of the department of an- 
licpiities in the National Museum, was born in Belgium in 1820. ne 
lived for a time in Germany and as a political exile came to America 
thirty years ago, landing at New Orleans December 23, 1848; lived for 
a time in Saint Louis; engaged in teaching at Belleville, 111., and later 
went to New York City, still occupied as a teacher of languages. He 
had always been a deeply interested student of aboriginal remains, and 
had written many articles on the prehistoric condition of man. In 1875 
he had charge of an exhibition of North American archaeology for the 
display of the Institution in the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. 

He was in 1881 appointed curator of the department of antiquities 
in the National Museum. His health gave way in 1886, and in Julj', 
1887, he went to the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where 
he died on the 25th of July. His body was brought to W^ashington and 
was buried in Oak Hdl Cemetery, where a modest grave-stone bearing 
a suitable inscrii>tion has been erected to his memory. 



92 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Ho luMiiieatlied to the National Museum his libiaT^y, cousistingof 715 
l)ouiul volumes, and 1,722 volumes unbouud; his archa3ologieai collec- 
tion comi)jising 1,920 specimens (ethnologic) and his collection of 
minerals and fossils. 

These objects have been transferred to the Museum by bis adminis- 
trator, Mr. Thomas Wilson. The books comprising the library are being 
arranged and catalogued, and will form the nucleus of a departmental 
library. The archaeological specimens will be ke]>t together and dis- 
played under the name of their donor. Almost the entire life of Dr. 
Kan was spent in arcluTBologic studies. He was faithful, zealous, and 
devoted to science. lie had the courage of his convictions and was 
ready to defend them before any person or tribunal, however august. 
He did what he could for the alleviation of human suffering and regret- 
ted he could not do more. The fruits of his scientiiic labors will be de- 
scribed in the Bibliographical Ai)pendix to the Report of the National 
Museum in Part II of this Keport. 

In addition to the above, mention should be made of the deaths of 
the following employes of the Institution : 

On June 8, 1888, Charles Wickliffe Beckham, formerly an assistant 
in the Department of Birds, died at his home near Bardstown, Ky. lie 
had made several valuable contributions to Ameiican ornithological 
literature. 

Mrs. L. S. Weaver, clerk and translator, died November 2G, 18S7. 
She had been employed in the Institution since 187G, having been ap- 
pointed upon the death of her tirst husband, L. Stoerzer, at that time 
chief taxidermist; and she r( udered always willing and efficient service, 

Oapt. C. W. C. Dunuington, a respected citizen of Washington, for 
several years a watchman in the Museum, Frederick II. Parker, a clerk 
in the Institution, and Isaac Diggs, for twenty years a laborer and at- 
tendant, have also died during the year. 



The following notice of Dr. Bmil Bessels has been supplied by Dr. 
Dall : 

Dr. Emit Bessels was born in Heidelberg, June 2, 1847. Educated at 
the University, and securing the degree of doctor in medicine, he was 
more disposed toward science and belles-lettres than to the practice of 
his profession. Being in easy circumstances he was enabled to follow his 
natural bent, and for a time was a student in zoology under Van Bene- 
den, and an assistant of Krauss at the Naturalien Cabinet, or Royal 
JMuseum of Wiirtemberg in Stuttgart. lie became interested in Arctic 
discovery, and his first essay in this direction, under the encouragement 
of Petermaun, of Gotha, was the well-known v^oyage of I8G9 into the

tliis journey be traced tbe inlUience of tbe Gulf {Stream water east of 
kSi>itzbergen and adiUnl niucli to tbe scanty knowledj^e of tbis rcijion 
then available. In 1870 be was called to tbe tield as military surgeon, 
rendering services in tbe hospitals, which brought him a public com- 
mendation from tbe Grand Duke of Baden. In 1871 he canu', to America 
at Petermann's suggestion to join Ilall's Polar Expedition as naturalist 
and surgeon. Most of tbe scientific results of tbis voyage were tbe fruit 
of bis personal efforts. After tbe rescue of the survivors be returned 
to America, where for some years he was busy at tbe Smithsonian lu- 
stitutiou in preparing for publication tbe scieutitic results of tbe voy- 
age, one of the most striking of which was tbe proof first brought out 
by him of the insularity of Greenland, which he deduced from the tidal 
observations secured on tbe expedition. In 1876 bis work was printed 
in (juarto, under the title of "Keport on the Scientific Results of tbe 
Polaris Expedition." Three years later be published througb Eugle- 
uiaun, at Leipzig, a German narrative of tbe expedition, illustrated 
largely from bis own very artistic sketches. He projected a work on tbe 
Eskimo, to wbicb he devoted much labor. An ethnological voyage 
undertaken on tbe United States steamer Saranac to the northwest 
coast of America was prematurely terminated by tbe wreck of that 
vessel in Seymour Narrows, British Columbia. He returned to Wash- 
ington, where be prepared several contributions to Arctic and zoolog- 
ical literature. Througb an unfortunate fire at his residence be lost bis 
library, manuscripts, and collections in 1885, and subsequently returned 
to Germany, where be settled at Stuttgart, Here be was engaged iu 
literary pursuits, tbe study of art, and in geographical instruction. 
He died after a short illness, March .30, 1888, and his remains were in- 
terred in the Cemetery, at Heidelberg. 

Ilespect fully submitted.

APPENDIX TO SECRETARY'S REPORT. 



ArrENDix I. 

PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 

[Presented in the First Annual Eeport of the Secretary, and adopted by the Board of Regents, De- 
cember 13, 1847.] 

Introduction. — Gcueral cousideratious wLicli should serve as a guide in adopting a 
plau of oigauizatiou. 

1. Will olSmithson. The property is bequeathed to the United States of America 
" to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an estab- 
lishment for the increase and diifusiou of knowledge among men." 

2. The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The Government of the United States 
is merely a trustee to carry out the design of the testator. 

3. The Institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently supposed, but 
the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and perpetuate his name. 

4. The objects of the Institution are(l) to increase, and (2) to diffuse kiiowlcdge 
among men. 

5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another. The first is to 
enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addition of new trnths; and the 
second, U) disseminate knowledge, thus increased, among men. 

G. The will makes no restriction in favor of anj^ jiarticular kind of knowledge; 
hence .all branches are entitled to a share of attention. 

7. Knowletlge can be increased by different methods of facilitating and promoting 
the discovery of new truths ; and can be most extensively difiused among men by 
means of the press. 

8. To efi'ect the greatest amount of good, the organization should be such as to 
enable the Institution to produce results, in the way of increasing and diffusing 
knowledge, which can not bo produced either at all or so clficiently by the existing 
institutions in our country. 

9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provisionally, can bo 
easily reduced to i)ractice, receive n)odifications, or be abandoned, in whole or in part, 
without a sacrifice of the funds. 

10. In order to compensate, in some measure, for the loss of time occasioned by the 
delay of eight years iu establishing the Institution, a ccmsiderable portion of the in- 
terest which has accrued should be added to the principal. 

11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated, the funds are 
small. Economy should therefore be consulted in the construction of the. building ; 
and not only the first cost of the edifice should be considered, but also the continual 
expense of keeping it in repair, and of the support of the establishment necessarily 
connected with it. There should also be but few individuals penuanently supported 
by the Instituti()n. 

12. Tlie i)lan and dimensions of tlie building should be determined by the jdan of 
the organization, and not tlie converse.

96 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

1^. It. sliould be recollectod tli.at iiiiiiikind in {general are to bebenelited l)y the be- 
(lutist, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expenditure on local objects would be a 
jierver.sion of the trust. 

lA. Besides the foregoing considerations, deduced immediately from the will of 
Sniithson, regard must be had to certain requii'eraents of the act of Congress estab- 
lishing the Institution. These are, a library, a musemii, ajid a gallery of art, with a 
building on a liberal siiaXe to contain thoni. 

Section I. 

Plan of organization of the Institution in accordance with the foregoing deduc- 
tions from the will of Smithson, 

To increase kvowJedge : It proposed (1) to .stimulate men of talent to make original 
researches, by ofiering suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths ; and (2) 
to appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular researches, under the 
direction of suitable persons. 

To diffuse knowledge : It is proposed (1) to publish a series of periodical reports on 
the progress of the different branches of knowledge ; and (2) to publish occasionally 
separate treatises on subjects of general interc-t. 

DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE. 

I. By stinnilntinfj researches. — 1. Facilities afforded for the production of original 
memoirs on all branches of knowledge. 2 The memoirs thus obtained to be pub- 
lished in a series of volumes, in a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contribu- 
tions to Knowledge. ;?. No memoir, on subjects of physical science, to be accepted 
for publication, which does not furnish a positive addition to human knowledge, rest- 
ing on original research ; and all unverified speculations to be rejected. 4. Each me- 
moir i)roscuted to the Institution to be submitted for examination to acommi.ssion of 
persons of reputation for learning in the branch to which the memoir pertains ; and to 
bo accepted for publication only in case the report of this commission is favorable. 
5. The commission to be chosen by the officers of the Institution, and the name of the 
author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless a favorable decision be made. C. The 
volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the transactions of literary and scientific 
societies, and copies to be given to all the colleges and principal libraries in this 
country. One part of the remaining copies may be otiered for sale ; and the other 
carefully preserved, to form complete sets of the work, to supply the demand from uew 
institutions. 7. An abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs 
to be given to the public through the annual report of the Regents to Congre-ss. 

II, />// appropriating a part, of the income, annnallij, to special objects of research, under 
the direction of suitable persons. — 1. The ol)ject8 and the amount appropriated to be 
recommended by counselors of the Institution. 2. Appropriations in ditierent years 
to different objects, so that in course of time each branch of knowledge may receive 
a share. 3. The results obtained from these appropriations to be published, with the 
memoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smithsonian Contributions to 
Knowledge. 4. Examples of objects for which appropriations may be made, (a) 
System of extended meteorological observations for solving the problem of American 
storms, (b) Explorations in descriptive natural history and geological, magnetical,

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 97 

DETAILS OF TIFE PLA.X FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE. 

I. By the publication of a scries of reports giving an account of the new discoveries in 
science, and of the changes made from year to year in all branches of knowledge not strictly 
professional.— 1. These reiiorts will diffuse a kind of knowledge geuerally interesting, 
but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some of the reports may be pub- 
lished annually, others at longer intervals, as the income of the Institution or the 
changes in the branches of knowledge may indicate. 2. The reports are to be prepared 
by collaborators eminent in the different branches of knowledge. 3. Each collabo- 
rator to be furnished with the journals and publications, domestic and foreign, nec- 
essary to the compilation of his report; to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and 
to be named on the title-page of the report. 4. The reports to be published in sepa- 
rate jiarts, so that persons interested in a particular branch can procure the parts 
relating to it without purchasing the whole. 5. These reports may be presented to 
Congress for partial distribution, the remaining copies to be given to literary and 
scientific institutions and sold to individuals for a moderate price.* 

II. By the publication of separate treatises on subjects of general interest. — 1. These 
treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs translated from foreign lan- 
guages, or of articles prepared under the direction of the Institution, or procured by 
offering premiums for the best exposition of a given subject. 2. The treatises should, 
in all cases, be submitted to a commission of competent judges previous to their pub- 
lication. 3. As examples of these treatises, expositions may be obtained of the present 
state of tlie several brajatlms of knowledge mentioned in tlie table of reports. 

Section II. 

Plan of organization, in a-ccoTtlaiice with the terms of the resolutions of the Board 
of Regents, providing for the two modes of increasing and diffusing knowledge. 

1. The act of Congress establishing the Institution contemplated the formation of a 
library and a museum, and the Board of Regents, including these objects in the plan 
of organization, resolved to divide the income into two equal parts. 

2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge by means of pub- 
lications and researches, agreeably to the scheme before given. The other part to be 
appro])riated to the formation of a lil)rary and a collection of objects of nature and 
of art. 

3. These two plans are not incompatible with one another. 

4. To carry out the plan before described, a library will be required, consisting, 
tirst, of a complete collection of the transactions and proceedings of all the learned 
societies in the world; second, of the more important current periodical publications 
and other works necessary in preparing the periodical reports. 

5. The Institution should make special collections, particularly of objects to illus- 
trate and' verify its own publications. 

6. Also, a collection of instruments of research in all branches of experimental 
science. 

*The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in the reports: 

I. Physical Class.— {\) Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry, 
and meteorology. (2) Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, etc. (3) 
Agriculture. (4) Applicarion of science to arts. 

II. Moral and Political Class.— (b) Ethnology, including particular history, com- 
parative philology, antiquities, etc. ((5) Statistics and political economy. (7) Mental 
and moral philosophy. (8) A survey of the political events of the world, penal re- 
form, etc. 

III. r/iterature and the Fine Arts.~id) Modern literature. (10) The fine arts, and 
their application to the ireful arts, (11) Bibliography, (12) Obituary notices ot 
/iistinguished individuals. 

n. Mis. 142 7 



98 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those mentioned above, 
catalogues of ail the dilierent libraries in the United States should be procured, in 
order that the valuable books tirst i)urcha8ed may be such as are not to be found in 
the United States. 

8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials, should be col- 
lected for rendering the Institution a center of bibliographical knowledge, whence 
the student may be directed to any work which he may require. 

9. It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase by donation as 
rapidly as the income of the Institution can make provision for their reception, and 
therefore it will seldom be necessary to purchase articles of this kind. 

10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art casts of the most 
celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture. 

11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of expense, for the exhi- 
bition of the objects of the Art Union and other similar societies. 

12. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of antiquities, such 
as those of the remains of ancient temples, etc. 

1.3. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, besides the Secretary, 
no i)ermanent assistant will bo required, except one to act as librarian. 

14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to the Regents. He 
shall take charge of the building and property, keep a record of proceedings, dis- 
charge the duties of librarian and keeper of the museum, and may, with the consent 
of the Regents, employ assi-itantH. 

15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress, will be required 
to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to exhibit new objects of art; distin- 
guished individuals should also be invited to give lectures on subjects of general in- 
terest. 

This programme, which was at lirst adopted provisionally, has become the settled 
policy of the Institution. The only material change is that exjjressed by the follow- 
ing resolutions, adopted January 15, 1855, viz : 

Resolved, That the seventh resolution passed by the Board of Regents on the 26th 
of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the income between the active opera- 
tions and the museum and library, when the buildings are completed, be, and it is 
hereby, repealed. 

Resolved, That hereafter the annual appropriations shall be apportioned specifically 
among the ditferent objects and operations of the Institution in such manner as may, 
in the judgment of the Regents, be necessary and proper for each, according to its 
intrinsic importance, and a compliance in good faith with the law. 

[Resolution of Board of Eosents, adopted January 17, 1880, aud at each successive annual meeting.] 

Resolved, That the income for the year be appropriated for the service of the Insti- 
tution upon the basis of the report [of the Executive Committee], to be expended 
by the Secretary, with full discretion as to the items, subject to the ajjproval of the 
Executive Committee. 



Appendix II. 

PUBLICATIONS OF THE YEAR. 

SMITHSONIAN CONTrUBUTIONS TO KN'OWLKDOE. 

Of this series, no work has been piihlishod iluriiig the \)i\»t year. A memoir ou the 
archa-olej" V of North Ameriea has been for several years in course of iireiiaratiou by 
Dr. Charles Kan, the late curator of the department of Pre-historic Antiquities, and 
several thousand dollars. have been expended in the production of drawings by Mr. 
C. F. Trill and others, under Dr. Rau's direction, for the purpose of properly illus- 
trating the work. Dr. Rau's illness at the beginning of the past tiscal year, and his 
death in Julj', 1887, have arrested the progressof this undertaking. The unfinished 
work will, liowever, be taken up by his successor, Mr. Thomas Wilson, and prosecuted 
to an early completion, and it is not improbable that this work may be 2)ub]ished in 
the above series. 

SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS. 

Of this series three volumes have been published during the year, besides several 
i ndependent treatises. Taking these in the order in which they appear in the printed 
lists, they are as follows: 

r/Jl. " Synoptical Flora of North America : The Gamopetahe ; being a second edition 
of Vol. I, Part II, and Vol. ii, Part i, collected," by Asa Gray, LL. D. Of these two 
portions, the earlier — the last part of the proposed tirst volume— comprises 480 pages, 
and the latter — being the commencing part of the proposed second volume— com- 
prises 4U4 pages; forming in the aggregate, with introductory matter, an octavo vol- 
ume of 9F6 pages. As long as forty years ago, Dr. Gray, in cooperation with Dr. 
Torrey, undertook a comprehensive classilication of the North American llora, which, 
liowever, never was completed, stopping w ith a synopsis of the polypetalous, and 
about half the gamopetalous divisions of the Dicotyledons, or to the close of the 
imU-r of ComposHo'. Ambitious of reconstructing and completing the long contem- 
plated work, Dr. Gray, postponing the tirst part of Vol. i (the Polypetahv), has taken 
lip, for the second part of the volume, the Gamopcialw as far as the comiiietion of the 
r(»m;>os{7«', and has continued the remaining orders of the Gamo{)etahe as the lirst 
l)art of the succeeding volume. The lamented death of the author has left his great 
work still unfinished; the third division of the Dicotyledons (the ApctaUv), and the 
Monoctyle<lons having been designed to form the second i>art of Vol. ll. The present 
two detached portions of successive volumes, however, have a unity in beingocciipied 
entirely with the GumopelaUr, and they constitute a full and systematic! descriptive 
catalogue or synopsis of this great division. 

Several thousand dt)lhirs have been expended by the Institution in furthering this 
important l)otanical work, which probalily cost the author nearly as much more. In 
consideration of this. Dr. Gray was allowed to issue for his own benefit a first edition 
of the work of 500 copies before the Institution attempted to publish its own edition, 
which has thus only lately appeared. 

"Miscellaneous Collections, Vol. xxxi."' This volume is occupied with the two 
parts of the " Flora of North America,"' by Dr. Asa Gray, just described ; a separate 
edition of 500 copies of the work having been issued as "No. 591," for special dia- 



100 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

tributioii, accordiug to the loug-establislied policy of the Institution, and au edition 
of 1,000 copies being issued as a numbered volume of the "Collections," for deposit 
with the principal libraries and scientific societies of the world. 

658. "Index to the Literature of the Spectroscope," by Alfred Tuckerman. This 
bibliooraphy is designed to give a list of all the books and smaller treatises, espe- 
cially contributions to scientific periodicals, on the spectroscope and spectrum an- 
alysis from the beginning of our knowledge upon the subject until July, 1887. The 
work is arranged as an alphabetical index to topics as well as of substances which 
have been spectroscopically examined, followed by an alphabetical list of the authors. 
It comprises 3,829 titles and the names of 799 authors, and forms au octavo volume of 
433 pages, including introductory matter and supplement. 

659. "A Table of Specific Gravity for Solids and Liquids (new edition, revised and 
enlarged),'' by Frank Wigglesworth Clark. This work is a revised edition, entirely 
re-written, of specific gravity tables, by the same author, published by this Institu- 
tion December, 1873, and a suiJjdement to the same, published April, 1876. The 
melting and boiling temperature appended to many of the substances in these earlier 
tables have been omitted in the present. A general idea of the expansion given to 
this important series of density determinations may be suggested by the statement 
that the original work gave a list of 2,263 different substances, to which the supple- 
ment added nearly 700 more, while the present work presents a list of .5,227 distinct 
substances. And as many of the substances have had their 8i)ecific gravities inde- 
pendently investigated by several eminent chemists, with slight variations in their 
results, it may be well to add that the tables actually include 14,465 separate deter- 
minations of these constants, averaging about two and three-fourths independent ex- 
aminations to every substance catalogued. The large mass of material thus ex- 
hibited furnishes a creditable record, both of the rapid extension of minute chemical 
investigation in the last dozen years and of the diligence of the present compiler, Mr. 
Clark, who has himself, moreover, done very meritorious work in the direction of 
specific gravity determinations. 

The work lorms an octavo volume of 417 pages in all, and it is under consideration 
whether it may not be well, in view of the intercBt of chemists in the table and the 
demand for them, to put the sale copies in the hand of a publisher. 

660. "Miscellaneous Collections,*' Vol. xxxii. This volume is made up of the 
two works last mentioned, in the order, first, Clark's Table of Specific Gravity ; second, 
Tuckermau's Bibliography of Spectroscopic Analysis. It forms au octavo volume of 
855 pages. 

661. " Bulletin of the Philosophical Society of Washington," Vols, ix, x. Contain- 
ing the minutes of the society and of the mathematical section for the years 1886, 

1887, together with the proceedings of the Baird memorial meeting, held January 11, 

1888. The bulletin for these two years forms au octavo volume of 376 pages, embel- 
lished with a phototype likeness of Professor Baird. 

662. "Miscellaneous Collections," Vol. xxxiii. This volume consists entirely of 
the bulletins of the Philosophical Society of Washington, and is made up of No. 543. 
Bulletin, Vol. vi, for the year 1883; No. 592, Bulletin, Vol. vii, for the year 1884 ; No. 
636, Bulletin, Vol. viii, for the year 1885, and No. 661, just previously described, 
Bulletin, Vol. ix, for 1886, and Vol. x, for 1887. The following note is appended to 
the general table of contents on page 5: "With this volume (containing the last five 
volumes of the biilletins of the Philosophical Society of Washington) is terminated 
the re-issue of these proceedings in the series of Miscellaneous Collections. It may 
be stated that volumes 1, 2, and 3 of these bulletins formed Vol. xx of the Miscella- 
neous Collections; volumes 4 and 5 were included in Vol. xxv of the Miscellaneous 
Collections; and, lastly, volumes 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, together with the Memorial Pro- 
ceedings in honor of Professor Baird, and a full index of the whole ten volumes, con- 
stitute the present Vol. xxxin of the Miscellaneous Collections." This last forms in 
all an octavo volume of 910 pages, with sevca:al wood-cuta aad one plate portrait. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 101 

SMITHSONIAN ANNUAL REPORT. 

654. "Annual Report of the Bo.-ird of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution," 1885, 
Part II. This second part, being the report of the United States National Museum 
to July, 1885, has at last been received from the Government Printing Office, more 
than a year later than the first part of the report for the same period, which related 
to the operations of the Smithsonian Institution proper. This long-delayed Part ii 
consists of five sections : The first being the "Report upon the Condition and Progress 
of the U. S. National Museum during the half year ending June 30, 1885," by G. 
Brown Goode, assistant director, and occupying the first 54 pages of the work. 
The second, "Reports of the Curators aud Acting Curators of the Museum upon the 
Progress of their Work" during the period, occupying pages .55 to 146. The third, 
a " Bibliography of the Museum" during the period, iucluding the publications of 
the Museum and those of its officers aud others relative to the museum material, aud 
occupying pages 149 to 173. The fourth, a "List of Accessions to the Museum" dur- 
ing the period, together with descriptive notes and indices, occupying pages 175 to 
243. The fifth, an appendix, consisting of a very full description of the "George 
Catlin Indian Gallery in the Museum, with memoir and statistics," by Thomas Don- 
aldson, occupying 939 pages, illustrated by 142 plates and maps. This historical 
sketch (forming the greater portion of the volume) has proved to be in great popular 
denuind, the applications made for it through Members of Congress having been un- 
usually numerous, so that our stock of 7,000 copies is already nearly exhausted. The 
whole number of pages of this Part ii of the report, includiug introductory matter 
aud indices, is 1,220. If to this be added the illustrations, the aggregate would be 
eq-.ial to 1,.500 octavo pages. 

657. "Report of Prof. Spencer F. Baird, Secretary of tl)e Smithsonian Institution, 
for the year 1886-87." This last report of my lamented predecessor forms an 
octavo pamphlet of 27 pages. The volume to contain the above report, with its ac- 
companying papers and general appendix, has not yet been set up at the Govern- 
ment Printing Office. 

ISSUES OP THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

655. "Proceedings of the United States National Museum, Vol. ix, 1886." As 
already stated, this series, though priuuirily published at the expense of the Govern- 
ment by the authority of the Interior Departmeut, has heretofore beeu re-issued by 
the Smithsonian Institutiou. The preseut volume, completed and collected during 
the past year, consists of descriptive papers by James E. Benedict, T. W. Blackiston, 
George H. Boehmer, Charles H. Bollman, E. D. Cope, W. H. Dall, George E. Doering, 
Charles L. Edwards, Carl H. Eigenmann, Barton W. Evennann, Fernando Ferari- 
Perez, Morton W. Fordyce, Elizabeth G. Hughes, David S. Jordan, George N. Law- 
rence, John Belknap Marcou, William G. Masyk, George P. Merrill, Richard Rathbun, 
Robert Ridgway, John A. Rider, John B. Smith, Rosa Smith, Leonard Steineger, 
Frederick W. True, and John Grant Wells. The collection forms an octavo volume 
of 720 pages, includiug introduction aud index, and is illustrated by 25 plates, of 
which one is a chroum-lithograph. 

.565. "Bulletin of tlio United States National Museum, No. 32." This work is a 
Catalogue of Batrachians aud Reptiles of Central America ami Mexico, l)y E. D. Cope. 
The systematic catalogue is very largely based on the specimens contained in the 
National Museum. To each species is added a list of the localities at which it has 
been discovered, together with the name of the discoverer, or, in the absence of that, 
wifh the name of the author who ia responsible for the correctness of the locality. 
The total number of genera iucliulod in the catalogue is 197, aud of species 705, of 
which 135 are Batrachians and 570 Reptiliaus. The Bulletin forms a pamphlet of 98 
octavo pages. 

STEREOTYPE PLATES ON HAND. 

For many years the greater piu'tiou of the stereotype plates of Smithsonian pub- 
lications has been stored iu Philadelphia, in the fire-proof vaults of the Aea<lemy of 



102 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Natural Sciences, generously offered for that purpose. There having hecn no safe 
depository here for them, and mncli of the printing having been done iu Philadelphia, 
the plates have been allowed to remain there undisturbed. 

As the institution now has suitable store-rooms entirely fire-proof, and it is found 
that new editions of works can be priuted to better advantage in this city, thereby 
avoiding the cost of transportation of the whole editions of jiublicatious, it is pro- 
posed to bring all these plates together iu oue depository — the basement of the 
Smithsonian Building. 

It is to be regretted that the early volumes of " Smithsonian Contributions to 
Knowledge" were not stereotyped, and thus that it is impossible at the present time 
to rej)roduce full sets. 

The plates of the annual reports from 1862 to ISSfi (twenty-five years) are in pos- 
session of the Institution ; and if supplies should be wanted for libraries or individ- 
uals, an edition might at any time be ordered l)y Congress, at tlie mere cost of paper 
and press-work.

REPORT UPON INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES, UNDER THE DIRECTION OP 
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1888.

following table :

or over 40 per cent, more packages were handled than during the previous year. This 
large increase is partly oft'set by the fact that an unusually large number of the pack- 
ages received during the year just passed were single publications and of small size. 
The business of the office is set forth in detail by Exhibit A, hereto appended. 



The expense of the service for the fiscal year has been $1.5,113.7.'), of which sum 
fia,000 were voted by Congress for the support of the " international exchangea 
with foreign countries," and |20.5.7.'> were refunded by the Patent Ollice, Signal Of- 
fice, and a correspondent in South America, leaving a net deticit of $•2,1)08, which has 
been paid from the Smithsonian fnnd. 

The expenditure for the fiscal year 1888-'8t) at the present rate, making no allow- 
ance for increase in the business of the office or in the p.ay of its employds, will be 
$1G,0.'")0. If the amount estimated for Jast October, $1.'),000, shall be voted by Con- 
gress, there will be a deficit at the end of the year of at least $1,0.50, to be paid by 
the Smithsonian fund. Considering the probability that the business of the ofiice 
will continue to increase during the next fiscal year, I think it reasonable to expect 
that the deficit will amount to as much .as $-:i,000 by the :U)th of June, 1889. 

RE-IMBURSEMKNT OF EXTENSES. 

In former years a part of the deficit in the expense of transport.",tion has been re- 
paid to the Smithsonian Institution by the dilfiuent departments and bureaus of the 
Government, to which occasional appropriations have been granted by Congress for 
the purpose. During the past year such i)ayments have been made by the Signal 
Office and Patent Office, but only of a part of their indebtedness, the usual appro- 
priations to other bureaus having been omitted. The Institution has. therefore, de- 
sisted from sending bills during the year to offices of the National Government, bal- 

103

auces against which now stand on its books to the following amonuts, on the 30th of 
June, 1888 : 

Naval Observatory $94.70 

Office of Engineers, U. S. Army 16.80 

Signal Office, U. S. Army 115.97 

Geological Survey 1,922.25 

Patent Office ...\ 112.25 

Total 2,261.97 

By the terms of the pending sundry civil bill for the year ending June 30, 1889, 
the Geological Survey will have an appropriation of $5,000 " for the piirchase of neces- 
sary books for tlie library, and the payment for the transmission of public documents 
through the Smithsonian exchange." Other appropriations of a similar i»urport are to 
the Signal Office "for expenses * * * of prepaying, printing, distributing, and 
displaying weather maps, etc., |;15,000," and to the War Department ''for the trans- 
portation of charts and maps to foreign countries through the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion, $100." By the legislative and executive bill it is proposed to appropriate to the 
Naval Observatory "for payment to the Smithsonian Institution for freight on Ob- 
servatory i)ublications sent to foreign countries, $136," and to the Library of Con- 
gress "for expenses of exchanging public documents for the publications of foreign 
governments, $1,500." By the same act an indefinite part of an appropriation of $3,000 
to the Patent Office is " for the purchase of books and expenses of transporting pub- 
lications of jjatents issued by the Patent Office to foreign governments," and a simi- 
lar appropriation of $2,000 to the Bureau of Education is "for tjie distribution and 
exchange of educational documents," among other purposes. 

It appears then to have been the intention of Congress that its specific appropria- 
tion for the exchange business shall be supplemented by special appropriations to 
some of the bureaus and departments of the Government, so that the charge of 5 cents 
per pound weight, imposed by the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution in 1878, 
may be met by them. 

It is my opinion, and I therefore respectfully recommend, that this procedure, 
which had become necessary at the time of its original adoption by reason of the 
heavy annual expense of the exchanges to the Smithsonian fund, is no longer ad- 
vantageous or economical and may wisely be discontinued. The average annual 
amount collected in this way between the years 1878 and 1887 was about $1,650. Al- 
lowing for the increased business of later years $2,000 should be added to the annual 
appropriation for Exchanges. The expense to the Govei-nment would be no greater 
than it now is, while the entire cost of the Exchanges would appear in a single ap- 
propriation. By the present system the cost of the service is actually larger than aj)- 
pears in the specitic aj)propriation for Exchanges, and as the special appropriations to 
the different departments of the Government vary from year to year, and are often 
omitted altogether, an uncertain burden, which can not be accurately foreseen, is 
imposed upon the Smithsonian fund. 

CORRESPONDENTS. 

The number of correspondents has been increased during the year by 1,721 new 
names. There have been 100 losses bj'^ deaths <if individuals or discontinuance of

GRAND DUCHY OF BADEN. 

The Grand Duchy of Baden was one of the governments which were the first to 
accede to the proposition for international exchanges conveyed l)y Professor Henry's 
circular letter dated May 16, 1807, and two cases wereshippe<l to Karlsruhe through 
the Smithsonian agent at Leipzig, on the 13th of June, 187:5. After that time ex- 
changes with Baden were discontinued until the visit of Mr. George H. Boehmer, 
special agent of the Exchange Otitice and of the National Library, to Europe in 1884. 
Mr. Boehmer succeeded in procuring from the Government of the Grand Duchy a set 
of the statutes (Official Gazette) from 1803 to 1885, and the proceedings of the Diet 
since 1849. Continuation s of these series were shipped by the Government of Baden in 
August, 1887, and in February, 1888, Baden was again added to the list of governments 
rectiiving official international exchanges. Twenty-four boxes were sent thither ou 
the 29th of February, 1888, and thi'ce shipments have been made since that time. 

The number of Governments now taking part with the United States in these of- 
ficial exchanges is 41, as follows : 

Argentine Republic, England, Prussia, 

Austria, Greece, Queensland^ 

Baden, Hayti, Russia, 

Bavaria, Holland, Saxony, 

Belgium, Hungary, South Australia, 

Buenos Ayres, India, Spain, 

Brazil, Italy, Sweden, 

Canada (Ottawa), Japan, Switzerland, 

Canada (Toronto), Mexico, Tasmania, 

Chili, - New South Wales, Turkey, 

Colombia, United States of, New Zealand, Venezuela, 

Denmark, Norway, Victoria, 

France, Peru, Wurtemberg. 

North German Empire, Portugal, 

It will be observed that several of these Governments are provincial or subordinate 
members of an empire, kingdom, or republic. 

Of this number only seven, to wit, Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Servia, Spain, 
and Switzerland, have acceded to the first of the two conventions, based upon a con- 
ference of representatives of ditfereut Governments at Brussels in 188G, and now pend- 
ing before the Senate of the United States. * 

The first of the two conventions relates to the " International Exchange of official 
documents and scientific j)ublications ; " the second, to the "inmiediate exchange i>f 
tliC/ daily official journals" of legislative assemblies. 

To this second convention only six nations besides the United States have acceded, 
Switzerland withdrawing. 

These conventions have been lirought about mainly tlu'ough the active iuterest of 
the Governmeutof Belgium in the success and extension of the interuationalexchauge 
system. The history of the present agreements is of some interest in this connection, 
and has been set forth at length by Mr. George H. Boehmer in previous reports (see

year, but final ratifications have not yet been exchanged by the rei>resentatives of 
the contracting powers. 



106 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

especially Secretary's Reports for 1881, 1883, and 1887). It may be briefly summarized, 
as follows: 

The dclejjates to the luteruatioual Geographic Congress, which met at Paris in 1875, 
who were for the most part the dijilomatic representatives of the Governments par- 
ticipating, passed a unanimous resolution, on the l'2th of August, pledging themselves 
to request their Governments each to establish a bureau of International Exchanges; 
and on the '29th of January, 187(), those delegates who remained in Paris prepared 
and signed a set of rules for the management of the exchange business. At this time 
the "Bureau des ^changes" was established in Paris, under the direction of the 
liarou de Vatteville, and the rules agreed upon by the delegates and issued by this 
bureau were generally accepted by the Governments concerned, but no ratifications 
or other formal and international agreements were exchanged. England and Ger- 
many refused from the first to particijiate in either conferences or conventions relat- 
ing to international exchanges. 

With the hope of bringing about a more formal agreement, which should have the 
force and obligation of a treaty, the Government of Belgium called another conference, 
which met at Brussels in 1880, but at which the United States was not represented. 
This conference prepared an amended agreement for future consideration. 

In the year 1883 (April 10) there was another, more formal, conference at Brussels, 
at which this country was represented by Mr. Nicholas Fish, the United States min- 
ister resident. By this conference the articles prepared by the meeting of 1880 were 
revised and further amended. At the instance of France the exchange bureaus were 
relieved from the duty of collecting official publications from the several depart- 
mental offices for transmission. The articles, as amended, were agreed to by the rep- 
resentative of the United States. A second special agreement was also drawn up, 
providing for the immediate transmission of parliamentary journals, annals, and i)ub- 
lic documents, which the representative of the United States refused to sign. A 
protocol, signed by all the powers represented, stated the i)urpose of the projiosed 
conventions to be (1) the collection into a national library of each country of all 
official publications of every other; and (2) as many literary, scientific, and art 
publications as the bureaus could procure. 

The articles agreed upon lu 1883 were signed at a third Brussels conference in 1886, 
d,nd on this occasion the representative of the United S+ates, Mr. Lambert Tree, the 
minister resident, signed the additional convention providing for the immediate 
transmission of parliamentary daily journals, etc., which his predecessor had rejected 
in 1883. At this time France declined to participate further in the conferences, Eng- 
land and Germany still persisting in their refusal. As already stated, only seven 
Governments besides the United States have acceded to the general convention for 
international exchanges, and only six to the special agreement for the immediate 
exchange of the daily journals of legislative assemblies. With the thirty-four other 
Governments which take part in the international official exchanges this friendly 
conmierce will probably continue in the future as it has in the past, upon tlie basis of 
mutual agreements between the parties concerned, but without the sanction or com- 
pulsion of ti-eaty obligations. 

The jtrincipal advantage accruing from these several conferences and conventions 
has been the establishment of a certain uniformity of procedure in the transactions 
of the exchange business by the agents of the countries interested. 

The conventions themselves do not promise any definite improvement in the present 
system, from the point of view held by the Smithsonian Institution, the main stipu- 
lations for which it has contended not having been retained in the agreements now 
under consideration. These are, as stated by Professor Henry (circular letter dated 
May l(j, 18(i7), and by Professor Baird (letter to Baron de Vatteville, dated February 
8, 1879), that each exchange agency shall, (1) furnish an annual list of all the otH- 
cial publications of its Government, and (2) shall charge itself with the collection and 
forwarding of such publications. These provisions appeared in the agreement of 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 107 

1875, tbo autboisLip of wliicli is attributed principally to the representatives of 
France; were stricken out of the amended articles considered in 188:? at tiie in- 
stance of France; and in 1886 that Government declined to take further part in the 
conference. 

It is, in fact, scarcely possible for the exchange ollices of most foreign countries to 
procure all of the official publications of their Goveruments for exchange jiurposes, 
the publishing arrangements of the governmental departments being for the most 
l)art quite separate and distinct from one another, and there being no law, except in 
the United States and Belgium, requiring them to'fiirnish copies for this ))urpose. It 
is indeed extremely difiicult even for the exchange agent of a Goverment to ascer- 
tain what the official publications of the different departments and bureaus are. 

The text of the two conventions as finally agreed to by the conference of 188G is 
presented herewith as Exhibit B. 

During the past year some nnusnal pains have been taken in the efforts to increase 
the number of official publications received from foreign countries, it appearing that 
the United States Government now sends out about twenty times as many packages 
to other Governmen ts as it receives from them, and that this disproportion has been 
annually on the increase for several years past. (See Exhil)it C.) With some difli- 
culty and at the cost of much correspondence a list, still not complete, f)f French 
official publications has been compiled, containing four hundred and twenty-one titles. 
Of these tbe library of the Smithsonian Institution received during the calendar 
year 1887 thirty-nine titles .and the National Library forty-one titles. 

During the liscal year 1887-'88 three shipments were receivetl from the French Bu- 
reau des Echanges, on the Gth of June and the 8th of December, 1887, and the 12th of 
April, 1888, containing nine official packages for the Library of Congress. The num- 
ber of titles contained in these nine packages can not now be precisely stated, but 
was prolialily not greater than that received during the calendar year. 

On the other hand, there were four shipments of official publications to France 
from this country during the fiscal year, containing seven hundred and sixty-three 
packages of official publications. 

What has just been said relates only to the international exchange of official publica- 
tions, intended for the national libraries of the Governments y).nrticipating. By far 
the larger part of all of the business of this office is actually governmental business, 
a considerable proportion of the so-called " literary and scientific'' exchanges l)eing 
really an exchange of official publications between the bureaus or official subdivis- 
ions of the different Governments, for the benefit of the bureau libraries, and not for 
that of central or national libraries, as contemplated by the international agreements 
already referred to (Exhibit B). '' 

Most of the foreign Government bureaus, and of our own as well, desire to enrich 
their individual libraries, and do not regard the deposit of one set of the publications 

'These publications are .as strictly a part of the "official or governmental "ex- 
changes as are those provided for by the resolution of Congress granting fifty copies for 
foreign natioii.al libraries. While, therefore, long usage has sanctioned thedesignations 
"literary and scientilic'' and "ofticia!," in the sense explained .above, I think tiiat iu 
the interest of convenience and intelligibility, hereafter it will be bett(>r to express 
simply the distinction which really exists, namely, that between the ollici.al and un- 
oflicial exchanges, by tiie abjections " governmental " and " miscellaneous ; " meaning 
by the former all publications sent or received by the Government or its luireaiis, and 
by the latter all others. The publications of the Smithsonian Institution, which 
are partly " government.al " and partly " iniscollaueous," although divided so far as 
the exchange records and statistics are concerned, are accounted for as a whole by 
the office routine of the Institution. I am not aware of any other office or organiza- 
tion whose publications would not fall wholly within one or the other ot these 
classes. 



108 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

of other countries in the national library as an equivalent for some forty copies of their 
own pul)lications. 

If the clauses proposed by the Paris conference of 1875, and always urged by the 
Smithsonian Institution, requiring the preparation aud exchange of annual lists of 
all official publications, and that all of those named in the lists should be furnished 
to each of the contracting parties, had been retained in the convention of 1886, and if 
the convention could be faithfully executed, an effective remedy for the shortcomings 
already indicated might have been found. The opposition of some of the Governments 
participating in the conferences however (notably France and Switzerland), and 
the final withdrawal of France and continued indifference of England and Germany, 
have made this remedy imjjossible. Something lias been done during the past year, 
by perservering correspondence, aud more may doubtless be effected hereafter in the 
same way, but the most promising plan yet tried has been the employment of a 
special agent to visit the European (as the most important) Government offices, and 
excite there an interest in the subject by personal explanation and argument. Mr. 
George H. Boehmer, of this office, was employed in this way in 1884, as has been already 
stated, with the result of much larger receipts than have been shown by any one 
year before or since. After Mr. Boehmer's return, however, the temporary interest 
which his mission had excited rapidly weakened. Many sets of publications which 
had been freely promised him (notably a complete set of the publications of the 
British Government) have not been sent, mainly because of indifference, and of the 
considerable labor and time required for preparing the sets for shipment. 

It is not only foreign Governments, however, which show shortcomings in this 
matter. According to Hickox' monthly catalogue of Government publications, there 
were issued by the National Government and its bureaus, during the first six months 
of the year 1888, about eleven hundred separate titles, not considering single laws 
or articles forming parts of reports as distinct publications. While it is not possi- 
ble until the volumes of Executive Documents, Miscellaneous Documents, and Re- 
ports have been finally collected and bound, to state precisely the number of sepa- 
rate volumes as finally distributed, it is safe to say that the total number for the six 
months was greatly in excess of the number of titles furnished for official exchanges. 
Of all the Executive Departments, for example, only the Light-House Board and the 
Signal Office furnished a part of their publications for this purpose. 

The total number of separate titles furnished by the Public Printer during the six 
months for which this comparison is drawn was two hundred and ninety-five, includ- 
ing a considerable number of Army orders, reports of contested-election cases, aud 
other matter not of a kind most valuable to foreign libraries. Such a comparison as 
this can, however, only be regarded as illustrative, since the publications furnished 
by the Public Printer are always at least a year old at the time of distribution. 

The resolution of Congress, passed July 25, 1868, directing that fifty copies of every 
Government publication and every publication issued under the direction of the Gov- 
ernment, shall be placed at the disposal of the joint committee of Congress on the Li- 
brary for the purpose of the international exchanges, is sufficiently mandatory in its 
provisions, but, as above stated, has never been fully carried out. Efforts have been 
made from time to time by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution aud the Libra- 
rian of Congress, w ith the assistance and support of the State Department and of mem- 
bers of both branches of Congress, which have been set forth at length in the reports 
on exchanges attached to the Secretary's reports for 1886 and 1887. I am pleased to 
be able to report that the receipts from the Public Printer during the last six months 
of the year, far as they fall short of the full and complete distribution contemplated 
by the law, show a decided increase over the number of titles received and shipped 
in previous months aud years. The resolution is recited in Exhibit D, hereto ap- 
pended. 

As I have already said, it is not easy to get data for complete lists of the official 
publications of foreign countries, since they have not, to my knowledge, been brought 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 109 

together iii a single catalogue by any government. Snch lists are now in course of 
preparation by this office, and in April last a special card catalogue was begun of the 
titles of all foreign official publications which passed through the exchange office, so 
that by the end of another year it will be jjossible to state with some certainty which 
official publications each government gives to the international exchanges and which 
it withholds. 

EFFICIENCY OF THE SEKVICE. 

Upon assuming general control of the office (March ID, 1888), I found that complaints 
and criticisms of the efficiency of the exchange system by individuals, societies, and 
Government bureaus were not infrequent. In some instances packages from abroad, 
notification of the shipmeut of which had been long ago received, had not been de- 
livered ; in others, packages sent hence had failed to reach their destination or had 
been uureasouably delayed. Every such complaint has been promptly and diligent!}' 
follow«'d up by correspondence, with the result, in all but three instances thus far, 
of tracing the missing package and explaining the delay. It has happened, rather 
surprisingly often, that the receipt of the complaining correspondent for the package 
he writes of is on tile in this office, having been signed by some assistant in his ab- 
sence, or by himself and forgotten. In the three cases not yet settled no reply has 
yet been received from the distributing agencies to which inquiries have been ad- 
dressed. 

The fact remains, however, that there have been and are still too many and too great 
delays in the transmission of exchange matter from its place of shipment to its des- 
tination, and for this state of things there are several reasons. 

In the tirst place, delays occur in this office in forwarding packages addressed to 
countries which receive and seud but few publications (such as Hawaii, Hayti, and 
many of the Central American republics), until a sufficient number has accumulated 
to fill one of the ordinary boxes. If these packages should be forwarded as soon as 
they are received the expense would be greater than the resources of the exchange 
service could bear. But the most serious delays occur in the exchange bureaus of 
other countries. For example, in a recent experimental shipment to Loudou, Leip- 
zig, and Paris, the boxes having been shipped on the same day and accompanied by 
letters asking for immediate acknowledgments, the agents of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution at London and Leipzig reported receipt in fourteen and fifteen days, respect- 
ively, and the Bureau des fichauges at Paris in forty days. Consignments fre(|uently 
remain in the hands of foreign agencies for several months before being forwarded, 
while their consignees, having received prompt notice of their shipment from the con- 
signor, very naturally regard such delays as unreasonable and unnecessary. Delays 
of this sort are, of course, quite beyond the control of the Smithsonian Institution, 
which can do nothing to remedy them otherwise than by correspondence and per- 
suasion. Every such case is followed up as soon as brought to the notice of the of- 
fice, and I fancy that I can already perceive some imi>rovement in the promptness of 
shipmeut and some increased interest in the subject on the part of foreign corre- 
si»ondcnts. 

Another occasional causeof delay arises from the fact that the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion continues to be indebted to the generosity and public spirit of most of the ocean 
steam-ship lines for free transportation of its exchange boxes, as it has been for many 
years past. The list of transportation companies and business firms which continue 
to extend this valuable privilege has undergone no change since its publication in 
the report for l886-'87, and is reproduced as Exhibit E, hereto annexed. It naturally 
and necessarily follows from this relation between the exchange service and the 
transportation companies that boxes bearing the Smithsonian mark are shipped, for 
the most part, by slow freight, and .are subject to delays at times when paid freight 
is oilered in excess of the capacity of the steuraers. Under sj»ecial circumstances the 



110 KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 

delay may bt=^couie considerable, as, for iustance, iu the case of steamers from Naples, 
which have beeu hard pressed for space on account of the use of some of them as 
Iriinsports in the military operations of the Italian Gloverniucnt in Africa last year, 
when boxes shipped by the exchange office at Rome on December 1, 1887, were re- 
ceived in Washington on the 9th of April, 1888, having been detained meanwhile at 
Naples iu the warehouses of the steam-ship company. At this writing boxes the 
shipment of which from Rome was announced more than fonr months ago have not 
yet been received. Delays of this sort are also beyond the control of the Smithson- 
ian Institution, and will be likely to recur so long as the Institution continues to be 
unable to pay for its freight in the same way as other shippers. 

With a view to doing away with this last-named cause of delay and to establishing 
the transportation service of the international exchanges upon an assured business 
basis an estimate of the probable annual cost of the service was drawn up last May, 
based upon the usual ocean steam-ship charges and the average amount of freight 
which may be expected to be forwarded yearly to each country. The sum estimated 
was $27,050, which you jtresented to Congress as an amended estimate, through the 
honorable Secretary of the Treasury, on the 3l8t of May last, but which has not yet 
been acted upon. 

So far as my own observations extend, and, as I have every reason to believe, for a 
considerable time previous to my appointment, no avoidable delay has occurred 
either in the Smithsonian exchange bureau or in the offices of its paid agents at Lon- 
don and Leipzig. The quantity and frequency of shipments to and receipts from the 
different countries concerned iu the international exchanges are set forth as Exhibit 
F, presented herewith. 

But few changes iu the routine have been made during the year. Since last March 
a printed card has been placed in each outgoing package, stating the date of its 
shipment from the Smithsonian Institution, and re(iuesting that any unusual delay 
iu its receipt be promi>tly reported. On the 1st of June the shipping office was sep- 
arated from thereceiviug office with the result of a considerable economy of time and 
labor. Two circulars have been issued duriug the year; one ou March 2, requesting 
the bureaus of the National Government to correct and complete their list of publi- 
cations prepared in resi^onse to a circular issued in the i)revious year, and described 
in the annual report upon international exchanges for the year ending Juno 30, 1887 ; 
the other on May 31, requesting an expression of opinion from all the bureaus and 
offices of the National Government, as to the advantage to their business of increased 
speed iu trausuiittingtheir publications. Both circulars were very generally answered 
and have been the means of procuring valuable information for use in the future. 

I take pleasure iu being able to bear witness to the faithfulness and efficiency of 
the employes in the exchange office. Although the greater part of them receive a 
less compensation than employ 68 in other offices of the Government, and the duties 
which ihey perform are both laborious and responsible, the business of the office has 
not at any time been in arrears, nor has any employ6 incurred censure for misconduct 
or neglect. The foreign agencies of the exchange service, conducted by Messrs. Will- 
iam Wesley & Son at London and by Dr. Felix Fliigel at Leipzig, are also in every 
waj' satisfactory as regards promi)tness and efficiency.

His Majesty the Kiug of Servia, Mr. Marinovitch, his envoy extraordinary and

The Federal Conucil of the Swiss Confederation, Mr. Rivier, its special plenipoten- 
tiary, 

Who, after having coninuiuicated hetween themselves their fnll powers, which ar^ 
foHud in good and due form, have agreed upon the following articles: 

Article I. There shall be established iu each of the contracting states, a bureau 
charged with the duty of the exchanges. 

Art. II. The publications which the contracting states agree to exchange are the 
following: 

1st. The official documents, parliamentary and administrative, which arc published 
in the country of their origin. 

2nd. The works executed by order and at the expense of the Government. 

Art. III. Each bureau shall cause to be printed a list of the publications that it is 
able to place at the disposal of the contracting states. 

This list shall be corrected and completed each year and regularly addressed to all 
the bureaus of exchange. 

Art. IV. The bureaus of exchange will arrange between themselves the number of 
copies which they may be able eventually to demand and furnish. 

Art. V. ^he transmission shall be made directly from bureau to bureau. Uniform 
models and formulas will be adopted for the memoranda of the contents of the cases, 
as well as for all the administrative correspondence, recjuests, acknowledgments of 
reception, etc. 

Art. VI. For exterior transmissions, each state assumes theexpenseof packing and 
transportation to the place of destination. Nevertheless when the transmissions 
shall be made by sea, special arrangements will regulate the share of each state in 
the expense of transportation. 

Art. VII. The bureaus of exchange will serve, iu an official capacity, as interme- 
diaries between the learned bodies and literary and scientific societies, etc., * * » 
of the contracting states for the reception and transmission of their publications. 

It remains, however, well Understood that, in such case, the duty of the bureaus 
of exchange will be confined to the free transmission of the works exchanged, and 
that these bureaus will not in any manner take the initiative to bring about the 
establishment of such relations. 

Art. VIII. These provisions apply only to the documents and works published after 
the date of the present convention. 

Art. IX. The states which have not taken part in the present convention are ad- 
mitted to adhere to it on their request. 

This adhesion will be notified diplomatically to the Belgian Government, and by 
that Government to all the other signatory states. 

Art. X. The present convention will be ratified and the ratifications will be ex- 
changed at Brussels as soon as practicable. It is concluded for ten years from the day 
of the exchange of ratifications, and it will remain in force beyond that time, so long 
as one of the Governments shall not have declared six months in advance that it re- 
nounces it. 

In witness whereof the respective plenipotentiaries have signed it, and have there- 
unto affixed tlieir seals.

CIRCULARS RESPECTING PERIODICALS. 

circular to the curators op the u. s. national mttseum. 

March 19, 1887. 

Dear Sir: It is my desire to obtain from you (1; a list of those periodicals, whether 
fcrausactious of societies or otherwise, which you deem most nearly iudispeiisahle to 
your owu departu'.ent. This iu(|uiry is irrespective of the fact that the Museuiu does 
already possess them or not, and the list should be confined to the most essentially 
necessary titles; if possible, not over twenty in number. 

I may add, to make ray meaniug plainer, that standard transactions of well-known 
societies concerned in all branches of science, such as the Royal Society of London, 
the Coniptes Rcudus de I'Institut of Pans, etc., and well known periodicals admitting 
the discussion of all scientific topics; such as Science, the American Journal of 
Science, Nature, etc., are excluded from such a list, which is meant to cover only 
those technical periodicals of most special use to your own department. 

In addition to this list, and quite distinct from it, I should be pleased to nave you 
give .a list (2) of recent serials, whether transactions or otherwise, of interest in con- 
nection with your special investigations, even if not exclusively devoted to them. To 
be more definite, let us say anything of real import.auce or even ct)nsideral)le ]>romise 
commenced within the past twelve years. There need be no limit to the number of 
titles in this list, but the more important one should have a distinctive check; and I 
should bo very glad if it might suit your convenience to let me have it in this week 
or next. 

While the above two lists .are especially important and are desired at your earliest 
convenience, I should be pleased to have you supply me in addition with a list of 
every serial publication which a Avorker in your field may expect to have not wholly 
infi'eqnent occasion to consult; and here again I should be glad to have you indicate 
those of most value. 

S. P. Laxglky, 

Assistant Secretary. 

GENERAL CIRCULAR. 

June ir>, 1887. 

Dear Sir: The Smithsonian Institution, in pursuit of the object of its foundation, 
the ''increase and diiiusion of knowledge among men," has always aimed to keep a 
complete list of all transactions and proceedings of learned societies and of all jour- 
nals devoted to science and the useful arts thioughout the world. This, at le.-ist, is 
the aim ; but it must often fall short of the fulfillnu>nt of so large a purpose and from 
time to time find its lists need revising, and this in two different particulars. First, 
in adding to its lists new societies or new periodicals which have arisen since the 
last revisal; second, in repairing lacunar in its sets of long established society trans- 
actions or technical journals, and for this end it needs to know which still maintains 
a prominent place, so that gaps in the more important ones shall receive first atten- 
tion. 

It has been suggested to me that you are able, and may perhaps bo willing, to 
assist us by supplying under these two heads the names of those special transactions 

117 



118 . REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

or journals which you would like to see made accessible to every student of the sub- 
ject of , with which yonr own name is here associated. 

The subject of is, of course, divisible into others, such as 

, and we address ourselves to you in the hope that you cau oblige us with the 



names of auy meritorious publications, whether foreign or domestic, devoted either 
to in general, or to auy such of its subdivisions. 

To make our wants entirely clear, let me explain that the Institi\^ion does not or- 
dinarily need to be informed of the names of societies or journals dealing with all 
departments of knowledge, but only of such transactions of societies and the names 
of such journals as are concerned chiefly, if not wholly, with the subject in ques- 
tion, or which, at any rate, are frequently consulted by its special students. 

It is chiefly for such technical publications that we desire lists under the two 
heads already named. To repeat: First, of those transactions of societies or periodi- 
cals devoted to the priiicipal subject in question, or to some of its branches which 
have been established within the past twelve or fifteen years and which you know 
to bo frequently consulted ; second, of those which, being long established, are of 
now most generally recognized importance. 

I venture to address to you this* outlined plan without having any claim upon 
your kindness other than this, that the single purpose of this request is to make the 
Smithsonian Library more immediately useful to every student in yonr own depart- 
ment, and that nothing can contribute more directly to this end than your furnish- 
ing the desired list, with which, if you can oblige me, I beg we may be favored 
within the coming month. 

In case you do not feel that your time will allow you to make it complete, I beg 
you will not, on this account, refuse your help altogether, but rather that you will 
pnt down, if only imperfectly, the transactions or journals best known to you and 
which seem most desirable in connection with the general subject or with any of its 
divisions as indicated. 

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Acting Secretary.

Appendix V. 

ORGANIZATION OF LIBRARY. 

1. By act of Congress of April 5, 1866, the Library of the Smithsonian Institution 
is to be kept with the Library of Congress, but with the provision tliat the Institu- 
tion shall continue to enjoy its customary use of it. The following regulations refer 
only to those books which, under the above proviso, are retained at the Smithsonian 
Institution proper, or in its Museum Library. 

2. By order of the Secretary, after April 1, 1887, these are under the general direc- 
tion of the Assistant Secretary, in charge of the library placed in the immediate charge 
of a librarian^ whose title shall be Librarian of the Smithsonian Institution, and 
whose duty it shall be to decide what books shall be retained from the Library of 
Congress in a central library under his charge. The following regulations are in- 
tended for the better execution of the aforesaid order. 

SECTIONAL LIBRARIES. 

3. Sectional libraries may be formed by the officers of the Smithsonian In.stitution, 
namely, the assistant secretaries and the chief clerk, and also by the curators and 
acting curators and the editor. Curators and acting curators are i)ermitted, subject 
to the approval of the assistant secretary in charge of the Museum, to form sectional 
libraries to be kept in their respective offices, but this shall only be done by with- 
drawing from the general collection such books as relate exclusively to the objects 
under their care. Dictionaries, cyclopjcdias, journals, or any works o+her than such 
as relate exclusively to the special department can not forma parti, f such a sec- 
tional lil)rary, except upon the recommendation of the librarian, approved by one of 
the assistant secretaries. 

4. Tiie official in charge of each sectional library stiall be responsible for its safe 
keeping, and shall on no account lend the books. 

5. Books in the sectional library must be returned to the central library before 
they can be issued for use outside of the office or room to which they are accredited. 

6. The books of each sectional library shall be kept separate from all other books 
in the rooms of the official or curator, in distinct cases, the locks of which shall be 
controlled by a master key in the hands of the librarian, who may, at stated times, 
examine them, and call the attention of the curators to any deliciencies. 

7. No person who is not a member of tiie .scientitic staff of the Museum shall with- 
draw books or other matter witliout special written permission from one of the offi- 
cers of the Smithsonian Institution. Persons taking books from tlie central library 
shall be responsible for the safe keeping of the same, and shall make good any losses. 
They shall not be allowed to withdraw other books until those which are lost have 
been restored. 

8. The librarian shall have authority to decide what books are snit^ible for any 
curator's sectional library, and to recall any book not in a sectional library within 
two weeks. Permanent recalls of books from sectional libraries may be made, :is 
well as temporary calls. In case of certain rare or costly or encyclopodic works, or 
in other special instances, the librarian shall be authorized to designate books 
•which shall in no case be taken from the library. This regulation shall not apply to 

Hi) 



120 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

any books now actnally in the office of t.lie editor. All books and other matter not 
in the sectional library shall bo at all times subject to recall by the librarian. 

9i. The librarian will be expected to exercise his discretion as to the books to be 
withdrawn from the Congressional Library, but will (in the absence of special cause 
to the contrary) recall any book upon receiving a written request for the same. 

10. The librarian shall annually, or oftener, report to the Assistant Secretary, in 
charge of the library, any defective series^ any missing books, or any new serials, or 
books which are specially desirable. 

REGULATIONS CONCERNING ENTRY AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF BOOKS. 

11. All books, jiamphlets, periodicals, maps, and other publications acquired by 
the Smithsonian Institution through exchange or donation or purchase shall be 
separately entered by the librarian, who shall prepare .i reference list, with the aid 
of which he Shall immediately upon their receipt from the chief clerk divide them 
into two classes, one of which is to be fully entered within a day of its receipt ; the 
other to be fully entered in any case at some time within the current week. 

12. It shall be an invariable rule that such a full entry, to consist of both a day- 
book and a ledger-account entry, shall be made within the above-specified time for 
every separate book, or pamphlet or map, without exception ; but it is understood 
that this ledger account may be in the form of a card catalogue. 

13. Against every title there shall be entered in the day-book the letter "C" 
(Smithsonian Library, deposited in Library of Congress), or "G" (Smithsonian Li- 
brary, deposited with Surgeon General), or " I " (Smithsonian Library, deposited at the 
Institution) ; and it shall be the duty of the librarian to see that all books of the first 
class are prepared for delivery to the Librarian of Congress within the current week. 

14. The librarian shall notify the exchange department within the current week of 
any new correspondent on his books, and shall also acknowledge receipt to the senders 
or donors of every article at stated times, at intervals of not more than a year, and 
shall make a record of such entry, with the date of acknowledgment opposite to the 
entry of the work in question. 

15. It shall be the dutj' of the librarian at .ill times to hold these books open to the 
inspection of the Librarian of Congress, and to report to him the place and condition 
of any work under his charge in answer to any specific inquiry. 

16. In addition to the books which are included in the Smithsonian deposit in the 
Library of Congress, and so stamped, there are certain books procured by the Smith- 
sonian Institution for use in the National Museum. These shall be distinctively 
marked ; and it is understood that while they form no jjart of the above-described 
books of the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress, they are in other re- 
spects to be treated in accordance with the above regulations. No book or chart 
belonging to the Smithsonian Institution is exempt from them unless procured for 
the specific use of an officer of the Smithsonian, as above designated, and distinctively 
stamped as belonging to his office. 

The above rules will take effect on and after this date. 

S. P. Langley, 
Assistant Sec/i'etarij, in charge of Library. 

Note (added December 3, 1887). — Under the last clause come books purchased es- 
pecially for the office of the Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or chief clerk, forming 
"office libraries," and for these it is understood that the librarian's responsibility 
ceases when he has distinctively stamped each, entered it distinctively on the card 
catalogue, and also in a separate list catalogue. Indispensable books of reference in 
exchange department, etc.^ form part of chief clerk's office library. 

S. P. Langley, 

Secretary. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 121 

Note (added February 13, 1888). — Tliis last clause above cited is to be uuderstood 
as includiug the books purchased at tlie expense of the Museum appropriation, but 
uot uecessarily books obtained by exchange for Museum publications, as it would 
be difficult, if not impossible, always to discriminate these under our present system. 
This point is reserved for future consideration, but provisionally it is uuderstood that 
the librarian is to send books to the Library of Congress if not evidently meant for 
the Museum. 

S. P. Langley, 

Secretary.

RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 
ASTRONOMY FOR 1887, 1888. 



By William C. Wixlock. 



The followiug- record of tUe progress of Astronomy duriiig the years 
1887 aud 1888 is ijresented in essentially the form adopted by Professor 
Holden in 1879. It is thought that this form is most suitable for an 
annual record, as it furnishes a series of reference notes for those espe- 
cially interested in the study of astronomy", and at the same time a con- 
densed review for the general reader. 

The writer has made free use of reviews and abstracts which have 
appeared in tbe Bulletin Astronomique, the Observatory, Nature, the 
Athenaium, and other periodicals. 

COSMOGONY. 

Dr. Carl Braun, S. J., formerly director of the Kalocsa Observatory, 
has collected in a book of 1G7 pages a series of essays, first published 
in the Catholic periodical Natur und Offenbarung in 1885-'8G, in which 
he enters into a scientific discussion of the evolution of the universe, 
more particularly the formation of the sun aud planets. His theory 
demands a structureless, motionless, tenuous nebula, its particles en- 
dowed with gravity and atomic repulsion. Such a nebula, if perfectly 
homogeneous, should give birth to one portentous solitary sun. But, 
in point of fact, it would possess innumerable, almost imperceptible, 
local irregularities, which, forming so many centers of attraction, would 
eventually lead to the breaking up of the nebula into a vast multitude 
of separate fragments. On one of these, the destined progenitor of the 
solar system, we are asked to concentrate our attention. The manner 
of its development is, however, a widely difierent one from that traced 
by Laplace, who assumed the needful rotation and left the rest to work 
itself out spontaneously. Dr. Braun, on the other hand, assumes less 
to begin with, but invokes adventitious aid in emergencies, lie ascribes 
the rotation of the original solar nebula to the impact of masses drawn 
in from the depths of space, comet-like projectiles, endowed with energy 
external to the system. These mitsses would affect the outer shell cou- 

125 



126 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

stitutinjT^ tlie nebula more tban tliey would the inner, and the result is 
a central condensation surrounded by an ellipsoidal atmosphere revolv- 
ing with increasinj;' velocity as we proceed outwards from the center. 
Instead of supitosin*^ that tlie planets are formed from rinj^s detached 
from this nebula by over spinning, Braun assumes that their formation 
is determined simply by centers of condensation which existed in the 
nebula itself. These formations have commenced at distances from the 
central nucleus much greater than the present distances of the planets, 
and the immediate result is an approach to the sun within a distance 
at which its attraction is balanced by the outward gaseous pressure and 
the centrifugal force. The incipient planet, animated with the greater 
angular velocity of the stratum to which it originally belonged, revolves 
now at a rate slightly superior to that of the new medium in which it 
finds itself. Hence the possibility of its sweeping up and annexing 
fresh matter as it ])roceeds along the coils of its narrowing orbit, until 
a point is reached when the planet, or even sun, has drawn in all the 
matter which stood in its way, and gravity alone exactly balances cen- 
trifugal force. The planet then revolves in an orbit sensibly the same 
as at present. 

As the planet in approaching the sun has encountered strata of in- 
creasing density, so that the tangential resistance on the side towards 
the sun has always been greater than on the opposite side, it is easy to 
see that a planetary or " direct" rotation must be set up in the direction 
of revolution. In order to explain the rotation of Ne[)tune, which is 
probably, like its satellite, retrograde, it is necessary to sui)pose that 
the birth of the planet was preceded by the formation of a ring, while 
Uranus is regarded as a "limiting instance" between the annular and 
the nuclear methods of generation. 

Ingenious explanations are derived for the rapid motion of Phobos, 
the inner satellite of Mars, for the swifter rotation of the larger planets, 
and for the increase in their density and decrease in their mass as we 
approjich the sun. Mars is an exception; but there are reasons for 
thinking it of later formation, so that when it came into existence the 
space allotted for its growth was already greatly exhausted, owing 
chiefly to the powerful attraction of Jupiter. 

While many of Father Braun's conclusions will not be accepted by 
cosmogonists, his work forms an able contribution to the subject. Its 
a[>pearance may be said to mark the definite abandonment by sound 
thinkers of the annular method of planet and satellite formation, and 
gradually it is becoming clear that " while the various members of the 
solar family owned unquestionably a common origin, they can scarcely 
be said to have had a common history." 

Janssen delivered an interesting discourse bearing upon the same sub- 
ject at Paris, October 25, 1887 — "The age of the stars," in which he 
reviewed the steps leading us to the belief that each star must have a 
beginning, a period of activity, a decline, and an end} and ho points

out tbat ui)on (he hypothesis that stars of higher temperature will last 
longer than stars of lower, we must conclude, from the testimony of the 
spectroscojie, that Sirius, Vega, and the greater number of the stars 
visible to the naked eye are in their youth, while Aldebaran, Arcturus,

Dr. Dreyer's new general catalogue of nebuhie and clusters of stars is 
essentially a new edition of Sir John Herschel's catalogue, revised, cor- 
rected, and brought down to December, 1887. It therefore forms a com- 
plete list of all known nebuhe, and is of the greatest value to observ^ers. 
Herschel's General Catalogue was published iu 1864 aud contained 5,071) 
objects. D'Arrest's work, published three years later, gave the means 
of correcting many of the errors in the earlier observations, and in 187G 
Dr. Dreyer compiled a supplement from the material at that time avail- 
able. Recent discoveries have giveu rise to a demand for a second sup- 
plement which has been wisely met by recasting the whole work. "The 
piesent catalogue contains 7,840 objects, the positions being given in 
right iiscension co seconds of time and iu declination to tenths of a min- 
ute of arc. The epoch of the lirst general catalogue aud of D'Arrest's 
final i)ositions — 18G0— has been retained ; precessions are given for 1880. 
There is an index to published figures of nebuhe and clusters, and an 
appendix giving the places of new uebuhc published too late to be in- 
corporated in the catalogue itself. Further additions iu numbers or iu 
accuracy of positions might, perhaps, now be made from the recently 
published lists of Bigourdan, von Engelhardt, Ginzel, Stone, and Swift. 

The largest refractor devoted almost exclusively to the observation of 
nebuUe is the 2tJ-iuch equatorial of the Leauder McCormick Observatory. 
Professor Stone's object is to obtain .is accurate positions as possible 
and thus to estal)lish the means of detecting the proper motion of these 
objects if any exists. His working list embraces all nebuhe north of 
—30° which are as bright as the fourteenth magnitude. 

Dr. Dreyer has submitted to a rigid examination all reported cases 
of variability or proper motion in nebuhe, and concludes that iu not 
one case can either be considered as well established. It seems that 
the only well-authenticated changes are changes of brightness only, 
while we so far do not possess any clear evidence of change of form or 
change of place. 

Detection of new nebuhv by liliotoffraphi/. — Vioi'essov Tickeriug in order 
to test the efficacy of photograihhy in the discovery of new nebuhe has 
compared the number of nebuhe shown in a series of photograi)hs of 
the regions about the great nebuhe iu Orion with the number in the 
same region giveu by Dreyer's catalogue. The instrument employed 
was the Bache telescope, which has a photographic doublet with an 
aperture of 8 inches and focal length of 44 inches. Each plate covered 
a region 10 degrees square, the great ucl)ula' t)eing about the center;

tbe definition was good in a central circnlar area about 7 degrees ia 
diameter. Fourteen of the objects pliotograpbed are contained in 
Dreyer's catalogue; four in tbe catalogue are not pbotograpbed; twelve 
tbat are pbotograpbed are not in tbe catalogue. Professor Pickering 
concludes tbat in carrying out tbe same proportion we migbt expect 
to discover four or five thousand sucb objects by i)botograpbing tbe 
wbole sky; but, be adds, ''tbere is one consideration tbat may seriously 
modify tbis conclusion. Tbe successive improvements in photography 
have continually increased tbe limits of tbe nebula in Orion. These 
plates show tbat it not only includes tbe sword-handle, c, /, and ^/, but 
a long nebulosity extends south from C, others surround tbis star, while 
others, botb north and south, indicate that perbaps the next increase 
in sensitiveness of our plates will join them all in a vast nebula many 
degrees in length." 

Herr von Gotbard has obtained extraordinary results witb a 10-incli 
reflector. His photographs, though small, show a great richness of de- 
tail; several of them arc reproduced in an article by Dr. Vogel, in No. 
2854 of tbe Nacbricbten. Tbe photographs of clusters Dr. Vogel was 
able to enlarge without great difficulty, but for the nebulae it was neces- 
sary to resort to drawings; among the latter tbe reproduction of a 
l)botograpb of tbe spiral nebula in Canes Venatici is particularly inter- 
esting. 

The Ring Nebula in Lyra. — Professor Holden reports tbat nearly all 
tbe nebuli3B examined witb tbe 30 inch Lick telescope show a multitude 
of new details of structure. In the King Nebula in Lyra, for example, 
Lassell's 4 foot retlector and tbe Washington 26 inch refractor show 
thirteen stars in an oval outside tbe ring, and only one star within it, 
wbile tbe Lick glass shows twelve stars within the ring or projected on 
it, and renders it obvious tbat tbe nebula consists of a series of ovals 
or ellipses — first tbe ring of stars, then the outer and inner edges of tbe 
nebulosity; next a ring of taint stars round tbe edges of the inner ring, 
and last a number of stars situated on tbe various parts of tbe nebu- 
losity and outer oval. 

Mr. lioberts' photographs of the Eing Nebula in Lyra, tbe Great 
Nebula in Andromeda, and others, also require special mention. 

The Great Nehula in Orion. — In the spectrum of this nebula, Dr. Cope- 
land has observed a new line apparently identical with D3, wave-length 
587.4. Tiie occurrence of tbis line in tbe spectrum of a nebula is of 
great interest as affording another connecting link between gaseous 
nebulfc and tbe sun and stars witb bright-line spectra, especially witb 
tbat remarkable class of stars, of which tbe first examples were de- 
tected by Wolf and Kayet in tbe constellation Cygnus. 

The Pleiades. — The initial volume of publications of tbe Yale Observa- 
tory is a valuable memoir by Dr. W. L. Elkin on tbe positions of tbe 
principal stars in tbe Pleiades as determined witb tbe new Yale beliom- 
eter, and it is, we believe, tbe first beliometer work done in this c(mn- 



ASTRONOMY. 12i) 

t^3^ Dr. Elkiii has taken in all the stars in the Dnrcliransterungdown 
to 9.2 magnitude, which may reasonably be said to fall within tlie group, 
and in so doing he has rejected one of the stars used by Bessel in his 
celebrated work with the Konigsberg heliometer as too faint for accu- 
rate measurement, but he has added seventeen stars to Bessel's list of 
fifty-three, so that he has taken sixty-nine stars in all. Two practically 
independent methods of measurement were adopted. The first plan 
was to measure the distance of each star of the group from each one of 
four reference stars situated so as to form a quadrilateral symmetrically 
placed about the group; the position of each star thus depended on 
measures of distance alone. The second plan was to measure the posi- 
tion-angle and distance of each star from -q Tauri or Alcyone, the cen- 
tral star of the group. The work on the quadrilateral plan was com- 
menced in March, 1884, and lasted to December — the measures from r) 
Tauri occupied the first three and last four months of 1885, the mean 
epoch of the second triangulation falling about a year later than that 
of the first. Dr. Elkin gives a brief description of the instrument with 
his method of using it, and this is followed by a determination of the 
instrumental constants and by the observations in detail. The defini- 
tive results are then critically compared with Bessel's heliometer work 
and with the filar micrometer measures of Wolf at Paris and Pritchard 
at Oxford. The comparison with the Konigsberg observations shows 
that for the six largest stars there is a striking community of mo- 
tion, both in direction and in amount, and it is remarkable that this 
general direction of drift is very similar to the reversed absolute motion 
of Alcyone as given by Newcomb. Dr. Elkin thinks the coincidence is 
sufficiently close for two of the stars at least, and possibly for the other 
four, to warrant the conclusion that they are only optically members of 
the group. Of the remaining twenty-six of the thirty-two stars show- 
ing some displacement since 1840, the epoch of Bessel's catalogue, the 
distribution of the direction of motion is by no means equable, six stars 
only having an easterly- motion, while twenty move towards the west, 
and here too there seems to be a tendency to community of drift in cer- 
tain groups in the same part of the cluster. 

''The general character of the internal motions of the group appears 
to be thus extremely minute. If for the six stars mentioned as with 
more or less probability not belonging to the group this proves to be 
the case, there are but five stars for which the displacement amounts to 
over one second in forty-five years. The bright stars especially seem 
to form an almost rigid system, as for only one is there really much evi- 
dence of motion, and in this case (star h) the total amount is barely one 
second per century. The hopes of obtaining any clew to the internal 
mechanism of this cluster seem therefore not likely to be realized in an 
immediate future." 

Professor Hall has measured with the L'O inch Washington refractor 
the positions of sixty-three small stars in the groiij) relatively to the 
U, Mis, 142 — -9

bri.iiliter stars deterniiiied by Bcssel and Elkiu, thus fuinisliing further 
data for testing in the future anj- movement that may be going on in 
the system. 

Since the discovery of the nebuhi in the Pleiades around the star 
Maia, the Henrys have been at work i)erfecting their apparatus, and 
upon repeating their examination of the Pleiades with an exposure of 
four hours, and very sensitive plates, they have defined with considera- 
ble detail a great mass of cosmic matter covering a large part of the 
group. The most interesting detail is a straight nebulous filament 35' 
to 40' long and only 3" to 4" wide projecting from the main mass in an 
east and west direction. This filament passes over seven stars, which 
it seems to connect like beads on a string; a slight change in direction 
takes place where it meets the largest star. The plate contains nearly 
twice as many stars as the first plate — about 2,000 down to the eight- 
eenth magnitude. 

Excellent photographs of the Pleiades have also been taken by Mr. 
Koberts near Liverpool with an 18-inch silvered-glass reflector. 

ASTRONOMICAL CONSTANTS. 

Constant of precession. — Dr. Liidwig Struve has deduced a new value 
of the constant of precession and the motion of the solar system in space 
from an elaborate comparison of recent Pulkowa catalogues with Brad- 
ley's observations as reduced by Auwers, thus obtaining an interval of 
a century — 1755.0 to 1855.0 — for the determination of proper motions. 
These proper motions, computed with O. Struve's precession constant 
(of 1811), were affected by the apparent displacement due to the motion 
of the solar system in space and by the error of the assumed precession 
constant. 

They thus furnished a means of determining these two quantities. 
After rejecting seven stars which seem to be exceptionally near us, the 
remaining 2,509 are divided into 120 groups, forming 210 equations of 
condition to be solved by least squares for the determination of the five 
unknowns, the co-ordinates X, Y, Z of the sun's "goal" (or point in 
space towards which the sun is traveling, to adopt the term introduced 
by Professor Newton) and the corrections Aw and An to Bessel's con- 
stants. The following table shows the resulting value of the luni-solar 
precession compared with that of previous calculators:

Dreyer 50. 3820 L. Strnve 50. 3514 

At the end of the paper the author treats of the planetary precession 
and the secular variation, and gives a list of stars whose proper mo- 
tions as found by him differ from those deduced by Auwers from Green- 
wich and Berlin observations. The results obtained for the motion of 
the solar system are quoted elsewhere in this report. 



ASTRONOMY. 131 

Constant of aberration. — Ilerr Kiistner of tlie Berlin Observatory has 
made a U«terinination of the constant of aberration with a 4.^ inch 
broken-back, universal instrument, employing what is commonly known 
in this country as Talcott's method. His result is a correction of — 0".132 
to Struve's constant of aberration with the small probable error of 
±0",011. A further exhaustive discussion of the observations has led 
tlic author to conclude that the latitude of his instrument in the spring 
of 1864 was 0".204±0".02l greater than in the spring of 1885— im- 
poitant evidence upon the mooted question of the variability of ter- 
restrial latitudes. 

Professor Hall has recently reduced a series of observations of a 
LyriQ made with the prime vertical instrument at the XJ. S. Naval Ob- 
servatory between the years 1862 and 1867. These observations had 
been designed to give corrections to the a-ssumed values of the constants 
of nutation and aberration, and an absolute determination of the paral- 
lax of the star. The series was not continued for a sufficient period for 
the first purpose, and a preliminary examination having shown that a 
negative parallax would result, the work has been set aside till the 
present time. The mean resulting parallax from the 436 observations 
is ;r=-0".079±0".0134, and the constant of aberration = 20".4506± 
0".O142. 

On account of the uncertainty in the parallax, Professor Hall has in- 
troduced a parallax of +0".15, about the mean value indicated by nu- 
merous observations of this star, and he then obtains a constant of 
aberration =^20".4542i0".014t. To this result he gives the preference 
and deduces for the solar parallax 8".810rt0".0062, adopting Hansen's 
value of the mean anomaly of the earth and eccentricity, Clarke's value 
for the equatorial radius of the earth, and Michelsou and Newcomb's 
determination of the velocity of light, 186,325 miles per second. 

Herr jSTyr^u has found in a discussion of the Pulkowa observations 
of the diflference of right ascension between Polaris and its companion, 
evidence to confirm the hypothesis, upon which determinations of the 
aberration constant rest, that the velocity of light is independent of 
the state whether of motion or rest of the luminous body. 

On the other band the experiments of Michelsou and iVForley seem to 

throw some doubt upon Fresnel's hypotheses that the ether is at rest 

except in transparent media, and that there it participates in the motion

of translation in the ratio — 5—, n being the index of refraction. 

n- ' ° 

Loewy's method of determining the constant of aberration from differ- 
ential measurements of the changes in the distances of suitably-chosen 
pairs of stars is to be tested at the Paris Observatory with an equatorial 
cou<le, and by Professor Oomstock at the Washburn Observatory with 
suitable apiKiratus fitted to the 6-inch equatorial. The method is essen- 
tially to bring tlu^ two stars, which may he, say, 00 degrees ajtart in the 
sky, into the field of an eipiatorial by reflection from the surfaces of a 



132 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

doable mirror at the objective : any chanfje ia the distance between the 
two stars can then be measured with extreme nicety. It should perhaps 
be mentioned that Houzeau claimed to have suggested this principle in 
1871. 

Diurnal mdation. — M. Niesten, in applying Folie's formulae for diurnal 
nutation to the Greenwich observations of y Draconis, has found a posi- 
tive parallax where Main and Downing obtained a negative value, and a 
constant of aberration more closely agreeing with that generally adopted. 
Introducing similar corrections in Hall's discussion of the prime verti- 
cal observations of a Lyme has, however, had no appreciable effect. 

STAR- CATALOGUES AND CHARTS. 

Paris Catalogue. — The first two volumes of the great work undertaken 
by Leverrier a third of a century ago, the re observation of the stars of 
Lalande's catalogue, have recently been published. The first volume is 
the first installment of the catalogue proper, viz, stars from 0^' to 0'' of 
right ascension, observed during the years 1837 to 1881; the second 
volume gives the separate observations. Each series when complete 
will extend to four volumes. The observations were made with the five 
meridian instruments of the Paris Observatory, and include some 20,000 
or 30,000 observations made between 1837 and 1854; they have there- 
fore been divided into three periods, 1837-'53, 1854-'G7, and 1808-81, 
and severally reduced to the mean epochs 1815, 1860, or 1875. Obser- 
vations subsequent to 1881, about one-fourth of the entire number, will be 
published separately. The present section of the catalogue contains 
7,245 stars, and represents about 80,000 observations in both elements. 
It gives for each of the three j^eriods the number of observations, the 
mean date, the right ascension and north polar distance reduced to the 
mean epoch, and a comparison with Lalande. The precessions for 1875 
are also added. The introduction, by M. Gaillot, who has superin- 
tended the reduction, contains a discussion of the probable errors of the 
observations, and is followed by a comparison of the present catalogue 
with Auwers' Bradley, and an important investigation by M. Bcssert 
of the proper motions of a large number of stars, followed by a table of 
errors in Lalande's catalogue which the present and other catalogues 
have brought to light. 

Ginchinati Zone Catalogue. — Professor Porter has publishe<l the re- 
sults of observations made with a 3-inch transit instrument, at the Cin- 
cinnati Observatory, upon 4,050 stars between the declinations —18° 50' 
and —22° 20', during the years 1885 to 1887. The faintest stars were of 
about 8.5 magnitude, and nearly all the stars were observed three times. 
The observations were made in zones, the telescoi)e being clamped. 
The transits which were recorded by the chronograph were generally 
taken over five wires, and two bisections were made in declination when- 
ever time allowed. Tlie i)robable errors of m single observation are 
± 0M23 and ± l."84. An appendix gives the proper motion of sev- 
enty-five stars deduced from a comparison with other catalogues. 



ASTRONOMY. 133 

DunsinJc Catalogue. — The sixth part of the Diiusiuk observations is 
devoted to a catalogue of 1,012 stars, between — 2° and — 23° declina- 
tion, observed witii the meridian circle from 188 L to 1885. The standard 
stars employed are those of the Berlin Jahrbuch, and the observations 
are reduced to Auwers' system. The mean right ascensions and decli- 
nations, with the annual precessions for the epoch 1885.0, the mean 
epoch, and the number of observations are given. 

Pulkowa. — Volume xii contains a catalogue for 1865.0 of the principal 
stars, to thefourth magnitude — 381 in number — as far as 15 degrees south 
declination deduced from observations in the years 1801-1872. Tlie for- 
mation of a catalogue of these stars for the epoch 1845.0 was the first 
piece of work completed by this observatory, and the present work is 
thus enhanced in value by being an almost exact repetition of that un- 
dertaken twenty years before. 

Auicers'' new reduction of Bradley. — The third volume of Auwers' new 
reduction of Bradley, which has been five years in going through the 
press, was finally published in 1888. This volume contains, in addition 
to the catalogue proper, tables giving the quantities in the reduction to 
the apparent place that depend upon the star's position, and a compar- 
ison of Bradley's positions, reduced to 1805, with Berlin and Greenwich 
observations of about the same date. The catalogue contains 3,208 
stars, and gives for each star the magnitude, right ascension, and dec- 
lination for 1775.0, corrections to the Fundamenta of Bessels, number of 
observations, epoch, precessions for 1755, 1810, and 1805, proper mo- 
tions, references to Greenwich catalogues, and to double-star cata- 
logues, where the star was double, and a column of notes. 

An important list of 480 stars to be used as fundamental stars for 
zone observations between —20° and —80° declination, is published 
by Dr. Auwers in the Monthly Notices for June, 1887. 

Dr. 0. II. F. Peters lias contributed two valuable papers to the third 
volume of the Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences; the first 
is a critical examination of all data bearing on Flamsteed's twenty-two 
"missing" stars, for each of which a plausible explanation is found; 
and the second paper is a list of corrigenda in the catalogues, O. Arg. 
S., Bonn vi, Weisse (1 and 2), Kiimker, Schjellerup, Baily's Lalande 
zones, Yaruall, Glasgow, Santiago, and Geneva. 

A very useful index to stars in Airy's six Greenwich catalogues not 
found in Flamsteed — the work of Miss Lamb — will be found in the 
fifth volume of publications of the Washburn Observatory. 

Astronomische Geselhchaft Zones. — The following notes condensed 
from the reports presented at the meeting of the Gesellschaft in August, 
1887, show the progress of the work at that time:

Lave been undertaken in the United States— 9° 50' to— 14° 20' at 
Cambridge and —13° 50' to —IS© 10' at Washington. 

Star-charts. — Sections in and iv of the Southern Durchmust^rung 
charts (sheets 48, 53-G3) have been published, bringing to a close that 
most valuable work. Professor Schoufeld has issued with these last 
numbers a short list of errata detected, which is reprinted in No. 2834 
of the Nachrichten. 

A series of charts embracing all the stars visible to the naked eye — 
that is, down to about the sixth and one-half magnitude — has been pub- 
lished by Mr. Cottam, and has been very highly complimented. There 
are in all thirty-six sheets, the scale being one-third of an inch to one 
degree of a great circle. Another useful book of the same kind is 
Klein's New Star-Atlas, which has appeared in both English and Ger- 
man editions. There are eighteen maps, containing about the same 
number of stars as Mr. Oottam's, and giving also alt the nebulae and 
clusters visible in telescopes of moderate power — a great help to comet 
hunters. 

STELLAR PARALLAX. 

Parallax of a Tauri. — Prof. Asaph Hall has published in No. 156 of 
the Astronomical Journal, a determination of the parallax of a Tauri 
from a series of observations with the 26-inch Washington equatorial, 
extending from October 2, 1886, to March 15, 1887. The comparison- 
star was an eleventh magnitude companion distant about 116", in posi- 
tion angle 34o.5. The resulting values of the relative parallax are: 
From measures of position angle, 7r=-f 0".163±0".0409; and from 
measures of distance, 7r= + 0".035±0".0431. The mean value of the 
l)arallax of a Tauri from these observations is, therefore, ;r=0".102± 
0".0290. 

Prof. O. Struve, using the same comparison-star, recently obtained a 
value nearly five times as great, namely, 7r=0".516±0".057. 

Parallax of 2 1510.— Dr. L. de Ball, of the observatory of the Univer- 
sity of Liege, has determined in a similar manner the parallax of the

brifjbter component (wliich Las a sensible proper motion) of tbis optic- 
ally double star. From measures of position angle be finds 7r=-\-()"A)i)l 
±0".013; and from measures of distance, ;r=r+0".112i0".010. Tbe 
mean result is 7r=+0".104±0".008. 

Parallax 0/ 22398. — xi new investigation of tbe parallax of tbe double 
star 2 2398 bas been made by Dr. Lamp, based upon observations be- 
tween May 20, 1885, and Marcb 15, 1887. In tbis be not only obtains 
a very satisfactory confirmation of bis i^revious value of tbe parallax 
(0".34) of tbe larger star, but be is able to sbow tbat tbe two stars are 
at practically tbe same distance. For tbe principal star lie finds tbe 
annual parallax equal to 0".3520±0".0140; for tbe smaller, 0".3548 
i0".0131; or for tbe mean, 0".353±0".014. Tbe magnitudes are 8.7 
and 8.2, respectively, and tbe common proper motion about — 0M7 in 
rigbt ascension, and -fl".90 in declination annually. 

Parallax of firstmagnitude stars in the northern hemisphere. — Dr. El kin

spliere, and summarizes bis results in tbe following table:

Tbe mean of tbe ten parallaxes gives for tbe mean parallax of a first-

The probable errors include an estimation of the probable systematic 
error of the measures. They are therefore considerably larger than 
those generally assigned to sucb results, which, as a rule, only take into 
account tbe mere casual error of observation. 

It will be seen on inspection of the table that of the ten stars six 
may be said to give indications of a measurable parallax, but in only 
two cases, a Canis Minoris and (v Aquihe, are the values in any degree 
remarkable, and these confirm closely results of former investigators; 
Auwers and Wagner having obtained 4-0".240 i0".029and +0".209 
i0".038 respectively for Procyon, and W. Struve +0".181 i0".094 for 
Altair. On the otber baud, the next two largest results, those for

a Bootis and a Auriga^, do not confirm the large values found by 
O. Struve, -fO".51G and -|-0".30r); but in the ease of the former star 
there is 5i close agreement with Hall, who got +0".102 ±0".030, and 
there seems to be but little doubt that the Pulkowa value is largely 
in eiror. 

Of the four stars where the parallactic displacement has been inap- 
jireciable, Arcturus, with its large proper motion of over 2", second 
only to that of a Centauri in all of the 200 brightest stars down to the 
fourth magnitude, is especially note-worthy. The minuteness of the 
parallax is beyond doubt, depending, as it does, on five pairs of com- 
parison stars, all in reasonable agreement, and it can not be considered 
as seriously at variance with the results previously obtained by Peters 
and Johnson, -fO'M27 ±0".073 and -f0".138 ±0".052 respectively, 
when their liability to systematic error is taken into account. The Yale 
result for a Lyrae does not fall in weir with those hitherto deduced for 
this star. If we commence at the epoch of W. Struve and neglect the 
earlier attempts to find the absolute parallax, we have the following list 
of values:

of the Oxford University Observatory, pursuing his experimental work

Professor Pritchard lays stress upon the fact that each i)hotographic 
plate must be considered as carrying its own scale; and, due regard 
beiug paid to the unavoidable, though slight, variations of scale in the 
different plates, he is of opinion that in this delicate class of work pho- 
tography will give as accurate results as any other known method. 

For 61 Cygni the value given rests upon the measurement of three 
hundred and thirty plates, taken upon eighty-nine nights ; each com- 
ponent was referred to four comparison stars. On each of fifty-three 
nights four photographic plates were taken of p. CassiopciC, the ex- 
posures varying from five to ten minutes. Experiments seemed to indi- 
cate, however, that sufficiently approximate results, with a great saving 
of labor, wouhl be obtained by confining the observations to about five 
nights in each of four periods of the year indicated by the position of 
the parallactic ellipse. Professor Pritchard proposes to apply this 
method systematically to all those stars between magnitudes one and 
one-half and two and one-half which attain at Oxford a suitable alti- 
tude ; and he hopes to obtain good results for all of these stars that have 
a parallax not less than the thirtieth of a second of arc. 

DOUBLE AND MULTIPLE STARS. 

Extension of the law of gravitation to stellar systems. — Professor Hall, 
in a discussion of this question in the Astronomical Journal, after a re- 
view of the various speculations upon the subject, says : " The weakness 
of the proof that the ISTewtonian law governs the motions of double 
stars arises from two sources. In the first place, the errors of obser- 
vation have a large ratio to the quantities measured. This condition 
makes it difficult to compute the orbits with much accuracy, or we may 
satisfy the observations with very different elements. - - - The 
insufficiency in the data can only be removed by further observation. 
Since there is no theoretical difficulty in the way, the continuation of 
the observations of double stars and the improvement of methods of ob- 
servation will, in time, give the means for tlic accurate determination 
of their apparent orbits. The theoretical difliculty in proving the law 
of Newton ftn- double stars can not be overcome. But we can increase 
the probability of the existence of this law l)y determining more orbits 



138 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

and those that arc very diifereutly situated. If the law prove satis- 
factory in all cases, we shall have a probability of its universality in- 
creasing Avith the progress of astronomy." But, although this proba- 
bility may be verj^ great, it can not constitute a i^roof offering the char- 
acter of experimental certainty which clothes the law of Newton itself 
in our planetary system. 

A serious difticnlty is encountered in the enormous velocities with 
which quite a number of stars appear to be moving through space, "run- 
away" Groombridge — 1830, ji Cassiopea;, y5 Hydri, a Bootis, and others. 
Some of these velocities are comparable to that of a comet in close prox- 
imity to the sun, but in most cases there is no visible object near the 
one in motion to which Ave can ascribe an attractive force, acting accord- 
ing to the Newtonian law, which would produce the velocity observed, 
unless we assume enormous masses. 

An interesting article upon this subject is contributed by M. Tisse- 
rand to the Bulletin Astronomique for January, 1887. 

Milan Double star ohservations. — Professor Schiaparelli has published, 
in the Milan volume 33, his first series of double star observations made 
at that observatory with the 8-inch refractor from 1874 to 1885. There 
are four hundred and sixty-five stars in his list, and in most of them 
the components are less than 5" apart. In an appendix are given the 
mean results for a number of the closest pairs as measured with the 
18 inch refractor. With this instrument he discovered that the princi- 
pal star off Hydriii is itself a very close double, the magnitudes of the 
two components being 4 and 5.5, and distance 0".2 or 0".25. The first 
part of the volume contains a detailed description of the optical per- 
formance of the 8inch refractor, a discussion of the errors of the mi- 
crometer and of the accidental errors of observation, and a very full 
comparison with Dembowski's measures. The differences in the deter- 
mination of position angle due to the varying inclination of the line 
joining the two stars to the line of the observer's eyes are also investi- 
gated, but the reversion prism was not used. Professor Schiaparelli 
finds that his measures of distance are free from systematic errors, due 
to personality, but his position angles have a tendency to be small as 
compared with those of other observers. 

Professor Hough has published a catalogue of two hundred and nine 
new double stars discovered and measured by himself with the 18}-inch 
refractor of the Dearborn Observatory. Short lists of new doubles 
discovered with the McCorinick 2G-inch, and the Lick 3G-inch, have also 
been published. Burnham's list of his discoveries Avith the 36-incli re- 
fractor in three months is very interesting, containing as it does ncAV 
companions to y Cassiopejie, 11 mag., 2".2 distant; and a Tauri, 12 mag., 
2".3 distant. 

The following table contains the results of recent computations of 
the orbits of binary stars. The star S Equulei is of especial interest,

The imiltiple star C Cancri. — Professor Seeliger's recent investigations 
have confirmed the results of his earlier work, and those obtained by 
Struve in 1874. "The three stars A, B, and C have the magnitudes re- 
spectively, 5.0, 5.7, and 5.3. The proper motion of the system amounts 
in a century to +10^6 in right ascension, and to —11" in declination. 
The close pair, A and B, have a motion round each other in about sixty 
years, their apparent distance varying from about 0".G to I'M ; whilst 
C, the more distant companion, has moved through about 55° of posi- 
tion angle round the other two since Herschel's observations in 1781, 
its distance never very greatly varying from 5J". The motion of A 
and B round their common center of gravity does not appear to be dis- 
turbed to any appreciable extent by the iulluence of C, which is so placed 
as not to affect their apparent relative motions, even though a very con- 
siderable mass be assigned to it, and as a fact Professor Seeliger finds, for 

the most probable value of the mass of C, ^ , =2.38G, where l,w, and 
'■ ' l-\-m ' ' ' 

m' are the masses of A, B, and respectively. But there is a periodi- 
cal retrogression of C itself which is most easily accounted for by sup- 
posing the presence of a close companion, one hitherto undetected, and 
therefore either eniirely dark or but faintly luminous. The distance of 
this comi)anion is probably' only a few tenths of a second, the distance of 
C from the ])oint, Si, round Mhich it appears to revolve, and which may 
reasonably be assumed to be the center of gravity of itself and of I), the 
as yet undiscovered fourth member of the family, being only about one- 
fifth of a second. The entire group may then be considered as a double 
double.

VARIABLE AND (COLORED STARS. 

Chandler^ s catalogue of variable stars. — The most iiuportaut work upon 
variable stars since Scboenfeld's " Zweiter Catalog," now thirteen years 
old, is a new catalogue published by Mr. S. C. Chandler as Nos. 179 and 
ISO of the Astronomical Journal. In the absence of any later catalogue 
from Schoenfeld this immediately takes its place as the standard, though 
the author states that it is preliminary to a more complete catalogue 
which will embody a series of observ-atious and definitive investigations 
now in hand. 

An analysis of the catalogue shows that of the 225 stars comprised 
in it ICO are distinctly variable ; in 12 the periodic character is rather 
uncertainly defined ; 14 are distinctly irregular j 12 belong to the so- 
called novw, or have been seen at only one api)earance; and the 27 re- 
maining have been too little observed for the character of the variation 
to be properly known. Of the 160 periodical variables, epochs of both 
maximum and minimum are assigned for C3 ; maximum epochs alone 
for 82 ; minimum epochs alone for 14, 9 of these being of the Algol 
type, while in one the period alone is given. The elements of 124 stars 
are the results of Mr. Chandler's own investigations; 22 are taken from 
Schoenfeld; and 14 from other computers after Mr, Chandler had care- 
fully confirmed them. The systematic perturbations shown by many 
of the periods have received attention, and the iurther study of this 
subject promises important additions to our knowledge of the causes 
of stellar variation. 

A useful novelty introduced in numbering the stars calls for unquali- 
fied approval. Instead of giving them consecutive numbers each is dis- 
tinguished by a number equal to one-tenth of the right ascension ex- 
pressed in time-seconds for the equinox 1900.0. In this way the numer- 
ation need not be disturbed by fresh discoveries. 

The catalogue gives in successive columns a serial number assigned 
in the way just described; Scboenfeld's number; the right ascension 
and declination for 1855, and the annual variations ; the discoverer ; 
date of discovery; redness on an arbitrary scale; magnitude at maxi- 
mum and at minimum ; Greenwich mean time of maximum and mini- 
mum; period; remarks; and approximate place for 1900. 

A very ingenious method of estimating the colors was employed by 
Mr. Chandler; it consists in estimating the relative change in bright- 
ness effected in two stars by the interposition, first, of a blue and then 
of a red shade glass. If a red and a white star appear of the same 
brightness, when viewed directly, the red star will seem the fainter 
when the blue glass is interposed, but the brighter with the red glass; 
and these differences of brightness can be very precisely estimated by 
Argelauder's method, and they thus afford definite measures of the 
differences in color of the two stars on an arbitrary scale depending 
upon the glasses employed. Mr. Cliandler finds that the effect of 
brightness upon the scale-estimates is imperceptible, at least between 



ASTKOiNOMY. 141 

tlie second and ninth magnitudes. An important result of his obser- 
vations is the intimate connection showu between the length of period 
and the depth of color ot the star ; the very short-period variables are 
nearly white; those of longer period somewhat redder, the tint grow- 
ing deeper, the longer the period. 

Several new variable stars have been detected by Chandler, Sawyer, 
Espiu, and others, and among them are two of more than ordinary in- 
terest, as they apparently belong to the well-known "Algol-type." The 
tirst was discovered by Mr. Chandler in the constellation Cygnus (Y 
Cygni), right ascension =20^^ 47'".5; declination =+340 14' (DM, + 
340, 4181). Its light varies from 7.1 magnitude to about 7.9 magni- 
tude, and the period is probably l'^ 11^ 5G'" 48^. The second star re- 
ferred to, was discovered by Mr. Sawyer in March, 1887, in the constel- 
lation Canis Major, and as it is the first undoubted variable found iu 
that constellation, it will probably be known as H Canis Majoris. Its 
position for 1887 is right ascension —.7'' 14'".4; declination = — IGo 11'. 
The minimum observed by Mr. Sawyer was 6.7 magnitude, and the 
j)eriod is 1*^ o'' 15'" 55^. Mr. Chandler has collected the observations of 
U Oi)hiuchi, of all variables the one with shortest period and the most 
rapid fluctuations of light, and he finds a curious but well-marked re- 
tardation iu the increase of brilliancy some half-hour or so after mini- 
iiuim is i)assed. A similar irregularity has been noticed in the light- 
curv'^e of S Cancri and occasionally iu that of Algol. 

Mr, Chandler strongly urges the possessors of large refractors to 
devote a portion of their time to tlie observation of the minima of vari- 
ables that become too faint for ordinary telescopes, our knowledge of 
such variables being extremely deficient. Argelander's method of ob- 
servation is recommended. 

Professor Pickering has in jireparation an index to observations of 
variable stars which will give for each star the number of observations 
each year since the discovery of variability. This index will be pub- 
lished iu volume 18 of the Annals of the Harvard Observatory. 

In an interesting article published iu the Observatory (April, 1888), 
Miss Gierke has collected a series of notes upon variable double stars. 
These stars show for the most part a spectrum analogous to that of 
Sirius, that is of Class I, although single stars of that class hardly ever 
show any fluctuations iu brightness. Algol-variables, if the eclipse 
theory of their changes be admitted, make uo exceptions to this rule; 
Gore's catalogue contains three examples: (5 Oriouis, S Monocerotis, 
and Y Virginis, and among the well-known doubles are y Virginis, 
C Bootis, TT Bootis, 38 Gemiuorum, a Piseium, H Serpentis, and /i Scot- 
pii, and perhaps S Cygni. With few and doubtful exceptions, revolv- 
ing double stars vary in concert, if they vary at all. The changes of 
y Virginis illustrate the mode of procedure iu this respect of couples 
iiitiinsically e(iua1. They alternate in each component, and can thus 
be detected only by close attention. Each mny bo described as nor-

nially of tbe third magnitude; and each in turn declines by about half 
a magnitude and recovers within a few days, yet so that the general 
preponderance, during a cycle of several years, remains to the same 
star. Miss Gierke suggests that simultaneous variation in the color of 
ueighboriug stars may lead to the discovery of their physical depend- 
ence. 

Mr. G. F. Chambers has prepared a catalogue (still in manuscript) of 
seven hundred <ind eleven red stars, brighter than the eight and one- 
half magnitude, the result of observations made from 1870 to 1880; 
less than twelve stars, according to Mr. Chambers, can properly be 
termed carmine or ruby. 

STELLAR PH0T03IETRY. 

The magnitudes of the standard stars of the British, French, German, 
Spanish, and American nautical almanacs have been rediscussed by 
Professor Picketing, and his results will probably be adopted in future 
issues of the French, Spanish, and American works. The plan pro- 
l)osed was, that the magnitude adopted for each star should be the 
mean of those derived from the Harvard Photometry, the photometric 
observations of Wolft", the Uranometria Oxouieusis, and the Urano- 
metria Argentina. The list published embraces 800 stars, and of these 
the magnitudes of all but 04 depend upon at least two and generally 
upon three authorities; 132 stars being common to all four of the 
adopted standard catalogues of brightness. 

A ''wedge-photometer," constructed under the direction of Professor 
Pritchard for the Harvard Observatory, has been submitted to a careful 
examination by Professors Langley, Young, and Pickering, and it ap- 
pears from Professor Langley's investigation of the wedge, by means 
of his bolometer, that there is a selective absorption of light throughout 
the wedge; feeble in the more luminous portion of the spectrum, but 
of such a character that, broadly speaking, the transmissibility always 
increases from the violet toward the red, increasing very greatly in the 
infra-red. These results have been confirmed by Professor Pickering's 
experiments, and they emphasize the danger, already recognized by 
Professor Pritchard, of employing an instrument of this kind in the 
observation of deeply-colored stars. 

From a comparison of the star-magnitudes of the Oxford Uranometry 
with those of Wolff's second catalogue, and with those of the Harvard 
Photometry, Professor Pickering has found that the Oxford magnitudes 
are, on the average, less than the Harvard magnitudes for stars down 
to the third magnitude, but greater for the fourth and fifth, and less 
again for stars below the sixth. The Harvard catalogue differs less 
IVom those of Woltf and I*rit(;hard than the two latter do from each 
other.

STELLAR SPECTRA. 

Photograph ic study of stellar spectra. Ilcnr}/ Draper memorial. — Pro- 
fessor Pickering', in his annual report for 1888, presents the proj^ress 
made iii the various investigations of steHar spectra as follows : A cata- 
logue has been prepared of the spectra of 10,875 stars, covering the 
entire sky north of — 25o. The Sinch Bache telescope has been used 
for this work. Six hundred and thirty-three plates have beeu taken, 
and 27,953 spectra have been examined. The type of spectrum is 
given in each case, and in sibout six thousand cases additional lines are 
visible aud have accordingly beeu described. The photographic in- 
tensities of the spectra have also been measured, giving a photometric 
measure of the stars by which those of difierent colors may be com- 
pared. The first draft of a spectroscopic catalogue has been prepared, 
including the place of each star for 1900, its designatiou and magni- 
tude in various catalogues, its photographic brightness, aud the descrip- 
tion of each spectrum. The photographs required for the second inves- 
tigation on the spectra of the fainter stars are nearly completed. The 
instruments employed in both of these investigations were prepared 
for shipment to Pern, where the work will be continued among the 
southern constellations. Tlie detailed study of the brighter stars with 
the 11-inch Draper telescope has been extended by the use of plates 
stained with erythrosin. The sodium line D in these spectra has thus 
been i)hotogTaphed as a double line. A catalogue has been formed of 
the lines in some of the brighter stars. In Sirius the lines, except 
those due to hydrogen, are very faint. But nearly four hundred of 
them have been measured in different photographs of this star ; fifteen 
are recorded between the lines H and K. A beginning has also been 
made of the study of the spectra of the variable stars. 

Dr. von Koukoly and his assistant, Dr. Kovesligethy, have carried 
the spectroscopic surv^ey of the heavens begun by Vogel and Duner to 
15 degrees south declination, aud have published their work in volume 
8, i)art 2, of the O'dyalla observations. The instrument used was a 
Zolluer spectroscope. Vogel's arrangement of types was followed. 
The catalogue contains in all 2,022 stars, down to 7.5 magnitude. But 
one bright line spectrum was suspected, a star of G. 5 magnitude 50' 
north of C Orionis, aud this star, as well as /i, 6, aud € Orionis, is found 
to have a variable spectrum. 

Among the peculiarities detected in stellar spectra may be noted the 
iliscovery by Espin on August 13, 1888, of a bright line in the spectrum 
of the variable star U Cygni; and as Duner found it in 1879-'82 of a weak 
III type, an extraordinary change seems to have taken place. Espin's 
bright line was apparently of a temporary character, and faded ra])idly. 

Motion of stars in the li)ie of sight. — The spectroscopic observations for 
the determination of the motions of stars in the line of sigfht have been 
continued at Greenwicli and at tlie Temple Observatory, Bugby, the 



144 KECOKD OF SCIENCJ': FOR 18S7 AND 1888. 

only two observatories that have thus far given systematic atteution 
to this important line of work. The most interesting results are in the 
case of Sirius, which, when first observed at Greenwich in the winter of 
1875-'7G, seemed to be receding from us at the rate of 24 miles per 
second. This recession gradually changed to an approach of 5 miles 
per second in 1882-'S3, increasing to 24 miles in 1885-'S0, and then 
dropping to 1 mile in 1886-87, and now becoming a recession again, in 
1887, of 6 miles per second. As the Astronomer Royal remarks, these 
results are to be accepted with caution; the F line for which the meas- 
ures were made would seem to have changed somewhat its character- 
istics, and the observation is moreover one of extreme difficulty, the 
discordances obtained on different nights being almost as great as the 
whole range of displacement noted. 

Dr. Vogel, of Potsdam, has successfully applied photography to the 
determination of the displacement of Hues in stellar spectra due to a 
motion of the star in the line of sight. Two Eutherford i)risms were 
used, the observations being made on the third line of hydrogen, H;'. 
Dr. Scheiner, who has been carrying out these experiments, has exam- 
ined the spectra of Sirius, Procyon, Castor, Arcturus, Aldebaran, Pol- 
lux, and Rigel. Of these, Sirius showed a slight displacement toward 
the red, thus indicating a motion away from us; Procyon a decided dis- 
])lacement, and Rigel a very large one in the same direction, while Arc- 
turus showed a considerable displacement towards the violet. A sys- 
tematic examination of all stars of the first and second magnitudes is 
to be undertaken with improved apparatus. 

ASTRONOMICAL PHOTOGRAPHY. 

The Paris International Astrophotographic Conf/ress. — The general in- 
terest in the application of photography to astronomical observations 
has resulted in a meeting called by the French Academy of Sciences, 
at the instance of Admiral Mouchez, for the purpose of uniting upon 
a plan for preparing by international co-operation a photographic 
chart of the heavens more extensive than any hitherto attempted 
by the usual methods. The Congress was opened at the Paris Ob- 
servatory on April IC, 1887, by M. Flourens, minister of foreign af- 
fairs of the French Government, and addresses were made by M. Ber- 
trand, tlie eminent mathematician, by Admiral Mouchez, director of the 
Paris Observatory, and by Professor Struve, director of the Pulkowa 
Observatory. Fifty-six members were present, including thirty-seven 
foreign astronomers, representing sixteen nations. Admiral Mouchez 
was chosen honorary president; Struve, president; Auwers, Christie, 
and Faye, vice-presidents; Bakhuyzen and Tisserand, secretaries, and 
Duner and Trcpied, assistant secretaries. At the first meeting a com- 
mittee of nineteen was appointed to consider and report upon the size 
and construction of the instruments to be employed, and upon the limit 
of star-magnitudes to be included in the photographs. This committee

reported on Ain-il 19, and after some discussion it was decided to divide 
the Congress into two sectious — one to deal with purely astronomical 
questions, and the other with questions pertaining to the photographic 
side of the problem. Each section drew np a series of resolutions which 
were further discussed and amended by the Congress in full session, the 
result being an agreement to adopt refracting telescopes of 13 inches 
aperture and 11^ feet focal length, and to undertake two series of pho- 
tographs of the entire sky, one taking in stars as faint as the fourteenth 
maguitude, the other stopping at the eleventh. The ultimate aim is to 
convert the positions of the stars upon these last plates into the usual 
CO ordinates of right ascension and declination, and to publish them in 
the form of a star catalogue, and to prepare from the series euibraciug 
the fainter stars a set of glass positives for each of the co-operatiug ob- 
servatories or nations. 
Following are the resolutions in detail as finally adopted: 

(I) The progress made in astronomical i)hotography demands tiiat 
astronomers of the present day should unite in undertaking a descrip- 
tion of the heavens by photograhpic means. 

('^) This work shall be carried out at selected stations, and tlio instru- 
ments shall be identical in their essential parts. 

(3) The principal objects shall be : a. To prepare a general photo- 
graphic chart of the heavens for the present epoch, and to obtain data 
which shall enable us to determine the positions and magnitudes of all 
stars down to a certain magnitude, with the greatest possible accuracy 
(magnitudes being understood in a ])hotographic sense to be defined 
later), b. To be able to utilize in the best way, botli in the present and 
in the future, the data obtained by i)hotographic means. 

(4) The instruments employed shall be exclusively refractors. 

(5) The stars shall be photographed as far as the fourteentii nuigni- 
tude, inclusive ; this magnitude being indicated provisionally by the 
scale actually in use in France, and with the reservation that its pho- 
tographic value shall be definitely fixed afterward. 

(G) The aperture of the object-glasses sliall be 0.33 meter (13. 
inches), and the focal length about 3.13 meters (11^ feet), so that a 
minute of arc shall be represented approximately by 0.001 meter. 

(7) Tlie directors of observatories shall be at liberty to have the object- 
glasses made where they desire, provided they fulfill the general con- 
ditions laid down by the ('ongress. 

(8) The aplanatism and achromatism of the objectives shall be calcu- 
lated for radiations near the I'raunhofer ray G. 

(0) All the plates shall be prepared according to the same formula ; 
this formula to be subseipiently agreed upon. 

(1(>) A i)ermanent control of tliese i)Iates from the jxiint of view of 
their relative sensibility to the dilferent radiations shall be instituted. 

(I I) Questions iu regard to the preservation and reproduetiou of the 
lu^gatives can not at present be settled, and shall l)e referred to a 
8pe(;ial committee. 

(lli) The same conclusions are adopted in regard to the photograi»hic 
magnitudes of the stars. 

(13) llesolution 8 above, in regard to the ajilanatism and achromatism 
of the object-glasses, shall be understood in the sense that the mini- 
mum foeal distance shall be that of a ray near (r, so as to attain the 
maximum sensibility of the photographic plates. 
H. Mis. U2 ^10 



14G RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

(14) The object-glasses shall be constructed iu such a mauiier that 
the Held to be measured shall extend at least 1 degree from the center. 

(15) In order to eliminate fictitious stars and to avoid inconvenience 
from minute specks which may exist upon the plates, two series of 
negatives shall be made for the whole sky. 

(16) The two series of negatives shall be so made that the image of 
a star situated in che corner of a plate of the first series shall be found 
as nearly as possible in the center of a plale of the second series. 

(17) Besides the two negatives giving the stars down to the four- 
teenth magnitude another series shall be made with shorter exposures, 
to assure a greater precision in the micrometrical measurement of the 
fundamental stars, and render possible the construction of a catalogue. 

(18) The supplementary negatives, destined for the construction of the 
catalogue, shall contain all the stars down to the eleventh magnitude 
approximately. The executive committee shall determine the steps to 
be taken to insure the fulfillment of this condition. 

(19) Each photographic plate to be used in the formation of the cata- 
logue shall be accompanied by all the data necessary to obtain the 
orientation and the value of its scale ; and, as far as possible, these data 
sliall be written on the plate itself. Each ]date of this kind shall show 
a well-centered copy of a system of cross-wires for the purpose of elimi- 
nating errors which may be produced by a subsequent deformation of 
the photographic film. Eurther details of this nature shall be deter- 
mined by the executive committee. 

(20) In the negatives intended for the map the number of cross- wires 
to be used in their control and reduction shall be reduced to a mini- 
mum. 

(21) The tubes of the photographic instruments shall be constructed 
of the metal most likely to give an invariable focal plane and shall carry 
a graduation for the determination and regulation of the position of the 
plate. 

(22) The executive committee shall choose the reference stars to bo 
used. 

(23) The question of the methods of measurement and the conversion 
of the numbers obtained into right ascensions and declinations for the 
equinox of 1900 is left to the executive committee. That committee 
shall first occupy itself with the study and methods of use of measuring- 
instruments, giving either rectangular or polar co-ordinates, and based 
ui)on the simultaneous use of scales for the larger distances, and mi- 
crometer screws for scale subdivisions. 

(24) The connection of the plates will be effected iu conformity with 
resolution No. 16. 

At the last general session, April 25, the Congress delegated its pow- 
ers to a permanent committee, consisting of the directors of the observa- 
tories actually taking part in the work, and the following eleven mem- 
bers chosen by ballot, viz.: Christie, Duner, Gill, Prosper Henry, Janssen, 
Loewy, Pickering, Struve, Tacchini, Vogel, and Weiss. The observa- 
tories of Algiers, Bordeaux, Cape of Good Hope, Greenwich, La Plata, 
Melbourne, Oxford, Paris, Potsdam, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, San Fer- 
nando, Sydney, Tacubaya, Toulouse, have been pledged to co-operate, 
and the instruments for several of them are well advanced. No observa- 
tory in the United States has thus far signified definitely its intention of 
co-operating, though the Government has been apjjealed to to appropri- 



ASTRONOMY. 147 

ate the uecessary funds for the Washington Observatory. Tlie business 
of the permanent committee is transacted through an executive bureau, 
consisting of Admiral Mouchez, president; Christie, Duner, Janssen, 
Struve, and Tacchini, members, and Gill, Loewy,and Vogel, secretaries. 
It is expected that meetings of the permanent committee will be held 
every three years, though they may be called more frequently if found 
desirable. Before adjourning, the Congress elected also a special com- 
mittee, to occupy itself with the application of photography to astron- 
omy other than the construction of a map, acting in concert with the 
permanent committee. Messrs. Common and Janssea were requested 
to take charge of this matter. They have communicated by circular 
with all who are likely to be interested in this work, and propose to call 
a meeting at Paris, and form a committee for the consideration of the 
best means of carrying out the plan suggested by the Congress. 

As many preliminary experiments are necessary in arranging details, 
special subjects of investigation have been referred to different astron- 
omers. For instance, the study of the proper form of reticule, to Vogel ; 
photographic magnitudes, to Struve and Pickering; optical deformation 
of images, to Struve; study of three or four stars nearly in a straight 
line, embracing an angular distance of about 1 degree, and photographed 
necessarily at the center and corner of a plate, to the observatories of 
Algiers, Leyden, Paris, Pulkowa ; distortion of the sensitive film, to Al- 
giers, Meudon, Potsdam; curved plates, Christie; orientation of the 
plates, the Cape, Paris; measuring apparatus, to a special committee; 
formula for the preparation of the plates, Abney, Eder; the effect of 
colors of the stars upon the i^hotographic magnitude, Dun6r. 

The permanent committee has published, through the Paris Academy, 
three reports: the first, a full account of the Congress held in April, 
1887; the other two, "bulletins," containing correspondence and results 
of the preliminary investigations. These papers are of great importance 
in the proposed photographic work, but they can hardly be reviewed 
satisfactorily here. The most extensive are: "Note sur I'application de 
la photographic aux mesures micronnStriques des etoiles, T.-N. Thicle ; 
De I'intluence des dur^es de la pose sur I'exactitude des photographies 
stellaires, J. Scheiner; Travaux prdparatoires effectues ;\ I'observatoiro 
do Potsdam, Vogel; Expose de la methode parallactiquo de mesure, — 
r(5duction des cliches, J. C. Kapteyn; llecherches faites a I'observatoire 
de Harvard College sur les resultats photometriques, E. C. Pickering; 
fitendue du champ des cliches photographiques do I'observatoire de 
Paris, ]\IM. Henry." 

It is strongly recommended that the plates be measured at a central 
bureau established in the neighborhood of Paris. 

Professor Pritchard having undertaken, for the photographiic coiii- 
niittee of the Royal Society, an examination of two silver-onglass mir- 
rors of the same aperture but of very different focal lengths, with a view 
of ascertainnig the practical eftects of focal length on the photogra[)liic 



148 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

tiekl, biXJ:! concliKled that mirrors are unsuitable for any extensive chart- 
ing-, particuhirly mirrors of short focal length; at the same time there 
is no doubt as to their capacity for the singularly accurate delineation 
of small portions of the heavens, and for such operations as those con- 
nected with stellar parallax or the charting of the moon. 

Mr. Roberts has described in the Monthly Notices (49: 5-13) an in- 
strnment which he calls the ''stellar pantograver," intended to surmount 
the difficulties of reproducing the negatives after they have been ob- 
tained. It is essentially an instrument for engraving upon copper plates 
])oints of the same size and in the same relative i)ositious as those de- 
picted by the photographs. 

In the long exposures of two hours and upwards that some of the 
l)hotographs have required there is considerable danger of disidace- 
ments of the images npon the plates due to variations in the refraction. 
Dr. Dreyer has found that in latitude -fSO^ such displacements are not 
likely to exceed 0".5 (and will therefore not affect sensibly the symmetry 
of the images) in the case of an equatorial star moving from 27'" east 
to L*7'" west of the meridian or in the case of a star of -|-25o declination 
moving from 39'" east to 39"' west. 

The })liotographic work of Professor Pickering upon stellar spectra, 
and of Gothard, Vogel and Roberts upon nebula?, has been mentioned 
under these headings. Rai)id progress has been made by Dr. Gill with 
his southern x)hotographic Durchmusterung. 

COMETS. 

Comet EmlcG (1888 II). — Encke's well-known periodic comet was 
picked up by Mr. Tebbutt, of Windsor, New South Wales, with the 
help of the ephemeris of Backhand and Seraphimoff, on July 8, 1888, 
ten days after it had passed perihelion. In a 4i-inch telescope it ap- 
peared as a small, bright, well-condensed nebula, about 1/ in diam- 
eter, without a nucleus. It was observed at Windsor till August 1, 
when it was "of the last degree of faintness," and at the Cape to 
August 9, but it was unfavorably situated for observation in the 
northern hemisphere. 

Berberich has discussed the brightness of Encke's comet as seen at 
different returns from 178G to 1885, and calls attention to the rather 
remarkable circumstance that the comet has been most conspicuous 
when seen near a time of maximum of solar spots, and least when re- 
turning near a minimum. 

Comet Faye (1888 IV). — Found by Perrotin, at Nice, August 9, 1888, 
by the help of a sweeping ephemeris prepared by Kreutz. It was de- 
scribed as a very faint, circular nebulosity about one minute in extent, 
with a slight central condensation. Although it ren)ained visible as 
late as February, 1889, on account of its extreme faintness but few 
observations seemed to have been secured. Maximum brightness was 
reached about the beginning of December. The correction to the 



ASTRONOMY. 149 

epbemeiis coiui)uted directly from the elements was —4'". 4; + 4', corre- 
sponding to a retardation of tjie perihelion time of about two days. 

Comet Olhers, originally discovered by tlie celebrated Dr. Gibers on 
March G, 1815, was picked up by Brooks on August 24, 1887, iiide- 
dendentlj' of Giuzel's ephemeris. Bessel, who made a discussion of 
tlu; earlier observations, predicted a return to perihelion on February 
9, 1887, and Dr. Ginzel, rediscussing the orbit in a very elaborate 
manner, found the most ])robable date of perihelion to be Decem- 
ber 17, 188G, with an uncertainty of l.G years. Perihelion actually 
occurred on Octobers, 1887. Esi)ecial interest attaches to this comet 
as the third member of the group of comets having a period of about 
seventy-live years (Halley's, Pons', and Gibers'), w'hich has returned 
to perihelion in conformity with prediction. Kammermann, at Geneva, 
described it on August 29, 1887, as a bright 7.8 magnitude, with a faint 
tail. There seems to be no reason for supposing that it has lost any- 
thing of its light-giving power since its previous appearance in 1815. 
The last observation at this return was made at the Lick Gbservatory 
on July 5, 1888, when the theoretical brightness was less than one- 
tenth that at the time of discovery. 

Comet Tempel. — The comet discovered by Tempel on July 3, 1873, and 
found to have a period of five and one quarter years, was observed at its 
return in 1878, but escaped observation in 1883 when it was due at peri- 
helion on November 20. The conditions of visibilitj' seem to be even 
worse for the return of 1889, the comet temaining too near the sun, 
while the circumstances of the return in 1894 are but little diflerent 
from those of 1883. 

Comet Winneclce. — Von Haerdtl has rediscussed the motion of Win- 
necke's comet, making use of observations at a later return than Gp- 
polzer could employ in 1880. The object was to detect, if possible, any 
increase in the mean motion similar to tluit exhibited by Eucke's comet, 
though not sensible in Faye's comet, possibly owing to its great perihe- 
lion distance. He finds no acceleration whatever of the mean motion, 
the actual figures indicating rather a slight retardation, but far too 
small to justify any conclusion other than absence of change in the 
mean motion and length of period.

=Coniet a 1.SS7. 

=Tlio meat souilioru comet 



A cable dispatch from Dr. Thome, the di- 
rector of the Cordoba Observatory in South 
America, announced his discovery on Jan- 
uary 18, 1887, of a large comet, or rather the tail of a large comet, faint 
aird illusor.v in the twilight and mist of the horizon. From later infor- 
mation it ai)peared that the conu't was seen at Blauwberg, near Cape 
Town, on the same evening, by a farmer and a fishernniu, and a day or 
two later it was seen at several places in Australia. Dr. Thome was 



150 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

not able to confirm liis discovery till January 20. From the 22d to the 
25th the comet was a beautiful object to the naked eye — a narrow, 
straight, sharply defi'ned, graceful tail, over 40 degrees long, shining 
with a soft starry light against the dark sky, beginning, apparently, 
without a head, and gradually wideniug and fading as it extended up- 
wards. At the Cape of Good Hope it was observed from January 22 
to 28, the long, straight tail recalling the comet of February, 1880. The 
Eevista do observatorio for February, published by Dr. Cruls at IJio 
Janeiro, gives a sketch of the comet made on Januar^^ 24. The nucleus 
was then somewhere beyond the bright star (x Gruis, invisible in (he 
haze of the horizon, and the tail stretched up beyond /i Ilydrae, a nar- 
row ribbon 52 degrees in length and about half a degree in width. As 
far as we have been able to learn the comet was not seen at all in tlie 
northern hemisphere, and was not followed in the southern hemisphere 
beyond the end of January. 

Unfortunately, also, no well defined nucleus, or even the slightest 
condensation as a point of observation could be made out at any of the 
observatories at which the couiet was visible, and from the rough ob- 
servations which were obtained it is impossible to determine the orbit 
with any degree of precision. The earlier dispatches suggested the 
identity of the new comet with the great comet of 1880, apparently on 
the ground of a general similarity of the circumstances of the apparition, 
and on the fact that the line of sight nearly intersected the orbit of the 
comet of 1880; but Mr. Chandler, who has made a critical discussion of 
all the observations obtained, has been unable to reconcile them with an 
orbit similar to that of the group of great comets of 1843, 1880, and 1882; 
the orbit that he obtains bears a closer resemblance, in fact, to those of 
the comets of 1680 and 1G89. The unavoidable uncertainty in the ob- 
servations must, however, leave the question of identity unsettled. 
The extremely small perihelion distance is worthy of notice, and may, 
perhaps, account for the lack of nucleus. Indeed, if we accept the orl)it 
computed by Dr. Oppeuheim (q=0.0047), the comet must have ploughed 
through the surface of the sun itself.

ern declination, 80°, then went south again, and was last observed 
l)y Plummer at Orwell Park, on April 23. From the time of discovery 
it increased gradually in brightness till about the middle of February, 
when it was described as a bright telescopic object about 3' in diam- 
eter with well marked central condensation of the tenth magnitude. 
According to the yet unfinished investigation of Dr. Stechert the orbit 
shows a well-marked ellipticity.

wards the north and west; hist observed on April 10, at Orwell Park. 
The ordinary formula for brightness, which assumes that the comet 
shines by retieoted suiili<;ht only, seems to have failed in this case, as in 
many others; in the middle of March, when its theoretical brightness 
was 0.12 that at the time of discovery, it was apparently as well seen as 
during- the first days of its appearance. 

Barnard's third comet of 1887 was discovered at 
11 o'clock on the evening of May 12, in right as- 
cension 15'', declination— 31°. On May 13 it was described by Boss as 
having a star like nucleus of the 11.5 magnitude. It increased some- 
what in brightness till about the middle of June, developing a tail 
which attained a length of 5'. It moved rapidly north, and on account 
of its brightness and favorable situation was well observed, till August 
11. Mr. Muller has already completed a definitive orbit, and finds that 
the observations arc represented by an ellipse somewhat better thau 
by a parabola.

Comet 1888 I : 
= Comet « 1838 



Discovered by Sawerthal, at the Cape of Good 
Hope, on February 18, 1888, or the early morning 
of February 19, civil reckoning, the comet being readily seen with the 
naked eye, with sharply defined nucleus of the seventh magnitude in 
right ascension 19'', declination -560; a tail 2^ in length was visible 
with an opera glass. The rapid northerly motion brought it, by the 
12th of March, into view in the northern hemisphere, where it was fol- 
lowed until September, being reported visible to the naked eye until 
the first part of May. Thome, at Cordoba, described it as a fine naked- 
eye object, with a tail, at its maximum, 5° in length and a nucleus of 
three and one-half magnitude. Remarkable fluctuations occurred in 
the brightness of the head, during the months of March aiul May, re- 
sembling the phenomena noted in the great September comet of 1882 
and the Pons-Brooks comet of 1881. 

On the 19th of ^Nlarch the main eighth magnitude nucleus was seen to 
have an eleventh magnitude companion, and on the 27th of the month 
a third faint nucleus was detected; the triple nucleus was last seen 
on the 4th of June. Between the 19th and 21st of May it became five 
or six times brighter than during the days immediately i)receding, and 
from the nucleus two bright streamers were shot out, curving backward 
on either side of the nucleus into the tail. This sudden outburst is all 
the more difficult to account for as it occurred two months after peri- 
helion ; it is to be regretted that no spectroscopic observations were 
obtained at this criti(;al period. The spectroscopic observations made 
in March and April showed a faint, broad, continuous spectrum, in ad-

ditiou to the tliree characteristic liydroj^en bands. The orbit, accord- 
ing to Berberich, is nndonbtedly elliptic, the period, from his preliminary 
compntation, being 2,370 years.

ported was on October 10.

Comet 1888 V : Discovered by Mr. E. E. Barnard, at the Lick Ob- 

=Comet / 1888. servatory, on October 30; a faint suspicious object, 
the head well developed, witli ill-defined nucleus, and a short tail. Peri- 
helion had taken place some forty-eight days before discoverj'^, but the 
increasing distance from the sun was largely compensated for by the 
approach to the earth, so that the comet was observed for several 
months in 1889. 

This comet was discovered by Barnard at the Lick 
Observatory, with a 4 inch coinet-seeker, on Septem- 
ber 2, ISiiS, or the morning of September 3, and also independently by 
Brooks, at Geneva, on the following morning. It was a round nebulous 
mass 1', in diameter, with a central condensation of 11-12 magnitude 
and no tail. At the end of November it reached its maximum bright- 
ness, twelve times as bright as at discovery, and ai)[)eared to the naked 
eye like a nebulous star of the sixth magnitude. It will not pass peri- 
helion till January 31, 1889. 

The spectrum, according to Dr. Copeland, on November 14, instead 
of being composed of the usual feeble separate bauds, was continuous, 
rather long, extending from wave-lengths 575 to 450 of Angstrom's scale, 
brighter in the middle and fading gradually at both ends ; it resembled 
the spectrum of a close globular star cluster or of a non-gaseous nebula, 
rather than that of a self luminous gas. Faint patches of light were 
made out in the jiositious usually occupied by the second and third 
cometary bands. Similar observations were made later, and on Decem- 
ber 8, all three bands were distinctly visible, but on each occasion the 
continuous s[)ectrum formed the ground on which the brighter spectrum 
was superposed. "It seems probable that the comet shines mainly by 
reflected light, - - - to whi(;h the action of the sun on the cometary 
material is slowly adding the usual bright bauds."

154 HECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888, 

Prof. Daniel Kirkwood has suggested that certain comets of short 
period may liave originated within the solar system. Wolf's comet 
(1884 III), for example, before its last near approach to Jupiter, had an 
eccentricity of 0.28, which is exceeded by twelve known asteroids, and 
the elements of Tempel's comet (1867 II) do not differ greatly from 
those of an eccentric asteroid. Out of twenty short-period comets, 
seven have disappeared either by dissolution, like Biela's comet, or by 
the transformation of the orbit by Jupiter as in the case of Lexell's comet. 
Five, or, including Encke's and Biela's, seven, have periods commensur- 
able with that of Jupiter; all have direct motion; all but one have a 
smaller inclination than Pallas, and there is a tendency of the perihelia 
to concentrate in the 180° (from 290° to 110°), as in the asteroids. 

One of the most able of recent contributions to cometary astronomy 
is a monograph by Dr. Kreutz upon the orbit of the great September 
comet of 1882. In connection with investigations being carried on by 
Professor Weiss this will form a complete discussion of the system of 
comets with remarkably small perihelion distance, 1813 I, 1880 I, and 
1882 II. 

Dr. Galle is compiling a catalogue of recent comets embracing the 
various supplements to the list given in 1847 in Encke's edition of 
" Olbers' Methode." 

METEORITES. 

Researches on meteorites. — Mr.Lockyer presented at the meeting of the 
Royal Society on Nov^ember 17, 1887, a paper giving the results of liis 
" Researches on Meteorites," which has attracted much attention. He 
has examined meteoric spectra under various conditions, particularly 
that of feeble temperature, and has found it possible to obtain from 
meteorites spectra that show the most peculiar features of solar, stellar, 
nebular, or cometary spectra. " In the spectra of uebul;i% for instance, 
seven lines have been detected, of which three were traced to hydrogen, 
three to low- temperature magnesium, and the seventh, which has not 
yet been traced to its originating element, has been given by the glow 
from the Dhurmsala meteorite. The most characteristic nebular line 
was identified with the low-temperature fluting of magnesium, and the 
unusual spectrum obtained from the comets of 1806 and 1807 was 
ascribed to the same cause. The changes observed in the spectrum of 
the great comet of 1882 were such as would correspond to the changes 
induced by the change of temperature in the spectrum of a meteorite; 
and the changes in the spectrum of Kova Oygni, and the bright lines in 
such a star as R Geminorum received a similar explanation; wliile a 
very full, in parts almost perfect, reproduction of a considerable i)ortion 
of the solar spectrum has been obtained by taking a composite photo- 
grai)h of the arc spectrum of several stony meteorites, taken at random 
between iron meteoric poles. These and similar observations have led 
Mr. Lockyer to regard all self-luminous bodies in the celestial spaces 



ASTRONOMY. 155 

as composed of meteorites, or masses of meteotitic vapor pioduced by 
lieat brought about l>y condeusatiou of meteor-swarms due to gravity, 
so that the existing distinction between stars, comets, and nebul;e rests 
on no physical basis. All alike are meteoritic in origin, the differences 
between them depending upon differences in temperature, and upon the 
closeness of the component meteorites to one another. Noihc (new stars 
that blaze forth suddenly) are explained as produced by the clash of 
meteor-streams, and most variable stars are regarded as uucondensed 
meteor-streams. Stars with spectra like that of Alpha Orionis (Rigel) 
are considered not as true suns, but as mere clouds of incandescent 
stones ; probably the first stage of meteoritic condensation. Stars with 
spectra of the first and second type represent the condensed swarm in 
its hottest stages, while spectra of Secchi's fourth type indicate an ad- 
vanced state of cooling." 

The general conclusions arrived at by Mr. Lockyer may be thus 
summarized: All self-luminous bodies in space are composed of me- 
teorites variously aggregated, and at various stages of temperature 
depending upon the frequency and violence of their mutual collisions. 
Comets, nebula?, bright-line stars, st^ars showing banded spectra of the 
tliird type, including most long-period variables, are to be regarded as 
veritable meteor-swarms; they are made up, that is to say, of an in- 
definite multitude of separate and (in a sense) independent solid bodies, 
bathed in evolved gases, and glowing with the heat due to their ar- 
rested motions. "The existing distinction," we are told, "between 
stars, comets, and nebula? rests on no physical basis." Stars, on the 
other hand, of the Sirian and solar types (constituting the only true 
"suns") are vaporized meteor-swarms; their high temperatures repre- 
sent the surrendered velocities of myriads of jostling particle?, drawn 
together by the victorious power of gravity. 

"Collisions" are not however exclusively relied upon for the cos- 
mical production of light and heat. It is admitted that the luminosity 
of comets and nebulre must be largely due to electrical excitement; 
nor is any reason apparent why its influence should be restricted to 
these two classes of bodies. Destruction of movement by impacts can 
scarcely be made to supply its place. Occasional illuminative effects 
may be derived from it, but none that are uniform and i)ermauent. 

The small bodies which, more or less plentifully distributed, appear 
to pervade space, are in this theory treated as the fundamental atoms 
of the universe. lint it is evident that we can not begin there. Tiiey 
have a history, marked perhaps by strange vicissitudes. They may be 
agents of regeneration, but they are almost certaiidy ])roducts of de- 
struction. Possibly they are seed as well as dust, and serve as the 
material link between the creation and decay of successive generations 
of suns. 

The orhifs of meteorites. — Prof. IT. A. Newton, of Yale College, lias 
carefully studied the evidence available for determining the "former

orbits ot those nieteoritcs that are in our collections and that were seen 
to fall." Of these stone-falls there are three classes: («) IIG falls for 
which we have statements as to the direction of the path through the 
air; {b) 94 falls of which we know the time of day; {c) 50 or more falls 
of which the history is too scanty to give the time of day. He is led 
to the following three propositions : 

1. The meteorites which we have in our cabinets, and which were 
seen to fall, were originally (as a class and with a very small num- 
ber of exceptions) moving about the sun in orbits that had inclinations 
less than OOC'; that is, their motions were direct, not retrograde. 

L'. The reason why we have only this class of stones in our collections 
is not one wholly or even mainly dependent ui)on the habits of men ; 
nor on the times when men are out of doors; nor on the places where 
men live; nor on any other principle of selection acting at or after the 
arrival of the stones at the ground. Either the stones, which are mov- 
ing in the solar system across the earth's orbit, move in general in direct 
orbits, or else for some reason the stones which move in re^trograde 
orbits do not in general come through the air in solid form. 

3. The perihelion-distances of nearly all the orbits in which these 
stones moved were not less than 0.5 nor more than 1.0, the earth's 
radius-vector being unity. {Observatory 11: 331.) 

At the meeting of the Koyal Society, November 15, 1888, Prof. G. U. 
Darwin read an important paper dealing with the mechanical conditions 
of a swarm of meteorites from a mathematical stand-point. 



SOLAR SYSTEM. 

Motion of the solar system in space. — Dr. Ludwig Strnve has made a 
careful comparison of the Pulkowa catalogues for 1855 with Auwer's 
re-reduction of JJradley (epoch 1755), and, as one of his results, has ob- 
tained a value of the motion of our system to which a good deal of in- 
terest attaches. As it was necessary to assume some connection be- 
tween the magnitude of a star and its distance, he adopted the follow- 
ing relative scale, regarding a star of the sixth magnitude as at the dis- 
tance unity :

the system is niovinj:^ is still in Hercules, right ascension 2G60.7, decli-

SUN. 

Rotation time of the sun. — Mr. Crew, of Johns Ilopkins University, 
has made a new determination of the time of revolution of the sun on 
its axis by comparing the Avave-lengths of certain lines in the spectrum 
when measured in liglit coming from two opposite limbs of the sun. By 
Doppler's principle the wave-length of the line in light from the ap- 
proaching limb ought to be shorter than in the light from the receding 
limb. The results obtained give a velocity of the photosphere at the 
sun's equator of 2.437 miles per second ; from this the rotation time is 
determined to be 25.88 days. Mr. Crew's observations indicate au in- 
crease in the angular velocity of the surface with increase in the helio- 
graphic latitude. This result is opposed to that obtained by Carrington 
and Spoerer from observations of suuspots. 



158 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Dr. Wilsiiig' has found the rotation period from observations of faculjB 
to bo 25. U3, and Ijus detected no variation in velocity depending u[)on 
the latitude. The difficulty of identifying faculre on their reappearance, 
and ol measuring their positions with exactness, makes the result some- 
what doubtful. 

Diameter of the sun. — Dr. Auwers has made a very exhaustive dis- 
cussion of the sun's horizontal and vertical diameters from the meridian 
observations of Greenwich, Washington, Oxford and Neuchatel with 
special reference to the alleged variations in the mean annual diameters 
following the period of the suuspot cycle. He concludes that there is 
no valid reason for suppo.^ing the sun's diameter to vary, and that the 
api)areut changes arise from insufiBciently determined personal equa- 
tions, lie also points out that meridian observations are quite unsuited 
for the determination of any possible elliptioity in the sun's disk, and 
that there is no reason to conclude from these results that such ellip- 
ticily exists. The several mean values of the sun's (assumed circular) 
diameter are : 

Greenwich 32' 2" .'M:^. Oxford 32' 3". 19. 

Wasbiugtoii 32' 2". 51. Ncncliritel 32' 3" .27. 

The discordances are ascribed to instrumental or uneliminated per- 
sonal peculiarities. 

In a second paper Dr. Auwers discusses the apparent changes of both 
the horizontal and vertical diameter during the course of a year, de- 
duced from meridian observations, and he concludes that the periodic 
variations in the monthly value of the diameters result not from 
physical changes in the sun, but from the efiect of temperature on the 
instruments and from difference in the quality of the telescoi)ic images 
at opposite seasons of the year. 

Another discussion of the horizontal diameter of the sun luvs been 
made by Professor di Legge from meridian transits of the sun observed 
at Campidoglio from 1874 to 1883. The mean horizontal diameter at 
mean distance deduced from 570G transits by four observer's on 2213 
days is 32' 2".38. 

Solar activity in 1887, 1888. — The decrease in spots, facuhi? and promi- 
nences which was so marked during 188G, and particularly during the 
latter part of that year, continued in 1887, and although there was no 
spotless period as long as that of November, 188(5, the mean si)otted 
area for the year was much below that of the year preceding. The days 
of greatest spotted area were July G, 7, and 8. The agreement in the 
general form of the curves for spot numbers and magnetic variation 
was not so close as in some previous years. The tluctuations in the num- 
bers and dimensions of the promineiiees were less than for the spots, 
but they also showed a maximum in July. Facuhe accorded well with 
the prominences, neither facuhv nor prominences following the spots in 
the marked depression of November. 



ASTRONOMY. 159 

During 1888 spots were few, small and in low latitudes, aud there 
were frequent intervals in which no spots at all were seen, longer inter- 
vals in fact than any since the minimum of 1879. The most prolific 
mouth as to entire spotted area, though not as to number of spots, was 
November, following immediately a long period of quiescence. There 
was a rough tendency of spots to certain solar longitudes and in lati- 
tude, they continued to be more numerous in the southern than in the 
northern hemisphere. Facula^ did not vary simultaneously with spots, 
but their diminution as compared with 188G and 1887, was slight. They 
showed a very noticeable development during the secondary maximum 
of Sejitember, while the prominences fell off considerably both in Sep- 
tember and November, but attained their greatest development in 
March and April. 

Solar spectrum. — Experiments made by Professor Trowbridge and 
Mr. C. 0. Hutchins at the Jefferson Physical Laboratory in Cambridge, 
have overthrown tlie proof brought forward in 1879 by Dr. Henry Dra- 
per of the existence of oxygen in the sun. They show that when suf- 
ficiently powerful apparatus is used to bring out minute details of the 
spectrum of oxygen and of the sun, the bright regions of the solar spec- 
trum disappear, and hence also the apparent coincidences between tliem 
and the spectrum of oxygen uijon which Dr. Draper based his proof. 
The bright bands obtained by Dr. Draper are in fact occupied by num- 
erous dark lines of variable intensity. 

Continuing their experiments however they have been led to con- 
clude that there is unmistakable evidence of the existence of carbon in 
the sun. 

In a valuable paper by Mr. C. C. Hutchins and Mr. E. L. Holden, 
evidence is brought forward to show the i)robable existehce in the sun 
of bismuth, silver, and platinum, while tin potassium, and lithium are 
more doubtful. For cadmium two perfect coincidences were found, 
while there was no good evidence in favor of the presence of lead 
cerium, molybdenum, uranium or vanadium. 

Prof. S. P. Langley has published in the American Journal of Science 
an abstract of a memoir on the invisible solar and lunar spectrum, in 
which he summarizes the result of investigations carried on at the Al- 
legheny Observatory in continuation of his previous researches on the 
infra- red of the solar spectrum to the extent ot about three microns. 
By means of the improved apparatus described, the extreme infra-red 
solar si^ectrum has now been searched from three to over eighteen mic- 
rons; and it is shown that in this region the ratios between solar and 
lunar heat are comi)letcly changed from what they are in the visible 
si)ectrum. While the solar light in the latter is about five hundred 
thousand times that of moonlight, the solar heat received in the invisi- 
ble part of the spectrum is ])robably less than five hundred time^ the 
lunar. These studies also promise important results for meteorology, 
by opening to observation the hitherto unknown region of the spectrum,

Total eclipse of the sun, August 19, 1887. — Unusual preparations were 
made throughout Europe for observing this eclipse, and great popular 
interest was manifested in the event, but, unfortunately, very few ob- 
servations of value were obtained on account of the generally cloudy 
weather that prevailed over the whole region west of the Ural moun- 
tains. The central line of the eclipse first struck the earth at a point 
53 miles west-northwest of Leipsic, where the sun was just rising. The 
Hue of totality, which was about 135 miles wide, then crossed Germany, 
Russia, Siberia, China and Japan, and left the earth at a jjoint in the 
Pacific Ocean in latitude 24^ 27' north, longitude 173^ 30' east. 

Eclipse of the moon, January 28, 1888.— The total eclipse of the moon 
on January 28, 1888, presented an unusually fiivorable opportunity for 
observing the occultations of a large number of faint stars, and, in 
order to secure as many observations of these phenomena as possible, 
Dr. DoUen, of Pulkowa, prepared and sent out to the principal observa- 
tories in Europe and America, a list of the stars to be occulted at each. 
He reports that he has received three hundred and ninety-six observa- 
tions of disappearances and three hundred and eighty-seven of re-ap- 
pearances, the places of observation being so favorably situated, that 
he considers that there is ample material for determining the position, 
the diameter, and possibly the ellipticity and parallax of the moon. 

SOLAR PARALLAX AND THE TRANSITS OP VENUS. 

Professor Harkness, at the meeting of the American Association in 
Cleveland on August 20, 1888, gave a description of the instruments 
and reduction processes employed by the United States Transit of 
Venus Commission in determining the solar parallax from the measure- 
ment of photographs taken at the ten American stations in December, 
1882; Washington, Cedar Keys, San Antonio, Cerro Eoblero, Prince- 
ton, and the Lick Observatory, in the United States; Santa Cruz and 
Santiago, South America; AVellington, South Africa, and Auckland, 
New Zealand. The preliminary value of the parallax deduced from the 
measured distances of the centres of the sun and of Venus on 1,475 
photographs is :r=S".847±0".012. The American photographs in 1874 
gave 7:=8".883± 0".034, and the French r=8".80. The distance of the 
sun corresponding to the value now obtained — 8". 847 — is 92,385,000 
miles, with a probable error of only 125,000 miles. These numbers are 
doubtless close approximations to the results which will be obtained 
from the complete discussion of all the photographs, but they cannot 
be regarded as final for several reasons, chief among which is the fact 
that the reduction of the position angles of Venus relatively to the 
sun's center is etill unfinished. 

The rex)ort of the committee ai)pointed to superintend the arrange- 



ASTRONOMY. 161 

ments for the expeditions sent out by the British Government to ob- 
serve the transit of Venus in 1882 has been published. It consists 
almost entirely of a discussion by Mr. Stone of the observations of con- 
tact. Expeditions were sent from England to Jamaica, Barbadoes,' 
Bermuda, Capo of Good Hope, Madagascar, New Zealand, and Bris- 
bane, Queensland, and the observers at all these stations were success- 
ful, except at Bri8])ane, where (he weather was cloudy. It will be 
remembered that the English committee did not feel satisfied with 
the photographic work in 1871, and for various reasons they deter- 
mined in the second transit to put their reliance entirely upon contact 
observations. From the observations of external contact at ingress 
Mr. Stone obtains a parallax of 8/'7(jOiO".122; from those of internal 
contact at ingress, 8".823±0".023; from those of internal contact at 
egress, 8".855±0".030, and from external contact at egress 8".953± 
()".048. The most probable combined result he considers to be 8".8.j2± 
0".0-'4, which corresponds to a mean distance of 92,5!i0,000i: miles 
between the earth and sun, with an uncertainty of 250,000 miles. 

The fourth voluuie of the report of the German Transit of Venus 
Commission was published in 1887, under the editorship of Dr. Auwers. 
It contains the observations in detail made with the heliometer by 
vaiious observers, both before and after the transits of 1874 and 1882, 
for the purpose of determining the instrumental constants. 

The report of the Brazilian expeditious has been printed in a quarto 
volume of 700 pages. Three stations were occupied: St. Thomas, in 
tbe Antilles; Olinda, Brazil; and Puuta Arenas, in the Straits of 
MageHan. The transit was observed by projecting the sun's image 
formed by an equatorial refractor of 6.3 inches aperture upon a screen 
and noting the times of contact. The result given for the value of the 
parallax from the internal contacts is 8".808. 

Professor Hall, using a value of the constant of aberration 20".4542, 
deduced from a series of observations of a Lyrae, made at the U. S. 
Naval Observatory during the years 1802 to 1867, and introducing 
Michelson and Newcomb\s determination of the velocity of light, has 
found for the solar parallax 8".810 ± 0".0062. 

PLANETS. 

Mars. — The observations of Perrotin, Terby, and Denning have con- 
firmed the presence of most of the so-called "canals," or narrow, dark 
lines, that were discovered by Schiai)ar('lli in 1877, and at subse<pieut 
oppositions, and in some cases the gemination or doubling of the canals 
has been detected. 

Considerable interest has been aroused in regard to jMars on account 
of the recent chanues rei)orted in the markings upon its surface by 
Perrotin and others. The chief change rei)orted was the apparent in- 
umhition or dis<ii)pearan(te of tlio "triangular continent," to whicli the 
name of Libya has been assigned, but ilie ic'ijorl has not been confirmed

by tlie observations of Scliiaparelli, Terby, Niesteii, and Hokleii. The 
observations of Professor Ib>l(leu and his assistants with the oG inch 
refractor began on Jnly IG, 1SS8, and were continued to August 10; 
the planet was therefore very unfavorably situated, its diameter being 
less than 9". Several of the most important canals were seen, but thcv 
were not double, appearing rather "as broad bands covering the spaces 
on M. Schiaparelli's map which are occupied by pairs of canals and by 
the spaces separating the members of each i)air." Professor Hall, with 
the Washington 26 inch refractor, has never been able to see these 
markings so sharjily drawn by European observers. The only remark- 
able change he noticed was the diminution in the size of the white spot 
at the sDuth pole of the planet. 

Numerous sketches of Mars showiug the canals or other markings 
have been published by Ilolden, Perrotin, Terby, and Niesten. No ad- 
ecjuate «^x[»laimtiou of the canals, or of the changes observed, has yet 
been otfered. 

Jupiter's satellites. — Astronomers have always been puzzled by 
the discordant appearances of the satellites during transit.j but more 
especially by the fact that the phenomena do not appW equally to all the 
satellites, or even in some instances to the same satellite in two succes- 
sive revolutions. The fourth, for instance, as it approaches the disk of 
Jui)iter becomes rapidly fainter till it arrives at contact. When once 
on the limb it shines with a moderate brilliancy for about ten or fifteen 
minutes, then becomes suddenly lost to view for a similar period, and 
lastly reappears, but as a dark spot, which grows darker and darker 
until it equals the blackness of its own shadow on the i)lanet. The ap- 
pearance of tlie second satellite, however, is entirely different, tor it 
seems never to have been seen otherwise than pure white during transit; 
whereas the first and third differ yet again from the preceding two. 
The former Is sometimes a steel gray, and at others a little darker, 
whereas the latter has been seen peifectly white and yet so black as to 
be mistaken for the fourth. Mr. E. J. Spitta has made a careful investi- 
gation of these interesting phenomena, communicating his results in a 
paper of some length, read at the meeting of the lloyal Astronomical 
Society, in November, 3887. His exi)eriments consisted essentially of 
numerous observations ujjou suitably prepared models representing the 
planet and satellites, and he concludes (see Nature 37:468, March 15, 
1888) that the probable reason the fourth satellite is uniforndy black 
during transit, when it has passed its period of disappearance, is, that 
its albedo is so low as to grant the difference between it and the back- 
ground necessary for a body to a[)i)ear black when superimposed on an- 
other. Its preliminary whiteness and disapi)earance are also shown to 
be a question of relative albedo, for they are due to the fact that a sphere 
at its limb loses so much in retiective power that up to that moment 
the satellite possesses sufticieiit albedo (as compared with the back- 
ground in that situation Uo maintain its whiteness. S^), too, with the sec- 



ASTRONOMY. 163 

ond satellite. Its albedo proves to be so high that it is capable of pre- 
serving its brilliancy throughout the entire transit. 

The third and first satellites evidently possess sides of dift'ercnt al- 
bedo, one high enough to maintain a brighter aspect than the other, or 
even, as in the case of the third, to make it appear white when one side 
is presented to the earth and dark when the other. Finally, to (]uote 
from the original paper, " it is not unreasonable to conclude that these 
anomalous phenomena are due to functional idiosyncrasies in the eye 
itself, rather than to physical peculiarities of the Jovian system." 

Mr. Denning has obtained from observations of the red spot made 
between February 12 and August 22, 1888, a rotation of 9'" 55"' 40«.21, 
nearly one second less than the spot gave in 1885-'86, though six sec- 
onds greater than in 1879. 

The value obtained for the mass of Jupiter by von Haerdtl in his dis- 
cussion of Winnecke's comet is 1: 101:7.152 ± 0.013G. 

Saturn. — The first number of a new series of publications called 
Supplements to the Pulkowa Observations contains an interesting me- 
moir by Dr. Hermann Struve ou the outer satellites of Saturn. He dis- 
cusses his own observations made with the 15-inch refractor in the 
years 1884-188G on lapetus, Titan, Rhea, and Dione, with a view to 
correcting the elements of these satellites, and also the values of tlie 
mass and ellipticity of Saturn. The mass of Saturn wjts found by Bcs- 
sel to be 1 : 3501. 6i 0.77, or with a slight correction indicated iu the pres- 
ent paper, 1 : 3502.5. Prof. Asaph Hall, ou the other hand, obtained the 
value 1 : 3481.3±0.51. Struve considers the rather large discordance be- 
tween these values <lue to systematic error in measuring the distance 
of a satellite from a limb, and his own observations consist entirely of 
comi)arisons of one satellite with another, either by differences of right 
ascension and north polar distance or of distance and position angle. 
His resulting value of the mass of Saturn agrees closely with Bessel's, 
being 1:3198. The correction of the elements has been carefully and 
laboriously carried out by the method of least squares. {The Observa- 
tory, 11 : 303, July, 1888.) 

Mr. G. W. Hill, in his i)aper on the motion of Hyperion aiul the mass 
of Titan, has obtained for the latter 1 : 4714, Saturn's mass being unity. 
Newcomb's corrected value, and Ormoud Stone's value, accord well with 
this. 

Uranus. — Dr. Valentiner, of the Karlsruhe Observatory, aiul his as- 
sistant. Dr. von Itebeur-Paschwitz, were able to detect in April, 18,S7, a 
slight ellipticity in the disk of the planet Uranus, but their instrument, 
a (J-inch equatorial, was not of sullicient power to make sa;tisfactory 
measures. 

Nep'JUNE. — Tisserand has shown that the progressive changes in the 
node and inclination of the orbit ol" the satellite of Neptunt^ can he ex- 
plained by supposing a slight tialtening of the surface of the planet; 
but the flattening woiihl probably be too slight to be measiired. Fur-

tber observations may enable tlie amount of the inclination to be more 
exactly determined, and at the same time will show whether the changes 
ill question are due to this cause alone. 

The minor planets. — Seventeen of these small bodies were added 
to the group during the years 1887 and 1888, making the total number 
now knowu 281. 

The new discoveries, with approximate elements, are given in the 
following table. All except number 270 were below the eleventh mag- 
nitude, and some slight confusion at first occurred in the numbering, 
owing to the difficulty of distinguishing a new asteroid from one 
already knowu in the absence of a very carefully computed ephemeris. 
For instance, numbers 268 aud 279 were at first thought to be identical 
with IJO, Medusa; 277 with 228, Agathe; 280 with 255, Oppavia; while 
an asteroid detected by Luther on April 11, 1887, and indei)endently by 
(Joggia on April 10, proved to be G9, Hesi)eria, which had been looked 
for in vain in 1882 and 1885; and one found by Borelly on May 12, 1888, 
to which the number 278 was assigned, though it was susi)ected to be 
identical with 150, Xanthippe, eventually" proved to be 110, Sirona.

Number 205 is remarkable on account of the very considerable in-

beiurf O.OG, in terms of tlie eartli's ineaii distance from the snn; it 
would therefore seem to otfer an additional means of determiuinj;- the 
value of the solar parallax. Number 270 also ai)i)roaehes quite near 
the earth, A =0.81. It will be noticed that 270, with its mean distance 
from the sun of 4.25, considerably jireater than that of any other aste- 
roid, lies upon the extreme outer limit of the grouj), and will at certain 
times, therefore, be brought quite close to Jupiter, and by the pertur- 
bations thus experienced may furnish further knowledge of the mas8 
of that planet. Number 281, with its small mean distance of 2.10 lies, 
on the other hand, near the inner border of the group; it is the sixty- 
eighth asteroid discovered by Dr. J. Palisa. 

Prof. Tietjen discontinues with the year 1888, the regular issue of the 
Circulars and Correspondence of the Berlin Jahrbuch, relatiug to as- 
teroids. Special attention will be given hereafter to the orbits of newly 
discovered planets presenting interesting peculiarities. 

The Annals of the Harvard Observatory, volume 18, No. 3. contains a 
discussion of a series of photometric observations of the asteroids by 
Mr. H. M. Parkhurst, extending from April to December, 1887. The 
method of observation was to note the time that the asteroid took to 
disai)pear after passing a transit wire, the telescope being stationary, 
and the light of the asteroid or comparison star sufteriug diminution 
either by a wedge or more frequently by a detlector — a piece of glass 
with nearly parallel sides placed in the telescope tube, about one sev- 
enth of the way from the focus to the object glass, and covering half 
the field. The conclusions reached by the author are as follows: 

(1) The phase correction can not be neglected, and is peculiar to each 
asteroid. 

(2) There may be, for certain asteroids, large errors from rotation. 

(3) In most eases, after the i)hase correction has been determined, the 
remaining unknown errors are less than the average variation of the 
fixed stars.

REPORTS OF OBSERVATORIES. 

In collecting tlic following notes npon observatories the latest avail- 
able information lias been ntilized, but it lias been found impossible to 
b-iiig the report in each case down to the end of 1888. The Viertel- 
jahrsschrift, for instance, from which the data for many European ob 
servatories are drawn, contains reports no later than 1887, and comi)ar 
atively few observatories publish independent annual reports. The 
writer's thanks are due to Sr. Felipe Valle for notes on the observatories 
of Mexico. 

Ann Arbor. — Prof. W. W. Campbell has been appointed assistant to 
fill the vacancy made by the removal of Mr. Schaeberle to the Lick Ob- 
servatory. 

Armayli. — Dr. Dreyer has devoted a large part of his time to the pre- 
paration and passing through the press of a new general catalogue of 
nebuhc. 

Bamberg. — An interesting description of the new observatory is given 
in the Vierteljahrsschrift for 1887, p. 333, by the director. Dr. E. Hart- 
wig. The sum of $45,000 was available for buildings, $17,500 for in- 
strnnients, the interest on $20,000 for salaries, and on $12,500 for main- 
tenance, with a reserve fund of about $20,000. The observatory con- 
sists of two buildings, the observing- rooms being in one and the offices 
and dwelling in the other. In the first there are two towers surmounted 
by domes and connecting them is the transit room. A long covered 
way from the dwelling gives easy access to the instruments. . The latter 
are a 7-inch Repsold-Merz heliometer similar to the one at the Cape, a 
10 in(!h refractor, a Repsold-Merz transit with zenith-telescope attach- 
ment, 6-inch Merz comet-seeker, clocks, chronometers, and subsidiary 
api)aratus. 

Basel (188fi). — The astronomical observatory and meteorological sta- 
tion are under the direction of Dr. E. llagenbach-Bischoff", assisted by 
Dr. Riggenbach. The instruments are used principfilly for the deter* 
mination of time and for the instruction of students. 

Beloit. — The equipment of the Smith Observatory, Beloit College, 
whi(;h was built in 1883 and ready for work in 1881, consists of an 
eciuatorial refractor of 9i inches aperture, objective by Clark, mount- 
ing by Warner and Swasey; a combined transit and zenith telescope 
of 2.0 inches aperture, made by Prof. C. S. Lyman {fee Anier. Jonr. Sc, 
XXX, p. 52); clocks, sidereal chronometer, chronograph and minor ap- 
l)aratus, and meteorological and photographic outfit. Directors: John 
Tatlock, jr., 1884-'85 ; C. A. Bacon, 1885. A local time service is main- 
tained, and meteorological observations are published daily. 

Berl-cley, California. — The "Students'" observatory of the University 
of California, established in 1887, is designed to furnish to undergrad- 
uates instruction in geodesy and the more practical parts of astronomy 
generally; as rating clocks and chronometers, determining geographical 



ASTRONOMY. 167 

latitudes and longitudes, etc. It is also designed to encourage study, 
on tlie part of the more advanced nnder-graduates, of astronomical 
phenomena, as far as they may be within the reach of young amateurs. 

A neat and sufficiently commodious observatory building, 50 feet long 
by 20 feet wide, on the average, has been built on a knoll in the univer- 
sity grounds 320 feet above mean sea-level. In the douie-room, at the 
east end of the observatory, is an equatorial refractor of GJ inciies clear 
aperture, objective (achromatic), by J. Byrn, of New York, the mount- 
ing, driving-clock, pier, etc., being l\y Fauth & Co., of Washington. 
With this telescope are six negative and as many more jiositive eye- 
pieces, and a fine position filar micrometer made bj' the same firm. A 
si)ectroscope, capable of attachment to the equatorial or of being used 
on a stand, is furnished with a Hint i)rism, and also with one of Row- 
land's diffraction gratings, having 14,334 lines to the inch. 

In the room next west are two of J. Green's standard barometers, and 
in a. specially prepared shed upon the north side, a wet bulb, a dry bulb, 
a maximum, and also a minimum thermometer, by H. J. Green, of N^ew 
York. In this shed is also placed one of Draper's self-registering "ther- 
mographs." 

On the northwest tower of the College of Letters are mounted a Rob- 
inson anemometer and a wind- vane. These instruments are connected 
by telegraph wires with an anemograph in the observatory, where the 
velocity and direction of the wind are automatically recorded. IMeteor- 
ological observations and records are made at 7 A. M., 2 p. M,, and 9 P. 
M. (standard or mean time of the i20th meridian of longitude). Monthly 
printed reports are made to the U. S. Signal Service office in San Fran- 
cisco. 

In the next room west is mounted a fine, large, portable '' transit and 
zenith telescope," of the type used by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic 
Survey, but having an objective 3 inches in diameter. 

Two diagonal and two direct eye-pieces belong to this instrument. 
In the same room is a Howard Standard mean time clock, with grav- 
ity escapement, mercurial compensating pendulum, and electric circuit 
connections. The clock is fastened to a solid gianite pier IS inches 
square and G feet long, which is inclosed in a brick ])ier reaching to solid 
rock 5 feet below the surface of the ground. The transit and eipuitorial 
are similarly founded. All the piers are disconnected from the floors of 
the observatory. A sidereal chronometer, made by Negus Bros., New 
York, is mounted upon one side of the transit pier. 

On a shelf at one side of the transit-room is an electro chronograph, 
by Fauth & Co., of Washington, and on another the switch-board made 
by the San Francisco Electric Company. An electric circuit runs 
through the clock, chronometer, chronograph, sounder, and relay, and 
also into the equatorial-room, from which time may be marked on the 
chronograpli by means of a break-circuit key. The switch-board is con- 
nected witli the Western Union telegraph line by a shortline to Dwight 
Way-Station, Berkeley.

The two rooms fiiitlier west are used respectively as a repair slio}) and 
a sleepiiig-rooni for the assistant. 

In a small house at the rear of the observatory, upon a brick pier si)e- 
cially made for the purpose, are mounted three seismographs, the J)u- 
plex, the Ewing- rotating, and the Gray, 

The latitude of the mercury basin in the center of the transit pier of 
the observatory has been found from tlie tirst series of observations (pre- 
liminary to a continued series) to be + 37° 52' 21", 7. Longitude west 
of Greenwich 8'' 9'" 2«.52. 

The observatory is in charge of Prof. Frank Soul^, professor of civil 
engineering and astronomy. University of California. 

Berlin. — The principal work of the meridian circle has been upon the 
Pnlkowa list of stars and Argelander's stars, with considerable proper 
motion ; a few comparison stars were observed, and preliminary experi- 
ments made to determine the influence of brightness of stars upon the 
observed time of transit. The 9-iuch equatorial has been employed upon 
comets, asteroids, and comparison stars, and the declinograph attached 
to this instrnment in observing zones iu the thicker parts of the milky- 
way. With the smaller meridian instrnment a series of observations of 
comjiarison stars has been begun, and with the heliometer measures of 
double stars and the Pleiades, In the annual reports of this observa- 
tory, given by Professor Foerster in the Vierteljahrsschrift, will be found 
interesting notes upon the performance of the clocks and time service. 

The Recheninstitut, under Professor Tietjen, has published, as usual, 
the Jahrbuch, and circulars relating to the minor planets, 

Bonn. — Dr. Schoenfeld reports satisfactory progress of the observa- 
tions and reductions of zone 4-400 to +50°. The remaining charts of 
the Southern Durchmnsterung have been completed and distributed, 
and an investigation of errors in star catalogues -covered by these 
charts is approaching completion. A few observations of variables 
have been made. Dr. Monuichmeyer succeeded Dr. Scheiner as assist- 
ant on January 1, 1887, the latter having accepted a position at Pots- 
dam. 

Bordeaux. — The second volume of Ann ales, published in 1887, con- 
tains a memoir by Flamme upon elliptic motion of the planets, a deter- 
mination of the latitude by Rayet, and a series of observations made 
with the meridian circle for a revision of Oeltzen's catalogue of Argel- 
ander's southern stars; also magnetic and meteorological observations, 

Breslan. — Observations mainly meteorological and magnetic, and for 
the time service. 

Brighton {Massachusetts).— Mr. E. F. Sawyer, of Canibridgeport, has 
removed to Brighton, upon the outskirts of Boston, and continues his 
observations of variables. 

Brool-h/n {New Yorl:). — Mr. H. M. Parkliurst's private observatory 
was originally built in 18G2 and i)rovided with a G-inch telescope. It 
was rebuilt in 1877 and a 9-inch retractor was mounted. A series of

wich. 

JirusseU, — A catalogue of 10,792 stars upon which work was begun 
more than thirty years ago by Quetelet has at length been finished. 
M. Stuyvaert is engaged ui)on the formation of a catalogue of compari- 
son-stars, which have appeared in volumes 107 and 108 of the Astrono- 
niische Nachrichten. Double stars, comets, and occultatious by the 
moon have been observed with the.e(piatorialsof 38 and 15 centimeters, 
and numerous physical observations of the moon and planets have also 
been made. M. I'abbe Spec is especially occupied with a study of solar 
spots and protuberances, and M. Fievez with the study of the solar 
spectrum. Tlie new observatory at Uccle is practically finished. 

Camhriflf/e {England). — Considerable progress has been made with the 
zone +250 to +30O. 

Camden {New Jersey). — Mr. E. E. Keed has erected a small private 
observatory, with 6 inch equatorial. 

Ca2)e of Good Hope — With the transit-circle regular observations 
have been continued of the Sun, Mercury, Venus, stars on the list of 
the Cape ten-year catalogue for 1890, comet comparison stars, stars 
occulted by the Moou, stars employed in the latitude and longitude 
determinations of the Geodetic Survey, and stars employed in zones 
for determining the scale value of the heliometer. The large theodolite 
has been used for observations of circumpolars and latitude stars, the 
zenith telescope for latitude, and the equatorial for observations -of 
comets. The i)hotograi)hic "Durchmusterung" is proceeding rapi<lly, 
the instrument being kept at work by two observers from evening 
twilight till dawn. The reduction of the plates from declination — 9(P 
to —77^'^ has been completed by Professor Kapteyn, and plates for 
measurement to — 57° have been sent to him. It is expected that the 
photographs will be completed by the end of 1889; their reduction 
will probably require two years longer. The new heliometer was re- 
ceived from Kepsold, and mounted in the latter part of 1887; it is 
pronounced by Dr. Gill the most powerful and convenient instrument 
for refined micrometric research at present in existence. A complete 
working programme has been prepared, including the determination of 
the parallax of all the southern stars brighter than magnitude 2.0 and 
all the stars most remarkable for proi)er motion. Some i)rogress has 
been made in the determination of the constants of the instrumtnt. 
The meridian observations for 1882, 1883, and 1884, occultatious ob- 
served from 1835 to 1880, forming vol. 1, part 4 of the Anuals, and a 
discussion of the variations of the instrumental adjustments of the 
transit circle have been published.

length of tlie building east and west is SO feet, nortli and south 100 
feet. The clock-room is on the lirst tloor of the main building, and is 
27 feet in diameter. The large circular pier for the 10 inch equatorial 
(to be constructed by Brashear) is in the middle of this room, suitably 
cased to a height of 7^ feet, and provided with shelving. The mean- 
time and sidereal clocks, both by Howard, are mounted in recesses in 
the east and west faces of this pier. In the west wing, upon the same 
lioor, is the library with about 1,400 bound volumes, a small study or 
class room, and a janitor's room; to the north is the prime vertical of 
3-incli aperture (Fauth), aud beyond this a class and lecture room. A 
small dome over the north wing covers the 8J inch Clark refractor. In 
the east wing is mounted a fine Repsold meridian circle of 4.8 inches 
aperture, which is under the charge of Dr. H. 0. Wilson. The chrono- 
gr;ii)h, chronometer, and time-distributing apparatus are in the clock- 
room. A time-service over more than 12,000 miles of railway is under 
the immediate care of Miss C. R. Willard. 

Theco-ordiuatesof the observatory provisionally adopted are (Astron. 
Nachr. 120:85): latitude +44° 27' 41"; longitude 6" 12'" 3G«.0 west of 
Greenwich. 

Cincinnati. — A zone catalogue of 4,050 stars observed with the 3-inch 
transit was published in 1887. In September, 1888, a new meridian cir- 
cle, by Fauth & Co., was mounted, one of the first large instruments of 
this class made in the United States. The clear aperture of the object- 
glass is 5| inches, and the focal length 70 in(;hes; object-glass and mi- 
crometer are inter-changeable. The piers are of masonry to the floor- 
level, and from there up an iron frame work bricked inside to within a 
foot of the top. The pivots are of steel, glass hard. There are two solid 
circles, 24 inches in diameter; one is divided very coarsely to half de- 
grees only : the other has two sets of graduation upon a silver band, 
both of them to 5'. The inner one is somewhat heavier than the other, 
and does not pretend to great accuracy, being used merely for setting. 
The outer graduation alone is visible in the reading miscroscopes; as far 
as Professor Porter has carried his investigation the errors of this grad- 
uation are very small. Electric illumination has been used throughout 
and has been found practically ])erfect. A detailed description of the 
instrument will be found in the Sidereal Messenger for January, 1880. 

Cointe (Liege). — Observations of Titan and lapetus have furnished a 
determination of the mass of Saturn. The meridian circle has been used 
for zone observations. 

Copenhagen. — Mr. Nielsen has recently erected a private observatory 
with a 6i inch refractor by Reinfelder & Hertel, intended principally 
for selenographical work. 

Cordoba. — Volumes 6 and 0, containing the zone observations made in 
1875 and 187G, have been published. 

Dearborn. — The report for 1885 and 1886, which has not previously 
been noticed, contains a list of nebula) discoyered by Professor Saflbrd 



ASTRONOMY. 171 

in 18GG-'08; papers on the iiiotioii of the liiuar ai)si<le.s and on tlie com- 
panion of Sirius by Professor Colbert; and an illustrated paper on the 
physical aspect of Jupiter, a catalogue of 200 new double stars, and a 
des(;riptiou of a printing chronograph by Professor Hough. In the 
course of the two years referred to 130 new double stars were discov- 
ered and measured. 

In consequence of the dissolution of the University of Chicago the 
Chicago Astronomical Society dismounted their instruments in the 
early i)art of 1888, and transferred the care of the observatory to the 
Northwestern University, at Evanston, Illinois, 12 miles from the busi- 
ness center of Chicago, about 16 miles north and 3 miles west of the old 
site, and some 300 feet from the shore of Lake Michigan. The corner 
stone of a new building, the gift of James B. Ilobbs, was laid June 24, 
1888. The plau includes a tower and dome for the 18.^-inch equatorial, 
meridian circle room, library, and about eight rooms for other purposes; 
the whole to be erected at a cost of $25,000. The approximate position 
is given: Latitude, -|-42o 3'; longitude, 5'' 50'" 42'* west of Greenwich. 

Denver. — A new observatory, the gift of Mr. H. B. Chamberlin to the 
University of Denver, is being built, about 7 miles from the city of 
Denver, at an altitude of 5,000 feet above sea-level. The i)rincipal 
instrument is to be a 20-inch Clark refractor. Director, Prof. U. A. 
Howe. 

Dresden. — Baron von Engelhardt's older observatory was built in 
187T (latitude, -|-5lo 2' 31" ; longitude, 0'' 54"' 53''.3 east of Greenwich), 
and contained an 8-inch Grubb equatorial, a 2-inch Cooke transit, ami a 
sidereal clock by Knoblich. The present observatory was built in 1879 
somewhat nearer the outskirts of Dresden (latitude, +51o 2' 10"; longi- 
tude, 0'' 54"' 648.7 east of Greenwich). It consists of a three-story tower, 
the upper story being surmounted by a cylindrical "dome" covering a 
12-inch Grubb equatorial. The second floor connects with the transit- 
room, in which is a " broken-back" transit, by Bamberg, of 2.7 inches 
aperture. There is also a very complete equipment of subsidiary appa- 
rat us, clocks, chronometers, chronograph, etc. Ui)on the adjoining roof 
of the baron's residence is a little comet observatory arranged for two 
instruments, one of 6.4 inches aperture and the other of 3.7 inches. The 
larger instrument, which is similar to the Strassburg comet-seeker, is 
of somewhat novel construction. The telescope is fastened by two long 
arms to the back of a chair so that the eye-end comes at a convenient 
l)osition for the observer; the arms are jjivoted to the chair- back, per- 
mitting a motion in altitude, while the chair may be rotated in a/imuth, 
so that the astronomer can examine the whole sky rapidly and without 
fatigue. 

The numerous and valuable observations of occultations, ])henomena 
of Jupiter's satellites, comets, planets, new stars, nebuhe, and clusters 
were collected and published in the latter i)art of 1886, together with an 
illustrated description of the observatory and instruments. Similar ob-

serviitions liave been continued during the }iast two years, and consider- 
able progress has also been made with a series of micrometric measures 
of all stars in Bradley and Argelander, which have an annual j^roper 
motion of at least 0",1, with companions not below the tenth magnitude, 
and distance not greater than :V. 

Dresden {K. math. Salon). — Meteorological observations and a local 
time service. 

JJuneeht. — Spectroscopic work has consisted of measures upon stars 
and nebulae and a study of the low-sun atmospheric lines, as seen from 
an observing station established upon a neighboring hill. Circulars of 
astrouomicnl information, the weekly firing of the time gun, and the 
dail5*^ meteorological observations have been continued as in former 
years. A catalogue of the library is in press. 

Dunsinlc. — The meridian circle has been devoted to observations of a 
list of about 1,000 stars suspected of large proper motion. Part vi of 
"Observations" was issued in 18S8, containing the observations from 
1881 to 1885 made with the meridian circle on 1,012 stars of the south- 
ern Durchmusterung requiring re observation, 

JJilsseldorf. — Observations of comets and asteroids and ephemerides 
of the latter. 

Ealing. — Mr. Common has completed his 5-foot reflector. 

Edinburgh . — Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth resigned in August, 1888, the ap- 
pointments (which he has held since 1840) of regius professor of prac- 
tical astronomy in the University of Edinburgh and astronomer royal 
for Ireland, and he has given a very discouraging account of the finan- 
cial condition of the institution. Br. Ealph Copeland, of the Dun Bcht 
Observatory, has been appointed as his successor. 

Geneva. — In addition to the regular work of rating chronometers and 
watches, observations have been made of comets, ofnebuljE, and of the 
rings of Saturn. A series of observations made by Plantamour and 
von Oppolzer, in 1881, for the purpose of determining the difference of 
longitude between Geneva and Vienna, have been discussed, giving a 
mean value of the difference of longitude of 40'" 44*.C4: (Geneva west of 
Vienna). 

Geneva {Wew York). — Mr. William Smith built in 1888 a small private 
observatory, which he has placed in charge of JMr. W. 11. Brooks, well 
known for his discoveries of comets. The instrumental equipment is 
as follows: equatorial refractor, objective, by Clacey, of 10^ inches 
aperture and 9 feet 9 inches focal length, with a photographic corrector 
of the same aperture. The mounting is by Warner & Swasey, and em- 
bodies numerous convenient devices. There is a large Gundlach peri- 
scopic comet eye-piece of 3 inches equivalent focus, with a silvered flat 
diagonal of 3J inches, a position micrometer, polarizing eye piece, uni- 
versal Brashear spectroscope fitted with grating and prisms, and suited 
for stellar, solar, or laboratory work. The meridian circle is by Warner 



ASTRONOMY, 173 

& Swasey, 4-inch aperture and 40 inch focus, with Ifi-inch circles: one 
circle is coarsely divided, the other is divided to 5' and is read by two 
microscopes to 1". The sidereal clock was made by the Self-winding 
Clock Company, of Brooklyn, New York; it has Gerry's patent gravity 
escapement, and is autonuitically wound by a small electric motor. Tbe 
chronograph was designed and constructed by the director. Outside 
the observatory proper, but ready for occasional use, are tlie O-inch, 
5-inch, and 3-iuch retlectors, also built by Mr. Brooks, and used by him 
at Phelps, New York, in searching for comets. 

Georfietonm {District of Columbia). — The observ^atory of Georgetowu 
College (built in 1845) was placed under the charge of Father J. G. Ilagen, 
S. J., in the winter of 1888. The buildings and instruments, \thich 
have been but little used for nearly forty years, have been thoroughly 
renovated at considerable exi)ense. Father Hagen has not as yet laid 
out any plan for the future work of the institution. 

Glmgow [Seotland). — Observations with the transit circle of a list of 
stars in the earlier volume of Weisse's Bessel. 

Glasf/ow ( United States). — See Morrison Observatory. 

Gohlis. — The private observatory of Herr Winkler Avas transferred 
in 1887 from Gohlis, near Leipzig, to the neighborhood of Jena — latitude, 
+50O 55' 35".6; longitude, Oi' 46'° 20^8 east of 'Greenwich. 

Gt>#/t«.— Considerable progress has been made in the reduction of the 
zone observations (25° — 20°). With the meridian circle observatit)ns 
of moon culminations and of stars of Majer's catalogue have been 
made, and with the equatorial, observations of comets, of asteroids, 
and of Gore's variable near x^ Orionis. 

Dr. Becker has, at the request of Professor Newcomb, collected in a 
convenient form Hansen's formulae for the general perturbations by 
Jupiter and has ap[)lied them to the planet Euiynome. It will be re- 
membered that Prof. J. C. Watson made provision in his will for the 
computation of tables of the asteroids discovered by him, which will 
readily give the places of the planets at future oppositions. Dr. Becker's 
work is for the purjiose of facilitating these computations. 

Dr. Paul Harzer succeeded Dr. Becker as director on December 1. 1887. 

GiUtingcn (1S8G). — Dr. Schur assumed charge of the observatory on 
April 1, 1880, and immediately set to work to have much needed and 
very extensive repairs made in the buildings and instruments. As most 
of the instfuments have been dismounted, the principal work done has 
been upon a new reduction of the zone observations made by Jvlinker- 
fues from 1858 to 1803. A G-iuch Kepsold heliometer has been ordered. 
The [)ersonnel of the observatory consists (with the director) of observ- 
ator, Dr. Battermaun; assistant, Herr Clemens, and computer, Heidorn. 

Greenwich. — The regular meridian observations of the sun, moon, and 
major and minor planets have been kept up as before, and satisfactory 
progress has been made with tbe reductions for a new ten-year cata- 
logue (1877-'80). Observations of the moon have been made with the

altazimuth, and of comets wijth the et]iiatorial. The spectroscopic ob- 
servatious for determiiiiiig tlie motions of stars in the line of sight, the 
photoheliographic record of the sun's surface, the magnetic and meteoro- 
logical observations, the chronometer and time service are also contin- 
ued as heretofore. A crown disk for the 28-inch objective, has, after 
several failures, been obtained by Grubb from Chance & Co., and the 
Treasury has granted the necessary funds for a 13 inch photographic 
telescope to enable the observatory to take its share in the scheme for 
forming a photographic map of the heavens. Numerous experiments 
have been made in stellar photograpiiy in preparation for this work. 
An 18-foot dome for a photi)graphic equatorial was built in 1888, and 
at the same time an addition was made to the space available for com- 
l)uting rooms. The annual volume for 1886 has been printed aiid dis- 
tributed. We learn that provision has been made for a redetermina- 
tion of the difference of longitude between Greenwich and Paris. The 
astronomer royal in his last report draws attention to the recently 
averted danger from ai proposed railway tunnel within 810 yards of the 
observatory. He also points out the inadequacy of the present staff to 
handle properly the ever increasing amount of work demanded fioni a 
national observatory, as new fields of research are opened up for in- 
vestigation. 

Grif/non. — Sketches of the planets, observations of meteors, meteoro- 
logical observations, and microscopical studies of cosmi(;al dust. Di- 
rector, Fr. Mayeul Lamey. 

Grinnell. — Iowa College has a small observatory, for instruction, with 
an Sinch Clark refractor, mounted in April, 1888. 

Guadalajara (Mexico). — Piivate observatory of Ingeneiro Carlos F. de 
Landero; latitude, + 20° 40' 31".9; longitude, 6^' 53'" 23^00 west of 
Greenwich. 

Haiphong (Tonlcin). — The longitude of the small observatory as tele- 
graphically determined by connection with Hong Kong April 5, G, 7, 

1887, is 1^ 6'" 44^04 east of Greenwich. 

Harrow. — The work of determining the places of conqiarision stars 
and other selected small stars has been continued with the meridian 
circle. Observations of comets have been made with the equatorial. 

Harvard. — Professor Pickering describes the progress of his work 
under three principal heads : The older instruments of the observatory, 
the Draj)er memorial, and the Boyden fund. The 15-inch equatorial has 
been used upon comets, eclii)ses of Jupiter satellites, and photometric 
observations of asteroids. The meridian circle zone catalogue is pass- 
ing through the press, ami some progress has been made in observing 
the new zone, —9° 50' to — 14o ic The work upon which the meridian 
photoQieter has been employed since 1882 was finished September 29, 

1888. The most laborious part of this work was the determination of 
the brightness of stars of the ninth magnitude in zones 20 minutes in 
■width at intervals of 5 degrees from the north pole to the declination 



ASTKONOMY. 1 75 

— 20°. This iiistriiiiient has bceu dismounted and sent to Peru, where 
the work will be continued to the south pole, and in order to extend the 
investijjjation from stars of the ninth to stars of the fourteenth maj^ni- 
tude, an instrument of somewhat similar form but with an objective of 
12 inches aperture (described under Instruments) has been mounted at 
Cambridge. 

The first extensive research undertaken with the Henry Drai)er me- 
morial fuuds, a catalogue of the spectra of 10,875 stars, covering the en- 
tire sky north of — 25°, is nearly completed. This work has been done 
with the 8-iuch Bache telescope. A second series of photograi)hs made 
with longer exposures, and so taking in fainter stars, will soon be tin- 
ished, and this instrument will likewise be sent to Peru, where the ob- 
servations will be extended to the south pole. The detailed study of 
the brighter stars with the 11-iuch Draper telescope has been continued, 
and the 15-inch and 28-iuch reflectors constructed by Dr. Draper have 
been mounted and are employed in studying the spectra of variables. 

The Boyden fund has been devoted to collecting necessary informa- 
tion in reganl to the meteorological conditions at high altitudes, and in 
furtherance of this object several stations in Colorado were occupied 
during the summer of 1887 by a party from the observatory provided 
with special photograi)hic ai)paratus. In December, 1888, a fully 
equipped expedition went out to California to observe the total solar 
eclipse on January 1, 18S9, and having successfully completed that task, 
they procewled to the southern hemisphere to occupy for several years 
an elevated station in Peru, and to carry out the photographic and 
photometric work mentioned above. 

Tlie compihition of observations of variable stars, the telegraphic 
announcement of astronomical discoveries, and the time service have 
been continued as in i)revions years, Volutne 18 of the Annals is issued 
in parts in order to provide promi)t publication for special investiga- 
tions. These, as well as the Draper-memorial Eeports, have received 
notice elsewhere. The Bulletin of the New England Meteorological 
{Society and a good deal of other meteorological work will also appear 
in tilt' Annals. The observatory buildings have been increased by the 
addition of two neighboring houses, and also by the erection of small 
detached and inexpensive buildings to cover the different telescopes 
that have been added to the equipment. 

Harerford. — Founded in 1832, enlarged in 1883. Instruments: 10- 
iiich refractor, by Clark; SL-inch refractor, re-ground, by <31ark; 8:|^ inch 
silver-on-glass reflector; J^f-inch zenith telescope. J)irectors: Joseph (r. 

Harlan, 1853; Samuel J. Gummerc, ; Samuel Alsop, jr., 1875; Isaac 

t^harpless, 1882; Francis P. Leavenworth, 1887. Professor Leaven- 
worth has published a number of observations of comets. 

Hehing/ors.—Tlm 7-inch refractor has been used for observations of 
comets, both determinations of position and careful examination of 
physical characteristics. The transit instrtim/nt has hcvu re- modelled

divided to 2' and read by four microscopes. 

Halifax —Observations of the phenomena of Jupiter's and Saturn's 
satellites, occultations, and transits of stars for time. 

Mercny. — The chief work has been on celestial pliotogra[)liy. Photo- 
graphs of numerous star-clusters, of the moon, planets, comets, and of 
stellar spectra have been obtained. 

Hurstside, West Molesey^ EnqJand. — Sir Henry Thompson has built a 
private observatory with a 12inch Cooke equatorial, to which is fitted 
a photographic objective and large prismatic objective for photograph- 
ing stellar s])ectra. 

Kalocsa. — A careful series of observations of solar phenomena is 
carried on by the director. Father Ji lius F6uyi. 

Kew. — Magnetic, meteorological, and solar observations, verification 
of instruments, and the rating of watches and chronometers have been 
continued. 

jCieL — The zone catalogue, +55^ to +65°, containing 14,080 stars, 
was finished and prepared for press in 1887. The Kiel observatory is 
the central station for the telegraphic distribution of astronomical in- 
formation upon the continent, and in connection with this service con- 
siderable work has been done upon the new comets and asteroids by 
members of its staff. 

Konigfiberg. — observations of the sun and major planets, of time 
stars and comparison stars, have been made with the Repsold circle; 
observations of double stars, comets, and measures for stellar parallax 
with the heliometer. The director, Dr. E. Luther, died October 17, 
1887, and was succeeded April 1, 1888, by Dr. C. F. W. Peters. 

KremsmUnster. — The meridian circle has been repaired and remounted 
in a new building 4".023 north and 0^22 i west of its old position. 
Comet observations have been made with the refractor. 

La Plata. — Observations of comets by M. Beuf and his assistants 
have been published. The position of the observatory is given as, 
latitude, —34° 54' Si)".3; longitude, 4'^ 0"' 58\0 west of Paris. (Conipt. 
Rend., 106: 1500.) The construction is progressing rapidly, and when 
completed this will be one of the best equipped observatories in the 
southern hemisphere. 

LcipzUi {University Observatory). — The zone observations +5° to 
+ 15° are practically finished. A new Rei)sold heliometer of 162 milli- 
meters aperture was mounted in 1886, and is described, together with 
its new dome, at some length in Dr. Brans' report for 1887: an impor- 
tant addition to the working force is Herr " Mechaniker" Lohm. 

Leipzifj. — Dr. Engellman devoted most of his time to measures of 
double stars. 

Lich: — An important event of the year 1888 was the transfer, on Juno 
1, of the Lick O'oservatc.ry to the regents of the University of Cali- 
fornia. The equipment of tiie Lick Observatory has been previously

described in tbese reports and elsewhere, bnt it may not perhaps be su- 
perfluous to recapitubite briefly here, relerring for details to Vol. 1 of 
the observatory publications, or to an article by Professor Holdeu in 
the Sidereal Messeuger for February, 1888. The mounting of the 30- 
iiicli equatorial is referred to at some length in the present report under 
the heading " Instruments." 

The njain observatory building is 287 feet loug, including the 75 foot 
dome at its southern end, and contains a hall 1.5 feet wide running the 
whole length, offices and computing rooms, the library, clock-room, 
visitors' room, etc., and at the northwest corner stands the 25-foot dome 
for the 12-inch equatorial. The other buildings on the mountain sum- 
mit are the meridian-circle house, transit-house, photoheliograph, lab- 
oratory, several temporary workshops, and the dwelling for the astrono- 
mers. The instrumental equipment consists of the 30-inch, 12 inch, 
and GJ inch equatorials, 4 inch comet-seeker, C inch meridian-circle, 
4-inch transit and zenith telescope, 2 inch universal instrument, photo- 
heliograph, declinograph, five clocks, several chronometers, four "chro- 
nographs, and minor apparatus. The costof theinstruments'with their 
mountings and transi)ortation, aggregated about $200,000; bnildings 
and other expenses amounted to about $375,000; leaving in the neigh- 
borhood of $125,000 for a permanent endowment fund. In addition to 
what may be derived from the investment of this sum, the^observatory 
is to be allowed for its maintenance as a department of the University 
of California the sum of $19,188 a year. The astroiu^mical staff con- 
sists of E. S. Ilolden, director and astronomer; S. ^Y. Burnham, J. M. 
Schaeberle, J. E. Keeler, E. E. Barnard, astronomers; C. B. Hill, assist- 
ant astronomer, secretary, and librarian. The first volumetof "Publi- 
cations" appeared before the real work of the observatory nad begun, 
and it is, therefore, mainly historical and descriptive. It contains Mr. 
Lick's deeds of trust. Professor Newcomb's report on glass for object- 
ives, Mr. Burnham's reports upon the site in 1879' and 1881, -descrip- 
tions of the buildings and instruments, an account of theiengiueering 
and building at Mount Hamilton in the years 1880-1885, observations 
of the transit of Mercury in 1881 and of Venus in 1882, geological re- 
ports, meteorological observations, 1880-1885, and an extensive series 
of reduction tables for the latitude of the observatory. There have 
been published in scientific journals and in the daily press interesting 
notes u[)on nebuliT3 and planetary markings as shown by the 3G-inch 
refractor, and the discoveries of new comets and double stars. Pro- 
fessor Holden attributes the steady-seeing at Mount Hamilton to the 
coast fogs, which roll in from the sea every afternoon in the summer, 
rising 1,500 to 2,000 feet, covering the hot valley and preventing radia- 
tion from it. The nights of summer and autumn — April to October or 
Novend)er — are fonnd to be excellent both as to clearness and steadi- 
ness; the daylight hours are less satisfactory, and in winter the seeing 
is not much better than at lower altitudes.

Litchfield. — Dr. Peters is still at work iii)on his ecliptic cbarts; be 
exi)ects to i-ssue shortly a secoud iiistallmejit of twenty. 

Liverpool. — The tiiiie-guii lias been lired with regularity, chronome- 
ters tested, and meteorological observations conducted as heretofore. 

Lund. — Dr. Dun6r has continued his observatious of variable stars 
and spectra of red stars, and with a large solar spectro8COi)e, i)rovide(l 
with one of Eowland's gratings, he has made an important investigation 
of the period of rotation of the sun. Photographs of the solar spectrum 
were made as a check upon the micrometer measures. 

Lyme Regis. — See Ivousdon. 

McGormick. — The 2Ginch equatorial is still devoted chiefly to the 
study of nebula3. Mr. Leaveuworth resigned as assistant in Septenibei-, 
1887, to take charge of the Haverford College observatory. Professor 
Stone expresses continued satisfaction with the electric illumination of 
the equatorial. 

Madras. — Mr. Norman K. Pogson has published in two volumes tlie 
results of a series of observatious of star places made with the 5.^-inch 
meridian circle, the first volume giving, after a brief history and descnji- 
tiou of the observatory, the "separate results" and annual catalogues 
for 1802, 18G3, and 1804, and the second volume "separate results" and 
anuual catalogues for 1805, 1800, and 1807. 

Mauritius. — Principal activity is in the observation of meteorological 
and magnetic phenomena, and in the photographic record of the state 
of the solar surface by means of the photoheliograph. 

Mazatlan {Sinaloa). — Founded in 1879 and intended ])rincipally for 
the time service, and is supported by the department of public works. 
Its directors have been: Ingo. Fiacro Quijano, 1879-'84; L. Gutierrez, 
1881; F. Weidner, 1884; C. Camilla, 1885-'87; L. Acosta, 18S7. Instru- 
ments: Meridian instrument, by Fauth & Co., aperture 0"'.07G {o inches), 
focal length 0'".787 (31 inches); equatorial, by W. Gregg, New York, 
0'".15 (6 inches), aperture; Trough ton & Simms altazimuth, and Negus 
chronometer. Latitude, +23^ 11' 22".81 ; longitude, 7'' 5'» 35«.07 west of 
Greenwich. 

Melbourne. — The mirrors of the 4 foot Cassegrainian reflector have 
become so tarnished as to interfere materially with the observation of 
the fainter nobuhe. The sum of $5,000 has been appropriated to enable 
the observatory to take part in the stellar photographic scheme of the 
Paris conference. 

Mexico. — The Central Astronomical Observatory in the city of Mex- 
ico was founded in 1878. It is intended for purposes of instruction, 
and esi)ecially for co-operating in geodetic work and for maintaining 
the time-service of the capital. The principal instruments are a 
meridian telescope, by Trough ton & Simms, of 0"'.0G9 aperture and 
1°'.1G focus; a zenith telescope, by the same makers, of 0^.070 aperture 
1'".22 focus ; an altazimuth, by the same, with 0'".305 (12-incli) circles ; a 
^mall Burow refractor, Fauth chronograph, sidereal clock by Vasquez,

two BlisH break-circuit cbronoineters, several mean time clironoiiieters, 
aud a fillet clirouograpb. The director lias also uiuler his charge the 
geodetic, topograpliic, and astronoini(;nl instruments of tlie department 
of public works. Position of the observatory: Latitnde,-fl9'^2r/ 1"..3; 
longitude, G'> 3G"» 3L^^); altitude, 2,1285'"'.'J: (7,500 feet). Directors: Sr. 
Ingeneiro Geografo Bon Francisco Jitninez from 1878 till his death, 
November 4, 1881, when lie was succeeded by Sr. Don Leandro Fer- 
nandez. 

jMilan. — A new 18-inch refractor, objective by Merz, mounting by 
Eepsold, was i)ut in place in 188(5, and has been devoted principally to 
the measurement of double stars. The smaller (8 inch) equatoiial has 
been used for observations of comets and of double stars in rai)id 
orbital motion. The markings on Mars were examined with both in- 
struments. 

Morrison observatory was establishe<l in 1875 through the efforts 
of the present director, Prof. C. W. Pritchett, aided by the liberality 
of Miss Berenice Morrison, whose name the institution bears. The 
principal instruments are a lli;^inch Clark equatorial and an excellent 
O-inch Troughton & Simms meridian circle, similar in plan to the me- 
ridian circle of the Harvard Observatory. The first number of the 
publications is a well printed volume of 111 pages, giving an account 
of the founding of the observatory, a full description of the building 
and instruments, and the observations in detail. The latter consist 
mainly of measures of double stars, observations of planets, comets, 
occultatious by the moon, etc. A full discussion is given of the geo- 
graphi<-al co-ordinntes of the meridian ]>ier, the longitude being deter- 
mined by an exchange of signals with Washington in 1880. There are 
several drawings of the observatory, and sketches of Saturn and of 
comets. The work is now much restricted owing to the inadeiiuacy of 
funds. 

Munich. — The zone observations with the m»^ridian circle are con- 
tinued, and a"new Munich catalogue is going tiirough the press. The 
10^ inch refractor has been used for obsi^rvations of comets, measures 
of stars in the cluster h Persei, and observations for stellar parallax. 
Some photometric observations have also been made. 

Natal. — liecent work has been largely in meteorology. The obser- 
vatory has been seriously crippled by the lack of funds. 

Nice. — The first volume of the annals is to contain a description of 
the observatory aud instruments, and is expected shortly; the second 
volume has already been published, and the third volume, also in 
preparation, will contain Thollon's study of the solar si)ectrum. Vol* 
2 is devoted mainly to the determination of the coordi nates of tbe ob- 
servatory and to measures of double stars. There are also observations 
of comets and planets, and notes on solar spectroscopy and the red- 
glows. The position of the observatory at present adopted is: Latitude, 
+ 430 43' 1G".1); longitude, 0»' 19"' 5K2'J east of Paris.

North Carolina University. — Professor Love, of the University of 
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, has called attention to an early attempt 
to establish an astronomical observatory in the United States which 
seems to have remained unjiotieed by astronomers. Professor Cald- 
well, the president of the university, went to Europe in 18i4 to pur- 
chase books and apparatus, and spent the greater part of $3,361.35 for 
astronomical instruments; this was four years before the purchase of a 
telescope by Yale. The foundations of the observatory were laid in 
1831, and the building was finished iu 1832, six years before the Hop- 
kins Observatory at Williams. There was but one room, 15 feet by 2.'> 
feet and about 25 feet high. A Simms transit of .3-inch aperture and 
4i-inch focus was mounted upon a masonry pier in this room, and a 
Simuis altitude and azimuth instrument upon a i)ier i)r()jec[ing through 
the roof and covered by a small house moving on rails The observa- 
tory possessed also a 2^-incli (52-inch focus) Dollaud refractor, an astro- 
nomical clock by Molyneaux, reflecting circle, sextant, and quadrant. 
The instruments were removed from the observatory owing to a leaky 
roof, soon after Dr. Caldwell's death, in 1835, and in 1838 the building 
was partly destroyed by fire, and astronomical activity was never re- 
newed. All records of observations have been lost. 

Oaldand. — The private observatory of Mr. F. G. Blinn, in East Oak- 
laud, contains a 5-iuch Clark equatorial and If -inch Latimer-Clark tran- 
sit, with mean-time and sidereal clocks. 

Oaldand. — The observatory of Mr. Burckhalter, at West Oakland, 
California, contains a lOi-inch reflector by Brasliear, and 1|| inch transit. 
The mechanical work of the building and equatorial mounting ^vas done 
by the owner. 

G^Gyalla. — Observations of sun spots, spectroscopic and ])hotometric 
observations of planets, new stars, comets, and stars with variable 
spectra. The observations for a "spectroscopic Durchmusterung" 
from 0° to -15° declination have been finished and the catalogue 
printed. Dr. von Kovesligethy, Dr. vou Konkoly's assistant, accepted 
a position in the meteorological office in Budapest, April 1, 1887. Con- 
siderable spectroscopic and photographic apparatus has been added 
to the equipment. 

Omaha, Nebrasha. — A new observatory at Creighton College was 
completed in 1887. The instruments are a 5-inch Steward equatorial, 
3inch Eauth transit, clocks, chronograph, etc. Director, J. lligge, S. 
J. Latitude, +41° IG' G"; longitude, 6^^ 23"^ 47^ west of Greenwich. 

Orwell Park. — An extensive and valuable series of observations of 
recent comets has been published. 

Oxford University. — Great attention has been jiaid to photography, 
and particularly to its application to the determination of stellar par- 
allax {q. v.), with very gratifying results. The large equatorial is to be 
remodelled as a i)hotographic telescope of 13 inches aperture in con- 
formity with the plans adopted by the Paris congress, the necessary 
funds having been provided by Dr. De La Rue.

Palermo. — Observations of comets, planets, san spots, and meteors. 

raris. — Tiie approaching- completion of the observations for the La- 
laude catalogue has moditied the plan of oj)erations carried on with the 
meridian instruments for some years past. The large transit circle 
has been used for observations of the sun, moon, minor planets, and 
such stars of Lalande's list still reipiiriug re-observation; the Gambey 
transit, for observations of the absolute right ascensions of fundamental 
stars; the Gambey circle and the "cercle du jardin,'- for a re investiga- 
tion of the latitude, and the latter also for fundamental declinations. 
Comets, asteroids, nebulae, and occultations of stars by the moon have 
been observed with the equatorials. The most important addition to 
the instrumental equipment is the apparatus adapted to the equatorial 
conde for determining the constants of refraction and aberration by 
Loewy's method. Work in astronomical photography is continued by 
the Henrys. A fine engraving of the Pleiades, compiled from three of 
their photographs, accompanies Admiral Mouchez's report for 1887. 
The time service, which of late has not been entirely satisfactory, is 
undergoing renovation. 

Purify {Eeole miUtairc). — M. Bigourdan gives in the Bulletin Astro- 
nomiqne (4 : 497 ; 5 : 30) an interesting historical account of the ob- 
servatories of the ficole militaire, famous for the labors of Lalande and 
d'Agelet. 

Pekin. — An interesting historical account of this observatory (estab- 
lished in 1279) is given in abstrac^t, in Xature for Xovend>er 8, 1888, 

Phelps {New Yorlc). — The Red House Observatory was abandoned in 
1888, Mr. Brooks having become director of the Smith Observatory at 
Geneva. 

Poona. — An observatory has been established at the College of Science 
with a l(»i inch silver-on-giass Xewtonian reflector by (4rubb, (5-inch re- 
fractor by Cooke, with photographic, photometric, and spectroscopic 
accessories. It is intended at present to restrict the work of the obser- 
vatory to certain branches of spectroscopic research, with occasional 
observations of comets, etc. The curator is Mr. K. 1). Nacgamvala. 

Potsdam. — Dr. Yogel has applied photography to the determination 
of the motions of stars in the line of sight, and has obtained most satis- 
factory results. He proposes to observe regularly all stars (about sixty) 
that are as bright as 2.5 magnitude. The observations of solar phenom- 
ena, sketches, and photometric observations of comets and planets have 
been continued with little interruption. Progress is rei)orted upon the 
"photometric Durchmusterung," which is to take in all stars in the 
northern hemisphere down to the 7.5 magnitude. The instruments re- 
quired to enable the observatory to take part in the photographic work 
planned by the Paris congress have been ordei'cd, and numerous pre- 
liminary experiments have been canied out for the permanent commit- 
tee of that body. 

Prague. — Professor Safarik has continued his observations of variable

stars. In 1887 lie changed liis resuleiice, and made considerable im- 
provements ill liis observatoiy. Tlie iiistruintuits are a (5 inch refractor, 
which is to be replaced by one more powerful, and a small transit and 
clock. The provisional co-ordinates of the meridian room are : latitude, 
+o()o 4' 21"; longitude, 0'' 57'" 48>^ east of Greenwich. 

Piiehla {Mavieo). — Observatory of the College of the Sacred Heart. 
Director, P. Capelleli, S. J. 

PuUcowa. — The great routine work of the observatory, the determina- 
tions of star positions with the transit, meridian circle, and vertical cir- 
cle has proceeded on the same lines as before. Romberg is credited 
with having made no less than 9,000 observations with the meridian 
circle in a single year. The 30 inch refractor has been used on close 
double stars and satellites, the 15-incli on similar work, and also for 
experiments in stellar photography. The astro-physical laboratory is 
n^ported in working order. Volume 12, a catalogue of the principal stars 
to the fourth magnitude, as far as —15^ declination, has been published, 
aiul several other volumes, though interrupted by the death of Wagner, 
are well advanced. The first number of a new series of publications — 
" Supplements to the Pulkowa Observations" — is an interesting memoir 
l)y Dr. Hermann Struve on the outer satellites of Saturn. 

RadcUffe. — The transit circle has been used for observing the sun, 
moon, and a list of stars down to the seventh magnitude between the 
equator and — 25°; the Barclay equatorial for the measurement of double 
stars and observations of comets. The volume for 1885 has been pub- 
lished, and all reductions are remarkably well advanced. 

RouHclon. — Systematic observation of some twenty long-period varia- 
bles has been taken up; time signals are furnished for the neighboring 
district. 

Scholl Ohservafory. — At Lancaster City, Pennsylvania, a new observ- 
atory, named the Daniel Scholl Observ^atory, has been erected on the 
grounds of Franklin and Marshall College. The equipment as described 
by Mr. J. E. Kershner in Science for May 13, 18S7, consists of an 11- inch 
Clark-Eepsold equatorial, a 3-inch transit, a Seth Thomas clock, a chro- 
nometer, chronograph, and meteorological apparatus. The equatorial 
has a set of jiositive and negative eye pieces, with reversion prisms for 
three of the micrometer eye-pieces, a Mertz solar eye-piece, and a comet 
eyepiece, together with a micrometer and complete illuminating appa- 
ratus for bright and dark field, as worked out by the Repsolds. 

Smith College {ISForthampton). — An exchang.^ of longitude signals with 
the Harvard Observatory was made in the summer of 1888. 

Stockholm. — Dr. Gryld6u has devoted himself to inv^estigations in ce- 
lestial mechanics. 

Stonyhurst College. — The solar observations consist of (1) a drawing 
of the sun's disk, 10^ inches in diameter, including the careful delinea- 
tion of all spots and facuhe visible; (2) a spectroscopic measurement 
with a radial slit of the height of the chromosphere and of all the gas-

eous prominences; (3) a study of tlie general surlace of the sun when- 
ever the definition has been unusually good; (4) a ^sketch of the chro- 
mospheric flames, with a wide tangential slit; (5) the spectrum of the 
solar spots between the lines B and D. Observations of lunar occulta- 
tions, of comets, and of the phenomena of Jupiter's satellites have been 
made as before. The sky-glows have also been watched with care. A 
r)^-inch Clark equatorial, formerly the property of Rev. T. W. Webl), 
was purchased for the observation of tlie total solar eclipse of August 
29, 1886. 

Strasshurg. — Dr. E. Becker was appointed director December 1, 1887, 
relieving Dr. Kobold, the " observator," temporarily in charge. Ob- 
servations of nebuliie, comets, and satellites have been niade with the 
refractor; observations of the sun, moon, and planets and of zero stars 
for the southern zones with the meridian circle, and measures of the 
sun's diameter and sunsi)ots with the heliometer. The transit instru- 
ment has been used by Dr. Wislicenus for investigations with a }>er- 
sonal equation apparatus of his own design. All reductions are well 
advanced. The library has been thoroughly overhauled and recata- 
logued. 

Syracuse (Keiv Yorl:). — The new observatory of the TJniversity of 
Syracuse, a memorial to Charles Demarest Holden, of the class of 1877, 
was dedicated November 18, 18S7, with an appropriate address by Pro- 
fessor Newcomb. The iiistruments are an 8 inch Clark e<piatorial,;Mnch 
Troughton and Simms transit, clock chronograph, and chronometer. 
Director, Prof. J. R. French. 

/Syracuse {Neir Yorl\). — Private observatory of H. P. Stark; o^^-incli 
Spencer eipiatorial refractor; 12-foot dome. 

Tacubaya. — The National Mexican observatory, which is in the de- 
partment of the secretary of public works, was founded May a, 1S78. 
The instruments were at first mounted at Cliapultepec, but in 1SS3 they 
wi're transferred to the present building, erected at a cost of $200,000. 
The instruments are as follows: A refractor of 0"'.'>81 (IT) inches) aper- 
ture and 5"'.40 (17 feet 8 inches) focal length, by (Jriibb, provided with 
a fine micrometer and an ll-prism spectroscope; a meridian circle of 
0"'.203 (8 inches) aperture and 2'".743 (9 feet) focal length, by Trough- 
ton & Simms, with circles 0'".914 (3G inches) in diameter, divided to 5' 
and read by four niicroscoi)es, and with collimators of 0"'.ir)2 ((> inches) 
aperture and 2"'. 15 (7 feet) focus; a Dallmeyer pliotoheliograph of 
0"'.102 (4 inches) aperture and 1'".53 (5 feet) focus, with parallactic 
mounting and an enlarging apparatus; an alt-azimuth, also by Tr!)ugh- 
ton vS: Simms, of 0"'.083 (3.^ inches) ai)erture and 0"'.85 (2 feet 9 inches) 
focal length, with circles 0"'.60 (2 feet) in diameter, divided to -V. In 
addition to these there are, not yet mounted, a Grubb equatorial of 
0'".ir>2 (0 inches) aperture ami 2"'.r)4 focal length, an Ertel meridian in- 
strument of 0"'.152 aperture and 2'". 20 focal leng'th, and a Troughton 
& Simms zenith telescope, 0"'.070 ai)erture and l"'.la focal length. Of

Maury; a sidereal clock, by F. Vazquez, Mexico; sidereal and meau-time 
clocks, by Barraud & Lund; two sidereal chronometers, by Negretti & 
Zambra; seven mean time chronometers, by various makers, and mag- 
netic and meteorological instruments. A photographic refractor of 
0'".33 (13 inches) aperture and 3"'.43 (11 feet) focal length has been or- 
dered from Grubb, to enable the observatory to co-operate in the inter- 
national plan of charting the sky by photograjjhy. The personnel con- 
sists of Sr. Ingeneiro Angel Anguiano, director; Sr. Ingeneiro Felipe 
Valle, Sr. Lieut. Col. Teodoro Quintana, Sr. Ingeneiro Francisco Eodri- 
guez Rey, Sr. Ai)olonia Romo, Sr. M. Moreno; two more astronomers 
■will be added during 1S89, The work of the meridian circle has been 
upon comparison stars, comets, and asteroids; the 15-inch equatorial 
has been used upon comets, and asteroids, and these bodies, as well as 
a list of southern nebuhii, will be carefully observed in future. The 
photoheliograph has been used almost daily, and with the alt-azimuth 
observations for time and latitude have been made, and observations of 
lunar culminations and of comets. Considerable time has been devoted 
to co-operating with longitude parties. The ])osition of the observatory 
is: Latitude, +19° 24' 17".5; longitude, C' 3'"' 46^53 west of Green- 
wich (determined telegrai)hically from St. Louis); altitude 2,322'" (7,G18 
feet). An "anuario" is published regularly. 

Tacuhaya. — Private observatory of M. G. Prieto: Bardou equatorial, 
C^.ll (4J inches) a])erture, 1"'.60 (5 feet 3 inches) focal length; spectro- 
scope, and clock. 

Taschlent. — The refractor has been used for observations of sun-spots, 
comets, and occultations by the moon ; the meridian circle, principally 
for determining the positions of comet comi)arison stars. The observa- 
tory has co-oi)erated in determining the geographical positions of a num- 
ber of places in central Asia. Several chronometers have been tested, 
and the noon signal has been given by the discharge of a cannon, as in 
previous years. The director, M. Pomerantzeff, is assisted by MM. 
Zalessky and Schwarz. A new determination of the latitude in 1887 
gave: y>= + 41o 19' 31".35±0".O5. 

Temple observatory {Rugby). — Spectroscojtic observations of the motion 
of stars in the line of sight, and measures of double stars. 

ToJcio. — An observatory was founded in 1888 at Tokio, Japan, by 
combining the astronomical department of the old Marine observatory, 
the observatory of the Ministry of the Interior, and that of the Impe- 
rial University. The new observatory occupies the buildings of the 
Marine observatory, its position as i)rovisionally determined being lati- 
tude, + 350 39' 17".5; longitude, 9'' 18'" 58«.0 east of Greenwich, The 
princii)al instruments are a .Jr^-inch llepsold transit, a 5 inch Merz and 
Kepsold meridian circle, and equatorials of G^ and 8 inches aperture. 
The director is H. Terao. 



ASTRONOMY. 1 85 

Turin. — Observations of comets, iiKteoiolojiiiinl observations, an<l a 
(letenninatioii of tlje latittule of a station at Termoli have been pub- 
lished. 

United St atts Naval Observatory. — Tlie work of 1887-'SS was similar 
to that of previous years. With the 26-inch equatorial observations 
were made of double stars, satellites, and of Saturn and Mars, and 
observations for stellar parallax; with the 9.()-inch, observations of 
comets and asteroids. The observations with the transit-circle for a 
catalogue of miscellaneous stars were completed in 1888, and prepara- 
tions have been made for observing- with this instrument the zone — I-i^ 
to —18°. The time-service has been considerably extended. The con- 
tract for the erection of the nine buildings comprising the new obser- 
Aatory was awarded in 18^8, and some progress has been made with 
the necessary excavations. 

JJpsala. — Dr. Ilermann Sehultz describes at some length in the Yier- 
telj all rssch rift (23:144) the recent additions to his instrumental outfit: 
a transit and a vertical circle, both by Eei)sold, with objectives of 9 >"'■" 
(4 inches) aperture; a transit, by Steiuheil, of 54""" (2 inches) aper- 
ture, mounted in the prime vertical; a 4-incli refractor, parallactic 
mounting, by Simms ; clock Hohwii 34, three chronometers, two chrono- 
graphs, and minor apparatus. The principal instrument of the obser- 
vatory is a 9-iuch refractor. 

Vassar College. — Miss Mary W. Whitney has been appointed to fill 
the vacancy caused by the resignation of Miss Maria Mitchell. 

Vienna {^VienOttalcring). — The private observatory of U err von Kuff- 
ner, which was beguu in 1884, was completed iu 18S7. The buildiikg- is 
in the shape of a cross, 82 feet from east to west and GL feet from north 
to south. The instruments are: A meridian circle, by llepsold, of 4.8 
inches aperture and 5 feet focal length, with circle 21. (J inches in diam- 
ter, divided to 2' and read by four microscopes; and a refractor, also 
by Kepsold, of 10, G inches aperture and 12.i feet focal length, with 
filar, double image, and ring micrometers. The position of the obser- 
tory, as provisionally determined by Dr. Herz, is: Latitude, +48° 12' 
47".2; longitude, 1'' 5"' UM east of Greenwich.

tions made with the meridian circle by ]\Iiss Limb and IMr, T^pdegiaff 
from the latter part of 188G to Ai)ril 1, 1887, observations made with 
the 15.^ iuch equatorial, and a summary of meteorological observations 
made by various observers at IMadison from 1^5 J to 188G. Miss Lamb 
contributes a very useful index to stars in Airy's six Greenwich cata- 
logues not found in Flamsteed, and jMr. Updegrafif a dis(,'ussion of the 
latitude of the observatory. Professor Davies was succeeded by Prof. 
G. 0. Comstock as director, and Prof. Asaph Hall as consulting director. 
Mr. Updegraif and Miss Laml) (now jMrs. Updegraff) have removed to 
the Cordoba observatory. The assistants now at the observatory are

Mr. FT. V. Egbert, formerly of the Albany observatory, and Prof. S. J. 
Brown. The fre.e use of the Washburn observatory was tendered to 
the Navy Department during the contemplated removal of the naval 
observatory to its new site. 

WeM Point. — A new observatory was built in 1883, the old site having 
been rendered worthless as an astronomical station by a mil road tunnel 
cut immediately beneath it. The instruments are a 12-inch Olark equa- 
torial, monnt(Hl in 1884, and an 8-inch Kei»sold meridian circle, mounted 
in 1885. Geographical position: Latitude, 4-41° 23' 22". 1; longitude, 
4^ 55"' 50^6 west of Greenwich. Height above sea level, 480 feet. 

Williama CoUege.—On the 28th of June 1888, the fiftieth anniversary 
of the dedication of the Hopkins Observatory of Williams College Avas 
celebrated with suitable ceremony and a discourse upon '' The Develop- 
ment of Astronomy in the United States," by Prof T. H. ISaffbrd. The 
Hopkins Observatory seems entitled to the honor of being the first 
permanent American observatory, having -been i)rojected about 1831, 
chiefly built in 1837, and dedicated June 12, 1838. The University of 
North Carolina had built an observatory in 1831 and provided an ex- 
cellent instrumental equipment, but in 1838 the building was p.artially 
destroyed by fire, and little or no astronomical work was ever done with 
the instruments. Professor Saffbrd jjublished in 1 888 a catalogue of 
the ri;;ht ascensions of some 201 circumpolar .stars, the results of sev- 
eral years' labor with the K epsold meridian circle. 

Wilmingf()7i, Delanarc. — The private observator}' of Francis G. du 
Pont is at his residence about 4 miles to the north of Wilmington, 
Del! It was designed by the owner, and consists of two polygonal 
buildings, covered by domes of peculiar construction, and connected 
by a third building, which forms the transit room. The instruments 
are: A good 12-inch reflector by Brashear, well mounted, with driving- 
clock, etc.; a 4i-inch equatorial refractor, objective by Olark and 
mounting by Brashear; a small transit by Home & Thornethwaite, 
Loudon; sidereal and mean time clocks, and Morse register for record- 
ing transits. The whole building is lighted by the electric light, and 
the electric light is also used for instrumental illumination. The 12- 
inch reflector has been used for astronomical photography. The 
ai)proximate latitude is +39° IG'. 

Windsor, Ketc ISouth M^ales. — Mr. Tebbutt published in pamphlet 
form in 1887 an interesting history and description of his observatory. 
It is situated, with the owner's residence, at the eastern extremity of the 
town of Windsor, upon a hill 50 feet above mean tide. Occasional 
astronomical observations were made here with a sextant and l^vinch 
telescope from 1854 to 18G4. To these instruments were added a 3^- 
inch refractor by Jones in 18G1, and a Frodsham chronometer in 1864. 
At the close of 18G3 a small building, comprising transit and prime 
vertical rooms ami a dome, was erected on the west of the dwelling, 
and a small transit and the Scinch refractor already referred to were 



ASTRONOMY. 187 

mounted. This refractor gave place to o!ie of 4.V inches aperture in 
187-{, and in 1874 a further addition was made to the buiklings. 
In 1879 a substantial observatory of brick was erected a few yards 
southwest of the old building. It consists of an equatorial room 
(under which is an office) and meridian and prime vertical rooms, the 
meridian room containing a Cooke transit, mounted in 1870. In I88L5 
an 8-inch Grubb equatorial supplanted the 4^-inch. Mr. Tebbutt has 
published many valuable observations of comets, asteroids, double and 
vaiiable stars, occultations of stars by the moon, etc., during the more 
than twenty-tive years' existence of his observatory. 

Wolsingham. — Eev. T. E. Espiu has continued his sweeps for red stars 
and stars with remarkable spectra, and has announced the discovery of 
several new variables. A 4.8-inch Troughton «fc Simms ecjatorial has 
been added to the equipment, and a new edition of Birmingham's red 
star catalogue has been published. In the latter part of 1888 the ob- 
servatory was removed to* a new site at Towlaw, Darlington, 3 miles 
northeast of its old position and 1,000 feet above se.a-level. 

Yale. — The initial volume of "Transactions of the Astronomical Ob- 
servatory of Yale University," a valuable memoir by Dr. W. L. Elkin 
upon the relative positions of the principal stars in the Pleiades, as de- 
termined with the new heliometer, was published in 1887, the exi)ense 
of printing having been borne by Professor Loomis. Upon the comple- 
tion of this work Dr. Elkin took up the investigation of the parallaxes 
of the ten first-magnitude stars in the northern hemisphere, and the re- 
sults obtained we have already referred to under stellar parallax. The 
heliometer has also been used for measures of various double stars an<l 
of the diameters of the sun and Mars, and more recently in a triangu- 
latiou of twenty-four stars within 100' of the north pole, and in ob- 
servations of Iris for the determination of the solar parallax. Mr, Hall 
has nearly completed the reduction of his work upon Titan, the expense 
of which is defrayed by the Bache fund, and he has taken up the in- 
vestigation of the jiarallaxes G ]> Cygni aiul Lalande 18115, 22. Mr. 
O. T. Sherman, who had charge of the thermometric bureau, resigned in 
November, 1886, and his work has since been carried on by Mr. f*eck. 
The testing of time-pieces has been discontinued, but the timeservi(;e is 
still maintained. The subscription of 551,000 annually for the supi)ort of 
the work with the heliometer has been renewed for three years, begin- 
ning with 1887.

188 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS. 

The 36-inch Lick telescope. — The great equatorial was mounted in 1887. 
The visual objective bas a clear aperture of 36 inches and focal length 
of 50 feet 6 inches. The flint disk for this objective was obtained by 
Clark from Feil & Co., of Paris, in 1882, the crown in 1885, and the ob- 
jective was completed and delivered by Clark in 1886. These two disks 
are separated in their cell by a space of 6.5 inches. In 1887 a third 
(crown) lens of 33 inches aperture and 46 feet focus was procured as a 
"photographic corrector." The mounting was made by Warner & 
Swasey, of Cleveland, Ohio, and put in place in the autumn of 1887. 
The pier is a hollow cast-iron column of rectangular section, and for 
convenience in transit is built up of Ave sections, bolted together bj' 
internal flanges. At the top tlie column measures 4 feet by 8 feet, in- 
creasing to 5 feet by 9 feet at the floor line, and then spreading out rapidly 
to a base 10 feet by 16 feet bearing on a masonry foundation. At this 
point the weight is distributed over a series of large steel screws, which 
afford the means of adjusting the position of the i^olar axis. At the top 
of the column is the bead carrying the bearings for the polar axis, and 
around the head is a balcony reached by a spiral staircase. The inter- 
section of polar and declination axes is 37 feet above the base. Column 
and head weigh together 21 tons, and the total weigbt of the telescope 
is 40 tons. The tube consists of a central section of cast-iron, strongly 
ribbed, to which two sections of sheet- steel are attached. The diameter 
of the tube is 4 feet at the center, 38 inches at the object-glass end, and 
30 inches at the eye end, while the sheet-steel portions vary from one- 
eighth of an inch thick at the center to one-twelfth of an inch thick at 
the ends. When the telescope is in a horizontal position the flexure of 
the tube with the object glass and permanent counterbalance is one- 
eighth of an inch only, while with a load of 1 ton added at each end the 
flexure is increased to one-quarter of an inch. 

The polar axis is of steel, 10 feet long, 12 inches in diameter at its 
apper and 10 inches at its lower end, with a 6-inch hole through its 
entire length ; the bearings are of Babbitt metal, relieved by anti-friction 
rolls. The declination axis is also of steel, 10 feet 6 inches long, 10 
inches tapering to 9i inches diameter, with a 4-inch hole running 
through itj Babbitt-metal bearings, with anti friction rolls, upon hard 
steel balls are used, as in the polar axis. To facilitate counterpoising 
the telescope is arranged for carrying always its maximum load, so that 
when the photographic corrector, the spectroscope, or any physical ap- 
paratus is attached an equivalent weight is taken off at the same place. 
There are three regular tinders of 6, 4, and 3 inches aj)erture; in addi- 
tion to these the 12iuch equatorial can be quickly attached as a pointer 
for photographic work if necessary. The hour circle on the polar axis 
is 3 feet in diameter, and has coarse graduations to 5 minutes, and large 
figures on its outer edge, while on the northern face it is graduated to 
20 seconds. Attached to the head, at the upper end, is a fixed hour

circle graduated to 20 seconds and read through a series of prisma, at 
the eye end to 4 seconds. On the declination sleeve near the tube is a 
line declination circle 3 feet in diameter graduated to 5 minutes of arc, 
and read from the eye end to 12 seconds, while on the outer end of the 
axis is a coarse declination circle 6 feet in diameter graduated to degrees. 
The driving clock is regulated by a frictional governor of the cross- 
armed type and by an electric control from the standard clock. One 
of the shafts carries a chronograph drum. For photographic work an 
opening is cut in the side of the tube about 10 feet from the eye end, 
and a plate 20 inches square can here be inserted and suitably adjusted. 
The eye end is so arranged that the micrometer can be quickly re- 
moved and two steel bars inserted in bearings. These bearings are 
l)int of a jacket revolving 300° in position anglo, and to them can be 
attached spectroscopes, photometers, enlarging cameras, etc. Tlie eye 
end is also surrounded by a large ring, which supports tlie various 
handles for actuating the clamps and slow motions, and carries the read- 
ing microscopes and tinders as w^ell as a small sidereal chronometer. 
The clamps and slow motions are operated as follows: 

Au observer at the eye end can — 

(1) Clamp in declination. 

(2) Give slow motion in declination. 

(3) Head the declination circle (two verniers). 

(4) damp in right ascension. 

(5) Stop the clock. 

(G) Give slow motion in right ascension. 

(7) ReaiL right ascension circle (one microscope). 

An assistant on either* side of the balcony below the axes can— 

(8) Clamp in declination. 

(D) Give rapi<l motion in declination. 

(10) Give slow motion in declination. 

(11) Give quick motion in right ascension. 

(12) Give slow motion in right ascensiou. 

(13) Clamp in right ascension. 

(14) Sto}) or start the driving clock. 

(15) Read the right ascension circle (two microscopes). 

(10) Read a dial showing the nearest qirarter degree of declina- 
tion. 

Detailed drawings of the mounting are given in Engineering, volume 
46, London, 1888. 

The ahnucdntar. — In volume 17 of the Annals of Harvard College 
Observatory, Mr. S. C. Chandler, jr., has given a complete description 
and investigation of his "almucantar," and a discussion of a series of 
observations made with it in 1884 and 1885. The almucantar, as its 
name implies, is an equal altitude instrument, and was devised by Mr« 
Chandler in 1870. It consists, essentially, of a telescope attached to a 



ASTKONOMY. 191 

frame M'ork which i.s floated on a small quantity of mercury coutaiiuMl 
iu a shallow trough. The trough is supported on au upright pillar, 
and can be turued about a vertical axis, and set with the telescope it 
carries to any azimuth. If the telescope is chunped at a given altitu<le, 
the sight line will mark accurately in the heavens a i)arallel of altitude, 
or "almucantar," and the observation of the time of transits of sLais as 
they rise or fall over this circle in different azimuths will furnish the 
means of determining instrumental aud clock corrections, the latitude, 
or right ascensions aud declinations. The particiUar parallel of alti- 
tude which has been found most convenient, as it materially siinplilies 
the formulic of reduction, is the parallel passing through the pole, to 
■which the luime '' co-latitude circle" is given. IMi-. Chandler gives the 
mathematical theory of the new instrument, and illustrates the various 
formuhe for reducing observations by numerous examples. He then 
proceeds to examine critically the results of his observations (which 
are given in detail in the last chapter), aud to describe a number of ex- 
j)eriments on the stability of the instrumeut. He also suggests several 
modifications of construction, which he hopes in time to incorporate iu 
a more complete form of the apparatus. 

The almucantar as a field instrument seems to possess many advan- 
tages over tlie transit and zenith telescope for the determination of 
time and of terrestrial latitudes and longitudes, and Mr. Chandler 
states that it can be constructed at a much less cost than these in- 
struments; but for the determination of accurate positions of the fixed 
stars — a class of work for which meridian instruments hav^e hitherto 
been exclusively employed — it oft'ers a new and independent metiiod, 
free from many of the systematic errors inherent in the older system. 
The remarkable results that Mr. Chandler has already obtained with 
his instrument of only about 4 inches aperture certainly justify great 
confidence in the "almucantar system." 

Horizontal telescope. — Professor Pickering has had made for the Har- 
vard Observatory a horizontal telescope of 12 inchcis a[)erture aud 17 
feet focal length, possessing some of the conveniences of the equatorial 
coude. The tube is placetd east and west, the object-glass at the west- 
ern end. Before the object-glass is a plane mirror 18 inches in diame- 
ter, so mounted that the light of a celestial object not more than one 
hour on either side of the meridian can be thrown by its means into 
the field of the telescope. A stnall building covering the eyei>iece at 
the eastern end protects the observer, and may be heated in winter so 
that he can work in comfort. The instrument may be used for almost 
any class of observations, but is intended primarily as a photometer, 
and with this end in view an auxiliaiy telescope of 5 inches aperture 
is employed to bring into the field an image of the Pole-star, which is 
reduced by polarizing apparatus to equality' with the image of a star 
observed iu the principal telescope. The angular apertures of the two 
telescopes are such that the emergent pencils are coincident. 



192 KECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

A device adopted at Greenwich in the observations of occultations 
during^ the eclii)se of the moon on January 28, 1888, seems worthy of 
record. The eyepiece of the telescope was mounted eccentrically from 
the axis at the distance of the moon's radius, so that, without disturb- 
ing the ])Osition of the telescope, any point of the limb could be 
brought into the center of the field. For setting the position-circles 
rapidly in the dark, card-board circles, with notches cut at important 
points whi(;h could be felt with the fingers, were used; and in another 
case luminous paint was found to work admirably for indicating the 
figures. 

In the report of the Melbourne Observatory Mr. Ellery describes a 
form of micrometer used successfully on the great reflector for making 
sketches of nebuhe. It consists of a number of silver threads crossing 
at right angles, and rendered visible at will by means of an electric 
current. 

M. Perigaud has found that the essential condition in the artificial 
horizon oevised by Gautier for the meridian work of the l^aris Observa- 
tory is that the mercury should form an extremely thin covering upon 
the bottom of the containing vessel. For the inn( r basin used in Gau- 
tier's apparatus he has substituted a ])late of such diameter as to leave 
a space of 5 millimeters between its edge and the side of the outer ves- 
sel, and the plate being carefully levelled, it is possible to flow over it a 
mere film of mercury, which will give sharp images under most adverse 
circumstances. • " 

It may not be out of place here to call attention to the suggestion 
made by Brashear and others in regard to standard dimensions in as- 
tronomical and physical instruments. The great convenience which 
would result from having the fittings of telescopes, eye pieces, draw 
tubes, etc., interchangeable can hardly be over-estimated, 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

The Lalande prize of the Paris Academy in 1S87 was awarded to Dr. 
Duuer, of the Lund Observatory, Sweden, for his double star work ami 
his researches on stellar spectra; the Valz prize to Perigaud for his 
valuable investigations of the meridian instruments of the Paris Ob- 
servatory and other important astronomical work. The Janssen prize 
for progress in astronotnical physics, awarded this year for the first 
time, was decreed to the late Dr. Kirchhofl"; the Arago medal, also 
awarded for the first time, to Bischoffsheim the founder of the Nice 
Observatory; and the La Caze physical prize to Paul and Prosper 
Henry for their work in astronomical photogmphy. The Rumford 
medal of the Royal Society was presented to Professor Tacchini, for 
his investigations on the physics of the sun, November 30, 1888. 

In 1888 the Lalande prize was awarded to Bossert for his extensive 
and valuable astronomical computations; the Valz prize, to Prof. E. C. 
Pickering for photometric work : the Janssen prize, to Dr. Huggins for 



ASTRONOMY. 193 

his researches in spectrum analysis. The Damoiseau prize was not 
awarded. 

The gold medal of the Koyal Astronomical Society was awarded on 
February 10, 1888, to Dr. Auwers, for his re-reduction of Bradley's ob- 
servations. The Draper medal of the National Academy of Sciences 
was awarded in April to Professor Pickering, and the Lawrence Smith 
medal, to Professor Newton for his original work on the subject of me- 
teorites. 

Prizes amounting in value to about $1,000 were distributed at the 
December, 1887, meeting of the French Astronomical Society for the 
best schemes submitted for retbrmiug the calendar. The chief prize 
was secured by M. Gaston Armelin, of Paris. 

Telegraphic transmisnion of astronomical data. — Early in ]888 a new 
code book, "The Science Observer Code," for the convenient and accu- 
rate transmission of astronomical data by telegraph, was published by 
Messrs. Chandler and Eitchie as "Occasional Publicatious No. 1" of the 
Boston Scientific Society. The new code book supersedes the dictionary 
fornierly in use, and as the words are conveniently numbered it is used 
with great facility. The number code of 200 quarto pages is followed by 
a phrase code with numerous examples, covering 17 pages, and by tables 
for reducing decimals of a day to hours, minutes, and seconds, and vice 
versa. 

The number words have been selected from the dictionaries of sev- 
eral languages, it being the intention that the literal arrangement of 
any word should differ from that of every other by at least two letters; 
all words of more than ten letters are excluded. The words are ar- 
ranged in 400 sections, numbered from to 399, each section compris- 
ing 100 words, numbered from to 99; any integral number up to 
39,999 can therefore be represented by a single letter. The phrase 
code is arranged for the transmission of information in regard to 
comets, planets, variable stars, the state of the weather, and for ref- 
erence, also, to stars in the Durchmusterung and GonhVs zone cata- 
logue. Checks are ]»rovided for (H)rrotting errors which have been 
introduced in the transmission. Alter the lapse of suftic.ent time for 
all astronomers so desiring to provide themsiUves with a copy of the 
code, it finally went into etfect on October 1, 1888. The observatory of 
Harvard College is the central station for the distribution of astro- 
nomical information in this country, and Dr. Krueger, at Kiel, serves in 
a like cai)acity for Europe. 

A paper in No. 2791 of the Astronomis(;he Nachrichten, on the meteor- 
ological coiulitions favorable for establishing a large telescope, should 
command the attention of any one upon whom may rest the responsi- 
bility of locating a new observatory. It is manifestly imi)ortant that a 
careful examination of the meteorological conditions of any proposed 
^ite for a large telescope should be made, particularly with reference to 
11. Mis. 142 13

the quality of the images of the stars. This can be done with a sciii- 
tilloscope or more accurately with the scintillometer, for it is this scin- 
tilliitiou or superpositiou of au infinite number of movable images that 
causes the nnsatisfactory seeing so often encountered. Herr Exner, in 
studying the scintillation at Vienna, has not found a single night on 
which this disagreeable phenomenon was not present. 

"The Observatory" on completing its tenth volume with the number 
for December, 1887, passed from the hands of Messrs. Maunder, Down- 
ing and Lewis to Messrs. Turner and Common. The editors' address 
remains Hyde House, Westcombe Park, Blackheath, S. E., England. 

The tw^efth meeting of the International Astronomische Gesellschaft 
was held at Kiel from the 29th to the 31st of August, 1887, under the 
presidency of Dr. Auwers. The next meeting will be at Brussels iu 
1889. 

A new society for encouraging the study of nature, the " Gesellschaft 
Urania," has been established at Berlin under the i)residency of Pro- 
fessor Forster, of the Berlin observatory. Popular lectures are given 
on scientitic subjects, and a very well- written popular journal, "Him- 
mel und Erde," is published, especial attention being paid to astron- 
omy. 

Another new society, the "Societ6 Astronomique de France," founded 
January 28, 1887, at Paris, by M. Flammarion, has met with remark- 
able success. Reports are published in the "Observatory," and in 
" L'Astronomie," and the proceedings appear in an annual bulletin. 

Among recent works of general interest to astronomers are Professor 
Langley's "ISTew Astronomy," Young's "Text- book on Astronomy," 
Proctor's " Old and New Astronomy," which is being published in 
parts, and volume I, part 1, of Houzeau and Lancaster's admirable 
" Bibliographie g6n6rale de I'astrouomie." 

ASTRONOMICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR 1888. 

The following list contains the titles of the most important books and 
journal articles published during the year 18SS, with a few papers of 
earlier date, that have come under the writer's notiio. A number of 
titles have also been taken from reviews or catalogues v '.ere the pub- 
lications themselves have not been accessible. A more complete bibliog- 
raphy for the year 1887 has already been published in the- Smithsonian 
Miscellaneous Collections, No. 664, and it has not seemed advisable to 
extend the present list by including references to observations of comets 
and asteroids, or the titles of journals or other annual publications. 
The prices quoted are generally from Friedliinder's Natur-.p Novitates,

GEOLOGY FOR 1887 AND 1888. 



Bj' W J McGee, Geologist, U. S. Geological Survey. 



INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 

At its birth each branch of science is fostered and promoted by individ- 
ual eifort, and its early history is an account of iudi vidnals ; in the youth 
of a vigorous brauch of science it is cultivated and developed not only 
by individual eftbrt, but by groups of men and definitely organized sci- 
entific and educational institutions, and its history is an account of 
individuals, of institutions, and of its own first fruits ; when a branch of 
science approaches maturity it is further promoted and applied, and 
its influence generally diffused, chiefly by groups of individuals organ- 
ized as institutions of learning and research, and its history is an ac- 
count of institutions rather than individuals and of its results in the 
promotion of human welfare; and there is a final stage in the history 
of the development of a brauch of science in which the previously 
technical knowledge becomes generally diffused among and applied by 
certain classes or all classes of men, in which it gradually passes from 
the domain of pure science into that of the arts, and in which its his- 
tory is an account of the people and of the material progress of a coun- 
try or of the civilized world. Such has been the course of development 
in different branches of science; and such is the course pursued through 
one or more stages in those branches of science not yet completely de- 
veloped. 

Geology is one of the younger and at the same time one of the more 
vigorous branches of the tree of knowledge; and so rapidly has it de- 
veloped, that within the memory of men yet living, it has passed from 
the infantile stage represented by individual effort to the adolescent 
stage represented by combination of effort amo;ig definitely organized 
institutions. Its problems are of such magnitude and such profound 
importance to the people at large that the states, as well as the learned 
institutions of the civilized world, have .joined in the effort to solve them 
and render their results available. Geologic surveys are carried on in 
the states of this and some other countries ; the general governments 
in this and other countries maintain bureaus of geologic information; 
many scientific societies have geologic sections and departments, and 
some such institutions are entirely devoted to the promotion of geol-

218 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888, 

o^'.v ; and many of the educational institutions have dei)artments in 
which the science of geology is taught not only from text- books, but 
through original investigation, whereby the science is extended and its 
field enlarged. So, while the results of individual effort are of inesti- 
mable value to the growing science of geology, and while any account 
of the science must deal primarily with the contributions of individuals, 
it would seem desirable to preface even a short chapter in the history 
of progress by some notice of the institutions to whi(;h, in conjunction 
with the individual workers, that progress is due ; and accordingly the 
following descriptive list of the principal American institutions now 
promoting geologic science is prefixed to the account of actual progress 
during recent years, and particularly the biennial period 1887, 1888. 
The sources of information concerning these institutions are diverse, 
widely scattered, and not easily accessible, and accordingly the list may 
not be exhaustive. 

All necessity for incorporating in this record lists of the individuals 
by which geology has beeii promoted during the biennial period and of 
the publications containing the contributions is obviated by a contempo-

of American geology for the same jjeriod, which will shortly be i)ub- 
lished by the U. S. Geological Survey. 

INSTITUTIONS PEOMOTING GEOLOGY. 
GEOLOGIC SURVEYS. 

The Federal Government. — The U. S. Geological Survey was organized, 
several years ago to prepare a geologic map of the United States, and 
by implication to prosecute such investigations as are essential to the 
accomplishment of that task. It is indicative of the recognized impor- 
tance of geology that during recent years geographic exploration and 
study have, in this country at least, been carried on largely as a means 
to geologic investigation. The western States and Territories were in 
great part explored by geographers and engineers for geologic pur- 
poses; in many of the States it was found necessary to make geographic 
and to[)ographic surveys before the geologic investigations could be 
completed and their results made available to citizens; and the dearth 
of maps of the country at large is such, that a large part of the energies 
of the national geologic institution are expended in preliminary geo- 
graphic surveys. So the scientific corps of the U. S. Geological Survey, 
whi(;h includes about forty geologists and assistants, about fifteen pal- 
eontologists and assistants, and seven chemists and physicists with 
their assistants, comprises also about eighty geographers and topog- 
raphers with their assistants ; and there is in addition an executive and 
oifice force of about seventy-five persons. Hon. J. W. Powell is the 
Director. During the biennial period just closed the institution has 
published two royal octavo annual reports, three quarto monographs 



GEOLOGY. 219 

(two accompaiiied by folio atlases), tiftceu or sixteen octavo bulletins 
(or monographs upon minor subjects), aiul two octavo volumes relating 
to the mineral resources of the country. 

The U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey was organized many years 
since, for the purpose of accurately surveying the coast line and har- 
bors of the country' and ascertaining and recording their changes, and 
for tlie purpose also of connecting the coasts by transcontinental s^^s- 
tems of triangulation, and so determining the elements of the geoid re- 
lating to our domain. The surveys and maps of this institution are 
immediately available as a basis for geologic investigations over the 
areas which they cover ; and, moreover, the topographic and hydro- 
graphic configuration of the coasts and harbors represents a condition 
in the geologic evolution of the American coutineat, and so the inves- 
tigations of the institution are in another way available to the geolo- 
gist. Important contributions to geology annually result from the work 
of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. 

The U. S. Signal OflBce is maintained for meteorologic observation 
and prognostication, and observations are regularly made and recorded 
over nearly all parts of the conntr3'. Now, climate (including the fall 
of rain and the action of resulting rivers upon the surface of the earth) 
is the most potent agency in geology ; and so the results of the Signal 
Office are immediately available to the geologist, and some of the 
notable contributions made to geological science during the biennial 
period just closed have resulted indirectly from the operations of this 
bureau. 

The Corps of Engineers of the U, S. Army is engaged in different lines 
of investigation, some of which bear upon the action of rivers, the rel- 
ative position of land and sea, and other geologic agencies and con- 
ditions; and this Federal institution must accordingly be enumerated 
among those whose operations annually result in geologic progress. 

Canada. — Second oidy to the U. S. Geological Survey in the magni- 
tude and geographic extent of its operations is the Geological Survey 
of Canada, which, under the directorship of Dr. A. R. C. Selwyn, has 
been energetically prosecuted in various parts of the British dominion 
on the American continent during the past two years. The Canadian 
survey to day occupies very much the position occupied by the several 
geologic and geographic surveys of the Federal Government during the 
last generation, when an important function of the geologist was geo- 
graphic exploration : to-day the Canadian geologist is (except when 
employed in the relatively small portion of the Dominion now thickly 
populated) pre-eminently an explorer; his journeys carry him over un- 
known or little known tracts in the broad Saskatchewan plains, the 
extended Hudson Bay region, and the inhospitable foot-hills and river 
valleys of the northern Rocky Mountains; before he can satisfactorily 
represent the results of his studies or even c()m])lete his field-work it is 
necessary for him to map the tracts surveyed ; and eveu in the more

populous portions of tlie Dominiou maps have to be compiled or con- 
structed from ori<;inal surveys in order that the results of the work may 
be properly set forth. In Canada as in America the needs of the geol- 
ogist stimulates geographic research; and in Canada as in America, 
too, geography is practically reduced to a subordinate ]>art of the broad 
science of geology, and the derived signification of the terms is the true 
one. The corps of the geological survey of Canada includes, in addi- 
tion to the director, ten geologists and about the same number of assist- 
ants (who are employed chiefly in topographic work) ; two ))aleoutolo- 
gists and a paleontologic artist; three chemists and lithologists ; a 
topographer with two assistants; a librarian; and an accounting and 
office force. The principal publications of the survey appear in the 
form of annual reports, sometimes accompanied by portfolios or atlases 
of maps. During the biennial period just closed two annual reports 
have appeared. 

Alabama. — Geologic surveys have been maintained for some years in 
this State ; and Dr. Eugene A. Smith, the State geologist, has, with one 
or more assistants, been employed during the period 1887-88 in both 
scientific and economic investigations in geology. One octavo report 
of 571 pages has been published during the period, and a more volu- 
minous publication is in press. 

Arkamas. — Early in 1887 a geologic survey was instituted in this 
State, with Prof. John C Brauner as State geologist; provision being 
made for two or more assistants. The work of the survey has been 
pushed forward rapidly, with the co-operation of the U. S. Geological 
Survey in certain lines of study ; and preliminary reports and one vol- 
ume of the more elaborate annual report have been published. The lat- 
ter is of special interest, since it settles definitely certain questions con- 
cerning a region reported to be rich in precious metals which bad long 
agitated the citizens of the State, and indeed led to the establishment 
of the survey. 

California. — Although this State does not now maintain a geologic 
survey under that name, there are two State institutions engaged in 
work which is partly geologic. The first is the State mining bureau, 
now in charge of William Irelan, jr., State mineralogist, which issues 
annual reports (that for 1887 containing 315 and that for 1888 948 
pages octavo) ; and the second is the State engineering department, 
in charge of Wm. Ham. Hall, with a corps of assistants. The work of 
the department relates largely to irrigation and to the regimen and con- 
trol of rivers, and so directly and indirectly to geology. Two octavo 
reports have been issued during the biennial period. 

Colorado. — There is in this State a mining bureau, in charge of a nom- 
inal State geologist (the present incumbent is Fred. Bulkley), by which 
specific information is conveyed to citizens and others; but no reports 
have appeared during the years 1887 and 1888. 

Florida.— In 1887 Dr. J. Kost was commissioned State geologist, and 



GEOLOGY. 221 

proceeded at once upon a geologic survey of the State ; and a small 
report upon the progress of the work during the year was published. 
No provision was made, however, for continuing the work. 

Georgia. — A State geologist is commonly employed under the auspices 
of the department of agriculture. During tlie greater part of the bi- 
ennial period the incumbent was Augustus R. JNIcCutchen ; but after 
his death, early in 18.S8, the position remained vacant for several 
months, when it was filled by the appointment of Dr. J. W. Spencer, 
professor of geology in the State University at Athens. A law of 
1874 provides in addition for the appointment of a State geologist by 
the governor; and Dr. Spencer has received this appointment also. 
No publications have appeared during the biennial period. 

Illinois. — While no geologic surveys are in progress in this State, 
there is maintained at Springfield a State cabinet of geology and nat- 
ural history, which is virtually a geologic bureau, and the curator of 
whi(;h is virtually State geologist. This position was held by Prof. A. 
H. Worthen until his decease, and is now occupied by Joshua Lindahl. 
No oflacial publications have emanated from the bureau during the last 
two years. 

Indiana. — A State geologic survey is in progress here, under the 
direction of Maurice Thompson, State geologist, with two or three 
assistants; and reports are issued annually. 

KentucTcy—Vvot John R. Proctor has charge of the State geologic 
survey, and, with three or four assistants, has carried forward impor- 
tant researches in structural and economic geology during the biennial 
period ; and an octavo monograph and several minor papers have been 
published. 

Michigan.— 1\\ this State there is a geologic survey, the personnel of 
which has been changed during the biennial period by the death of 
State Geologist C. E. Wright early in 1888, and the subsequent ap- 
pointment of Prof. M. E. V\^adsworth, president of the State mining 
school at Houghton. The survey in this State now partakes of the 
character of a mining bureau, designed to convey specific information 
upon definite subjects to citizens of the State, and no important publi- 
cations have been made during the biennial period. 

Minnesota. — A geologic survey has been under way for some years, 
under the direction of State Geologist N. II. AVinchell, with a corps of 
assistants. Annual reports are published in octavo; and during the 
biennial period the second volume of the final report, in large quarto, 
has appeared. 

New York. — A State geologic survey is in progress here under the di- 
rection of the board of regents of the University of the State of New 
York, the veteran paleontologist Prof. James Ilall being State geolo- 
gist. Two volumes of the elaborate series of quarto paleontologic mo- 
nograi»hs, and two annual reports in octavo, have been issued by the 
survey during 1887-'88. 



222 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

North Carolina. — By tlio death of State Geologist W. 0. Kerr, in 1 884, 
a large amount of geologic material was left among the State archives 
in crude condition ; and in order that this material might be rendered 
available to the State, Prof. Joseph A. Holmes, of the State University, 
at Chapel Hill, was api)ointed to collate, digest, and publish it. This 
report, which represents the -work of the State survey during the bi- 
ennial period, is now in ])ress. 

Ohio. — The activity of the State geologic survey of Ohio decliued 
with the publication of the elaborate series of final reports b^^ Dr. J. S. 
Newberry during thepcriodl873-1878 j but the economic results to which 
the scientific investigations reported u[)on in these volumes were pre- 
liminary were subsequently elaborated ami expanded by Dr. Newberry's 
successor, Prof. Edward Orton, of the State University. During the 
biennial period there was renewed activity in economic investigation 
under the stimulus of the discovery of rock gas and petroleum in largo 
quantities within the State; and two editions of a preliminary report 
upon these substances, together with an elaborate final rei)ort upon the 
various mineral resources of the State, have been j)ublished since the 
beginning of 1887. 

Pennsylvania. — The most elaborate geologic survey ever conducted 
under the auspices of a single American State was recently made in 
Pennsylvania. As the local studies in various counties approached 
coini)letion the results were published in seventy or eighty octavo vol- 
umes; the activity of the survey then diminished somewhat, and the 
energies of the director. Dr. J. P. Lesley, and his chief assistant, C. A. 
Ashburner, were directed toward the digestion of the material thus . 
collected ami the preparation of final reports. Annual reports have 
however been regularly issued; and during the biennial period advance 
sheets of a dictionary of fossils, which although primarily paleontologic 
is designed for the use of geologists, have also been issued. 

Texas. — The second State geologic survey created within the bien- 
nial ])eriod is that of Texas, instituted and endowed liberally in 1888, 
with E. T. Dnmble as State geologist, and provision for two or more 
assistants. No jiublications have thus far appeared. 

Wyoming. — A Territorial geologist (Louis D. Ricketts) has been em- 
ployed in investigating the geologic structure and mineral resources of 
this Territory during the biennial period, and an annual report cover- 
ing the operations during 1887 has been published. 

EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. 

There are a number of universities and colleges in America which 
promote geologic science by providing (sometimes indirectly) for origi- 
nal investigations on the part of officers and pupils, and by publish- 
ing the results of these investigations. 

Colorado State School of Mines. — In this institution researches in 
geology, mineralogy, mining, etc., are prosecuted by the president. Dr. 



GEOLOGY. 223 

Regis Cliauvenet, and by Prof. Artliur Lakes and Prof. Magnus C. 
llilseiig. These officers are sometimes accompanied by advanced pupils, 
but rather for their instruction than for any assistance they may be able 
to give. The results of these field researches are generally published 
annually by the school in suitably illustrated octavo volumes. 

Columbia College. — No specific provision is made here for original re- 
searches in geology in connection with the regular course of instruc- 
tion ; but the professor of geology in the School of Mines forming a 
part of the institution, Dr. J. S. Newberry, devotes his vacations and 
leisure to geologic work in field and office; and in this work he some- 
times receives the assistance of, and his example is sometimes imitated 
by, advanced pupils. Part of the results of these researches appear 
in the School of Mines Qiuirterly, which is regularly i)ublished by the 
College Alumni Association. It should be understood that iu this as 
in some other cases (and indeed in some measure in all cases) the credit 
for the original work belongs rather to individuals thau to the insti- 
tutiou. 

Dakota School of Mines. — This institution is located at the same 
time in the only notable mining region in the State and in one of the 
most interesting geologic provinces on the face of the globe; and while, 
as in Colorado, the course of instruction relates rather to technology 
than pure scienc.?, field-work is carried on not only in connection with 
the teaching but during vacations, chiefly by the dean, Prof. Franklin 
11. Carpenter. A preliminary report upon this work was published in 
1SS8 in au illustrated octavo volume of 17 L pages. 

Dcnison University. — Original investigations in field and office are 
carried on iu this institution in connection with the regular course of 
instruction by C. L. Herrick, i)rofessor of geology and natural history, 
and some of his associates and pupils ; and the results of these re- 
searches are published in excellent style in the Bulletin and Transac- 
tions of the scientific laboratories of the University. 

State University of Iowa. — Special provision for original investigation 
is not made iu this institution ; but the energetic incumbent of the chair 
of geology and zoology. Prof. Samuel Calvin, carries forward, in connec- 
tion with his university duties and during vacations, original researches 
in geology and paleontology; and in 1888 the publication was com- 
menced of a " Bulletin from the Laboratories of Natural History, " in 
which the results of the work of Professor Calvin and some of his asso- 
ciates and pupils are printed. 

Johns HopMm University. — There is in this university a fellowship 
assigned to geology which is worth |500 per year; and during the fis- 
cal year there has been allotted in addition a small sum for the pay- 
ment of field expenses incurred by the fellow of geology. ^Moreover, 
field-work is recognized as an important aid in class instruction, and 
the professor of geology. Dr. George 11. ^Yilliams, introduces his pupils 
to practical work in the tiehl upon the crystalline rocks of eastern I\Tary- 



224 RECORD OF SCIENCP: for 1887 AND 1888. 

(and. The ontcoiuo of this work by Dr. Williams, that of some of his 
pupils, and that of the fellow iu geology. Dr. William B. Clark, is pub- 
lished in condensed form in the University circulars. Both Dr. Will- 
iams and Dr. Clark, however, spend their vacations iu field and ofiQce 
work for the U. S. Greological Survey. 

Massachusetts Institute of Technology. — Geologic investigations are 
conducted by the incuml)ent of the chair of geology in this institution. 
Prof. W. O. Crosby, chiefly during vacations ; classes are sometimes 
taken into thefield; and the results of the various studies are sometimes 
prhited in the Te(;hnological Quarterly published by the Institute. 

Utiiversity of Nebraska. — The professor of geology (Lewis E. Hicks, 
in this institution is ex o^cio State geologist, and divides his energies be- 
tween class instruction and field investigation within the State; the 
classes are sometimes introduced to practical field-work in the vicinity 
of the University, and the advanced pupils sometimes aid the professor 
in his work in more distant parts of the State ', and the results are pub- 
lished in a bulletiji of the University. 

Princeton {College of New Jersey.) — Field-work iu geology and paleon- 
tology is carried on in connection with class instruction in this institu- 
tion, and several expeditions have been fitted out in this department 
for exploration and surveys in the western Territories under the direc- 
tion of Prof. Henry F. Osborn. The more important results of the 
original work so performed are i>ublished in the Bulletin and Memoirs 
of the E. M. Museum of Geology and Archfeology of the College of New 
Jersey. The activity iu original investigation has apparently declined 
somewhat during recent years. 

University of Texas. — In the summer of 1888 a chair of geology was 
established in this Institution ; and it is the policy of its incumbent. 
Prof. Robert T. Hill, and of the president of the university, Dr. Leslie 
Waggener, to carry on field studies in connection with class work. It 
is proposed to publish the more important results of original work in 
circulars or bulletins, 

Vassar College. — Although specific jirovision is not made in this col- 
lege for field studies in connection with class work, the professor of 
geology, William B. Dwight, frequently carries his classes into the field 
and thus enlivens the prosaic courses of the text books. A part of the 
results of Professor Dwight's studies in field and office find a jdaco in 
the Proceedings of the Vassar Brothers' Institute, which is connected 
with the college. 

Washburn College. — No provision is made for original investigation 
in connection with class work in this institution, but Prof. F. W. Cragin, 
of the natural history department, devotes his vacations and leisure to 
geologic investigations in which he is sometimes assisted by associates 
and pupils. The preliminary and some of the final results of this work 
are printed in the Bulletin of the Washburn College Laboratory — a 
periodical maintained chiefly by personal enterprise. 



GEOLOGY. 225 

Wisconsin State University. — Nine fellowships have recently been es- 
tablished in tins university thronjjli the intluonce of President T. 0. 
Chaniberlin, nud one or more of tliese is assigned to geology froTu time 
to time, as the bent of thought of fellows may indicate to be wise. A 
cliair of agricultural pbysics is also maintained; and the incumbent, 
Prof. F. 11. King, devotes a large part of his time to original work more 
or less closely connected with geology. A part of President Chamber- 
lin's own time is devoted to researches in geology, the results of which 
are i)ublished by the U. S. Geological Survey. 

There are several American universities aud colleges which make no 
specitic provision for original investigation in geology, but nevertheless 
promote the science through oflicers who are connected with State sur- 
veys, who divide their energies between research and didactic work, 
and who publish the results of their researches in State documents. 

University of Alabama. — Dr. Eugene A. Smith is at the same time 
professor of geology in the university and State geologist, and fre- 
quently receives the assistance of pupils in the prosecution of his State 
work. 

University of Georgia. — During 1888, Dr. J. W. Spencer was called 
to the chair of geology and natural history in this university, and about 
the end of that year was appointed State geologist. The plans for the 
co-ordination of research and instruction here are not yet matured, and 
thus far no publications have emanated either from the university or 
the survey. 

University of Minnesota. — The professor of geology in this institution, 
N. H. Winchell, is also State geologist. Although but little field in- 
struction is introduced in class work, advanced pupils are sometimes 
inducted into practical geology b}" assisting Professor Winchell in the 
State survey. 

University of North Carolina. — No provision is made in this institu- 
tion for original investigation, but the professor of geology and natural 
history, Jose[)h A. Holmes, has adopted the policy of combining class 
instruction with tield study ; and in his capacity as acting State geolo- 
gist he avails himself of the assistance of advanced pupils in the pale- 
ontologic and chemic work carried forward by the State. 

State University of Ohio. — Prof. Edward Orton, State geologist and 
professor of geology in the university, divides his time between survey 
work (in which he is sometimes assisted by advanced pupils) and class 
instruction; and field studies are occasionally undertaken in connection 
with the courses of the text-books. 

Rutgers College. — The professor of geology in this institution. Dr. 
George H. Cook, is also State geologist, and the greater part of his 
energies (and sometimes the assistance of advanced pupils) are devoted 
to State work.

226 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

There are iu addition several educational institutions in which no 
l^rovisiou is made for publication of the results of original investigation, 
and in which there is no connection with State surveys or other insti- 
tutions organized for original work^ but iu which geologic science is in- 
directly promoted — either by the combination of class instruction with 
original investigation or through jiartly independent work on the part 
of the professors of geology or other oflicers, etc. 

Amherst College. — Prof. B. K. Emerson, of this institution, regularly 
carries his classes into the field ; and the field work of instructor and 
pupils is in i^art directed toward certain specific problems upon which 
Professor Emerson is now at work. In addition that geologist spends 
his vacations in field work, the results of which are designed to be pub- 
lished in cxtenso by the U. S. Geological Survey. 

Cornell University. — Prof H.S. Williams, of this university, regu- 
larly combines his course of instruction in geology and paleontology 
with field investigations in southern New York, and sometimes secures 
the assistance of advanced pupils iu work upon the special problems 
which engage his attention from time to time. 

Dartmouth College. — In this institution field work is combined in some 
measure with the regular class instruction, and the vacations and leis- 
ure of the professor of geology, C. H. Hitchcock, are occupied in orig- 
inal investigation. 

Harvard University. — There is in this university a summer school of 
geology, maintained by special fees, and the advanced pupils are given 
liractical instruction in field work each year by the instructor in geol- 
ogy, William M. Davis. Moreover, Profs. N. S. Shaler and J. D. Whit- 
ney, as well as Prof. Davis, devote a large share of their energies to 
original investigations in geology, and important contributions to the 
science are thereby made each year. 

McGill College. — Special provision is not made in this institution 
either for carrying on or publishing results of original investigation ; 
but Sir William Dawson devotes a large share of his time to researches 
in geology and paleontology, and McGill College has, in consequence, 
come to be known as one of the principal centers of geologic work on 
the American continent. It was almost within the period covered in 
this report that this geologist received the distinguished honor of 
knighthood, in recognitionof his abilities as an original investigator in 
geology. 

Middlebury College. — President Ezra Brainerd and Prof. G. H. Seelye, 
of this institution, combine class instruction and field investigation in 
some measure, and, moreover, carry on original researches during va- 
cations. 

University of the City of New YorTc. — Prof. John J. Stevenson, of this 
institution, has, during recent years, devoted his annual vacations to 
original investigations iu the Ai)palachian Mountains, chiefly in the 
"Virginias. 



GEOLOGY. 227 

University of Virginia. — rrof. William M. Fontaine, of the chair of 
Ideology and natural history, devotes a part of his time to original work 
in paleobotany and geology, in which he is sometimes assisted by ad- 
vanced pupils. 

Wesleymi University. — In this institution, like the last, some field 
instruction is given in connection with the regular class work, and, in 
addition, Prof. William North Rice devotes his leisure, in part, to orig- 
inal investigation. 

University of ^Yest Virginia. — Prof. I. C. White, of this institution, 
divides his labors between educational work and original investigation, 
conducted under the auspices of the U. S. Geological Survey. 

Yale University. — Although there is no specific ai)propriation for 
maintaining field investigations in connectiou with class instruction, 
the venerable James D. Dana, professor of geology, occupies his vaca- 
tions and his leisure in field work, and occasionally carries advanced 
classes into the field in the vicinity of New Haven. The professor of 
mineralogy, Edward S. Dana, also carries on original investigations in 
his department. Moreover, the eminent professor of paleontology, O. 
C. Marsh, is largely occupied in original work, at his own cost in part, 
and in part under the auspices of the U. S. Geological Survey. 

SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS. 

There are in this country a number of learned societies and other insti- 
tutions of scientific character which either have funds available for orig- 
inal investigation in geology or employ officers whose work is in part 
original, and which publish the results of such investigations. 

Academy of Xatural Sciences of Philadelphia . — There are in this insti- 
tution professorships in geology and paleontology, and the beneficiaries 
(particularly Prof. Augelo Heilprin and Dr. Joseph Loitly) are occupied 
in original w^ork, the results of Avhich generally find place among the 
regular publications to the academy. 

American Museum of Natural History. — Provision is made in the or- 
ganization of this institution for a curator of the collections in geology 
and paleontology, whose energies are largely devoted to original re- 
search. The position is held by Prof. E. P. Whitfield ; and though his 
original work relates mainly, to paleontology, much of it has geologic 
bearing. The results of his work and of certain other original investi- 
gations in geology are published mainly in the Bulletin of the museum. 

Kew York State Cabinet of Xatural History. — This institution is main- 
tained by the State, and its curator (John 0. Smock) not only has charge 
of the collections, but carries on original investigations in general and 
economic geology. Annual reports, and of late bulletins, are issued. 

Peahody Museum of Gomparatire Zoology. — Provision is made in this 
institution for original investigation, and the results thereof (])art of 
which ate geologic) are printed in the regular series of publications of 
the museum. 



228 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Feabody Museum of Yale University. — In tliis lunseuiii, too, specialists 
are employed in original investigation, as well as in caring for the col- 
lections; and the publications, which are primarily paleontologic and 
only incidentally contain geologic matter, appear in the memoirs of the 
museum. 

Smithsonian Institution. — In carrying out the purpose of its founder to 
increase and diffuse knowledge among men, the Smithsonian Institution 
has at various periods in its existence undertaken geologic investiga- 
tions, some of which were of great importance and extent, and the results 
of these were generally published in part or in entirety. Moreover, the 
results of geologic work carried on under other auspices have been pub- 
lished from time to time. Since the organization of the U. S. Geological 
vey, however, the necessity for geologic work on the part of the Institu- 
tion has diminished, and its activity has declined. 

U. 8. National Museum. — There is provision in this institution for the 
employment of a number of specialists as curators ; and many of these 
othcers are employed in original investigation. A part of the work re- 
lates to geology directly, and also indirectly through paleontology. 
The results are made public in the Proceedings and Bulletins of the 
National Museum. 

Wagner Free Institute of Science. — There are connected with this insti- 
tution four professors, who have charge of the museum and library, give 
free public lectures, and teach the method of — and also make — research. 
The most important original work thus far undertaken was an exi)lora- 
tion of the west coast of Florida and part of the Okeechobee wilderness, 
with special reference to the geology and zoology of the Floridian penin- 
sula, the results of which form an elaborate memoir, prepared by Prof. 
Angelo Heilprin and i^ublished by the Institute in 1887. 

There are in America a large number of scientific societies which pub- 
lish the results of geologic investigation, and thus indirectly promote 
geologic science, although no original work is directly carried on. Most 
of those not noted above are included in the following list:

MISCELLANEOITS. 

The most noteworthy event of the biennial period in American geol- 
ogy was the birth of the Geological Society of America. The project 
of organizing such a society lias been under consideration by the lead- 
ing geologists of the country for a decade ; and a call issued by some 
of its promoters during the summer of 1888, inviting those interested 
to meet at Cleveland on tiie day before the opening of the session of 
the American Association for the Advancement of Science (August 
14), received hearty response ; and temporary organization was there 
eftected. A meeting for completing the organization was held at Ith- 
aca on December 27, and the society was there formally created with 
an original fellowship of one hundred and two. The veteran geologist

and paleontologist, Prof. James Hall, was made president ; and the fol- 
lowing additional officers were elected: First vice president, James D. 
Dana ; second vice-president, Alex. WincheU ; secretary, John J. Stev- 
enson ; Treasurer, Henry S. Williams ; members at large of the council, 
John S. Newberry, J. W. Powell, and Charles H. Hitchcock. 

Another event of moment was the session of theCongr^sGeologiquo 
International at London on August 28 to September 3. The session 
was made notable to American geology by the attendance of a consid- 
erable number of our countrymen, and more particularly by the de- 
cision of the Congr6s to hold its next session at Philadelphia in Sep- 
tember, 1891. The American committee of the Congres Geologique 
International has during the biennial period been actively engaged in 
formulating schemes for the classification and cartography of geologic 
phenomena, and has published several reports by which the literature 
of American systematic geology was materially augmented. 

Still another noteworthy event was the establishment of a strictly 
geologic journal, The American Geologist, in 1888. The establishment 
of this journal is largely due to western enterprise, and it has been 
maintained largely by western talent. The editors and proprietors are : 
Prof. Samuel Calvin, Prof. Edward W. Claypole, Dr. Persifor Frazer, 
Prof. L. E. Hicks, Mr. E. O. Ulrich, Dr. Alexander Wiuchell, and Prof. 
N. H. WincheU. 

LEADING EVENTS IN TEE PROGRESS OF THE BIENNIAL PERIOD. 

Although there is a stage in the development of every science in 
which progress may be best measured by the work of institutions, and 
another in which the advance is best shown by its own fruits, there is 
no stage in which the progress is not primarily due either directly or 
indirectly to individual effort: at first a branch of science is promoted 
directly by the individual often at great personal sacrifice; as its field 
widens and its problems deepen the energies of others are enlisted, and 
many individuals combine their labors; thus the institution is formed, 
and knowledge is promoted by the united efforts of many workers ; but 
whether he is isolated or one of a hundred, whether he is unaided or has 
a score of associates, it is always the individual whose eyes perceive 
new facts and whose mind conceives new ideas. So, however progress 
is measured, it is impossible to state that progress except in the con- 
ceptions originating in individual minds. 

Every advance in science is made through conceptions which spring 
like buds from the growing tree of knowledge, sometimes from the 
main trunk when each marks an epoch in intellectual development, 
more frequently from a main branch, and still more frequently from a 
minor branch, when the advance in knowledge is less striking; and 
sometimes the shooting buds meet and by their union bring forth new 
conceptions of the highest value, — for the conceptions resulting from the 
convergence of many lines of thought are always of higher grade than 
those resulting from divergent lines. While the conceptions constitut-

ing progress originate with iudividuals, the devices for facilitating in- 
terchange of thought in modern times are so numerous and complete 
that many conceptions are disseminated with their growth, students 
keep pace with the progress of their fellows in distant lauds, and so 
contributions to a general conception may be made by many individuals. 
The rapid advance of human knowledge within recent years must be 
attributed not less to the facilities for free interchange of thought now 
existing than to that ever-increasing liberality of modern students which 
leads them to share even the first fruits of their work with the entire 
world. 

Geologic science has been enriched by many notable conceptions dur- 
ing the biennial period 1887-88; some of these are the i)roduct of in- 
dividual minds, while some represent the work of many students upon 
related or identical problems; but only a few of the more prominent 
can be noted. 

GEOLOGIC PHILOSOPHY. 

Philosophic doctrine is the outcome of thought upon difierent lines ; 
when comprehensive it is little affected by the movements upon Jiuy 
one line ; and it is thus so nearly stable that little advance can be per- 
ceived within a year or even a decade. But the time has now come for 
noting an important step in the development of geologic philosophy ; 
for although the movement began some years since among advanced 
thinkers, and although it has not yet extended to the text-books or 
even to the rank and file of workers, its influence is seen in geologic 
literature and is rapidly extending. 

The primary geologic classification was based directly upon the ob- 
jective phenomena of geology ; and early geologic literature was per- 
vaded, and the science shaped, by this fundamental idea. As time went 
on this classification was found too narrow to represent intelligibly the 
facts and their relations, and the desire for a more comprehensive tax- 
onomy was indicated by the semi arbitrary division of the science into 
various departments in which the minor classes were variously defined 
and grouped : Physical geology ; Strnctural geology ; Straligraphic 
geology ; Historical geology ; etc. Although all such divisions were 
partly arbitrary, they contained the germ of a more philosophic classi- 
fication in which the agencies and conditions of geology are recognized. 
Progress in this direction culminated in 1884 in a classification devised 
by Powell to serve as a basis for a bibliograi)hy of North American ge- 
ology. The following divisions are recogni/ed in this classification : 



I. Volcanic geology. 

II. Diastiophic geology. 

III. Ilydric geology. 

IV. Glacic geology. 
V. Eolic geology. 

VI. Biotic geology. 

Viy. Autliropic geology.

RECORD OF SCIENCP: FOR 1887 AND 1888. 



Examination of this system of classification sllo^YS that it lias a triple 
basis — the agencies and conditions of geology form one of the elements, 
the generalized objective phenomena of geology form another, and the 
applications of geologic science lorm a third ; and the classes are neither 
CO ordinate nor definitely seriate, while the minor divisions of each must 
be made on unlike bases. The classification is intermediate between 
the purely objective systems which went before and the predominantly 
genetic systems which were evolved from it. 

In the autumn of 1884 a more elaborate scheme of classification of 
geology was developed by Gilbert, and discussed at the meeting of the 
British Association for the Advancement of Science, at Montreal, under 
the title of a "Plan for a Subject-Bibliography of North American Ge- 
ology."* It is as follows:

DEFORMATION. 

The initial geologic movements (so far as may be inferred from the 
present condition of the rocks of the earth) were distortion or displace- 
ment of the solid or solidifying crust in such manner as to produce ir- 
regularities in the surface of the globe. These are the raovemeuts in- 
volved in mountain growth and in the elevation of continents; they 
have been in operation from the earliest eons recognized by the geolo- 
gist to the present time; and the advances in knowledge concerning 
them include not only current observations upon the movements now 
in progress, but observations upon crumpled and otherwise deformed 
strata, and also legitimate inferences concerning the causes of the 
movements whose effects are recorded in these strata. 

It has long been known that the waters of the Atlantic are advanc- 
ing upon the New Jersey coast, in consequence not only of wave-cut- 
ting, but also of sinking of the land. So rapid indeed is the sinking 
of the land, particularly towards Sandy Hook, that notable geographic 
changes have occurred within the last hundred years, and the mining 
of timber, which grew upon dry land, but is now lodged among its 
stumps many feet beneath tide level and buried beneath the oceanic 
and fluvial deposits, has become an industry of some importance. The

234 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

rate of sinking lias been estimated by Cook at 2 feet per century;* and 
tbe obst'rvatious of the last two years corroborate this estimate. 

This land movement is not confined to the coast of New Jersey, nor 
to historical time. It has recently been shown (1) that the entire 
coastal plain of the Middle Atlantic slope is now undergoing- depression 
so rapid that sedimentation in the numerous estuaries by which it is 
dissected lags behind the sinking, so that sub-aerial alluvium is prac- 
tically absent from the region ; (2) that the Piedmont plain overlook- 
ing the coastal lowlands is rising so rapidly that the rivers are unable 
to cut down their gorges to tide level ; and (3) that the differential 
movement culminates in a line of displacement, which every river 
crosses in a cascade or rapid, and along which the inincipal cities of 
the eastern United States have been located.t It would appear that 
this displacement began in early Pleistocene time, that it is yet in prog- 
ress at a rate probably about as high as quiet orogenic movement ever 
acquires, and that the amount of displacement increases northward from 
perhaps 100 feet at Washington to 400 or 500 feet at New York. 

It is improbable that the great earth-movement of the Middle At- 
lantic slope extends into New England ; for although this part of the 
country is now suffering deformation as recently shown by Shaler, the 
tilting is southward rather than northward as in New Jersey. The 
modern deformation of New England is best shown in the behavior of 
streams. Throughout Massachusetts, Connecticut, and southern New 
Hampshire and Vermont, the greater part of the streams flow from 
north to south or with slight deviations from this direction. Except at 
the headwaters of these streams, where their volume is too slight to 
clean their beds of the glacial waste which encumbers them, their 
valleys are without swamps, and the streams flow upon beds of hard 
rock flanked by terraces of glacial material which record the stages of 
valley-excavation — i. e., all of these south-flowing streams have high 
declivity and are energetically corradiug their beds. A much smaller 
number of New England streams flow to the northward ; and these, un- 
like their south-flowing neighbors, all flow sluggishly in d6bris-cIogged 
valleys and are bordered by swamps instead of terraces — /. e., all of 
these streams have low declivity and are employed in sedimentation 
rather than corrasion. The behavior of both classes of streams sug- 
gests southward tilting of the land and can not be satisfactorily ex- 
plained in any other way;| and this inference is in line with the con- 
clusions of Dana, the elder Hitchcock, and many others who have 
shown that the southward inclination of the terraces of the Connecticut 
Kivor and its tributaries indicates a rise of the land to the northward 
since the recession of the last ice-sheet of the Pleistocene. It is in line, 
too, with the work of Gilbert, Spencer, and others in the region of the

Great Lakes, where, as shown by the first-named geologist in particu- 
hir, there lias been so decided tilting of the land since the retreat of 
the hitest ice-sheet that some of the terraces and shore liues carved out 
bj*Lake Ontario when its northern confine was the receding icesheet, 
now incline southward as mnch as 5 feet per mile in western New York. 
Southward tilting in the western part of the Great Lake region is also 
indicated by the backing of water in the southern afiiueuts of Lake 
Michigan and the consequent conversion of their mouths into swamps 
and lakes as shown by Wooldridge.* 

The inferences of Shaler in New England and Gilbert in New York 
as to the southward tilting of the land are in line with a notable inves- 
tigation of the ancient terraces and beaches of the extinct Lake Agassiz 
by Upham. As the last ice-sheet of the Pleistocene withdrew beyond 
the divide between the Mississippi drainage and that of Hudson's Bay, 
the waters formed by its melting were dammed by the divide and so ac- 
cumulated in swamps, i3onds, and lakes along its front. The largest 
of the lakes occupied the valley now drained by the Red River of the 
North. It was a veritable mediterranean sea, albeit of fresh water, and 
confined on the north by walls of ice alone; for at the period of its 
maximum size it was fully 600 miles long and 200 miles in maximum 
breadth. Pending the final melting of the northern mer de glace this 
lake fonnd outlet over the i)ortage between Lakes Traverse and Big 
Stone, and thence through the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers to the 
Gulf; and, although it has now utterly disappeared from the f<ice of 
the earth, it has left an unmistakable record of its existence and its 
extent in the terraces and beach lines already traced by Upham over 
many hundreds of miles, and in the vast beds of lacustral sediments 
which make the valley of the Red River the paradise of the wheat 
grower.! Now the old shore lines of this extinct lake (named in 
honor of the illustrious Swiss naturalist by Upham) are no longer hori- 
zontal as when fashioned by the wind-swept waters, but incline south- 
ward about 6 inches per mile on an average. This departure from hori- 
zontality in the beach lines has indeed been ascribed (in part at least) 
by Upham to deformation of the surface of the lake by the gravitational 
.attraction of the contiguous ice sheet; but since it has been shown by 
Woodward that this cause is alone incompetent under probable assump- 
tions as to volume of the ice sheot,:j: most geologists who concern them- 
selves with such questions have settled down to the conviction that 
there is here another example of that southward tilting of the area of 
Pleistocene glaciation already noted in New England by Dana and 
others, in New York by Gilbert and his contemporaries, and about Lake 
Michigan by Chamberlain, and morerecently by Woolbridge. Leading 
students of the general subject of terrestrial deformation are indeed dis-

posed to look upon the tilting of the glaciated region as but an exem- 
plilication ot one of the fundamental laws of earth movement: Babbage, 
Hall, Hunt, and Dana long ago, and Button, Fisher, Keade, Alexander 
Winchell, and others within the last lustrum, have shown that the exti^r- 
ior i)ortionsof the earth behave as if in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium, 
ready to rise with the removal and sink with the addition of the matter 
transferred by the processes of gradation. Now it is evident that au 
ice sheet must depress the surface upon which it rests, just as does a 
mass of oceanic sediments, directly by its weight, and also indirectly 
by chilling and so condensing the underlying rocks; and since, as all 
students of the i>rimary agencies and conditions of geology are agreed, 
the viscous mass of the earth responds slowly to stresses tending to pro- 
duce deformation, it is equally evident that the resumption of original 
attitude by any part of the surface after the recession of an ice sheet 
must be gradual and perhaps exceedingly slow. So the southward tilt- 
ing indicated by the shore lines of Lake Agassiz, by the half drowned 
estuaries of Lake Michigan, by the beaches of the ancient Lake Ontario, 
and by the terraces of the Connecticut Eiver, all seem attributable to 
the effort of the resilient terrestrial crust to return to its original form 
on relief from the pressure of the Pleistocene ice sheet; and the diver- 
sity in behavior of the north-Howing and south-tlowing streams of New 
England would indicate that the restoration is even yet barely com- 
plete. 

The ideas current among the leading geologists of the country con- 
cerning the behavior of the earth as an isostatic body when compressed 
beneath a great continental glacier have been summarized by Alexander 
Winchell within a few months.* 

But there are certain comparatively recent changes in level which 
can not be attributed to movements due to the weighting of the land 
beneath the Pleistocene ice sheet. One of the more important contri- 
butions of the biennial period to the general subject of deformation is 
that by LeOonte, on the recent changes of physical geography in Cali- 
fornia indicated by the flora of the coast islands.! Sometime during 
the Pleistocene there was a depression of the Pacific coast by which the 
westernmost of the two ranges belonging to the trans-Sierra mountain 
system was nearly submerged, only the commanding summits rising 
above tide-level to form the islands of Santa Kosa and her companions; 
and this drowned mountain range displays no disposition to return to 
its former altitude. The jieriod of this submergence is indicated, in so 
far as plants may be regarded as chronometers of geologic time, by the 
distintictive Pliocene flora of the islands, which has, according to Le 
Conte, been preserved by reason of its isolation, while the flora of the 
mainland has undergone modification in the struggle against competi- 
tors, enemies, and climatic conditions proper to a great continent.

GEOLOGY. 237 

The most notable Nortli American advances of recent years in the 
observation and interpretation of the resnlts of diastatic movement 
rehite to faultitij;. Two genetic classes of faults have long been recog- 
nized — i. e., normal faults, in which the hade (or inclination of the plane 
of fracture) is toward the thrown side, and reversed or overthrust faults, 
in which the hade is toward the heaved side; and in general the normal 
faults have been attributed to stresses not accompanied b}' horizontal 
compression, and the overthrust faults primarily to horizontal com- 
pressioi. 

A few years ago Archibald Geikie and his collaborators upon the 
Geological Survey of Great Britain concluded that the peculiar struct- 
ure of the Scottish Highlands is determined by overthrust faulting 
iiI)on a grand scale — older strata being pushed over newer, sometimes 
for distances amounting to miles. This conclusion was so novel and 
striking, and so widely at variance from prevailing opinion, that despite 
tlie ability of the geologists by whom it was enunciated and the appar- 
ent conclusiveness of the evidence ui>on which it was based, many con- 
servative students in this country hesitated to accept it ; yet within 
the last two years there have been brought to light on this side of the 
Atlantic almost as striking examples of overthrust faulting as those 
of the Scottish Highlands. 

During 188G McConuell made an extended exploration of the Kocky 
Mountains among the passes followed by the Canadian Pacific Rail- 
road, under the direction and auspices of the Geological Survey of 
Canada. In the course of this exploration he determined the lindts of 
a remarkable faulted region, now about 25 miles wide, though a rough 
estimate places its original width at over 50 miles (the difference indi- 
cating the amount of compression suffered), in which the faults are 
generally of the overthrust type. The whole region is broken by a num- 
ber of parallel, or nearly parallel, longitudinal fractures into a series of 
oblong blocks, and these are tilt(5d and shoved one over the other until 
they have taken the form of a westerly dipping compound monocline, 
rising into a succession of ridges. A section through almost any of 
tiiese ridges, starting from the west, shows, first, Cretaceous shales folded 
under older formations, ranging from upper Carboniferous downward 
through the Devonian and Silurian, and even to the Cambrian. The 
overthrusts on the south fork of Ghost Kiver reach 3 or 4 miles; and 
in these, as in some other cases, the rocks thus faulted have been sub- 
sequently corrugated, and the original fault surface has been Hexed 
into anticlinals and synclinals, parallel to those of the planes of depo- 
sition.* 

Kecent studies in the Appalachian region by Willis and other officers 
of the U.S. Geological Survey have brought to light examples of over- 
thrust faulting, differing only in degree from those of the Scottish 
Highlands and the t)anadian Rocky Mountains; and these observa-

tions have corrected certain early inferences as to the mechanism of snch 
faulting; inferences originating partly in Europe and jiartly in the Ap- 
palachians, and current forman^- years on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Heiin noticed that in the Alps tlie inverted limb of an anticlinal is 
stretched or even crushed out between the anticlinal and synclinal 
curves of an overturn and the flexure thus converted into a fracture, 
and inferred that overthru-st faults are always formed in this manner; 
but Willis points out that this explanation fails to account for many 
of the faults of the Appalachians because the essential fact of squeezed 
beds has not been found in that region. He shows also that the Appala- 
chian sedimentary series, from the Cambrian upward, is composed of 
strata differing greatly in their capacity for resistance to horizontal 
thrusts, and that these variations in rigidity occur from place to place in 
the same strata as well as in the different strata superimposed one on the 
other, and that the rigid strata may not fold at the place where a verti- 
cally adjacent flexible stratum does fold, but that the rigid stratum may 
ride forward on its bedding plane until it reaches an axis (anticlinal or 
synclinal) in which both beds have suffered flexure, and that the forward 
movement may then sheer across the beds on the opposite dip, produc- 
ing a fault.* Under this view it would appear that the yielding of 
rocks to horizontal pressure may take i^Iace, (1) as corrugation ; (2) as 
overthrusts, perhaps originating in incipient corrugations ; (3) as vari- 
ous combinations of corrugation and overthrust faulting, the difference 
in effect depending upon difference in structure, difference in the pressure 
beneath superincumbent beds, and other differences in conditions. 

Willis's inferences from A])palachian structure have been checked by 
experimentation. During the past year he has subjected masses of wax 
consisting of alternating layers of varying rigidity, built up in imitation 
of the rocky strata of the earth's crust, to horizontal compression, the 
waxen strata being variously loaded in different experiments ; and he 
finds that the deformation of the miniature strata in his models imitates 
the deformation displayed on a grander scale in the Appalachian Mount- 
ains. 

Another order of faults, also resulting from horizontal compression, 
has recently been developed by Davis. There are in the Connecticut 
Valley extensive deposits of sandstone and shale of Triassic age, of un- 
known thickness, generally dii)ping eastward at a considerable angle ; 
and there are in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and northern Virginia sim- 
ilar deposits of Triassic sandstone, also of unknown thickness, dipping 
westward at high angles. In both of these areas the existence of faults 
has long been suspected, and in a few cases minor faults have actually 
been discovered ; so the feeling has gained ground that despite the persis- 
tent and high dips over broad areas, the deposits are only of limited thick- 
ness. Now Davis has shown t that in the Connecticut area there are

intercalated within the sandstones certain sheets of trap, mainly intru- 
sive ; and using these distinctive beds as data planes in the otherwise 
homogeneous deposits, he finds that the same beds re appear many 
times, and that in some cases several successive trap ridges are formed 
by outcropping edges of a single sheet, the mass having been thrown 
into a series of parallel blocks and subsequently so degraded as to leave 
the harder trap projecting in the form of strongly accented surface 
features. Ilis explanation of the faulting in this region is unique. He 
supposes that the Triassic sandstones were originally deposited in hor- 
izontal beds upon an eroded surface of highly inclined (but not vertical) 
schists, gueises, etc. ; that after the completion of Triassic deposition, 
horizontal compression occurred ; that the inclined crystalline strata 
slipped upon each other, as does a row of fallen books when ijushed to 
upright position, and thus became more nearly vertical ; and that as 
the successive blocks (defined perhaps by intercalations of softer mat- 
ter) approached verticality the veneer of Triassic sediments above was 
broken through by a succession of approximately vertical faults coin- 
ciding with the planes of slipping among the crystalline strata. Davis's 
hypothesis is certainly suggestive, and, if valid, constitutes a notable 
advance in the branch of geology dealing with the deformation of the 
earth. 

The terra incognita of American geographers for many years has 
been, singularly enough, not the comparatively inaccessible mountains 
and deserts of the West, but a tract in southwestern Missouri, north- 
western Arkansas, and eastern Indian Territory. Somewhere here was 
supposed to belong that will-o'-the-wisp of geographers and geologists 
alike, the Ozark Mountain system — a half-ideal mountanic tract com- 
monly named in geographic treatises and sometimes vaguely located in 
small-scale maps, though no geographer knew their exact position and 
no geologist knew their structure. Now during the last year or two 
a part of this tract has been surveyed topographically by oflicers of the 
U. S. Geological Survey and its general configuration ascertained ; and 
moreover the work of the geological survey of Arkansas has extended 
along its southern flanks and the predominant structural characteristics 
ascertained. According to Branner and Coinstock, the region suffered 
post-Paleozoic deformation now expressed by corrugation approaching 
the Appalachian type, the strata lying in a series of folds of nearly 
east- west direction ; * and as pointed out by the former in a communica- 
tion before the American Association for the xVdvancement of Science 
at Cleveland, the crystalline rocks found along the southern flanks of 
the corrugated tract are not eruptive, as they have hitherto been re- 
garded, but Arch;ean, so that the region would appear to be homologous 
with and probably a continuation of the Appalachian region of eastern 
United States.

240 RECORD or SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

During the biennial period there have been some valuable foreign 
contributions to our liiiowledge of the causes and conditions of niount- 
aiu-uuiking, notably the development of the conception of the " level- 
of-no-strain;" for as shown upon i)hysical grounds, by Eeade, Fisher, 
G. H. Darwin, and Davison, there is at limited depth within the terres- 
trial crust a horizon or couchc in which tangential stress disappears. 
This conception has modified American as well as foreign thought, but 
thus far no important contributions to the subject have beeu made on 
this side of the Atlantic. 

Apropos to the conclusions of geologists and physicists concerning the 
isostatic condition (or condition of hydrostatic equilibrium) of the exte- 
rior crust of the earth, ami of the bearing of these conclusions upon the 
general problem of mountain-making, reference may be made to a prac- 
tically new conception as to certain relations between sedimentation 
and depression which bears upon the theory of mountain-making re- 
cently advocated by Reade. It may be thus stated : Lines of sedi- 
mentation are the margins of continents, and the sediments are laid 
down not upon horizontal surfaces, but upon seawardly sloi)ing bot- 
toms ; so the sediments do not form horizontal beds, but take a variable 
seaward slope, determined by marine currents, wave action, etc. Thus 
the mass of sediments is collectively in the condition of a mass of snow 
upon a roof or upon a mountain side ; i. e., in a condition of potential 
instability or inequipotentiality. If the mass is stable in either case, it 
is because the friction among the particles exceeds the attraction of 
gravitation upon the particles; it is obvious that if i)article friction 
were reduced by augmentation of temperature or by alteration of con- 
stitution, or if the efticieucy of gravitation were increased by addition 
to the mass, tlie point of stability might be passed, when the mass 
would move in the direction of the slope; and it is equally obvious 
that if an inequipotential mass expand, the resulting movement will 
not take place equally in all directions, but mainly or wholly in the 
direction of least resistance, which is that of the slope. Since the 
sediments fringing continents are in a condition of inequipotentiality, 
any movement due to the rise of isogeotherms or other cause must take 
place in a single direction ; and it might not be limited to that due to 
expansion, for other factors co-operate. Supplemented by this addi- 
tional conception, the hypothesis of mountain growth so ably advocated 
by HerscheP (who alone recognized vaguely the conception), Eabbage, 
Hall, Dana, Le Conte, Reade, and a score of others, appears to gain 
much in acceptability.t The great displacement of the Middle Atlan- 
tic slope has been attributed to downward and seaward settling of the 
inequipotential mass of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments constituting 
the coastal plain.^

GEOLOGY. 241 

Since diastatic movements are predominantly vertical and measured 
from sea-level as a datum plane, the determination of tlie mean sea-level 
(commonly called the " ligure of the earth," or, more properly, the yeoid) 
is imj)ortant to geologists. The " figure of the earth " is also important 
to geologists in another way: It has long been known that despite the 
gravitational attraction of mountains and continental masses a plumb- 
line suspended at the sea-shore is generallj^ deflected seaward, and that 
in some cases a plumb-line suspended at the base of a mountain range 
is deflected toward the plain rather than the mountains ; and accordingly 
it has been supposed by many physicists, astronomers, and geologists 
that the ro(;ks constituting the ocean bottom are heavier than those of 
the land, and that the rocks underlying plains are often heavier than 
those forming mountain masses. Suess and some others have indeed 
maintained that such mountain systems as the Andes must attract and 
materially elevate the surface of contiguous ocean waters; but Pratt 
and several other careful students have, on the contrary, advocated the 
simi)le inference from observation; and Faye has attributed the great 
iuecpialities of the earth's surface to the more rapid refrigeration and 
consequent condensation of sea bottoms than of laud surfaces. Now, 
the determination of the differences in density indicated by the anom- 
alous deflection of the plumb-line in certain cases, and so the solu- 
tion of some of the most profound problems with which geologists have 
ever grappled, depends, first, upon the determination of the general 
form of the geoid, and second, upon the development of a formula by 
which the gravitational attractions of adventitious rock masses, and of 
rock masses varying in density, can be computed. The importance of 
these inquiries has been recognized by some of the ablest mathemati- 
cians, physicists, and geologists, including Thomson, Clarke, Pratt, 
Fisher, Stokes, Helmert, G. IJ. Darwin, Fischer, and others. For some 
years past Woodward has been engaged upon these problems ; and dur- 
ing 1888 he published an elaborate discussion of the whole subject, in- 
cluding analyses of the results reached by former investigators, and 
formulae applicable in evaluating the deformation of water surfaces by 
the gravitation.il attraction of ice masses, continents, and mountains, 
the changes in level of inconstant lakes, etc.* While the immediate 
result of Woodward's researches can scarcely be regarded as a con- 
tribution to knowledge of the general phenomena of deformation, his 
contribution is worthy of note as a sound basis for further investigation. 

DEGRADATION. 

All portions of the earth standing above the level of the sea are sub- 
ject to degradation. Different processes effect degradation, but incom- 
paniibly the most potent is the action of rain and rivers, Now the whole 
subject of hydro-dynamic action has received more attention from Amer-

242 RECOKD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

ican geologists than Irom those of any other country, and the greater 
part of our knowledge of the subject must be credited to American in- 
vestigators. Thus, it was American geologists employed in the caiion- 
cut plateaus and mountains of the western Territories who discovered 
that the water of a river is not so much the agert of corrasion (which 
is one of the principal modes of degradation) as the vehicle by which 
the agent is rendered operative, and that the real agent of corrasion 
is the sand or other material with which the water of rivers is loaded. 
Pure water is i)ractically impotent as a corrading agent; but when fur- 
nished with tools in the form of sand grains it rapidly cuts away the 
hardest rocks. And this is only one of many American contributions 
to the subject. 

Until recently it has been commonly believed that while the sand 
grains and other matter held in suspension in river water directly in- 
creases corrasion, there is an indirect diminution in corrading ca])acity 
going with the addition of such matter, due to the absorption of a por- 
tion of the energy of the stream in transporting the solid matter. Ac- 
cording to one of the highest authorities on the subject, " where a 
stream has all the load of a given degree of comminution which it is 
capable of carrying, the entire energy of the descending water an<l load 
is consumed in the translation of the Avater and load, and there is none 
applied to corrasion. - - - The work of transportation may thus 
monopolize a stream to the exclusion of corrasion, or the two works 
may be carried forward at the same time." * The same geologist has as- 
sumed the practical equality of the two elements, and thus that corra- 
sion is little affected by load. Such has been the state of opinion on 
this subject for a decade. 

Within a few mouths another American contribution of the first iiD- 
portance has been made to this subject : In a paper read before the 
National Academy of Sciences in November, 188S, Powell i)ointed out 
that there is a distinction between the sediment rolled or pushed along 
the bottom of a stream, and that which is of such degree of comminu- 
tion as to float in the running water; and that to the extent that ma- 
terials are rolled along the bottom by impact the energy of the water 
is indeed utilized in transportation, as held by Gilbert and others, but 
that to the extent that transportation is accomplished by flotation, tne 
gravity of the particles themselves is the entire force of transportation ; 
so that w^hateveris driven is transported by the energy of the water, while 
whatever floats is transported by its own inherent gravity. Thuswithiu 
certain wide limits, and under certain conditions of comminution of the 
load, the energy of a stream would appear not to be diminished but on 
the contrary greatly increased by the addition of load. If the law thus 
formulated be valid (and its validity has not thus far been questioned) 
its discovery will become of great and wide-reaching practical value to

students of engiiieering problems, as well as togeolopsts concerned with 
the various and increasingly important problems of degradation. 

Unquestionably the most noteworthy contribution to objective geol- 
ogy during the biennial period is the recognition by several students of 
the intimate relation between topographic configuration and geologic 
history. Although fully matured only within a few months, the concep- 
tion found birth during the days of active geologic investigation in 
western Territories, originating, as have so many other wide-reaching 
inductions, in the fertile brain of Powell, but receiving notable impetus 
through the early work of Button. The former geologist pointed out 
that one of the leading determinants of degradation is found in the 
declivity of streaujs, and that there is a certain minimum declivity be- 
yond which there is neither corrasiou nor transportation. It is of 
course evident that no stream can sink its channel below the level of 
the sea ; and as Powell pointed out, it is equally evident that at a dis- 
tance from the sea a stream can not sink its channel below a certain 
altitude above tide which will give a slopejust sufficient to permit tiow- 
age; and also that no tributary can corrade its channel below the level 
of its primary. This lowest limit of corrasiou and transportation may 
be called the base level of erosion.* The importance of this conce[)tion 
was realized by several of the leading geologists of the world, but cir- 
cumstances prevented further development of the subject, and the con- 
ception lay dormant for years. 

Peceutly, different geologists at work in eastern United States have 
noticed certain intermontane plains and ancient terraces which can be 
explained only upon the hypothesis that during some past period the 
laud stood lower than now, and remained stationary until not only the 
rivers and their tributaries, but the minor streamlets — and even the 
rain-born rills and so the entire surface, were reduced to a level below 
Avhich degradation was impossible; and the term base level was ex- 
tended not only to rivers and their tributaries, but to whole continents, 
so that to-day the term is applied to a bi-dimensional surface rather than 
a series of uni-dimensional lines. Moreover, it was found that the inter, 
montane plains are in many cases bounded by steep slopes and inter- 
sected by sharp-cut gorges and ravines which could only be exiilained 
on the assumption that at the close cf the base-level period the land 
was lifted so high that degradation was greatly accelerated, but for a 
period too short to permit the general reduction of the area to a new 
base level; and the geologists concluded that the plains tell of altera- 
tions in level of the land as well as of long standing at a single level. 
The conception expanded still further as study progressed until it came 
to be perceived that every hill and valley is a record of geologic activ- 
ity depending upon the relation between land and sea, and thus indi- 
cating the geographic configuration of past periods. So a new geologic

al[)lial)et was devised, and now geologists read geologic liistory from the 
liills as Avell as from the strata and tbeir contained fossils. 

This line of investigation has been successfnlly i)ursued hy Davis,* 
who has ac(]uired such skill in the interi)retalion of geologic history 
from topographic forms as to ha able to read the principal events in 
the geologic development of ]S"ew Jersey and Pennsylvania from topo- 
grai)liic mai)S ; it bas been pursued by McGee with such success that 
" probably for the first time important practical conclusions, involving 
the consideration of hypogeal structure and orogenic movement, have 
been based on the interpretation of topography and on inferences from 
the present behavior of the streams by which the topography has been 
determined ; " t and it has also been pursued with success by Willis in 
the central Appalachian region. So complete has been the develop- 
ment of this method of investigation that nearly as much information 
concerning the geologic history of the Atlantic slope has been obtained 
from the toi)ographic configuration of the region within two years as 
was gathered from the sediments of the costal plain and their contained 
fossils in two generations. 

The interpretation of geologic history from topographic configuration 
may well be called the ISfew Geology. It opens a new field for the science 
so extensive as to nearly double its domain ; and this field has been 
fully entered by American geologists alone and within the last two 
years. 

DEPOSITION. 

The clastic rocks — the products of deposition — have been more exten- 
eively studied than any other class of geologic phenomena ; out of their 
study has grown the greater part of geologic literature ; surveys and 
commissions have been endowed chiefiy for the purpose of investigating 
them ; national and international conventions have been established to 
discuss them; and their relations to science in general, to the arts, and 
to the welfare of the race have been elaborated by a host of students. 

During the biennial period special attention has been given to this 
branch of geology under the stimulus afibrded by the organization and 
active work of the Congres Geologique International abroad and the 
American committee of the Congres in this country. The American com- 
mittee operated mainly through subcommittees, consisting of a few spe- 
cialists (one of whom was the reporter of the subcommittee) and some- 
times associates. Each subcommittee sought to develop a taxonomy 
apjdicable to a particular i)art of the geologic column, and the various 
subclassifications are designed to be thrown together into a general 
taxouomic system similar to but more refined than those current in 
objective geology for a generation. The reporters were, on the Archean 
Persifer Frazer; on the Lower Paleozoic, N. IJ. Winchell; on the

Upper Paleozoic, 11. S. Williams (Devonian), and J. J. Stevenson (Car- 
boniferous); on llic Mesozoic, G. H, Cook; on tiie Cenozoic, E. A. 
Smith (marine Cenozoic), and E. D. Cope (interior Cenozoic) ; and on 
the Quaternary and recent, C. H. Bitchcock. The several reports were 
edited and prefaced with a history of the committee by Frazer, printed 
in an octavo volume of about 250 pages, and distributed at the London 
session of the Congres Geologique International. It should be ob- 
served that these reports, and the general system into which they are 
designed to be thrown, generally represent the primitive analytic classi- 
fication or classification by products, and not the synthetic classification 
or classification by genesis, mentioned in an earlier paragraph. 

The formal reports of the American committee represent however 
but a part of the activity in current thought awakened through the or- 
ganization of the Congres. In his vice-presidential address before the 
American Association at New York in 1887, Gilbert developed certain 
fundamental considerations in geologic taxonomy, nomenclature, and 
cartography. The address brought out clearly the distinction between 
classifications based upon structural units, and upon time units respect- 
ively — classifications which may be perfectly distinct, though both may 
traverse the same ground and which are both valuable for different 
purposes; c. </., the mining geologist may only be interested in the 
structural classification, while the paleontologist or student of geo- 
chrony may be interested only in the time classification. It is just to 
say that this address elicited adverse criticism, notably by Frazer.* A 
year later Vice-President Cook addressed his section of the American 
Association at Cleveland on a similar subject. A statement of the meth- 
ods of cartograph}' in use by the U. S. Geological Survey in 1885 was 
l)resented before the Congres Geologique Intern;itional at Berlii^ in 
that year by McGee, and was published in 1888 in the compte rendu of 
the session ; and other contributions to the taxonomy of the clastic rocks 
have appeared. 

It is to be noted that the interest awakened by these discussions re- 
sulted not only in much writing on geologic taxonomy based upon infor- 
mation already in hand, but also in much valuable work in the field; 
and the outcome of this work comprises several of the most important 
contributions to geologic progress made during the last two years. 

Foremost among these must be placed the recognition by Irving and 
his associates (Chamberlin and Van Ilise) of a vast mass of sediments, 
nearly G miles in vertical thickness, below the base of the previously 
known fossiliferous rocks of the terrestrial crust and above the original 
crystalline nucleus which everywhere forms the fouiulntion upon whicli 
the clastic strata, are built. This newly-recognized series of rocks is 
best developed in the Lake Superior region, where it was studied by 
Irving and his associates; but apparent equivalents have been found iu

New England by Pumpelly, in the Grand Caflon region by Walcott and 
Powell, in Central Texas by Waleott, and in. some other parts of the 
country. Irving was disposed to separate the series into two groups, 
each co-ordinate with the Devonian, Silurian, Cambrian, etc. — viz, the 
Keweenawan and Huronian, — and to class the entire series as a great 
system co ordinate with the Paleozoic, for which he proposed the term 
Agnotozoic* The preseut disposition among leading American geolo- 
gists is, however, to reduce the series to the taxonomic rank of the 
groups (Devonian, Silurian, etc.), and to combine its divisions uuder the 
name Algonkiau. 

Second in importance to the recognition of the Algonkian must be 
placed the discovery in Texas during 1887 of a series of Cretaceous de- 
posits underlying the Dakota formation (the supposed base of the cre- 
taceous iu this country), which is paleontologically equivalent to the 
lower half of the European cretaceous. The bridging of this break in 
the history recorded in American sediments is due to the labors of Hillt 
and C. A. White. | The evidence upon which the conclusions of these 
investigators rest is largely paleoutologic, aud their discovery is of in- 
terest to paleontologists as well as geologists. 

Another noteworthy event, also of interest to the paleontologist, while 
at the same time important in statigrai)hy, is the elucidation of the 
structure of the Taconic Mountains in western I^Tew England, largely 
by Walcott, during 1887 and 1888. There is in eastern New York and 
western New England a region of faulted and metamorphosed crystal- 
line or subcrystalline rocks, generally deeply mantled by drift, which 
has been theintellectnal battle-ground of nearly all American geologists 
given to controversy for over half a century. In the early forties some 
of fhese rocks were erroneously grouped, and eiforts were made to give 
this fictitious group a place in systematic geology under the name 
"Taconic system" and the " Taconic question" has been before the geo- 
logic world from that day almost to this. Late in 188G, and again iu 
1887, Walcott visited the region, and after much labor discovered the 
defective arrangement, ascertained the true relations of the strata, and 
made public his conclusions. In this work he was greatly aided, by the 
results of careful field studies extending over many years, by the emi- 
nent geologist of Yale, James D. Dana. The careful work in the field 
by Dana and Walcott has however been criticised. The contributors 
to the subject during the biennial period include Hunt, Marcou, Miller, 
Newberry, Vogdes, A. Winchell, N. H. Winchell, and others. But to 
the geologist interested in substantial progress rather than polemics, 
and to the layman interested in the practical results of geologic investi- 
gation, the most satisfactory contribution ever made to the "Taconic

easily be quoted at length : 

"1§4I-1§88."* 

An event of some importance to students of the multifarious prod- 
ucts of deposition is the definition of the (Johimbia formation. There 
is a break in geologic history, as commonly interpreted, between the 
Neocene and the Pleistocene, — a hiatus partly natural and partly taxo- 
nomic, and exceedingly difficult to close by reason of diverse methods 
of classification as well as by reason of the dearth of common phenom- 
ena. But the formation under consideration is a superficial deposit of 
known genesis, intimately connected with the other Pleistocene depos- 
its of the country ; it is at the same time a Ibssiliferous sedimentary de- 
posit as intimately connected with the Neocene and Eocene formations 
of the middle Atlantic slope as these are connected among themselves; 
and thus the formation not only covers the natural discontinuity be- 
tween the Neocene and Pleistocene, but, since it is susceptible of classi- 
fication with either, closes the taxonomic hiatus as well.t 

There has long been grave uncertainty as to the relations among cer- 
tain members of that Silurian or Cambrian rock series of the upper Mis- 
sissipiii Valley known in part as the Lower Magnesian Limestone of 
Owen ; and it is a source of gratification to geologists to note that, in 
the second volume of his final report, N. H. Winchell has 'clearly set 
forth the relations of the various members of this series, particularly in 
Minnesota and Wisconsin. The series, beginning at the base of the 
well characterized St. Peter Sandstone, is as follows: (1) Shakopee 
Limestone; (2) New Richmond Sandstone; (3) main body of limestone 
("Lower Magnesian" in part) ; (4:) Jordan Sandstone; (5) St. Lawrence 
Limestone; (6) a bed of shales; (7) Dresbach Sandstone (the last four 
representing the St. Croix); (8) a bed of shales; and (0) Hinckley 
Sandstone (the last six constituting the Potsdam of Wisconsin); the 
whole resting upon the red shales and sandstones which pass into the 
coi)per-bearing series. | 

One of the most puzzling problems which the geologists employed in 
the western Territories have been called upon to solve is the absence 
of formations elsewhere of great volume, without marked unconformity 
between the older and newer deposits. This condition is especially con- 
spicuous in the Rocky Mountains, where the Silurian is sometimes re- 
duced to a few feet of shales or limestones, and is sometimes ahuost 
unrecognizable. It is also conspicuous in the Black flills, where, ac- 
cording to Newton, the Cambrian inchules but 250 feet of sandstones 
and quartzites, while the Silurian proper and the Devonian are absent, § 
althougli tliere are no marked unconformities. Newton's observations 
were verified and the anomalous relation of the Black Flills rocks dis-

cussed during- the past year by Crosby ;* and it was sLown that during 
Silurian and Devonian time the region now upheaved as an isolated 
mountain tract in the midst of a great continent must have been the bot- 
tom of an ocean so broad and deep that sediments were not transported 
to it in sufficient quantity to form deposits of any considerable volume — 
that during a large part of the Paleozoic the region must have been 
iu much the same condition as are today the abyssmal depths of the 
south Atlantic and Pacific, in which dredges gather modern shells, Ter- 
tiary shark teeth, and Cretaceous otoliths at a single sweep. 

The same author has recently discussed also the origin of the quartz- 
ites, cherty concretions, and other siliceous aggregations found in deep- 
sea deposits, and shown that they must result in large part from solu- 
tion of the organic silica contained in sponge spicules, diatom shells, 
etc., and subsequent deposition of the silica in the mineral form ; the 
mineral silica thus disseminated among the mechanical sediments some- 
times segregating therefrom in solid nodules or the hollow bodies called 
geodes.^ 

VULCANISM. 

The recently renewed volcanic activity on the Hawaiian Islands led 
to an interesting incident — i. e., a second visit to the islands by the 
venerable Dana, for the purpose of re-examining in the light of modern 
knowledge the phenomena studied by him half a century before. Cer- 
tain results of the new observations werci summarized in a general 
discussion of volcanic action, in which the principal movements are 
classified as follows: (1) the ascending movement of the liquid rock 
in the subterrranean conduit of the volcano from the deep-seated 
crustal or sub-crustal region of fusion ; (2) the projection of the lava 
aerially upward from the surface of the liquid lava in the vent, which is 
accompanied by outflow whenever the height reached by the lavas is such 
that thev find an outlet either over or through fissures in the walls of 
the crater. Each of these operations (upflow and outflow) involves an 
expulsion of material from subterranean regions ; and a usual conse- 
quence is (3) a subsidence or down plunge of the overlying rock or of 
portions of the cone. These movements of upthrow, ejection, and sub- 
sidence are the most universal and strongly marked of the entire series 
of volcanic phenomena. Connected with them, there are in addition 
however (4) the escape of vapors from the crater, and (5) displacements 
and the opening of fissures. | The last movements are freq uently accom- 
panied by earth tremors, and sometimes by destructive earthquakes. 
These observations upon the behavior of living volcanoes throw light 
upon the history of the extinct volcanoes whose craters, lava sheets, or 
even "necks" alone remain for examination by the geologist.

GEOLOGY. 249 

Next to active volcanoes in significance to systematic geologists, and 
in interest and iustructiveness to laymen, come those recently extinct; 
and during tlie past two years such a volcano lias been investigated by 
Diller. This volcano is perhaps the most recent within the United 
States. Its crater, overlooking Snag Lake 10 miles northeast of Lassen 
Peak in northern California, is indeed cold, but the lapilli and scoria of 
which it is composed have been scarcely affected by tlie action of the 
elements, and its slopes are as high as such material will maintain ; 
the lava sheet which flowed from it, and which by damming a small 
creek formed Snag Lake, is scarcely discolored by weathering'; the vol- 
canic ashes which it vomited yet lie as they fell, little touched by the 
winter rains or the summer thunder showers; the stumps of trees 
smothered by the ashes and charred by the lava have not yet decayed; 
and ill! the phenomena indicate that this debris-swatlied volcano was 
in active operation but a few scores or at most a few hundreds of years 
ago.* 

This, although probably the youngest of the series, is only one of 
those volcanoes which, beginning in early Tertiary time and culmi- 
nating in activity about the Pliocene or early Pleistocene, flooded 
hundreds of thousands of square miles of the Pacific sloj^e with lava 
sheets the most extensive of the globe. Most of the orifices from 
which these lavas welled have been obliterated or buried by geologic 
changes; but one of them remains, and is of such vast dimensions 
that the water with which it is partly filled forms the deepest lake on 
the continent. This " Crater Lake," which lies in the heart of the Cas- 
cade range in southern Oregon, is 2,000 feet deep, and the bounding 
walls rise 900 to 2,000 feet above its level. It was explored by Button 
in 1880. t 

Kilauea represents active vulcanism ; Snag Lake represents the effects 
of vulcanism yet untouched b^' time; Crater Lake is a mighty volcano 
long dead and already mouldering into dust; the older lava slieets and 
degraded craters of Oregon and northern California contain a record 
of vulcanism partly eflaced by the ever operative agencies of deg- 
adation; but there is a still later stage in the obliteration of the vol- 
canic record which has been brought to light within two years: About 
Mount Taylor in northern New Mexico there is an extensive area now oc- 
cupied chiefly by sedimentary rocks of Mesozoic age, which have evi- 
dently suffered great degradation duringCenozoic time; and through the 
strata project cylindrical masses of basalt, sometimes large enough to 
be dignified by the name of mountains, which evidently rei)resent the 
contents of the pipes or ducts through which lava was extruded during 
past ages, probably in sufficient volume to sheet vast areas with lava, as 
southern Oregon was sheeted during the later epoch ; but these lava 
sheets have been completely denuded over hundreds of scjuare miles,

and nothing" remains to indicate their existence save the indurated con. 
tents of the pipes by which they were supplied. These remnants of 
lava cohimns, or "volcanic necks" as they are called by Button (by 
whom they were discovered and interpreted), are among the most inter- 
esting records of vulcanism extant, since by means of them the geologist 
descends far into the crust of the earth toward the ultimate seat of vol- 
canic action. 

In the early days of geology there were two rival hypotheses concern- 
ing the formation of the rocks of the earth, viz, the Plutonic and the 
Neptunic. The battle between these doctrines raged for a generation 
before theNeptuuists gained the ascendancy; but it is now recognized 
that by far the greater part of the rocks open to observation were de- 
posited in the seas, and that only a subordinate part were extruded in 
molten condition from the bowels of the earth. Yet a vestige of the 
Plutonic hypothesis has persisted until to-day, particularly in Germany, 
but to some extent in this country, in the form of a belief that the vol- 
canic rocks of the earth represent a more or less definite series ranging 
and gradually changing from the Archean to the Pliocene — that the la- 
vas of the Paleozoic were unlike those of the Mesozoic, and these again 
unlike those of the Ceuozoic, and that the successive differences consti- 
tute a record of the earth's history, susceptible of an interpretation only 
less defiinite than that afibrded by the succession of organic life. This 
belief (which must not be confounded with Eichthofen's induction con- 
cerning the succession of rocks among the lavas of a particular province 
and period, and Button's admirable explanation of the law of that succes- 
sion) was so seriously shaken when the results of the investigation of the 
Washoe rocks of Nevada by Hague and Iddings were published* that 
it has now been largely abandoned by German students and teachers. 
So an American discovery has, within the biennial period, and in at 
least one foreign country, practically revolutionized thought concern- 
ing the snccession and significance of volcanic rocks as geologic chro- 
nometers. 

Although sometimes unquestionably connected with general deforma- 
tion, seismism or earthquake movement is known to accomi)any vol- 
canic action in many cases. Buring the biennial period the most im- 
portant contribution ever made to seismology — a contribution which 
revolutionized earlier conceptions and placed the entire science ui)on a 
new and firm foundation- — enmnated from the American geologist But- 
ton, as the outcome of his studies of the Charleston earthquake of ISSG. 
The contribution includes two distinct conceptions: (1) It was found 
on examining the means hitherto em])loyed for ascertaining the depth 
of earth(iuake foci that, all involve sources of error of such magnitude 
that the resulting determinations are worthless; and so a method was

devised which is depeiulont, not upon the always uncertain data hith- 
erto eiiii)lo.Yed, but upon observations of intensity wliieh can be ver- 
ified by independent observers even weeks or months after a great 
shock, and in which the errors in judgment of the observer have com- 
paratively little effect upon the result. In this method the various ob- 
servations upon intensity are first mapped, and a center (which is the 
epicentrum of the volcanic area) from which the intensities diminish in 
all directions is found by simple inspection; the intensity observations 
are then assembled and plotted in the order of their distance from this 
center upon a diagram in which the ordiuates represent intensities and 
the abscissa distance from the epicentrum ; when it is found that in all 
cases there is a point of intiection in the intensity curve at a distance 
from the epicentrum depending upon the depth of the centrum (or focus) 
which can thus be determined by a simple formula. This method of 
determining the depth of earthquake foci is eminently satisfactory, and 
is unquestionably destined to supplant all others in every case in which 
it is applicable. By means of it the focus of the Charleston earthquake 
was shown to be about 12 miles beneath the surface.* (2) Hitherto the 
determinations of the velocity of earthquake transmission have been so 
variable that the more cautious seismologists looked upon them with 
susjMcion. Now, owing partly to the extended use of standard time 
throughout the United States, the time observations upon the Charles- 
ton earthquake over the 850,000 square miles affected are satisfactory 
beyond all precedent; these observations have been carefully reduced 
and discussed (and in this work Button had the assistance of New- 
comb), and a coefficient for the velocity of earthquake transmission, in- 
comparably more trustworthy than the earlier determinations, has been 
deduced. The mean result of the various observations gives a velocity 
of 5,184 rt 80 meters per second. This coefficient, like the method of de- 
termining the depth of earthquake foci, is unquestionably destined to 
supplant all others, and so seismologists are now armed with new means 
of prosecuting further researches upon the most mysterious of terres- 
trial phenomena. But Button's contributions are no less important to 
the geologist than to the seismologist in that they coincide with exi)er- 
iment and observation upon the elasticity, rigidity, density, and other 
properties of solid and homogeneous rocks, and so throw light upon the 
condition of the sub crust of the earth far beyond the depths which di- 
rect examination can ever reach. 

ALTERATION. 

The products of the alteration of rocks by the various agencies to 
which they are subject are multifarious : The soils are formed by the 
disintegration and decay of rocky strati; the sediments of seas and 
lakes are first consolidated into rock, and sometimes subsequently

252 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

transformed from the clastic or amorphous to the crystalliue form ; min- 
eral veins and ore deposits result from alterations due to heat, pressure, 
and other conditions; gases are set free in the processes of alteration of 
original sediments, and are sometimes accumulated in the rocks in great 
volume; and so a large share of those geologic i^henomena which are 
of general economic interest result from processes of alteration of the 
rocks of the earth. The products of many of these processes belong 
rather to lithology and chemistry, or to the arts, than to geology; but 
some of them fall within the legitimate field of the latter science. 

Several years ago E. W. Hilgard proposed a classification of the soils 
of certain Southern States by the conditions of their genesis ; but cir- 
cumstances prevented the application of this classification to the soils 
of the country at large. During the past year Powell has adopted and 
extended this genetic classification of soils, and proposes toapi)ly it to 
the entire country. Thus far the classification and the plan for its ap- 
plication has been published only in brief;* but it may be added that 
soil investigation has already been commenced in several divisions of 
the U. S. Geological Survey, and that a number of soil maps have been 
prepared and are shortly to be published. Agricultural geology is the 
geology of the future; and although great progress in the study and 
classification of soils has not j^et been made, it is of interest to note 
that the work has been definitely commenced during the biennial period, 
and that important results will doubtless soon appear. 

Two notable events in geologic progress during recent years are (1) 
the discovery by Becker that enormous masses of crystalline rocks in 
the Sierra Nevada Mountains, hitherto supi)osed to be Archean, are, 
instead, matamor[)hosed sediments of Cretaceous age ; and (2) the elu- 
cidation of the genesis of the iron ores of the Lake Superior region by 
Irving and Van Hise; but these events primarily belong rather to the 
domain of lithology than geology. 

In the history of the subjugation of natural forces for huunin weal 
there is no more interesting episode than that of the utilization of the 
unstable carbon compounds as fuels and illuminauts. Wood and vari- 
ous woody plants have been used as fuel, and animal fats and vegetal 
oils as illuminauts from time immemorial; and there is scarcely a 
savage tribe to which they are unknown. The advance from the use 
of wood and charcoal to the burning of niiner;il coals was an easy one, 
and was probably made gradually and independently in many centers 
both during historic and prehistoric time. The last step in the utiliza- 
tion of potential energy stored up in mineral substances was fiir longer 
and was taken within our own memory ; and, in conse<|uence of the 
ready communication of recent years between distant lands, was taken 
in many parts of the world at about the same time. It is true that

natnral-jjas vents were known to and were for ages venerated by the 
lire- worshipers, wliose cult tbey inspired ; it is also true that springs 
of mineral oil Tiave been known from history's dawn, and tliat the oil 
was utilized sometimes as fuel or ilhiminant, though more commonly 
as a medicine or lubricant ; and it is equally true that natural oils and 
tars were extracted by primitive means and used for primitive pur- 
poses by barbarous Oriental peoples long before their fame spread to 
the Occident; but it is only within a few years that these natural 
products have been utilized so extensively as to materially modify the 
course of human progress. 

Fa)i2)assu with the industrial development accompanying the utili- 
zation of rock gas, geologic science made an unparalleled stride within 
a few months. During the last thirty years Hunt, ISewberry, Peck- 
ham, I;eslie, and several other geologists in this country, and Biuney, 
Coquand, Daubree, Lartet, and others abroad have indeed made im- 
portant contributions to our knowledge concerning the constitution and 
origin of petrolenm and its associates; and the exploitation of the 
Pennsylvania-New York fields afforded valuable additional data relat- 
ing to these minerals. Nearly four years ago Prof. I. C. White enun- 
ciated and vigorously maintained the theory — now recognized as a 
fundamental law in gas prognostication — that gas, oil, and brine are 
accumulated in the order of their weight within inverted basins and 
troughs formed by flexure of the rocky strata. The importance of 
these contributions to our knowledge of the lighter bitumens must not 
be under-estimated; yet when exploitation for gas began in Ohio in 
188G, the geologist literally sat at the feec of the prospecter gathering 
such crumbs as fell from his hands, and found himself utterly unable 
either to guide eitbrts or predict results. Less than two years later the 
laws governing the distribution and accumulation of gas and oil were 
80 fully developed that the rock-gas problem claimed a solution as sat- 
isfactory as that of the well-known artesian water problem ; andtoday 
the geologist predicts the success or failure of a prospect bore for gas 
or oil about as readily and reliably as he can prognosticate artesian 
water, or coal. Greater advance was probably never before made in so 
limited time in any economically important branch of knowledge. The 
solution of the ])roblem of rock gas and petroleum marks an era iu 
science no less than in industry. Vast sums of money, reaching some- 
times into the millions, were spent by prospecters in gathering data; 
but the credit for the solution of the problem belongs chiefly to three 
individuals— I. C. White, of the University of AVest Virginia; Edward 
Orton, State geologist of Ohio; and A. J. Phinney, a practicing physi- 
cian and amateur geologist of Muncie, Indiana. 

GLACIATION. 

The general tcMidency of glaciation is to obliterate surface irregularity 
both by grinding down elevations and by filling uj) depressions, and 
thus to sui)plement hydric gradation ; but glaciation may also acceut- 



254 KECOKD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

iiate pre-existing irregularities of surface, certainly by nioraine-build- 
iug and probably by basin-cutting, aud must therefore be set apart as a 
unique agent in tbe modificHtion of tbe external configuration of the 
globe. The study of living glaciers was commenced many years ago by 
reasou of the novelty of the subject and the paradoxical behavior of an 
apparently rigid substance when accumulated in large mass ; but it was 
soon ascertained that glaciers are among the most potent of the geologic 
ageucies, and during recent years they have been studied chiefly with 
the object of interpreting the frequently obscure records of glaciation 
during past ages. 

Among the most important researches ui^on modern glaciers made 
during recent years are those of Hoist upon the great mer de glace of 
central Greenland, which have recently been summarized by Lindahl.* 
These researches are of special value to students of the glacial phenom- 
ena of America, since a considerable part of the mer de glace of Green- 
land apparently occupies plains comparable in general features with 
those of the Upper Mississippi Valley and the valley of the Great Lakes, 
while most of the glaciers hitherto studied are constricted ice streams 
flowing in mountain-bound valleys, whose behavior is determined 
largely by the conditions these valleys impose. In the mountainous 
parts of Greenland, as in the Alps and the northern Kockies the ice 
is indeed crevasse- torn, diversified by bowlders and other debris de- 
rived from projecting mountain tops, and sometimes broken by moulins, 
into which small streams cascade ; but over the plains the ice is gener- 
ally continuous, and free from rocky or earthy superficial deposits (other 
than the kryokouite which has so long puzzled students of Greenland 
geology), though sometimes intersected by considerable superglacial 
streams. Kryokonite was collected in considerable quantity by Hoist, 
carefully examined, and found to contain nothing but the ordinary com- 
l)onents of non-eruptive crystalline rocks in finely comminuted condi- 
tion — quartz, orthoclase, plagioclase, two or three varieties of mica, horn- 
blende, garnet, magnetite, and doubtful traces of titanite and epidote; 
but no metallic iron, nor the slightest trace of augite, olivine, or glass 
were found. In short, the chemical composition and mechanical consti- 
tution or kryokonite of Greenland is almost exactly identical with that 
of the loess so extensively developed in aud along the flanks of glaciated 
regions generally. Hoist's observations agree exactly with the conclu- 
sion previously reached by most American students of the loess, i. e., 
it is the finest flour of tbe ice-mill, which was swept into the glacial 
streams, and slowly deposited in rivers, lakes, and morasses as the flow 
became sluggish or ceased. 

Another notable study of living glaciers has been made by G. F. 
Wright about Glacier Bay, in sonthern Alaska. t The observations

upon the rate of tiow of Muir glacier, which emboiicbes into the liead 
of the bay, are particularly interesting. The cross-section of the ice 
stream is about 3,o00,(K)0 square feet (5y()00 feet wide by about 700 feet 
deep), and the mean flow is about 40 feet i)er day (70 feet in the cen- 
ter and 10 feet near the margin) in the month of August. The Muir 
glacier is uow retreating, but it has evidently oscillated considerably 
during recent times, and in some of its advances it has encroached upon 
and buried beneath its ground moraine and aqueoglacial deposits, 
whole forests of full grown trees, whose remains occasionally appear 
about the shores of the bay. 

It was an early notion that during glacial times great ice-caps formed 
about the poles and extended far toward the equator; and during one 
stage in the development of geologic science mathematicians sought to 
compute the effects of these hypothetic ice-caps, first, ui)on the volume 
of the oceans from which thej' were drawn, second, upon the isostatic 
terrestrial crust on which they were heaped, and third, upon the cen- 
ter of gravity of the earth as a whole. The students of more recent 
years have, however, settled down to the more temperate conviction 
that great polar icecaps never existed, and that during the glacial pe- 
riod the ice Howed radially from certain "centers of dispersion" (so 
called by Lyell). This view has recently rec.eived strong support from 
a new quarter: Within the last decade the Canadian geologists have 
shown that the striai which form the unmistakable trail of glaciers ex- 
tend from the Laurentide plateau southwesterly toward Lake Superior 
and the Ked River, westerly toward Lake Winnipeg, and northerly and 
even northeasterly toward Hudson's Strait,* proving that these high- 
lauds were the center of dispersion for the mer de glace by which 
northeastern United States was overflowed. These Canadian obser- 
vatiouis nave continued until within the last year or two, and have set- 
tled forever the fate of the ice-cap hypothesis. During the past two 
years, too, parallel observations have been made in the northwestern 
part of the American continent: G. M. Dawson and other ofticers of the 
Geological Survey of Canada have ascertained that the stria? of the 
Mackenzie Valley extend in northerly directions, proving that the north- 
ern Rockies also formed an independent center of ice dispersion, t Daw- 
son's publication upon the glacial phenomena of Canada is of special 
interest to American geologists in that it contains definite recognition 
o" the glacial theory, essentially in the form long held in America but 
rejecLod in Canada. 

The variouK American observations upon glacial strife have just been 
assembled, gri^phically depicted upon a remarkably instructive nuip, 
and discussed at length by the foremost living authority upon glacial

matters, rresident Ciiainberlin.* These Amerieau observations agree 
with those made on the other side of the northern lakes and the forty- 
ninth parallel; and it is now possible to map approximately the area 
glaciated during the Pleistocene, and to represent moreover the form 
and direction of movement of each i)rincipal lobe and tongue of the 
Mer de Glace during some i)ei'it>d of its existence. 

The last-named geologist has also recently described the phenomena 
of the Driftless area of the Upper Mississippi — a tract of over 15,000 
square miles, which was completely encompassed, though never over- 
swept, by the ice, and atone time partly or whollj^ submerged beneath 
the waters of an ice-bound lake; and from moraines, aciueo-glacial grav- 
els, and other products of the combined action of water and ice found 
about the perii^hery of the tract, he has deduced a history of the Pleisto- 
cene more extended and refined than any previously recorded. The 
epochs in this histoi-y are: (1) The Transition Epoch, not yet satisfac- 
torily distinguished from the Pliocene ; (2) the Earlier Glacial Epoch, 
comj)rising an episode of glaciation, an episode of deglaciation and veg- 
etal accumulation, and a second episode of glaciation accompanied by 
deposition of the loess; (3) the Chief Interglacial Epoch, with vegetal 
accumulation, etc.; (4) the Later Glacial Epoch, comprising at least 
three episodes of glaciation and moraine-building and two of deglacia- 
tion and vegetal accumulation; (5) the Champlain Epoch of. marine 
and lacustral sedimentation ; and (G) the Terrace Epoch, which grad- 
uates into the present, t 

The history of the Pleistocene and of its relations to the Tertiary has 
recently been read in a slightly difl'erent way from a different series of 
deposits (including the Columbia formation) by McGee: The geologic 
history recorded in the Columbia deposits and terraces and in the ero- 
sion and alteration which both have suffered is almost wholly sui)ple- 
mentary to that read by most geologists in the later glacial deposits, 
and multiplies many times the length of the Pleistocene as commonly 
conceived. Collectively the two series of deposits indicate that the 
Pleistocene consisted of two, and only two, great epochs of cold (the 
later comprising two or more sub-epochs) ; that these epochs were sep- 
arated by an interval three, five, or ten times as long as the post-glacial 
interval ; that the earlier cold endured much the longer; that the ear- 
lier cold was the less intense, and the resulting ice sheet stopped short 
(in the Atlantic slope) of the limit reached by the later; that the ear- 
lier glaciation was accompanied by much the greater submergence, ex- 
ceeding 400 feet at the mouth of the Hudson and extending 500 miles 
southward, while that of the later reached but a tithe of that depth or 
southing; and that during the long interglacial interval the condition 
of land and sea was much as at present. |

GEOLOGY. 257 

There is no subject in geology of wider popular and scientific interest 
than that of the relation between human chronology and geologic his- 
tory, and for two generations geologists have sought to determine tlie 
remoteness of the latest episode of geology — the last ice invasion — in 
terms of written history. Up to about a dozen years ago the current 
estimates of the duration of the post-glacial epoch generally ran from 
100,000 to 150,000 or 200,000 years; but about that time a number of 
American geologists began to make shorter estimates, based on new 
data, generally ranging from five or six thousand to ten or fifteen 
thousand years ; and since that time the one hundred thousand year 
and the ten thousand year estimates for the post-glacial period have 
both had their advocates, though of late the ten thousand year men 
have been in the ascendant. The chronometers were various, and many 
of them manifestly unreliable. Probably the most reliable of them all 
is that afforded by the gorge of the Mississippi between Fort Snelling 
and St. Anthony's Falls, in Minnesota, to which attention was directed 
several years ago by N. H. Winchell. The gorge is walled by the fria- 
ble St. Peter sandstone and a thin cap of firm Trenton limestone by 
which the sandstone is protected above, and the relations of the gorge 
to the adjacent glacial deposit are such as to jirove that it was exca- 
vated by the retrogression of the falls from the present confluence of 
the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers at Fort Snelling to their present 
position. This distance is about 8 miles. Now the gorge was first vis- 
ited and mapped by Henneijin in 1680 ; the position was again recorded 
by Carver in 1756, by Pike in 1805, by Long in 1817, by Keating in 
1823, by Featherstonehaugh in 1835, and by engineers of the U. S. Army 
in 1856; while the present position is known and comparison of the 
several maps indicate the rate of retrogression of the falls during the 
two hundred and seven years between 1680 and the time of the latest 
survey. If this rate be assumed to have been constant from the close 
of the glacial period to the present, the entire period covered by the 
retrogression was about eight thousand years.* This agrees with Gil- 
bert's j)rimary estimate of the period of excavation of the Niagara 
gorge. 

One of the most interesting and important lines of investigation in 
glacial geology undertaken within recent years is that so successfully 
pursued byChamberlin upon the terminal moraines built by the Pleis- 
tocene ice sheet during certain stages of its existence. The same phe- 
nomena have also been studied in this country by Ui)ham, Cook, 
Wright, Lewis, Salisbury, Todd, Leverett, and others, and the number, 
extent, and significance in glacial geology of the American moraines 
have been brought out in an eminently satisfactory manner by these 
students.

258 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

It has been a constant surprise to American glacialists that parallel 
phenomena were not recorded by the geologists of Europe ; and it was 
a source of something more than surprise to European geologists that 
the Americans should find so remarkable phenomena in one of two re- 
gions of practically identical Pleistocene history, while none such were 
found in the other. So one of the most interestiug events of the last 
year to American and European glacialists is the discovery of several 
well-developed terminal moraines in north Germany by the American 
geologist Salisbury during a visit to that country,* These moraines 
agree in all leading characteristics with those of this country ; and the 
discovery will unquestionably open a new field of research, and a new 
vista opening iuto the past history of the world in Europe, as the ear- 
lier discovery did a decade past for this country. 

Among the results of the detailed work of American glacialists dur- 
ing the last decade is the discovery that the great mer de glace of the 
Pleistocene was not a homogeneous and uniform ice field moving in the 
same direction in all its parts, but rather a series of great tongue-like 
lobes extending in dilferent directions and to various lengths upon the 
interior plains of North America j and some of the most interesting 
lines of investigation of glacial phenomena pursued byChamberlin and 
his contemporaries relate to the forms, positions, and inter-relatious of 
these lobes, and to their connection with the system of terminal mo- 
raines extending from Long Island to Montana, to the drift sheet bor- 
dered by these moraines, and to the aqueoglacial deposits into which 
both moraines and drift sheets merge. Thus, during the last decade, 
glacial geology has passed far beyond that initial stage of segregation 
in which o' jective phenomena are simply assembled and described to 
form a basis of study, and well into that stage of differentiation which 
accompanies a wider growth of knowledge. 

One of the students of the American ice-lobes was Lewis, and when 
he visited Great Britain, two years ago, his practiced eye and trained 
judgment at once perceived evidences of similar lobation of the ice sheet 
which plowed over the British Isles during the Pleistocene. So in 
another way the seed of American thought has borne fruit in Europe 
and Eastern science has been stimulated by the introduction of West- 
ern methods, and another tittle of the intellectual debt of the new con- 
tinent to the old abated. 

r:6sume. 

Several important conceptions in geologic science have sprung iuto 
being in America during the past two years ; many old conceptions 
have been modified and extended ; and some conceptions hitherto di- 
verse have been brought iuto harmony ; and so, in a third way, knowl-

edge has been extended. A few of the leadiug events in the foregoing 
history of the growth of conception are wortliy of special distinction : 

First in importance, by reason of its broad philosophic bearing, must 
be mentioned the transition from a purely objective or empiric classifi- 
cation in geology to the more logical, simple, comprehensive, and nat- 
ural classification by processes or by fundamental principles and laws — 
a transition commenced some years since, but now so well advanced as 
to be a legitimate subject of permanent record. 

Second in importance must be ranked the birth of the New Geology, 
which interprets geologic history from the records of degradation as the 
old geology interpreted history from the records of deposition, and thus 
greatly extends the domain of the science. 

Next in importance must be placed the invention of a method of de- 
termining the depth of earthquake centers and the determination of 
the velocity of earthquake transmission, which together have not only 
revolutionized seismology and placed it upon a solid foundation, but 
have enlightened geologists as to the constitution of the sub-crust of 
the earth. These three steps in progress are epoch-marking, and the 
last in particular must be credited wholly to the biennial period just 
closed. 

Important place must be given to the recognition and definition of 
a great geologic group — the Algonkian — by which the known geologic 
column is greatly extended and known geologic history greatly ex- 
panded. Like this discovery in kind are the recognition of a sub-group 
of rocks corresponding to a part of the geologic column — the Lower 
Cretaceous — hitherto recognized in Europe, but not on the American 
continent, and the correct determination of the succession of the sub- 
ordinate divisions of the Silurian and Cambrian in the structurally 
complex and bitterly contested field beyond the Hudson. To the stu- 
dent of stratigraphy these events are epoch-marking. 

Turning now from the subject matter of the science and the growth 
of knowledge with respect to this subject matter, and toward the means 
by which the science is developed, another epoch-marking event ap- 
pears in the organization of the Geological Society of America, by 
which investigation will inevitably be stimulated and knowledge ad- 
vanced more rapidly than ever before ; and in the same category must 
be placed the establishment of a national geologic periodical, the Ameri- 
can Geologist. And the birth of State geologic surveys in Arkansas 
and Texas must also be mentioned. 

Many other notable steps have been taken with respect both to the 
means and the ends of geology; but even if there were none other these 
great strides would render the period 1887, 1888 memorable.

In another and more painful way the biennial period, and particu- 
larly the year 1888, is memorable ; for the mortality among geologists 
was unusual: 

James C. Booth, one time State geologist of Delaware, died at Philadelphia, March 
21, 1883, aged seventy -eight years. 

Albert D. Hager, once an assistant on the geological survey of New Hampshire, 
died at Chicago, July 29, 1888. 

Ferdinand V. Hayden, geologist and explorer, long director of the U. S. Geolog- 
ical and Geographical Survey of the Western Territories, died at Philadelphia, 
December 22, 1887, aged fifty-nine years. 

Roland Duer Irving, professor of geology in the State University of Wisconsin, 
and geologist on the U. S. Geological Survey, died at Madison, May 30, 1888, aged 
forty-five years. 

Henry Carvill Lewis, an active student of glacial phenomena on both sides of 
the Atlantic, one time a geologist on the second geological survey of Pennsyl- 
vania, died at Manchester, England, July 21, 1888, aged thirty-five years. 

Augustus R. McCutchen, since 1883 geologist and editing clerk of the State de- 
partment of agriculture of Georgia, born October 31, 1836, died at Atlanta, No- 
vember 20, 1887, aged fifty-one years. 

Amos H. Worthen, long State geologist of Illinois, died at Warsaw, May 6, 1888, 
aged seventy-five years. 

Charles E. Wright, State geologist of Michigan, died at Marquette, March 22, 
1888, aged forty- five years. 



KOKTH AMERICAN PALEONTOLOGY FOR 1887 AND 1888. 



By Henrt S. Williams. 



INTRODUCTION. 

In writing this report some modifications from the plan heretofore 
adopted have been made. The report attempts to consider only such 
works as refer to the Paleontology of North America. It has been 
found impossible in the present state of the science to classify the lit- 
erature on biological lines entirely, as is done in the excellent Annuaire 
G6ologique of Carez and Douvill6 (22). I have consulted several re- 
ports of a similar nature, from which I have adopted some suggestions. 
Among these are the previous reports of Mr. Marcou (156, 157), the 
geological record by Messrs. Whitaker and Dalton (277), by Messrs. 
Topley and Sherborn (244), Bulletin No. 44 of the TJ. S. Geological Sur- 
vey, by N, n. Darton (60) ; Les Progr^s de la Geologic, by M. Margerie 
(158) ; the Annuaire Geologique of Carez and Douvill6 (22), and the 
preceding volumes of the same work by Dr. Dagincourt (57) ; the Neues 
Jahrbuch of Messrs. Baur, Dames, anil Liebische (11). 

One feature I have added which has not been attempted by any of 
these publications so far as I have ascertained. I have quoted the names 
of new species and genera proposed in the various publications, and in 
each case have noted the page and, wherever illustrations have been 
given, the number of the plate and figure, in order that the report may 
bring before working paleontologists a list of the new species which 
can be referred to when the original publications are not accessible. 

The reviews of the various publications have been necessarily brief, 
and are printed separately from the bibliographical list. The contents 
are arranged in the following order: 



General Paleontology : 
Cambrian. 

Silurian, lower and upper. 
Devonian.

This arrangement has been found necessary because the publications, 
as before stated, are not capable of classification on purely biological 
lines. So long as it is necessary for the paleontologist to report upon all 
the collections obtained in the course of a reconnaissance, or during 
the year's work of a geological survey, as means of defiuing the strati- 
graphical divisions of geology, fossils of all kinds are liable to be con- 
sidered in the same treatise, and it is onlj^ where specialists take up the 
consideration of the fossils in their biological grouping, that we have a 
literature differentiated in this way. Some works will be referred to 
the biological sections which are not thorough treatises from the biolog- 
ical point of view, while others are placed in the geological sections be- 
cause the treatment is confined to the fossils of one system or to the 
study of the characteristics of the fossils as they appear in some partic- 
ular zone. 

THE CAMBRIAN. 

N. S. Shaler (23G), and again in conjunction with August F. Foerste 
(237), has discussed the geology and the fauna of the Cambrain district 
of North Attleborough and Bristol County, Massachusetts. The fol- 
lowing species are described as new : 

Obolella? p. 27, pi. i, f.2. 

LamtlUhrancli f p. 28, i>l. i, f. 5. 

Stenotheca curvirosira, p. 30, pi. i, f. 8. 

rieurotomaria (Iia})histoma) attlehoretisis.]}. 30, pi. ii, f. 11. 

Hyolithea quadricosiatus, p. 31, pi. ii, f. 15. 

Salierella curvaUis, p. 34, pi. ii, f. 22. 

Microdiscus belli-marginatus, p. 35, pi. ii, f. 19. 

Paradoxides walcoUi, p. 3G, pi. ii, f. 12. The author adds " Paradoxides tenellus, 
Billings, is in size like this species, but very distinct. It is interesting to 
find a Paradoxides in the Olenellus Cambrian, since its occurrence there 
diminishes the importance of the Paradoxides Cambrian as a Paradoxides 
division." 

Ptyclioparia mucronatus, p. 37, pi. ii, f. 21. 

Ptyclioparia attlehorevsia, p. 39, pi. ii, f. 14. 

C. D. Walcott (258) discusses the age of the roofing slate of Gran- 
ville, Washington County, New York. The thin-bedded limestones, im- 
bedded in the gray and purple slates of Middle Granville, have yielded 
fossils which the author identifies with species of the Olenellus or Geor- 
gian fauna of the Cambrian. The red slates, in a note, are said to be 
of the Hudson Eiver formation. In a second paper (265) the same author 



PALEONTOLOGY. 263 

presents an imi)ortant revision of former views in regard to tlie order of 
succession of the Cambrian faunas of North America. The discovery 
of an unbroken section in Manuel's Brook, Conception Bay, Newfound- 
land, extending from the Arch?ean Gneiss upward through the Olenellus 
and to the Paradoxides fauna, confirms the order for these faunas pre- 
viously recognized in Sweden. The author announces the following 
revised classification of the Cambrian, showing this to be the true order 
of succession of the several terranes of the Cambrian in North America: 

(1) Lower Cambrian (Georgia, Prospect, Terra Nova terranes) with 
the Olenellus fauna ; (2) Middle Cambrian (St. John, Avalan and Brain- 
tree terranes) with the Paradoxides fauna ; (3) Upper Cambrian (Pots- 
dam, Knox, Ton to, Belle Isle, etc., terranes) with the Diceliocephalus or 
Olenellus fauna. This article is an abstract of remarks made by the 
author before the International Geological Congress in London, in the 
course of discussion on the Cambrian system, on September 18, 1888. 

E. P. Whitfield (298) records the discovery of fossils from the Birds- 
eye limestone at Fort Cassin, Vermont, on the eastern shore of Lake 
Champlain. The paper is an extract from Bulletin No. 8, of the Ameri- 
can Museum of Natural History, not yet published. 

C. Rominger (228) describes as new species certain fossils from Mount 
Stephens, Northwest Territory of Canada, as follows.* 

Ogygia klotzi, p. 12, pi. i, f. 1. 

Ogygia serraia, p. 13, pi. i, f. 2, 2a. 

Embolimus spuiosa (gen. et sp. nor.), p. 15, pi. i, f. 3. 

EmboUmus rotundata, p. 16, pi. i, i. 4, 5. 

Conocephalites cordillerce, p. 17, pi. i,. f. 7. 

He also recognizes the forms Monocephalus salteri, Bill., Bathyurus, 
Agnostus, Obolella, and a Theca resembling T. primordialis^ Hall. Ba- 
thyurus .^, p. 18, pi. I, f. 8. Agnostus ?, p. 18, pi. i, f. 1 (compare A. integer j 
Barr). 

Mr. Walcotc (264) criticises this paper, and Mr. Rominger replies to 
the criticism in the American Geologist, vol. i, pp. 356-359. (See also 
note, Am. Geol., vol. i, p. 61.) 

In the article by C. D. Walcott (264) an account is given of fossils 
derived from the same locality as that from which Mr. Rominger's fos- 
sils came. Mr. Walcott compares the species with the Nevada fauna of 
the Cambrian, the order of sequence of which is already known, and 
from his comparison concludes that " the Mount Stevens fiiuna should 
be referred to about the horizon of the upper portion of the Middle Cam- 
brian fauna." (This determination is prior to Mr. Walcott's discov- 
eries injNewfoundland). (See 265.) Of the new genus and five new spe- 
cies described by Mr. Rominger, Mr. Walcott shows that the name ^>»- 
6o?t?»MS is preoccupied by Westwood; that EmhoUmus »pi7iosa, Mainin- 
ger, 1887, was previously described as Olenoides spinosus by Walcott in 
1886, (Bull. U. S. Geol. Survey, No. 30, p. 184, pi. xxv, f. 6), and is 
therefore a synonym, and that Embolimus rotundata, Rominger, 1887, 



264 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

is identical with his species Bathyuriscus Howelli of tbe same Bulletin 
(p. 216, pi. XXX, f. 2, 2rt), and is also a synonym. The species Ole- 
noides spinosus was recognized i)reviously as geuerically distinct from 
Olenoides, and Mr. Walcott therefore proposes (p. 1G8) the name Za- 
canthoides (gen. nov.) for this and congeneric species. By comparison 
of specimens he also found that Rominger's Ogi/gia scrrata is a synoym 
for Olenoides Nevadensis, Meek, aud "that (Jonocephalites CordUlerce 
Horn. = Ftychoparia Cordillera) Roin., sp , and Ogygia f f Klotzi Rora. 
are new to the previously known Cambrian fauna." 

W. B. Dwight (7G, 77, 78) announces the discovery of the Olenellus 
fauna of the Cambrian in the Wappinger Valley limestone of Dutchess 
County, New York. 

Henry Hicks (KH)), in the Geological Magazine, reviews the recent 
work done by C. D. Walcott and G. F. Matthew in the study of the 
faunas of the Cambrian rocks of North America. 

Charles Lap worth (144) jjublishes evidence of the presence of the 
lower or Olenellus fauna in Shropshire, England, and gives tables of 
European series to parallel the American tables of the faunas of the 
Cambrian prepared by Mr. Walcott. 

G. F. Matthew has contributed a number of interesting papers in re- 
gard to the Paleontology of the Cambrian (167,169,170,171,172,173, 
174, 175). The subjects of the papers published in the American Jour- 
nal of Science (171) and in the Canadian Record of Science (169) are 
apparently more fully discussed in the pa])er (167) which appears in the 
Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada for 1887. In these va- 
rious papers the author discusses the discovery- and the chaiacters of a 
large Trilobite which is described as new (in the Am. Jour. Sci., vol. 
XXXIII, p. 389) under the name Paradoxides regina, from Baud Ic, St. 
John group, St. John, New Brunswick. This species is figured of the 
natural size in the Transactions of the Royal Society ; a small cut illus- 
trates it in the American Journal article. This is said to be the largest 
Paradoxides at present known. Its size and that of other large Trilo- 
bites are given in the Royal Society paper, and this one is estimated to be 
45 by 35 centimeters in length and width. The front part of the gla- 
bella is wanting in the specimen. 

In the first part of this article (173) the author gives reasons for the 
opinion that the tracks observed in the oldest Cambrian rocks of Swe- 
den, and called by Dr. Otto Torell Arenicolites gigas, and afterwards 
changed to Psammiclmites gigas, which are also found in the Acadian 
rocks, are tracks of a gigantic marine worm. 

In the latter part of this paper the author tabulates the Trilobites of 
the first stage of the Acadian series, and indicates their relationship to 
each other, and the geological position and range of each species. These 
Trilobites are classified in four groups; the iirst, Agnostus and 3Iicro- 
discus — eyeless and with short thorax ; second, Gonocorypliinoj — eyeless 
and with long thorax ; third, Ptychoparidcv and Ellipsocephalidce — the 



PALEONTOLOGY. 265 

smaller forms with eyes ; fourth, the Paradoxides. This table is found 
also in the Koyal Society paper (107). 

In the paper (1C9) in tlie Canadian Record of Science the author dis- 
cusses the characters of Pti/choparidfc and ElUpsocephalidw, which are 
dwelt upon more at length in the paper,.above referred to, in the Trans- 
actions of the Royal Society. From the study of the head-shield of the 
young of several genera, the author concludes that they have the fol- 
lowing relative rank to each other, those which show the more primi- 
tive features coming first, viz: (I) WlijJsocephalia, (2) AgrauloSy (3) 
LiostractiSy (4) Ptychoparia, (5) SoJenopleura. 

In the fuller paper in the Transactions of the Royal Society (167) the 
author describes the following species : 

Paradoxides regina, p. 119, pl.iii (nat. size). 
EUipsocejyhalnfi, sp. ? p. 129, pi. ii, f. 8 a-c. 
Agraulos {?) Whitfieldianus, p. 130, pi. ii, f. 1 a-f. 

var. compresna, p. 131, pi. i, f. 1 g-i. 
Strenuella (f ) HaJUana, p. 132, pi. i, f. 2 a-m. 
Solenopleura Acadica, var. elongata, p. 159, pi. ii, f. G. 

Plates i and ii illustrate series of young forms of the following gen- 
era : Agraulos, Liostraous, Ptychoparia,, Solenopleura, and Ellipsocepha- 
lus. 

The tabulation of the trilobites of the acadian is given as in the 
paper (173) above referred to, and the author separates Microdiscus from 
Agnostus, considering the former to be in advance, in degree of develop- 
ment, of Agnoatus, to present more variations of form, and to possess 
a greater range of variability in the number of rings in the axis of the 
pygidiura. The third and fourth groups sliow a cbange in the eye lobe; 
the fourth group completes this change earlier in its development than 
does the other. The granulated test is regarded as indicative of the 
earlier species of Paradoxides. The author remarks upon t he very great 
importantance of the early stages of Agraiilos, Liostrams, and SoUno- 
pleura, "as showing the plastic condition of the organism in the initial 
metamorphoses. One has only to note in the series of embryonic and 
larval forms how different the embryos are from the adult; and yet to 
observe also how soon the generic and even the specific types become 
visible in the larval head shield, to be satisfied that the main potentiality 
of development is in the embryo and the embryonic stages of the 
organism." 

The period 1887 and 1888 is notable for the accumulation and clear 
presentation of facts to show the impropriety of the retention in our 
geological nomenclature of the name "Taconic system" of Emmons. 

The discusion of the subject has been continued for half a century, 
and inany of the ablest geologists of the country have been engaged in 
it, starting witli Messrs. Dewey, Eaton, and Emmons. It was origi- 
nally proposed by Emmons as a subdivision including the rocks lying 
below the " Champlain Division " of the "New York system" and above 
the Primordial rocks. Messrs. II. D. Rogers, E. Hitchcock, Mather, 



266 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

James Hall, VaDuxem, Huut, Marcou, Barrande, and Logan were the 
chief dispntauts in the early part of the discussion, and in its later 
stages the more prominent participants were Dana, Billings, Hall, Hunt, 
Hitchcock, W. B. Dwight, Dale, Bishop, Ford, C. D. Walcott, with a 
number of other writers, who as advocates or opponents, have defended 
or opposed those more immediately engaged in the investigations. 

The original idea was the erection of a new system stratigraj)hically 
anterior to the then prominent " New York system" (1842), and at first 
fossils did not enter into the consideration, but the character and the 
stratigraphical position of the rocks were alone considered, the suppo- 
sition being that the" Taconic system " was an unfossiliferous series 
of rocks lying above the Primordial, but below the fossiliferons PalfEo- 
zoic rocks. Early in the discussion fossils were discovered, which caused 
the"Taconic system" to come into competition with the " Cambrian 
system" of Sedgwick, but it was not until comparatively recently that 
the rocks of the so-called " Taconic system " were known to contain 
fossils of the Lower Silurian or " Champlain Division " of the early 
New York geologists. The investigations of the last few years, mainly 
by the discovery of fossils, have conclusively shown that the rocks in- 
cluded in the "Taconic system " of Emmons are stratigraphically j^artly 
anterior but in a large measure newer than the Potsdam sandstone ; 
that they are disturbed, metamorphosed, faulted, and do not constitute 
a continuous series of rocks, but several interrupted masses. The im- 
propriety of retaining the name has been elucidated by the evidence of 
fossils, by showing that the rocks called " Taconic " by Emmons do not 
constitute a geological system, as the term is applied by geologists, in 
that they are made up of rocks belonging to several geological horizons, 
separated by breaks in the series, and that " the system " as conceived 
by Emmons is not pre-Potsdam, but contains some rocks as much above 
as others are below that horizon. Hence, if the term " Taconic system " 
were to be adopted, if used in the original sense, it would not be ap- 
plicable to any other known series of rocks ; if modified to fit it to 
modern facts, it would not be applicable to the Taconic area. 

Although defended by strong advocates on the geological side, the 
settlement of the problem is due chiefly to pahieontology, and the pro- 
longed extension of the dispute has resulted from the absence of the 
palteontological evidence which has come to light chiefly through the 
investigations of Messrs. Dwight, Dana, Ford, Bishop, and Walcott. 

During the years 1887 and 1888 the following papers of a more or less 
paltBOutological nature were written upon this subject. Mr. J. P. Bishop 
(17) had shown in 1886 by fossils that the fossiliferons limestones occur- 
ring in Columbia County, on the western border of the Taconic slates, 
were of the age of the Hudson Eiver shales. 

C. D. Walcott (257, 260, 262) gives an account of the fossils discovered 
in the lowest quartzites, in the limestones,-aiid in the Upper Taconic of 
Emmons. 



PALEONTOLOGY. 267 

In the paper in the American Journal of Science (2G0) he describes 
tlie following new species characteristic of the fauna of the so-called 
" Taconic" of Emmons. 

Lingulella GranviUensis, p. 188, pi. i, f. 15-15c. 

Linnn7-ssonia Taconica, p. 189, pi, i, f. 18-18d. 

Oithis Salemeiisis, p. 190, pi. i, f. 17-17a, 

Uyolitltellufi micans, var. rugosa, n. var., p. 191, pi. i, f. 10. 

ModiolOpsis {11) 2>rlfica, p. 191, pi. i, f. 19. 

Lcpcrditla (J) dermatoides, p. 192, pi. i, f. 13-13a. 

AnstozoG rotundata, p. 193, pi. i, f. 9. 

Microdiscus connexus, p. 194, pi. i, f. 4-ib. 

Olenoides Fordi, p. 195, pi. i, f. 5-5&. 

Soleno2>Ieura (?) tiimida, p. 196, pL i, f. 2-2a. 

Ptychoparia Fitclii, p. 197, pi. i, f, 6. 

Ptychoparia (?) {snigciius ?) clavata, p. 198, pi. i, f. 3. 

In the "Lower Taconic" (262) he records the discovery of HyolHhes, 
Nothozoe Vermontana, and Olenellus Asax)1ioides in the quartzites, and 
Ilaclurea, MurcMsonia, and Baphistoma in the eastern limestone. 

Raphael Pumpellj" (223) communicates a note on the fossils of Little- 
ton, New Hampshire. These fossils were reported by T. Nelson Dale, 
and were determined by 0. D. Walcott and C. Rominger, by whom they 
were referred to the Niagara age, while Billings determined other fos- 
sils, derived from the same formations by C. H. Hitchcock, to be of 
Helderberg age. In a note in the American Journal, vol. xxxvi, p. 
255, it is stated that C. H. Hitchcock referred these fossils to the Ni- 
agara group. (See Whitfield, Amer. Journ. Sci., vol. xxv, p. 369.) 

In 1888 Mr. Walcott (262) and Professor Dana (59) showed the im- 
propriety of continuing the use of the name " Taconic system," and Mr. 
Marcou (154, 155) defended the usage of " Taconic." In the meeting of 
the International Congress at London the facts regarding the discovery 
of fossils of the faunas of the Lower Silurian appeared as conclusive 
argument against the recognition of the " Taconic System," and theterma 
" Cambrian," " Lower Silurian," and " Upper Silurian " were accei)ted 
for the three lower systems of the Palaiozoic. 

THE SILURIAN, LOWEB AND UPPER. 

Henry M. Ami has published several brief articles on the Paleontol- 
ogy of the Paleozoic rocks in Canada (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). In vol. i of 
the Ottawa Naturalist (3) the author refers to the occurrence of Sij)ho)io- 
treta Scotica, Davidson, in association with a fauna of the Utica forma- 
tion in a band of impure limestone on the banks of the Rideau River, 
near Ottawa. In the transactions of the Field Naturalists' Club (8) he 
gives further account of the Utica fossils from Rideau, and notes their 
position in the section which he examined along Crichton street. Sev- 
eral species are recorded as new to the locality, and two, marked as 
new species, are referred to Ambonychia and Mctoptoma. In the article 
in the Canadian Record of Science (9) he discusses the fossils from the 



268 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Utica formation at Point a Pic. No new species are named, but a rep- 
resentative of the genus iSiphonotreta is described in detail and com- 
pared with Siphonotreta Scotica of Davidson and S. micula, McCoy. 

T. W. Edwin Sowter (243) offers some notes on the Chazy formation 
at Aylmer, Province of Quebec. He proposes the following new forms, 
giving brief descriptions, but no specific names : 

Murehisonia n. ep., p. 13. , 

Euomplialus sp. ? p. 14. f 

Plcurotomaria ii. sp., p. 14. 
Pleurotomaria {Scalites) n. sp., p. 14. 
Metoptoma n. sp., p. 14. 

S. W. Ford (88) comments upon certain fossils discovered in Quebec. 
The fossils were sent the author by A. R. C Selwyn, director of the 
Canadian Survey, and the study of them indicates to the author a 
horizon equivalent to the "Levis" formation of the Canadian geolo- 
gists. 

Charles Lapworth (143,145) gives an account of some Graptolites dis- 
coN'ered in Kicking Horse Pass, Manitoba, British Columbia, and on 
the south side of the St. Lawrence and on the north shore of the island 
of Orleans, and from near Quebec. 

A. F. Foerste has added considerably to the list of species from the 
Paleozoic of Ohio. In the paper (80) in the Bulletin of Denison Uni- 
versity, vol. II (1887), the author has described the following species 
from the Clinton group of Ohio : 

Acidaspis Ortoni, p. 90, pi. viii, f. 1 (described and figured as Aeidaspis, vol. i, 

p. 101, pi. xiii, f, 23). 
Proetus determinatus, p. 91, pi. viii, f. 2, 3, 3a (= Bathyurus vol. i, p. 103, pi. 

xiv, f. 5.) 
Calymeve Vogdesi, p. 95, pi. viii, f. 12, 13, 14, 15, IG (= Calymene, vol. i, p. 109, 

pi. xiii, f. 24). 
Phacops 2)ulchcUus, p. 99, pi. viii, f. 4,20, 21 {= ArioveUus, vol.1, p. 114, pl,^xiv, 

f.3).

Dictyonema pertenuc, p. 107, pi. viii, f. 27 a-h. 
Dictyoncma scaJariforme, p. 108, pi. viii.f. 28, 29. 

In Part III of the same bulletin (81) he describes the Bryozoa [Poly- 
zoa] of the Clinton group of Ohio ; several genera and species are fig- 
ured and described, and the following new species are named, described, 
and figured: (In his nomenclature he has followed the classification of 
E. O. Ulrich.) 

Hemiirypa Ulrichi, p. 152, pi. xv, f . 2 ; pi. xvii, f. 2. 
Pachydictya emaciata, p. 162, pi. xv, f. 8; pi. xvii, f. 8,

In vol. Ill, Part ii (1888), of the same bulletin he publishes (84) some 
notes on the Paleozoic fossils, and describes the following new species : 
Lichas Halli, p. 118, pi. xiii, f. 4. 
Encrinurua Browning'i, ii. 122, pi. xiii, f. 7. 
Encrinurus Mitchelli, p. 124, pi. xiii, f. 2, 3, 20.

U. p. and Joseph F. James contribute an article (130) in the Journal 
Ciuciniiati Society of Natural History, on the Monticuliporoid Corals 
of the Cincinnati group, with a revision of the species. The work con- 
sists principally-of a critical re- arrangement of the species heretofore 
described, of which a great number have been described by E. O. 
Ulrich. The authors attempt to make no new species, and the only new 
form described is Monticulipora hospitalis, viir. neglecta (var. nov.), vol. 
XI, p. 27, pi. i, f. 3. 

F. J. H. Merrill (179) reports the discovery of fossils in a limestone 
on the Green Pond Mountain of New Jersey, which he identifies as 
belonging to a Lower Helderberg fauna. Eocks of the Paleozoic (from 
Oneida to Hamilton) epochs are recognized. 

Fred. H. Newell (200a) describes the following new species of Ni- 
agara Cephalopods from northern Indiana : 

GompUoceras JVahashenais, pp. 470-473, 3 wood-cuts. 
Gomphoceras linearis, pp. 473-475, 2. wood-cuts. 
Gomphoceras angustum, pp. 475-476, 1 wood-cut.

Hexameroceras cacabiformis, pp. 481-483, 3 wood-cuts. 
Ascoceras Indianensis, pp. 484-485, 4 wood-cuts. 

E. N. S. Eingueberg (225) reports the following new species from the 
Niagara shales of western New York : 

Buthotrepis gregaria, p. 131, pi. vii, f. 1. 
Inocaulis anastomatica, p. 131, pi. vii, f. 2. 
Bendrocrinus cehus, p. 1.32, pi. vii, f. 3.

Plumulites gracilissinius, p. 136, pi. vii, f. 8. 

In another paper (226) the same author gives lists of the species rec- 
ognized in the following zones, which he has studied. To these zones 
he applies the names the Niagara Transition group, the Niagara shales, 
and the Homocrinus band. 

The following species are described and figured by George B. Simp- 
son (24:0) in a paper entitled " Descriptions of new species of fossils from 
the Clinton, Lower Helderberg, Chemung, and Waverly groups, found 
in the collections of the Geological Survey of Pennsylvania," which was

THE DEVONIAN. 

Robert Bell (15) in his Eeport G of the Annual Report of the Geo- 
logical Survey of Canada for 188G, notes the occurrence of fossiliferous 
limestones in the valley of the At-ta-wa-pish-kat and Albany Rivers. 
These fossils were submitted to Prof. J. F. Whiteaves, the paleontolo- 
gist of the Survey, who identified them as indicating Devonian faunas 
(pp. 27, G-33, G). The species reported are mainly corals and brachio- 
pods; Mr. Whiteaves thinks them of a Lower Devonian horizon. No 
new species are defined. 

S. Calvin (21) records the fact of the appearance of a coral-bearing 
zone intercalated between two brachiopod zones in the Hamilton rocks 
in western Ontario, and remarks upon the different form assumed by 
the Spirifera mucronata of the first and third zones. The same author 
(20) describes a new genus and species of tubicolar Annelida from the 
Hamilton period, Roberts's Ferrj-, Iowa ; these are Streptindites (gen. 
uov.), p. 27, and S. acervulariw (sp. nov.), p. 27. No illustrations are 
given. 

J. M. Clarke (28) gives an account of the Annelid teeth from the De- 
vonian of Ontario County, New York. Twenty-nine specimens of these 
teeth are figured, twenty-two of which express varieties of form ap- 
pearing in the Black Shale of Naples, and are regarded as varieties 
of the form described by Hinde under the name of Polygnathus dubius. 
The other forms are referred to tlie genera Arahellltes, Frioniodus, 
{EnoniteSjSLndUnnicites. These forms have heretofore generally gone 
under the name of " Conodonts." 

James Hall (97) adds another volume to the valuable contributions 
to the paleontology of New York State. This volume (vi) contains the 
corals and Bryozoa [Polyzoa] from the Lower Helderberg, Upper Hel- 
derberg, and Hamilton groups. There are described one hundred and 
three species from the Lower Helderberg, one hundred and fifty-four 
from the Upper Helderberg, and ooe hundred and twenty-one from the

PALEONTOLOGY. 273 

. A valuable synopsis of the genera, occupying sixteen pages, has been 
prepared by Charles E. Beecher. The original drawings were all made 
by George B. Simpson, whose name appears on the title-page, and the 
author says (p. 10) that " credit is due him for the i)reparation of a large 
part of the specific descriptions." 

Prof. Charles Barrois (10) presents a review of the above volume in 
the "Anuales" of tbe "Soci^t6 Geologique du Nord." 

James Hall (98) published in 1888 another valuable contribution to 
the paleontology of New York State. Although many of tbe species 
figured have been described before, tbe new descriptions and diagnoses 
of the species, and better illustrations than have ever appeared before, 
will be of great value to the student of paleontology. One hundred 
and forty-four species of Crustacea are described and illustrated, ninety- 
seven of them Trilobites, the whole included under twenty-eight genera. 
Tbe author acknowledges the assistance of Mr. John M. Clarke "in the 
preparation of the matter for the press and in the critical study of the 
material." A useful synopsis of genera, occupying forty-four pages, pre- 
cedes the descriptive part of the work. The following new forms are 
described :

species were previously described, but not figured, in the Thirty-sixth 
Annual Eeport of the New York State Museum, 1884, and are here re- 
described and figured. Two new species from the Hamilton are de- 
scribed, one of which is figured ; two new species are from the Waverly

Samuel G. Williams (304) contributes a paper with the title " The 
Tully limestone, its distribution and its known fossils." The author 
offers a list of over a hundred species, the majority of which are com- 
mon in the Hamilton shales immediately below the Tully limestone. 
The indefinite notion the author has of the limits of the Tully limestone 
is showu by his statement on page 20, that the estimate of the thick- 
ness varies " according as one includes or excludes the impure mixed 
top and bottom portions." This easily explains the length of the list 
of " known " Tully species. The transition from the richly fossiliferous 
fauna of the upper layers of the Hamilton to the comparatively barren 
Tully limestone is so sharp that it is not safe to include even the species 
found in the shale adhering to the bottom of the heavy blocks as 
" known fossils" of the Tully fauna. 

C, S. Prosser (222) read an interesting paper before the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science on the U[)per Hamilton of 
Chenango and Otsego Counties ; the order and composition of the fau- 
nas of these rocks have been carefully studied by the author. 

Charles R. Keyes (135) describes the following two new fossils from 
the Devoniou of Iowa : 

Conocardium altum, p. 26, pi. xii, f. 4a, Ab, Iowa City, Iowa. 
Cyrtoceraa opimum, p. 26, pi. xii, f. 5, Johnsou County, Iowa. 



216 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Clement L. Webster (272-27(3) Las communicated several papers on 
tbe Paleontology of the Devonian rocks of Northern Iowa. Unfortu- 
nately be has named and published descriptions of several supposed new 
species. Among the species reported (270) as "known to occur in the 
Eockford shale and the rocks a few feet below" are 8pirifera disjuncta 
Sow. and Ehynclionella venu.stula, Hall. Having never before heard of 
the occurrence of these si)ecies in the Devonian of the interior, the 
writer requested a loan of the specimens so named; the author kindly 
sent specimens fo» examination of the former, which proved to be not 
Spirifera disjuncta, but the form which appears to be known in Iowa 
under the uume Spirifera Farryana, Hall, a form quite distinct from Sp. 
disjuncta, although associated with it in some beds in New York. This 
casts doubt upon the other identifications. The specific names pub- 
lished by the author with descriptions, but without illustrations, are as 
follows (all from the Eockford shales of Iowa, and all in tbe American 
Naturalist, vol. xxii) : 

Hhynchoiiella snhavuminala, p. 1015.

J. F. Whiteaves (291) gives a list of the fossils from the Hamilton for- 
mation of Ontario, and describes the following new species : 

Hoinocrinus crassus, p. 95, pi. 12, f. 2.

H. S. Williams (301) presents a paper in which the various types of 
the Devonian system in North America are classified and defined. This 
paper was read at the New York meeting of the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science, August, 1887, and is a part of tbe " Ee- 
port on tbe Upper Paleozoic (Devonic)," published by tbe American 
Committee of the International Congress of Geologists, and presented 
to the London session in September, 1888. The author shows that the 
rocks of the Devonian system jiresent at least four types of strati- 
graphical order and composition, and that the paleoutological history 
recorded in the four areas is distinct, both in the comi)Osition of the 
faunas as a whole and in their subdivisions into separate temporary 



PALEONTOLOGY. 277 

•faunas ; that in difi'erenl, regions the same order of sequence of genera 
and species in general takes place, but that for the Devonian system, 
at least, the stratigraphical lines of demarkation separating one tem- 
porary fauna from the next, are comparatively local and not uniform for 
different regions of America. 

The same author (302) gives an extended discussion, in Bulletin No. 41 
of the U". S. Geological Survey, of the fossil faunas of the Upper De- 
vonian of western New York. This paper is not merely a list of the 
species of the Upper Devonian, but the author attempts to ascertain, 
by a comparative study of the species and of the faunas of the succes- 
sive geological stages, the laws of variation or modification affecting 
the species and faunas in their passage upward through the series and 
in their relations to geographical distribution. Few new species are 
described, but frequent reference is made to the modifications expressed 
in the cliaracters of species as they are traced upwards in the rocks 
(historically), and from region to region during the same stage (geo- 
graphically). These variations are also expressed by the separate tab- 
ulation of the species forming the fauna of each fossiliferous zone. The 
following new forms are described and figured :

The name Spiraxis proposed by Professor Newberry (Ann. N. Y. Acad. 
Sc, vol. in, 1885, pp. 217-220, pi. xviii,) for a peculiar screw-like fossil 
occurring in the sandy deposits of the Upper Devonian, was observed 
to be preoccupied by 0. B. Adams, 1850, for a genus of Gasteropoda, 
and the author of the above paper (302) having occasion to record the 
occurrence of two species of the genus in the Wolf Creek conglomerate, 
proposes the name Prospiraxis as a substitute (p. 86) for the generic 
name of these peculiar fossils. 

TUE CARBONIFEROUS AND PERMIAN.

are published iu the Bulletiu of the Denisou University Laboratory of 
Science, aud consist of descriptions of the geology, outcrops, structure, 
etc., of the Waverly rocks of Licking County, and descriptions with 
figures of the forms of fossils discovered in the rocks. He has collected 
a valuable series of the Waverly fossils which the illustrations help to 
make familiar to scientists. He has described a large number of 
new species, and an examination of the descrii)tions and figures leads 
one to think that many of them might better have been called varieties 
of already described forms, or left without specific names until more 
perfect specimens were discovered and fuller comparisons made with 
already described species. The following are the new species described 
in volume ii, 1887:

Charles K. Koyes has added three papers (134, 136, 141) to the litera- 
ture of the Carboniferous. In the first, on the fauna of the Lower Coal 
Measures, three new species are described : 

Chonetes lawis, p. [8] 229, pi. xii, f. 3, a, 6. 
Plenrotomaria modesta, p. [17] 238, pi. xii, f. 2, a, h. 
Macrocheilus humilis, p. [18] 239, pi. xii, f. 1. 

F. A. Sampson (229) describes the Subcarboniferous series at Se- 
dalia, Missouri, and Lieut. A. W. Vodges (251) describes two new spe- 
cies from the same : 

PliiUipsia sampsoni, pp. 248, 249, and two wood-cuts, p. 249. 
Griffithides (?) sedaliensis, p. 249. 

In another paper (250) Lieutenant Vodges reviews the genera and 
species of North A merican Trilobites ; the following four genera are 
recognized : Proetus, Steininger ; Phillipsia, Portlock ; Griffithides, 
Portlock, and Bracliymetopsis, McCoy. The author gives a diagnosis 
of each genus and discusses the various species and synonymy, with 
their distribution in North America. The original description of the 
species is given in many cases, with a careful specific diagnosis for each 
species. Six species of Proetus, twelve species of Phillipsia, five species 
of Griffith ides, and one species of Brachymetopsis are recognized. The 
generic characters are illustrated in the plates. 

THE MESOZOIC. 

William B. Clark (27) finds evidence in the fossils discovered in Anne 
Arundel and Prince George Counties, Maryland, to establish the per- 
sistence of the Cretaceous strata across the State, from the Delaware 
line on the northeast to the Potomac Eiver on the southwest, and lists 
of the species with localities are given. The same author (24) remarks 
upon the discovery of an Arcestes (n. sp.), Arcestes rluvticus, p. 119, 
figured in a former paper (25), in the Rha^tic beds of the northern 
Tyrol. This is taken as evidence for regarding the Kha;tic as more 
closely allied with the Trias than with the Lias. The same author (26) 
presents lists of species collected from several localities in the southern 
counties of Maryland, representing the Eocene and Miocene faunas ; 
no new species are described. 

R. T. Hill has published three papers (108, 109, 110) of considerable 
value in expounding the knowledge of the geology of Texas, particu- 
larly of the Cretaceous system. The paper (110) on the Geology of 
the Cross-timbers contains a table (pp. 298-299) of a geological section 
of the Cretaceous across the State of Texas, in which are indicated the 
characteristic fossils of each zone. In another paper (109), on the 



282 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Texas section of the American Cretaceous, the author gives lists — of 
fossils of the upper divitJion of the Texas Cretaceous (pp. 294, 295), 
of the middle division of the Texas Cretaceous (pp. 297, 299), of the 
upper or Washita division of the Lower Cretaceous (pp. 302, 303), of the 
Fredericksbnrgh division (p. 305). The author notes the fact of an ap- 
parent continuity of interlocking faunas throughout the series, but 
with the exception of Gryphcea pitcheri, Mort., not a single species is 
known to pass from the Comanche series into the upper formations. 
He further observes that the fauna of the Comanche series presents 
closer resemblance to those of Europe and tropical America than to 
other Cretaceous faunas of the United States. 

Mr. W J McCee (177-178) contributes two papers, mainly strati- 
graphical and structural, on the formations of the Middle Atlantic 
slope ; no extended palteontological facts are given, but the author 
mentions occasionally the species characteristic of the formations. 

Eugene A. Smith, in conjunction with Lawrence C. Johnson (241), 
published a valuable contribution to the knowledge of the Tertiary and 
Cretaceous strata of Alabama. The bulletin deals mainly with geolog- 
ical facts, but there is frequent reference to the species- of fossils char- 
acterizing the strata discussed. 

C. A. White (278), commeutiug upon the age of the coal found in the 
region traversed by the Rio Grande, refers it to the age of the Laramie 
or Fox Hill formations. The same author (282) describes three new 
genera and three new species from the Cretaceous, which are as follows:

0. A. White (283) gives an account of the results of examinations of 
the Texas Cretaceous, with E. T. Hill as field assistant. The fossils 
have not been fully studied, but enough is done to make clear the rela- 
tions of the various deposits to those of other sections. The Comauohe 
series are older than any Cretaceous deposits exhibited in any other 
American section. A complete faunal break occurs at the top of the 
Comanche. The upper series may be satisfactorily correlated with 
Cretaceous formations of western and upper Missouri. 

C. A. White (285) has published a number of new species from South 
America, which, though not strictly appropriate to a list of North 
American Paljeontology, are compared with American species. The 
author has 3 new genera and 158 new species, divided as follows : Cou- 
chifera, 58; Gasteropoda, 73; Polyzoa, 1; CephaloiDoda, 9 ; Fresh-water 
Mollusca, 5; Echinodermata, 12. The same author (288) reports on the 
fossils from Hardin County, Iowa. These were examined by the author 
and found to possess close afi&nities with the Mollusca fauna of the Fox

Hills group. Two of them are ideutical with Fox Hills species. lAs- 
podesthes (?) haworthi (u. sp.) is described and figured (pp. 22'4-225). 
Another paper (287) discusses the Puget group of Washington Terri- 
toTj. Twelve species are recognized from these rocks, eight of which 
are regarded as new, and are named but not described. 
They are — 

Cyrena hrevldens. B. duhia. 

Corhicula WUlisi. rsamniohia ohscura. 

C. Pugeiensis. Sanyuinolana (?) caudata. 

Batissa Newherryi. Teredo Pugetensis. 

Study of the fossils leads the author to agree with J. S. Newberry 
and Bailey Willis as to the equivalency and probable contemporaneity 
of the Puget group with the Laramie. In another paper (286) Mr. 
White discusses the relation of the Laramie group to other and later 
formations and considers the greater jDart of the Laramie as of Creta- 
ceous age, the upper strata representing a gradual transition from the 
Cretaceous to the Tertiary period. 

J. F. Whitea\ es (292, 294, 295) contributes three papers on the Pa- 
Ireontology of the Mesozoic. 

The first (295), on some fossils from the Cretaceous and Laramie 
rocks of the Saskatchewan, is an appendi:^; to Mr. J. B.TyrrelPs report, 
and the following new species are described: 

Cyprina suhtrapeziformis, p. 155e. 
Solecurtus {Tagehts) occldentalis, p. 157e. 
Marteria lumidifrons, pp. 157e-158e. 
Hydatina parvnla, pp. 158e-1.59e. 
Palwastacua (?) ornatus, pp. 161e-162e. 

In the second paper (294), which is an appendix to G. M. Dawson's 
report, some Mesozoic fossils from British Columbia are described. 
The new species are as follows : 

Aulacoceras Charlottense, p. 109&, Triassio. 
Celiites (?) Fancouvereiisls, p. 1106, Triiissic. 
Placenticeras oceidentale, p. Il3h, Cretaceous.

R. P. Whitfield (297, 299) remarks upon the fossils of the New Jersey 
Cretaceous. lu the article in the American Naturalist (299) a synopsis 
of the number of species in each, zone of the Cretaceous rocks of New 
Jersey is given, and also an account of the number of New Jersey 
species occurring in the corresponding beds of other States. 

THE CENOZOIC. 

Aug. Heilprin (102) discusses the classification of the PostCretace- 
ous department. This is mainly a geological paper, but the author 
makes some timely remarks upon the value of faunas for determining 
chronology. He says: ''The absolute succession of equivalent faunas, 
or faunas of a practically identical facies, which has been demonstrated 
for the greater part of the world, clearly establishes the claims of the 
faunal element as the guide propre in the determination of chronology." 
In another paper (103) Mr. Heilprin presents additional lists of species 
of Miocene Mollusca of New Jersey, and the following new species are 
described : 

Murex SLilolwnsis, p. 404, no figure. 

Pleurotoma pseiidehurnea, p. 404, no figure. 

Triforis ierebrata, p. 405, no figure.

Mississippi and Alabama are given on p. 65. In the paper on the Mio- 
cene invertebrates from Virginia (185) the author i)resents a list of the 
smaller Mollusca identified in the sand adhering to the larger species, 
collected from the Miocene beds near Yorktown. The following new 
species are described :

• In the paper (18G) on the " Ui)i)er Tertiary Invertebrates from the 
west side of Chesapeake Bay," the author gives a list of twenty-five 
species discovered inside a hir<(e Balanus concavus Bronn ; one new 
species is described : Aligena shmyi, sp. nov.. p. 171, and wood cut. In 
the article (187) on the two books of Conrad on Tertiary shells, the 
author gives information in regard to imperfections which have ap- 
peared in various copies of T. A. Conrad's " Fossil Shells of the Tertiary 
Formations," and " Fossils of the Tertiary Formations." 

C. L. Webster (272) has written an article on the geology of Johnson 
County, at the close of which, p. 419, is given a list of eighteen species 
of land and freshwater shells, collected from the Loess of Johnson 
County by Prof. B. Shimek, of Iowa City, five of which are said not to 
occur as living forms in the county at the present time. 

B. Shimek (239) i)ublishes notes on the fossils of the Loess at Iowa 
City; a list of twenty -five species is given with comments, but no 
species are described.

William 11. Dall (58) publishes some interesting notes on the Geol- 
ogy of Florida, giving accounts of the results of explorations undertaken 
by iustruction of the Director of the U. S. Geological Purvey in 1885 
and 1887. The paper discusses the geological structure and strati- 
graphical sequence of deposits, and the author refers casually to the 
occurrence of species of fossils in the deposits studied. " In referring 
to the age of the deposits," he says, "while the old terms Miocene, 
Pliocene, etc., may be used for the sake of convenience, it must be 
clearly understood that, as at present defined, they are only of relative 
value and indicative at most of stratigraphical succession in a very 
limited sense. As determined by their invertebrate fauna, the Plio- 
cene, for instance, of South Europe, is probably older than the strata 
called Pliocene in America ; at all events it is highly improbable that 
they represent synchronous geological epochs. The method of determ- 
ining which name should be used for a particular division of the TerMary, 
by taking percentages of the supposed extinct species, is, on the face 
of it, impracticable, illogical, and misleading. Our knowledge of the 
Tertiary in America is still so fragmentary and imperfect as to render 
a synchronic subdivision of all the Post-Cretaceous strata impossible 
for the present." 

L. C. Johnson (132) speaks upon the structure of Florida. Several 
fossils are identified, indicating Eocene age for the underlying rock (of 
the Vicksburg group) ; this is covered in places by the "Nummulitic 
limestone," and upon this rest the Miocene and more recent rocks. 

J. G. Cooper (35, 36) has published lists of California shells in the 
Proceedings and Bulletins of the California Academy of Science, and 
the Annual Report of the State Mineralogist of California. 

Lester F. Ward (2G9) presents the evidence as to the age of the Poto- 
mac formation derived from the study of the work of Professor Fon- 
taine upon this remarkable dora. He tabulates the species, comparing 
them with those known and described from other deposits whose geo- 
logical position is well known, and '' from this exhibit it appears that 
no Jurassic species occurs in the Potomac formation, although it con- 



288 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

tains a large number of strongly Jurassic types. The Wealden fur- 
nished the largest number of identical species, the Cenomanian next, 
and the Urgoniaij next. Of allied species, although the largest num- 
ber occurs in the Oolite, the Cenomanian, Urgonian, and Wealden each 
furnish many. Taking the identical species, and considering the Weal- 
den as Cretaceous, the flora would appear to be decidedly Cretace- 
ous, but if this showing is considered in the light the Jurassic types 
cast upon it, it is difficult to believe it to be higher than Wealden or 
Neocomian." But he says at the close that in case the stratigraphical 
and animal remains should require such reference, "the plants do not 
present any serious obstacle to reference of the Potomac formation to 
the Jurassic." 

C. A. White (280) publishes a very interesting article on the inter- 
relation of contemporaneous fossil faunas and floras, an addition to the 
literature already contributed by him in this line. The present paper 
considers the relationship between the invertebrate faunas and floras 
and the vertebrate faunas preserved in the range of deposits from the 
Laramie group to the Bridger, inclusive. He considers that sedimenta- 
tion was continuous during the whole time, and that there was for the 
whole time, and within the region where the Laramie and Bridger de- 
posits were being made, an unbroken continuity of invertebrate and 
plant life. "If these conditions actually existed we must necessarily 
conclude that the Puerco and Wasatch mammalian ftiunas were both 
suddenly and independently introduced into the region where they are 
now found from some other region where they previously existed," and 
he concludes that "the Wasatch fauna existed somewhere contempora- 
neously with the Puerco mammalia from which it differs so much, and also 
contemporaneously with the Laramie dinosaurs, from which it differs far 
more widely." In the latter part of the paper the author presents rea- 
sons for considering it necessary to study the history of continental and 
fresh- water faunas and floras distinctly from the marine faunas, and 
that until evidence is obtained positively identifying faunas of the two 
types of deposits, they should be classified separately. 

The same author (289) in a note to the editors of the American Nat- 
uralist announces that he has found that Mr. Cummins was entirely 
correct in his reported discovery of Mesozoic and Paleozoic types of in- 
vertebrates commingled in one and the same layer of tbe Permian. The 
deposits in which this discovery was made are in Baylor, Archer, and 
Wichita Counties, Texas. 

Three papers by J. W. Dawson (62, 63, 70), although not of a pale- 
ontological nature, are of interest to paleontologists. The author com- 
pares the Eozoic and Paleozoic deposits of eastern North America with 
the European series of deposits, and also with those of the Arctic basin. 
De finds the geological series up to tbe Trias-Juras, and after an inter- 
val again in the Quaternary, to be closely related on the borders of the 
Atlantic on both sides, and far northward into the Artie regions, and 



PALEONTOLOGY. 289 

the series of deposits of the maritime provinces of eastern North Amer- 
ica much more closely corresponding with those of western Europe than 
with those of the interior of the American continent. 

PROTOZOA AND SPONGES. 

Sir William Dawson and George Jennings Flinde (72) describe some 
new species of fossil sponges from Little Metis, Province of Quebec 
Canada. The following new species are proposed : 

Protospongia tetranema, Dawson, p. 52-53, f. 1, and farther doacribed and dis- 
cussed by Hinde, pp. 63-65. 
Hi/aloslelia metissica, Dawson, p. 54, and Hindu's comruents, p. 65. 
Cyatlwpbycus qtiebeveusi , Dawson, p. 54, Hiude's comments, pp. 65-67. 
Buthotrvphis pergracilis, Dawson, p. 55. 

G. J. Hinde (114:) discusses the spicules and structure of Archmocya- 
t1ms minganensis. The author concludes that the sponge spicules found 
in association with this fossil are not part of its structure, and that the 
so-called "branching spicnla" are siliceous replacements of the tissue 
of its outer wall; but he does not conclude that the ArcJueocijathus is 
allied to the siliceous sponges. He is of the opinion that the fossil was 
originally calcareous. 

C D. Walcott (L'59) explains and defends his reference of Archceocija- 
thus prof undus of Billings lo Meek's genus Ethmophyllum, as proposed 
in his recent publication, Thirtieth Bulletin of the U. S. Geological 
Survey. 

Joseph F. James (123) discusses the Protozoa of the Cincinnati group. 

George J. Hinde (111) considers the species Hindia fibrosa of Roemer 
to be identical with Astylospongia inornata^ Hall, 18;J3, and that the 
genera Hindia and Astylospongia are closely allied. 

P. M. Duncan (74) makes a critical reply defending his establishment 
of the genus Hindia., claiming that Roemer was ignorant of the char- 
acters which indicate the relationship of his species to the sponges. 

Anthony Woodward (307) published a sui)plement to his "Bibli- 
ography of the Foraminifera" (Fourteenth Annual Report of the Geo- 
logical Survey of Minnesota, pages 1G7-311) in the Journal of the New 
York Microscopical Society, January, 1888. The imperfections of this 
work called forth the severe criticism of Mr. Charles D. Sherborn (Na- 
ture, vol. 37, pp. 583-584, 1888), who published in London an exhaustive 
treatise (238) on the " Bibliography of the Foraminifera, recent and fos- 
sil, from 1565 to 1888." 

James Hall (94) gives some interesting statistics in regard to the 
Dictyospongida'. They are recorded as ranging geologically from the 
Utica slate to the Sub-carboniferous, and geographically are reported 
from the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. A 
list of forty species is given and a map of Steuben County on which are 
marked the localities where Dictyophyton has been found.

290 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Eozoon canadense has received some attention durin.i? the two years 
under consideration. Sir William Dawson (CO, 09) has brought the dis- 
cussion of the nature of Eozoon canadense n\) to the present time. In 
the paper (09), issued by the Peter Kedpath Museum of McGill Uni- 
versity, the author presents an exhaustive review of the characters of 
jBJo2:oon, discusses the objections to its animal nature, and gives (on p. 
91) a summary of the arguments in support of the animal nature of 
Eozoon canadense, the chief points of which are as follows : 

''1. It occurs in masses in limestone rocks, just as Stromatoporse oc- 
cur in the Pahneozoic limestone. 

<'2. While sometimes in confluent and shapeless sheets or masses, 
it is, when in small or limited individuals, found to assume a regular 
rounded, cylindrical or more frequently broadly turbinate form. 

"3. Microscopically it presents a regular lamination, the laminae 
being confluent at intervals so as to form a network in the transverse 
section. The lamin;e have tuberculated surfaces or casts of such tu- 
berculated surfaces, giving an acervuliue appearance to those lamimie 
which are supposed to be the casts of chambers. 

"4. The original calcareous lamiute are traversed by systems of 
branching canals, now filled with various mineral substances, and in 
some places coarse and in many others becoming a tine tubulated wall. 
The typical form of these canals is cylindrical, but they are often flat- 
tened, especially in the larger stems. 

"5. In some specimens, large vertical tubes or oscula may be seen to 
penetrate the mass. 

" 6. On the sides of such tubes, and on the external surface the lam- 
in fe subdivide and become confluent, thus forming a species of porous 
epidermal layer or theca. 

'• 7. Fragments of Eozoon are found forming layers in the limestone, 
showing that it was being broken up when the limestones were in pro- 
cess of deposition. 

" 8. The great extent and regularity of the limestones show that they 
were of marine origin, and they contain graphite, ai)atite, and obscure 
organic ("?) fragments other than Eozoon. 

'' 9. The ordinary specimens of Eozoon are mineralized with hydrous 
silicates (serpentine, etc.) in the same manner with Silurian and other 
specimens filled with glauconite, etc. These hydrous silicates also oc- 
cur in the same limestones in concretions, bands, etc., in such a manner 
as to prove that they were deposited contemporaneously. 

" 10. In some cases the canals and chamberlets are filled with cal- 
citean^l dolomite, in the manner of ordinary calcareous fossils, and this 
filling can often be distinguished from the original calcareous wall by a 
minutely granular or porous structure in the latter. 

"11. The specimens of Eozoon have been folded and faulted with the 
containing limestones, showing that they are not products of any 8ut>- 
sequent segregation. 



PALEONTOLOGY. 291 

*' 12. Similar testimony is borne in the fact that the masses of Eozoon 
are crossed by the veins of chrysotile which traverse the limestones 
and are of later origin. 

"13. The whole of the forms and structures seen in Eozoon corre- 
spond with those to be expected in a gigantic and highly generalized 
Khizopod secreting a calcareous test, and possessing, as might be anti- 
cipated in such early organism, structures in some degree allied to such 
hiter forms as Stromatoporte and calcareous sponges, which in the 
Eozoic it functionally represented." 

This book will be of great value to students of pala3ontology, espe- 
cially to those connected with the universities and called upon to dis- 
cuss the order of the appearance of life in the Geological Series. Sir 
William Dawson, who has championed the organic nature of Eozoon 
for so many years, finds no reasou to change his views, although very 
able antagonists have presented the arguments against its organic 
nature. 

Dr. Selwyn, the director of the Canada Survey (235) refers to Sir 
William Dawson's paper in the Geological Magazine (GG), and expresses 
his dissent from the views expressed by the author "in correlating 
any of the so-called Upper Laurentiau Anorthosites of the vicinity of 
St. Jerome or elsewhere with the Huronian rocks west of Lake Supe- 
rior." The massive Anorthosites he continues to regard as clearly in- 
trusive, and that the so-called Noriau or Upper Laurentian formation 
has, as such, no existence in Canada. 

L. P. Gratacap (92) has recorded his recognition of Eozooual rock on 
Manhattan Island. 

CORALS. 

P. M. Duncan (75) describes a new genus of Madreporaria under the 
name of Glyphastrcva, of which the type species is Septastroea Forbesi, 
Edwards and Ilaime, from the Tertiary deposits of Maryland. He gives 
an amended descrii)tion of the species, pages 29, 30, with figures illus- 
trating it, plate iii, figs 1-16. 

G. J. Hiiide (112) presents a minute and exhaustive study of the 
distinguishing characters and nonu'uclature of the genus iSejyfastrcca, 
D'Orb., revises the generic definition, gives a iist of the species with 
notes upon their characters, and in a plate illustrates them. He criti- 
cises the previously-mentioned paper of Duncan's and considers the 
original species i^eptaatrwa Forhesl, Edw. and H., which was used as 
the type of Duncan's genus Gh/phasfrfva to be generically identical with 
the type species of D'Orbigny's genus ^Septd.strwa. 

C. A. White (290) describes a new genus, Hinrleastrcea (page 302) 
of which the type species is a new species, //. discoinea, page 3G3, figs.

292 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Miss Mary B. Holmes (110) has prepared a paper beautifully illus- 
trating the "morphology of the cariiune upon the septa of rugose corals," 
presented as a thesis for the degree of doctor of philosophy in the Uni- 
versity of Michigan. A short notice of this paper is given in the Amer- 
ican Geologist, vol. i, p. 61. I have seen the drawings, but have not 
read the paper. 

CRINOirS. 

Wachsmuth and Springer (252) publish part in, the final number, of 
their Revision of the Paheocrinoidea. This consists of section 2, j)p. 
139-334, and an index, pp. 303-334, which, I understand, was not pub- 
lished in the Proceedings of the Academy of N^atural Science. Although 
section 2 of part in was presented to the Academy in 1886, it was not 
published until 1887. This completes the grand work in which is given 
a thorough diagnosis of each genus with citation of the known species, 
and full bibliographic references for the Paliiecrinoidea. 

Part III is devoted to the discussion of the classification and rela- 
tions of the Brachiate Criuoids, and the conclusion of the generic de- 
scriptions. The following new genera and species are described : 

Stenocrhnis (syn. Heterocrinus ill part), \}. 207, type " Heterocrinus hetcrodac- 

iyhis," Hall, 1843. 
Ohiocrinua [Heterocrinus, Hall, in part), p. 208 {HcferncrinHs laxus, Hall, type 

of the genus). 
Atelestocrinus, p. 221, pi. 6, f. 4, and pi. 9, f. 4, Low. Garb., Iowa. 
Atelestocrinus delicatits, p. 223, Low. Carb., Iowa. 

Atelestocrinus robustus, p. 223, pi. 9, f; 4, Low. Carb., Iowa and Tennessee. 
Zencrinus vodosus, p. 243, pi. (>, f. 3, Low. Carb., Tennessee. 
Stemmatocrinus Trautacholdi, p. 256, pi. 9, f. 7, 8, Low. Carb., Tennessee. 

C. A. White (279) gives a review of this book. The same authors, 
Wachsmuth and Springer (253), discuss the Summit plates in Blas- 
toids, Criuoids, and Oystids. (This paper is reviewed by C. A. White, 
281.) This paper consists of a review and criticism of the opinions of 
Etheridge and Carpenter as expressed in the " Catalogue of the Blas- 
toidea in the Geological department of the British Museum (Nat. 
Hist.), with an account of the morpliology and systematic position of 
the group, and a revision of the genera and species. By Robert Eth- 
eridge and P. Herbert Carpenter. Quarto. Pages i-xvii, and 1-322,20 
plates, London, 18S6." The part discussed is found, particularly, in 
chapter iv, pages 66-74 inclusive. Messrs. Wachsmuth and Springer 
have prepared plates which accompany the i)aper illustrating the ven- 
tral aspects of species of the following genera: Splicer onites, Cyathocri- 
nus, Stephanoermus, Raplocriniis, Caryocrinns,Jnglandoc7'inus, Talaroeri- 
nus, Elcvcrimis. In another paper (255) the same authors discuss the 
characters of Grotalncrimis, and in (254) the structure of the ventral 
surface of Taxocrinns. 

S. A. Miller (188) names and defines tiie new genus, Siphonocrinvs, 
page 263, adopting as the type siJecies Glyptocrinus nobilis. Hall (20th 



PALEONTOLOGY. 293 

Report N. Y. Mus. Nat. Hist., p. 3GL», pi. x, 1'. 9, 10). Tlie aiitlior refers 
to the same genus the species Uucalyptocrinus armosus, McGliesuey 
(= Glyptocrinns armosufi, Hall). 

The late U. P. James (131) published a reprint of the description of 
Agelacrinus HolbrooM, U. P. James, page 25, with a figure. 

VY. R. Billings (IG) published the following new genus and species 
from the Trenton formation of Ottawa and neighborhood : Ottaicacri- 
nus, gen. no v., and 0. typus^ sp. no v., p. 49, Calceocrinus furciUatus, sp. 
uov., p. 61, G. rugosiis, sp. uov., p. 53. 

THE MOLLUSCOIDA. 

A few papers have been written on the Polyzoa and Brachiopods 
which do not fall into any of the other divisions of this report. 

C. Rominger (227) describes a new form of Bryozoa from the drift of 
Ann Arbor, Michigan, under the name of Patellapora stellata, sp. uov., 
p. 11, pi. i, f. 10. 

Joseph F. James has a short note (125) on the value of the internal 

' sections of corals when used for specific characters, considering them 

to be of small value because of the great variation they show, and of 

the different forms presented according to the relation of the plane of 

the section to the individual cells, 

A. F. Foerste (82) and E. O Ulrich (249) reply to Mr. James's criticism, 
defending the methods in use by Mr. Ulrich and Mr. Ford. 

J. F. James (128) presents a paper " on the MonticuHpora a coral, not 
a Polyzoan." He had already i)ublished an elaborate review of the 
Trenton Monticuliporoidne (130). In the present paper the author re- 
views the characters of the family Monticulporoidai of Nicholson, in- 
cluding the genera Mo)iticulipor a and Geramopora, and defends the view 
of Nicholson in placing them among the Coelenterata near the Helio- 
poridffi, as opposed to the classification ofE. O. Ulrich, who classes them 
with the Polyzoa, " Bryozoa." 

H. A. Nicholson (202) writes on certain anomalous organisms which 
are concerned in the formation of the PahBozoic limestones. In the 
course of the paper he defines them under the names Mitcheldeania gre- 
gari(7, n. sp., p. 16, f. 1, 2, and Solenopora fiUformis, n. sp., p. 21, f. 4. 

The characters of the genus Girvanella, Nicholson and Etheridge, 18S0, 
are also discussed, and comparisons are made with related American 
forms. In another pai)er (201) Professor Nicholson comments upon 
new or imperfectly known species of Stromatoporids. No new s{)ecies 
are described, but some American species are figured with descrii)tions 
and notes ui)on their characters. 

E. O. Ulrich (248) discusses the genus Sceptropora with remarks upon 
Helopora, Hall. The author describes and figures a new genus and 
species of Lower Silurian Polyzoan, under the name Sceptropora/acula, 
gen. et sp. nov , pp. 228,229, obtained from Manitoba, and also from 
two localities in Illinois. He considers the systematic position of the 



294 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888 

uew ^emis as near that of the genus Hdopora in the laniily Arthro- 
stylidw ( UIri(;li). This laniily name is based upon the new generic name 
Arthrostylus, which, in a foot-uote, the author erects in place oJl Arthro- 
nema, Ulrich, which he finds preoccupied. Illustrations are given of 
the internal characters of Helojjora, also of the characters of the family 
to which it belongs. 

Jaraes Hall (93), at the end of the forty-first report of the Trustees of 
the New York State Museum of Natural History, published TectuUpora 
nov. subgen., Feiiestella {Tcctulipora) loculata, n. sp., and Feuestella 
frequens, n sp., pi. ix, f. 12-15. The pages are not numbered, but as 
bound would be 490 for all but the last, which is 497. On pi. x the 
figures 14,15 are called in explanation of plate " Fcnestella nexilis, u. 
sp.", and on pi. xiv, figures 10-12 are called Feuestella vdria, n. sp." 

Norman Glass (90) has written a paper on the principal modifications 
of the spirals in the fossil Brachiopoda. The author notes the position 
of the spirals in the shell, comments upon the attachments of the spi- 
rals to the hinge-plate of the dorsal valve, and on the loop or the con- 
nection of the spirals with each other in the various genera of spii«al- 
bearing Brachiopoda. 

U. S. Williams (300) discusses the characters of the representatives 
of the family Strophomenidie at its first prominent appearance in the 
Trenton. He analyzes the characters and shows their relationship to 
each other. The characters which became at a later stage generic dif- 
ferentia were found in a plastic state at the first stage. The specific 
difierentia expressed throughout the life history of the family appeared 
to be more ])lastic in the early than in the later species. In the later 
stages of the history of the family the specific characters are more 
sharply accentuated, but except in this way they scarcely exceed in 
variety those appearing at the first stage of existence of the family. 

THE GASTEROPODA. 

Charles R. Keyes has written several papers (137, 138, 139, 140) in 
regard to Platyceras and its relations to the Crinoids upon whi<!h it is 
found attached. In one of the papers (138) four new species of Platy- 
ceras are described and figured from the Lower Carboniferous beds of 
Iowa. They are as follows : 

Platyceras ca})ax, p. 241, f. 14, 15. 
rialyccras ohliqtium, p. 241, f. 12, 13. 
Plati/ceras latum, p. 242, f. 10, 11. 
Pliitijccras formosum, p. 242, f. 8, 9. 

In the other three papers the author gives an interesting account of 
the mode of attachment of Platycera.s to the dome of Crinoids. The asso- 
ciation of the front part of the shell with the anal opening suggests the 
probability that the Gasteropod lived upon the excreta of the Crinoid. 
The attachment appears to have continued long, and probably during 
the life of the Platyceras, and this is regarded as sutficieut explanation 



PALEONTOLOGY. 295 

for tlio considerable variation of the Grasteropod in its '^general form, 
configuration ol'tlie aperture, and tlie surface markings." In spite of 
the clear recognition of this plasticity of form the author has been una- 
ble to resist the temptation to name and define in terms of these plastic 
characters the four new species above mentioned. 

THE CEPHALOPODA. 

Alpheus Hyatt (121) has presented a valuable paper, strictly biological, 
in which he discusses the value of embryological characters in the deiini- 
tion and classification of the Cephalopoda. He proposes a new nomen- 
clature for the stages of development of the embryo, and applies the 
classification in distinguishing the various stages represented by the 
fossil Cephalopoda. In a brief review it is impossible to give the sub- 
stance of this paper, and those interested are referred to the article 
itself, which is fully as interesting as the important works on similar 
subjects which Professor Hyatt has already published. Professor Hyatt 
also read a paper before the ISTational Academy, at the Boston meeting, 
on the primitive forms of Cephalopods (119), an abstract of which is 
given iu the American Naturalist, as above cited. It is difficult to ex- 
press in briefer words the contents of this valuable paper. The author 
discusses the phylogeuetic relations of the Paheozoic and later Cepha- 
lopods, particularly in respect to their characters of curving, from the 
straight coiled form, as seen in Orthoceras, to the close coiled Nautiliau 
form. 

In the report of Contributions to Canadian Pala3ontology, by Pro- 
fessor Whiteaves (292), two generic descriptions are communicated by 
Professor Hyatt (120) from theTriassic rocks of British Columbia. The 
names are — 

Arniotites, Hyatt, geu. iiov., p. 144, type Balatonites arictiformis, Mojsisovics. 
Dorikraniies, Hyatt, gea. nov., p. 145, type Balatonites Bagdoamis, Mojsisovics. 

Arthur H. Foord (86) publishes a note on the genus Actinoceras with 
Ijarticular reference to specimens in the British Museum showing the 
perforated apex of the Siphuncle; the specimens illustrated are from 
the Trenton and Black River rocks of the United States, British North 
America, and Arctic America. The same author (87) writes on the 
genus Piloceras Salter, as elucidated by examples lately discovered in 
North America and Scotland. The bibliography of the genus is re- 
ferred to, the internal structure is described and illustrated, and the 
characters discussed, based upon study of Scotch and American speci- 
mens. 

ARTHROPODA. 

A. S. Packard published in 1887 several memoirs which were read 
before the National A(;ademy of Sciences in 1SS5, and their contents 
have already been rei)orted in the scientific .journals. 

The first (218a) "On the Syncarida, a hitherto undescribed synthetic 
groupof extinct Malacostracous Cntatacea''^ (vol. iir, p[). 12;>-128, and two 



296 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

plates) discusses the characters of the species Acantliotelson sfimpsoni, 
Meek and Wortheii, and A. eveni, M. and W. Some new facts in regard 
to them have come to light through the study of additional specimens 
from the collections of R. D. I^acoe and J. C. Carr. The author defines 
one new species from Mazon Creek, Acantliotelson (?) magister, p. 127, 
pi. ii, f. 4, 6. In a foot-note (p. 128) some new characters, observed on 
a larger specimen from Brainwood, Illinois, are made the basis of a 
brief definition of and the proj^osal of a new generic name, Belotelson 
(the entire name Belotelson mcujister), for the species. 

In the second paper {2lSb) '' On the Gampsonychida^, an undescribed 
family of fossil Schizopod Crustacea " (pp. 129-133, pi. iii), the study of 
specimens of Paloeocaris typus, Meek and Worthen, has induced the 
author to comjiare them with the genus Gampsoiiyx, " and the result 
has led to the formation of a family or higher group for the genera, 
which should probably stand at the base of the Schizopoda, while also 
serving to bridge over the chasm existing between the Thoracostracous 
suborders Syncarida and Schizopoda." 

In the third paper (218c) " On the Anthracaridfe, a family of Carbon- 
iferous Macrurous Decapod Crustacea," pp. 134-139, pi. iv, the author 
presents new facts regarding the species Anthrapalccmon gracilis, Meek 
and Worthen, from study of which and comparison with other forms he 
erects for it and kindred forms the family Anthracaridw. 

A fourth paper {2l8cl) is " On the Carboniferous Xiphosurous fauna 
of North America," pp. 143-157, pis. v, vi, vii. This paper defines and 
figures Cyclus Americana Packard, Dipeltis diplodiscus Packard, Prest- 
loichia dance, Meek, Frestwichia longispina Packard, and Belinurus lacoei 
Packard. In a note on the validity of the genus Euprobps, the author ex- 
presses the opinion " tliat the apparent differences between Frestwichia 
and JEuproops, as stated by Messrs. Meek and Worthen, did not exist 
in nature." In a footnote, p. 150, the author discusses the characters 
of Frestwichia, eriensis Williams, and presents reasons for the opinion 
that the species is not a Frestwichia^ and for it he proposes the name 
and briefly defines the new genus FrotoUmulus. A synopsis of North 
American Xiphosura is given, p. 150 ; the name Synziphosura is pro- 
posed for the suborder, including Bunodidw Packard, Hemiaspida; Zittel 
(restricted), Fseudoniscidw Packard, and NeoUmulidxe Packard. 

The term Podostoma is proposed on page 150 for the class which in- 
cludes the two orders (i) Merostomata, with the suborders Xiphosura, 
Synziphosura, and Eurypterida, and (ii) Trilohita. 

The two articles recorded under the same author's name (218e, 220) 
are reviews of the monograi)hs above discussed. The first one (218e) 
is an abstract prepared by the author on the class Podostomata, and 
contains the substance of the latter part of the fourth paper above re- 
ferred to (218rf). The article (220) on Fossil Arthropods, in the Ameri- 
can Naturalist, is a brief notice by the editor of the four papers just 
mentioned. 



PALEONTOLOGY. 297 

S. H. Scudder (233) comumiiicates a brief note on J)r. Woodward's 
paper in the Geological Magazine, " On British Carboniferons Cock- 
roaches." 

J. M. Clarke (31) has published in the Journal of Morphology a beauti- 
ful and exhaustive memoir on the eyes of the common Devonian Trilo- 
bite, Phacops rana Green. He discusses the subject under the follow- 
ing sections : " The character of the visual area;" " The composition of 
the visual node," showing the arrangement of the lenses ; " The struc- 
ture of the lens;" "The multiplication and diminution in the number of 
lenses ;" " The development of the lens ;" " The structure of the sclera;" 
" The modes of preservation of the visual surface." 

August F. Foerste (83«) communicates some notes on the discovery 
of two new species in the Trenton limestone of Minnesota. These species 
are Illccnus {Nileus) minnesotensis sp. nov., p. 478, f. I, and Ilkenus Her- 
ricli, sp. nov., p. 497, f. 2, the latter of which he compares with Ilkcnus 
pterocephalus Whitfield, of the Niagara strata of Wisconsin. Figure and 
description are also given of lllcenus ambiguus Foerste, from the Niagara 
group of Pennsylvania. 

E. G. Chapman (23) publishes a short paper on the classification of 
Trilobites. 

E. N. S. Ringueberg (224) read a paper on a Trilobite track which 
presents the ten pairs of impressions of the feet in groups, separate from 
each other, from which he concludes that the mode of progression was 
by a series of jumps. 

VERTEBRATA. 

G. F. Matthew (IGG, 1G8) describes an interesting fish from the Silu- 
rian at Nerepis Hills, King's County, New Brunswick, uuder the name 
Diplaspis Acadica, (gen. et sp. nov.) page 69 (of No. 166), and this 
species he regards as allied to Pteraspis, but distinct. The species was 
originally described as Pferaspis (?) Acadica by the author, in the Ca- 
nadian Record of Science, 1886, pages 251, 252 and 323-325, and was 
taken from shales considered to be of an Upper Silurian age. 

J. S. Newberry' (199) discusses the characters of the genus Edestus^ 
and describes the Jaw of a gigantic species called Edestus (/i(/<i)itcus (sp. 
nov.), page 121, plate vi., f. 1. The paper by Miss Hitchcock (115) is a 
discussion of the relations of this genus. Professor Newberry has also 
published several papers on fossil fishes from the Devonian and Carbo- 
niferous (191, 194, 195, 197, and 198). In the paper on Titanichthys (195) 
a general description of the bones is given, illustrated with diagrams 
and drawings (which are not reproduced in the paper), and the name 
Titanichthys Clarldi (sp. nov.) was given to the species in honor of the 
discoverer, Dr. William Clark. The note in the American Geologist 
by E. W. Clay pole (34) refers to this same s])ecimen. In the paper 
(198), which is but an abstract. Professor Newberry describes brietiy aud

gives the names of the following new s[)ecies and genus : Gladodus Kep- 
leri, ])i>. 178,179; Actmojihorus {'^ei\. nov.) p. 171) ; A. ClarJcii, p. Hi) • 
Dinichthysenrtm, p. 179 ; D. fubercHlatus, p. 179. In the paper (197) a 
new species is briefly noticed under the name Rhizodus ariceps, p. 165, 
discovered by William McAdams in the St. Louis limestone at Alton, 
Illinois. 

A paper was read by J. F. Whiteaves (293) in May, 1888, before the 
Royal Society of Canada, entitled " Illustrations of the Fossil Fishes of 
the Devonian rocks of Canada." (If this is pnblished, a copy has not 
yet reached me. March 30, 1889.) 

Edward D. Cope (41), in connection with a brief notice of the Part on 
Fishes of Zittel's Manual of Paleontology, takes occasion to give a 
synopsis of his own views on the subject of the classification of the low- 
est vertebrata, in anticipation, as he informs the reader, of a fuller 
memoir with illustrations. 

J. W. Hulke (118) discusses the characters of Ornithopsis, H. G. See- 
ley, and Omosaicrus, R. Owen, pointing out the propriety of following 
the classification of Professor Marsh, and places Ornithopsis in the 
group Sauropoda, and Omosaurus in the group Stegosauria. He 
questions whether the specimens in the Leeds collection called Omo- 
saurus should not with justice be referred to the genus IStegosaurus, 
Marsh. 

R. Lj'dekker (153), in an article in the Geological Magazine, makes 
some corrections in his Catalogue of Fossil Reptilia, suggested by con- 
versations with O. C. Marsh during a visit to the Dinosaurian and other 
collections in the British Museum. 

O. C. Marsh (164) describes one new genus and five new species of 
Dinosaurs from the Potomac formation in Prince George's County, 
Maryland : 

Pleurocoelus nanus, gen. et sp. nov., p. 90-92, f. 1-6. 

Pleurocu'lus altus,sp. uov.,p. 92. 

Prieonodon crasmis, geu. et Hp. nov., p. 93, f. 7-9. 

Allosaiirus viedins, sp. nov., p. 93. 

Coelurus gracilis, sp. nov., p. 94. 

The same author (162, 163) describes the principal characteristics of 
the skull and dermal armor of IStegosaurus, illustrating them by numer- 
ous figures. 

The paper by E. D. Cope (53) is a short notice of the paper just men- 
tioned. E. D. Cope (38) discusses the characters of the Dinosaurian 
genus Gcelurus of Marsh. He regards the genus as Dinosaurian, allied 
to Megadactylus, Hitchcock, and describes the following new species: 
Coelurus longicolUs, p. 368, and Coelurus Bauri, p. 368. 

H. G. Seeley (234) discusses the characters of a vertebrate from the 
Wealden Beds of the Isle of Wight, called Thccospondylus Daviesij 
Seeley, and compares it with Coelurus frag His of Marsh. 



PALEONTOLOGY. 299 

. G. Baiir (12) gives some points upon tlic chissiticatiou ami relations 
of the Ichtliyopterygia. He concludes that " the Ichthyopterygia were 
developed from land-living rei>tiles which v^ery much approach the 
Spheuodontida^ ;" he classifies them in three families, viz : (1) Mixo- 
sauridai, Baur (including the genus Mixosaurus, Baur) ; {2) Ichthyo- 
sauridie, Bonaparte (iucludiug the genus Ichthyosaurus. Koeuig, etc.); 
(3) BaptanodontidiT^, Marsh (including Baptanodou, Marsh). 

F. W. Cragiu (55) describes, without figures, Trinacromerum (gen. 
nov.) and T. Bentonianum (sp. nov.), pp. 405-407. This species is said 
to belong to the order Sauropterygia, to resemble the genus Baptano- 
don, Marsh, and it may be identical generically with Piratosaurus, Leidy. 
The author promises a fuller paper with illustrations in the -'Bulletin 
of the Washburn College Laboratory of Natural History, Topeka, 
Kansas." 

E. D. Cope (52) announces the discovery of the remains of the genus 
GoniophoVts, and describes a new species under the name of G. Lucasii, 
p. 1107 (no figure). In the paper (39) on American Triassic Rhyncho- 
cephalia, he describes, more fully than in the original article, Typo- 
thorax coccinarUm, Cope, and from the study of new material he con- 
cludes that the species is allied closely to the genus Mtosaurus of 
Fraas. In another paper (43), the same author describes the following 
new species from the Trias of North America : 

Episcoposaiirus horridus, p. 213; the genus of this species is also new aud is con- 
trasted with Belodon. (No illustrations.) 
Tanystrophwus TrUHstoni, v.227. (Notigure.) 

Additional characters are described for the following species : 

Eupelon durus, Cope. 
Typothorax coccinarum, Cope. 
Belodon buccros, Cope. 
Belodon scolopax, Cope. 
Ttinystrophivus longicoUis, Cope. 
Tanystroplueus Bauri, Cope. 

Henry F. Osborne (204) compares and contrasts the two genera 
Dromatherium, Emmons, aud Microconodon, Osborne, and finds reason 
for considering them quite distinct types of animals. The Dromatherium 
he regards as distinct from any known mammal, recent or fossil, pre- 
senting some rei)tilian features, while the Microconodon is a more re- 
cent type and approaches in the form of its teeth some of the Jurassic 
mammals. The genus Microconodon was described by the author in 
the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Science for 
188G, page 302. It is founded upon the specimen in the collection of 
the Academy of Natural Science at Philadelphia, which was originally 
named Dromatherium by Emmons. The type of Dromatherium is D. 
sylvestrc, Emmons, 1857, the original specinuMi belonging to the museum 
of Williams College. In this paper both specimens are figured.

These are distributed among the following families, viz, 1 and 2 in 
Plagiaulacidai, 3 and 4 with Dryolestes in Dr^^olestidie, 5 and C, and 
Diplocynodon and Docadon in the family Diplocynodontid?e, 7 in the 
family SpalacotheridiB, the genus Tinodon in the family TinodontidaB, 
Triconodon and the new genus Friacodon in the family Triconodontidaj, 
and 8 in the family Paurodontida3. 

The author regards none of the known Mesozoic mammals as truly 
herbivorous. The Triassic mammals belonging to the two families 
Dromatherida3 and Microlestidai are quite distinct from any of the Ju- 
rassic forms. With a few exceptions the Mesozoic mammals best pre- 
served are manifestly low generalized forms without any distinctive 
marsupial characters (p. 344). They are distributed by the author in 
the three orders, Pantotheria (Marsh, 1880), Altotheria (Marsh, 1880), 
and MarsupiaJia; the families Plagiaulacidte and Microlestidiie alone 
being referred to the latter order. The paper ( 160) iu the Geological 
Magazine ai)pears to be a republication of the above. 

H. F. Osborne (203, 210) published an abstract of apaperon Mesozoic 
mammalia in the Proceedings (203), which is published in full in the 
Journal (210) of the Academy of Natural Science, Philadelphia. The 
author classifies the Mesozoic mammals primarily into two groups : (i) 
The suborder Multituberculata, Cope, 1884 ; (ii) A suborder, possibly 
equivalent to Polyprotodonta, called by him ^^ proto-Marsupialia," p. 10. 
In the suborder Multituherculata are included the families, l.Plagiaula- 
cida3, Marsh ; 2. Bolodontida^. 

In the sahorder ^'■proto-Marsupialia^^ are arranged in several sub- 
groups the following families : 

Carnivorous sub-group, A. (1) Triconodontidaj (Marsh) ; {la) Phas- 
colotheridte (Owen) ; (2) Spalacolheridii; (Owen), ('' equivalent to Tino- 
dontidrt?. Marsh"). Omnivorous sub-group, B. (4) Peralestidic (and ? 
Paurodontid;e, Marsh), and Diplocynodontida' (Marsh). Insectivorous 
subgroup, (3) Amplotheridse, C. (5) Stylodoutid* (Marsh). Herbiv- 



PALEONTOLOGY. 301 

orons sub frroup, D. (6) Athrodontida*, of which the j?enus Athrodon 
(geri. nov.) is based upon the maxilla of iStylodon pmillus (Owen). 

The Multitubercidafa are regarded as a sub-order of the Marsupialia^ 
while the second suborder presents no characters associating them with 
known Marsupialia. 

Osborne (215) gives additional observations upon the structure and 
classification of Mesozoic mammals, and offers the following summary, 
pp. 300-301, of the principal features of this contribution : 

" The principal features of the present contribution are the follow- 
ing : ( 1 ) Additional characters of Amphilestes and the probable determi- 
nation of the premolar-molar formula. (2) Additional characters of 
FhascolotJierium, suggesting a division between molars and premolars. 
(3) A review of the Amphitylus dentition. (4) The union of Leptocladus 
dnbius and SpaJacotherium minus with Peramns, and determination of 
the mandibular dentition of the latter genus. The molars are trituber 
cular. (5) The discovery also of apparently tritubercular molars in 
Amphithcrium and probable determination of the premolar-molar for- 
mula (confirming Owen's views) ; (G) confirming Lydekker's suggestion 
of the probable union of Peralestes with Spalacotheriiim, and of Pera- 
spalax with Amblotherium ; (7) the probable union of Peraspalax, Am- 
blotherium, Achyrodmi, Phascolestes, Stylodon, and Curtodon into two or 
three genera with a substantially similar molar structure; (8) the cor- 
rection of the writer's former views as to the family separation of the 
Perolesfidw and probably of the Curtodontidw. 

" The general result of the renewed and more extended study of these 
mammals has thus been, first, to reduce the number of genera and elim- 
inate two of the families proposed in the memoir; second, by the dis- 
covery of the molar structure of Amphitlierhim and Peramns, to substan- 
tially reduce the number of molar types among the English genera to 
two, viz, the triconodont in Amphilestes, Phascolotherium, Triconodon, and 
probably AmphityUis, and the tritubercular in all the remaining genera. 

"This latter result is of great interest in its bearing upon the theory 
that the molar teeth of all the mammalia have either passed through 
the tritubercular stage, or have been arrested at one of the steps in 
tooth development leading to this stage.'' 

Osborne (213) gives a short abstract of the full paper (214), which was 
published in the December number of the American Naturalist, 1888. 
The author proposes the following nomenclature for the cusps of the 
upper molars: 

Protocone, for the antero-internal cusp. 

Hypocone, for the posterointernal cusp, or sixth cusp. 

Paracone, for the antero-external cusp. 

Metacone, for the posteroexternal cusp. 

Protocotiule, for the anterior intermedial cusp. 

Metaconule, for the posterior-intermedial cusp. 



302 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

For the lower molars the termiDation e is cbanged to id in the first 
four iiames for tlie correspomliug cusps, tlius, Hypocone for the upper, 
Hypoconid for the lower. The term Upiconid is applied to the postero- 
internal cusp. 

Osborne's pa iDer (214) in its original form was read before the Geolog- 
ical section of the Bath meeting of the British Association in Septem- 
ber, 1888, and also before the National Academy of Sciences, in New 
Haven, November, 1888. An abstract was published in tlie American 
Naturalist (see 213), and 214 is the full pa])er. The author defines "the 
stages of Trituberculy as seen in different types " of the mammalian 
teeth in their order of succession as follows: I. Haplodont type ((Jope), 
not yet discovered. I, A. Protodont tubercular type; example, Droma- 
therinm. II. Triconodont type (Osborne) ; example, Triconodon. 111. 
Tritubercular type (Cope); example, lower molars of Spalacotherium 
and Asthenodon. 

Osborne (211) gives a review of Mr. Lydekker's arrangement of the 
Mesozoic mammals. 

E. D.Cope (50) discusses Riitimeyer's classification with some remarks 
upon the American types found in Switzerland. Mr. Cope (40, 45, 47) 
adds some new facts regarding the vertebrate fauna of the Puerco se- 
ries. In the first jiaper (40) the new species Psittacotherium megalodus 
is described, without figure, on page 409, and the species P. mnltifragum 
is referred to. In the last paper (47) the author reviews his studies of 
the Puerco epoch, while in the extended paper (45) the following species 
and one new genus are described, without illustration : 

Chelydra crassa, p. 306. 

Onychodectes, (gen. uov.), P- 1317. O. tisonenais, p. 318.

one hundred and six species, among which are represented Cro^odilia, 
Testudinata, llliynchocephalia, Ophidea, Aves, Marsupialia, Bunotheria, 
Taxeopoda, and Amblypoda. 

H. F. Osborne (212) notes the discovery, by M.Filhols, of the identity 
of Chalicotherium and Macrotherium. 



PALEONTOLOGY. 303 

E. D. Cope (51) states that he has found evidence of the presence of 
the pineal eye in some ancient vertebrates, and calls attention to the 
bearing of this fact upon the relationship of the vertebrates Avith the 
tunicates. In the plates published with this paper illustrations are 
given of Boihriolcpis Canadensis^ the skull of Ali/cterops orflinatus, Dia- 
deotcs i)liaseoUnus,A\\(\ the, cranium or brain cases of Belodon biiceros, 
and Alliyator Mississippiensis. The announcement of this discovery in 
early reptilian vertebrates evidently suggested the following papers : 
H. F. Osborne (205, 206) upon reading Owen's description of Tritylodon 
of the Upper Triassic of South Africa, in which the author refers to a 
vacuity between the parietals which "if natural, represents a fontanelle, 
or it may be interpreted as a pineal or parietal foramen; it may how- 
ever be due to posthumous injury," infers from this the remarkable hy- 
pothesis that " the primitive mammal of the family to which this be- 
longs had a pineal eye of some functional value." But examination of 
the specimen itself by Br. George Baur brought out the fact that no 
parietal foramen exists in Tritylodon (208). Thus suddenly the pineal 
eye of the primitive mammal is knocked out. 

Mr. Coi)e (46) gives some new facts regarding the shoulder girdle 
and extremities of Eriops, and (44) jiresents a number of tables ex- 
pressing the supposed phylogenetic relations of the several genera of 
artiodactyla, tracing them through the various stages of the Tertiary. 
The next (54) is apparently a modified form of this same paper. In 
another paper (42) the author describes a part of the mandible of a 
large cat from the Upper Miocene beds of Phillips County, Kansas, 
which is named 3Iacha'rodus, and specific name catocopis. No figures 
are given. 

Mr. Osborne (209) finds the name Athrodon, proposed in the paper 
(203) above referred to, preoccui)ied by Sauvage, and he proposes Kur- 
todon as a substitute. 

A memorandum (89) of a paper read at the meeting of the Academy 
of Science in Paris, J uly 30, 1888, by M. Albert Gaudry , is given in a note. 
Nature, vol. xxxviii, p. 384, in which the author records the relative 
dimensions of some of the larger Tertiary and Quaternary mammals; 
DinoiheriuM {lUjantcnm is given the first place, and Mastodon Ameri- 
canus of the Quaternary of the United States is given the fourth place. 

Mr. Cope (48) announces the discovery of a fragment of the carapace 
of Glyptodon in Nueces County, southern Texas, in beds which have 
yielded Equus crenidens, Cope. The discovery was made by William 
Taylor, and the specimen is described and named Glyptodon petalifer- 
ous (sp. nov.), pp. 345, 346.

trated at some future time. 

E. D. Cope {4:6a) describes the following new genus and species from 
the John Day Miocene of North America : 

Bothrolabis, Cope, (gen. nov.), p. 66, type B. rostratus, Cope; B. ros- 
trains (sp. cov.), pp. 77-79. The author states (p. 63) that lithographic 
plates of this species have been printed, but are unpublished. E. D. 
Cope (54a, 43fl) discusses the mechanical origin of the dentition of 
mammals. The author attempts (54a) to show why the AmhlypodUj 
having at the start apparently the same mechanical condition with the 
Carnivora, did not eventually produce the same result. He thinks that 
the divergence of mammalian dentition into two types, the tritubercu- 
lar and the quadritubercular, has been due to the adoption of different 
food habits. "The tritubercular," he says, "is the primitive, and is 
adapted for softer food, as flesh, so that the primitive Mammalia were 
carnivorous, or nearly so. The mastication of hard food was impossi- 
ble until the molars of the two series opposed each other, and this was 
not accomplished until the quadritubercular or superior molar was pro- 
duced."

Professor Ward has also contributed several reviews of current lit- 
erature on Palajobotany (267, 268-270, 271), which have appeared in 
the American Journal of Science. 

Mr. Lesquereux (152) describes fossil plants from Golden, Colorado; 
all the species are of the Tertiary age, and mostly of the Lower Miocene. 
The following are the new species described and named, but not illus- 
trated :

F. H. Knowltou (142) describes some specimens of silicifled wood from 
Arizona under the names of AraHcarioxylon Arizonicum, and under the 
generic name CresHinoxylon. 

N. L. Britton (18) has described an Archi^an plant from the white 
crystalline limestone of Sussex County, New Jersey, under the name 
Archcvophyton Neivberryanum, and although its characters are very im- 
l)erfect, Mr. Britton regards it as the remains of a plant. 

Joseph Le Coute (146) discusses the interesting flora of the ooast 
islands of California. This same article appeared also in the American 
Geologist, vol. i, and in Bulletin No. 8 of the California Academy of 
Sciences. The author considers tlio flora of these islands as represent- 
ing somewhat nearly the cbaracter of the flora of the whole country

mainland during the Quaternary period. 

Leo Lesquereux (150) in a })aper ((!on)})ileil an<l prepared for publica- 
tion by F. ET. Knowlton, assistant curator of Botany and Fossil Plants 
U. S. National IMuseum), has described a number of new species of

"The Geological History of Plants," of J. \Y. Dawson, presents in a 
very readable form an account of tlu' plants which have appeared in the 
past and are now extinct, describing their historical se(iuence and the 
characters presented by the faunas of each age. The notes to the sev^- 
eral chapters contain much of value to the special student of Paheon- 
tology. A note "Ou examination of Frotaxites, by Professor Penhal- 
low," is inserted at the end of chapter ii. At the end of chapter iii

are foimd notes "On tbe Classification of Sporangites,^^ p. 84 ; "On the 
Natnre and Affinities of Ptilophyton,'^ p. SG ; " On Tree Ferns of the Erian 
Period," p. 90 ; "On Parian Trees of the Genus Dadoxi/lon, linger," p. 96 ; 
"On Scottish Devonian Plants of Hugh Miller and others," p. 98; "On 
the Geological Relations of some Plant-bearing Beds of Eastern Canada," 
p. 103; "On the Relations of the so-called 'Ursa Stage' of Bear Island 
with the Palaeozoic Flora of North America." At the end of chapter 
IV twenty-seven pages of fine print are devoted to a note "On Charac- 
ters and Classification of Palaeozoic Plants." In an appendix there are 
eight pages giving "A Comparative View of the successive Paleozoic 
Floras of Northeastern America and Great Britain," and a few ])ages on 
" Heer's latest results in the Greenland Flora." The volume is particu- 
larly complete in its account of the plants of the Devonian of North 
America, in which field the author is the chief iiuthority. 

Leo Lesquereux (148) has prepared for the annual report of the Geo- 
logical Survey of Pennsylvania a short treatise on the " Characters and 
Distribution of PahTOzoic Plants," in which the plants of the Carbon- 
iferous system are chiefly discussed. The author also considers the evi- 
dences offered by plant remains of the physical conditions under which 
the deposits were formed, and the relations the several geographical 
tracts of North America in which coal measures appear bore to each 
other during the Carboniferous age.

PETROGRAPHY FOR 1887 AXD 1888. 



By George P. Merrill, Curator in the Xational Musemn. 



The years 1887 aDcl 1888, covered by this report, have been years of 
unprecedeuted activity and progress in that branch of geological 
science to which the name petrography is now commonly applied. 
Accessions to the ranks of workers, both in America and abroad, have 
been rapid and constant, and the science now holds a place in the 
curricula of our leading institutions of learning.* Prior to 1880, al- 
though beginniugs had been made by Wadsworth at Harvard, Hawes 
at Yale, and Julien at Cokimbia College, yet the science was still prac- 
tically unrecognized and almost unheard of in the majority of American 
colleges and universities. At the present date it however holds a 
lecoguized place in the curricula of Colby, at Waterville, Maine; Har- 
vard and Amherst, Massachusetts ; New Haven, Connecticut ; Cornell 
and Columbia, !New York ; Johns Hopkins, at Baltimore, Maryland ; 
State University, at Minneapolis, Minnesota; State Mining School, at 
Houghton, Michigan; State University, at Madisou, Wisconsin; and 
in the University of California, at Berkeley, in that State. At many 
other institutions, the subject is referred to incidentally in the regular 
courses of geology and mineralogy, or is taken up to some extent by 
post-graduate students working for the higher degrees. 

A pleasing and encouraging feature of this stage of work is the free- 
dom from prejudice and preconceptions manifested by most classes of 
students, and it is doubtful if any branch of science has shown a more 
hopeful and healthful condition of affairs than that existing to-day 
among petrographers. The disposition or desire at first manifest to 
claim for the new departure all manner of possibilities, to solve im- 
mediately the problems of rock classification, formation, durability, 
and alteration, has already given way to a broader, more i)liilosophic 
spirit; and petrographers in general are disi)0sed to hold opinions and 
convictions in abeyance, to regard each new discovery in but the light 
of one new fact from among the ciiaos of which, when sutfu^ient may 
have accumulated, may be picked out the general principles governing 
rock history and the history of the globe. 



* For a very complete account of mothod8 aud aims of petrography, tlie American 
reader is referred to tlu^ neat little pamphlet of :W pages, l>y Dr. George II. Williams,

328 EECOR]) OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

It is a. necessary consequence to tiie late development of the science 
that a great amount of detailed study be given to rock structure and com- 
position as revealed not only by the microscope and chemical analyses, but 
by their field relations as well, and that therefore the published papers 
should be given up largely to what may- seem to the outsider the dry, 
uninteresting and perhaps immaterial iteration and re-iteration of de- 
tails in even their most minute forms. To enter upon a discussion or 
to note even in abstract the contents of all these iDapers would be use- 
less and out of place here, and in the body of this paper I shall strive to 
show only the general tendencies of these, to point out if possible the 
ultimate conclusions towards which they seem to be leading, leaving a 
majority of the papers to be enumerated in the bibliugraphy. 

NEW PUBLICATIONS. 

Early in 1887 there appeared the second volumeof the second edition 
of Professor Eoseubusch's works on petrography, entitled "THikrosko- 
pische Physiographie der massigen Gesteiue," the first volume, " Mikro- 
skopische Physiographic der Mineralien und Gesteine," having appeared 
in 1885. The entire work comprises 1,541 pages, with 32 full-page plates 
showing microstructures of rocks and minerals, and 177 wood-cuts in the 
text. The two volumes together form a most accurate and exhaustive 
resume of the sumof petrographic knowledge up to date of issue, and their 
appearance marks a decided epoch in the history of the science of petrol- 
ogy. Under the title of " Hiilfstabellen zur mikroskopischen Mineralbes- 
timmung in Gesteinen," the same authority has issued a compact little 
work giving in tabular form the crystallographic, optical, and, general 
physical and chemical properties of all the common rock-forming min- 
erals. It is of interest to note that upw ards of one hundred and seventy 
varieties are recognized. The arrangement is admirable, and the book 
can not fail to be of great assistance to all students and workers. An 
event second in importance only to the issue of Professor Kosenbusch's 
work has been the translation and abridgment of volume i by i\Ir. J. 
P. Iddings, ot the TJ. S. Geological Survey, audits publication by Wiley 
& Co., New York. As prior to this there was no comprehensive work 
on the subject in the Englisli language, the importance to English- 
speaking students of this translation can scarcely be over-estimated. 

Mr. -). J. H. Teall has published, under the name of "British Petrog- 
raphy," an admirable work, which, though treating only of British 
eruptive rocks, is the most systematic and comprehensive work of its 
kind that has yet been published in the English language. Irs size is 
large octavo, with some 450 pages of text and 47 colored plates, show- 
ing microscopic structure in l)oth ordinary and polarized light. The 
work is not a mere popular compilation of old and well-known facts, but 
is quite abreast of the times and thoroughly scientific, though at the 
same time written in such style as to be intelligible to those who are 
not experts in this particular branch of the subject. The American as

well as the British student is to be congratulated ui)on its appearance. 
Other new works in book form, but which the present writer not hav- 
ing seen can speak of only by title, are noted in the bibliography. 

ADVANCE WORK. 

While a very large portion of the work of the past two years, as in 
years before, has been purely descriptive of the mode of occurrence, 
structure, mineral and chemical com[)osition of rocks, yet the subject of 
the origin of rocks and the causes of their structural variability have 
been by no means ignored, as will be noticed. 

THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONDITIONS OF CRYSTALLIZATION. 

For many years there has been a growing feeling among geologists 
that the importance attached, particularly amoug German authorities, 
to geological age as a criterion in rock classification was greatly over- 
estimated, and the fact that neither mineral composition nor structure 
are necessarily dependent upon age is now very generally conceded. 
In his latest work, to be sure, Professor Roseubusch has not wholly dis- 
carded the age (lualihcation, owing to the fact that it is, as a rule, only 
amoug the most ancient rocks that the deep-seated portions have been 
rendered accessible by erosion, while on the other hand it is often only 
among the more recent that the effusive portions have escaped erosion 
or alteration and heuce are accessible for investigation. The now well- 
known researches of Messrs. Hague and Iddings upon the rocks of the 
Comstock Lode. Nevada,* showing that the " degreeof crystallization de- 
veloped in igneous rocks is mainly dependent upon the conditions of heat 
and pressure under which the mass has cooled and is independent of 
geological time," have received abundant confirmatory evidence, and it 
seems now a well-established tact that under similar circumstances crys- 
tallization and structure may be the same regardless of geological age. 
More recent discoveries and studies in this same general line have beeu 
productive of very interesting results. In a paper entitled " On the lat- 
est volcanic eruption in ( 'alifornia and its peculiar lava,"t Mr. J. ^. Dil- 
ler has described a very interesting type of rock, evidently a true ba- 
salt, but uni(iuein carrying primary pori)hyritic quartz, associated with 
olivine, a condition of alfairs ordinarily considered on chemical grounds 
as not likely to occur. The peculiarity is explained on the sui)[)osition 
that the quartz was the. first mineral to separate out from the nmgma, 
and its crystallization took place under great pressure at such depth 
and under such conditions of physical and chemical equilibrium as are 
as yet largely conjectural. Mr. Diller has been followed by Mr. hhlings 
with a pai)er on the "Origin of (juartz in basalt," J in which, by a series of 
analysesof quartz-bearing and (juartzless basalts from New Mexico and

California, it is shown that the presence or absence of free quartz is uot 
necessarily dependent upon the chemical composition of the magma, but 
that forms in which the mineral is abundant mn,j yield on bulk analysis 
as low percentages of silica as those in which it is quite lacking. It is 
also shown that a rock from the Yellowstone Park having a composition 
almost identical with that of Diller's quartz basalt has the mineralogical 
composition and structural features of a quartzose diorite. Mr. Iddings's 
conclusions are that these quartzes are primary crystnllizations from 
the molten basaltic magma and exhibit no definite relations to its chem- 
ical composition, their production being referred to certain physical 
conditions attending some earlier period of the magma's existence. He 
is inclined to regard their formation as influenced by water vapor at a 
great pressure. 

Tliis same authority has also published* some interesting notes on the 
nature and origin of the lithophyste and the lamination of acid lavas 
as displayed in the obsidian of the Yellowstone Park. The ly thophysfe 
he regards as of aqueo-igneous origin, as having been produced by the 
action of absorbed gases ui)on the molten glass, from which they were 
liberated during the process of cooling and consequent crystallization. 
The differences in consistency and phases of crystalizatiou producing 
the laminated structure are regarded as "directly due to the amount of 
vapors absorbed in the various layers of the lava and to their mineral- 
izing influence." 

In this connection a recent paper by Dr. A. Lagorio,t of the Uni- 
versity of Warsaw, is of the greatest interest. The author gives tlie 
results of several years' chemical investigation on the nature of the 
glassy ground mass and crystallized portions of eruptive rocks and 
arrives at sonic new and important conclusions. These, in brief, are as 
follows: He considers the "normal glass," in which are dissolved all 
the substances going on crystallization to form the crystalline secre- 
tions of a rock, to be a silicate of the composition of K^O 2 Si 02 (l>' o08). 
From this the dissolved oxides and silicates separate out in the order 
of their solubility and the relative condition of saturation, the sodium- 
bearing minerals, as a rule, separating out at an earlier stage than those 
in which potassium is the predominating alkali. The order of crystal- 
lization from the normal magma, as above given, would thus be as fol- 
lows: Oxides, pure iron silicates, magnesian silicates, iron magnesian, 
inagnesian lime, magnesian potash, lime, lime soda, soda, and finally the 
potash silicates and free quartz. The writer states further that the 
minerals forming the second generation of crystals are never absolutely 
identical in composition with those of the first, and are dependent for 
their formation not upon a recurrence of like conditions, but rather upon 
the comi)osition of the residual magma.

PETROGRAPUY. 331 

These results, though extremely suggestive, are not, it will be ob- 
served, in exact accordance with those arrived at by Messrs. Diller and 
Iddings, to whose papers we have already referred. The results ob- 
tained by these gentlemen, coupled with what is already known regard- 
ing the phenomena of crystallization, seem to show that structural feat- 
ures, and to a certain extent the universal composition of eruptive rocks, 
are dependent upon (1) the chemical composition of the magma and (2) 
the varying conditions of heat and i)ressure under which this magma 
existed prior to and during the course of its eruption. A mineral which 
separates out under certain temporary conditions of heat and pressure 
may, under changed conditions, be partially or wholly resorbed, and the 
condition of chemical equilibrium be so changed as to give rise to crys- 
talline secretions of quite different nature. 

Mr. G. F. Becker, in a paper treating of the texture of massive rocks,* 
and drawing his illustrations from the maguiticent exposure offered by 
Mount Davidson and the Comstock Lode, IsTeviida, argues on chemical 
and theoretical grounds that the structural differences existing between 
holocrystalline porphyritic and granular rocks are due not to condi- 
tion of cooling, but rather to original differences in composition and 
fluidityof the magma. Granular structure, excepting in rarecases,isdue 
to imperfect fusion and fluidity of the magma. Pori)hyritic structure, 
on the other hand, is the normal structure of rocks cooling gradually 
from a high temperature and consequent state of very ])erfect fluidity. 
When the two types of structure are associated it is argued that this is 
due to a lack of homogeneity in chemical composition and to tempera- 
tures sufScient to fuse portions, but not the entire mass. Granular 
rocks as a rule, he argues, have formed at lower temperatures than por- 
phyriesof precisely the samechemical composition. Granularstructure is 
therefore characteristic of rocks formed by the metamori)hism of sedi- 
ments and porphyritic structure characteristic of those crystallizing 
from homogeneous fluid magmas. These conclusions are based largely 
on a new law of thermochemistry advanced by Mr. Becker in a previ- 
ous paper.t In this same connection may be mentioned the researches 
of Professor Judd, who, in a very interesting and important paper in 
the Geological Magazine for January, 1888,:j: calls attention, first, to the 
great dissimihirity in chemical coniposition of rocks classed as enstatito 
or hypersthene ardesite, the silica percentages in extreme cases varying 
nearly 20 per cent., and shows that this diff"erence is due mainly to the 
relative pi'oportions of tiie crystalline constituents to the glassy base. 
Then, treating wholly of the glassy lavas of Krakatoa, he shows that 
the obsidian, containing a considerable percentage of volatile matter, 
swells up and fuses at approximately a white heat, while the stony

lavas and pitch-stones remain unchanged. In the field this distinction 
is shown by the puniiceous condition of the obsidian and massive form 
of the stony lava and pitch-stone. From tliese and the facts that the 
porphyritic constitnents of the obsidian occur in " glomero-porphyritic" 
forms he argues that this obsidian is but a refused portion of the older 
Krakatoa lavas, and, after a discussion of Dr. Guthrie's experiments 
on the influence of water in lowering the fusion points of niineral sub- 
stances, proceeds to argue that this refusion and perhaps the volcanic 
eruption of Krakatoa itself was brought about through the admission 
of water in the mass of mixed silicates buried at depths below the sur- 
face. The mass of anhydrous rock migh t be in a solid state at a compar- 
atively high temperature, while the same rock rendered hydrous through 
the gradual percolation of water would ultimately fuse and give rise to 
all the phenomena of the eruption. As expressed by Guthrie, "the 
phenomena of fusions is nothing more than an extreme case of lique- 
faction by fusion," it being impossible to tell where liquefaction leaves 
off and fusion begins. 

CONTACT METAMORPHISM. 

Several fine illustrations of contact metamorphism have been described 
during the two years covered by this report and mention may here be 
made of a few of the more interesting and important. 

Dr. G. H. Williams* concludes an admirable series of papers on the 
rocks of the ' ' Cortland series, " near Peekskill, N. Y., with a description of 
their contact metamorphisma or phenomena produced by eruptive rocks 
on the adjacent schists and limestones. The eruptive, or dike rocks in 
this case are norites, gabbros, peridotites, mica or mica-hornblende dio- 
rites, pyroxenites, and hornblendite. The schists are highly crystalline 
schistose rocks consisting of quartz and feldspar, with both muscovite 
and blotite together with tourmaline, magnetite, and zircon. A])proach- 
ing the line of contact the schists become more and more puckered and 
contorted and filled with lens-shaped " eyes "of quartz containing garnets 
and other contact minerals. In the schists themselves are developed 
stanrolite, sillimanite, cyanite, and garnet, the amountof metamorphism 
being directly proportional to the nearness to the line of contact. At con- 
tact the schistose structure is almost completely obliterated and the 
rock becomes hard and massive, appears more or less fused with the mica 
diorite, is highly garnetiferous, and consists of a great variety of miner- 
als, including stanrolite, sillimanite, pyroxene, green hornblende, dial- 
lage, scapolite, and sphene. J>riefly expressed, the progressive change, 
approaching the line of contact consist in a gradual decrease in tlu^ 
amount of silica and the alkalies with a corresponding increase in iron 
and alumina, this being accompanied by a disai)j)earan('e of the (piartz 
and muscovite an<l the development of biotit<', sillimanite, stanrolite, 
cyanite, and garnet. In fragments of the s(;hist taken up by the erup-

C/ohen* has described a case of conta(;t metamor})hism in which an 
ochre yellow, line-grained, and imperfectly schistose sandstone, (consist- 
ing esseutially of quartz and minute colorless mica lamiiiic and clayey 
matter colored by iron hydroxide, has been changed by contact with a 
dike of diabase. Api)roaching the contactthe sandstone becomes green- 
ish gray in color and the schistosity becomes obliterated. The green 
color is due to the developuient of a greenish, strongly pleochroic and 
doubly refracting chloritic mineral, which increases in (luantity as the 
line of contact is approached. The stone also assumes a slightly higher 
specific gravity and the fracture becomes choncoidal. With the in- 
crease of the chloritic mineral there begin also to appear small Hecks of 
a brown magnesia mica. The earthy (triiben) material disappears, as 
does also the small amount of calcareous matter observed, having ap- 
parently gone to form the new ndca. As the zone of immediate contact 
is approa(;hed, the rock becomes darker till finally grayish black, and the 
choncoidal fracture more perfectly developed. The microscope shows 
it to still consist of the secondary chlorite and brown mica together 
with the original constituents. At contact the stone is a typical horn- 
fels or lydiau stone of a clear black color and shelly fracture, but with 
no new minerals developed, although the structural arrangements are 
somewhat changed. Analyses of samples in whi(!h the biotit;e lamina^, 
were beginning to be developed, of the grayish black variety with 
shelly fracture and of the typical hornstone, showed that the composi- 
tion had in all cases remained practically unchanged, that the changes 
were not due to any addition of material from the dike. In contact 
metamorphisms described by Stecherf the sandstones and shales have 
have exercised a very considerable influence upon the olivine diabases 
cutting them. The material of the dikes was found to be more acid 
near the contact line, due presumably to the siliceous material dissolved 
from the sandstone and shale. Olivine in (luite perfect crystals occurs 
near the contact but gradually diminishes in quantity as oue recedes 
till it is wholly lacking in the center. This is accounted for by Steelier 
on the supposition that the material of the dike cooled most quickly on

the edges and preserved tlie olivine which hud formed prior to its iiijec- 
tiou. The inner portion remaining longer li(|nid and becoming more 
acid from the dissolved silica of the shales, redissolved the olivines. 

Barrois* has shown from a. study of the contact i>henomena of the 
granites of Morbihan that two forms of metamorphism occur, both struct- 
ural, the one due to rapid cooling and the second to mechanical agen- 
cies. In the first there is a transition from even granular to porphyritic 
oi'aplitic forms. In the second a schistose form is i)roducedouly atthe 
periphery of the mass aud due wholly to i)owerful mechanical agencies. 

Greim t has described in great detail an occurrence of contact phe- 
nomena between the olivine diabase near Weilburg, in Hesse-Nassau, 
aud the adjacent schists. Here the diabases remain practically un- 
changed, but that they are of tiuer texture at the contact, while the 
schists, composed originally of quartz, white mica, and hematite with 
lenticular beds of calcite, are converted into a compact rock vfith an iso- 
tropic groundmass in which are quartz, audalusite, spinel, and a chloritio 
mineral. The change has taken place with a very decided increase iu 
the amount of soda and iron, supplied ai)parently by the diabase. 

Eiideinannf has described an interesting case of contact metamor- 
phism in phyllites and clay slates at Reuth, near Gefrees, Bavaria. The 
erupted rock is a biotite granite aud in itself has suffered no other than 
structural modifications and a slight increase in the proportional amount 
of biotite. At contact bot'h phyllites aud slates are converted into a 
hard, compact, blue-black hornfelsconsistiugof a crystalline-granular ag- 
gregate of quartz, deep reddish brown mica (biotite), a little muscovite, 
and audalusite. This zone, some 120 paces in width, is succeeded by a 
second some 380 paces m width of audalusite mica schist and this by a 
spotted mica schist (Knoten-Schiefer) some 500 paces wide. Lastly the 
least altered rock, the chiastolite schist zone, some 400 paces wide, de- 
rived from the clay slates, or a biot'ite rock (Garben-Schiefer) from the 
phyllite. Itis noticeable thatinall these cases the chemical composition 
of the altered rocks is the same as that of the unaltered beds from which 
they are derived, no new material having been supplied by the erupted 
mass, though Riidemann would account for the formation of the hornfels 
by the action of the heated waters accompanying the eruption upon the 
materials of the slates and phyllites. The line of contact between the 
granite and hornfels, it should be noted, is in all cases perfectly sharp 
and distinct. The entire width of the metamorphosed zone was in the 
case of the phyllites some 1,700 paces, and in that of the clay slates 
someljiOO. 

PYNAMIC METAMORPHISM.

ated structure in gueisses and schists, together with its relation to the 
original bedded structure, where such existed, has received a good share 
of attention, particuhirlj^ from British i)etrographers, and some very 
interesting and instructive results have been obtained. That a massive 
eruptive rock of the composition of gabbro may through dynamic agen- 
cies undergo structural changes, including a paramori)hism of its py- 
roxenic constituent, and give rise to schistose dioritic forms, was first 
conclusively shown in America by the researches of Williams* on the 
gabbros in the vicinity of Baltimore, Maryland, and for several years 
there has been a growing feeling among petiologists that the schistose 
structure in many of the so called metamorphic rocks (meaning meta- 
morphosed sedimentary deposits) was not due to or in any way con- 
nected with an original bedding, but that these rocks were in reality of 
eruptive origin. That this is to a certain extent a correct supposition 
may now be considered as settled beyond disjjute so far as it is applied 
to certain limited areas. How general this mode of origin may have 
been and how far it is applicable to the great group of distinctly banded 
Archfeau schists and gneisses is as yet largely conjectural, and few 
would care to claim it as universal. That such structures are in any 
way indicative of bedding and consequent sedimentary origin has been 
vigorously combated by Lawson,t who finds similar structures in rocks 
of undoubted eruptive origin in the Kainy Lake region of Canada. 
Lawson, however, regards the structure as due to pressure supplied 
not by orographic movements but by expansion in the erupted mass 
itself during the process of consolidation, a view which is somewhat at 
variance with that held by other investigators. Teall| has shown that 
the banded rocks of the Lizard district include granite, diorite, and 
gabbro ; are, in short, rocks of igneous origin, and their banded structure 
due to the deformation to which the original rock masses have been 
subjected. Bonney,§ too, has given it as his opinion that the foliated 
glaucophane schist of the Isle de Groix is an eruptive altered by pres- 
sure. His conclusions from a study of this rock, together with the 
gneisses of the district around Quimperle and the gneisses, granites, and 
amphibolites of the Koscott" and Morlaix districts, were to the effect 
that while both igneous and stratified rocks have undergone a certain 
amount of pressure metamorphism, the igneous rocks being converted 
into gneisses and schists, yet many of them evidently possessed a true 
foliation prior to the earth movements. Callaway || has likewise con- 
tended in favor of the igneous origin of many of tiie gneisses and schist- 
ose rocks of the Malvern Hills; [)roof to this effect being afforded by

theintense contortion of included granitic veins and by other mechanical 
effects recojjnized in the rocks when studied by the microscope. Messrs. 
Fox and Toall* liuve in like manner accounted for the local develop- 
ment of actinolite schists out of the intrusive greenstones on some of 
the outlying islands of the Tjizard. 

But some of the most remarkable results of dynamic metamori)hisni 
are those described by menjbers of the Scottish Geological Survey t as 
occurring in the northwest highlands of that country. In the Archreau 
areas of this region it is shown (i) that a great series of igneous rocks, 
including gabbros, iicridotites, paheo-picrites, and <[uartz diorites, in 
which i)egmatite and segregation veins had formed, have, owing to me- 
chanical movements, developed a foliated structure and become con- 
verted into gneisses ; (ii) that basic dik(\s injected into these rocks sub- 
sequeut to their foliation have been by similar movements converted — 
(1) the dolerites into diorites and hornblende schists, (2) the peridotites 
into talcose schists, {3) the microcline mica rocks into mica schists, and 
(4) the granites into granitoid gneisses, these gneisses being still further 
foliated by subse«iueut movements. This change in the dike rocks is 
in i^art molecular and in part chemical. The molecular change of aug- 
ite into hornblende has afforded the transition of diabase into diorite. 
Where lines of movement coincide with the margins of one of the doler- 
ite dikes it has usually happened that portions of the outer part, it may 
be but a few inches or feet, are converted into a hornblende schist, and 
a further stage of change is met when a broad dike is traversed by sev- 
eral lines of shearing, in which case lenticular or eye-shaped masses of 
diorite are formed, around \vhich curve in wavy lines beautiful bands 
of hornblende schist. In tlie iinal stages the eyes disappear, and the 
whole of the original dike is converted into a zone of hornblende schist 
"consisting mainly of hornblende and secondary feldspar, with a small 
quantity of mica. This alteration has been attended with the formation 
of segregations of vitreous quartz, and in the extreme cases by a com- 
plete reconstruction of the adjacent gneisses. The latter alteration in- 
cludes a production of secondary foliations and a more or less complete 
reconstruction of the rock, the opalescent quartz granites having become 
elongated and also clear and vitreous ; black mica having been devel- 
oped out of the original hornblende, a white mica out of the original 
feldspar, and a recrystallization of hornblende in the form of actinolite 
needles having taken place, together with a beautiful development of 
secondary feldspars. 

Igneous rocks intrusive in Cambrian and Silurian strata are described 
as having likewise undergone metamorphism, in one case a porpliyritic 
felsite being converted into a ftne-grained schist, quartzite into soft 
sericite schist, hue-grained diorites in limesto!ies being represented by 
green hornblende and chlorite schists. Pegmatite is described as de-

B, Lotti* claims to Lave traced the white and veined saccharoidal 
marbles of Carrara and the adjacent Apennines back into their un- 
changed forms containing fossils characteristic of the Upper Trias and 
Muschelkalk. This metamorj)hism is ascribed wholly to the orographic 
movements accompanying the uplifting of the mountain range. The 
same agencies transformed the argilo-siliceous beds into mica-chloritic, 
ottrelitic or other crystalline schists comparable with those of Archiean 
age. 

MISCELLANY. 

The study of the interesting group of Peridotites assumed an almost 
sensational aspect early in 1887 through the announcement by the late 
H. Carvill Lewis f to the effect that the diamond-bearing rock of the 
Kimberly, South Africa, mines was a peridotite containing numerous 
fragments of a highly carbonaceous shale, and that the diamonds were 
doubtless secondary crystallization products due to the action of the 
molten rock upon the amorphous carbon contained by them. In view 
of the fact that Mr. J. S. Diller J had but recently described a some- 
what similar peridotite cutting carbonaceous shales in Elliott County, 
Kentucky, the suggestion offered by Mr. Lewis's paper seemed of sufl&- 
cient promise to warrant the sending of Messrs. Diller and Kunz once 
more to the latter locality in the hopes of finding confirmatory results. 

The fact that no diamonds were here found is ascribed to the paucity 
of the shale in carbonaceous matter, Mr. Whitfield's analyses showing 
but 0.G81 per cent, of this material against 37.521 per cent, in the shale 
of Kimberly. § 

Close upon the heels of this discovery comes the announcement of 
the discovery by Professors Latschinof and Jerofeief of diamonds in a 
meteoric stone found at Krasuosbbodsk, government of Penza, Kussia. 

If more proof were needed that serpentine never occurs as an original 
deposit, but is always a product of the alteration of other minerals, this 
has been abundantly furnished in two rather striking instances in this 
country. A heavy dark dull green serpentinous rock occurring in the 
Onondaga salt group at Syracuse, New York, and which had been in- 
vestigated by Dr. Hunt || and pronounced by him as an undoubted 
aqueous deposit, as typically illustrative and confirmatory of his theory

tlie origin of dianurnds, while Maskelyne still earlier announced that the diamonds

of the purely chemical origin of the mineral, has been investigated by 
Dr. George H. Williams and proven beyond doubt to be an altered 
peridotite, and eruptive. The second and equally striking case of the 
secondary origin of the mineral has been furnished by the present 
writer,* who investigated the well-known serpentine locality', Montville, 
]Sew Jersey. The stone occurs here associated with a coarsely crystal- 
lized dolomite in such a wa.y as to at once declare an origin from some 
other source than from an igneous rock. The mineral proved here to 
be also metasomatic, "a product of indefinite substitution and replace- 
ment," after a non-aluminous pyroxene near diopside in composition. 
The occurrence is so strikingly like that of the serpentines associated 
with calcareous rocks, as described by Dr. Hunt, and also the serpen- 
tine of the well-known eozoon, as to render it almost a foregone conclu- 
sion that in all these cases the serpentinous material is of similar origin. 

The number of mineral species recognized as occurring either as acci- 
dental or essential constituents in rock masses is naturally found to 
increase as the rocks are studied in greater detail and as methods and 
instruments are brought to greater perfection. Professor Eosenbusch, 
in his Hulfstabellen zur Mikroskopischen Mineralbestimmung, gives 
upwards of one hundred and seventy varieties, of which the optical and 
micro chemical properties are sufiQciently well known for their determina- 
tion in the thin section. Among the more interesting occurrences of 
the rarer or little noticed of these may be mentioned the following: 

The rare manganese epidote or piedmontite has been described by 
Prof. Bundjiro Kotot as a characteristic constituent of certain schists 
of unexpectedly wide distribution in the ArchiBan system of Japan. 
The typical piedmontite schist is described as consisting essentially 
of piedmontite associated with fine quartz grains and with accessory 
muscovite, greenish-yellow garnet, rutile, feldspar (probably orthoclase), 
blood-red iron glance, and also opaque crystals of the same mineral. 
The glaucophane rocks also carry it to some extent. The same mineral 
has also been noted by Professor Haworth as occurring sparingly in the 
quartz porphyries of southwestern Missouri in the United States. The 
allied mineral allanite, first noted as a common constituent of many 
granites by Messrs. Cross and Iddiugs, has been observed by Cross | 
as a constituent of the quartz porphyries of the Leadville region, and 
has also been described by W. H. Hobbs § in the form of parallel inter- 
growth with epidote, as a characteristic constituent of a granite porphyry 
from Ilchester, Maryland. Graefit|| has noted the presence of laavenito 
in the elseolite syenites of Brazil. Cohen ^ calls attention to the fact

that andahisite, a mineral considered as normally a product of con- 
tact metamorpliisiu in the crystalline schists, is in microscopic forms 
a by no means rare constituent of the true granites. Williams * de- 
scribes for the first time in this country the presence of pleonast (her- 
cynite) as occurring in the norites of the Hudson River region, Xew 
York, and also perowskite as a microscopic constituent of the altered 
l)eridotite at Syracuse, in the same State. A more interesting discov- 
ery than any of the above is that of the occurrence of leucite, hitherto 
found only in recent lavas, in some paleozoic eruptions of Brazil, as an- 
nounced by Derby.t Schmidt has noted for the first time the altera- 
tion of olivine in a melaphyr from the Swiss Alps into a bastitelike 
substance. Williams | has noted the occurrence of rutile secondary 
after ihnenite in a decomposed diabase from the Big Quinnesec Falls 
of the Menominee River, Wisconsin. That, however, these are in fact 
alteration products Cathrein denies. § This last-named authority has 
also described || an interesting case of the occurrence of plagioclase 
pseudomorphous after garnets in a garnet amphibolite from the Swiss 
Alps. The mineral cordierite, as an essential constituent of rock 
masses, has for the first time in America been observed by Hovey^ in 
a gneiss occurring near Guilford, Connecticut. 

The secondary" enlargement of the mineral particles of fragmental 
rocks as described by Tiirnebolim, Sorby, Irving, and Van Hise, has be- 
come a matter of almost daily observation. Such growths are not, 
however, confined to clastic rocks. Becke has described a case of sec- 
ondary enlargements of the hornblende in massive eruptive rocks, and 
Van Rise ** has described a like secondary grov,th of hornblende upon 
both hornblende and augites in certain Wisconsin diabases. Lastly, 
the present writer has described tt a case of the secondary enlargement 
of augites by fresh deposition of augitic material in a peridotite from 
Little Deer Isle, on the coast of Maine.

A very important paper, dealing with the chemical composition and structure 
of obsidians, mainly of the Yellowstone Park. There is shown to be in these 
obsidians a gradual passage from puniiceous to lithodal and porphyritic, rhyo- 
litic, and often more or less spherulitic forms. The obsidian cliff llow is especiailly 
remarkable for its extent and thickness, being equaled only by certain Mexican 
occurrences. So far as known, it is the only occurrence in which a columnar 
structure is developed. The absolute freshness of the rock, and absence of sec- 
ondary alteration products, affords excellent opportunity for the study of the 
phenomena of cry.stallization. The results obtained have been in part alluded to

Discusses the structures of the crystalline shists and their probable origin ; 
their age, to what extent crystalline and sedimentary rocks are atfected by intru- 
sive masses and the resemblance of such secondai-y structures to gneisses and 
schists commonly regarded as of Archtean age. The rocks carry, besides glauco- 
phane, abundant garnets, epidote, green hornblende, white mica, quartz, sphene, 
rutile, and hematite. They are commonly schistose in structure and occasionally 
banded, the banding being produced by a predominance of epidote or sometimes 
glaucophane. The rocks are sometimes extraordinarily rich in glaucophaue, 
though the individual crystals are not generally large. The wiiter agrees with 
Dr. Barrois, that the crystallization of the mineral has taken place since the folia- 
tion of the rocks, as they show no signs of strain or fracture. The garnets, on the 
other hand, existed prior to the foliation, as witnessed by their shattered conditi<m. 
The rock appears iuterstratified with the adjacent schists; but, nevertheless. Pro- 
fessor Bonney is inclined to regard it as an eruptive, altered by pressure. He has 
further tlescri bed the gneisses of the district around QuimperM with especial ref- 
erence to their original and seccmdary structures, and the gneisses, granites, and 
amphibolitos of the Roscoft" and Morlaix district. His conclusions are that while 
both igneous and stratified rocks have undergone a certain amount of pressure 
mctamorpliism, the igneous rocks being converted into gneisses and schists, yet 
many of the Brittany gneisses and schists were evidently true foliated rocks 
anterior to the earth movements. Contact metamorphism produced by igneous 
rocks on the Paleozoic sediments does not produce rocks which resemble the pre- 
sumable Archaian gneisses and schists.

Contends that the ancient gneisses of Galsvay (Ireland) display evidence of 
having been formed in part from mixtures of diorite and granite, similar to the 
more modern " diglomerates." 

The above-iiuoted author has also contended (same journal, p. 530) that many of 
the gneissic and schistose rocks of the Malvern Hills are formed out of igneous 
materials and owe their foliated structure to regional pressure, as proven by the 
intense contortion of granitic veins and by the mechanical effects recognized in 
the rocks uiuler the microscope.

Describes with some detail the macroscopic and microscopic structure of this

ture through merely mechanical agencies. Regards it as produced by a forcing up 
of a semi-plastic granite porphyry mass through faults in the overlying rock where 
it was subjected to enormous pressure. Before final consolidation took place, 
minor and subsidiary eruptions took place, which forced new supplies of granitic 
material into fissures formed in the previously injected rocks, and this fresh mate- 
rial consolidated under conditions somewhat different from those of the first 
eruptions.

Describes from the Tyrolian Alps a series of six rocks, comprising: (1) Staurolite 
mica schists, (2) garnet amphibolites, (3) pyroxenic serpentines, (4) tourmaline 
granite, (5) porphyrites, and (6) pitchstone pori)hyry. The garnet amphibolite 
is interesting mainly from its pseudomorphs of plagioclases after garnets. The 
serpentines are derived from diallage, brouzite or enstatite, and are appropriately 
named pyroxene serpentine. The porphyrites are classed as hornblende, uralite, 
mica, and garnet porphyrites ; the last are characterized by the occurrence of 
numerous reddish brown garnets, the largest of the dimensions of a hemp-seed, 
and with channeled and rounded faces shown to be due to oscillatory combina- 
tions of dodecahedral with icositetrahedral forms. The pitchstone pori)hyry 
presents a micro-crystalline or micro-felsitic ground-mass with fluidal struct, 
lire with orthoclase and oligoclase porphyritically developed and more rarely 
quartz aud biotite. It occurs in the form of independent dikes and stocks, 
oftenof considerable size, cutting the prevailing (luartz-porphyry and present- 
ing sharply defined borders without transitions between the two anywhere dis- 
cernable.

The rocks described are quartz-porphyries, diorites, porphyrites, rhyolites, 
trachytes, and andesites. One of the more interesting rocks of the series is the 
uevadite variety of the rhyolite. The sauidins of this rock often show a beauti- 
ful satin-like luster, which is shown to be " due to the interfereuce of light iu 
passing films of air between tlie extremely thin jjlates," info which the crystals 
are divided by a series of partings parallel to the lustrous surface. Drusy cavi- 
ties in the rock contain topaz iu very perfectly developed forms. The andesites 
are in part hypersthenic, as previously described in Bull. No. 1, U. S. Geological 
Survey. The quartz jiorphyries frequently carry the mineral allanite.

phonolite yet known in the United States.* The rock has not as yet been found 
iu situ., but in the form of bowlders of " local oiigin." and " apparently derived 
from the hills to the southward," and on the eastern slope of the Hayilen 
divide. 



* The only other known locality for this rock in the United States is the Black Hills 
of Dakota, whore it was described by Caswell in 1880.

Cross, Whitman Ou some eruptive rocks from Custer Couuty, Colorado. Proc.

The rocks described are, (1) rhyolites, with primary corroded garuets ; (2) 
trachytes, apparently allied to the so-called sauidiu-oligoclase trachytes of the 
Siebeugebirge in Germany; (3) syenites; (4) peridotites, containing essential 
hornblende and hypersthene, with accessory biotite, plagioclase, apatite, pyrrho- 
tite, and sillimanite ; (f)) augite diorite, containing olivine; (6) sanidin bearing 
audesite, in which the oligoclase crystals are nearly always surrounded by a zone 
of orthoclase.

Derby, Orville A. On nepheline rocks in Brazil, with special reference to the as- 
sociation of phonolite and foyaite. Quar. Jour. Geol. Soc, No. 171, August, 
1887, vol. XLiii, p. 457. 

Describes the geological occurrence aud, to a certain extent, the lithologieal 
characters of some peculiarly interesting nepheline and lencito rocks in the prov- 
inces of Rio de Janeiro, Silo Paulo, and Minas-Geraes, Brazil. The more striking 
features of the paper are the conclusions reached regarding the relations of the 
phonolites and foyaites (eheolite syenite), the phonolite not only showiug in- 
clusions of foyaite, but also the foyaite containing inclusions of phonolite, all 
appearances indicating that they are both portions of the same magma ; that, in 
short, the phonolite occurs as a peripheral facies of the foj'aite. A second re- 
markable feature is the occurrence of leucite in rocks of undoubted paleozoic age. 
The full significance of these discoveries may be best comprehended by those 
not specialists in this lino of work if it be stated that the eheolite syenites are 
deep-seated or plutonic rocks of paleozoic age, and of which the phonolites have 
been considered the etfusive tertiary or post-tertiary equivalents. Moreover the 
mineral leucite np to this time has been fouud as a constituent only of post-ter- 
tiary lavas. The two discoveries, it will be observed, having a vei'y inijioriant 
bearing upon the subject of rock history and classification, aud bringing once 
more proof of the utter impossibility of relying upon mineral composition or 
structure as a guide to geological age. The conclusions reached by Dr. Derby 
may be best understood by quoting the author's exact words. He feels convinced 
of, (1) the substantial identity as regards mode of occurrence and geological age 
of the Caldas phonolites and foyaites ; (2) the connection of the latter through 
the phonolites with a typical volcanic series containing both deep-seated and 
aerial types of deposits; (3) the equal, if not greater, antiquity of the leucite 
rocks as compared with the nepheline rocks, whether felsitic as phonolite, or 
granitic as foyaite; and (4) the probable paleozoic age of the whole eruptive se- 
ries.

Describes the eruptive rocks in tbe vicinity of Pilot Knob and Iron Mountain, 
Missouri. These consist of (1) grauite, (2) porphyries and porphyrites, (3) dia- 
bases and diabase porphyrites. The quartzes of tbe granites show often a de- 
cided approach to an idiomorphic structure and the orthoclases, in places, sec- 
ondary enlargements. Topaz was found in slides from near the mineral veins. 
A large share of the rocks is described as quartz porphyries and porphyrites, in 
some of which occurs the rare manganese epidote piedmontite.

The principal features are a mass of Archiean gneissoid rocks consisting of 
qnartz, feldspars, dark green or black hornblende and microscopic apatites and 
sphenes. This is overlaid by a hornbleudic schist consisting of alternating bands 
of very pure hornblende and feldspathic material with occasional quartzes. This 
rock often shows false bedding and is regarded as a possibly metamorphosed vol- 
canic ash. This in its turn is overlaid by a mass of granitic or syenitic igneous 
rock. The whole subsequently cut by a series of dikes including quartz-felsite, 
diabases, and kersantites.

Schmidt, C. Diabasporphyrite und Melaphyre vom Nordabhang der Schweizer 
Alpen. Neues Jahib. Miu., Geol., etc., 1887, i. Band, erstes Heft, p. 58. 

Describes a diabase |)orphyrite and melaphyr presenting certain interesting 
features. The porphyrite occurs, cutting Eocene strata in its three typical varie- 
ties, as a dense, dirty, grayish green, in places dark violet mottled or A'eined rock 
carrying small nests of calcite. In the thin section it is pronouncedly porphyritic, 
with long, slender plagioclases, which from their small extinction angles are sup- 
posed to be oligoclase. The groundmass consists of augite and feldspars, some- 
times grouped in tuft's or with a tendency toward spherulitic structure. The 
feldspars contain inclosures of the amorphous base, often showing a mere vein 
of feldspar substance. The second variety is of a gray green color, and badly 
altered, only the feldspars being recognizable while the base has gone over to 
chloritic material, and granules of opacite, calcite, and chlorite abound. The third 
variety is a reddish brown dense rock which the microscope shows to consist of a 
confused aggregate of oligoclase leistens with interstitial irregularity developed 
augites. The stone therefore presents all the characters of the pre-Tertiary por- 
phyrites, although, as above iu)ted, of post-Eocene age. The melaphyr is also of 
interest as containing olivine, which has undergone alteration iuto a bastite-like 
substance, hero noted for the lirst time.

EECENT PROGRESS IN DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 



By Cleveland Abbe. 



PREFACE. 



The previous summaries of progress in meteorology tbat I have pub- 
lished since 1S71 have each in its turn more or less imperfectly cov- 
ered the whole field of meteorology, but it has not seemed wise for me in 
the preseut summary to endeavor to compass a science which is now so 
rapidly enlarging in all directions. Several reasons have led me to 
this conclusion, among which I may mention, first, the fact that the 
American Journal of Meteorology, published at Ann Arbor, Mich., and 
which is now in its fifth year, has, since the publication of my sum- 
mary for 1884, endeavored to keep its American readers fully acquainted 
with the progress in all branches of our subject, while the German 
Zeitschrift, published at Hamburg, and which is now in the sixth year 
of its succession to the Austrian Zeitschrift, accomplishes the same ob- 
ject for German readers in the most exhaustive manner, and is of course 
widely circulated in this country. Again, as regards recent progress 
in instrumental meteorology, American readers will perhaps find a 
sufficiently complete statement of the present condition of that subject 
in my Treatise published in December, 1888, as part ii of the annual re- 
portoftheChief Signal Officer for 1887. Finally, asmy own studieshave 
during the past year been almost wholly directed to the dynamical 
phenomena that are offered to us in the movements of the atmosphere, 
and as these are undoubtedly by far the most important questions that 
come before the practical meteorologist, and are those about which most 
numerous inquiries are made (or rather by means of which innumera- 
ble popular questions must be answered), I have in the preseut sum- 
mary endeavored to give an account of the important works that have 
apjjeared up to December, 1888, on the movements of storms and the 
general motions of the atmosphere, reserving for a next report some 
equally important papers that have come to hand since that date. 

Some of these memoirs are so important and so little accessible to 
American readers, that not content with a popular summary, I have pre- 
pared full translations of them, which will be printed in the present, or 
a following Report, in the confident hope and expectation that A merican 
wathematicians,physicists,and meteorologists may thus be stimulated to

prosecute further studies in the directions indicated by the most success- 
ful European students. At first sight these original memoirs and even 
the popular summaries may appear mathematical and repugnant to the 
ordinary meteorological observer, but meteorology, like astronomy, em- 
ploys a wide range of talent. If the observer and the computer are 
needed in both, so also are the physicist and mathematician ; in both 
cases we have to do not merely with the superficial phenomena of 
nature, but also with the fundamental laws that underlie these and a 
process of severe thought is needed in the discovery and the applica- 
tion of these laws. It seems to have been conceded by all that meteoro- 
logical phenomena, at least those which depend on the motions of the 
atmosphere, are too difficult to be unraveled at present, but during the 
past few years the application of thermodynamics has been so helpful, 
and the study of fluid motions, whether discontinuous or steady, has 
made such advances as to justify the belief that we may begin to build 
a lasting superstructure of dynamic and rational deductive meteorology. 
But such a work needs the co-operation of many minds. 

The fundamental factors in meteorology and climatology are the 
forces of heat and gravity; the figure, rotation, and inequalities of the 
earth ; the circulation of vapor, and its latent heat; all this is summed 
up in " the thermo dynamics and hydro dynamics of our atmosphere." 

For ages mankind has relegated to evil and good spirits, to chance, 
to instinct or will, to the stars, the planets, the comets, and the moon, 
to the fates, to sun-spots, to electricity, and to every other form of su- 
perstition the explanation of our complex phenomena, because, in our 
despair, we were not able to comprehend the possibilities of the simple 
laws of mechanics. The labors of hydraulic engineers in handling the 
turbulent flow of rivers ; of astronomers in treating the motion of the 
planets; of chemists in unraveling the mysteries of compound bodies; 
of physicists in explaining the phenomena of light, heat, and electricity ; 
of mathematicians in resolving the difficulties attending the treatment 
of complex functions, were all needed as preparatory to successful 
attacks upon the laws of the motions of the atmosphere. May the pres- 
ent summary be tbe means of enlisting the co-operation of universities 
and their patrons, professors and their students, in a work that prom- 
ises results so important to human welfare. 

The few memoirs that I have summarized in the following pages as 
having important bearings on our knowledge of the atmosphere and its 
storms are to be classified as follows :

I.— LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS ON FLUID MOTION. 

The imitation in laboratory experiments of natural motions of the 
atmosphere offers an instructive and fascinating field for research. 
Among those who have contributed to this subject are: 

(1) Hebnholtz, in 1857, first solved analytically the problems of vortex 
motion, and in 1868 those of jets, both being illustrations of general 
propositions in discontinous motions. Kirchlioff immediately followed 
with solutions of other cases, and since then W. Thomson, J. J. Thom- 
son, Eayleigh, Hicks, and other English writers, Oberbeck, Planck, 
Zo])pritz, Bertrand, Boussiuesq, Saint Vincent, and others, have added 
to these conquests of analysis. The experimental illustrations and 
verifications of their results have been especially due, as regards jets 
in liquids, to Savart 1833, Bidone 1838, Eayleigh 1879, Oberbeck 1877, 
Eeynolds 1883, and as regards jets and whirls in air to Vettin 1857 
to 1887, CoUadou and Weyher 1887, 

(2) Oberhecl: — As long ago as 1877 this mathematician, by careful 
experiments, reproduced the results analytically obtained by himself 
and predecessor, all of which will be found in the appended translation 
of his memoir on discontinuous motions. These jets in water have a 
close analogy to the columns of warm air that rise in the atmosphere. 

(3) Vettin, of Berlin, whose work began 185G, and whose first publi- 
cation was in Poggendorff's Annalen of 1857, met with an opposition 
from Dove, that seems to have inspired him with the resolution to ob- 
serve and experiment until all doubt was settled. Consequently, we 
owe to Vettin a remarkable series of observations on clouds and most 
instructive experiments, illustrating the whole convective process by 
which heat and moisture are carried by the air from the ground to the 
upper atmosphere, and inversely the dryness, cold and motion of the 
upper air brought down to us. Vettin's latest contributions are in the 
volumes of the Meteorologische Zeitschrift for 1887. 

(4) Bezold, who, in 18SG, was called from Municli to Berlin to take 
charge of the reorganized Meteorological Institute of Prussia, has pub- 



358 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

lished the account of some carefully executed experiments on vortices 
and other motions in water, illustrating points in the movements in the 
air. 

(5) CoUadon and Weyher. — As to experimental work in circular vor- 
tices nothing has been more interesting than that done on a large scale 
in 1887 by CoUadon at Geneva, and Weyher at Paris. 

Coliadon used a simple apparatus for producing vortices and arti- 
ficial whirlwinds and water-spouts both in water and in air. A more 
effective apparatus was constructed by Weyher, in which a great variety 
of interesting vortical phenomena were produced, illustrating what 
might happen in the free atmosphere if only the conditions were the 
same. He established a drum, rapidly revolving about a vertical axis, 
which therefore set in motion the surrounding air of the room or other 
inclosure. If the drum is at the top of the iuclosure, the air thrown 
out from it descends along the sides of the room, while, in the center im- 
mediately below the drum, a rapid spiral or corkscrew movement exists 
inward and upward. Water contained iu a vessel in the middle of the 
room is set in motion by the air, and some drops are even carried up- 
ward through the ascending core, thus approximately imitating the 
lower end of a water-spout, and showing how spouts and tornadoes 
originating iu the clouds settle downwards to the earth. Many modi- 
fications of his apparatus have been made by Weyher, illustrating many 
problems iu vortex motion, aiul which are valuable for the comparison 
with the analytical formulie of hydro-dynamics, but which have only 
indirect bearing on meteorological phenomena. They, however, serve 
to remove from the mind any difiQculties that may have been experienced 
by those who hesitate to admit the importance of vortex motion in 
meteorology. 

(6) Reynolds. — Among the investigations into the motions of fluids, 
that made by Prof. Osborne Keynolds, on " the two modes of mo- 
tion of water," has had a peculiar interest for me and seems generally to 
be regarded as one that has contributed decidedly to our knowledge of 
the conditions under which steady motion and eddying or vortex and 
wave motions take place. Reynolds's paper is published iu the London 
Philosophical Transactions of 1883. In his annual address, November 
30, 1888, Professor Stokes says of it: "The dimensions of the terms iu 
the equations of motion of a fluid, when viscosity is taken into account, 
involve, as has been previously pointed out, the conditions of dynamical 
similarity iu geometrically similar systems in which the motion is regu- 
lar; but when the motion becomes eddjing it seemed no longer to be 
amenable to matnematical treatment. But Professor Reynolds has 
shown that the same conditions of similarity hold good as to the aver- 
age effect even when the motion is of the eddying kind ; and moreover 
that if in one system the motion is on the border between steady and 
eddying, in another system it will also be on the border, provided this 
system satisfies the above conditions of dynamical as well as geometri-

cal similarity. The resistance to the flow of water in channels and con. 
(luits usually depends mainly on the formation of eddies, and though 
we can not determine mathematically the actual resistance, yet the ap- 
plication of the above proposition leads to a formula for the flow in 
which there is a most material reduction in the number of constants, 
for the determination of which we are obliged to have recourse to ex- 
periment." 

(7) Eagen. — No experimental work has been done on the absolute re- 
sistance of the air to bodies moving through it superior to that of the 
eminent liydrauliciau H. Hagen, of Berlin ; a translation of whose mem- 
oir will be given in the series previously referred to, because of the fre- 
quent inquiries that are made of me as to his results. 

But in applying Hagen's observed pressures to other surfaces, or other 
angles of incidence than those used by him, great mistakes are liable to 
be made, and the student should consult the chapter on anenometers 
and wind pressure in the " Treatise on Meteorologial Apparatus," Ee- 
port of the Chief Signal Officer for 1887, part ir, or the excellent mem- 
oir of St. Tenant, quoted below, if he would avoid serious errors. 

(8) Eummer. — Allied to the problem of resistance, treated of by 
Hagen, for plates normal to the wind, is that of plates inclined to the 
wind, which is one that is specially important in problems relating to 
gunnery, sailing, flying, and the construction of windmills. On this 
matter Kummer has made a serious of experimental determinations of 
the center of pressure for a thin flat plate when struck by the wind at 
special angles of incidence. 

Although his revised results were published in 187G in the Berlin 
Abhandlungeu yet they seem unknown in America, and I have therefore 
re-arranged them in the following table. Kummer's final measurements 
were made on six stift" glass plates of the following shapes and dimen- 
sions :

The center of pressure is the point at which the plate must be sup- 
ported in order to remain (piietly balanced when the wind is blowing 
upon it at a given inclination. These points are always in front of 
the center of figure, or between it and the windward edge. 

The distance between the two centers is given in the column C ; the 
angle between the wind and the i)late is given in the column a. At 
first thought one would be inclined to convert the C, as given in milli-

meters, iuto decimal fractions of the whole leugth of the plate, and apply 
the correspondinft- angles to similar plates of any size. 

This can be done in the case of the square plate A, by simply multi- 
Inlying its sides and its C by two, and thus obtaining the column 2A, 
as if for a square 180""" on a side. If the reasoning were correct then 
the a in the column 2A should be comparable with those extrapolated 
from B and C, but the relation between them is not simple, so that care 
must be taken in applying this data to other cases.

phenomena of barometric maxima and minima. — The Urst and second 
chapters of the revised edition of Loomis's contributions to meteorology, 
although printed in New Haven in 1885 and 1887, respectively, for pri- 
vate distribution in Europe mostly, will not be generally accessible to 
American readers until they appear in permanent form in the forth-

coming- volume IV of the Memoirs of the National Academy of Science. 
Ah ail early eoi)y of the i)rivate edition has fallen into the hands of Brs. 
Van Bebber and W. Koeppen, the latter has given a condensed review 
of both chapters more perspicuous than the mass of details given in the 
original. We shall do our readers a favor by laying this before them; 
and the more so inasmuch as the labor bestowed by Koeppen and his 
occasional criticisms as reviewer enhance the value of his work. This 
constitutes a most condensed summary of the results to dynamic meteor- 
ology of the statistics published daily by the U. S. Signal Service. 

Barometric maxima. — The isobars around a barometric maximum 
are of irregular, more or less elliptical, form. The ratio of the greatest 
to the least axis of the ellipse, as determined by Loomis from three years' 
observations for North America, for Europe and the Atlantic Ocean, is, 
respectively, 1.91 for 238 cases in North America, and 1.81 for 252 cases 
in Europe and on the Ocean. In a third of all these cases this ratio was 
more than 2. The same number is also found by Loomis for the ratio 
of the similar axes in areas of barometric minima. The direction of the 
longest axis with reference to the meridian is also demonstrated to vary 
very little in the two regions, being as shown in the accompanying 
table :

the Alhiutic 

Ocean. 




N. 44° E . . . . 


N. 75^ E. 




N. 36° E . . . . 


N. 35"^ E. 





The more easterly direction of the axes of the minima on the ocean 
and in Europe is by Loomis attributed to the frequent formation of a 
ridge of high pressure which in the colder half of the year connects the 
area of high pressure in Asia and the Azores. Three-fourths of the 
above cases are of this kind. 

Loomis subjects to a special investigation the especially intense baro- 
metric maxima. He collects these in three tables, of which the first one 
(Loomis No. XL) contains all cases in which, during the years 1872 to 
1884, a pressure of over 30.85 inches (783.6 millimeters) occurs at any 
station of the United States on the charts of the Signal Service; the 
second table (Loomis LVi) contains the cases in which, during the years 
1874, 1876, and 1881, an isobar of 785 millimeters occurs on the Hoti- 
nieyer charts, and their continuation by the Seewarte; the third table 
(Loomis LViii) contains those cases in which, during the interval from 
1877 to the beginning of 1884, an isobar of 31 inches (787.4 millimeters) 
occurs on the charts of the International Bulletin of the Signal Service, 
which comprehends the whole northern hemisphere. 

The anmial diiitrihut ion of these cases is given by the following tabular 
summary ; in whi(;h, of the double numbers, the first one gives the num-

ber of separate occasions on which high maxima occur, each one heiug 
separated from the other by intervening times of low pressure; the 
second number [in brackets] gives the number of charts on which they 
occur. With respect to these numbers it is necessary' to remember that 
for the United States (series a) there are three charts daily, but for 
Europe and the Atlantic Ocean (series h) two, and for the northern 
hemisphere one each day (series c). 

(a) Uuited States aud Canada. -1[3] 
{b) Europe and Atlantic Ocean. 2[4] 
(c) Northern hemisphere 1[1] 

In the other months of the year such high barometric readings do not 
occur. 

As concerns the geographical distribution over the surface of the earth, 
the maxima occurred as follows : 

Series {a). — Eighty-two per cent, west of 90° longitude (west of Green- 
wich), and the greater part north of 46° north latitude. 

Series (b). — Three-fourths were in Asia and only two on the Atlantic 
Ocean.* 

Series (c). — Of these eighty-one charts, seventy-four show the maxi- 
mum over Europe and Asia, six over North America, and one on the 
ocean west of Ireland. The station with the highest pressure occurred 
in Europe or Asia, always between latitude 50° and G0° north, with one 
exception, when it was at Taschkent; in thirty two cases it was at 
Jenisseisk (latitude o8°.5 north); in nine cases at Barnaul (53° north), 
and in seven cases at Kertschiusk (51° north), and the other seven at 
Semipalatinsk (50°.5 north). Within Europe proper such extreme 
maxima were observed only in European Eussia, and the centers oc- 
curred either at Wjatka, Kazan, Moscow, or Warsaw, the two latter 
only once each. Such high pressures occur very decidedly only in the 
centers of the continent and in the colder seasons of the year. 

For such of the areas of high pressure as could be followed for many 
days the following results are given : 

Series {a). — An average movement toward south 40° east, or, if we con- 
sider only the movement east of the Rocky Mountains, south 57° east, 
with a velocity of 21 English miles per hour (eight degrees of a great 
circle per daj ) ; the average movement of the maxima is therefore di- 
rected more southerly than that of the minima. 

Series (6). — In fourteen cases of long-continued high areas there were 
eleven where the last position lay more southerly than the first, and 

* On nineteen of these eighty-two charts, the highest isobar is 790, on five charts 
it is 795, and on one chart (January 1, 18761 it is 800 millimeters ; ou this day the 
maximum was at Omsk ; in the year 1877, for which the Hoffmeyer charts were not 
printed, there occurred a still higher barometer, on December 16, namely, 806.5 as 
reduced to sea-level, or unreduced 784.5, which is the highest atmospheric pressure 
that Loomis has found anywhere charted. 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 363 

eight wbere the last was more easterly thau the first, as opposed to three 
and five cases, respectivelj^, where the inovemeut was toward the north 
or west. 

Series (c). — For the maxima in this series, Loorais remarks that appar- 
entlj', by reason of small variations of the pressure of the air, the cen- 
ters appear to show rapid movements to and fro, but that in general, in 
the fourteen cases where the isobar of 31 inches continued for at least 
two days, the position on the last day did not differ materially from that 
on the first. 

The relative size of the barometric maxima in the United States was 
investigated by Loomis for the maxima of Series (a) (Loomis Table xii), 
with the assistance of the charts of the International Bulletin, but only 
since October, 1877, because the weather charts for the United States 
only did not cover enough ground to fully present these extended phe- 
nomena. The mean value of the smallest diameters of these regions of 
extraordinary high pressures measured between the isobars of 7G2 milli- 
meters is 2,587 miles, which is equal to the width of the American con- 
tinent at 40° north latitude. The mean distance of the centers of low 
pressures from the centers of maxima was 2,371 miles on the east side 
of the maxima and 2,381 miles on the west side ; the value of the lowest 
isobars in these measurements was 29.19 inches = 741.4 millimeters on 
the east side, and 29.57 inches = 751.1 millimeters on the west side; so 
that therefore the gradient was twice as great on the east side as on 
the west side. If we reduce the adopted superior limit from 30.85 to 
30.4, we find that the mean diameter of the maxima between 1877 and 
1884 that rise above this limit amounts to 1,406 miles, and that the ba- 
rometer in these is on the average 0.40 inch above its normal value. 
For the maxima above 30.85 these values become, respectively, 2,587 
miles and 0.75 inch. Since 0.75 : 0.40 = 2,5S7 : 1,380, therefore the 
diameters of the maxima are approximately proportional to their alti- 
tudes measured from the nornial value. 

Series [h]. — The mean diameter of the maxima of this series for which 
the isobar 7G0 millimeters is taken, is at least 2,740 miles, therefore 
larger than in the United States. The lowest isobar on the west side 
was on the average 739 millimeters — only in two cases was it less thau 
730 — whereas this is a frequent case on the Atlantic Ocean ; therefore 
here also an uncommon high pressure does not imply a remarkably low 
pressure in the neighborhood. The mean distance of the center of high 
pressure from that of low pressure on the west amounted to 2,280 miles, 
which indicates a somewhat greater gradient on the European side of

Series (c). — The mean diameter of the maxima of this series is 3,800 
miles in the north-south direction under 55° of north latitude, and 
4,900 miles in the east west direction. 

The temperature relations of the barometric maxima are quite thor- 
oughly investigated by Loomis. In the cold season of the year the

This shows thnt the higher the pressure by so much greater is the 
cold. The maxima of pressure and of cold, however, do not as a rule 
jccur at the same time and place, but lie ou the average 400 miles apart, 
and the greatest temperature departure ordinarily lies north of the high- 
est barometer. (This which holds for ISTorth America does not obtain in 
Europe. — W. K.) The temperature depression at the center is greater 
when the center lies west of 87° W. longitude than when it lies east 
thereof; for pressures of 30.85-inches the temperature depression is in 
the first case 28.8° F. (or 16o 0.) ; for the second case it is 24° F. (or 13.3o 
C). In three-fourths of all the cases in series (a) the thermometer at the 
center fell below 0° F. (or— 17.8° C). In twelve cases it fell to— 30° 
F. (or— 34.5° C). For the maxima of the series (b) for Europe, after 
excluding the two cases of the ocean, the mean temperature fell to 
—25.4° C, and the mean for the three winter months fell to— 28.0° C. 
For the maxima of the series (c), in so far as they occur over Europe 
and Asia, the departure from the normal was somewhat less, averaging 
— 19° F., or— 10.6° C, and the mean temperature was about the same, 
namely -28° C. 

For the average of all cases, whenever the thermometer at Jenisseisk, 
between 1870 and 1882, went below— 30° C, the barometer stood 7.8 
millimeters above its normal value, but only in one of these cases did 
the pressure exceed 787 millimeters. Therefore, extraordinary low tem- 
peratures are generally accompanied by high, but seldom by extremely 
high, barometric pressures. 

In the warmer season of the year the temperature in the center of the 
maxima is also generally below the normal, but only a little below. 
For the average of the cases where the pressure in the United States 
during 1873 to 1880 exceeds 30.35 inches (or 770.9 millimeters) the tem- 
perature was 8.3° F.=4.7o C. below the normal, and here also for places 
west of 87° longitude the depression is greater, /. c, 0.6° C., than for 
places on the east of that meridian, where it is 3.8° C.

In the interior of the United States the highest temperature of the 
summer usually occurs with a pressure that is decidedly below the mean 
value, but, on the other hand, on the Atlantic coast it occurs with a 
normal pressure. For the North Atlantic Ocean and Europe-Asia 
Loomis deduces from seven years^ observations the mean thermometric 
departures at the time of the monthly maxima of temperature for tlie 
months of June, July, and August, and for a number of stations. The 
average of the three mouths is given in the following table :

Therefore equally as in ]!?I^orth America, so also in the interior of the 
Europe-Asiatic continent, the greatest summer temperature occurs with 
a barometric pressure that is some millimeters below the normal value, 
while on the ocean and also rarely in the northern parts of the conti- 
nents, southward to Moscow and Kazan, the greatest summer tempera- 
tures occur, with relatively high pressure. 

Barometric minima. — In order to make the comparison more com- 
])lete between the areas of high and low pressure, Professor Loomis has 
also supplemented his work on the latter subject by a new collocation 
of data, and his Tables XLix and l give a summary of the minima 
under 29 inches (73G.6 millimeters) for the years 1873 to 1884 for the 
United States and Canada. His Table LVii gives a similar summary 
for the minima under 725 millimeters for the years 1873 to 187G and 
1880 and 1881 over the Atlantic Ocean and Europe according to the 
Hoffmeyer charts and the new synoptic charts, published jointly by the 
Danish Institute and the Seewarte. This is the same material quoted, 
respectively, as series a and b in the table of maxima given in the first 
part of this summary. The arrangement of the data taken from the 
International Bulletin of the Signal Service (series c) is carried out in a 
difterent manner by Loomis as regards the minima, in that he has in 
Table lxix given only the minima under 20 inches for the Pacific Ocean, 
and in Table lxiv those under 29.6 iuches (751.8 millimeters), and only 
for the winter sea.son for the Asiatic continent. The number and an- 
nual distribution of these comparatively deep minima, is as shown in

Only the first of these series, depending upon twelve years of records, 
can have any pretense of accurately presenting the normal annual rate. 
The remarkable double maximum of frequency with a diminution in the 
middle of winter will probably remain even in long series of observa- 
tions, and has its origin in the development of the continental area of 
high pressure in January and February. The small number of depres- 
sions under 29 inches in the Pacific Ocean is doubtless in part due to 
the insufficient data from this ocean for the first year, but Loomis shows 
that even in the last three years (summer of 1881 to the summer ot 
1884), where the number of observations was nearly sufficient, only 
nineteen cases below 736 millimeters occurred in the year, whilst on the 
Atlantic Ocean twenty-eight cases occurred annually below 725 milli- 
meters on the average of four years ; in the Pacific Ocean the barome- 
ter sank below this latter limit only five times in three years, so that 
such deep depressions occur sixteen times more frequently over the At- 
lantic than over the Pacific Ocean. This result is confirmed by another 
consideration: On the average of five years' observations at Stykkis- 
holm, in Iceland, the barometer fell below 725 millimeters on G.8 days 
annually, but in three years' observations in the Aleutian Islands only 
on one day annually. The lowest depression reported from the Pacific 
Ocean during seven years is 719 millimeters, but in the North Atlantic 
such depressions occur on the average about thirty times annually. 

As concerns the location of these barometric minima, Loomis finds 
that of one hundred and thirty-one in the first {a) series, one hundred 
and twelve occurred on the Atlantic coast, and only nineteen in the in- 
terior of North America ; that, therefore, the neighborhood of the ocean 
is an almost indispensable condition for these deep depressions. He 
presents the location of the one hundred and thirty-seven minima of 
series (h) on a chart that shows that three fourths of the total number 
occurred on the Atlantic Ocean or its coast, and that of the remaining 
cases ten occurred within 100 miles distant from the coast; seven at 
100 to 150 miles; and only one, January 15, 1881, at Moscow, occurred 
more than 150 miles from the coast. Within the area of the ocean more 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 367 

centers of depression occurred in the neighborhood of the coast than in 
its central portions, and four regions of greater frequency are especi- 
ally recognizable ; namely, Southern Greenland, west coast of Iceland, 
the islands north of Scotland, and the North Cape. This confirms in 
general the results that Koppen attained and presented graphically 
for all depressions without considering the depths (Zeitschrift Oester- 
reichisches Gesellschaft fiir Meteorologie, July, 1882).* 

Of the one hundred and sixteen winter days that show a barometric 
pressure in Asia below 752 millimeters, fifteen show such depressions 
simultaneously at many places; so that we have one hundred and 
thirty-one separate cases that are distributed as follows : Thirty-seven 
on the eastern coast of Asia and in Japan ; seventy-seven on the western 
border of Asia, namely, at Ekaterinburg, and seventeen in the interior 
of Asia, at Akmolinsk, Barnoul, or Jenisseisk. The minima of the first 
group seem to originate in the Pacific Ocean or on the coast. None of 
them appear to have come from the interior of the continent, or from a 
region north of latitude 62°, so that the numerous depressions that pass 
from west to east over the eastern part of North America seem to find 
no analogue in Eastern Asia. The minima of the second and third 
groups api)ear to progress from Northern Europe along a path directed 
somewhat south and east, and none of them pass eastward over Jen- 
isseisk, unless perhaps some of them are deviated northeastward be- 
yond the region occupied by the station. 

The highest isobar in the neighborhood of these depressions was on 
the average, in series {a) 30.29 inches (769.4 millimeters) on the west 
side, and 30.35 inches (770.9 millimeters) on the east side; in the series 
(b) the isobars of 785 millimeters and upwards occurred only twice on 
the west side, and twice on the east side of the depressions ; the maxima 
in the neighborhood of the deep minima therefore seldom attain ex- 
ceptional heights — a confirmation of what is above said for the maxima. 
The mean distance of the centers of these maxima from those of the de- 
pressions was in series (a) 2,130 miles on the east side of the depression, 
and 1,985 miles on the west side. The mean diameter of the depres- 
sions (namely between the isobars of 7G0 to 770 millimeters) Loomis has 
determined to be for the depressions of series (a) from the years 1877 to 
1884, 2,139, but for series (6) 2,365 miles. 

The mean of the temperatures at the centers of such barometric de- 
pressions as were lower than 737 millimeters, was G^A Fahr.,=3o.6 C, 
above the normal in the United States for the years 1873 to 1877; but the 
greatest excess of temperature did not occur here, but about 300 miles 
farther southerly or easterly, and on the average, for the cases that 
allowed of a satisfactory determination, amounted to 22^.3 Fahr., or 
10O.3 0.

368 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

These deep depressions belonged, as we have seen, almost exclusively 
to the colder period of the year; in order to investigate the tempera- 
ture of the summer depressions, Loomis has brought together the depres- 
sions with a central pressure less than 29.4 iuches (746.7 millimeters) 
for June, July, and August of the three years 1873, '74, '77. For these 
the average departure of the temperature from its normal value was 
+ G0.5 Fahr., or S^.G C. at the center of the depression and -f 20° Fahr. 
= lio.l 0. at the above-mentioned warmest point, therefore almost the 
same as in the winter depressions. 

For the minima of series (&) Loomis has determined only the temper- 
ature at the center, not its departure from the normal value; the for- 
mer is -f 4° C. (390.2 Fahr.), which is very high for the season and the 
latitude of most of these minima. 

Loomis has subjected to a thorough investigation the relation of the 
wind to the gradient. First, he selected from Hotiioeyer's synoptic 
charts eighty-one on which there appeared especially well-developed 
cyclones or anti-cyclones. For meteorologists who desire to submit to 
a special proof some notable examples, he calls attention to the cyclones 
of January 12, and December 21-22, 1875; January 22 and March 9 
and 10, 1870; and the anti-cyclones of December 30-31, 1875, and Jan- 
uary 1-2 and 13, 187C, Loomis says nothing as to his interpretation of 
the arrows iudicating the strength of the wind on Hofifmeyer's charts; 
under the assumption that he has properly considered the half-degree 
marks on the wind arrows of Hoffmeyer's charts, we can consider the 
mean strength of the wind deduced by him and given according to the 
''1 to 6'' scale as correct Beaufort degrees, siuce the wind estimates of 
both German and English navigators, on which these charts are based, 
arealike made on the Beaufort scale; on the other hand, if he has 
counted the half degree marks as full scale degrees, then all his figures 
for mean wind force, when they are uneven figures, are too large by 
one, and therefore his mean values for the whole series will be too large 
by one-half of a Beaufort degree. 

Loomis's results from Hoffmeyer's charts are summarized in the follow- 
ing table; the measurements were generally made on that side of the 
center where the strongest gradients and winds were found. The mean 
latitude of the centers of the cyclones was 58o.8 north, and that of the 
anticyclones 49^.7 north.

In ortler to determiue the same quantities also for the storms of the 
United States, Loomis has chosen thirty-six charts for cych)nes and 
thirty six for anti-cyclones out of the twelve thousand published by 
the Sig'ual Office since November, 1871, which gave him the following 
table of results. The mean latitude of the centers of these cyclones was 
110.7 north, that of the anticyclones 45o.l north.

370 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

These two tables contain a wealth of data for future deductions, but 
as to the results that Loomis draws from them, Koppen promises a fut- 
ure communication. 

III.— THEORETICAL HYDRO-DYNAMICS APPLIED TO THE MOTION OF 

THE AIR. 

(10) Koppen^ whose skill in studying? the mechanism of storms and 
in handling masses of data has so frequently been shown, has con- 
tributed to the Meteorological Zeitschrift of ])eceml)er, 1888, a study 
" On the form of the isobars in reference to their dependence ui)on alti- 
tude and the distribution of temperature." Assuming that isotherms 
and isobars have been given by the daily weather chart, he then gives a 
most convenient and rapid method of computing tables and deriving 
the isobars for any elevation, such as 2,500 meters, by an inspection of 
the tabular figures. Such upper isobars were first iniblished for a given 
storm by Moller in the Annalen fiir Hydrog., April, 1882. The impor- 
tance of such u])per isobars had been urged by nie in lS71-'72, and sam- 
ple maps were drawn preparatory to their daily use, but subsequently 
the introduction of departures and variations of departures in i)ressure 
and temperature as auxiliary to sea-level isobars and surface isotherms 
was decided on by General Myer. Koppeu's diagrams of ideal systems 
are very suggestive. 

(11) Ferrel. — In 188G there appeared a treatise by Prof. William Fer- 
rel, •' Eecent Advances in Meteorology," being Appendix 71, or part ii, 
of the Annual Report of the Chief Signal Officer for 1885. This treatise 
was originally designed as professional i^aper of the the Signal Service, 
No. 17, but the abolition of that series of papers by order of the Secre- 
tary of War caused a change in the method of publication. 

An abstract of the contents of this book was delivered in lectures by 
Professor Ferrel to the second lieutenants of the Signal Corps, but the 
abolition of the Signal-Service school of instruction at Fort Myer has 
prevented its further use in that direction. The comi)lete volume being 
easily obtained in this country, I need give only a short account of it. 

In this work Ferrel has collected the results of recent investigations 
by many authors, adding to them many of his owmi demonstrations, and 
combining the whole into a systematic treatise on meteorology under 
the following seven chapters: (1) The constitution and physical prop- 
erties of the atmosphere; (2) the temperature of the atmosphere and 
the earth's surface; (3) the general motions and pressure of the atmos- 
phere ; (4) cyclones ; (5) tornadoes ; (G) observations and their reduc- 
tions; (7) ocean currents and their meteorological effects. In the first 
chapter, after the sections on chemical constituents, pressure and 
weight, there comes a section on the diffusion and arrangement of the 
constituents, ihcluding the vapor atmosphere, followed by the ordinary 
applications to the atmosphere of the thermodynamics of adiabatic 
processes. In his section on the diathermancy and transparency of the 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 371 

air Ferrel gives especial attention to the effect of wave length upon the 
law of (liminutioa in a complex bnndle of rays, such as those from the 
snn, and shows that his formula and constants hold good for the visual, 
the tliermal, and the chemical effects of the solar rays. (A special mem- 
oir by him on radiation is published in the American Journal of Science, 
July, 1889.) 

In chapter 2, on temperature of the atmosphere, Ferrel gives an ex 
pression for the mean diurnal intensity of the sun's radiation developed 
into a series as a function of the sun's declination and the observer's 
latitude, which expression he also further converts into a series de. 
pending on the time and the observer's latitude. With this he then 
combines the effect of the absorption by the earth's atmosphere, and 
proceeds to discuss the conditions that determine the temperature at 
any place and any time for a body of any shape and coefficient of ab- 
sorption and radiation. The importantresults obtained in this chapter 
depend principally upon the radiation observations of Prevostaye and 
Desains, Melloui, Langley, Duloug, and Petit, and are applicable to the 
temperature of bodies at the earth's surface, the temperature shown by 
thermometers and those shown by solar radiation apparatus. Especial 
attention is given to the nocturnal cooling by radiation. (The late pub- 
lications by Maurer, H. F. Weber, Angot and Zenker could of course 
not be utilized by Ferrel.) 

In chapter 3 Ferrel deduces the general motions and pressure of the 
atmosphere, beginning with the equations of absolute motion on the 
earth at rest, whence follows his law that all bodies in motion are de- 
flected to the right in the northern hemisphere. Combining these equa- 
tions with the equation of continuity, certain general relations are de- 
duced expressed by differential equations. 

Ferrel's method of solution of these equations consists in successive 
approximations, beginning with the simplest cases of no friction and no 
disturbance of the normal distribution of temperature, ho finally pro- 
ceeds in section 4 of chapter 3 to give a special solution for the actual 
case of the earth, which although only approximate yet within the limits 
indicated, appears to agree well with observed ])henomena; this solu- 
tion is summed up in the two following formuljc for the connection be- 
tween the barometric gradient (G) expressed in millimeters per degree 
of the great circle of the meridian from north to south, the angular dis- 
tance(^) from the north pole or 90 degrees minusthe latitude; theveloc- 
ity {v) of the east- west motions of a particle of air ; the total velocity (s) 
of the particle; the temperature (r) on which the density of the air de- 
pends ; the inclination {i) of the wind to the parallel of latitude ; the 
observed barometric pressure (P) and the normal sea level barometric 
pressure (Po). The resulting formula for the barometric gradient meas- 
ured on the meridian, as given on page 207 of his " Recent Advances," is

Substituting this value of G in the general differential equation of 
motion, Ferrel deduces the following expression for v for the mean 
temperature condition of the earth where h is the altitude, and G^ the 
full gradient at the earth's surface; the last term is negligible as ex- 
pressing the effect of inertia and friction due to meridional motions:

The coefficient A2 represents the principal term in Ferrel's previous 
development of the solar diurnal variation of temperature in a harmonic 
series that obtains for the whole year and the whole earth. Instead of 
attempting to compute the temperature (r) Ferrel has preferred to 
compile from charts of temperature and pressure the actual average 
values of temperature and pressure and wind velocity for each five de- 
grees of latitude for January, July and the whole year, for the north- 
ern and southern hemispheres. The introduction of these observed 
temperatures and pressures enables him to compute the value of v 
which on comparison with the observed velocity shows a very excellent 
agreement. The i)rocess is simply a refinement upon the numbers 
already published by him in 1858, and is, I think, equivalent to the 
statement that if among the many direct solutions of the equations of 
motion jiossible when the boundary conditions are given, we, without a 
previous knowledge of these boundary conditions, select that special 
solution that we find existing on the earth's surface as indicated by 
our observed temperatures and jiressures, then the resulting computed 
velocity agrees with the observed velocity of the wind. After explain- 
ing the annual oscillations of winds and calms, rain and cloud, Ferrel 
passes to chapter 4 on cyclones. In this is given an elementary me- 
chanical theory of the gyration of a small portion of the atmosphere 
near the earth's surface at any latitude, the resulting equations (7) on 
page 238 being, of course, entirely similar to the general equations 13 
on page 188 for the general cyclonic motion of the atmosphere about 
the earth's axis. 

The treatment of these equations is naturally very similar to that for 
the general motion of the atmosphere, and if Ferrel's methods seem pro- 
lix and inelegant, as compared with the beautiful work of Oberbeck and 
Helmholtz, it must be remembered that he expressly states this treatise 
to have been written for persons who have a slight acquaintance with 
the mathematical progress of the past thirty years, and that he has 
therefore adopted such elementary and simpler methods as could be 
easily comprehended by those who graduate from minor colleges and 
scientific schools, while at the same time he hns also expressly avoided 
analytical refinements that are not demaiuled in thei)resent crude state 
of meteorological kiu)wledge. In fact, like all his other treatises, tliis 
also impresses one with the conviction that Ferrel aims to be a practical 



DYNAMIC iMETEOROLOGY. 373 

meteorologist rather than an elegant analyst, lie is satisfied with show- 
ing that the larger features of atmospheric motion are abundantly 
explicable by known laws of mechanics and that, therefore, the ulti- 
mate details of these phenomena will undoubtedly be also thus ex- 
plained, and this conviction is that which is needed in order to attract 
to this study those who wish to devote themselves to "exact science." 

The formula3 for cyclones are treated approximately for the case of no 
friction and uniform temperature; then for the case of a difference of 
temperature between the central and exterior parts, the warm center 
being a cyclone, the cold center the anti-cyclone ; finally, the solution is 
indicated for the case of the existence of both friction and temperature 
disturbances. In the next section on the progressive motion of cyclones, 
Ferrel states, on page 259, that " the i)rincipal cause of the progressive 
motion is the general motion of the atmosphere ;" but he also adds that 
"the velocity of progress is much greater than the general motion of the 
atmosphere," and his short discussion of this subject suffices, we think, 
to show that the cyclonic progress is only to a small extent actually due 
to the general atmospheric motion, and is mainly due to those causes 
that determine the distribution of vapor and precipitation around " the 
center of power," as he terms it. By this precipitation and redistribu- 
tion of heat, the cyclone center is, as Ferrel states, continually renewed 
a little in advance of its former position. My own view differs from his 
only in the relative effect attributed by us to the general movement of 
the atmosphere on the one hand, and the tendency to the formation of 
new aspiration centers on the other. Ferrel gives special prominence 
to the former, but I to the latter; possibly he is correct for high south- 
ern or northern latitudes, but my own view agrees best with my experi- 
ence in the temperate zones; it appears to agree closely with the excel- 
lent work of John Eliot in India, and is peculiarly applicable to many 
abnormal storm-paths that I have had occasion to predict. I notice 
that Ferrel, on page 260, quotes the lake region of North America as 
possibly attracting cyclones by reason of the aqueous vai)or furnished 
by them : but would it not be more rational to infer that the course of 
our great storms is determined by larger forces than the slight excess 
of evaporation over the lakes as compared with surrounding forest and 
prairie; that in fact the lakes are the result of the precii)itation that 
occurs from the atmosphere above them? Evaporation and moist air 
are not of themselves able to produce a storm; we must have cold or 
dry air ready to fiowin beneath, and our i)resent lake region (as well as 
our ancient glaciated region) is so evidently located precisely in the 
spot where cold northerly and warm southerly winds conspire with the 
orography of the continent to produce precipitation and storms, that I 
must consider the lakes (and glacial epoch) as the result of the orogra- 
phy, and as exerting by their evaporation only a very slight reflex action 
principally appreciable in there-distribution of local rains and snow 
and slightly higher temperatures in their immediate neighborhood. On 



374 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888 

page 282 Ferrel shows that the formula expressing the relation between 
the barometric gradient (G) and the velocity of the winds is very much 
the same for the pressures and winds around a cyclone center as for 
the pressures and wiiids about the polar axis of ihe earth, aud is ex~ 
pressed by a quadratic equation s- + as = bG. As the cyclone moves 
from the land to the ocean the so-called friction term would, a priori 
be expected to suffer a decided change, and the actual amount of such 
change is indicated by the data collected by Loomis. Adopting his re- 
sults Ferrel deduces a correction to his formula based upon the principle 
"that the frictional resistance of any stratum of air moving over the 
earth's surface comes both from the earth's surface and from the stratum 
above it," aud again, " that the direction of motion of the air of the 
stratum above differs considerably in a cyclone from tbat at the surface 
of the earth." To me it seems that there is here not a sufficient dis- 
tinction between the small and negligible friction called viscosity, which 
acts both from above and below upon any intermediate stratum, aujl the 
resistances due to impact and convection, both which operate princi- 
pally from below upward; still the general effect is undoubtedly, as 
Ferrel says, to make the gradient that accompanies a given velocity of 
the wind at the earth's surface greater than that accompanying the 
same velocity of wind over the sea or at higher altitudes. Similarly 
the gradient is less in summer than in winter. 

The chapter on tornadoes deals in a very interesting manner with the 
different types of cyclones in which the horizontal movement is less 
conspicuous than the vertical movement ; the formation of water-spouts 
is explained as a special case of tornado action, and examples are com- 
puted showing the dimensions of the spout as depending on the hu- 
midity of the air. In a section on the force of the wind and supporting 
power of ascending currents, Ferrel gives merely the old approximate 
formulas for the resistance of the air varying as the square of the velocity 
and the square of the cosiue of the angle of incidence, and applies the 
resulting numerical resistances to the explanation of the formation of 
large drops of water, cloud-bursts, hail-stones, and the destructive ef- 
fects of tornado winds. Stokes's explanation of the effect of viscosity 
seems to have been overlooked. On page 314 he explains the effective 
force of the wind against an obstacle, or in the production of drafts up 
chimneys, as due " not simply to the inertia of the air but to the drag- 
ging effect of the air through friction upon the columns of air in the 
front and rear of the obstacle." I presume that this "drag" is inten- 
ded to refer to viscosity or so-called internal friction of gases, and appar- 
ently the same use of the word is made by Hagen in his explanation of 
the fact that the pressure against a thin plate depends upon the size and 
shape aud especially upon the sharp angles of the plate. It is a sui3Q- 
cient answer to this introduction of viscosity to state that the value of 
the viscous resistance can be easily computed with sufficient accuracy to 
show that it is not an important factor in these experiments on large 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 375 

bodies. The true explauatioii of Hageu's results and of tbe production 
of drafts by wind transverse to the chimney flue is found in the study 
of the pressure within discontinuous spaces and the vortices attending 
the tiow of liquid past any resisting body. The same criticism applies 
to Ferrel's explanation of the pumping of the barometer, in so far as he 
implies that friction drags away the air. 

lu his sixth chapter Ferrel gives au excellent exposition of harmonic 
analysis as applied to periodic phenomena, which is followed by the 
fundamental principles of thermometry, actinometry, hygrometry, ba- 
rometry, and anemometry. Among the new things, we notice that he 
introduces here the analytical i)ortion of his investigations upon the 
psychrometric formula, the numerical portion of which is published by 
him in full as an appendix to the annual report of the Chief Signal 
Officer for 188G. In regard to the reduction of the barometer to sea- 
level he recommends, on page 398, the use of monthly normals for the 
upper and lower station. lu order to diminish the diurnal temperature 
effect he has since then acceded to the present practice of the Signal 
Service in the use of mean daily temperatures. 

In 1886, to the great regret of his colleagues, Professor Ferrel an- 
nounced that, conformably to a long-cherished resolution, he should 
celebrate his seventieth birth-day by resigning official public office and 
retiring to his homestead in Kansas City, Missouri. The leisure thus 
secured, we learn, has been used in the j)reparation of a "Popular 
Treatise on the Winds," which will be published in 1889 and be doubly 
welcomed by the student of meteorology. 

(12) aS>/- «/*(/.— ^lu 1885 Dr. A. Sprung published his Lehrbuch der Me- 
teorologie. Shortly afterward he moved to Berlin, and as instructor in 
the university and as assistant under Professor Bezold has exerted a 
strong and good influence on the progress of meteorology. 

His Lehrbuch is by far the best treatise extant on dynamic meteor- 
ology, and I have included it in this section of theories of atmospheric 
motion, because Dr. Sprung has devoted two-thirds of his Treatise to the 
exposition of the views that have been worked out by the mathenuiti- 
cians whose names are already so familiar to my readers. It is scarcely 
necessary to say that the volume contains nearly all that had been sat- 
isfactorily established in dynamic meteorology at that time. Those who 
have not access to — or time to consult — the original memoirs should by 
all means study this volume. 

Of the other general treatises those that bear especially on storms 
are: 

(13) Greely. — "American weather," by Gen. A. W. Greely, in which 
the statistics of American storms are quoted to substantiate the theory 
of their progress by transportation in the general drift of the atmos- 
phere.

a small section is devoted to storms.

{^^}) Jylatt/orfl. — "A inactical ^uulc to the climates and weather in 
India, Oeylon, and Jiuiinah, and the stoniis of Indian seas," by II. y. 
Bhmford. This vohune, pnblished in 1889, marks the retirement of Mr. 
Blauford as meteorological reporter to the Government of India, in 
which position, since 1875, he has undoubtedly accomplished the great- 
est works ever undertaken in meteorology. Wilde's Repertorium and 
Annalen, Mascart's four annual volumes of observations and memoirs, 
Neumayer's annual Ergebnisse and Archiv, are the principal works to be 
named in comparison with Blanford's annual reports and Indian mem- 
oirs. 

In the present work Blanford devotes only a moderate portion to 
storms, and summarises the results that have been attained in India by 
Piddington, Willson, Pedlar, Meldruin, and especially the great work 
of John Eliot. 

So far as could be seen from the scattered records available up to the 
end of 1876, cyclones are most frequent in the Bay of Bengal in May 
and October, and least frequent, being almost unknown, in February 
and very rare in July ; but with the more perfect data furnished by the 
Government weather office Mr. Eliot has compiled a list of cyclones for 
the ten years 1877-8(3, which entirely alters this supposed annual dis- 
tribution, and makes the distribution almost uniform from June to No- 
vember. The Indian storms generally move toward northwest or west- 
northwest, and with very few exceptions the direction is toward some 
point in the northwest quadrant. 

The incurvature of the winds for storms in the northern part of the 
Bay of Bengal is about 35 degrees, with a slight increase as we go 
southward. The barometer does not fall for the approaching cyclone 
until long after the wind and skies show that the center of the storm 
is close at hand and only when the winds become strong and squally, 
nor does it fall rapidly until the winds have increased to hurricane 
force and the center is distant less than 50 miles. The most important 
indications of the approach of a storm are therefore to be found in the 
observation of the sky and clouds. 

The storms of the Arabian Sea, on the west coast of India, have been 
studied by Mr. F. Chambers. The storms that cross India as they move 
westward deteriorate greatly before they reach the Arabian Sea, but 
then at once begin to increase. The stormy months are April, May, 
June, and November, but the records are rather fragmentary, and the 
results will probably be changed by future study. The system of storm 
signals for the Bay of Bengal is under the control of the Calcutta oflice, 
and consists of a simple warning or danger signal at all ports except 
Calcutta, where a much more elaborate system is used. There is an 
independent system of storm warnings for the Arabian sea-coast by the 
office at Bombay.

Lowell Instituto in Boston. The aiithoi- is professor of geology and 
meteorology in JJarvard (College. The work is written in a very popu- 
lar and easy style, and deserves to be read and used in elementary 
schools. 

(17) Ahercromhy. — " Weather," by Hon. lialph Abercromby, London, 
1887. As the name implies, this book deals with the weather, its 
causes and changes, as distinguished from the statistics ot climate. 
Neither formula nor numerical tables interrupt the reader, as the ob- 
ject of the author is to sketch the general principles of the science and 
give a picture of the methods ordinarily adopted in predicting the 
weather. 

The present book reads as though it had its origin in the thought, 
"Farmers and sailors have always foretold the weather by the sky and 
cloud; why may not the meteorologist do the same?" 

He therefore devotes one-fourth of the book to clouds and cloud prog- 
nostics, and, again, fifty pages to types of weather. The last eighty 
pages are given to the rules and methods of weather predictions or 
(as the English call them) forecasts. His whole system, as he says (pp. 
430), "depends neither on theory nor calculation, but solely on obser- 
vation and experience, and success depends on natural aptitude and 
the experience of many years' study." 

To this we add, that these same statements apply to work in astron- 
omy, chemistry, etc, and that he who makes forecasts merely by means 
of generalization relative to types of weather and clouds, is sure to 
suffer from the neglect of a deeper study into causes and laws of opera- 
tion, but to those who have mastered these mechanical laws the addi- 
tional information given in Abercromby's book would be of value. 

(18) Eliot. — The report by John Eliot in 187G on the Backergunge 
cyclone, and his report of 1879 on the Madras cyclone, marked an im- 
])ortant step in the progress made, by one of the ablest meteorologists. 
He tells us he began his inquiry with a strong bias towards tlie hypoth- 
esis that cyclones originate between belts of parallel opposing winds, 
but that this proved so uusatisfiictory that he rejected it and adopted 
the condensation theory, which accounts satisfiictorily for the entire 
range of atmospheric action that constitute an extensive and intense 
cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal. At the close of his work on the 
Madras cyclone, and after refuting some views as to cyclone formation 
that Dr. Haun had advanced, Eliot sums up his own conclusions, from 
which we make the following extract: 

"The invariable antecedents of powerful cyclones at the two transi- 
tion periods, April and October, are (a) approximate uniformity of 
l)ressure over and around the coast of the Bay of Bengal ; {b) light and 
variable winds or calms over a considerable portion of the bay ; (c) little 
or no rainfall over the coast region as well as in the bay; {d) hence 
the weather is sultry ; (<?) hence the sea is smooth; (/) the amount of 
aqueous vapor accumulates and finally gives rise to peculiar sky effects; 



378 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

(ff) the immediate antecedent is heavy rain-fall, concentrated over a 
l)ortion of the bay; {h) accompanied by a strong indraft, which is most 
marked from the Indian Ocean at the entrance of the bay ; (/) this in- 
draft from the Indian Ocean gives rise to strong winds and heavy rains 
at the stations on the south and west coast of Ceylon." 

Of the preceding items (a) {b) {c) are invariable and necessary ante- 
cedents, bat the source of the energy is the item (g), condensation of 
vapor and precipitation of rain, or, as stated in the Backergunge report, 
the primary cause of cyclone formation is the production and ascent of 
a large quantity of vapor, which is condensed with the liberation of its 
latent heat over the place of its production instead of being carried 
away to some distant region. 

This independent confirmation of the views for which Espy lived and 
died, as well as the numerous other generalizations not quoted by us, 
after having been clearly apprehended by their author, were found re- 
peated in other storms, and were confirmed in his subsequent memoir 
"On the cyclonic storms of November and December, 1886, in the Bay 
of Bengal." Eliot states that there is a marked difference in the char- 
acteristics of the storms of one year and of another, which is explicable 
on the same hypothesis as that which explains the variations in the 
southwest monsoon rain-fall. These variations are apparently periodic 
in Bengal, and when the Bengal branch of the monsoon current be- 
comes strong the Bombay branch becomes weak. 

Pending the appointment of a successor to Mr. Blanford, Eliot, as 
officiating reporter, has published the report of 1887 on the Meteorol- 
ogy of India. On ])age 209 he refers to certain storms in Bengal known 
as northwesters, which are occasionally as destructive as the tornadoes 
of the United States, but his description does not enable us to conclude 
as to whether they were of the nature of twisting tornadoes, or the 
straight-line Derecho, described by Hiurichs, in Iowa. 

On ]}age 251 Eliot says the great majority of cyclonic rain-storms 
march across the Bengal coast in the direction of the belt of lowest 
pressure at the time of their formation. As the chief characteristic of 
such a barometric trough is light and variable winds, it will be seen 
that this principle virtually coincides with the rule of cyclonic storms 
in the Bay of Bengal, which march in the direction of least relative air 
motion immediately antecedent to the formation of the cyclone. 

On page 271 Eliot states that " the persistency of the i^ressure anomo- 
liea (for weeks and months) is almost certainly due to the fact that an 
abnormal variation of pressure in a moving ftiass of air necessarily 
gives rise to or accompanies the modification of its motion and in con- 
sequence of well-known properties of fluid motion this changed or 
modified air motion tends to perpetuate the pressure v^iriatiou which 
gave rise to it." 

If I correctly understand this sentence I should apply it to the flow 
of air over an obstacle where the change of motion produces a change 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 379 

of pressure or vice versa ;i change of pressure produces ii cliaugc iu 
tbe motion; for example: Staudinj;' waves are produced at the surface 
of a stream M'hich tend to per[)etuate themselves; the atmosphere is 
thrown into a system of undulations by mountain ridges, plateaus, and 
continents (which undulations may also be horizontal deviations on a 
grand scale) and into periodic recurrences due to their own inertia and 
therefore as Eliot says, tending to reproduce themselves until broken 
up by outside disturbances. This is the explanation of the special sea- 
sons of droughts, storms, and rains that we experience iu America, and 
it doubtless obtains equally in India. 

(19) Sir William Thomson. — Thompson has published a series of papers 
sparkling with his customary brilliancy on fluid motions ; these are scat- 
tered through the Philosophical Magazine, theproceedingsofthesocieties 
at London, Edinburgh, aud Glasgow, and the reports of the British As- 
sociation. These papers will cover theoretical questions as to the sta- 
bility of fluid motions, the formation of standing waves, the discontin- 
uous space iu the rear of an obstacle, the laminar flow of liquids, the 
turbulent flow of water, and other matters bearing on atmospheric phe- 
nomena. These papers have apparently been drawn out as notes for the 
forthcoming third volume of his mathematical aud physical papers, and 
when collected will be recognized as completing our views on manj- 
subjects. 

(20) Oberheck. — In 18S2 Oberbeck published iu Wiedemann's Annalen 
a mathematical development based on the correct hydrodynamic for- 
muUe, of the theory of horizontal atmospheric currents. 

A full translation of this important memoir will be included iu the 
series of papers formerly referred to; but the following ])opular state- 
ment of his results is given here as published by Oberbeck himself in 
the proceedings of the secoud German Geographical Congress: 

Starting from the generally known results of recent meteorological 
observations in so far as these relate to the distribution of pressure 
and the direction and force of the wind, the author explains that one 
of the most important i)roblems of the mathematical theory of the 
motion of fluids is to explain quantitatively the connection of the above- 
immed i)henomeua. The recently published investigations of Guldberg 
and Mohn (Etudes sur les mouvements de I'atmosphere, Christiania, 
187G and 1S8U), are to be considered as a specially successful attempt 
in this direction. It must be of interest also for the larger number of 
geograj)hers to know the most important results to which the Norwe- 
gian scientists have attained. 

In order to understand the horizontal movements of the atmosphere 
it is important for a moment to consider their causes. As such we con- 
sider the diflerences of j)ressure at the surface of the earth as observed 
Mith the barometer. But whence do these arise '. This question has 
been answered a long time since. It is heat which is to be considered 
as the prime cause of the disturbance of equilibrium in the atmosphere. 



380 RECORD OF SCIENCK FOR 1S87 AND 1888. 

Because of the slight (;oudiictivitv of the air the i)i()ceiss of waviniiig can 
progress only slowly from below upwards, so that, as is well known, 
the temperature of the air steadily diminishes as we ascend. The 
heated air expands. The pressure becomes less. If the heating takes 
place uniformly over a large area there will be at first no reason for 
horizontal currents. But vertical currents can certainly be brought 
about by this means. If we imagine a circumscribed mass of air trans- 
ported into a higher region without any increase or diminution of its 
heat its temperature will sink because it has expanded itself propor- 
tionately to the diminished pressure. If its temperature is then ecpial 
to that prevailing in the upi)er stratum it will remain in equilibrium at 
this altitude as well as below. The atmosphere in this case exists in a 
state of indifferent equilibrium. If its temperature is lower the mass 
of air will again sink down ; in the reverse case it will rise higher. The 
air in these cases is then in stable or unstable equilibrium respectively. 
In the latter case any vertical movement initiated by some accidental 
disturbance will not again disappear, but rapidly assumes increasing 
dimensions. The current will also continue uniform for a long time. 

This is the explanation given by Espy, 1831, William Thomson, 1801, 
and Eeye, of Strasburg, 1868, of the ascending air currents in the whirl- 
winds of the tropics. 

The winds of our (temperate) zone also presuppose such ascending 
currents whose origin must have been quite similar. The ascending 
current is in general restricted to a definite region that we can desig- 
nate as the base. Since the ascending current consists of warmer air, 
therefore above this base the pressure sinks.* A barometric depression 
is inaugurated there. The pressure increases from this region outward 
in all directions. The isobars therefore surround the region of ascend- 
ing atmospheric currents in closed curves. At greater heiglits the u])- 
per cooled air flows away to o)ie side, and in other regions gives occa- 
sion to descending currents of air. At the earth's surface itself the air 
flows towards the depression; its iniluence thus extends over an area 
much greater than that of the base. If we neglect the curvature of the 
earth's surface over this larger area we find there simple horizontal 
movements. Mathematical computations should now reveal to us the 
nature of such horizontal movements. To this end all the causes of 
motion or the forces that come into consideration are first to be collected 
together. 

The differences of pressure have already been several times spoken 
of; these are measured by the gradient, and it gives for aiiy i)oint the 
direction and amount of the greatest change in pressure. In horizontal 
movements the effect of gravity can be omitted. 

*Tliu8 in tlie origiual ; — but tbe tliouglitful reader will perceive that in this "popu- 
lar" presentation Oberbeck has not escaped tbe repetition of a ))opular error. Tbe 
fall of pressure, due to tbe warming of tbe air, is (]uite inappreciable; tbe observed 
barometic depression is due to cyclonic motions. 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 381 

On the otlier liand, atteution must be given to the rotation of the earth 
on its axis, since we are only interested in the paths of the winds on the 
rotating' earth. This inHuence can be taken account of if we imagine at 
every point of the mass of air a force aj^plied which is perpendicular to 
the momentary direction of motion and is equal to the product of the 
double angular velocity of the earth, the sine of the latitude, and the 
velocity of the point. On the northern hemisphere this influence causes 
a continuous dei)arture of the path towards the right-hand side. Since 
the movement takes place directly on the earth's surface the direct in- 
fluence of that surface, namely, the friction, remains to be considered. 
Its influence diminishes with the distance from the earth's surface. Fur- 
thermore, it depends on the nature of the eartirs surface, whether sea 
or lands, plains or wooded mountains. For this com])utation Guldberg 
and IMohn have made a convenient assumption in that they introduce the 
friction as a force which opposes the movement and is equal to the pro- 
duct of a given factor and the velocity. This factor can have different 
values according to the nature of the earth's surface. 

All these forces are to be introduced into the general equations of 
motion of the air. If however one desires solutions of these general 
e(]uations for special cases there is still needed a series of assumptions. 

Let there be ouly one single vertical current of air present. The 
totality of all the atmospheric movements depending upon this one ver- 
tical current is called a wind system. If the strength of the ascending 
current is variable or if the basis itself changes its place then the wind 
system is variable. In the tirst case the system stands still, in the 
second case it is movable. 

If, on the other hand, theascendingcurrentof air retains its strength 
and location without change, or, which is the same, if the isobars for a 
long time retain their position then the wind sj'stem is invariable. 

It is evident that the last case is by far the most simple. We will 
therefore begin with its consideration. 

In order to execute the calculation the location of the isobars must be 
known. Even in this respect also in a preliminary way one must limit 
himself at first by simple assumptions. Let the isobars be either par- 
allel straight lines or concentric circles. 

In the first case the computation leads to the following simple results : 

(1) The parallel isobars are equally distant from each other. The 
gradient is therefore everywhere of equal magnitude. 

(2) The paths of the wind consist of parallel straight lines. The 
strength of the wind has everywhere the same value. 

(3) The direction of the wind forms an angle with the gradient whose 
tangent is equal to the quotient of the factor arising from the earth's 
rotation divided by the friction-constant. 

The deviation of the wind from the gradient is tlierefore greater in 
proportion as friction is smaller. If the earth's surface were perfectly 
smooth the wind would blow in the direction of the isobars. 



382 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

This result following diioctly from Ibe computation and at first sur- 
prising finds its confirmation in a variety of observations. For example 
ill England we observe a deviation of Gl degrees for land winds but of 
77 degrees for sea breezes. From this it follows that the friction on 
the land is more than twice as great as on the sea. 

Conditions of pressure like those here considered frequently occur. 
In the regions of the trade winds and monsoons they ordinarily prevail 
either during the whole or about half of the year. 

The circular isobars to the consideration of which we now pass pro- 
duce systems of wind that can be considered as the simplest types of 
cyclones and anti cyclones according as the pressure in the interior is a 
minimum or maximum. We confine ourselves here to the consideration 
of cyclones. 

As already remarked, these are not conceivable without an ascending 
current of air, whose area in our case is defined by a circle. Outside 
of this horizontal movements prevail exclusively; inside of it there is 
also the vertical movement to be considered. Therefore the comi)uta- 
tions for the outer and inner regions are different. In this way we ob- 
tain the following results : 

(1) The pressure increases from all sides outward from the center ; the 
gradient increases also from the center out to the limit of the inner re- 
gion ; from there on it diminishes, and at a great distance becomes in- 
appreciable. 

(2) The wind-paths in both regions are curved lines, logarithmic 
spirals, which cut the isobars everywhere at the same angle or make 
everywhere the same angle with the radial gradient. Therefore the 
movement of the air can be considered as consisting of a current toward 
the center and a rotation around the center, the direction of the latter 
is counter clock- wise. This departure from the gradient is of different 
magnitudes in the outer and inner regions. For the former the de- 
parture has the same value as for straight isobars, that is to say, it 
depends alone upon the rotation of the earth and the friction. For 
the inner region the departure is greater, and depends besides upon the 
intensity of the ascending current of air. If both regions were sepa- 
rated from each other by a geometrical cylindrical surface, then the 
wind-paths in these would not continuously merge into each other, but 
would form an angle with each other. This, of course, can never occur 
in nature. We must therefore assume a transition region in which the 
wind is continuously diverted from one into the other direction. At 
any rate accurate and comparative observations of the wind direction 
in the inner and outer region of a cyclone would be of great interest. 
From these one could draw a conclusion as to the limitation of the as- 
cending current of air. This limit is, moreover, also notable in that at 
it the winds reach their greatest force. 

There is no arrangement that has been discussed theoretically as yet, 
except the straight line, circular, and nearly circular forms of the 
isobars. 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 383 

We Lave as yet only spokeu of the invariable systems of wind. In 
fact, however, their duration is relatively short. No sooner is a depres- 
sion formed than it fills itself np. Furthermore, the central region of 
depression generally does not remain long in the same place, but pro- 
gresses often with great velocity, drawing the whole system of winds with 
it. We must look to the density of the horizontal current flowing in 
toward the ascending current of air as the cause of these changes. The 
system of winds remains unchanged only when, as has hitherto been 
silently assumed, the temperature and density of the horizontal and 
vertical currents are alike. If the inflowing air is warmer, the depres- 
sion increases in depth, in the opposite case it becomes shallower. 

Finally, if the inflowing air is not of the same temperature on all sides, 
but is on the one side of higher and on the other side of lower tempera- 
ture than the ascending air, then it will on the one side be strengthened 
and its area increased, on the other side enfeebled and its area dimin- 
ished. The consequence of this is that the current of air or the region 
of depression moves along. The cyclone progresses. Since in the 
cyclones of our zone the air entering on the east side comes from more 
southern, therefore in general warmer, regions, while the air entering on 
the west side comes from the north and is generally colder, therefore 
the cyclone progresses from west to east or from southwest to northeast. 
This is in fact the path of most cyclones in northern Europe. For a 
moving cyclone the isobaric curves must have a different shape than for 
a stationary. Therefore one can inversely, from the shape of the isobars, 
infer the direction of motion. If the region of ascending air has a cir- 
cular form the computation can be rigorously executed. Without going 
into the details of this interesting problem in this place, I will only re- 
mark that the isobars consist of closed curves similar to an ellipse. 
There is one direction from the center outwards, in which the isobars 
are most crowded together, while in the opposite direction they are 
furthest apart. The movement of the cyclone is in a direction at right 
angles to this line. With the solution of this problem we now stand 
about at the limits of what analysis has thus far accomplished. Still 
there is hope that it will make further progress so far as concerns the 
relations between the pressure and the motion of the air at the earth's 
surface. 

(21) Oberhecl: — Oberbeck has added to his memoir of 1882 a further 
investigation on the general movements of the atmosphere, which was 
published in full in two communications to the Academy of Sciences at 
Berlin in the year 1888. (See Sitzungsberichte, 1888, xiv, p. 383-395.) 
On account of their importance I have, as in his former memoirs, given a 
complete translation of these in the collection of translations previously 
noticed ; but to those who do not care to follow the mathematical inves- 
tigation the following resume of his results is given mostly as exi>ressed 
in a ])opular paper by Oberbeck himself and originally contributed by 
him to the- Naturwissenschaftlieho Rutulsehau of Juno 0, 1888. 



384 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

" The systematic aud successful labors of meteorological observers ia 
the last decade has given a series of emi^irical laws for the motion of 
the air that have already become of great importance for meteorology 
and for weather predictions, and promise to become still more so in the 
future. 

" In general the active forces that constitute the principal causes of 
these phenomena of motion have been correctly appreciated, but so far 
as I know we have not yet been successful in bringing them into such 
a systematic counection that we have been able to deduce therefrom a 
mechanics of the atmosphere or a theory that reproduces the most im- 
portant points in the phenomena of motion. However, very noteworthy 
attempts in this direction have already been made by different parties. 

"The oldest investigations upon this point are due to the American 
meteorologist, William Ferrel. They are contained in a large number 
of memoirs, only a part of which is accessible to me ; but from the 
memoirs that are known to me I think I may conclude that the most 
important results to which Ferrel has attained are collected together 
by himself in a work recently published (Eecent Advances in Mete- 
orology, Washington, or Appendix 71 to the Annual Eeport for 1885 
of the Chief Signal Officer), so that the following remarks relate to this 
work : 

" Ferrel starts, in reality, with the equations of motion of a free heavy 
point or a small free mass, and endeavors, by the addition of further 
terms, to accommodate these equations to the motion of a fluid, but 
without finally attaining the correct form of the hydrodynamic equa- 
tions. As effective forces he introduces the attraction of the earth, the 
consideration of the differences of density of the air (in consequence of 
differences of temperature), the effects resulting from the rotation of 
the earth, and, finally, the resistances of friction. 

"From the general ecpiations he derives special solutions, in which, 
first, the friction is neglected, and the additional assumption is made 
that the currents in the directions of the small circles (parallels of lati- 
tude) materially exceed in strength or velocity the movements in the 
meridian that would take place on a motionless earth, in consequence of 
the differences in temperature between the tropics and the polar zones. 

" But such an assumption, in my opinion, ought not to be made with- 
out further considerations. Eather is it the jirovince of theory to dem- 
onstrate its correctness, and to show for what reasons east and west 
currents are stronger than the north and south currents. The com- 
plete neglect of friction leads, as not otherwise to be expected, to for- 
muhe that make the velocity at the poles become infinitely great, whence 
follows that the atmospheric pressure will there be zero. The consider- 
ation of friction, as 1o the method of whose action no special assumption 
is made, has the result of mollifying these incorrect results and accom- 
modating the phenomena of motion to the recognized special distribu- 
tion of pressure on the earth surface. 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 385 

" The motions in the atmosphere have been further treated of by C. M. 
Guldberg and H. Mohn. (Studies on the Motions of the Atmosphere, 
Christiania, part i, 1876, part ii, 1880.) These authors both start with 
the correct hydrodynamic equations. The motions are by them directly 
recorded in differences of pressure. Furthermore, the resistance is 
assumed to be proportional to the velocity of the wind then prevailing?. 
It is very probable that this assumption is appropriate for the lowest 
strata of the atmosphere. The calculations of the above-named scholars 
will, therefore, lead also to results that agree with observations in gen- 
eral for the movement of the air in the neighborhood of the earth's sur- 
face, esjiecially when we carry through the computations somewhat 
more accurately, as was done by me a short time ago. (See Wiede- 
mann Annalen, 1882, vol. xvii, p. 128, reproduced in No. 7 of the 
accompanying translations; compare also A. Sprung, Treatise on 
Meteorology, pp. 142-151.) On the other hand, there can certainly 
be no doubt that the above-given assumption as to the nature of the 
frictional resistance is entirely inappropriate for the upper strata of 
air. A general comprehensive theory of cyclones, in which the upper 
and the lower currents are considered, and in which, furthermore, the 
fundamental cause of cyclones, namely, local differences of density in 
the atmosphere, occupies the foreground, can certainly not be attained 
by using the above-mentioned assumption as to resistance. 

"The problem of the progressive movement of cyclones, so remarkably 
important but at the same time so very difficult, can indeed only first 
find a satisfactory solution when (1) the constitution of a stationary 
cyclone is sufficiently well known (2) the curreuts in the upper strata 
of the atmosphere are established with some degree of certainty. 

"The above mentioned investigations are presented in a clear and com- 
prehensive form in the treatise on meteorology by A. Sprung, Ham- 
burg, 1885. 

"Especially would I call attention to the judgment of the author as to 
W. Ferrel (page 198 and notes on pages 200 and 202), with which I 
entirely agree.* 

" Since that publication the motions of the atmosphere have been 
treated by W. Siemens, introducing the fundamental propositions of the 
conservation of energy. (Siemens, On the Conservation of Energy in 
the Atmosphere of the Earth. Sitzungsberichte of the IJerlin Academy, 
1886, p. 261). This author, without special analytical developments, 
makes the existence of strong currents in the direction of the parallels 
of latitude very probable, and ascribes to them a predominant influence 
on even the wind systems of the temperate zones. 

* Sprang's criticism is but little more than the opinion of a regret that Ferrel has 
not fully solved the equation of coutinuity, but as he has adopted tho special solution 
that is offered by the mean distribution of temperature and pressure in the earth, I 
do not see that any error has been introduced thereby. — (J. A. 

H. Mis. 142 25 



386 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

" From all this it seemed to me worth the trouble to investigate to what 
results a new treatment of the problem of atmospheric movements in the 
most general analytical method would lead. 

"The starting point necessarily is the equations of motion of hydro- 
dynamics, as to whose reliability, so far as is known to me, no manner of 
doubt has been expressed. The ultimate cause of the movements con- 
sists in differences of density of air that is subject to the attraction 
of the earth. 

" The influence of the rotation of the earth, according to the laws of 
mechanics, can be expressed by a deviating force, so that after its intro- 
duction the earth can be considered as at rest. Furthermore, frictional 
forces are to be introduced, since without them the atmospheric currents 
under the continuous influence of accelerating forces will attain infinitely 
great velocities. The resistances opposing the atmospheric movements 
in all cases consist of a series of influences of various origins, and in part 
also, variable in amount. If a rapidly moving mass of fluid penetrates 
into a quiet fluid it experiences a sensible resistance almost like that of 
a solid body moving in the quiet fluid. If, on the other hand, a definite 
portion of a fluid comes continuously under the influence of a motive force, 
then " fluid jets'' are formed, or, as they were first called by Helmholtz, 
"discontinuous currents," which glide through the quiet fluid with rela- 
tively slight friction.* Two neighboring currents running parallel to 
each other, with different velocities, will always affect each other in such 
a way that the more rapid is retarded, the slower current is accelerated. 
This interchange is much favored when between the two larger main 
currents smaller side currents are produced by means of local causes, 
which bring about a partial mixture of the two streams. All these 
phenomena, especially that last mentioned, indicate in my judgment 
that we shall take account of the most important resisting influences 
if we follow the assumption first expressed by Newton, that the mutual 
influence of the rapidly moving parts of a fluid is proportional to the 
differen(;e of their velocities. Hence it at once follows that a current, in 
which all parts move parallel and with equal velocities, experiences in 
general no friction. On the other hand, wherever currents of different 
velocity occur near each other the friction has an effect which is especi- 
ally strong at the boundary of the currents. 

" Since I also adopt the just mentioned law of friction for the atmos- 
pheric currents, I would expressly designate this as an hypothesis. I 
thereby in nowise assume that the process is so simple as it is in the 
experiments for the determination of the coefficient of friction, i. e., 
viscosity or internal friction, iu which everything is so arranged inten- 
tionally that the velocities of the fluid remain very small.

" Hence the numerical value of the coefficient of the friction of the air 
(or viscosity), as found experimentally, can in nowise be used for the 
computation of the influence of friction in the atmosphere. Eather 
will the number that for brevity is here called 'friction coefficient,' be 
much larger than the above-mentioned coefficient. 

" The influence of the earth's surface on the air streaming over it can 
be easily expressed according to this theory of friction. According: to 
the nature of the earth's surface the neighboring particles of air are 
either forced to adhere to it or else move over it with greater or less 
retardation. 

"The density of the air as is well known depends upon the pressure 
and the temperature. For increasing distance above the earth's sur- 
face the density diminishes rapidly, and at an altitude of 20 kilometers 
it has a density of only one-tenth of that which prevails at the earth's 
surface. The consideration of this circumstance would greatly increase 
the difficulty of the calculation. I have temporarily ignored the dimi- 
nution of density at great altitudes. But in the explanation of the final 
result one would have to take into consideration this point. Since as 
above mentioned, the density of the air is inappreciably small at alti- 
tudes which are slight in comparison with the horizontal dimensions of 
the atmosphere, therefore the movements that occur at those altitudes 
can in general exert only a slight influence on the currents in the lower 
stratum. We can therefore from a dynamic point of view consider the 
atmosphere as bounded at a moderate altitude by a spherical surface 
on which the air slides freely. 

" The calculation executed on the basis of this assumption leads to the 
following result : If ice imagine a definite distribution of temperature over 
the eartWs surface or over a special portion of it to continue for a long time, 
then permanent currents of air exist, that can be calculated from the 
distribution of temperature if it be considered as given. 

"Now the contrast in temperature of the hot and cold zone is the 
principal force that, with slight modifications in the ditfereut seasons 
of the year, causes a system of currents that includes the greatest part 
of the earth's surface. 

"A form of expressing this distribution of temperature that is very 
convenient for computation consists in the utilization of the following 
expression : 

T=A+B (1-3 cos^^) 

In this 6 is the angle that the line connecting any point of the atmos- 
phere with the center of the earth makes with the axis of the earth so that 
900—^ is the geographical latitude of the point in question. Under this 
assumption analysis furnishes the following values for the three com- 
ponents of the currents at any point of the atmosphere, viz, V for the 
vertical component taken positive upwards, N the horizontal compo- 



388 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

nent taken positive toward the north, and O the horizontal component 
taken as positive toward the east. 

V=C (1-3 cos2 d)f 

N=-GCcos^sin 6 , cp 

0=D [sin ^ (1-3 cos2 6) g-\-Q cos^ 6 . y] 

"In these expressions /, 9), g^ y are functions of the distance of the 
point in question in the atmosphere above the earth's surface. They 
depend also upon the condition of the atmosphere at its two boundary 
surfaces (the concentric spherical surfaces above and below). At both 
these two boundary surfaces the vertical component V, and therefore 
also /, must disappear. Furthermore, cp^ g, y, must disappear at the 
earth's surface if we assume that there the atmosphere adheres to it. 

" The function q) is zero for a certain definite altitude — that is to say, 
at this altitude the meridional current changes its sign ; below it is di- 
rected toward the south, but above it is directed toward the north. The 
function g is everywhere negative ; the function y is everywhere posi- 
tive, but always zero at the earth's surface. 

" The two constants O and D unfortunately do not admit of direct nu- 
merical computation, and that for two reasons : First, the unknown 
value of the friction constant for atmospheric currents enters into them. 
Again, they contain the whole ditference in temperature between the 
equator :iud tlie pole. But it is allowable to assume that only a certain 
fractional part of tbis difference of temperature is the actual effective 
cause of the currents, since in the higher strata the difference of tem- 
perature is certainly considerably smaller. 

*'In other respects tlie above expressions give a clear picture of the 
currents. The vertical current (V) is an ascending one from the equa- 
tor up to 350 16' north and south latitudes, but thence to the poles it is 
directed downwards. The meridional currents (N) are at the equator 
and at the poles; they attain their greatest value at 45° latitude. 

" In consequence of the earth's rotation there arises the current O 
along the circles of latitude, which consists of two branches, Oi depend- 
ing on the function g, and O2 depending on the function ;/. Oi is, from 
the equator to 35° 16' north and south latitudes, directed toward the 
west; there this current changes its sign, and in the higher latitudes is 
easterly. O2 represents a current directed toward the east; everywhere 
at the earth's surface it is zero (corresponding to the value of the func- 
tion y), but, on the other hand, at higher altitudes it attains a very 
considerable value. Both the movements Oi and O2 along the small 
circles of latitude disappear at the pole. Moreover, the current O2 is 
zero at the equator, and attains its greatest value at the latitudes 
540 44/ north and south. 

" We would especially call attention to the fact that these results de- 
pend essentially upon the assumption as to the distribution of tempera- 
ture. A change iu the location of the maximum of temperature (as

for instance, its transfer into the northern hemisphere), would cause a 
corresponding change of all the currents. 

" The accompanying sketch, Fig. 1, gives a i)icture of the atmospheric 
currents as they would result from tlie adoj^ted distribution of tempera- 
ture. This presents the earth's surface in the Mercator projection. 
The curves u and ?t represent the currents of air in the lower strata; 
the curves o and o in the upper strata of the atmosphere. At the 
equator and at the poles the vertical 
currents serve as the means of transi- 
tion of the lower curreuts into the 
upper, and vice versa. The lower 
current can, under favorable circum- 
stances, come to be observed at the 
earth's surface. In fact, the diagram 
presents iu its u curves in the tropics 
the trade winds as they prevail over 
the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and 
also the west wind as it prevails be- 
yond the fortieth degree of latitude. 
From the agreement of the wind paths 
iu this diagram with those actually 

observed, the important conclusion can be drawn that iu general the 
curreuts u and Oi are of the same order of magnitude. Hence, it fol- 
lows that 02or the upper easterly current must be of materially greater 
intensity than the lower currents. The upper wind paths agree in the 
tropics with the anti-trade. In higher latitudes the west wind must 
principally prevail iu the upper regions. 

''In the very highest strata of air the currents must again diminish 
iu strength; this is to be concluded from the fact that the two quanti- 
ties and D contain the density of the air as a factor which enters in 
its first power into C, but in its second i)ower into D. 

"To this general presentation of the currents of air the detailed com- 
putation of the distribution of pressure is still lacking bj^ this execu- 
tion, perhaps some unimportant modifications of the results here com- 
municated may be attained." 

(22) Oherheck. — In his third communication on this subject (the second 
of 1888), Oberbeck passes from a consideration of the motions of the at- 
mosphere to that of the general distribution of pressure that results 
from the movements, which themselves result from the distribution of 
temperature, or more properly of density. In this case he again deals 
with the hypothetical atmosphere of uniform density and depth adher- 
ing to the earth but gliding under the upper layers and adopts the ap- 
l)roximate law of temperature of the air as above given. His general 
solution of the equations leads to the formula : 

j)=constaut4-wt co»^d—n eos*d. 

In the southern hemisphere we have conditions that approximate 
those here adopted more nearly than in the northern, and havingshowu

that the observed pressures agree with the preceding result, Oberbeck 
then utilizes the terms m and n to separate the motions in latitude and 
longitude. This process is more general than that which Ferrel ex- 
ecuted in the case of the solutions given by him in 1S59 in the Mathe- 
matical Monthlj^, so that the equations can be adapted to a wide range 
of constants in the law of distribution of temperature at the earth's sur- 
face. Oberbeck proceeds to apply it to the extreme seasonal c.iange 
in the atmosphere as well as to the assumed mean. The whole memoir 
will be given in my selected translations. 

(23) Eelmholts. —Jn May, 1888, Helmholtz submitted to the Berlin 
Academy the memoir on atmospheric movements that I have given in 
full in the accompanying translations. He first shows that the results 
of laboratory experiments on a small scale can not be directly applied 
to larger atmospheric movements because of the fact that the inertia 
and density of the masses, the forces of viscosity and gravitation, and 
the linear dimensions, length, area, volume, angle and time, are not all 
enlarged in the necessary ratios, so that certain results, especially vis- 
cosity, become inappreciable in large natural phenomena. He then 
studies the conditions of stability among masses having discontinuous 
motions; thus if two ring vortices encircle the earth having different 
latitudes and temperatures, stable equilibrium is possible only when 
the warm ring is on the polar edge of the colder ring. If they have the 
same latitude then the warmer must be above the colder. The unroll- 
ing of the vortex-cylinders and rings destroys their integrity and mo- 
tions, mixes their own and the surrounding air together, determines the 
actual average distribution of temperature and moisture in the atmos- 
phere, and is the important step in the history of all atmospheric phe- 
nomena. Helmholtz announces his intention of further developing this 
subject. 

(24) Diro Kitao — Comparable with the elegant analysis of Helm- 
holtz and Oberbeck, and, in fact, reminding us remarkably of the work 
of KircbhoflF, is the memoir by Kitao (professor of physics and mathe- 
matics in the Im])erial Academy of Agriculture of the University of 
Tokio), entitled " Contributions to the theory of the movement of the 
terrestrial atmosphere and of whirlwind storms." 

A few years ago. Professor Kitao returned from studying in Germany, 
and Japan is to be congratulated on possessing two such mathemati- 
cians as Kikuchi and Kitao, the former as able a pupil of the English 
school as the latter is of the German. 

Kitao's memoir is published in two parts, in vol. i, 1887. and vol. Ii, 
1889, of the Journal of the College of Science of the University Tokio, 
and a further continuation is promised. But for its great length his 
work would have been included in the appended collection of transla- 
tions, but awaiting its completion and eventual translation lean now 
only call the attention of students to this extensive analytical memoir.

(25) General treatises on fluid motion. — To complete our list of recent 
works bearing directl}^ on the mechanics of the atmosphere, we should 
include a few general treatises on fluid motion that are specially worthy 
of the study of meteorologists. 

I do not note any general works by French authors, but have reason 
to expect such in the near future, judging from the introductions and 
notes in recent publications by Poincar6 ,Boussinesq, Duhem, and 
Mathieu. Our list is as follows :

IV.— THERMO-DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA. 

(26) Introductory. — The application of the laws of thermo-dynamics 
to the movements of the atmosphere was first made in a crude manner 
by Espy and Joseph Henry before the development of this branch of 
physics had been attempted by Clausius, Sir William Thomson, and 
others. The memoir of Thomson in 1861 ; Eeye, 1864 and 1872 5 that 
of J. H. Lane (American Journal of Science and Arts, July, 1870) ; that 
of Charles Chambers (see the Meteorology of the Bombay Presidency, 
1878) ; the short paper by Hann (Z. O. G. M., 1874) ; the memoirs of Prof. 
William Ferrel (see especially his Meteorological Researches, 1877, 1881, 
1883, and his Recent Advances, 1885; those of Guldberg and Mohn, 
1876-'78), and the treatise of Sprung (Meteorologie, 1885), have all of 
them given analytical expressions for this application of thermo-dyna- 
mics, so that the whole subject of adiabatic changes should now be 
familiar to all meteorologists. The works of these authors have now 
been most admirably sui>plemeuted by two memoirs by Hertz and Be- 
zold, respectively, who have developed graphic methods that render the 
entire process of cooling and warming easy of computation and clear 
of comprehension, as also very expeditious. 

The memoir of Hertz is confined to the determination of adiabatic 
changes, but the memoir of Bezold includes the consideration of changes 
that are not strictly adiabatic, but in which the quantity of heat within 
a mass of air actually changes by reason of mixtures, precipitations, . 
and radiations. 

It is evident to the most superficial thought that the quantity of 
heat within a given mass of air actually is continually in a state of 
change and that too not only by reason of its gain of heat from the sun 
by day and its loss b}' radiation at night, but especially by the process 
of mixture that is continually going on. On the one hand cold and dry

airs are being mixed with warm and moist ; on the other hand aqueous 
vapor with latent heat is being added to the air by evaporation from 
the ground, and again being taken from the air, but leaving its heat 
behind by the process of formation of rain, hail, and snow. Therefore 
the ascent and descent of atmospheric currents is by no means an adia- 
batic process, aud it is the aim of Bezold to so present graphically the 
changes that take place in ascending and descending air as that we may 
at any time calculate its thermal condition. 

(27) Bezold. — The original memoirs of Hertz and Bezold detailing 
their graphic methods in thermodynamics as applied to our atmosphere 
will be given in full in the promised collection of translations. The 
ground covered by these will be easily understood from the following 
analysis of Bezold's work by Lettry,* with slight additions by myself. 

(A.) DEFINITIONS. — Let p and v be respectively the values of the vol- 
ume aud pressure of a unit weight, namely, a unit mass, of gas or gas- 
eous vapor whose absolute temperature is T. Then according to the 
law of Boyle Mariotte-Gay-Lussac and Charles, we have 

pv='RT (a). 

Let the condition of the unit of gas be graphically represented as to 
pressure and volume by the ordinate aud abscissa of a point ; when p 
and V are given, the location of the point is known by the graphic con- 
struction, but equally is the temperature T known by the equation (a) ; 
thus the location of a point in the diagram corresponds to a definite 
temperature of the gas. If the gaseous mass is maintained at a con- 
stant temperature then p aud v may vary continuously, only fulfilling the 
condition that their jiroduct p v remains constant. The locus of the 
continuous series of points thus defined is called an isotherm, and we 
see that the isotherm occurring for any given temperature must be a 
hyperbola with the axis^ and v as its asymptotes, as in Fig. 2, where 
the co-ordinate axes are rectangular and the hyperbola is equilateral. 

If on the other hand the tem- 
I)erature be allowed to change, but 
the original amount of heat or 
thermal energy in a unit mass of 
gas is forced to remain constant, 
then a new relation between the 
pressure and volume that can co- 
exist is brought about and is defi- 
nitely determined by the laws of 
20°cent. thermo-dynamics ; this relation is 
Wcent. gi^^eu by the equation.

co-existing jp and v are made tlie co-ordinates of a pojnt, the locus of the 
points representing the pressure and volume for a given constant quan- 
tity of heat is called the adiabatic curve for that special quantity, as is 
shown in Fig. 3. 

An isotherm and an adiabatic line 
may be imagined passing through any 
point whatever if the latter be con- 
sidered as an indicator of a given 
initial state of the gas ; that is to say, 
a point whose position is determined 
by co-ordinates having the initial 
values ^o and Vo. The indicator point 
will follow the isotherm if we make 
the condition of the gas vary while 
maintaining a constant temperature ; 
it will follow the adiabatic if the con- 
dition of the gas varies without increase or diminution of the quantity 
of heat contained within it. 

Hitherto in the application of the mechanical theory of heat to me- 
teorology the adiabatic changes only have been considered, but Hertz 
has shown how to approximately consider non-adiabatic changes, and 
especially has Bezold freed himself from the adiabatic hypothesis, which 
is in fact not generally realized in nature. 

Dynamic cooling.— Bezohl first considers the preliminary question, 
Why does air cool on ascending to higher elevations ? Most meteorol- 
ogists exi)lain this cooling as the transformation of molecular energy 
into external work done in the expansion of the gaseous mass as it 
comes under and acts against the diminished pressure of the upper re- 
gions. This is correct, and it is necessary to be on our guard against 
an erroneous explanation adopted by Guldberg and Mohn,to the effect 
that the work done is the elevation of the gas to the higher level ; this 
latter explanation is not allowable, since the work of raising the gas is 
really done by gravity, namely, the heavier descending air pushes up 
the lighter rising gas. 

(B.) THE DRY STAGE.— Let x be the mass of aqueous vapor (namely, 
not the weight nor the tension, but strictly the mass of vapor) that is as- 
sociated with a unit mass, i. e., a kilogram of dry air, and m the mass of 
the mixture; then m = l-\-x. Kote that a; differs slightly from the quan- 
tity of vapor in a kilogram of the mixture, which latter is the quantity 
generally given in meteorological tables. 

LetpK and ps bo the partial pressures of the dry air and the vapor, 
respectively ; the total barometric pressure will hep=px+2h. 

Let "Ra and Kj be the constants in equation (a) for the air and vapor; 
that equation then gives for the mixed gas and vapor 

p^v = Ji^T psV=x-RsT p = ^ {lii,-\-xlh)T. ... (1) 



394 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Approximately, Ra =29.272 and Ka=47.0Gl iu the metric system of 
units. 

Comparing this with the corresponding equation for dry air, we see 
that (1) contains the additional variable x, and that the thermal condi- 
tion of the gas is not defined until we knowj), v, and ijc. Geometrically 
the condition of the gas would be represented by the location of a point 
in space whose co-ordinates are these three variables. 
" hetpov, in Figs. 2 and 3, be called the "plane of co-ordinates," as 
that term is used by Bezold, and let x be measured perpendicular 
thereto; we have thus the necessary system of three rectangular co or- 
diuates. The value of x in ordinary meteorological j>roblems is gener- 
ally very small in comparison with j> and v. For any given constant 
value ofx the indicator i)oint, showing the thermal condition of the air, 
would move in a plane parallel and very near to the plane jpov. If x 
is zero the equation and the curve becomes the same as for dry air. 

Isotherms. — If we assume that the temperature T is maintained con- 
stant, then the indicator moves along an isotherm, as above described. 
For a given value of x equation (1) shows that the isotherm is an equi- 
lateral hyperbola precisely like that in dry air, but situated iu a plane 
parallel to the plane of co-ordinates. The isotherms for the same tem- 
perature T and for different values of a?, when projected upon the plane 
pov, agree sensibly. In fact the ordinates pi and j;2 of the two isotherms 
con esponding to a given abscissa, -y, and to the given quantities of 
aqueous vapor Xi and x^ are connected by the relation 

Since the second member of this equation is rery nearly zero, since 
the values of x are generally less than 0.03, therefore the ordinates j?i 
and JP2 iire sensibly equal. One may then be content to consider in the 
geometrical interpretation of the facts, not the isotherms themselves, 
but their approximately common projection upon the plane of co-ordi- 
nates; this amounts to saying that we may consider x as constant. 

The line of saturation. — The changes in the condition of the air are not 
reversible, and the equation (1) holds good only for certain values of??. 
In fact the fundamental condition of the dry stage is that the vapor 
pressure's shall be rather less than the maximum pressure of the sat- 
urated vapor for the temperature T. Designating this maximum press- 
ure by e it is necessary that we should have 

or rather by replacing ^^s by its value as a function of v that we should 
have

Each isotherm therefore commences ouly at a certain limiting point,

mined by the relation found by combining equations (1) and (3) namely,

If the quantity x preserves a given constant value tUe isotherm con- 
tinues to lie iu its own plane as the temperature T varies ; the limiting 
point of tlie isotherm, as just defined, is displaced at the same time, and 
describes a curve that Bezold calls the line of saturation or the line of the 
deiv-point. (See Fig. 4.) 

This curve has its concavity 
turned toward the side of positive i?. 
The indicator point for air in the 
dry stage ought therefore always to 
be on the concave side of the line of 
saturation ; if this point passes over 
to the convex side it indicates that 
the dry stage has been followed by 
the rain stage. 

When the quantity x varies while 
T remains constant the projections 
upon the plane of co-ordinates of 
the isotherms corresponding to the 
various values of x sensibly agree 

with each other, as we have said, at least when one draws a diagram 
rather than a rigorously exact figure. On the other hand, the limit- 
ing point in this common i)rojection on the plane of oo-ordinates is 
not the same when we take different values of x. We find, without diffi- 
culty, that if Vi and ^2 are the abscisses of the limiting points belong- 
ing to the quantities of vapor Xi and X2, respectively, we have ^=^» 

that is to say, that the abscissas of the limiting point vary propor- 
tionately to X. To each value of x there corresiwnds a line of satura- 
tion, precisely as to each value of T there corresponds anisothern. 
Adiabatics. — The equation of an adiabatic in the dry stage is

where Cp and cj designate respectively, the specific heats at constant 
l)re8sure of air and of non-saturated aqueous vapor; A=430, approxi- 
mately, is the mechanical equivalent of a unit of heat. T aud^ per- 
tain to an initial state of the air, but Ti and pi to a final state. Bezold 
gives a method of constructing by points an indefinite number of 
adiabatics when we know one and when we have first constructed the 
system of isotherms. 

In the dry stage the adiabatics are appreciably independent of a?, 
which is a very small quantity, and they can be regarded as sensibly 
the same as the adiabatics for dry air entirely without aqueous vapor. 

Resume. — For the dry stage the condition of the atmosphere is repre- 
sented by three systems of lines that can be traced upon a diagram, 
whose CO ordinates are ^ and v, which lines constitute a net- work inter- 
secting each other over the whole plane of co-ordinates, as follows : 

(1 ) Isotherms that are equilateral hyperbolas that depend, respectively, 
upon the values of the variable parameter T, but can for a given temp- 
erature be considered as independent of x, the quantity of aqueous 
vapor. 

(2) Lines of saturation, the position of each of which depends on the 
variable parameter x. Each line of saturation divides the plane of co- 
ordinates into two parts ; on the concave side of this curve the dry 
stage is represented, and on the convex side the wet stage. 

(3) Adiahaties, which are asymptotic to the axes of ^ and v and inter- 
sect the two preceding systems of lines ; these adiabatics are sensibly 
the same as those that relate to absolutely dry air. 

(C.) THE RAIN STAGE. — When rain is forming let x be the quantity of 
saturated vapor that is associated with one kilogram of dry air, and x' 
the quantity of water as such suspended within this kilogram of dry 
air; let M be the mass of the mixture; we have the equation 

M=l-fx-f J?' 

Here the tension of the vapor is determined by the temperature it- 
self; if e designates this tension then we have the two following equa- 
tions of condition as representing the relations in this stage of rain : 

P=^/^+^ • (C) 

€=xR.- (7) 

V 

The following remarks may be made with regard to the rain stage : 
(1) The quantity of water in suspension, x', is always very small; for 
as soon as this quantity becomes rather large the water separates from 
the foggy mass and falls ; therefore the changes of condition are irre- 
versible. 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 397 

(2) 111 general, the quantity, a?, of saturated vapor can only diminish. 
This quantity could increase with v if, in an exceptional case, the tem- 
perature remained constant, or with T, if the volume remained the 
same, but it would be necessary that the added vapor should be fur- 
nished by the evaporation of the water in suspension. jSTow, the quan- 
tity of water in suspension is very small, and this store would be quickly 
exhausted. The contact of the air with moist bodies or any circum- 
stance of the same class would also tend to increase the quantity of 
vapor X, but still this would be an exceptional case. 

(3) The equations (6) and (7) show that when x is given it suffices to 
know any one of the quantities e, T, v, oriJ in order that the others may 
be determined. We see also that if x is given and T varies, the indi- 
cator of the condition of the air moves along the line of saturation that 
is peculiar to the special value of x. « 

(4) Let us suppose that at the moment when the vapor becomes sat- 
urated and that one enters into the rain stage the quantity of vapor is 
x^, aud that at the end of a certain time this quantity is diminished to 
.Vj. The indicator was at first on the line of saturation belonging to x^, 
but it now is found on the line of saturation belonging to a?j. While x 
has decreased from x„ to .Tj, the indicator has passed from its initial to 
its final position by cutting across all the lines of dew-point or lines of 
saturation relative to the intermediate values of a;. 

But the indicator can not retrace its path, because x can not increase 
in general. Therefore in the rain stage the indicator always describes 
its path in the same direction. For such paths or trajectories, described 
in the given direction, one can apply the principles of thermodynamics 
as if reversible changes were under consideration. Therefore the 
changes of condition in the case of rain can be described as " partially 
reversible." 

Isotherms. — As the tension e of saturated vapor is constant so long 
as the temperature T is constant, and as on the other hand x can only 
decrease, the equation (7) shows that v can only decrease if T does not 
change. This being allowed, the equation (6) will be the equation 
of the isotherm for a given temperature, T, and for decreasing values 
of V and of x. The isotherm remains entirely throughout its whole ex- 
tent on the convex side of the line of saturation belonging to x^, the 
initial value of x. 

We see that the isotherm in the rain stage is still an equilateral 
hyperbola, and that it varies very little from the isotherm of the dry 
stage for the same temperature. 

Adiabatics. — Strictly speaking there is no adiabatic, unless we sup- 
pose that all the condensed water remains in suspension. If all or a 
part of the water falls to the ground there is an exterior work per- 
formed, and consequently a loss of internal heat or calorific energy, 
and the definition of the adiabatic no longer applies, 



398 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

If we assume that all the water formed by condensation continues in 
suspension, we have for the differential equation of the adiabatic 

(c„+^a)dT+Td('^^ + AR,T'^=0 (8) 

where c„ designates the specific beat of the air at a constant volume, 
x^ is the quantity of aqueous vapor at the moment when the rain stage 
begins, x is the quantity of aqueous vapor at any given moment during 
the rain stRge, r is the latent beat of vaporization or quantity of heat 
required to vaporize a unit mass of water at tbe temperature T, and the 
pressure |) or approximately, G06 at 0° C and varying witb the tempera- 
ture; A and E.^, known constants, as before used. We have moreover 
Xa=x+x'^ where x' designates the mass of condensed water that re- 
mains in suspension. We could have given another form to the preced- 
ing equation by choosing as variables p and T in place of v and T. 

Integration furnishes the equation of the adiabatic under a finite 
form. If we pass from an initial condition designated by the subscript 
1 to a final condition designated by the subscript 2 the equation of the 
adiabatic is 

AR.logJ+(c„+^Jlog^^-f:'i,'*^-^^J=0 (9) 

Pseudoadiabatia. — When the condensed water is separated wholly or 
in part from the mass of air, exterior work is done, and consequently 
there is a loss of heat. The changes of condition in this case are called 
pseudoadiahatichj Bezold. He gives this name especially to the curve 
described by the indicator when all the water that is formed falls to 
the ground without increasing the energy of the mass of gas and with- 
out other loss than that just mentioned ; actually the fall of rain does 
communicate some energy to the air. 

The differential equation of the pseudo- adiabatic is 

(c„+^)^T+T<2(^^^-fAR,T^=0 (10) 

This equation is independent of iP„ or the quantity of saturated vapor 
that existed at the moment when the rain stage began ; it is also inde- 
pendent of the quantity of water formed, and consequently on our 
hypothesis, fallen to the ground since the beginning of the rain stage. 
In equation (10) x represents the quantity of saturated vapor that exists 
at any given moment. 

Integrating this equation between an initial condition designated by 
the subscript 1 and a final condition designated by the subscript 2 we 
obtain 

AD 1 ^2, , T2 f'xdT x^r-i Xir^

remark that in the third term the integral is here present only as a cor- 
rection whose vahie is comprised between very small limits. By com- 
paring the adiabatic and the pseudo-adiabatic that start from the same 
initial point we find that this latter curve is the one that most rapidly 
approaches the axis of v. 

(D.) iHE SNOW STAGE AND THE HAIL STAGE. — These are treated by 
Bezold in a manner entirely similar to the preceding. He gives the 
following examples of application of his methods. 

{A) Foehn. — In the Foehn, moist air expanding by ascending the 
sides of a mountain is then compressed when it descends upon the other 
slope, all without any addition or diminution of its heat. The curves 
representing these changes of condition are therefore adiabatics. 

In Fig. 5, let a be the position 
of the indicator for the condition ^ *» ^^ 
corresponding to the initial con- 
dition ; 8a Sa the corresponding 
line of saturation ; as the air ex- 
pands the indicator moves cor- 
respondingly along the adiabatic 
ab down to the point b, where this 
curve reaches the line of satura- 
tion Sa. The arc ab is located 
really in a plane parallel to the 
plane j^ov of the diagram, and at a 
distance from this plane equal to 
the mass x^ of the vapor of water 
that accompanies 1 kilogram of the dry air. 

From atob the adiabatic crosses a series of isotherms, of which the 
first one only, namely, the dotted line Ta Ta is traced in the diagram, and 
we see that the temperature has fallen continuously. At the moment 
when the indicator cuts the line of saturation at b the dry stage ceases 
and the rain stage begins. The adiabatic ab is now continued by the 
pseudo-adiabatic be, which represents the rain stage. 

The air does not now cease to expand, but the temperature falls more 
slowly ; this is why the curve bo is less steeply inclined to the axis ov and 
intersects continually the lines of saturation for quantities of aqueous 
vapor that are steadily diminishing. 

However, the air arrives at the summit of the mountain and crosses 
it and the compression begins ; at this moment the indicator of the con- 
dition of the air is at c. Then we have the following alternatives: 

(1) All the water that is formed remains in suspension ; in this case 
be is a true adiabatic, and here the change of condition of the air is 
completely reversible. The indicator returns from c to 6 in the rain 
stage, and then from & to a in the dry stage. We find the same con- 
ditions as to temperature, volume, and pressure, on either side of the 
mountain. This case of complete reversibility always occurs when the

400 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

line of saturation has not been attained ; that is to say, when the changes 
have occurred entirely within the dry stage. 

(2) Or, on the other hand, and which generally happens, the water 
that is formed as the indicator passes below /; is separated from the rest 
of the mass by falling to or towards the earth, and be is a pseudo-adi- 
abatic; in this case the change is irreversible, and as the air descends 
along the opposite slope of the mountain the indicator follows a curve 
cd other than be, or the adiabatic of the dry stage. 

We see by the consideration of Fig. 5, that the initial temperature 
will be recovered at a pressure lower than the initial pressure ; that the 
temperatures that are attained become higher and higher, and the ex- 
cess over the former becomes greater in proportion as the air descends 
and is compressed. 

Moreover, the absolute quantity of the aqueous vapor has become 
smaller, therefore the real line parallel to the plane pov, and of which 
cd is the projection, is now much nearer to this plane than was the orig- 
inal line ab. 

Thus we have cold and moist air on one side of the mountain becom- 
ing warm and dry air on the other. Thus we derive all the character- 
istic properties of the Foehn, and explain without difficulty how it is 
that these properties do not pertain to descending winds that have not 
first surmounted a summit, for example, to the winds that simply de- 
scend along the slope of a plateau. 

(B) Interchange of air between a cyclone and anti cyclone, in the sum- 
mer. — The changes of condition of air within a cyclone and anti-cyclone 
are analogous to those of air that has surmounted a mountain ridge. 
Eain within the area of a cyclone, dry weather in a clear sky within an 
anti-cyclone. But whereas, in the case of the Foehn, these changes are 
experienced within an area of small diameter, so that one can neglect 
external thermal actions ; the passage from the cyclonic state to the 
anti-cyclonic is, on the contrary, effected within a space so extended 
that it is necessary to take account of these actions. 

In summer the addition of solar heat is the prevailing power; in 
winter it is the reverse ; the day-time and the night timehave influences 
very nearly like those of summer and winter. In all cases the curves 
representing the condition are no longer adiabatic. 

Let us suppose that the air passes from the cyclonic to the anti-cy- 
clonic condition in the summer time. Starting from an initial condition 
a in the cyclone, the temperature diminishes by expansion and the indi- 
cator of the condition of this mass of air starts to describe the adia- 
batic ab\ but the diminution of temperature is retarded by the addition 
of external heat and the air expands, as shown by the movement of the 
indicator along the curve ab, which is less inclined than the adiabatic 
ab^. It follows that the line of saturation is attained later than it other- 
wise would be, and this corresponds to a higher elevation above the 
surface of the earth of the mass of air under consideration. (See Fig. 6.) 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 



401 




Fig. 6.— Adiabatica. 



In the rain stage the curve he of the change of condition is also less 
inclined than the adiabatic ?>c^ ; at the same time it remains nearer to 
the line of saturation. While traversing 
the line he the condensed vapor is form- 
ing clouds. 

If the addition of external heat con- 
tinues, the air can even return to the 
dry stage along the curve cd ; let c be 
this point where this occurs ; the point 
c will at the same time be the upper 
limit of the lower clouds. 

From & to c the absorptive power of 
the suspended water renders the warm- 
ing by insolation relatively large. But 
when one has entered into the dry stage, 
beyond the point d, the absorptive power of the atmosphere diminishes; 
however, the expansion continues, and with the expansion the cooling, 
and at some point d, which corresponds to the height of the cirrus 
clouds, we enter into the snow stage. The absorption of heat, as we 
go from c to d, has become so feeble that the line cd can be considered 
as an adiabatic. From d to 2 we continue in the snow stage or 
the cirrus-cloud stage. At 2 the air begins to descend in the anti- 
cyclone 

During the first portion of the period of compression the air follows 
a curve 2/, corresponding very nearly to the adiabatic 2/^ of the dry 
stage, but departing from it always a lit tie toward the higher isotherms, 
in proportion as we descend to the lower altitudes, where there exists 
an energetic absorption of heat. 

The final pressure at the point / at the base of the anti-cyclone is 
greater than the initial pressure at the point a at the base of the cyclone. 
Moreover, it generally happens that the point/ is situated to the right 
of the point a, that is to say, that v is larger than v„ or that the air in 
an anticyclone is specifically lighter than in a cyclone. This results 
from the fact that the addition of external heat compensates for the in- 
fluence of compression. 

If the air, descending in the anti-cyclone, encounters a new depres- 
sion, this is represented in the diagram by the dotted line /a, supposing 
everything else to be the same in the old and in the new cyclone. The 
line/cf completes the cycle of the changes of condition. 

((?) Interchanf/es of airbehvecn a cyclone and anti-cyclone, in tcinter. — 
We note at first that the curves of the changes of condition more nearly 
approach the axes of co-ordinates in winter than in the summer, since 
the temperatures remain relatively low and the higher isotherms are not 
attained. At the initial point a tlie pressure is lower and the tempera- 
ture higher ; at the final point d the pressure is higher and tlic tem])era- 
ture lower. The point d is therefore to the left and above the point a. 
H. Mis. 142 26 




402 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Moreover, the curves of condition are in winter nearer the plane jjoi; 
than in summer, because in winter the absolute quantity of aqueous 
vapor contained in the air is always smaller. 

When the air rises in the cyclone, starting from the initial condition a, 
the indicator-point very nearly follows the adiabatic until it attains the 
upper limit of the mass of clouds; in fact, below this limit the insolation 
and the radiation can produce only inappreciable effects. As for the 
rest, in so far as the curve departs from the adiabatic, it approaches the 
axes, contrary to what happens in the summer time. 

In the accompanying diagram, Fig. 
j.^ 7, abe is the curve of conditions from 

I the initial point a up to the moment 

\ when the comjjression begins. We 

have supposed that the initial ruass 
passes immediately from the dry stage 
ab to the snow stage be. 

It is probable that at high altitudes 
the compression of the descending air 

Ta proceeds adiabatically, according to 

the adiabatic of the dry stage; but 
V nearer the ground the radiation causes 

Fig. 7. — Adiabatics. i • , • , •, ,-, t , 

a deviation toward the co-ordinate 
axis ov. Thus one obtains a curve somewhat analogous to cd in Fig. 
7. The curve cd is only a graphic representation of the well-known 
fact that there is an inversion in the vertical distribution of tempera- 
ture during clear days in winter. 

Near d the curve apjjroaches the line of saturation, so that it may 
even intersect it ; this case corresponds to the formation of fog at the 
surface of the ground. 

Numerical data are wanting to determine whether the passage from 
c to ^ can be made in any other manner, as when the cooling exerts its 
action near the point c. The curve of condition in the plane jwi' would 
then possess a double point. 

These examples suffice to enable us to judge of the usefulness of this 
graphic method, devised by Bezold, and of which, as he says, when per- 
fected from a mathematical point of view, this method will give an ex- 
cellent means of discussing the numerical data furnished by observa- 
tion ; it will at the same time make known in what direction other ob- 
servations are to be sought to the greater profit of dynamic meteorology. 

In his second memoir of November, 1888, Bezold adopts the term, 
"potential temperatures" as equivalent to Helmholtz's expression 
" thermal contents," and as the term has been applied by the latter it 
will, we hope, obtain general use, although it is perhaps objectionable, 
as involving a new modification of the much used word potential. The 
"potential temperature" is simply the absolute temperature that a 
body would assume if it were brought to a normal pressure without

Adiabatic or pseudo-adiabatic changes of free air that do not involve 
evaporation either leave the potential temperature unchanged or increase 
it, but never diminish it. Bezold uses the term to simplify the state- 
ment of theorems in atmospheric circulation. 

v.— PREDICTION OF STORMS AND WEATHER. 

(28) Abbe. — In 1871 the present writer prepared a short sketch of 
views held by himself and other meteorologists with reference to the 
laws of storms and methods of weather predictions. Three editions of 
this sketch were published by the Signal Office under the title of " Sug- 
gestions as to the Practical Use of Meteorological Reports and Weather 
Maps." A fourth edition, under the title of "How to Use Weather 
Maps," was prepared in 1883 and printed without charts in 1884, but 
has not yet been published, and will be replaced by a more recent re- 
port compiled at the request of General Greely as chief signal officer. 
As a popular presentation of most of the principles that underlie a 
philosophical system of weather predictions the last v,hapter of the 
work, as printed in 1884, is perhaps worthy of the attention of the 
reader, and a rather full synopsis of it is here given, so that the course 
of the entire argument maybe seen. This chapter is entitled "The 
Prediction of Storms and the Weather by the use of daily Weather 
Maps." 

The weather maps first prepared at the Signal Ofiice were based upon 
observations taken simultaneously at 7:35 A. m., 4:35 and 11:35 P. M., 
subsequently these hours were changed to 7 A. m.,3 p. m., and 11 P. M., 
Wasbington time ; after the introduction of standard seventy-fifth meri- 
dian time the hours were 7, 3, and 10 standard time. Since July, 1888, 
they have been 8 A. M. and 8 p. m. standard time. The present remarks 
refer to the earlier series, but are very nearly applicable to the others. 

The early morning map gives the condition of the atmosphere at a 
moment of almost perfect repose, so far as concerns the disturbing in- 
fluence of the direct radiation of the sun. 

The mid-day map gives the condition at the moment when this dis- 
turbing influence is nearly at its maximum. The evening map is, as it 
were, an instantaneous photograph of the condition of the atmosphere 
while it is rapidly quieting down during the absence of the sun. 

Were there no heat received from the sun the whole atmosphere, with 
the land and the ocean, would rapidly cool off, moisture would con- 
dense, winds would cease, except possibly very gentle currents, and tiie 
prediction of the weather would be re luced to the simplicity of a per- 
fect uniformity. The first step in the problem of weather prediction 
therefore is to determine the nature and amount of the disturbing in- 
fluences exerted from day to day by the heat of the sun, which latter is 
the sole ultimate cause of the origin and motion of storms. 

(I) Insolation. — The solar radiation received at any station varies in 
intensity with the season and the hour of the day, depending slightly 



404 RECORD OF SCIENCE P'OR 1887 AND 1888. 

on the distance of the earth from the sun, but principally on the appar- 
ent solar altitude above the horizon and on the length of the day. The 
relative number of units of heat received by a horizontal surface, at the 
outer surface of the atmosphere, in the course of twe itj-four liours is 
shown for each month and each latitude either graphically or in the 
numerical table No. i, which is here omitted as not necessary to this 
abstract of the course of the argument. 

Tlie relative number of utnts of heat received at the outer surface of 
the atmosphere during an entire year is shown by n. similar Table No. 
II. According to Pouillet the total amount of solar heat received an- 
nually at the outer surface of the atmosphere is equivalent to 231,075 
calories per square centimeter, or an amount of heat that would melt a 
layer of ice 30.89 meters thick, or evaporate into vapor a layer of water 
about 4 meters deep, having a temperature of 5° C. (45° F.), or 3.9 
meters, having a temperature of 27° C. (80° F.). The most recent 
measures make the solar radiation about 20 per cent, larger than this. 

The relative amounts of solar heat received at the outer surface of 
the atmosphere for the intervals between the three moments for whicli 
the Signal Service tri-daily weather maps are made up, are given in the 
numerical table, iii, and are also graphically shown on charts by lines 
of equal amounts of solar heat received at all parts of the earth. 

(II) The results of insolation. — The effects of solar heat before and 
after it reaches the earth's surface are analyzed as follows: 

A portion is (1) directly and selectively absorbed in its passage 
through the earth's atmosphere to the surface of the earth, or to the 
upper surface of a layer of fog or clouds, and does molecular work in 
the air and vapor; the remaining portion passes directly, or after difiuse 
reflection, finally to the earth's surface, and either (2) evaporates moist- 
ure from the surfaces of the ocean, earth, clouds, leaves of plants, etc., 
or (3) it heats up these latter and all other bodies, which, in turn com- 
mniiicate the greater part of their heat by convection (4) and radiation 
(5) to the adjacent air, although (6) a little is conducted down to a depth 
of 50 or 100 feet, whence it returns subsequently. We will consider 
these in detail. 

(I) Atmospheric absorption. — When the sun is near the zenith, about 
25 per cent, (according to Pouillet) of the energy in its vertical raj's is 
absorbed by the atmosphere before it reaches the earth's surfiice — the 
quantity absorbed is loss in proportion as tlie air is purer and lighter, 
and on the clearest days, at the summit of mountains 15,000 feet high, 
the zenithal absorption is only about 20 percent. ; the difference is the 
quantity absorbed in the lowest portion of our atmosphere, and which 
is largely utilized in preventing the condensation of invisible aqueous 
vapor. The researches of Langley indicate that much more than 25 per 
cent, is absorbed by the atmosphere, that percentage applying only to 
the rays that more easily ])enetrate the air, and that jiossibly as much 
as 50 per cent, is the total absorption, as was indicated by Forbes in 1842. 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGV. 



405 



According to Pouillet (Paris, Coinptes Reiuliis, 1838, tome vir, pp. 
24-65), a surface of 1 square centimeter exposed perpendicularly to the 
sun's rays at the outer limit of the atmosphere receives 0.00L7G33 cal- 
orie per minute (this calorie being the amount of heat required to raise 
I kilogram of water 1<^ C). The same plate at the earth's surface 
and with the sun in the zenith would, owing to the absorption by the 
atmosphere, receive only 0.76 of the above, or 0.0013401 calorie per 
minute. 

(This is the result of observation on six very clear days in 1837-'38, 
but observations by others have generally shown a higher value for the 
amount of heat originally incident on the outer surface of the atmos- 
phere.) 

Adopting 25 instead of 24 per cent, as an approximation to the ab- 
sorption by our atmosphere in the clearest weather, when the sun is in 
the zenith, it has been shown that of the total heat received by the 
illuminated half of the earth and atmosphere, about 40 per cent, is 
absorbed by the air, and about 60 per cent, reaches the surface of the 
earth; this latter is the average percentage for the whole illuminated 
disk whose border receives at the earth's surface no transmitted heat, 
but whose center receives 75 per cent, of that incident on the outer at- 
mosphere. 

Therefore, in order to know the distribution over the earth's surface 
of the heat that penetrates the atmosphere, we must subtract this large 
absorption from the figures in Tables i, ii, and iii (omitted here for 
brevity, but easily found in Meech, Angot, Radau, Heuuessy, and other 
authorities), and thus obtain the results given in Tables iv, V, and vi, 
as follows :

(2) Evaporation. — The quautity of moisture evaporated throughout 
the whole globe must be equivalent to the total precipitation of rain, 
isuow, etc., otherwise there would be a steady increase or diminution 
iustead of the present condition of approximate equilibrium ; but the 
local variations and irregularities in the distribution of this moisture 
are very great, and constitute a secondary cause of the periodical, diur- 
nal, annual, and secular changes, variations in the weather, and espe- 
cially of the non-periodical variations or the so-called storms, droughts, 
etc. The periodical chauges in the evaporation are roughly indicated 
by the figures in Table vii. (Omitted.) 

The Table vii, however, relates only to average periodical eflfects. In 
order to compute the special cases of evaporation that are particularly 
iuteresting in the study of the daily weather map recourse must be had 
to the formula of Weilenmanu, or to its modifications by Stelling, and 
more recently by Fitzgerald or to the observations by Eussell. 

It is very important to keep in mind the relative amounts of evapo. 
ration going on in all portions of the country, and it is recommended 
to enter upon various portions of the weather map, on the scale of 10 
or 100, some number expressing in a general way the probable relative 
activity during the coming twenty-four hours. In the compilation of 
such a set of numbers Tables vii, viii, ix, x, xii (omitted) are furnished 
as helps to a rapid approximation. 

(3) Absorption; (4) Convection; (5) Radiation; (6) Conduction. — The 
quality and amount of heat absorbed by the earth and afterward given

either by convection or radiation into the atmosphere from the earth's 
surface will vary with the nature of that surface; the relative quan- 
tities are roughly expressed in a numerical table (xiii). 

The relative amounts of heat that reach the earth's surface will de- 
pend upon the percentage of cloudiness and the altitude of the sun some- 
what as given in a numerical table (xiv). 

(III) Resulting density of the air. — By a combination of the numbers 
given in the preceding tables and charts there may, in a rough way, be 
indicated by relative numbers written upon the tri-daily maps what it 
is expected will be the amount of heat and moisture added to any region 
of the lower atmosphere during the interval between any two weather 
charts. The effe:;t of this heat and moisture is to forcibly alter the den- 
sity of the atmosphere, hot or moist air being lighter than cold or dry 
air, assuming, of course, the barometric pressure to be the same in both 
cases. These relative densities are shown in the Table xv, for per- 
fectly dry air (relative humidity, 0) and for perfectly saturated air (rel- 
ative humidity 100). 

By means of Table xvone is able finally to construct a map showing 
relative densities of the lower or surface air over the United States 
during the next eight or twenty-four hours. After much experience 
one becomes able to make a rapid general mental summary of these 
diverse influences without the labor of recording the items upon the 
daily maps, and this is practically the method followed in daily routine 
work. 

Now, the normal distribution of density is that on which the general 
movements of the atmosphere depend, and the deviations shown by the 
above map of densities will give a clue to the new disturbances that will 
l)erhaps be initiated during the day. The normal distribution of tem- 
l^erature, pressure, and winds is shown by the monthly and annual 
maps. (Omitted.) Similar charts should be constructed for both hem- 
ispheres when studying international meteorology. 

The Table xv, just explained, shows that the relative density of the 
atmosphere is much more likelj" to be disturbed by changes of tempera- 
ture than of moisture; thus at 70° of temperature an increase of tem- 
perature by 10° diminishes the density 0.018, while at the same tempera- 
ture an increase of moisture up to full saturation of the atmosphere 
diminishes the density 0.008. An abnormal change of temperature is 
therefore to be carefully looked for as a cause of further disturbance, 
but after a disturbance is once set up the moisture becomes the most 
important consideration, since its condensation alters the vertical dis- 
tribution of temperature. 

(IV) Wind, Friction, and Pressure. — The general distribution of den- 
sity over the earth's surface determines the flow of the denser air of the 
polar regions toward and under the lighter air of the equator, and Pro- 
fessor Ferrel has shown that from this (and the rotation of the earth on 
its axis) results the general distribution of pressure prevailing through- 



408 RECORD OP^ SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

out the atmosphere. This distribution is very much aft'ectetl by the 
presence of oceans, continents, mountain ranges, and pkxteaus which 
determine the irregular distribution of density and the irregalar resist- 
ances to the winds. Were the coefficient of friction uniform throughout 
the whole of the earth's surface the distribution of winds and pressure 
woukl be much simpler, but as affected by friction it is complicated, as 
is shown by the isobars on the charts of monthly mean values. 

As the elevations throughout the United States must therefore be 
carefully borne in mind, because of their bearing on the question of their 
resistances to the motions of the atmosphere, and still more for the 
thermodynamic reasons shown further on, therefore a hypsometric 
map is provided. On this map may be introduced relative numbers, 
changing with the seasons, showing the local frictional resistance at a 
standard altitude, or the relative drag of the air blowing over different 
surfaces; approximate estimates of these numbers are given in the 
Table xvi. 

The increase of wind velocities at various moderate heights above 
fields of grass, grain, etc., is given by Stevenson and by Archibald, and 
may be assumed to be as the square root of the altitude. 

Any departure from the normal densities must be followed by a dis- 
turbance in the flow of air from the denser toward the lighter. 

This disturbed movement of the air produces at once a change in the 
distribution of barometric pressure, which change becomes greater in 
proportion to the movement ; the observed barometric changes are thus 
principally dependent upon the wind, and in daily predictions it is con- 
venient to use the barometer as an index of what movements are going 
on in the atmosphere in the absence of observations of temperature 
and winds above or beyond the limits of our stations. 

The relations between pressure and wind are given in Professor Fer- 
rel's works, as also in those of Oberbeck and Guldberg and Mohn, from 
which it will be seen that a very slight difference of i^ressure produced 
by a very slight difference of density is sufficient to set the atmosphere 
in motion in the direction of an " initial gradient," the result of which 
is immediately to produce a vorticose motion and a steeper " barometric 
gradient " nearly perpendicular to the initial gradient and to the mo- 
tion of the wind ; these steep gradients accompany all storms, and are 
exemplified in Ferrel's " Movements on the Surface of the Earth," 1858, 
"Meteorological Eesearches, part ii," 1877, and "Eecent Advances," 
1886. 

The resistances to the motion of the atmosphere would, however, soon 
bring it to rest, and the abnormal isobars would soon disappear or re- 
lapse into the normal ones, were there not some force at work maintain- 
ing the disturbance of density and the abnormal motions. A success- 
ful storm prediction must depend upon the accuracy with which one 
can determine the amount, location, and effects of the force that main- 
tains this disturbance.

(V) The disturbing force. — The disturbing force is recognized as the 
solar beat, either directly absorbed by the air or evolved by the con- 
densation of aqueous vapor in the atmosphere; the former has already 
been considered and the latter must now be studied. This involves 
(I) the amount of aqueous vapor and (2; its condensation. 

(1) Amount of vapor. — The normal distribution of vapor in the at- 
mosphere at sea-level is suggested by the hygrometric table (xvii), 
which in its three sections, a, b, and c, gives the monthly normal values 
of the mean dew-point, the mean weight, and tension of vapor for a few 
stations in North America. 

Knowing the temperature of the dew-point, one can determine the 
weight of the vapor contained in any volume of air, and also the ten- 
sion of the vapor by the use of the accompanying table, xviii :

The geographical distribution of moisture at the earth's surface is 
best shown by charts of lines of equal tension or dew-point. A com- 
parison of such hygrometric charts for each of the daily reports shows 
the presence of regions where moisture is in excess or is deficient, and 
where a given cooling will produce precipitation. 

The normal distribution of moisture in successive strata of the at- 
mosphere is shown approximately in the second column of the follow- 
ing table (XIX), computed by the formula of Hann, but which is based 
on observations in continental areas, and may not so closely represent 
the conditions over the oceaus :

Besides the observation of local dew-point, the amount of moisture in 
the whole layer of air above us can jjerhaps be directly determined, as 
per example, by means of the spectroscope or the cyauometer, at each 
station ; but as these observations have not as yet been reduced to a 
system the Signal Service makes use of what is called a sunset obser- 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 411 

vation, that is to say, the api)earauce of the sky at suuset is recorded 
as yellow, red, or ^reeu. These sky colors vary with the chauging 
amounts of moisture through which the sun's rays pass. From these 
appearances an observer can form an estimate of the general hygro- 
metric condition of large tracts of the atmosphere. 

(2) Condensation of vapor. — When a mass of air, whether dry or 
moist, is, on account of its relative lightness, lifted up by the pressure 
of the surrounding denser atmosphere, or is drawn up by any abnor- 
mal diminution of the pressure above, or is pushed up the incline of a 
mountain or plateau, it is raised into a region where the barometric 
pressure is less than in its initial position. Consequently the rising 
mass must expand to an extent proportional to the diminution of press- 
ure. In this expansion a great amount of both internal and external 
work is done, corresponding, respectively, with the increased separation 
of the gaseous molecules and the pushing aside of surrounding air; 
this work is done at the expense of the internal heat of the rising air, 
consequently the whole expanding mass of mixed air and vapor grows 
cooler as it rises. 

The cooling process is known as a dynamic cooling, and takes place 
uniformly and simultaneously throughout the whole rising mass of air. 
It is a very different process from the much slower processes of cooling 
by radiation or by convection. For dry air the rate of dynamic cooling 
is almost the same for all pressures and temperatures, and is approxi- 
mately 1° C. forever^' 100 meters of ascent or 1° Fahr. for 180,5 feet; 
for moist air the rate of diminution of temperature is a little slower, 
but the above value may also be used for it so long as no moisture is 
condensed, that is to say, so long as the temperature does not fall be- 
low the dew-point. 

From the preceding it follows that the elevation above the ground 
at which cloud or haze begins to be formed depends primarih^ upon the 
depression of the dew-point of the rising air below its temperature at 
the time when it starts from the ground. 

The third column of Table xxii gives an idea of this relation be- 
tween altitude and temperature.

Conversely, when the air is drawn or forced down from the upper 
regions it comes under greater pressure and is compressed and warmed 
at the same rate as above, namely, 1° Fahr. for 180.5 feet or O.^SS 
Fahr. for 100 feet. But this latter warming (like the preceding cool- 
ing) is so largely afi'ected by radiation of heat, absorption of solar heat, 
the mixing with air that has a different temperature, and by the absorp- 
tion of heat in the process that is the reverse of condensation, i. e., that 
of evaporating fog and other forms of water, that the actual average 
rate of cooling, as we ascend in the air, is barely one-half of the above, 
i. e., 0.033 Fahr. per 100 feet or OPQ C. per 100 meters. 

The fourth column in Table xxii shows the elevation at which haze 
or cloud begins to be formed by the actual observed rate of cooling in 
an ascending mass, the initial depression of whose dew-point is known. 
Conversely, if we actually observe the height to which a mass of air 
has ascended, when it begins to become hazy or cloudy, we can from this 
last column deduce, at least approximately, the corresponding depres- 
sion of the dew-point that obtained at its place of starting. 

The cooling by ascension is therefore not a truly adiabatic process. 
Espy's rule of an ascent of 100 yards for each degree of depression of 
the dew point is thus seen to be a close approximation. 

As soon as the dew-point is reached in this process of ascension and 
cooling the condensation of vapor is accompanied by evolution of the 
latent heat of steam, that is to say, of the enormous amount of heat 
originally required to convert the water into invisible vapor, and which 
has been carried from the surface of the earth up into the cloud region, 
where it is now ready to be set free.

This evolution of latent heat without wholly checking the rate at 
which the ascending air is cooling, diminishes its rate nearly in propor- 
tion to the amount of vapor condensed ; therefore the interior of aclo:id 
is warmer and lighter than the interior of a corresponding njass of clear 
dry air that has attained the same level. The rate at which the tem- 
perature diminishes within a mass of ascending, expanding and con- 
densing, saturated air, such as that of which clouds are composed, de- 
pends almost wholly on thermodynamic adiabatic conditions, and is 
shown in the following table (xxiii), by Hann, for various initial 
pressures and temperatures :

Note.— The approximate altitudes in feet are computed on the assumption of 50° Fahr. as the 
average temperature of the air column. 



Thus we see for instance, that with a dew-point of 32° Fahr. the foggy 
air, which near sea-level cools 3o.5 for 1,000 feet of ascent, will, when it 
becomes a cloud at an elevation of about 15,500 feet or when the press- 
ure is about 17 inches, be cooling at the rate of 2o.8 per 1,000 feet, and, 
in general, the higher the saturated air ascends the slower it cools. So 
far, then, as concerns this important cause the ascent of moist currents 
would continue indefinitely, but the continued loss of water by its fall 
as rain, and the more rapid loss of heat by surface radiation at the 
higher altitudes, or the absorption of solar heat by the clouds probably 
determines the limiting form and the height of the outer or upper sur- 
face of the clouds. 

The average altitudes at which these clouds are respectively formed 
may be approximated from the following table (xxiv), for Berlin, by

In addition to the intrinsic lightness and ascensive power of every 
cloud, due to its internal moisture and heat, another powerful external 
influence comes into play. It has been before said that about 85 per 
cent, of the radiated solar heat penetrates the atmosphere to within 
15,000 feet of the earth's surface. But no a[»preciable part of this is 
able to penetrate through a thick layer of cloud or fog. Consequently 
all the heat that falls upon the top of a cloud is retained therein instead 
of reaching the earth's surface, and, both by evaporating the particles 
of vapor and by warming the adjacent air, contributes powerfully to 
diminish the specific gravity of the cloud as a whole, increasing the up- 
draft and disturbing the vertical distribution of heat in the atmosphere. 
The maximum temperature thus communicated to the top of a cloud is 
not far from the maximum temperature attainable anywhere at the sur- 
face of the earth. 

(VI) Special suggestions. — It will therefore be seen that invisible aque- 
ous vapor disturbs the equilibrium of the atmosphere in the following 
three ways : 

(1) By its evaporation and subsequent distribution throughout the 
air it renders the atmosphere, over certain geographical sections, spe 
cifically lighter than others. 

(2) By its condensation into fog or clouds and rain or snow it transfers 
to distant regions the heat that had been accumulating in each particle 
before its evaporation at the earth's surface. 

(3) In the form of fog or cloud it causes to be retained, at the upper 
surface of the cloud, the total amount of heat that would otherwise 
reach the earth, thus increasing the up-draft within a cloud, but dimin- 
ishing the evaporation at the earth's surface, by which the clouds are 
supplied with moisture. 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 415 

A philosophical prediction as to the origin, development, and move- 
ment of a storm must take account of the three items above, bat in the 
rapid approximate -work of the Signal Service indication-room there is 
need to avoid tables and calculations as much as possible and to seek 
to obtain from direct observations such indications as they will give. 

The first item is already i)rovided for in the maps showing dew-point 
and relative humidity. With regard to the second item, the study of the 
clouds and fog, the past and the prevalent rainfall, the weather, and 
daily range of temperature from maximum to minimum give indications 
as to the extent of the process of condensation at any moment, and the 
evolution of heat dependent thereon, and the student is guided by con- 
siderations such as the following : 

(a) Fog at the earth's surface bespeaks clear dry air above, free from 
cloud or haze, through which radiation is taking place rapidly ; hence it 
implies the absence of uprising convective currents ; hence also the gen- 
eral jirevaleuce of a stable equilibrium as regards vertical temperature 
gradient. The time of day at which the fog breaks up under the solar 
radiation indicates the thickness of the layer. 

(&) Clear weather followed by cirrus clouds, increasing in quantity at 
the successive reports, and these again followed by small cumuli, indi- 
cate the advance of overlying areas of moist air or a steadily increas- 
ing amount of moisture that is being locally carried up into the air. 
These clouds are soon followed by larger cumuli, and these by rain and 
storm centers. 

(c) The range of temperature between 11 p. m. and the morning mini- 
mum (or in lieu thereof an early observation) has its maximum when 
radiation takes place uninterruptedly through a clear dry atmosphere, 
and diminishes in proportion as moisture, haze, and cloudiness increase. 
If therefore we make allowance for the effect of the wind in bringing 
to the thermometer warm or cold air we shall find this range of tem- 
perature a valuable index to the condition of the mass of air overhead. 
In place of this indirect process of reasoning, it is probable that direct 
observations, with proper apparatus, of the intensity of radiation would 
give better results. 

(d) The slightest foilnation of haze in a clear sky in the evening 
proves that the upper layers are cooling to their dew-point. Fre- 
quently the 11 p. M. observations will give such indications as show that 
before 7 A. M. the sky will probably be covered with cloud, and possibly 
followed by rain or snow. This cooling is partly due to radiation, as 
the vapor is a good radiator, but it is also frequently due to a dynamical 
cooling of rising air currents flowing toward a distant area of low press- 
ure. As soon as clouds form, the air beneath ceases to cool by radia- 
tion and the area that was clear at 11 P. M. is, by sunrise, covered by 
a layer of cloud that protects the warm air, whose buoyancy increases 
during the day and specially favors the formation of a local new storm 
center. In this way many centers originate within a few hours in Mary- 



416 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

land, Virginia, and North Carolina in the early morning following a 
clear evening. 

(e) A report of rain or snow-fall during any interval indicates that 
the process of cloud formation has gone onto its extreme limit; the 
quantity of rain is an index to the relative amounts of latent heat tem- 
jiorarily left behind in the cloud stratum to be slowly lost by radiation ; 
hence it shows the disturbance over different parts of the country of 
the normal distribution of density. Where however only little rain 
has fallen while the cloud stratum is extensive and dense, the total dis- 
turbance due to the general warmth of air and cloud over the whole 
region may be equally great, but not especially intense at any one point. 

(VII) Prediction of the weather. — The preceding considerations, which 
are those that guided me in my earliest predictions in Cincinnati and 
Washington, will enable any one to enter upon any series of charts of 
existing conditions a system of numbers showing the places over which 
the atmospheric disturbance in the cloud region is — or is likely to be — 
appreciable, and to judge of its relative intensity as depending on the 
excess or deficiency in the density of the air. From this we can reason 
as to the first tendency of the movements of the air or the initial wind. 
The consideration of the orography of the surrounding country will then 
give us the basis for a conclusion as to whether in any region the gen- 
eral movement of the atmosphere will tend to cool or warm any mass of 
air (especially by carrying it over rising or resisting ground and forcing 
it up to the higher levels or by pushing cold air under warm air), and 
thereby initiate a still further condensation and exaggerate the disturb- 
ances already existing, or possibly producing local rain and wholly new 
centers of disturbance. By thus considering as fully as possible the 
effects of solar heat, atmospheric moisture, orography, etc., we are able 
to enter upon the weather map a series of figures showing our estimate 
of all the disturbances likely to occur during the immediate future. In 
general, we find that convective disturbances of equilibrium tncrease 
from the morning map to the afternoon map, and diminish from the 11 
p. M. to the 7 A. M. map; during the interval from 3 p. M. to 11 P. M. 
the larger disturbances, such as thunder storms, tornadoes, and hurri- 
canes, generally attain a maximum and begin *to diminish. The phe- 
nomena specially due to terrestrial radiation have their maximum effect 
between the 11 P. m. and 7 A. m. reports; between these hours we find, 
for instance, that many extensive storms begin over regions for which at 
11 P. M. the reports show clear weather. As the prevailing and probable 
future direction and force of the wind are so important, it becomes very 
necessary, in dealing with a limited part of the earth's surface, to ex- 
amine the reports from outlying border stations in order to ascertain 
the possible existence at a distance of unseen centers of disturbance ; a 
slight abnormal fall in the barometer, or rise of temperature, or shift of 
winds, or increase in cloud and rain may be the indicator of a distant 
storm ; equally frequent is it that a general rise of pressure or increase

of cold uortherly wiuds indicates the existence of an unseen low ba- 
rometer and severe storm to the southwest or southeast, toward which 
these wiuds are blowing. Perhaps the most useful rule iu this respect 
is founded on tlie motions of clouds. The following- generalization 
(announced by me in February 1872 as resulting from the study of up- 
per and lower clouds and winds displayed on every Signal Service map 
and quite independent of simultaneous European studies), will, it is be- 
lieved, be found U) hold good for the whole northern hemiispliere: '' The 
general direction towards which any stratum of air is moving nearly hori- 
zontally, is somewhat to the right hand of the direction of motion of the 
stratum just above it, that is to say, the direction of the lower clouds 
is to the right of tbat of the wind at the earth's surface; the higher 
clouds move to the right of the lower clouds and the cirrus again to the 
right of the latter ; these directions of motion may be so related that 
the cirrus shall )/e moviug in a direction nearl}' opposite to that of the 
surface wiuds or the lower clouds. In general, when the lower currents 
are flowing iu toward a storm center the upper currents are flowing out 
from it; or agani, when the lower currents are flowing out from an 
area of high pressure and clear, dry weather the upper currents are 
flowing in towards it." It follows that when an outlying station reports 
the motions of the cirrus cloud, we are able to infer something as to the ex- 
istence of the area of the low barometer from which the cirri are coming. 

(I) Frediction of general storms. — When we have thus approximately 
estimated the probable location and amount of the disturbances in den- 
sity over all portions of the United States and outlying regions, we are 
then to decide whether a storm already initiated will increase or di- 
minish in intensity, and in what direction its center will move. 

It may be accepted as a fundamental principle that a given disturb- 
ance will spread in the direction of those regions where processes 
are going on thar favor similar disturbances. Thus, if a mass of heavy 
air, like the northers of the Mississippi Valley, is flowing in any direc- 
tion under a mass of abnormally light air, it will tend to move always 
in the direction vhere the lightest air is to be found, or where the di- 
urnal changes of heat and evaporation favor the development of ab- 
normally light ar. Or again, if a storm is already in existence and 
is maintained by the condensation of moisture in the cloud region, it 
will be continuously moving toward the region where the condensation 
is going on most actively. The regions where storms are being initi- 
ated or most liberally supported are generally detected (1) by observed 
abnormal temperature and moisture ; (2) by the formation of haze, halos, 
cloud, and rain or snow; and (3) by a slight fall iu the barometer due 
to movements ii: the atmosphere at the level of the cloud stratum. 
The future movements of storm centers can generally be dete(!ted by 
the observed changes going on in the direction of movement of the wind 
or clouds. All of these meteorological elements must be examined by 
careful com[)arisnns of the preceding tridaily ma[»s in order to ascer- 
H. Mis. U2 27 



418 RECORD OB^ SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

tain whether a given storm will increase or diminish, and especially 
whether it will follow some one of the average storm tracks, or whether 
it will make special deviation from them. The general paths pursued 
by storm centers and their average velocities can be used only for 
general climatic indications, and not for special storm predictions. 
Detailed maps of the direction and velocity of the movements of storm 
centers in the United States have been jirepared; a general view of the 
so-called storm frequency, or, more properly, the frequency with which 
barometric minima (sometimes without violent winds) pass over each 
section of the country, is given by a chart designed and prepared by me 
in 1874, and published in Walker's Statistical Atlas of the United States. 
With these barometric minima generally come clouds,rain and snow, high 
winds, suddenly shifting from south and east to west and north, warm, 
moist, followed by colder, dry weatliei-, and all the characteristics of 
very variable severe climates. A more complete chart, showing the 
total number of times that such barometric minima have dnring the ten 
years October, 1872, to September, 1882, passed over each degree square 
of the territory east of the meridian of 102° west longitude, has been 
prepared, and gives a basis for many climatic generalities. 

The prediction of a special storm path, or its deviation from a normal 
path (if such a term is allowable) must be based upon a detailed study 
of all the above mentioned disturbing or controlling influences. Some 
of the average effects of these influences are shown in the following par- 
agraphs : 

(«) Maydell, from the study of the storms of Northern Europe, showed 
in 1873 that the storm path for the coming twenty-four hours forms a 
determinate angle with the line connecting the present place of the bar- 
ometric minimum with that of the greatest rise of temperature in the 
past twenty-four hours. This angle is always formed on the left hand 
of that connecting line, supposing the face to be turned towards the 
point of rising temperature and the back towards the pouit of minimum 
barometer. This angle varies between zero and 90 degrees, as the ex- 
treme cases, while it is on the average in winter about 00 degrees ; the 
summer storm tracks are classified in two groups, for which this angle 
is respectively 40 and 70 degrees. The angle depends to a certain ex- 
tent upon the position of the center of highest temperature, being 
smaller according as the point lies more to the east of the barometric 
minimum. (See Maydell's appendix to the Bulletin for December, 1873, 
of the Physical Observatory at St. Petersburg.) 

INl ay deli's rules accord with my own experience ; the elevation of tem- 
l)erature befoie a storm had been long known both for England and for 
the United States, but the amount of angular deviation of the storm- 
center to the left of the rising temperature is, I think, very little in 
tlie eastern part of the United States. 

(/>) The region over which the greatest rain fall will take place is 
that towards which the storm center will have a strong tendency to 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 419 

move ; the location where it is now raining, as shown by the map, is 
usually near the present location of the center of disturbance and in ad- 
vance of the center of low pressure due to the movement of wind. 
Loomis finds that in the United States the rain area extends farther in 
front than in the rear of the storm ; its mean extent is 500 miles in front, 
and for every increase in this distance the velocity of the storm move- 
ment is increased. He also finds that within the United States much 
more rain fiills in front of the area of low pressure than in its rear; a 
great rnin-fall in the rear retards the motion. 

(e) The barometric changes, being the direct result of horizontal 
winds and only the indirect result of the changes in temperature, mois- 
ture, vertical movements and condensations sum up as it were the re- 
sult of all preceding disturbances. Loomis finds that the velocity of 
progress of a storm is independent of the amount of the central depres- 
sion of the barometer. The average velocity of movement of centers 
of low pressure in the United States is about 20 miles per hour; the 
pressure rises faster in the rear of fast-moving storms ; thus, if the 
pressure in the rear rises 20 per cent, faster than the mean, the storm 
moves 7 miles per hour faster ; if it rises 20 per cent, slower, the storm 
moves 7 miles per hour slower. This is evidently a direct result of the 
fact that the center of indraft up toward the clouds is propagated (not 
moved bodily) forward faster than the lower winds can follow. 

(d) J. Elliot gives the following as the favorable conditions for the 
formation and growth of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, aiul these may, 
with slight modifications, be applied to the Gulf of Mexico and the West 
Indies: 

1. The invariable antecedents of cyclones are approximate uniformity 
of pressure over and around the coast of the Bay of Bengal, light vari- 
able Windsor calms over a considerable portion of the bay, and little or 
no rain-fall over the coast region, as well as in the bay ; the weather is 
therefore sultry and the sea smoother. The amount of aqueous vapor 
accumulates and finally gives rise to peculiar sky effects. The immedi- 
ate antecedent is heavy rain-fall concentrated over a portion of the bay 
accompanied by a strong indraft, most marked from the Indian Ocean 
at the entrance of the bay. This indraft fiom the Iiulian Ocean gives 
rise to strong winds and heavy rains at the stations on the south and 
west coasts of Ceylon. 

2. The source of the energy is the condensation of vapor and precipi- 
tation of rain ; or the primary cause of cyclone formation is the i)rodu(;- 
tion and ascent of a largequantity of \ ai)or, which is condensed with the 
liberation of its latent heat over the ])lace of production, instead of be- 
ing carried away to some distant region. (See .1. Eliot's rei)ort on the 
Madras cyclone of May, 1877, and similar conclusions in his account of 
the southwest monsoon storm of lS8o.) 

(2) rretlictivnof locdl storms. — The tornado is an exaggeration of the 
mild thunder storm, especially in that the revolving cloud that is some-

times seeu liigli up at Ihe base of ibe tbuiider storm uow reaches down 
to the earth, and the violent winds due to its up-draft cause great de- 
struction. These storms occur usually in the broad currents of warm, 
moist southerly winds that prevail on the south and east sides of an area 
of low pressure or general storm center ; they are in fact whirls within 
whirls, and may be expected as likely to occur when on the morning 
weather map the depression of the dew-point is reported as only a few 
degrees, and southerly winds cover the country, blowing toward a storm 
center in the northwest, or lake region. 

(Tile preceding paragraph as written in 1883 expresses a generaliza- 
tion familiar to me since boyhood and in agreement with views of Espy 
and many writers; the conviction of its general truth had led me in 
1871 {ind 1872 to frequently publish in the official daily weather predic- 
tions the paragraph, " Conditions are favorable for severe local storms." 
Any discussion as to the original author of this generalization would 
carry us back to the first weather charts of Leverrier 1858, Henry 1850, 
Espy 1838, Loomis 1838, and Kaemtz 1835, and Brandes 1828.) 

The number of tornadoes likely to occur in any State in any one year 
is shown approximately by the figures in the sixth column of the fol- 
lowing table, as copied from Finley's " Character of Six Hundred Torna-

tion is only fairly shown by adopting some such unit of area as 100 miles 
square or 10,000 square miles, for which unit we find the annual average 
frequency given in the seventh column. The last column of this table 
should replace the misleading statement of the number of tornadoes on 
record in any State, without considering the area of the State or the 
number of years and observers involved in getting together the lists.

Wheu we consider the narrowness and shortness of the destructive 
portion of the paths of most ••tornadoes," we see that even in Kansas 
and Iowa the probability that any given spot will be vi.sited by one is 
at the rate of less than 1 per cent, per century, or less than the chance 
of death by lightning or railroad accident, or other casualty. 

These storms move along nearly with the prevailing gciuMiil current 
of air at the cloud level, but deflecting somewhat as iiillueuced by tbe

of air toward the dark masses of cloud that are overhead, aud within 
which the processes of condensation of moisture, evolution of latent 
heat, and uprising of lighter air are going on with intensity. The de- 
tails of the mechanism of these storms are fully given by Ferrel in his 
"Meteorological Researches, part ii," Washington, 1880 (and in his 
"Recent Advances," Washington, 1886). 

The relative frequency of occurrence of tornadoes in the United States 
for each month is shown by the following table, as given by Finley, who 
has however possibly included a few storms that should more properly 
have ))een classed as destructive thunder storms:

(3) Special local predictions. — Beside the predictions of storms the 
next most important item is the prediction of the separate elements of 
the weather that affect local human industries; especially hoar-frost, 
heat, wiud, and rain. 

(a) Frost. — Severe frosts occur only when the atmosphere is clear ; 
they are in great part the effect of radiation of heat from the surfaces 
of plants and the earth. Their prediction depends principally upon 
the questions, how many degrees will the temperature of the surface of 
leaves of plants fall by radiation ; if it falls to 32° or less, then will the 
atmospheric moisture condense into fog or cloud before or after the 
radiating surface of the plants cools down to that freezing temperature ? 
If on the evening map there are entered, first, a series of relative num- 
bers showing the i)rospective clearnessof the sky; second, a seriesshow- 
ing the time that will elapse before sunrise; then a series showing the 
probable diurnal range of temperature, an estimate can be made of the fall 
in temperature for each section of the country before the next sunrise. 
If now these latter figures are compared with the map showing the 
depression of the dew-point at 11 P. M., those regions will be perceived 
over which fog and clouds are likely to be formed; the remaining or 
clear regions are the only ones in which dew is to be feared, and of 
these only those are in imminent danger of frost at which the dew- 
point is below 32°. 

The probable diurnal range of temperature is best found by study- 
ing the actual fall between 11 p. m. and 7 A. M., as reported during the 
preceding few clear days from the stations in the neighborliood in 
question. The preceding rule takes no account of the wind, which if 



DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 423 

fresh or brisk, will generally prevent or nullify the severity of the frost. 
Areas of cold dry air frequently flow southward and spread as northers 
over large regions of the country, confining themselves especially to the 
low lands and river valleys. Within these areas of clear, cold, dry air, 
and especially on their advancing fronts, the process of freezing is often 
accelerated by the combination of convection with radiation, and in 
such cases the destruction to vegetation is particularly severe; there- 
fore, in the prediction of frosts, attention must be especially directed 
to such areas. The rate at which these advance isof course greater when 
the cold air flows down a gentle incline, such as that of the Mississippi 
Valley. When such cold areas reach the Gulf of Mexico the lowest 
stratum of air moves more rapidly, and after overrunning a large por- 
tion of the Gulf, banks up the atmosphere on the Mexican shore, and 
causes extensive rains, which sometimes initiate cyclones, and return 
as such to the northward. This phenomenon was clearly perceived and 
verbally explained to my fellow-laborers in 1871-'72 in the Signal office ; 
the parallelism between the Norther, the Bore, the Pampero, and sim- 
ilar winds was also then dwelfe on ; the flow of cold air and the forma- 
tion of gulf storms were even then clearly predicted. 

{h) Rain. — For convenience in establishing general rules for the pre- 
diction of rains, they may be divided into four classes, as follows : 

(1) Merely local rains depending almost wholly upon the rapid ascent 
of small masses of over-heated moist air; these occur almost entirely 
between 9 A. m. and 6 p. m., and are oftentimes simultaneous in isolated 
localities over a great extent of the country. They are liable to occur 
whenever the 7 A. m. map shows a high dew-point and clear or nearly 
clear weather, and when the winds are or are about to be such as will 
carry the surface air up a gentle slope; they occur with southerly winds 
in the Gulf States or southeast winds on the Atlantic coast; they occur 
on the latter coast rarely with winds between west and northwest, 
since such winds are carrying the air downwards toward the sea and 
warming it by compression. 

(li) Local rains, on a larger scale, generally accompanied by light- 
ning, and known as thunder storms, occurring in the afternoon between 
3 and 10 o'clock, and due to the uplifting of large masses of moist air 
from the low lands by the underflow of denser {i. e. cooler or drier) air. 
This convective process begins most easily in mountainous regions, 
where the afternoon radiation, during the declining sun, proceeds more 
rapidly than in the low lands ; in fact the dowuflow of cold dry air from 
the mountains is a periodical i>henomena tending to take place regularly 
at all times of the year. The decision of the question as to whether rain 
will follow or not depends upon the balance between the mass of cooled 
air over the mountains and the adjacent moist air. The question can 
generally be decided by considering the time of day at which the for- 
mation of heavy cumuli begins. If, e. </., at Washington this occurs 
later than "> p. m. rain is not likely, if before 3 p. m. rain is probable. 



424 RECORD OP SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Such storms generally show themselves as well uuder way on the 3 t. M. 
map. The geographical distribution of frequency of this class of 
storms for the United States was illustrated by me in the map for Au- 
gust, 1874, imblished in the Signal Service Monthly Weather Keview 
for that month. 

The paths ]nirsued by these thunder storms trend eastward or north- 
eastward, as in Europe, see Mohn and Hildebrandsson. They may 
be classed as (1) those that attend a very low pressure, and (2) those 
that start on the advancing edge of areas of cool, dry air. or high barom- 
eter, and (3) those that occur within and on the rearward side of high 
areas. Quite a number of them may exist simultaneously, for instance, 
along the whole eastern slope of the Appalachian range, all moving in 
nearly parallel lines northeastward until they die out in the early morn- 
ing hours, generally before they reach the Atlantic shore, but sometimes 
extending a little ways out to sea. 

(3) Light general rains occurring between 1 and 8 A. m., and which are 
apparently caused by radiation of heat from a layer of moist air some 
distance above the earth. Frequently when the sky is i^erfectly clear 
at 11 p. M. there prevails over a special region a general strong southerly 
current feeding a storm center to the northward, but not as yet followed 
by any condensation in this special region. It would seem that the 
nocturnal radiation of heat from the moist and hazy sky now comes in 
powerfully to supplement the dynamic cooling, which latter process de- 
pends on ascension, and therefore, of course, is less active during the 
night than during sunshine; accordingly haze and cloud form after 11 
p. M. and light general rains or snow fall in the early morning hours, 
and are reported on the 7 A. M. map ', these are liable to be stopped by 
the sun's heat as soon as that is sufficient to counteract the radiation, 
but when this heat first falls on the cloud top it stimulates the convec- 
tion and the precepitation. The only means of anticipating the occur- 
rence of this class of rains consists in a close observance of all the ante- 
cedent phenomena in order to estimate the probable relative tempera- 
ture and moisture of the air overhead ; the only observations bearing 
on this subject, as shown by the 11 p. m. map, are a slight tendency to 
haze, the formation and disappearance of loose clouds, a slight check in 
the temperature, and especially the reports of halos around the moon, 
to which, according to Montigny, it is important to add the observation 
of the scintillation of the stars. 

(4) Extended heavy rains. These generally attend either areas of 
low pressure, where great masses of air apparently have slow ascend- 
ing and vorticose movements, or prevailing winds that carry great 
masses of moist air up mountain or plateau slopes to higher levels; 
these 1 ains are therefore due principally to dynamic cooling, and are 
well illustrated by easterly storms of the Atlantic coast, the northerly 
storms of the Central American and Mexican coasts, and the southerly 
windsof the Gulf States, Their prediction is implied in the prediction 
of a general storm as before treated of. 



CHEMISTRY FOR 1887 AND 1888. 



By F. W. Clarke. 



GENERAL AND THEORETKIAL. 

Atomic tceights ; oxygen.— The compositiou of water and the relation 
between the atomic weighty of hydrogen and oxygen have been discnssed 
during the year by Cooke and Richards, Scott, Keiser, Morley, and 
Lord Rayleigh. 

Cooke and Richards adopted the following plan : Hydrogen, purified 
with extraordinary care, was weighed in large glass globes which had 
previously been exhausted by means of a Sprengel pump. It was then 
burned by passing it over heated copper oxide, and the water so formed 
was weighed. Three series of experiments, numbering sixteen in all, 
were made, and distinguished from each other by the use of hydrogen 
derived from different sources. First, hydrogen was used which had 
been evolved from zinc and sulphuric acid; secondly, hydrogen was 
obtained by electrolysis ; and in the third series the gas was derived 
from the action of potassium hydroxide upon aluminium foil. In tliis 
way the errors due to possible impurity in hydrogen from only one source 
were sought to be avoided. The mean results by series were as follows, 
when H = l : 

Series I, five experiments 0=15.954 ; ^ .0048 

Series II, fi ve experiments 15.9.53 ; i .0022 

Series III, six experiments 15.952 ; i .0035 

Average of the sixteen experiments 15.953; -[^.0017 

The quantity of hydrogen burned in each experiment was a little over 
0.4 gramme. The only possible impurity in it was nitrogen, which was 
looked for spectroscopically, but not found. Its absence however could 
not be certainly proved, and its effect, if present, would be to render the 
apparent atomic weight of oxygen too low ; in other words, its presence 
would lead to possibly erroneous conclusions relative to 'Trout's law." 
(Proc. Amer. Acad., xxiii, 149.) 

The investigations of Alexander Scott relate to the composition of 
water by volume. It is well known that oxygen and hydrogen, as act- 
ually measured at ordinary temperatures and pressures, do not rigidly 
conform to Boyle's law. Tliey vary from it in opposite directions ; and 
this fact must be taken into account before we can deduce their relative 

425 



426 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

atomic weights from their relative densities. Scott, iu his experiments, 
has paid especial attention to the following points: 

(1) The preparation of purer gases. 

(2) The use of larger volumes. 

(3) The measurement of both gases in the same vessel. 

(4) The analysis of the residue left after explosion of the mixed 
gases, and determination of the impurity in each experiment. 

Twenty-one experiments were made, giving as the most probable ratio 
1.994 volumes of H to one volume of O. Hence, if the density of O iu 
terms of H is l.'5.9627, its atomic weight becomes 16.01. (Proc. Roy. 
Soc, XLii, 396. Chem. News, LVi, 173.) 

Morley's paper (Am. Chem. Journ., x, 21) is essentially a discussion 
of Scott's work, with an outline of proposed methods for the settlement 
of the problems under consideration. 

Lord Eayleigh (Chem. News, lvii, 73) has re-determined the density 
ratio between H and O, and finds it to be 1: 15.884. The application of 
this ratio to atomic- weight discussions depends upon investigations like 
those of Scott. Eayleigh also calls attention to a source of error iu the 
process of weighing gases, which arises from the fact that a glass globe 
when exhausted of air, is sensibly condensed by atmospheric pressure ; 
that is, its capacity when empty is perceptibly less than when full. 
This error affects Eegnault's density determinations. Cooke and Eich- 
ards (Am. Chem. Journ. x, 191) recognize the importance of Eayleigh's 
observations, and apply them to the correction of their own results. 
They determine the magnitude of the error produced in their own glass 
globes, and flnd that it reduces their value for the atomic weight of 
oxygen from 15.953 to 15.869. This is the lowest value yet assigned to 
that constant. 

Keiser attempts to ascertain the composition of water directly by 
weighing hydrogen occluded in palladium, expelling it by heat, burn- 
ing it over copper oxide, and weighing the water so formed. Three pre- 
liminary experiments (Berichte, xx, 2323) gave in sum a value for oxygen 
of 15.8722. In a later i)a;per he gives in detail his process, together 
with his final results. Ten combustions were made, with 6.5588 grammes 
of hydrogen in all, giving values for O ranging from 15.943 to 15.958, or, 
in sum, 15.9482. He shows that the hydrogen weighed was presumably 
pure, and that no nitrogen was occluded with it. His final figure agrees 
quite nearly with the earlier determination of Cooke and Eichards. 
(Am. Chem. Journ., x, 249.) 

Fluorine. — The atomic weight of this element, which has hitherto been 
determined by the conversion of fluorides into sulphates, Christenson 
has verified by a new method. When the double fluoride of ammonium 
and manganese, Am>MnF-,, is added to a mixture of potassium iodide 
and hydrochloric acid, it liberates iodine, which may be titrated with 
sodium thiosulphate. One molecule of the salt, as Above formulated, 
sets free one atom of iodine. Four determinations were made, giving 



CnEMISTRY. 427 

irMno:ui,ifTl = l, N = 14.()l, 1=12(1.54, and Mii=55.0 ; F=:1S.94. (Jouru. 
Prakt. Cbeiu. (2), XXXY, 551.) 

Zinc. — Morse and Burton ndetfrminc tbe atomic weight of zinc by 
the oxidation of the metal. J 'are distilled zinc was treated with nitric 
acid, and the residue from the evaporated solution after gentle heating 
was strongly ignited in a muffle. Fifteen sxperiments gave figures rang- 
ing from Zn=65.001 to Zn=65.119, or in mean, Zn=65.10(jwhen = 15.96. 
The same method with slight differences of detail had i)reviously been 
used by Krdmann, and was recently (criticised by IMarignac, who 
claimed that oxide of zinc was dissociated at high temperatures, and 
also that it retained oxides of nitrogen. Morse and Burton show these 
objections to be groundless. (Am. Cliem. Journ., x, 311.) 

Reynolds and Ramsay estimate, with many elaborate precautions, 
the amount of hydrogen evolved upon the solution of pure zinc in an 
acid. Twenty-nine experiments were made, of which twenty-four were 
rejected. The remaining five when fully corrected give concordant 
values, making the atomic weight of zinc in mean, Zn =05.4787, i. 06135, 
The weight of the hydrogen measured was computed by means of Reg- 
nault'sdata. (Journ. Chem. Soc, December, 1887.) 

Zinc, iron, and aluminum. — The equivalents of these metals as roughly 
redetermined by students in his laboratory have been published by J. 
Torrey, jr. In each case the metal was dissolved in an acid, and the 
hydrogen set free was measured. The mean results are as follows, 
when H=l. 

Fifteen experimeuts Zii=:64.95"2. 

Fourteen experimeuts Fe^.^).5.777. 

- Thirteen experiments A1^27.049. 

The values obtained in the individual determinations are not sharply 
concordant, and the work is chiefly interesting from the stand-point of 
the teacher. It illustrates the possibility of training students in the 
verification of important constants. (Am. Chem. Journ., x, 73.) 

Copper. — Richards has piiblished two papers on the atomic weight of 
this element. AYheu metallic copper is placed in a solution of silver 
nitrate, metallic silver is precipitated, and when the solution is ice cold 
the reaction is sharply quantitative. In the first paper six experiments 
are given, in which the silver was dried at 150° C. From them, if 
Ag=107.675, we can deduce the value Cu=63.437. In the second paper 
Richards states that the silver of his earlier series of weighing still re- 
tained traces of moisture. Five additional determinations were there- 
fore made, in which the silver before weighing was heated to incipient 
redness. These gave in mean, Cu =63.450; i .0006. (Proc. Amer. 
Acad., XXII, 346, aud xxiii, 177.) 

Silicon. — Thorpe and Young re-determine the atomic weight of silicon 
by means of the bromide. That compound was decomposed by water, 
and after evaporation to dryness the residual silica was weighed. 
Nine experiments were made, giving from Si = 28.243 to Si = 28.429 ; in 



428 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

meau, Si =28.332. Meyer and Seubert's values lor O aud Br. were used 
in calculating. (Journ. Cliem. Soc, June, 1887.) 

Thorium. — From eigbt analyses of the sulpbate, Krliss and Nilson 
find in mean Tb = 231.869, when = 15.90 and 8 = 31.98. (Berichte, 
XX, 1065.) 

Osmium. — The atomic weigbt of osmium bas bad peculiar interest 
from the fact tbat the value ordinarily assigned to it was out of har- 
mony with the periodic law. The constant has been re-determined by 
Seubert, who analyzed after usual methods the osmicblorides of am- 
monium and potassium. His results may be computed in the form of 
eight ratios, which give values for Os varying from 1 89.72 to 192.00. The 
mean of all is Os = 191.12; which Seubert regards as still slightly too 
high. Meyer and Seubert's figures for Ag, K, N, and CI were used in 
the calculations, with H = 1. (Berichte, xxi, 1839.) 

Platinum. — Dittmar and McArthur, from experiments of a complex 
kind upon the chloroplatinates of potassium, ammonium, and rubid- 
ium, conclude that Seubert's determination, Pt = 194.8, is too low, 
and tbat 195.5 is more nearly the correct value. (Trans. Roy. Soc. 
Edinburgh, xxxiii, 501.) 

Seubert replies to the foregoing paper, and maintains his own figures. 
He also calls attention to the fact that his results had been fully con- 
firmed by Halberstadt. (Berichte, xxi, 2519.) 

Ruthenium. — Eedetermined by Joly, who gives Eu = 101.5, without 
particulars. (Compt. Rend., cvii, 997.) 

Gold. — Kriiss determines the atomic weight of gold by means of five 
ratios, representing the neutral chloride, An CI3, and the salt K An Br4. 
The chloride was reduced by sulphurous acid, the gold was weighed as 
metal, aud the chloride as silver chloride. Eight such experiments gave 
in mean An = 190.022. The double bromide gave the following ratios : 

K An Br4 : An, nine experiuieuts An ^190.741. 

4AgBr: Au, five experiments An = 196.743. 

Bi's: Au, fonr experiments Au=::iy().619. 

K Br: Au, four experiments Au = 196.697. 

The final value, representing thirty experiments, was Au = 190.097, 
H being taken as unity, with Stas' values for Ag, CI, K, aud Br. 
(Barichte, xx, 205.) 

The same constant was also measured by Thorpe and Laurie, who 
likewise made use of the double salt K Au Br^. Three ratios were 
taken : First, the salt was decomposed by heat, and the residual Au, and 
K Br, were both weighed. Secondly, the K Br from the former series 
was titrated with silver solution, giving the ratio Au : Ag. Thirdly, 
the Ag Br found in the last reaction was also weighed, giving the ratio 
Au : Ag Br. Taking H = 1 and Stas' figures for Ag, K, and Br, we have : 

From Au : K Br, eight experiments Au = 19().87(5. 

From Au : Ag, nine experiments An = 196.837. 

From An : Ag Br, eight experiments An = 196.852. 

Mean of all An =^ 196.852. 

(Journ, Chem. Soc, June, 1887.) 



CHEMISTRY. 429 

Over these two sets of determinations, which differ in mean by nearly 
0.2, some controversy has arisen. For details, see Thorpe and Laurie 
(Berichte, xx, 3036, and Jouru. Chem. Soc, December, 1887), and Kriiss, 
(Berichte, xx, 23(35, and xxi, 128). Meanwhile Mallet has i)ublished a 
preliminary note, without particulars, concerning a determination which 
he has made. He gets a direct ratio between gold and hydrogen, giv- 
ing for gold a value somewhat higher than that obtained by Thorpe and

The deferminafion of molecular iceights. — Early in 1888 Victor Meyer 
called attention to Raoult's method for ascertaining molecular weights, 
pronouncing it to be the most important advance in that field of work 
since the announcement of Dulong and Petit's law. The method, in 
princii)le, is as follows: When any substance is dissolved, the freezing 
l^oint of the solvent is lowered ; and that depression of freezing point is 
directly related to the molecular weight of the body in solution. If we 
divide the observed depression of freezing point for each substance ex- 
amined by the weight of the substance dissolved in 100 grammes of 
water, we get a coefificient of depression which gives, when multiplied 
by the molecular weight, a constant quantity. The latter constant is 
independent of concentration, and has approximately uniform value for 
all similarly constituted bodies in any given solvent. It is called the 
moJecular depression ; ?i\\(\. (W&QVB for different solvents; but in glacial 
acetic acid it seems to have one value for all substances. Water, acetic 
acid, and benzene seem to be the only solvents of general applicability. 
If now it is desired to know the molecular weight of a soluble body to 
which vapor-density methods are inapplicable, we have only to deter- 
mine its coefficient of depression and compute from that the sought for 
value. The method, as a physical process, is not sharply accurate; but 
it is close enough to decide between the lowest empirical formula assign- 
able to a substance and the various multiples thereof. Although the 
original investigation was published by Raoult in 1883, it attracted 
little attention until Meyer's paper appeared; but since then it has 
been widely noted, and the method extensively applied. (See Meyer, 
Berichte, xxi, 536, and Auwers, ihid.^ xxi, 701.) Auwers also describes 
a convenient form of apparatus, and so too does Beckmann. (Zeit. 
Phys. Chem., ii, 638.) 

In illustration of the use of Raoult's method, the following researches 
out of many may be cited : 

Ramsay, working with an acetic acid solution, finds the molecular 
weight of liquid nitric jieroxide to be 92, at a temperature of about 
160. Hence its formula isN204, and it seems, furthermore, to undergo 
uo dissociation upon dilution. (Journ. Chem. Soc, Liii, 621.) 

Brown and Morris, using aqueous solutions, get depression values for 
dextrose, cane sugar, maltose, lactose, and arabinose corresponding to 
their accepted molecular weights. For ratlin ose the simplest empiri- 
cal formula, CisHszOie . 5H2O, corresponds to the results obtained by 
Raoult's method. (Journ. Chem. Soc, Liii, 610.) 



430 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Paterno and Nasini with aqueous solutious flud that citraconic, mes- 
aconic, and itacouic acids have the same coefficieuts of depression, and 
are therefore strictly isomeric. A like statement holds of malic and 
fumaric acids. (Berichte, xxi, 2156.) 

Louise and Roux, in order to determine the constitution of aluminum 
compounds, investigated aluminum ethyl, propyl, and isoamyl by 
Raoult's method, with ethylene bromide as the solvent. The results 
agree with the formulte AI2X6, in which X stands for the alcohoiradicle. 
Compare the diverse results obtainedby other chemists with the vapor- 
density method. (Compt. Rend., cvii,j£00.) 

The depression proluced in the freezing point of benzene by various 
phenolic substances was studied by Paterno. Phenol bebaves abnor- 
mally, but ethylphenol, acetylphenol, two nitrophenols, tribromphenol, 
picric acid, paracresol, methyl salicylate, thymol, nitro thymol, nitro- 
sotbymol, naphthol, and benzylphenol all gave normal results, both iu 
benzene and in acetic acid. (Berichte, xxi, 3178.) 

Density of gases and vapors. — In discussing the atomic weight of oxy- 
gen attention was called to Lord Rayleigh's observation that the volume 
of a glass globe when full differs from the volume of the same globe 
when empty. This observation affects all of Regnault's determinations 
of the weight of gases, and the results of the latter have been cor- 
rected by Crafts, who had access to Regnault's original apparatus, ex- 
cepting the glass globe actually used, which bad been destroyed. An- 
other globe of the same lot, however, was available, and presumably 
identical for all practical purposes with it. The following are the spe- 
cific gravities as given by Reguault and as corrected by Crafts, air being 
taken as unity.

The actual correction was 3 milligrammes added to the weight of 
each gas as given by Reguault at 760 millimeters pressure. (Compt. 
Rend., cvi, 1662.) 

J. Mensching and Victor Meyer find that at high temperatures the 
vapors of phosphorus and arsenic are not iu agreement with the sup- 
posed molecules P4 and AS4, but that at a white heat they approximate 
to P3 and As2. For antimony the molecule Sbi does not exist, the 
probable molecule being either 81)2 or Sbi. (Berichte, xx, 1833.) 

Biltz, redetermining the vapor density of sulphur, under various con- 
ditions, obtains values ranging from 7.937 down to 4.734. He concludes, 
hence, that the commonly accepted view that free sulphur in vapor is 
Sg is not correct, and that the true formula is S^. (Berichte, xxi, 2013.) 

With reference to the chlorides of inui, (chromium, indium, gallium, 
and aluminum, various determinations liave been made, with varying 
results. First, us to aluminum, whose chloride has hitherto been writ-

ten, on the strength of Deville and Troost's researches, AU Cle, which 
corresponds to a density of 9.20. According to Nilson and Petterson 
the density at 440° is 7.789, at 758° it is 4.802, and above that temper- 
ature, from 1117° to 1200°, it is fairly constant at from 4.247 to 4.277. 
The value 4.600 corresponds to the molecule ARM,, which is required 
by the trivalency of aluminum, as indicated by the periodic law. 
(Zeitsch. Physikal. Chem., i, 459.) 

On the other hand, Friedel and Crafts, at temperatures ranging from 
218° to 433°, find a vapor density of 9.24, agreeing with Deville and 
Troost's determination. They get no evidence of dissociation into any 
simpler molecules. (Compt. Rend., cvi, 1764.) 

Conformable with these data Louise aud Roux, working with alu- 
minum methyl and aluminum ethyl, get values corresponding to the 
general molecules AI3 Re. For the same compounds Buckton aud Od- 
ling long ago found densities according with Al Rn. Both compounds, 
according to Louise and Rous, decompose at high temperatures, yield- 
ing aluminum, hydrogen, and hydrocarbons. (Compare also the data 
obtained by the same authors by Raoult's method, as cited in the pre- 
ceding article. (Compt. Rend., cvi, 73 and 602.) 

Altogether the evidence seems to prove the existence of AljRe mole- 
cules, which split u]> at high temperatures into two of Al R,. 

Ferric chloride, if FcaCl,;, requires a vapor density of 11.2. If FeCls, 
its value should be 5.6. Griinewald and V. Meyer obtain the following 
values: At 448°, 10.487 ; at 518^, 9.569 ; at 606°, 8.383; at about 750°, 
5 389 to 5.528, with evidence of dissociation; at about 1050°, 4.915 to 
5.307, and similar figures at higher temperatures. At 448° it vaporizes 
completely undecomposed, and even then its vapor density is too low for 
Fe^Cle. That compound, therefore, they believe does not exist ; and 
regard the lower symbol, FeCls, to be the true one. At the higher tem- 
peratures it splits uj) to some extent into FeCL and free chlorine. (Be- 
richte, xxi, 687.) 

To this investigation, as to Nilson and Petterson's on aluminum chlo- 
ride, Friedel and Crafts reply. They determine the vapor density of 
ferric chloride in presence of free chlorine, in order to prevent any de- 
composition, aud find a figure agreeing with FCiClc. Tbeir data are 
for temperatures from 321° to 342°. (Compt. Rend., cvii, 302. Com- 
pare Biltz, Berichte, xxi, 2766.) 

Ferrous chloride, redetermined by Nilson and Petterson, at tem- 
peratures varying from 1300° to 1500^, has a density of 4.292 to 3.340. 
Theory for FeCl2, 4.375. Earlier work by V. Meyer seems to indicate a 
more complex molecule at lower i^emperatures. (Journ. Chem. Soc, 
Liii, 827.) 

Nilson and Petterson also have determined the vapor density of 
chromic and chromous chlorides. For the former, at 1200'^ to 1300o, it 
agrees closely with the molecule CrCl,. At 1065'^ a higher vahu^ was 
found, but not at all approxini(\tiilg to CriClfi. The latter probably cau

not exist iu the gaseous state. For chrouious chloride the data give a 
deusitj considerably too high for CrClg; but the compound vaporizes 
with difficulty, and the density diminishes with rise of temperature. 
CrOi is probably the true formula. (Journ. Chem. Soc, liii, 828.) 

Gallium. — According to Nilson and Petterson the trichloride of this 
metal has a vapor density which at 350° is 8.846, at 606o is 6.144, and 
at 1,000-1,100° is 5.185. GagCle requires 12.16. GaCl3 requires 6.08. 
The latter value is probably correct. They also describe a dichloride 
whose vapor density agrees with the symbol GaCl^. (Journ. Chem. 
Soc, LIII, 822.) 

In this case also Nilson and Petterson are partly controverted by 
Friedei and Crafts, who find the trichloride of gallium, as measured at 
273°, to be GajClg. Above this temperature it begins to dissociate, per- 
haps into 2 GaCl;,. (Compt. Eend., cvii, 306.) 

For indium, Nilson and Petterson re-examined the trichloride, and 
also describe two new compounds, a mono- and dichloride, respectively. 
The vapor densities of the three compounds indicate molecules of InCls, 
InCU, and InCl. (Journ. Chem. Soc, Liii, 816.) The density of the 
trichloride is also given by Biltz, who liuds it concordant with InCls. 
(Berichte, XXI, 2766.) All of the foregoing data relative to the iron- 
aluminum group are well summarized by Sydney Young, who gives 
them ill tabular form in Nature for December 27, 1888. His note is 
discussed by Brauner in the same journal for January 31,1889. 

The vapor density of tellurium tetrachloride has been studied by 
Michaelis. It boils at 380°, and up to 448° it distills undecomposed. 
Even at 530 it is scarcely dissociated at all, and its density indicates a 
molecule of TeCl4. Hence tellurium is at least quadrivalent. (Berichte, 
XX, 1780.) 

Refrifjeraiing mixtures. — The freezing mixtures containing soliditied 
carbon dioxide have been carefully studied by Cailletet and Colardeau, 
who give the following determinations of temperature : 

° c. 

Solid carbon dioxide — 60 

Solid carbon dioxide iu vacuo — 76 

Solid carbou dioxide iu ether — 77 

Same mixture iu vacuo - 103 

The following all represent ordinary pressures : 

o 

Solid carbou dioxide iu methyl chloride . —82 

Solid carbou dioxide iu sulphur dioxide —82 

S(did carbou dioxide in amyl acetate —78 

Solid carbou dioxide in phosphorus trichloride —76 

Solid carbon dioxide in absolute alcohol —72 

Solid carbou dioxide in ethylene chloride — 60 

In the three comi)ounds last named the carbon dioxide was manifestly 
less soluble than in the others. Hence a smaller reduction of tempera- 
ture as compared with that ot the original solid. (Compt. liend., cviii, 
1631.) 



CHEMISTRY. 433 

Hydrates of gases. — Yillard fiuds that when certain gases mixed witli 
aqueous vapcn- are condensed in Cailletet's apparatus, crystalline hy- 
drates are produced, which decompose spontaneously at the following 
teujperatures: Of CH4, at 2l.o5; of CzHg, at 120; of C2H4 at 18. o5; 
of C2H2, at 14°; of N2O, at 12°. Nitrogen, hydrogen, carbonic oxide, 
nitric oxide, cyanogen, ammonia, propylene, butylene, and allylene gave 
no crystals un<ler similar conditions. (Compt. Rend., cvi, 1602.) 

The formation of alloys. — The claim made by Spring that Wood's alloy 
could be formed from its component metals hj means of pressure has 
led Hallock to investigate the subject from another point of view. One 
part cadmium, one part tin, two parts lead, and four parts bismuth, in 
fine filings, were mixed in a glass tube of about five millimeters interior 
diameter, closed at one end. The mixture was packed in the tube by 
gentle pressure with an iron wire, and the whole was then suspended 
in a water bath and exposed to a temperature of 98° to 100°. Within 
two days the entire mass was tluid, the alloy having formed at a tem- 
perature 130° below the melting point of its most fusible constituent. 

The well-known alloy of sodium and potassium, which is liquid above 
6° C, can be produced with great ease at ordinary atmospheric tem- 
peratures. When freshly cut surfaces of the two metals are gently pressed 
together, liquefaction begins at the points of contact, almost instantly, 
and spreads rapidly to completion. In short, it seems probable that all 
alloys may be made from their components at temperatures little, if 
any, in excess of their own melting Doints. (Zeitschr. Physikal. Chem., 
II, 379.) 

The same alloy of sodium and potassium has also been investigated 
thermochemically by Joaunis, who i^repared it by the usual method of 
melting the two metals together under petroleum. The calorimetric 
data given by the action of water upon this alloy, led Joannis to con- 
clude that the only true compound among the sodium-potassium alloys 
is represented by the formula NaK2. ^Ann. de Chim. Phys. (6), xii, 
358.) 

The dehydration of metallic hydroxides by heat. — By experiments on 
the temperature and rate of dehydration of hydrates corresponding to 
sixteen metals, Caruelley and Walker conclude that Henry's views con- 
cerning the polymerization of metallic oxides are mainly true. They 
find that when a precipitated hydrate is heated, it gradually loses water 
with the successive formation of a large number of definite hydrates, 
each of which is further decomposed on a small rise in temperature, with 
the formatiou of a compound containing a smaller proportion of water. 
As the elimination of water proceeds, the residual molecule becomes 
larger and more complex, until at last a highly complex molecule of 
anhydrous oxide is left, of which the formula is some multiple of that 
generally received. For the oxides of silicon, titanium, and tin the coef- 
ficient of polymerization must be at least ten, while oxide of zirconium 
must be at least Zr^^O^g, and autimonious oxide at least Sb2o03o. The

most infusible oxides are probably tbosein wbich the bi<jjhest polymeri- 
zation is reacbed. 

The aiitbors also connect tbe pbenomena of debydration witb tbe 
periodic curve, and reacb tbe following conclusions : 

(A.) As regards oxides belonging to the same group. In tbe case of 
odd members tbe temperature of complete debydration diininisbes as Ibe 
atomic weight of tbe positive element increases. For even aieuibers tbe 
reverse is true. 

(B.) As regards oxides belonging to the same period, as from Li to 
F, or from K to Br. Here tbe temperature of com])lete debydiatiou 
seems to diminish from tbe beginning to about tbe middle of the period, 
and then to increase as we approach its end. To this rule there are 
only three apparent exceptions, and to tbe former rules there are none. 
(Journ. Chem. Soc, lux, 59.) 

The interaction of zinc and .sulphuric acid. — Tlje ordinary reaction be- 
tween commercial zinc and dilute sul[)liuric acid is I'amiliar to everyone, 
and it is also well known that the hydrogen evolved is sometimes con- 
taminated witb sulphur dioxide and sulphuretted hydrogen. Taken al- 
together the re-actions are somewhat complicated, varying witb different 
qualities of zinc and different concentrations of acid. An interesting 
qualitative study of the problem has been made by Muir and Adie, who 
used six different forms of zinc, ranging from tbe comniercial granu- 
lated metal, through re-distilled zinc, to platinized zinc foil and zinc 
especially purified. The acid varied from H2SO4 to H3SO4, IOOH2O aj)- 
proximately. 

In all the re-actions hydrogen was evolved, and zinc sulphate witb some- 
times free suli)hur was tbe only solid product. Sulphur was liberated 
only at relatively high temperatures, and by acids not less concentrated 
than H2SO4, 2H2O, and its separation is always accompanied by evolu- 
tion of sulphur dioxide and suli)buretted hydrogen; although tbe quan- 
tity of tbe latter was sometimes extremely small. When the specially 
purified zinc was used, hardly any sulphur was set free, but witb ])lat- 
inized foil it ai)peared in large quantities ; its formation being possibly 
due to the mutual action of sulphuretted hydrogen and hot sulphuric 
acid. 

Tbe purer the zinc the smaller become the quantities of sulphur di- 
oxide and sulphuretted hydrogen evolved at ordinary temperatures, and 
when tbe acid is so dilute as H2SO4, ISILO, hydrogen is almost tbe sole 
gaseous product. Tbe proportions of the other two gases vary witb 
purity of the zinc, concentration of acid, and temperature. Witb plat- 
inized foil and concentrated acids, sulphur dioxide is generated at 
a lower temperature than sulphuretted hydrogen, but tbe latter is pro- 
duced tbe more freely of the two when the acid is dilute. With com- 
mercial zinc and H2SO4, 2EI20, little sulphur dioxide or sulphuretted 
iiydrogen appears at 100°; at 105° both gases are i)roduced freely; at 
180° torrents of tbe latter gas nearly free from tbe former are evolved. 



CHEMISTRY. 435 

With the specially purified zinc aud the same concentration of acid both 
gases are given off in (piautity at IGj"^. The dependence of the produc- 
tion of these gases upon temperature and concentration seems to indi- 
cate that they are not altogether generated by any reducing action of 
nascent hydrogen upon sulphuric acid. The authors regard the inter- 
action in the case of pure zinc and acid as chiefly chemical, and ascribe 
the products evolved by less pure zincs to secondary electrolytic 
changes. Doubtless the actual re-actions are more complex than can 
be shown by any system of equations at present. (Journ. Chem. Soc, 
Liii, 47.) 

Ahsorption ftpectra of the rare earths. — Kriiss and IS'ilson, studying 
the rare earths from thorite, wohlerite, cerite, fergusonite, enxenite, etc., 
have discovered various anomalies in their absorption spectra which 
they ascribe to a greater elementary complexity than has commonly 
been recognized. In place of the so called erbium, holmium, thulium, 
didymium, and samarium, they assume the existence of more than twenty 
elements, each of the above-named substances giving spectra which 
vary for each substance with differences of origin. For example, in the 
earths from thorite, all the lines ascribable to holmium were seen, but 
all faintly except one. That one, which was strong, is ordinarily oneof 
the faintest. The lines which are commonly strongest were barely vis- 
ible. Of earths from fergusonite a series of fractionations was made, 
and in these similarly curious anomalies were noted. In certain por- 
tions some lines belonging to a given element would appear, and others 
would be wanting, and thus the supposed element was shown to be pre 
sumably a mixture. For details, with wave lengths of the lines, the 
original paper must be consulted. (Berichte, xx, 2134.) 

To the foregoing conclusions of Kriiss and Nilson, Bailey objects. 
As regards the relative intensity of absorption lines, he holds that the 
several spectra in a mixture of earths modify each other, the propor- 
tioned quantity of each earth affecting the problem decidedly. A stroug 
absorption band may hide a weaker one, aud furthermore, differences 
of dilution with respect to any given oxide will influence its spectrum. 
Variations may also be due to the presence of reagents ; as for instance, 
as nitrate solutions were studied, an excess of nitric acid. (Berichte, 
XX, 27G9.) 

To Bailey's objections, Kriiss and Nilso!i publish a rejoinder, in which, 
with other evidence, they state that their solutions contained only neu- 
tral nitrates of the earths. (Berichte, xx, 3067.) Later, Bailey rei)lies, 
leaving the question still in doubt. (Berichte, xx, 3325.) The discus- 
sion is continued in Berichte, xxi, pp. 585, 1521, and 2019, and fur- 
thur spectral investigations by Kiesewetter and Kriiss ai)pear in the 
same volume, j). 2310. In the latter paper the earths from keilhauite 
and gadolinite are studied with results analogous to those given in the 
first of the above-cited publications. 

Elements and meta- elements, — In his address as president of the Ciiemi- 



436 RECORD OP" SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

cal Society, in March, 1888, Crookes discusses at some length tlie nature 
of the chemical elements, and considers the nature of the many doubt- 
ful bodies contained in the so-called rare earths. Recognizing the 
differences between the modifications of supposed elements developed 
by fractional precipitation many times repeated, he does not regard 
them as equal in rank to the broader differences which distinguish well- 
characterized elementary bodies, and proposes the term " meta-ele- 
ments-'' as one well adapted to indicate their peculiar nature. In gen- 
eral, he proposes to substitute for the word " element," as commonly 
used, the exi)ression "elementary group," the meta-elements being the 
closely similar components. In the original evolution of the elements 
from "protyle" he conceives that there was a massing tendency of the 
primeval iitoras about certain nodal points in space. A cluster of par- 
ticles, so formed, is a mass of that element whose atomic weight it rep- 
resents, while the outlying particles of the cluster, varying in weight 
form the average, and varying almost imperceptibly in properties, are 
meta elements. He further discusses the main problem in the light of 
the periodic law, and replaces the ordinary tabular expression by a 
lemniscate spiral, along which the atomic weights of the elements are 
distributed. 

INORGANIC. 

The ivaters of the Yelloivstone ParTi. — In Bulletin No. 47 of the U. S. 
Geological Survey there is an elaborate investigation by Gooch and 
Whitfield upon the waters of the Yellowstone Park. Forty-three of 
these waters, mostly representing geysers and hot springs, were thor- 
oughly analyzed, and found to be of remarkable interest. All of the 
geyser waters are highly siliceous; all contain notable quantities of 
borates ; all cany weighable amounts of arsenic and of lithia. In no 
case was iodine detected, and bromine was found but rarely in very 
small amounts. The main constituents, apart from the substances al- 
ready named, were the usual sulphates, carbonates, and chlorides of 
lime, magnesia, and the alkalies. None of the waters are markedly 
chalybeate. As regards concentration, all are comparatively weak, 
most of them carrying under 2 grammes of solid contents to the liter, 
and not one reaching 4 grammes. 

One of the springs, the Devil's Ink Pot, is probably unique among 
mineral waters. It contains 3.3871 grammes of dissolved matter in the 
kilogramme of water, and of this 2.SI85 grammes are ammonium sul- 
phate. It also contains free sulphuric, boric, and hydrochloric acid, 
some alum, a little sulphuretted hydrogen, and several metallic sul- 
phates. No suggestion is offered concerning the origin of this water. 
The bulletin contains full details as to the methods of analysis em- 
ployed, and will be found valuable by other analysts on the score of 
suggestiveness. 

The chlorides of iodine. — According to Stortenbeker the only solid 



CHEMISTRY. 437 

cblormes of iodiue are the trichloride, and tw^o modifications, a and 
/i of the uionochloride. The oe compound crystallizes in long, red nee- 
dles, melting at 27". 2, while the (i modification forms brownish red 
lamella?, which fuse at 13'^.9. All these bodies can exist below their 
points of fusion in liquid mixtures containing an excess of either ele- 
ment, and varying in composition with temperature. In the gaseous 
state only the molecule ICl. is possible, and it dissociates slightly at 
80°; the trichloride dissociates completely in passing from solid to gas. 
(Rec. Trav. Chim., Vii, 152.) 

The valency of boron. — Lorenz, from a study of the oxychlorides, con- 
cludes that boron is trivaleut. Neither of the compounds BOCl nor 
BOCI3 could be prepared; but a substance B8O11CI2, analogous in all 
respects to several well-known salts of trivalent antimony, was obtained. 
(Am. Chem., CCXLVii, 226.) 

The same subject is also discussed by Georgievicz from other points 
of view ; but with the same final conclusions. He points out as evidence 
of the trivalencyof boron the isomorphism of euclase and datolite, and 
also describes a reaction by which when iodine is boiled with a solution 
of borax, sodium iodate is formed. (Journ. Prakt. Chem. (2), xxxviii, 
118.) 

The preparation of boron. — The following method is proposed by S. 
G. Eawson : A mixture of 3^ parts of boron trioxide and 11 parts of 
calcium fluoride is treated iu a flask with strong sulphuric acid. On 
gently warming, a steady stream of boron fluoride is evolved, which is 
then passed through a glass tube on which several bulbs have been 
blown. In each bulb a small piece of potassium is placed, and these 
are heated successively. Decomposition ensues with formation of po- 
tassium fluoride and liberation of boron. Finally, the mass is thrown 
on a filter and washed with water, boron remaining behind. Amor- 
phous silicon may be easily prepared in a similar way. (Chem. News, 
LViii, 283.) 

According to Hampe amorphous boron may also be prepared by the 
electrolysis of fused borax between electrodes of platinum and gas 
carbon. The free boron accumulates about the negative pole, and may 
be separated from slag by means of water and hydrochloric acid. 
(Berichte, xxi, ref. 827.) 

The manufacture of aluminum. — Under the patents of Mr. H. G. Cast- 
ner, of New York, the manufacture of aluminum has been begun at 
Uldbury, near Birmingham, England. The process revolves itself into 
four stages. First, sodium is produced from caustic soda by reduction 
by means of iron carbide in steel retorts at a temperature of 800°. 
From 6 pounds of caustic soda and 5 pounds of carbide 1 pound of 
sodium is obtained at a cost of about 18 cents. A residual product is 
crude carbonate of soda of commercial value. Second, chlorine is pre- 
pared by the Weldon process, the necessary hydrochloric acid being 
supplied by the makers in return for the crude carbonate of soda above 



438 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

mentioued. Third, by passing the chlorine over a heated mixture of 
alumina, salt, and carbon, a double cliloride of alnminnm and sodium is 
produced. Fourth, the aluminum is extracted by heating, in appropri- 
ate furnaces, 80 pounds of the aforesaid double chloride, 25 pounds of 
sodium, and 30 pounds of cryolite, the latter serving as a flux. The 
charge is maintained for two hours at a temperature of 1,000°, and 
yields about 8 pounds of aluminum containing not over 2 per cent, of 
impurities. The present cost of the metal is from $10 to $12 a pound, 
and under this process it is estimated that the price can be reduced to 
about $1.25. (Chem. Kews, lviii, 04.) 

Some jnoducts of the Gowles electric furnace. — The following observa- 
tions are due to Prof. C. F. Mabery. 

First, as to the reduction of aluminum from corundum : When that 
mineral, mixed with charcoal, is submitted to the action of an electric 
current in the furnace it fuses and reduction proceeds rapidly. The 
liberated metal, vaporized, partly condenses in tlie upper layer of char- 
coal, while part escapes into the air and is burned. The mixture of 
carbon and metal contains from 10 to 50 per cent, of the latter. If sili- 
con is present in the ore it is also reduced and the silicon alloys with the 
aluminum in variable proportions up to 10 per cent, of the former. With 
clay a similar reduction takes place, and when the alloy obtained is 
treated with hydrochloric acid, (;rystalline or gra])hitoidal silicon is left 
behind. The slags which are produced usually contain some metallic 
aluminum, rarely iron, and almost no silicon. When corundum is re- 
duced in presence of iron, the latter retains aluminum to a greater or 
less extent. One product, which seems available for foundry purposes 
and for introducing aluminum into steel, contains from 6 to 10 percent, 
of aluminum. It resembles in api)earauce a hard, finegrained white 
iron. 

Secondly, as to the reduction of silicon. Sand is more easily reduced 
in the furnace than corundum. It first fuses, and reduction immedi- 
ately follows, yielding crystallized silicon. Copper mixed with the 
charge dissolves the silicon up to 14 per cent., giving a bronze of re- 
markable strength. The product obtained when silicon is reduced in 
the absence of metals contains more or less of an amorphous greenish 
substance of vitreous luster, which always occurs between the unre- 
duced sand and the free silicon. In composition it appears to be the 
hitherto unknown silicon monoxide, SiO. Its specific gravity is 2.893, 
or somewhat higher than quartz. (Am. Chem. Journ., ix, 11.) 

Alum in haking-powders. — In a series of experiments upon baking- 
powders used in the United States, Professor Mallet has reached the 
following conclusions: The greater part of the aluminous powders con- 
tain alum, acid calcium phosphate, sodium bicarbonate, and starch. 
They give off very different proportions of carbon dioxide, and there- 
fore require to be used in different amounts. Generally there is an ex- 
cess of the alkaline ingredient in these powders, but sometimes the re- 



CHEMISTRY. 439 

verse is true. On moisteuing tlie i)()\v(lers they yield small junoiuits of 
calcium and aluinimiin iu soluble Ibrm. After bread-making the i)OW- 
ders coutaiuiug acid calcium phosphate leave most of their aluminum 
behind as i)hosphate, but when alum alone has been used the phosphate 
is replaced by hydroxide. In bakiny;, the inferior of the loaf does not 
exceed a temperature of lOO"^ C, at which temi>erature neither the 
aluminum phosphate uor the hydroxide is completely dehydrated. Both 
of these compounds in doses not much exceeding the quantities found iu 
bread produce an inhibitory effect upon indigestion, this point having 
been determined by personal experiments. That effect is probably due 
to the fact that a part of the alumina unites with the acid of the gas- 
tric juice and is taken into solution, while the remainder of the hydrox- 
ide or phosphate precipitates the peptic ferment in insoluble form. 
Partial precipitation of some of the organic matter of food may also be 
brought about by the aluminum compounds in question. From all the 
evidence JVIallet concludes that not only alum itself, but also the resi- 
dues which it leaves iu bread, are unwholesome. (Uhem. ]S"ews, lviii, 
276, 284.) 

Aluminum iti plants.— It is commonly believed and asserted that flow- 
ering plants do not contain aluminum as a normal constituent, although 
one or two exceptions have been admitted. But Yoshida, on examin- 
ing carefully selected and washed seeds of the pea, bean, rice, wheat, 
barley, millet, and buckwheat, finds alumina present in the ash in every 
case. The quantities found range from 0.053 per cent, in the ash of the 
l)ea, Soja hisjuda, up to 0.272 ]>er cent, in the ash of millet, Panicum 
italioum. In the pea the cotyledons contain no alumina, while the ash 
of the hull or skin contains 0.2G8 per cent. The figure given above re- 
lates to the whole pea. (Journ. Chem. Soc, Li, 748.) 

Silicon in iron and steel. — Thomas Turner, after a long and laborious 
investigation, announces the following conclusions as to the intluence 
of silicon upon the i)roperties of iron and steel : 

Ingot iron containing sili(;on in all ])roportions up to 0,5 per cent, 
rolls well and does not show any signs of red-shortness ; it welds per- 
fectly with all proportions of silicon, and, with the somewhat doubtful 
exception of the 0.5 per cent, specimen, it is not brittle when cold. 
With less than about 0.15 per cent, of silicon, the limit of elasticity, the 
breaking load, the extension, and the reduction of area are but little, if 
at all, affected by the proportion of silicon present. With over 0.15 per 
cent, the limit of elasticity and breaking load are increased, though the 
effect of silicon in this respect is not nearly so marked as that of car- 
bon. But the ductility is distinctly reduced and rendered more irregu- 
lar by the presence of much silicon. The fracture is also rendered more 
granular or crystalline, and is less regular in character. (Journ. Chem. 
Soc, Liii, 824; continued from lt, 129.) 

The chemical structure of the natural silicates.— Under this heading 
Clarke has suramarized his views upon silicate structure, which vary 



440 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

somewhat from those which have been hitherto geuerally Ijekl. After 
arguing- iu favor of simplicity of structure, he discusses a number of the 
common ahimiuous silicates, and shows that the more complex of them 
are easily represented as substitution derivatives of normal salts, alu- 
minum itself being regarded as trivalent. Thus, from the normal ortho- 
silicate of aluminum, xenolite, the species fibrolite, topaz, muscovite, 
paragonite, eucryptite, dumortierite, grossularite, prehnite. and natro- 
lite are simply derived, and in a way which accords well with their 
actual occurrences and alterations in nature. The paper concludes 
with the general hypothesis that all double salts are substitution deriv- 
atives of normal compounds. (Am. Chem, Journ., x, 120.) 

In a later number of the same journal (x, 405) E. A. Schneider shows 
that the differences in the behavior of silicates toward hydrochloric acid 
are in the same order as the ditierences pointed out in Clarke's formula. 

The constitution of the clays. — By a careful study of the tiiermal phe- 
nomena attending the dehydration of many clays, Le Chatelier arrives 
at the conclusion that they represent only five compounds, as follows: 

Ilalloysite 2 SiO.i-Al.Oa . 2H,0 . aq. 

Kaolin 2 SiO. Al.O, . 2H.2O 

Allopbane SiOj AljOi . aq. 

Pyrophyllite 4 SiO, AljO:, . H.jO 

Moutmorillouite 4 SiO^ AUOa . HoO . aq. 

Of these the last one is doubtful, (Zeitschr. Phys. Chem., i, 396.) 

Hydroxychlorides of titanium. — According to Koenig and Otto von der 
Pfordten, dry, gaseous hydrochloric acid does not act upon titanium 
tetrachloride. On the other hand, concentrated aqueous hydrochloric 
acid acts upon the chloride, forming a series of hydroxy-deiivatives, 
which may be represented as follows: TiCU; TiCl,OH 5 TiCl2((JHj2; 
TiCl(OH):t. These compounds are called by the authors chlorides of 
titanic acid, and all are solids. The monochloride is stable in the air ; 
the dichloride is very hygroscopic; the trichloride somewhat so. (Be- 
richte, xxr, 1708.) 

Titanic acid in soils. — J. F. McCaleb has examined fourteen samples 
of soil from central Virginia, together with one from Alabama and one 
from Nevada, finding titanic oxide present in all in percentages ranging 
from 0.33 to 5.42. Although this wide distribution of titanium was rea- 
sonably to be expected, it seems not to have been hitherto observed. 
(Am. Chen). Journ., x, 30.) 

Germanium. — Several papers upon this interesting new metal have 
appeared, which identify it completely with the predicted "ekasilicium" 
of Mendelejeff". For the specific heat of the metal, between 0° and 
440°, Kilson and Pettersson find 0.0757, which gives an atomic heat of 
5.33. They also find normal values for the vapor density of GeCl4, Gel4, 
and GeS. (Berichte, xx, ref. 134.) 

By Winkler several compounds of germanium are described, notably 
a germanium chloroform, GeHCl.-,; germanium ethyl, Ge(C2fl5)4j and 



CHEMISTRY. 441 

a j2:ermanium nltrainariue. The double fluorides of germanium are 
strictly analogous to those of the other elements of the same group. 
(Journ. Prakt. Chem. (2), xxxvi, 177.) The potassium gerraanjfluo- 
ride, K^GeFK, is also studied by Nilson and Pettersson, who show its 
analogies with the silicotluoride. Crystallograpliic measurements by 
Paykullshowit to be isomorphous with ammonium silicotluoride. (Be- 
richte, xx, 169G.) In euxenite Kriiss discovers about one-tenth of 1 per 
cent, of germanium oxide. (Berichte, xxi, 131.) 

Hydrazin. — The compound N2H4, hydrazin or nmidogen, of which 
many derivatives have long been known, has at last been isolated by 
Curtius. When diazoacetic ether is treated with hot, strong potash lye 
the potassium salt of a new acid is formed. When this salt is treated 
with a mineral acid the new diazo acid is set free, which upon digestion 
with dilute sulphuric acid deposits superb colorless crystals of hydrazin 
sulphate. The latter by warming with caustic alkali solutions readily 
.yields up free hydrazin as a colorless, i)erfectly stable gas having a pe- 
culiar odor slightly suggestive of ammonia. It dissolves easily in water 
to a strongly alkaline solution, which acts as a powerful reducing agent, 
precipitates alumina and other like bases from their salts, and unites 
readily with acids. (Berichte, xx, 1632.) 

The chloride of niiro(ien. — This compound, which is perhaps the most 
violent ex])losive known, has been recently investigated by Gatterman. 
As obtained by the action of chlorine upon sal ammoniac solution, it 
was found to be indefinite in composition and to contain various admix- 
tures of chloramines. From this mixture the pure NCl.i was jirepared 
by first washing thoroughly with water in a separatory funnel and then 
saturating for half an hour with a stream of chlorine. The oil so ob- 
tained was thoroughly washed, dried, and analyzed and, was found to be 
definite in composition. By careful manipulation it was prepared about 
thirty times without explosion, and its reputedly capricious explosibility 
was found to be due to the action of light. By flashing nj)on it the light 
from burning magnesium it exploded violently. On careful heating up 
to 900 it remains unchanged, but exploded with great force when the 
temperature reached 95°. (Berichte, xxi, 751.) 

In a note upon the foregoing i)aper Mallet calls attention to the fact 
that nitrogen iodide, which is not sensitive when wet, when dry also 
detonates by exposure to bright sunlight. (Chem. IS'ews. lyiii, 04.) 

Thiophoaphorijl fluoride. — According to Thorpe and Rodger, when 
phosphorus pentasulphide is heated with lead fluoride in a leaden tube 
a gas is formed which analysis shows to be thiophosithoryl fluoride, 
PSF3. It is also produced by several other re-actions, and is a trans- 
parent, colorless, liquefiable gas. In contact with air it spontaneously 
ignites, burning at a jet with a pale yellowish green flame tipped with 
blue. It dissolves in water, to some extent in ether, not at all in alco- 
hol or benzene. It has no action on mercury. (Jour. Chem. Soc, liii, 
766.) 



442 KECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Amor2)hous aniimimy. — This modification of aiitiiiiony, discovered by 
Gore, is prepared by Herard by beatinj;- autimoiiy to dull redness iu a 
current of nitrogen. The grayish vapors condense at the cool end of 
tlie tube in which the operation is performed, to an amorphous powder. 
Its specific gravity is G,22 and it melts at 614°, while ordinary crystal- 
line antimony fuses at 440° and has a density of C.73. (Coni[)t. Rend., 
cvn, 420.) 

Decomposition of ant im any mlpliide by water. — Elbers finds tliat when 
antimonious sulphide is boiled with water it is slowly decomposed with 
evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen. In this way 0.05 gramme of sul- 
phide was converted into oxide in fourteen hours, giving a liquid of 
faintly alkaline re-action. (Jour. Chem. Soc, lvi, 108, from (Jhem. 
Zeitung, xn, 355.) 

Hydrochi orates of chlorides. — Three of these hitherto doubtful salts, 
well crystallized, are described by Engel. They are (SbOl3)2. HCl. 2H2O ; 
SbClg. 5HC1. IIH2O; (BiGlr,)2. HCl. 3H2O. A similar copper salt, CUCI2. 
2HC1. 5H2O, also crystallized, is described by Sabatier. (Compt. Ken;'., 
cvi, 1724 and 179G.) The tluohydrates of potassium fluoride, KF.2HF 
and KF.3HF, lately discovered by Moissan, may be analogous in con- 
stitution. (Compt. Rend., cvi, 547.) 

Pentathionic and hexathionic acids. — When sulphuretted hydrogen is 
passed into an aqueous solution of sulphurous acid a milky liquid is 
formed in which an acid called i^entathionic acid is commonly believed 
to exist. Its existence, however, having been called in question by 
Spring, the question has been re-investigated by Debus with affirma- 
tive results. According- to Spring- the pentathionic acid is merely a 
l)hy8ical solution of sulphur in tetrathionic acid, and the pentathionates 
are mixtures of tetrathionates with free sulphur. 

The original liquid from which pentathionic acid is obtained is known 
as Wackenroder's solution, and is a highly complex and unstable mix- 
ture. Its i)roperties were thoroughly studied by Debus, who explains 
the anonuilies which have troubled Spring aiul others, and who dis- 
covers in it, besides tetra- and pentathionic acids, still a new compound, 
hexathionic acid, HiScO,;. He obtained well-crystallized and definite 
pentathionates of i)otassium and copper, and also the i>otassium salt of 
hexathionic acid, establishing the existence of both acids beyond all 
reasonable question. He also found in the Wackenroder solution rather 
large quantities of free sulphur in a ncM' (colloidal modification, soluble 
in water. (Journ. Chem. Soc, Lii, 278.) 

A new snlplinr acid. — Yilliors, studying the action of sulphur dioxide 
upon sodium tliiosulpiiate. finds that when the gas is passed into an ice- 
cold solution of the latter salt a new sulphur acid is generated. If the 
solution, after saturation, be allowed to stand for a few days and then 
is evaporated in vacuo over sulphuric acid, crystals of the sodium salt, 
1^828408, are obtained. It crystallizes from water with 2H2O. From 
the first mother liquor on further evaporation sodium trithionate crys- 



CHEMISTRY. 443 

tallizes out. For the new acid tbe uaine disiili)li()p('i sulphuric is i)ro- 
posed. (Compt. Kend., cvi, 851 aud 1854.) 

Tellurium. — According' to Berthelot and Fabre the transformation of 
amorphous tellurium into the crystalline variety is attended by an ab- 
sorption of heat. In this j)articular it is the opposite of selenium. 
Fabre finds that in its different modifications tellurium has sensibly 
the same specific heat. Telluride of magnesium is easily prepared by 
lieating magnesium in dry hydrogen, and passing over it an excess of 
tellurium vapor. It is a white, flaky substance, which, treated with 
acidulated water, yields telluretted hydrogen, and the latter gas is so 
unstable as to decompose immediately in contact with moist air. Its 
heat of formation is negative. A number of metallic tellurides were 
prepared and studied by Fabre thermochemically. Their heats of 
formation were all positive, but less than in the case of the correspond- 
ing selenidcs. (Ann. Chim. Phys. (0), xiv, 93, 110.) 

Solution of iron in caustic soda. — When a strong current of air is 
foiced into a hot, concentrated solution of caustic soda contained in an 
iron vessel, or in which finely divided ferric hydroxide is suspended, 
noticeable qudntities of iron are dissolved without coloration. At 
ordinary temperatures the liquid remains clear and colorless for sev- 
eral days, but ultimately becomes turbid and discolored, depositing fer- 
ric hydroxide. This color or turbidity disappears upon heating. Zir- 
nite, who describes the phenomenon, attributes it to the possible for- 
mation of a sodium i)erferrate, ]S^aFe04. (Journ. Chem. Hoc, lvi, 105 ; 
from Chem. Zeitung, xii, 355.) 

Luieocohalt liermangaiiate. — This salt, with several of its derivatives 
intermediate between it and the chloride or bromide of luteocobalt, is 
remarkable for being violently explosive, both upon heating and by 
percussion. It forms many highly crystalline double salts of consider- 
able stability. (T. Klobb, Ann. Chim. Phys. ((>), xii, 5.) 

Electrolytic precipitation of copper. — According to Soret, dilute solu- 
tions of coppei', except with verj- weak currents, yield a spongy precipi- 
tate of metal. The nature of the dei)0sit depends not only on the in- 
tensity of the electric current and on the concentration of the solution, 
but also on the proportion of free acid which may be present. The 
electrolytic copper always contains hydrogen, its amount depending 
upon the temperature of the solution and its acidity. That hydrogen 
is simply occluded, not combined; and it sometimes contains traces of 
carbonic anhydride and carbonic oxide. (Compt. Kend., cvii, 733.) 

Neir jilotinum bases. — Dr. H. Alexander describes a number of com- 
pounds, analogous to the i)latosamines, in which hydroxylamine replaces 
ammonia. The platodioxamine, of which the chloride, PtCl>.4NH30, 
corresponds to the chloride of Eeiset's base, forms a large series of selts, 
in which alkalies precipitate an insoluble hydroxide, Pt(On)2.4:NIl30. 
In this reaction the hydroxylamine base differs from all the other plati- 
num bases so far known. (Ann. Chem., CCXLVI, 239.) 



444 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

By Blomstiand a remarkable series of platinum bases coutainiug; 
organic radicles and sulphur are described. In one memoir he dis- 
cusses the sulphin bases of methyl and ethyl, and in a second paper, 
jointly with Eudelius aiul Londahl, the propyl, isopropyl, butyl, iso- 
butyl, and benzyl bases are considered. The platoethylsulphin chloride, 
Pt=(S(C2H5)2Cl)2, may be cited as a representative of these new com- 
pounds. (Journ. Prakt. Chein. (2), xxxviii, 315 and 497.) 

Infiuence ofiinpurities upon gold. — Roberts- Austen, of the British mint, 
investigating the influence of small impurities upon gold, attempts to 
correlate his observations with the periodic law. Those metals whose 
atomic volumes exceed that of gold, when alloyed with the latter ele- 
ment, diminish its tenacity. Silver, having nearly the same atomic 
volume as gold, hardly affects its toughness at all. So far as the ex- 
periments go, tbe toughness of gold is not lessened by any element 
which stands below it in Mejer's curve, while all the elements above 
gold in the curve tend to make it brittle. (Berichte, xxr, ref. 508.) 

Salts of gold — In the periodic system gold may be placed with almost 
equal propriety eitlier in line with the alkaline metals or in column 
with the iron and platinum groups. Chemically, its relations suggest 
the first-named grouping ; physically, it is nearer platinum. In a for- 
mer paper Kriiss has shown that aurous oxide, like the alkalies, is com- 
pletely soluble iu water, and now Hoffmann and Kriiss find a like state- 
ment to hold good of aurous sulphide, which, when freshly prepared, 
dissolves easily to a clear brown solution, from which it is precipitated 
by hydrochloric acid and various salts. The trisulphide, AU2S3 ai)pears 
not to exist, in spite of the common belief in its favor, but a sulphide, 
AU2S2, is easily obtainable. The so-called trisulphide of chemical liter- 
ature is a mixture of this auro auric salt Avitli free sulphur. (IJerichte, 
XX, 2309 and 2704.) 

In experiments upon the halogen compounds of gold Kriiss and 
Schmidt conclude that Thomsen's auro-auric salts, AU2CI4 and Au2Br4, 
do not exist. When chlorine or bromine acts directly upon gold the 
normal auric compound is produced. (Berichte, xx, 2634.) 

ORGANIC. 

Higher 2)araffins from broini coal. — In the oil distilled from brown coal 
Krafift has identified a number of the higher homologues of methane. 
Ee has isolated the members of the series from CnHge to C2:iH48 inclu- 
sive, and finds them to be identical with the normal i)arattins prepared 
synthetically. Seven of them are described in detail. (Berichte, xxi, 
2250.) In other papers Krafft studies aromatic compounds involving 
pentadecyl and hexadecyl groups, such as hexadecyl benzene, etc. {Ibid., 
pp. 2205,3180.) 

The origin of petroleum. — Although petroleum is generally believed to 
be of organic origin, some writers, and notably Mendelejeff, have sought 
to show its derivation from inorganic material. Evidence as to its ani- 



CHEMISTRY. 445 

raal origin is now fiirnisbed by the researches of 0. Engler, who studied 
the distilhitiou of tish oil under favorable conditions. In a large appa- 
ratus made for manufacturing purposes he distilled 492 kilogrammes of 
menhaden oil, at a temperature of 350° to 400°, and under a pressure 
of two atmospheres. Combustible gases were given off, and a liquid 
distillate was obtained in two layers ; the upper watery, the lower oily, 
in character. The latter amounted to 299 kilogrammes, was brownish, 
and had a strong green Huorescence. In brief, it resemble<l crude 
petroleum ; and on fractional distillation it yielded pentane, hexane, 
heptane, octane, and nonaue, all of the normal series, together with 
some secondary hydrocarbons. It was essentially an artificial petro- 
leum. 

As fish oil is mainly a mixture of triolein, tristeariu, etc., Engler made 
further experiments upon a similar distillation of these compounds, 
although on a very much smaller scale, and obtained confirmatory re- 
sults. The fact that petroleum contains no free carbon, which is cited 
as evidence against its organic origin, he disposes of by showing that 
if all the oxygen in the glycerides of fatty oils should combine with 
part of their hydrogen to form water, the residue would still contain 87 
per cent, carbon and l.'i per cent, hydrogen, whicli is almost exactly the 
average composition of natural petroleum. (Berichte, xxi, 1816.) 

Mctallocyanides of ethyl. — The ferrocyauide, (C2Hr,)4 FeCye, is de- 
scribed by Freuud, who prepared it by acting upon silver ferrocyauide 
with ethyl iodide. Recrystallized from chloroform it forms large rhom- 
bic crystals. Freund also makes some observations on von Tban's 
alleged platinocyauide of ethyl. (Berichte, xxi, 931 and 937.) 

O.rymethykne and formaldehyde. — Tolleus and Mayer, attempting to de- 
termine the molecular weight of osjtnethylene by Kaoult's method, find 
that upon solution in water it is converted into formaldehyde. The 
latter, m dilute solution, did not undergo polymerization, even after six 
months' standing, nor was it expelled upon heating; this fact being ex- 
plained by its transformation, in concentrated solution, into a polymer 
(CU^O).. Upon standing, this di- or paraformaldehyde quickly disso- 
ciates at ordinary tem])erature into formaldehyde. The oxymethylene, 
which is with difficulty soluble, is probably metaformaldehyde (CH20)3. 
(Berichte, xxi, 1560 and 3r)03.) 

Diacetyl. — By acting upon nitrosomethyiacetoue with a solution of 
sodium bisulphite, H. v. Pechmanu has prepared a compound which 
appears to be diacetyl, CH3.CO.CJ.CH3. It is a volatile liquid boil- 
ing at 87° to 88°, having a yellowish-green color, and an odor like crude 
acetone. Its vapor resembles chlorine in tint. Homologues of uitro- 
somethylacetone, similarly treated, yield homologues of diacetyl. (Be- 
richte, XX, 3162.) 

In a later pa{)er I'eclimann and Otte describe acetyl-butyryl, acetyl- 
isobutyr.vl, acetyl-isovaleryl, acetyl-isocaproyl, and acetyl-croton^l. 
(Berichte, xxi, 2140.) 



446 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

The fatty acids of the drying oils. — Norton and Richardson, in an 
investigation of linoleicacid prepared from linseed oil, have come to the 
conclusion that it is a mixture. About three-fourths of the original 
sample proved to be volatile, distilling under reduced pressure at 290o 
C. Ricinoleic acid exhibits a similar volatility, the non-volatile resi- 
due amounting to about oue-fourth of the sample, aud solidifying upon 
cooling. The volatile parts of the two acids appear to be identical, and 
to agree with the formula C20H36O2. Further investigation is prom- 
ised. (Am. Chem. Journ., x, 59 ) 

Tests for fats and oils. — This subject has been elaborately studied by 
Prof. H. W. Wiley, in the laboratory of the United States Department 
of Agriculture. On account of the increase in the use of cotton-seed oil 
as an adulterant of other oils, and in the manufacture of imitation lard 
and butter, he has paid special attention to its detection, and finds that 
Bechi's test for it is the most trustworthy. That test is based upon the 
fact that of all the fatty oils, cotton seed oil alone is able to reduce salts of 
silver. First, a solution of silver nitrate in water is prepared, to which 
a large proportion of alcohol and ether is added. Secondly, a mixture 
of amyl alcohol and rapeseed oil is provided. On adding to a suspected 
oil, first the silver solution and then the amyl alcohol preparation, and 
heating upon the water bath, the cotton-seed oil is readily detected. If 
it is present a color varying from brownish to black is developed, in con- 
sequence of the deposition of metallic silver. 

With the aid of Abbe's refractometer, he has also studied the refrac- 
tive indices of many fats and oils, finding such wide differences between 
them as to justify the use of the instrument in the discovery of adultera- 
tions or the identification of samples. (Journ. Anal. Chem., 11,^ 275 and 
277.) 

The co7nposition of Japanese birdlime. — This substance, which is pre- 
pared like European bird-lime from a species of holly, is extensively 
used in Japan for catching birds and insects. According to Divers and 
Kawakita it contains, apart from mechaiwcal impurities, such as bark 
and dirt, some lime salts, caoutchouc, and a nund)er of interesting 
organic compounds. Upon saponification with alcoholic potash it yields 
the potassium salts of palmitic acid and of a semi-solid acid not farther 
identified, a resinoid substance, and two crystalline alcohols. The latter 
are named mochylic aud ilicylic alcohols and melt at 234° and 1720, re- 
spectively. Mochylic alcohol is represented by the formula C26H46O, 
while ilicylic alcohol is CaaUssO. The ilicic alcohol, obtained by Per- 
sonne from European birdlime is C25H44O, and, being made from a dif- 
ferent species of holly, is probably a distinct compound. The three 
alcohols are homologous, and belong in a series having the general 
formula C^Hau.eO. The resinoid constituent of Japanese bird-lime has 
the composition C26H44O, differing from mochylic alcohol by having two 
atoms less of hydrogen. (Journ. Chem. Soc, Liii, 268.) 

A solid hydrocarbon in plants. — Helen C. de S. Abbott and H. Trimble, 



CHEMISTRY. 447 

in the petroleum ether extract from Cascara amarga aud Phlox Caro- 
lina, have discovered a solid, crystalline hydrocarbon, melting- at 106°. 
In composition it is represented by theformnla CuTIia, or some multiple 
thereof. (Berichte, xxi, 2598.) 

The synthesis of closed carbon chains. — During 1887 and 1888, W. H. 
Perkin, jr., has published a mnnber of i)ai)ers extending his earlier 
researches upon conipounds containing closed carbon chains. In some 
of these papers he appears in joint authorship with other investi- 
gators. 

By acting upon ethyl malonate in presence of sodium with trimethy- 
lene bromide a number of tetramethylene derivatives were formed, but 
the hydrocarbon itself could not be prepared. In the same reaction 
some pentamethylene derivatives were also produced. By other pro- 
cesses compounds involving hexa- and hepta-methylene were obtained. 
Some work was also done on tri methylene derivatives, and also on the 
synthesis of aromatic compounds having closed carbon chains. (See 
Perkin, Journ. Chem. Soc, li, pp. 1, 240, 702, 849, andLiii, 1 ; Colman 
and Perkin, ibid., li, 228, and liii, 185 ; Freer and Perkin, ibid., Li, 820, 
and LIII, 202, 215.) The aromatic comi)ounds were also studied by 
Kil)ping, ibid., liii, 21. None of these papers are suited for detailed 
abstraction. 

A new (jeneral method of synthesis for aromatic componnds. — Friedel 
and Crafts, continuing their researches upon the re-actions of aromatic 
hydrocarbons in presence of aluminum chloride, find that the latter 
re-agent causes benzene and its homologues to take up readily various 
elements, radicles, and acid anhydrides. Thus, when dry oxygen is 
l)assed into a mixture of benzene with aluminum chloride, it is slowly 
absorbed; and upon ti eating the mass with water i)henol is formed. 
Toluene, similarly treated, yields cresol. The benzene and chloride 
mixture easily takes up powdered sulphur, with evolution of hydro- 
chloric and sulphydric acids, and afterwards, with water, gives phe- 
nyl raercaptan, phenyl sulphide, and diphenylene disulphide. With 
carbonic anhydride the same fundamental mixtnre yields benzoic acid, 
with sulphur dioxide it gives benzylsuljjhurous acid, and so on through 
a long list of similar reactions. In every case, however, treatment with 
water is necessary to complete the re-action. 

In all these syntheses, according to the authors, the first step appears 
to be the formation of a peculiar organo-metallic compound, as follows: 

CgHe-f Al2Cl6=C6H5.Al2Cl5+HCl. 

This compound, CeHg. AI2 CI5, being formed, it is readily acted upon by- 
various agents, as, for example, by the paraflin chlorides, in which case 
hydrocarbon derivatives are produced with regeneration of aluminum 
chloride, thus: 

C«Ur>.Al,,Cl5 + ClI:,(Jl=C6lIr,.CH;,4-Al2Cl,i. 



448 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

This order of syntlicses is discussed in previous papers. In the present 
essay the reactions are but little more complex. In the first case, in 
which oxygen is taken up to form phenol, the equations are as follows: 

C6H6+O+A12C1«=0gH5.O.A12C15+H01, 

an oxygenated compound being formed which, upon treatment with 
water, is destroyed and phenol is generated. 

06H5.O.Al20l5+H2O=CfiH5On+Al2Cl5(OH). 

The definite addition compounds of aromatic hydrocarbons and alumi- 
num chlorides which were some time ago described by Gustavson, Frie- 
del and Crafts were unable to prepare. Instead they obtained variable 
mixtures. Tbey describe, however, a definite alnminum-phenyl, which 
serves as a starting point for still other syntheses. (Ann. Chim. Phys. 
(6), XIV, 433.) 

The application of aluminum chloride to organic syntheses in the 
fatty series has also been studied by Combes {ibid., xii, 199), with ref- 
erence to diphenyl by Adam {ibid., xv, 224), and in connection with 
naphthalene derivatives by Koux {ibid., xir, 289). 

Tnosite. — This substance, isomeric with glucose, has been elaborately 
studied by Maquenne. With acids it yields ethers which prove it to 
be a hexatomic alcohol, while with reducing and oxydizing agents it 
gives derivatives belonging in the aromatic series. Its constitution, 
therefore, seems to be "hexagonal" like that of benzene; but the evi- 
dence leads Maquenne to suppose that it contains no double bonds and 
is to be regarded rather as a derivative of hexamethyleue. As existing 
in plants it is perhaps an intermediary between the fatty and the aro- 
matic componnds, and one of the sources from which the natural ben- 
zene derivatives originate. (Am. Chim. Phys. (6), xii, 80.) 

Perseite. — Maquenne, in a new research upon this carbohydrate, finds 
by Eaoult's method that its molecular weight is represented by the 
formula C6H]406. It acts as a hexatomic alcohol, and its hexacetate, 
hexnitrate, etc., are described. (Compt. Rend., cvi, 1235.) 

In a later paper Maquenne revises his former conclusions, and shows 
that i)erseite is really a heptavalent alcohol of formula CHigOt. On 
treatment with boiling hydriodic acid it yields heptine, C7H12. (Compt. 
Rend., cvii, 583.) 

Gyaminin and j)lildn. — Two new carbohydrates, isomeric with inulin, 
are given the above names by Ekstrand and Johanson. The first is de- 
rived from the rhizomes of Trisetum alpesire ; the second from Phleum 
pratense. (Berichte, xxi, 594.) 

Cadaverin. — This base, derived from putrefaction, has been identified 
by Ladenburg as pentamethylenediamine. Both cadaverin and the 
synthetic compound form the same double salt with mei'curic chloride. 
(Berichte, xx, 2217.) 



CHEMISTRY. 449 

Futrescin. — This compound, iinalogous to cadaverin, has been identi- 
fied withtetramethylenediamineb^'^Udrdnzky and Bawmann. (Berichte, 
XXI, 2038.) 

Identity of the naphtenes icith the aromatic hexhydrides. — In 1883 Mar- 
kownikoff and Oglobliu obtained from Caacasiaii petroleum a series of 
hydrocarbons isomeric with the aromatic hexhydrides, to which they 
gave the name of naphtenes. Konovalotf, studying the hexhydro- 
pseu(U)cumene, which he prepared synthetically from pseudocumene, 
liuds it to be in all respects identical withnononaphteue, and concludes 
that the supposed naphtenes, as an independent series of hydrocar- 
bons, do not exist. (Berichte, xx, ref. 570.) 

Action of pyridine on metallic salts. — The observations of Jorgeusen 
upon metallic pyridine compounds have been extended to a number of 
new cases by Lang. When pyridine in excess is added to a solution of 
zinc chloride, a voluminous whit<^ precipitate is formed. This dissolves 
in boiling water with which pyridine has been mixed and crystallizes 
out in long silky needles having the composition ZnClj . 2C5H5JS". It is 
recrystallable from boiling alcohol, but water decomposes it into frpe 
pyridine and a basic chloride. 

From an alcoholic solution of copper chloride pyridine precipitates 
magnificent bluish-green needles of CUCI2.2C5H5K With copper sul- 
phate dissolved in water, pyridine produces a heavy, light green pre- 
cipitate, which dissolves in excess of the reagent. From the latter so- 
lution alcohol throws down the compound CuSO4.C5H5N.3H2O, which 
is essentially the normal sulphate with two of its water molecules 
replaced by one of the organic base. Cuprous chloride treated with 
pyridine in absence of air reacts so strongly that the mixture becomes 
boiling hot. Upon cooling the solution, crystals of CU2CI2.4C5H5N are 
deposited. With great excess of pyridine, six molecules are taken up, 
forming the salt CU2CI2.6C5H5N in long, greenish-yellow needles. 

With an alcoholic solution of cadmium chloride, pyridine precipi- 
tates the salt CdCl2.2C5H5]Sr. A similar salt, highly crystallized, is 
also formed by cadmium iodide. With mercuric chloride a compound 
llgCl2.C5H5N is produced. Anhj^drous cadmium chloride absorbs three 
molecules of pyridine with evolution of heat. Other salts of cobalt 
chloride, ferrous sulphate, and nickel sulphate with pyridine were also 
j)re])ar('d. 

(Berichte, xxi, 1678.) 

Pyridin and piper id in. — In a paper of nearly a hundred pages, Lad- 
enburg presents the collected results of recent investigations made 
partly by himself and partly by students under his direction, concern- 
ing the prei)aration and properties of the i)yridin, and pipeiidin bases. 
The compounds were partly synthetic, and in part derived from tar 
oil, and embrace i)yridin, three metliylpyridins, two ethylpyridins, 
isopropylpyridin, two dimethylpyridins, three nu'thylethylpyridins, di- 
ethylpyridin, and the corresponding members of the piperidiu series.

450 RECOKD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

(Ann. Cbem., ccxlvii,!.) Some higher homologues of the same series, 
synthetically prepared, are also described by Jaeckle. (Ibid., ccxlvi, 
32.) 

A new base from tea. — Under the name theophylline, A. Kossel de- 
scribes a new alkaloid which occurs with cafiteiue, but in very small quan- 
tities, in tea. Its formula, 0738^402, makes it isomeric with theobro- 
mine and paraxauthiue; from which bases, however, it distinctly differs. 
Unlike theobromine, it crystallizes with one molecule of water, and in 
crystalline form it is unlike either of its isomers. It melts at 264°, 
while paraxauthiue melts at above 280°, and theobromine sublimes 
without fusion at 290°. Its salts crystallize well. As it is convertible 
into caffeine by methylizatiou, it is doubtless a dimethylxauthinc, but 
the position of its methyl groups is not yet determined. (Berichte, xxi, 
21G4.) 

Some liomolo(jues of cocaine. — Starting from cocaine as methyl-benzoyl- 
ecgonine, F. G. Novy has prepared the corresponding ethyl, propyl, 
and isobiityl compounds, of which the first had already been described 
by Merck. In each case benzoyl-ecgonine was heated in a sealed tube 
with the proper alkyl iodide and the corresponding alcohol. The new 
alkaloids and their salts crystallize easily-, and all possess like cocaine 
strong annBSthetic properties. (Am. Chem. Journ., x, 145.) 

Isatropyl cocaine. — This alkaloid, discovered by Liebermann, was ob- 
tained as a bye-product in the extraction of cocaine from coca leaves. 
It is amorphous, forms amorphous salts, and has the composition rep- 
resented by the formula Ci9H23N04. Upon prolonged treatment with 
hydrochloric acid i-t is easily split up into methyl alcohol, ecgonine, and 
two isomeric isatropic acids, Cc,H802. In constitution it is probablj^ a 
cocaine, in which the benzoic radicle is replaced by one from isatropic 
acid. Physiologically, the new alkaloid is higlily poisonous, differing 
from cocaine and atropine, and acting mainly on the heart. (Berichte, 
XXI, 2342.) 

The allaJoids of areca nut. — From tlie areca or betel nut Jahns has 
obtained two new alkaloids. The first,«arecoline, CisHmNOj, is a color- 
less, oily liquid of strong alkaline reaction, which boils at about 220°. 
Its salts are easily soluble, and mostly crystallizable. It appears to be 
the physiologically active principle of the nut, and to be near pelletier- 
ine in its properties. The second alkaloid, arecaine, C7HnN02.H20, 
forms colorless, easily soluble crystals, whose solution reacts neutral. 
It loses its water at 100°, melts at 213°, and chars upon stronger heat- 
ing. Physiologically it is inactive. Probably it is related to betaine. 
(Berichte, xxi, 3404.) 

Atrojiine and hyoscyamine. — Ladenburg, investigating the isomerism 
of these two alkaloids, concludes that it is "i)hysical" in character, 
and that they are related to each other like tartaric and racemic acids, 
atropine being the inactive compound optically. The actual transfor- 
mation of one into the other is yet to be accomplished, the supposed 



CHEMISTRY. 451 

change lieretofore haviug been deceptive, ou account of impurities in 
the atropine examined. (Berichte, xxi, 3065.) 

Coloring matter from Drosera Whittal-eri. — From the tubers of this 
South Australian plant Eennie has isolated a magnificent red coloring 
matter which dyes silk brilliantly. It crystallizes easily from solution 
in hot alcohol or glacial acetic acid, and has the formula CuHsOs. From 
experiments upon the oxidation and reduction of the compound, Een- 
nie infers that it may be a trihydroxymethyluaphthaquinone. (Jour. 
Chem. Soc, li, 371.) 

The supposed identity of rutin and quercitrin. — These two tinctorial 
substances appioximate to each other so nearly in properties and com- 
position, that the question of their identity or distinctness has not 
hitherto been settled. By the action of strong acids both are decom- 
posed into qnercetin and isodulcite, they dye similar colors, and have 
many properties in common. Schunck now points out a number of 
differences in physical characteristics and reactions, and by careful 
analyses shows that whereas quercitrin contains two molecules of iso- 
dulcite to one of qnercetin, rutin has three of isodulcite to one of 
qnercetin. The differences and similarities are thus easily explained. 
(Jour. Chem. Soc, liii, 262.) 

The fluorides of the paraffin radicles. — Several of these compounds 
have been prei^ared and described by Moissan, partly in co-oi)eration 
wfth Melsans. They are produced by acting on silver fluoride with the 
parafiBn iodides, and up to isobutyl llnoride they are gaseous at ordi- 
nary temperatures. Methyl fluoride is a colorless gas of extreme sta- 
bility, which is saponifiable only with difficulty. It can be liquefled in 
Cailletet's apparatus. The ethyl compound liquefies at— 48, under 
normal pressure, and isobutyl fluoride becomes liquid at -f lO*^. The 
gases are combustible, and burn with a blue flame. (Compt. Kend., cvii, 
260, 992, 1155.) 

The action of fluoride of silicon upon organic bases. — By acting upon 
aniline, orthotoluidine, paratoluidiue, diphenylamine, dimethylauiline, 
and chinoline with silicon fluoride, Comey and Jackson have prepared 
II series of compounds which they designate silicotetrafluorides. In 
these compounds the nitrogen appears to be quinquivalent, one of its 
bonds being satisfied by fluorine and another by silicon. (Am. Chem. 
Jour., X, 165.) 

Other organic fluorine compounds, substitution derivatives of the 
aromatic series, are described by AVallach and Ileusler. Among them 
are difiuobenzene, parafluoanilin, fluonitrobenzene, parafluoi»henol, fluo- 
pseudocumene, fluodipbenyl, etc. (Ann. d. Chem., ccxLiii, 219.) 

Organo-metaUic com2)ounds.-;-The question as to the valency of bismuth 
is settled by the researches of Michaelis and Polls on bismuth triphenyl. 
This compound unites directly with two atoms of chlorine or bromine, 
to form halogen salts in which the metal is definitely pentavalent. (Be- 
richte, XX, 5-4.) 



452 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Ou the otber hand Marquardt has studied the trimethyl, triethyl, tri- 
isobuty], and triisoamyl compounds of bismuth. These only form salts 
by replacement of the alkyl radicle, which are compounds of the di- and 
monoalkyl compounds, the bismuth remaining triad throughout. (Be- 
richte, xx, 151(3, and xxi, 2035.) 

The tetraphenyl and tetratoiyl lead compounds have also been studied 
by Polis. The derivatives of lead tetraphenyl are salts of the dii)henyl 
compound, being formed by replacement and not by addition. (Be- 
richte, xx, 717 and 3331.) 

By Marquardt and Michaelis we have a research upon tellurethyl. 
When zinc ethyl acts on tellurium tetrachloride, the monochloride of 
tellurium triethyl is formed. Tellurium tetrethyl i)robabiy does not 
exist. Tellurium diethyl is also described. (Berichte, xxi, 2042.) 

By Michaelis and Weitz trianisylarsine and its compounds and also 
triphenetylarsine are described. In these bodies the arsenic remains 
trivaleut throughout. (Berichte, xx, 48.) 

A silico organic compound of a new type. — When silicon tetrabromide 
or tetrachloride is added to an excess of aniline diluted with three or 
four volumes of benzene, silicotetraphenylamide is produced. By dis- 
tilling oft" the excess of benzene on a water bath, and crystallizing the 
residue from solution in warm carbon disulphide, magnificent colorless 
prisms of the new compound are obtained. According to the dis- 
coverer, Prof. J. Emerson Eeynolds, its formula is Si(NB[06H5)4, and 
it seems to be the first well-defined compound in which silicon is in di- 
rect and exclusive union with amidic nitrogen. About 50 grammes of it 
were shown at the meeting of the British Association at Bath. (Ohem. 
News, LViii, 272.) 

The action of micro-organisms upon nitric acid. — Upon cultivating 
thirty-two species of micro-organisms in sterilized solutions containing 
nitrates, Percy Fraukland found a great difference in their power of re- 
ducing nitric to nitrous acid. Sixteen or seventeen of the species pro- 
duced the reduction more or less completely, while the remaining fifteen 
or sixteen were quite destitute of the power. In no case did the reduc- 
ing action lead to the formation of any noteworthy amount of ammonia. 
With two of the more powerful organisms the quality of nitrate reduced 
to nitrite in a given time was found to depend on the proportion of or- 
ganic matter — peptone and sugar— ^present in the solution ; the peptone 
exerting far more influence than the sugar. None of the organisms ex- 
amined were capable of oxidizing ammoniacal nitrogen — present as 
ammonium chloride — to nitricor nitrous acids. (Journ. Chem. Soc, Liii, 
373.) 

The same subject is also discussed by Warington, who made numer- 
ous experiments with pure cultures. He studied their action upon urea, 
upon milk, and upon nitrates, using in all twenty seven micro-organ- 
isms, many of them being well known as pathogenic. - Considering his 
own results in connection with those of Prankland aud others, as re- 



CHEMISTRY. 45o 

gards the iiitrifyiug power of orgauisius, he coucliule« that uo one who 
has worked with isolated bacteria has obtaiued more thau a mere trice 
of nitric or nitrous acid iu ammoniacal solutious. On tlie other hand, 
the mixed organisms present in arable !?oil produce distinct and com- 
plete nitrification iu ammoniacal liquids containing twenty-five parts of 
nitrogen in the million. Of twenty-five organisms studied, sixteen re- 
duced nitrates with considerable vigor, and seven were entirely destitute 
of reducing capacity. The reduction was from nitrates to nitrites, and 
not to nitrogen. (Jonrn. Chem. Soc, Liii, 727.) 

The chemistry of Jifih. — Atwater has published in the form of a pre- 
liminary notice the results of his elaborate analyses of the flesh of 
American food-fishes. One hundred and twenty-two specimens belong- 
ing to fifty-two species were examined, together with two Enroi)ean 
fishes, and an account of the methods of analysis is included iu the 
statement. The results are given in the form of elaborate tables, which 
are not suitable for abstraction. ( Amer. Chem. Journ., ix, 421, and x, 1.) 



MINERALOGY FOR 1887 AND 1888. 



IJv EnwARn S. Dana. 



GENERAL WORK IN MINERALOCrY. 

The wide interest felt duriug the last few years iu the general sub- 
ject of microscopical mineralogy, aud the advance made in this field, 
are well shown by the number of new works that have recently ap- 
peared which are devoted to this line of research. It has been in the 
allied department of petrography that the work has been most actively 
dune and the progress made, bat the result has been to bring about a 
most important advance in the instruments and methods of study ap- 
plied to mineralogy proper. The works of Rosenbusch and Zirkel, ( 1873,) 
were the pioneers in this directiou, and siuce then the workers have 
been many and the progress made rapid. A second edition of the work 
of Rosenbusch was published iu 1885, and now an English edition i has 
been given to students iu this country and Englaad by J. P. Iddings. 
In this translation the original work appears hi somewhat abridged 
form, but not so much so as to diminish its value, while making it rather 
more convenient of use. All that is essential has been retained, in- 
cluditig the large number of fine plates ofmicrophotographs. Another 
work of similar character is that of Rntley.^ The methods of studying 
minerals with the microscope are given systematically, with the charac- 
ters especially of those species which enter into the formation of rocks. 
A book of rather wider scope aud more profound character is that of 
Michel-Levy aud Lacrois.^ The first author has already made impor- 
tant contributions in this field, and the Mineralogie micrographique by 
Fouque and M.-Levy (1879^, is one of the most exhaustive memoirs that 
has been published. In the present volume the author introduces son^.e 
of the results of his former labors ; for instance, on the variation of the

angle of extiuctiou in crystal sectious cut in different directions, and 
other related subjects. The first part is thus theoretical ; the second 
gives a concise summary of the characters, chiefly physical, of rock- 
makinsf mineral species. This part of the work contains many original 
observations by the authors of tlie optical constants, indices of refrac- 
tion, absorption, and so on. Eosenbusch has also issued a set of tables 
giving in compact form the microscopical characters of all important 
minerals; ^ these will be found of great practical use by the worker in 
this line of research. 

Related to the works mentioned is that of Teall on Britisli Petrog- 
raphy, an extended and well illustrated volume, but tooexclusively pet- 
rograpbical to call for more than simple mention. Other imi)ortant pet- 
rographical works are those of Rosenbusch (Die massigen Gesteiue, 1887) 
and Roth (Allg. und cUemische Geologic, vol. 2, 1887). 

The work of Goldschmidb^ on Crystallography and the forms of crys- 
talline minerals is without question the most extended which has ever 
been undertaken in this field. The author has developed a new sys- 
tem of crystallographic notation, simpl}^ related to those in common use, 
and designed to exhibit especially the relations of the forms of a crys- 
tal as given in the projection. In connection he hasdeveloped a method 
of calculation adapted to this notation, and further has given a thorough 
discussion of the various systems that have been in use froni the ear- 
liest time down. This forms the first half of the first volume, after 
which begins the work i)roper, namely, the catalogue for each species 
of all the planes that have been observed with the literature, the letters 
and other notation of different authors, the equations for transforma- 
tion, and so on. The species are arranged alphabetically, and the whole 
work is to consist of three large volumes. The working mineralogist 
will profit to no small degree from the author's labors, though the fact 
that neither figures nor angles are given, arid that theoretical consid- 
erations have often led to a variation from the commonly accepted 
method for the orientation of the crystals of a species will restrict its 
usefulness. 

Several volumes on local mineralogy have recently appeared. The 
Russian Mineralogy ^ of von Kokscharof has now entered upon its tenth 
volume, and although the veteran author celebrated his fiftieth anni- 
versary of active service in 1887 he is still carrying forward his labors 
with vigor. The present state of knowledge in regard to the mineralogy 
of India is well presented by F. R. Mallet,* in a volume devoted to this

subject, aud foniiiii.i;' voliiine iv of tlie Geology of Indi.i. lOxcept in 
certain special directions, the mineral wealth of this country is but i)ar- 
tially developed, and much remains to be done, i)articularly on the 
scientific side. Progress will be stimulated and directed by this excel- 
lent volume. A large volume has been prepared by Liversidge ' on the 
mineralogy of Il^ew South Wales, being an extension of earlier publica- 
tions, by the author on the same subject. It is a handsomely jmblished 
work, with a large colored map of that part of Australia, and giving a 
detailed scientific account of the local mineralogy. The paragrai)hs 
on the discoverj^ and occurrence of gold, diamonds, tin ore, and similar 
subjects will be consulted with especial interest. 

The volumes on the mineral resources of the Uuited States for 1886 
and 1887,2 the fourth and fifth of the series, are too well known in 
character and scope to need to be described at length. They have been 
edited by David T. Day, with the assistance of various persons in special 
fields, and present very fully the present state of the development of the 
economic minerals and mineral industries of this country. The tabu- 
lated list of localities at which useful minerals are being and have been 
mined, prepared by A. Williams, and notes on localities of jjrecious 
stones, by G. F. Kuuz, may be mentioned as of particular miueralogical 
interest. 

A miueralogical report for California for 1886 has been issued by H. 
G. Hanks, and two other volumes for 1887 and 1888, by William Irelan, 
jr. Scacchi has published a list of the large number of species that have 
been identified or newly discovered — and in great part bj' himself — at 
the wonderfully active laboratorj' of Vesuvius. A list of the large num- 
bor of minerals from the neighborhood of New York City has been pub- 
lished by the late B. F. Chamberlin. Some other miueralogical Morks 
to be noted are the following : The Manual of Mineralogy and Lithology, 
fourth edition (1887), by James D. Dana. The Grundriss der Edelstein- 
kunde, by Paul Groth (1887). A Chapter in the History of Meteorites, 
by the late W^alter Flight (1887). The Mineral Physiology and Physi- 
ography, by T.Sterry Hunt, presents the author's theoretical views as to 
mineral classification and relationship. A new miueralogical periodical 
was commenced in 1887, called Kivista di Miueralogia e Cristallogratia 
Italiana, edited by R. Panebianco, at Padua.

trapezoliedral-tetaitohedial division like quartz, with the consequent 
power of civcuhir polariz itiou, has been recently studied by A. Schuiidt,^ 
and later by H. Traube,'^ on the niori)hological side. The material ex- 
amined was from Mount Avala, near Belgrade, in Servia,and the crystals 
have afibrded a considerable number of new forms, especially among the 
trapezohedrons. These trapezohedral planes are largely developed, thus 
exhibiting this character of the species. On the rhombohedral side the 
tetartohedral species, tourmaline,^ dolomite,^ and phenacite^ have been 
studied by Ramsay, Becke, and Penfield, respectively. The tetartohe- 
dral character of tourmaline was shown in 1871 by the Russian miner- 
alogist, Jerofeieff, who published a long pai)er upon the Russian species. 
This paper, however seems to have been for the most part overlooked 
by later wi iters. Solly (1884) describes a crystal from Pierrepont, New 
York, with tetartohedral development of planes, and Ramsay shows that 
there is no question in regard to this point. The crystals examined by 
him were from Ramfos and Snarnm, in Norway, and exhibited the tetar- 
tohedral character in the distribution of the planes and the asymmetric 
form of the etching figures. 

Becke's monograph upon dolomite is an important contribution to our 
knowledge of that species, giving a number of new forms, chiefly of the 
tetartohedral character, that is rhombohedrons of the third series, and 
establishing the right or left handed character of all these planes, as has 
not been attempted before. He also describes the vicinal planes, and 
the various methods of twinning with a large number of figures. Other 
crystals of dolomite, also exhibiting these tetartohedral forms have 
been described by A. Sella in a paper upon crystals of the rare mag- 
nesium fluoride, sellaite,'' named in honor of his father Quintino Sella. 

The phenacite crystals of Mount Antero, Colorado, are described and 
figured by Penfield; they are interesting since a tetartohedral form, 
that is, a rhombohedron of the third series is often the predominating 
form and terminates the crystals sometimes alone. An earlier account 
of these crystals was given by Des Cloizeaux. A somewhat related sub- 
ject is the crystallization of the two ruby silvers, pyrargyrite and prous- 
tite, studied exhaustively on the historical side a few years ago by Reth- 
wisch and now receiving new contributions from the original work of 
Miers.' He decides npon slightly difierent angles for the fundamental 
rhombohedron from those of Rethwisch (viz, 71° 22' pyrargyrite, 72° V2' 
proustite) and questions his conclusion as to the relation of this angle 
to the composition. The study of the fine series of specimens in the 
British Museum has enabled him to add upwards of twenty new forms

to the already long catalogue for the two species, aud others that are 
lot certain. He also distinguishes between the charactenst.c orrns ot 
pvraroynte and pH)nstite, not often atten.pted before, and develops 
the hemimorpliic nature of the two species. 

A study of some specimens of polianite from Flatten, Bohemia,^ has 
led to the interesting conclusion that the anhydrous MnO, crysiallizes in 
the tetraoonal system and is isomorphons with rutile (TiO,) cassiterite 
(SnO.) and zircon (SiO., ZrO.). The fact that the hard, gray n.anganese 
ore, polianite, was distinct from the soft pyrolusite was long ago insisted 
upon by Breithaupt, and his view is thus fully sustained. Flint has 
extended his ea.iier crystallographic studies and has given valuable 
contributions on scolecite, braunite, hausmannite and otli.r spec.es 
from Sweden. The crystals of rutile,^ apatite, and beryl, .> Alexand. 
dounty, North Carolina, are described by Hidden and W as nn,ton .nd 
shown to have a number of interesting features. Some of the species ot 
the chrysolite group have been studied by Bauer^ and the relation be- 
tween their forms and composition brought out. The species especially 
considered are chrysolite, hyalosiderite, and the magnesium silicate 
forsterite. Crvstals of kaolinite,^ rarely obtained in n form allowing o 
study, have been described by Allan Dick and their form measured and 
figured by H. Miers. A monoclinic parameter is assigned to them, viz : 

a:h : e :=0.5748 : 1 : 4.7267; /i=8io H' 

The kaolinite from Colorado"^ was recently referred to the tricliuic 
system of Reusch on the basis of an optical examination. The subject 
of the <;rystallization of ullmannite has been reviewed by Klein and it 
is shown that both kinds crystallizing in the pyritohedral and tetrahe- 
dral divisions of the isometric system are identical in composition, as 
proved by analyses by Jannasch. An inaugural address by Herschenz 
gives an account of the Harz barite, with a number of new forms Du- 
sing^ adds many other new planes for crystals of various ocalities ; 
many of them siem to be vicinal planes. The inexhaustib e species 
epidote has been taken up anew, the Swedish mineral oy Fhnk « tha 
from the Austrian Alps by Granzer,^ and again by Zimanyi," and that 
from Elba" by Artini. The result of these memoirs is to add a number 
of new forms to the already very long list. The absorption phenomena ot 
epidote have been studied by Eamsay.'^ Becke^^ continues a former line 
of investigation in describing the etching figures on pyrite, sphalerites,

mentioned the work of Hcistings^ on the double refraction of calcite ; 
remarkable as of a higher grade of accuracy than any experiments of 
the same kind before made, and which i>rove the law of Huyghens to 
be true to less than one part in five hundred thousand. In other words, 
it is concluded that there is no known method by which an error in it, 
if it is not absolutely true, can be discovered. Biickstrom- has contrib- 
uted a paper on the thermo electricity of crystals. An excellent discus- 
sion of the molecular structure of crystals has been given by Groth, in 
his address before the Munich Academy. A paper read by J. W. Judd^ 
before the Mineralogical Society of Great Britain is also an interesting 
discussion of the development of a lamellar structure in quartz crystals 
by mechanical means. Abstracts of a number of other papers of 1887- 
'88 referring more or less closely to mineral physics are given in Groth's 
Zeitschrift, vol. XV, p. 298 et seq. 

CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. 

Riggs has investigated anew the composition of tourmaline,'' and with 
improved methods has made a series of analyses, twenty in all, of the 
widely different varieties from typical localities. The following ratio is 
established : Si : B : R' : O = 1 : ^ : | : 5 and the formula E9B022Si04 
where W is the univalent equivalent of the bases with the oxygen-excess 
incorpoi^ated in an Al=() group. If an O— H group is assnmed the for- 
mula is written, R]nB022Si04. The typical kinds are then 

Lithia tourmaline I'^SiO;. SB.jOs 4H.2O. SAl.O;,. 2(Na,Li).30.

Magnesia tourmaline.. I'iSiO.. 3B3O3. 4H2O. 5A1,03. -g^MgO.fNaoO. 

WiiUing-5 has made the analyses of Riggs the basis of a series of cal- 
culations designed to throw light upon the composition. He concludes 
that the various varieties can be regarded as isomorphous mixtures in 
different i)roportions of the molecules 

Sii.BfiAligNajHsOH, and SiuBcAlioMgioHcOes. 

Clarke has added some analyses^ to those i>reviously published of 
diflerent kinds of mica, including amuscovite from North Carolina, and 
a number of iron micas from different points. The same author has 
studied tlie nickel ores of Oregon,'' which are similar to those of New 
Caledonia in composition. He concludes that the parent mineral was 
a nickel-bearing olivine. WhitfiehP contributes a series of analyses of 
some borates, colemanite, ulexite, ludwigite,axinite, etc.,usingrecentim-

proved methods in deteriniuiiig the boron. Pentield and Sperry^ have 
also worked in the same line, and their analyses of howlite prove that it 
is in fact a silicoborate, not a mixtnre as had been suggested before, and 
having the comi)osition flr.Ca^B-.SiOi,. 

Jaunasch^ has analyzed a series of heulandites from diiierent locali- 
ties and proved that they contain considerable amounts of strontium (up 
to 3.6 per cent.) which must have been overlooked by earlier analysts. 
Linck^ has made an examination of some iron sulphates from Chili on 
both the chemical and crystallographic side, adding a new species 
(queustedtite, see beyond) and also new points about copiapite, coquim- 
bite and roemerite, halotrichite and fibroferrite. The work of Frenzel 
and Darapsky in the same direction is mentioned on a later page. 

Eakins* gives descriptions and analyses of two sulphantimonites from 
Colorado, one of which is a fieieslebenite containing only lead ; the 
other has the composition 3PbS.2Sb2S:i. An inaugural dissertation by 
Carl Hersch is devoted to the discussion of the water in the zeolites 
with numerous analyses. Another by Vogel gives a number of analy- 
ses of vesuviahite from different localities, without, however, attempt- 
ing to establish a new formula. Still another by jSToelting discusses 
the relations of the "Schalenblende" to the ordinary isometric sphale- 
rite and the hexagonal wurtzite. He finds that wurtzite is generally 
present, and probably in many cases has been formed by molecular re- 
arrangement from the original sphalerite. 

An important series of papers by Julien^ discusses at length the re- 
lations of the different minerals coming under the general head of iron 
pyrites, pyrite, marcasite, and pyrrhotite, especially as regards their oc- 
currence together. The varying physical characters of pyrite, specific 
gravity, color, and especially resistance to change, are found to be due 
to the presence of marcasite — the less stable compound — with it in dif- 
ferent proportions. This is shown to have important applications as 
affecting the durability of building stones containing iron pj^rites. The 
alteration of pyroxene into serpentine has been minutely studied by 
Merrill" for the locality at Montville, New Jersey. The jade articles in 
the Washington Museum have been studied chemically and microscop- 
ically by Clarke and Merrill.^ 

The synthetic formation of minerals has been further studied by 
some of the French chemists, who have already done such important 
work in this direction. Among the various contributions in this field 
are the formation of crocoite, celestite, anglesite, hydrocerussite, by 
Bourgeois; of pharmacolite, by Duf^t ; of zincite, frauklinite, magne- 
tite, tephroite, rhodonite, wollastonite, barite, celestite, anhydrite, 
pyrolusite, by Gorgeu ; quartz and tridymite, by Kroustchoff; of pyro-

morpliite, mimetite, campy lite, by Michel: of pyrochroite, by de Schul- 
teu. Papers upon the above subjects will be fouud in Yolnines ix and 
X of the Bulletin of the French Mineralogical Society. 

A paper of esi)ecial interest on this class of topics is that of Doel- 
ter^ on the synthesis of the micas by fusing together various silicates 
with metallic fluorides. Thus the fusion of an aluminous hornblende or 
augite with sodium or magnesium fluoride yielded a magnesia mica 
(meroxeue) ; from an aluminous augite, with little iron, a mica resem- 
bling phlogopite was obtained, and from glaucophane a magnesia mica 
containing a considerable amount of soda. By fusing together the sili- 
cate K2A]2Si208 with potassium or sodium fluoride in potassium fluo- 
silicate, muscovite was obtained. With magnesium silicate a mica near 
phlogopite was the result, and if iron silicate was also used a brown 
mica near meroxeue was obtained. The same potassium silicate, with 
lithium silicate and potassium or sodium fluoride, yielded a mica with 
large axial angle. When i^eunine was fused with potassium silicate a 
product resembling phlogopite was the result; a magnesium garnet un- 
der like conditions, a meroxeue mica low in iron. Andalusite fused 
with the fluorides of potassium, of silicon, and aluminium yielded a 
muscovite, and by the addition of lithia andiron, a mica near zinnwal- 
dite. From vesuvianite mica was seldom obtained, the common result 
being scapolite. The author also describes his results in obtaining the 
calcium silicate, wollastonite, by fusing together OaSiOs with calcium 
and sodium fluorides. There have also been recent contributions to the 
same subject by Hautefeuille'^ and by Kroustchoft? 

NEW MINERAL OCCURRENCES. 

A point ot much interest is the discovery of a diamond-like form of 
carbon in the meteoric stone of Novo-Urei, Penza, Russia, which fell 
September 2U, 1886. This is described by Jerofeieff and Latschinoii'.* 
The meteorite was not unusual in general appearance, having a dark- 
gray color and consisted chiefly of olivine, augite, and nickeliferous iron. 
In the course of the analysis, however, it was found that from 2 to 2J 
per cent, was not attacked by acids ; nearly two-thirds of this proved 
to consist of amorphous carbon, and the remainder in the form of light- 
giay grains was also nearly pure carbon. These grains had a specific 
gravity of 3.1, and a hardness sufficient to scratch corundum, so that 
the ('(iu(!lusion was reached that they were true diamond, perhaps in 
a massive form like the carbonado. The occurrence of graphitic carbon 
in isometric form in an Australian iron is mentioned under the descrip- 
tion of cliftonite beyond.

color and strong pleochroism bas been noted at a number of localities 
since its original discovery, near Lyons ; these are Brignais, depart- 
ment of tbe lilione, France; Wolfsban, in Silesia; nearTvedestrand, in 
Norway; Harlem, New York, and Clip, Yuma County, Arizona. Tbe 
equally rare mineral bertrandite, a beryllium silicate, first found near 
Nantes, bas since been identified at Pisek, Bohemia, by Scharizer,i and 
in Colorado with the beryl and pheuacite of Mount Antero by Penfield.^ 
This last occurrence of pbenacite deserves special note, since it 
bas added materially to our knowledge of the species as noted before. 
Another new locality of ])benacite bas also been discovered in the region 
of. Stoneham, Maine,^ a few miles west, just across the State line in 
New Hampshire, in North Chatham. 

Lavenite, a mineral recently (18S5) described, from the island Laven, 
on tbe Norwegian coast, has been identified at several widely separated 
localities, thus in the elteolite syenite of Brazil, and the foyaite of West 
Africa. Attention bas been called by Judd* to tbe occurrence of leucite 
in Australia, and G. H. Williams"^ shows that tbe rare calcium titanate 
perofskite occurs in the serpentine of Syracuse, New York. Kunz^ de- 
scribes a variety of oligoclase remarkable for its glassy transparent char- 
acter; it is from Bakersville, North Carolina. It has been analyzed by 
Clarke, and later by Penfield,''^ and tbe latter finds further that it is ab- 
normal in its optical character, giving an extinction angle on tbe base of 
+ 40O instead of + 1. 

The Mammoth mine, Utah, has recently afforded a series of rare copper 
arseniates, most of which bad not before been known from this country 
These were first noted by Eicbard Pearce, and since have been described 
hy Hillebrand^ on the chemical, and Washington on the physical side. 
Among the species identified areolivenite, clinoclasite, pharmacosiderite, 
mixite, eriuite, tyrolite, chalcoph\ llite, brochantite, scorodite. Scorodito 
is also shown by Hague^ to be a hot spring deposit in the Yellowstone 
Park. 

Crystals of rhodochrosite, of a beautiful pink color, and perfectly 
transparent, have been obtained from tbe John Reed mine. Lake County, 
Colorado ; it is perhaps the finest occurrence of the si)ecies. Tbe western 
United States have also recently yielded fine specimens of azurite, 
cuprite, malachite, vanadinite, wulfenite, from Arizona; hanksite, cole- 
mauite, trona, from California, and many others. 

The recent demand for some of tbe rare chemical elements for technical 
purposes has led to tbe discovery that tbe supposed relatively rare 
minerals, zircon and monazite, occur on a large scale in the rocks and 
soil of North Carolina. During six months in 1887-1888, no less than 25

tons of zircons were obtained from the Green liiver mines, Henderson 
Conntv, North Carolina; the mining was carried on under contract 
with W. E. Hidden. The same mineralogist has described' the rare 
yttrium phosphate, xeuotime, from a number of new localities in North 
Carolina, and also from New York (Manhattan Island). 

Some of the most important mineral discoveries of the past two years 
are contained in the followJng descriptions of new species. 

NEW MINERALS. 

Amarantite. — See Hoh m aun i te. 

Arseniopleite. — A new manganese arseniate, belonging to a group of 
minerals to which a considerable number of new species have been added 
recently. It occurs in cleavable masses or nodules, often forming small 
veins, with rhodonite and hausmannite, in a crystalline limestone at the 
Sjo mine, Gryhyttan, Sweden. Its color is reddish brown. It has been 
investigated optically by Bertrand and found to be uniaxial with nega- 
tive double refraction, and probably is to be referred to the rhombo- 
hedral system. An analysis yielded the following : 

AsjOs SbaOs MnO FeaOs PbO CaO MgO H.O CI. 

44.98 trace -28.20 3.68 4.48 8.11 3.10 4.54 trace = 97.14. 

Deducting impurities and correcting it according to the state of oxi- 
dation of the manganese it becomes Mn^ Oj 7.80, MnO 21.25. (Described 
by L. J. Igelstrom in Bull Soc. Min., 1888, vol. xi, 39.) 

AuerUte. — A new thorium mineral of peculiar interest because it seems 
to occupy an intermediate position between the silicates and phos- 
phates. It was discovered by W. E. Hidden, in Henderson County, 
North Carolina, occurring in disintegrated granitic rocks associated with 
zircon and implanted upon it in parallel i)Ositiou. It is found in pris- 
matic tetragonal crystals like zircon in form and angle. It has a pale 
yellow to orange or deep red color. The hardness is 2.5 to 3, and the 
specific gravity 4.42 to 4.77, the orange-red crystals having the higher 
density. The luster is wax like and it is brittle and easily criunbled.

The water and carbon dioxide are present in al)Out the ratio of 10: 1. 
Assuming the homogeneity of the material, which its appeal auce seemed 
tojastif5% the mineral is a hydrous silicate and phosi)hate of thoiium. 
It will be ren.embered that the cerium phosphate, mouazite, uniformly 
contains more or less thorium silicate about which there has been some 
<lifference of opinion as to whether it is an impurity or not; this new 
mineral throws light upon the question. It is named after Dr. Carl 
Auer von Welsbach. (Described by Hidden and Mackintosh in Amer. 
Journ. Sci., 1888, xxxvi, 4G1.)

MIKERALOGY. 465 

Awaruite. — A kind of nickeliferoiis native iron found in the drift of 
the Gorge Riv'er, which empties into the Awarua, or BigBay, on the west 
coast of the middle ishmd of ^N'ew Zeahtnd. It is believed to have been 
derived from a peridotite, now altered largely into serpentine, and is 
associated with gold, platinum, cassiterite, chromite, magnetite. Its 
hardness is about 5, and the specific gravity S.l. The composition is 
expressed by the formula FeNig, as shown by an analysis by W. Skey, 
viz : 

Ni Fo Co S SiOa • 

67.63 31. Oa 0.70 0.22 0.43=100 

This terrestrial uickeliferous iron is closely allied to the similar me- 
teoric mineral which has been called octibbeiiite, found in Oktibbeha, 
County, Mississippi. (Described by G. H. F. Ulrich in Amer. Journ. 
Sci., 1887, xxxiii, 244.) 

BarJceviJcite, etc. — In a preliminary account of the results of an ex- 
tended study of the minerals of the augitesyeuite and elieolite-syenite 
veins of Southern Norway, W. (J. Brogger has given brief accounts of 
a number of new species. Full descriptions are promised later. The 
names of these are, harJcevikite, caleiothorite, melanocerite, nordenaJciohUne, 
rosenbuschite. They are characterized briefly as follows: 

Barlcenikite is a mineral belonging to the amphibole group, and most 
closely related to arfvedsouite ; it is distinct, however, in optical char- 
acters. 

Calciothoritc is a hydrous silicate of thorium and calcium, and it is 
inferred, as seems very probable, that it is an alteration product of an 
original thorium silicate (ThOjSiO^) ic>omorphous with zircon. Thorite, 
orangite, eucrasite, freyalite, are other hydrous silicates that probably 
have had a similar origin. 

Melanoccrite is a complex silicate of the cerium metals, yttrium and 
calcium, with other substances in small amounts, including 3 per cent, 
boron trioxide. It occurs in dark-brown crystals, belonging to the 
rhombohedral system, and tabular in habit. 

Nordenshioldine, named after the Swedish mineralogist and explorer, 
A. E.Xordeuskiold, is a mineral of remarkable composition, viz, a borate 
of tin and calcium, CaO.SiiOuB203. It has a sulphur-yellow color ; its 
hardness is 5.5 to G, and its specific gravity 4.20. It appears in tabular 
rhombohedral crystals. 

Bosenhuschite, named after Professor I^osenbusch, of Heidelberg, is a 
silicate of calcium and sodium with zirconium, titanium, and lanthanum 
in small amount. It belongs to the mouoclinic system and its crystals 
are near wollastonite and pectolite in angle, and it is accordingly called 
azircouium-pectolite. The color is orange-gray; the hardness is 5 to G, 
and the specific gravity 3.30. 

This account is given in the Geol. Forening Forhandlingar (Stock- 
holm), 1887, vol. IX, 247, and an abstract is given in Groth's Zeit

tioned as another new mineral from the same region but not described. 
Barysil. — A new load silicate from the Harstig' mine, Pajsberg, Swe- 
den. It is referred to the hexagonal system, has basal cleavage, white 
color, hardness equal to 3, and a specific gravity of C.ll to 6.55. An 
analysis afforded :

16.98 77. HI 3.49 0.16 0.41 0.58 0.06=100.12 

The formula is accordingly 3PbO. 2Si02. It occurs in iron ore with cal- 
cite, yellow garnet, tephroite, and galena. The name has reference to 
its high specific gravity. (Described by A. Sjogren and Luudstrom in 
the (Efversigt Vet. Akad. Forhandlingar, 1888, xlv, 7.) 

Belonesife. — The study of a mass of aucient volcanic rock enveloped 
in the Vesuvian lava of 1872 has led to the discovery of two species to 
which Scacchi has given the names belonesite (belonesia) and cri- 
phiolite (crifiolite). Belonesite, as the name suggests, occurs in needle- 
like crystals. These are white and transparent, and are referred to the 
tetragonal system. The material was iusufiQcient for an analysis, but 
qualitative tests led to the conclusion that it is a molybdate of magne- 
sium. 

GripMolite occurs in small tabular crystals belonging to the mono- 
clinic system. They are covered by apatite so as to be concealed by 
it, whence the name given to the species. The color is honey-yellow; 
the specific gravity 2.674. An analysis gave: r.O;, 48.91, MgO 33.58, 
CaO 14.60. Loss 2.01 = 100. The examination showed that tluorine 
was probably present, and the amount is estimated as nearly equal to 
7 per cent. The mineral is hence near wagnerite in composition. 
(Described by A. Scacchi in Mem. Accad. Napoli, 1887, vol. i. No. 5.) 

Bemenflte.—A new manganese silicate from the prolific locality at 
Franklin Furnace, New Jersey. It occurs in stellate aggregations, 
having a foliated structure and in aspect closely resembling somepyro- 
phyllite. The color is a pale grayish-yellow; it is soft and friable; the 
specific gravity is 2,981. An analj'sis yielded : 

H20

This yields the formula 2(H2,Mn)0,Si02. It is found that the water goes

Beryllonite. — A new beryllium phosphate from Stoneham, Maine. A 
preliminary description announces that it occurs in colorless crystals 
and cleavage fragments. The crystals are highly modified, and belong 
to the orthorhombic system, with a prismatic angle of about 120°. The 
hardness is 5.5 ; the s[)ecific gravity 2. A qualitative analysis by H. L. 
Wells shows it to be an anhydrous phosphate of beryllium and sodium.

beryllium phosphate, herderite, and the beryllium silicate, phenacite. 
(Described by E. S. Dana in Amer. Journ. Sci., 1888, vol. xxxvi, p. 290). 

BiicMnfjite. — Announced by G. Linck as a new iron sulphate from 
Tierra Amarilla, near Copiapo, Chili. A further study has proved it to 
be identical with roemeiite, and in a later paper he describes it under 
this name. The material has allowed of a more perfect crystallographic 
and chemical investigation than has hitherto been possible. (Jahrb. 
tiir Min., Vol. i, 213, 1888; Zeitschr. fiir Kryst., 1888, vol. xv, p. 22). 

Calciothorite. — See Barkevikite. 

Calciostrontianite. — A name given by Cathrein to a calcium-bearing 
strontianite from Brixlegg, Tyrol, and corresponding to the mineral 
" from Massachusetts" called by Thomson in 1836 emmonite, after Prof. 
E. Emmons. 

Cliffonite. — A form of graphitic carbon found in the meteoric iron of 
Youndegin, West Australia (discovered 1881). It occurs in minute 
cubic crystals imbedded in the iron, and separated by dissolving the 
iron in acid. The average thickness of the larger crystals is one- 
hundredth of an inch. The cubic planes predominate, but dodecahedral 
faces were also noted. They are black in color ; the hardness is 2.5, 
and the speciiic gravity 2.12. They were proved chemically to be pure 
carbon, and they resemble graphite in most of the characters except 
form and greater hardness. These observations are of interest in view 
of the recent discovery of carbon, having the hardness of the diamond 
in a meteoric stone (noted above), and also the earlier observations of 
Haidinger on isometric crystals of carbon, supposed to be pseudomorph 
after pyrite in the Arva iron. Cliftonite is named after Prof. R. B. Clif- 
ton, of Oxford, by L. Fletcher, in the Mineralogical Magazine, 1887, 
vol. VIT, p. 121. 

Cristobalite. — A form of silica in minute octahedal crystals found at 
the tridymite locality of Cerro San Cristobal, near Pachuca, Mexico. 
They are associated with tridymite in cavities in andesite. It is not 
certain whether they rei)resent an allotropic form of silica, or as seems 
more probable a pseudomorph after some mineral in isometric octahe- 
drons. A cubic form of silica (melanophlogite) wasfound by Lasaulxon 
the sulphur of Girgenti. Cristobaliie is described by G. vom Eath in 
the Jahrb. Min., 1887, vol. i, 198. 

BahlUtc. — A mineral of remarkable composition, since it contains both 
calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate; it is in fact the first case in 
which a phosphate and carbonate occur in the same species. The nat- 
ural suggestion that the carbonate is present as impurity only, in the 
form of calcite, is regarded by the describers as inapplicable, since their 
microscopic examination convinced them of its homogeneity; Dahllite 
occurs as a rather thin crust, having a rounded lustrous surface and a 
fibrous structure, the fibers being perpendicular to the underlying base 
of massive reddish apatite. In color it is pale yellowish wliite or reddish

yellow; it is trauslucent aud resembles chalcedony. It is optically, 
imiaxial aud uegative. The hardness is about 5 aud the specific gravity 
3.053. An analysis yielded the following results:

38.44 6.29 53.00 0.79 0.89 O.il 1.37 = 100.89. 

This leads to the formula 4 Gag PgOs + 2 Ca CO3 + H2O. The locality 
where it has beeu found, though only very sparingly, is the apatite re- 
gion in the parish of Bau)le, Norway. Named after by W. C. 

Brogger and Backstroin in the ffifversigt Vet.-Akad. Forhaudlingar, 
Stocliholm, 1887, }). 493. 

Bihydro-fhenardite. — A sodium sulphate, allied to theuardite, but, as 
the name suggests, containing two molecules of water. It crystallizes 
in the mouoclinic system. It forms a thin bed on the shores of Lake 
Gori, Tiliis, Eussia. (Described by Markovnikoft'iu Jouru. Kuss. Phys. 
Chem., and an abstract in the Berichte deutsch. Chem. Ges. Berlin, 
1887, p. 546). 

Edisonite.—A rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide and (if dis- 
tinct from rutile) the fourth form in which this oxide is known to occur in 
nature- The original specimen was found in 1879 by VV. E. Hidden at 
the Whistnant gold mine, Polk County, North Carolina, in the concen- 
trations of placer washings. It was associated witb zircon, xenotime, 
rutile, monazite, and a number of other species. It has a bronze-yellow 
or golden-brown color, a resinous to adamantine luster and a yellowish 
white streak. The hardness is about 6 aud the specific gravity 4.26 to 
4.28. The symmetry of the form is that of an orthorhombic crystal aud 
the crystallographic study by Des Cloizeaux (Bull. Soc. Min., 1886, 
vol. IX) shows that it does not vary very widely from the tetragonal type, 
and in angle bears a certain relation to rutile; he calls it, in fact, a 
dimorphous form of rutile. A qualitative examination by Damour 
showed it to be essentially TiOa in composition and a more thorough 
analysis by Penfield, undertaken later, has confirmed this and proved 
the absence of all other substances except a trace of iron. Named after 
Mr. Thomas A. Edison, by W. E. Hidden, in Amer. Jouru. Sci., Oc- 
tober, 1888, vol. XXXVI, p. 272. 

Eudidymite. — A new silicate of sodium and beryllium from the island 
Obere Aro in the Langesundfjord, Norway. In his preliminary account 
Brogger describes it as occurring in tabular mouoclinic crystals having 
the axial ratio a:h: c=1.7107: 1: 1.1071, fi=SQ^ 14i'. The crystals are 
twins with the basal planes as twinning plane, which is also the direc- 
tion of cleavage. The color is white and the luster vitreous or pearly. 
The hardness is 6 and the specific gravity 2.553. The optic axes lie in 
the plane of symmetry and the acute positive bisectrix makes an angle 
of 580 30' with the vertical axis in the acute angle of (5. The first an-

It is associated with aualcite, natrolite, and apopbyllite. (Brogger in 
Nyt Mag. f. Vid., vol. xxxi, 196, 187; Nordeiiskirdd in Geol. Forening. 
Foi'bandl. 1887, vol. ix, 434.) 

Facellite or PhacelUte. — Described by E. Scaccbi (Rend. Accad. Na- 
poli, December, 1888) as a new mineral from Monte Somma; it is, bow- 
ever, evidently identical with the mineral from tbe same locality 
called by Mieriscb kaliopbilite (Tscbermak's Mineral, petrograpb. 
Mittheilungen, vol. viii, p. 1(50). It occurs in acicnlar crystals which 
are optically uniaxial, and probably belong to the hexagonal system. 
They are colorless, have a hardness of G, and a specific gravit3' of 
2.493. An analysis yielded : 

Si02 AI2O3 KiO NiiiO 

37.73 33.09 29.30 0.37 = 1,0.49. 

This agrees closely with the formula KAlSi04 or K3O, AI2O3, 2Si02, 
which is that given to kaliopbilite. It falls into the same group with 
nephelite which has an analogous formula, and also the lithium silicate 
eucryptite. 

Griqualandite. — A name given by G. Grant Hepburn to a variety of 
the silicitied crocidolite from South Africa ; well known under the name 
of tiger-ej^e. He regards it as a silicate of iron, but it is obviously not 
a distinct mineral but an indefinite mixture of silica and hydrated iron 
sesquioxide. (Chemical I^ews, May, 27, 1887.) 

Fiedlerite. — Sec Lanrionite. 

Eeliophyllite. — A new chl or o- arsenate of lead occurring with rhodo- 
tilite (see below) at Pajsberg, Sweden. It has a pale sulphur-yellow 
color, and a foliated structure showing one distinct cleavage yielding 
thin plates. These show an acute bisectrix in the polaris'^ope with sym- 
metrical axial figure, from which it is safely concluded that it belongs 
to the orthorhombic system. The hardness is 2, the specific gravity 
6.886; on the cleavage surface the luster is adamantine, elsewhere 
vitreous. An analysis yielded: 

AssOs PbO MnO.FeO CI 

11. 69 .80. 70 0. 54 8. 00 = 100. 3 ; deduct 1. 80 = 99. 13. 

This corresponds to tbe formula Pb4As207 -f 2PbCl.., which requires 
As2O;il2.03, PbO 81.28, CI 8.63=101.94 (deduct 1.94=100). This min- 
eral has essentially the composition of Nordenskiold's ecdemite from 
Mngban, but differs in form and is probably identical with a mineral 
noted as occurring with ecdemite and at that time referred to the 
orthorhombic system. (Described by G. Flink in CEfversigt Vet. Akad. 
Fiirhandl. Stockholm, 1888, ]) 574.) 

EiorfflaMitc. — See Barkevikite. 

Hohmamiite. — In specimens of copiapite from Caracoles, Bolivia, 
Frenzel has identified a new iron sulphate, and perhaps two new species. 
The mineral, named hohmannite after the discoverer, occurs in brown- 
ish red fibrous aggregates having the optical characters of a triclinic 



470 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888, 

species. The hardness is 3, and the specific gravitj' 2.24. Associated 
with it is the other iron sulphate called ainarantite, which is in aggre- 
gates of minute prismatic crystals. These are orange-red in color, and 
in cleavage and optical characters they approach hohmanuite. They 
are, however, less readily attacked by water. The composition of the 
two minerals is the same, viz: Fe2032SO:j4-7H20, the analyses being as 
follows :

An earlier analysis of hohmannite gave somewhat different results but 
was made on less pure material. There is little doubt, therefore, that 
both minerals are to be united under the above name. (Min. petr. Mitth., 
1887, vol. IX, 397, 428.) 

Horsfordite. — A new copper antimonide, analogous to the copper 
arsenide, algodonite, and the silver antimonide, d^^scrasite. It is a mas- 
sive mineral, resembling native silver in color, with a high luster on a 
fresh surface but soon tarnishing. The hardness is 4 to 5, and the 
specific gravity 8.812. The mean of three analyses gave : 

Sb Cu 

26.86 73.37 = 100.23. 

The formula lies between CusSb and Cu^Sb, the analytical results 
agreeing ver}' closely with Cuu Sb^. It forms an extensive deposit 
near Mytilene in Asia Minor. It is named after Professor Horsford by 
A. Laist and T. H. Norton in Amer. Chem. Journ., vol. x, p. 60, 188-. 

Inesite. — A hydrated silicate of manganese and calcium, probably 
the same mineral as that called rhodotilite by Plink (see below). It 
occurs in fibrous radiated forms, of a flesh-red color, in the Dillinburg 
region, Germany. Hardness, 6 to 7 ; specific gravity, 3.103. An anal-

from Bachmut in southern Russia. It occurs in considerable quantity 
in reuiform concretionary forms and though impure may have technical 
value. (Verb. Euss. Min. Ges., St. Petersburg, vol. xxiii, p. 116.) 

Ldnyhanite. — A mineral of unusual composition, a silicoantimonate of 
manganese and iron. It occurs in hexagonal prismatic crystals, often 
complex in form and resembling apatite. It has an iron-black color, 
a metallic luster and conchoidal fracture. The hardness is 0.5, the 
specific gravity 4.918. An analysis yielded :

The author regards this as corresponding- to a iiiauganese silicate (Miir, 
SiO:) and autimonate of iron (FeaSb^Os) in about the ratio of 4:1. 
Liiugbanite is found at L^ngban, Sweden, in granuhir limestone with 
schetierite, magnetite, and rhodonite. (Described by G. Flink, in the 
Zeitschrift f. Kryst., 1887, vol. xxiii, p. 1.) 

Lansfordite. — xV white translucent miueralliaving a crystalline struct- 
ure and vitreous luster. The hardness is 2.5, the specific gravity 1.54 
to 1.69. An analysis by Keeley gave :

Of the very large amount of water contained 26.3 per cent, were lost over 
sulphuric acid at the end of a week. The formula deduced is SMgCO;,, 
Mg(UH)2+21H>0. It occurs as a stalactitic growth in the anthracite 
coal mine of Lansford, near Tamaqua, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. 
(Described by F. A. Genth in Zeitschr. f. Kryst., vol. xiv, p. 255.) 

Laubanite. — A new zeolitic mineral resembling stilbite from the 
basalt, near Lauban, Silesia. It occurs in fine fibrous radiated snow- 
white aggregates, sometimes spherical iu form. The hardness is 4.5 
to 5 ; the specific gravity 2.23. An analysis gave:

This corresponds to 2CaSi03, Al2(Si02)3, 6H2O, which brings it near 
to laumontite. (Described by H. Traube in Jahrb. Min., 1887, vol. 
II, 64.) 

Laurionite. — A mineral of comparatively recent origiu, having been 
formed as the result of the action of sea-water upon the ancient lead 
slags at Lauriou, Greece, where there were lead and zinc mines worked 
by the Greeks before the Christian era. Laurionite occurs iu white 
prismatic crystals related to mendipite in form, and has a hardness of 
3.5. An analysis by Bodewig gave : 

Pb O Cl H2O 

79.38 3.17 13.77 3.68 = 100. 

This gives the formula Pb(0H)2, PbCl^. 

Associated with the laurionite is another mineral in tabular mono- 
clinic crystals and having the same qualitative composition. It is in- 
ferred to be also an oxy-chloride of lead and has been named Fiedlerite 
after Baron Fiedler. (Described by G. vom Rath iu Sitzungsber. Nied. 
Ges. Bonn., June 6, 1887.) 

Mangcoio-tantalite. — A member of the tantalite-columbite group of 
minerals from the gold washings in the Ural. It has the form and 
habit of common columbite, but the specific gravity is 7.37, and the 
color, though nearly black, is orange-red in thin splinters. The follow- 
ing analysis by Blomstrand shows it to be pure tantalate of manganese :

Martinite. — A pseudoraorphous mineral having the form of gypsum, 
but consisting chiefly of calcium phosphate ; it is from the gnano of the 
Island of Cura^oa. It appears in aggregates of minute rhombohedrons, 
white or yellowish in color. The specific gravity is 2.894. An analysis

Melanocerite. — See Barkevikite. 

Metalonchidite. — A varity of marcasite from the St. Bernhard mine, 
near Hausach, Badeii. It is peculiar in containing 2.7 per cent, of 
arsenic, with some nickel and lead, and hence approaches Breithaupt's 
lonchidite. (Described by F. Sandberger in Oesterreich. Zeitschr. Berg. 
Hiitt., 1887, vol. xxxv.) 

Meiastihnite. — A form of antimony sulphide, like stibnite in composi- 
tion, but of a bright red color, like the corresponding compound obtained 
in the laboratory. It occurs sparingly as an amor]djous red deposit at 
Steamboat Springs, California. (Described by G. F. Becker in Mono- 
graph XIII, U. S. Geological Survey.) 

NordenHliolMne. — See Barkevikite. 

Paposite. — A hydrous iron sulphate from the Union mine near Pa- 
posa, Atacama. It occurs in dark red crystalline masses, having a 
fibrous radiated strncture. The formula obtained by Darapsky is 
2re203, 3SO:.4-10Il2O, so that it approaches closely to fibroferrite.

Harstig mine, Paj.sberg, Sweden, It occurs in massive forms, having a 
columnar or fibrous structure, aud shows two uuequal cleavages inclined 
at an angle of 82.^ degrees. On the basis of an optical examination it 
is referred to the triclinic system. The color is rose-red and the luster 
silky. The hardness is 4 to 5, and the specific gravity 3.03. An an- 
alysis yielded :

This gives as the formula 2 (MnCa).Si03+H20, which brings it in com- 
position near the hydrorhodonite of Igelstrom which is MuSi03-|-H20. 
In form aud appearance it bears some resemblance to wollastonite and 
pectolite. It is the most recently formed of the minerals of the Harstig 
mine, filling cavities between calcite crystals. (Described by G. Flink, 
in CEfversigt Vet. Akad. Forliandl., Stockholm, 1888, p. 571.) See 
Ineslte, above. 

Riehecldte — A mineral belonging to the amphibole group, from the 
island of Socotra, where it was collected by Dr. E. Riebeck, after whom 
it is named. It appears in slender prismatic crystals, having the char- 
acteristic cleavage imbedded in granite. The color is black. An analy- 
sis, after deducting 7.12 per cent, zircon, yielded :

50.01 28.30 9.87 0.63 1.32 0.34 8.79 072 = 99.98. 

It is thus like the pyroxene ffigirito, essentially a silicate of iron sesqui- 
oxide aud soda, aud is regarded as occupying the same place among the 
amphiboles. The mineral arfvedsonite has occupied this position, but 
recent analyses have made it contain chiefly iron protoxide, and if these 
are- sustained, riebeckite cannot be united with it. (Described by A. 
Sauer in Zeitschr. deutsch. Geol. Ges., 1888, vol. xl, 138.) 

Bosenbiischite. — See Barkevikite. 

Sulj)hohnh'fe. — A mineral consisting of the sulphate and chloride of 
sodium. It was discovered by W. E. Hidden on the hanksite of Borax 
Lake, San Bernardino County, California, and thus far is extremely 
rare. It appears in rhombic dodecahedrons, which are transparent and 
of a faint greenish-yellow collor. The hardness is 3.5, aud the specific 
gravity 2.489. An analysis by J. B. Mackintosh yielded: 

SO3 Cl NajCOs

or calculating the chlorine and sulphur as combined with sodiuna only: 

NajSOa XaCl NajCOs

This corresponds to 3Na2S04 2NaCl. The name sulphohalite is given in 
allusion to the unusual composition of the mineral. (Described by W. 
E. Hidden and J. B. Mackintosh in Amer. Journ. Sci., 1888, vol xxxvi,

BOTANY FOR 1887 AND 1888. 



By F. H. Knowlton, M. S., Assistant Curator in the National Museum. 



The years 1887, 1888 have witnessed the publication of a very largre 
amount of material, considerably in excess of that of many furiner 
years, without there, being published anything of special moment. The 
results that have been presented may be regarded siaiply as a contin- 
uation of the various lines of investigation that have occupied attention 
during later years. Since the field of systematic botany has been so 
thoroughly worked up, more and more attention has been shown to the 
investigation of problems of histology, physiology, and embryology. 
Notwithstanding the many avenues open for the publication of material 
of this character, several new periodicals have been inaugurated: Mal- 
phigia, The Annals of Botany, Pittonia, Garden and Forest, etc. The 
constantly increasing attention that has been given of late years to the 
study of Bacteria has resulted in the production of such a mass of ma- 
terial that it can no longer be considered under the head of botany, 
and must be relegated to the special journals and works devoted to the 
subject. 

The compiler desires to make special acknowledgment for valuable 
assistance to the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society, in which 
Prof. A. W. Bennett has given so complete a digest of current botanical 
literature. 

veCtEtable anatomy and physiology. 

The structure of the vegetable cell-wall has been much investigated 
of late years, and many of the mooted questions had seemingl.y been 
set at rest, but the latest observations may possibly render some of them 
doubtful. Elliott (Trans. Bot. Soc. Edinb. xvii) has given an interesting 
resume of recent researches in this direction. Beginning with the pre- 
sentation of the theory of growth by opposition as defined by Prings- 
heim, and the theory of intussusception as presented by Niigeli, von 
Mohl, and others, he traces the growth of ideas as modified by the 
researches of Schmitz, Strasburger, Wiesner, Klebs, Schneck, and 
others, and concludes that the present stateof our knowledge warrants 
the following conclusions : (1) Growth of the cell-wall may be affected 
by deposition from the protoplasm of the cell ; (2) the cell-wall, however, 
always contains, during the life of the cell, living protoplasm, which is 

475 



47G RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

luiited to the cell-protoplasm ; (3) this iiitraniural protoplasm appears 
in some cases capable of growth on its own account; (4) possibly the 
cell- wall is formed in the same way as th(i starch grain. Pechi (Atti 
Soc. Tosc. Sci. IsJ^at., viii) has very recently studied the thickening of 
cell-walls in the leafstalk of Araiia. During the early stage of growth 
the thickening takes place mainly in the angles, but later distinct lay- 
ers of cellulose are formed within each cell, which soon becomes lignl- 
fied. From this the author concludes that in the earlier stages the 
thickening is mainly by intussusception, and during the later stages 
probablj^ by opposition. On the other hand, Noll (Abhandl. Sencken- 
burg Naturf. Gesell. xv) concludes, from an experimental application 
of staining reagents, that growth takes place chiefly by oi)positiou, and 
the part played by intussusception is unproved. Krabbe has also 
studied the structure and growth of the cell -wall (Pringsheim's Jahrb. 
f. Wiss. Bot., xviii). He investigated especially the process of increase 
in thickness in the walls of the bast cells of the Apocynacece and As- 
clepiadaceo', and found them to be composed of lamellae, which are 
themselves made up of lamelljB. These lamella? apparently arise by 
fresh formations from the protoplasm. Intussusception he regards as 
Inlaying only a subordinate part, and must be confined to the innermost 
lamelKne. Zimmermanu has an exhaustive treatise, "Die Morphol. u. 
Physiol, d Pflanzenzelle," which forms the third volume of Schenck's 
" Handbuch der Botanik." It treats very fully of the structure and 
chemical composition, as well as the physiology of the cell. 

The morphological and chemical composition of j^rotoplasm has been 
treated of at great length by Schwarz (Bcitr. z. Biol. d. Pflanzen, B. 
V). He has given many details of the action of various reagents upon 
protoplasm and its various modifications, only a few of which may be 
here enumerated. The varying acid or alkaline reaction of cell-sap he 
attributes to the substances in solution in it, such as pigments. The 
protoplasm he has found to be always alkaline in reaction, as also is the 
cytoplasm, nucleus, chromatophores, and in some cases the protein- 
grains. The chlorophy] the author regards as having a fibrillar struct- 
ure composed of what he calls chloroplastin. The nucleus is composed 
of several substances, among which he recognizes chromatin, pyrenin, 
linin, and paralinin. The cytoplasm is made up of three substances: (1) 
the cell-sap, (2) the microsomes, insoluble in water and the cytoplasm ; 
(3) the cytoplastids. All the nuclear substances, with the exception 
of chromoplastin and cytoplastin, are soluble in concentrated potash- 
lye, or a 10 per cent, solution of sodium chloride. 

"The influence of light upon protoplasmic movement," in Journ. Linn. 
Soc. Lond., XXIV, is the title of a long paper by Moore. The well- 
known circumstance of the chlorophyll grains becoming collected into 
masses in sunlight and being more or less dispersed in darkness has 
been very fullj^ re-investigated, and the conclusion reached is that these 
displacements are more the result of illumination than heat. Frank 



BOTANY. 477 

applied the term epistrophc to tbe distribution of the grains upon the 
free walls of the cells, and apostrophe to the arrangement on the side 
walls. Apostrophe produced by strong illumination Moore i)roposed 
to call ^josi^ire and that produced by weak illumination, /te^a^/re. He 
coins the word phytolysis for the whole of these phenomena. He also re- 
investigated the question as to whether the grains are drawn along pas- 
sively with the streaming plasma, or whether they iiossess the power 
of independent motion. He finally adopts the conclusions of Sachs, 
Pfeff'er, and others, that they are drawn along passively. 

The nucleus has been the subject of numerous experiments and stud- 
ies. Thus Zacharias (Bot. Zeit. xlv.) has investigated its structure 
and concludes that the cell-nucleus of both plants and animals is com- 
posed of two distinct substances, which he calls plastin and nucUn, which 
remain undissolved after treatment with artificial gastric juice. The 
nuclin forms the colorable filament loups of the nucleus 'that remain 
after treatment with artificial gastric juice or hydrochloric acid, sharply 
defined and shining in appearance. It also readilj^ absorbs certain pig- 
ments, especially methyl-green. Plastin, on the other hand, is an essen tial 
constituent of the entire protoplasmic cell-contents, and differs from 
nuclin in its action under reagents. The prevalent theory that the vital 
properties of the cell are derived from the nucleus has been confirmed 
by Klebs (Biol. Centralbl.), who plasmolysed living cells of Zygnemia 
with a solution of sugar. The effect of the plasmolysis was to cause 
the cell-contents to contract and separate into two halves, each contain- 
ing one of the two chlorophyll bodies, while the whole of the nucleus 
was contained in one of the halves. The half cell containing the nucleus 
soon regained its activity and surrounded itself with a new cell-wall. 
The half-cells destitute of nucleus, while they retained their vitality 
for a considerable time and even produced an abundance of starch, never 
started to grow, and could not secrete a new cell-wall. Zacharias has 
still more recently studied the part taken by the nucleus in cell-division 
(Ber. deutsch. Bot. Gesell. v.). He confirms the earlier observations 
that the cell protoplasm docs not penetrate into the nucleus during its 
division. Haberland (op. cit.), has studied the position of the nucleus 
in mature cells and reaches the conclusion that their i)Osition is not ar- 
bitrary, but depends on its function as the bearer of the idioplasm which 
governs development. The young condition of the vacuoles has been 
investigated by Went (Arch. Neerland, xxi.). lie finds, contrary to 
the general opinion, that minute vacuoles are present in the youngest 
cells, for example, in the growing point. He also found vacuoles in 
oospheres, pollen-grains, and cambium-cells. Halsted has recorded 
(Bot. Gaz. xir.) the finding of three nuclei in pollen-grains of iSambucus 
racemosa. 

Chlorophyll has also been made the subject of recent investigation. 
Tschirch has given (Ber. deutsch. Bot. Gesell., v) a resum6 of recent 
studies on the composition of ch1oro])hyll, and concludes thjit iron is 



478 KECOKD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

not a necessary coustituent. He gives C28H47N3O6 as the formula for 
pbyllocyanic acid. Schunck has also studied the chemistry of cliloro- 
pbyle (Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond., XLii). Hausen states (Arbeit. lust., 
Wiirzburg, ill) that the oraugered i)igmeut reported to have been 
observed in leaves is only an aggregation of the yellow chloroi)hyll 
pigmeut, which has an oraugetint wheu present iu deuse masses. Epi- 
dermal chlorophyll has beeu further studied by Moore (Journ. Bot., 
XXV) and the preparation of pure chlorophyll described by Macchiati 
(Malpighin, i), Peyfon (Compt. Rend., cv), has devised an iustrumenf; 
with which he has iuvestigated the hourly variatiou iu the action of 
chlorophyll, findiug that the fuuction at different hours in the day is 
proportional to the intensity of light. 

Nuuierous other cell-conteuts have beeu studied. Hillhouse (Midi. 
Nat., X and xi) has investigated the fuuction of tauuiu, aud finds that 
it is not used in the process of growth after its production, and it can 
not therefore be regarded as a food material. Fribosin is described by 
Zopf (Ber. deutsch. Bot. Gesell., v) as a new cell-content, found in the 
conidia of Podosphcera, Sphccrotheca aud Erysiplie. The formation of 
oxalate of lime in leaves has been investigated by Schimper (Bot. Zeit,, 
XLVi), aud the formation of calcium oxalate by Wakker (see Bot. Cen- 
tral bl., xxxiv). In regard to the acid secretion from the roots of plants 
Molisch states (Sitzb. K. K. Zool. Bot. Gesell., Wien, xxxvii), that it 
attacks organic substances even more powerfully than inorganic, aud 
not only dissolves them but induces other important chemical changes. 

The use of histological elements as a means of classification has been 
further iuvestigated during the year, and while no comprehensive dic- 
tum can yet be laid down, substantial progress has beeu made, ai.d the 
prospect is that when all plants have been thoroughly iuvestigated 
distinctive characters will be detected. Hildebrandi, for example, has 
examined a large number of species of Ambrosiew and Senecionidecs 
(Beitr. Z. vergleich. Anat. der Arabros. u. Senec. Inaug. Diss.) and con- 
cludes that they may be very clearly distinguished by the histological 
elements. Jiiunicke (Bot. Centralbl.,xxxi) also concludes that the three 
genera of the Geraniacece examined by him can be distinguished from one 
another by characters derived from the structure aud distribution of the 
vascular bundles iu the leaf and flower-stalks. Juel (Bot. Centralbl., 
xxxiii) has studied the anatomical structure of the Marcgraviacem, and 
Solereder (see Bot. Centralbl., xxxiii) has discussed "The systematic 
value of the perforation in the walls of vessels," and Wible has a paper 
" Zur Diagnostic des coniferen Holzer." On the other hand, Plitt (Beitr. 
z. vergleich. Anat. d. Blattstieles d. Dikotyledoneu) has examined the 
petiole or leaf-stalk of two hundred and eighty-three plants in thirty 
natural orders for characters of systematic value and the results were 
mainly negative, and Saupe (Flora, lxx) has investigated the wood of 
Lefinminosea; and finds that the division into the sub-orders Papilion- 
aciv Cesidpimeff and Mmoseie does not correspond to structural differ- 



BOTANY. 479 

euces in the wood. He finds, however, that the species of most of the 
tribes, such as Genistece, Dalhergiece^ etc., do exhibit common char- 
acters, and in a few genera, e. //., Cassia, Cercis, Podalyria, Sophora, the 
species may be distinguished by histological characters. The structure 
of the Chenojwdiacecc has been worked out in an elaborate manner by 
Professor St. Gheroghieflf (Bot. Ceutralbl., xxxaiid xxxi), and he finds 
that many species may be distinguished by the histological elements of 
stem or roots. 

The further contributions to this same general subject have been 
unusually numerous. A few only may be mentioned by title: Daguil- 
lon, "Structure of the Leavesof Certain Conifene" (Bull. Sec. Bot. France, 
XXXV); Flot, "Aerial Stems" (/. c); Baillon. "Ovules of Plantago" 
(Bull. Mens. Soc. Linn., Paris, 1887); Penzig, "Anatomy and Diseases 
oftheAurantiacea?" (Rome, 1887); Halsted, "Trigger-hairs of the Thistle- 
flower" (Torr. Bull., xv) ; Schenck, "Anatomy of Water Plants" (Uhl- 
worm u. Haenstein's Bibliot. Bot., i) ; Coulter and Rose," Development 
of the Fruit of Umbellifeme" (Bot. Gaz., xii). 

The literature relating to the fertilization of flowers has been particu- 
larly extensive, and during the year much valuable information has been 
obtained. Thus Hildebrandt (Bot. Zeit., XLV), has studied the fertiliza- 
tion of Oxalis, and i)articularly the trimorphic forms. For example, in 
Oxalis Boiciei the short-styled form was found to be only imj)erfectly 
fertile when polinated with its own pollen, and the seedlings from this 
form produced only mid-styled plants, while the short-styled crossed 
with the mid-styled produced mid-styled plants exclusively. Many other 
equally iiiterestiug results were brought out. Burck (Ann. Jard. Bot. 
Buitenzorg, vi), who has been working on heterostylism and self fertiliza- 
tion, announces the finding of transition forms between dimorphic and 
trimorphic flowers in species of Conarins, Averrhoa, etc. Robertson, 
(Bot. Gaz., XII), describes the method of fertilization of Calopogon parvi- 
Jiorus^ asserting that it is accomplished by small bees; Lindmau (Bot. 
Centralbl., xxxii), describes methods for fertilization of certain Ali)iue 
plants, and Magnus (Bot. Contralbl., xxxiii), has studied the pollina- 
tion of /Si/ene tn/fo to. Jordan's paper, "Beitr. z. physiologischen Or- 
ganography d.Blumen "(Ber.deutsch. Bot. Gesell., V), isoneof themost 
extensive. He studied flowers representing three classes, viz: Actino- 
morphic honey-flowers, Actinomorpliic pollen flowers, and Zygomorphio 
honey-flowers. He found in all an evident adaptation for cross fertiliza- 
tion by aid of insects. The polination of ZamiiehelUa lyalustris is de- 
scribed by Roze (Morot's Journ. Bot., i). The single stamen is located 
at the base of the cui)uliform perigyne, which includes from one to six 
pistils, is at first almost sessile, bnt just before flowering the filament 
elongates and carries the anther above the pistils and the i)oHen in fal- 
ling is caught by the funnel-shaped stigmas. MacLeod (Arch, de Biol., 
VII), has added a sort of appendix to the great work of IMiiller on the 
fertilization of flowers. 



480 KECOKD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Of other papers ou the same subject may be menlioned the following: 
Robertson, "Insect Relations of Certain Asclepiads" (Bot. Gaz., xii); 
Arcangeli, "Flowering ofEuryale ferox''' (Atti Soc. Tosc. Sci .Nat, viii) ; 
ISicotra, "Pollination of Serpias'''' (Malpigdia, i) ; Oliver, "Pollination 
of Pleurothallis ornatus^'' (Nature, xxxvi); Webster, "Fertilization of 
Eiripactis latifolia,''^ (Bot. Gaz., xii); Bateson, (Ann. Bot., i), "Effect 
of Cross-Fertilization on Inconspicuous Flowers." 

Wortman has studied the rotation of tendrils and finds that the move- 
ment is similar to the movement of climbing stems, being however much 
more irregular. The movement in some species is not always uniform, 
that is, a part of a tendril may rotate to the right and another part of 
the same tendril rotate to the left. Gardner (Proc. Roy. Soc, Lond., 
XLiii), has continued his exceedingly interesting experiments on the 
pulviuus of Mimosa pudica. He examined sections cut under an aqueous 
solution of eosin, and found that the coloring matter penetrated and 
acted upon the protoplasm of the outer cells of the convex side of the pul- 
viuus, while the si^ecially irritable tissue on the other side was left un- 
stained. Electricity was then employed and the extreme delicacy of 
the irritable tissue was manifest. In conclusion, Gardner states that in 
his opinion the protoplasm of plant as Avell as animal cells is capable of 
active contraction, and the movements of all irritable plant organs is due 
to a definite contraction of the jirotoplasm. Vines (Rep. Brit. Assoc. 
Adv. Sci., 1887) has extended these experiments upon Mimosa, and finds 
that atropiu causes the closing of the leaves or an effect similar to dark- 
ness, while physoatigmin produces the opposite effect or that of light. 

Elliott has given (Trans. Bot. Soc. Edinb., xvii) a valuable resume of 
opinion in regard to the movement of wati-r in plants. The old view 
of Sachs, linger, and others, that the water travels in the walls of the 
lignified tissues, is proved by the later experiments of Van Tieghem, 
Elfving, and others to be wrong, since in branches of Taxusm pigment 
solution, the walls of the cells remain uncolored, while the cavities of 
the cells are full of coloring matter. The weight of opinion inclines to 
regard the path of the water as through the cell caviry. The part 
taken by the medullary rays in the movement of water has been re-ex- 
amined by Janse (Pringsheim's Jahrb. f. Wiss. Bot. xviii), and the 
theory propounded by Godlewski is confirmed by his experiment. The 
living parenchymatous elements of the wood undoubtedly take an im- 
portant part in the movement of water. The investigations were made 
mostly with conifers, but the author thinks that it would be the same 
in dycotyledons. "The Literature of Transpiration," by Biirgerstein 
(Verhandl. k. k. Zool. Bot. Gesell. Wien, xxxviii) is important. He 
has collected a list of two hundred aud thirty-six works, of greater or 
less magnitude, published between 1672 and 1880. No less than six- 
teen languages are represented. Henslow also has a paper ou " Trans- 
piration as a function of living protoplasm," in Journ, Linn Soc. Lond. 
Bot. XXIV. Wiesner has a paper in Bot. Zeit. XLV. (Jhristison, who has

conducted a series of experiments to ascertain the relative montbly in- 
crease in the girth of trees (Trans. Bot. Soc. Ediub., xvii), concludes 
that in Scotland the commencement of the growing season in deciduous 
trees is in April, and reaches its maximum in June 5 that of evergreens 
is earlier, attaining its maximum in May. The end of the growing 
season is for both about the end of August. The " Growth and origin 
of multicellular plants" has been studied by Masser (Jouru. Bot. xxv). 

CHEMISTRY OF PLANTS. 

Some exceedingly interesting and valuable results have lately been 
brought out in regard to the sources of nitrogen in plants. The long- 
current statement that plants necessarily absorb their nitrogen in a 
combined form seems to require moditicatiou. Indeed Lawes and Gil- 
bert some time ago pointed out that the ordinary sources of supply in 
the soil will account for only a fraction of the amount used by plants. 
H. Marshall Ward (Ann. Bot. i) has given a valuable resume of "Some 
Eeceut Publications Bearing on the Sources of Nitrogen in Plants, " 
the first of these, the now well-known paper by Frank, published in 
1875, aunounciug the discovery of a symbiosis between the roots of cer- 
tain plants, notably Cupuliferic, and a fungus. These fungoid growths 
surround the roots by a dense mycilial web. A part of the hypha? pen- 
etrate the epidermal cells of the root, wliile the rest act as or take the 
place of root hairs, there being in these trees no root hairs developed. 
The fungus, it will thus be seen, is essential to the life of the host, for 
by its aid alone is it able to take up the nutritive material of the soil. 
Later, in 1886, Hellriegel, director of the agricultural experimental sta- 
tion at Bernberg, iu conducting an extensive series of experiments to 
ascertain the sources of the supply of nitrogen, reached results that 
throw very considerable light upon the question of symbiosis as de- 
scribed by Frank. He cultivated Gramincic in soil destitute of nitro- 
gen and shut off from all possible sources of supply except the free air. 
After the supply of nitrogenous materials stored up in the seed had 
been exhausted the plants ceased to grow, and unless furnished with a 
fresh supply, all died. Tliere can thus be no doubt that they are una- 
ble to utilize free nitrogen from the air. On the other hand, peas cul- 
tivated under precisely similar conditions continued to grow. The 
only time at which the growth was stopped was when the supply in the 
seed was exhausted, when there was a brief period of cessation of 
growth, but this was soon overcome and the plants again became 
healthy and vigorous. The question is, Whence came the nitrogen 
which allowed a growth of this kind ! The only answer is that it must 
have come from the air, and evidently the Leguminosefe possess powers 
not enjoyed by the Gramiiia'. Uelhiegel noticed that the plants that 
quickest recovered and were tlie most vigorous were those in which the 
roots exhibited the largest number of the well-known tubercular swell- 
ings, whicli, as was then known, were caused by ^vhat were called bac- 
H. Mis. 141' 31

teria. Little stress was placed by Hellriegel on the observations of 
Frank, but as Ward has sliown in his paper " on the tubercular swell- 
ings on the root of Vicia Faba" (Phil. Trans., 1887), there is a clear rela- 
tion between the presence of this fungus and the power of fixing pure 
nitrogen, enjoyed by Leguminous plants. A further contribution to 
the same subject is given by Lawes and Gilbert in Proc. Roy. Soc. 

XLIII. 

" The Comparative Chemistry of Higher and Lower Plants," by Miss 
Abbott (Am. Nat., xxi), is a very suggestive paper, although still lack- 
ing confirmation in many particulars. It is claimed by the author that 
a progression in chemical complexity can be traced pari passu with 
the progression in structural differentiation. Of the other jiapers of 
more or less interest may be mentioned the following: Staco, " Plant 
Odors" (Bot. Gaz., xii); Schimper, " Ueber Kalkoxalatbildung in den 
LaubbUittern" (Bot. Zeit. 46 Jahrg). 

Krasser, " Ueber den microchemiochen nachweis von Eiweiss korperu 
in den Pflanzlichen Zellhaut" (Bot. Zeit 46); "On the Nature and 
Toxic Principle of the AroidcT," by Pedder and Warden (Journ. Asi- 
atic Soc. Bengal, lvii). The authors here found that the irritating effect 
on tongue, stomach, etc., of the Aroidew is a purely mechanical one. 
The cells of the Arums are filled with needle-shaped crystals of oxa- 
late of lime and by mechanical action produce the deleterious effects; 
" The AsU of Tillaudsia usneoides, by Palmer (Am. Nat. xx). 

TECHNOLOCtY. 

The constantly increasing attention that is being given to the micro- 
scopical study of plants has given rise to a copious literature of the 
subject, which has been considerably added to during the year. Det- 
iner's "Das Pflanzenphysiologische Praktikum" is perhaps the most 
imjiortant work that has appeared. The work is evidently the result 
of the author's i)ersonal experience in teaching physiology, and is a 
very carefully written account of all the manipuhitions required to 
illustrate the ordinary facts of plant physiology. The details are very 
minutely given. " Manipulations de Botanique, guelle pour les travaux 
d histologic vegetale," by Girod, is also a valuable work. "The appli- 
cation of the paraffin — imbedding method in Botany," by Moll (Bot. 
Gaz., XIII), is a very interesting paper detailing accounts of the sucess- 
ful imbedding and cutting of the most delicate vegetable tissues, such 
as the growing point of roots and stems, flower buds, etc. The appli- 
cation of zoological methods to botany has only recently been success- 
ful, since the last edition of Strasburger's " Botauische Praktikum" 
contains no mention of it. Schonland has also contributed observations 
on the process of imbedding (Bot. Centralbl, xxx, and Bot. Gaz., xiii), 
and Campbell also has a short note in Bot. Gaz., xiii. Bumpus has 
described (Bot. Gaz., xii) a simple and inexpensive self-registering aux:- 



BOTANY. 483 

anometer, and Barns {op. ci^) has described a registering auxanoraeler. 
Goodall (Am. Journ. Sci. xxxv) has described a combination auxauo- 
meter and clinostat. Campbell has recorded some interesting experi- 
ments (Bot. Gaz., XII) regarding the successful staining of the nuclei of 
Hying cells. A 0.1 per cent, solution of dahlia, a violet-i)ur})le pigment, 
was made and this diluted with from fifty to one thousand parts of water. 
The object, as for example the stamen hairs of Trculescantia, on being 
immersed in this solution for a time had the nuclei very deeply stained. 
The ordinary protoplasmic movements were not interfered with in any 
way. Campbell has also another note on the absorption of analine 
colors by living cells (Bot. Gaz., xii), a continuation of investigations 
first made by Pfefifer. Welling has a short paper in The Microscope, 
VIII, on staining and mounting plant sections, and Doherty (Am. 
Mouth. Mic. Journ., ix) has given extensive notes on the staining of 
animal and vegetable tissues. 

TEXT -BOOKS. 

The following text-books have appeared during the year : " Elements 
of Botany,?' by Gray ; " Botanische Practicum," second edition, by Stras- 
burger ; '' Course of Practical Instruction in Botany," Part ii, by Bower 
and Vines ; " Elements of Botany " by Bastin ; '' A Manual of Botany," 
fifth edition, by Bently ; " flaud-Book of British Flora," fifth edition,

tical Biology (vegetation)," by Shore. 

DIATOMS. 

The Diatomasem collected by the Challemjcr expedition have been 
worked up by Castracane and presented as volume ii of the Botany of 
the expedition. He first reviews the biology of diatoms, and writes of 
geographical and bathymetrical distribution. He proposes the terms 
'• valval " and '• zonal " to take place of the confusing terms " side-view " 
and " end-view." Several new genera and a host of new species ar^ 
described. The classification followed is that proposed in 1872 by H. L. 
Smith ; Costracane has also a note (Atti. Accad. Pontif. Nuovi I/nc. 
xxxviii), recording the finding of diatoms in the stomachs of Echini and 
Holoilmrece dredged from a depth 2,511 to 5,274 meters. Imhof cl.iims 
(Biol. Centralbl., vi,that he has detected the pores through whic^i pro- 
toplasmic filaments are protruded in the valves of certain large species 
of Surirella. Kain and Taylor have given (Torr. Bull., xiyj a list of 
the diatoms found at Tampa Bay, Flori<la. Smith has a note oji diatom

484 KECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

ALG^. 

The most important American work is the long-promised "Fresh- 
water Algte of the United States," by Francis Wolle. It is comple- 
mental to the author's " Desmids of the United States," which was pub- 
lished in 1882, and makes two handsome volumes, one of text and one 
of plates. The atlas contains 151 plates and over 2,300 illustrations, 
drawn from nature by the indefatigable author himself. The classifica- 
tion adopted is, so far as applicable, that employed for the Marine 
Alga3, viz : Ehodophycete, chlorophyceie, and cyanophyceae, the melan- 
ophycese not being represented. The classification, however, is unex- 
plained and the exact views of the author are difficult to ascertain- 
The subject of i^olymorphism among alg« is given a prominent place. 

Bennett (Journ.Linn. Soc, Lond., xxiv) has recently proposed some 
modifications in the existing systems of classification of Alg;©, based 
largely on retrogression or degeneration, which, according to the au- 
thor is manifested by more or less suppression of reproduction or vege- 
tative organs. He traces the various forms of vegetable life to three 
lines of descent, represented by three distinct kinds of cell-contents, 
viz : Colorless, blue-green, and pure green. The first, originating in 
the bacteria, includes all the fungi ; the second type consists of unicel- 
lular organisms, in which the cell-contents is composed of pale, blue- 
green endochrome without distinct chlorophyll-grains, starch-grains, or 
nucleus. The third series, and the only one which has developed into 
higher forms of vegetable life, is characterized by cells containing chlo- 
rophyll-grains, starch-grains, a nucleus, and usually a true cellulose wall. 

The last published part of Agardh's classification of algte (Lunds 
Univ. Arsskr., xxiii) refers to the Siphonecc. He divides the whole 
group into six families : (1) Bryopsideae ; (2) Spougodieai ; (3) Udotea- 
cete; (4) Valouiasea' ; (5) Caulerpene; (G) Dasycladete. "Pbysiol. u. 
alogologische Studien," by Hansging, Prag., 1887, is a collection of the 
author's papers published before on various algological toi)ics. Mme. 
A. Webea van Bosse has described (Nat. Verb. Holland. Maatsch der 
Wetteuschappen, Haarlam, 1887), the curious discovery of algjc para- 
sites in the hairs of sloths. Two new genera and three new species are 
chai.^cterized. Potter (Journ. Linn. Soc, Lond., xxiv) has given ob- 
serva'tious on the curious alg* growing on the shell of the European 
tortoise. Janse (Plasmolytische Versuch. an Algen, Bot. Centralbl., 
xxxii) shows that the living protoplasm in various algie is permeable 
to dilut'e solutions of mineral salts and cane sugar. The plasmolysis 
completej.v disappears in two hours, and after four days the cells have 
regained th^ir former turgidity. " Zur Entwicklungsges einiger Con- 
fervaceen," by Laugerheim, is an interesting paper on the development 
of confervaceae. The sensitiveness of Spirogyra to shock is described 
by Coulter (Bot. Gaz., xii). He finds that when the filaments are cut 
through with a , sharp instrument, eight or ten cells nearest the point

of laceration show remarkable changes in their protoplasmic contents, 
the bands of chk)rophyll being broken. Cooke's finely illustrated work 
on " British Desmids" has reached parts 7-10. Oliver has a valuable 
paper " On the Obliteration of Sieve-tubes in Larainariea^ " (Ann. Bot., 
i); Holmes has a short note (Trans. Bot. Soc, Edinb., xvii), on the fruc- 
tification of Splincelaria raflicans and aS. oUvacea'y Scott, "On Nuclei 
in Oscillaria and Tolypothrix," (Journ. Linn. Soc, Loud., xxiv) ; Nord- 
stedt, "The fresh-water Algjie of I^ew Zealand," (see Bot. Centralbl., 
xxxi); Piccone, " Desseminationof Alg.eby Fish" (Nuov. Giorn. Bot., 
Ital., XIX). 

CHARACE^. 

Dr. Allen has given the results of his long-continued studies of those 
little-known plants in his " Charace.ie of America," part i. This part is 
devoted to the introduction, morphology, and classification, the descrip- 
tive portion being reserved for a final part. The key to the classifica- 
tion is translated from ]N"ordstedt, with additions of American species 
detected since its original publication. The Characeas are world-wide 
in distribution and number in all something over two hundred forms, 
distributed as follows : JSltella, 93 species and varieties; Tolypelln, 13; 
Lamprothamn)is,4:', IJchnothamnus, 3; Chara, 102. The same author has 
given (Torr. Bull., xiv) notes on Characea?, in which several new forms 
are described : Nltella Mitfhnafafrom the Feejee Islands ; N. Morongii, 
from Nantucket, and TolypeUa (afterwards changed to NiteUa) Macounii, 
from the Niagara River. Vines has a short note on Apospory in GharaceiB 
in Ann. Bot., i. Knowlton (Bot. Gaz., xii) has described a fossil species 
of Chara (C. compressa) from the Wasatch group at Wales, Utah. This 
is the second American species found fossil, the other {C. glomerata Lx.) 
being from the Green Eiver group at Florissant, Colorado. 

FUNGI. 

The activity in the investigation of fungi still continues unabated, 
and although few large works have appeared during the year, much 
material, in the form of short papers containing descriptions of new 
species, revision of genera, etc., has been contributed. 

The most important general work is the continuation of Saccardo's 
" Sylloge Fungorum.'' De Bary's excellent work has been translated 
by Garnsey under the title of "Comparative Morphology and Biology 
of the Fungi, Mycetoza and Bacteria." It is indispensable to all ele- 
mentary students of these groups, and is the best working book that 
we have. Burrell and Earll's "Parasitic Fungi of Illinois, the Eresi- 
phere," is one of the most valuable American publications. It describes 
about forty species and reduces many so called species to synonyms 
of well-known forms. Cohn's " Kryptogamen Flora v. Schlesein, 
Pilze," for which Schroeter is preparing the fungi, has reached the 
second part. It concludes the description of the Myxogastres, and 



486 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

embraces the Schigomycetes, Zygomycetes, and Oomycetes. liaben- 
horst's "Krypogamen Flora v. Deutsclilaiul u. s. w., Pilze," has 
reached parts 27 and 28, being the hist contribntion from the lamented 
Winter. Part 27 completes t)ie Sphaeriacefe and includes the small 
sub-order Dothideacea'. Part 28 commences the Hysteriacese and em- 
braces the families Hysterineaj, Hypodermia?, and Dichaenace*. 
" Cooke's Illustrations of British Fungi" has now reached parts 46 to 48. 

Martin's "Enumeration and Description of tiie Septorias of Is'orth 
America" ( Journ. Mic, in) iucludesone hundred and eighty-eight species 
of Septoria, eight of Pleospora, twenty of Rhabdospora, and eight of 
Phlycta3na. He also gives a convenient index to the species and a list 
of the host-plants. "The Synopsis of North American Species of 
Xylaria and Poronia," by Ellis and Everhart {I.e., ill), describes thirty 
species of Xylaria and two species of Poronia. The same authors have 
a "Synopsis of the North American Species of Hapoxylon and Num- 
mularia {I. c, iv). Phillips' "Manual of British Discoraycetes," recently 
published as a volume of the International Scientific Series, will be 
useful to American as well as English students, as many of the species 
described are common to both countries. The work describes nine 
orders, forty-nine genera and about six hundred species. The genus 
Phleospora has been monographed by Berllase (Nuov. Giorn. Bot. et al., 
XX), who makes out about one hundred and five sjiecies, and DeToni 
(Rev. Mycol., July, 1887) has a "Revisio Monographica Geasteris e. 
Tribu Geasteromycetum." Tie recognizes forty-eight species, and Mor- 
gan, who reviewed the paper in Am. Nat., xxi, describes two additional 
species from Nebraska. "Les Hymenomycetes D'Europe,"by Potouil- 
lard, is also a valuable work. As this is the first volume of "Materi- 
aux pour L'Historie des Champignons," it is devoted to general 
anatomy and classification. 

Of exsicati, Ellis' " North American Fungi" has reached centuries 
20 and 21, and Roumeguere's "Fungi select! exiscati praecepue Gallise 
et Algerese" has passed through centuries xlii-xlv. 

Fallow and Trelease have done a most valuable work in compiling 
"A list of Works on North American Fungi," which is issued by the li- 
brary of Harvard College. The report of the botanist of the State of 
New York, Peck, in "Fortieth Ann. Rept. N. Y. State Mus. Nat. Hist, 
for 188G," contains descriptions of about forty new species. 

As it is impossible to attempt anything like a complete enumeration 
of all the work that has been done, the following list of articfes that 
have appeared in American periodicals, with a few of the more im- 
l)ortant foreign papers, will convey some idea of its magnitude. The 
following have appeared in the Journal of Micology from July, 1887, to 
June, 1888: Calkins, "Notes on Florida Fungi; " Ellis and Everhart, 
" New Kansas Fungi, Additions to Hypocreacete, New Species of Fungi 
from various localities. New Iowa Fungi, Additions to Ramularia;"

DISEASES OF PLANTS. 

In speaking of the fungus diseases of plants under a separate head- 
iua- the impression should not be conveyed that they differ from fungi 
iu L^eneral. It is simply a conyenient way of treating of those lorins 
that are especially injurious to cultiyated plants. The extent of the 
annual injury done to agricultural interests by the attacks ot parasitic 
funoi is little appreciated by the community at large. Eyen when it 
is miderstood that the injury is caused by parasitic plants, so little is 
known of their nature and conditions of growth that no very effectne 



488 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

remedial measures can be employed against them. It is only by care- 
fully studying their life history that methods of i)revention or cure (^an 
be suggested. Various governments, but especially those of France 
and the United States, have undertaken systematic investigations of 
the life history of the injurious forms. Prof. P. Viala, as the represent- 
ative of French interests, has visited this country and studied the 
wild grapes and the various fungi found affecting them. 

The section of vegetable pathology of the U. S. Department of Agri- 
culture, Under Prof. F. Lamson Scribner, has accomplished valuable 
work in this direction. His report (Ann. Rep. Dept. Ag., 1887), which 
embraces about seventy-live pages, is illustrated by seventeen plates, 
and deals with the diseases of the vine, the potato blight and rot, straw- 
berry-leaf blight, apple scab, rust of beets, leaf rust of cherry, plum, 
l)each, etc., cotton-leaf blight, anthracnose of the raspberry and black- 
berry, smut of Indian corn, corn rust, etc. The Department has also 
issued a Bulletin (No. 5) containing a report on experiments made in 
1887 on the treatment of the downy mildew and black rot of the grape- 
vine. In a former Bulletin (Xo. 2) the life history of these highly de- 
structive parasites had been treated, and in this, the best method for 
controlling them are described and discussed. 

" Les Maladies de la Vigne" is the title of a large work by Professor 
Viala. A long list of species is enumerated, among which one hundred 
and fifty species are regarded as accidental, one hundred as saprophytic, 
and twenty-five as parasitic. The larger portion of the work is devoted 
to a few well-known destructive forms, such as Peronospora viticola, 
Oidhmi Tnclteri., etc. " Le Black Rot et le Couiotherium diplodiella" 
is a well-written pamphlet of eighty pages by Viala and Ravaz. M. 
Priellieux (Compt. Rend., cv) has an article on the grape disease 
[Conotherimn dijylodiella). He concludes that it is a true x^arasite. 
Gasperini (Atti Tosc. Soc. Sci. Nat.tViii) describes a new disease of 
lemons, a species of Aspergillus. Vuillemin (Morot's Journ. Bot., i) 
writes of the ''Disease affecting cherry and plum trees." The disease 
of tomatoes {Dacfylium roscum, var.,) is described by W. G. Smith in 
Gard. Chron., August, 1887. "A new fungus disease of the vine" is 
characterized by Scribner and Viala in Agricult. Sci., September, 1887. 
The species is uamed Greeneria fulginea, and is both saprophytic and 
parasitic. It is reported to be very destructive to fruit in some parts 
of North Carolina. " The curl of peach leaves" is described by Knowles 
in Bot. Gaz., xii. 

LICHENS. 

The much-needed help to the study of the North American Lichens has 
been furnished by Willey's "Introduction." Although a pamphlet of 
only fifty-eight pages, it contains chapters on the collecting and mount- 
ing of Lichens ; on their structure and organs; their geographical dis- 
tribution. There is a key to the seventy-six genera, enumerated as in- 



BOTANY. 489 

linbitaiits of North Amorica, and also a list of all the species, with an 
iiulicatioii ol' their liahitat. The: work is acicompanied by ten i)lates, 
illustrating the spores of each genus as well other parts, such as 
gonidia, apotheceine, spermogones, i)yenides, etc. The much-discussed 
quest ion of the autonomy of Li(;hens still remains a mooted point. Thus 
Willey, in the above paper, concludes that ''for the present and for 
practical purposes the Lichen remains a Lichen," while Forssell, "Beitr. 
z. Kennt. d. Anatomic u. Systematic d. Gloeslichtenen" (Nov. Act. Reg. 
Soc. S(;ient. tlpsal, vili), describes a new family of the class Ascolicheus 
with the goiiidia belonging to the Chroococcacetc, and Massee (Phil. 
Trans., CLXXViii), under the name Gastrolichens, describes a form pro- 
duced by the union of a fungus belonging to the order Trichogastres 
with a uni cellular alga. Moller has furnished the results of the culti- 
vation of Lichen-forming Ascomycetes without algre (Unters. Bot. 
Inst. k. Akad, IMunster-in-Westfalen, 1887). Kecognizing the fact that 
light on this subject can only be obtained by cultivating gonidia alone 
or synthetically combining spores and gonidia, he has turned his atten- 
tion to the culture of spores. Contrary to the common statement that 
hyphai coming from germinating Lichen spores necessarily die in a short 
time if gonidia are not supplied, he found that if germinated in a suit- 
able culture medium the hyphre produced " small characteristic 
thalli without any trace of gonidia whatever." These he had at the 
time of writing kept alive three months, and although they had not 
produced apothecia tliere were indications that these were being 
formed. He also concluded that the spermatia are not male reproduc- 
tive organs, as has been supposed by some. 
Of the shorter papers Willey has described a new species (Dermatiscum 

Cafmcbanse) from (Torr. Bull., xiv) ; Knowlton has enumerated 

(Bot. Gaz. XIII) several species found attached to some of the stone idols 
lately brought to the U. S. National Museum from the Easter Islands, 
and Eckfeldt and Calkins have published a "Lichen Flora of Florida" 
(Journ. ]\[icology's, III), enumerating three hundred and thirty species, a 
few of which are new. Bonnier's "La Constitution des Lichens" (Journ» 
d. Botanique, 1887) is an interesting paper. 

HEPATIC^. 

The distribution of the Italian species of Hepaticfe is considered by 
Massalongo (Atti Congr. Naz. Bot. Critt., Parma, September, 1887), and 
Underwood has written of some undescribed forms from California 
(Bot. Gaz., xiii). He describes tive species that had been sent by Bo 
lander in 18G6 to Dr. Gottsche but were never published. Goebel has 
an interesting i)aper (Ann. Jard. Bot., Buitenzorg, vii), in which he 
describes some curious appliances for storing water in the ei)iphytic 
JungermanniciC of Java. Trabus has a paper in Eev. Bryol., 1887, 
'^Mousses et IIepati(iues nouvelles d'Algerie." 



490 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

MOSSES. 

Of tlie larger systematic works Braith wait's " British Moss Flora" 
lias reached part x, completing- volume i, and Eabeuhorst's " Cr3^i)to- 
gamen-FIora v. Deutschland u. s. w." has reached numbers 7 and 8, 
being still occupied with the Acrocarpa^ Both of these publications 
still maintain the uniform high character of the earlier parts. Philibert 
has a short paper (Rev. Bryol., xiv) on the fructification of Grimmia 
Hartmanni, in which he concludes that it should be placed among the 
true Grimmia and near to G. contorta Wahl, The same author has 
also another pai)er (/. c.) " Contrib. -X la flora mycologique de la Grece. 
Arcaugeli (Atti Soc. Tosc, Nat., v) states that a useful character for 
some species of moss '■ can be drawn from the fact that in some forms 
the nervation of the leaves ends in a small projecting point or tooth 
and in addition to this presents another small tooth pointing downwards 
below the opical tooth." Species of lihyncosiegium, and Bravhythecium 
are enumerated. Several hybrid mosses are described by Sanio (Hed- 
wigia, xxvi), and the "Anatomy and Development of the Sporostegium 
of Mosses," by Vaizey in Journ. Linn. Soc, Lond., xxiv. In the " Sphag- 
nacete of North America" (Bull. Soc. roy. de Bot. Belgique, xxy), 
Oardot proposes some changes in our species. He admits sixteen 
species and nine varieties as compared with twenty seven species in 
Lesquereux and James' " Manual." "Die Entwick.d. Sporogone v. An- 
dreie u. Si)hagnum," by Waldner, is a valuable contribution to our 
knowledge of the development of the sporogonium of these genera, and 
the paper is further enriclied by systematic notes by Miiller. Varia- 
tions in ^S^^/mY/Mf/e^^i-t' are described by Jansen (Kev. Bryol, xiv). 

FERN-ALLIES. 

Baker's " Hand-book of the Fern-Allies " is by far the most valuable 
contribution that has appeared during the year on the systematic study 
of the related members of the Ptoridophyta. It is similar in its method 
of treatment to the author's well-known " Synopsis Filicum." It in- 
cludes descriptions of 565 species, distributed at follows : Equisetacecv^ 
20 species ; Lycopodiacea', 98 species; distributed among Fhylloglossnra, 
1, Lyeopodium, 94 ; Tmesipteris, 1 : Fsilotum, 2 ; Selaginellacew, 383 
species, of which Selagmella has 334, and Isoetes, 49 ; Bliizocarpew, 64 
species, distributed among Salvinia, 13 ; Asolla, 5 ; MarsilUa, 40, and 
Pilularia, 6. 

In the Equicetacew Buchtien has given a short paper (Uhlworm u. 
Haenlein Biblioth. Bot., viii), in which he points out the diflerence be- 
tween the male and female prothalli. " Some words ou the life-history 
of Lycopods" (Ann. Bot., i) by Treub, is a suggestive paper. He has 
studied the prothalli of four species before unknown, of which number 
three belong to the Phlegmaria type, and one to the cernuuni type. 
The annotinum type, the third into which Lycopodium is divided, is still 



BOTANY. 491 

imperfectly known. Tliis genus, as is well known, played an important 
part in past geological time, and the modern forms are seemingly but 
poor representations, but as Treub suggests, it is more than probable 
that when the life-history of each form is made out some important gen- 
eralizations in connection with what is known of the fossil form will be 
possible. Goebel is also working in similar lines and hns recently de- 
scribed (Bot. Zeitg., XLV) the prothallium of L. imuulatiim, confirming 
previous observations that it belongs to the cernuum type. 

The genus Jsocfes which is generally much neglected by botanists is 
treated geographically by Underwood (Bot. Gaz., xiii). It embraces 
fifty-three well-marked species of world-wide distribution. Europe has 
thirteen species -, Africa, ten ; Asia, six ; Australia, eight ; South Amer- 
ica, six ; and North America, nineteen species, two of which are here 
described as new. 

FERNS. 

About the usual annual amount of work seems to have beeu done on 
the ferns without, however, producing anything of particular moment. 
Bower (Trans. Linn. Soc, Lond., 2d ser., ii) has described and dis- 
cussed at considerable length the discovery of apospory in ferns. This 
phenomenon, which is simply a transition by direct vegetative process, 
and without the assistance of spores, from the sporophore to the oophore, 
was first defined by Priugsheim and Stahl in 187G, but has only recently 
been detected in ferns. Goebel (Ann. Jard. Bot., Buitenzorg, vii) , has 
given a long paper describing the germination of several little-known 
species, among them Vittaria, Trichomanes, and liymenophijUum. The 
same author has a paper, " Ueb. kiinstliche Vergriindung d. Sporo- 
phyll V. OnocleaStruthiopteris" (Ber. deutsch. Bot. Gesell.,iV) describ- 
ing the conversion of fertile sporophylls of Onodea into barren green 
fronds. The development of the sporangium of the Polypodiaceae is 
described by Kiindig (Hedwigia, xxviii), and the " Dehisence of the 
Sporangium of Adiautum pedatum," by Miss Lyon (Torr. Bull., xiv). 
Campbell's paper "On the development of the Ostrich Fern Ouoclea 
Struthioptoris" (Mem. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., iv) is a very carefully 
prepared paper on the histology and development. 

Baker has given several descriptive papers : "A further collection of 
ferns from West Borneo." (Journ. Linn. Soc, Lond., xxiv); '• On a col- 
lection of fernsfrom San Domingo" (Journ. Bot., xxvi), in which several 
new species are characterized. Beddome has a short paper enumerating 
a collection made in Perak and Penang (Journ. Bot., xxvi), and Forbes, 
(/. c.) has described a single new species {Polypodium Annabella') from 
New Guinea. Nephrohpifi acuta is reported from the vicinity of Miami 
Eiver, Fh'rida, by Holden (Torr. Bull., xiv). Rabenhorst's " Kryp- 
togamen Flora v. Deutschland u. s. w." has reached parts 8 to 10 of 
the vascular cryptogams. It completes the Polypodiacea' and includes 
descriptions of the German species of Osmund iacew, Ophioglossacew 



492 RECORD OF SCIENCK FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

and RMzocarpea\ and conmieucea the Uquisetacea'. Each species is care- 
fully illustrated. Underwood's "Our Ferns and their Allies" has now 
reached a third edition. It describes about one hundred and sixty-five 
species and several varieties of ferns as native of North America, north 
of Mexico. One of the most important additions to the " fern-allies" is 
the genus Salvinia reported from Missouri. 

ANTHOPHYTA. 

The number of papers of more or less magnitude that have appeared 
during the year are very great, and considerably in excess of the pro- 
duction of most former years. In America, while most of the papers 
have been short, many of them are of' considerable value. 

The most extensive papers have been numbers xiv and xvof Watson's 
" Contributions to American Botany." The first of these, issued in 
1887, is largely taken up with a list of the plants selected by Dr. Ed- 
ward Palmer in the State of Jalisco, Mexico, in 1886. The GamopetaJce 
were determined by Dr. Gray; the Jimcacaccv and Cypcraeea'. by Britton ; 
the Graniinew by Vasey, and the Filices, bj" Eaton. The whole collec- 
tion includes about six hundred and seventy-five species, with a consid- 
erable proportion of species new to science. The last part ot the paper 
contains descriptions of over forty new species of American plants from 
various localities. Part XV, issued May, 1888, contains an enumeration 
of new American plants with revisions of Losqnerella (old Vesicaria) 
and of the North American species of Draha. Of Braba, thirty-two 
species and several varieties are described. It also contains descrip- 
tions of over fifty new species of Mexican plants, chiefly collected by 
Pringle in the mountains of Chihuahua, and descriptions of a few plants 
of Guatemala. Gray's last paper, which was presented to the Academy 
of Arts and Sciences after his death, by Watson, consists of notes upon 
the Rntacew and Vitaoco', the study of which he had taken up immedi- 
ately on his return from his last European trip. 

The Smithsonian Institution has issued a second edition of Gray's 
" Synoptical Flora of North America," Gamopetalcv^ which forms vol- 
ume XXXI of its Miscellaneous Collections. In this form it is distribu- 
ted to libraries and institutions of learning in all parts of the world, 
as well as to many of its private correspondents, to whom it is known 
that it would be of special value. 

Of the foreign works Hillebrand's "Flora of the Hawaiian Islands " is 
one of the most extensive and valuable. Insular floras have always a 
peculiar interest, and " lew are more interesting than the Hawaiian 
Islands. " The work describes 844 species of Phanerogams, belonging 
to 335 genera, and 155 Pteridophytes, representing 80 genera, being a 
total of 099 species. Of this number it is thought that 115 si)ecies have 
been introduced since the discovery by Captain Cook in 1779, and 24 
species by natives before this time. There remains 8G0 species as 
original residents, of which nuu;ber 053, or over 75 per cent., are endemic. 



BOTANY. 493 

About 250 of these endemic species belong to endemic genera. Of the 
dicotyledons more than 85 per cent, of these species are endemic. The 
"Flora Miqiielonenis," by M. M. Delamare, Eenauld, and Cardot is 
another insular flora. The Island of Miquelon, which is just oft' the 
south shore of Newfoundland, has been very carefully explored and the 
results here ijresented. About 46 per cent, of the species observed are 
American. Mueller still continues his indefatigable labors on the Aus- 
tralian flora. His " Iconography of Australian species of Acacia and 
cognate genera" has reached decade 11 and is similar iu appearance to 
his well-known ''Eucclyptographia." Forbes and Hemesle}' have inaugu- 
rated a most valuable work, ''An Enumeration of all the plants known 
from China proper, Formosa, Hainan, Corea, the Luchu Archipelago, 
and the Island of Hong Kong, together with their distribution andsyn- 
onomy." It is published in the Jour. Linn. Soc, Lond., and has now 
reached part V, taking it through the Compositse. The " Botany of the 
Eoraima Expedition of 1884," by F. im Thurn, assisted by Oliver, Rid- 
ley, Baker, and others (Trans. Linn. Soc, Lond., 2d ser., ii), is another 
valuable paper. It enumerates three genera and fifty-three species 
new to science. Of similar scope is the " Enumeration of the plants 
collected by Mr. H. H. Johnston on the Kilima-Najaro expedition of 
1884," by Oliver and other of the officers of the Kew Herbauium, and 
the " Botany of the Afghan Delimitation Commission," by Aitchison, 
both of which appear in Trans. Linn. Soc, Lond., 2d ser., ii. King's 
" The species of Ficus of the Indo-Malayan and Chinese countries" is 
a magniflcent contribution, in two large volumes, to our knowledge of 
the perplexing genus Ficus. Over two hundred species are described 
and two hundred and twenty-five plates devoted to their illustration. 
The synonomy, distribution, etc, are very completely presented. The 
continuation of De Candolle's Prodromus, under the title of ''Mono- 
grapheiTB Phanerogamarum," still progresses. The present volume by 
Planchon is devoted to the Ampelidese. In the volume of the "Pro- 
dromus," issued iu 1824, that contained the Ampelideaj, only one hun- 
dred and eight species were known, while the present monograph in- 
cludes three hundred and ninety species. Some of the radical changes 
in nomenclature proposed by Planchon are not likely to meet with uni- 
versal acceptance. The paper " Serjania Sapindacearum Genus mono- 
graphica descriptum," by Radelkofer (Trans. Roy. Bav. Acad., 1875) is 
now supplemented by two hundred pages and nine plates. 

" Biologia Centrali-Americana," by Hemsley, has reached part xxii ; 
the "Flora of British India," by Hooker, has reached part xiv, com- 
pleting the Euphorbiacai; and the "Flora Italiana" of Parlatore, con- 
tinued by Caruel, has reached vol. vii. Of Hooker's " Icones Plantarum," 
l)arts i-iii, vol. VIII, have appeared during the year. Each contains 
twenty-five plates of new or little known species. 

The shorter American notes and papers have been exceedingly 
numerous. We may mention the following: 



494 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

"New or rare plants," by Dr. Gray (Bot. Gaz., xiii), is the best con- 
tribution of the Nestor of American botany. It enumerates only four 
species. The Botanical Gazette, xii, has an account of "An excnrsion 
to the Platte," by Thompson ; " Proteogyne in Datura meteloides," by 
Schneck; " Fertilization of Calopogon parviflorus," by Robertson. Vol. 
XIII contains " Notes on North American willows," by Bebb ; " Notes 
on the Flora of James Bay," by Macoun ; "A New Water Lily" [Castalia 
Leihergi) from the Northwest; "Phacelia heterosperma, u. sp.," by 
Parish ; " Notes on Carex, No. ix," by Bailey ; " Notes on some Illinois

North Carolina," by Memminger ; " Notes on Western Umbellifera'," by 
Coulter and Eose; "Erigeron Tweedyi, n. sp.," from Southwestern Mon- 
tana, by Canb}^ ; " Undescribed Plants from Guatemala," by Smith. 

The Torry Bulletin, vol. xiv, contains many articles. Among them 
are " Bibliographical notes on well-known plants," by Green ; " A 
supposed new genus of Anacardiacete {iSycocarpus),'^' by Britton, "The 
Genera Echinocystis Migarrhiza and Echinopepou," by Watson; "A 
new variety of Aralia nudicauU i.," by Apgar ; " Note on Sarracenia 
variolaris," by Pierce; vol. xv, contains the following: 

" Sherardia arvensis," by Meehan ; " Eemarks on the Group Caro- 
lineaj of the genus Eosa," by Best, describes Eosa humilis Marshall, and 
the varieties lucida and villosa ; " Studies in the Typhacefe," by Morong; 
" Ee-discovery of Nymphcca clegans, Hook., by Stearns, reports this 
beautiful species from Waco, central Texas, where it has remained 
unique since it was first collected by Wright in 1849 ; " New or Note- 
worthy North American Phanerogams," by Britton ; and Bebb has an 
article on " White Mountain Willows." 

A number of pai)ers on grasses and cyperacea^ have appeared, of which 
we may mention " Grasses of North America for Farmers and Stu- 
dents," by W. J. Beal. It contains chapters " on the structure, form, 
and develojjment of the grasses, power of motion, plant growth, classi- 
fication, native grazing lands, grasses for cultivation, early attempts to 
cultivate grasses, testing seeds, grasses for pastures and meadows, 
j)reparatiou of the soil, care of grass land, etc." It will be followed by 
a second volume, which will contain descriptions of the North American 
species. Flint's well-known " Grasses and Forage Plants," has been 
revised and a new edition published during the year. Vasey has papers 
on "Eedfleldia, a New Genus of Grasses," "New Western Grasses," and 
" New or Eare Grasses," in Torr. Bull., and a " Synopsis of the Genus 
Panicum," in Bot. Gaz., xiii. Scribner has notes on " New or Little- 
known Grasses," in Torr. Bull., xv, and Beal on " The Eootstocks of 
Leersia and Muhlenbergia," in Am. Nat., xxii. Websteria, a new genus 
in Cyperac€(V.j is described by Wright (Torr. Bull., XV), from Valusia 
County, Florida. The plant is entirely submerged. 

The American Naturalist has short articles, by Bessey, on " The East- 
ward Extension of Finus ponderosa^ var, scorimlormn,^^ " The West^ru

Extension of the Black Walnut," "Still another Tumble-weed {Cyclo- 
doma platyphylhim),'''' nud the "Grass Flora of the Nebraska Plains." 
Also a uote on "An Overlooked Function of Many Fruits." He thinks 
that the "greening" of young fruits, such as those of Ulmus, Negundo, 
etc., is to aid in the development of the embryo, since at the time when 
it is forming there are no leaves. The American Naturalist has also a 
long paper on "Evolution in The Plant Kingdom," by Coulter, and a 
note by Ed. Palmer on "The Eflect on Vegetation of the Variable Rain- 
fall of Northwest Mexico." Sturtevant has continued his notes on the 
" Origin of Garden Vegetables." 

Parry (Bull. Cal. Acad. Sci., ii) has a valuable paper on the California 
Meuzanetas, "A partial revision of the Uva-urse section of the genus 
Arctoetaphylos," as represented on the North American Pacific coast. 
He enumerated thirteen species, of which one is extra limital, and sev- 
eral are either new or newly characterized. Curran {op. cit.) has a note 
on the "Priority of Dr. Kellogg's Genus Marah over Megarrhiza." 

Pittonia is the name of a botanical publication that has been begun 
by Edward Lee Green, ot the University of California. It consists of 
a series of papers, usually short, devoted mainly to Western plants, 
descriptions of new species, critical notes, etc. Following is a list of 
the most important articles: No. 1, "Some West American species 
of Trifolium ; " " Some West American Asperifolese ; " " The species of 
Zauscheria ; " "A New Genus of Asteroid Compositic {Hazzardia) j " 
"New Species, mainly California." No. 2, "A Curious Collinsia;" 
"Some West American Asperifolea;, ii;" "Miscellaneous Species, 
New or Rare ; " "A Botanical Excursion to the Island of San Miguel ; " 
" Catalogue of the Flowering Plants of the Island of San Miguel." No. 
3, " West American Phases of the Genus Polentilla ; " " Some Ameri- 
can Polemoniacefe ; " " New or Noteworthy Species;" " Echiuocystis

"New Species from Mexico;" "New or Noteworthy Species, ii;" 
"Botanical Literature, Old and New ; " " The Botany of Cedros Island ; " 
" List of Cedros Island Plants;" " On Some Species of Dodecathion." 

The shorter foreign papers have also been exceedingly numerous, 
but only a few of them can be mentioned: Baker's "Synopsis of Til- 
audsi.e " was continued into 1888, and completed in the June number of 
the Jonrn. Bot. Two hundred and forty-one species are enumerated, 
a. large proportion of which are new to science. Dietz (Abhandl. Na- 
turwiss. Ver., Bremen, ix) has investigated Sparganium and Typha, and 
concludes that that they should be placed under distinct families; 
Sparyanium having nearest aflinities to the Pandanacew and Ty2)ha to 
the Aroidew. Hooker has described, under the name of EydrofhrLv, a 
remarkable new genus of Fontederiaeew (Ann. Bot., i). Ridley (Journ. 
Linn. Soc, Loud., xxiv) describes a new genus of Orchidaccw from the 
Island of St. Thomas, West Africa. Ward's article on "Fruits and 
Seeds of Bhamnus (Ann, Bot., i) is devoted to an investigation of the

sources of coloring- matter iu certain species. "A Second Series of New 
Species of Ficus from New Guiuea," aud " Some New Species of Ficus 
from Samatra," by Kiug (Journ. Asiatic Soc, Bengal, lvi), are addi- 
tions to tbe great work on Ficus mentioned before. Huxley has an 
interesting paper (Journ. Linn. Soc, Lond., xxiv) on Gentians, their 
variations, relationships, etc. Ito (o^). cit.) has described a curious spe- 
cies of Behmophora new to the Japanese tiora. " The Nomenclature of 
Nymphica " is reviewed by Brittin (Journ. Bot., xxvi). It is shown that 
the species of Nymphcm^ Smith, 1808-'()9, must be transferred to Cas- 
talia, Salisbury, 1805, and the species of Nuphar, Smith, 1808-'09= 
Nymphfva, Salisbury, 1805. Bennett has an account of the British 
species of Epilohium (Trans. Bot. Soc. Ediub., xvii). Twelve sjjccies 
and several forms are enumerated. 



ANTHROPOLOGY FOR 1887 AND 1888. 



By Otis T. Mason. 



INTRODUCTION. 

The record of progress in anthropology during the years 1887 and 
1888 includes publications of general and of special significance. For 
The sake of convenience, following the suggestion of Dewey in his deci- 
mal classification of knowledge, this summary will commence with the 
eucyclopiedic portion of anthropology. To render this portion more 
easy of reference, the following order may be observed : 

(0) General treatises, including addresses, courses of lectures, bibli- 
ographies, dictionaries, encyclopaedias, collections of materials for study, 
general discussions, classifications of anthropology. 

(1) Societies, their history, scope, and enterprises, and a list of their 
publications. 

(2) Journals, proceedings, transactions, organs of associated bodies. 

(3) Periodicals, like the Revue d'Anthropologie, etc., devoted to the 
subject of anthropology at large. 

(4) Congresses, caucuses, general assemblies for some special occa- 
sion, Comptereudus. 

(5) Laboratories and apparatus of research, in which the whole ground 
is covered. Special laboratories, such as Francis Galton's, for socio- 
logical inquiries, or Wuudt's, in psycho-physics, should be described 
under their appropriate head. 

(G) Museums and collections. A properly arranged account of all 
collections, with their specialties, would save much tiresome hunt and 
enlarge the results of our work. 

(7) Galleries or collections of anthropological illustrations. Little 
has been done to perfect this side of anthropology. 

(8) Libraries, catalogues of books on anthropology, clieck-lists, and 
similar devices for ready reference, classifications of books. 

(9) Instructions to collectors. 

Works on the general subject of the natural history of man have been 
published in the two years covered by this summary by Ilerr Schaafi- 
hausen, Serrurier and dc (^uatrefages, Hovelacque and Herve, Canes- 
triui, Friedrich Ratzel, Johannes Rauke, O. T. Mason, J. Lippert, E. 
Morselli, and Sayce.

498 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

There is as yet no catalogue or list of anthropological societies avail- 
able. The greatest journals, such as Archiv, Correspondeuz-Blatt, 
Kevue d'Anthropologie, and Archivio, furnish each resumes of meetings 
held and of work done, which might be easily combined into a general 
directory. It is understood that Mr. Heury Phillips, of Philadelphia, 
will undertake a work of this kind for our own country. 

The journals and kindred publications of societies, periodicals pub- 
lished for subscription, and Comptes-rendus of societies, fall into the 
same general scheme, and may be considered together. There is a 
growing desire for information about what the world is doing in this 
most interesting of all sciences. In spite of all that has been said or 
may be said, there will always be most excellent treatises printed in out- 
of the-way places. Friendshii), and the good prices paid by popular 
magazines, will allure good material away from its legitimate home. 
Nevertheless, with our present system of bibliographical appendices, a 
few publications can be mentioned that unitedly include about all that 
is worthy of notice.

In our own country there are but two cities where the whole ground 
of anthropology is sought to be covered, Cambridge and Washington. 
In the former city the Peabody Museum, re-enforced by the library of 
Harvard University and the lectures delivered under its auspices, occu- 
pies all the fields of research. In Washington the Congressional Li- 
brary^ the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum^ the Army 



ANTHROPOLOGY. 499 

Medical Museum, the Library of tlie Surgeon-General, with its Index- 
Catalogue and the Index Medicus ; the Bureau of Ethnology, and the 
Anthroiudogical Society of Washington, not to speak of a dozen other 
contributory departments and bureaus; all these, taken together, fur- 
nish a band of workers, a body of material, and a series of publications 
that will compare favorably with those of London, Paris, and Berlin. 

There are museums, societies, and other means of study in Salem, 
Worcester, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cincinnati, St. Louis, 
Davenport, Milwaukee, and San Francisco not to be overlooked. Dr. 
Brintou, of Philadelphia, was the first anthropologist in our country to 
bear the title of professor in a regular university. 

The State historical societies are all more or less busy in gathering 
the material for local history. 

Among foreign resources of study, in addition to the old societies 
now approaching manhood's years, a fact worthy of special notice is 
the establishment at Leyden, under favorable auspices, of the Interna- 
tionales Archiv., devoted especially to the interchange of information 
and courtesies between museums. The editor, Mr. J. D. E. Schmelz,has 
been very active in gathering summaries of information about many 
public collections. 

Under the head of congresses must be included the anthropological 
section of the American Association, of the British Association, of >the 
French Association, the German AUgemeiue Versammlung der deutscheu 
Gesellschaft fiir Anthropologic, Ethnologic und Urgeschichte, the Con- 
gres des Americanistes, and the International Congress of Anthropol- 
ogy and Prehistoric Archaeology, 

A systematic bibliography of anthropology has not yet been at- 
tempted. The nearest approach to the subject is the Smithsonian sum- 
maries and the lists given in the German Archiv. Excellent special 
lists will be noticed under their appropriate heads, which, if brought 
together, would nearly complete the work. It is to be hoped that all 
bibliographers will adopt the order and plan pursued by the authors of 
the Index-Catalogue of the Surgeon-General's Library. This would avoid 
confusion in transferring titles from one work to another. For instance, 
Fauvelle (Dr.) Des causes d'erreur en anthropologic. Bull. Soc. d'an- 
throi). de Par., 3. s., x, 203-275; or, in case of a published volume, Ho- 
velacque(Abel). Precis d'anthropologie(Bibliothequeanthropologique). 
Paris (1887), Delahaye et Lecroisnier, 365 pj)., 20 tigs. 8vo. 

In quoting from a magazine, journal, or other serial the order should 
be: (I) author; (2) title of extract; (3) journal, always abbreviated by 
the Surgeon-General's code; (4) town, publisher, series, volume, date, 
number of pages, maps, plates, and figures, and, finally the size. 

In giving the title of a i)riuted book the same order of author and title 
are to be observed. Then comes the place of publication, the date in 
l)arenthesis, the publisher, the pages, etc., as in extracts from journals. 
If there be more than one volume it is sometimes the plan to treat each

In the Bulletin of the Anthropological Society of Lyon, E. Chantre 
gives a list of the laboratories and public collections in Italy relating to 
man. (1887, 163-105.) 

There are already a number of excellent guide books for investiga- 
tors, but Dr. Emil Schmidt added one more, entitled Anthropologische 
Methodeu, Anleitung zum Beobachten und Sammeln liir Laboratorium 
und Keise. (Leipzig (188S). 333 p., tigs., Svo.) 

BIOLOGY OF MAN. 

Progress in human biology has been along many lines. The one most 
persistently followed is that supposed to lead to the source of the species. 
In the method of man's appearance on earth there are two sets of phe- 
nomena to be distinguished, the establishment of the fact of his origin 
and the proper answer to the question, How did this fact come to be. M. 
Topinard well states the latter case in the following words: Tliere are 
two general processes of evolution, the one by the transfiguration of 
species, according to Broca, the other by transformation, according to 
Darwin. Darwin's method is by natural selection, Lamarck's method is 
by adaptation to external circumstances of an organism stimulated by 
internal needs. 

The Pr6cis d'anthropologie of Hovelacque and Herve gives a fresh 
impetus to the polygenic theory of man's origin. The evolution theory 
is accepted, but men were evolved in more than one center and from 
more than one pair. This revived the suggestion made some years ago 
of two races of men originating at the north and the south-pole, respect- 
ively. The polygenic origin of our race is also advocated in M. Debierre's 



ANTHROPOLOGY. 501 

L'Hoinme avant I' Histoire. Following- up Professor Flower's attempt 
to siiinmoii tlio teeth as a witness to the various types of mankind, Dr. 
Fauvelle employs the dental system to teach the ancestral origin of our 
race. Indeed, there needs to be stated only the titles of a few important 
papers to show the many gates through which anthropogenists hope to 
enter the successful answer. Such, for instance, are " The morphological 
place of man in the mammalian series," by Paul Albrecht ; " The origin, 
races, and antiquity of man," by B. Platz ; "A new theory of heredity,", 
by C. Weigert; "The latest phases of heredity," by A. M. Selling ; "Can 
the existence of a tendency to change in the form of the skeleton of the 
parent result in the actuality of that change in the offspring," by W. 
Arbuthnot Lane ; " The modern theories of generation and heredity," 
by E. G. Balbiani; "The heredity of crime, alcoholism, etc.," byG. Al- 
geri ; "The history of transformism," by A. Giard ; " Origin of the fit- 
test," by E. D. Cope; " Evolution and creation," by J. H. Hardwicke; 
"Lessons upon man according to the doctrine of evolution," But the 
most nsefnl treatise upon this point is that of Dr. Topinard, the lecture 
of March 21, 1S88, before L'f]cole d'anthropologie, entitled, Les dernieres 
etapes de la genealogie de I'Homme, and published in Revue d'anthro- 
pologie in the month of May in the same year. 

In Nature (xxxvi, 2G8; 341) is reviewed one of the most thought in- 
spiring works that have come within our notice durmg the two years 
under consideration, Mr. G. J. JJomaine's paper before the Linnaau So- 
ciety (see also iSTineteenth Century, No. cxix, 1887, 59-80) on physiolog- 
ical selection. The author is entirely in harmony with Mr. Darwin 
about the intent and extent of natural selection as the iireserver of 
forms, but looks to other causes to create the variations to be selected 
and conserved. "If," says he, "variation should be such that while 
showing some degree of sterility with the parent form, it continues to 
be as fertile as before within the limits of the varietal form, it wonld 
neither be swamped by intercrossing nor die out on account of sterility." 
In human evolution of varieties there have been going on exactly such 
excluding forces, shutting off to inbreeding color, clan, caste, nation- 
ality, religion, and the like. A paper read by Dr. Burnett before the 
Washington Anthropological Society on the Melungeons in the south- 
ern Alleghanies is a case in point. Neither white nor black nor Indi- 
ans, these people live encysted, like the Basques of the Pyrenees and 
little contaminated by mixture. 

One of the first convictions of the elder anthropologists of the last 
century was that man comes within the domain of scientific considera- 
tion only so fast as we can api)ly to him processes of counting, weigh- 
ing, and tabulation. The progress of anthropometry has been along 
the lines of refined apparatus and the subjecting of new parts of the 
body to the metric processes. Anthropometry applied to the living 
also to a large extent replaces the measuring of the skeleton. Rate of 
growth, stature, size, weight, proportion, vigor, strength of muscle and 



502 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

breathing, persoual icleutity, these are the subjects of measures iunu- 
merable. Professor Hitchcock, of Amherst College, has published an 
anthropometric manual giving the average and physical measurements 
and tests of male college students and methods of securing them, pre- 
pared from the records of the department of physical education and 
hygiene in Amherst College in the years 1881-'82 and 188G-'87 inclu- 
sive. 

Mr. Francis Galton describes an anthropometric laboratory as a place 
where a person may have any of his various faculties measured in the 
best possible way at a small cost, and where duplicates of his measure- 
ments may be preserved as private documents for his own future use 
and reference. Such an institution would contain apparatus both of 
the simpler kind used for weighings and measuriugs and for determina- 
tions of chest capacity, muscular strength, and swiftness, and that of a 
more delicate description used in what is technically called psycho- 
physical research, for determining the efiSciency of each of the various 
senses and certain mental constants. Instruction might be afforded to 
those who wished to make measurements at home, together with infor- 
mation about instruments and the registration of results. An attached 
library would contain works relating to the respective influences of he- 
redity and nurture. These would include statistical, medical, hygienic, 
and other memoirs in various languages, that are now either scattered 
through our different scientific libraries or do not exist in any of them. 
Duplicates of the measurement but without the names attached would 
form a growing mass of material accessible to statisticians. 

From conversation with friends Mr. Galton gathers that the library 
might fulfill a welcome purpose in becoming a receptacle for biogra- 
phies and family records, which would be in two classes, the one to be 
preserved as private documents accessible only to persons authorized 
by the depositor, and the other as ordinary books, whether they were 
in manuscript or in print. (Nature, 1887, 112.) In addition to Galton's 
catalogue of apparatus, Fisher, Venn, Bloxam, and Sargent have pub- 
lished lists of apparatus, with directions. 

The philosophical instrument makers publish catalogues of anthro- 
pometric apparatus. These are applied to new sets of phenomena every 
year. Among the notable jiublications in this direction are Galton's 
paper on the head-growth of students at Cambridge; the weight of new- 
born children, by Farago ; relation of the hand to stature in Asiatics, 
by Mugnier ; reports on laboratory work, by Bloxam and Garson ; an- 
thropometric data based on the measurement of three thousand stu- 
dents, by Tuckerman ; child-growth, by Zeleuski, Lausberger, Chaille, 
Lorey, Tetherstou, and Stephenson, 

Coordinated with cranial measurements are cephalic measurements. 
Ever since Broca's day earnest efforts have been made to perfect this 
coordination. On the cephalic measurements in France have appeared 
Collignou's charts of the repartition of the index; C. Arbo has studied 



ANTHROPOLOGY. 503 

tlie saiue (luestioii in Norway, and A. Fallot publishes a note npon the 
index of the Provencals. 

With reference to the external characteristics of the human body, 
none attracts so much attention as color of the skin, hair, and eyes. 
Both in Germany and in France commissions have been appointed by 
the Government to report on Xhis subject. In certain lines of investi- 
gation this must lead to excellent results. Admitting that all varia- 
tions in our species are the composite result of a struggle between the 
environment and the species, it is incontrovertible that these changes 
will take place more rapidly at those points where the battle rages most 
fiercely, at the most exposed points, where sunlight and heat and actin- 
ism, where humidity and aridity, heat and cold, and the like have made 
their fiercest attacks upon us. The most eminent anthropologists have 
not been unmindful of this. DeCandolle, Pommerol, Hansen, Variot, 
Flinker, and Topinard, in many papers, have brought together the re- 
^ilts of the public inquiries and pointed out the way to better methods. 
Longevity is the subject of several publications that have api)eared. 
There are several factors which enter into the count of race vitality, 
namely, fecundity, longevity, and energy or vigor, both bodily and 
mental. There are vague accounts of long-lived individuals, but it is 
only recently that means have been adopted for verifying the state- 
ment as regards individuals and for reaching definite conclusions re- 
specting the life periods of races, communities, or peoi)les. 

M. Turquan and M. Tissandier have collected the statistics of macro- 
bians. Signor (^orradi and Signer Trussardi have written treatises on 
longevity in relation to history, to anthropology and hygiene. Other 
papers on the same subject have appeared by Ornstein, Humphrey, and 
Ledyard. On the subject of vigor Signor Zqja has investigated metLds 
of measuring the muscular force of various races. 

Further researches in this same line are the study of chest tvpes in 
man, the Mongolian eye, physiognomic, prehension,' right-handedness, 
erectness of posture, the senses of savages, bodily size and stature, vital 
statistics, the preservation of vigor, weight, hairiness, and baldness. 

There is a mooted question concerning the relative advantage of sav- 
agery and civilization as regards vitality. On May 24, 1888, George 
Harley read an essay before the London Anthropological Institute on 
the relative recuperative powers of man living in a rude, and man livii.o- 
inahighlycivilized, state, in which he brought forward a number o't' 
hitherto unpublished though mostly well known tiicts, demonstratino- 
that the refining influence of civilization had not been altogether the niP- 
alloyed boon we so fondly imagine it to have been. For the cases cited 
went far to demonstrate the fact that while man's physique as well as 
his mental power had increased during his evolution from a barbaric 
state into a condition of bienscance, his recuperative capacity, on the 
other hand, has materially deteriorated. In facr, it ai)pears from the ex- 
amples cited that every appliance adding to man's bodily comfort as 



504 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

well as every contrivance either stimulating or developing his mental 
faculties, while increasing his personal enjoyment, materially diminishes 
his animal vitality, rendering him less able to resist the effects of lethal 
bodily injuries, or recover from them as well and as quickly as his bar- 
baric ancestors, or his less-favored brethren. (Nature, 1887, p. 143.) 

The body in disease as well as in health may be interrogated about 
the origin of man and the methods of his physical history. Dr. Mat- 
thews writes about diseases among onr Indians; Max Bartels upon the 
rate of healing ; McKee and Tecce upon the results of cousin marriages. 
In the same direction are the studies of abnormal forms, monstrosities, 
such as microcephals. maternal impressions upon the offspring, platy- 
cnemism, ])ygmies, splanchnology, tailed men, the defective classes, su- 
pernumerary organs. 

This leads us to the anatomy of the cadaver and the examination of 
exhumed skeletons. The pelvis, the thorax, the long bones of the arm 
and of the leg, the scapula, the teeth, and other parts of the mouth, 
the nose, the orbit, have all been thoroughly studied by Kollet, Fau- 
A'elle, Collignon, Uertillon, Giacomini, Prochowiiick, Runge, Manou- 
vrier, Dwight, Eibbe, Pohlman, Harderup, Riccardi, Testut, Matthews, 
Beddoe, and Daubes. Upon these studies it is proposed to build a cor- 
rect account of our racial history and of our origin. 

But the great mass of anthropological anatomists still expend their 
labor upon the skull and the brain, separately and in relation to each 
other. Under cranial measurements and cranial indices consult the 
papers of A. B. Meyer, Sergi and Moschen, Sanson, Emil Schmidt, J.

PSYCHOLOGY. 

Following closely after biology and entangled with it beyond hope of 
extrication is the modern psychology, which within its proper area in- 
cludes many iuv^estigations into the origin of mind, the study of animal 
intelligence, of the faculties of the mind, of the diseases, abnormalities,

and idio.^yncrasies of mind, of unusual states of mind exhibited in 
ecstasy, liypnotism, and mind readin,;:? ; psycliophysics and the physical 
substratum of mental operations, and various other recondite problems 
not amenable to classification. 

The lirst series of investigation to consider relates to what Madame 
Clemence Royer calls L'evolution mentaledans la serieorganique. It has 
at present a si)eculative rather than ai)ractical manifestation. But the 
inquiry about the Unseen from which our spirits come and to which 
they return continues to excite the pens of such philosophers as Huxley, 
Gladstone, Du BoisReymond, Virchow, and Quatrefages. 

A more practical form of investigation is that which treats mentality 
as a branch of nature with its individual growths from the egg, in its 
genera and species, relation to environment, and so forth. And so we 
follow with pleasure and without embarrassment M. Pietrement in his 
study of hunting dogs, Romanes in his matchless studies in the intelli- 
gence of animals. Sir John Lubbock long ago conducted important in- 
vestigations along the same line, and the studies of Professor Cooke 
are still fresh in our memories. The most interesting query started by 
Lubbock inquires into the existence of other organs of sense than our?.. 
The natural history of intelligence, by which is meant the attempt to 
apply the study of origin, growth, development, chorology, etc., to 
mental processes has received great encouragement from the observa- 
tion of animals. In our own country George and Elizabeth Peckham 
have experimented on spiders and wasps, and in England Sir John Lub- 
bock published a volume on the senses, instincts, and intelligencie of 
animals, with special reference to insects. 

The genius of the investigation may be apprehended in the following 
paragraph : 

" We find in animals complex organs of sense, richly supplied with 
nerves, but the function of which we are as yet powerless to explain. 
Tiiere may be fifty other senses as different from ours as sound is from 
sight, and even within the boundaries of our own senses there may be 
endless sounds which we can not hear, and colors as difterent as red 
from green, of which we have no conception. These and a thousand 
other questions remain for solution. The familiar world which sur- 
rounds us may be a totally different place to other animals. To them 
it may be full of music which we can not hear, of sensations we can not 
conceive. To place stuffed birds and beasts in glass cases, to arrange 
insects in cabinets and dried plants in drawers, is merely the drudgery 
and preliminary of study ; to watch their habits, to understand their re- 
lations to one another, to study their instincts and intelligence, to as- 
certain their adaptations and their relations to the forces of nature, to 
realize what the world appears to them ; these constitute, as it seems 
to me, at least, the true interests of natural history, and may even give 
us the clue to senses and perceptions of which at present we have no 
concejition." 



506 RECORD OF SCIENCE EOR 1887 AND 1888. 

The faculties of the mind are studied iu the same iiiauner as the mind 
itself. The phenomena of consciousness and unconsciousness, of sensa- 
tion, of perception and apperception ; of instinct, memory, emotion, rtni- 
son, and volition in healthy exercise are taken up as so many rocks, or 
plants, or animals, and their natural history scrutinized. And this is 
true regardless of the metaphysical basis of the study ; the most pro- 
nounced materialists and spiritualists have caught the inspiring motive 
of the naturalist. In this line reference may be made to Wilbrand, 
Osterman, James, McCosh, Bowne, Dewey, Ladd, Burnham, Fere, 
Fouillee, Scliolz, ISTelson, Hall, and writers in Mind and other journals 
of psychology. 

Just as some of the richest results in mineralogy have been realized 
from tiie study of allotropism, in botany and zoology from abnormali- 
ties, so in mind study the utmost diligence is exercised in observing the 
phenomena of mental deformities and eccentricities. In the first num- 
ber of the American Journal of Psychology, William Jli^oyes discusses 
paranoia. Further researches in the same line are Eouth on overwork 
and premature mental decay, G. H. Savage on homicidal mania, Gris- 
som on the history and poetry of insanity, Tenchini on the brains of 
delinquents, Foy on idiosyncrasies, Stevenson on genius and mental 
disease, and Duval, Ploix, and Dally on aphasia. Indeed, both in 
France and Italy, congresses, societies, and journals are devoted to 
this side of anthropological research. 

The scientitic psychologist has pursued his researches still further. 
There have been hanging around the suburbs of knowledge many de- 
scendants of aboriginal philosophy. One of these oflspring is belief in 
the possibility of occult contact with the spirits of men and a spirit 
world of the dead. This whole subject, to study which the English So- 
ciety for Psychical Research was organized, is ably reviewed by Prof. 
Stanley Hall in tlie first number of the American Journal of Psychology 
(128-14G). He says: "Thus far not only the formation of such a soci- 
ety, but the boldness of its plan, with its committees on apparitions and 
haunted houses, and on the claims of Mesmer and Reicheubach, and the 
degree to which the difficulties and the dangers of the proposed inves- 
tigations were realized, were all such as to commend it not only toeverj^ 
psychologist, but to every true and intelligent friend of culture and re- 
ligion. While those who regard the baser forms of modern spiritualism 
as the refined and concentrated embodiment of all the superstitions of 
a remote and barbarous jjast, and the claims of those who pretend to 
mediate between the living and their friends who are dead as a name- 
less crime against the most sacred things of the soul, must feel a deep 
interest in such work, there is another class, perhaps still larger, and 
with an interest still deeper. This class consists of those who, in these 
days of unsettlement in religious beliefs, hope to find amid superabun- 
dant aherf/Iaube a nucleus of certainty for at least the doctrine of immor- 
tality. The most absolute idealists are not so satisfied with the specu- 



ANTHROPOLOGY. 507 

lative method which works by exhausting? thought possibilities as not 
to welcome the most empirical refutation of materialism and mechanism. 
Even Mr. Meyer's "phantasmagoric efficacy," his "telepathic percola- 
tion," or veritable ghosts of those dying or dead or even in great dan- 
ger, are not unwarrantable in establishing his "solidarity of life which 
idealism proclaims," or " the universal mind in which all minds are 
one." But the impartiality attainable in most fields of scientific research 
is impossible here. A rigorously unbiassed and yet an intelligent jury, 
could probably not be found in this country or in England, so many and 
subtle and remotely ancestral are tbe conscious, and far more the uncon- 
scious, prepossessions which enter like Schoi)enhauer'8 primacy of the 
will, making us all lynx-eyed to all that favors one side and bat-eyed for 
all that favors the other. It is this inexpungable bias, evolved from a 
state of savage superstition, which enters into our judgment and pre- 
vents a just critical estimate of evidence. Gurney's phantasms of the 
living, Sinnett's hypnotism in the Orient, Herter's discussion of the 
nature of hypnotism, such are the works that are coustantl}^ appearing 
upon this corner of anthropology. 

Psychology is now clearly within the area of anthropology, having 
its laboratories and instruments of precision, its systematic experiments 
and its organized corps of observation. Prof. G. Stanly Hall says, 
" Several departments of science have touched and enriched psychology, 
bringing to it their best methods and their clearest insights." Among 
those whose studies have contributed to this end are teachers of psy- 
chology in higher institutions of learning, biologists and physiologists; 
anthropologists who are interested in primitive manifestations of psy- 
chological laws; physicians who give special attention to mental and 
nervous diseases ; men who, like Mr. Galton, have applied more exact 
methods to the problem of human feelings, will, and thought. 

The establishment in our country of a journal devoted solely to 
psycho-physics is a noteworthy event, and the fact that Prof. G. Stnnley 
Hall will have charge of the American Journal of Psychology is a suf- 
ficient guaranty of its great scientific value. 

In the first number of this publication Dr. Lombard and Professor 
Jastrow both explain with great clearness the psycho-physic law and 
illustrate its operation. Professor Jastrow, in his pnper on star magni- 
tudes, very clearly explains the action of the psycho-physical law in the 
first number of the American Journal by referring to Bernouille's illus- 
tration of the distinction between the value and theemolument of money. 
The emolument, or pleasure-giving power, of an additional sum of money 
is shown to be the logarithm of the wealth of an individual. By widen- 
ing the conception of the wealth to the general one of a physical stim- 
ulus of any kind, and putting sensation in general for the particular 
sensation caused by an i!}crease in money, we have the psycho-physic 
law. For the particular illustration of this law Professor Jastrow com-

pjires the star inaguitiides as they have been arranged by means of the 
eye with the results of mechanical photometers. 

Some interesting experiments on the reciprocal influence of organs of 
sense have been recently made by Herr CJrbanschitsch, of Vienna. His 
general conclusion is that any sense-excitation has for result an increase 
of acuteuess of other senses. Thus sensations of hearing sharpen the 
visual perceptions. If colored plates are placed at such a distance that 
one can hardly distinguish the colors, and various sounds are then pro- 
duced, the colors become generally more distinct the higher the sounds. 
Similarly, one can, while a sound affects the ear, read words which one 
could not read before. Again, the ticking of a watch is better heard 
when the eyes are oi)en than when they are closed. Red and green in- 
crease auditive perceptions, but blue and yellow weaken them. Several 
musicians, however, were agreed that red, green, and yellow and blue 
caused an intensification of sound about one-eighth ; while violet had a 
weakening effect. Taste, smell, and touch are under like laws. Light 
and red and green colors increase their delicacy ; while darkness, blue 
and yellow diminish it. Under the influence of red and green, taste 
extends from the anterior border of the tongue to the whole surface. 
On the other hand, a strengthening of smell, taste, or touch exalts the 
other sensitive perceptions. Specially interesting is the reciprocal in- 
fluence of touch and the sense of temperature. If one tickle the skin 
with a hair and plunge the hand in hot water the tickling sensation 
ceases ; on the contrary, if the hand be placed in cold water and a part 
of the body tickled the temperature is felt more vividly. Herr LTrban- 
schitsch finds in this reciprocal action an explanation of supposed 
double consecutive sensations on excitation of one sense. (Nature, 1887, 
p. 157.) 

The two sources of information which are absolutely indispensable to 
the studentof psycho-physics are Wundt's "Physiologische Psychologic" 
and " Hall's American Journal of Psychology." In addition to these 
"Mind," " Brain," "PhilosophischeStudien" and "Pfliiger'sArchiv" are 
to be consulted. In our own country we have at Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity, in Professor Cattell's laboratory, in Philadeli)hia, in the Army Medi- 
cal Museum at Washington, apparatus for psycho-physical experiments. 
Works of eminent authority in this line of research must be sought 
under the names, Cattell, Cowles, Donaldson, Fauvelle, Gallon, Hall, 
Hodge, Hyslop, Jackson, Jastrow, Konig, Lombroso, Krauss, Kroner, 
Ladd, Lombard, Thompson, Vigna, Wolfe, and Wundt. 

In the study of mind many subsidiary and leading questions arise not 
included in any of the classes above noticed. Such would be the pa- 
per of G. J. Romanes on the mental differences of men and women, of 
Mantegazza, on psychic atavism, of Nicolas, upon automatism in volun- 
tary actions, and that most interesting discussion in Nature by Max 
M idler, Francis Galton, H. S. W^oitley, H. Pi(!ton, G. J. Romanes, and 
J. J. Murphy (xxxvi,28, 100, 101, 124, 125, 171, 172, 219), upon the pos

sibility Of thoughts Without words. The same question was raised some 
years ago iu the Anthropological Society of Washington, by Protessor 
Porter, of tlie Deaf Mute College. This correspondence is all printed 
as an appendix to "Three introductory lectures on the science ot 
thought" by Max Miiller. (London, 1888, 8vo.) 



ETHNOLOGY. 



What was previously said of psychology may be repeated concerning 
ethnology ; it is at bottom a biological science. That is, when we say 
"race" we ought to mean blood, not language, nor nationahty, nor a 
region of country, certainly not arts or institutions. 

It is true that the science includes all about a certain breed or stock ot 
mankind ; indeed, it is the anthropology of men taken by breeds. The 
ethnologist and the ethnographer are biologists to start with, but they 
cover the entire area of the namral history of man. The latter works 
out the anthropology of a siugle stock or breed. The latter is concerned 
with anthropology arranged with blood or consanguineous groups tor 
his primary concept. Strictly speakiug we apply the term ethuogra- 
pher to a student of a nation or any other agglommeration ot human 
beings, but this ought not so to be. 

As the first question in anthropology is the origin of man so the first 
question in ethnology is the origin and boundaries of races. Thesearch 
for primitive man, therefore, is at the same time thesearch tor primitive 



men. 



The second inquiry, which trenches on archii^ology, and is indeed the 
motive of the archaeologist's researches, is what races of men have lived 
on the earth and what may be the relation of the present races to them. 
Upon this question M. de Quatrefages and Marquis de NadaiUac are our 
chief authorities ; while for general treatises on the species at large the 
reader must consult Snell, Kriegel, Achelis, Maladini, Robei-t Browu 
Weatherman, and various translations and adaptations ot ^ on Hel wald. 
The seventh volume of the Standard Natural History is reprinted with 
an appendix which very much adds to its value. Prof. A. H. Keane in 
his published classifications and in his reviews iu Nature continues to 
be the best English authority on general ethnology. 

The biological inquiry into color of hair, eyes, and skin, into pilosity 
and other anthropometric 'characteristics is mainly with reterence to the 

subject of race. 

Iu the Journal of the Anthropological Institute (xvi,3-0-3* J) Mr. a. 
S. Poole shows the Egyptian classification of the races of man. 

The question of racial healing or medical ethnography is considered 
bv Tifianv and Veirier. 
' In all anthropological journals will be found more or less ethnography. 
In Paris is published Ilevue d'Ethnographie. The Journal of the IJoyal 
Asiatic Society of London is a rich mine of information, and a <^omplete 
index of all its volumes will be found at the close of the volume for 1888,

1888, Mr. Thomas Tyler delivered a course of lectures upou this people 
in the British Museum, 

A few years ago all we kuew of the Hittites was contaioed iu a few 
vague references ill the First and Second Book of Kiugs. In the true 
sense of the word empire, it is doubtful whether a Hittite empire ever 
existed. Says Mr. Tyler : " Most likely there were iu Asia Minor many 
states or even single cities which were usually to a great extent inde- 
pendent, and the peoples of Avhich were not, perhaps, altogether homo- 
geneous iu race, but which, under pressure of the necessity of war, 
formed a federation. That the Hittites spoken of in the Old Testament 
are to be identified with the Khita of the Egyptian monuments and 
with the peoples of the land of Khatti in the Assyrian records, is com- 
ing out more and more clearly." 

The primitive home of the Aryans seems now to be less definitely 
fixed than formerly. The studies of Pott, Lassen, and Max Miiller 
made the highlands of Asia to be the cradle of the Aryans. Dr. La- 
tham, even at that time, urged that the Asiatic hypothesis was mere 
assumption based on no shadow of proof. Kecently the European 
theory has been entertained by Gugei, Cuuo, Peuka, and Schrader. 

The commingling of blood, language, social organization, beliefs, and 
activities in the Malayan area is elucidated by Dr. Fridrich's paper in 
the miscellany relating to Indo China. He noticed the continued exist- 
ence of Hindooism in Java and other parts of Malaysia, and says that it 
is essential to a proper understanding of the condition of the Malayan 
tribes that the intluence which Hindoo civilization has exerted on them 
should be investigated. 

At a meeting of the Asiatic Society of Japan, reported in the Japan 
Weekly Mail of November 10, Mr. Batchelor read a paper on Kamui 
or Gods of the Aiuos. The author is not convinced that the Ainos are 
dying out.

LANGUAGE. 

By many anthropologists language is placed among the biological 
sciences. Such liberties with the terui, however, would consign the 
whole study of man to the realm of biology. In reality the true start- 
ing point of anthropology is the study of invention, the consideration 
of all those devices, institutions, ways and means through which our 
race has made its progressive journey. 

Among the inventions or institutions that lie at the foundation of 
culture, the most universal in time and place is language, or devices for 
the communication of thought. 

The science of glossology is the anthropology or natural history of 
speech. It therefore is concerned with origins, with classifications, 
with life histories, with variation under stress, with as many questions 
as would be asked about plants or animals. 

Indeed, the very first problem that confronts us is this : How far have 
the animals anticipated us in speech ; to what extent have they been 
our teachers, and what suggestions of their activities and natural qual- 
ities have helped in forming the vocabularies of the world. 

Close on the heels of this inquiry comes the subject of gesture-lan- 
guage, to the study of which Col. Garrick Mallery has devofed so many 
years of patient research. The result of his labors, with references to 
further authorities, are to be found in the publications of the Bureau of 
Ethnology. 

Upon the biological side have appeared such works as Ilaudman 
upon the human voice and language in physiological i)sychology, Loew- 
enberg's physiological researches on nasal vowels, Marique upon the 



ANTHROPOLOGY. 513 

larynx, orcjaii of phonatioii, in its relations witli the cerebral centers of 
language and ideation, Aranjo on the metamorphoses of a sound. Bell's 
university lectures on phonetics, Jacobi on the special liability to the 
loss of nouns in apliasia, Horatio Hale on the development of language. 
The Index-Medicus should be faithfully consulted for papers on the 
anatomy, abnormalities, diseases, and peculiarities of the vocal organs. 

Other productions of general interest are Tregear's ancient alphabets, 
Newell on the color of words, Brinton on the language of palaeolithic 
man, Stevenson on place names, Horatio Hale on the development of 
language. 

In this connection reference is again made to the controversy in Na- 
ture originated by Max Miiller, concerning the dependence of reason 
upon speech. 

The study of an individual language maybe termed glossography, just 
as the study of a separate people is styled ethnography. The two, in- 
deed, are often confounded. If language and race were conterminous 
a list of all the languages of the world would be at the same time a list 
of all tlie peoples or breeds of mankind. Just so far as they are not con- 
terminous is confusion introduced into the enumerations of the l;in- 
guages of the dift'ereut continents. The complaint is made by critics 
of great lists, such as Gust's for Africa and Polynesia, that this or that 
term is not of a language, but of a government. 

Moreover, the author who writes about a people generally includes 
a chapter on their language. It is safe, therefore, for the glossologist 
to look carefully over the ethnographic titles for material. Further- 
n)ore, the accompanying list of works that have been noticed will be 
useful.

entire literature of North American aboriginal languages will leave 
nothing further to be desired. The original plan of including all works 
under a single apbabetical list has been abandoned, and the author 
takes up each of the stocks separately. Two monographs have ap- 
peared in the new series, " Bibliography of the Eskimo Language " and 
"Bibliography of the Siouan Language." both issued by the Bureau of 
Ethnology and printed at the Government Printing Office. Each of 
the other stocks will receive similar treatment. When the work shall 
be completed it will leave nothing to desire as a pointer to all sources 
of information on America. 

Mr. A. S. Gatschet has worked up the linguistic families in South- 
eastern United States. Further i)ublications on North American speech

Royal Asiatic Society, Transactions of the Philological Associations, 
Zeitschrift der morgeuliindische Gesellschaft, and the journals men- 
tioned under general anthropology, must be the authorities on glossology. 

TECHNOLOGY. 

The arts of mankind are the material on which to base the natural 
history of invention. Each art has had its humble birth and has grown 
to maturity by the constant increase of complexity. The process of in- 
venting itself has had <in organic growth, commencing with what might 
be called an unicellular process and ending with a most complicated set 
of co-ordinated actions, as numerous and intricate as the parts of the 
human body. Between a childish or a savage acting on suggestion, a 
no-sooner-said-than-done performauce, and the inventing of the Bell 
telephone, with all the thinking, experimenting, petitioning, pleading, 
correspondence, examination, and litigation involved is a very long 
way. Between the two lie all human mental activities, growing more 
and more complex as we proceed. 

Anthropology is concerned with every human activity and industry, 
for the i)urpose of obtaining their testimony to human history. The 
history of man and of his mind are indeed more clearl}^ written in things 
than in words. 

There are two or three distinct ways of treating technological mate- 
rial, based on the order of the ruling concepts, art, race, region. A 
study might be governed by certain groups of arts for the principal con- 
cept, as in all Mr. E. B. Tylor's writings ; or by certain regions of the 



ANTHROPOLOGY. 515 

globe, where the conditions are unique, as in the writings of A. Bastian ; 
or we could study out the industries of a race, a nation, a sect, wher- 
ever in time or i)lace they may have lived. 

One of the most profitable series of investigations into the origin of 
form and decoration in the arts is a series of i)apers by W. H. Holmes, 
published by the Bureau of Ethnology. Mr. Holmes finds a little frag- 
ment of pottery in the fields around Washington. This tells him that 
the aborigines knew the ceramic art. By pressing on the surface a 
piece of artist's clay he gets the impress of woven texture. This tells 
that these aborigines were weavers, and it is very easy to see what kind 
of weavers they were. It also tells how they decorated pottery. Thus, 
by piecing art to art, fragment to fragment, the author is able to recon- 
struct the daily life of an extinct people ; to ascertain how the invent- 
ive faculty has caught up one suggestion of dame nature after another, 
and then technic laziness has reduced the full form to conventionalisms 
and abbreviations. Herr Schaaffhausen has caught up the same idea 
and published "Entwickelung des menschlicheu Hand werks und den 
Einfluss des Stoftes auf die Kunstform." 

Next to the subject of invention and the stimulus thereto by means 
of patents the subject of learning a trade, of industrial training, 
demands the careful study of the anthropologists. It is easy to follow 
up the methods of our own day, but our chief inquiry is how things 
came to be as they are. Such papers as that of G. P. Morris on indus- 
trial training two centuries ago will be hailed with pleasure by com- 
parative technologists. 

The only way to illustrate and to study this branch of anthropology 
is by means of the museum, the gallery or cabinet of drawings, and the 
specifications. If one would follow up an art he must collect material, 
he must supply himself with many pictures, he must have his card cat- 
alogue or files of ready reference, and all these must be movable and 
interchangeable. 

In the U. S. National Museum there are many series of objects in- 
stalled to show the natural history of invention, such as naval archi- 
tecture, land transportation, fishing, music, pottery, cutlery, weapous. 
These are of especial interest to craftsmen, who find no difliculty in 
reading the history of their daily occupations. 

It IS not necessary to enumerate the names of all the arts about which 
books have been written in 1887-88. A glance at the list of titles 
proves that some one has been fascinated with nearly every occupation 
of mankind. The unit chapter on this subject, the technographic unit 
IS an art of a people. If these be well written they may be allowed to 
tell their story in two directions, either as a part of the whole history 
ot a peo])le or as a part of the whole history of an art. If Mr. Sato has 
written a work on Japanese farming, it may be filed away under farm- 
ing or under Japanese, according to the ruling motive in the mind of the

ters that have been written.

ARCHEOLOGY. 

Leaving the question of anthropogeny to the biologists the archseolo- 
gist will still be concerned with primitive man. He desires to know 
where our race made its debut on this planet, how long ago it was, aiid 
what was the intellectual and material stock in trade of that lirst man. 

For the study of what M. Collignou calls L'homme avant I'Histoire 
there is constantly collecting fresh material. 

The geologist and the pahTontologist are the first to take the stand. 
Mr. W J McGee, of the U. S. Geological Survey, whose especial de- 
l)artment is the quaternary period, has addressed himself to the strati- 
graphic question, while the pala'ontology has been discussed by Mar- 
cellin Boule, and the cotemporaneity of the mammoth and man by J. 
M. Clarke and H. Howorth, MM. de Puydt and Lohest. 

On the subject of the antiquity of man we have a paper by L. Guig- 
nard, relating to France; by A. R. Wallace, on the antiquity of man in 
America; by E. Riviere, on the antiquity of man in the Alps. 

There has been a question agitated between geologists, palfeoutolo- 
gists, and archaeologists whetiier in cave and other explorations we are 
to regard the forui and finish of implements, the associated animal 
remains, or the condition of the strata, to be the best guide to a knowl- 
edge of the age of the deposit. The case has been pretty thoroughly 
reviewed by Henry Hicks and Worthington G. Smith. (Nature, xxxvii 
105, 129, 202.) 

A fresh classification of archaeology is marked by the ai)pearance in 
Englaud of a new journal, the Arch?eological Review. The range and 
divisions of th«^ subjects are: (1) Institutional archaeology, which ex- 
tends the domain of archa-ology into that of sociology. Indeed, every 
branch of anthropology may thus have its archa-ology. (2) Anthropo- 
logical archaeology. This is a bad title. It is meant to include biological 
and technological subjects, the remains of man and of his arts. (3) 
Folk-lore. The society would iuclude in this the origin of lauguage, all 
kinds of tales, rhymes, myths, and lore, and the begiunings of philoso- 
phy. (4) Literature ; that is, the oldest literatures. The society has 
promised to do one good thing, for which, well done, they will receive 
the gratitude of all students. They will index all English archa?ological 
]uiblications prior to 18SG and current English and foreign archwologi- 
cal i)eriodicals, and will issue special judej^es to different branches of 
archaeological research.

standing committees on prehistoric remains and the preservation of 
aucient monnmeuts. The former committee has been busy in mapping 
and describing all the mouumeats of the country ; the hitter in peti- 
tioning both Parliament and the local proprietors to preserve the most 
celebrated remains. A brief of the reports will be found in Nature, 
XXXVII, 93, 94. 

The same is also true in France and Germany. Movements are on 
foot for the cataloguing of all museums, for the systematic and co-op- 
erative survey of remains and the preservation of such monuments as 
have historic interest. 

The Koyal Academy of Sciences in Austria has appointed a prehis- 
toric commission, which has already issued its first report. In our 
own couutry the subject of archaeology is also receiving a systematic 
treatment. Fortunately for the final result the two principal institu- 
tions engaged in extended work are pursuing different methods. 

Prof. Cyvus Thomas, of the Bureau of Ethnology, commences with a 
census of all the mounds, earth- works, and other aboriginal remains in 
the United States. In the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Quar- 
terly Mrs. Thomas presents a bibliography on this subject, but the plan 
of the Bureau has been more extended than this. The whole area has 
a card catalogue, by means of which it is possible to construct maps of 
large or small spaces and to exhibit the number and distribution of 
each class. The most valuable portion of Professor Thomas' task, and 
that which exhibits the great advantage of combined labor, is that he 
is able to work by the side of another staff of men who are studying the 
distribution of Indians over this continent at the time when they were 
first visited by white men. Laying the map of the distribution of lin- 
guistic stocks on the top of his own map of the mounds, and so forth, 
he has a starting point for deciding who were the Mound-builders. 

The Peabody Museum, or, strictly speaking, its curator, Professor 
Putnam, educated in comparative anatomy under the elder Agassiz, has 
addressed himself to another problem, namely, the careful dissection of 
graves, mounds, and remains so as to know exactly how they were con- 
structed, what relics are deposited in them, and what modern modes 
of burial they most resemble. Of course, the final result will be reached 
by combining the two investigations. 

It is impossible to mention the names of authors who have reported 
special researches in archaeology. 

To follow the subject abroad it is only necessary to study the English 
Archaeological Review, Anticpia, the French. Matenaux pour I'Historie 
de I'Eomme, and the bibliographical appendix to the Archiv fiir An- 
thropologic. 

In our own country the annual reports of the Peabody Museum, the 
reports of the Ar(;h:Bological Institute of America and its ally the 
American Journal of Arch:eology, the American Antiquarian, Proceed- 
ings of the American Antiquariau Society, the reports of the Smithso-

SOCIOLOGY. 

Sociology is the natural history of society, and studies the formation 
and growth of human compacts that have survived and become varie- 
ties or species. It also investigates the life history of societies, their 
customs and principles. 

To repeat the titles of all sociological papers that appeared in 1887-'88 
would require a space equal to Pool's Index to periodical literature. To 
show the variety of topics and not to exhaust the subject, a list of 
catch-words is given, with the authors to consult respecting each. It 
may not always be the most eminent authority. Suffice it to say, the 
subject has been of sufficient prominence-to arrest some one's attention.

One of the latest subjects to be brought within the area of scientific

novelist's imagination. The conditions of society, with rare exceptions,

were not such as to favor the romantic i)assiou even in Greece and 
Rome. The liighest expressions of sexual devotion are to be found in 
the ancient literature of Semitic peoples. Mantegazza was the first to 
write seriously upon the subject. Since his celebrated papers the litera- 
ture has rapidly multiplied. (Nature, xxxvii, 149.) 

The part played by both love and beauty in social selection may be 
studied in connection with Romanes on physiological selection. An- 
other method of inquiry is to follow up the natural history of the pro- 
cess of love-making from its simplest to its most complex forms.

which the struggle for existence is carried on, they have not made it 
less real or less bitter." In other words, great enterprises and the re- 
sults of world compelling inventions are achieving great social victories 
and defeats as influential as those wrought by decisive wars. ^Notethe 
influence on the trade of England and the Mediterranean, first, by the 
voyage of Vasco da Gama, and second, by the Suez Canal. Parliamen-

520 RECOKD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888 

In everyone of the jonrnals devoted to the .subject at large sociolog- 
ical papers are published. Furthermore, the great Euglish quarterlies, 
the North Americau Review, the Foruin, even the monthlies, weeklies, 
and dailies, are witness of the absorption of the public mind in this de- 
partment of anthropology. 

Like every other investigation, the attempt to study crime in a scien- 
tific manner began with crude and false methods. For instance, the 
comparison of states or nations based on arrests led to a positively in- 
verted result; because in highly organized communities a great many 
acts are considered to be criminal that are not noticed in Avorse com- 
munities. Even in the case of prison statistics. General Walker says, 
"The number of persons in prison on a given date affords a verj- delu- 
sive measure of the comparative morality of different sections of the 
country having different codes of laws and different social standards. 
For instance, a very large part of the persons who are at any time In 
prisons and jails in the State of Massachusetts, are tliere for drunken- 
ness or for the illegal sale of liquors. In another State, the man who 
sells liquor is a public benefactor. So far, then, the paucity of prison 
lists simply represents the toleration of vice, if not of crime." 

The Italian criminologists were not slow to notice this and apply the 
facts in rectifying deductions about heredity, atavism, primitive man, 
and the descent of man, based on the anthropometry of arrested per- 
sons and convicts in general. If a good but poor man die in a debtor's 
prison one would scarcely look for the promise of his misfortune in his 
cranium. Even deductions based on special crimes, as theft or murder, 
must not omit the history of the man on account of the times, the va- 
rious external stimuli that have helped, perhaps forced, against his 
will, the man to the action. This subject has been thought worthy of 
a special world's convention, which has published Actes du I congres 
internationale d'anthropologie criminelle in Rome, November, 1885, 
and issued in Turin in 1887. The following mentioned works will also 
help to the public interest and the variety of treatment which the sub- 
ject has elicited.

Paul Albrecht. Atlas of criminality, the new anthropometry and 
criminality, and bibliographic penitentiaire of different countries since

crucitixion m ihe ancient east by George Rawlinson. Judicial exe- 
cutions : J. J. Z. Marshall. The prison world : E. Gautier. Genesis 
and function of legal penalties : Angelo Vaccaro. 

The police systetn of various countries and all the paraphernalia of 
arrest should also lind a place in this department of sociology. 

Chinese civilization has a sympathizing exponent in the volume of M. 
Simon. The most civilized state, according to this author, is that " in 
which on a given area, the largest possible number of human beings 
are able to procure and distribute most equally amongst themselves the 
most well-being, liberty, justice, and security." Upon this scale China 
IS pronounced to be the most highly civilized country in the world. 
"Its history shows the phenomena of heredity in regular succession, 
neither modified nor obstructed by change of medium, with the evolu- 
tion of events and ideas — an ev^olutiou as regular as that of living' 
beings freely proceeding unshaken and untroubled by any exterior in- 
fluence, by which its direction might have been altered, or its develop- 
ment retarded ; and it is here that we find the deep and original interest 
of China, and perhaps also the secret of her extraordinary longevity." 

PHILOSOPHY, MYTHOLOaY, AND FOLK-LORE. 

Among the lowest tribes of men all lore and myth is an attempt to 
explain phenomena. This was long ago pointed out by Peschel. Among 
the higher races we may study metaphysics, ethics, folk-lore, and re- 
ligion as somewhat separate problems. Even here they are much in- 
tertwined. The philosophy of living in this world has never been able 
to disengage itself from a world beyond, a spirit world, acquainted with 
ours, influencing it, and often believed to dominate over the life beyond. 

For the purpose of scientific investigation, religion is here defined to 
include the following topics: 

(1) Social organization in view of the spirit world; in general terms, 
the clcrg3^ and laity of a peoi)le. This we may call the Church. 

(2) The beliefs of a people about the spirit world embodied in their 
sacred books, national epics, myths, and folk-lore. This we may call 
the Creed. 



522 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

(3) Conduct in view of the ecclesiastical organization. It includes 
sacred precincts, edifices, regalia, ])araplu'rnalia of worship, fetes, pro- 
cessions, seleiim services, rites, sacrifices, holidays. In a single word, 
it is the Cult of a people. 

From this definition it will readily be seen that all religious may enter 
the area of scientific inquiry, and, again, that it is very difficult to keep 
philosophy, or the explanation of the universe, religion, or creed and 
cult and folk-lore, which is the literature and custom of the unlettered, 
apart in the laboratory. 

It is an evidence of progress that there is in Paris a Musee des Ee- 
ligious, publishing Eevue de I'Histoire des Religions. lu the sixteenth 
volume of this ijeriodical, Theodore Reinach has a paper on Les classifi- 
cations des religions et la role de I'Histoire des religions dans I'euseigne- 
ment public. Julien Vinson has also in Revue de Liuguistique (xxi, 
361-3G4) a paper entitled " Les religions actuelles, leurs doctrines, leur 
evolution, leur histoire." Anthropological mythology also receives the 
attention of B. Platner in the New Englander (1888), and the ghost 
theory of the origin of religion is discussed in Bibliotheca Sacra for the 
same year. 

The whole subject of the basis of morality is being reviewed in the 
most learned of our periodicals in America, in England, and on the con- 
tinent. The North American Review, the Forum, the Contemporary 
Review, the Nineteenth Century, the Revue Politique et Litteraire, the 
Revue des deux Mondes must be faithfully studied by one who would 
keep posted on the questions raised. Reviewing the ethical treatises 
of Schuman and Best, Mr. Romanes enforces the sufficiency of the 
Darwinian hypothesis to explain the moral sense in all its protean 
forms as proximately due to natural causes. In Popular Science 
Monthly, W. S. Lillj' discusses materialism and morality (xxx, 474-493), 
and Prof. A. P. Peabody speaks of classic and Semitic ethics in Andover 
Review (x, 361-376), All of the theological periodicals discuss ethical 
questions, basing human duty on divine injunction. In addition to the 
publications of the Musee Guimet and the journals and proceedings of 
the great anthropological societies, the student must consult for the 
study of comparative religion the Journal of the Royal Asiatic in Lon- 
don and the transactions, etc., of the branches in India and China. At 
the close of the volume of the Journal for 1888 (vol. xx, pt. 4; appen- 
dix, pp. 1-218) will be found an excellent index to the whole series. 

In the classified index appended to Archiv fiir Anthropologic each 
year is a separate collection of titles relating to this branch of anthro- 
pology. 

The Revue d'Anthropologie and Revue d'Ethnographie also give 
each quarter a list of publications, among which are many bearing on 
religion. 

The most fascinating department of our science is folk-lore. It is so 
familiar to every intelligent person from childhood ; it is imbedded in

ev^ery miud, and furnishes the starting point for every department of 
knowledge. 
To this subject are now devoted several journals, namely: 

Folk-Lore Journal. London. i Melusine. Paris. 

The Journal of American Folk-Lore. | LeMuseou. Louvain. 

Cambridge. i Bibliogiapliie des Traditions. Paris. 

Journal of the Gypsy-Lore Societj'. Lou- Arcliieojogical Review. London,

Nations, twenty-seven volumes. Or- 
leans. 



Revue des Traditions Populaires, Paris. 



The English Folk-lore Society has made the greatest possible advance 
in systematizing its work by the tabulation of folk-tales. This works 
a great economy in two ways. First, two or more persons do not waste 
their time by working on the same author. A list of collections ispub- 
lislied and the name of the tabulator is appended to each volume. 
Second, and this is the greatest improvement, there is a form of tabu- 
lation prescribed by the society, consisting of the title of the story, the 
dramatis personse, an abstract of the story, giving its leading incidents 
and leaving out vain repetitions, an alphabetic list of incidents, and so 
much bibliography as will enable the future student to follow up the 
matter for himself. It can be readily seen how much labor is spared 
to the comparative folk-lorist by this economic scheme.

The surroundings of a people, the play of the environment on the 
people, and their effect on the nature of things around them Mivart calls 
hexiology. 

In the U. S. National Museum is a room, the function of which is to 
show how vegetable and animal products have been made contributory 
to human weal and happiness. A few titles of books and papers along 
this line of research will show how important to us is this branch of 
study. 

The French have a societe d'acclimatation, patronized by the Govern- 
ment, publishing a large series of journals, and consulted with reference 
to colonization. Attention may also be called to the following: The 
animal economic products of India: J. R. Murray. L'intluence du milieu 
sur les peuples de I'Asie Ceutrale: M. de Ujfalvy. On tropical and sub- 
tropical climate and the acclimatization of the fair races in hot countries: 
D. H. Cullimore. Origin of the domestication of the horse: II. S. Huide- 
koper. Le cheval sauvage de la Dzoungaril: Dr. Fauvelle. Equidae 
de laperiodequarternaire: Ed. Piette. The metals of ancient Chaldaea: 
P. E. Berthelot. On nephrite and jadeite: F. W. Clarke and G. P. Mer- 
rill. Food and fibre plants of the North American Indians: J. S. New- 
berry. Nouvelle recherches sur le type sauvage. 

In this brief record, doubtless many titles of great value are omitted. 



524 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888. 

Nevertheless, euougli are given to show how many avennos of scientific 
research lead up to man as their object. It will be possible in future 
summaries to systematize the subject still farther. Several journals of 
special function are now giving bibliographies in their own departments 
so that we shall have only to combine their work to perfect the record.

CHRONOLOGY OF THE HUMAN PERIOD.* 



By J. WOODBRIDGE DaVIS. 



The earliest exact date we Lave is that of the victory of Correbus, 
the lUDDer, at the Olympian festival, July 21, B. C. 776. Beyond this, 
uncertainty grows from years into decades and from decades into cen- 
turies until, in the earliest existing traditions, it becomes supreme ; 
and yet man's history is not half told. 

Of the vast preceding ages from which no word has come, the chro- 
nology is necessarily based upon traces of the events themselves. So 
the best results we can expect from an exploration of this dark region 
of time are a meager knowledge of events, a fairly accurate knowledge 
of successions, and a very inaccurate knowledge of durations. 

There is however an artificial difficulty in the way of the student 
of archteology, namely, the several scales used in the division of pre 
historic time. A like difficulty pertaining to the era of written records 
has been overcome by means of formulae for the translation of elates 
from one scale to another. But no systematic attempt seems to have 
been made to correlate the various scales applied to the measurement 
of the older Quaternary. 

For instance, the antiquity of a certain "find" is rated by reference 
to the geological event then taking place ; of another, according to a 
scale indicated by the successive disappearances of wild animals from 
a particular district. Other scales are based upon the progress in 
human arts and customs, the successive domestication of animals, etc. 
Each author relies especially upon one or two of these modes of reckon- 
ing with occasional references to some of the others. Except to experts, 
this is confusing. 

On this account the chart appended was prepared for private use. 
Here it is attempted to exhibit the principal scales in their chronologi- 
cal inter-relations. This was accomplished by collecting and arranging 
all the cross-references occurring in many of the best works, cliiefiy 
those of Worsaae, Morlot, Gastaldi, Lartet and Christie, Lubbock, 
Lyell and Dawkins.

THE HUMAN PERIOD. 585 

The chart explains itself. All the items occurring^ together in one 
cdliiinii between two horizontal lines, represent the characteristics of 
the period embraced by those lines. It has been found useful for de- 
termining the relation in time of events originally referred to different 
scales, and it also serves to divide the human period into smaller parts 
than can any single scale. 

The chart relates to Europe only, the most thoroughly investigated 
of the continents. Even so, its divisions are not contemporaneous for 
all that land. The dawn of written history in Britain breaks eight or 
nine centuries after that of Greece. The polished stone and the bronze 
ages must have rolled over Europe in slowly moving waves. The ad- 
vancement of the other arts and the domestication of animals similarly 
spread from men to men, retarded by mountain chains and salty chan- 
nels. But if these scales were applied to America, the later stone age 
alone must be shifted downward at least five thousand years. 



WERE THE OSAGES MOUND BUILDERS? 



By Dr. J. F. Snyder, Virginia, Cass Comity, Illinois, 



A reported instance of mound building by the Osage Indians, near 
the close of the last century, has been cited by numerous writers on 
American ethnology in proof of the otherwise well-authenticated fact 
that the custom of erecting mounds over their distinguished dead was 
practiced by some of our Indian tribes down to comparatively recent 
times. The instance referred to was related by Dr. Beck, in his "Gaz- 
etteer of Missouri and Illinois." When writing of the Osage River he 
says: "Ancient works exist on this river as elsewhere. The remains 
of mounds and fortifications are almost everywhere to be seen. Oue 
of the largest mounds in this country has been thrown up on this stream, 
within the last thirty or forty years, by the Osages, near the great Osage 
village, in honor of oue of their deceased chiefs. This fact proves con- 
clusively the original object of these mounds, and refutes the theory 
that they must necessarily have been erected by a race of men more 
civdized than the present tribes of Indians." * 

This was written in 1822. In the fall of 1834, Mr. Featherstonhaugh, 
the noted English geologist, when in the vicinity of St. Louis, Missouri, 
heard a similar statement in regard to the erection of a large mound, by 
the Osages, in the same locality, which he relates as follows : "We 
therefore walked into the country a mile and a half, to a Major Sibley's, 
to whom I had a letter. - - - He had resided many years amongst 
the western Indians as agent of the United States, and had been one 
of the commissioners appointed to lay out the Traders' Road to Santa 
F6, in New Mexico. We soon got into conversation about the lofty 
mounds I had seen, when he stated that an ancient chief of the Osage 
Indians (corrupted by the French from Whashash) informed him, whilst 
he was a resident amongst them, that a large conical mound (which he. 
Major Sibley, was in the habit of seeing every day whilst he resided 
amongst them) was constructed when he was a boy. That a chief of 
his nation, who was a distinguished warrior, and greatly belo%'ed by the 
Indians, and who was called Jean Defoe by the French, unexpectedly

died whilst all the men of his tribe were haatingj in a distant country. 
His friends buried him in the usual manner, witii his weapons, bis 
eartlien pot, and the usual accom|)animents, and raised a small mound 
over his remains. When the nation returned from the hunt this mound 
was enlarged at intervals, every man assisting to carry materials, and 
thus the accumulation of earth went on for a long period until it reached 
its present height, when they dressed it off at the top to a conical form. 
The old chief further said that he had been informed and believed that 
all the mounds had a similar origin.."* 

It is altogether probable that these two accounts relate to the same 
mound, and that Dr. Beck's source of information regarding it is the 
same as Mr. Featherstonhaugh's. The "ancient chief" may have pur- 
posely imposed upon Major Sibley's credulity in this matter: at any 
rate his reliability as a historian of his people is somewhat shaken by 
his further statement that "the tradition had been steadily transmitted 
down from their ancestors; that the Whashash (Osages) had originally 
emigrated from the east in great numbers, ^he population being too 
dense for their hunting-grounds. He described the forks of the Alle- 
gheny and Monongahela Rivers, and the Falls of the Ohio, where they 
had dwelt some time, and where large bands had separated from them, 
and distributed themselves in the surrounding country, etc." f The 
Osages, it is well known, are a branch of the Dakotas, and migrated 
to Missouri from the north, or northwest; and perhaps the only mem- 
bers of that tribe who have at any time visited the headwaters of the 
Ohio were the lew who joined the force that defeated General Braddock 
in 1755, and the peaceful delegations that have since visited Washing- 
ton City. 

The first mention of the Osages in history is by Father Marquette, 
who heard of them when descending the Mississippi in 1(373; and in his 
map of the regions discovered by him he locates them as the "Ouchage," 
on the Missouri River, about the present site of Jefferson City. We 
have then no definite account of these Indians until 1719, when Du 
Tissenet, a young Canadian-Frenchman, was sent with a party, by M. 
DeBieuville, then governor of Louisiana, to explore the western 
wilderness in search of ores and precious metals. Du Tissenet's expedi- 
tion set out from Kaskaskia, and, traversing southern Missouri, followed 
the Osage River — which he so named — to its northwestern sources in 
Kansas. He visited the Osages at their "Great Village" near the con- 
fluence of the Little Osage and the Marmiton, in what is now Vernon 
County, in Missouri, and which was then the central point of their 
country. During the next year, 1720, Renault, with his lieutenant, La 
Motte, and party, including five hundred negro slaves, arrived at Fort 
Chartres, and at once sent out exploring parties in all directions in 

"Excursion through the Slave States, etc. By G, W. Ffcatherstonhaugh, F. R. S., 
F. G. S., Two vols., London, 1844, vol. I, pp. 286,287.

quest of precious ores. They opened lead mines in the vicinity of Potosi, 
at Mine a Renault and Mine La Motte, which have been, more or less, in 
o[)eration to the present day; and established trading" posts and inti- 
mate commercial relations with the Osages. In 1800 Lieutenant Pike, 
on his expedition to the mountains, found the Osages at their "Great" 
and "Little" vilhiges, where they had entertained Du Tissenet eighty- 
seven years before; both travelers locating the larger or main village 
in what is now Blue Mound Township, Vernon County, Missouri. Sev- 
eral years before Lieutenant Pike's visit — in 1787 — Pierre Chouteau 
had established, near the Great Village, a fortified trading- post which 
he named Fort Carondelet in honor of the Baron De Oarondelet. 

The topographical features of the country bordering the Osage River 
are in many respects very peculiar and strangely attractive. In the 
greater part of its course the river has cut its way through ledges of 
massive magnesian limestone which tower above the beautiful stream in 
domes and terraces and knobs that seem to have been designed by 
skillfnl architects. Professor Swallow says of these blufis, about the 
junction of the ]S'iangua and Linn Creek with the Osage, they "slope 
back into knobs and ridges, which are frequently surrounded by 
numerous natural terraces so regular and uniform that they appear 
like the work of human hands. These terraces are formed by tlic de- 
composition of the strata of magnesian limestone which form the bluffs."* 
Farther back from the river, remarks the same writer, " The prairie of 
this region is characterized by what are called knobs or mounds; they 
are somewhat variable in size and form, but usually present the ap- 
pearance of a truncated cone. The tops of these mounds are usually 
flat, and covered by a thin soil, underlaid by a durable stratum of 
sandstone or limestone, which crops out on all sides near the top, pre- 
vents the wearing away of the upper edges, and preserves the well 
defined angle between the top and sides; while the stratum of shale or 
clay, which forms the lower part, is easily decomposed and carried 
away by aqueous agencies. The sides rise with a gentle declivity, at 
first, but become more and more abrupt until they are nearly perpen- 
dicular at the top. The most of these mounds belong to the coal meas- 
ures; but those near Bolivar are in the Chemung group, the upper 
beds of the vermicular sandstone and shales forming the top, and the 
underlying shales the lower part of them."t Of the mounds men- 
tioned by Professor Swallow, near Bolivar, one of the largest was 
almost in sight at my front door. It stood, in bold relief, near the 
middle of a cultivated field, a truncated pyramid, 20 feet high, with 
level top 20 by 50 feet in dimensions, and with angles and sides true

aud regular; the complete duplicate in appearance of many artificial 
mounds lo be seen east of the Mississippi.* 

The region at the head of the Osage River, particularly the district 
lying between its main branches, the Marais des Cygnes and the Little 
Osage, is mostly prairie, rising in graceful undulations aud ridges, and 
isohited conical mounds, with broad valleys between, eroded by aque- 
ous or glacial action, combining in landscapes of charming interest and 
beauty. 

Prof. G. O. Broadhead, late State geologist of Missouri, in treating 
of the geology of Vernon County, remarks: "It is here diversified by 
clusters of mounds, reaching more than 100 feet above the general sur- 
face of the i)rairie. Blue Mound is 150 feet high, and can be seen for 
a long distance. Timbered Hill, near the mouth of Marmaton and 
Little Osage is a round, isolated mound, IVO feet above the Marmaton, 
and over 100 feet above the surrounding plain. Being several miles 
from other marked elevations, it is seen for many miles off. North of the 
Little Osage a series of mouuds extends east and west along the county 
line at an elevation of over 100 feet above the gently stretching val- 
ley at their base. - - - Further west, in range 32, we find the 
mounds rising still higher. These mounds continue on southward 
through the county, interrupted sometimes for several miles by the 
streams. From Moundville a high ridge or series of mounds connec- 
ted, trends off to the south line of the county, rising near the northern 
and middle line to 140 feet above the lower valleys, or 80 to 100 feet 
above Moundville Valley. ■ - - The occasional occurrence of these 
mounds gives a charming variety to the landscape. Many of them can 
be seen at a long distance, aud from their summits the views are often 
very fine. - - - Undoubtedly this county has been subjected to 
glacial agency at some former period of time. Its results may be seen 
in isolated mounds and deep valleys between. The amount of erosion 
must hav^e been of great force and of long continuance, if we view the 
mounds and long stretches of distance from one to the other. When pro- 
tected by the upper series of limestones, the erosion was not complete; 
but if these limestones were much broken, or entirely absent, leaving 
the sandstones exposed, the waters would rush down with resistless 
force, and bear away all the softer material.'"! 

In a foot note on page 83 of his exhaustive monograph on " The 
Mouuds of the Mississippi Valley Historically Considered," Prof. Lucien 
Carr, in discussing the trustworthiness of a book puri)orting to have 
been written by one J. D. Hunter, ('- Memoirs of a Captivity," etc., Lon- 
don, 1828,) remarks: "To go no further than the instances (juoted in the 
text, we find undoubted evidence that the Osages have, within the pres- 
ent century, built both stone heaps and burial mounds."

WEKK THE OSAOE.S MOHND-HUILDElt.S ? 591 

So far as history can aid iin in tracing the Osages we are satisfied that 
at the period of Marquette's descent of the Mississippi, in 1673, they oc- 
cupied one or both banks of the Missouri River, at and above the 
month of the Osage; and that they established the central villages of 
their tribe at the head of the Osage River about the year 1700, or a few 
years before that date, and remained there until their removal, in 1820, 
farther west. That, in that time, they erected stone heaps occasionally 
over the graves of their dead — to preserve the bodies from the ravages 
of wild beasts — is true, for some of the stone heaps, attesting the fact, 
are still to be seen there. But they built no earthen mounds. In all 
the region of their occupancy of the immediate valley of the Osage 
River there is not an artificial mound of earth to be found ; and it is 
not reasonable to suppose that such monuments, if erected, should in 
the lapse of less than a century have so completely disappeared. Pro- 
fessor Broadhead, who carefully explored the entire valley of the Osage 
in prosecuting the geological survey of Missouri, in a private letter re- 
plying to my inquiries, says: " I have seen noartificial sepulchral mounds 
on the Osage River. With the exception of pictographs, on the rocks, 
about 25 miles above its month, I found but few, if any, prehistoric 
remains anywhere on that river." 

Robert I. Holcombe, esq., who ranks little below Parkman in Ameri- 
can historical research, after spending many months at or near the 
site of the "Great Osage village," when writing of that locality in his 
'" History of Vernon County, Missouri," says: "It does not seem that 
the mysterious race of beings termed the Mound Builders ever dwelt here 
in any considerable numbers or for any considerable i)eriod. But few 
traces of their occupation remain, if they ever existed. In some parts 
of the county there are a few small elevations resembling the sepul- 
chral mounds of the Mound Builders; but it can not be asserted that 
they are not natural. If any examination has been made, it has not dis- 
closed any noteworthy archa'ological specimens, and few, if any, tiint 
arrow -heads, lance heads, stone axes, or fragments of pottery have been 
found."* After calling Mr. Holcombe's attention specially to this 
branch of inquiry he informed me, in the course of onr correspondence, 
that in all the region he had examined he had not seen an artificial 
earthen mound; and had met but few, if any, evidences of a pre exist- 
ent "stone age." Of the many residents on and near the Osage, from 
its mouth to its sources, to whom T have addressed my incpiiries, not 
one has seen an artificial eartheru mound there, and but few have 
found aborignal stone imi)lements of any description in that region. 
All agree that such evidences of prehistoric occupancy are almost to- 
tally absent.

an intelligent and scholarly man, who had devoted much time and 
thought to the study of American history and antiquities, and who per-

soujiUy inspected every locality ou the upper Osage that had beea in- 
habited by the Osage Indians, with the view of collecting reliable ma- 
terials for his "Centennial History of Vernon County" (published in 
187C), and to secure, if possible, relics of ancient Indian art for the Phila- 
deli)hia Exposition of that year, in writing to me says: "As far as my 
knowledge extends there are but very few evidences of prehistoric man 
existing in Vernon County. Excepting a few tlint arrow-points, I do 
not know of a stone implement of any kind, neither grooved ax, celt, 
or ornament, ever having been found here. Nor is there an artificial 
sepulchral mound in our county, though we have many magnificent 
natural mounds of geological origin. Absence of Indian burials here 
has often suggested to my mind the query, what did the Osages do 
with their dead? We know that they were a numerous tribe, and that 
this district was the central point of their territory for nearly, or quite, 
a century and a quarter; yet although I have searched all over the sites 
of the Big and Little Osage villages, and in every direction throughout 
the county, I have failed to find any indication of Indian burying 
grounds, or any isolated graves that could, with any degree of certainty, 
be attributed to the Indians. I am therefore of the opinion that with 
the exception of their distinguished men, these Indians cremated their 
dead. In my search for Indian relics here, in 1876, all that I found 
were brass and pewter ornaments, glass beads, fragments of gun flint- 
locks, broken iron and copper utensils, and crockery of French make. 
There are no Indian graves here on the crest of our ridges and bluffs, 
or on the top of our natural mounds, as is the case elsewhere through- 
out the Mississippi Valley, with but one known exception. A very noted 
chief of the Osages, named Pah-hus kah, or Pawhuska, but called by 
the early French "Cheveux Blanche," said to have been killed in a 
skirmish with the whites, was buried on the top of the big Bine Mound, 
and over his grave a large stone heap was erected by his people. Dr. 
Badger, an old settler here, says that on his arrival, in 1844:, this stone 
heap was a very conspicious landmark and could be seen from a great 
distance. At that time it was 8 or 9 feet high and about the same in 
diameter at its base. When I first saw it, in 18G7, there was still a por- 
tion of it plainly to be seen from the prairie in all directions; but in 1876 
there was not a vestige of it remaining.'' 

Of the death and burial of this chief Mr. Holcombe says, "The exact 
date of the death of old White Hair can not here be given. He died 
at his village in the northern part of this county, however, and was 
buried ou the summit of Blue Mound, in a stone sepulcher made for the 
occasion. It is probable that this was about the year 1824. His grave 
was afterward broken into by white vandals in search of treasure."* 

To the foregoing statements it may not be inappropriate to add the 
results of my own personal observations. During my residence of eight 
years in southwestern Missouri, 1853-1801, 1 traversed the entire valley

of the Osage River, from its junction with the Missouri to the extreme 
heads of the Little Osage and of the Marais des Cygnes, and was 
familiar with its entire southern water-shed west of the Niangua. And, 
though always a persistent relic hunter, 1 never found, or saw, or heard 
of having been found by others, in that time, or since, in all that region, 
exceeding a dozen Hint an^ow-points, and not one stone ax, or celt, or 
other implement in stone, or ornament of bone or shell, or any frag- 
ments of Indian pottery. The only burials presumably Indian I met 
with were on the east bank of Sac River, near the village of Orleans, 
in Polk County, Missouri. The perpendicular rocky cliff rises from the 
river bottom at that place 75 or 80 feet, and is capped with shelly siib- 
carboiiiferous limestone, overgrown with briars and stunted bushes. 
On the verge of this precipice I found, in 1853, five small cairns a few 
feet from each other, constructed of rough stones rudely laid up, in di- 
mensions 3i feet high and 3 or 4 feet in diameter. On opening them 
each was found to contain the fragments of a single human skeleton, 
much decayed, and broken in small pieces by the falling in of the loose 
stone covering. From the relative position of the bones, I inferred that 
the body had been placed upon the bare rock, in a squatting position, 
with the face to the west overlooking the river, and that the broken 
rocks of the surface had been piled up around it to protect it from 
destruction by wolves and vultures. The only work of art I discovered 
in or about the five stone heaps was a well-worn gun-tlint with one of 
the skeletons. I saw no artificial earthen mounds there of any descri])- 
tion. 

In treating specially of the history of Blue Mound Township, Mr. 
Holcombe says on page 539 of his " History of Vernon County : " "In 
many other graves in the mound [Blue Mound | there have been found 
mingled with human bones tomahawks, knives, arrow-points, sbell 
implements and ornaments, bone ear rings, beads of various materials, 
sizes, and shapes, and other curious articles. Some of these relics are 
apparently of such antiquity as to lead almost to the thought that the 
graves containing them may be those of the Mound Builders, or of 
some other prehistoric race; but this is not at all probable. The 
graves are undoubtedly those of Osages, who, as is well known, were 
in this country as early at least as the year 1700." 

I have not learned Mr. Holcombe's authority for the statement he 
makes in regard to the discovery of ''arrow-points, shell implements, 
and ornaments, bone ear-rings," etc., found in the graves on Blue 
jVIound. My investigations have failed to verify it. By persons who 
ha\e resided in that immediate vicinity at an early day I am informed 
that in years past, quite a number of graves were distinctly seen on 
the slopes of the Blue Mound; but as in dimensions, construction, ami 
relative position they exhibited the usual characteristics of an ordinary 
cemetery, and as none of them were opened to determine the question,

it was not known whether they inclosed the remains of Indians or white 
persons. And as to the relics, it is now not known that any of them 
were actually found in the graves; but they were found ou the surface 
of the grouiid there, and subsequently turned up by the plow abont 
the base of the mouud, as well as about the sites of the Big and Little 
Osiige villages — as Dr. Morerod states — and are to this day occasion- 
ally found there. But the "tomahawks" are made of iron, and the 
ear-rings of brass ; and if any implements or ornaments of bone or shell 
have been found associated with them, the reasonable conclusion is 
that they, too, were of French or English manufacture. 

Systematic investigation by adepts may yet discover the mortuary 
cnstoms of the Osages. Their cemeteries have perhaps not yet been 
found. They died, of course, but as yet we are ignorant of the disposi- 
tion of their corpses. The suggestion of Dr. Morerod that they prac- 
tised cremation is scarcely tenable, for the negative reasons that no 
mention of such an extraordinary custom is made by Dr. Tissenet, 
Eenaulr, or Lieutenant Pike; and that none of the crematories, or 
ancient tire-hearths ("altars"), have yet been found in the original 
Osage territory. In the absence of more accurate knowledge upon 
this point, it is not a violent presumption that these Indians — as the 
Pawnees, Dakotas, and other tribes of the plains have since been accus- 
tomed to do— placed their dead upon pole-scaffolds on the prairies, and 
in the branches of trees in the woods, as their final disposition, where 
the remains decayed, and in time were dispersed by the elements. 

Hunter, in his "Captivity," p. 300, says, of the Osages, "at or soon 
after burial, they cover the grave with stones, and for years after oc- 
casionally resort to it, and mourn over or recount the merits and vir- 
tues of its silent tenant." This was not perhaps their general custom ; 
but, in regard to the burial of Old White Hair, is strictly true. Mr. 
Holcombe confirms it in his statement: "For many years up to 1870 
the Osages made annual pilgrimages to the site of their ancient towns 
in this county, and of the graves of their ancestors and the tomb of the 
renowned chieftain, Pawhuska, on Blue Mound. Gathering about the 
mighty mound containing the ashes of their progenitors, they called to 
mind their virtues and lifting up their voices wept loudly and bitterly. 
Many citizens of the county have often heard them at their lamenta- 
tions. The Osages themselves called the Blue Mound the "Crying 
Mound" because it was to them a place of mourning and weeping." * I 
have seen it nowhere stated that the Osages conducted their lamenta- 
tions at any other locality excepting the Blue Mound, which towered 
above their princi[)al village; and this fact alone is a strong basis for 
for the supposition that about the apex of this majestic natural eleva- 
tion these Indians interred all of their distinguished chiefs; thus dis- 
posing of them, when dead, and of tlieir common people's corpses by 
diftert^nt methods. We know that old White Hair was buried there,

WERE THE OSAGES MOUND-BUILDERS? 595 

and it is reasonably certain that this was the mound pointed out to 
Major Sibley, by the "old Chief," as the burial place of "Jean Defoe."* 

The singular absence of stone and bone implements in the valley of 
the Osage can only be explained by the hypothesis that prior to its oc- 
cupancy by the Osage Indians it was a neutral ground, only occasion- 
ally visited by hunting- parties of Indians residing on the Missouri, to 
the north, and on the Arkansas, to the south ; in both of which local- 
ities evidences of long-continued tenancy before the knowledge of 
metals are quite abundant. It is altogether probable, too, that when 
the Osages abandoned their territory on the Missouri and removed to 
the headwaters of the Osage River — about the close of the seventeenth 
century — they had secured fire-arms and European implements and 
utensils, and had adopted many of the methods of life of their French 
visitors.! 

The manners, customs, and practices of these Indians before their 
migration to the mounds and streams of Vernon County can now only 
be conjectured; but there is no reason to doubt that in every respect 
they were identical with those of other pre-Columbian Indians of the 
Northwest. We are assured, however, that after that event in their his- 
tory they no longer employed stone as a material for weapons and tools; 
and they erected no mounds of earth as monuments over their dead, or 
for any other purpose. 

Br. Beck, author of the "Gazetteer" before mentioned, may have 
inspected the Osage Eiver personally before he published the statement 
that "Ancient works exist on this river, as elsewhere," and that "re- 
mains of fortifications and mounds are almost everywhere to be seen " 
there. And, if he did, it is not astonishing that he was led into such 
an error upon viewing the beautiful, faultless domes and terraces carved 
upon the great rockj'^ cliffs of the Osage and the Niangua by the ca- 
pricious elements ; or the isolated natural mounds in the prairie region 
beyond — enduring monuments, not of a by-gone people, but of a vastly 
remote glacial force. For when he wrote — sixty-seven years ago — arch- 
aH)logy had not become a science, and geology was but in its infancy. 

Nor is it surprising that Major Sibley, an intelligent and educated 
oificer of the Government, who resided lor some years at the base of 
the great Blue Mound, should have accepted, without doubt or question, 

*The name of this chief is here probably incorrectly writteu. At the period of 
Lieutenaut Pike's visit, in 1806, Cheveux Blanche was the head chief of the Bi^ 
Osages, and his son, Jean La Fou — as Pike wrote the name in his journal and official 
reports — was the second chief in authority. I have thought this orthography may 
possibly also bo erroneous ; because I I'emember, when a boy at my home near St. 
Louis, hearing the " eH(/«r7e>-s," recently returned from the Indian country, often 
mention a chief whom they called Jean Le Fou — " Mad," or "Crazy John" — on 
account of his peculiar eccentricities. It may be that Jean Defoe, Jean La Fon and 
Jean Le Fou were identical. 

tAs early as 1G73 Marquette found Indians on the Mississippi, below the Ohio, well 
supplied with guns, powder, glass bottles, iron hoes, knives, hatchets, etc.

THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE AS EXEMPLIFIED IN THE 
ART OF WEIGEIING AND MEASURING.* 



By Prof. William Haukness, U. S. Naval Observaiur!/, 

Two centuries ago the world was just beginning to awaken from an 
intellectual lethargy which had lasted a thousand years. Daring all 
that time the children had lived as their parents before them, the 
mechanical arts had been at a standstill, and the dicta of Aristotle had 
been the highest authority in science. But now the night of mediteval- 
ism was approaching its end, and the dawn of modern i^rogress was at 
hand. Galileo had laid the foundation for accurate clocks, by discover- 
ing the isochronism of the simple pendulum; had proved that under the 
action of gravity, light bodies fall as rapidly as heavy ones; had invented 
the telescope and with it discovered the spots on the sun, the moun- 
tains on the moon, the satellites of Jupiter, and the so-called triple 
character of Saturn ; and, after rendering himself immortal by his advo- 
cacy of the Copernican system, had gone to his grave, aged, blind, and 
full of sorrows. His contemporary, Kepler, had discovered the laws — 
which while history endures, will associate his name with the theory 
of planetary motion ; and he also had passed away. The first Cassini 
was still a young man, his son was a little child, and his grandson and 
great-grandson, all of whom were destined to be directors of the Paris 
Observatory, were yet unborn. The illustrious Huyghens, the discov^- 
erer of Saturn's rings, and the father of the undulatory theory of light, 
was in the zenith of his powers. The ingenious Hooke was a little 
younger, and Newton, towering above them all, had recently invented 
riaxions, and on the 28th of Ajuil, 1G86, had presented his Principia 
to the Royal Society of London and given the theory of gravitation to 
the world. Bradley, who discovered nutation and the aberration of 
light; Franklin, the statesman and philosopher, who first drew the

much in perfecting algebra, the calculus, and the lunar theory; Laplace,

tion of the mecbauical theory of heat; Dalton, the author of the atomic 
theory upon which all chemistry rests; and Bessel, the greatest of mod- 
ern astronomers, — these and others almost as illustrious, whom we can 
not even name to-night, were still in the womb of time. 

Pure science first felt the effects of the new intellectual life, and it 
was more than a century later before the arts yielded to its intluence. 
Then came Hargreaves, the inventor of the spinning-jenny; Ark- 
wright, the inventor of the cotton-spinning frame; Watt, who gave us 
the condensing steam-engine ; Jacquard, the inventor of the loom for 
weaving figured stuffs; Murdock, the originator of gas-lighting; Evans, 
the inventor of the high-pressure steam-engine ; Fulton, the father of 
steam navigation ; Trevithick, who ranks very near Watt and Evans in 
perfecting the steam-engine; and Stephenson, the father of railroads. 
If now we add the names of those who have given us the telegraph, to 
wit. Gauss, the eminent physicist and the greatest mathematician of 
the present century; Weber, Wheatstone, and Henry, all famous phj\s- 
icists, and Morse, the inventor and engineer, we have before us the 
demigods who have transforined the ancient into the modern world, 
given us machinery which has multiplied the productive power of the 
human race many fold, annihilated time and space, and bestowed upon 
toiling millions a degree of comfort and luxury which was unknown to 
kings and emperors of old. 

The discoveries and inventions of the last two centuries have so far 
exceeded all others within historic times, that we are amply justified in 
calling this an age of amazing progress, and under the circumstances 
a little self-glorification is pardonable, perhaps even natural. The 
weekly and monthly records of scientific events which appear in so 
many newspapers and magazines are the immediate result of this, and 
the great increase of ephemeral scientific literature has led multitudes 
of educated people to believe that such records represent actual prog- 
ress. The multiplication of bricks facilitates the building of houses, but 
does not necessarily improve architecture. Similarly, the multiplica- 
tion of minor investigations improves our knowledge of details, but 
rarely afi'ects the great philosophic theories upon which science is 
founded. The importance of human actions is measured by the degree 
in which they affect human thought, and the only way of permanently 
aftfccting scientific thought is by modifying or extending scientific 
theories. The men who do that, are neither numerous, nor do they re- 
quire weekly paragraphs to record their deeds ; but their names are 
honored by posterity. Even in this golden age the advance of science 
is not steady, but is made by spasmodic leaps and bounds. Mere 
scientific brick-making, commonly called progress, is always the order 
of the day until some genius startles the world by a discovery affecting 
accepted theories. Then every effort is directed in the new line of 
thought until it is measurably worked out, and after that brick-making 
again resumes its place. While the progress in two centuries has been

immense, the progress in a week or a moutli is usually almost nil. 
Optimism h;is its uses in many departments of human atitairs, but 
science should be cool and dispassionate, having regard only lor the 
truth. To make a trustworthy estimate of the actual state of the whole 
vast realm of science would be a task beyond the powers of any one 
man; but perhaps it will not be amiss to spend the time at our disposal 
this evening in briefly reviewing the recent progress and present con- 
dition of the fundamental processes upon which the exact sciences 
rest;— I allude to the methods of weighing and measuring. 

Physical science deals with many quantities, but they are all so re- 
lated to each other that almost every one of them can be expressed in 
terms of three fundamental units. As several systems of such units 
are possible, it is important to select the most convenient, and the con- 
siderations which guide us in that respect are the following: 

(1) The quantities selected should admit of very accurate comparison 
with other quantities of the same kind. 

(2) Such comparisons should be possible at all times and in all places. 

(3) The processes necessary for making such comparisons should be 
easy and direct. 

(4) The fundamental units should be such as to admit of easy defi- 
nitions and simple dimensions for the various derived units. 

Scientific men have long agreed that these requirements are best 
fulfilled by adopting as the fundamental units, a definite length, a 
definite mass, and a definite interval of time. Length is an element 
which can be very accurately measured and copied, but it must be 
defined by reference to some concrete material standard, as for ex- 
ample, a bar of metal, and as all substances expand and contract with 
changes of temperature, it is necessary to state the temperature at 
which the standard is correct. A standard of mass, consisting of a 
piece of platinum, quartz, or other material not easily affected by 
atmospheric influences, probably fulfills the conditions set forth above 
better than any other kind of magnitude. Its comparison with 
other bodies of approximately equal mass is effected bj' weighing, 
and as that is among the most exact of all laboratory operations, ver^^ 
accurate copies of the standard can be made, and they can be carried 
from place to place with little risk of injury. Time is also an 
element which can be measured with extreme precision. The imme- 
diate instruments of measurement are clocks and chronometers, but 
their running is checked by astronomical observations and the ulti- 
mate standard is the rotation of the earth itself. 

It is important to note that the use of three fundamental units is 
simply a matter of convenience and not a theoretical necessity, for the 
unit of mass might be defined as that which at unit distance would 
generate in a material point unit velocity in unit time; and thus we 
should have a perfectly general system of measurement based upon only 
two fundamental units, namely, those of space and time. Such a sys- 
tem is quite practicable in astronomy, but can not yet be applied with

accura(;y to ordinary terrestrial purposes. Accoriliiiy- to the law of

Mass = Acceleration x (Distance)'-* 

and as in the case of the earth we can measure the quantities on the 
right-hand side of that equation with considerable accuracy, we can sat- 
isfactorily determine the earth's mass in terms of the supposed unit. 
That suffices for the needs of astronomy, but for other scientific and 
commercial purposes a standard of mass having a magnitude of about 
a pound is necessary, and as two such masses can be compared with 
each other from five to ten thousand times more accurately than either 
of them can be determined in terms of the supposed unit, three funda- 
mental units are preferable to two. 

The Chaldeans, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans all seem 
to have had systems of weights and measures based upon tolerably defi' 
uite standards, but after the decline of the Roman Empire these stand 
ards seem to have been forgotten, and in the beginning of the sixteenth 
century the human body had so far become the standard of measure- 
ment that the units in common use, as for example, the foot, palm, etc., 
were frequently taken directly from it. The complete table of measures 
of length was then as follows: The breadth (not the length) of four 
barley corns make a digit, or finger breadth ; four digits make a palm 
(measured across the middle joints of the fingers); four palmiS are one 
foot ; a foot and a half is a cubit ; ten palms, or two feet and a half, are 
a step; two steps, or five feet, are a pace; ten feet are a perch; one 
hundred and twenty-five paces are an Italic stadium ; eight stadia, or 
one thousand paces, are an Italic mile; four Italic miles are a German 
mile; and five Italic miles are a Swiss mile It was then the practice 
to furnish standards of length in books by printing in them lines a 
foot or a palm long, according to the size of the page, and from these 
and other data it appears that the foot then used on the continent of 
Europe had a length of about ten English inches. 

In England the first attempts at scientific accuracy in matters of 
Measurement date from the beginning of the seventeenth century, when 
John Greaves, who must be considered as the earliest of the scientific 
metrologists, directed attention to the difference between the Roman 
and English foot by tolerably accurate determinations of the former, 
and also attempted the investigation of the Roman weights. He was 
followed by Dr. Edward Bernard, who wrote a treatise on ancient 
weights and measures about 1685, and towards the end of the century 
the measurements of the length of a degree by Picard and J. D. Cassini 
awakened the attention of the French to the importance of rigorously 
exact standards. In considering the progress of science with respect 
to standards of length, we may safely confine our inquiries to the En- 
glish yard and the French toiseand meter, for during the last two hun- 
dred years they have been almost the only standards adopted in scien- 
tific operations. 



THE ART OF WKIGIIING AND MEASURING. 601 

The En.i;lisli measures of lenj;tli have come down from the Saxons, 
but the ohiest standards now (existing are the exchequer yards of Henry 
Vir (141)0)* and Elizabeth (lo88).t Tliese are both brass end measures, 
the former being an octagonal rod about half an inch in diameter, very 
coarsely made, and as rudely divided into inches on the right-hand end 
and into sixteenths of a yard on the left-hand end ; the latter, a scjuare 
rod with sides about half an inch wide, also divided into sixteenths of 
a yard and provided with a brass bed having end pieces between which 
the yard fits. One end of the bed is divided into inches and half inches. 
Francis Baily, who saw this Elizabethan standard in 1836, si)eaks of it 
as " this curious instrument, of which it is impossible, at the present 
day, to speak too much in derision or contempt. A common kitchen 
poker, tiled at the ends in the rudest manner by the most bungling 
workman, would make as good a standard. It has been broken 
asunder, and the two pieces have been dove-tailed together, but so 
badly that the joint is nearly as loose as that of a pair of tongs. The 
date of this fracture I could not ascertain, it having occurred beyond 
the memory or knowledge of any of the officers at the Exchequer. And 
yet, till within the last ten years, to the disgrace of this country, copies 
of this measure have been circulated all over Europe and America, 
with a parchment document accompanying them (charged with a stamp 
that costs £3 10s. exclusive of official fees) certifying that they are true 
copies of the English standard.^^^ 

In the year 1742 certain members of the Royal Society of London, 
and of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris, proposed that, in order 
to facilitate a comparison of the scientific operations carried on in the 
two countries, accurate standards of the measures and weights of both 
should be prepared and preserved in the archives of each of these 
societies. This proposition having been approved, ^Ir. George Graham, 
at the instance of the Royal Society, had two substantial brass rods 
made, upon which he laid oft', with the greatest care, the length of 
three English feet from the standard yard kept at the Tower of London. 
These two rods, together with a set of troy weights, were then sent 
over to the Paris Academy, which body, in like manner, had the measure 
of a French half toise set off upon the rods, and keeping one, as previously 
agreed, returned the other, together with a standard weightof two marcs, 
to the Royal Society. In 1835, Baily declared this copy of the half 
toise to be of little value, because the original toise etalon was of iron 
and the standard temperature in France dift'ered from that in England. § 
In his opinion the French should hav^e sent over an iron half toise in 
exchange for the English brass yard, but this criticism loses much of 
its force when it is remembered that in 1742 neither England nor France

liacl fixed upon a temperature at whicli tbeir standards were to be re- 
garded as of the true leugtb. On the return of the rod from Paris Mr. 
Graham caused Jonathan Sisson to divide the English yard and the 
French half toise each into three equal parts, after which the rod was 
deposited in the archives of the Koyal Society, where it still remains.* 
Objection having been made that the original and legal standard yard 
of England was not the one at the Tower, but the Elizabethian stand- 
ard at the Exchequer, the Royal Society requested Mr. Graham to com- 
pare his newly made scale with the latter standard, and on Friday, 
April 22, 1743, he did so in the presence of a committee of seven mem- 
bers of the Royal Society. In the following week the same gentlemen 
compared the Royal Society's scale with the standards at Guildhall and 
the Tower, and also with the standards of the Clock-makers' Company. 
These comparisons having shown that the copy of the Tower yard upon 
the Koyal Society's scale was about 0.0075 of an inch longer than the 
standard at the Exchequer. Mr. Graham inscribed upon the Royal So- 
ciety's scale a copy of the latter standard also, marking it with the 
letters Exch., to distinguish it from the former, which was marked E. 
(English), and from the half toise which was marked F. (French). t 

In the year 1758 the House of Commons appointed a committee to 
inquire into the original standards of weights and measures of England ; 
and under instructions from that committee, the celebrated instru- 
ment maker, John Bird, prepared two brass rods, respecting which the 
committee speak as follows in their report: "And having those rods, 
together with that of the Royal Society laid in the same place, at the 
receipt of the Exchequer, all night with the standards of length kept 
there, to prevent the variation which the difference of air might make 
upon them, they the next morning compared them all and by the means 
of beam compasses brought by Mr. Bird found them to agree as near 
as it was possible." J One of these rods was arranged as a matrix for 
testing end measures, and the other was a line measure which the com- 
mittee recommended should be made the legal standard of England, 
and which has since been known as Bird's standard of 1758. Respect- 
ing the statement that after lying together all night the rods were all 
found to agree as near as it was possible, Baily says: "This is some- 
what remarkable, and requires further explanation, which unfortu- 
nately can not now be accurately obtained. For it is notorious that 
the measure of the yard of the Royal Society's scale differs very con- 
siderably from the standard yard at the Exchequer: - - - Owing 
to this singular confusion of the lengths of the measures, which does 
not appear to have been unravelled by any subsequent Committee, it 
has happened that the Imperial standard yard - - - has been 
assumed nearly 1 -^ 140 of an inch longer than the ancient measure of 
the kingdom."§ There is little difiHculty in surmising what Bird did. 
The Exchequer standard consisted of a rod and its matrix. The Royal

Society's coininittce aesuuu'd tlie rod to be tlie true stuudard of 30 
iuclies, and upou that assuuiption Graham's measurements gave for the 
lenjuth of the matrix 30.0102 inches, and for tlie length of the Royal 
Society's yard 30.0075 inches. The Parliamentary Committee of 1758 
l)robably assumed the standard to consist of the rod an-.l matrix 
together, which seems the better view; and by laying the rod in its 
matrix and measuring to the joint between them Bird would have got 
a length of about 36.0051 inches. The mean between that and 36.0075 
would be 36.0063, which differs very little from the length of Bird's 
standard resulting from Sir George Shuckburgh's measurements. 
Thus the committee's statement is justified, and there has been no falsi- 
fication of the ancient standards. 

On December 1, 1758, Parliament created another committee on 
weights and measures which in April, 1759, repeated the recommenda- 
tion that Bird's standard of 1758 should be legalized, and further recom- 
mended that a copy of it shouhl be made and dei)osited in some public 
office, to be used only on special occasions.* The copy was made by 
Bird in 1760, but owing to circumstances entirely unconnected with 
the subject, no legislation followed for sixty-four years. 

The Koyal Commission appointed during the reign of George III to 
consider the subject of weights and measures made its first report on 
June 24, 1819, and therein recommended the adoption of the standard 
of length which had been used by General Roy in measuring the base 
on Hounslow Heath ;t but in a second report, made July 13, 1820, they 
wrote: " We - - - have examined, since our last report, the rela- 
tion of the best authenticated standards of length at present in exist- 
ence, to the instruments employed for measuring the base on Hounslow 
Heath, and in the late trigonometrical operations : — But we have very 
unexpectedly discovered, that an error has been committed in the con- 
struction of some of these instruments.^ We are therefore obliged to 
recur to the originals which they were intended to represent; and we 
have found reason to prefer the Parliamentary standard executed by 
Bird in 1760, which we had not before received, both as being laid down 
in the most accurate manner, and as the best agreeing with the most 
extensive comparisons, which have been hitherto executed by various 
observers, and circulated through Europe ; and in particular with the 
scale employed by th.e late Sir George Shuckburgh."§ 

Accordingly, when in 1824, Parliament at length took action, Bird's 
standard of 1760 was adopted instead of that of 1758. The former be- 
ing a copy of a copy, its selection as a national standard of length seems 
so singular that the circumstances which brought about that result 
should scarcely be passed over in silence. Bird had a very accurate 
brass scale 90 inches long, which he used in all his dividing operations, 
whether upon circles or straight lines, and which Dr. Maskdyne said 
was 0.001 of an inch shorter on three feet than Graham's Royal Society

yard E.* In the year 17!)U, or 1793, the celebrated Edward Troughtou 
made for himself a 5 foot scale, which conformed to Bird's, and which 
he afterwards used in laying down the divisions of the various instru- 
ments that passed through his hands. This was the original of all 
the standard scales he ever made, and at the beginning of the present 
century he believed these copies, which were made by the aid of micro- 
meter microscopes, to be so exact that no variations could possibly be 
detected in them either from the original or from each other. Among 
the earliest of the scales so made by Troughtou was the one used by Sir 
George Shuckburgh in 1796-'98 in his important scientific operations 
for the improvement of the standards. Subsequently, the length of the 
meter was determined by comparison with this scale and with the 
supposed fac-simile of it made by Troughtou for Professor Pictet, of 
Geneva; and thus it happened that on the continent of Europe all 
measures were converted into English units by a reference to Sir 
George Shuckburgh's scale. The Royal Commission of 1819 believed 
Bird's standard of 1760 to be identical with Shuckburgh's scale, and 
they legalized it rather than the standard of 1758, in order to avoid 
disturbing the value of the English yard which was then generally 
accepted for scientific purposes. 

There are yet four other scales of importance in the history of English 
standards, namely: The brass 5-foot scale made for Sir George Shuck- 
burgh by Troughton in 179G; two iron standard yards, marked lA. and 
2A, made for the English Ordnance Survey department by Messrs. 
Troughton and Simms in 1826-'27, and the Royal Society's sfandard 
yard, constructed by Mr. George DollonJ, under the direction of Cap- 
tain Henry Kater, in 1831. 

Bearing in mind the preceding history, the genesis of the present 
English standard yard may be thus summarized : In 1 742 Graham trans- 
ferred to a bar made for the Royal Society a length which he intended 
should be that of the Tower yard, but which was really intermediate 
between the Exchequer standard yard of Elizabeth and its matrix. 
That length he marked with the letter E, and although destitute of legal 
authority, it was immediately accepted as the scientific standard and 
was copied b3' the famous instrument-makers of the time with all the 
accuracy then attainable. Thus it is in fact the prototype to which ail 
the accurate scales made in England between 1742 and 1850 can be 
traced. Bird's standard of 1758 was compared with the Exchequer 
standard and with the Royal Society's yard E, and was of a length be- 
tween the two. Bird's standard of 17G0, legalized as the Imperial 
standard in June, 1824, was copied from his standard of 1758. After 
becoming the Imperial standard, Bird's standard of 1760 was compared 
with Sir George Shuckburgh's scale by Captain Kater in 1830, and by 
Mr. Francis Baily in 1834; with the Ordnance yards lA and 2A in 1834 
by Lieutenant Murphy, R. E., Lieutenant Johnson, R. N., and Messrs.

F. Baily aud Doukin ; aud with Kater's Royal Society jard by Captain 
Kater in 1831. On October 16, 1834, the Imperial standard (Bird's 
standard of lldO) was destroyed by the burning of the houses of Parlia- 
ment, in which it was lodged, and very soon thereafter the Lords of the 
Treasury took measures to recover its length. Preliminary inquiries 
were begun on May 11, 1838, and on June 20, 1813, they resulted in the 
appointment of a commission to superintend the construction of new 
Parliamentary standards of length aud weight; among whose members 
the Astronomer Royal (now Sir George B. Airy), Messrs. F. Baily, 
II. Sheepshanks, and Prof. W. H. Miller were prominent. The labori- 
ous investigations and experiments carried out by that commission can- 
not be described here, but it will suffice to say that for determining the 
true length of the new standard Mr. Sheepshanks employed a pro- 
visional yard, marked upon a new brass bar designated " Brass 2," 
which he compared as accurately as possible with Sir George Shuck- 
burgh's scale, the two Ordnance yards, and Kater's Royal Society yard. 
The results in terms of the lost Imperial standard were as follows : 
Brass bar 2 = 36. 000084 from coinparisou with Shuckbnrgh's scale, 0-36 inch. 

36. 000280 from comparison with Shuckburgh's scale, 10-46 inch, 

36. 000:503 from comparison with tlie Ordnance yard, lA. 

36.000275 from comparison witli the Ordnance yard, 2A. 

36. 000229 from Captain Kater's Royal Society yard. 

Mean = 36. 000234 

Respecting this mean Mr. Sheepshanks wrote: "This should be 
pretty IfiBar the truth; but I prefer 36.00025, if in such a matter such a 
difference be worth notice. I propose, therefore, in constructing the 
new standard to assume that — 

" Brass bar 2= 36.00025 inches of lost Imperial standard at 62° Fahr." 
And upon that basis the standard now in use was constructed.* 

Turning now to the French standards of length, it is known that the 
ancient toise de magons of Paris was probably the toise of Charle- 
magne (A. D. 712 to 811), or at least of some Emperor Charles, and 
that its ('talon was situated in the court-yard of the old Chatelet, on the 
outside of one of the pillars of the building. It still existed in 1714, 
but entirely falsified by the bending of the upper part of the pillar. 
In 1668 the ancient toise of the masons was reformed by shortening it 
five lines ; but whether this reformation was an arbitrary change, or 
merely a change to remedy the effects of long use and restore the etalou 
to conformity with .some more carefully j)reserved standard, is not 
quite clear, t These old e^a/on.s* were iron bars having their two ends 
turned up at right angles so as to form talons, and the standardizing of 
end measures was effected by fitting tliem between the talons. Being 
placed on the outside of some public building, they were exposed to 
wear from constant use, to rust, aud even to intentional injury by ma-

606 MISCELLANEOUS PAPEKS. 

licious persons. Under such conditions every etalon would sooner or 
later become too long and require shortening. 

Respecting the ancient toise of the masons there are two contradict- 
ory stories. Ou December 1, 1714, La Hire showed to the French 
Academy what he characterized as "a very ancient instrument of 
mathematics, which has beeu made by one of our most accomplished 
workman with very great care, where the foot is marked, and which has 
served to re-establish the toise of the GhTitelet, as I have been informed 
by our old mathematicians."* Forty-four years later, ou July 29, 1758, 
La Condamine stated to the Academy that " We know only by traditiou 
that to adjust the length of the new standard, the width of the arcade 
or interior gate of the grand pavilion, which served as an entrance 
to the old Louvre, on the side of the rue Fromenteau, was used. This 
opening, according to the plan, should have been twelve feet wide. Half 
of it was taken to fix the length of the new toise, which thus became 
five lines shorter than the old one."t Of these two contradictory state- 
ments that of La Hire seems altogether most trustworthy, and the 
ordinary rules of evidence indicate that it should be accepted to the 
exclusion of the other. 

Li 1G68 the Etalon of the new toise, since known as the toise-etalon 
du Clidtelet, was fixed against the wall at the foot of the staircase of 
the grand Chiitelet de Paris, by whom or at what season of the year 
is not known. Strange as it now seems, this standard (very roughly 
made, exposed in a public place for use or abuse b^' everybody, 
liable to rust, and certain to be falsified by constant wear) was actually 
used for adjusting the toise of Picard, that of Cassini, the toise of Peru 
and of the North, that of La Caille, that of Mairau — in short, all the 
toises employed by the French in their geodetic operations during the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The lack of any other recog- 
nized standard made the use of this one imperative; but the French 
academicians were well aware of its defects and took precautions to 
guard against them. 

The first toise copied from the etalon of the Chatelet for scientific 
purposes was that used by Picard in his measurement of a degree of 
the meridian between Paris and Amiens. | It was made about the 
year 1668, and would doubtless have become the scientific standard of 
France had it not unfortunately disappeared before the degree measure- 
ments of the eighteenth century were begun. The second toise copied 
from the etalon of the Chatelet for scientific purposes was that used by 
Messrs. Godin, Bouguer, and La Condamine for measuring the base of 
their arc of the meridian in Peru. This toise, since known as the toise 
du Perou, was made by the artist Langlois under the immediate direc- 
tion of Godin in 1735, and is still preserved at the Paris Observatory.§ 
It is a rectangul ar bar of polished wrought iron, having a breadth of 
1.58 binglish inches and a thickness of 0.30 of an inch. All the other •

toises used by the Academy in the eighteenth century, were compared 
with it, and ultiiuately it was made the legal standard of France by 
an order of Louis XV, dated May IG, 1766. As the toise of Peru is tlie 
oldest authentic copy of the toise of the Chatelet, the effect of this order 
was simply to perpetuate the earliest known state of that ancient 
standard. 

The metric system originated from a motion made by Talleyrand in 
the National Assembly of France, in 1790, referring the question of the 
formation of an improved system of weights and measures, based upon 
a natural constant, to the French Academy of Sciences; and the prelim- 
inary work was intrusted to five of the most eminent members of that 
Academy, — namely, Lagrange, Laplace, Borda, Monge, and Condorcet. 
On March 19, 1791, these gentlemen, together with Lalande, presented 
to the Academy a report containing the complete scheme of the metric 
system. In pursuance of the recommendations in that report the law 
of March 26, 1791, was enacted for the construction of the new system, 
and the Academy of Sciences was charged with the direction of the 
necessary operations. Those requisite for the construction of a standard 
of length were: 

(1) The determination of the difference of latitude between-Dunkirk 
and Barcelona. 

(2) The re-measurement of the ancient bases which had served for 
the measurement of a degree at the latitude of Paris, and for making 
the map of France. 

(3) The verification by new observations of the series of triangles em- 
ployed for measuring the meridan, and the prolongation of them as far 
as Barcelona, 

This work was intrusted to M^chain and Delambre, who carried it 
on during the seven years from 1791 to 1798, notwithstanding many 
great difficulties and dangers. The unit of length adopted in their 
operations was the toise of Peru, and from the arc of 9^ 40' 45" actually 
measured, they inferred the length of an arc of the meridian extending 
from the equator to the pole to be 5,130,740 toises. As the meter was 
to be one ten millionth of that distance, its length was made 0.5130740 
of a toise, or, in the language of the committee, 443.296 lines of the toise 
of Peru at a temperature of 13° Reaumur (16^ C. or 61^^ Fahr.).* 

Before attempting to estimate how accurately the standards we have 
been considering were inter-compared it will be well to describe briefly 
the methods by which the comparisons were effected. In 1742 Graham 
used the only instruments then known for the purpose, — namely, very 
exact beam compasses of various kinds, one having parallel jaws' for 
taking the lengtlis of the standard rods, another with rounded cads for 
taking the lengths of the hollow beds, and still another having tine 
[)oints in the usual manner. The jaws, or points, of all these instru- 
ments were movable by micrometer screws having heads divided to show

the eight huudredth part of an inch directly, and the tenth of that 
quantity by estimation; but Mr. Graham did not consider that the 
measurements could be depended upon to a greater accuracy than one 
sixteen-hundredth of an inch.* 

Troughton is generally regarded as the author of the application of 
micrometer microscopes to the comparison of standards of length, but 
the earliest record of their use for that purpose is by Sir George 
Shuckburgh in his work for the improvement of the standards ot 
weight and measure, in 1796-'98.f Since then their use has been gen- 
eral; first, because they are more accurate than beam compasses, and 
second, because they avoid the injury to standard scales which neces- 
sarily results from placing the points of beam compasses upon their 
graduations. As the objective of the microscope forms a magnified 
image of the standard, upon which the micrometer wires are set by the 
aid of the eye-piece, it is evident that in order to reduce the effect of 
imperfections in the micrometer, the objective should have the largest 
practicable magnifying power. To show the progress in that direction 
the optical constants of the microscopes, by means of which some of the 
most important standards have been compared, are given in the accom- 
panying table :

Note.— The magnifying power of Sir George Shuckbnrgh's microscope seems to be 
referred to a distance of 12 inches for distinct vision. The powers inclosed in paren- 
theses are estimated upon the assumption that the respective micrometer screws had 
one hundred threads per inch. 

In the memoirs of the French Academy, nothing is said respecting the 
method adopted by the Academicians for comparing their various toises ; 
but in his astronomy, Lalande states that the comparisons were efl'ected 
partly by beam compasses, and partly by superposing the toises upon 
each other and examining their ends, both by touch and with magnifs^- 
ing-glasses; they being all end standards.| For the definitive adjust- 
ment of the length of their meters, which were also end standards, the 
French Metric Commission used a lever comparator by Lenoir.

THE ART OF WEIGHING AND MEASURING 609 

In 1742 (Iraham used beaui compasses, which he considered trust- 
worthy to 0.00062 of an inch, in comparing standards of length ; but at 
that time the French Academicians made their comparisons of toises 
only to one twentieth or one thirtieth of a line, say 0.00300 of an inch, 
and it was not until 1758 that La Condamine declared they should be 
compared to 0.01 of a line, or 0.00089 of an English inch '•'if our senses 
aided by the most perfect instruments can attain to that."* Half a 
century later, ten times that accuracy was attained by the lever com- 
parator of Lenoir, which was regarded as trustworthy to 0.000077 of an 
iuch.t 

The heads of micrometer microscopes are usually divided into one 
hundred equal parts, and if we regard one of these parts as the least 
reading of a microscope, then in 1797, Sir George Shuckburgh's micro- 
scopes read to one ten thousandth of an inch ; and the least reading 
of microscopes made since that date has varied from one twenty thou- 
sandth to one thirty-five thousandth of an inch. A few investigators, 
among whom may be mentioned Prof. W. A. Rogers, of Colby Uni- 
versity, hav€ made the least reading of their microscopes as small as 
one ninety thousandth of an inch, but it is doubtful if there is any ad- 
vantage in so doing. At the present day the errors committed in com- 
paring standards arise, not from lack of power in the microscopes, but 
from the difficulty of determining sufficiently exactly the temperature 
of the standard bars, and the effect of flexure upon the position of their 
graduations. In order to ascertain the length of a three-foot standard 
with an error not exceeding 0.000020 of an inch, its temperature must 
be known to 0.06° Fahr. if it is of brass, or to O.OQo Fah. if it is of iron. 
To get thermometers that will indicate their own temperature to that 
degree of accuracy is by no means easy, but to determine the tempera- 
ture of a bar from their readings is far more difficult. Again, we im 
agine the length of our standards to follow their temperature rigorously, 
but what proof is there that such is the case? If we determine the 
freezing point of an old thermometer, then raise it to the temperature 
of boiling water, and immediately thereafter again determine its freez- 
ing point, we invariably find that the freezing point has fallen a little; 
and we explain this by saying that the glass has taken a set, from which it 
requires time to recover. Is it not probable that an effect similar in 
kind, although less in degree, occurs in all solids when their tempera- 
ture is varying ? When we look at the highly polished terminals of 
an end standard we are apt to regard them as mathematical surfaces, 
separated by an interval which is perfectly definite, and which could 
be measured with infinite precision if we only had the necessary instru- 
mental appliances ; but is that a correct view ? The atomic theory 
answers emphatically. No. According to it, all matter consists of 
atoms, or molecules, of a perfectly definite size, and with definite inter-

vals between them ; bat even if that is denied, the evidence is now 
overwhelming that matter is not homogeneous, but possesses a grain 
of some kind, regularly repeated at intervals which can not be greater 
than one two millionth nor less than one four-hundred millionth of an 
inch. Accordingly, we must picture our standard bar as a conglomer- 
ation of grains of some kind or other, having magnitudes of the order 
specified, and all in ceaseless motion, the amplitude of which depelids 
upon the temperature of the bar. To our mental vision the polished 
terminals are therefore like the surface of a pot of boiling water, and 
we recognize that there must be a limit to the accuracy with which the 
interval between them can be measured. As a basis for estimating 
how near this limit we have approached it will suffice to say that for 
fifty years past it has been customary to state comparisons of standards 
of length to one one-millionth of an inch. Nevertheless, most authori- 
ties agree that although one one-hundred thousandth of an inch can 
be distinguished in the comjiarators, one twenty five thousandth of an 
inch is about the limit of accuracy attainable in comparing standards. 
Possibly such a limit may be reached under the most favorable circum- 
stances, but in the case of the yard and the meter, which are standard 
at different temperatures, the following values of the meter by observers 
of the highest repute render it doubtful if anything like that accuracy 
has yet been attained.*

The earliest standard of English weight of which we have any very 
definite knowledge is the mint T)ound of the Tower of London. It 
weighed 5,400 troy grains, and the coinage was regulated by it up to 
the year 1527, when it was abolished in favor of the troy pound of 
5,7G0 grains. Contemporaneously with the tower pound there was also 
the merchant's pound, whose exact weight is now involved in so much 
doubt that it is impossible to decide whether it consisted of 6,750 or of 
7,200 grains. The tower pound and the troy pound were used for 
weighing only gold, silver, and drugs, while all other commodities were 
weighed by the merchant's pound until the thirteenth or fourteenth 
century, and after that by the avoirdupois pound. It is not certainlj^ 
known when the troy and avoirdupois i)Ounds were introduced into 
England, and there is no evidence of any relation between them when 
they first became standards. The present avoirdupois pound can be 
clearly proved to be of similar weight to the standard avoirdupois pound 
of Edward III (A. D. 1327-1377), and there is good reason for believing 
that no substantial change has occurred either in its weight or in that 
of the troy pound since their respective establishment as standards in 
England.

THE ART OF WEIGHING AND MEASURING. Gil 

The oldest standard weights now existing in the Euglisb^rcbives date 
from the reign of (Jiioen Elizabeth, and consist of a set of bell-shaped 
avoirdupois weights of oG, 28, and 14 pounds, made in 1582, and 7, 4, 2, 
and 1 pounds, made in 1588; a set of flat circular avoirdupois weights 
of 8, 4, 2, and 1 pounds, and 8, 4, 2, 1, .J, ^, ^, and -^,. ounces, made in 
1588; and a set of cup-shaped troy weights, fitting one within the 
other, of 256, 128, G4, 32, IG, 8, 4, 2, 1, ^, i, i (hollow), and J (solid) 
ounces, also made in 1588.* All these standards were constructed by 
order of Queen Elizabeth, under the direction of a jury composed of 
eighteen merchants and eleven goldsmiths of London ; the avoirdupois 
weights being adjusted according to an ancient standard of 56 pounds, 
remaining in the Exchequer from the time of Edward Til; and the 
troy weights being adjusted according to the ancient standard in Gold- 
smiths' Hall.t 

In view of the fact that the weight mentioned in all the old acts of 
Parliament from the time of Edward I (A. T>. 1274-1307) is universally 
admitted to be troy weight, the Parliamentary Committee of 1758, 
appointed to inquire into the original standards of weights and meas- 
ures in England, recommended that the troy pound should be made the 
unit or standard by which the avoirdupois and other weights should be 
regulated ; and by their order three several troy pounds of soft gun metal 
were very carefully adjusted under the direction of Mr. Joseph Harris, 
who was then assay master of the mint. To ascertain the proper mass 
for these pounds the committee caused Messrs. Harris and Gregory, of 
the mint, to perform the following operations in their presence: J 

First. In the before-mentioned set of troy weights, made in 1588, 
which were then the Exchequer standard, each weight, from that of 4 
ounces up to that of 250 ounces, was compared successively with the 
sum of all the smaller weights ; and by a process for which no valid 
reason can be assigned § it was concluded from these weighings that the 
troy pound composed of the 8 and 4 ounce weights was 1^ grains too 
light. 

Second. The aforesaid 8 and 4 ounce weights of the Exchequer were 
compared with five other authoritative troy pounds, four of which be- 
longed to the mint and one to Mr. li'reeman, who, like his father before 
him, was scale-maker to the mint, and from the mean of these weigh- 
ings it aj)i)eared that the sum of the Exchequer 8 and 4 ounce weights 
was one grain too light. 

The committee adopted the mean between the latter result and that 
which they had deduced from the Exchequer weights alone, § and ac- 
cordingly Mr. Harris made each of his three troy pounds 3 ^ grains 
heavier than the sum of the Exchequer 8 and 4 ounce weights; but 
sixty-six years were destined to elapse before Parliament took action 
respecting them.

612 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS, 

The coinmissiouers appointed in 1818 to establish a more uniforiii sys- 
tem of weights ami measures repeated the recommendations of the 
committee of 1758,* and as the avoirdupois pound which had long been 
used, although not legalized by any act of the legislature, was very 
nearly 7,000 troy grains, they recommended that 7,000 such troy grains 
be declared to constitute a pound avoirdupois.t Tbese recommenda- 
tions were embodied in the act of Parliament of June 17, 1824, and thus 
one of the troy pounds made in 1758 became the Imperial standard. 
That standard, like Bird's standard yard, was deposited in the Houses 
of Parliament and was burned up with them in October, 1834. 

The present English standard pound was made in 1844-'46 by Prof. 
W. H. Miller, who was one of the members of the commission ap- 
pointed in 1843 to superintend the construction of the new Parliament- 
ary standards of length and weight destined to replace those destroyed 
in 1834. A number of weights had been very accurately compared with 
the lost standard ; namely, in 1824 or 1825, by Captain Kater, five troy 
pounds of gun metal, destined respectively for the use of the Ex- 
chequer, the Royal Mint, and the cities of London, Edinburgh, and Dub- 
lin; and in 1829, b^' Captain v. Nehus, two troy pounds of brass and one 
of platinum, all in the custody of Professor Schumacher, and a platinum 
troy pound belonging to the Eoyal Society. The first step for recover- 
ing the mass of the lost standard was manifestly to compare these 
weights among themselves, and upon so doing it was found that for the 
brass and gun-metal weights the discrepancies between the weighings 
made in 1824 and 1844 amounted to 0.0226 of a grain,| while for the 
two platinum weights the discrepancies between the weighings made in 
1829 and 1845 was only 0.00019 of a grain.§ With a single exception, 
all the neiv brass or gun-metal weights had become heavier since their 
first comparison with the lost standard, the change being probably due 
to oxidation of their surfaces, and on that account the new standard 
was made to depend solely upon the two platinum weights. For con- 
venience of reference these weights were designated, respectively, Sp 
(Schumacher's platinum) and RS (Royal Society). A provisional 
I^latinum troy pound, T, intermediate in mass between Spand RS, was 
next prepared, and from two hundred and eighty-six comparisons made 
in January, February, July, and August, 1845, it was found that in a 

vacuum II 

T = Sp + 0.00105 grain, 

while from 122 comparisons made in January, July, and August, 1845, 

T = RS — 0.00429 grain. 

By combining these values with the results of the weighings made in 

1824-'29, namely, 

Sp = U — 0..S2956 grain, 
RS =U— 0.52441 grain, 

where U designates the lost standard — the comparison with Sp gave 

T = U — 0.52851 grain,

while those with RS gave 

T = 11 — 0.52870 grain. 

To the first of these expressions double weight was assigned, because 
the comparisons of T and U with Sp were about twice as numerous as 
those with RS. The resulting meau was therefore 

T = U — 0.52857 grains = 57.59.47143 grains, 
and from that value of T the new standard avoirdupois pound of 7,000 
grains was constructed. 

From sometime in the fifteenth century until the adoption of the 
metric system in August, 1793, the system of weights employed in 
France was the poids cle marc, having for its ultimate standard the pile 
de Charlemagne, which was then kept in the mint, and is now deposited 
in the Couservatoire des Arts et Metiers. The table of this weight was

8 gros =: 1 oiice = .576 

8 onces ^ 1 marc = 4608 

2 marcs =: 1 livre = 9216 

The origin of the pile de Charlemagne is not certainly known, but it is 
thought to have been made by direction of King John ( A.D. 1350-1364). 
It consists of a set of brass cup- weights, fitting one within the other, 
and the whole weighing fifty marcs. The nominal and actual weights 
of the several pieces are as follows : *

In determining the relation of the poids de marc to the metric weights, 
the committee for the construction of the kilogram regarded the entire 
pile de Charlemagne as a standard of fifty marcs, and considered the 
individual pieces as subject to the corrections stated. On that basis 
they found 

1 kilogram = 18827.15 French grains t 

and, as a kilogram is equal to 15132.34874 English troy grains, f we 
have 

1 livre, poids de marc = 7554.22 troy grains.

The metric standard of weight, called a kilogram, was constructed 
under the direction of the French Academy of Sciences simultaneously 
with the meter, the work being done principally by LefevreGineau 
and Borda. It was intended that the kilogram should have the same

mass as a cubic decimeter of pure water at maximum density, and the 
experimeutal determination of that mass was made by Jinding the differ- 
ence of weight in air and in water of a hollow brass cylinder 
whose exterior dimensions at a temperature of 17.6° C. were, height 
= 2.437672 decimeters, diameter = 2.428368 decimeters, volume 
== 11.2900054 cubic decimeters. The difference of weight in question 
was first measured in terms of certain brass weights, by the aid of 
which the platinum kilogram of the archives was subsequently con- 
structed, special care being taken to apply the corrections necessary 
to reduce all the weighings to what they would have been if made in a 
vacuum.* 

The best results hitherto obtained for the weight of a cubic decimeter 
of water, expressed in terms of the kilogram of the archives, are as 
follows : t

These results show the extreme difficulty of determining the exact 
mass of a given volume of water. The discordance between the differ- 
ent observers amounts to more than one part in a thousand, while good 
weighings are exact to one part in eight or ten millions. Without 
doubt two weights can be compared at least a thousand times more 
accurately than either of them can be reproduced by weighing a speci- 
fied volume of water, and for that reason the kilogram, like the En- 
glish pound, can now be regarded only as an arbitrary standard of 
which copies must be taken by direct comparison. As already stated, 
the kilogram is equivalent to 15432.34874 English troy grains, or about 
2 pounds 3 ounces avoirdupois. 

In consequence of the circumstance that the mass of a body is not 
affected either by temperature or flexure, weighing is an easier process 
than measuring; but in order to obtain precise results many precau- 
tions are necessary. Imagine a balance with a block of wood tied to 
its right-hand pan and accurately counterpoised by lead weights in its 
left-hand pan. If with things so arranged the balance were immersed 
in water the equilibrium would be instantly destroyed, and to restore

it all the weights would have to be removed from the left-hand pan, 
and some of them would have to be placed in the right-hand pan to 
overcome the buoyancy of the wood. The atmosphere behaves pre- 
cisely as the water does, and although its effect is minute enough to be 
neglected in ordinary business affairs, it must be taken into account 
when scientific accuracy is desired. To that end the weighing must 
either be made in a vacuum, or the difference of the buoyant effect of 
the air upon the substances in the two pans must be computed and 
allowed for. As very few vacuum balances exist, the latter method is 
usually employed. The data necessary for the computation are the 
latitude of the place where the weighing is made and its altitude above 
the sea-level; the weights, specific gravities, and co-efiicients of expan- 
sion of each of the substances in the two pans; the temperature of the 
air, its barometric pressure, and the pressure, both of the aqueous va- 
por, and of the carbonic anliydride contained in it. 

Judging from the adjustment of the pile de Charlemagne, and the 
Exchequer troy weights of Queen Elizabeth, the accuracy attained 
in weighing gold and silver at the mints during the fourteenth, 
fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries must have been about one part in 
ten thousand. The balance which Mr. Harris of the London mint used 
in 1743 indicated one-eighth of a grain on a troy pound, or about one 
part in 50,000 ; while that which he and Mr. Bird used in their observa- 
tions upon the Exchequer weights, for the Parliamentary Committee 
of 1759, was sufficiently exact "to discern any error in the pound weight 
to the 230,400th part of the weight."* In 1798 Sir George Shuckburgh 
had a balance sensitive enough to indicate 0.01 of a grain wiien loaded 
with 16,000 grains, or about one part in 1,(300,000. The balanc(> used 
by Fortin in 1799, in adjusting the kilogram of the archives, was not 
quite so delicate, its sensitiveness being only the one-millionth part of 
its load; but in 1844, for the adjustment of the present English stand- 
ard pound, Professor Miller employed a balance whose index moved 
about 0.01 of an inch for a change of 0.002 of a grain in a load of 7,000 
grains.t He read the index with a microscope, and found the probable 
error of a single comparison of two avoirdupois pounds to be one twelve- 
millionth of either, or about 0.00058 of a grain. At the present time it 
is claimed that two avoirdupois pounds C£n be compared with an error 
not exceeding 0.0002 of a grain ; and two kilograms with an error not 
exceeding 0.02 of a milligram. 

The mean solar day is the natural unit of time for the human race, 
and it is universally adopted among all civilized nations. Our ulti- 
mate standard of time is therefore the rotation of the earth upon its 
axis, and from that rotation we determine the errors of our clocks and 
watches by astronomical observations. For many purposes it suffices 
to make these observations upon the sun, but when the utmost precis- 
ion is desired it is better to make them on the stars. Until the close

of the seventeenth century quadrants were employed for that purpose, 
and so late as 1680 Flamsteed, the first English astronomer royal, thought 
himself fortunate when he succeeded in construting one which enabled 
him to be sure of his observed times within three seconds.* About 
161)0 Roemer invented the transit instrument, which soon superseded 
the quadrant, and still remains the best appliance for determining time. 
Most of his observations were destroyed by a fire in 1728, but the 
few which have come down to us show that as early as 1706 he deter- 
mined time with an accuracy which has not yet been very greatly sur- 
passed. Probably the corrections found in the least square adjustment 
of extensive systems of longitude determinations afi'ord the best crite- 
rion forestimatingtheaccuracy of first-class modern time observations, 
and from them it appears that the error of such observations may rise 
as high as i 0.05 of a second. 

During the intervals between successive observations of the heav- 
enly bodies we necessarily depend upon clocks and chronometers for 
our knowledge of the time, and very erroneous ideas are frequently 
entertained respecting the accuracy of their running. The subject is 
one upon which it is diflScult to obtain exact information, but there are 
few time-pieces which will run for a week without varying more than 
three-quarters of a second from their predicted error. As the number 
of seconds in a week is 604,800, this amounts to saying that the best 
time-pieces can be trusted to measure a week within one part in 756,000. 
Nevertheless, clocks and chronometers are but adjuncts to our chief 
time-piece, which is the earth itself, and upon the constancy of its ro- 
tation depends the preservation of our present unit of time. Early in 
this century Laplace and Poisson were believed to have proved that 
the length of the sidereal day had not changed by so much as the one 
hundredth part of a second during the last twenty-five hundred years, 
but later investigations show that they were mistaken, and so far as 
we can now see, the friction produced by the tides in the ocean must be 
steadily reducing the velocity with which the earth rotates about its 
axis. The change is too slow to become sensible within the life-time of 
a human being, but its ultimate consequences will be momentous. 

Ages ago it was remarked that all things run in cycles, and there is 
enough truth in the saying to make it as applicable now as on the day 
it was uttered. The Babylonian or Chaldean system of weights and 
measures seems to be the original from which the Egyptian system was 
derived, and is probably the most ancient of which we have any knowl- 
edge. Its unit of length was the cubit, of which there were two varie- 
ties, the natural and the royal. The foot was two-thirds of the natural 
cubit. Respecting the earliest Chaldean and Egyptian system of 
weights no very satisfactory information exists, but the best authori- 
ties agree that the weight of water contained in the measure of a cubic

foot coustituted the talent, or larger unit of weight, and that the six-, 
tieth or fiftieth parts of the talent constituted, respectively, the Chal- 
dean and Egyptian values of the mina, or lesser unit of commercial 
weight. Doubtless these weights varied considerably at ditterent times 
and places, just as the modern pound has varied, but the relations stated 
are believed to have been the original ones. The ancient Chaldeans 
used not only the decimal system of notation, which is evidently the 
primitive one, bat also a duodecimal system, as shown by the division 
of the year into twelve months, the eqaiuoctial day and night each into 
twelve hours, tlie zodiac into twelve signs, etc., and a sexagesimal sys- 
tem by which the hour was divided into sixty minutes, the signs of the 
zodiac into thirty parts or degrees, and the circle into three hundred 
and sixty degrees, with further sexagesimal subdivisions. The duo- 
decimal and sexagesimal systems seem to have originated with the 
Chaldean astronomers, who, for some reason which is not now evident, 
preferred them to the decimal system, and by the weight of their scien- 
tific authority impressed them upon their system of weights and 
measures. Now observe how closely the scientific thought of to day 
repeato the scientific thought of four thousand years ago. These old 
Chaldeans took from the human body what they regarded as a suitable 
unit of length, and for their unit of mass they adopted a cube of water 
bearing simple relations to their unit of length. Four thousand years 
later, when these simple relations had been forgotten and impaired, 
some of the most eminent scientists of the last century again undertook 
the task of constructing a system of weights and measures. With 
them the duodecimal and sexagesimal systems were out of favor, while 
the decimal system was highly fashionable, and for that reason they 
subdivided their units decimally instead of duodecimally, sexagesi- 
mally, or by powers of two ; but they reverted to the old Chaldean 
device for obtaining simple relations between their units of length and 
mass, and to that fact alone the French metric system owes its survival. 
Every one now knows that the meter is not the ten- millionth part of a 
quadrant of tlie earth's meridian, and in mathematical physics, where 
the numbers are all so complicated that they can only be dealt with by 
the aid of logarithms, and the constant ;t, an utterly irrational quantity, 
crops up in almost every integral, mere decimal subdivision of the units 
counts for very little. But in some departments of science, as, for 
example, chemistry, a simple relation between the unit of length (which 
determines volume), the unit of mass, and the unit of specific gravity is 
of prime importance, and wherever that is the case the metric system will 
be used. To engineers such relations are of small moment, and conse- 
quently among English-speaking engineers the metric system is making 
no progress, while, on the other hand, the chemists have eagerly adopted 
it. As the English yard and pound are the direct descendants of the 
Chaldean-Babylonian natural cubit and mina, it is not surprising that 
the yard should be only 0.4:8 ol an inch shorter tl:an the double cubit,

and the avoirdupois pouud only 665 grains lighter than the Babylonian 
commercial miua; but, considering the origin of the metric system, it 
is rather curious that the meter is only 1.97 inches shorter than the 
Chaldean double royal cubit, and the kilogram only 102 grains heavier 
than the Babylonian royal mina. Thus, without much exaggeration, 
we may regard the present English and French fundamental units of 
length and mass as representing, respectively, the commercial and royal 
units of length and mass of the Chaldeans of four thousand years ago. 

Science tells us that the energy of the solar system is being slowly 
dissipated in the form of radiant heat; that ultimately the sun will grow 
dim; life will die out on the planets; one by one they will tumble into 
the expiring sun ; and at last darkness and the bitter cold of the abso- 
lute zero will reign over all. In that far-distant future imagine some 
wandering human spirit to have penetrated to a part of space immeas- 
urably beyond the range of our most powerful telescopes, and there, 
upon an orb where the mechanical arts flourish as they do here, let him 
be asked to reproduce the standards of length, mass, and time with 
which we are now familiar. In the presence of such a demand the 
science of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries would be power- 
less. The spin of the earth which measures our days and nights would 
be irretrievably gone ; our yards, our meters, our pounds, our kilograms 
would have tumbled with the earth into the ruins of the sun and be- 
come part of the debris of the solar system. Could they be recovered 
from the dead past and live again ? The science of all previous ages 
mournfully answers, No; but with the science of the nineteenth cen- 
tury it is otherwise. The spectroscope has taught us that throughout 
the visible universe the constitution of matter is the same. Everywhere 
the rythmic motions of the atoms are absolutely identical, and to them, 
and the light which they emit, our wandering spirit would turn for the 
recovery of the long-lost standards. By means of a diffraction grating 
and an accurate goniometer he could recover the yard from the wave 
length of sodium light with an error not exceeding one or two thou- 
sandths of an inch. Water is everywhere, and with his newly recovered 
yard he could measure a cubic foot of it, and thus recover the standard 
of mass which we call a pound. The recovery of our standard of time 
would be more difficult; but even that could be accomplished with an 
error not exceeding half a iriiuute in a day. One way would be to perform 
Michelson's modification of Foucault's experiment for determining the 
velocity of light. Another waj^ would be to make a Siemen's mercury 
unit of electrical resistance, and then, either by the British Association 
method or by Lord Eayleigh's modification of Lorenz's method, find the 
velocity which measures its resistance in absolute units. Still another 
way would be to find the ratio of the electro-static and electro-magnetic 
units of electricity. Thus all the units now used in transacting the 
world's business could be made to re-iipi)ear, if not with scientific, at 
least with commercial, accuracy, on the other side of an abyss of time

aud space before which the huinaD mind shrinks back in dismay. The 
science of the eighteeuth century sought to render itself immortal by 
basing its standard units upon tlie solid earth, but the science of the

By direction of the Parliamentary Committee of 1758, and in tliepres- 
ence both of that body and of Mr. Farley, deputy chamberlain, Messrs. 
Harris and Gregory, of the London mint, comi^ared the several stand- 
ard troy weights of the Exchequer, with the following results: 

4-ounce weight = All smaller weights — ^ grain. 

8-ounce weight = All smaller weights + | grain. 

16-ouiJce weight = All smaller weights + i grain. 

32-onuce weight^ All smaller weights + 2 grains. 

64-ouuce weight = All smaller weights + ^ grains. 

128-ounce weight = All smaller weights + 14 grains. 

256-onnce weigiit = All smaller weights — 21 grains. 

The weighings which yielded these results were made at the London 
mint; the instruments employed being "a very curious and exact pair 
of scales, belonging to Mr. Harris, and the scales used at the Mint 
for the weighing of gold." After recording the results in their report* 
the committee continued as follows : 

Therefore beginning the Difference from the sixteen Ounce Weight, 
and carrying it on to the greatest Troy Weight in the Exchequer, the 
total Difference will be eight Grains and one half. 

The fourth Part of which is two Grains upon sixteen Ounces, which 
is a Grain and a half upon the twelve Ounces or Pound Troy. 



13, p. 437. 



622 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS. 

Then the eight and four Ounces Troy of the Exchequer were com- 
l>ared with the following Weights: 

First, With the Pound Troy used at the Mint in weighing of Gold, 
which was heavier than that at the Exchequer one Grain. 

Secondly, With the eight and four Ounces at the Mint of the 6th of 
Queen Anne, 1707, which was heavier than that at the Exchequer 
half a Grain. 

The eight and four Ounces of Queen Elizabeth 1588 at the Mint, was 
heavier than that at the Exchequer three Quarters of a Grain ; 
another of the same Year of Queen EUzaheth at the Mint, stanipt 
with a Tower, a Thistle and Grown, and EL and Crown, was heavier 
than that at the Exchequer one Grain. 

Mr. Freeman produced a four and eight Ounce of the 6th of Queen 
Anne 1707, by which he makes Weights for Sale, which was heavier 
than the same Weights at the Exchequer one Grain and three Quarters: 
Therefore, upon an Average of all these Weights, the Pound Troy 
should be one Grain heavier than the Weights at the Exchequer, and 
that added to the Grain and a half, which, upon the former Experi- 
ments, the Weights at the Exchequer are too light a Medium taken 
from thence, makes the projier Increase of the Exchequer Pound Troy 
to be one Grain and one Quarter. 

And it is to be observed, that the Pound Troy Weight at the Mint, 
which is now used for Gold, and the eight and four Ounces at the Mint, 
marked with a Tower, and in the Time ot Queen Elizabeth, are both 
one Grain heavier than the eight and four Ounces of the Exchequer. 

And considering that the Exchequer Weights have been used ever 
since the 30th of Queen Elizabeth, 1588, one hundred and seventy Years, 
to size other Weights by, it is highly probable, that the Difference may 
have been occasioned by the frequent Use of the Standard. 

Your Committee endeavored to compare the Troy Weights with the 
original Standard at Gol(hmith''s Hall, from whence it is said, in the 
aforesaid Verdict of the 29th and 30th of Elizabeth, that the Weights 
now at the Exchequer were made, and for that Purpose sent to Gold- 
smith''s Hall for the said Weights; but were informed that no such 
were to be found there, the Goldsmiths having no Weights older than 
those at the Exchequer. 

The committee's statement respecting the way in which the correc- 
tion of 1^ grains was deduced from the weighings of the Exchequer 
weights is very obscure, and the result is not justified by generally ac- 
cepted principles. If we put x for the sum of all the weights smaller 
than 4 ounces, then the results of the weighings made by the committee 
may be written in the form : 

4 ounce divided = 1 x 

4 ounce weight = 1 ac — } grain. 

8 ouuce weight = 2 x + J- grain. 

16 ounce weight =: 4 x -f i grain. ( ^-^^^ 

32 ounce weight = 8 a; -}- 2^ graius. ( 

64 ounce weight -^ W x -\- 5^ grains. 

128 ouuce weight = 32 x -\- 22 grains. 

256 ouuce weight ^^ 64 x -j- 9 grains. J 

Before proceeding further we must decide in what sense these weights 
are to be regarded as standards, and perhaps the most natural course 



THE ART OF WEIGniNG AND MEA.'^UKING. 



623 



will be to regard the entire set as a standard of 5115 troy ounces. In 
that case the summation of the several columns gives 

512 ounces = 128 x -|- 'W grains. 

■whence 

X = 4 ounces — 0.3047 grain (2) 

and by substituting that value in the equations (1) we obtain the cor- 
rections to the several weights given in the second column of Table I.

From equations (1) and (2) we have 

4 ounces = 4-oz. weight + 0.5547 grain. 
8 ounces = 8-oz. weight -j- 0.3594 grain. 

whence it follows that the sum of the 8 and 4 ounce weights, which 
constituted the Exchequer standard troy pound, was too light by 
0.9141 of a grain. As the mean correction obtained from the four 
weights belonging respectively to the Mint and to Mr. Freeman, agrees 
closely with this result, the true correction to the Exchequer standard 
must have been very approximataly 1 grain ; and in adopting 1| 
grains the committee seem to have augmented the weight of the troy 
pound by about one-quarter of a grain. The corrections which result 
to the Exchequer troy weights upon the committee's assumption that 
the sum of the S and 4 ounce weights was IJ grains too light are given 
in the third column of Table I ; while the fourth column contains the 
corrections found by Mr. Ciiisholm in 1873,* and the fifth column shows 
the loss of weight which occurred between 1758 and 1873. In view of 
the fact that these weights were constantly used for comparing local 
standards during a period.of no less than two hundred and thirty seven 
years, from 158S to 1825, their excellent preservation is very remarkable. 
In the report of the committee of 1758 there is another set of com- 
parisons of the Exchequer troy weights,! said comparisons having 
been made on April L4, 1758, in accordance with the directions of

tlie presence of Mr. Farley, deputy chamberlain. They are as follows: 

^-ounce hollow = ^-oiince solid + i giaiu. 

i-ounce weight = All smaller weiglits — i grain. 

^-ounce weight = All smaller weights — i grain. 

1-ounce weight == All smaller weights — I grain.

64-ounce weight = All smaller weights ^ grains. 

128-ouuce weight = All smaller weiglits + 15 grains.

In these equations the symbol it is used to indicate the relation

Summing the various columns

whence 

X = I ounce — 0.01318 grains, (4) 

and by substituting that value in the equations (3) we obtain the cor. 
rections given for the several weights in the second column of Table II. 
The third column contains the corrections which result upon the com- 
mittee's assumption that the sum of the 8 and 4 ounce weights was 1^ 
grains too light; and the fourth and fifth columns contain corrections 
given by Mr. Chisholm in his seventh annual report.* Mr. Ohisholm 
does not explain how he obtained the corrections quoted in the fourth 
column of the table, but their close agreement with those in the third 
column renders it almost certain that they were computed from the 
comparisons made by Messrs Freeman and Reed. As the committee 
of 1758 used Mr. Harris's weighings to the exclusion of those by Messrs. 
Freeman and Reed, the adoption of the opposite course by Mr. Chisholm 
is perhaps explained by the circumstance that in his report on the Ex- 
chequer standards t he has quoted the weighings by Messrs. Freeman and 
Meed and has attributed them to Mr. Harris.

In addition to being less" exact, the weighings by Mr. Freeman 
ditter from those by Mr. Harris principally in the sign of the correc- 
tion to the o2-onnce weight; the former stating that the 32-ouuce 
weight was lighter than the sum of all the smaller weights and the 
latter that it was heavier. To ascertain which was right we have 
only to compare the resulting systems of corrections with those found 
by Mr. Cliisholm in 1S73. Table I shows that according to Mr, Harris's 
w^eighings all the weights have grown lighter during the interval froui 
1758 to 1873, while Table II shows that according to Mr. Freeman's 
weighings some have grown lighter and others heavier, and that by 
(piantities which cannot be attributed to accidental errors in the weigh- 
ings. In view of these facts there can be no doubt that the committee 
of 1758 was right in using only Mr. Harris's weighings, and it seems 
equally certain that the numbers in Table I should be adopted to the 
exclusion of those in Table II.

From coraparisons of their troy pound with their avoirdupois pound, 
and with the 2-marc weight sent to them by the French Academy in 
1742, the Royal Society of London found* — 

(1) That the English avoirdupois pound weighed 7,004 troy grains : 

(2) That the French livrCj consisting of 2 marcs, weighed 7,560 
troy grains: 

And for three-quarters of a century the latter value was universally 
accepted. Further, when the metric system came into being the kilo- 

*7, page 187. It is usual to designate 1742 as the date of the exchange of stand- 
ards, but the remark of Cassini de Thury (5, p. 135) shows that the true date must 
have been prior to April, 1733. In his paper of November, 1742, Graham makes only 
the indefinite statement that the exchange was "proposed some time since," 

H. Mis. 142 40 



626 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS. 

gram was deelared to consist of 18,827.15 Freucb graius, of which the 
livre contained 9216 5* or, in other words, the kilogram was declared 
equal to2.0128S livres, whence, irith the RoyaJ Societifs value of ilic livrc, 

the English equivalent of the kilogram was computed to be 15,444 troy 
grains. 

During some experiments at the London mint in March, 1820, it was 
found that the French livre belonging to that institution weighed only 
7,555 troy grains. This discovery led to an examination of the Royal 
Society's standards of 1742, which had been carefully preserved, and it 
was found that their livre agreed with that at the mint, but their Troy 
pound was nearly 4 graius lighter than the Imperial standard of 1758, 
and their avoirdupois pound weighed only 7,000 troy grains instead of 
7,004.t Thus it was rendered almost certain that the accepted English 
equivalent of the kilogram was about 10 grains too large, and, to remove 
all possible doubt, a direct comparison of the English and French stand- 
ards of weight was eifected in 1821,| through the co-operation of the 
respective governments, and then it was definitively ascertained that 
the weight of the kilogram is only 15,433 troy grains. 

The facts respecting the Royal Society's standards of 1742 are as 
follows : 

(1) The weighings recorded in the Philosophical Transactions, 1743, 
pages 553 and 556, give 

R. S. troy pouud = Exch. (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — i grain (5) 

R. S. troy pound = Mint (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — 2| grains (6) 

whence 

Excb. (8 ounces + 4 ounces) = Mint (8 ounces -(- 4 ounces) — 1| grains (7) 

(2) The weighings by Mr. Harris for the Parliamentary Committee 

of 1758 give § 

Exch. (8 ounces -f 4 ounces) = Mint (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — | grain (8) 

whence by (6), 

R. S. troy pound = Exch. (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — 1| grains (9) 

In equations (6) and (8) the weights at the mint were those of the 
sixth of Queen Anne, 1707, 

(3) In the Philosophical Transactions, 1742, page 187, it is stated that 
the Paris 2marc weight weighs 7560 troy grains. As the true weight 
of 2 marcs is 7554.22 grains, this implies that the Royal Society's troy 
pound was too light by 5.78 (5760 -^ 7560) = 4.40 grains. 

In the Philosophical Transactions, 1742, page 187, it is stated that 
the Royal Society's avoirdupois pound weighed 7004 troy grains, while 
the comparisons made in 1820 show that its weight was then only 7000 
such grains. This implies that the Royal Society's troy pound was too 
light by 4.00 (5760 4- 7000) = 3.29 grains. 

Finally, the comparisons of 1820 showed that the Royal Society's 
troy pound was "nearly 4 grains too light." 

The mean of these three independent results shows that the Royal

Society's troy pound was 3.9 grains lighter than the Imperial standard 
of 1758; whence 

R. a. troy pound -f :{.9 grains = Standard of 1758 
but 

Standard of 1858 = Exch. (8 ounces + 4 ounces) -|- IJ grains 

and therefore 

R. S. troy pound = Exch. (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — 2| grains 

Considering the indetiniteness of the data respecting the weighing!- 
made in 1820, equations (9) and (12) agree fairly well, but equation (5) 
is very discordant, as are also equations (7) and (8). All the evidence 
seems to point to an error of about 1^ grains in equation (5) ; and if 
instead of (5) we write 

R. S. Troy pound = Exch. (8 ounces -|- 4 ounces) — 2 grains 
(7) will become 

Exch. (8 ounces + 4 ounces) = Mint (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — | grain 

and then all the equations will be reasonably accordant.

Assistant O. H. Tittmann, of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, 
in charge of weights and measures, has recently shown that the dis- 
crepancies in the values assigned to the meter in terms of the yard 
depend mainly upon errors either in the assumed lengths or in the 
assumed coefficients of expansion of the standards employed.* By a 
skillful use of the data published by the various observers, combined, 
with the known coefficient of expansion of the iron committee meter, 
"CM," of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, he has succeeded in 
determining the absolute expansions of the standards in question, and 
by means of these expansions he has referred all the observations to 
the said committee meter and to the present British Imperial yard. 
From the data thus reduced to a common standard he has obtained 
the very consistent results given in the fourth column of the following 
table. The values in the third column are those published by the ob- 
servers themselves, and it is now evident that they really depend upon 
several different British and metric units. As there is no means of re- 
ferring the standard used by Prof. W. A. Rogers to the committee meter, 
his result could not be included in the table.

DETERMINATION OF THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH 
BY MEANS OF A PENDULUM PRINCIPLE. 



By J. WiLSING. 

Translated and condensed by Prof. J. Howard Gore, Ph. D. 



Four different methods have been used in the determination of the 
mean density of the earth. The first is based upon the measurement 
of the deflection of the phimb-line in the neighborhood of great mount- 
ain masses; the second upon the determination of the length of the 
second's pendulum at various distances from the earth's center. Accord- 
lug to the third and fourth methods, the attraction of a body of known 
mass, usually of a globular shape, is ascertained by means of the torsion 
balance, or directly with an ordinary balance and compared with the 
constants of gravity. 

The first attempts towards the solution of this problem were by Mas- 
kelyne, receiving a new discussion at the hand of Huttou a few years 
later. Maskelyue's results depended upon the measurement of the de- 
flection of the plumb line caused by the attraction of Schehallien, in 
connection with an approximated value for the densitj^ of the moun- 
tain. This estimated density, derived from the superficial strata alone, 
was so subject to uncertainties that the result can be regarded as 
nothing more than a rough approximation. Later and more general 
investigations have shown that local deflection may arise from a variety 
of coexisting or conspiringcauses, so that the attraction of elevations can 
be accounted for by the presence of depressions or interior defects in 
the earth's mass. In such a case, a value for the attracting mass which 
is deduced from the exterior configuration alone, must lead to incorrect 
results. Similar objections can be ap])lied to the method of pendulum 
swinging, which was made use of by Carlini and Airy, and more recently 
by von Sterneck and Albreclit. 

Hence the invention by Coulomb of the torsion balance and its ap- 
plication by Cavendish to the problem in question marked a great 
advance towards its accurate sohition. The great sensitiveness of this 
instrument makes its possible to render measurable the attraction of 
balls of a tew hundredweight, the mass of which can easily be ascer-

tained by weighing, so tbat the determiuatiou of the deusity of the 
earth enters into the realm of laboratory investigation. However, this 
sensitiveness which eliminates the uncertainty in the computation of 
the attracting forces has, as a consequence, some disadvantages which 
were first mentioned by Francis Baily while engaged upon the same 
problem. These drawbacks consist chiefly of a limited inertia and sta- 
bility against accidental disturbances, especially temperature changes 
and the variations in the twisting force of the supporting thread. In 
the interesting investigations of A. Cornu and J. B, Bailie the disturb, 
ances just referred to seem to have been essentially eliminated. Unfor- 
tunately it is not possible to form an opinion regarding the accuracy of 
the results from the short report that is given in Compt. Rend., 1878, 
Lxxxvi, pp. 699-702. At all events measurements with the torsion 
balance must be regarded as especially difficult. 

For this reason the fourth method, the determination by the means of 
a balance of the change in weight of a body caused by the proximity of 
a second body of known mass, has the preference. It is true, however, 
that the ordinary balance is not sufficiently sensitive to measure the 
attraction of bodies as small as those employed in the torsion balance. 
Jolly, who first made use ot this method, utilized a ball of lead of 120 
hundredweight. At this time Messrs. Konig and Richarz are working 
at Jolly's method, using a parallelopiped block of lead of 2,000 hun- 
dredweight. Since it is necessary to actually determine the weight of 
these large bodies, a task rendered difficult on account of their size, 
the measurement of their attraction requires the transposition of them 
while being weighed. Jolly had four scale pans, two of which were 
fastened below the others by a wire 2L meters long; he determined the 
increase in the weight of a glass vessel filled with mercury which was 
caused by its transfer to the lower scale pan under which was the at- 
tracting ball of lead. This transfer caused a loss of time, and necessi- 
tated a frequent stoppage of the balance, a condition which might seri- 
ously affect the results since the change in the relative positions of 
knife edge and its resting place would bring about a deformity in the 
former, causing a disturbance in the oscillation of the balance. 

I have sought to overcome these difficulties by turning the instru- 
ment through 90^, that is, by replacing for a horizontal balance a verti- 
cal one or a pendulum whose knife-edge is above the center of gravity 
and very near to it, upon the hypothesis that the sensitiveness of the 
apparatus could be materially increased if it forms a rigid system and 
is protected from flexure by being supported with its length vertical. 
Then it is jiossible to succeed with smaller and more easily handled 
masses, and to prosecute the observations without difficulty while the 
necessity to stop the instrument during the progress of the work is en- 
tirely avoided. A trial apparatus was constructed in which the time of 
oscillation was |)rOiOnged to the desired extent, giving results so har- 
monious that a final pendulum was completed in 1885 by Kepsold.

DESCRIPTION OF THE APPARATUS. 

The pendulmu consists of a drawn brass tube 1'" long, 4.15<^^"' in diam- 
eter, and 0.1 6*'" thick, Nvhich is strengthened near its middle by means 
of a frame, (J E F D. At this place are two mortises 
on opposite sides of the tube, E F, rectangular in 
shape, 9'"' long and 2'"' wide, for the insertion of the 
resting place or bed L for the knife-edge S which is 
lirmlv fastened to the pendulum. The upper portion 
of this bed is a slightly concave piece of agate of (>''" 
in length and 1*^"' in width securely attached to the 
supporting brass. The knife-edge, also of agate, has 
the same length as its bed. Its cross-section is an 
equilateral triangle with sides 1.7*="' long. The edge 
is not perfectly sharp, and on account of the concav- 
ity of the bed rests on it only near the end. The slits 
just referred to serve as a guide to the knife-edge and 
also admits the air into the interior of the tube so 
that there may be a quick and equable response to 
all temperature changes. The ends of the tube are 
closed by means of brass caps which carry conical 
pins. Upon these pins balls of brass, A, are attached 
by means of screws. The pins are prolonged beyond 
the balls and one of them carries three small mova- 
ble screws, N, whose determinations will be given 



D 



later ; at the other end corresponding to this addi- 
tional weight a brass disk of equal weight is screwed 
on so that the symmetry of the apparatus is pre- 
served. Through the upper end of the pendulum rod 
])erpendicular to the length of the knife-edge there is 
a slender screw, G H, 7*="" long, which serves in ad- 
justing the position of the center of gravity. Di- 
rectly before and behind the knife-edge circular mir- 
rors of 3.5""' diameter are attached, with whose as- 
sistance the swinging of the pendulum can be observed. In order to 
avoid magnetic interferences, brass is used throughout the entire in- 
strument. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE OBSERVING-ROOM. 

The observing-room, 4'" square, is situated in the basement of the 
west wing of the observatory. As the walls are very thick and the 
room, being on the southern side directly under the cupola, is protected 
from the dii-ect rays of the sun, the changes in the temperature are 
very slight. 

In the middle of the room there was a rigid pillar of brick with its 
foundation 3 feet deep. On its sonth side is the cast-iron bracket which 
supports the pendulum, so arranged that when once placed in a perpen- 
dicular position it can be securely held so. The whole is protected 



638 MISCELLANEOUS PAPEIiS. 

from air distui bailees by means of a wooden box covered with clotli 
and fastened directly to tbe pillar. The front of the box can be taken 
off, so as to remove or rephice the i)endnlnin, while an opening, pro- 
vided with a cover, in the top allows the weights to be moved at will. 
On the sides in front of the mirrors, already described, are small square 
windows closed with glass. Later this box was covered with a coat of 
white lead. 

The telescope with which the oscillations were observed had an open- 
ing of 8'='" and 80"" focal distance. It was fastened on a brick pillar in 
communicating passage. The scale utilized in the observations was 
on glass; it was oO*^'" in length, and was placed at a distance of 500"" 
from the mirror. The magnifying power of the telescope was such that 
the tenth of a millimeter could be approximated, and after some prac- 
tice the twentieth, a value which represented about a second of arc. 
The graduation error in the scale was never greater than 0.01""". 

THE ATTRACTING MASSES. 

Until now balls of lead have been universally used. But on account 
of the softness of lead it is almost impossible to secure a geometric 
body homogeneous in its structure ; besides, the continued suspension 
would bring about, through the action of gravity, deformities. For 
these reasons, notwithstanding its small specific gravity, the preference 
was given to cast-iron, and for practical convenience and the possibility 
of a more exact figure the cylindrical shape was chosen. They were 
cast under pressure, and upon a subsequent weighing and examination 
for specific gravity they appeared practically identical. 

These masses, each of which weighed 325 kilograms, were so hung by 
a wire rope over a system of pulleys that they always balanced one an- 
other, and could be easily moved, one up, the other down. The length 
of the rope was so adjusted that when one of the cylinders was directly 
opposite the upper end of the pendulum the other would be on the oppo- 
site side and directly on a line with the lower end. In order to obviate 
any lateral motion and consequent shaking, each cylinder was provided 
with guiding rollers which ran up tracks attached to uprights, firmly 
held in their proper places. This and similar precautions were so well 
taken that during the entire series of observations no jarring was ob- 
served. 

ARRANGEMENT OF THE OBSERVATIONS. 

When the pendulum was put in motion, before the cylinders were put 
in place, it was noticed if the amplitude was bisected by the vertical 
through the point of support. If not, the screw in the upper end, al- 
ready referred to, was made use of, aided, if necessary, by a change in 
the position of the thin plates on the top of the rod. 

The position of equilibrium was next determined by placing, for in- 
stance, the eastern weight near the upper end of the pendulum, observ- 
ing a series of four consecutive elongations, then changing the weights, 
observe another series of four elongations. Both series were, with few 



MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH. 639 

exceptions, separated from one another by a complete double swing. 
The observations were repeated, so as to have two or three sets of four 
readings for each day. The arc of oscillation gradually decreased to a 
fixed limit, since the series were so arranged that the transfer of the 
weights could be made to follow that phase of oscillation in which the 
change in the direction of the force causes a retardation of its motion. 
The amplitude of the arc was between three degrees and a few minutes, 
with about 45' as an average. 

With the determination of the position of equilibrium that of the du- 
ration of the oscillation is closely allied. The time of the transit of a 
division of the scale over the wire of the telescope could be estimated 
within 0.1 second. These transits were usually observed on three divis- 
ions. If the times of transits of the same phase were observed, the dif- 
ference would give an approximate value for the time of a double osciUa- 
tion ; which, however, must be corrected for the decreased arc owing to 
the resistance of the air. 

For the reduction of the observations there is still needed a deter- 
mination of the sensitiveness of the pendulum. This is also found from 
the period of oscillation, by changing the position of the supplemental 
weights attached to the upper end of the pendulum. Each observed 
period in combination with the normal period gave the moment of in- 
ertia and the distance of the center of gravity from the knife-edge. 

In all the observations a chronometer giving stellar time was used, and 
was compared both before and after each series with the standard clock 
of the observatory. Barometric readings were made, as well as those 
for temperature, which were taken from thermometers placed in various 
parts of the room. 

Laplace noticed, and Bessel proved by experiments, that the shape of 
the knife-edge supporting a pendulum exerted an appreciable effect 
upon the period of oscillation and the diminution in the amplitude. 
Since this period furnislies an important element in all reductions, it 
was necessary to investigate the eifect of the dulling of the knife-edge. 
At the same time the resistance of the air and its resulting interference 
were investigated. 

The computation of the moment of inertia was divided into parts, 
taking up first the moment for the mean position of the instrument as 
previously determined, using in this connection the moment of a mate- 
rial line coincident with the axis of the pendulum rod and perpendicu- 
lar to the line joining the centers of the attracting masses. The at- 
traction of the masses is : 

in which mg is the weight of the ball,/ a constant, 6, 2/^, and R the 
specific gravity, height, and radius of the cylinder, and a the distance 
of the middle point of the ball to the center of the cylinder. If I is the 
distanceof the center of the ball from the knife-edge, the moment will be: 

27tfing6l ( y/a^lif+W- y/[a-\-nf+\i^-\-2h) 



640 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS. 

The effect of the screws aud the rollers serving as guides for the 
cylinders was next investigated and allowance therefor duly made, 
likewise for such other parts as were not of an eliminating character. 
After making all corrections that presented themselves the result was 
the desired moment for the normal position of the pendulum. The 
next thing was to find what change was produced upon this moment 
by giving to the pendulum a certain position ; that is, when the pendu- 
lum is at a known point, as shown by the reading of the reflection on 
the scale. By combining both elongations certain terms in the com- 
putation disappeared, thus simplifying the labor. l(2cp(a) represents 
the moment in the normal position of the pendulum, regarding a as 
the distance from the origin, h the linear deviation of the middle ol the 
ball, e the deviation, likewise expressed in linear measure, caused by 
attraction, the moment will be expressed by q){a-\-b—e) for the first 
position of the weights and (p{a—b—e) for the second. The sum of 
both is 2(p(a—e)-^b'^q}"{a—e), but since (p"{a—e)=0, the resulting 
moment can be expressed by 2(p{a)—2e(p'{a), a value which can be ac- 
cepted as sufficiently accurate when it is considered that e never ex- 
ceeds two millimeters. 

Although the attraction of the cylinders upon the instrument is the- 
oretically determined with suflicient precision, yet the accuracy of the 
final result is limited by the closeness with which the constants are 
known. Therefore it is preferable to eliminate from the final result 
those constants which can not be ascertained with the desired accu- 
racy. This can be done in the following simple manner: 

Suppose a series of observations with the complete apparatus gave 
for the mean density J, and a second series after diminishing the 
weights on the upper end of the pendulum gave /},,', the difference be- 
tween these two values rests upon a false value for the specific gravity of 
the pendulum, not regarding errors of observation for the present. If X 
is the error in the moment arising from this cause, the true value can 

be derived from z^ = J.-4- -' , z/= J,,4- "^ ,, in which m, and w,, are ob- 

m/ m,/ 

tained from the observations. In this manner the attraction of the 
weights upon the pendulum-rod appears to be perfectly eliminated 
from the final result. It is conditioned upon the value accej)ted as the 
attraction of the balls alone, in which no uncertainty is involved, while 
the agreement z/, and /},, furnishes a thorough control over the experi- 
ments. 

Correction for the«resistance of the air was applied, and a law for the 
decrease in the amplitude sought. This was found to be proportional 
to the first power of the velocity, a result which agrees with the expres- 
sion found by Cornu and Bailie for the effect of the air upon the torsion 
balance. 

The constants were determined with great care, and in each case the 
units of weight and measure were compared with the standards, while 



MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH. 641 

the specific gravity was ascertained from some metal taken from the 
same crucible from which the weights were cast. The relative position 
of the weights and pendulum balls during the observations was an im- 
portant factor, as was also the radius vector of each of the balls, and 
they were most carefully investigated. It was found that after the first 
few days there was no appreciable change in the length of the wire rope 
supporting the weights, so that the employment of the mean relative 
position could not introduce dangerous errors. The length of the 
pendulum balls from the knife-edge, the principal element entering into 
the computation of the moments, was measured by a standard catheto- 
meter belonging to the Prussian commission of standards. The dis- 
tance of the knife edge from the scale was ascertained by means of 
direct measurement and by triangulation with results quite harmonious. 
In the determination of all the constants the effort was made, and suc- 
cessfully it is believed, to keep the error within one unit in the third 
decimal place. 

Just here it might be mentioned that,* taking every possible element 
into consideration, the resulting moment of the pendulum with the balls 
for both positions of the weights was 10.3106^5^, while without the balls 
it was 4.3578^, in which d represents the specific gravity of the weights. 

DISCUSSION OF THE OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS. 

The observations consisted of the determination of the duration of 
oscillation and the equilibrium position of the pendulum, for which a 
series of fourteen observations were made with the balls on the pendu 
lum and twelve with the balls removed. They were begun with a large 
amplitude and continued until the arc passed over was only six or ten 
minutes. In both cases a continuous decrease in the time showed it- 
self, which could not be explained by the usual reduction to the 
smallest swings. Hence the time was taken for two double swings 
when the amplitude was at an average value, and two or more times 
taken on each side of this value. These observations were adjusted 
graphically, a method which answered in this case in consequence of 
the regularity in the values. The theoretical time was compared with 
the observed, and the discrepancy reduced to a minimum. Knowing 
the equilibrium position of the pendulum, and the distance of the ball 
from this point, at each elongation a simple subtraction gave the dis- 
tance of the ball from the attracting body. 

The formula used in the final computation was :

with the balls ^,=5.651^0.017 aud without J,, =5.731 ±0.020. As al- 
ready intimated the discrepancy is to be ascribed to the inaccuracy in 
the determination of the weight of the pendulum, so, using the formulae 
already given :

w,, = 1.9269 ±0.006 
from which the mean density z^= 5.594 ±0.032. 

The probable error of the final result might have been reduced by in- 
creasing the number of observations. Still it seemed better while test- 
ing this new method not to accumulate too much material or more than 
was needed to reach a reasonably accurate result. But since the ex- 
periments here made point to the possibility of a better solution of 
this problem, it is intended to carry the observations further, and by a 
new determination of the constants to secure results indeiiendent of 
their first determination. 

CONCLUSION. 

For the purpose of comparison, the previously-found values for the 
mean density might properly be given here. 

Maskelyne found from local deflection at Schehallien, 4.713 ; Colonel 
James, at Arthur's Seat, 5.14; Carlini and Airy received from pendu- 
lum determinations 4.837 and 6.623, and in more recent times Menden- 
hall and von Sterneck, 5.77. 

Cavendish (5.48), Reich (5.49, in the revision 5.58), Baily (5.66, after 
correction by Corn a and Bailie, 5.55), Cornu and Bailie (5.56) used the 
torsion balance, dually Joily (5.692), Poynting (5.69) utilizing the ordi- 
nary balance. The result here found is considerably smaller than 
those found by Jolly's method, aud slightly larger than the values 
which the torsion balance gave, especially the corrected value of Baily. 
1 think, however, that the correction here referred to as made by Cornu 
and Bailie admits of criticism. As in the present case, Baily observed 
in each position of the weights four stationary points. He also used 
the time when the balance was stationary at its greatest elongation 
for changing the weights, so that the last observation of each series 
might at the same time be the first of the next series. With most of 
his observations tlie difference between two consecutive elongations on 
the one side did not agree with the corresponding difference on the other, 
and furthermore this difference was always greater on the side where the 
first reading was. Cornu aud Bailie concluded that this lack of symme- 
try was owing to the presence of a constant error which was not 
eliminated in the subsequent adjustments. However, it is not equally 
npparent that the tendency of this error is to increase the final result. 
According to their belief the irregularity referred to in the diminution 



MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH. 643 

of the amplitude is owing to unsteadiness which was caused by the 
change of the weights, and therefore influences tbe first reading of each 
series. But it is not easy to see how the disturbance, which was so regu- 
lar, can be explained in this manner, especially since Baily has ex- 
pressly referred to the perfrct isolation of the masses, and their easy 
motions free from jar. He did not explaiu with equal clearness the way 
in which he obviated such disturbances as might arise from change of 
temperature, disturbances which, at the beginning of his observations, 
caused serious difficulties. The supposition of a difference of temper- 
ature, scarcely shown bya thermometer, between the masses and the 
balance inclosed in a thick box seems justified, and such differences 
are sufficient to explaiu the disturbances of a system swinging with 
such a slight inertia. They would be analogous to the irregularities 
which have been observed in these experiments to exist between the 
temperature of the two sides of the pendulum-rod and which were in 
direct dependence upon the algebraic sign of the motion of the zero 
point from the source of heat. The disturbances which showed them- 
selves in Bail.v's series of observations were regarded as a change of 
sign in the course of the zero point, which produced such an effect that 
the observed deflection grew regularly with the time since the transfer 
of the weights to their new position. The plan of computing the posi- 
tion of equilibrium from the last three numbers of each series, a method 
which leads to a much smaller value, was set aside by Cornu and 
Bailie for one which will increase the error in the reduction of Bailv's 
work. It would have been too much to expect for this reason a smaller 
value for the mean density of tbe earth from Baily's observations than 
woukl have resulted from the avoidance of this error, a remark intensi- 
fied by the deviation of his result from those deduced by others from 
the torsion balance. Unfortunately it is not possible to reach from the 
observations any conclusion regarding the two opposing hypotheses, 
since no readings are given of a long series without changing the 
weights. 

The observations here given have shown that the pendulum is a most 
excellent instrument for the determination of gravity, a problem which 
for a time it did not seem competent to solve. It is to be hoped that 
its somewhat restricted domain may be extended. In this connection 
there may be mentioned the determining of inner friction, a matter of 
great importance in the mechanical theory of gas. Since the resist- 
ance of the air in the case of a sensitive pendulum causes a rapid de- 
crease in the amplitude of the arc, the amount of retardation is so con- 
siderable that an accurate determination of the desired quantity can 
best be secuied from a few observations. The results might be modi- 
fied by an appreciable change in the sensitiveness, atmospheric press- 
ure, or temperature. Stokes has discussed the case in which an infin- 
itely l<mg cylindrical rod oscilUitos so that its axis remains i)arallel. 
The solution of this is closely related to that of a rod swinging about

a fixed axis iu a closed box, if in addition to the conditional equations 
which are to be fulfilled on the surface of the rod certain others are 
introduced. In this way Stokes reduced Baily's experiments with the 
rod-shaped seconds pendulum. In the foregoing case the pendulum- 
rod was hollow, into which the air could enter unrestricted. This con- 
dition complicated the problem ; however only a few changes in the 
construction of the pendulum would be necessary in order to render 
Stokes's theory applicable. 

May the apparatus whose application to a special case is here shown, 
prove itself useful in physical investigations in other realms. 

In " Publicationen des Astrophysikalischen Observatoriums," vol. 
VI (the preceding part of this abstract), I have given a series of obser- 
vations which I prosecuted with a peculiarly constructed })eudulum for 
the purpose of determining the mean density of the earth. The dis- 
cussion of these observations led to satisfactory results, but the exper- 
iments justified the expectation that a greater accuracy might be 
reached by an elimination of certain obstacles, partly of an accidental 
nature, and especially by a more thorough protection against the influ- 
ence of temperature change. The results of the observations made 
after the application of the contemplated improvements gratified the 
anticipations, since the probable error in the latter set of exjieriments 
is only one-third of that obtained by the former. The axes of the cy- 
linders, which were directed towards the center of the balls attached 
to the pendulum, during the first experiments made an angle with the 
plane of oscillation in order to secure a sufficient proximity of the balls 
to the attracting masses. This state of affairs complicated the numeri- 
cal computation of the situation of the pendulum with respect to the 
masses, since besides the measurement of the separation of their sur- 
faces from the middle point of the apparatus it was necessary to accu- 
rately ascertain the difference of direction which the axes of the masses 
made with the plane of oscillation. The supports were so changed that 
the axes could be brought precisely into the plane of the pendulum. 
This simplification made it possible to secure such a position as to allow 
a more ready and accurate measurement of the distance of the masses 
from the apparatus, and at the same time it served to keep it in that 
position. On both sides of the pillar which supported the instrument 
places were attached for the support of a contact lever rotating about 
a vertical axis. One arm of this lever, terminating in a shari) point, 
rested against the back of the attracting mass, while the other arm 
swept over a short scale divided into millimeters, provided with a reg- 
istering apparatus so that its position could be readily ascertained. 
Since the lengths of the arms were as 1: 4, a change in the situation of 
the cylinder could be estimated to a tenth of a millimeter without dif- 
ficulty. In case of a contrary movement of the mass, the pin of the 
lever would keep in contact with it through action of a pressure weight

on the lever. The guides on the sides were reuewed and made stronger 
so as to counteract all swinging motions of the masses. 

While the changes and improvements just referred to were being 
made to secure a more accurate and ready determination of the con- 
stants, protection against the ill effects of sudden and irregular changes 
in temperature in the neighborhood of the apparatus was so complete 
as to obtain a closer agreement in the results of the experiments. The 
door and window were also tightened and the wooden coverings coated 
with paint. The box containing the pendulum was covered with tin- 
foil and white-lead, and the attracting masses were likewise subjected 
to a covering of tin-foil so as to free them from the action of the lamp 
which illuminated the scale. To still further secure the apparatus from 
sudden changes of temperature during a series of observations all oper- 
ations were conducted without entering the room, employing electricity 
to mark the correct height of the cylinders when their positions were 
changed. 

With the precautions just referred to, it was possible not only to keep 
the temperature of the room constant during a series of observations, 
but also to eliminate, so far as the thermometer would show, the effect 
of the warmth of the lamp, which was apparent during the first set of 
experiments. 

A disturbance was however noticeable, caused by a temporary hori- 
zontal stratification of temperature, which in the neighborhood of the 
apparatus was interrupted by the changing of the masses whose tem- 
peratures were unequal. I sought to compensate the operation of this 
interruption by so attaching lead disks of the same diameter as the 
cylinders that they remained in every position opposite the masses, in 
this way securing at each change the same temperature throughout any 
horizontal cross-section of the pendulum. 

The order of observing is essentially the same as during the former 
series; however, instead of having a pause in the middle of the set, with 
four readings on each side, or before and after, the eight or ten readings 
of the elongations of the pendulum were consecutive, in this way 
making it possible to discuss the observations of a day as equably dis- 
tributed over the period of observation. In the determination of the 
time of oscillation of the pendulum after the removal of the extra weight 
on its upper end a better method was adopted by computing the desired 
quantity directly from the means of two series of observations separated 
from one another by a considerable interval. « 

In the first experiments I computed numerically the attraction of the 
masses upon the pendulum rod. The result was important, especially 
as a control or check upon the experiments, but on account of the un- 
certainty in the computation of certain constants which entered into 
the work, it was not to be compared with the latter results which were 
obtained by an empirical elimination. In these computations this con- 
trol could be dispensed with, thus relieving one of the numerical work 



646 MISCELLANEOUH PAPERS. 

which the determination of the moments of the pendulum required. On 
the other hand it was desirable to make surer the empirical elimination 
or ascertaining of these constants by increasing and modifying' the ob- 
servations. I have therefore made a series of observations, using on 
the pendulum balls of lead the same size but heavier than the brass 
balls, which, combined with the series made without any balls, gave an- 
other result independent of the result obtained when the brass balls were 
used. 

In all other respects the method of reduction was the same as dui ing 
the first determination. 

The value found for the mean density is 5.579i 0.012. 



AMERRIQUES, AMERIGHO VESPUCCI, AND AMERICA. 



By Jules Marcou. 



INTRODUCTION. 



The Amerriques tribe of ludiaus, uow few ia number, are confined 
to their mountains, called Sierra Amerrique, which form the cordillera 
between Lake Nicaragua and the Mosquito coast, in the province of 
Chontales, Nicaragua. 

By a combination of circumstauees, not rare, in what pertain to the 
first discoveries made in the New World, the name of Amerrique was 
not printed or perhaps even written in documents until 1872, when the 
late Thomas Belt, a naturalist of genius, during an exploration of 
Nicaragua, heard of the name and used it in his excellent and very 
remarkable book "The Naturalist in Nicaragua," Loudon, 1874. De 
Humboldt says : '^ Les pays d^couverts les premiers sont aujonrd'hui 
oublies et presque deserts." (See '• Examen critique de I'histoire de la 
geographic du nouveau continent," vol. iii, p. 381, Paris, 1839.) 

SIERRA AMERRIQUE AND THE AMERRIQUES. 

I quote all I have been able to gather on the subject : 
"At a short distance to the west (of Fairbairn's ranch, 2 leagues from 
Libertad, Nicaragua), rise the precipitous rocks of the Amerrique range, 
with great perpendicular cliffs, and huge isolated rocks and piuacles. 
The name of this range gives us a clue to the race of the ancient inhab- 
itants. In the highlands of Honduras, as has been noted by Squiers, 
the termiuation of tique or 7-ique is of frequent occurrence iu the name 
of places, as Ghaparristique, Lapaterrique, Llotique, Ajuterique, and oth- 
ers. The race that inhabited this region were the Leuca Indians. - • - 
I think that the Leuua Indians were the ancient inhabitants of Chon- 
tales, - - - and that they were partly conquered, and their territories 
encroached upon by the latter before the arrival of the Spaniards." 
Now the Chontales Indians are confined to the western part of the 
province of that name (departamento de Chontales), west of the cordil- 
lera or Amerrique range; while all the eastern part, as far as the Mos- 
quito coast (Reserva Mosquita), is inhabited by uncivilized Indians

called Caribisi or Caraibs, and also Araerriques, Carcas, and Eainas In- 
dians — tribus de aborigenes no civilizados — as they are called on maps of 
Nicaragua. 

On Fairbairn's Ranch : " There are many evidences of a large Indian 
jiopnlation having lived at this spot, and their pottery and fragments 
of their stones for bruising maize have been found in some graves that 
have been opened." - - - " There are many old Indian graves, covered 
with mounds of earth and stones." (See "The IS^aturalist in Nicara- 
gua," p. 154.) At page 324, Belt refers again to the cordillera, saying: 
"About noon we came in sight of the Amerrique range, which I recog 
nized at once, and knew that we had reached the Juigalpa district." 

As regards gold. Belt, the engineer of the Chontales Gold Mining 
Company, during his four years' residence in Nicaragua, was particu- 
larly well posted as to the location of the mines ; and he says : " Gold 
raining at Santo Domingo is confined almost entirely to auriferous 
quartz lodes, no alluvial deposits having been found that will pay for 
working. - - - The gold does not occur pure, but is a natural alloy 
of gold and silver, containing about three parts of the former to one 
of the latter. - - - The small town of Libertad is the principal min- 
ing centre of Chontales. There are a great number of gold mines in its 
vicinity." 

The absence of paying placers, or auriferous alluvial gravels, in the 
valleys of the Rios Mico and Carca, the two main affluents of the Rio 
Blewfields, shows that they had been worked out in the old Indian time. 

The following letter from Mr. Belt, written a short time before his 
premature death,* is interesting, because it gives his impression after 
reading my first paper on the " Origin of the name America," published 
in the Atlantic Monthly for March, 1876 : 

London, April 8, 1878. 
M. Jules Marcou, 

iSaliiis, Jura, France: 
My Dear Sir : I am much obliged to you for your kind letter and 
the copy of your most ingenious speculation respecting the origin of the 
name " Amerique." 

The Amerrique range in Nicaragua was well kuown to me, and the 
curious coincidence with the name of the continent had often struck me, 
but only as a coincidence. 

I hope your suggestion will receive the attention it deserves, and that 
the origin of the name will be thoroughly inquired about. Should it 
turn out as you believe, you will have cleared up a most interesting 
point. 

I am, dear sir, yours very truly, 

Thomas Belt. 

In 1887, by a happy circumstance, I was able to communicate with 
Senator Don Jos6 D. Rodriguez, of Managua (Nicaragua), who lived for 

"Thomas Belt, born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1832, died at Kansas City (Kansas), 
the 2l8t of September, 1878. 



THE NAME AMERICA. 649 

many years iu the dsitrict of Chontales, and who was also a i)ersonal 
friend of Thomas Belt. Here are extracts from two of his letters to me : 

Washington, D. C, December 29, 1887. 

- - - The word Amerrique is ]>ronounced as Mr. Thomas Belt wrote 
it by the natives of the tribe, with whom I have conversed. These In- 
dians seem to have been formerly a powerful tribe. At a distance from 
the sierra (range), iu the level ground, there are extensive spaces which 
were at one time cemeteries and undoubtedly belonged to these Indians. 

It is certain that towards the south other tribes inhabited that region. 
It is, moreover, easy to note that they kept up, from a very ancient date, 
a communication with the Atlantic coast, cultivating probably friendly 
relations with the once war-like tribe of the Moscos, who held the coun- 
try from about Laguna de Caratasca (Honduras) and the Cape Gracias 
a Dios to a little south of the Laguna de Perlas and the rio Blewhelds. 

At the present day the Amerriques are few in number, but I do not 
feel able, at the moment, to give any sufficient reason for the fact. They 
are not molested by any one and they live at their ease in their mount- 
ains, but it is evident that no long time will elapse before they disap- 
pear entirely, perhaps by absorption into other tribes. - - - Mr. 
Thomas Belt, to whom you refer, must have had occasion to know the 
mountains and the Indians of that name during a journey which he 
made over the cordillera to Matagalpa and Segovia. I served under the 
order of that gentleman iu the mines of Chontales, and enjoyed the 
honor of his friendship and confidence. 

Washington, January 12, 1888. 

- - - I can assure you. that the insinuation, ascribed to Mr. Peralta, 
that the name Amerrique was invented by my deceased friend, Mr. 
Thomas Belt, is an entirely gratuitous one. The mountain range and 
the tribe of the Amerriques have existed in Nicaragua for centuries 
which it is beyond our power to determine ; and these facts may be veri- 
fied at any moment. Moreover, Mr. Belt was a serious person, who 
would never have lent himself to a deception. 

This protest of Senator J. D. Rodriguez was brought out by the posi- 
tion taken by a few opponents, who claimed that because the map- 
makers have not inscribed the name Amerrique on any of the maps 
known until now, the name Amerrique applied to a chain of mountains 
of Nicaragua was created out of Mr. Belt's " inner consciousness." 
Don Manuel M. de Peralta, minister of Costa Rica at Washington, wrote 
a letter to the President of the Republic of Nicaragua, Don Ad. Car- 
denas, asking if there really is in "el departamento de Chontales" a 
chain of mountains known by the name of Amerique, Amerrique, or 
Americ. The answer not only confirmed the existence of the Sierra 
Amerrique, but also of a tribe of Indians called " los Amerriques" ; and 
that the spelling of the name was as Mr. Belt wrote it: Amerrique^ with 
two r's. 

From those well-authenticated facts, we can be fully confident that 
there are still in existence the remnants of an Indian tribe calling them- 
selves Amerriques^ formerly powerful, and extending over a great part 
of the ground between the Lake of Nicaragua and the Atlantic coast. 



650 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS. 

The mountains to wliicli they are now confined are called Amerrique 
range, or Sierra Amerrique; and they h a v^e occupied for centuries the 
richest gold area of the region. The gold mines are numerous and are 
worked even to this day, on a great scale, round Libertad, Santo Do- 
mingo, and Juigalpa, where great quantities of th^ precious metal have 
been and are still extracted. The name Juigalpa (Huzgalpa) means 
the country of gold; and the name of the Mosquito coast in the Indian lan- 
guage is Tauzgalpa, or Taguzgalpa. Gnlpa means gold, so that the true 
uame of the country between the Cape Gracias a Diosto the Rios Rama 
and San Juan, instead of being Mosquito coast or Mosquita, is, accord- 
ing to the aborigines. Gold Coast. 

Now let us see about the first explorations by European navigators 
of the coast of the central part of the New World. 

FIRST VOYAGE OF VESPUCCI. 

From the beginning we are confronted by the most contested of Ves- 
pucci's voyages. May, 1497, to October, 1498. Las Casas, Henera, 
Charlevoix, Robertson, Tiraboschi, Muiioz, Navarette, and Washing- 
ton Irving declare that the author of the "Quatuor Navigationes" has 
forged his first voyage. Alexander de Humboldt, after calling his so- 
called first voyage pretendu, tries to show an alibi for Vespucci, who, 
according to his opinion, was then in Sevilla and at San Lucar super- 
intending the arming of a fleet for the third voyage of Cristoforo Co- 
lombo, from April, 1497, to May, 1498; and accordingly in a material 
impossibility of having then accomplished his first voyage, which fin- 
ally he calls ^^problematic voyage of a contested date,"* admitting as 
proved that the date of May 10 or 20, 1497, is false. 

FA. deVarnhagen is the only person who has accepted and maintained 
by excellent arguments and proofs drq,wn from the three historians, 
Pierre Martyr d'Aughiera, Oviedo and Goinara, the authenticity of the 
first voyage. After a careful study of all the objections, I have come 
to the same conclusion with Varnhagen, who correctly says, that " if 
the first voyage is not true, all fall to the ground ;" and also, "if we 
admit that Vespucci has been guilty of not telling the truth in regard 
to such an important voyage, then we must treat him as a forger and 
an imposter, and accept nothing of all that he says in his four voyages." 
In fact, if the first voyage is a fable, or even only ''problematic," Ves- 
pucci is a fabulist and an imposter who can not be trusted. But I do 
not believe' it is the case. Vespucci, according to the great admiral, 
Cristoforo Colombo, was a good man {es mucho hombre de bien), unfor- 
tunate in his commercial enterprise, but eagerly looking out to 
get a reputation of being a great discoverer and traveler, what I have 
called him before, a tanjino, in Italian {Nouvelles recherches, p. 80, Paris, 
1888.) 

* Examen critique, vol. iv, p. 292. 



THE NAME AMERICA. 651 

According to Vanihagen the chiefs of this expedition of 1497 were V. 
Y. Pinson and J. D. de Solis; they first saw the land in the vicinity of 
the Cape Gracias a Dios, and after two days' sailing, in following a sandy 
coast, they stoi)ped at a small harbor near the Lagima de Oaratasca, 
Honduras. They met there a great many Indians of the Caraibes type, 
some of whom possessed a few gold ornaments, which they got from 
some neighboring tribes. As we know now that the Amerriques Indi- 
ans had relations with the Caraibes of the coast as far as the Laguna 
de Caratasca, we have here the first contact of the Spaniards with the 
Indians possessing a little gold on the coast of Central America; and 
it is possible that the name Amerrique was then spoken of as a tribe of 
Indians and a country rich in gold, for it is the only gold area of that 
part of the coast of Honduras. 

THE LAST VOYAGE OF COLOMBO. 

Oristoforo Colombo in bis fourth and last voyage sighted the Cape 
Gracias ^ Dios the 14th of September, 1502, followed all along the Mos- 
quito coast, until he stopped at Quiriviri (Huerta Island), now Booby 
Island, opposite the Indian village of Cariai at the mouth of the Eio 
Rama. He staid there ten days, from the 25th of September until 
the 5th of October. There he repaired his vessels and let his crews 
recruit after their very fatiguing navigation from Cuba. 

The Indians were friendly and there was a great deal of communica- 
tion and intercourse between them and the one hundred and fifty sea- 
men composing the crews of his four caravels (schooners). Colombo 
in his Lettera rarissima says that at Cariai he heard of gold mines in 
the province of Ciamba ; that he took with him two Indians who con- 
ducted him to another place called Carambaru, where the aborigines 
are always naked and carry round their necks mirrors in gold, which 
they declined to exchange on any account. At Cariai, tbe Indians 
named several places where gold mines existed ; the last named being 
Veragua, 25 leagues distant. 

As de Humboldt says, that letter is not clear ; it is written in a mel- 
ancholy mood, and characterized by many obscuriti< s and want of 
order, due to many injustices and deceptions to which Colombo was 
subjected at the end of his life. Colombo was then an old man, almost 
infirm, when he wrote the letter at Jamaica, the 7th July, 1503, just 
after returning from the rich gold region of Veragua; being badly treated 
by the governor, Ovando, his mind was more or less affected by his suf- 
fering, and it is not strange if he did not give all the details and all the 
names of the countries rich in gold, as well as the names of the Indian 
tribes with which he came in contact. 

However, from his letter, we can say almost to a certainty that Cariaf 
was at the mouth of the Eio Rama, that Colombo heard there of the 
tribe of Amerriques as possessing a good deal of gold, which the Span- 
iards were so anxious to get; that he took with him two Indians with 



652

TH?: NAME AMERICA. 653 

whom he went to Carambaru, another land. Carambaru in all proba- 
bility, as we Ksball see if we consult a map of the coast, was at or near 
the mouth of the Rio Blewfields and there he found Indians wearing 
round their necks mirrors in gold which they declintd to trade away. 

Those Indians can not be any others than the Amerriques, who then 
inhabited the gold area of the province of Ciamba, occupying all the 
placcres of the Eios Mico and Carca, the two main affluents of the Rio 
Blewfi* Ids. Being not successful in his endeavor to get their gold mir- 
rors, Colombo was not well disposed to speak much of those Indians, 
and he did not give their name nor the name of the country from which 
they got the gold, speaking only of the province of Ciamba and the vil- 
lage of Carambaru, without localizing the area of gold in the Sierra 
Amerrique, as he <lid for Veragua. 

But because Colombo did not write the name Amerrique in his letter 
to the King and Queen of Spain it does not follow that he did not hear it ; 
and it would be against all that we know of discoverers of gold regions 
if the name Amerrique was not heard and afterwards repeated by Co 
lombo and the one hundred and fifty men of his crews. If Colombo 
is the oniy man who ever wrote a.nything about that eventful and diffi- 
cult voya^ ?, all his hundred and fifty companions spoke at their return 
of what tliey saw and heard during the voyage ; and it is to them, and 
probably filso to Colombo, that is due the spread among the people of 
the nam" Amerrique as a country rich in gold and of Indians of that 
name po:-.^esri".^, gold mirrors as their only article of dress. The name 
passed from moith to mouth, first among seamen, and then it pene- 
trated iut \'j€ continent of Europe so fast that in less than twelve 
years the name Amerrique was generally used to designate the New 
World, according to a contemporary, John Schoener, of Bamberg. 

That the name came from the masses of the people and not from the 
few scholars who could read and write Latin is admitted by everybody. 
Officially the name was " Las Indias" and "New World." Until 1520 
we do not possess a single map with the name America, and if any ex- 
isted with that name, they have been lost and destroyed, since their 
number must have been extremely limited ; and they can not be quoted 
as having spread the name among the people, who then did not know 
how to read, for we must always have in mind that it was the begin- 
ning of the sixteenth century and that the number of people able to 
read and write was very small and formed a special class far above the 
common people and having only occasional contact with the masses. 

In resume, Colombo and his one hundred and fifty companions saw 
Indians on the Mosquito coast wearing gold mirrors round their necks 
and otherwise naked. They had long talks with them in regard to 
countries and peoples where the gold existed in their neighborhood. 
We know now that those Indians were the Amerriques Indians, that they 
live still in the most productive gold area of that region, and that the 
Sierra Amerrique is, according to Thomas Belt, the most conspicuous

land-mark between Lake Nicaragua and the Atlantic coast. After the 
last voyage of Colouibo of 1503 the name Amerrique spread so fast in 
Europe among the sailors and common people tliat in 1515 it was gen- 
erally adopted and used to designate the New World. Such are facts 
which seem well established. 

Now we come to the singnlar and rather mysterious christening of 
the New World at St. Die, in Lorraine. 

CONFUSION OF VESPUCCl'S CHRISTIAN NAME. 

The Christian name of Vespucci is an example of confusion unique 
in history. Being an Italian, it was to be expected that his first name 
would be given exactly by his countrymen ; on the contrary, they are the 
authors of all the confusions. As far back as 1503, or 1504 at most, the 
Italians Lorenzo Pier Francisco di Medicis, of Florence, and Giovanni 
del Giocondo, of Verona, call Verpucci Albericus, a Christian name well 
known ; and even since, until a few years ago, Italians, and more espe- 
cially Florentins, have persisted in calling him Alberico and even Alber- 
tutio. I made diligent researches to know exactly Vespucci's Christ- 
ian name. In a country like Tuscany and its capital Florence, where 
so many erroneous and forged documents have api)eared on Vespucci 
in manuscripts, letters, printed books, and even inscriptions engraved 
on marble that I was obliged to be very careful before accepting any 
name that it should be well authenticated by indisputable documents. 
After many researches I did not find anything certain juntil the appear- 
ance of the firstletter of Vespucci to Laurentio Petri de Medicis, with the 
name Albericus Vespvthis, in 1504 or 1505. And in my second paper, 
" Nouvelles Kecherches sur I'Origine dn notn d'Ameiique" (Bulletin Soc. 
de Geographic, p. 66, Paris, 1888), 1 say : "As long as the Christian name 
of Vespucci has not been submitted to a very minute and exact control, 
we must remain in doubt as to which is the true oue, Alberico or 
Amerigo.'''' - - - "The question has a certain importance, although 
its solution does not touch the vital and most important part of the 
origin of the name America, which remains undecided between the 
poetical license of Jean Basin and the indigenous name in the New 
World of Amerrique. The decision of this point will involve Vespucci 
more or less according to the help which he may have given, perhaps 
without knowing it, to the christening at St. Die." 

It is true that I inclined then toward Alberico instead of Amerigo for 
the Christian name of Vespucci, and in my second paper I have given 
reasons which seemed to sustain that view ; saying, however, several 
times in speaking of ^wjen'^o, that it was either his true Christian name, 
or only a surname or nickname. 

Diligent researches were continued to find proof if Amerigo was truly 
an Italian Christian name; for a learned Italian friend, who then 
lived at Florence, wrote me that the name, unknown to him as a Chris- 
tian name, even after the celebrity given the name by Vespucci, was not 
used in Italy. 



THE NAME AMERICA. 655 

UAMERICUS IN DANTE AND AMERIGO IN MACHIAVELLI. 

My son, Dr. Philippe B. Marcoii, succeeded last year (1888) in finding 
twice the name Ilnmericus and Amerigo ; first in Dante Allighieri, " De 
Vulgaris eloquentia," liber secundus, caput vi, and in the Comedia di 
Mcolo Machiavelli, in his Opere, vol. nono, Milauo, 1805, where he has, 
as his first personage, Amerigo, vecchio Padrone, and as his last, frate 
Alberigo; besides he speaks at page 45 of the same volum3 in Novella 
place volissima di Nicollo Machiavelli, of a " figlinola d' Amerigo Do- 
nati." In Dante we have two provencal poets of the name Hamericus, 
written with an h, as a family name written in provencal or langue cVoc, 
" Aimeric." Even now the name Emeric is a family name in Provence. 

Dante inhabited Provence for some time, and was well acquainted 
with two Provencal poets, Emeric of Belinoi and Emeric of Peguilain ; 
and in translating the family name of Emeric into Hamericus, its Latin 
form, it does not follow that he regarded Emeric as the Provencal name 
of the Florentine Amerigho ; and we can not quote Dant6 as having 
translated the name Amerigho or Amerigo into Hamericus. 

AMERIGO IN SPAIN IN 1495. 

A short time after I received a letter from Don Marcos J. de la Es- 
pada, the most learned Americanist of Spain, and who knows more 
about the Archives de Indios than anybody else. The letter, dated 
Madrid, 22 de Marzo de 1889, says : " Por el consta que Amerigo Ves- 
pucci se llameba y se Uamabe Amerigo en las libros de cuentesy despa- 
chos de armadas -k Indias perde el auo de 1495." 

The oldest document made public in Spain before this was a receipt 
dated January 12, 1496, with only the name Vespuche, and no Christian 
name. The first time we have the Christian name of Vespucci, in well- 
authenticated documents, is iu the two letters of Cristoforo Colombo of 
the 5th and 25th of February, 1505, written two years after the return 
of Colombo from his last voyage. Kow since the discovery of Seflor de 
la Espada we have the C/hristian name Amerigo in 1495, consequently 
before any of the voyages of Vespucci to the New World, and before the

THE NAME AMERICA. . 657 

truly authentic letter of Vespucci that had yet been found in Italy. 
It was discovered by Signor Davari conservatore dell 'archivio Gronzoga 
di Mantova, and although very short — only seven lines — is most impor- 
tant for it is wholly written by Vespucci, who was, as I have said be- 
fore, an excelliMit calligraphist. The date is : Sybilie die xxx decembris 
MoCGCC'LXXXXn (Sevilla, the 30 Dec, 1492), and consequently 
before the return of Colombo from his first voyage. The very distinct 
signature is : 

Ser. Amerigho Vespucci mer- 

chante fiorentino for 

Sybilia. 
I have received a photograph of the letter and its address, by the 
courtesy of an Italian friend ; and I here give the facsimile of it, as 
well as of the signature to a letter of Vespucci to the Cardinal Arch- 
bishop of Toledo, dated Sevilla, 9 December, 1508, which was published 
in facsimile by the Spanish Government in 1878. Those two letters 
are the only authentic ones we possess; and the signatures are too 
important in the question of the origin of the name America not to be 
carefully studied. 







Now we have, without any possible doubt, the Christian name of 
Vespucci, written by himself Amerigho with only one r and an h at the 
last syllable, in 1492; and Amerigo with only one r and no 1i in the 
Libras de cuentes y despachos de armadas a Indias in 1495. 

Gilberto Govi* thinks that it is the Italian Fra Giovanni del Giocondo, 
who translated and changed too freely Amerigho into Alberico. It is 
only a personal opinion, without any base to rest upon, for the original 
letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo Pierfrancisco de Medicis is unknown. 
Generally, translators do not alter and change the signatures of authors; 
and so long as we have no positive proof to the contrary, we must say 
that Vespucci used for his Christian name, in 1502 or 1503, the name 
Alberico or Alberigo. Bat as his second letter to Piedro Soderini, writ- 
ten in 1504, is sigued Amerigo, it is evident that he did not make use of 
the name Alberico for any length of time. There are certainly strong 
susi)icions that he made use of it, not only in his first letter to Medicis, 
but also because Gomara, a Spanish historian of great reputation, in 
his General History of the Indies of 1551, uses both names, saying 
Am,erico or Alberico Vespucci, showing that in Spain the name of Al-

berico must have been known quite well during the first part of the 
sixteenth century, although we do not know a single example of the 
name having been used in any official authentic Spanish document re- 
lating to Vespucci. 

COSMOGRAPHI^ INTBODUCTIO. 

Thanks to the discoveries and researches of Alex, de Humboldt, 
D'Avezac, and a few others, we know a great deal about the Cosmo- 
graphicv Introdnctio of the Vosgian gymnasium of St. Die, in which is 
found the first announcement of the name America as the name of the 
New World. The interested reader will find all the descriptions, dis- 
sertations, and conclusions of the extraordinary value attached to ihis 
now very celebrated small quarto volume in the " Bxamen critique," 
by Alex, de Humboldt, 5 vols., Paris, 1839; "Martin Hylacomilus 
Waltzemuller," by D'Avezac, Paris, 1867; and "Nouvelles recherches 
sur I'origine du nom d'Amerique," by Jules Marcou, Paris, 1888, in 
Bulletin Soc. geographic. 

The only addition to our knowledge about the printing press of St. 
Die, is that it was removed in 1512 to Strasburg, from whence, very 
likely, it came; and that the same types used for the Gosmogra'pliiw 
Tntroductio were used at Strasburg in 1512 and 1513 to finish the print- 
ing of the Ptolemey's Geography of 1513, two-thirds of it having been 
printed at St. Di6 between 1505 and 1510, as D'Avezac has proved. So, 
instead of calling it the Strasburg's Ptoleme, it ought to be called the 
Vosgian Gymnasium Ptoleme, or at least the St. Di6 and Strasburg's 
Ptoleme. 

M. Ed. Meaume has lately proved the existence of a fourth edition, 
or more properly speaking, fourth issue, of the GosmograpMa; Introductio 
of St.-Die, which had been considered by d'Avezac and Mr. H. Harisse 
as an amalgamated copy, composed with parts taken from the first and 
third issue or edition. (See "Recherches critiques et bibliographiques 
sur Americ Vespuce et ses voyages," par Ed. Meaume, Chapitre iii, 
"La (Josmograj)hicv Introductio, dtude bibliographique sur les quatre 
premieres editions — Saint-Die, 1507, p. 83, in "Memoires de la Societe 
d'Archeologie, Lorraine," 3'^""^ s^rie, vol. xvi, Nancy, 1888.) 

The late M. Meaume thought that this rei)rint or last issue was made 
in 1508, although dated, like the third edition, 29th August, 1507. It is 
very probable that Waltzemiiller (Zlacomylus) tried a second time to 
place secretly his name as the author of the book instead of the col- 
lective name of the Vosgian Gymnasium; but being promptly detected, 
the issue was stopped at once, just as Gauthier had stopped the distri- 
bution of the first issue. This ex[)lains the great rarity of the fourth 
issue or edition. Only four copies are now known: the one called the 
Chartener's copy of Metz, now in the possession of M. Langlard, of 
Nancy; the second copy, described by Mr. Harisse in his " Bibliotheca 
Americana Vetustissima," under No. 47, p. 92, belonging to the Lenox's 



THE NAME AMERICA 



659 



Library of New York; the third copy is in the Mazarine Library in 
Paris (an incomplete copy, having only the first thirty-eight leaves); 
and the fourth copy is preserved in the city library of Besanyon 

After having been deterred twice from naming himself as the sole 
author of the St. Die book, Waltzemiiller got up a special edition of 
his own, which he had printed at Strasburg in 1509. Very likely these 
proceedings caused an estrangement and a final breach between the casti- 
aator (proof-reader) 2;iacomylus and the Vosgian Cxymnasium, and this 
was the main reason for the stopping of the St.-Di6's Ftolemey edition, 
and its transfer to Strasburg in 1512, where it was issued at last m 151d. 

" LE QUATTRO GIORNATE." 

After his success with the publication of his first letter to Lorenzo 
Pierfrancisco de Medicis, Vespucci took special precautious to have all 
his vovages well known in different parts of Europe. In his letter to 
Soderfni, of 1504, he speaks of a book written by him under the title 
" Le Quattro Giornate," which was never published, and the manu- 
script of which had escaped all researches until this day. But he wrote 
a resume of it, dated Lisbonne, September 4, 1504, taking special care 
to address it, first, to the King of Spain; second, to his friend the 
Goufiilonier of Florence; and third, to King Rene, due of Lorraine. 

The copy addressed to Ferdinand of Spain was never published, and 
until now has not been found in the archives of Spain. Probably it 
was written in Spanish, and with a dedication to the King. The copy 
addressed to Soderini was published in 1506, at Pescia, near Florence, 
by Piero Paccini, under the title, " Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle 
isole nuovamente trovate in quatro suoi viaggi," in an Italian rather 
incorrect, containing a quantity of Spanish words and phrases, as 
might be expected from a man like Vespucci, who had hved at least 
twelve years in Spain or among Spaniards. It was dedicated to His 
Ma-nificence Siguor Pietro Soderini, Perpetual Gonfalonier ot the 11- 
lustre Republic of Florence, but without the name, giving only his title 
of " Magniflce Domine," and " Vostra Mag." 

The thir<l copy was addressed to Rene, King of Sicily and Jerusalem 
and Due of Lorraine. It was published in 1507, at St. Di6, by the 
Gijmnasium Vosagense, under the title "Quattuor Americi Vesputu 
Navigationes," in Latin, translated by the Canon Jean Basin, from a 
French version. That French version was never published, or, if pub- 
lished, no copy of it has ever been found; and the manuscript is un- 
known, very likelv lost and destroyed. It is dedicated to the " Illus- 
trissimo Renato Jherusalem et Sicilio Regis ;" but for some unexplained 
reason the dedication to Soderini was copied entirely, with only the 
name of the good King Rene put instead of " Maguifice Domine, and 
i'T. M." (tua majestas) instead of " Vostra Mag.," which has been ren- 
dered by the translator from Italian into French as " Vestra Majestas 
or '^ Votre Majesty." It has been the custom to say that Jean Basm 



660 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS. 

made the change, in his Latiu version, as a sort of poetical license. But 
it is very doubtful, for King Rene received the French manuscript, and 
very likely the person who sent it made the dedication, as it is the 
custom when you address Royalty. Besides, Rene gave the manuscript 
to his secretary, Gaultier Lud, and finally Lud delivered it to Jean 
Basin ; and it is too much to suppose that Jean Basin took upon him- 
self to alter the manuscript to such an extent, for it would have raised 
protests from both Lud and the good and honest King Rene. 

Who did send the manuscript to King Rene is not known with cer- 
tainty. Alexander de Humboldt thought it was Vespucci himself, and 
everything favors the same conclusion. Vespucci was desirous of no- 
toriety as a great traveller and discoverer. He addressed his first letter 
to a Mt-dicis, after placing the relation of his third voyage in the hands 
of the King, Don Manuel of Portugal; and he addressed his second 
letter first to the King, Don Ferdinand of Spain, and second to the 
Perpetual Gonfalonier of Florence, instead of Lorenzo Pierfrancscio de 
Medicis, who was dead. Evidently Vespucci sought the good opinions 
of the great of the earth, and to acquaint them with what he did as a 
navigator and discoverer. Not knowing French, he had his manuscript 
translated, and the translator did it literally, only by an oversight of 
Vespucci he wrote the dedication to the illustrious King liene, and sub- 
stituted for Vostra Mag., " Votre Majeste." Very likely Vespucci in- 
tended to make some changes in the term of the dedication used for 
Soderini, but by some mistake or misunderstanding, or from being 
at some distance from the translator, — if the translation was made in 
Florence, which is probably the case.* Vespucci was not able to see 
that the dedication to King Rene was correct, and the elegant poet, 
Jean Basin, simply translated into Latin the French version without 
any explanation or rectification, not knowing if Vespucci really had oc- 
casion to know King Rene in his youth. 

No trace of a correspondence between Vespucci and King Rene has 
been found. We are reduced to conjecture. Vespucci was interested 
to enrol among his admirers such an important personage as the good 
King Rene, known as a Meccenas and a seeker for geographical news, 
for it is known that he had sent Ringman twice to Italy in order to 
control the texts of Ptoleme and procure the best copies it was possible 
to collect. There is no doubt that Vespucci was well informed of what 
was going on in the world. He knew that Lorenzo Pierfrancisco de 
Medicis was dead, and that his first letter had been published in Latin 
in Paris ; and he wanted his second letter to be also published in Latin 
in central Europe. 

It is possible that King Ren^ received the French translation of the 
four voyages of Vesi)ncc! from another source; only then it is difiBcult 

* The translatioa of the second letter of Vespucci iato French was made at B'lorence, 
bj' some olc well acquainted with the family of Vespucci, for the translator has added 
that Soderini and he were pupils at the school kept by the uaclo of Vespucci ; a facl 
wbioh 18 uot indicated ia the Italian edition. 



THE NAME AMERICA. 661 

to account for the position taken by Jean Basin and the whole Vosgian 
Gj'iunasinm, that Vespucci was the discoverer of the New World, a 
posi tion wliicli can not have been taken lightly and without the knowledge 
and consent of King Rene. It was well known that Cristoforo Colombo 
was the discoverer ; and the members of the Vosgian Gymnasium can 
not have ignored the fact, because the first voyage of Colombo had been 
published not only in Paris, but also in Strasburg in 1497 ; and Ring- 
man, who had inhabited Paris and had been twice in Italy, must have 
been well acquainted with all the history of the first vo^'age of 
Colombo. 

The reference of the discovery of the New World to Vespucci by the 
Vosgian Gymnasium of St. Die in 1^07 is a very suspicious act, which 
can not be explained, except that a conspiracy existed after the death 
of Colombo to reduce, and even obliterate, the great celebrity attached 
to his memory, and that Vespucci was a party to, or at least helped 
secretly, the undertaking. The members of the Vosgian Gymnasium 
were not in a position to decide so bluntly', as they did, th;it Vespucci 
was the discoverer of the New World ; and it is impossible to explain 
the position they have taken, without supposing that they had recourse 
to underhand influences, and a special desire to create a rival and an 
adversary to Colombo. 

The second letter of Vespucci is written in a very careful way, in 
order to escape all associations with any of the other navigators. He 
has taken a special care not to name a single commander or chief of 
the expeditions in which he was engaged, and any one not well 
acquainted with all the first voyages to the New World will easily be 
deceived, and be led to believe that he was in command himself. As I 
have said before, his two published letters are the work of a very 
shrewd man, a tan fino in Italian. It is unique in maritime voyages 
that a man who was a subordinate does not give the name of the chief 
of his expeditions. That he may have passed over one of those names 
may be understood and regarded as a forgetful ness of no great conse- 
quence, but that all four are i»assed silently over is a case of willful 
negligence. 

Vespucci certainly addressed the manuscripts of his voyages to the 
Kings of Spain and Portugal, to a Medicis and to the Perpetual Gon- 
falonier of Florence ; and it is reasonable and natural to suppose that 
he did send them also to King Rene, Due of Lorraine. The other sup- 
position, that King Rene received the French translation of the four 
navigations of Vespucci from another source can not be accepted, unless 
it was proved by authentic facts and documents, which is not the case. 

Humboldt says : " Vespucci was in correspondence with Rene II" * 
Unhappily nothing has been found yet in the archives of Lorraine on 
the subject, and we are reduced to probabilities and inductions.

662 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS. 

AMERIGE, AMERICUS, AND AMERICA. 

However this may be decided, the Vosgian Gymaasium published in 
April, 1507, a Latiu translation of the resume of the four voyages of 
Vespucci, and in the introduction, Cosmographiw Introduction is the 
christening of the New World under the name of America, in honor of 
Americus {Amerige) Vespucius, who discovered it. 

It took many years to prove that Vespucci was not the discoverer of 
the terra firm a of the New World and consequently had no valitl clam 
to its name, and the numerous and voluminous discussions and contro- 
versies on this subject have lasted until this century. 

Jean Basin, the translator from the French into Latin of the " Qua- 
tuor navigatioues" of Vespucci, instead of retaining the word Amerige 
for the Christian name of Vespucci, as it was in the manuscript, turned 
it into Americus. He knew perfectly well that it was a very free trans- 
lation, not easy to accept without an explanation, and consequently he 
took the precaution to print in two places of this small book the word 
Amerige very conspicuously opposite Americus. in order to show that by 
Americus he means the Christian name of Vespucci. The French trans- 
lator from the original Italian text did not translate AmeH^/o bj Americ, 
or jE/mmc, or Mmeric, but by Amerige-, it was only in 1515, when a 
French translation by Mathurin Du Redouer of the third voyage of Ves- 
pucci appeared in Paris, that Amerigo was translated into Emeric and 
not Amerige; and strange to say, Redouer translated it from the cele- 
brated collection of Vicenza of 1507, in which the Christian name of 
Vespucci is Alberico ; showing what confusion Vespucci and his friends 
had already created by using indiscriminately the word Amerigo and 
Alberico, two different names in Florence, where Machiavelli in his 
Camellia uses both for two entirely different personages called Amerigo 
and Alberigo. 

TRIPLE ERRORS IN THE CHRISTENING OF ST. DIE. 

The Vosgian Gymnasium first attributed the discovery of the New 
World to Vespucci in 1507, t wo years after the death of Colombo, and 
during the life of Vespucci, who did not die until 1512. Vespucci did not 
rectify the error, and no document exists which shows any steps taken 
by him to decline the honor. This absence of protestation on his part 
has a tendency to sustain the idea that it was he who suggested to 
King Rene and the Vosgian Gymnasium that he was the discoverer of the 
New World, for both Rene and the Gymnasium knew beyond any pos- 
sible doubt the great discovery of 1492 by Cristoforo Colombo, and 
the only excuse in their favor which can be given is, that Vespucci 
claimed to have discovered the terra firma, the discoveries of Colombo 
being confined to the islands, and that he succeeded in impressing on 
those far away Lorrainers that fallacious idea. 



THE NAME AMERICA. 663 

As to the cbiisieuiiig of the New World with the name Americus, in 
honor of Americus Vespucius, the Vosgian Gymnasiuni has gone out 
of all rules, not only in giving the Christian name of a traveller or navi- 
gator to a great country, but also in spelling his name, transforming 
Amerige or Amerigo into Americ. It is a well known rule that names 
given to any great country newly discovered are either the family 
name, if in honor of the discoverer, or the Christian name of some mem- 
bers of royal reigning families. We can quote : " Strait of Magellan, 
Hudson Bay, Vancouver Island, Juan Fernandez Island, Colombia and 
Columbia, Washington, Van Diemen Land or Tasmania; Cook, Laper- 
ouse, Torres, and Davis Straits ; Baffin Bay, Parry Islands, Kerguelen 
Islands, Heard Islands, Crozet Islands, Tristan do Cunha Island, Ker- 
madec Island, Bougainville Island, Lord Howe Island, Fernando do 
Noromha Island, Grinnell Land, Wilkes Land, etc. ; and on the other 
side: Carolina, Marjiand, Virginia, Georgia, Victoria, Philippine 
Islands, Queen Charlotte Islands, Charlestown, Charles River, Cape 
Charles, Jamestown, James River, Isabel Island, Port Adelaide, Terre 
Louis Philippe, Franz Joseph Land, etc. 

If the explanation of the Vosgian Gymnasium is accepted the only 
exception to the rule is a continent covering a hemisphere, — that is to 
say the greatest geographical fact existing, and that in the face of a fact 
admitted by everybody, even the Vosgian Gymnasium in the Ptoleme 
of J 513, that Cristoforo Colombo discovered the New World. 

The name Amerigho, or Amerigo, or Amerige, which are the three 
variations in spelling known until 1507, would give in Latin : Amerigo- 
nius, Amerighius, Amerigo, or even Amerige, but not Americus. Jean 
Basin, in making such a lapsus lingcv, must have been influenced and 
entirely directed by the aboriginal name of Amerrique, which reached 
Europe four years before, and had time to spread as a name of a coun- 
try and a tribe of Indians rich in gold, for in 1503 Colombo and his one 
hundred and fifty seamen returned from Cariai and Carambaru on the 
Mosquito Coast. Being assured by some one, perhaps directly by Ves- 
pucci himself, or indirectly through Laurent Phrisius (Fries) of Metz, 
an attache to the service of the Due of Lorraine; the canon Jean Basin, 
— an enthusiast like all poets, and a master in the art of eloquence and 
fine writing, — perceiving the analogy between the christian name of 
Vespucci, Amerigho, and more especially Amerige, and the somewhat 
popular name of Amerrique, Basin thought that a part of the New World 
was already named after the Christian name of Vespucci, and instead 
of proposing to call the New World Vespuccia, as he ought to have 
done, he called it America. A poetical creation due to a too great im- 
aginative power. Beside the erroneous notion of the discovery of the 
New World by Vespucci, Basin committed another error, that the name 
Amerrique must be derived from Amerige, creating a confusion which 
was absolutely inexplicable, without the knowledge we have now of 
the existence of a tribe of Indians called Amerriques, inhabiting a conn-

try rich in gold, and carrying round their necks mirrors of gold at the 
time of Colombo's visit in 1502. 

The Vosgian Gymnasium is responsible for the christening, but it is 
certain that no one of the other members, except Basin, had any en- 
thusiasm about it, or even any symi)athy with it, for no one of them 
uses the word America in any of their publications. The proof-reader 
(castigator) Martin Hylacomylus (Waltzemiiller) wrongly credited as the 
God-father of the New World, was not a partisan of the name America, 
for he does not use it in any of his publications, not even on his map of 
the New World of the Ptoleme of 1513, called only Terra nove, without 
the name America anywhere. The canon Gauthier Lud, secretary of 
the Due of Lorraine, did not use it in his : Speculi orhis declaratio, etc., 
1507, and Eingmann, the Vosgian poet and professor of cosmography 
(geography) at St. Die and afterward at Basel, never quoted it. 

The only publication in which the name America is found, after the 
proposition of the Vosgian Gymnasium in 1507, is in the " Globus 
mundi," 1509, Strasburg, without name of author, but which is attributed 
to Jean Basin, the translator of the " Qiiatuor Navigationes," and the 
true God-father of the New World, and there it is found only once in 
the chapter De Descriptio Terrce. 

IN 1515 THE NAME AMERICA IS ALREADY POPULAR. 

John Shoener, of Bamberg, in his " Luculentissima qujedam terrre 
totius descriptio, etc.," published in 1515, makes the important and sig- 
nificant remark that the name America was already accepted, used, and 
popular. How can the name have been popular in 1515, when it has 
been impossible to find it printed on a single map, and in no other books 
than the small and extremely rare pamphlets of the Cosmographue Intro- 
dnctio and the Globus' mundi f To be sure, some maps with the name 
America may have existed then; but not one of them has reached us, 
all having been destroyed, for the preservation of maps is more diffi- 
cult than the preservation of pamphlets, especially when the maps are 
on a large scale. Only during the first quarter, and even half, of the 
sixteenth century all the printed maps were small, on account of the ma- 
terial difficulties in their engraving and the writing of names on them ; 
and their preservation was facilitated by their publication in books in 
which they w^ere inserted, like the Ptolemeys. Large-scale maps existed 
then in manuscript, and besides the map of Juan de la Oosa of 1500, the 
map of Sebastian Cabot of 1544, and many others now existing in tht* 
archives of Europe, we know with certainty that many more have been 
destroyed or lost, among them all the maps of Vespucci and the first 
map of Sebastian Cabot, 

The only dated maj) we possess now with the name America, is the 
one of Apianus (Pierre Bienewitz), inserted in the "Polyhistor" of 
Solinus, 1520. The Ptoleme of 1522, of Strasburg, gave the same map, 
with the name America. Laurent Frisius or Phrisius of Metz, is the 



THE NAME AMERICA. 665 

editor, and at the reverse of tlie folio numbered 100, he names Martin 
Ilacomylus as the author of the map, and even of all the maps of that 
new edition. But Ilacomylus had been dead for some time, and it is 
almost certain that the name America was not put there by him, but 
more likely by Laurent Phrisius himself, who was probably the medium 
between Vespucci, Pierre Martyr d'Aughiera, and the Due of Lorraine. 
It is plain that the name America can not have been popular in 1515, 
except that it has passed from mouth to mouth among illiterate people, 
as the masses were then. Shoener was a contemporary, well acquainted 
with the discoveries of the New World, and it is impossible to accept the 
idea that its popularity was an error on his part. 

VESPUTIA AND CABOTIA. 

Let us make a few suggestions in order to show the absolute impos- 
sibility of referring to the christian name of Vespucci the origin of the 
name America. If the rule to give the family name of the discoverer 
to a new country had been followed — although Vespucci was not the 
discoverer— Jean Basin and the Vosgian Gymnasium would have called 
the New World Vesputia. Does any one entertain for an instant the 
idea that the proposition of the Vosgian Gymnasium would have stood 
any chance of being accepted, or even been the object of any discussion ? 
or controversy ? The proposition to call the northern part of the New 
World Cabotia, in honor of Cabot, although sustained by the well proved 
fact that Sebastian Cabot first discovered North America — at least 
scientifically, for the Norsemen certainly anticipated his discovery by 
several centuries — was never accepted and not even discussed. 

AMERIGIA AND ALBERICIA. 

If we say that the Vosgian Gymnasium and its leader Jean Basin, in 
the matter of christening the new continent, were conscious that it was 
well to diverge from the rule of using family names, and that it was best 
to use the Christian name — although without a single precedent, even 
in antiquity — why did they choose a name so different from the christ- 
ian name of Vespucci, for if they followed the orthography of the dif- 
ferent names before them, they ought to have called the New World 
Amerigia (for Amerige), Amerigonia {for Amerigo), or Albericia (for Al- 
bericus). To write those names and pronounce them aloud suffices to 
show that they were not likely to be used by a majority of those who 
were accustomed in one way or another, as traders, seamen, adventur- 
ers, colonists, statesmen, or religious men, to speak of the new continent. 

POETICAL LICENSE OF JEAN BASIN. 

The assimilation of the Christian name of Vespucci, Amerige or 
Amerigho, to the gold-mirror Indians Amerriques, or their country 
Sierra Amerrique, is simply a fiction, in which Jean Basin took the 
name of an Indian tribe and of a country of the New World and placed 



666 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS. 

it ou Vespucci, either as a poetical license or as a sort of joke without 
any consequence. 

Unhappily the matter has been taken very seriously, more so than 
the originator even thought of; for the Vosgian Gymnasium took very 
quietly tbe correction that Vespucci was not the discoverer, and they 
were prepared to do the same as to their naming of America from 
Amerigho Vespucci; only the matter was considered as too trifling by 
those interested in the question, such as the son of Colombo, to require 
a correction. The attribution of the discoveiy to Cristoforo Colombo 
was considered siitflcient; and that the name of Amerrique has nothing 
to do with Vespucci was so evident and such a matter of course that 
nobody cared to correct the vagary of a Vosgian poet. 

The name Amerrique continued to be used among the people, just 
like the names Chryse, El Dorado, Quivira, etc., and the map makers 
wrote the name America as they pleased, on many places of the new 
continent, without following in the least the proposition of the Vosgian 
Gymnasium, which passed entirely unnoticed until found out more 
than three centuries after by Alexander de Humboldt. If the geogra- 
phers who constructed maps during the sixteenth century had thought 
that the New World was named from the Christian name of Vespucci, 
as that name varied according to the numerous pamphlets of his third 
voyage and his "Quatuor Navigationes" into Alberico, Amerigo, 
Amergio, Almerigo, Albertutio, Damerigho, Armeuico, Morigo, some 
of them would have certainly used such names as Albericia, Amerigia 
Amerigonia, Amergia, Alraerigia, Albertutia, Armenica, Morigia. But 
the name America is ne varietur, without a single case of different spell- 
ing, showing that Amerrique was in general circulation, and that they 
made use of it without thinking if it was in honor of Vespucci or not. 
'•Le mot etait dans I'air," as the French say for all popular expres- 
sion, and all the variations of the Christian name of Vespucci have not 
the slightest influence on it. 

Little by little the aboriginal name of Amerrique and its derivative 
America took possession, first of the maps, and afterwards of all the 
chancelleries and state departments of all Europe, the Spanish one 
included, without much thought about the injustice committed toward 
Colombo, or any desire on their part to raise Vespucci above the very 
small position he occupied as third rnte navigator. 

The whole is an example of a sort of process of infiltration, coming 
from the masses where it unconsciously originated, entirely outside of 
the doing of a few Latinists lost in their books and manuscripts, and 
which eventually covered half of the earth's surface, carrying pSlemele 
partisans and adversaries of Colombo and Vespucci, sure that in the 
end truth will prevail over all false pretensions, obscurities, and errors. 

After all the incorrect reference of the name of the New World to 
Amerigho Vespucci has lasted a little less than four centuries, even less 
than the forgetfulness which has kept in the background the discov-

eries of tbe Norsemen Bjarni and Leif Ericksen, at the end of the tenth 
century: a small number of years when compared to the past human 
history and its great future. Tbe fourth centenarian anniversary of 
the -reatest event for the human race will be celebrated without the 
feelin- that the name of the New World is derived from a third-rate 
navioator, without any claim to such an honor and to the detriment and 
great injustice of the great discoverer, Colombo; but that it originated 
simply from a tribe of Indians and a mountain range of the new conti- 
nent itself The name Amerrique is equal to and of as much poetical 
beauty as Niagara, Ontario, Canada, Monongahela, Mississippi, Mis- 
souri, Arkansas, Alabama, Dakota, Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala, 
Cuba, Panama, Veragua, Chimborazo, Peru, Venezuela, etc. 

VESPUCCI CHANGES THE SPELLING OF HIS CHRISTIAN NAME. 

When Vespucci received a copy of the " Cosmographia3 Intro.luctio" 
of St Di^, at the end of 1507, he must have been more than gratified; 
for not onlv in it he is qualified as the discoverer of the New World, 
which very likely he wanted to be, but more, the name of Amerrique 
was attributed to him, and that name was extended to the whole of the 
new country. An ambitious man has seldom seen his desires so well 

If Vespucci had been '• es mucho hombre de bien" as Colombo thought, 
he would have taken proper steps to correct the very great errors com- 
mitted by the Vosgiau Gvmnasium, and referred to Cristoforo Colombo 
as the true discoverer of the New World; but notwithstanding that Ves- 
pucci lived five years more, he did nothing of the kind, and nistead we 
see he did all he could to sustain the scheme of naming the New World 
after him, by correcting the orthography of his Christian name. Until 
then he wrote Amerigho, as is proved by his letter of U92, the earliest 
authentic autograph of him that we possess, while his other letter of 
the 9th of December, 150^ addressed to the Archbishop of Toledo, he 
signs Amerrigo, with a double r and the suppression of the h. (See 
page 657.) That modification in the orthography of his Christian name 
is "the end of the ear which sticks out" {le hout de Voreille qui perce). 
Seeing the analogy of Amerigho and Amerrique, he did all he could to 
bring his name as near as possible to the aboriginal name, without 
identifying it entirely; for a complete identification might have been 
detected at once, for there were still alive quite a number of Colombo 
crews of one hundred and fifty seamen; and very cunningly he signed 
himself Amerrigo, with a most attractive and prominent flourish 
(paraph), using it until his death in 1512, as is seen in two or three 
other signatures of him after 1508, preserved in the Casa de Contracta- 
tion at SeviUa, and all written with the double r and the dropping of the h. 
The Spanish historian J. B. Munoz, is the first who has observed the 
double r in the signatures found by him in Spain ; that strange and 
unique spelling attracted his attention, without his being able to assign

any reason for it. Muiioz was convinced that some intentional falsifi- 
cation existetl in regard to the voyages of Vespucci ; and he was as well 
as the other historian, M. F. de Navarrete, a believer in some sort of 
fraud on the part of tlie Florentine. Alexander de Humboldt not know- 
ing what to do with the double r, thought it might be " a proof of eru- 
dition " on the part of Vespucci, quoting the opinion of Professor von 
der Hagen of Berlin that "when in Italian Vespucci uses the double 
r in signing Anierrigo, it is by assimilation of two consonants, it is 
Amerrigo for Amelrigo (name of a bishop of Como in 865)." The main 
difiQculty in accepting such an explanation is that Vespucci did not 
use it when he wrote in Italian and to Italians, as is proved by his let- 
ter of Mantova, but only to Spaniards and in Spanish. After the many 
researches of all sorts made in the archives and in published books and 
documents, it is certain that the spelling of Amerigo with two r's is 
subsequent to the christening of St. Die in 1507. It is the most dam- 
aging discovery made against Vespucci, which can not be satisfactorily 
explained in any other way than to bring his Christian name as near as 
possible to the Indian name of Amerrique. 

SCHOENER VERSUS VESPUCCI. 

By a strange occurrence, not rare however in the first discoveries of 
lauds and aborigines of the new continent, the name of the Indian tribe 
and of their country was not printed in any pamphlet or book or writ- 
ten on any map that we know of. It escaped the researches of all the 
Americanists; even of Alexander de Humboldt, and it seems that 
everything conspired to make good the triple errors of Jean Basin, 
accepted and consolidated by Vespucci as much as he safely could. 

It may be that Vespucci wrote on some manuscript map Tierra di 
Amerriques, and tliat it was read Tierra di Amerigo, as Schoener has 
accused him of doing in 1535. Johannes Schoener, born in 1477, at 
Carlstadt, Lower Franconia, in Bavaria, died at Nuremberg in 1547. 
He was an excellent geographer and well acquainted with all the dis- 
coveries made during his time, as is amply proved by Dr. Franz Wieser, 
in his important book: '' Magalhaes-Strasse und Austral-Continent auf 
den Globen des Johannes Schoener," Innspruck, 1881. Certainly Schoe- 
ner can not be considered as a detractor of Vespucci. He seems to 
have acted with great honesty of purpose, saying only the truth of what 
he heard about him; for in 1515, in his " Luculentissima," etc., he is 
very friendly to Vespucci, saying that he discovered the New World in 
1497 and that the name America was generally accepted and already 
in great use. But when he was convinced of the great injustice done 
to Cristoforo Colombo, the true discoverer, he did not hesitate to say 
that he knew that Vespucci had written his name upon some maps. 

There is no doubt that maps made by Vespucci existed at that 
time ; for we know of their existence through his contemporaries Pierre 
Martyr d'Anghiera and his nephew and heir, Juan Vespucci. Only, as 
I have said before, it may be that instead of writing Tierra di Amerigo 



THE NAME AMERICA. 669 

upou them, he wrote Tierra di Amerriques, and that Jean Basin and 
others made the mistake which led Schoener to make the accusation. 
I believe that there is no reasonable doubt that there was some sort of 
shrewd underhand practice by some one in the whole matter of the 
attribution of the discovery of the New World to Ves'pucci, and in the 
maintenance of the name Americ as his Christian name, when it is 
Amerigho. Without going so far as to regard Vesi)ucci as an im- 
postor, it is difficult not to admit that he was a great diplomatist, what 
we call now a shrewd politician, a tail fino in Italian, and that there 
are reasons enough to consider him as a sort of mystificator. 

COLOMBO AND VESPUCCI. 

Cristoforo Colombo has the honesty and simplicity of a seaman who 
has passed all his life before the mast; believing easily that others were 
" bombredebien," if they had the reputation of being honest merchants. 
Amerigho Vespucci has been during the greatest part of his life a 
" fiorentino merchante," as he called himself, educated for the trade at 
Florence and accustomed to all the little underhand ways of traders. 
He was considered at Sevilla as an " hombre de bien " in trade, and 
his failure of success as a merchant confirms that view to a certain 
extent. 

Unfortunate in his speculations, he took at the end of his life to sea- 
manship, as an astronomer, chart maker, captain, and pilot, and finally 
he was appointed piloto major. He never had command of a single 
expedition, and was after all a very secondary man in Spain or Portugal 
where there were such great navigators as Colombo, Vasco de Gama, 
Pinson, de la Cosa, Hojeda, Pedro de Ledesma, de Solis, Juan and Se- 
bastiano Caboto, Diego de Lepe, the Cortereal, Cabral, de Bastidos, 
Vergara, Coelho, etc. 

But it is evident that ambition to be known as a great discoverer 
and a navigator of renown took hold of Vespucci, soon after entering 
into his new life ; and he addressed his voyages to the King of Spain, 
the King of Portugal, a Medicis in Paris, the perpetual gonfalonier of 
Florence, and finally to the good Rene, King of Sicily and Due of 
Lorraine. The style of Vespucci is rather diffuse and pretentious, "it 
vise a Vefet,^ according to de Humboldt. He leans constantly towards 
exaggeration, and boasts of having received patent letters from the 
King of Portugal. The most exhaustive researches into the books, 
which are all preserved in the archives of the Torre do Tombo, contain- 
ing all the patent letters delivered by the kings of Portugal, have 
failed entirely to show any trace of these ; and even the name of Ves- 
pucci has never been found in a single document in Portugal. 

Everything pertaining to Vespucci, as a traveller and a navigator, must 
be received with some apprehension that it is either much exaggerated 
or even untrue. We must remember that Vespucci was a Florentine, 
a friend of a Medicis and of Soderiui 5 a trader until forty-eight years 



670 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS. 

old ; tbat he was living during a period when it was possible to be a 
cheat and at the same time regarded as a " hombre de bien.^^ It was a 
time which it is difidcult to understand now, because the society of the 
fifteenth century lived among troubles of all sorts, which influenced all 
the ideas and relations of men ; and the honesty of men during that 
period can not be compared with our actual ideas on the subject. With 
Cristoforo Colombo everything is clear and explained easily, while on 
the contrary with Amerigho Vespucci everything is obscure, or even 
clashes with well-known facts, and all the time his defenders or friends 
are obliged to have recourse to suppositions and to throw the blame 
upon others Avithout the slightest proof and against plain facts. It is 
going too far to say with de Humboldt that Vespucci is " the victim of 
a concourse of fortuitous circumstances," and of " the exaggerations of 
unskillful and dangerous friends," for it is evident that Vespucci him- 
self did all he could to create those circumstances, and during his life 
he never did anything to correct his " unskillful and dangerous friends " 
of St. Di6, Strasburg, and Metz. 

A name for a continent covering a whole hemisphere can not come as 
a spontaneous generation, and as Pasteur says, "spontaneous genera- 
tion " does not exist in nature nor in philology. There is always a source 
and a base, and until the re-discovery of a tribe of Indians called 
Amerriques, formerly powerful, and who have always lived in a coun- 
try rich in gold and close to the coast exi)lored first by Colombo and 
afterward by Vespucci, it was impossible to give a rational and satis- 
factory explanation of the christening of the New World. A writer has 
said with great pertinence, " The attribution of the name America to 
Vespucci has been respected especially because there was no other 
solution to oppose to it," 

After almost four centuries it is impossible to expect that every fact 
should be sustained by authentic documents and indisputable proofs. 
Many of the archives have been destroyed, and we are reduced often — 
too often — to suppositious and probabilities. That the publication of 
the " Cosmographiae Introductio" of St. Di^ was directed against the 
reputation of Cristoforo Colombo is an undeniable fact, and that some 
secret lay at the bottom of it is plain enough. Nothing is truly known 
as to how the French manuscript came into the hands of King Ken6, 
nor what part Vespucci took in the matter. We are reduced to in- 
ferences from the known facts of Vespucci sending his accounts of his 
voyages in all directions. His admirers and partisans are obliged to 
make more suppositions and have given less probable explanations than 
his adversaries, and the custom adopted of throwing upon others all the 
manifest and glaring errors in order to take olf all blame from 
Vespucci is only a '■^dessem coupable d^agrandir artijicieusement le merite 
de Vespucci,''^* at the expense of the veracity and knowledge of some 
of his contemporaries. 

*Exameu critique, vol. v, p. 187 



THE NAME AMERICA. 671 

The name was not "accidentally created in the Vosges,"* as de 
Humboldt thought; but the application to Vespucci of the indigenous 
name Amerriqiie was wrongly made there. The name is not a creation 
of the Vosgian Gymnasium, but only an erroneous assimilation to the 
Christian name of a man having some similarity with it, against all the 
rules of priority of discovery and of naming a great country in using 
the (christian name of a. Piloto instead of his family name. After 
the mistake had been made Vespucci took care to make it good by 
altering the autography of his Christian name, changing his signature 
of 1402, Amerigho, into Amerrigo after 1507 and until his death. 

All the discussions among Americanists come entirely from their 
ignorance of the existence of a tribe of Indians who call themselves 
Amerriqiies, and who inhabit the Sierra Amerrique and the country rich 
in gold, between Lake Nicaragua and the Mosquito coast. They were 
confronted by such difficulties that it is a true chaos of dates, uamf^s, 
pretentions of all sorts, patriotic rivalries, and futile explanations un- 
worthy of the characters and profound science of some of their number. 
If Varnhagen and d'Avezac, and more especially de Humboldt, had 
known the existence of the Amerriques, the Sierra Amerrique, and 
the gold region of the vicinities of Cariai and Carambaru, of the 
lettera rarissima of Colombo, they would have given a very different 
explanation, and instead of giving such weak and inadequate reasons 
as they did they would have thrown a great deal more light upon the 
matter than I have been able to do, for I have no pretention of being 
an Americanist, and even less a scholar, being only a practical travel- 
ling geologist. 

RESUM]^. 

We have the following authentic fa^ts : 

(1) On the 30th of December, 1492, Vespucci wrote a letter from 
Sevilla, preserved at Mantova, in the Archives Gonzaga, signed Ameri- 
gho Vespucci, merchante fiorentino in Sybilia. 

(2) In the last voyage of Christoforo Colombo he staid from the 25th 
of September to the 5th of October, 1502, with his 150 companions, at 
Cariai (Rio Rama) and Carambaru (Rio Blewfields) among Indians wear- 
ing gold mirrors round their necks. The localities of the mouth of the 
Rios Rama and Blewfields are so near the country occupied now by the 
the Amerrique Indians and the Sierra Amerrique, and the proved existence 
there of an area of gold mines, altogether make it certain that Colombo 
and his 150 seamen heard the name Amerrique and used it at their re- 
turn to designate some of the Indian tribes and a country rich in gold. 

(3) First letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo Pier Francisco di Medicis, pub- 
lished at Paris, in 1504 or 1505, with the name Albericm Vesputius. 

(4) Second letter of Vespucci to Pietro Soderini, published at Pescia, 
near Florence, in 1506. with the name Amerigo Vespucci. 

*Examen critique vol. v, p. 175. 



672 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS. 

(5) Jean Basin, of St. Die, uses the names of Amerige and Ainericus 
in translating from the French into Latin the second letter of Vespucci, 
entitled, Quatuor navigationea ; and the Vosgian Gymnasium proposes 
in 1507 to name the New World America, in honor of its discoverer 
Amerige Vespucci. 

(6) On the 9th of December, 1508, Vespucci wrote a letter to the Arch- 
bishop of Toledo, lately published in fac-simile by the Spanish Govern- 
ment, signed Amerrigo Vespucci, Piloto mor (major). 

(7) From 1508 until 1512, the date of his death, two or three signatures 
of Vespucci have been found in Spain, all written with the double r and 
without the letter h, Amerrigo instead of Amerigho of 1492, showing a 
willful alteration in the spelling of his Christian name, after the chris- 
tening of the New World in his honor, at St. Die, in 1507. 

(8) In 1515, Shoener says that the name Aiuericaia generally used to 
designate the New World. 

(9) The first map, with an authentic date, on which the name America 
has been found, is the map of Apianus, in the Polyhistor of Soliuus in 
1520. 

(10) In 1533, twenty-one years after the death of Vespucci, Schoener, 
an astronomer and geographer of good standing and just reputation, ac- 
cuses Vespucci of havin g written his name on charts ; but he did not 
say how the name was spelled. The Americanist Henry Harrisse 
thinks that Shoener "had fastened on the memory of Vespucius the 
odious charge of having artfully inserted the words Terra di Amerigo 
in charts which he has otherwise altered." * Vespucci may have inserted 
Terra di Amerriques^ an exact name, very closely allied to the new spell- 
ing of his Christian name Amerrigo, and which has led Schoener to 
make the accusation. The exact expressions used by Schoener are : 
" Americus Vesputius maritima loca Indise superioresex Hispaniisnav- 
igio ad occidentem perlustrans, cam partem quae superioris Indite est, 
crediditesse Insulam quam a suo nomine vocariinstituit" (In: Joanis 
Schoeneri Carolostadii opusculum geographicum ex Diversorum libris, etc., 
etc., Norica, Novembris xxxiii). 

No maps made by Vespucci have been found, although we know that 
he made some. 

One thing is certain, it is that Vespucci did not discover the New 
World, and another fact is also certain, that Amerriqueis an indigenous 
name. From the central part of the coutinent, just about the middle, 
the name Amerrique or Amerique in French or America in Latin 
extended first southward and then northward, until finally we have the 
Three Americas. 

Geographically the name Amerrique has never varied, the Latin name 
America and the French AmtVi(/?*e have always been spelled without any 
changes among the letters on all tiie maps and charts; while, on the 
contrary, the Christian name of Vespucci had varied from Amerigho to 

"Bibliotheoa AmericaaaVetustiasima, p. 304. 



THE NAME AMERICA. 673 

Amerrigo, according to bis own signature, and has taken all the forms 
and combinations imaginable between Albericus and Morigo. 

To conclude, 1 shall quote a sentence ti'ken from the life of Louis Pas- 
teur: "All new discoveries bring into the ideas generally used until then, 
a change which is accepted by some with joy, while others resist, be- 
cause it deranges all their old habits." (j1/. Pasteur^ Histoire (Vun savant, 
etc., p. 34:1, Paris, 1883) ; which applies exactly to this case. Almost all 
Americans and all the Spaniards have accepted with joy the idea that 
the New World was not named for Vespucci, who has no claim whatever 
to such an honor, but that the beautiful name of Amerrique belongs to a 
tribe of Indians and to a range or sierra of the central part of the conti- 
nent, discovered and first explored by Cristoforo Colombo. A few Amer- 
icanists, disturbed in their old habit of proclaiming in books, in pam- 
phlets, or in speeches, that the new continent has been called after Amer- 
igho Vespucci, do not like it, for it is disagreeable to them to see all they 
have published or said replaced by something more rational and natural, 
of which they.had not the smallest idea, or even thought of for one instant, 
and their resistance is natural enough. I expected it from the time I 
wrote my first paper on the Origin of the Name America, published in 
March, 1875, in the Atlantic Monthly ; and nothing that has been said 
b3' a few critics and reviewers in the United States, in Italy, and in Ger- 
many has surprised me. But time will show who is right and 1 trust 
fully to the good sense of the people. 

The name of the New World was taken from the mountain range and 
Indian tribe at the center of the continent, and brought into general use 
by the people who had been there, and the people will now see who has 
the correct view as to the origin of the name.

PROGRESS OF ORIENTAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA 
DURING 1888. 



BY CYRUS ADLER, PH. D. 



The study of oriental science has had a remarkable development in 
America during the past decade, and has at the same time taken on an 
almost entirely new aspect. Under the lead of Professor Whitney, and 
of the men whom he inspired, the Indian branch of oriental studies has 
in the past given — and still continues to give — many valuable contribu- 
tions to science, and holds an almost unique position towards the Old 
World in the circle of philological studj^ 

Investigation in the field of Semitic languages and archreology, on 
the other hand, was carried on mostly by the way, and in spite of a few 
valuable contributions the publications in that line were, as a rule, not 
important. The year 1883 marks a new era for these studies in America 
with the establishment of regular courses in Semitic languages (includ- 
ing Assyrian inscriptions) at two of our great universities, Harvard and 
Johns Hopkins. Most of the other important seats of learning have 
followed this departure, so that in 1886 it was already possible for the 
eminent French archaeologist, M. Joachim Menant, to say that the most 
serious efforts in this line are now concentrated in America.* 

The year 1888 was one of great moment to oriental science in this 
country. Possibly no stronger evidence of the interest had for these 
studies could be afforded than the determination of the publishers of 
the series of textbooks known as Porta Linguarum Oricntalium to put 
an English translation on the American market; a confirmatory inci- 
dent is the selection of an American member of the board of editors of 
the Zeitsehrift filr Orienfalische Bibliographie, Prof. R. J. H. Gottheil, of 
Columbia College. 

A number of gentlemen of Philadelphia equipped and sent out a 
party to explore and conduct excavations in Mesopotamia, under the 
auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. Considerable difficulty 
was experienced in procuring from the Turkish authorities the requisite

permission to dig, and at the close of the year the party proceeded 
southward to Niffer. It is likely that work will be continued during the 
coining j^ear.* 

The American Oriental Society, at its meeting in Philadelphia, took 
a step which may lead to important results. A resolution was adopted 
and a committee appointed to obtain information and make a report in 
May, 1889, on the feasibility and utility of the preparation of a catalogue 
of oriental manuscripts in America. Such*a catalogue, if it could be 
made complete, would be of the greatest service to American oriental 
scholars, whose chief drawback lies in the fact that their materials for 
work are scattered over the entire country. 

The University of Pennsylvania has acquired a collection of cuneiform 
originals (briefly described by Dr. Kobert F. Harper in Hebraica, Vol. 
V, pp. 74:-76), and also a collection of casts of Assyrian objects in the 
British Museum. 

The National Museum is steadily pursuing its policy of collecting 
copies of Assyrian and Babylonian objects preserved in this country. 
An exhibit of specimens in the field of Biblical Archaeology was 
set up in the Government exhibit at the (Jeutennial Exposition of 
the Ohio Valley held at Cincinnati. An interesting collection of casts 
of Assyrian and Egyptian objects has been received from the Berlin 
Museum and a working oriental library is being collected in (he Smith- 
sonian Institution for the use of the oriental section, and of oriental 
scholars visiting Washington. 

Possibly the first German journal in the field of oriental philology, 
to be published with the aid of an American learned body is the Beitrdge 
ziir Assyriologie und Vergleicheudcn Semitischen Sprachwissenscliaft, which 
will appear mit UnterstUtzungder Johns Hopkins JJniversitat zn Baltimore, 
edited by Prof. Friedrich Delitzsch, of Leipzig, and Prof. Paul Haupt, of 
Baltimore. 

American scholars have contributed to most of the important journals 
in the field of oriental science published abroad, and a number of for- 
eign scholars, among whom may be mentioned Canon Cheyne, of Ox- 
ford, Prof. G. Maspero, Mr. W. M. Flinders Petrie, Mr. Theo. G. Pinches 
of the British Museum, Prof. George Rawlinson, Prof. A. H. Sayce of 
Queens College, Oxford, Dr. Hugo Wiuckler, of Berlin, and the late 
Prof. William Wright, of Cambridge, have sent contributions to Ameri- 
can journals. 

The range of topics covered by American orientalists comprises : As- 
syro-Babylonian language, art, history, and religion; Armenia; Budd- 
hism and Sanskrit; China; Cyprus; Egypt; Hittites; Japan; Jews 
and Judaism (so far as they bear on the history of the orient); modern 
oriental languages; Mohammedanism and Arabic ; Old Testament and 
Hebrew ; Pedagogics ; Persia ; Samaritan ; Siam ; Semitic Philology ; 
Syriac.

ORIENTAL SCIEXCE IX AMERICA. G77 

Thf present report is the first attempt made in this country to i)re- 
sent in brief the work of oriental scholars during one year. It is nec- 
essarily imperfect partly because of its novelty and for lack of assist- 
ance on the part of scholars throughout the country. Many of the 
papers mentioned in the bibliography could not be described because 
they were not accessible. 

• ASSYRIOLOGY. 

Cyrus Adler showed that two classes of Assyrian verbs weak in the 
third stem consonant, and usually confounded, were capable of sharp 
difterentiation; criticised the neglect of Assyrian in the article on 
Semitic languages in the Cyclopiiedia Britanuica, and suggested that 
a certain class of Syriac verbs (the saphel) might not be organic forms; 
described the views of the Babylonians concerning life after death; 
some of the oriental objects in the I^ational Museum, among them an 
Ethiopic version of the Gospels in the Grant collection ; the German 
expedition to southern Babylonia; the Tell-Amarna tablets in the Brit- 
ish Museum; and announced to the American Oriental Society, on behalf 
of the Semitic Seminary of the Johns Hopkins University, the i)urpose 
to publish a complete edition of the life and writings of Edward Hiucks, 
subjoining a tentative bibliography of Hincks's works. 

Edgar P. Allen offered some new translations of the inscription of 
Tiglath-pileser I. In columns i 31-2, i 25, and viii 34 he reads ::;S)' 
sangiltl', and in ir G6 gammarea irhuti, "swift veterans;" he also made 
a conjecture which, if established, would present the unique instance of 
;ni Assyrian king mentioning an unsuccessful campaign. 

Francis Brown explained why the religious poetry of the Semitic 
cuneiform monuments is Babylonian rather than Assyrian; translated 
a number of Babylonian penitential psalms, and drew comparisons 
with the corresponding portions of the Old Testament. He pointed 
out the identification of the names of the kings mentioned in Genesis, 
chapter xiv, discussed the question of the capture of Samaria, disputing 
Delitzsch's opinion that it was captured by Shalmaneser, and attempted 
to harmonize the statements of the Bible (Is., xxxvii, 38), Alexander 
Polyhistor, and the Babylonian chronicle with reference to the murderer 
of Sennacherib. He gave notes on the Tell-Amarna tablets, discovered 
in 1887 in middle Egypt. One of the most surprising facts brought to 
light by these new tablets is the extent to which the cuneiform charac- 
ter and the Babylono-Assyrian language were employed in Western 
Asia. 

Robert F. Harper published text and translation of the cylinder of 
Esarhaddon, and described his visit as a member of the Ijniversity of 
Pennsylvania exploring party to Zinjirli, where a German expedition 
under Dr. Human has beeh'excavating with most valuable results. 

Paul Haupt described modern researches in Assyria and Babylonia ; 
the development of the Assyrian writing; published the text of the

twelfth tablet of the Nimrod Epic; re-collated the whole of the poem; 
gave a new translation of the first column of the Deluge tablet on the 
basis of recently found fragments ; discussed the dimensions of the 
Babylonian ark (=120 half cubits, 110 feet, for both the depth and 
width, and 600 half cubits, 540 feet, for the length) ; and developed a 
theory of the Assyrian prefix na. 

Morris Jastrow discussed the Assyrian word Midurii, which he con- 
nected with the ring of the sun-god and the biblical and later Hebrew 
Jcaddur; reviewed Parti of Delitzsch's Assyrian dictionary, offered trans- 
lation of some passages in the monolith inscription of Shalmaneser II, 
and described ancient Babylonian cemeteries. 

M. L. Kellner gave a new translation of the standard inscription of 
Asuruazirpal, and compared and discussed the Babylonian and Old 
Testament accounts of the Deluge. 

David G. Lyon showed the development of the Assyro-Babylonian 
religious conceptions by a collection of the prayers ajjpended to the 
royal inscriptions. He proved from a statistical study of the Pantheon 
of Asurbanipal (668-62G b. c.) that this king mentions most frequently 
Assur, the national god, and Istar, the goddess of war, and that he 
exhibited a marked tendency to invoke a group of twelve deities, not 
the same, however, which preside over the twelve months. He also 
called attention to some parallels between the Assyrian inscriptions 
and the Old Testament. 

S. H. McCollester described his trip from Bagdad to Babylon and 
Mosul, the site of ancient Nineveh, with an account of the excavations, 
explorations, and discoveries made there. 

J. A. Paine gave a discussion of the eclipse in the seventh year of 
Cambyses, based on T. G. Pinches's paper, "An astronomical or astro- 
logical tablet from Babylon" {Babylonian and Oriental Record^ August, 
1888). This tablet is either the original or a copy of the text from 
which Ptolemy (in the Almagest) derived his information of the fifth 
eclipse which he enumerates (July 16, 523 b. c). In this text we 
meet for the first time the Assyrian word irihu Hebrew idreah "moon." 

Theophilus G. Pinches, of the British Museum, contributed to the 
New Yorh Independent an article entitled, "An old Babylonian letter," 
being a translation and commentary on a tablet in the British Museum, 
S+375. 

Zenaide A. Eagozin wrote a brief history of Media, Babylonia, and 
Persia, from the fall of Nineveh to the Persian war. Especial attention 
is given to the religion of the Parsees. 

A. H. Sayce described in the New York Independent the literary 
correspondence between Asia and Egypt in the century before the 
Exodus, being an account of some of the Tell-Amarna tablets. 

S. Alden Smith has carried on his studies in Assyrian letters, publish- 
ing a number of new texts; described Assyrian report tablets and the 
progress of Assyrian study, and criticized Delitzsch's Assyrian die- 
tiouary. 



orip:ntal science in America. G79 

William Hayes Ward coucliules that there is no clear evidence, on 
Assyrian and Babylonian seals, of human sacrifice. He considers the 
so called gate god a conventionalized form of the sun-god coming out 
of the gates of tlie east. 

Hugo Wiuckler translated iu Rebraica a cuneiform text describing 
the building of Nebuchadnezzar's aitiflcial reservoir. One inscription 
records that the royal canal was built because the river Euphrates had 
departed from the city of Sippar. 

D. A. Walker gave a historical sketch of the reign of the Assyrian 
king Asurbauipal. 

BUDDHISM AND SANSKRIT. 

A. H. Edgreen wrote a criticism of Van den Gheyn. His conclusion 
is that of the thirteen roots which have been referred to the eighth 
class of verbs in Sanskrit five are fictitious, and the remainder must be 
referred to the fifth class. 

T. B. Forbush described the Hindu doctrine of death and immortality. 
The early Hindus had no dread of death. The future life was a joyous 
one, when all good people reap the reward of virtue. The terrible 
conception of hell is no part of the primitive Vedic faith. The funda- 
mental i^ostulate of Hindu ontology is that the soul is eternal. It is not 
born, it can not die, and is itself changeless. At different times it wears 
different garments; sometimes it assumes the form of a man, sometimes 
the disguise of an animal, and sometimes it is clad in the robes of a 
spirit of light. 

James T. Hatfield edited a Vedic text on omens and portents from 
two MSS. in the British Museum. 

E. W. Hopkins continued his inquiry into the conditions of civiliza- 
tion in the Hindu middle age from the point of view of the ruliug power 
or warrior caste, and discussed the quantitative variations in the Cal- 
cutta and Bombay texts of the Mahabharata. 

A. V, W. Jackson called attention to a new reference in the Avesta 
to "the life-book" hereafter. 

S. H. Kellogg discussed the origin of certain Rajput forms of the 
substantive verb in Hindi. 

David Ker described Burmah's mighty river and the capital cities of 
the past, the old caverns, site and great temple of Moulmein, Lower 
Burmah ; a trip b^^ rail up the Himalaya; temples and Buddhist 
shrines that have been used as fortresses in times of war; the street 
scenes and play-houses of Rangoon, the Liverpool of Burmah, and the 
famous Shway Dagohn of Rangoon, the golden pagoda of Burmah; 
also a trip among the Circassian mountains. 

Edward A. Lawrence gave an account of his visit among the mis- 
sionary stations iu South India. Churches and Christian worship are 
described. The population of South India is largely aboriginal, of 
Dravidian stock. The social institutions are primitive and interesting 
to the student of earlv customs. 



G80 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS. 

Henry C. Lea iu a note on Emerson and the Katlia Upanishad referred 
to a notice of Mr. W. S. Kennedy calling attention to a passage in the 
" Katha Ui)auishad " which furnished INIr, Emerson the initial thought 
in his mysterious stanzas on " Brahma." 

H. W. Magoun treated of the Asuri Ealpa, a witchcraft practice of 
the Atharva-Veda. A.mri is the black mustard of India, and it was 
used in this rite to make an image of some person whom it was desired 
to overcome or destroy by magical practices. Mr. Magoun prints 
text, critical notes, extracts from the Scholiast, translation and a com- 
mentary. 

Raj Ooomar Roy corrected various misapprehensions concerning child- 
marriage in India. The boys and girls, though married in infancy, are 
never allowed to live together until the girl reaches puberty. This 
being the case, and marriage ordained by God, it fullills the twofold 
object of the procreation of children, and a remedy against sin ; it 
even fulfills a third object, viz, mutual society. There is great~ igno- 
rance among Euroi)eans in regard to the position of Hindu women, 
which is by no means that of slavery. 

W. W. Rockhill described the Lamaist ceremony of " making of mani 
pills." During the entire process no one is permitted to approach who 
has used meat, spirits, garlic, tobacco, or other impure objects. The 
process is sometimes one hundred days in length (consisting of a very 
careful preparation of the pills, which are made of flour and scented 
water), followed by a period of meditation and prayer. He discussed 
the use of skulls in Lamaist ceremonies, which is at present twofold : 
(1) as an offering to Tsepamed, who is represented as holding iu his 
hands a skull filled with ambrosia; (2) as a receptacle for the wine or 
other liquid offered to the gods. 

Justiu A. Smith gave a summary of the ancient literature of the 
East. He treats of romance and drama, the Pankatantra, the Sakoou- 
tala ot Kalidasa, and Hindu fiction in general ; of Hindu epic and my- 
thology, the Mahubharata and the Ramayana; of the Iranian script- 
ures, the Zend-Avesta of Zarathustra, adding notes on Persian and 
Iranian history; of the Shah-Nameh and the Bundehesh; of Buddhism 
and the teachings of Buddha; and of Chinese literature, especially the 
works of Confucius and Mencius. 

W. D. Whitney wrote a review of the second volume of Eggeling's 
translation of the Catapatha Brahmana, and brought out a new edition 
of his Sanskrit grammar. 

CHINA. 

W. S. Ament discussed tne ancient coinages of China. Starting with 
the assertion that the Chinese were the inventors of coined money, he 
investigated, specifically, (1) the composition of Chinese coins; (2) the 
mode of their casting; (3) their inscriptions; (4) their form. 

Adele M. Fielde described some Chinese mortuary customs. The 
obsequies of a parent are reckoned the most troublesome affair iu hu-

man experionco, anions- the (3lHneso, and, therefore, when they wish to 
declare the extreme vexatiousness of any piece of work, they say, " It 
is more trouble than a funeral." Infants are bnried summarily, with- 
out Collins, and the young- are interred with few rites; but the funerals 
of the aged, of both sexes, are elaborate in proportion to the number 
of the descendants and to their wealth. 

Elizabeth P. Gould describes the result of Yung Wing's efibrts to 
raise the standard of education in his native country during the last 
thirty years. It was tiirough his influence that students were sent to 
America to be educated. One of these was Yan Phou Lee, whose bi- 
ography is given on the basis of his book, " When I was a boy in 
China." 

W. A. P. Martin gave an account of diplomacy in ancient China. 
The doctrine of extraterritoriality was unknown; no agent was a min- 
ister plenipotentiary, and the sovereign always held himself free to dis- 
avow the acts of his representative : there were no resident ministers, 
only enroycs extraordinaires. He made a translation of the devotional 
portion of a i)ictorial sheet engraved and published by the P>uddhist 
high priest in charge of the Pas-en Temple ; found traces of the philo- 
sophic ideas of Descartes in the Chinese thinkers of the eleventh cent- 
ury, and the same views among them concerning filial duty that are 
advanced by Plato. 

S. A. Stern described domestic customs in Japan and China, the 
business habits of the people, their dress and amusements. 

H. W. Warren described a journey on the Yang-tze-kiaug, with some 
geographical and social notes. Canton, he says, is a thoroughly English 
place. The architecture is imposing and solid. It is a little Loudon 
planted in the distant East. 

CYPRUS. 

W. H. Goodyear described the Cypriote sculptures in the Metropoli- 
tan Museum ; and in a note to the Gritic, April 18, corrects some mis- 
apprehensions in the Critic's notice of his paper published in the Amer- 
ican Journal of Archaeology on the Egyptian origin of the Ionic capital 
and the anthemiou. 

EaYPT. 

The various articles on the Tell-Amarna tablets, discussed under 
Assyriology, all bear more or less on Egyptian history. 

Lysander Dickerman discussed Groflf's discovery of the names of Ja- 
cob and Joseph on the Egyptian monuments, holding that Groflfs in- 
ference was not warranted. 

William N. Grolf, who continues his residence abroad, speaks of 
q. I. u. i. on an Egypto-Aramean papyrus, which he identifies with the 
Egyptian KelM, a sort of wine; published in hieroglyphic the romance 
of the two brothers, with a translation and commentary ; discussed the

pronouns in Egyptian, and discov^ered the names of Jacob- El and Jo- 
sej)h-El, in lists of defeated uatious, transported to Eg3'i)t in the time 
of Tnthmosis HI, about 1700 B. c. 

Lewis G. Janes reviewed p]dward Naville's edition and translation 
of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. A careful study of this book, with 
an unbiased scrutiny of the monuments and inscriptions, reveals coin- 
cidences of notable change and development in the Eyptian doctrine of 
the future life. Mr. Janes follows the development from the archaic 
period down to the days of St. Paul. 

G. Lansing, in two articles on Egypticity and Authenticity of the 
Pentateuch, discussed the Biblical narratives of the lives of Joseph and 
Moses (Genesis xxxix, et seq.) with reference to the local hints and lin- 
guistic usages; in other words, the Egyptian cast and character of the 
narraratives. He concludes that the narratives must have been written 
at or near the time the events narrated occurred. 

G. Maspero studied the Egyptian words which seem to apply to the 
human soul and the places it inhabited after death. He pointed out 
that the views of the Egyptians with reference to death and a future 
state underwent many changes. 

Ch. E. Moldenke edited the first part of a new edition of the so-called 
tale of two brothers, or the D'Orbiney papyrus. 

Howard Osgood made an English translation of M. Philippe Virey's 
French translation of the Papyrus Prisse, "The Oldest Book in the 
World ;" described society, ethics, and religion in Egypt before 2000 
B. c. 

Aug. de Plougeon recalled the fact that the Egyptian Sphynx is 
a riddle still unsolved and its age unknown. He directed attention 
to certain striking analogies existing between the Egyptian Sphynx 
and the leopard with human head that crowns the mausoleum of Prince 
Coh at Ghichen-Itza (Yucatan). 

C. A. Siegfried described a tour from Tripoli to Alexandria. Tripoli 
is a typical Arabian town with all the evils of Moslem misrule, wretch- 
edness, and neglect. From Tripoli to Egypt is an agreeable change. 
The social and mercantile condition of Alexandria is described. He 
gives an account of his experience of a journey to the Dalmatian coast 
and Montenegro, describing the political, social, and archaeological 
features of the country. 

Cope Whitehouse discussed the map of Joseph the Fayumi and the 
Kaian Basin, in the light of the survey made during 1887-88. 

E. L. Wilson described " the great Pyramid " of Cheops, narrates the 
incidents of an ascent and descent; pictures the views from its summit 
and hills, discusses its history and the curious speculations to which it 
has given origin ; he wrote an illustrated paper on the temples of Egypt. 
]S"o perfectly preserved Egyptian temple is in existence, but by study- 
ing the various parts in the existing examples an adequate idea can 
be obtained of what one of these structures must have been in its com- 
pleteness. 



ORIENTAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA. 683 

HITTITES. 

William Hayes Ward restored and described some imperfectly pub- 
lished Hittite monuments from Carcemish (Jerablus), wbich appeared 
in the London Graphic December 11, 1880. These monuments had been 
rephotographed by the Wolfe expedition to Babylonia. 

JAPAN. 

S. Beale described Japanese pictures at the British Museum. Japan 
possesses works of art which from its own jjarticular point of view equal 
any school of European painting ; this art is the outcome of that of 
China. It dates back to the fifth century A. d. All pictures are essen- 
tially decorative; light and shade are unknown quantities, and linear 
perspective completely ignored. He also gave an account of Japanese 
ivory carvings ; showed the potent influence of tobacco in the decora- 
tive art of that country. Every domestic occurrence is represented in 
ivory, and man^'^ of their classic romances are illustrated in the bronze, 
porcelain, and lacquer work. 

William Elliot Griffis described Japanese artists and artisans ; with 
illustrations from drawings by a Japanese artist. Among things un- 
expected in Japan, none strikes the visitor or resident more than the 
enviroment of art and its maker; the critic and historian, who is yet to 
write the story of art in Japan, will discriminate between what is bor- 
rowed and what is original. The folding ftm, the arts of lacquering, 
sword-making, cloissonne on porcelain, and some of the methods of dec- 
orating are of native origin. Other works of art are mostly imported. 

E. H. House gives a history of the tariii in Japan. The first effective 
commercial treaty with Japan was negotiated in 1858 by Townsend 
and Harris, upon terms which in general were not disadvantageous to 
the unsophisticated people with whom they were dealing. If they had 
taken the precaution to insure the absolute termination of the treaty 
at a proper date, all would have resulted as they desired, but under the 
circumstances it has proved disastrous to Japan and proportionately 
favorable to the western powers. He also discussed foreign jurisdiction 
in Japan. The authors of the early treaties never intended to sui)er- 
sede the laws of Japan by those of their own nations. The inflation of 
arrogant pretense, the multitude of entanglingand bewildering compli- 
cations, the aggregation of gross abuses, and the offensive domination 
over the national rule which have been exercised in later years have 
no other basis than the narrow foundations of mutual assistance, stipu- 
lated in the treaties of Harris and Townsend. The " diplomatic co-oper- 
ative policy "of European nations has put Japan in ties which hold her 
in political and moral enslavement. 

S. E. Ives describes a Japanese magic mirror. It is a circular, metal- 
lic hand-mirror, having figures in relief upon its back ; the reflecting 
surface is highly polished, and reflects the face as well ai)parently as do 
mirrors of silvered glass, but when it is used to reflect the direct rays 



(J 84 MISCELLANEOUS PAPEliS. 

of a powerful light upon a screen tbe reflection shows the figures tljat 
are at the back of the mirror. This peculiarity is explained by the fact 
that there are irregularities in the convexity of the mirror whicli cause 
an irregular reflection of the sun's rays. 

H. H. S. Thompson wrote on the women of Japan. They pride them- 
selves on the fact that nine of the sovereigns of Japan have been wo- 
men; that the chief deity in their mythology is a woman, and that the 
keeper of the "divine regalia" is a virgin priestess. They say the 
women of the early centuries had great mental and physical vigor, and 
filled offices of public trust with dignity and honor. There are many 
heroines whose names are renowned in Japanese classics, while instances 
of woman's valor, fortitude under suffering, and greatness in the hour 
of persecution abound. The Japanese woman has a place all her own 
in the world of letters. The evils in the position of women in Japan 
are traceable to Buddhism. 

JEWS AND JUDAISM. 

S. Adler discussed the various forms of benedictions in use in ancient 
times among the Jews. They fall into three classes : (1) After a physi- 
cal enjoyment; (2) on special occasion or at particular localities; (3) 
before fulfillment of a religious duty. 

B. Felsenthal showed that the popular Sabbath hymn Lelia dodi 
was not composed by Judah ha-Levi, as Heine supposed, but was 
written by Solomon Alkabitz ha-Levy, who lived in the sixteenth cen- 
tury and died in the city of Safed, in Northern Palestine. He also 
showed that the pronunciation of Jehovah for the name of God was first 
employed in Germany in the sixteenth century. 

A. K. Glover described the Jews of India. They are all olfshoots 
of Judah and not of the ten tribes. He also gave an account of the 
Jews of the Chinese Empire. 

li. J. H. Gottheil continues his translation of Karpeles's History of 
Jewish Literature. 

M. Jastrow,jr., treated of several Jewish grammarians of the middle 
ages. Hayyijg lived about the middle of the tenth century in Cordova, 
though born in Fez. He wrote two grammatical works on Hebrew 
verbs. In his studies he started from Arabic principles. From his 
treatises his pupil, Ibn Ganah, worked out his elaborate grammatical 
system. Donasli ben Labrat's only distinction is that he is the oppo- 
nent of Saadia Gaon and of Menahem b. Sarug. He is the author of 
two shari> polemical essays, the one containing a pointed criticism of 
Saadia's Arabic translation of the Bible, the other an attempt to dis- 
countenance Meuahem's standing as a grammarian. 

Alexander Kohut discussed the etymology of a number of talmudical 
words. 

H. C. Trumbull, in his history- of the origin and development of the 
Sunday school, devotes the first chapter to a history of the ancient 
Jewish schools. 



ORIENTAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA. 685 

The doctrines of the resurrectiou aud of a world of the dead are 
found ainoug the oldest heathen religions ot Chaldea and Egypt. How- 
ard Osgood maintains against negative critics that the same doctrines 
are taught in the Pentateuch, especially in the narrative of Cain and 
Abel. 

B. Pick discussed the Old Testament, passages applied Messianically 
by the ancient synagogue, in Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, 
and the twelve minor prophets. His work consists in the collection of 
quotations from the Midrashim with reference to the promised Messiah. 
He maintains {Christ and the Essenes) against Giusburg aud Fraukel 
that whatever points of resemblance critical ingenuity may emphasize, 
the teaching of Christianity was in a direction opposed to that of 
Essenism, aud that the latter could have had no intentional connection 
with the origin of Christianity. In describing the Therapeutae, of 
Egypt, a peculiar sect of Jewish ascetics, he points out agreements and 
disagreements between this sect and the Essenes. The characteristics 
of the two are so different that they can not be identical. Against Graitz 
he maintains the genuineness of Philo's Tracta, aud contends that the 
Therapeutic were Jews. 

Aaron Wise discussed the origin of Jewish angelology and demon- 
ology. He holds that it could not have arisen at the time of the Baby- 
lonian captivity, but antedates it. 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

I. IsT. Fradenburg has undertaken to show the connection of certain 
living religions of the Orient with the Jewish faith, and the connection 
of certain others with Christianity. He treats of (1) the great re- 
former of Asia, Buddha; (2) the old philosopher, Las-the, the contem- 
porary of Confucius; (3) Confucius, his life, teachings, aud his religious 
system ; (4) Brahmauism and Hinduism, its caste, doctrines, precepts, 
and speculations. 

I. H. Hall gave a note on a Khodian jar in the Boston Museum of 
Fine Arts ; on one handle is the eponym and name of Doric month, and 
on the other the name of the manufacturer, owner, or exporter. 

L. describes the Musee Guimet in Paris, which contains a collection 
intended to teach the history of the characteristics of oriental religious. 
The Christian and the Hebrew forms of worship are excluded ; there is 
no other collection of the kind nearly so large, or so well adapted for 
the study of the development of oriental aud ancient civilization. 

Allan Marquand described au archaic patera from Kourion, belong- 
ing to the Cesnola collection ; the central medallion is missing; the cen- 
ter zone represents a banquet scene ; the scene figured upon the patera 
seems to be the autumnal Adonis festival, in which honor was paid to 
both Adonis and Aphrodite. 

A. P. Peabody compared classic and Semitic ethics. Semitic moral- 
ity has a ground or staudi^rU of right, aud therefore ii reJ^soo for coq-

duct, of whicb we find no trace in the ethical philosophers of Greece 
and Rome. Acts are judged by their intrinsic and inherent nature, not 
by their bearing on some ultimate end ; a fatal deficiency in the morals 
of the classic ages was the relation of the sexes and the lack of purity 
and permanence of domestic institutions. 

S. D. Peet compared animal worship and sun worship in the East 
and in the West. The worship of the sun was prevalent in different 
parts of the world at a very ancient date. It was preceded by animal 
worship; but it is more powerful and more extensive than animal 
worship and grew out of it. The customs, habits, and language of 
the races of northern Asia are compared, especially the Ostyaks, with 
those of the aborigines of America. He discussed American religions 
and the Bible, and thinks that there are many things which go to show 
that there must have been a historic connection between the original 
religions of America and the teachings of the Bible. 

S. B. Platner, reviewed Myth, Ritual, and BeUgion of Andrew Lang. 
A method of explaining the irrational in mythology has been here 
worked out far more comprehensively and satisfactorily than by any 
other writer. 

MODERN ORIENTAL LANaUAGES. 

Cyrus Adler showed the importance of the study of modern oriental 
languages for a knowledge of the ancient tongues and for the improve- 
ment of our consular service and increase of trade with the East. 

MOHAMMEDANISM AND ARABIC. 

The question, Why am I a Moslem ? is answered by Ibn Ablis. There 
is a universally wrong conception of Mohammedanism among Western 
nations, but the more the religion of the Moslem is investigated the more 
does it claim the respectful homage of those who study its teachings. 
The Islam does not persecute any more than did or does Christianity. 
Notwithstanding his extensive travels in the East and West, the writer 
still clings to the five great duties of the true Moslem, and the six 
great dogmas of faith ; in them he finds all that is needed to discipline 
the human soul to that condition which is expressed in the word 
"Moslem" — " one who is resigned." " I am a Moslem because I recog- 
nize in Islam one of the many avenues through which the Creator of 
the universe leads his people to the temple of truth." 

G. Benton discussed Mohammedanism in Africa, with reference to 
Canon Isaac Taylor's statements, implying that Mohammedanism in 
Africa is an almost unmingled and beneficial success, while Christianity 
there is an undoubted failure. The replies of Canon McColl Bosworth 
Smith show that Canon Taylor was partly right. The superior success of 
Mohammedanism in Africa is due to the fact that it agrees better with 
the material and practical which it is within the power of the crude 
African mind to accept. 



ORIENTAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA. 687 

Theodore Child gave a description of a visit to Constantinople. He 
narrates his treatment by the cnstom-hoiise officers, his visit to the ba- 
zar, with notes on the mnnicipal and social life of Staniboul. Gnide- 
books are of very little help to the visitor of Stamboul, at least, to a 
man who really wants to know the life and social condition of the city. 

A. L. Froth ingham sketched the development and character of Mo- 
hammedan education. The contrast between the liberal and the pro- 
gressive Arab of the Khalifate, and the intolerent and fanatical part 
of the East, are not to be lost sight of in a judgment of the culture of 
Mohammedanism. He traces the development and character of Arab- 
ian culture as influenced by the civilization of Byzantium, Syria, and 
Persia; gives the curriculum of studies; names the three institutions 
of instruction (school, college, and mosque), and points out the strong 
moral element in their education. 

F. H. Hedge, in an article on Mohammedan Mysticism, affirms that 
the recent account of the superior success, as compared with the Chris- 
tian, of Mohammedan missions in Africa confirms the former estimate 
of the prophet of Islam, whose claims were for the first time vindicated 
by Thomas Carlyle in 1840, and M. Barthilemy St. Hilaire in 1SG5. 
Mohammed borrowed much of liis religion from Judaism, but, notwith- 
standing that this is the dominant element, he favored an un-Jewish 
mysticism. He compares Mohammed's life with that of David. The two 
most obnoxious features of his religion, fatalism and the sensual char- 
acter of his paradise, are found in the belief held by some branches of 
the Christian church, and, on the whole, are grossly misunderstood. 
He furnishes the biography of a saintly woman, Rabia, and closes with 
a few extracts from Tholuck's Anthology of Eastern Mystics (1825). 

Thomas P. Hughes discussed the Moslem's Bible, or Koran. Two 
hundred and one millions receive and venerate the Koran as the word of 
God. It is read more devoutly, more extensively, by the Moslems 
than the Christian Bible by the Christians. The Moslem takes religion 
seriously. The Koran contains some eighty thousand words, arranged 
in one hundred and fourteen chapters, called soorahs. The finest col- 
lection of ancient MSS. is in the library at Cairo. Whosoever can re- 
cite the whole Koran from memory is dignified with the title of haflz, or 
protector of the faith. The early chapters are merely poetic effusions. 
The Koran is not an historic book; five periods can be distinguished in 
its composition. 

E. P. Sanguinetti related his impressions of Constantinople ; his jour- 
ney to Batna, one of the French military outposts; an excursion to the 
tomb of Sidi Okbar ; an Arab marriage, and his experiences in the Arab 
markets. 

Lawrence M. Simmons gave a brief statement of the views of Philippi 
and Wright on the separation which may take place between the so- 
called defined and defining noun in Arabic, followe I by a translation 
from the celebrated '• Watchfire" of the late ^STasif AlYazigi, showing 
the tfe^tment of this subject by a native grammarian. 



688 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS. 

C. H. Toy described some phouetic ijecaliarities of Cairo Arabic, 
especially the Egyptian mute Gym, palatal q, and the pronunciation of 
the dentals. In the Cairo pronunciation the old Arabic th and dh be- 
come t and d) in some cases Ihe Cairo fricatives pass into sibilants. 

George Washburn summarized the articles of the Mohammedan 
creed. Islamism has for its base faith in the unity of God and in the 
mission of his dearest servant Mohammed. The book of God which 
descended last from Heaven is the sacred Koran. The first of the 
prophets was Adam and the last Mohammed; the greatest of all is 
Mohammed, etc. 

Caroline E. Wright described the worship of the dervishes of Cairo. 
The preliminary prayers over, the curtain of the entrance door is raised, 
and giaours are admitted to the sanctuary. At this moment the chief 
dervish and other dervishes were prostrate, with their heads on the 
ground in the direction of meihrah, and for nearly half an hour they 
continued kneeling, praying and bowing, rocking to and fro, reciting 
the Koran in a twanging nasal tone. Then follows the howling of the 
litany, with its unison refrain Allah-hou, Allah-hou. 

OLD TESTAMENT AND HEBREW. 

Benjamin Wisner Bacon presented in tabular form the results of the 
principal schools of higher Biblical criticism, including fragments and 
portions assigned to editors, interpolators, compilers, and glossators. 
His classification is: Priestly Law Book, P^; Ephraimite Narrative, F; 
Judean Narrative, J; Law of Holiness, P'. 

E. C. Bissell published a work on Biblical Antiquities, for i)opular 
use. It embraces the main facts under the classification of domestic, 
civil, and sacred antiquities. 

W. G. Blakio has publishetl the first and second books of Samuel. 
Tbey belong to the series called the Expositor's Library, based on the 
plan of giving tlie substance of scripture in a running commentary or 
connected narrative, which furnishes all needful explanations. 

C. A. Briggs continued his studies on the forms of Hebrew poetry. 
The tetrameters are measured by four beats of the accent, and are often 
divided by a ciBsura into two halves. Examples are Psalm xlvi, 13 ; 
2 Samuel i, 19-27; Exodus xv; Psalm Ixxxix. Tetrameters are not so 
numerous as the pentameters. The, pentameter is measured by five beats 
of the rythmical accentj the ca;sura usually comes after the third 
beat. Examples are Lamentations iii ; Psalm cxix ; Jonah ii ; Psalms 
cxx, cxxxiv (the dirge of Babylon) ; Isaiah xlvii. The hexameter is a 
doable trimeter. Instances of hexameter are Proverbs xxxi, 12 ft*; Psalm 
cxxxvii; Isaiah Ix, and Jeremiah viii, 9. 

T. K. Cheyne oflers an emendation to Job iii, 14, and translates " to 
build up ruined places'." 

Howard Crosby asserts that the revised Old Testament is too much 
a xievv edition of the old authorized version, jiyd illustriites thi§ by a* 



ORIENTAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA. 689 

passage from the book of Job (xxviii, 1-12), which, of all the Old Testa- 
ment writings, needed tbe most thorough revision. Against Cheyue he 
shows that the Cyrus inscription, and the statements contained in Isaiah 
xliv, 28, and xlv^, 1-13, do not really contradict each other. Cyrus may 
have treated Bel, and Nebo, and Merodach with the greatest courtesy, 
and yet have sent the Jews back as a wise piece of policy. 

James D. Dana discussed the cosmogony of Genesis in reply to Canon 
Driver (Defense and Critique, Andov. Rev., 1887). He favors the stand 
taken by Guyot, and holds that the flats of Genesis did not produce 
completed results, but initiated slowly developing processes. 

T. G. Dashiel maintains that the Old Testament teaches practically 
the doctrine of eternal existence. 

Samuel Davidson. Notes on the Psalms : ii, 12; iv, 3; vi, 2; viii, 2; 
xii, 7 ; xvi, 3, render : as to the saints who are in the land and the no- 
bles, all my pleasure is in them; xviii; xix; xxii, 17; xxv, 11; xxix, 2; 
xxxii, 9, With bit and bridle their youth must be bound; they do not 
come near thee otherwise; xxxvi, 13; xxxvii, 38; xxxix, 3; xlii, 5; xlv; 
xlviii, 3; li ; liii ; Iv; Ivi ; Ivii; Iviii, 2; Ix, G; Ixiv, 7; Ixv, 6; Ixvi ; 
Ixviii; Ixix; Ixx ; Ixxii; Ixxiii, 4; Ixxiv, 19; Ixxvi, 5, and Ixxvii, 11, 
17-20. 

W. N. Davis characterized the Gholmah or Hebrew philosophy. It 
dates its development from the age of Solomon. It differs from the 
Greek philosophy in taking for granted the existence of an omniscient, 
omnipotent, and omnipresent God. Hebrew wisdom is inseparable 
from morals; wisdom and right living are synonomous terms. The 
best specimens of the Chokmah are found in Ecclesiastes and Job. In 
discussing Job xix, 25-7, he holds there is no evidence that the word 
"redeemer," used in Job xix, 25, can be applied to Christ, "the 
Redeemer." The word Goel used here is avenger, blood relative. He 
explains what a Gael is and translates verse 25. "I know that my Goel 
lives and my vindicator will arise upon the earth ; (26) and after my 
sin is thus destroyed, and without my flesh (body) I shall see God." 

Marcus Dod's edition of the Book of Genesis belongs to the series 
called " The Expositor's Bible." 

G. C. M. Douglas reviews Tke prophecies of Isaiah, by T. K. Cheyne; 
and Isaiah, his life, and times, and writings, by S. R. Driver. Douglas 
does not agree with the position of either Cheyne or Driver, and gives 
his reason at length; there is nothing to justify us in disbelieving the 
universal and unbroken tradition which attributes them to Isaiah, the 
alleged reasons being misconceptions. 

J. F. Genung discussed the interpretation of the Book of Job. Many 
of its difficulties are due less to original fault than to crude interpreta- 
tion of them. The so-called debate-theory, with its assumed main sub- 
ject, "the mystery of God's providential government of men," does not 
result in an exposition so homogeneous as we could wish ; it does not 
r(!ach the heart of the book. The problem of the book is doth Job fear 
H. Mis. 142 — -44

God for naught ? And the solution of it is Job himself, the man Job. 
The poem is an epic, not a drama. It is the epic of the inner life ; as 
such its significance extends far beyond national bounds to the universal 
heart of humanity. 

W. H. Green proposed a new nomenclature for the Hebrew tenses ; 
he prefers preterit and future as designations of the Hebrew tenses to 
perfect and imperfect, and holds that these tenses primarily and prop- 
erly denote the time of action, and not simply its mode as complete or 
incomplete. He has re-edited his Hebrew grammar, first published 
twenty-seven years ago; it has been revised throughout and the syntax 
entirely recast. 

VV. R. Harper published Elements of Hebrew Syntax and discussed 
the Peutateuchal question ; he presented a detailed analysis of the 
Hexateuch, in parallel columns, giving not only the chapters and verses 
by sections as they are divided by critics, but also the topics of which 
each section treats. An introductory note states the points (7) agreed 
upon by the two schools. Then follow the facts and considerations 
urged in favor of the analysis of Genesis i, 1,-xii 5, in sections. 

Edward P. Humphrey (in ^Sacred History, from the Creation to the Giv- 
ing of the Law) defends the traditional view of the Mosaic records. 
The difficulties which are supposed to embarrass the ±vlosaic account of 
the creation he classes as follows: (1) All those questions iu which the 
meaning of the text is fully ascertained and ojiposing sciences are im- 
mature. (2) The problems in which natural science is mature and the 
Bible is not understood. (3) Where the results of science are incom- 
plete and proper explanation of the Bible is not yet reached. 

M. Jastrow, sr., discussed the transposed stems in Talmndic, Hebrew, 
and Chaldaic, especially the reduplicated stems, the so-called pilpels 
and pal pels of verbs and nouns. 

K. Kohler criticised the arrangement and method of Jastrow's Tal- 
mndic dictionary, especially the tendency to give up derivations from 
the Greek aud find Semitic etymologies. 

Thomas Lauris rendered Genesis xli, 32, 'Hhe dream was told or set 
forth to Pharaoh twice." 

G. F, Moore gave a sketch of the history of Semitic studies iu this 
country from the settlement of New England to about 1875. The author 
describes the state of learning among the Puritans, and its gradual 
decadence; then, at greater length, the revival of Biblical science in 
the early part of this century, with brief biographical notices of Stuart 
and other leading representatives of this movement; and gives, finally, 
without any attempt at exhaustiveness, a survey of the more recent 
literature. A second article is to contain a fuller account of the work, 
of the last ten years. He pointed out some seeming evidence that the 
supralinear system of vowels originated under Arab influence. 

Henry Preserved Smith reviewed Victor Eysoels The text of Micah, 
part I (1887). The book is one of real importance. The text of Micah's 



ORIENTAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA. 691 

prophecies is corrupt aud must be corrected from the aucieut versions. 
He also discussed the value of the Targum to Jeremiah : in seventy pas- 
sages, the Targum helps us to determine the text of the book of Jere- 
miah. In fixing our Old Testament text we must not ignore this version. 

W. O. Sproull holds that the native language of Abraham was 
Aramaic, since he emigrated from Ur of the Chaldees to the laud of 
Canaan (Genesis, xi,31). It is probable, however, that he knew Hebrew 
before he came into the land of Can-aan, for there is no indication that 
he had any difficulty in conversing with its inhabitants. 

A. W. Thayer calls attention to the fact that Professor Graetz, of 
Breslau, has prepared a revised text of the Massoretic Bible, which is 
now awaiting publication. 

PEDAGOGICS. 

At the fall meeting of the American Oriental Society, Francis Brown 
A. L. Frothingham, jr., W. H. Green, W. R. Harper, Paul Haupt, 
Morris Jastrow, jr., D. G. Lyon, C. H. Toy, and W. H. Ward discussed 
the history of Semitic studies in this country, and offered suggestions 
for the future. The remarks were collected and published in Hebraica 
with an introduction by Morris Jastrow, jr. 

PERSIA. 

Morris Jastrow discussed the plan of the Palace of Artaxerxes 
Mnemon, compared it with the description of the Palace of Ahasuerus 
in the book of Esther, and accepts M. Dieluafoy's conclusion, that the 
palace he discovered ai Susa is the one described in the book of Esther. 

SAMARITAN. 

G. F. Moore described a fraguient of a manuscript of the Samaritan 
Pentateuch deposited by Grant-Bey in the Librarj' of Andover Sem- 
inary. The fragment contains Ex. viii, 16 — xxx, 28; it is of the thirteenth 
century, and apparently a part of the codex described by Rosen, Zeit- 
schrift cler Deutschen Morgenldndischen gesellschaff, xviii, oS6. 

SEMITIC PHILOLOGY. 

E. P. Allen answered G. F. Moore's objections to his former paper on 
Semitic sounds and their transliteration. Allen's theory is that the so- 
called Semitic emphatic consonants are distinguished by a combination 
of mouth position with the glottal catch. 

G. F. Moore questions the theory that the distinctive characteristic 
of the emphatic consonants is a combination of glottal catch with mouth 
articulation. 



692 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS. 

SYRIAC. 

Robert H. Beattie described tbe recent changes ni life in Syria and 
the new opportunities they bring to American scholarship and industry. 

Syriac literature has been enriched by the discov^ery and description 
of a number of unedited texts. 

Isaac H. Hall described a manuscript recently acquired by the Union 
Theological Seminary of New York, consisting of the service of obse- 
quies, and introduced by the ritual of the washing of the dead, publish- 
ing portions of the text with translation; a manuscript of the Peshitto 
four Gospels, the property of Beloit College, Wisconsin, accompanied 
by a manuscript of the traditions of the Apostles, text and translation 
of which are given. 

R. J. H. Gottheil published a manuscript containing a fragment of a 
Porphyry in the Berlin Library; a Syriac geographical chart; text of 
Berlin manuscript tract on the Syriac conjunctions and a collation of a 
text of a portion of the Targums in a map or manuscript in the Library 
of the Temple Emanuel, New York. 

G. F. Moore called attention to the fact that four of the British Mu- 
seum Hebrew manuscripts with theTargum recently acquired from Yemen 
are in this same hand, and together form a complete Bible ; also to the 
excellent character of the Targum text. 

The New York Tribune of August 12, 1888, gave a description of a 
Syrian commencement and the scenes attendant on the closing of the 
American College at Beirut.

BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 



SPENCER FULLERTON BAIRD.* 



By Egbert Eidgway. 



Mr. President and Members of the American Ornitholo- 
gists' Union: Wbeu asked by the worthy president of our union to 
prepare a memorial address upon the life and services to ornithology 
of our great teacher and leader, Professor Baird, it was with many mis- 
givings that the invitation with which I was thus honored was accepted ; 
for, glad as I am to render what tribute I can to the revered memory 
of a departed and beloved friend, the sense of my own inability to do 
justice to such a subject has almost deterred me from the attempt. 

The preparation of an address which shall consist essentially of .new 
matter is rendered particularly difficult by the circumstance that there 
has already been published by Prof. G. Brown Goode, in Bulletin 20 of 
the TJ. S. National Museum, an excellent biography of Professor Baird, 
giving in detail a history of the principal events and chief results of his 
life, together with a complete bibliogrni)hy of his publications. Since 
the present memoir is intended to deal more particularly with Professor 
Baird as an ornithologist, the reader is referred for more general 
information to Professor Goode's admirable " Biographical Sketch," 
from which are taken most of the chronological data and the occasional 
quotations in the following prelude to what I have to offer from my 
own personal knowledge of the life, labors, attainments, and personal 
qualities of one who in history must hold a place at the head of Ameri- 
can naturalists, and in the hearts of those who knew him a place which 
none other can fill. 

Spencer Fullerton Baird was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, Feb- 
ruary 2, 1823. In 1831 he was sent to a Quaker boarding school at 
Port Deposit, Maryland, and the following year to the Reading gram- 
mar school. In 1837 he entered Dickinson College, graduating in 1810, 
at the age of seventeen. The next several years were spent in making

winter's course of lectures at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, 
in New York, in 1842, though he never formally completed his medical 
course. "In 1845 he was chosen professor of natural history in Dick- 
inson College, and in 1846 his duties and emoluments were increased 
by election to the chair of natural history and chemistry in the same 
institution. July 5, 1850, he accepted the position of Assistant Secre- 
tary of the Smithsonian Institution, and October 3, at the age of 
'twentyseveu years, he entered upon his life work in connection with 
that foundation — 'the increase and diffusion of knowledge among 
men.' " 

Mr. Goode informs ns that " his ancestry upon one side was Eng- 
lish, upon the other Scotch and German. His paternal grandfather 
was Samuel Baird, of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, a surveyor by profes- 
sion, whose wife was Rebecca Potts." The Bairds were from Scotland, 
while the Potts family came from England to Pennsylvania at the close 
of the seventeenth century. " His great grandfather on the mother's 
side was the Eev. EHhu Spencer, of Trenton, one of the war preachers 
of the Revolution, whose i)atriotic eloquence was so intluential that a 
price was set on his head by the British Government; his daughter 
married William M. Biddle, a banker, of an English family for many 
generations established in Pennsylvania, and identified with the bank- 
ing interests of Philadelphia. Samuel Baird, the father of the subject 
of this sketch, established himself as a lawyer at Reading, Pennsylvania, 
and died when his son was ten years old. He was a man of line culture, 
a strong thinker, a close observer, and a lover of nature and out-of-door 
pursuits. His traits were inherited by his children, especially by his 
sons Spencer and William. The latter, who was the elder, was the first 
to begin collecting specimens, and as early as 1836 had in hand a col- 
lection of the game-birds of Cumberland County. His brother soon 
became his companion in this pursuit, and six years later they published 
conjointly a paper entitled ' Descriptions of two species, supposed to be 
new, of the Genus Tyrannula Swainsou, found in Cumberland County, 
Pennsylvania.' " * 

Early in 1838 Professor Baird became acquainted with Audubon, 
" with whom he was for many years in correspondence, and who, in 
1843, gave to him the greater part of his collection of birds, including 
most of his types of new species." In 1841 a very intimate friendship was 
begun with George N. Lawrence, of New York, with John Cassin of 
Philadelphia, in 1843, and Thomas M. Brewer, of Boston, in 1845. These 
close friendships continued through life, though of these ornithologists 
only the first named survives him, the others having died before Pro- 
fessor Baird. They were all at one time or another associated with him 
in his ornithological work. 

* These species are now known as Empidonax flaviventri^ Bairtl and U. minimm

SPENCER F. BAIRD. 705 

Although his eUler brother had anticipated hiui by a few years iu be- 
ginning the formation of a collection, he soon " diverged into other 
paths," and became a lawyer in Reading, Pennsylvania,* leaving to 
him the field of ornithology, which he cultivated so assiduously that 
when the catalogue of liis collection t was closed, at number 3696, al- 
most every species of bird occurring, regularly or otherwise, in eastern 
and central Pennsylvania was represented, and in most cases by series 
of specimens showing the different stages and phases of plumage. This 
collection, deposited there by Professor Baird when he entered upon his 
duties as Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, is still iu 
the National Museum, of whose ornithological treasures it forms an im- 
portant element, so many of its specimens having served as the types 
of Professor Baird's descriptions iu his " Birds of North America " and 
subsequent works. In it are " specimens of birds prepared by these 
boys forty-five [now nearly fifty] years ago by a simple process of 
evisceration, followed by stufiSng the body-cavities full of cotton and 
arsenical soap" — a method probably adopted by them before they had 
learned the art of skinning birds. 

Although his collection was made at a time when'the art of taxider - v 
is generally supposed to have been far behind its present status, espe- 
ciall3' so far as this country is concerned, the excellent preparation of 
the specimens, their very precise labelling and perfect preserv^ation, 
show Professor Baird to have been in every respect the peer of any 
ornithological collector of the present i^eriod. Exposed for more than 
thirty years to constant handling and everything that could effect their 
deterioration, they are still in a most excellent state of perservation, 
and none have lost their labels. I have never known a specimen of 
Professor Baird's preparation to be attacked by insects, a statement 
which I am able to make regarding few other collections of which I 
possess the knowledge to speak. The force of these observations may 
be better appreciated when it is considered that probably no other 
collection of skins has ever received so much handling as that made by 
Professor Baird, every standard work on North American birds pub- 
lished since 1850 having been based essentially upon it, so far as eastern 
species are concerned. Not only are the specimens prepared and pre- 
served in a manner equalled by only the best of our living collectors, 
but their labels are fastened with unusual security, and contain very 
precise data, including scientific name (with authority), sex, age, 
locality, and date ; and usually, on the reverse side, the total length 
and stretch of wings, measured before skinning. 

The formation of so large and varied a collection of course in-

volved such a vast amount of field work as to remove Professor 
Baird from the limbo of so-called "closet-naturalists." How pleasant 
and instructive to liim must have been his out-of-door studies of birds 
may be inferred from the extent of his excursions, which are thus de- 
scribed by Mr. Goode : 

"In 1841, at the age of eighteen, we find him making an ornithologi- 
cal excursion through the mountains of Pennsylvania, walking four 
hundred miles in twenty-one days, the last day sixty miles betMcen day- 
light and rest.* The following year he walked more than 2,200 miles. 
His fine physique and consequent capacity for work are doubtless due 
in part to his outdoor life during these years." 

Considering Professor Baird's great interest in the study of birds, the 
number of his ornithological publications is astonishingly small, amount- 
ing to only seventy-nine different titles (see Mr. Goode's Bibliography, 
pp. 250-253). It is, therefore, strikingly evident that his publications 
must have possessed unusual merit to earn for him so great a reputation 
as ar. ornithologist. This reputation was indeed established by the first 
of his separate works, usually known and quoted as "The Birds of North 
ja.merica," though not published under this title until two years after its 
publication by the Government as volume ix of the "E-eport of Explo- 
rations and Surveys, to ascertain the most practicable and economical 
route for a Kailroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean." 
With the publication, in 1858, of this great quarto volume of more than 
one thousand pages, began what my distinguished colleague, Professor 
Coues, has fitly termed the " Bairdian Period" of American ornithology — 
a period covering almost thirty years and characterized by an activity 
of ornithological research and rapidityofadvancement without a parallel 
in the history of the science. Referring to this great work, in his " Bib- 
liographical Appendix" to "Birds of the Colorado Valley" (page 650), 
Professor Coues says : " It represents the most important single step ever 
taken in the progress of American ornithology in all that relates to the 
technicalities. The nomenclature is entirely re-modelled from that of the 
immediately preceding Audubonian period, and for the first time brought 
abreast of the then existing aspect of the case. - - - The synon- 
ymy of the work is more extensive and elaborate and more reliable 
than any before presented; the compilation was almost entirely original, 
very few citations having been made at second-hand, and these being 
indicated by quotation marks. The general text consists of diagnoses 
or descriptions of each species, with extended and elaborate criticisms, 
comparisons, and commentary. - - - The appearance of so great a 
work, from the hands of a most methodical, learned, and sagacious 
naturalist, aided by two of the leading ornithologists of America (John 
Cassin and George N. Lawrence), exerted an influence perhaps stronger 
and more wiflely felt than that of any of its predecessors, Audubon's

walked forty miles in eight consecutive hours.

and Wilsoii'S not excepted, and marked an epocli in the history of 
American oniitholooy. Tlie synonymy ami si)ecific cliarai^ters, original 
in this work, have been nsed again and again by subseiinent writers, 
with varions modifications ami abridgment, and are in fact a large basis 
of the technical portion of the snbseqnent ' History of N^orth American 
Birds,' by Baird, Brewer, and Ridgvvay. Such a, monument of original 
research is likely to remain for an indefinite period a source of inspira- 
tion to lesser writers, while its authority as a work of reference will 
always endure." 

Thus are graphically described the distinctive features of what Mr. 
Leonhard Stejneger has truthfully termed the Bairdian School* of 
ornithology, a school strikingly characterized by peculiar exactness in 
dealing with facts, conciseness in expressing deductions, and careful 
analysis of the subject in its various bearings ; — methods so radically 
different from those of the older " European School " that, as the 
esteemed member whom we have just named has already remarked, t 
conclusions or arguments can be traced back to their source and thus 
properly weighed, whereas the latter affords no basis for analysis. In 
other words, as Mr. Stejneger has, in substance, said, the European 
School requires the investigator to accept an author's statements and 
conclusions on his personal responsibility alone, while the Bairdian 
furnishes him with tangible facts from which to take his deductions. 

The dominant sources of Professor Baird's training in systematic or- 
nithology are not difficult to trace ; in fact, the bases of his classifications 
are so fully explained or frequently mentioned in his various works as to 
leave nothing to mere inference. He studied carefully the more ad- 
vanced systems of his time, and with unerring instinct selected from 
them their best features, and combined them, together with original ideas, 
into a classification which was an improvement on its predecessors. 
Thus, the classification presented in the "Birds of North America" 
(1858) is based essentially upon the systems of Sundevall {" Ornitholo- 
giskt System," 1835 and 1843), Gabanis ("Ornithologische Notizen," 
1847), and Keyserling and Blasius (" Wirbelthiere Europas," 1340). 
The nomenclature was fixed by methods adopted from G. R. Gray 
("List of the Genera of Birds," etc., 1841-42), to the abandonment of 
which must be attributed most of the subsequent changes in generic 
names. In the " Review" (1864-'0G) and "History of jS^orth American 
Birds" (1874), a further concession is made to the classifications of Sun- 
devall and Cabanis by commencing with the Order Passeres and Fam- 
ily Turdida'. instead of the Kaptores. The same systems were the 
foundation of Liljeborg's "Classification of Birdsj" formally adopted by 
the Smithsonian Institution (through Professor Baird) in 1800, by 
Messrs. Sclater and Salvin (with certain emendations ami amplifica-

tions) in 1873, and with still farther raodiflcatious by the American 
Ornitholoji^istB' Union, in 188G. 

Tlie distinctive featnres of the "Bairdian School" were still farther 
developed by the pnblication, in 1804-66, of the "Review of American 
Birds," a work of uneqnalled merit, displaying in their j^erfection Pro- 
fessor Baird's wonderful powers of analysis and synthesis, so strongly 
combined in his treatment of difficult problems. Unfortunately for 
ornithology this work was bat fairly begun, only a single volume (an 
octavo of 450 pages) being published. The cause of its discontinuance 
is not definitely known to the present writer, but it may have been the 
intervention of the " Ornithology of California," * a work based on the 
manuscript notes of Dr. J., G. Cooper, but edited by Professor Baird, 
who also superintended its publication, and the " History of North 
American Birds," t material for which was already being arranged, be- 
sides other literary work and the increasing pressure of administrative 
duties. Whatever the cause, however, its discontinuance is to be 
regretted, since its completion would have given us an invaluable guide 
to the study of Neotropical birds, I have it on good authority 
that no single work on American ornithology has made so profound an 
impression on European ornithologists as Professor Baird's '■'■ K'eview ;" 
and, by the same authority, lam permitted to state that he — a European 
by birth and rearing — became an American citizen through its influence. 

In the ])reface to the present writer's latest work on American 
ornithology! the author is proud to mention that the book was " orgi- 
nally projected by Professor Spencer F. Baird, - - - whose works 
represent the highest type of systematic ornithology and have furnished 
the model from which the younger generation of ornithologists have 
drawn their inspiration ;" and that his friendly advice and suggestions 
had rendered comparatively easy the performance of a task which under 
less favorable ausjuces would have ]»een far more difficult of accomplish- 
ment — acknowledgments which but faintly express the author's obliga- 
tion to his tutor.

SPENCER F. BAIRD. 709 

In commenting' upon the value of Professor Baird's contributions to 
scientific literature, Professor Goode remaiks that" no one not living in 
tbe i)resent can form an accurate idea of the personal influence of aleader 
upon his associates and upon the progress of thought in his special de- 
partment, nor can such an Influence as this well be set down in words. 
Tbis influence is apparently due not only to extraordinary skill in organ- 
ization, to great power of application and concentration of thought con- 
stantly applied, and to a philosophical and comprehensive mind, but to 
an entire and self-sacrificing devotion to the interests of his own work 
and that of others." 

But it is not only through his published works and personal influence 
with his associates and pupils that Professor Baird was powerful in 
the development and advancement of ornithology in America. His 
position as head of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Mu- 
seum gave him peculiar opportunities for putting into practical shape 
his plans for a thorough exploration of little known portions of the 
continent. "To his influence with the Government authorities is due 
theexcelleut field-work done in connection with nearly all the Government 
surveys and the Signal Service Bureau, from the first inception of the va- 
rious Pacific Railroad surveys to the present time."* If the exploration of 
a particular field suggested itself to him, he rarely failed to find, sooner 
or later, means to accomplish the object in view ; no opportunity for 
making use of, or securing the co-operation of, other departments of the 
Government in maintaining explorations which he had himself insti- 
gated or organized was ever neglected, and for such opportunities he 
was constantly alert. His success in thus promoting the cause of science 
was, however, by no means wholly due to the importance of his official 
positions, his personal zeal and influence often accomplishing what 
might not otherwise have been successful. 

The sterling qualities of mind and heart which were so conspicuous 
in Professor Baird's character were as well known and as highly appre- 
ciated abroad as at home. As an illustration of this fact, I quote the 

lytical or synoptical tables of tbe larger work, improved and somewbat enlarged by 
tbe introduction of brief diagnoses of tbe nests and eggs of tbe dittereut species, 
together witb tbe Euglisb names. Tbis book, of wbicb tbere exists only a single 
copy, and tbat not perfect, was completed early in 1874. Its title is "Outlines of 
American Ornitbology, by S. F. Baird and R. Ridgway. Part I, Land Birds." For 
some reason tbe work was never publisbed, and tbe electrotype plates were desti'oyed.' 
Tbis work, in wbicb the present writer bad some sbare, was tbe embryo wbicb, after 
twelve years' incubation, finally developed into tbe more comprebeusive " Manual 
of North American Birds," in the preparation of which, however, Professor Baird 
took no active part, though it is scarcely necessary to say that he was much in- 
terested in its progress, even almost to the close of his life, which ended shortly after 
the work had betm printed, but before it could be published. It has been a matter 
of deej) regret to the author tbat Professor Baird could not have bad a sbare in the 
preparation of the book, and still more that be could not have lived to enjoy tbe 
satisfaction of seeing it i»ubli8bed.

following- obituary notice in "Natiiie" for August 25, by Mr. R. Bowdler 
Sbarpe, senior assistant, Department of Zoology, in the British Museum, 
well know^n as an ornithologist of eminence: 

"By Englishmen who knew Professor Baird personally, the loss must 
be especially felt, but there are many who never had met him in the 
flesh, to whom the news of his decease must come as that of a dear 
friend. As one of the latter class we venture to express our sympathy 
with our scientific brethren in America on the decease of one of their 
most eminent and respected colleagues. As chief of the Smithsonian 
Institution, Professor Baird possessed a power of conferring benefits on 
the world of science exercised by few directors of public museums, and 
the manner in which he utilized these powers has resulted not only in 
the wonderful success of the United States National Museum under 
his direction, but in the enrichment of many other museums which 
were in friendly intercourse with the Smithsonian Institution. We 
know by experience that the British Museum is indebted beyond meas- 
ure to Professor Baird, and we need only to refer to the recent volumes 
of the 'Catalogue of Birds' to show how much our National Museum 
owes to the sister museum in America for hearty co-operation. We had 
only to write and express our wants, and immediately every effort was 
made, by Professor Baird's instructions, to supply all the desiderata in 
our ornithological collection, and this without the slightest demand for 
an equivalent exchange, though, of course, in the case of the British 
Museum every effort was made to reciprocate the good feeling shown 
by the great American museum. There must be many private collect- 
ors in this country who will endorse our acknowledgments to Professor 
Baird for the unrivalled liberality which he has always shown in the 
advancement of the studies of every ornithologist who invoked his aid. 
- - - We may add that during an experience of twenty years we 
have never heard from any ornithologist, European or American, a 
single unkind word concerning Professor Baird, either in his public or 
private capacity. This is something to say in this age of jealousies and 
backbitings." 

Indeed, it may with truth be said that so widespread, so nearly uni- 
versal has been his influence that few there are, if any, among his 
contemporaries who have not had occasion to record their sense of obli- 
gation for his aid, his counsel, or his noble example. We all delight 
to acknowledge him our great teacher, and in doing so do honor to 
ourselves. 

A very marked trait of Professor Baird's character was his aversion 
to personal controversy, which was so decided that under no circum- 
stances could he be drawn into one. It was his invariable rule to 
answer his critics by a dignified silence, no matter how great the provo- 
cation to reply, or how strong a case his side presented ; and in every 
instance known to the writer it has transpired that the ground taken or 
the statements made by Professor Baird have stood the test of time. 
" One of his striking characteristics was that he would never quarrel 



SPENCER F. BAIRD. 711 

and never have auythiug to do witl) the quarrels of others. lie was 
always for peace,'' * 

As a public officer, no man was more conscientiously devoted to his 
duty or faithful in its performance ; and he administered the compli- 
cated affairs of three distinct and important establishments with an 
ability which commanded admiration, although it was plainly to be 
seen that the responsibilities were too great for any single person to 
bear. His capacity for work was enormous, and he was constantly oc- 
cupied. He enjoyed work, and it was not his industry which hurt him; 
but the harassing cares of his public trusts and the weight of their re- 
sponsibility were too much for even his powerful physique to endure, 
and he gave way under the strain. 

No man was more easily approached than Professor Baird, or greeted 
a new acquaintance more cordially. His reception of young persons — 
especially those with an inclination for natural history, was particularly 
charming, at once relieving them from embarrassment and captivating 
them by his unassuming manners, his geniality, and frankness. 

Trusting that he does not introduce too prominently his own person- 
ality into this memoir, the writer ofters the following brief outline of 
his personal acquaintance with Professor Baird, as being ot probable 
interest to members of the Union, and as giving an insight into the 
character of his lamented friend. 

Until near the middle of the year 1864, the writer, then a lad in his 
fourteenth year, was unacquainted with the name of any living natu- 
ralist, or with any books on natural history except such general or 
superficial compilations as Goldsmith's 'Animated Nature,' a history 
of the United States (author forgotten) which included a chapter or 
two on the natural history, and Goodrich's 'Animal Kingdom' — works 
which, although supplying much valuable information to the general 
reader, were of course wholly inadequate to the wants of a special 
student. A lady resident in the town learned of his difficulties, and 
suggested that by writing to the Commissioner of Patents in Washing- 
ton he might be able to obtain the correct names of birds, supplement- 
ing her fortunate suggestion by the gift. of an envelope bearing the 
printed address of a former Commissioner of Patents. A letter was 
written, and with it was inclosed a colored drawing, life size, of a pair 
of Purple Finches (''Roseate Grosbeak, Loxia rosea,^^ of the incipient 
ornithologist) perched upon a dry stalk of the great ragweed {Ambrosia 
trijidd), the seeds of which in winter constitute the principal food of 
the bird in that locality. An ausw er was awaited with great impa- 
tience, but in due time was received, the following being an exact copy :

Tbe above letter was a revelation to tbe recipieut, wbo, iu bis isola- 
tion, was ignorant of tbe existence of any one but bimself engaged in 
tbe study of birds. He had read of Audubon and Wilson, and Nut- 
tall, and Bouaparte, but these be knew were all dead. The profound 
imi)ressiou produced by the letter and the hope that it gave, may be 
imagined. From tbis commencement arose a correspondence whicb to 
tbe present writer was a constant source of delight aud instruction, 
aud to wbich be looks back with feelings tbat cannot be expressed. It 
was not until the early part of 1807, nearly three years later, that the 
writer obtained a copy of tbe text of "Birds of ISTorth America" (vol- 
ume IX, Pacific Railroad Report), aud it therefore became necessary 
for him to continue the sending of drawiugs and descriptious in order 
to obtain the much-desired identifications. In replying to tbe writer's 
numerous letters of tliis character, Professor Baird always wrote most 
kindly and encouragingly, replying to multitudiuous queries as fully as 
the arduous duties of his official position would allow. To mention all 
the useful hints whicb be ga;ve would require to much space here, but 
the following are selected as samples : 

"I would advise you to spend most of jour leisure time in practising 
drawing of birds and mammals from nature and from life, so as to ac- 
quire a facility in seizing a temporary attitude and transferring it to 
pajjer. Make these sketches continually whenever you bave the op- 
portunity, so as to secure the more practice. A certain number of 
these drawiugs you may work up in their minutest details, and it will 
be a good exercise to draw the feathers of a single wing, as well as bill, 
feet, etc., and skulls of mammals. The object should be in drawing

form to secure artistic elegance and at the same time a minute, almost 
microscopic, accui-acy in matters of detail, as far as they can be repre- 
sented. 

" The drawings you have sent are too frargmentary to show what your 
present abilities as an artist are, and I would rather see some full-sized 
figures." - - - ' 

*' It will not be necessary to spend much time in practising coloring, 
as this is rather a mechanical work, easily acquired by practice. The 
first object should be to obtain the highest perfection in drawing the 
form and in filling out minute details." (From a letter dated Decem- 
ber 24, 1865.) 

In a letter dated January 13, 1867, he gave this valuable advice as to 
writing field-notes : " Let me give yon one hint in regard to making notes 
on the specimens. Never write on hoth sides of the same leaf. In this 
way it will be possible to cut apart your notes into slips and assort 
with others of same purport, so as to re-arrange systematically. Do this 
for your own notes as well as those you send me : You will often 
realize the advantage of so doing." 

It is nuuecessary here to go into details concerning events subse- 
quent to the beginning of this correspondence. Suffice it to say that 
in ail his relations with Professor Baird the writer remembers, with 
deepest gratitude and reverence, his uniform great kindness of heart, 
his genial manners, his wise counsels, and his steadfast friendship ; 
and, with others who were so fortunate as to have enjoyed the privi- 
lege of his acquaintance, he mourns a departed friend and teacher, 
whose loss is irreparable.

souiaa lustitution, Director of the U. S. Natioual Museum, and U, S. 
Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries, died at Wood's Holl, Massachu- 
setts, his post of duty in the last-named office. His death at once ex- 
cited throughout the world feelings and expressions of profound regret. 
At that time nearly all of his Washington associates in scientific pursuits 
were absent from the city, on field duty or in vacation, and were thus 
unable to jointly testify to the affection and respect in which he was 
held by them. 

And especially the scientific societies of Washington, none of which 
meet during the summer months, were unable to immediately take any 
action in the matter or to give organized expression to the sentiments 
of their members. 

With the resumption of meetings, however, it was determined that 
such expression should be given with all ceremonial completeness, and 
as the senior of the Washington scientific societies, and the one with 
which Professor Baird had been most closely connected, the Philosoph- 
ical Society took the initial steps in arranging a joint meeting with the 
Anthropological and Biological Societies, a meeting which might enable 
the members and their friends to testify not only their profound respect 
for this foremost scientific leader, but also their affectionate regard for 
the man. 

The appended invitation and programme, which was mailed to all 
members of the Philosoi)hical, Antliropological, Biological, and Chem- 
ical Societies, and of the Cosmos Club, sets forth the form taken in 
those arrangements. 

Washington, January 4, 1888. 

Sir : The Philosophical Society in conjunction with the other scien- 
tific societies of the city will hold a meeting on Wednesday evening, 
January the eleventh, in commemoration of the life and services to

Sinitlisoiiiaii Institution, Director of the National Museum, and United 
States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries.

desire to invite, will assemble in the lecture-room of the Columbian Uni- 
versity, on the southeast corner of H and Fifteenth streets, at a quarter 
past eight o'clock. 
Your presence on this occasion is earnestly desired.

RELATIONS BETWEEN PKOFESSOR BAIRD AND PARTICI- 
PATING SOC5IETIES. 



By Mr. Garrick Mallery, President of the l'hilo>iophical Society. 



Ladies and Gentlemen: During several winters before 1871, a 
club, with commingled social and scientific purposes, used to meet in 
this city at the houses of its members. A single paper on some scien- 
tific subject was read, usually by the host of the evening, following 
which was a discussion. Supper was always j)rovided. The title of 
the club only related to the night of meeting, Saturday, and the or- 
ganization was so loose that several of the survivors among the regu- 
lar participants at the meetings do not now remember whether they 
were actual members, or indeed that there was a definite membership. 
As the city of Washington emergetl from the condition of a Southern 
village, and the benign policy of the Government increased the num- 
ber and force of the scientific institutions at the capital, the need of 
an organization which should bring scientific men together on an equal 
footing and give more time to papers and their discussion became man- 
ifest. To meet this want the attendants of the Saturday-Night Club, 
on March 13, 1871, formed the Philosophical Society of Washington, 
its object, in the words of the call, being " the free exchange of views 
on scientific subjects and the promotion of scientific inquiry among 
its members." 

The term " philosophical," as the first president of the society, 
Joseph Henry, stated in his first address, was chosen after consider- 
able deliberation, " not to denote, as it generally does in the present 
day, the unbounded field of speculative thought, which embraces the 
possible as well as the actual of existence, but to be used in its re- 
stricted sense to indicate those branches of knowledge that relate to 
the positive facts and laws of the physical and moral universe." 

Of the forty-three gentlemen who signed the call twenty-one are now 
dead. Professor Baird was prominent among the founders, and served 
continuously as a member of the general committee from the organi- 
zation to November 10, 1877; and from that date until his death, on 
August 19 last, he was a member of the committee on publications. 

The first communication of a scientific paper to the Society was made 
by him on March 18, 1871. The most important and extended original 

717 



718 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 

papers commuuicated by him were "On the decrease of fish on the 
southern coast of New England," presented March 23, 1872, and "On 
the artificial propagation of the cod, describing the measures and proc- 
ess adopted at Gloucester, Massachusetts, and the success thus far 
obtained," presented March 1, 1879. 

The last-mentioned occasion is memorable to me, and some account 
of it will be interesting to the younger members of the Society, few of 
whom ever heard Professor Baird's voice raised in its hall. I happened 
to join him on his way to the meeting, and during the walk he spoke 
of the struggle at that moment between the sense of duty requiring 
him to take his part in the proceedings of the Society and his repug- 
nance to making any formal address. This modesty — indeed timidity 
— iu an eminent writer and thinker, whose lir;htest words were sure of 
eager attention in a society composed mainly of his personal friends 
and wholly of his admirers, was the more remarkable because his ad- 
dress, presented a few minutes later, was most pleasing in its deliv^ery 
as well as instructive in its substance. He spoke without notes, and, 
though his style was conversational and in no degree oratorical, his 
appropriate words in their rapid flow expressed his thoughts clearly, 
completely, and in orderly sequence. 

During the same walk, Professor Baird mentioned with earnest com- 
mendation the usage of the Society by which the perfect equality of 
members is recognized through the omission of all official and profes- 
sional titles. This was not a merely unwritten custom but was founded 
on a binding resolution, appearing in the min(3tes of June 6, 1874. The 
Society is probably the only non-esoteric body iu the United States 
in which the titles of judge and general, professor and doctor, gov- 
ernor, senator, and even honorable member are forbidden ; the simple 
and dignified Mr., the modern form of magister, being the only address 
allowed. Perhaps the plethoraof titles and the burdensome hierarchical 
gradations in Washington compelled this measure of relief 

The Anthropological Society was founded February 17, 1879, its 
defined object being " to encourage the study of the natural history of 
man, especially with reference to America." Professor Baird warmly 
approved of the organization of this society, took constant interest in 
it, and, at the time of his death, was the only honorary member resid- 
ing in the United States on its rolls. 

The Biological Society was organized December 3, 1880, " to encourage 
the study of the biological sciences," and Professor Baird was the only 
honorary member ever elected by it. He did not take an active part 
in the proceedings of either of the last-mentioned societies but gave 
them material assistance. Both of them met at first iu the Regents' 
room of the Smithsonian Institution, placed by him at their disposal, 
and he provided for the stereotyping and circulation of their volumes 
of transactions, a benefaction which the Philosophical Society had 
earlier enjoyed. 



SPENCER F. BAIRD. 719 

President Heury, in bis address before meutioned, stated that in no 
other city in the United States was there, in proportion to the number 
of its inhabitants, so many men actively engaged in pursuits connected 
with science as in Washington. In the seven following years the num- 
ber of persons in the city engaged in scientific work was nearly doubled, 
and most of them joined the Philosophical Society, so that in the year 
1878 it had become recognized as the most efficient scientific body on 
this continent with a membership confined to a single locality. The 
criteria of this superiority were not only the large membership and reg- 
ular attendance of members, but the number, quality, and variety of the 
papers presented and discussed. This abundance, and, as was proved 
by the later successful establishment of differentiated societies as an 
overflow, this superabundance of scientific papers occupied every mo- 
ment of the meetings, so that the members as such had no opportunity 
to become acquainted with one another or to interchange views, except 
in the formal discussions following the papers announced in the printed 
programs. There was no provision for social introduction or intercourse. 
This appreciated want, the converse of the inadequacy of the Saturday- 
Night Club, resulted in the foundation of the Cosmos Club on Decem- 
ber 13, 1878, in the organization of which all the members of the Philo- 
sophical society were invited to join. It is needless to descant upon 
the unique character of the Cosmos Club in its membershiii and objects, 
its vital connection with science, literature, and art, and its immediate 
but eqduring success. The remark, however, is pertinent that in the 
winter of 1878 an uiiprecedented agitation, excited by impending na- 
tional legislation, perturbed the scientific circles of the Capital, during 
which the proposition to form the club was attacked with virulence as 
a scheme in the selfish interest of a few individuals, and one fraught 
with machiavelian political designs ; but when Professor Baird mani- 
fested his approval of the i^lan by accepting the first presidency of the 
club after its formal organization, confidence in him was so dominant 
that suspicion was allayed and opposition disappeared. To him pro- 
found thanks are due for the timely establishment of the most impor- 
tant institution in the conjoint social and scientific life at Washington. 

But by his work in the organization of these several societies and of 
the Cosmos Club Professor Baird was, as in his other fields of labor, a 
benefactor and not a participant in the benefits secured to others. He 
was imbued with the cardinal principle of the Smithsonian Institution 
not only to establish and assist all useful agencies for the promotion of 
the well-being of man, but afterwards, when they had attained to suc- 
cessful operation, to leave them to themselves and explore new fields 
of beneficence. It was also his own character, apart from any formu- 
lated maxim of the Institution, that he could not rest in the personal

enjoyment of accomplished results. He wasone of the ceaseless work- 
ers, born 

" To sooru delights, aud live laborious days," 

until 

"Comes tlie blind Fury with th' abhorred shears 
And slits the thin-spun life. But not the praise ! " 

It is for us now, repressing sorrow, to join in tributes of praise to our 
benefactor. 



PROFESSOR BAIRD AS ADMINISTRATOR. 



By Mr. Wm. B. Taylor, of the Smithfoiiian Institution. 



TVe are met this evening to express in a memorial service our respect 
for an honored fellow-member of our several societies, lately deceased, 
and to indulge as well in an interchange of affectionate reminiscence of 
a departed friend. 

Spencer FuUerton Baird was born at Reading, Pennsylvania, Febru- 
ary 3, 1823. He was graduated at Dickinson College, in Carlisle, Penn- 
sylvania, in 1840, at the age of seventeen, and with an original fond- 
ness for natural history and the study of the out-door world, he spent 
several years in his favorite pursuits and in collecting animal speci- 
mens for preservation. In 1845, at the youthful age of twenty-two, he 
was elected Professor of Natural History in his alma mater — Dickinson 
College. 

Three years later, in 1848, while still pursuing with ardor the study 
of nature, he applied for and obtained from the Smithsonian Institution 
(then recently established) its first modest grant for the promotion of 
original research. This was t(/ be applied to the exploration of bone 
caves, and to the development of the local natural history of south- 
eastern Pennsylvania. The transaction appears to have been the oc- 
casion of first bringing the young professor to the fiivorable notice of 
the Smithsonian Director, Professor Henry, and of initiating between 
the two a mutual respect and friendship that continued throughout 
their several lives. 

The early history of the Smithsonian Institution was signalized by a 
long struggle— both in the Board of its Regents and in the halls of Con- 
gress, between the votaries of literature, and those of science, for the 
disposal of the Smithson fund. During this period, in 1850, when it 
was seen that the income of this institution was not to be absorbed in 
the building up of a great national library. Professor Henry asked of 
the Regents authority to appoint an Assistant Secretary In the depart- 
ment of natural history to take charge of the Museum, and to aid in the 
publication and other interests of the establishment. A resolution 
authorizing such an appointment being adopted, Henry selected Pro- 
fessor Baird, of Dickinson College, as the one well fitted for the place.

722 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 

The appoiutment was uuauimously coutirined by the Board July 5, 
1850, autl Professor Baird being notified, at ouce accepted and entered 
upon his new duties. He deposited in the Museum his own valuable 
collections, comprising an extensive series of the skins of various 
mammals (European as well as American), a large number of bird skins 
(unmounted), representing about live hundred American species and 
half as many European species, a rich variety of birds' nests and birds' 
eggs, more than five hundred glass jars, tin vessels, and kegs contain- 
ing alcoholic specimens of reptiles and tishes, and a number of verte- 
brate skeletons and of fossil remains. 

The new Assistant Secretary was truly in his element, and showed 
himself pre eminently " the right man in the right place." In Henry's 
Fourth Annual Report (that for J 850), after recording the appointment 
of his Assistant, he adds : " He entered on his duties in July last and, 
besides being actively engaged in organizing the department of natural 
history, he has rendered important service in conducting our foreign 
exchanges and attending to the business of the press." 

The Smithsonian system of exchanges was instituted for the purpose 
of facilitating the reciprocal transmission between the Old World and 
the New of the memoirs of learned socities, and this system has become 
an essential agency in the interchange and diffusion of knowledge, and 
in the more rapid advancement ot scientific discovery, by a Avider and 
l)rompter co-operation. Previous to this inauguration such distant 
scientific information was so rarely and inconveniently accessible 
largely through the dehiys and harassments of customs exactions, that 
important principles had not unfrequently been rediscovered abroad 
or at home, and sometimes with a considerable interval of time, to 
subsequently disturb and dispute a coveted and settled priority. 

By the urgent zeal of the Smithsonian Director, representing to foreign 
powers that only gratuitous distribution of the literary and scientific 
memoirs of societies or of individuals (not usually found on sale) was un- 
dertaken by the Institution, and that no commercial enterprise calcu- 
lated in any way to interfere with the legitimate operations of trade was 
attempted, one port after another was opened to its packages, until in 
the course of a few years, the announcement was made that the Smith- 
sonian exchanges were allowed to pass through every custom-house on 
earth, unopened and unquestioned. 

Creditable as this special liberality is, it has not yet, unfortunately, 
been applied to the customary channels of book lore, and the quest for 
knowledge is still held by a majority of civilized nations as an indulgence 
very proper to be taxed. Our own legislators have also made our higher 
education a source of revenue; possibly with a view to the "incidental 
protection" of American science by the heavy tariff laid on the foreign 
and imported article. 

The advantage to the cause of science from this Smithsonian system 
of international exchange of intellectual products, free of duty, and with 



SPENCER F. BAIKD. 723 

the freight expeuses assumed by the Institution, cim scarcely be too 
highly appreciated. In the early promotion of this beneticent scheme, 
Professor Baird became an energetic agent and sympathetic coadjutor 
of the Smithsonian Secretary. The remarkable developmentof thisserv- 
ice may be sufficiently indicated by a glance at the amount of material 
Iransmitted through this Institution, on each tenth year for thirty years, 
showing something like a geometrical ratio of increase. The total weight 
of books, pamphlets, and charts distributed in 1855 was about 6 tons; in 
18fi5, about tons; in 1875, about 20 tons; and in 1S85, about 85 tons. 
With the rapid growth of the exchange operatiojis, the active and com- 
prehensive faculties of Professor Baird seemed but to find a better field 
of exercise. 

At the same time, the accumulating collections of the Museum— in- 
creased iu 1858 by the transfer from the Patent Office to the Smithson- 
ian Building of the interesting contributions from the earlier national 
exploring expeditions — demanded a large share of attention for their 
proper arrangement, exposition, and superintendence.* To say that 
this important work of organization was zealously and judiciously car- 
ried out, is to characterize but imperfectly the directive skill and energy 
of the Museum curator. 

Of Professor Baird's work in original biologic research, of his contri- 
butions to various scientific journals and society proceedings, of his 
English translation of the popular '' Icouographic Encyclopimdia," of his 
editorship ot the '"Annual Record of Science and Industry" for eight 
years, and of his other publications, it is not proposed here to speak. 
This aspect of his intellectual life will be discussed by one in every re- 
spect far more competent to a just and discriminating presentation of 
the theme. The present remarks will be confined to a cursory review of 
Professor Baird's varied administrative work. 

For a number of years a notable decline in the productiveness of our 
extended fisheries had been with anxiety observed; the annual yield of 
this important element of our food supplj^ having in many cases fallen 
ofl one-half of its amount a quarter of a century earlier. So serious a 
diminution and consequent enhancement of cost of subsistence was be- 
coming a menacing problem. Were our leading food fishes undergoing 
a process of slow but certain extinction "? Several of the States (espe- 
cially those of New England) appointed commissions of inquiry into the 
causes and remedies of the threatening evil but with little result. 

In the stern competitive struggle that from the dawn of terrestrial 
pahieontogeny has been ordained by nature as the feudal tenure of all 
existence, and from which service man himself is not exempted, the 
feebleness of early youth in the individuals of every race would speedily

terminate the biology of ourplauet were uot provisious made for bridg- 
ing over these cross lines of weakness to preserve the continuity of 
species. In the lower classes of being we find the crude expedient of a 
fertility so enormous as to allow of the wholesale destruction of the un- 
protected eggs or of their brood, and yet leave a remnant to spare for 
the chances of reaching adult age. In numerous other classes a mar- 
velous sagacity is displayed by the mother in depositing her eggs where 
they will be least exposed to accident or voracious attack, and where 
the progeny (that she shall never see) will meet with their appropriate 
sustenance. In insects this peculiar instinct — so difficult of explanation 
as " inherited experience" — is perhaps most strikingly displayed. And 
lastly, when we ascend to the higher classes of birds and mammals we 
find the parental sentiment developed to an untiring vigilance for the 
protection, and provident care for the nutrition, of the new generation 
until it is able to take up for itself the battle of life. 

As an illustration of the reckless prodigality of productiveness in 
some of the lower families of the vertebrate branch it may be recalled 
that a single salmon will lay five thousand eggs; a trout, fifteen thou- 
sand eggs; a perch, a herring, or a shad, thirty thousand eggs; a 
pike, one hundred thousand eggs; a carp, four hundred thousand 
eggs; a mackerel five hundred thousand eggs; a flounder, one million 
eggs; a haddock, one million and a half of eggs; a halibut, two and a 
half millions of eggs; a pollock, four million eggs; a codfish of mediuju 
size, five million eggs; a large-sized cod, eight million eggs, and a tur- 
bot, nine million eggs. Such numbers are simply astounding; they 
can not be realized. And how great the marvel Avhen we consider that 
each of these nine million units is a potential fish, capable of develop- 
ment into all the perfected attributes and functions of the parent form! 
Among the lower invertebrates may be simply instanced the oyster — 
capable of producing the incredible number of twenty or thirty million 
eggs, and if of large size as many as forty or fifty million eggs. 

If with this amazing fertility the various kinds of fish just named 
are not rapidly increasing, but are stationary or even decreasing in 
numbers, how overwhelming must be their early destruction. Even 
after allowing for the many millions of adult fish taken by man, it is 
obvious that of many species not one in a thousand or in ten thousand 
of eggs or of the newly hatched can survive to maturity. Professor 
Mobius estimates that for every grown oyster upon the beds of Schles- 
wig-Holstein more than a million have died. 

To avert, if possible, the menace of increasing scarcity of fish supply 
the attention of Congress was directed to the subject ; the more prop- 
erly since in our National Government resided the jurisdiction over our 
extended sea-coasts. By a joint resolution, approved February 9, 1871, 
the President was authorized and required to appoint a person of 
proved scientific and practical acquaintance with the fishes of the coast 
to be Commissioner of Fishes aud Fisheries^ with the duty to prosecute 



SPENCER F. BAIRD. 725 

investigations into tbc causes of (liniiiiiition, if any, in nnnil)ers of the 
food-fishes of the coast and the hikes of the United States, and to re- 
l)ort whether any and wliat protective, prohibitory, or precautionary 
measures shoukl be adopted in the premises. 

No man more suitable for this important and responsible position 
than Professor Baird could have been selected. He was at once 
appointed b^- President Grant and confirmed by the Senate as the 
Commissioner, In his first report he announced, as the result of a 
most careful and thorough examination, that the decrease ot the shore 
fishes of the New England waters during the preceding twenty years 
was fully substantiated, and that it had been much more rapid since the 
year 1865. 

In furtherance of his great work the resources of the Smithsonian 
Institution were freely i)laced at the disposal of the Commissioner, 
and in the same report he gratefully acknowledges this hearty co- 
operation by saying : " 1 am indebted to Professor Henry for permis- 
sion to use the extensive collection of apparatus belonging to the 
Smithsonian Institution in the way of nets, dredges, tanks, etc., and 
thus saving the considerable outlay which would otherwise have been 
necessary." 

The new studies into the life-history of the principal shore fishes, 
into the character and range of their enemies, and into their approjiri- 
ate means of subsistence, requisite to an intelligent consideration of 
the conditions most favorable to their propagation, — involved investi- 
gations embracing the entire marine fauna of the coast, vertebrate and 
invertebrate. These extensive and varied researches necessarily de- 
manded the aid of skilled assistants, — of a corps of eminent specialists 
in marine biology, and a corresponding division of labor. 

The results of these investigations have been given to the world in 
hundreds of memoirs, published in the reports and bulletins of the 
Commission, and in the proceedings and bulletins of the National 
Museum. And it is quite within bounds to say that in importance, in 
variety, and in extent of original information thus communicated no 
such quantity of contribution to our knowledge of zoology has ever 
emanated from any other organization within the same interval of 
time. Many species of fishes entirely new to science have been dis- 
covered and carefully described, and the number of invertebrate forms 
known to inhabit the waters explored has probably been fully doubled. 

It^was shown, from the abundance of the lower forms of life, that the 
decline of the useful fishes had not resulted from any lack of their ac- 
customed food supply, nor had it resulted apparently from any less 
favorable conditions of environment, nor from the prevalence of any 
epidemic diseases. It was therefore a consequence of excess in their 
destruction. 

Among all the ravages of predaceous fishes it was found that the 
"bluefish" was the most voracious and devastating pirate of the 



726 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 

coast. Iti the report it is stated : " Sometimes among a school of 
herriug or menhaden, thousands of bluetish will be seen biting off 
the tail of one and then another, destroying ten times as many fish as 
they really need for food, and leaving in their track the surface of the 
water covered with the blood and fragments of the mangled fish." 
Fortunately this fish is itselt valuable for food, and it is accordingly 
taken in large numbers.* 

But by far the most rapacious and destructive scourge of the waters 
is man himself. By reckless extravagance in his methods of capture 
he would soon consume the capital of his abundant patrimony, were no 
restraints imposed upon the thoughtless improvidence of his greed. 
With the growth of population and demand, and the improved facilities 
for rapid transportation, the stimulus to inventive ingenuity occasioned 
the establishing of fish-traps and fish-pounds on a large scale that gath- 
ered thousands in their confines, with little regard to the probable sup- 
ply of the future. As these traps and pounds were placed directly in 
the way of the fish to their spawning-beds, it resulted that a very large 
proportion of spawn fishes were taken by them, thus greatly reducing 
the prospects of the succeeding generation. 

Whatever protective measures might be deemed expedient to check 
this spendthrift waste, it was seen that the most immediate and prom- 
ising work of the Commissioner would be to promote the ra.pid multi- 
plication of fish ; and to this dominant interest the annual appro- 
priations by Congress have been more and more largely directed. 

Pisciculture is by no means a recent art, it having been extensively 
practiced by the Chinese for a number of centuries : and even the arti- 
ficial fecundation of fish-spawn is nearly a century and a third old, 
having been apparently first introduced by Jacobi, a German, of West- 
Ijhalia. Most of the European nations had already given attention to 
the practical application of fish-culture, and in different parts of our 
own country enterprising individuals had undertaken the operation 
with gratifying results. 

Under the organizing direction of Professor Baird a careful study 
was made of existing methods, extended experiments on artificial propa- 
gation were conducted, and successive improvements in the various 
stages of incubation, hatching, and development introduced — each de- 
tail receiving a scientific treatment — until a scale of success has been 
effected far more complete and satisfactory than ever before attained. 
While under natural conditions but a small proportion of the spawn 
deposited is hatched (the greater mass being eagerly devoured by 
various aquatic tribes), and of the portion hatched but a small per- 
centage escapes to reach maturity, under the careful breeding of art 
fully ninety per cent, of all the eggs secured are fertilized and success- 
fully developed. 

*In his first i-eport, Professor Baird says: " I am myself cognizant of the capture 
of uo less than 20,000 bluefish, representing a weight of at least 100,000 ponmls, iu one 
weir iu the course of a single night." 



SPENCER F. BAIRD. 727 

Of the practical results of this great national enterprise it is unnec- 
essary to speak. A dozen varieties of our best food-ftsbes bave been 
disseminated tbroughout tbe inland waters and tbe sea-board of our 
country in increasing quantifies; Iransported in tbe form of tbe youug 
fry or in tbat of fertilized eggs to otber liatcbing stations; and while 
an accurate estimate is, perhaps, at present not easily attainable, it will 
hardly be held an exaggeration to say tbat these productions are to be 
numbered by thousands of millions. Of these, many millions (by a 
most praiseworthy public courtesy) have been distributed to foreign 
countries — to Australia, to Brazil, to Canada, to England, to France, 
to Germany, to Mexico, to The Netherlands, to Scotland, and to Switz- 
erland. 

In the great International Fisheries Exhibition at Berlin in 1880 our 
national commission was authorized by Congress to participate. Pro- 
fessor Baird appointed as his deputy to personally superintend this 
movement Professor Goode, the present Fish Commissioner, under 
whose energetic direction, in a remarkably short space of time, the 
marvellous American exhibit was organized, transported, and installed, 
to the wonder and admiration of every visitor. The head of the Amer- 
ican Commission was hailed by the President of.the German Fisheries 
Association as the "chief tish-culturist in the world," and to hiui was 
awarded for the most complete and imposing display of all the details 
and accessories of his scientific art the unique first-honor prize of the 
exhibition, the gift of the Emperor of Germany. 

But time fails to permit more than a passing glance at other fields of 
activity no less important in which Professor Baird employed his re- 
markable powers of executive management. The Smithsonian Insti- 
tution from its inception had given great encouragement to ex- 
plorations, and its director had zealously labored to enlist, as far as 
practicable, the various expeditions undertaken by the Government, 
in the extension of scientific research. These efforts were liber- 
ally- responded to by the Executive Departments, and traiued ex- 
perimentalists and observers were given every facility for physical, 
physiographical, and biological investigations at distant points. The 
Institution thus became almost the Government superintendent of 
scientific expeditious. In all that pertained to ethnology and natural 
history Professor Baird became, of course, the leading spirit, and the 
various circulars of direction and inquiry issued by him show with 
what range and thoroughness he supervised this wide department, 
while the resulting memoirs and valuable museum accessions attest as 
their fruits the practical wisdom of the measures and methods adopted. 

Congress having made provision for the representation by the Gov- 
ernment in the National Centennial Exhibition to be held at Phila- 
delphia, tbe President of the United States requested the Executive 
Departments, together with the Smithsonian Institution, to co-operate 
in a collection illustrative of our progress and resources. In his report

of 1875, Professor Baird formulated (as requested by Professor Henry) 
bis phiMS for tbe different details of tbe projected exbibit, and tbese 
being adopted were carried out to a result tliat made the Smithsonian 
display the leading- attraction of the extensive Government building. 

At the death of Professor Henry, in 1878, his faithful assistant and 
coadjutor was elected by the Regents as his successor, and his long 
familiarity with the different lines of active operations pursued by the 
lustitution, made him from the start an efficient director. Another 
grave respcfnsibility was thus thrown entirely upon his shoulders, and 
he proved himself equal to tbe occasion. 

In 1879, Congress made an appropriation (since continued annually) 
for the prosecution of North American ethnology, to be expended under 
the direction of the Smithsonian Institution. For the administration 
of this important trust, Professor Baird selected one whom he knew to 
be peculiarly fitted by training, by zeal, and by congenial tastes, to 
pursue successfully the anthropologic study of our waning aborigines, 
and the new Bureau of Ethnology was judiciously committed to the 
control of the distinguished Director of the Geological Survey, Major 
Powell. 

In the same year (that following Henry's death) an appropriation 
(for many years importunately besought of (Jongress) was made for 
the erection of a national museum building. In 1882 the completion of 
this building rendered necessary the re-organization of the Museum, 
with a staff" of expert curators, on a scale commensurate with its im- 
portance and the abundance of its previously stored material. 

Professor Baird had now become the manager of three great estab- 
lishments f — the Fisheries Commission, the Smithsonian Institution, and 
the National Museum ; either one of which was a charge sufficient to 
fully task the energies of a vigorous man. No wonder, with the strain 
of unremitted though divided attention to these exacting duties, that 
while unconscious himself of any unaccustomed or undue exertions, he 
should find even his robust and stalwart strength was slowly failing 
under his accumulated labors. 

Informed by his medical adviser that an entire and continued rest 
from all intellectual exertion was necessary to restore his nervous 
energies to their wonted tone, he reluctantly accepted the decision. 
A year ago he asked from the Smithsonian Regents authority to ap- 
point two official assistants to relieve him from the greater portion of 
his responsibility, and in hearty compliance with his expressed desire, 
the eminent astronomer and physicist, Professor Langiey, was ap- 
pointed assistant in charge of the Smithsonian operations, and his 
well-tried friend and collaborator, Professor Goode, was appointed 
assistant in charge of the Museum affairs. 

But the relaxation came too late. After a vigorous resistance of 
his strong constitution to the encroachments of internal organic de- 
rangements, he finally succumbed to the Destroyer, and quietly

breathed liis last ou the IDtli of August, 1887; another example (far 
more fre(iiient in the higlier than in the lower fields of occupation) of 
sacrifice to over-work. 

From even this hurried and imperfect sketch of Professor Baird's 
diversified administrative work it is at once apparent that he i)os- 
sessed, in a pre-eminent degree, two great capacities; — the faculty for 
successful organization, and the faculty for continuous labor. As 
a biologist he had made a study of the entire range of organic nature — 
vegetable and animal ; and with the accuracy of the specialist, he com- 
bined the larger and fuller perception of the general zoologist as to the 
functional and genetic inter-relations of animated being. The tenor of 
his mind was rather synthetic than analytic. While he ever displayed 
a marvellous memory for particulars, and a comprehensive grasp of 
details, these were apprehended more as the constituents of a general 
end or purpose, than as the residuals of a disjunctive conception. 
Clear-sighted and determined, he prevised and compassed the result 
in the means. Simple and unostentatious, he received with ready 
affability a visitor, even when most preoccupied. What young 
naturalist ever applied to him for the resolution of a diflticulty or un- 
certainty without receiving cordial attention and satisfactory enlight- 
enment f 

Great as were his undoubted services in the original discovery of 
biologic truths, it may well be doubted whether his indirect influence 
in the advancement of science, was not still greater, by the assistance 
and encouragement given to others and by his numerous official occa- 
sions of directing the efforts of the aspiring into channels of novel 
exploration, whenever the opportunities of land or naval expeditions 
presented themselves. 

Now that the first shock of bereavement at missing one who has 
occupied a prominent place in the public eye, as well as in our private 
regard, has somewhat subsided, we but the more clearly realize that in 
the lamented death of Spencer F. Baird the scientific world has lost an 
accomplished and illustrious naturalist, the institutions over which he 
presided an energetic and judicious administrator, and we, assembled 
here, an exalted associate, a faithful counsellor, an ever open-hearted 
friend. 



PROFESSOR BAIRD IN SCIENCE. 



By Mr. Wm. H. Dall, President of the Biological Society. 



Ill accepting tbe honor of addressing you this evening on the biolog- 
ical work of Prof. Spencer F. Baird it is hardly necessary to state that 
I have felt keenly' the inadequacy of my own equipment for the task. 
Not only does it happen that my own work has been almost entirely in 
departments of biology different from those which he adorned, but my 
early efforts were fostered by his wisdom and geniality, the period of 
my scientific studies has coincided with an acquaintance which ripened 
into affection and admiration, they have depended for their results upon 
opportunities largely due to the intervention, of Professor Baird, and I 
feel that the best and truest of him is that which can not be put in 
words. The sense of personal loss, as with many of you, is still so 
keen as to accentuate the difiBculty of doing justice to the theme 
assigned me. 

I should have almost despaired of myself on this occasion were it not 
that others have aided me in my endeavor to set forth the debt owed 
b}'^ the various departments of research to Professor Baird's original 
investigations. To naturalists so distinguished in their specialties 
as Ridgway, Stejneger, Goode, Coues, Allen, Merriam, and Yarrow, I 
am indebted either for direct contributions toward the substance of this 
address or for matter in their published works which has been simi- 
larly utilized. 

Professor Baird's scientific activity was exhibited in three principal 
directions : First, in original investigation of the zoology of vertebrates ; 
second, in the diffusion of scientific knowledge and methods through 
official documents, reports, cyclopedias, and records of progress ; and 
lastly, in the organization and administration of scientific agencies such 
as the National Museum or the Fish Commission, which include in their 
scope not merely public education or economic applications of science, 
but the promotion of research. Behind all these and hardly less im- 
l)ortant for science was the personal influence of the man himself, which 
shone through all the planes of his activity as coruscations light the 
facets of a gem. 

Although it is very difficult to separate the phases of his work, one 
from another, so closely were they interrelated, m^^ theme to-night is 

731 



732 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 

restricted to the impress left upon zoologiciil scMence by Baird's original 
investigations. So great has been his rei)utation as an organizer, so 
numerous have been the publications in which he has garnered for the 
public the precious grain of the annual scientific harvest, that the extent 
and ijijportance of his original work, except by specialists, is in danger 
of being overlooked. 

We owe an excellent bibliography of his publications to Professor 
Goode. From this we learn that, up to the end of 1882, the list com- 
prises nearly eleven hundred titles, from which, after deduction of all 
notices, reviews, official reports, and works edited for others, some two 
hundred formal contributions to scientific literature remain, many of 
which are works of monographic character and extensive scope. 

With the exception of a single early botanical paper these relate to 
the vertebrates of America and, in their several branches, cover nearly 
the entire field. Although descriptions of species in themselves afford 
a poor criterion of the value of the work containing them, it is inter- 
esting to note that, among the terrestrial vertebrates, the proportion of 
the fauna first made known by Baird to the total number recognized at 
the time as North American varied from twenty-two iier cent, of the 
whole to forty per cent, in different groups. 

His method of study of new material was as far removed as possible 
from bookishness. In the case of the collections from Hudson Bay or the 
Pacific Railroad Surveys, when birds, mammals, or reptiles sometimes 
came to hand by hundreds, each specimen having the collector's data 
attached, the whole collection was thrown together, each form to be 
sorted out on its merits and studied in the light of a multitude of spec- 
imens. 

Professor Baird's early life had included so much of exercise in the 
shape of long pedestrian journeys with gun and gamebag, so much 
familiarity with the wood-life of his favorite birds and mammals, that 
it would have been in any case impossible to class him with the closet- 
naturalist, while to this knowledge he added a genius for thorough, 
patient, and exhaustive research into all which concerned the subject of 
his study, and a wonderful inventiveness in labor-saving devices for 
labeling, museum work, and registration. 

He had a wonderful capacity for work. He undertook and carried 
out successfully tasks which it would seem nobody else would have 
dared to attempt, or, attempting, would have been physically unable to 
complete. In the case of the immense volume on the mammals, of the 
Pacific Railroad Surveys, he says in the preface, July 20, 1857: 

The examination of the material was actually commenced early in 
1855 and many of the articles written in that year or 1856. With the 
continual accession of additional specimens it became finally necessary 
to rewrite, alter, or extend all that had been prepared prior to the 
present year (1857). It is to this that the frequent want of uniformity 
is due, the time allowed not being sufficient in many cases to permit the 
reworking of the whole matter. - - - It is, perhaps, unnecessary 
to state that the matter of the present report is entirely original through-

out. - - - It is proper to state, that owing to various cireum- 
stauces, the work was necessarily passed through the press with a 
rapidity probably unexampled in the history of natural-history printing, 
allowing very little opportunity for that critical and leisurely examina- 
tion so necessary in correcting a work of the kind. For most of the 
time the proof has been furnished and read at the rate of twenty-four 
to thirty-two pages i)er day, nearly 400 i)ages having been set up, read, 
and printed during the tirst half of July alone. Owing to the urgent 
necessity for the speedy completion of the volume, no time was allowed 
for the revision of the manuscript as a co rplete work, nor, indeed, of 
its separate portions, and, for much of the time, the preparation of 
much of the manuscript was only a few hours in advance of its delivery 
to the compositor. 

The volume above referred to contains over 800 quarto pages and 42 
plates. The manuscript was entirely prepared after 6 o'clock of work- 
ing days which had been spent in the active administrative and execu- 
tive work of the Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 
then unassisted by stenographer or other clerical supplement. Fortu- 
nately for science Baird did not always have to work under such cir- 
cumstances, but the incident shows what he was capable of doing when 
the occasion seemed to him to warrant it. Probably no other work of 
equal importance, on any subject, was ever carried out under such 
pressure. 

Mammals. — Professor Baird's contributions to a knowledge of North 
American mammals, though less voluminous than those relating to 
birds, are not less important. Previous to this time but one general 
work on the subject had been published, that of Audubon and Bach- 
man on the Quadrupeds of North America, which was issued in three 
volumes, from 1846 to 1854.* Immediately after the completion of this 
great work collections began to pour into the Smithsonian Institution 
from the various exploring i^arties of the Pacific Railway surveys. 
This material comprised so large a number of new species, and cast so 
much light upon many previously doubtful points concerning the rela- 
tions of species already described, that a revision of the whole subject 
became necessary. Hence Professor Baird at once set about the prep- 
aration of the book commonly known as the Mammals of North Amer- 
ica. I have already alluded to the manner in which it was prepared. 
This great work was rapidly pushed to completion and appeared in 
1857, just three years after the publication of the last volume of Audu- 
bon and Bachman's Quadrupeds. It constitutes the eighth volume of 
the Pacific Railroad Reports, and is a iiouderous quarto of more than 
800 pages, accompanied by numerous excellent plates. 

Though published thirty years ago, this work still remains the stand- 
ard general treatise on North American mammals. It contains no bio- 
graphical matter, but consists wholly of technical descriptions. It 
treats of all the mammals then known from the continent of North 

*The vohime on Mammals of Richardson's Fauna Boreali Americana does not fall 
under this head, because it treats only of the northern portion of the continent, 



734 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 

America north of Mexico, except the bats and the truly pelagic forms — 
whales, sea-cows, and seals. The total number of known species was 
increased nearly twenty-five per cent. 

In fullness of synonymy, and in the correct assignment of species pre- 
viously described, Professor Baird was much in advance of previous 
workers. The descriptions, which are models of painstaking accuracy 
and precision, are taken from the specimens themselves, and are accom- 
panied by long tables of measurements, the value of which more than 
justifies the enormous expenditure of time necessary in their prepara- 
tion. Much more attention was paid to craniological characters than 
had been the custom with previous writers, which fact contributes 
largely to the permanent value of the work. 

Professor Baird's loog training as a careful observer, his power of 
concentrating his knowledge of matters under investigation, the 
wide scope of his information on nearly all departments of natural 
science, his clear perception of details, together with his excellent 
judgment, which was as marked in matters of minor detail as in those 
requiring great executive ability, enabled him to draw conclusions 
which subsequent accumulations of material have verified in a sur- 
prising manner; in fact, his pre-eminent superiority as a systematic 
zoologist is everywhere apparent. 

Birds. — When the great interest he took in birds is considered, and 
the long period over which his studies extended, it is somewhat sur- 
prising to find that the number of separate papers on ornithology pub- 
lished by Professor Baird sums up only some seventy-nine titles. It 
is less to their number that he owed his fame as an ornithologist than 
to their quality, combined with the fact that several of these publica- 
tions covered practically the entire field of North American ornithol- 
ogy, and were of the nature of monographs. 

"His reputation was, indeed, established," says Ridgway, "by the 
first of his separate works, usually known and quoted as the "Birds of 
North America," though not published under this title until two years 
after it had been i^rinted by the Government as Volume IX of the 
Pacific Railroad Reports. With the publication of this great quarto 
volume, containing more than a thousand pages, in 1868, began what 
has been fitly termed by Dr. Elliott Coues the " Bairdian period " of 
American ornithology. This period, covering almost thirty years, was 
characterized by an activity in ornithological research aud a rapidity 
of advancement without a parallel in the history of the science. 

Of the "Birds of North America" Coues states* that "it represents 
the most important single step ever taken in the progress of American 
ornithology in all that relates to the technicalities." The nomenclature 
was entirely remodeled from that previously in current use, and for the 
first time was brought abreast of the systematic acquirements of the 
time. The synonymy of the work, in which is embodied the history of

investigation relating to each species, is more extensive, reliable, and 
elaborate than any before presented. With few exceptions, citations 
were original, and when, as occasionally happened, they were neces- 
sarily at second-hand the fact was always indicated. The text com- 
prised not only diagnoses and descriptions of each species, but extended 
and elaborate commentary, comparisons, and criticisms. 

In this learned and sagacious work Professor Baird was aided by 
Cassin and Lawrence, two of the leading ornithologists of America. It 
exerted an influence perhaps strongly and more widely felt than any of its 
predecessors, Audubon and Wilson not excepted, and marked an epoch 
in the history of American ornithology. The data original to and em- 
bodied in this work have been used again and again by subse(pient 
writers with various modifications. Such a monument of original re- 
search is likely to remain for an indefinite period a source of inspira- 
tion to other writers, while its authority as a work of reference will al- 
ways endure. 

The publication of this work rendered possible the studies and prog- 
ress of a large number of persons, who without it would hardly have 
been able to enter the domain of scientific ornithology, but who, aided 
by the book as a standard of reference and by the genial correspond- 
ence and pregnant suggestions of its author, have made reputations of 
more or less distinction for valuable and permanent original investiga- 
tion. The number of those who profited by this stimulation has been 
very large, and in this way arose what has been called* the Baird- 
ian School of Ornithologists, a school characterized by exactitude 
in matters of fact, conciseness in deductive statement, and care- 
ful analysis of the su))ject in all its various bearings. Its work 
is marked by a careful separation of the data from the conclusions de- 
rived from them, so that conclusions or arguments can be traced back 
to their sources and duly weighed, while the writings of the older 
European school afford little basis for analysis. In substance, accord- 
ing to Dr. btejneger, the European method required an investigator to 
accept an author's statements and conclusions on his jiersonal respon- 
sibility alone, while the method originated by Baird furnishes him with 
tangible facts from which to make his deductions. 

These distinctive features were still further developed by the publi- 
cation in 1804-'GG of the "Review of American Birds," a work of un- 
equaled merit, displaying in their perfection Professor Baird's wonder- 
ful powers of analysis and synthesis, so strongly combined in his treat- 
ment of difl&cult problems. Although never completed, this work has 
received unstinted praise from all competent to estimate it. It is said 
on excellent authority that no other single work on American birds has 
made so profound an impression on foreign ornithologists, notwith- 
standing the fact that circumstances prevented it from being made 
complete.

736 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 

Although in his systematic work Professor Baird, like other natural- 
ists, built partly on the scientific foundations laid by his predecessors 
and contemporaries, always with due acknowledgment, the high value 
of his work in this direction was largely due to an unerriug instinct 
which enabled him to recognize and confirm the best features of the 
work of others and by adding material from his own lines of original 
research to combine the whole into a fabric which was a distinct ad- 
vance on anything previously offered to the scientific world. 

While the bent of his genius led him, in this as in other departments, 
to devote a main proportion of his work to the systematic biology which 
was the need of the time, and which, with the exploration and descrip- 
tion upon which it is based, must always precede and lay the track for 
the theoretical biology jnore in vogue to-day, it must not be supposed 
that the work of Baird was confined to descriptive and systematic work. 
With the latter in his publications are combined a host of biographical 
data such as the field naturalist revels in. One of the earliest and most 
pregnant papers bearing on mutations of specific forms which have been 
contributed to the literature of evolution by American biologists is to 
be found in his article on the " Distribution and Migrations of North 
American Birds" published in the American Journal of Science in 18{>6.* 
In this paper, an abstract of a memoir presented to the National 
Academy of Sciences in 1865, are to be found the germs of much of the 
admirable work which has since been elaborated by other biologists on 
the correlation of geographical distribution and the peculiarities of the 
environment, with the modifications of color, size, and structure in the 
forms of animal life, called species. 

Unlike some of his contemporaries twenty years ago, the views of 
Darwin excited in him no reaction of mind against the hypotheses then 
novel and revolutionary. His friendly reception of the new theories 
was so quiet and undisturbed that, to a novice seeking his advice and 
opinion amid the clatter of contending voices, it seemed almost as if 
the main features of the scientific gospel of the new era had existed 
in the mind of Baird from the very beginning. His thorough appren- 
ticeship in the study of details of structure and their expression in sys- 
tematic classification, as well as his cautious and judicial habit of mind, 
prevented him, notwithstanding his hearty recognition of evolutionary 
processes, from falling into those exuberancies of utterance and hypoth- 
esis characteristic of narrowness and immaturity which, within the 
memory of most of us, have enjoyed a sort of vogue now happily on the 
decline. 

Batrachians and Serpents. — Professor Baird's contributions to herpe- 
tology began as early as 1849, his first paper being a revision of the 
North American tailed batrachians which appeared in the Journal of 
the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Excluding notices 
of the work of others in the Annual Kecord between 18-49 and 1880, he

SPENCER F. BAIRD. 737 

published fourteen papers on this branch of science beside nine of which 
he was the joint autlior with Charles Girard. His activity in original 
work in this, as in some other directions, came to an end with the as- 
sumption of the burden of administrative work required by the organ- 
ization and development of the Fish Commission. 

Many of his herpetological papers were elaborate studies. One of 
the most important of the early memoirs was that on the reptiles of 
Stansbury's expedition to the valley of the Great Salt Lake, and another, 
that on those collected by the United States exploring expedition un- 
der Wilkes. The catalogue of North American Eeptiles in the collec- 
tion of the Smithsonian Institution is a classical work, serving to the 
present day as a text-book for students of herpetology. In 1859 ap- 
peared his great study of the reptiles collected by the parties engaged 
in the explorations for a Pacific Railroad, a monument of patient re- 
search and discriminating analysis. After this his contributions to 
the subject were mostly short papers or announcements of new or inter- 
esting facts. 

At the time Professor Baird began his studies of the amphibia 
little had been done for herpetology in America. The classical work 
of Holbrook contained little more than descriptions of Southern species, 
and the work of Dumeril and Bibron was equally meager. Immense 
collections were placed in Baird's hands from the Western plains, and 
the work upon these was necessarily in great part original. How well 
this work was done is shown by the fact that, in spite of the changes 
which are constant in zoological classification, nearly all the species 
still retain the names he applied to them. The descriptions were so 
carefully prepared that later students have never been troubled in 
making their identifications. 

Notwithstanding his multifarious duties in later years, Professor 
Baird never lost his interest in these animals, and up to the last af- 
forded every aid and encouragement to those studying them. Much 
of the work done in this country by such herpetologists as Girard, 
Kennicott, Hallowell, Cope, and others, found in his example and en- 
couragement the stimulus which made it possible, was built on the 
foundations which he laid, and owes its publication to agencies which 
he promoted or controlled. 

Fishes. Professor Baird's contributions to ichthyological literature 
number some fourteen or fifteen papers, chiefly of a descriptive charac- 
ter, embodying the results of original research into the ichthyology of 
western and southwestern America and of the marine fishes of New 
Jersey and New York. Most of these papers were published jointly 
with Charles Girard. 

Besides these, however, he added more than four hundred titles to 

the list of reviews, notices, reports, translations, and official documents 

relating to economic ichthyology, lish culture, and the general progress 

of the science. In this way he was instrumental in bringing together 

H. Mis. 14J 47

for the use aud benefit of the English-speaking public the largest body 
of facts relating to fish and fisheries ever prepared and digested for 
such purposes by any individual or organization. Recognized by ex- 
perts of foreign countries with oue accord, as the most eminent living 
authority on economic ichthyology, America owes to his fostering care 
and unwearied labor the existence of a whole generation of ichthyolo- 
gists, breeders of fishes, and inventors of appliances of all sorts for use 
in connection with the taking, preservation, and increase of these ani- 
mals. So thoroughly is this understood by all who are in any way 
acquainted with American fish aud fisheries, that to them this state- 
ment will appear a truism. 

It does not enter into the purpose of this address to enumerate the 
economic results of the Commission which grew into such stately pro- 
portions under his skillful and progressive leadership, nor yet to 
enumerate the multitudinous researches in pure as well as economic 
biology for which this organization has furnished material and means. 
No more emphatic object-lesson of the vital relations existing between 
research, as such, and the promotion of the material interests of man- 
kind has ever been furnished to the so-called "practical man" than 
that afforded by the work of the (Juited States Fish Commission as 
directed by Professor Baird. 

Whether germane to the subject of scientific research or not, the 
most narrow specialist can hardly grudge an allusion to the grandeur 
of the methods by which the food supply of a nation was provided, 
hundreds of rivers stocked with fish, and the very depths of ocean 
re-populated. Typically American we may call them in their audacity 
aud their success. The fishery boards of foreign countries, first quietly 
indifferent, then loudly incredulous, in due time became interested 
inquirers aud enthusiastic followers. In a few years we may fairly 
expect to see the food supply of the entire civilized world materially 
increased, with all the benefits which that implies, aud this result will 
in the main be owing to the unremunerated and devoted exertions of 
Spencer F. Baird. 



THE PERSOi^^AL CHARACTERISTICS OF PROFESSOR BAIRD. 



By J. W. Powell, President of the Anthropological Society. 



Baird was one of the learned men of the world, and, to a degree per- 
haps unexampled in histon , he was the discoverer of the knowledge he 
possessed. He knew the birds of the air, from the ptarmigan that lives 
among everlasting snows to the humming-bird tliat revels among the 
orchids of the tropics ; he knew the beasts of the forests and the prai- 
ries, and the reptiles that crawl through desert sands or slimy marshes; 
he knew the fishes that scale mountain torrents, that bask in quiet 
lakes, or that journey from zone to zone through the deep waters of the 
sea. In all this realm of nature he had a minute and comprehensive 
knowledge that no other man has ever acquired. What others had 
recorded in this field of research he knew, and to their discoveries he 
made a contribution of his own so bounteous, so stupendous, that he is 
recognized as the master of systematic zoologists. 

All of Baird's scientific work is an illustration of modern inductive 
or scientific reasoning. The inductions or general principles of modern 
science are reached by the accumulation of vast stores of facts. He 
knew how to accumulate facts; how to reject the trivial and select the 
significant. Modern science is almost buried under the debris of obser- 
vation, the record of facts without meaning, the sands of fact that are 
ground from the rock of truth by the attrition of mind ; but Baird could 
walk over the sands and see the diamonds. Then he knew how to 
marshal significant facts into systems, and how to weld them into funda- 
mental principles. In all his works there can be discovered no taint of 
a priori reasoning or syllogistic logic ; for in his mind there was no 
room for controversy; and disputation fled before the light of his 
genius. Formal logic, a disease of modern thought, the contagion of 
Aristotleina, never ravaged his brain. With healthful directness, he 
sought the truth guided by wise inference, and told the truth in its 
simplicity.

740 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 

Baird was an organizer of the agencies of research. When a bold 
explorer essayed to penetrate the seas of ice by the path of peril and 
in qnest of fame, Baird would ever so manage that a corps of quiet 
scholars should be attached to the expedition to study the climate of 
the Arctic zone, the geology of the Arctic rocks, the flora of the Arctic 
lands, or the fauna of the Arctic fields ; and the best knowledge we 
have of the igloo-dwellers, the Eskimo whose home is on the ice of the 
North, has been brought to us by the quiet students he succeeded in 
attaching to Arctic exploring expeditions, and so the love of glory 
was made to serve the cause of truth. 

When, in the interests of international commerce, expeditions were 
sent to explore and survey routes of travel and transportation across 
Central America from sea to sea, he managed to send with them corps 
of scientific men whose function it was to bring from the tropics all 
forms of its abundant life, vegetal and animal, and the relics of the 
arts of the people of Central America as they are exhibited in stone 
and clay and gold ; and the National Museum has been enriched by 
the results of this labor, and the boundaries of human knowledge 
extended thereby, and so the greed of gain was made to serve the 
love of truth. 

When our Army was distributed on the frontiers of the land, he every- 
where enlisted our scholarly officers in the service of science and he 
transformed the military post into a station of research ; the Indian 
campaign into a scientific expedition. Scott, Marcy, McClellau, 
Thomas, and many other of the great generals of America were stu- 
dents of natural history and collectors for Baird. When our Navy 
cruised around our shores its officers were inspired with that love of 
nature which made every voyage of military duty a voyage of discov- 
ery in the realms of natural science ; when they journeyed among the 
islands of the sea they brought back stores of scientific materials, and 
when they sailed through the littoral waters of other continents they 
made voyages of scientific investigation. Many of these earlier 
naturalists of the Navy in subsequent times became commodores and 
admirals. 

But time would fail me to tell of the exploring expeditions and the 
railroad surveys throughout America, and the travels throughout the 
world, which he utilized in the interest of science, or of which he was 
the immediate projector. Of the abundant material thus gathered from 
all parts of the world, some has gone to enrich American institutions 
of learning, and some has been gathered into the National Museum, — 
an outgrowth of Baird's organizing genius and a splendid monument 
to his memory. 

The hills of the land stretch not so far as the billows of the sea ; 
the heights of the mountains are not so great as the depths of the 
ocean ; and so the world was unknown until this greater region was 
explored. The treasures of the land did not satisfy the desires of 



spknceu p. baird. 741 

Baird ; lie must also have tlie treasures of tln^ sea, and so he organized 
a lish eoniniission, with its great laboratories and vessels of research. 

What liid'st thou in the trcasurc-caves and colls, 
Thou hollow sounding and mysterious main ? 
Pale, glistening pearls and rainbow-colored shells, 
Bright things which gleam unreck'd of, and in vain. 
Keep, keep thy riches, melancholy sea! 
We ask not such from thee. 

What the scholar asked of the sea was all its forms of life, its organ- 
isms minute and lowly, its crawling articulates, its pearl-housed mol- 
lusks, its fishes that swim in armies, and its leviathans that prowl 
among the waves — the life of the reedy shore, the life of the ocean- 
current, and the life of the deep sea. Thus with many ingenious appli- 
ances, he and his lieutenants sailed away to explore the ocean's 
mystery. 

So the Fish Commission was an agency of research ; but it was more, — 
he made it an agency by which science is applied to the relief of the 
wants of mankind, — by which a cheap, nutritious, healthful, and luxur- 
ious food is to be given to the millions of men. He affirmed that for 
the production of food an acre of water is more than equal to 10 acres 
of land, thns giving to the gloomy doctrine of Malthus its ultimate refu- 
tation, and tearing away the veil of despair from the horizon of the 
poor ; for, when the sea shall serve man with all the food that can be 
gathered from its broad expanse, the laud can not contain the millions 
whom it is thus possible to supjily. 

In the research thus organized the materials for the work of other 
scientific men were gathered. When a great genius reads to the world 
a chai)ter from the book of nature the story is so beautiful that many 
are stimulated to search in the same field for other chapters of the same 
story. Thus it was that the publication of Baird's great works on 
natural history developed in America a great corps of naturalists, 
many of whom have become illustrious, and the stimulus of his work 
was felt throughout Europe. In the research which he organized the 
materials were furnished for this corps of naturalists ; but his agency 
in the development of this bod^'^ of workers was even more direct. He 
incited the men personally to undertake and continuously to prosecute 
their investigations. He enlisted the men himself, he trained them 
himself, he himself furnished them with the materials andinstrumentsof 
research, and best of all, he was their guide and great exemplar. Thus 
it was that the three institutions over which he presided, — the Smith- 
sonian Institution, the N"ational Museum, and the Fish Commission — 
were woven into one great organization, — a university of instruction in 
the methods of scientific research, including in its scope the entire field 
of biology and anthropology. Su(;h is Baird the investigator, Baird 
the organizer, and Baird the instructor, in the length breadth and 
height of his genius, the solidarity of a great man.

All that I have said is a part of the public record, found iu the 
great libraries of the world; but however exalted the feeling of ad- 
miration we may entertain for Baird as a scholar and administrator, 
it is to his attributes as a man, as disclosed in his personal relations 
with friends, associates, and men of affairs, that we most fondly turn. 
It is in these relations that he most clearly exhibited those kindly and 
modest traits of character which made him so universally beloved. 

As a man of affairs, Professor Baird exhibited great sagacity. His 
plans for the organization of scientific work were of great magnitude, 
and had they been presented to the administrative officers of the 
Government or to legislative bodies with exaggeration, or even had 
they been presented with the glow of an enthusiastic missionary of 
science, they might well have encountered opposition. But Baird had 
a wonderful faculty of presenting his plans with extreme modesty, 
and with a degree of uuder-statemeut, but suggestion of possibilities 
which speedily caused him to whom the appeal was made, himself to 
be jome an advocate of the Professor's measure. He had traits of char- 
acter in this respect which are hard to explain, and which seem at first 
to be contradictory. In the advocacy of measures his modesty amounted 
almost to timidity; he avoided alike argumentation and ostentation, 
and he presented his measures with the directness of a child. Not- 
withstanding all this, there was such a poise of faculties, such dig- 
nity of mien, that he impressed those with whom he came iu contact 
as a venerable and wise patriarch. He seemed devoid of personal in- 
terest or feeling, and solicitous only for the welfare of those to whom 
he was in fact appealing, and he conveyed the impression that he was 
giving benignant advice. Thus the shrinking, sensitive man, who 
could not even stand before a public body, such as a committee of Con- 
gress, or a scientific society, and advocate a cause, could from his seat 
by the fireside or at the desk, so illumine the subject with which he 
had to deal that men stood round him to gather his words, that noth- 
ing should be lost; for in the exposition of his subject he illumined 
everything with clear statement, arising from an exhaustive knowledge 
and full understanding of results. 

As the director of the work of research in which other men were en- 
gaged, Professor Baird had marvellous insight and skill. The appli- 
ances of modern research, alike iu the inorganic world and iu biology, 
hav^e come to be multifarious and diverse, and there is this peculiarity 
about them ; — once used, so that the secret of nature which they 
were planned to unlock has been revealed, they speedily become 
obsolete, and immediately new keys, new apparatus, new devices are 
necessary. Thus to a large extent skill in research is absorbed in the 
skill necessary for the development of the agencies of research. A 
continuous line of research, prosecuted by a corps of men so that the 
boundaries of knowledge are carried far forward, can result only from 
a continuous line of inventions in the apparatus of research, and it was 



SPENCER F. BAIRD. 743 

here that Baird exhibited his skill. His own devices were many and 
constant, and he was ever fertile in suggestions to his assistants. No 
wonder, then, that so many of the secrets of nature were unlocked 
through his agency. It was in the direction of this work of research 
that the man Baird stood forth as a giant ; it was w.here his vast knowl- 
edge of details was most apparent; it was where his marvellous skill 
was most shown ; it was where his insight into human character was 
most exhibited. With clearness he formulated his interrogatories ; 
with aptness he selected his course of procedure ; with judgment he 
sought the aid of others, and with suggestiveues's directed their work. 
And, lo ! his questions were speedily answered. It was in this manner 
that his own good hands were supplemented by the bands of many, 
that his own great mind was re-enforced by the best mental activity of 
many assistants; and thus the whole body of men nnder his control 
worked together as one organic integer for the increase and diftusion of 
knowledge among men. 

In his work with his assistants he scrupulously provided (hat every 
one should receive the meed of honor due for successful research and 
be treated all with generosity. Many an investigation begun by himself 
was turned over to assistants when he found that valuable conclusions 
could be reached ; and these assistants, who were his warm friends, his 
younger brothers, reaped the reward ; and he had more joy over every 
young man's success than over the triumphs and honors heaped upon 
himself from every quarter of the globe. He was the sympathetic 
counsellor of many men; into his ears were poured the sorrows and 
joys of others, and he mourned with the mourning and rejoiced with 
the rejoicing. To those in need his hand was ready and his purse was 
open, and many were the ijoor who called him "blessed." Though a 
man of great force of character, a man of great learning, a man upon 
whom had been showered the honors of the scientific world, in char- 
acter he was as simple as a child. He had a fund of '' folk-lore," and 
loved the books and papers written for children. In his later years, 
weakened with disease and burdened with many labors, he still read 
" St. Nicholas " from month to month, and kept the run of every little 
story, and was glad to be " a child again." His life at home was pure 
and sweet, and full of joys, for he gave and received love and trust 
and tender care. But the history of his home life is sacred. Its words 
and acts abide in the hearts of the wife and the daughter. 

For many long months he contemplated the day of parting. Labor 
that knew no rest, responsibility that was never lifted from his 
shoulders, too soon brought his life to an end. In the summer of the 
past year he returned to his work by the seaside, that he might die in 
its midst. There at Wood's HoU he had created the greatest biologic 
laboratory of the world ; and in that laboratory, with the best results 
of his life-work all about him, he calmly and philosophically waited 
for the time of times. Three days before he died he asked to be placed

ill a chair provided with wheels. On this lie was moved aronud the 
jiier, past the vessels which he had built for research, aud through the 
laboratory, where many men were at work at their biologic investiga- 
tions. For every one he had a word of good cheer, though he knew 
it was the last. At the same time, along the pier and through the 
laboratory, a little child was wheeled. " We are rivals," he said, " but 
I think that I am the bigger baby." In this supreme hour he was 
playing with a child. Then he was carried to his chamber, where he 
soon became insensible, and remained so until he was no more. 
" Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." 



A MEMOIR OF ASA GRAY.* 



By James D. Dana. 



Our friend and associate, Asa Gray, the eminent botanist of America, 
the broad-minded student of nature, ended his life of unceasing and 
fruitful work on the 30th of January last (1888). For thirty-five 
years he has been one of the editors "of this Journal, and for more than 
fifty years one of its contributors ; and through all his communications 
there is seen the profound and always delighted student, the accomplished 
writer, the just and genial critic, and, as Darwin has well said, "the 
lovable man."t 

Asa Gray was born on the 18th day of November, 1810, at Sauquoit, 
in the township of Paris, Oneida County, New York, a place 9 miles 
south of Utica. When a few years old his father moved to Paris 
Furnace, and established there a tannery; and the child, one account 
says, was put to work feeding the bark-mill and driving the horse, and 
another, riding the horse that ground the bark. "At six or seven he 
was a champion speller in the numerous 'matches' that enlivened the 
district school." At the age of eleven, nearly twelve, he was sent to 
the grammar school at Clinton, where he remained for two years, and 
the following year to the Fairfield Academy, both of the schools places 
where all the classics and mathemetics were taught that were required 
for entering the colleges of the land. But his instruction was cut short 
by his father's desire that he should enter the Fairfield Medical School. 
This school, of high repute, was established at that place in 1812 as 
the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Western District 
of New York. Dr. James Hadley was the professor of chemistry and 
materia medica, and his lectures of 1825-'26, while Gray was in the 
academy, and 182G-'27, after he had taken up medicine, gave the young 
student his first instruction in science. During the following winter at 
Fairfield, that of 1827-'28, the article on Botany in the Edinburgh 
Encyclopaedia attracted young Gray's attention, and excited his interest

fessor fJoodale, Professor Sargent and Prof. C. R. Barne.s, the last in the Botanical 
Gazette for January 1, 1886.

SO deei)ly that he at ouce bought a copy of " Eaton's Botany " and 
louged for spring. As spring opened, " he sallied forth early, discov- 
ered a plant in bloom, brought it home, and found its name in the 
manual to be Claytonia Virginica, tbe species C CaroHniana, to which 
the plant really belonged, not being distinguished then." From this 
time collecting plants became his chief pleasure. He finished his 
medical course, and in the spring of 1831 took his degree of Doctor of 
Medicine — to him the basis for a title, but not for future work. 

This ended his school and college days. As Gray's scientific educa- 
tion was carried forward without the aid of a formal scientific school, so 
it was with his literary studies. He had not the benefit of university 
training, and yet became eminent for his graceful and vigorous English, 
the breadth of his knowledge, his classical taste, and the acuteness of 
his logical preceptions. 

Before the close of the medical course he had opened correspond- 
ence about his plants with Ur. Lewis C Beck, a prominent botanist of 
Albany, and had had a collection named for him by Dr. John Torrey, of 
New York. Moreover, about this time he delivered his first course of 
lectures on botany, as substitute for Dr. Beck, and made use of the fees 
that he received for the expenses of a botanical excursion through 
western New York to Niagara Falls. Gray also delivered a course of 
lectures at Hamilton College, Clinton, on mineralogy and botany, for 
Professor Hadley, in tbe college year of ]833-'34, a biographical sketch 
of Professor Hadley, of Fairfield, by his son, the eminent Professor of 
Greek at Yale, stating that his father, who gave up his lectures at this 
college in 1834, " supplied his place during the last term by a favorite 
pupil and much valued friend. Dr. Asa Gray, who commenced under 
Professor Hadley the studies which were to make him jireeminent 
among the botanists of his time." Professor Hadley, the sketch says, 
had studied botony at New Haven, Connecticut, in 1818, under Dr. Eli 
Ives, an excellent botanist of that place, and mineralogy and geology 
under Professor Silliraan. 

In the autumn of 1831 Gray became instructor in chemistry, miner- 
alogy, and botany at " Bartlett's High School," in Utica. The scientific 
department of the school had been under the charge of a graduate of 
Eaton's " Kensselaer School," at Troj- — the earliest school of science 
in America — and Professor Eaton's practical methods of instruc- 
tion in chemistry, mineralogy and botany were there followed. Great 
was the delight of the boys in botanical and mineralogical excursions 
with Mr. Fay Egerton, and their pleasure, too, in the lectures on chem- 
istry. In 1830 the writer left the Utica High School for Yale College ; 
and a year later, Mr. Egerton having resigned on account of his health. 
Gray took his place. We had then no acquaintance and knew nothing 
of one another's interest in minerals and plants. My minerals and 
herbarium went with me to New Haven; and while I was there Gray 
was mineralizing as well as botanizing, during his vacations, in New 



ASA GRAY. 747 

Jersey and western and northern New York. His first published paper 
is mineralogical, — an account of his discoveries (along with Dr. J. B. 
Crawe) of new mineral localities in northern ISTew York. It is con- 
tained in the tweuty-lifth volume of the American Journal of Science,* 
and the title gives TJtica as his place of residence. He had previously 
made excursions after plants, fossils and minerals in New Jersey, and 
in 1834 joined Dr. Torrey in botanizing, besides collecting for him in 
the "pine barrens" of New Jersey and other places. 

In the autumn of 1834 Gray accepted the position of assistant to Dr. 
Torrey in the chemical laboratory of the Medical School of New York. 
Botany was at first his study under Dr. Torrey, but soon his work with 
Dr. Torrey; and here commenced their long-united labors aud publi- 
cations. From the first he showed himself an adept in his methods of 
investigation and in his terse aud mature style of scientific description. 
During the year 1834, while Torrey was preparing his monograph on 
the North American sedges, the Cyperaccie, Gray had in hand an illus- 
trated memoir on the genus Rhynchospora, in which he doubled the 
number of known North American species; and another also on "New, 
rare, and otherwise interesting plants of northern and western New 
York." Both papers were read before the Lyceum of Natural History 
of New York in December of that year (1834), and are published in 
volume III of the Annals of the Lyceum. Dr.Torrey's monograph was 
read on the 8th of August, 1836 ; aud in it he says that the part on 
the genera Rhynchospora and Ceratoschoenus was j)repared by Dr. 
Gray, and that his descriptions are so full, that he gives only his list of 
the species, with such alterations as he has thought it advisable to 
make, and some additional matter received since the publication of his 
paper. During 1834, 1835, two volumes of a work on North American 
Gramineie and Cyperacese were issued by him, (each containing a hun- 
dred species, and illustrated by dried specimens,) — now rare volumes, 
as only a small edition was published through private subscription. 
The first of these volumes, issued in February, 1834, only three years 
after his graduation at the Fairfield Medical School, is dedicated to 
his instructor and friend Dr. James Hadley. The preface acknowl- 
edges his indebtedness to Dr. Torrey aud to Dr. Henry P. Sartwell, of 
Penn Yau. Of the species described as new in the work, the first one, 
No. 20, from specimens collected by Dr. Sartwell, turned out to be 
Nuttal's (Jalamagrostis confinis. But the next one, No. 28, Panicum 
xanthophysum, from the vicinity of Oneida Lake, stands and is the 
first of the thousands of good Asa-Gray species. Thus Gray's botani- 
cal investigations were well begun before his twenty-fifth year had 
passed. 

* Page 346. The article is iu the second number of the volume, which was issued 
.Taunary 1, aud is without date ; the one following it is dated September 6, 1833. 
The paper therefore was probably written in the autumn of 1833, after a summer's 
excursion. 



748 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 

Ill February or March of 1835 lie gave his last instruction at the 
Utica High School. He expected to continue as Dr. Torrey's assistant 
the following season ; but " the prospects of the Medical School were 
so poor that Dr. Torrey could not aflbrd to employ him." He never- 
theless returned to New York in the autumn, took the position of curator 
and librarian of the Lyceum of Natural History, and continued his 
botanical investigations. During the summer he had begun the prep- 
eration of his " Elements of Botany," and in the course of 1836 the 
work appeared. It showed the scholar in its science and in its style. 
Tbe subjects of vegetable structure, physiology, and classification were 
presented in a masterly manner, though within a small compass. The 
book moreover showed his customary independence of judgment and 
clear head in various criticisms and suggestions, — later investigations 
sustaining them, much to his gratification. 

The Wilkes Exploring Expedition came near making a profound im- 
pression on Gray's life. In the summer of 1836 the position of botanist 
in the expedition was offered him and accepted. But delays occurred 
in the time of sailing, and changes were threatened that threw uncer- 
tainties over the cruise, and for these reasons, and on account of the 
work on the North American Flora, of which, by invitation of Dr. 
Torrey, he was to be joint author, his resignation was sent in the fol- 
lowing year. The expedition changed its commander from Commodore 
Patterson, over a ship-of-the-Iine, to Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, with a 
squadron of two sloops-of-war (better adapted for the purpose), besides 
other vessels, six in all, and sailed in August, 1838. The four years 
abroad would have given him an opportunity for observations and dis- 
coveries that would have rejoiced him — excursions in Madeira, the 
Canaries, to the Organ Mountains in Brazil, a brief look about Orange 
Bay near Cape Horn, excursions to the Andes of Chili and about lower 
Peru, over Oregon and Washington Territory, and parts of California, 
through numerous island groups of the South and North Pacific, in 
Australia and New Zealand, about Luzon in the Philippines, at Singa- 
pore, at Cape of Good Hope and St. Helena — and his open mind would 
have gathered in facts on the relations and geographical distribution 
of species that would have been to him a mine of wealth as science ad- 
vanced under Darwin's lead. The place of botanist in the expedition 
was well occupied by the most excellent, indefatigable, and many-sided 
zoologist Dr.Charles Pickering, and by Mr. William D. Breckenridge, a 
Scotch gardener and zealous collector, and Mr. William Rich ; but with 
Dr. Gray, devoted to the one subject, great results would have been 
accomplished. North American botany however would no doubt have 
suffered. 

By October of 1838, a couple of months after the sailing of the Explor- 
ing Expedition, two parts of the projected " Flora " were already out. 
But so many doubtful points had been brought to light, that a study of 
foreign herbaria had become imperative. Dr. Gray had accepted, dur- 



ASA GRAY. 749 

ing the summer, the chair of botany in the recently founded University 
of Michigan, but with the condition that he should have a year abroad 
for study ; and the year was given to this object. All the herbaria of 
Europe were carefully examined with regard to the type-specimens of 
American plants, and full notes taken for use in the discrimination and 
identification of species. The fortieth volume of the American Journal 
(April, 1841) opens with a highly interesting paper by him, giving ac- 
counts of these herbaria, their contributors, condition, and special char- 
acters, commencing with that of Linnsieus and the story of its career before 
reaching the Linnean Society of London. His labors abroad involved 
an immense amount of detailed and exact observation, requiring 
thorough knowledge, excellent judgment, and a retentive memory ; and 
he came home well stored for the work which he and Torrej' had in 
hand. 

Moreover, he made during the trip the personal acquaintance of the 
leading botanists of England and the Continent, and had from all a 
cordial reception. 

"In Glasgow he made the acquaintance of William Jackson Hooker, 
the founder of the greatest of all herbaria, the author of many works 
upon botanj^ who had already published a large part of his "Flora 
Boreali-Americana," in which were described the plants of British 
North America, a work just then of special interest to the young Ameri- 
can, because it first systematically displayed the discoveries of David 
Douglas, of Drummond, Richardson, and other English travelers in 
North America. At Glasgow, too, was laid the foundation for his life- 
long friendship with the younger Hooker, then a medical student seven 
years his junior, but destined to become the explorer of New Zealand 
and Antarctic floras, the intrepid Himalaya traveler, the associate of 
George Bentham in the authorship of the "Genera Plantarum," a presi- 
dent of the Royal Society, and, like his father, thedirector of the Royal 
Gardens at Kew. At Edinburgh he saw Greville, the famous crypto- 
gamist; while in London, Francis Boott, an American long resident in 
England, the author of the classical history of the genus " Carex," and 
at that time secretary of the Linnean Society, opened to him every bo- 
tanical door. Here he saw Robert Brown, then the chief botanical fig- 
ure in Europe, with the exception, perhaps, of De Candolle; and Men- 
zies, who fifty years before had sailed as naturalist with Vancouver on his 
great voyage of discovery ; and Lambert, the author of the sumptuous 
history of the genus " Pinus," in whose hospitable dining-room were 
stored the plants upon which Pursli had based his North American 
Flora. Here, too, he met Bentham and Lindley and Bauer, and all the 
other workers in his scientific field. 

"A visit to Paris brought hiui the acquaintance of the group of dis- 
tinguished botanists then living at the French capital : P. Barker 
Webb, a writer upon the botany of the Canaries; the Baron Delessert, 
Achille Richard, whose father had written the Flora of Michaux ; Mir-

bel, already old, but still actively engaged in investigations upon vege- 
table anatomy; Spacb ; Dccaisne, then a young aide naturaliste at the 
Jardiu des Plantes, of which he was afterward to become the distin- 
guished director ; Auguste St. Hilaire, the naturalist of the Duke of 
Luxembourg's expedition to Brazil, and at that time in the full enjoy- 
ment of a great reputation earned by his works upon the Brazilian flora ; 
Jacques Gay ; Gaudichaud, the naturalist of the voyage of L'LTrauie and 
LaPhysicienne; the young Swiss botanist Edmond Boisser, the Spanish 
traveler, and later one of the most important contributors to systematic 
botany in his classical "Flora Orientalis;" Adrien de Jussieu, grand- 
nephew of Bernard, and sou of Laurent de -Jussieu, himself a worthy 
and distinguished representative of a family unequaled in botanical 
tame and accomplishment. 

" At Montpellier Dr. Gray passed several days with the botanists 
Delile and Dunal, and then hurried on to Italy, where at Padua, in the 
most ancient botanical garden in Europe, he made the acquaintance of 
Visiani, at that time one of the principal botanists in Italy. At Vienna 
he saw the learned Endlicher, the author of a classical " Genera Plan- 
tarum;" and at Munich, Vou Martins, the renowned Brazilian traveler, 
the historian of the palms, and the earliest contributor to that stupen- 
dous work the " Flora Brasiliensis," which bears his name ; and here, too, 
was Zuccarini, the collaborator with Von Siebold in the "Flora Ja- 
ponica." Geneva then — as at the present time, was a center of scientific 
activity; and there he made the personal acquaintance of the De Can- 
dolles, father and son, and worked in their unrivalled herbarium and 
library. He saw Schlechtendal at Halle; and at Berlin, Klotzsch, Kunth, 
and Ehreuberg, — familiar names in the annals of botanical science. 
Alphonse De CandoUe and Sir Joseph Hooker alone are left of the bril- 
liant group of distinguished naturalists who cordially welcomed the 
young American botanist in 1839." * 

Dr. Gray also, while abroad, performed a great service for the Uni- 
versity of Michigan in superintending the selection of works for the 
nucleus of its library ; and the University showed its appreciation of his 
judgment and of the benefit to the institution, by honoring him and 
itself at its semi-centennial celebration the past summer by conferring 
on him the degree of Doctor of Laws. 

Again at home, and now well equipped for conquering difficulties 
about American species, he went at the Flora with new vigor. The first 
volume was completed by Torrey and Gray in 1840 and the second in 
February, 1843. In the interval between these dates, during the sum- 
mer of 1841, Gray spent five to six weeks in a botanical excursion through 
the valley of Virginia to the summits of the high mountains of North 
Carolina. A letter about the trip, addressed to Sir William J. Hooker, 
published in this Journal in 1842, first gives an account of the excur- 
sions into these regions by his predecessors, Bartram, Michaux, and

-rohn Frtiser, of the last century, aud John Lyon, Michaux the younger, 
Pursh, Nuttall, Curtis, and others, of this, mentioning their discoveries, 
with critical remarks on the species they observed aud on their distri- 
bution ; aud then he describes his owu journey, adding notes on the 
plants met with by the way and in the mountains, commencing his ob- 
servations at Barper's Ferry. His journey among the North Carolina 
mountains included the ascent of the " Grandfather," 5,897 feet in eleva- 
tion, and the Roan Mountain, G,30G feet. This is one among a number 
of such excursions. 

Another labor of this period was the revision of his "Elements of 
Botany," which, without much change of general method, he made a 
far more comprehensive aud thorough treatise, and in 1842 issued under 
the title of the "Botanical Text book." Since then successive editions 
have appeared with large advances, as the science required. By the 
firth edition, that of 1879, the subject had so expanded that it was di- 
vided, and the work made to include only Structural Botany, covering 
Morphology, Taxonomy and Phytography, leaving Physiological and 
Cryptogamic botany' to other hands. The second volume, an exposition 
of Physiological Botany, appeared in 1885 from the pen of his colleague, 
Prof. G. L. Goodale. A third volume on Cryptogamic Botany is prom- 
ised by another colleague, Prof. W. G. Farlow. 

Gray never entered on duty at the Michigan University, it being im- 
possible for him to carry on his publications so far away from the New 
York herbaria aud botanical libraries. In 1842 he was invited by the 
Fellows of Harvard College to the Fisher Professorship of Natural 
History, recently founded on a bequest by Dr. Joshua Fisher. The 
duties of the professorship included the delivery of a course of lectures 
on botany, aud the direction of a small botanic garden which had been 
established in Cambridge in 1805, under the auspices and with the 
assistance of the Massachusetts Society for promoting Agriculture. 
Thomas Nuttall had charge of the garden from 1822 to 1828, and after 
that it was without a head until the appointment of Dr. Gray. The 
garden was still poor in funds, and had not even a herbarium to aid 
Gray iu his botanical studies. But he entered on the duties with zeal, 
conducted the required lectures in the most lucid and attractive man- 
ner, freely gave the use of his study to such students as wished to learn 
more of the science than they could acquire from the lectures, and 
gathered a vast herbarium. And all the time he carried on an enor- 
mous correspondence with promptness, aud answered all social demands 
with unfailing courtesy, besides continuing his botanical investigations 
and writing books and memoirs. These duties continued until 1872, 
when he was relieved from that of teaching and the charge of the 
garden. In 1864 he made the offer to Harvard College of the herbarium 
and library which he had gathered, already very large, on conditio. i of 
their erecting a fire-proof building to contain them, which was accepted.

Botanical work was always in progress in some form. One of the 
very valuable parts of it consisted in his contributions to the American 
Journal of Science, — which were continued, with scarcely any interrup- 
tion, for the love of the science and of the men engaged in it. Every 
important work as it was issued was here noticed, with often critical 
remarks, or additional facts and illustrations, or modifications of opin- 
ions, that gave them great scientific value. And not the least instruc- 
tive and attractive part were the biographical sketches of deceased 
botanists, European as well as American; for to him the world was all 
one, and all -botanists were akin. He was sure to criticise what he be- 
lieved to be wrong ; but it was done so fairly, with so evident a desire 
for scientific accuracy, and in so kind a spirit, that offense was rarely 
given. A botanist of eminence says that " these notices form the best 
history of .the botanical literature of the last fifty years, and of the prog- 
ress and development of botanical science, that has been written." 

The fortieth volume of this Journal (1841) contains an admirable 
example of his kindly method of reviewing an author that had faults, 
and of his critical study among great difficulties. It is a review of the 
botanical writings of Rafinesque, that enthusiastic naturalist, poet, etc., 
with reference, not to his faults, but to the value to be attached to his 
numerous genera and species and their recognition in American Botany. 
Throughout there is a full appreciation of Rafinesque's sagacity in many 
of his discriminations, a fair presentation of his scientific claims, of his 
love of nature and greater love of self, without a harsh word for his 
errors or egotism; and only a citing of a sentence here and there, or a 
fact, that enables Rafinesque to make his own presentations as to his 
species and genera, with a bare mention of his "twelve new species of 
thunder and lightning." 

The publication of the second volume of the " Flora," in 1843, ended 
that work. The territory of the United States afterward took larger 
dimensions, and new fields were to be explored before a complete 
"Flora" could be published. Torrey was engaged on these studies 
until his death in 1873; and Gray also was publishing memoirs that 
were contributions to the subject. Gray's various memoirs include — 
descriptions of the collections made by Lindheimer, in western Texas 
(l843-'48); by Fendler, in New Mexico (1846-'47); by Wright, near the 
boundary of Texas and Mexico (1849 and 1851-'52) ; by Thurber, along 
the United States and Mexican boundary (1851-'52); the Botany of vari- 
ous Government surveys, and other Government reports, and a portion 
of the Botany of California. Other papers are distributed through the 
publications of learned societies, especially the American Academy of 
Arts and Sciences of Boston, which contains hundreds of pages of them, 
the Proceedings of the Philadelphia and California Academies, the 
Boston Society of Natural History, the Linnean Society of London, etc. 

Further, the i)lants of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, exclusive 
of the ferns and those from western North America, were early sent to

him for description ; and in 1854 appeared his Report, in quarto, accom- 
panied by a folio atlas, containing a liundred plates. 

Gray was three times over the Rocky Mountain region to the Pacific 
coast. On the second trip he was accompanied by Sir Joseph Hooker ; 
and an important paper on tlie "Vegetation of the Rocky Mountain 
Region" by them is published in the Reports of the II ay den Geological 
Survey for 1878. He was in Europe again in the years 1850-51. A note 
from Mrs. Gray says, "He went abroad especially for the plants of tlie 
Wilkes Expedition. After traveling in Switzerland (going up the 
Rhine to Geneva, where he worked awhile in DeOandolle's herbarium), 
we went to Munich and saw Martins, and then back to England by 
Holland. On the first of October we went into Herefordshire to the 
country place of George Bentham, and spent two months there, Mr. 
Bentham going over with Dr. Gray the poUection which had been 
sent out from America, a most generous piece of work." It was at this 
time, while at the Kew Gardens, near London, that he had the passing 
introduction to Darwin, alluded to in Darwin's first letter to liim.* 

In 1868 he crossed the ocean the fourth time, going in September and 
returning in November of the following year. He was hard at work 
over herbaria at Kew during both autumns, and worked also in Paris, 
Munich, Geneva, and elsewhere, but with more holiday than in any 
journey he took, except the last. In this visit he was twice with Dar- 
win, first in the autumn of 1868, and then in October, 1869. 

After forty years of studying and discriminating among the older 
species of the continent and their representatives abroad, and of de- 
scribing species from late discoveries, and of work at classification, with 
experimental work at Flora-making during the years 1838 to 1843, he 
was finally ready, in 1878, with the first part of a new North American 
" Flora," to which he gave the name of "Synoptical Flora of North 
America." This first part contained the Gamopetalae after the Com- 
positte. A second part was published in 1884, comprising the Capri- 
foliacefe to the Oomposit;^ inclusive, or the ground of the second vol- 
ume of Torrey and Gray's Flora; so that the middle half of the entire 
Flora is now completed. The two parts cover 974 closely printed pages. 
"They are masterpieces of clear and concise arrangement, and of com- 
pactness and beauty' of method, and display great learning and ana- 
lytical power." The jjrogress of the science since the time of Michaux 
is well exhibited in the fact that while this author knew 193 species of 
Compositie when he published his Flora, Gray, seventy-five years later, 
describes no less than 1,636 species under 239 genera. 

During these years Dr. Gray added to the resources of the instructor 
in Botany by the publication of his "Manual," a descriptive work 
including all species growing east of the Mississippi and north of Ten- 
nessee and North Carolina. It was first issued in 1848, and its fifth and 
last edition in 1868. The " Elementary Lessons in Botany and Vege-

table Physiology," also, was published first iu 1868, as an accompani- 
ment to the Manual, and has had its five editions at nearly the same 
dates. The first volume of another companion work to the Manual was 
issued in 1848, — his " Genera Illustrata," containing descriptions of the 
genera of the United States Flora, wilh illustrations of great beauty 
by I. Sprague; and in 1849 a second volume was published, carrying 
the works nearly to the Leguminosfe; and here it stopped, on account 
mainly of the expense. His " Field, Forest, and Garden Botany," a 
useful flora for schools, came out in 1868; and the charming smaller 
volumes, " How Plants Grow " and " How Plants Behave," respectively 
in 1858 and 1875. The latter was prompted by Darwin's works on 
Insectivorous Plants, the Orchids, and Dimorphism, and both are well 
adapted to the young student and all uninitiated readers. 

Besides the subjects of Gray's investigations already mentioned, two 
others of a wider philosophical character interested him deeply : one, 
in which he was pioneer, the other, the Origin of Species, after Darwin. 

The first of these subjects was the Geographical Distribution of 
Plants, and particularly the species of the northern United States 
both within and beyond the bounds of the continent, and the bearings 
of the facts on variation and origin. 

His first paper on the subject is contained in volumes xxii and xxiii 
of the American Journal of Science, the numbers for September, 1856, 
and January and May, 1857. It was written partly in compliance with 
the request of "an esteemed correspondent" for a list of American 
alpine plants, who, as now appears, was Darwin. Darwin's Life con- 
tains, on page 420, the letter, and shows that its date was April 25, 
1855; and, also, a second letter of June 8, 1855, which opens thus: "I 
thank you cordially for your remarkably kind letter of the 22d ult., and 
for the extremely pleasant and obliging manner in which you have taken 
my rather troublesome questions. I can hardly tell you how much your 
list of alpine plants has interested me." And then Darwin puts more 
questions to his genial correspondent. 

The long paper, modestly entitled " Statistics of the Flora of the 
United States," contains numerous tables, comparing as regards plants 
the northern United States with Europe on one side, and Asia and 
Japan on the other; the eastern part of the country with the western, 
and with the adjoining continents in the north temperate zone; the 
plants of alpine and subalpine regions in the northern United States, 
and their distribution southward and eastward and westward over the 
other continents; the distribution of species common to this country 
and Enrope, as to size of orders and genera ; also, as regards related 
and representative species, and the same for eastern and western 
America; lists of species of widely sundered habitation; with numer- 
ous other points, and abundant explanatory remarks; making thus a 
thorough philosophical digest of the subject of geographical distribu- 
tion, having all the completeness as respects the northern United

States that the existiuj? state of the science admitted of. He closes 
with a general review of the characteristics of the North American 
flora. 

In the course of the pages, he advocates the idea of a single area of 
origin for a species, with dispersion at an epoch more or less ancient, 
to account for distribution ; sustains Darwin's " surmise " as to the 
species of large genera having a greater geographical area than those 
of small genera; observes that a large percentage of the extra Euro- 
pean types of eastern America are shared with eastern Asia, and 
finds " that, curiously enough, eleven, or one-third, of our strictly alpine 
species common to Europe — all but one of them arctic in the Old 
World — are not known to cross the Arctic circle on this continent; so 
that it seems almost certain that the interchange of alpine species 
between us and Europe must have taken place in the direction of New- 
foundland, Labrador, and Greenland, rather than through the polar 
regions" (xxiii, 73). 

Two years later, in 1859, Dr. Gray had studied a collection of plants 
from Japan (alluded to in the former paper, xxiii, 369, as iii hand), 
which had been collected by Mr. Charles Wright; and his memoir on 
the subject, read that year before the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, closes with a sequel to the subject of Geographical Dis- 
tribution, bringing out conclusions of still higher interest. He starts 
off with the then new announcement and its evidence, that among the 
plants of Japan, more species are represented in Europe than over the 
nearer land, western i^orth America; more in eastern North America 
than in either of the other two regions; and adds, that hence, there 
has been a peculiar intermingling of the eastern American and eastern 
Asia floras, which demands explanation. The explanation he finds in 
the idea of migrations to and from the arctic regions, determined in 
part, at least, by the climate of the preglacial, glacial, and postglacial 
eras, and that the alpine plants of the'summits of the White Mount- 
ains, Adirondacks, Black Mountains, and Alleghanies are species left 
by the retreating glacier. 

Dr. Gray returned to this subject in his presidential address, in 1872, 
before the American Association for the Advancement of Science,* 
and, owing to the progress that had been made in the paleontology of 
the continent, the arctic portion as well as the more southern, and de- 
velopments elsewhere also, he was enabled to trace out the courses of 
the migrations of plants, the Sequoias or Redwoods and many other 
kinds, by positive facts with regard to the arctic and more southern 
iioras ; and showed that the distribution southward into the western 
United States, into eastern Europe or western Eurasia', and into Japan 
and Asia or eastern Eurasia, was not only dependent, as he had before 
put forth, on change in continental climates, but also that the particu- 
lar direction southward was determined to a large extent bv fitness of

climate as to heat and dryness. The surprising revelations are now so 
generally known that this brief reference to them is all that is here 
needed. 

Gray's comprehensive knowledge of the plants of the world, of their 
distribution, and specifically of the relations of North American species, 
genera, and orders to those of the other continents, and the precision 
of his knowledge, enabled him to be of much service to Darwin in the 
preparation of the first edition of the Origin of Species, and afterward, 
also, in the elaboration of Darwin's other publications. His mind was 
not very strongly bound to opinions about species, partly because of 
his natural openness to facts, his conclusions seeming always to have 
only a reasonable prominence in his philosophical mind, rarely enough 
to exclude the free entrance of the new, whatever the source, and to a 
considerable extent from the difficulties he had experienced in defining 
species and genera amidst the wide diversities and approximate blend- 
lugs which variation had introduced. 

Darwin, in a letter to Gray written during the following summer,' 
having in view Gray's article in this journal, and another discussion of 
his — published in the proceedings of the American Academy, says, 
"I declare that you know my book as well as I do myself, and bring to 
the question new lines of illustration and argument in a manner which 
excites my astonishment and almost my envy." "As Hooker lately said 
in a note to me, you are, more than any one else, the thorough master 
of the subject." 

Gray's "Darwiniana," published in 1870, is composed of a number of 
his essays and reviews, from the American Journal of Science, the 
"Nation" and the "Atlantic Monthly," together with a closing chapter, 
written for the volume, entitled "Evolutionary Teleology." The last 
chapter brings out Gray's adherence to the doctrine of natural selec- 
tion, and also his divergence from true Darwinism. These divergences 
are thus expressed : 

"We are more and more convinced that variation, and therefore the 
ground of adaptation, is not a product of, but a response to, the action 
of the environment. Variations, in other words the differences between 
individual plants and animals, however originated, are evidently not 
from without, but from within ; not physical, but physiological." And 
elsewhere he has said that the variation in a species is apt to take place 
in particular directions and make linear ranges of varieties, as often ex- 
emplified among plants; which accords with the preceding conclusion, 
pp. 386. 

Again speaking of the forms of Orchids and their connection with, 
and relation to, insect fertilization, he says: "We really believe that 
these exquisite adaptations have come to pass in the course of nature, 
and under Natural Selection, but not that Natural Selection alone ex- 
plains or in a just sense originates them. Or, rather, if this term is to 
stand for sufficient cause and rational explanation, it must denote or in- 



ASA GRAY. 757 

chule that inscrutable something which produces, as well as that which 
results in the survival of, 'the fittest,'" p. 388. 

Neither of these doctrines is strictly Darwinian, though not at variance 
with Natural Selection. They take away what has often been urged 
against Darwinism: the idea that the environment under Natural Se- 
lection dominates in the determination of the direction of variation, and 
hence that evolution comes chiefly through external conditions; and 
substitutes the idea that the environment works under organic control 
through Natural Selection. One view implies that the environment in- 
fluence is superior to organic law in the process ; the other, that organic 
law is superior to the environment. Moreover, Gray's last sentence ex- 
presses the opinion that Darwin's Natural Selection can not produce 
the "survival of the fittest," though "survival of the fittest" is the result 
brought about. There is an "inscrutable something" that "produces." 
The writer would go a little farther and say that the "survival of the 
fittest," under "natural selection," is survival, not the production of 
"the fittest;" but this substitute I have reason to believe that Gray 
would not accept. 

Further, Gray was a theistic Darwinian, as abundantly shown in his 
"Darwiniana," and alike also in his "Natural Science and Religion." 
Here is his creed in his own words, as published in the preface to the 
Darwiniana: "I am scientifically and in my own fashion a Darwinian, 
philosophically, a convinced theist, and religiously, an accepter of the 
'creed commonly called the Niceue,' as the exponent of the Christian 
faith." 

Gray's various literary or less scientific papers, contributions mostly 
to the "North American Review," "Nation," and the "Atlantic 
Monthly," always show the clear thinker, the graceful writer, and the 
well-stored head, whatever the topic; and when it is scientific, his method 
of popularizing and illustrating his views is of the most attractive kind. 
Ills last contribution to the "Nation" was a long characteristic notice 
of Darwin's Life and Letters, in November, showing no waning in his 
faculties; on the contrary, there is manifest the same clearheaded, 
judicial, and sprightly reviewer, as honest as ever in his opinions and 
in his modesty amid Darwin's profuse (he says effusive) commendations. 

The last visit to Europe was made during the past year. He went 
with the intention of doing but little of his herbarium work, and find- 
ing pleasure among friends old and new. Mrs. Crray, as usual, was 
with him. It proved to be a triumphal time to the modest botanist, 
for he received the honor of doctorate from each of the great universi- 
ties of Britain, that of Oxford, of Cambridge, and of Edinburgh. He 
returned in October in excellent spirits and health — an apparent prom- 
ise of some years more of work. He was soon again occupied with his 
"Flora," the completion of which was the earnest desire of all botanists. 
Yet while wishing to see its last page himself, his anxiety about it had 
lessened in later years, because aware that his colleague in charge of 



758 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 

the Herbarium, Dr. Sereno Watsou — oue of the stiideuts that he hjid 
gathered about him — was capable of taking up the lines whenever he 
should lay them down. 

Gray's standing among jihilosophers abroad, is manifested in his 
recent reception in Great Britain. It is further shown in his having 
been elected an honorary member of all the principal academies or 
societies of science in Europe, including the Eoyal Society of London 
and the Institute of France. He was president of the Association for 
the Advancement of Science in the year 1871, and has been one of the 
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution since 1874 ; and for ten years, 
from 1863 to 1873, he was president of the American Academy of Arts 
and Sciences. In 1884 his portrait in bronze, made by St. Gaudens, 
was presented to Harvard College. 

One of the most gratifying testimonials from his fellows in science 
was received on his seventy-fifth birthday. To his surprise there came 
greetings or notes of congratulations from every American botanist, 
old and young, and, along with the notes, a silver v^ase embossed with 
figures of the i)lants more i)articularly identified with his name or 
studies. It was delightful to witness, says one of his associates, his 
child-like pleasure as he received the gift. Among the letters were 
some from friends who were not botanists. The following lines were 
from Mr. Lowell : 

Just Fate : prolong liis life, well speut, 

Whose indefatigable hours 
Have been as gaily innocent 

And fragrant as his flowers. 

The vase is about 11 inches high exclusive of the ebony pedestal. 
The pedestal is surrounded by a hoop of hammered silver on whicb is 
the inscription:

Among the flowers, in rait^ed figures about the vase, the place of 
honor on one side is held by Grayia imlygaloides, and on the other by 
Shorlia galacifolia. On the Grayia side, the prominent plants are 
Aquilegia Canadefisis, Centaiirea Americana, Jeffersonia diphylla, Eud- 
hechia speciosa and Mitchella repens ; and on tlie Shortia side, there are 
Lilium Grayi, Aster Bigelovii, SoUdago serotina, and Upigcva repens. 
The lower part of the handles runs into a cluster of Dioncea leaves, 
which clasps the body of the vase, and their upper part is covered with 
Nothokcna Grayi. Adlumia cirrhosa trails over the whole back-ground, 
and here and there its leaves and flowers crop out. The greetings, in 
the form of cards and letters, that had been sent by the givers of the 
vase, were placed on a simple but elegant silver plate, which had within 
the engraved inscription : Bearing the greetings of one hundred and

eighty botauists of North America to Asa Gray, ou his seventy-fifth 
birthday, November 18th, 1885.* 

Botauists have, as their common object of interest, that part of Nat- 
ure which seems by its free gift of beauty and fragrance (without a 
trace of self, the dominating element in the animal) fully to reciprocate 
attection ; and there is hence a reason for that feeling of fraternity which 
such a gift so beautifully expresses, independently of the tribute in it to 
the botanist of botanists. Plants seem thus to select from among inquir- 
ing minds those which are to be their investigators, or the botanists. 

Darwin first mentioned to Gray his view that " species arise like 
varieties with much extinction," in a letter to Gray of July 20, 1856. t 
At this time all men of science with a rare exception believed in the 
permanence of species. J. D. Hooker's Flora Indica of 1855 "assumes 
that species are distinct creations." | Professor Huxley, in his history 
of the reception of Darwinian ideas, says, with the perfect fairness that 
always has characterized him, that " within the ranks of the biologists, 
at that time [1851-'58], I met with nobody [and he here includes him- 
self] except Dr. Grant, of University College, who had a word to say 
for evolution ; and his advocacy was not calculated to advance the 
cause. Outside of these ranks, the only person known to me whose 
knowledge and capacity compelled respect, and who was, at the same 
time, a thorough-going evolutionist, was Herbert Spencer. - - - 
But even my friend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of apt illustra- 
tion could not drive me from my agnostic position." Lyell, he shows, 
was leaning that way, but not himself. So it was in 1857, and in 1858 
up to the publication of Darwin's and Wallace's papers of that year.§ 

Gray therefore knew of Darwin's views before the biologists of 
Britain, unless we except Lyell and J. D. Hooker. Darwin acknowl- 
edged Gray's " remarkably kind letter" on the 5th of September, 1857, || 
and was prompted by his " extraordinary kindness," and evidently by 
his assurances, that he had no objections to facts from any source, had 
great interest in the subject, and only saw some "grave difficulties" 
against his doctrine, to explain to Dr. Gray with detail, under six 
heads, the prominent facts and arguments in the theory of " Natural 
Selection," which he says is the "title of his book." This letter is the 
first exposition that Darwin had made of his theory, and hence it has 
proved to have great documentary value. 

A letter which the writer received from Gray in the interval be- 
tween Darwin's two letters, dated December 13, 185G, shows well the 
state of his mind at that time. He says : " On the subject of species, 
their nature, distribution, what system in natural history is, etc., cer-

taiu inferences are slowly settling themselves in my mind or taking 
shape ; but on some of the most vexed questions, I have as yet no 
opinion whatever, and no very strong bias, thanks partly to the fact 
that I can think of and investigate such matters only now and then, 
and in a very desultory way."* 

In a letter of a year later, subsequent in date to Darwin's letter, 
Gray wrote me with reference to my paper on " Species," read at the 
meeting of the American Association in August, 1857, — which paper 
may be taken, perhaps, as a culmination of the past, just as the new 
future was to make its appearance, — pointing out to me the fatal objec- 
tion to my argument. 

His words (dated November 7) are worth quoting : " Taking the 
cue of species, if I may so say, from the inorganic, you develop the 
subject to great advantage for your view, and all you say must have 
great weight in ^reasoning from the general.' But in reasoning from 
inorganic species, to organic species, and in making it tell where you 
want it, and /or lohat you want it to tell, you must be sure that you are 
using the word species in the same sense in the two ; that the one is 
really the equivalent of the other. That is what I am not yet convinced 
of; and so to me the argument comes only with the force of an analogy, 
whereas I suppose you want it to come as demonstration. Very likely 
you could convince me that there is no fallacy in reasoning from the one 
to the other to the extent you do. But all my experience makes me 
cautious and slow about building too much on analogies, and until 
I see further and clearer I must continue to think there is an essential 
difference between hinds of animals or plants and hinds of matter. 

"How far we may safely reason from the one to the other is the 
question. If we may do so even as far as you do, might not Agassiz (at 
least plausibly) say that as the species Iron was created in a vast number 
of individuals over the whole earth, so the presumption is that any 
given species of plants or animals was originated in as many individuals 
as there are now, and over as wide an area; the human species under 
as great diversities as it now has, barring historical intermixture; thus 
reducing the question between you to insignilicauce? because, then, the 
question whether men are of one or of several species would no longer 
be a question, or of much consequence. You may answer him from 
another starting point, no doubt ; but he may still insist that it is a 
legitimate carrying out of your principle." 

In the same letter Gray prophesies as follows, from actual knowledge, 
it now appears: "You maybe sure that before long there must be 
one more resurrection of the development theory in a new form, obviating 
many of the arguments against it, and presenting a more respectable 
and more formidable appearance than it ever has before." 

*Gray has some important observations on the bearing of hybridization on variation, 
in a review of Hooker's Flora Indica in the unmber of the Am. Journal of Science for 
January, 1856, XXI, 134. 



ASA GRAY. 7fil 

The Origin of Species was out in November, 1859. (rray received an 
early copy of it from Darwin, and therefore his very valuable review 
was ready for the American Journal of Science early in 18G0.* . 

With regard to the sufficiency of the argument brought forward in 
Darwin's work, Gray says that "To account upon these principles for 
the gradual elimination and segregation of nearly allied forms — such as 
varieties, sub-species and closely related or representative species, — and 
also for their geographical association and present range, is comi^ara- 
tively easy, is apparently within the bonds of possibility, and even of 
probability." But as to the formation of genera, families, orders, and 
classes by natural selection, Gray simply states Darwin's arguments on 
the subject, and some objections on a few weak points, without express- 
iug further his own views. He concludes with some remarks on the 
religious bearing of a theory that refers creation to natural law and 
declares rightly, in accordance with his firm faith to the end, that 
"Natural law is the human conception of continued and orderly Divine 
action." 

It is a case of natural selection. But Dr. Gray was more to bota- 
nists than a friend and leader. He was the "Beloved Gray" — the 
object of their admiration and devotion on account of his goodness, his 
high principle, his frank independence, his unfailing cordiality, and the 
clearness of his intellectual vision, like that of a seer. He stands be- 
fore the world as a lofty example of the Christian philosopher. 

Dr. Gray was married in 1848 to the daughter of the late eminent 
lawyer of Boston, Charles G. Loring. His excellent and accomplished 
wife, who survives him, was in full sympathy with him in all his pur- 
suits and pleasures, a bright, cheerful and helpful companion, at home 
and in his travels abroad. 

In a letter to the writer in 188G, Gray says : 

- - - I have had a week in old Oneida, which still looks natural. 
I am grinding away at the Flora, and shall probably be found so doing 
when I aui called for. Very well : I have a most comfortable and happy 
old age. 

Wishing you the same, jours ever, 

A. Gray. 

Noveuiber last, the month after his return from Europe, he put aside 
his nearly completed revision of the " Vitacea^ or Grape-vines of North 
America," to write his last words about Darwin in the review of Dar-

this Journal. The latter manuscript lay unfinished on his table when, 
on the 27th of the month, a paralytic stroke put an end to work, with 
every jjrospect then that his name also would have to be adiled to the

list of 1887. He lingered until the 30th of January without a return at 
any time of his powers of speech, and toward evening of that day 
passed quietly away. 

Asa Gray's remains lie buried in the Mount Auburn Cemetery. Amer-

MEMOIR OF ASA GKAY.* 



By Prof. William G. Farlow. 



Asa Gray was t)ora ou November 18, 1810, ia Sauquoit Valley iii the 
towuship of Paris, Oneida County, New York, and died on January 30, 
1888, at (Cambridge, Massachusetts. On the paternal side he was de- 
scended from a Scotch-Irish family who emigrated to this country in the 
early part of the last century. His grandfather, Moses Wiley Gray, 
was born at Worcester, Massachusetts, December 31, 174:5, aud was 
married in 17G9 to Sallie Miller. He went in 1787 to Vermont, where 
his wife soon afterwards died; aud when their son Moses, the father of 
Asa Gray, was eight years old, the father and son moved still farther 
west, to Sauquoit Valley, then almost a frontier settlement. Sixteen 
years later, Moses Gray was married to Roxana Howard, a daughter of 
Joseph Howard, of English descent, who, leaving his home in Massa- 
chusetts, had settled in Sauquoit Valley the same year as the Gray 
family. Of their family of eight children, five sons aud three daughters, 
Asa was the first-born. 

When a boy he assisted his father in the smaller duties connected with 
his farm and tannery ; but at an early age he showed a much greater 
fondness for reading than for farm work, and the lather soon came to 
the conclusion that his son would make a better scholar than farmer. 
Until he was about twelve years old the only education he received was 
what could be obtained for a partof the year in the small district school, 
and in the small private school at Sauquoit taught by the son of the 
parish pastor. He was then sent to tbe grammar school at Clinton, 
New York, where he remained for two years ; and when, in the autumn 
of 1825, his teacher, Mr. Charles Avery, accepted a place in Fairfield 
Academy, young Gray followed his instructor to that place, where for 
four years he pursued elementary mathematical and classical studies. 
Connected with the Fairfield Academy was a medical school which 
enjoyed a high reputation, and was attended by two hundred students, 
a large number for that time. Dr. James Hadley, the professor of Ma- 
teria Medica and Chemistry in the Medical School, also gave some in-

striiction in the acadciii}^, and it was probably through his intincnise 
that Gray's attention was first strongly drawn towards natural science. 
Aj)parently, he was not at first so much interested in j^lants as in miner- 
als ; and it was not until towards the close of his course in the acad- 
emy that his passion for plants was aroused by reading the article on 
botany in the Edinburgh Encyclojiedia, and his delight the following 
spring at being able to make out with the aid of Eaton's Manual the 
scientific name of the common Glaytonia is now a well known story. 

Following his father's wish, which probably was in accord with his 
own inclination, he decided to study medicine, and formally entered the 
Fairfield Medical School in 1829, although for two years previously, 
while a student in the academy, he had attended some of the medical 
lectures. The sessions of the medical school, like those of the acad- 
emy, hardly occupied more than six months of the year, and the re- 
mainder of the time was spent in study with diflerent physicians in the 
neighborhood of iSauquoit, one of whom, Dr. John F. Trowbridge, of 
Bridgewater, was a man of good scientific attainments. He was thus in 
an excellent position for collecting, and even before he graduated he 
had brought together a considerable herbarium, and had entered into 
correspondence with Dr. Lewis C. Beck, of Albany, and Dr. John Tor- 
rey, of New York, who aided him in the determination of his plants. 
He received his doctor's degree at Fairfield on February 1, 1831. He 
never, however, entered upon the practice of medicine ; but after re- 
ceiving his degree he became instructor in chemistry, mineralogy, and 
botany in Bartlett's High School at Utica, New York, and taught 
those subjects, for a part of the year, from the autumn of 1831 to 1835. 

The first actual record of any public lectures on botany given by him 
is found in a circular of the Fairfield Medical School, dated January, 
1832, in which the following statement is made: "Asa Gray, M. 1)., 
will give a course of lectures and practical illustrations on botany, 
to commence [in June] and continue the same time with the lectures 
on chemistry [six weeks]. Fee, $4." This course was attended 
apparently by ten persons ; for he states that he spent the $40 earned 
from these lectures in making a botanical excursion to Niagara Falls. 
It appears to be the case however that in the previous year, just after 
graduation, he had given a few lectures on botany in the medical 
school, in the absence of the regular instructor. Dr. Beck; and a little 
later, he gave another course of lectures on mineralogy and botany at 
Hamilton College, Clinton. During other intermissions of his work at 
Bartlett's school, he made mineralogical and botanical excursions to 
different parts of New York and New Jersey; and it was while liv- 
ing at Utica that he published in the American Journal of Science of 
October, 1833, his first scientific paper on new mineral localities in 
northern New York, written in connection with Dr. J. B. Crawe. 

In the autumn of 1833, having leave of absence from Bartlett's School, 
he accepted the position of assistant to Prof. John Torrey, in thechem- 



ASA GRAY. 765 

ical laboratory of the jMedical School of New York. His time was 
here mainly occupied in botanical studies ; and, besides aiding Dr. 
Torrey in his botanical work, he ])repared and published several original 
papers of his own, of which his memoir on Rhynchospora may be said 
to be his first contribution to descriptive botany. His connection with 
Bartlett's School ended early in 1835, and, although the financial con- 
dition of the New York Medical School did not permit his continuing 
as assistant of Dr. Torrey, he returned to New York in the autumn of 
1835, and accepted the position of curator and librarian of the Lyceum 
of Natural History, a position which gave him leisure for continuing 
his botanical studies, and to prepare his first text-book, '' Elements of 
Botany," which appeared in 1836. 

About this time a Government expedition, since known as the Wilkes 
Exploring Expedition, was fitting out, and the i>osition of botanist of 
the expedition was offered to Dr. Gray in the summer of 1836. The 
expedition did not sail, however, until two years later ; and meanwhile, 
wearied by the numerous delays and uncertainties about the manage- 
ment of the expedition. Dr. Gray resigned his position and settled in 
New York, where, in comj)any with Dr. Torrey, he worked energetically 
on the preparation of the earlier parts of the " Flora," of which the 
first two parts appeared in October, 1838. While occupied in this work, 
a new State University had been founded in Michigan, and Dr. Gray 
accepted the chair of botany which was offered to him, with the under- 
standing that he should be allowed to spend a year abroad in study 
before beginning his official duties. 

The elaboration of the new "Flora" made it necessary for him to 
examine the types of American plants in foreign herbaria; and in 
November, 1838, he started on the journey which was not only to give 
him the means of clearing up much of the existing confusion with re- 
gard to the identity of previously described North American species, 
but, what was more important, was to bring him into close scientific 
and social relations with the botanical lights of a generation now long 
past, and with those who were then the young men of promise, a brill- 
iant group, of which Sir J. D. Hooker and A. De Candolle are now 
almost the only survivors. 

He returned to America in November, 1839, but never assumed the 
duties of professor at Michigan. He was absorbed in his work on the 
" F'lora," and refreshed and stimulated by what he had seen and heard 
abroad, he was pushingrapidly ahead with the second volume, of which 
he wrote the greatei** portion, and at the same time printing a " Bo- 
tanical Text-Book," which was to form the basis of his many subse- 
quent text-books, when he was invited to Cambridge to fill the newly 
endowed chair of the Fisher Professorship of Natural History in Har- 
vard College. 

He accepted, and in 1842 took up his residence in Cambridge. The 
secoTJd volume of the '' Flora " was completed the following year. He

was at once favorably received in learned and social circles of Cam- 
bridge and Boston; and when delivering a conrse of lectures at the 
Lowell Institute, he first became acquainted with Miss Jane Lathrop 
Loring, daughter of Mr. Charles Greely Loring of Boston, to whom he 
was married on May 4, 1848. From this time his energies were devoted 
to building up a botanical establishment at Cambridge — for what was 
in existence before 1842 hardly deserves mention — and to the complo. 
tion of a " Flora of North America." The number of collectors and 
explorers had by this time greatly increased, and the material they had 
brought together contained so much that was new, that it was plain 
that the original plan of the " Flora " must be changed, for the two 
volumes already published had hardly appeared when a revision seemed 
necessary. It was not until many years later, in 1878, that the first part 
of the new " Flora'" appeared ; and he continued to labor toward the 
completion of his great work until death forced him to relinquish the 
unfinished task. 

He continued in the exercise of the active duties of lecturer and 
instructor until 1872, when he was relieved of this charge by the ap- 
pointment of a colleague, Prof. G-. L. Goodale ; but he gave occasional 
lectures in the college for a few years longer. In 1873 he resigned his 
ofiice of Director of the Botanic Garden, and Prof. C. S. Sargent was 
appointed his successor. He retained the title of Fisher Professor and 
Director of the Herbarium until his death, although he was in part 
relieved of the responsibilities of the latter position by the appoint- 
ment of Mr. Sereno Watson as Curator of the Herbarium in 1874. 

His long residence and arduous labors at Cambridge were varied and 
relieved by several journeys, some of which were of considerable extent, 
and all of which were made to contribute to the advancement of work 
on the "Flora," either by enabling him to examine in the field the 
plants which he was studying, or by examination of foreign herbaria, 
and consultations with leading foreign botanists. He made three trips 
to California, in 1872, in 1877, when he was in company with Sir J. D. 
Hooker, and in 1885, Miien he visited not only southern California and 
the great Colorado Canon, but journeyed into Mexico as far as Orizaba 
and Cordoba. He was once in Florida, in 1875, and made, besides, 
several trips to the mountains of North Carolina, where he botanized at 
diiferent times with his botanical friends, Sullivan, Carey, Engelmann, 
Canby, and Redfield. 

He made in all six journeys to Europe, including the journey already 
mentioned and a short business trip of six we#ks to Paris in the sum- 
mer of 1855. On the other journeys he was accompanied by Mrs. (ira3^ 
When abroad, he always spent much of his time with the English 
botanists, among whom he counted many warm personal friends; and 
he looked forward with special pleasure to his visits at Kew, where he 
was welcomed by the director. Sir W. J. Hooker, and by his son and 
successor, Sir J. D. Hooker, for forty years his intimate friend, whose

opinion in botanical matters lie esteemeil more highly than that of any 
of his contemporaries. In his second journey, from June, 1S50, to 
August, 1851, he traveled through France, Germany, and Holland, 
and spent two months with Bentham at his home in Herefordshire, 
studying the plants of the Wilkes Expedition, upon which he was then 
working. The fourth journey, from September, 18G8, to 2^'ovember, 
18U9, was undertaken at a time when he was much overworked, and 
he spent the winter in Egypt, that country being almost the only spot 
where there was nothing to tempt him to botanize, besides visiting 
Italy, France, Germany, and England. The event of the journey of 
September, 1880, to November, 1881, was a trip to Spain, a country 
where he obtained much relief from Botany. 

His last journey, on which he started in 1887, was a triumphant 
fiirewell, in which were heaped upon him honors bestowed on few 
naturalists. He visited friends in France, Austria, and Germany ; 
stopped at Geneva to see Ue Candolle, his life-long friend, older by 
four years than himself, and sorrowfully bade him what both must have 
felt to be a last farewell; then hurried back from the continent to 
receive the doctor's degree from the three great British Universities, 
and to attend the meeting of the British Association at Manchester. 
Here he saw many old friends, and met for the first time three of Ger- 
many's most distinguished botanists — Cohn, Priugsheim, and the 
lamented De Bary, whose untimely death was to come but a few days 
before his own. At Manchester he was brought into contact with a 
large number of young botanists, who were charmed with his genial 
manner, and astonished at his well preserved vigor of body, as well as 
mind. He returned to America in October, apparently in perfect 
health, and resumed active labor on the "Flora;" but while busied 
with the preparation of the Vitacew for that work, he was suddenly 
stricken with paralysis, on the morning of November 28, and lingeretl 
in a partially conscious condition until the evening of January 30, 
when he passed calmly away. 

By the death of Asa Gray this academy has lost a member whose 
activity and zeal were unceasing, and whose brilliant talents as a scien- 
tific writer, not surpassed by those of any of the illustrious names on 
our roll, added much to the reputation of the society at home and abroad. 
Elected a corresponding member in 1841, he became an active member 
in 1812, on his settlement in Cambridge, and served as corresponding 
secretary from 1844 to ISoO, and again from 1852 to 1803, and as presi- 
dent from 1863 to 1873. During this long membership of more than 
forty years his attendance was always exemplary. The storms of 
winter and the inclemencies of spring, which kept younger men at 
home, did not prevent his coming from the remote Botanic Garden 
regularly to attend the meetings. Although an honorary member of 
most of the learned societies of this country, and of many of the most 
prominent societies of Europe, including the Royal Society of Loiulon, 



768 BIOGRAPHICAL m?:moirs. 

the French Academy, and the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg, of 
which he was one of the very few Americans who have been elected 
corresponding members, this Academy was the society in which he 
felt the greatest interest and was most at home. 

There are few volumes of our Proceedings which do not contain im- 
portant communications from his pen. One of the earliest of his works, 
the " Chloris Boreali- Americana," was printed in the third volume of the 
Academy's Memoirs, in 1846 5 and to subsequent volumes he contributed 
"Plant* Fendlerianse Novi-Mexicanfe," presented in l^ovember, 1848; 
"PlantfeXova) Thurberiaune," and "-Noteou the Affinities of the Genus 
Vavcea, Benth., also of Rhytidandra, Gray," August and October, 1854; 
and a group of four papers, entitled " Botanical Memoirs," in 1859, in- 
cluding one " On the Botany of Japan, and its Relations to that of 
Nortli America " — a remarkable essay on the geographical distribution 
of plants, which stamped the author as worthy to rank with the great 
botanists of the world. We need not enumerate his many papers 
which have appeared in the Proceedings of the Academy, for they alone 
would fill several volumes. It was his custom to embody the results 
of his preliminary studies on the North American tiora in the form of 
notes on critical species, descriptions of novelties, and monographs of 
genera, and sometimes orders, of which by far the greater part first 
appeared in our Proceedings, usually under the heading of "Botanical 
Contributions," a long and very valuable series, dating from the paper 
"On some New Composifw from Texas," presented December 1, 1840, 
and ending with the posthumous "Notes upon some Polypetalous 
Genera and Orders," presented April 19, 1888. Nor should we forget 
the many biographical notices in which he commemorated the lives and 
works of others with an appreciating discrimination, written in a man- 
ner peculiarly his own. 

The botanical department of Harvard University was practically 
created by Asa Gray. In 1805 a small botanic garden was established 
at Cambridge, under the auspices and by the aid of the Massachusetts 
Society for Promoting Agriculture, and William Dandridge Peck was 
appointed director and professor of botany. In 1818 he printed a " Cat 
alogue of American and Foreign Plants cultivated in the Botanic Gar- 
den, Cambridge," in which one thousand three hundred and nine species 
were enumerated ; but the list included some common cryptogams found 
everywhere, and a large number of ph.Tuogamic shrubs and weeds, 
common natives of the region, hardly to be counted as legitimate mem- 
bers of a botanic garden. Professor Peck died in 1822, when, owing 
to the low state of the funds, a professor was not appointed, but Thomas 
Nuttall, the well-known botanist and ornithologist, was appointed 
curator of the garden, and later, lecturer on botany. This amiable, 
but very reticent naturalist — who apparently did not find his residence 
in Cambridge very congenial (for he describes himself as vegetating 
like his plants),— resigned his position in 1833, and returned to Phila-

delpbia. The pfarden, such as it was, was then put under the charge 
of William Carter, a gardener, and the lectures oa botany were given 
by T. W. Harris, the well-known entomologist and librarian of the 
college, and Dr. A. A. Gould, of Boston. Not long before 1842, the 
directorship of the garden was oflered to Mr. George B. Emerson, of 
Boston, who declined the position soon afterwards accepted by Dr. 
Gray in connection willi the Fisher professorship. 

On Dr. Gray's accession there was no herbarium, no library, only 
one insignificant greenhouse, and a garden all in confusion, with few 
plants of value. In 1844 he moved into the house which had been 
built for Professor Peck in the Garden, and with his characteristic 
energy he soon brought together an herbarium and library, and ar- 
ranged the Garden systematically. At the time of his marriage a 
small wing was added to the house, of which the lower story served 
as a stud}' and herbarium until 1864. But the plants soon overran 
the limits of the herbarium, and finally the wbole house was crammed 
with plants — plants in the dining-room, in the attic, in the closets, 
and in the bedrooms; for whatever he could spare from a salarj- of 
$1,000 at first, and $1,600 afterwards, was spent on his herbarium 
and library. In 1864, dreading the danger from fire to a collection 
kept in a wooden house, he ofiered to present his collections to the 
college, on condition that a suitable building should be erected for 
their reception. Through the liberality of Mr. Nathaniel Thayer of 
Boston, a brick building to be used as an herbarium and library was 
erected in 1864, at a cost of $12,000; and mainly through the agency 
of Mr. G. B. Emerson, a further sum of $10,000 was raised, the income 
of which was to be used in defraying the current expenses of the her- 
barium. From a letter by Dr. Gray to the president of the university, 
dated November 20, 1864, and a notice in the American Journal of 
Science, of March, 1865, we learn that the herbarium then contained at 
least 200,000 specimens, and the library about 2,200 botanical works, 
not including a good many pamphlets. There was also a set of 335 
very costly illustrated works, contributed by Mr. John A. Lowell. 

Since 1864 the herbarium has been constantly* enlarged, principally 
by exchanges, of which those from the Kew Herbarium especially were 
of very great value ; so that it is now probably twice as large as in 1864, 
and forms practically a National Herbarium, for it is by far the largest 
and most valuable herbarium in America, and is excelled in size by but 
few of the older and richer herbaria of Europe, as those at Kew, Paris, 
Berlin, the De CandoUe Herbarium at Geueva, and possibly that at St. 
Petersburg. In the representation of the ph;i?nogams of North America 
outside the tropics, it is probably unequalled by any herbarium except 
that at Kew. The library at the time of Professor's Gray's death was 
roughly estimated to contain something over 5,000 volumes and 3,000 
pam|)hlets, but these figures are |)rohably too low. Many of the addi- 
tions since 1864 are the gift of Dr. Gray. In building up this vast 
H. Mis. 142 49

collection, he save not ouly much of his time aud thought, but also an 
actual sum of money, which comes well up in the thousands, and, to 
crown all, manifested his devotion to the welfare and perpetnation of 
the collection by bequeathing to the university for its support the 
royalties on his publications. 

The Garden during his administration was improved by the addition 
of several greenhouses, in which were cultivated a choice selection of 
exotics, aud the rather limited space of the Garden itself was filled with 
good representatives of the flora of the temperate regions, the collec- 
tion of eompositw being especially important. In the absence of a suf- 
ficient endowment, activity on the part of the director had to replace the 
want of money, and he, utilizing the means at hand, succeeded in mak- 
ing the Garden an exceedingly important means of exchange between 
foreign establishments aud our own botanists and collectors. European 
botanists who visited the Garden wondered how, from such a small and 
ill-endowed establishment, so much had been done in aid of other insti- 
tutions. The explanation lay in the skill and energy of Dr. Gray 
himself. 

Gray's work as a teacher extended over a period of more than fifty 
years, dating from the first lectures on botany at the Fairtield Medical 
School, in 1831 and 1832, and the publication of his "Elements of 
Botany," in 1836. During that period he trained up a whole race of 
botanists, now scattered through all parts of the United States, so that 
wherever he went he was greeted by those who rembered his instruc- 
tion with pleasure. When at Santa Barbara in 1885, an elderly man, 
who seemed to be about his own age, introduced himself as a former pupil 
in his first class at Harvard. As a college lecturer he was not seen at 
his best, for his somewhat hesitating manner wjien he spoke extempora- 
neously was unfavorably contrasted \^ ith the fervid, almost impetuous 
utterance of Agassiz, aud the clear exposition and dignified address of 
Jefiries Wyman, his two great contemporaries at Harvard. In his jmblic 
addresses he always spoke from notes', and, especially in his later years, 
his strikingly expressive face commanded the attention of his hearers 
from the start. In the classroom he was personally much liked, aud 
he made a strong impression on the majority of students, although, in 
the days when every student was forced to study botany, there were 
of course some who would not have cared for the subject under any cir- 
cumstances. The instruction, as was natural, bearing in mind his own 
early training and the state of botany in this country at the time when 
he became professor at Harvard, was confined mainly to the morpho- 
logical study of flowering plants; for he recognized that, until some ad- 
vance had been made in that direction, it was out of the question deal- 
ing adequately with the more technically complicated subjects of his- 
tology, end)ryology, aiul physiology. 

For the instruction which he was obliged to give, the resources of 
the garden and the herbarium and the ordinary college lecture-l'ooms 



ASA GRAY. 771 

at firist sufficed, but at last it becauie necessary to provide a special 
laboratory aud lecture-room at the garden. A liberal friend of Dr. 
Gray aad the college presented a sum of money for this purpose, and 
in 1872 a wing was added to the herbarium. About this time the de- 
maud for laboratory instruction and equipment increased rapidly, and 
the new lecture-room and laboratory were soon found to be inadequate 
to meet the needs of the increasing calls for microscopic and physio- 
logical work, and they were at length abandoned. It is not surprising 
that Dr. Gray could not foresee how great the growth in this direction 
was to be even in his own life. Probably no person of his age could 
have foreseen it. 

His herbarium was, at one period or another, the resort ot nearly all 
the active working botanists of the country, and thither came many 
young men who were afterwards to aid in the development of botanical 
studies in the United States. His intercourse with them was always 
free and unrestrained by formalities of any kind, and he seemed more 
like a learned friend than a teacher. Passing to and fro from his own 
study to the herbarium he greeted all cordially, watching and criticising 
sharply but good-naturedly the work that was going on. ISIo one en- 
enjoyed a hearty laugh more than he, and every now and then he would 
brighten the work by some anecdote from the large stock which his re- 
tentive memory ever had at hand ; always however for the purpose of 
emphasizing some point or illustrating some fact which he wished to 
bring out more clearly, but never allowing the attention of those about 
him to be distracted from their work. Life at the herbarium was in- 
deed a pleasure, aud the more serious work was well seasoned and 
spiced in the days when the agile assistant, Charles Wright, skipped 
about like a squirrel, his diminutive body in Cambridge, his larger mind 
wandering away in his beloved Cuba and the Pacific islaiuls, — when 
Brewer, less continent than his teacher in the matter of anecdote, saw in 
every plant before him some episode of his own life in camp. The ap- 
proach of Dr. Gray, heralded by his cheery laugh, or perhaps by a 
mild anathema agaiust the gardener, who every morning, regardless of 
the intentions of nature, deluged the cacti placed in the corridor, we all 
understood to meau business, for, if joking was allowed, trifling was not. 
Wo learned something about botanists as well as about botany, and 
often wondered whether Robert Brown were really as great as he was 
represented ; and, on the rare occasions of a visit from a man like Dr. 
Torrey or Dr. Engelnuinn, we asked ourselves whether there was any 
chance that the younger generation of botanists would bear any com- 
parison with the older. None who have worked under Dr. Gray at the 
herbarium will forget the deep personal interest he always manifested 
in their work and future prospects. He always encouraged and stimu- 
lated without holding out false hoj)es. To those who wished to devote 
thenjselves to botany in the years still recent, when it was scar(;ely 
possible for a botanist to live by botany alone, he used to say : " Study 



772 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 

medicine, and if you then still want to be a botanist, go ahead. Your 
medicine will keep your botany from starving." 

Great as was the direct influence of Dr. Gray upon the students with 
whom he came in contact, his influence on the development of botany 
in this country through the medium of his numerous text-books and 
manujils was even more important. His first textbook, " Elements of 
Botany," written when he was only twenty-six years old, shows many 
of tlie best characteristics of bis later works, being written in a 
smooth, graceful style, with the different topics clearly and methodically 
arranged. The vigorous defense of the natural system of classifica- 
tion, which now appears superfluous, indicates that the author of 183G 
was a progressive young man, who had shaken off the conservatism 
which prevailed among American botanists of that period. That he 
was young and inexperienced is occasionally shown, as in the amusing 
statement tbat "the herbarium of a diligent botanist will ])ass so fre- 
quently under his observation that any very extensiveravages [by insects] 
can hardly take place without his being aware of it in time to cbeck the 
progress of the destroyers." He evidently had no conception of how 
large his own collection would become in a few years. 

The "Elements" of 1836 developed into the "Botanical Text-Book" 
of 1842, in which the portion relating to systematic botany was much 
more fully treated than in the earlier volume. The latter editions, 
which appeared at intervals until 1879, are familiar to every one, for 
they have been the means of opening the world of botany to more than 
one generation of American botanists. In 1868 the "Lebrbucnder 
Botanik, " by Sachs, appeared. That work was a genuine revelation, 
showing the advance which had been made by experts in the science 
of botany, and, although somewhat above the capacity of the common 
student, it was destined to produce in a few years a revolution in the 
method of botanical instruction. 

Recognizing the new era which had opened in botany, Dr. Gray re- 
vised the plan of the " Text-Book," with a view of bringing it into accord 
with the more widely developed science of the day, and in 1871) issued 
the first volume of the revised work, in which he included the Mor- 
phology of Phasnogams, Taxonomy, and Phytography, thus covering 
the greater part of the ground of the original " Text-Book," intrusting 
to his colleague. Professor Goodale, the volume on Physiological Bot- 
any, (which appeared in 1885— a worthy companion of its predecessor,) 
and to the writer the volume on Cryptogams, He hoped, but hardly 
could have expected, to write a fourth volume, on the Orders of Phse- 
nogamous Plants. It is deeply to be regretted that he was never able 
to write this volume, for it would have enabled him to present the gen- 
eral views on classification derived from a long and exceptionally rich 
experience. No better text-book on the subject had ever been written 
in the English langnage than Gray's "Text-llook" in the original form; 
and, although botanical instruction is now very (iiflerent from what it

used to be, it is still true thiit, as an introductiou to the study of Phse- 
Mograms, the group to which beginners uaturally turn their attention, 
the later " Struetnral Botany," is likely to hold its own for some time to 
come. In 1887, jnst before he started on his last European journey, he 
finished a small book giving in an abbreviated form the substance of 
the Structural Botany, as well as some chapters on Cryptogams ; and 
for this, his latest text-book, he revived the title of his earliest work, 
" Elements of Botany. " 

The '' Manual of the Botany of the Northern United States, " of 
which the first edition appeared in 1847, needs no words of praise here. 
There are probably few members of the Academy who do not own, or 
have not at some time owned, a copy of this model work. Occasionally 
some overwise person has discovered that certain plants grow a few 
inches taller or bloom a few days earlier than is stated in the " Man- 
ual " ; but the botanist is yet to be born who could write a more clear, 
accurate, and compact account of the flora of any country. The only 
regret is that he could not have written manuals for all parts of the 
country. 

Dr. Gray had the rare faculty of being able to adapt himself to all 
classes of readers. With the scientific he was learned, to the student 
he was instructive and suggestive, and he charmed the general reader 
by the graceful beauty of his style, while to children he was simplicity 
itself. The little books, " How Plants Grow," and " How Plants Be- 
have," fouiul their way where botany as botany could not have gained 
an entrance, and they set in motion a current which moved in the gen- 
eral direction of a higher science with a force which can hardly be esti- 
mated. His scientific friends, especially those abroad, sometimes 
blamed him for spending time in popular writing ; but he may have 
understood himself and his surroundings better than they. With him 
botany was a pleasure as w^ell as a business. Few wrote as easily as 
he, and, so long as he spent most of his time in higher work, he cer- 
tainly had a right to amuse himself with writings of a popular char- 
acter if he chose. As it was, he interested a multitude of readers in 
the subjects which ho had at heart, and if he was not permitted to live 
to see the completion of his greatest work, "The Synoptical Flora," he 
at least was able to leave the work at a jioint where it could be con- 
tinued by a trusted friend in syiupathy with all his plans. 

As a reviewer he was certainly extraordinary. Some of his reviews 
were in reality elaborate essays, in which, taking the work of another 
as a text, he presented his own views on important topics in a masterly 
manner. Others were technically critical, while some were simply 
concise and very clear summaries of lengthy works. Taken collectively, 
they show better than any other of his writings the literary excellence 
of his style, as well as his great fertility and his fairness and acuteness as 
a critic. Never unfair, never ill-natured, his sharp criticism, like the

surgeon's knife, aimed not to wound, but to curej and if he sometimes 
felt it his duty to be severe, he never failed to praise what was worthy. 
The number of his reviews and notices written during his connection 
with the American Journal of Science as editor and assistant editor for 
over thirty years, and for the North American Eeview, the Nation, the 
Atlantic Monthly, aud numerous other journals, is enormous, and it 
almost seems as if he must have written notices of the greater j^art of all 
the botanical works he had ever read. Those intimately acquainted 
with him more than half believed that he was able to write good notices 
of books written in languages which he could not read. He was able, 
as if by instinct, to catch the spirit and essence of what he read, without 
any exertion on his part. One who wrote so much might have become 
monotonous. But he was never prosy, and his style was so easy and 
flowing, and so constantly enlivened by sprightly allusions and pleasing 
metaphors, that one could read what he wrote for the mere pleasure of 
the reading. His was one of the rare cases where Science had appro- 
priated to herself one who would have been an ornament to any purely 
literary profession. 

It would be presumption were we to express an opinion on the posi- 
tion of Gray as a scientific botanist. Fortunately for us, it is unnec- 
essary. The greatest living systematic botanist, Sir J. D. Hooker, the 
one by his attainments aud position fitted above all others to speak 
with authority on the subject, has already recorded his opinion in the 
following words : 

When the history of the progress of botany during the nineteenth 
century shall be written, two names will hold high positions : those of 
Prof. Augustin Pyrame De Candolle and of Prof. Asa Oray. - - - 
Each devoted half a century of unremitting labor to the investigation 
and description of the plants of continental areas, and they founded 
herbaria and libraries, each in his own country, which have become per- 
manent and quasi-national institutions. - - - There is much in 
their lives and works that recalls the career of Linnaeus, of whom they 
were worthy disciples, in the comi)rehensiveness of their labor, the ex- 
cellence of their methods, their judicious conception of the limits of 
genera and species, the terseness and accuracy of their descriptions, 
and the clearness of their scientific language. 

The accuracy of the resemblance of Gray and De Candolle, so admi- 
rably and justly expressed by Hooker, will be recognized by all botan- 
ists. Gray was the De Candolle of America, whose mission it was to 
bring together the scattered and crude works of the earlier explorers 
and botanists and the vast unwrought material of his owni day, and to 
combine them with his surpassing skill into one grand comprehensive 
work which should fitly describe the flora of a continent. But while 
recognizing the resemblance between De Candolle and Gray in their 
mode of work and the purpose for w hich they strove, we can only mar 
vel how it was possible for a poor farmer's boy in America, without a 
university education, to become the peer of one of Europe's best trained 
botanists. 



ASA GRAY. 775 

From his training; and early siirrouii(liu<ifs we might have expected 
bira to be energetic and original, but we should not have expected to 
find him highly polished and cultured. His associates at Fairfield and 
Clinton were persons of scientitic tastes, and, even if their attainments 
were not of the highest quality, they encouraged his fondness for nat- 
ural history. But it is not easy to see how he obtained the literary 
training which enabled him to write with the ease and elegance found 
even in his earlier works, for although a man may by nature be a good ob- 
server of natural objects, a finished style comes only with training and 
experience. From his teacher, Avery, he could not have received much 
in the way of training; for Dr. Gray himself says that he did not give 
him the sharp drilling and testing which was needed. His residence 
with the Torrey family in New York tirst placed him in a society where 
literary excellence as well as scientific knowledge was prized ; and while 
he profited by the accuracy and strict scientific methods of Dr. Torrey, 
then the foremost American botanist, the frequent conversations and 
kindly criticism of Mrs. Torrey made good many of the literary defi- 
ciencies of his early training. He was also aided while in New York by 
the criticisms and suggestions made on some of his earlier manuscripts 
by the cultured botanist, Mr. John Carey. But he must have been an 
apt pupil, for, while still with Dr. Torrey, he showed that in point of 
clearness and accuracy he was not much inferior to his highly respected 
teacher, and in the second volume of the "Flora" he proved himself to 
be quite his equal. 

The plan of the "Flora ofNorth America" originated with Dr. Torrey; 
but when his pupil went to (Cambridge to assume the duties of his new 
I)Osition, neither of them suspected the magnitude of the task which 
they had undertaken, nor the modifications which the plan must ulti- 
mately undergo. The pupil was now in a more fortunate position than 
his teacher, for Gray was henceforth able to devote himself to his fa- 
vorite science, while Dr. Torrey could only employ his leisure hours in 
botany. The two volumes of the original Torrey and Gray "Flora" 
will always remain a memorial of the unbroken friendship of America's 
two greatest botanists, alike in the spirit which animated their work 
and in the reverent simplicity of their characters. 

The greater part of Gray's scientific work during the thirty-five years 
following the completion of the second volume of Torrey and Gray's 
" Flora," in 1843, had a more or less direct bearing on the contemplated 
revision and enlargement of that work. Besides the papers printed in 
the Academy's publications, he wrote a very large number of nu)no- 
graphs and notes on points connecte<l with the determination and de- 
scription of new and doubtful species. They are scattered through the 
proceedings of different learned societies, and the columnsof the Amer- 
ican Journal of Science, the Torrey Bulletin, Botanical Gazette, the 
Naturalist, ami other American as well as European journals. One 
of his most im])ortant works was "(ienera Fh)r;e America* Boreali- 



776 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 

Orieutiilis Tllnstnita" (18l8-'49), in which he iiiteiuled to figure and 
describe all the genera of the Eastern States, with the aid of the artist, 
Mr. Isaac Sprague. Of this work onl^- two of the proposed volumes 
were ever published, owing to the expense entailed. Other important 
l)apers were "Planttie Wrightiana? Texano-Neo-Mexicanai," in the Smith- 
sonian contributions of 1852 and 1853; "Plantse Liudheimeriauje," 
written in connection with Dr. Engelmann ; "Reports on the Botany of 
the 32d, 38tli, 39th, and 41st Parallel Expeditions," in connection with 
Dr. Torrey 5 Gamopetake in Watson's Flora of California, etc. An ex- 
amination of the complete list of his works, which will soon be printed 
in the American Journal of Science, would alone convey an adequate 
idea of his extraordinary fertility as a writer and the wide range of his 
investigations. 

After this long preparation of thirt^^-flve years, the first part of the 
" Synoptical Elora," including the Gamopetake after GomposiUe, ap- 
peared, in 1878. It formed the first part of the second volume ; for, on 
the revised plan, the first volume was to include the Polypetake and 
Gamopetakv through Gompositw, and the second volume the remaining 
Exogens and the Endogens. A second part, including from Gaprifoli- 
aceo) through Gomposita', appeared in 1881, and in 1880 supplements to 
both parts were issued, and the whole bound in one volume. He was at 
work on the PolypetaJm, and had nearly finished the Vitacece, when 
attacked by his last illness, and the unfinished volumes must now be 
completed by him who was his associate for many years, and, after Dr. 
Gray himself, the best fitted for the work. 

Gray's critical knowledge of the Flora of North America not only 
placed him at the head of all American botanists, but also gave him a 
high reputation abroad. In his knowledge of the difficult order Gom- 
positce^ the largest of all the orders of flowering plants, and the one in 
which he always felt the most interest, he probably surpassed any liv- 
ing botanist. He was at one time urged by Bentham and Hooker to 
treat that order in their classic " Genera Plantarum," but, as the work 
involved a residence at Kew for a considerable time, he was obliged to 
decline the ofter. 

It was however more especially through his observations on the 
geographical distribution of plants made incidentally during the prog- 
ress of his work on our own flora, that he was recognized as a natu- 
ralist of the highest type by the scientific circles of Europe. When 
we consider the marked capacity for studies of this nature which he 
afterwards exhibited, remembering the brilliant contributions to Plant 
Geography which resulted from the explorations of Robert Brown, 
Darwin, and Hooker, we can only regret that Gray did not sail as 
botanist of the Wilkes Expedition. The collectors of the expedition. 
Dr. Charles Pickering, W. D. Brackenridge, and William Rich, brought 
back many interesting plants, of which the Phieuogams, excepting those 
from the Pacific coast of America sent to Dr. Torrey, were placed in

bis luinds for description. But Gray would have been more than a col- 
lector. He would have brought back impressions, and, recalling the 
charuiing narrative of the illustrious naturalist of the Beagle, we can 
imagine the pleasure with which we should have read the journal of a 
botanist, written with the delicate humor and the keen appreciation of 
the beautiful and curious in nature which Asa Gray possessed. 

The study of the Wilkes plants, in which he was aided by Bentham's 
large experience, gracefully acknowledged iu his Memorial of Bentham 
in the American Journal of Science of February, 1885, introduced him 
to an exotic flora or large range. The work appeared in 1854 as a quarto 
volume of nearly eight hundred pages, with an atlas of a hundred folio 
plates. 

Ilis first paper* on the distribution of plants appeared in the Ameri- 
can Journal of Science of September, 1856, and was followed by two 
other parts the next year. It bore the title of "Statistics of the Flora 
of the northern United States," and was prepared at the time he was at 
work on a second edition of the "Manual," partly in response to a re- 
quest from Darwin for a list of American alpine plants. In this paper 
he gave a general view of the characteristics of the Korth American 
flora, with tables of species showing the extension of alpine plants and 
the comparative distribution of Eastern and Western species, and their 
relation to species of Europe and Asia, although he states that he must 
defer making an extended comparison with the plants of northeastern 
Asia until he has studied some recent collections from the northern 
part of Japan. The most important conclusions reached in this paper 
may be stated in his own words: "All our strictly subalpine species 
(with two exceptions), which are common to us and to Europe, extend 
northward along the central region of the continent quite to the arctic 
sea-coast, while curiously enough eleven, or one-third of our strictly 
alpine species common to Europe — all but one of them arctic in the 
Old World — are not known to cross the arctic circle on this continent. 
This, howev^er, might perhaps have been expected, as it seems almost 
certain that the interchange of alpine species between us and Europe 
must have taken place in the direction of Newfoundland, Labrador, and 
Greenland rather than through the polar regions." Again: "The 
special resemblance of our flora to that of Europe, it is clear, is not 
owing simply either to the large proportion of genera in common, or 
to anything striking or important in the few genera, nearly or quite 
peculiar to the two. The latter, indeed, are insignificant in our flora 
and not to be compared, as to any features they impart, with the much 
more numerous and really characteristic genera which are shared by 
the eastern United States and eastern temperate Asia. We must

tribution of plants in the Ain<'ricau Jonrnal of Science of an earlier date than the one

look for it in the species, partly iu the identical ones and partly in 
those which closely answer to each other in the two floras." He acconn ts 
for such cases as the occurrence of Phryma leptostachya in the United 
States and Nepal as follows: "We should therefore look in one and the 
same direction for the explanation of these extraordinary no less than 
of the more ordinary cases of distribution, and should - - - refer 
such anomalous distribution to very ancient dispersion." 

The plants from Japan to which he referred were collected by 
Charles Wright, botanist of the North Pacific Exploring Expedition, 
known as the Ringgold and Rodgers Expedition, of which Dr. Gray gave 
an account in a paper " On the Botany of Japan, and its Relations to 
that of North America and of other Parts of the Northern Temperate 
Zone," presented to this academy December 14, 1858, and January 11, 
1859, and published April 25, 1859, in the sixth volume of the Memoirs. 
This memoir raised his reputation to its highest point among scientific 
men, and, appealing again to the authority of Sir J. D. Hooker, "in point 
of originality and far-reaching results was its author's opus magmim." 
In referring to his previous paper in the American Journal, he states, 
with great candor, that, from the facts there brought out, " (1) that a 
large percentage of our extra-European types are shared with eastern 
Asia, and (2) that no small part of them are unknown in western North 
America." Mr. Bentham was the first to state the natural conclusion 
that the interchange between the temperate floras even of the western 
part of the Old World and of the New has mainly taken place via Asia. 
He cites Bentham's suggestion of a continuity of territory between 
America and Asia " under a latitude, or at any rate with a climate, more 
meridional than would be effected by a junction through the chains of 
the Aleutian and the Kurile Islands." He then proceeds to show why 
a connection in a more meridional latitude need not be assumed: and, 
fortified by the wide geological knowledge of his friend, Prof. J. D. Dana, 
he gives a masterly account of the relations of the floras of the north 
temperate regions from the Cretaceous i)eriod to the ])resent time, ac- 
counting for the present distribution by migrations of species from the 
arctic regions due principally to the different climatic conditions of the 
pre-glacial, glacial, and post-glacial eras. The relations of the floras of 
eastern America and eastern Asia was a favorite topic with him, and 
he often spoke on the subject in public; his two most important ad- 
dresses in which he referred to plant distribution being that on " Sequoia 
and its History," delivered as retiring president of the American Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Science, in 1872, and a lecture on " Forest 
Geography and Archieology," read before the Harvard Natural History 
Society in 1878, and afterwards translated in the Annales des Sciences. 

The study of plant distribution necessarily involved the question of 
the origin of species, and this brings us to a consideration of the rela- 
tions of Gray to Darwin and Darwinism, Gray first met Darwin at 
Westbank, the residence of Sir W. J. Hooker, at Kew, in 1851; and their

coiTespoiideucc daU'S from a letter of Darwin, written April 25, 1855, 
asking" for information about the alpine plants of the United States. 
How intimate and fre<pient their corresi)ondence became, and how 
deepl^each was interested in the work of the other is admirably shown in 
the "Life and Letters of Charles Darwin." The published letters pre- 
sent a vivid picture of the inner scientific life of these two men, both 
eqnally simple, earnest, remarkably free from prejudice, and anxious to 
<lo justice to the work of others. Many of the problems upon which 
Darwin was at work were those in which Gray was most interested; 
and he was often able to aid Darwin by his observations, and still more 
by his judicious and always acceptable criticisms. While the naturalist 
at Down was absorbed in the stud^' of climbing plants and cross fertili- 
zation, the greenhouses at Cambridge were also used as nurseries for 
the growth of climbers and the odd, irregularly flowered plants which 
ought to be cross-fertilized. The writer recalls the time when Dr. Gray 
hardly ever passed in or out of the herbarium without stroking — patting 
on the the back by way of encouraging them it almost seemed — the 
tendrils of the climbers on the walls and porch; and when, on the an- 
nouncement that a student had discovered another new case of cross- 
fertilization in the garden, he would rush out bareheaded and breathless, 
like a school-boy, to see the thing with his own critical eyes. 

Darwin, in a letter dated June 20, 1856, confided to Gray that he 
had "come to the heterodox conclusion that there are no such things 
as independently created species, — that species are only strongly de- 
fined varieties." In this letter he also says: " I assume that species arise 
like our domestic varieties with much extinction." About a year after 
this (September 5, 1857) Darwin wrote to Gray the now famous letter, 
in which be propounded the law of the evolution of species by means of 
natural selection; and it was this letter, read at the Linuean Society 
July 1, 1858, on the occasion of the presentation of the joint paper of 
Darwin and Wallace "On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; 
and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of 
Selection," which fixed the date of the priority of the great discovery 
as due to Darwin. What were Gray's own views on the subject of 
evolution previous to the publication of the "Origin of Species," in 
November, 1859, may perhaps be inferred from some remarks which he 
made on January 11, 1850, when he presented his paper "On the 
Botany of Japan" to this academy. Ue then stated that "tiie idea of 
the descent of all similar or couspecific individuals from a common 
stock is so natural, and so inevitably suggested by common observa- 
tion, that it must needs be first tried ui)on the problem [of distribution], 
and if the trial be satisfactory its adoption would follow as a matter of 
course." In brief, he was inclined to accept evolution, but wished more 
proof; and nearly three years earlier, in a letter to Professor Dana, 
written December 13, 185G, he had well expressed his own attitude by 
saying, "1 have as yet no opinion whatever, and no very strong bias.^^ 



780 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 

He saw what was coming however, au<^l in a hiter letter to Professor 
Dana, anticipating the publication of the " Origin of Species,'- he says, 
"You may be sure that before long there must be one more resurrection 
of the development theory in a new form, obviating many of the argu- 
ments against it, and presenting a more respectable and more formida- 
ble appearance than it ever has before." 

Gray was one of the favored three, including Hooker and Lyell, to 
whom Darwin sent advance sheets of the "Origin of Species" prior to 
its publication in November, 1859; and of his review in the American 
Journal of Science of the following March, Darwin wrote, "Your re- 
view seems to me admirable, — by far the best I have read." The re- 
view certainly presents most accurately, succinctly, and attractively 
Darwin's own views ; but Gray does not even here announce that he 
is himself a complete convert to the doctrine, as is seen by the follow- 
ing citation : "What would happen if the derivation of species were to 
be substantiated, either as a true physical theory or as a sufticieut 
hypothesis f The inquiry is a pertinent one just now. For, of those 
who agree with us in thinking that Darwin has not established his 
theory of derivation, many will admit with us that he has rendered a 
theory of derivation much less improbable than before; that such a 
theory chimes in with the established doctrines of physical science, and 
is not unlikely to be largely accepted long before it can be proved." 
And the similar statement in the Atlantic Monthly of October, 18G0: 
"Those, if any there be, who regard the derivative hypothesis as satis- 
factorily proved must have loose notions of what proof is. Those who 
imagine it can be easily refuted and cast aside must, we think, have 
imperfect or very prejudiced conceptions of the facts concerned and of 
the questions at issue." 

In 1876 he brought together in a volume, entitled " Darwiniana," his 
principal essays and reviews pertaining to Darwinism, taken from the 
American Journal of Science, the Nation, and the Atlantic Monthly, 
and added a chapter on " Evolutionary Teleology ;" and in 1880 he 
published " Natural Science and Religion," two lectures delivered to 
the Theological School of Yale College, before a critical audience, who 
listened with the deepest interest to what was, in some points, his 
most advanced view of natural selection. We need not dwell on a 
subject about which so much has lately been written by far abler pens 
than ours. Briefly stated. Gray was probably the best expounder of 
Darwinian principles — meaning thereby those actually advocated by 
Darwin himself, and excluding the wild deductions attached to the 
original theory by those who deserve the name of Darwinissimists 
rather than Darwinists — although he himself regarded natural selec- 
tion as a less efficient cause than it was assumed to be by Darwin. 

His influence as an exponent of Darwinism was due partly to the 
admirable clearness and candor of his reviews and his interesting way 
of putting things ; for his fertile imagination was constantly discovering 



ASA GRAY. 781 

aptsimiles toillustrate otherwise dry arguments. It was also dueiupart 
to his known caution and conservatism, and his professed Christian faith. 
If an avowed accepter "of the creed commonly called the Nicene" saw 
nothing in Darwinism which implied atheism, or was opposed to the idea 
of design on the part of the Creator, surely one might, at least, listen 
to his account of his development theory with safety. To his hearers 
at New Haven, in 1880, he said: "Natural selection by itself is not aa 
hypothesis, nor even a theory. It is a truth — a catena of facts and di- 
rect inferences from facts. - - - There is no doubt that natural se- 
lection operates ; the open question is, what do its operations amount to. 
The hypothesis based on this principle is, that the struggle for life and 
survival of only the fittest among individuals, all disposed to vary and 
no two exactly alike, will account for the diversification of the species 
and forms of vegetable and animal life, will even account for the rise, 
in the course of countless ages, from simpler and lower to higher and 
more specialized living beings." He gave it as his opinion that natural 
selection is, on the whole, a good working hypothesis, but does not ex- 
plain how wholly new parts are initiated, even if the new organs are 
developed little by little. He repeated over and over again in differ- 
ent reviews his belief that natural selection could not account for varia- 
tion, and he stated the case particularly forcibly in his "Evolutionary 
Teleology:" "Natural selection is not the wind which propels the 
vessel, but the rudder, which, by friction, now on this side and now 
on that, shapes the course. The rudder acts while the vessel is in 
motion, effects nothing when it is at rest. Variation answers to the 
wind. - - - Its course is controlled by natural selection. This pro. 
ceeds m;iinly through outward influences. But we are more and more 
convinced that variation - - - is not a product of, but a response 
to, the action of the environment. Variations are evidently not from 
without, but from within." 

But how do variations arise? According to Gray, by virtue of some 
inherent power imparted in the beginning by Divine agency. That 
granted, natural selection would in great part account for the present 
condition and distribution of life, so that one could be a Darwinian and 
Deist at the same time. Gray further believed that variation is apt 
to follow in certain more or less regular directions, and particularly in 
beneficial directions. Here he differed very widelj^ from Darwin. The 
one saw design where the other could not, and it must be confessed 
that Gray was treading on delicate ground, scientifically if not theo- 
logically speaking, when he affirmed the direction of variation in bene- 
ficial lines. For what is meant by beneficial^ Beneficial to whom? 
Beneficial for what purpose? In one sense, any variation which tends 
to enable a living being to survive in the struggle for existence is bene- 
ficial; and to say that any being or structure has survived is tiie same 
as saying that the variation from which it sprang was beneficial. But 



782 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS. 

Gray iii)i)areutly uses the word beneficial iu the seuse of beiug fore- 
ordained to be beneticial. 

Perhaps we must look to inheritance itself for an explanation of the 
difference in the views of Gray and Darwin. The Gray family were 
devout members of the Presbyterian Church, and throughout his life 
Dr. Gray adhered faithfully to the orthodox faith of his fathers, his 
own views being in harmony with those of the liberal branch rather 
than with those of the conservative branch of that communion. The 
agnostic position of Darwin may perhaps be inferred from his own de- 
scription of himself aud his father as belonging " nominally to [the] 
Church of England,'' an expression which leads one to believe that he 
was hardly to be counted a member of that or any other denominatioo. 
When a young man, Gray certainly had no leanings towards evolution. 
In his review of the " Vestiges of Creation," in the North American 
Eeview of 1846, he wrote: "Although 'geology fuUj'^ proves' that 
there have been various creations, that different species were created 
at different periods, and that some of the humblest and simplest first 
appeared, while laud animals, quadrupeds, quadrumaua, aud bimaua 
were not introduced until after the earth was fitted for their residence, 
yet we are still to be conviuced that they were not then created as per- 
fect as they now are." But he was convinced later, when he studie<l 
the relations of the North American liora to that of Asia, aud he ac- 
cepted without hesitation the view that the present species are not 
special creations, but derived from previously existing species, at a time 
when the truth of the theory was scarcely recognized by any naturalists, 
aud at a date when in the public mind a belief in evolution meant athe- 
ism. He had the courage to avow openly his convictions, but, on the 
other hand, never allowed his convictions to be governed by wild 
speculations. 

But we who have known Asa Gray so many years would now recall, 
not the great botanist, but rather the kind-hearted, genial man, whose 
sympathy cheered and whose wisdom guided, whose heart was ev^er 
youug, whose brain was ever active. His long life, unclouded by great 
sorrow and almost free from personal enmities, was inspired throughout 
by a faith which never faltered. Retaining to the last the energy aud 
vivacity of youth, his intellect broadening and ripening, his character 
growing more aud more sweet and serene, he reminds us of one of those 
trees which bear flowers and fruit at the same time. Industrious to an 
extent that few could equal, his work done, he enjoyed society with a 
relish, aud his reaily wit, his inexhaustible stock of anecdotes, aud his 
quick and keen appreciation of the best in literature and art, made him 
ev-erywhere welcome. His own house was open to all, and even those 
who came to pay the simple tribute of staring were not often turned 
away. With a graceful hospitality to which wealth could have lent no 
greater charm, he entertained the learned of many nations, and wel 
corned with special cordiality his brother botanists, a long array, includ-

ing not only the experts iu the science, but tlie poor and struggling 
student as well. He shared with all, the treasures of his knowledge, 
aiid not infrequently he added something from the modest competence 
which his industry had amassed. The words of good cheer from his 
lij)s were re-echoed in after years, and the life so honorable was not uu- 
honored. If the nunjerous honorary degrees from learned societies at 
home and abroad testify to the esteem in which he was held as a scien- 
tific botanist, the warm congratulations of friends from all parts of the 
country when the memorial vase was presented on his seventy-fifth 
birthday show no less clearly how much he was beloved as a man. 
And when, during dreary weeks, his anxious friends hoped against 
hope, watching to catch the sound of the loved voice which would 
speak but could not, all felt that the message AA'hich he sought to utter 
must have been a benediction. But it was not needed. His life was a 
benediction, and as his body was borne to its last resting place the 
freshly- fallen snow was not more pure than his character, nor the 
sparkling winter air more bright and clear than his intellect.
