GENERAL CONSI DKPv A'JK )NS. 

The United States National Museum had its oriyin in tlu^ act of 
Cong-ress of 184(3 founding- the kSmithsonian Institution, which made 
the formation of a museum one of the principal functions of the 
latter, and jirovided that — 

Whenever suitable avrangementH can l)e made from time to time for their recep- 
tion, all objects of art and of foreis^n and curious reseai-ch, and all objects of natural 
history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belunging to the Tnited 
States, which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever custody they may 
be, shall be deli\ered tu such persons as may be authorized I>y the Board of Regents 
to receive them, and shall be so arranged and classified in the building erected for 
the Institution as best to facilitate the examination and study of them; and when- 
ever new specimens in natural historv, geology, or mineralogy are obtained for the 
museum of the Institution, l)y exchanges of duplicate specimens, Avhich the Regents 
may in their discretion make, or by donation, whicli they may receive, or otherwise, 
the Regents shall catise such new sj^ecimens to be appropriately classed and arranged. 

The principal and accumulated interest of the Smithsonian fund 
amounted at thtit time to about ^75(),()()0, a sum considered amph^ to 
meet the needs of the various operations in which it was proposed that 
the Smithsonian Institution should eno-uo-e. In lS4ti probahh^ not 
more than one or two universities or learned establishments in Amer- 
ica had so larg(> an endowment, and it was apparently the idea of 
Concrress that the fund was sufficient both for the erection of a build- 
ing- and for the care of the collections which would l)e turned over 
to it or acquired by the national surveys, and in other ways. The 
Museum thus beg-an as an integral part of the Institution, coordinate 
with its library, and was required by law to ln•o^'ide for the Govern- 
ment collections which had previoush* accumulated, a dut^' which the 



4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSfiUM, 1902. 

Institution did not see its way clear to fulfill until 1S5S, when Con- 
gress began to make small yearl}^ appropriations to aid in this purpose. 
So inadequate, however, were the sums voted, that for many years the 
slender income of the Institution continued to be drawn upon to insure 
the maintenance of what was then justly called the Smithsonian 
Museum, since the building was paid for out of the Smithson fund, a 
considerable portion of the collections was and still is the property 
of the Institution, through exploration and gift, and a lumiber of the 
officials connected with the Museum were employed at its expense. 

The first scientific collection to come into the possession of the Insti- 
tution — and, in fact, it accompanied the bequest — was the small but 
valuable mineralogical cabinet of James Smithson, the founder, who 
was himself a chemist and udneralogist of repute, and a Fellow of the 
Royal Society of London. 

The nucleus of the National Museum was, however, virtuall}" acquired 
b}^ the National Institute, a society organized in Washington about 
1840, having for its avowed purpose the direction of the Smithson 
bequest and the pursuit of objects in consonance with the terms of that 
foundation. One of these objects was the gathering of historical and 
natural history specimens from both official and private sources, most 
prominent among the former having been the United States Exploring 
Expedition around the world from 1S38 to 1842. Rooms in the Patent 
Office building were secured for the museum of the society, which was 
practically recognized as the appropriate place of deposit for all Gov- 
ernment collections retained in Washington. Another important serv- 
ice rendered by the society was, as the late Dr. G. Brown Goode has 
said, in the direction of educating public opinion "to consider the 
establishment of such an institution worthy of the Government of the 
United States." Failing, however, to secure the public recognitiouat 
which it aimed, it became inactive upon the establishment of the Smith- 
sonian Institution in 1846, and its charter, which expired in 1861, was 
not renewed. The Government collections in its possession, which 
came practically under the care of the Commissioner of Patents, were 
turned over to the Smithsonian Institution in 1858. Other material 
directl}^ under the control of the National Institute remained at the 
Patent Office until 1862, and a part of the historical obji^cts were held 
there until 1883. 

Previous to 1858, however, important materials for a luuscum were 
being accumulated at the Smithsonian Institution, at its own cost and 
through the activities of its assistant secretary. Prof. Spencer F. 
Baird, beginning even before his appointment to that office in 1850. 
The personal bent of Professor Baird Avas toward the collection of 
natural history specimens for purposes of study. With the approval 
of Secretary Henry he put into operation plans for the accomplish- 
ment of this object, which, fostered tmd encouraged, were soon yield-

ing regular and abundant returns. Professor Baird\s own vacations 
were spent in field work. Ofticei-.s of the Army and Navy and of other 
branches of the Government service, fishermen, fur traders, private 
explorers, and such powerful organizations as the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany and the Western Union Telegraph Company, were enlisted in 
the work and rendered valuable assistance. The influence exerted by 
these beginnings has been lasting and widespread, as shown in the 
extensive natural history operations of subsequent National and State 
surveys, the organization of the Fish Commission and Bureau of Eth- 
nology, and the support giv^en to scientific collecting l)y many other 
bureaus of the CTOvernment. 

The discussion of plans for the organization of the Smithsonian 
Institution, which devolved upon the first Board of Regents, led, in 
January, 18-t7, to the unanimous adoption of the following resolution 
expressing approval of the museum featur*^ as one of its imi)(>rtant 
functions: 

Efi^olved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress estaljlishing the Institution, 
and in accordance with the design of Mr. Sniithson, as expressed in his will, that 
one of the principal modes of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of 
collections of specimens and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the 
gradual formation of a library of valuable works pertaining to all departments of 
human knowledge, to the end that a copious storehouse of materials of science, 
literature, and art may be provided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learn- 
ing among men, and shall assist the original investigations and efforts of those who 
may devote themselves to the pursuit of any l)ranch of knowledge. " 

The policy thus announced has prevailed to the present day. 

In 1879, when most of the existing Government surveys, whose 
work included the collecting of specimens in the field, had been estab- 
lished, Congress deemed it important to practically reenforce the pro- 
visions of the act founding the Institution, in order that there might 
be no doubt as to the proper disposition of the material certain to be 
derived from these various sources, T)y the following enactment in the 
sundry civil appropriation act for 1880: 

All collections of rocks, minerals, soils, fossils, and ol)jects of natural history, 
archa}ology, and ethnology, made by the Coast and Interior Survey, the Geological 
Survey, or by any other parties for the Government of the United States, when no 
longer needed for investigations in progress shall be deposited in the National 
Museum. 

Although the name "National Museum'' was sometimes used in the 
earlier reports of the Smithsonian Institution, it did not appear in any 
of the laws of Congress until 1875. Its general employment may ba 
said to date from the time of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition 
of 1876, the first exposition in this country in which the Government 
participated, and the first to make known to vast numbers of the 
people of the United States the existence of national collections at

Washington, as well as new methods of installing and exhibiting 
museum materials, differing radicalW from the older cabinets of col- 
lege or local museums, which had prevailed up to that period. After 
its olose the Government exhibits brought Isack to Washington, 
together with the extensive gifts made to the United States b}" private 
persons and foreign governments, rendered necessarv the early erec- 
tion of a new and separate building, devoted entirely to nniseum 
purposes. Since that time Congress has mainly provided for the 
maintenance of the Museum, but its management remains, by the 
fundamental act, under the authority of the Regents of the Smithson- 
ian Institution, administered through their Secretary, who is e.e officio 
the keeper — a form of government insuring a consistent and uniform 
polic}'^ and a nonpartisan administration of its affairs. The greater 
part of the Smithsonian building is still used for museum purposes, 
and the Institution, as well as most of the scientilic bureaus at Wash- 
ington, cooperate, both through men and material, in enlarg-ing and 
caring for the national collections. 

The scope of the National Museum as defined l^y law com]5rises 
practically all branches of science and of the arts which admit of 
museum treatment. With exceedingly limited means for making pur- 
chases, and tlierefore almost entire!}" dependent as to the character 
of its collections upon Government explorations, personal donations, 
and exchanges, its different departments have had a very unequal 
growth. The subjects best represented are American ethnology 
and archaeology, geology, zoolog}", and botany. A fair beginning 
has been made in the exceedingly important branches of the industrial 
arts and American history, and scarcely more is required to place 
these two departments on a proper basis than sufficient room to display 
the necessary collections, which are certain to be received, in greater 
part through gratuitous contriljutions, when it is known that the 
Museum is prepared to care for them. In the department of the fine 
arts the collection is still very small, but the subject is one which 
must sooner or later receive (^arncst consideration bv the Government. 

The specimens in all In-anchesare classified in two series; one, com- 
prising the bidk of the material, })eing arranged for the purposes of 
scientific research and reference in l!il)oratori(\s and storerooms, to 
which students ar(^. freely admitted: the other, selected with regard 
to their general educational value and pu))lic interest, and accompanied 
by descriptive labels, ])eing displayed in glass-covered cases in the 
public halls. The duplicate specimens not required for exchanges 
are made up into sets for distribution to schools and colleges, as 
opportunity offers. Papers descriptive of the collections, both tech- 
nical and popular, are published for gratuitous circulation to the 
extent of three or more volumes 3'early, and, finally, the Museum 
has come to be regarded as a bureau of information in respect to all 



EEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7 

subjects with which it is even in the remotest degree concerned, 
the correspondence which this involves now constituting one of its 
heaviest tasks. 

The history of the Museum, as pointed out by the lute Dr. Goode, 
may be divided into three epochs, which he characterized as follows: 

First, the period from tlie foundation of the Smithsonian Institutif)n to 1857, dur- 
ing whicli time specimens were collected solely to serve as materials for research. 
No special effort was made to exhibit them to the public or to utilize them, except 
as a foundation for scientific description and theory. 

Second, the period from 1857, when the Institution assumed the custody of the 
'National Cabinet of Curiosities," to 1876. During this period the Museum became 
a place of deposit for scientific collections which had already been studied, these col- 
lections, so far as convenient, being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable, 
made to serve an educational purpose. 

Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the Museum has 
undertaken more fully the additional task of gathering collections and exhibiting 
them on account of their value from an educational standpoint. 

During the first period the main object of the IMuseum was scientific research; in 
the second, the establishment became a museum of record as well as of research, 
while in the third period has been added the idea of public education. The three 
ideas — record, research, and education — cooperative and mutually helpful as they 
are, are essential to the development of every great museum. The National Museum 
endeavors to jiromote them all. 

In the same connection. Dr. Goode also defined the scoj^e and objects 
of the Museum in the following concise manner: 

It is a museum of record, in which are jireserved the material foundations of an 
enormous amount of scientific knowledge — the types of numerous past investigations. 
This is especially the case with those materials that have served as a foundation for 
the reports upon the resources of the United States. 

It is a museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in the highest 
degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scientific investigation. Research 
is necessary in order to identify and gniup the objects in the most philosophical and 
instructive relations, and its officers are therefore selected for their ability as investi- 
gators, as well as for their trustworthiness as custodians. 

It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by specimens every 
kind of natural object and every manifestation of human thought and activity, of 
displaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and of distributing its 
publications and its named series of duplicates. 

AS A MUSEUM OF RECORD. 

In its function as a museum of record the growth of the National 
Museum has been unprecedented, due mainly to the rapid exploration 
and dev^elopment of a rich and extensive country under the liberal 
and progressive policv of the Government. From scientific institu- 
tions throughout the world, from foreign governments, and from indi- 
viduals abundant stores of great value have been received, either as 
gifts or through the medium of exchange of specimens, and a small 
appropriation in recent 3'ears has permitted of some purchases to 
supply desiderata. 



8 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

The principal .sources of the collections niav be briefl}' summarized 
as follows: 

1. The explorations carried on more or less direct! 3' under the 
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, or by the Institution in con- 
nection with educational institutions or commercial establishments, 
and the eii'orts, since 1850, of its officers and correspondents toward 
the accumulation of natural histor}^ and anthropological material. 

2. The United States Exploring Expedition around the world from 
1838 to 1S42, the North Pacific, or Perry, Exploring Expedition from 
1853 to 1856, and many subsequent naval expeditions down to and 
including the recent operations in the AVest Indian and Philippine 
waters. 

3. The activities of meml)ers of the United States diplomatic and 
consular service abroad. 

4. The Government surveys at home, such as the Pacific Railroad 
surveys, the Mexican and Canadian boundary surveys, and the surve3's 
carried on by the Engineer Corps of the U. S. Ami}- and the activi- 
ties of officers of the Signal Corps, and other branches of the Arnw 
stationed in remote regions. 

5. The explorations of the U. S. Geological Survey, the U. S. Fish 
Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of American 
Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, and other scientific branches 
of the Government. 

6. Donations and purchases in connection with the several exposi- 
tions at home and abroad in which the Museum and Fish Commission 
have participated, among these having been the Centennial Exhibition 
at Philadelphia in 1870, the international fisheries exhibitions at Berlin 
in 1880 and at London in 1883, the New Orleans Cotton Centennial 
Exposition in 188-1 and 1885, the Cincinnati Exposition of 1888, the 
World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, and the expositions 
at Atlanta in 1895, at Nashville in 1897, at Omaha in 1898, and at 
the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. The returns from the World's 
Fair in Philadelphia were of greatest extent, comprising, besides the 
collections displa3'ed b}- the United States in illustration of the animal 
and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of the native 
races of the countr3' , valuable gifts from thirty of the foreign govern- 
ments which participated, as well as the industrial collections of numer- 
ous manufacturing and commercial houses of Europe and America. 

7. Exchanges with foreign and domestic museums and with indi- 
viduals. 

Immediately preceding the Centennial Exhibition of 1S7*!, when the 
collections were entirely provided for in the Smithsonian building, 
the number of entries of specimens in the Museum record books was 
about 235,000. In 1881:, when the additional room afi'orded b3^ the new 
building gave opportunit}'^ for taking a provisional census of the large

duct investigations on material kept here in their charge, and in whose 
results the Museum shares. 

Many collections have, from time to time, been transferred by the 
Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the Department of Agricul- 
ture, and other branches of the Government to the custody of the 
Museum in advance of their final working up, in ordei- to provide for 
their safe storage and to secure the better facilities for study here 
afforded. Under this arrangement the amount of research work car- 
ried on in the Museum l)uilding has been greatly increased. 

Though having little means to expend for field work, members of 
the Museum staff" are occasionally given opportunities to participate in 
the explorations of other Government bureaus or of private expedi- 
tions, in connection with which special researches may be carried on, 
though the chief ad\antage results from the acquisition of new and 
valuable material and a knowledge of the conditions under which it 
occurred in nature. 

AS AN EDUCATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The educational side of the ^luseum is intended to consist mainl}^ 
of an exhibition of all the classes of objects which it represents, so 
mounted, installed, and labeled as to directly interest and instruct the 
general public. The principal difficulty incident to the proper installa- 
tion of such a collection, conceding all the space requin^d, lies in the 
selection of its parts, so that while enough is displayed to convey the 
amount of information which it is intended to impart, the visitor shall 
not be ov^erburdened or confused with details. While this policy is 
being followed in the National Museum so far as its means permit, 
the lack of room has alwa3^s prevented a complete or satisfactory 
development of the plan, and every succeeding year the conditions in 
this respect grow worse instead of better through the increased t-rowd- 
ing of the halls. The advances in recent years have been chiefiy in 
the methods of display, in th(^ character of indiA'idual and group 
mountings, and in the labeling, in all of which directions exceptional 
progress has ))een made. 

A year ago it was announced that all of the halls designed for pub- 
lic u.se were then for the first time permanently open, though none 
were above addition or improvement, while in some the arrangement 
was entirely provisional. This was only accomplished ])y the transfer 
of large quantities of material to outside storage, but during the past 
year it has unfortunately been again necessary to shut off one of the 
most attractive halls in order to furnish increased space for work- 
rooms. 

In this connection it seems appropriate to refer to the work of Dr. 
Goode, than whom no museum administrator ever had a better under- 
standing of the public needs. He labored earnestly and conscien- 



KEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 11 

tiously to make thi.s a museum for, as well as of, the people, and the 
plans now being carried out are, in all their essential features, of his 
making-. AVhile the assistants might be relied upon to arrange^ and 
maintain tlie stud}' series in a manner acceptable to the specialist, the 
interests of the public alwa3's remained in his immediate charge. He 
was ever occupied in devising ways for so presenting the features of 
nature and the acti\'ities of mankind that by the very force of his sur- 
roundings the visitor was bound to receive and cai'ry witii him some 
detinite impressions, some new bit of knowledge. Dr. (roode's labors 
in this field ranged from the planning of the general scheme to the 
most minute details of case architecture and fittings. His oihcial con- 
nection with nearly all the important expositions oi the past quarter 
of a century and his exhaustive studies of all the principal museums of 
Europe and the United States gave him exceptional opportunities for 
observation and experiment. Though a young man wIkmi he died, 
none other had acquired so ripe an expericMice and uoik^ is more worthy 
of being followed. 

An incidental though very popular educational feature of the 
Museum, having for its purpose the promotion of scientitic teaching 
throughout the country, has been the disti'ibution to schools and col- 
leges of its duplicat(^ specimens, properly identified and la])eled, and 
put up in carefully selected sets. Inade(|uate means have prevented 
this measure from being carried out on the scale which the resources 
of the Museum would admit of, 1)ut many hundreds of such s(>ts jiavo 
alread}^ been given away. 

Scarcely a year passes that some expedition, either at home or 
abroad, is not occupying the attention of the Museum, and through 
this means its existence and aims are l)rought constantly and promi- 
nently before the public. These expositions have of late followed one 
another so closely and have riMpured such extensive preparations as to 
interfere greatly with the ordinai'v ^\•ork of the Museum, but the 
practice of introducing new and \ aiied features, of showing a fresh 
series of objects or improved groupings in connection with each one, 
insures a substantial gain, as the collections are retui'ned to Washing- 
ton, besides fulfilling the important function of making nmseimi 
methods known to the people of the Unit<Ml States and stinudating 
the growth of nuiseums in many (piart(>rs. 

Though maiid}^ technical and most useful to the investigator, the 
publications of the IViuseum can be classed, in a general way, as belong- 
ing to its educational side, being the medium through wdiich the nature 
and extent of its collections are made known. The Annual Report, 
first printed as a separate volume of the Smithsonian Keport in 1S8-1, 
and now in its nineteenth volume, consists,- besides the administrative 
part, mainly of semi-popular papers on interesting portions of the 
collections. The Proceedings and Bulletins are almost exclusively 



12 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

technical, the shorter papers being assigned to the former and the larger 
and more exhaustive works to the latter. Of the Proceedings twent}-- 
three complete volumes have been issued and of the Bulletins fif t^-one 
numbers. 

PRESENT CONDITION AND NEEDS OF THE MUSEUM. 

The National Museum now occupies the building erected for its use 
in 1881, the greater part of the Smithsonian building, parts of three 
detached buildings on the Mall, and several rented buildings south of 
B street SW. The floor area represented, together with the general 
use to which the several floors of the larger buildings and each of the 
smaller buildings are devoted, is showni in the following table:

Total .' 238, 689 

An inypection of the .several building's shows conditions which are 
very deplorable for the National Museum of a great country. Every 
branch is seriously hampered by the total inadequacy of the space 
assigned it, and the proper disposition of specimens long ago became 
impossible, with the result that year after year valualile collections, 
often of large size, have had to be packed away in insecure rented 
buildings, where they are also inaccessible. While the Museum 
building is not ill adapted to exhibition purposes, it is much too small 
to serve the present needs. Its halls are overcrowded, the cases being 
generally placed so near together that two persons can scai-cely pass 
between them and no effective view of their contents can be obtained. 
An increase in space of one-half to two-thirds at least woiUd be neces- 
sary to properly display the present contents of these halls. 

Having practically no basement, the only space available for the 
reserve storage, workrooms, and offices is in the small rooms of the 
central towers and corner pavilions, except that some of the galleries 
designed for exhibition have from necessity been turned over to these 
purposes. In these quarters the specimens are packed almost solidly, 
in cases generallv reaching to such a height as to make access to the 
upper ones extremely inconvenient. The workers have scarcely room 
in which to place their tables, and there is little place anywhere for 
the spreading out of spc^cimens for purposes of study and classification 
or of preparation for exhibition. 

In the Smithsonian building, which was originally intended to be 
used only in small part for nuiseum purposes, the conditions are simi- 
lar. There are four exhibition halls, three used for zoology and one 
for prehistoric archeology. The latter, occupying the entire upper 
floor of the main building, has, through the loosening and fall of large 
areas of plaster from the ceiling, been pronounced unsafe and closed 
to the public until funds can be obtained for its repair and renovation. 
The large corresponding room on the ground floor has four galleries 
extending nearly its entire length, which, some fifteen years ago, were 
turned into work and storage quarters for several branches of zoology. 
They are overcrowded with cases and tables and are, moreover, 
extremely unhealthf ul places for the assistants stationed there because 
of the impure air rising from the exhibition floor below. 

In the ])asement is stored the greater part of the valua})le alcoholic 
collection of the Museum, in a series of dark, damp rooms, wholly 



14 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

unsuitod to the piirpo.s(\ unci where a threat deal of work has to be car- 
ried on. The other workrooms and storerooms in the Smithsonian 
building, I)esides two or three small ones on the main floor, are in the 
north tower, which is utilized for these purposes up to the lieight of 
the seventh story. It is scarcel}^ necessar}- to explain that man}- of 
these rooms, all of which are ver}' small, are inconvenient of access, 
and that specimens can be carried to and from them only with 
difficulty. 

Many of the activities of the Museum and much the greater part of 
its storage have, for a long period, had to be provided for in outside 
buildings, partly on the Mall and partly rented at an anmial expense 
of over $4,000. The taxidermists are quartered in the upper part of 
the Smithsonian stable and in a temporary frame structure back of 
the Smithsonian building. On Armory square, adjoining the Fish 
Commission building, is an old, dilaj)idated wooden shed filled with 
specimens. On Ninth street SW. there is under lease a large area of 
land, covered with wooden sheds containing an immense amount of 
valuable collections and much other Museum property. The greater 
part of the so-called Marsh collection of vertel)rate fossils, which has 
been valued at above $150,000, is still stored in a rented building at 
Tenth street and Maryland avenue, which also provides space for sev- 
eral preparators' workshops. Two other rented buildings are likewise 
used to accommodate the extensive carpenter, paint, and glazing shops 
which are re(|uirod for the making of furniture and for the repairs 
upon the main l)uildings. 

In order to carry out the purposes for which it exists, the National 
Museum requires a greatly increased amount of space, and that any 
additional space provided l)e better adapted to its wants than that now 
occupied. 

For the exhibition collections a connecting series of relatiA^el}^ large 
rooms or halls is needed to permit of the arrangement of the specimens 
and groups of specimens, many of considerable size, in such manner as 
will best adapt them to the comprehension of the public and, by the 
avoidance of crowding, allow them to be viewed effectively-. 

The record collections, commonly known as the reserve or stud}^ series, 
comprising the bulk of the material in most departments, while demand- 
ing such a convenient disposition as will insure the read}" examination 
of specimens, require relatively less space than the exhibition collec- 
tions, as they can be much more compactl}" arranged in drawers and 
on shelves. Yet their extent is so great that the question of their 
accommodation is one of the most important ones for consideration. 
They have been mainly derived from the Government sui-veys of the 
past sixty years, and represent a ver}' large expenditure of public 
money. 

For the activities of the Museum are needed man}^ well-lighted and 
well-appointed rooms to serve as laboratories for classif3"ing collections 



KEPOKT OF ASSISTANT SECKETAKY. 15 

and for scientific research, and as workshops for the })ropanition of 
specimens for study and for exhibition. It shoukl also be noted that 
the Museum is called upon to furnish workrooms for several of the 
scientific bureaus, whose collections are partly studied there, and that, 
by a recent act of Congress, it is incumljent upon the Museum to pro- 
vide facilities for such students and investigators from other })arts of 
the country as may choose to visit it for purposes of researcli. 

Finall}^, space must be provided for certain general and miscella- 
neous purposes, such as the mechanit-al workshops and storerooms, 
the heating plant, public-comfort rooms, the lil)rary. a lecture' hall, 
the administrative ofiices, etc. 

An. estimate of the amount of space needed has been reached by a 
carefid consideration of the several reipiirements as set forth Ixdow, 
nameh' : 

(1) To reliev(> the present very congested condition of the exhitfi- 
tion halls. 

(2) To provide for the display of objects now in storage which are 
suitable and intended for public exhibition. 

(8) Convenient and systematic storage for the vast reserve oi- record 
collections which are now for the most part inaccessi]>le for examina- 
tion. 

(Jr) Suitable scientific laboratories, preparators' workshops, etc. 

(5) The mechanical workshops required in making repairs to build- 
ings and in the construction and repair of eases and other furniture 
and fixtures. 

(6) Offices necessary for administrati\e and other ])uip()scs common 
to all the branches of the Museum. 

(7) The space required for the heating phmt, the lil)rary, a lecture 
hall, public-comfort rooms, and other miscellaneous purposes. 

(8) Provision for future growth. 

The growth of the Museum for a numl)er of years past has been 
mainly through the receipt of material which by law it must receive 
and care for. The amount of material declined or diverted elsewhere 
during the last ten or fifteen years because of the lack of room would 
have occupied a very large proportion of the present exhibition space 
and have greatly increased the money value of the collections. The 
same conditions have prevented the Museum authorities from solicit- 
ing large contributions, but with adequate facilities many extensive 
exhibits can be had for the asking. The department of arts and 
industries, the more practical side of the Museum, has perhaps suf- 
fered most from the lack of accommodations. I^arge exhibits have 
had to be removed to storage, and the growth of this most important 
and striking branch was necessarily stopped some time ago. It should 
be made here, as it has been in all the larger capitals of the world, 
one of the most important features of the national collections, and its

increase, once stimulated, would go forward rapidly and at relatively 
small expense, as generous donations might be expected from all 
quarters. 

Using the above topics as a basis for calculations, the amount of 
space immediately required has been worked out in a tentative wa}' 
for each of the departments. This information is summarized in the 
following table, which gives also for each subject the space now occu- 
pied. With regard to the present storage areas, it should be borne in 
mind that much of the material is now compactly stored in packing 
boxes, and if transferred to classified storage would spread out over 
man}^ times the space. The departments named are those under which 
the Museum is classified for convenience of administration.

SUMMARY OF THE OPERATION'S OE THE YEAR. 



Ari'ltOrUIATIONS ANT) EXl'KN DITUKES. 

The total amount appropriated l)y Cong-ress For the mainteuanee of 
the National Museum during the year ending Jmie oO, l'.>02, was 
$289,400, as against $203,540 for tlie previous year. The principal 
changes as compared with 1901 were as follows: An increase of $2,500 
under furniture and fixtures, an increase of $5,500 under heating- and 
lighting, of which $5,000 was for completing the electric installation 
in the Museum building, and an increase of $800 under rent of work- 
shops and storage quarters. The two following- special appropriations 
were made: For the purchase and installation of new boilers in the 
Museum building- of a capacity for heating both l)uilding-s, $12,500; 
for the construction of two galleries in the Museum building, $5,000. 

The expenditures up to the close of the 3^ear from the appropria- 
tions for 1901-2 amounted to $274,271. 20, leaving abalance of $15,128.80 
to meet outstanding liabilities. During- the same year $15,052.81 were 
disbursed from the balance of $15,293.77 of the appropriations for 
1900-1901 on hand July 1, 1901.

aThe total balance on June 30, 1901, was $16,715.33. No appropriations except those from which 
disbursements were made during the year are mentioned in this table. 

Di.sbur.seiiients from the appropriation for 18'J9-1900 were made as 
follows: Preservation of collections, $291.24; l)ooks, pamphlets, and 
periodicals, $2.55, leaving- balances of |40.15 and $28.09, respectively. 
These balances, together with unexpended bjilanccs of the appropria-

BUILDINGS. 

Several important alterations and improvements have been made in 
the Museum building. Some additional space has been gained through 
the construction of galleries in three ranges — the west-north, the north- 
west, and the south-west — wliich are being fitted up for the library 
and as laboratories for the departments of anthropology and geology. 

The steam boilers, Avhich had become entirel}^ worn out after a 
service dating from the erection of the l)uilding. liav(> ])een replaced 
by a pair of water-tube boilers of modern pattern, with capacity 
for heating both buildings. The introduction of these made it neces- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 21 

isaiy to overhaul the entire heatino- plant and to make new and more 
ample connections with the Smithsonian building. The boilers for- 
merly used in the latter building will be retained in place to guard 
against emergencies, and the employment of one set instead of two is 
expected to result in the econom}' of both fuel and labor. 

The installation of a complete system of electric-light wiring and 
fixtures extending to all the exhibition halls as well as to the offices, labo- 
ratories, and storerooms, Ijcgun the previous year, was finished satis- 
factorily. Should it be decided to open the building at night, how- 
ever, an increased appropriation will be required to cover the cost of 
extra current and the pay of several additional attendants. 

The quarters allotted to the purposes of a lunch room have been 
somewhat extended and improved, but this very desirable nniseum 
adjunct must always remain poorly provided for in the present building. 

The sundry civil appropriation act for 1903, passed just at the close 
of the year, contains an item of $5,000 for the preparation of prelim- 
inary plans for an additional fireproof ])uilding for the National 
Museum, to cost not over 11,500,000. 

ADDITIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS. 

The number of accessions received during the jqhv was 1,10!), con- 
taining an aggregate of 418,872 specimens, two and one-half times as 
man}^ as were added in 1001, and increasing- the total numljer of spec- 
imens in the national collections to 5,118,281, as shown b}^ the records. 
This figure is, however, below the actual one, as the contents of many 
packages filled with very small objects are estimated at a nominal 
figure. 

The most constant and important sources of accessions are certain 
bureaus of the Government whose collections are, by law, transferred 
to the custody of the IMuseum as soon as their study has been com- 
pleted. Among these bureaus are the Geological Survey, the Fish 
Commission, the Biological Survey, and the Divisions of Entomology 
and Plants of the Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of 
Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution. Large quantities of valu- 
able material are received from individuals and private establishments 
through donation and exchange, and many interesting features are 
added to the exhibition series through loans or deposits. Lack of 
funds has prevented the carrying on of field explorations ly meml)ers 
of the Museum stafl' except to a very limited extent, but scarcely a 
3'ear passes without some good returns through this means. 

"With a maximum annual appropriation of $10,000 for the purchase 
of specimens, not much can be done toward filling the iniuxmerable 
gapswhich occur throughout the collections, though many important 
desiderata are thus supplied from year to j^ear. 



22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, K02. 

As a complete list of the accessions for the year is given in Appen- 
dix II, and the more important ones are described in the reports of 
the head curators, attention will be called in this connection to only 
such as are especially noteworthy. 

The total number of specimens added to the Department of Anthro> 
pology was 40,083, prehistoric archeology heading- the list with 22,197 
specimens, ethnology following with 14,335 specimens, and history 
and biography standing third with 2.270 specimens. 

Among tlie important contril)uti(>ns in ethnology were a quantit}" of 
baskets, weapons, ornaments, and parts of costumes collected by Dr. 
W. L. Abbott in the Andaman and Nicobar islands, some of which 
have been described and illustrated by Lieut. W. E. Safford, U. S. 
Navy, in the Smithsonian Report for 1001; and many other objects, 
including crania, native ch)thing, lamps, and articles connected with 
the industries of the Eskimo, obtained in northern Greenland and EUes- 
mero Land by Mr. Robert Stein, of the U. S. Geological Survej'-, 
during his Arctic expedition. A number of Guatemalan costumes 
and of objects illustrating the first steps in the weaving of cotton as 
practiced in that country, as well as other ethnological material, were 
received from Mrs. Mary W. Owen, of Panzos, Guatemala. Two 
interesting donations were a series of weapons captured during the 
Philippine insurrection, inchiding several Filipino swords of the ordi- 
nar}^ type, some bolos, and a kris, from Maj. E. L. Hawks, U. S. 
Volunteers; and a collection consisting principally of the different 
types of "punal de kris," a weapon carried by the women and children 
in the Philippine Islands, together with a device formerly used in the 
Philippine army for decapitating wounded soldiers, from Dr. W. C. 
Warmsle}^, of Norwich, Connecticut. Another Philippine collection, 
secured b}^ purchase from Mr. J. N. Harkins, of Calhoun, Georgia, 
comprises weapons, cooking utensils, tobacco l)oxes, charm belts, 
models of boats, newspapers, statuettes, and coins. 

A collection of choice objects brought together by the iati^ Dr. G. 
Brown Goode, and secured during the year, includes musical instru- 
ments, Japanese porcelains, domestic utensils, gambling devices, 
plaques, vases, an incense box, old Kutani ware, Marcusi ware, Cloi- 
sonne plates and bowls, trays, English chinaware, and ironstone china 
from China. Other additions to the collection of musical instruments 
were a small series of instruments used ])y the American Indians and 
several from European countries, including a n^^ckleharpa obtained 
by exchange from Mrs. J. Crosl)y Brown, of Orange, New Jersev, 
and 78 pieces, comprising instruments of the Javanese, Chinese, Tib- 
etans, Japanese, and Persians; Syrian and Egyptian kettledrums, a 
Turkish mandolin, etc., presented bj^Dr. R3^an Devereaux, U. S. Army. 

A complete set of the gold and silver corns of Siam, and a series of 
Spanish coins minted in Mexico and the Philippine Islands, embracing 



EEPOET OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 28 

the various kinds issued l)y Spain for use in its colonies, were oljtaincd 
by purchase. 

Loan collections, chietl}^ of historical interest, received on deposit 
and exhibited in the main Museum hall, were as follows: Eightj^-two 
relics of Colonial times and a gold watch worn ])y George Fayette 
Washington, a nephew of George Washington, from the National 
Society of Colonial Dames; relics of the War of the Revolution, includ- 
ing commissions in the C<nitinental Arnty, from the Daughters of the 
American Revolution; several swords that had Ixdonged to the late 
Rear- Admiral J. W. Philip, U. S. Nav}^, one presented l)v the children 
of Texas, another by the citizens of New York city, from Mrs. Philip; 
six swords belonging to Rear- Admiral R. D. Evans, U. S. Navy, 
including one presenti^l by the State of Iowa and one l)y the crew of 
the battleship Iowa/ and 31 guns captured at Tientsin, China, com- 
prising the various types of European and American manufacture 
now employed in the Chinese army, from Col. W. H. Carter, U. S. 
Arm5^ A desk and cjuadrant used by Dr. C. F. Hall on his Polaris 
Arctic expedition, were received as a gift from Miss Anne S. Hall, 
of Cincinnati, Ohio.- 

Among the important accessions in archi\>ology were the collection 
of flint implements, bone utensils, and remains of extinct and recent 
mammals resulting from the examination of a sulphur spring at Afton, 
Indian Territor}^, by Mr. W. H. Holmes, and a very large amount of 
material, comprising pottery, implements of stone, wood, and shell, 
bones, and human remains, obtained 1)y Dr. AYalter Hough during his 
investigations in Arizona, partlj' in conjunction with Mr. Peter G. 
Gates. 

Al)out 10,000 prehistoric objects from Georgia, including carvings, 
spearheads, polished stone hatchets, and other articles of stone, ivor}", 
and pottery, were accjuired from Dr. Roland B. Steiner. A collection 
of the implements used by the ancient inhal)itants of the arc^a now 
forming Columbia County, Pennsylvania, consisting of stone articles 
of domestic utility, stone hatchets, banner stones, arrow points, and 
spearheads, was presented by Mr, Charles Hummel, of Espey, Penn- 
sylvania; a large series of prehistoric objects from the Potomac Valley 
was obtained by i)urchase; and material from the guano caves of Las 
Cruces, New Mexico, was contributed l)y Mr. J. R. De Mier. 

Among the accessions in archeology from other countries were 
over 000 specimens of prehistoric vases, stone figures, carvings, and 
polished instruments, and figures and dishes in earthenware, from 
Mexico, received from Mr. E. O. Matthews; an image, mortar, and 
pestle of stone, from Porto Rico, presented by Mr. Henry Bird; and 
a series of flint implements and bones from the cavern of Kesserlock, 
Schafl'hausen, Switzerland, donated by Prof. J. Heierli, of the Uui- 
versit}' of Zurich. 



24 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

The additions to the technological collections include several of his- 
torical value, such as pieces of apparatus devised and used by Dr. 
Elisha .Graj^ in his experiments with harmonic multiple telegraph}^ 
and with the telephone, received from Mrs. Gray; one of the tin-foil 
records made by Edison's first phonograph when exhibited before the 
National Academy of Sciences at the Smithsonian Institution in 1878, 
contributed by Mr. William J. Rhees; a number of electric-lighting 
and telephone devices, and one of the early forms of typewriting 
machines. 

In the Department of Biology the additions numbered 377,227 speci- 
mens, of which 324,687 were zoological and 52,540 botanical. Among 
the zoological divisions the greatest increase was of mollusks, namel}^, 
173,262 specimens, followed by insects with 118,292, marine inverte- 
brates, exclusive of mollusks. with 18,380, mammals with 6,301 
specimens, etc. 

The collections sent b}^ Dr. W. L. Abbott from the East Indies, con- 
sisting principally of mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects, formed the 
most important zoological accessions. Of mammals there were 848 
specimens, including many new species, from the islands of Andaman, 
Nicobar, Sumatra, Linga, Sinkep, Johore, and others farther eastward; 
of birds, over 700 specimens, and of reptiles, a considerable number. 
The region visited by Dr. Abl)ott is in large part a new field, not 
previousl}^ represented in the National Museum, and the generous 
contributions from this indefatigable explorer give the Museum a col- 
lection from this region which is absolutely unrivaled. 

Other specimens of mammals received deserving of mention were 
a fine skeleton of the huge Kadiak (Alaska) bear from Mr. J. H. 
Kidder, of Boston; African antelopes, monkeys, and birds from Dr. A. 
Donaldson Smith, of Philadelphia; many skulls of moose, elk, and 
other deer from Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton, of New York, and a 
large series of small mammals from Germany and of squirrels from 
Asia. 

Among the ornithological material were about 300 Cuban and Porto 
Rican birds collected by Mr. B. S. Bowdish; a quantity of Cuban 
birds collected by Mr. William Palmer; a series of East Indian birds 
from the Ro^^al Museum of Natural History at Leiden, Holland; a 
large number of Brazilian birds from the Museu Paulista at Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, besides smaller collections from Mexico, Cocos Island, 
Hawaii, and Great Britain. Several rare species of birds' eggs were 
also obtained. 

The reptilian collection was enriched by the field work in Cuba and 
Porto Rico of Mr. B. S. Bowdish and Mr. William Palmer, and 
valuables specimens were also received from Japan, Sumatra, and the 
Philippine Islands. 

The Division of Fishes was fortunate in securing, through Messrs. 



EEPOKT OF ASSISTANT SECRETAKY. 25 

Anderson and Price, of Ormond, Florida, the skin of a whale shark 
{Rhinodon) 13 feet long, the first of its kind recorded as having been 
taken in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Leland Stanford Junior Uni- 
versity presented the types of a large number of Japanese fishes described 
by Dr. David S. Jordan, and also specimens from Panama, Cocos 
Island, and the Galapagos Islands. A collection of Egyptian fishes 
from the Nile was contributed by Dr. Bashford Dean, of Columbia 
University, and interesting material from several sources was trans- 
mitted by the U. S. Fish Commission. 

Twelve species of land shells from Cocos Island, cotypes of species 
described in E. von Marten's work on the mollusks of that localit}', 
were donated by Mr. William H. Dall. Some 2,000 shells from Lower 
California were received from Lieut. C. A. Clarke, U. S. Navy, and 
a number of new species of North American land shells from Mr. J. H, 
Ferris, of Joliet, Illinois. 

The largest addition to the Division of Insects comprised about 
65,000 specimens collected in Arizona by Mr. E. A. vSchwarz, Cus- 
todian of the Coleoptera in the Museum, at his own expense, and by 
him presented to the national collections. The Museum was already 
indebted to this generous friend for the gift of his extensive private 
collection previously formed.* Some 7,000 insects of several groups 
were brought from the Hawaiian Islands by Mr. W. H. Ashmead, 
and 10,000 specimens of lepidoptera from Colorado by Dr. H. G. 
Dyar, assisted by Mr. A. N. Caudell. The expeditions on which this 
material was secured are referred to elsewhere. Ten thousand beau- 
tifully prepared specimens of butterflies, mainly from Mexico and 
Central America, have been deposited in the Museum by Mr. Wil- 
liam Schaus, of Twickenham, England. 

The Division of Marine Invertebrates received from the U. S. Fish 
Commission a series of Porto Rican sponges, identified b}^ Dr. 11. V. 
Wilson, of the University of North Carolina; echini and holothurians 
from the same locality, identified l)y Prof. H. L. Clark, of Olivet 
College; the crustaceans and echinoderms collected during the expedi- 
tion of 1901 to the Hawaiian Islands; and a quantity of material from 
the marine station at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The extensive col- 
lection of corals made some 3"ears ago at the Philippine Islands by 
Prof. J. B. Steere and Prof. Dean C. Worcester was obtained l)y pur- 
chase. Among- the smaller accessions of importance were a quantit}' 
of marme invertebrates from EUesmere Land, collected ])y Mr. Kobert 
Stein; a series of the cave crustaceans of Kentucky and Tennessee 
from Prof. W. P. Hay; a numl^er of Alaskan crustaceans from Mr. 
R. S. McGregor, of the U. S. Coast Surve}^ steamer J\(thiindei\ and 
samples of the Atlantic sea bottom from the U. S. Navy. 

Through the generous bequest of Dr. Charles Mohr, of Asheville, 
North Carolina, who died in Jul v. l!>i>l. the Division of Plants became 



26 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

possessed of his entire collection of flowering- plants, comprising more 
than 18,000 specimens, chiefl}-^ from tlie southern United States. Two 
3"ears previously Dr. Mohr had presented to the Museum his collection 
of about 3,000 specimens of cryptogam ic plants from the same region. 
From his trip to Central America during- the summer of 1901 Dr. 
J. N. Rose l)roug-ht l)ack a large number of plants, including specimens 
from Mount Orizaba and Mount Popocatepetl, and also some living 
plants, which were deposited in the greenhouse of the Department of 
Agriculture. A valualile collection from China and the Philippine 
Islands was contributed by the Royal Botanic Gardens of Kew, Eng- 
land; over 6,000 plants from various parts of the United States and 
from Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico, and Porto Rico were transmitted by 
the Department of Agriculture; and about 1.200 Chinese plants were 
acquired by purchase. 

In the Department of Geology the accessions haye been numerous, 
and in some of its divisions of more than ordinar}' importance. The 
total number of specimens received was 81.563, nearl}- 90 per cent 
being fossil invertebrates. Among the rocks and ores transmitted b}- 
the U. S. Geological Survey were many specimens illustrative of its 
recent explorations in Colorado, Montana, and Oregon. A large 
quantity of ore samples from the United States exhibit at the Paris 
Exposition of 1900 was turned over to the Museum b}^ the Government 
board. The minerals added comprise many varieties, a number of 
which were not previously represented. Especially worthy of mention 
are a fine specimen of native tellurium from Delamar, Nevada; a mag- 
nificent mass of moss gold on quartz from the "Miner's Dream" mine, 
Old Chester district, California; characteristic samples of Alaskan gold; 
fine specimens of molybdenite from Okanogan County, Washington; 
axinite from Switzerland and Japan; beautiful crystals of tourmaline 
from Mesa Grande, California; zeolites from Golden, Colorado; and a 
beautiful mass of the so-called needle ore (Gothite) from Ironwood, 
Michigan. The following species new to the collection were also 
obtained: Narsarsukite, percylite, yttrocerite, picroallumogene, bornite 
(in crystals), espistolite, plumboferritc, ankjdite, sulvanite, thalenite, 
elpidite, and lossenite. Fine specimens of tourmaline and amethj'st 
were received as a gift from Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, Honorary Custo- 
dian of Gems and Precious Stones. 

The meteorite collection was increased during the year to the extent 
of 29 falls, and now comprises specimens representing a total of 356 
distinct falls. The most valuable addition was a stony iron meteorite 
from Admire, Kansas. The sources of other important specimens 
were as follows: Misshof, Courland, Russia; Rafriiti, Switzerland; 
Cereseti, Piedmont, Ital}-; St. Mesmin, Salles and Lancon, France; 
Sao Juliao do Moreira, Portugal; Limerick, Ireland; Shalka, Bengal, 
India; Rhine Villa, South Australia; Weston, Connecticut; Algona,

Wisconsin; Monroe, North Carolina; Tombigljee, Alal)ania; Tono-a- 
noxic and Kiowa County, Kansas, and San Ang-elo and Kendall Count}-, 
Texas. 

In invertebrate paleontology there were stn'eral very large and 
important additions. Some 15,000 specimens, including 1<),00() 1)rach- 
iopods, 4,200 bryozoans. man}' cretaceous forms from New Jerse}", and 
cystids and crinoids from Maryland, composing the private collection 
of Mr. Charles Schuchert, Assistant Curator of Stratigraphic Paleontol- 
ogy, were donated by him to the Museum. Prof, (reorge M. Perdew 
also presented his entire collection of Silurian and Devonian fossils, 
about 1,300 specimens, from Cumberland, Marvland. The PI O. 
Ulrich collection of Ostracoda, containing about 5,000 specimens and 
the type and figured specimens of 100 species was ac<piired by pur- 
chase. The transmissions from the Geolog-ical Survey included 8,755 
specimens of Cambrian T)rachiopods, which had been tlu^ su])ject of 
special study by the Director, Dr. Charles D. AValcott. 

The extensive series of teeth of the elephant and mastodon, obtained 
by Mr. W. H. Holmes at Afton, Indian Territor}-, associated with 
prehistoric implements, has proved of great interest, several species 
being represented. 

The accessions in paleobotan}- include a valuable collection of fossil 
plants, comprising- the t3"pe specimens descril)ed ])y Pi'of. Ebenezer 
Emmons in his American Geology, part G, 1857; 10(> specimens from 
the auriferous gravels of California, collected by Mr. (J. D. Voy; 10 
specimens from what ma}" be the Upper Jurassic formation in the 
vicinity of the Corwin coal mine, near Cape Lisburne, Alaska; al)out

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 29 

EXPLORATIONS. 

Owing to the very limited means available for tield researches, the 
amount of work of this character carried on by assistants of the 
Museum has been relatively small, and most of the expeditions made 
were only rendered possi))Ie through cooperation with other l)ureaus 
of the Government or through the generosity of individuals. The 
Government explorations by which the Museum is most benefited are 
those conducted by the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the 
Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of Ethnology of the 
Smithsonian Institution. Officers of the Army and Navy, with the 
exceptional opportunities now siiorded them, have also been doing- 
some excellent work for the Museum, especially in the Philippine 
Islands. In this connection mention should likewise be made of the 
important explorations which Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, has 
been carrying on for several years in the East Indies entirely at his 
own expense, the results being generously donated to this Institution. 
The latter comprise large collections in zoology and ethnology, whose 
value is enhanced by the fact of their coming from a region hitherto 
but poorly represented in any museum in the world. The held work 
engaged in during the year by meml^ers of the Museum staff was as 
follows: 

Mr. W. 11. Holmes, Head Curator of Anthropology, visited Indian 
Territorv and Missouri, in the former investigating an interesting- 
deposit of Hint implements and bone utensils associated with the 
remains of extinct and recent mannuals at Aftou and an ancient chert 
quarry on the Peoria Indian Reservation, and in the latter examining, 
near Kimmswick, an extensive deposit of fossil mammals in which 
human remains were said to occur, and an ancient village site contain- 
ing stone implements and pottery. The investigations begun by Dr. 
Walter Hough in Arizona, in June, 1901, were continued through the 
summer, in conjunction with Mr. Peter G. Gates, of Pasadena, Cali- 
fornia, and chiefly at the expense of the latter. An archa?ological 
section was made on a north and south line from Fort Apache to 
Moki, a distance of about ISO miles, and a large amount of material 
was obtained. Ethnographical work was also done among the Apache, 
Navaho, and Hopi Indians, and two new groups of ruins north of 
Holl)rook were mapped. 

Mr. W. H. Ashmead, who accompanied an expedition of the U. S. 
Fish Commission to the Hawaiian Islands in May, 1901, for the pur- 
pose of making collections of insects and of studying the insect fauna 
of these new possessions, retui'ned late in the summer with an impor- 
tant lot of material. Mr. B. S. Bowdish, formerly of the U. S. Armj^ 
in Porto Rico, was employed for about seven months in procuring 
zoological specimens, chiefly birds, in Porto Rico, in eastern Cuba, 
and on Mona Island. Mr. C. L. Pollard and Mr. William Palmer 



30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

accompanied Dr. Edward Palmer, of the Department of Agriculture, 
in the spring of 1902 on an expedition to eastern Cuba, where they 
obtained an interesting collection of plants, birds, bats, insects, and 
marine inv(n'tebrat(^s. 

The station of the Cabot Steam Whaling Compan}^ on the south 
coast of Newfoundland, was visited during the summer of 1901 by Dr. 
Frederick W. True, who made a special study of the sulphur-l)ottom 
whales, ol)tained man}- photographs, and arranged for the preparation 
and shipment to Washington of the skeleton of a large whale. In a 
collecting trip to Colorado, Dr. H. G. Dyar, in compan}^ with Mr. 
A. N. Caudell, of the Department of Agriculture, secured some 10,000 
specimens of Lepidoptera, and Mr. E. A. Schwarz made in Arizona, 
at his own expense, a ver}" large collection of insects. Two months 
during the spring of 1902 were spent in southern Illinois by Mr. Uobert 
Ridgway in the interest of the Division of Birds. Botanical explora- 
tions were carried on in Central America during the summer of 1901 
b}^ Mr. J. N. Rose, assisted by Mr. Robert Hay, of Washington. 

Important collections were made by Mr. Charles Schuchert of 
Helderbergian fossils in New York and of Cretaceous fossils in New 
Jersey. Mr. F. W. Crosby obtained for the Museum a remarkably 
fine series of potholes from the basalt rocks near Snake River Falls, 
Idaho. 

Outfits to be used in collecting material for the National Museum 
have been furnished to the following persons: Mr. F. L. J. Boettcher, 
Washington, District of Columbia; Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U. S. Army; 
Mr. H. Caracciolo, Port of Spain, Trinidad; Capt. Luther S. Kelly, 
Surigao, Mindanao, Philippine Islands; Prof. O. F. Cook, U. S. 
Department of Agriculture; Mr. W. W. Simpson, Shanghai, China; 
Mr. Arthur B. Chilson, New York City; Miss Thora Stejneger, 
Washington, District of Columbia; Mr. Charles S. Banks, Bacolod, 
Negros, Philippine Islands; Dr. S. P. Bartlett, Quiuc}", Illinois; and 
Capt. Wirt Robinson, U. S. Army. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGi^. OF SPECIMENS. 

Six thousand five hundred and three specimens have been sent to 
specialists for study, in some cases as loans, in others to be worked up 
for the Museum. The gifts to educational establishments and the 
material used in making exchanges comprised 30,893 specimens. The 
gifts have consisted of duplicate series of marine invertebrates and 
fishes, and of the collections, recently prepared, to illustrate rock 
weathering and soil formation. 

A detailed statement of all the material sent out is contained in 
Appendix III. The following table shows the number of lots of speci- 
mens sent to eac-h State and foreign countiy:

RESEARCHES. 

The amount of work involved in the care and preservation of the 
collections leaves to the members of the Museum stafl' comparatively 
little time for original investigation, though the act founding the 
Museum directs the classification and arrangement of the specimens 
placed in its custody. By consulting the Proceedings, Bulletins, and 
Annual Reports of the Museum, however, it will be seen that the 
scientific assistants do contribute extensivel}^ every year toward the 
advancement of science, each in the line of his special stud}'. The 
working up of many groups of objects is also intrusted to scientific 
men not connected with the Museum, who give their services gratui- 
tously, and many specimens are lent to aid in investigations carried on 
at the various scientific establishments throughout the countr3\ Type 
specimens oi' choice objects, however, are only allowed to be taken 
away from the Museum in exceptional instances, and when their safet}^ 
can be assured. In its present crowded condition the Museum has 
very scanty accommodations for visiting students, but all applicants 
are allowed to avail themselves of such facilities as exist. 

In the Department of Anthropology the head curator continued his 
investigations in aboriginal art and the preparation of reports on pot- 
tery and stone implements. He also gave much time toward the com- 
pletion of a paper on the Classification and Arrangement of the 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 33 

Collections of an Anthropological Miisenni. Prof. O. T. Mason, 
Curator of Ethnology, made considerable progress in his researches on 
aboriginal basketry, on which subject he is preparing an important 
monograph. Dr. Walter Hough, Assistant (yurator, was mainly occu- 
pied in working up the results of his explorations with Mr. Peter G. 
Gates in Arizona during the summer of 19(»1. 

Some of the visiting specialists to the Department of Anthropology, 
with the objects of tlieir inquiries, were Dr. Franz P)oas, of the AmiM'i- 
can Museum of Natural History, New York City, mainly the Indian 
tribes of the northwest coast of America; Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, of 
the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Pueblo tril)es; Liei;t. W. E. 
Safford, U. S. Navy, for several years stationed on the island of (Tiiam, 
collections of ethnology from the South Sea islands; Dr. (). F. CJook, 
of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, ethn()])otanic material from 
Mexico; Dr. Washington Matthews, IT. S. Army, the industries of 
the American Indians; Prof. W. T. Brigham, of Honolulu, the Poly- 
nesian collections; and Prof. A. C. Haddon, of Cam})ridge, England, 
ethnological material in several branches. A collection of Hopi games 
and ceremonial objects was lent for study to Mr. Stewart Culin, 
director of the Free Museum of Science and Art of the University of 
Pennsylvania. 

In all divisions of the Department of Biology a consideral)le amount 
of research work was accomplished. Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., published 
five papers on mannnals, based mainly on collections recently received 
from Dr. W. L. Abbott, several notes on nomenclature and classilica- 
tion, and jointly with Mr. James A. G. Rehn a list of th(^ land mannnals 
of North America. Dr. M. W. Lj^on, ji*. , completed two papers on ])ats 
and one on the Venezuelan mannnals, collected by C^apt. Wirt Robinson 
and himself, and has also studied the skeletons of American hares and 
pikas. 

Good progress has been made l)y INIr. Robert Ridgway on his Manual 
of the Birds of North and Middh^ America, the first volume of which 
was published during the year, the second being now nearly ready for 
the press. The birds from the Andaman and Nicol)ar islands, pre- 
sented by Dr. Abbott, have been reported on, and those from Linga 
Island identified l)y Dr. C. W. Richmond. 

The general collection of reptiles and batrachians has been reidenti- 
fied, preparatory to their rearrangement in new cases, by Mr. Leonhard 
Stejneger, who also continued his researches on the reptile faunas of 
the Antilles and Japan. Sixteen papers on the fishes of Japan, by 
President D. S. Jordan and Messrs. J. O. Snyder, E.'C Starks, and 
M. Sindo, were published in the Proceedings, types of the new species 
described being presented to the Museum. A collection of fishes 
made in Japan in 1883 and 1885 for the Museum l)y Mr. Pierre L. Jouy 
was also worked up by Messrs. Jordan and Sn3^der. Dr. Tarleton H. 
NAT MUS 1902 3 



34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

Bean and Mr, B. A. Bean completed reports on the fishes of New York 
for the State museum, and of Great South Bay, New York, for the 
New York Fish Commission, and notes b}^ the latter on a whale shark 
from Florida, a steelhead salmon, and a larval conger eel were pub- 
lished hy the Museum. Dr. Theodore Gill and Mr. Bean reported on 
the collection of Egyptian fishes from the Nile presented by Dr. Bash- 
ford Dean. 

In the Division of Mollusks the curator, Mr. William H. Dall, has 
continued his work of revising and summarizing the groups of Amer- 
ican ])ivalves, both Tertiary and recent. His researches during the 
year have comprised the preparation of a report on the newly discovered 
Eocene of Alaska and the revision of the family' Veneridaj, one of the 
largest and most interesting of all the groups of bivalves. Mr. Paul 
Bartsch has made good progress in his studies of the Pyramidellidte of 
the Pacific coast, and Mr. Charles T. Simpson has continued his inves- 
tigations on the Naiades of the world. . 

Mr. James E. Benedict has finished his monograph, begun some 
time ago, on the Crustacean family Galatheida?. The work completed 
or in progress by Miss M. J. Bathbun has comprised studies upon the 
macruran and l)rachyuran crustaceans of the northwest coast; a list of 
the decapods of the northwest coast for the report of the Harriman 
Alaskan Expedition; a report upon the stalked-eyed crustaceans col- 
lected in Japan by Dr. D. S. Jordan and Mr. A. O. Snyder; a descrip- 
tion of a new species of fossil crab froui the northeast coast of Brazil,

cations of the brachyura and macrura collected l)y the U. S. Fish (Com- 
mission in Hawaii, in 11>01, and studies upon the fresh-water crabs 
belonging to the Museum of Natural Histor^^ of Paris. Miss Harriet 
Richardson, collaborator, has completed for Prof. A. E. Yerrill a 
report upon the Isopods of the Bermudas, and has begun studies upon 
the Japanese Isopods collected by the U. S. Fish Commission steamer 
Albatross^ Dr. Jordan and Mr, Snyder, and ui)on the Bopyridse in the 
Museum collection. She also has in press descriptions of a new fresh- 
water Isopod from Indiana and a new terrestrial Isopod from Cuba. 

ITnder arrangements with specialists connected with other establish- 
ments, the collections in several of the groups of aquatic invertebrates 
are l)eing worked up foi' the National Museum, as follows: The sertu- 
larian and companularian hydroids by Prof. C. C. Nutting, of Iowa 
University, whose monograph on the Plum ularidw was recently issued 
as a special bulletin; the holothurians by Prof. Charles L. Edwards, 
of Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, and Prof. H. L. Clark, of 
Olivet College, Michigan, the former having the Pedata, the latter

Dr. L. O. Howard, Honorary Curator of Insects, has published dur- 
ing the 3"ear a large number of papers, mainly of an economic char- 
acter. Mr. William H. Ashmead has continued his classitication work 
on the Hymenoptera, has completed his classitication of the Chalcid 
flies and has spent some time on the preparation of a monograph of 
the North American Braconid{\?, begun ten years ago. He has also 
finished, for publication by the Washington Academy of Sciences, 
reports on the Rynchota of the Harriman expedition, and on the 
Hymenoptera of the Galapagos Islands, collected ])y the expedition of 
the Leland Stanford Junior University. Mr. Ashmead has likewise 
made much progress upon a catalogue of the Hymenoptera of North 
America and the West Indies. Mr. D. W. Coquillett has c()mi)leted 
a synopsis of the dipterous family Chironomid;\\ Dr. H. G. Dyar 
has in course of publication a Indletin entitled A Catalogue of North 
American Lepidoptera North of Mexico. IVIr. Rolla P. Currie has 
been engaged in monographing the North American species of the 
ant-lion flies, and has begun the compilation of a catalogue of the 
Neuropteroid insects of North America. 

In the Division of Plants, Mr. F. Y. Coville, Honorary Cuiator, 
continued his investigations on the genera .SV///,/- and R!h,s and the 
preparation of a work on the flora of Alaska. His pul)lications dur- 
ing the year included papers on a new genus of Alaskan heather, Ilar- 
rimaneUo^ and on two species of Rihes. Dr. J. N. Rose was occupied 
in the stud}" of Mexican plants, and engaged with Dr. N. L. Britton in 
preparing a revision of the Crassulacea? of North America. Mr. C. L. 
Pollard prepared several papers descriptive of new species of violets 
and of Chamber ista and a popular account of plant families. Mr. 
W. R. Maxon published several notes on ferns. 

The collections of mammals and birds are frequently consulted hy 
the assistants of the Biological Survey of the Department of Agricul- 
ture. Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U. S. Army, spent the summer and 
early autumn in continuing his work upon the natural history of the 
Mexican Boundary Survey, more especially in regard to the mammals 
and birds. Dr. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Columbian Museum, Chi- 
cago, examined the mammals of Mexico and Central America, and 
Mr. John S. McDonald, of Milwaukee, conducted studies upon the 
North American mammals in Q-eneral.

In the Department of Geology important investigations regarding 
meteorites were carried on ))y the head curator and by Mr. Wirt Tas- 
sin. Assistant Curator of Mineralogy. Two papers by the former 
relating to the Felix and Admire meteorites were published during the 
year, and one by Mr. Tassin on a large mass of meteoric iron from 
Casas Grandes has been prepared. The latter has also continued his 
studies on the dehydration of the ferric hydrates. 

Mr. Chai'les Schuchert, Assistant Curator of Paleontology, has giv^en 
attention to the Silurian and Lower Devonian fossils of the Appa- 
lachian region and to fossil starfishes. The monograph of the Ste- 
gosauria, by Mr. Lucas, is still in course of preparation. He has also 
made studies of certain features in the structure of Ilesperornis and 
Bajdornis^ and has examined a collection of fossil birds from the 
Pliocene of Oregon, submitted by Prof. J. C. Merriam. 

Many specimens in the line of physical and chemical geology, 
requested for research work, have been supplied to assistants on the 
U. S. Geological Survey and to others, but the greatest amount of 
assistance rendered by this department has been given by the division 
of paleontology. Several eminent paleontologists have visited the 
Museum for the purpose of examining collections, and to a number of 
specialists material has been sent for investigation in their own labor- 
atories. Among those who received aid in this direction were the fol- 
lowing: Prof. H. F. Gsborn, of the American Museum of Natural 
History, in connection with his monograph on the fossil mammalian 
group of Titfinotheres; Dr. O. P. Hay and Mr. J. W. Gidley, of the 
same museum, the former having in preparation a work on the North 
American fossil turtles, and the latter a revision of the genus Hlppx)- 
the)"kmi, or fossil horses; Mr. J. B. Hatcher, of the Carnegie Museum, 
Pittsburg, material for comparison with fossil Dinosaurs; Dr. George

of Triassic fishes of the genus IscJtyjderus ; Mr. A. P. Martin, of the 
Maryland Geological Survey, and Dr. John M, Clarke, of the New 
York State Museum, in their researches on the Miocene and Devonian 
fossils, especially of Maryland; Prof. J. E. Duerden, of Johns Hop- 
kins University, on Paleozoic corals; Dr. C. E. Beecher, of the Pea-

Balch, of Boston, on arctic fossil shells; Mr. and Mrs. T. S. Oldroyd, 
of California, on the fossil shells of the Pacific coast. The entire col- 
lection of Middle Devonian crinoids was sent to Miss Elvira Wood, 
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who will classify and 
report upon the species. The collection of fossil plants from theCor- 
win coal mine at Cape Lisburne, Alaska, presented by Mr, A. G. 
Maddren, together with other specimens from, the same place, were 
turned over to Prof. William M. Fontaine, of the Universit}^ of Vir- 
ginia, for study in connection with material recently procured from 
the same locality by Mr. F. C. Schrader, of the U. S. Geological Sur- 
vey. Dr. Arthur Hollick, of the New York Botanical Garden, exam- 
ined the collections of Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary plants in 
connection with researches on some parts of those groups. 

PROGRESS IN TIIK INSTALLATION OF THE EXHIBITION ( < )LLE("riONS. 

The crowded state of most of the exhibition halls has prevented 
extensive additions to the display collections except in a few direc- 
tions. Much was accomplished, however, toward iniproxing th(>, con- 
dition and appearance of these collections l)y small additions and by 
the substitution in many instances of l)etter material and of a higher 
class of preparations. Considerable progress was also made toward 
completing the system of labeling. It had been anticipated that pro- 
vision would have to be made during the 3'ear for housing the exhibit 
made b}^ the Museum at the Pan-American ExpositioiL A large part 
of the material was, however, sent to the South Carolina Interstate 
and West Indian Exposition, but before the close of the year the 
entire collection was back in Washington. The oljjeets returned 
directly from Buffalo have been maiidy cared for l)y the transfer to 
storage of some of the less desirable preparations previously dis- 
pla3'ed, and by utilizing temporarily a part of the lecture hall. 

In the Department of Anthropology several of the halls have been 
thoroughly renovated and in some the collections have been rein- 
stalled. The cases in tht^. north-west range, devoted to the noithwest 
coast Indians, and in the Pueblo court, have l)een rearranged, and 
many have been removed to provide space for the large family groups 
returned from the Pan-American Exposition. Material from the 
Philippine and the South Sea Islands has been installed in Kensington 
cases on the north gallery of the west hall. 



40 EEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

The work of arranging the collections of prehistoric archeology 
according to geographical divisions has been continued, six slope-top 
cases liaving been fitted up during the j^ear with the following exhib- 
its: Flint implements from ancient quarr}" sites and workshops in 
middle Egypt; stone implements, spearheads, stone beads, shell orna- 
ments and small pottery vessels from the island of Utilla, Honduras; 
stone beads, carved stone pendants, a copper ax, pottery spindle- 
whorls, etc., from Mexico; stone implements and utensils, shell imple- 
ments, pottery vessels, etc., from the islands of St. Kitts, St. Barthol- 
omew, and Nevis, West Indies; polished stone hatchets from St. 
Elizabeths Parish, Jamaica; polished stone hatchets, shell implements, 
and large potter}^ bowls from Jamaica. In the alcove containing the 
antiquities from western Asia the plaster casts have been rearranged, 
and casts from Persepolis and a large relief map of Palestine have 
been added. 

Thirty-eight wing frames containing photographs supplementing 
the collections relating to the Jewish religion, Mohammedanism, 
Brahmanism, and the Greco-Roman religions have been placed on the 
south gallery of the west hall, and many improvements in this series 
have been made. 

Many articles have been added to the collections of American history 
in the noi'th hall, but this hall has long been overcrowded, and a 
number of interesting objects which belong to it are still in storage. 

Extensive improvements have been made in the installation of the 
collections in mechanical technology, especially in the sections of land 
and water transportation, and many additions have been made to the 
collections in electricit3\ The type collection of small firearms of 
early patterns and of modern breech-loading and magazine guns has 
been suitably installed and labeled. The series of time-keeping appa- 
ratus, including- some interesting recent additions, has been ai'ranged 
in special cases in the east hall. Noteworthy among its contents are 
a variety of sundials, including one used l)y the Montagnais Indians 
of Canada — a pole set upright in the snow — several rare sunglasses, a 
fine Persian astrolobe, a German time-indicating lamp, a water clock 
of the seventeenth century, and ^vatches dating from the beg-inning of 
the fifteenth century. 

Among the additions in the Department of Biology were many 
finely mounted specimens of American manmials and birds, a part of 
the display at the Pan-American Exposition, the former including a 
large specimen of Steller's sea lion, an Alaskan moose, a British Colum- 
bian caribou, a musk ox, a glacier and a Kadiak bear, two wild sheep 
{Ovis dalli and O. Honel), and a skeleton of the Kadiak bear. Three 
groups of game l)irds Avere added to the series of game animals. In 
the southeast Museum range, allotted to reptiles, batrachians, and 
fishes, some improvements have been made, several new cases being 



EEPOET OF AiSSIiSTANT SE0KP:TAKY. 41 

provided, many new preparations rcplacinj^- older ones, and a number 
of large forms not previously represented being added. Among the 
latter were a cast of the King Co})ra snake with accessories represent- 
ing the edge of an Indian jungle, a very large Mata-mata turtle from 
the Amazon Rivei-, a hugh alligator snapper, the largest of the North 
American watei" turtles, se^'eral boas, lizards, toads, and frogs. An 
exhibit of lizards will be arranged in some of the wall cases. Among 
the additions to the exhibition series of tishes was the cast of a large 
white, or man-eater, shark. 

The permanent installation of insects in the hall lecenlly assigned 
to this group at the western end of the Smithsonian building has pro- 
gressed to the extent of mounting al^out 2,700 specimens in 21) of the 
standard boxes occupying several upright cases. Tn tlu^ labeling of 
this series attention has especially been called to speci(\s of peculiar 
habits and to those of most interest to the puV>lic. 

A partial set of the colored plates of dowering plants, pul)lished in 
the third edition of Blanco's Flora de Filipinas, has been placed on 
exhibition in the Division of Botany. 

To the display of vertebrate fossils have been added partial skele- 
tons of the large Trlceratops prorsii^, of the carnivorous dinosaur, 
Allomurus, and of the toothed bird, [lesperonuH ■r<yal!-'<. The instal- 
lation of the Harris collection of invertebrate fossils, in a section of 
the rail-case of the gallei'v in the southeast court, has ])een practically 
completed. This collection, i-eceived in lS!t,S, is one of the finest 3'et 
made in the region it represents, being especially rich in crinoids, star- 
fishes, and trilobites, containing of the last group al)()ut (!0(> out of the 
750 species known from the (Cincinnati formation. 

The collections relating to physical and chemical geology ha\'e, in 
part, been thoroughly overhauled and rearranged, and about loo pho- 
tographs, maps, and other pictures illustratixc of these subjects ha\"e 
been placed on the adjoining walls. The building of galleries in the 
south-west range made it necessary to remove for a time the collection 
of minerals, which at the close of the year was being reinstalled after 
careful renovation.

Revolutiou, tlicn in .session in tlie city. Tlie PresicUuit-oencnil and 
other officers of the society received in the lecture hall. As th(>. build- 
ing is a public one, no one who applied was denied admission, though 
the attendance was chiefly made up of mem])ers of the society. The 
total number present was 2,087. 

The meetings of the National Academy of Sciences were also held 
this year in the Museum building* on April IT), K), and IT. Th<> offices 
of the assistant secretary were used for the l)usiii('ss meetings of the 
academy and eouncil, while the reading of [)ai)ers took })la<'e in the 
lecture hall. 

CORRESPONDENCE. 

The Museum correspondence, which has always been very hetivy, 
increases in volume from year to year. Outside of ordiu'iry routine 
matters, it is occasioned for the most part 1)y requests for informa- 
tion, coming" from all parts of the world and relating to a wide range 
of sul)jects. Specimens, often in large lots, are transmitted for iden- 
titication, and (juestions are sul)mitted in regard to all branches of 
knowledge falling within the Museum's scc^pe. The requests also 
have reference to Museum administration, the building up and main- 
tenance of collections, the construction of cases, the installation, label- 
ing, and cataloguing of spec-imens, and, in fact, no topic connect(Hl 
with a great museimi or suggested by its existence escapes notice. In 
accordance with the time-honored custom of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion, every comnuuiication made in good taitli and a[)pi"opriate to t)e 
considered is fully answered, even though this necessitates incessant 
demands upon the niendjers of the scientitic stafl', whose regular duties 
are quite sufficient to occupy their entires time. The muuber of lots 
of specimens determined and reported upon during the year at the 
requ<'st of correspondents was nearly TOO. 

A considerable proportion of the work of furnishing information is 
accomplished through the medium of Museum })ul)lications, of which 
more than 2U,00(» volumes and pamphlets wen^ distributed during the 
year, besides the sendings to regular correspondents. 

As the Museum has no facilities for making chemical analyses, 
requests for work of this kind have to be refused. 

PUBLICATIONS. 

The most noteworthy publication of the year was the first volume 
of a monographic series by Mr. Robert Ridgway on the Birds of 
North and Middle America, which appeared in the autumn of 11)01. 
This volume describes the species of the family Fringillida' or Finches. 
The families Tanagridae, Icteridie, Coerebidaj, and Mniotiltida', or 
Tanagers, Troupials, Honey-creepers, and Wood-warblers will })e cov 



44 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

ered by the second volume, now in press. Mr. Ridgway has given 
much time and care to the preparation of this important work. 

Volume XXIII of the Proceedings was issued in February, 1902. 
It contains 35 papers (numbered from 1206 to 12-1:(», inclusive), 24 of 
which Avere written by members of the Museum stall' and 11 by cor- 
respondents and collaborators. Eight of the papers relate to fishes, 
mainly Japanese, 7 to insects, and the remainder to fossil vertebrates, 
reptiles, recent and fossil moUusks, marine invertebrates, and plants. 
Proceedings papers 1241 to 1274, inclusive, comprising Volume xxiv, 
have been published in the form of separates. 

A most useful work produced during the year, constituting Bulletin 
51, was a list of the publications of the Museum, being- a catalogue of 
all volumes and separate papers issued from 1875 to 1900, with an 
index b}' titles. It was prepared by Mr. R. I. Geare. 

The papers comprising the general appendix to the annual report 
for 1900 have been issued in separate form, but the volume itself was 
not received from the Government Printing" Office until after the close 
of the year. The opening- article, by Mr. W. H. Holmes, is based on 
anthropological investigations by the author in California. Prof. 
O. T. Mason descri])es some aboriginal American harpoons. Mr. 
Charles K. Wead, of the United States Patent Office, contributes an 
article on tiic history of nnisical scales, and Dr. Walter Hough one on 
Hopi ceremonial pigments. A sketch of the history of ceramic art in 
China, with a catalogue of the Hippisley collection of Chinese porce- 
lains, is reprinted, with some additions, from the report of 1888. The 
author, Mr. Alfred E. Hippisley, commissioner of the imperial mari- 
time customs sen-vice of China, has had on deposit in the National 
Museuu) for several j^ears a most interesting and valuable collection of 
Chinese porcelains, and is well fitted to write upon this subject. A 
catalog-ue of the collection of gems in the National Museum, by Mr. 
Wirt Tassin, contains descriptions of the gem minerals and their prop- 
erties, comparative tables of the colors and distinguishing characters 
of the principal varieties, and ai'ticles on the cutting of gems, their 
artificial formation, sup])osed mystical properties, etc. A descriptive 
catalogue of the meteorite collection, by the same author, is designed 
partly to facilitate the exchange of specimens. 

Part N of Bulletin No. 39, entitled Directions for Collecting and 
Preparing study Specimens of small Mammals, by Mr. Gerrit S. 
Miller, has been reprinted in a revised edition, with abstracts in Ger- 
man, French, and Spanish. Directions for collectors of American 
Basketry, by Prof. O. T. Mason, has been added to the same bulletin 
as Pait P. 

A (drcular designed to accompany a series of collections prepared by 
the Museum, illustrating rock weathering and soil formation, and

giving* the results of the analyses of materials similar to those included 
in the collections, has been prepared by Dr. (leorge P. ^Merrill, and 
published as No. 51 in the Museum series of circulars. 

The disti-ilnition of Museum publications during the 3^ear to estab- 
lishments and individuals in this country and abroad has amounted to 
about 6,500 volumes and 25,000 pamphlets. 

In Appendix TV will be found a list of the publications of the 
Museum and of the members of its stall'. The number of authors 
represented is 1>1 and the total number of papers cited P)27. In the

PHOTOGRAPHY. 



Mr. '^P. W. Smillie, the photographer of the Museum, reports that 
1,621 negatives, 2,890 silver prints, 378 platinum prints, 32 lantern 
slides, and 2,060 blue prints were made during the year. A part of 
his time was also allotted to the Zoological Park, the Bureau of Inter- 
national Exchanges, and the Astrophysical Observator3\ 

Mr. Smillie was appointed chairman of the jury of awards on pho- 
tography for the Pan-American Exposition, causing his absence from 
Washington during about a month of the summer of 1901. While 
serving in this capacity he made a large number of photographs of 
different exhil)its for the (rovernment Board of the Exposition. 

TAXIDERMY AND OSTEOLOGICAL WORK. 

Fifty-two maumials, including a specimen of Steller's sea lion, were 
mounted during the year and added to the exhibition series. Eighty- 
tive si)ecimcns in the tiesh, from the National Zoological Park and 
other sources, were received and properly treated. Between 300 antl 
400 of the small skins in vats were freed from grease and made over 
into suitable form for permanent preservation. These included a 
number of type specimens. Three new groups of game birds were 
completed during the .year, and 38 large birds and 12 smaller ones 
were also mounted. Fifty-one skins were prepared from birds received 
in the flesh, and 112 specimens in the exhibition series were dismounted 
and made into skins. 

One thousand and sixty-four skulls of mammals, mostly of large 
size, were cleaned b}^ the Museum preparators, and more than 2,100 
small skulls were cleaned by contract. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 47 

COOPERATION OF THp: EXECUTIVK DEPARTMENTS OP THE <!OVEKNMENT. 

Valuable assistance has continued to be received from various depart- 
ments and bureaus of the Government. Officers of the Army and 
Nav}" stationed in the Philippine Islands and in other of the iumv pos- 
sessions have made important contrilnitrons, having in some cases l)een 
furnished with special outfits to facilitate their work of collecting. 
Representatives of the Department of State abroad have also ))een 
instrumental in securing interesting material. Special aclvnowledg- 
ments are due to the Quartermaster's Department of the Army for 
many courtesies in connection with the transportation of specimens 
and outfits to and from distant points. Th(A relations of the ]\ruseum 
to the IT. S. (Tcological Survey, the U. S. Fish Conunission, the P)io- 
logical Survey, and the Divisions of Entomology and Botany of the 
Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of American Ethnology, 
in regard to collections transmitted, are referred to elsewhere. 

Through the courtesy of the Secretaiy of the Na\'y, Lieut. W. PI 
SaflFord. U. S. Navy, who was stationed for some time on the island of 
Guam, was permitted to sj^end several months at the Museum during 
the winter of 1901-2 in classifying and labeling collections of anthro- 
pology from the South Sea Islands. 

EXPOSITIONS. 

Pan-Atnet'ican J^xposition^ Buffalo, .New J^crk. — This (exposition 
was opened on May 1, 1901, and continued imtil Noveml)er 1 of the 
same year. The large and attractive exhibit made by tiic National 
Museum has been described in the Annual Report for 1901, in a- joint 
paper by Dr. Frederick W. True, the representative of the Smith- 
sonian Institution and the Museum on the Government Board of Man- 
agement, and Mr. William H. Holmes and I^r. George P. Merrill, 
head curators, respective!}^, of anthropology and geologv.

In accordance with the direction of the President of the United States 
that the Executive Departments and l)ureaus of the Government par- 
ticipate in this exposition, which continued from December 1, 1901, 
until May 31, 1902, a large collection selected from the exhibit of the 
Museum at the Pan-American Exposition was shipped directly to 
Charleston, the limitations of space making it impossible to utilize the 
entire exhibit in that connection. Notwithstanding the short })eriod 
available for arranging this display, it presented a line appearance and 
attracted nuich attention. A report l;)y Dr. F. W. True on the exhibit 
of the National Museum at this exposition is printed as Appendix V 
to this report.

appropriated $4:50,000 toward tho erection of a (xovernment building 
and SSOO.OOo for tho preparation and installation of an exhibit by the 
several departments and bureaus of the Government. Dr. Frederick 
\\ . True, Head Curator of Biolo«»v, and with a long experience in 
exposition work, has been appointed to represent the Smithsonian 
Institution and the National ^luseum on the Government Board of 
Management. 

ORGANIZATIOX AND STAFF. 

The organization of the Museum comprises an administrative office 
and three scientitic departments, as follows: Anthropology, with 8 
divisions and -t sections: Biology, Avith divisions and 1:2 sections; 
and Geology, with o divisions and 3 sections. 

Besides th(^ o head curators in charge of the departments, the 
scientitic stati' at the close of the year consisted of 17 curators, 12 
assistant curators. 14 custodians. 11 aids, i associates, and '2 collabo- 
rators, making a total of 63 persons, of whom, however, only about 
one-half received compensation from the Museum. Of the remainder, 
who are serving in a V(dunteer or honorary capacity, the majority 
were attached to other scientitic bureaus of the Government. 

The tleatli of Dr. Thomas Wilson, which occurred on May 1, 11*02, 
deprived the ^Museum of one of its most earni>st and helpful workers. 
Widely distinguished for his studies and contrilnitions on a variety of 
anthropological subjects. Dr. Wilson's interests lay chiefly in the field 
of prehistoric archeology, and from 1880 he had charge, as curator, 
of the extensive and important collections of this division of the 
Museum. 

Mr. William \'. Cox, who was appointed to the ^Museum in 1879, 
and has l)een its chief clerk since 188ii. with important duties in con- 
nection with all the recent expositions in which the Government has 
participated, severed his official relations with the Museum in Feb- 
ruary. 1002, greatly to the regret of his associates, to accept a more 
responsible position elsewhere. The duties of this office have been 
somewhat modified to better consolidate the administrative work, and 
the title of its chief officer has been changed to administrative assist- 
ant. This position was filled by the appointment of ]Mr. W. de C. 
Ravenel, previously the assistant in charge of fish t-ulture in the U. S. 
Fish Commission, who has joined to a long experience in the adminl^- 
trative work of that Bureau a familiarity with the preparation and 
installation of Government exhibits. 

Mr. George B. Turner has been made chief taxidermist, and Mr. 
W. C. Phalen an aid in the Department of Geology. Dr. Peter Fire- 
man, chemical geologist, resigned on September 0.

NECROLOGY. 

Dr. Tiiomas Wilson. Curator of the Division of Prehistoric Arche- 
ology in the National Museum, died on ^lay 4, 1'.HI2. He was born 
in New Brighton, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, on July is, 1S32. 
H(^ li\'ed for a time in Ohio. Illinois, and Missouri, and later in Iowa, 
enlisting in the Second Iowa Cavalry at the beginning of the civil war. 
He served in the cavalry and infantrv ])ranches of the sei'vice until 
1864 and was mustered out with tin; rank of colonel. For a number 
of 3'ears he was engaged in the practice of law, from which he retired 
in 1881 to enter the consular service of the United States. He rei)re- 
sented this country at Ghent, Nantes, and Nice. His service as consul 
extended over a period of tivo 3'ears, after which he spent two years in 
traveling. 

During his residence a])road Dr. Wilson devoted a great deal of 
attention to the study of archeology, visited many of the localities 
where ancient treasures were to be found, and had opportunitiivs for 
meeting and working with several of th(; noted anthrop<jlogists of 
Europe. After returning to this country, ho was placed in charge of 
the Division of Prehistoric Archeology in the U. S. National Museum, 
which position he held from 1880 to the time of his death. He was a 
mendjer of the Societe d'Anthropologie de Paris, the Societe d'Arch- 
eologie de Nantes, the Anthropological Institute of (Ireat I^ritain and 
Ireland, the Order of Isal)ella of Spain, and the Order of Leopold; also 
vice-president of the Anthropological Society of Washington, a fellow 
of the American Association for the Advancement of Scien(<\ a mem- 
ber of the American Oriental Societ}' and of the Military Order of the 
Loval Legion. Dr. Wilson was a member of the Commission to the 
Madrid Exposition of 1803, and of the Commission to the Brussels 
Exposition in 1807, and a delegate to the International Congi'ess of 
Archeology in Paris in lO(»0. 

Some of the important papers })ul)lished by Dr. \\'ilson are as 
follows: The Swastika, the earliest known Symbol, and its Migra- 
,tions, with Observations on the Migration of certain Industries in pre- 
historic Times; Prehistoric Art, or the Origin of Art as manifested 
in the Work of Prehistoric Man; Arrowpoints, Spearheads, and 
Knives of Prehistoric Times; The Golden Patera of Rennes; A 
Study of Prehistoric Anthropology; and Anthropology at the Paris 
Exposition. 

Mr. Charles T. Mohr, a generous benefactor of the National Museum, 
was born in Esslingen, Wurtemberg, December 28, 1824, and died at 
NAT MUS 1002- 4 



50 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

Asheville, North Carolina, July 17, 1901. Although most of his life 
was spent in the calling of a druggist, jet Dr. Mohr devoted much of 
his time to the study of plants, and it is chiefly as a botanist that he is 
known to the scientific world. He came to the United States in 1848, 
having previously traveled to South America. He stopped first in 
Cincinnati, but early the next 3'ear started for California. In 1857 he 
settled at Mobile, Alabama, where he was engaged in the drug busi- 
ness for many years. After making numerous smaller contributions, 
he finally gave his entire private herbarium, comprising some 20,000 
specimens, to the Smithsonian Institution, the cryptogamic plants hav- 
ing come as a gift about two years before his death, and the flowering 
plants as a bequest. This collection has now been installed and is 
accessible to students of Southern plants, in which it is especially rich. 
Dr. Mohr was the author of various botanical papers, but his crown- 
ing work was Plant Life of Alabama, which was published posthu- 
mously. It was the one regret of his last days not to see this work 
finished, but he corrected all of the proofs and died only two weeks 
before the volume was issued. Personally Dr. Mohr was a charming 
and lovable man.

REPOET ON THE DEPARTMENT OP ANTHROPOLOGY 
FOR THE YEAR 1901-2. 

By William II. Holmes, 
IL'iid Citrafof. 

During the year a number of changes in the personnel of the 
Department have taken place. Dr. Thomas Wilson, curator of the 
Division of Prehistoric Archeology, died on May 4, 1902, after an 
illness of several months. On May 1 Mr. Paul Brockett was trans- 
ferred from the position of clerk to the Head Curator, to the lil)rary 
of the Smithsonian Institution, and Mr. Paul Beckwith, Aid in the 
Division of History and Biography, was designated to till his place 
temporarily. In June, Miss Louise A. Rosenbusch, stenographer, 
wcs transferred from the office of the curator of Prehistoric Arche- 
ology to that of the Head Curator. 

WORK OF THE TEAR. 

The work of the yenv in the Department has been carried forward 
with all possible dispatch. The extensive exhibit shown at the Pan- 
American Expositi(Hi in Buffalo has been returned and reinstalled in 
the Museum, constituting a very considerable addition to tlu^ exhibi- 
tion series. -The exhibit sent to Charleston was returned about the 
close of the year and will ))e placed on exhibition at an early date. 

The energies of the Department have been in a great measure 
expended on the work of reinstalling the exhibits in halls in which 
galleries were l)uilt' during the year. The occasion was taken to 
rearrange cases, perfect the ( lassification, and improve thi^ instalhi- 
tion; and the close of tiu^ yeav tinds the exhibition series of the 
department nnich enlarged and in every way improved. The new 
galleries afford nmch additional space for laboratory purposes and for 
storage. 

colle(;tions. 

The collections received during the yenv are of average importance, 
and a number of them are enumerated in the following list: 

COLLECTED FOR THE MUSEUM. 

1. Archeological collection, consisting of a large number of flint 
implements, uten;;.:L; of '^one, and the remains of extinct and recent

3. Explorations in Arizona conducted jointly by Mr. Peter G. Gates 
and the National Museum, the latter represented by Dr. Walter 
Hough, yielded large collections of archeological material. One-half 
of the product, consisting of 701 specimens, was turned over to the 
Museum. These collections are to be regarded as in large part a 
gift to the Museum by Mr. Gates, as the expenses of the field work 
were defrayed by him.

CARE OF COLLECTIONS. 

The various collections received by the Department have been cata- 
log'ued and cared for as in previous years. Much attention has been 
given to the important work of destro3dng insect pests, and the 
Department is now practically rid of them. The cataloguing- is quite 
up to date, and considerable work has been done on the recataloguing 
of collections imperfectly entered in previous years. 

In the laboratories much work has been accomplished. Numerous 
casts of specimens have been made, a large number of vases have been 
mended, and copies and models of many objects pertaining to the 
Division of Technology have been constructed. 

INSTALLATION OF EXHIBITS. 

As already indicated, much ])rogress has been made in the work of 
installing exhi))its. Not only have the Exposition exhil)its been 
placed, but several of tlic halls have been entirel}" reinstalled and the 
display made more attractive and instructive. La])eling has received 
especial attention and is more nearly complete than at any previous 
period. 

8TOKA(!E. 

Owing to the crowded condition of the Museum, a large bod}' of 
material, comprising a considerable percentage of valuable specimens, 
has been stored in outside buildings. During the year an attempt has 
been made to iind space for the more important stoi-age material 
within the Museum building, and nothing is now sent out which has 
any special value or which could not readily be replaced in case of loss. 

FIELD WORK. 

The field work of this j^ear has not been extensive. Dr. Walter 
Hough continued explorations in Arizona b(>giui during the preceding 



ilEPOKT OF ASSISTANT SECRETAKY. 57 

year, having taken up on June 1 of the preceding year the joint explo- 
ration arranged between the Mu.seuni and Mr. P. (i. (iate.s, wlio fur- 
nished the equipment. This portion of the season was spent in making 
an areheological section from Fort Apache to Molvi, about ISO mik^s 
on a north and south line, with good results. Ethnological work was 
done among the White Mountain Apaches, the Navahos, and Hopi, 
After the close of the Museum-Ciates expedition, Dr. Hough mapjx'd 
two new groups of ruins north of Holbrook, returning to AVashington 
on September 22. During the season 00 ruins were visited and 18 
excavated, many plans of ruins were made, and ?).(•(>(» specimens 
collected. 

The Head Curator spent a few weeks in areheological exploratioii in 
the Middle West. A visit was made to Kimmswick, Missouri, where 
examinations were made of an extensive deposit of fossil mammals 
with which human remains were said to be associated, and to an 
ancient village site where numerous specimens of pottery and stone 
implements were secured. Later, collections were secured from an 
ancient chert quarry on the Peoria Indian Reservation, Indian Terri- 
tor}^, and important explorations were made at Afton, Indian Terri- 
tory. Reports had reached the Museum from Dr. R. H. Harper, of 
Afton, of the occurrence of Hint implements in association with fossil 
animals in a sulphur spring near that place. The spring w^as cleaned 
out and about 800 very interesting implements were obtained, as well 
as a great num])er of remains of fossil and recent animals. It was 
determined that the fossil bones Avere connected with the original 
deposits through which the spring rises and that the spring had been 
made a place of sacrifice by the Indian tri])es. and various articles had 
been cast in as offering-^s to their gods. 

The Head Curator also made a short trip into Pennsylvania, examin- 
ing ancient soapstonc^ ipiarries near Christiana, Lancastei' (V)unty. and 
rhyolite (piarries in South Mountain, Adams C'ounty. 

Dr. W. L. AI)bott has continued his exploration in the East Indies, 
and has forwarded important ethnological collections from Ja\ a and 
elsewhere. 

KESEAKCHES. 

The Head Curator continued his investigations in several branches 
of aboriginal art, papers on potter}^ and stone implements being under 
way. Particular attention Avas given to the completion of a paper on 
the "Classification and arrangement of the collections of an anthro- 
pological museum." 

Prof. O. T. Mason, Curator of the Division of Ethnology, has con- 
tinued his investigations on aboriginal basketry, and has devoted much 
time to the preparatk)n of an extensive work on this subject. Assist- 
ant Curator Walter Hough was engaged largely, after his return from 



58 KEPOfiT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

the field of his explorations in Arizona, in preparing- a catalogue of his 
extensive collection, and writing his report. 

Lieut. W. E. Safford, U. S. Navy, has prosecuted studies for a num- 
ber of months, g'iving especial attention to the ethno-botany of Guam, 
and his paper is approaching- completion. 

The papers l)ased on Museum material, published during the year 
by the Head Curator, Professor Mason, Dr. Hough, and Dr. Thomas 
Wilson, are mentioned l)y title in the Bibliograph}^ (Appendix IV). 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY 
FOR THE YEAR 1901-2. 

By Frederick \V. True, 
■ Head Curator. 

The work of the fiscal 3^ear l!)01-2 has heen characterized by con- 
tinued effort ak)no- lines already laid down rather than by new 
departures. The collections have grown steadily and the scientitic 
investigation of new accessions has progressed continuously. 

The zoological collections of the National Museum liave grown to 
iimnense size, rivaling, and in some cases surpassing, those of any 
other museum. Of insects there are in the Government collection 
nearly 1,500,000 specimens; of recent shells lunirly 1,000,000 speci- 
mens; besides at least 500,000 specimens of other acpiatic invertebrates, 
about 200,000 specimens of fishes, more than 6(),()()0 1>irds' eggs, 
130,000 specimens of ])irds, more than 40,00(» reptiles and batrachians, 
and between 75,000 and 100, ()()() specimens of mauunals, including the 
collection of the Biological Survey, U. S. Department of Agriculture. 

The Pan-American Exposition (opened May 1, 1901, closi^d Novem- 
ber 2, 1902) continued until the end of the tirst third of the tiscal year 
covered by this report, and was followed by the South Carolina Expo- 
sition (opened Deceml)er 1, 1901, closed May 31, 1902), which con- 
tinued until the close of the year. At both of these expositions 
exhibits were made by the divisions dealing with vertel)i'ates. A full 
account of the Pan-American exhibit will be found in the Amuial 
Report for 1900-1901, pages 177-231. 

EXHIBITION (U)LL?:CTIONS. 

The principal improvements were in the halls devoted tt) the exhibi- 
tion of insects and reptiles and batrachians. At the close of the last 
year there were on exhibition 73 reptile casts and 11 batrachian casts. 
The number of the former has been increased to 78 and of the latter 
to 13. These figures do not give a just idea of the real improvement 
made. Three new cases were provided and mau}^ inferior casts were 
replaced by better ones, and several very large forms not previously 
represented were added. These include a king cobra snake, with 
accessories representing the edge of an Indian jungle; a vevy large

6U REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901 

Amazon River turtle {Podocnemys)\ a niata-mata turtle, one of the 
most remarkable of existing- animals; a huge alligator snapper, the 
largest of North American fresh-water turtles; several large boas and 
other snakes, together Avith \arious lizards, toads, and frogs. The 
series is far finer than ever ))efore shown in the Museum. The space 
available has now been practically all taken up, except certain cases 
against the walls, in which it is proposed to make an exhibit of speci- 
mens of lizards in formalin of species too small to cast. The entire 
series shown, with but one or two exceptions, is American, and chiefly 
North American. The reptile faunas of the Old World can not be 
shown in the present restricted quarters. 

An opportunity was found in April to pro(;eed with the mounting 
of a new insect exhibit, for which preparations were long under way. 
With the aid of special assistants, the entire series ol North American 
beetles was mounted, and in June placed on exhibition. This series 
occupies 20 standard exhibition boxes and comprises a))out 2,700 
insects, representing (582 species. The collection is very carefully 
installed and labeled, and in the case of species having habits or pecul- 
iarities of more than ordinary interest the facts are briefly mentioned 
in untechnical language. Work on other orders was progressing' 
favorably at the close of the j^ear. 

In other classes than those mentioned the improvement of the exhi- 
bition series was less marked, though many fine mounted specimens of 
Amej'ican mammals and birds exhibited at Bufl'alo were added. The 
portion of the Pan-American exhibit sent to the Charleston Exposition 
was returned just at the close of the fiscal year. The chief taxider- 
mist, with the occasional help of one assistant, completed about 50 
mammals for exhibition during the j^ear, including one very large speci- 
men, a Steller's sea-lion. This spe.'imen had originally been planned 
for the Pan- American Expositic -^ bi t coukl not b(^ exhibited for lack 
of space. It replaced a similar irtounted specimen which had been on 
exhil)ition over twenty-five years and had deteriorated. Mention of 
the principal vertebrates exhibited at Bufl'ak) and now in the Museum 
will be found in my previous report (p. ()H) and in (lie A})pendix to the 
Museum Report for 1901 (p. 1S5). 

The two large wall maps in the ])ird hall, representing the faunal 
areas of the globe, were repainted and lettered, so as to be more intel- 
ligible to the general public. Three new groups of American game 
birds Avere added to the series begun last year, but the work could not 
be continued further for lack of funds. A fine skeleton of the Kadiak 
bear, presented by Mr. J. H. Kidder, and a skeleton of the giant 
salamander of Japan, presented by Dr. C. Ishikawa, were added to 
the exhibition series of the division of comparative anatom3\ New 
wall cases for the south end of the south hall were under construction 
during the year, but not completed. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 61 

The descriptive labels for vertebrates prepared for the Buffalo 
Exposition were made use of in the permanent exhil)ition series as far 
as practicable. The great series of labels of all kinds which had 
accuujulated in the editor's office and was transferred to the custody 
of the head curator some time ago, was examined ])y the curators of 
tii€ .-f^voral divisions, and such labels as were no longer of use wei'c 
picked out and c^/N^arded. Typewritten labels, many of them descrip- 
ive, were prepared for the new exhibition series of North American 
Coleoptera. 

KXPLORATIONS. 

As noted in last year's report, Mr. W. H. Ashmcad, Assistant Cura- 
tor, Division of Insects, accompanied the U. S. Fish Commission expe- 
dition to the Hawaiian Islands for the purpose of collecting insects. 
He left Washington in May, lOOl, and returned in September, I'.HJl, 
having been in the islands about three months. An expedition to 
Arizona for the purpose of collecting insects was undertaken by Mr. 
E. A. Schwarz, Custodian of Coleoptera, at his own expense. He also 
paid the expenses of an assistant, and very generously turned over to 
the Museum the large collection made. He was in the held from May 
to August, 1901. Dr. H. G. Dyar, Custodian of Lepidoptera, accom- 
panied l)y Mr. A. N, Caudell, who was detailed from tlie LT. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, made a very successful expedition to Colorado 
for collecting Lepidoptera. The work occupied a1)out two months — 
from May, 1901, to July, 1901. By invitation of Dr. Edward Palmer, 
Messrs. C. L. Pollard and William Palmer, of the ]\Iuseum, spent two 
months in eastern Cuba in the spring of 1902, and collected plants, 
birds, bats, insects, and marine invertebrates. The Head Curator vis- 
ited the whaling station of the Cabot Steam Whaling Company on the 
south coast of Newfoundland in June, 1901, and obtained nuich valu- 
able information regarding the Sulphurbottom whales there taken, 
and many photographs. He made arrangements for obtaining a skel 
eton of one of these large animals at a later date. B}" arran<,'; -ment 
with the War Department, Mr. B. S. Bowdish, a private isi the Army, 
was detailed to make collections of birds in Porto Ei';o, Mona Island 
and eastern Cul)a. This work was carried on in the winter of 1901-02 
and occupied al)out seven months. Late in the fiscal year Mr. R. 
Ridgway, Curator, Division of Birds, spent two months in .southern 
Illinois in collecting birds for t'lG Museum. In the summer of 1901 
Dr. J. N. Rose, Assistant Cr <,tor, Division of Plants, accompanied 
by Mr. Robert Hay, assistant, spent ten weeks in central Mexico in 
botanical explorations. He :: icended Mount Orizaba and Mount Popo- 
catepetl, and from each mi untain obtained a large series of plants, 
some of which were broi ghc. living to the United States and deposited 
in greenhouses of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, where they 
are now gTowing. 



62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

ACCESSIONS. 

The largest accessions of the 3'ear were Dr. W\ L. Abbott's East 
Indian collections; a collection of insects from Arizona, comprising 
65,000 specimens, made by Mr. E. A. Schwarz; the bequest of Dr. 
Charles Mohr, consisting of 18,500 flowering plants, and the collec- 
tions of invertebrates transmitted bj^ the U. 8. Fish Commission. 

Dr. W. L. Abbott continued his zoological explorations in the East 
Indies during the year, making numsrous interesting discoveries, and 
sending to the Museum great numbers of valuable specimens, espe- 
cially manmials, ])irds, reptiles, and ijisects. Dr. Abbott's field of 
operations during the j'ear was in the South China Sea, between 
Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and Borneo. Three months (January 
to March, 1901) he spent in exploring the Andaman and Nicobar 
islands, accompanied by Mr. C. B. Kloss. From May 26 to August 
7, 1901, he visited various groups of small islands immediately east of 
Singapore and also the coast and rivers of Johore. In August and 
September, 1901, he explored the Indragiri River, Sumatra, and the 
neighboring islands Linga and Sinkep. Linga Island had been 
visited b}" him previously in July, 1899, on which occasion he was 
accompanied by Mr. C. B. Kloss. 

From the Andaman and Nicobar islands Dr. AlJ:)ott sent to the 
Museum 278 mammals, among which were specimens of 15 new 
species. This collection is by far the most complete ever brought 
together from these islands and greatly increased the knowledge of 
their mannnal fauna. In Sumatra and Linga and Sinkep islands 166 
mammals were obtained, including representatives of 11 new species. 
Among the latter was a new pig related to the Borneo pig {Sics har- 
hatiis)^ and named Siis o! by Mr. G. S. Miller, ji-. It is one of the most 
interesting of Dr. Al)bott's many discoveries in the Malay I'egion. 
From Johore and various islands to the eastward Dr. Abbott obtained 
401 mammals for the Museum. This material has not yet been 
thoroughly examined, but is known to be extremely valuable. The 
great collections of mammals of the East Indies resulting from Dr. 
Al)b()tt''s extensive and long-continued ex})lorations are unrivaled, and 
the mammal fauna of the region which they cover can now be studied 
to better advantage in the National Museum than in any other 
establishment. 

Besides mammals, Dr. Abbott collected over 700 birds, a large series 
of eggs of the Nicobar Island Megapode, Megapodius nicaharensis^ 
reptiles and batrachians, and numerous insects. The reptiles and 
batrachians are the first the Museum has received from the Nicobar 
and Andaman islands. 

Dr. A, Donaldson Smith presented 6 African antelopes and 2 mon- 
keys, and also 81 birds, from Somaliland, the first from that region 
which the Museum has received. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY, 63 

Amono- the important specimens received from the Fish Commis- 
sion were the types of the tishes MisticJdhi/s ficwnen.si.s^ of the Phil- 
ippine Islands, and fuil(>j>/(!(i.s fafuwr/, together with the sponges 
collected in Porto Rico in 181»!>, and identitied l>y Dr. H. V. Wilson, 
and the holothurians and echini from the same locality, identitied ])y 
Prof, H. L. Clark. Added to these were the crustaceans and cchino- 
derms collected by the Commission in the Hawaiian Islands in l!)01; 
about 1,500 specimens of common species of invertel»rates from Woods 
Hole, Massachusetts, intended to be made up into sets for distribution 
to educational institutions; about 1,300 shells and 2,Tr)(l packages of 
miscellaneous invertelirates of other classes which had accumulated in 
the laboratories of the Commission; and seven lots of craytishes from 
Maine, The Commission also transmitted a collection of about 300 
plants made l)y Messrs. Evermann and Clark in Indiana. 

The Museum having agreed to publish a series of papers l)y Presi- 
dent I). S. Jorda)i, the Leland Stanford Junior University presented 
a collection of Japanese tishes, including-the types of species described 
by Dr, Jordan. Collections of fishes from Panama and Cocos and 
Galapagos Islands, and of crustaceans from the Hopkins-Stanford 
Galapagos Expedition of 189S-00 were also presented. 

The Museum purchased from Prof. Pashford Dean some excellently 
preserved reptiles and invertebrates from Negros Island, Philippine 
Islands, and Professor Dean presented a collection of fishes from the 
Nile River, 

A collection of about 300 birds, including many species of importance, 
was obtained for the IVIuseum l)y Mr. B. S. Bowdish in Cul»a and Porto 
Rico (see Explorations, p. 61), Mr, Bowdish also obtained several 
exceedingly rare reptiles, and one new species from these islands, and 
collected reptiles in Mona Island, from whicli the Museum had not 
previously received specimens. Other collections of Cuban reptiles 
and birds were ol)tained by Mr, William Palmer during a two months' 
sojourn at the eastern end of the island. 

MmnmaU.—A. remarka])ly fine skeleton of an adult Kadiak (Alaska) 
bear was presented b}^ Mr. J, H, Kidder, The skeleton conveys an 
even more vivid impression of the strength of this huge beast than the 
mounted skin recently added to the collection, l\Ir, Harry Pidgeon 
presented an excellent series of skins of the wild sheep of the north- 
ern Rocky Mountains, Oris utoneL The Museum was fortunate in 
obtaining numerous additions to its collection of bats during the year, 
amounting in all to about 260 specimens, of which 35 were from the 
Philippine Islands; 58 specimens were the gift of Mr. Charles E. 
Ashcroft, jr., U, S, Weather Observer at Roseau, Dominica Island, 
West Indies. 

Dr, E, A, Mearns, U, S, Army, having received word of the strand- 
ing of a small whale near Newport, Rhode Island, notified the Museum 



64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

of the occurrence, and a preparator was detailed to obtain the skeleton. 
Through the good offices of Capt. James Sodermann the specimen was 
held for the Museum. It proved to be the ziphioid, or bottlenose, 
whale, Ziphiuhi cavvro^tri^. The specimen was adult, and the skeleton 
is I'emarkably line. 

The Museum obtained by purchase about 275 specimens of obscure 
and little-known species of small mammals from Germany; 104 mam- 
mals of Ecuador, including- an undescribed species of native cat, named 
Fells xquatorialls^ by Dr. E. A. Mearns, and 60 Asiatic squirrels 
especially needed for comparison with Dr. Abbott's collection. Four- 
teen moose skulls, 8 elk skulls, and 12 skulls of other deer were 
obtained at a nominal price from Mr. E. Thompson Seton. 

Birds. — A valuable series of East Indian birds, 281 in number, which 
are of special use for comparison with Dr. Abbott's collection, was 
obtained from the Royal Museum of Natural History, Leiden, in 
exchange. A series of 161 Brazilian birds was obtained by exchange 
with the Paulista Museum, Silo Paulo, Brazil. Mr. Anastasio Alfaro 
presented 12 birds from Cocos Island, a locality seldom visited. This 
sending includes several specimens of the rare sparrow Cocornls agassizi. 
Mr. R. D. Lusk presented a specimen of th(^. thick-billed parrot, Bhyn- 
chojpsitta paciiyrhyncha^ obtained in Arizona. This parrot had not 
been taken previously within the limits of the United States. Mr. 
H. W. Ilenshaw presented 14 rare Hawaiian ])irds, and Mr. A. Boucard 
added K! humming ])irds in continuation of his earlier donations in 
1895 and 1896. Mr. J. H. Riley ga,ve the Museum a collection of 286 
birds of Maryland and Virginia for use in exchanges. 

The Museum purchased a select collection of 105 much-needed Mexi- 
can birds. 

Btrds' eggs. — The great collection of birds' eggs received several 
important accessions during the year, besides those presented by Dr. 
Abbott and already mentioned (p. 62). Dr. Ralph added to his numer- 
ous donations of previous years a collection containing several sets of 
eggs of the rare Everglade Kite, RostrJiaums sociabills. A series of 
eggs from Texas, including those of Yireo atricapillus., was given by 
Mr. H. P. Attwater. A collection presented by Mr. J. P. Bab1)itt 
contained eggs of Larus sc/ustasagus, a species of whic^h the Museum 
lacked specimens. 

The Biological Surve}'^ of the Department of Agriculture transmitted 
a number of sets of eggs from different parts of the United States, 
including two sets of eggs of the Tennessee warbler, of which the 
Museum had no representative previously. A small collection of 
rare eggs from Arizona was purchased. 

Reptiles and hatrachians. — An excellent skeleton of the Giant Sala- 
mander of Japan was presented by Dr. C, Ishikawa. 



RErORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65 

Mr. Robert T. Matthews presented two very rare snakes from Nica- 
ragua, and Rev. Cyrus A. Clark an equally rare Japanese species, 
with some other specimens. The skeleton of a large leather-back 
turtle was donated by Mr. W. E. West. This was a very welcome 
accession, as the skeleton in the exhibition series of the Museum was 
not perfect. The Museum made a number of purchases of reptiles 
during the year, of which the most important were 50 specimens from 
Sumatra and vicinity for comparison with Dr. Abbott's collections, and 
137 especially well-preserved specimens from Costa Rica to strengthen 
the Museum collections from that countrj^ which, though extensive, 
are not in the best condition. The material obtained from the Philip 
pine Islands and from Porto Rico has already l)een referred to (see 
P-62). 

FisJi.es. — Besides the collections obtained from the U. S. Fish Com- 
mission, Stanford University, and Professor Dean, already mentioned, 
the Museum secured through the good offices of Messrs. Anderson and 
Price, of Ormond, Florida, the skin of a whale shark, Rhinodon, about 
13 feet long, the first ever taken in the North Atlantic. 

Jlollusks. — The principal donations in this class were 2,000 shells 
from Lower California, presented b}^ Lieut. C. A. Clark, U. S. Navy; 
35 specimens of new and rare species of land shells from various 
localities in the United States, presented by J. A. Ferris; a collection 
containing specimens of 12 species of land shells from Cocos Island, 
representing cotypes of species described in Van Marten's work on 
the shells of the island. These were obtained by Mr. William H. Dall. 

Insects. — The lunuljer of insects added to the collection during the 
year, including deposits, exceeded 100,000 specimens, or nearly three 
times as many as were received during the previous year. Included 
among the accessions were four large collections, the principal of which 
was that made by Mr. E. A. Schwarz, Custodian of Coleoptera, assisted 
by Mr. H. S. Earlier. This collection, which Mr. Schwarz made at 
his personal expense and presented to the Museum, contained 65,000 
insects. Mr. ^V. H. Ashmead collected about 7,000 insects in the 
Hawaiian Islands. Dr. H. G. Dyar, Custodian of Lepidoptera, assisted 
by Mr. A. N. Caudell, of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, col- 
lected 10.000 Lepidoptera and Orthoptera in Colorado. This collec- 
tion comprised a large numlier of l)lown lepidopterous larva' prepared 
in the field by Mr. Caudell. The fourth large accession was a deposit 
made by Mr. William Schaus, consisting of about 10,000 beautifully 
prepared specimens of butterflies, chiefly from Mexico and Central 
America. 

Besides these four large accessions there were 306 smaller ones, all 
of which are referred to in Appendix II. Only a few can be men- 
tioned in this place. Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell presented various

coUcction.s of insects from New Mexico, containing- numv typos and 
cotj'pcs. Mr. D. W. Coquillett, Custodian of Diptera, presented a 
valuable collection comprising 2,214 specimens of American Diptera. 
Two accessions of insects of the Philippine^ Islands were received 
from Dr. Paul L. Stangl, and one from Maj. M. I^. liobb. Mr. W. P. 
Hay presented 500 Mexican Lepidoptera. A collection of Homoptera 
wasprefsentedby Prof. Elmer D. Ball, including- types of man}' species 
described by him. T3'pes and cotj'pes of new species were also pre- 
sented by Prof. E. B. Williamson, Prof. H. Bird, Prof. Ralph V. 
Chamberlin, and j\Ir. H. H. Ncwcomb. The deposit of these types is 
a matter of great satisfaction to the Museum, and much to the interest 
of entomologists. 

At the close of the year arrangements were entered into for the ])ur- 
chase of 4.000 finely prepared Costa Riean insects, in which the Musiuim 
collections are deficient. This was the only purchase during the year. 
Several excellent collections werc^- procured ))y exchange, the princi- 
pal of ^vhich were 744 European Diptera from Prof. M. Bezzi, and a 
series of exotic Termitida, including many types, obtained from Dr. 
Felippo Silvestri. 

Marine lnvertehr(ite)<. — Besides the collections from the U. S. Fish 
Commission and Stanford University, already referred to (p. 6:-)), men- 
tion should he made of the crustaceans from caves in Kentuck}' and 
Tenness(M', including types of two ])lind species, which were presented 
b}' Mr. W. P. Hay; crustaceans from Alaska, presented b}' Mr. R, C. 
McCiregor, of the U. S. Coast Sui'vey steamer PatJiJindcr; samples of 
vVtlantic Ocean bottom, from the Bureau of Equipment, II. S. Nav}', 
and a collection of miscellaneous marine invertebrates from Ellesmere 
Land, presented by Mr. Robert Stein. 

One large purchase was made dui'ing the year, consisting of tXJ 
boxes of corals colhu-ted l)y l^rof. A. B. Steere and Prof. Dean C. 
Worcester in the Philippine Islands. This collection contained a 
great variety of valuable study matei'ial. 

Plants. — The accession lots added to the herl)ariuni for the year 
were 342 in niunber. In 189!t-f000 Dr. Charhvs Mohr, of Ashe^■ille, 
North Carolina, })resented to the Smithsonian Institution his collection 
of cryptogamic plants, compi'ising about 8,000 specimens, and at the 
same time IxMiueathed to the Institution his extensive herbarium of 
flowering plants. Dr. Mohr di(>d Jul}' IT, 1901, and on August 28, 
1001, the flowering plants, comprising about 18,500 specimens, were 
received from his (executors. This valuable l)equest is of nuicli impor- 
tance to the National Herl)arium, as it consists chiefly of plants of the 
Southern States, which were not widl represented previously. Dr. 
J. N. Rose, Assistant ('urator, collected about 8.000 plants in Mex- 
ico, chiefly on Mount Orizaba and Mount Popocatepi^tl. Dr. E. A. 
Mearns, U. S. Army, presented 748 plants from Rhode Island. A 



KEruKT OF ASSISTANT SE(UiKTAKY. 67 

collection of oSl phiiits, chiefly fi'oni the Philippine Islands, was 
received as a donation from the Royal Botanic (lardens, Iv(nv. Knoland. 

A large amount of valua])le material, comprising more than (>,OitO 
speciniiMis, was transmitted Ijy tln^ V. S. Department of Agriculture 
during the 3'ear. The more important collections are as follows: From 
Porto Uico, collected })y Messrs. (-ook. Underwood, and (Iriggs (1,100 
specinuMis); from (Juatemala and lM(^\ico, coUecti'd by Messrs. (yook 
and ( iriggs (1,0(>(» specimens); from Prazil, collected by ,Iose de ('ampos 
Novaes (511 specimens); from Idaiioaiid W^'oming, collected l)y E. 1). 
Meriill and (*. V. Wilcox (S()4 specimens); from vVlaska, Oregon, 
Washington, and California, collected by F. A. Wal])ole (Til speci- 
mens). The r. S. (Geological Sur\'(\v transmitted a collection of 4<S5 
specimens, collected in Arizona by Mr. John 1). Leiberg, and the 
U. 8. Fish Conmiission a colUn'tion of ;5L4 specimens, collected by 
Professors E^'ermal^l and Clark in Indiana. 

Several important exchange's wer(^ efiected during tiie year. Men- 
tion may be made here of the following: 747 ]V)rto Rican plants and 
444 Mexican plants from the New York P>otanic (xarden; ^)o4 C'oloiado 
plants from Mr. Frank Tweedy. 

During the year the Museum made ])ui'chascs of plants to the amount 
of ^1,000 and about LO.loO spiM-imens were obtained. The largest 
collections were 4, ;24!» specimens from China atid 1, (Mil) specimens from 
Mexico. The remaining purchas(\s consisted chiefly of plants from 
various parts of (he United States, as follows: Coloi'ado, l,.S,s;^>; Ftah, 
455; California, 45(1; Gulf States, 445; (reorgia. 55S; Floi'ida, 52H. 

WORK ON THK STUDY SKKIKS. 

In the l)i\ision of Mannnals aconsiderablr amount of time wass])(>nt 
in making uniform, complete labels to replace earlier ones, many of 
which had deteriorated from long use or th(^ infiltration of oily matter 
from the skins. The rearrangement of the small mannnals was prac- 
tically completed last year as far as space would i)ei"mit. On account 
of the cramped ([uarters it has been necessary to store many ti'ays of 
less frequently us(>d material in boxes, a very undesirable i)lan. 
During the year covered b}^ this report fi\e new cases win-e made for 
the large manmials, and they are now all reasonably well protected 
from (lust and insects, but are still nuudi overcrowded, so that they 
are to a certain extent inaccessible and can not be properly arranged. 
The large skins in vats ai'o still uncUnined and in danger of destruction, 
no money having been available for their renovation. Of the small 
skins, between 300 and 400 were freed from grease^ and made over 
into"a suitable form foi- permanent preserxation. Among these were 
included many typ«' specimens. The rooms for mannnals in alcohol 
were improved by the addition of several hundretl feet of shelving, 



68 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

but as this was not put in place until near the close of the 3 ear little 
was done toward rearrangement. The specimens themselves are in 
g-ood condition. During the year 1,06J- mammal skulls, mostly of 
large size, were cleaned by the Museum preparators, of which 590 
belonged to the collection of the Biological Survey, U. S. Department 
of Agriculture, and 474 to the regular collections. In addition, 2,167 
small skulls were cleaned by contract. This work is of special impor- 
tance, as in the study of manmials cranial characters are largely 
depended upon for the discrimination of species. The additions to 
the collections of the Biological Survey were catalogued in the Museum 
as hitherto, and 13 new storsige cases were constructed for their 
reception. At the request of Di-. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Colum- 
bian Museum, the skulls of a considerable lumiber of types and rare 
species were photographed for his work on the mannnals of Mexico 
and Central America. 

In the Division of Birds the conditions existing last year continued 
with little change. The curator being occupied the greater part of 
the time in preparing manuscript for the press, the routine work fell 
almost altogether on the assistant curator, who was without assistance 
except for a fcAV weeks. During this period some i)rogress was made 
toward completing the rearrangement of the birds in the new cases 
provided last year. The assistant curator took charge of the rei)acking 
of exhibits at the Buffalo Exposition and installing them at the 
Charleston Exposition. 

In the Division of Reptiles a beginning was made in rearranging 
the study collections on the new shelving provided last year, l)ut as 
this work involves a large amount of re-identiiication of species it 
necessarih^ })roceeds slowly. The collections are in a good state of 
preservation. 

Little more can be accomplished in the Division of Fishes by the 
present small force than to keep the collections from deteriorating, and 
to enter and care for new accessions and to attend to the scientific 
correspondence. Toward the close of the year, however, the work of 
preparing 100 sets of duplicate specimens for distribution to educa- 
tional institutions was begun, and good progress made. The assistant 
curator went to Charleston in January to install the collection of 
fishes in formalin which was transferred from the Buffalo Exposition. 

A large number of standard drawers was added to the equipment of 
the Division of Insects, and the re-arrangement of the collections 
thereby much facilitated. The Lepidoptera have now all been well 
arranged by Dr. Dyar in the standard drawers. Mr. Schwarz has 
been engaged in similar work on the Coleoptcra and completed 50 
drawers during the year. The Ichneumonidea and C-halcidoidea Svere 
arranged by Mr. Ashmead. Mr. Currie has worked continuously on 
the Neuroptera and by his efforts the collection of Odonata has been 



REPOKT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. (i9 

groatly increased and improved. AN'ork on the Diptera was continued 
hy Mr. Coquillett, and at present the colhu-tion of insiH'ts ol" thai order 
is probably at least as good as any otlici' similar collection in the 
country. The Diptera are still in old style boxes. In all other orders. 
"except the Rhynchota. the collections are in good condition, thouo-h 
less work has been done on them. The Rhynchota is a large order 
of great e<-onomic importance and should have th(^ care of a projierlv 
qua'Htied specialist. 

The accessions to the Division of Marine Invertebrates wen^ for the 
most part cared for as soon as received, l)ut the large collection of 
Philippine corals purchased from Professor Steere was not all unpacked 
for want of room. With the ]iresent force the specimens can not l)e 
catalogued as fast as identitied, but a large amount was accomplished 
during the year. 

It has been fully recogiHzed that the collections of the Di\ ision of 
Plants, also known as the National H<n"barium, are not housed as sat- 
isfactorily as could be desired, while the offices and laboi'atories are 
cramped almost beyond suft'erance, and it has been necessary to resort 
to many ingenious devices to accommodate the working force. 

When the Herbarium was transferred from the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture to the National Museum, the old cases in which it had l)ecn 
kept were also brought over and when set up were riMuodeled and 
improved as far as possible. It was obvious, however, that they could 
not be made tight enough to a]>soIutely exclude dust and insects with- 
out a greater expenditure of money than would b(^ justified. Al)out 
three years ago a new form of case was devised, and at the l)egimiing 
of the present liscal year 104 of these new cases were in use. During 
the past year -to additional cases were constructed, making Itf-t in all. 
It is estimated that a])out 200 additional cases will still l)e re([uired to 
replace the old ones. Congress was asked to supply funds for these 
much-needed cases, and it is hoped that the amount appropriated for 
mechanical work will enalde the jNIuseum to construct the greater part 
of them, if not all, during the coming year. 

Mr. F. V. Coville, Honorary Curator, repoj-ts as follows r(\uarding 
the cataloguing of specimens: 

At tlie time the herl)arium was actually traiisferreil to the National Muf^euui, in 
1894, we l)egan to stamp and record the accessions. It was assumed tluit there were 
then about 200,000 sheets in the Irerbarium, and the stamp was set at 200,001. 

The number of specimens catalogued during tiie ])ast eight years is 202,945. Of 
tliese 15,975 were added last year. 

The work of I'ecording the old part of the her1)arium has almost ceased and speci- 
mens are only stamped when they are to be sent away as a loan. Tliis record runs 
from 1 to 26346. In addition to this, specimens have been stanii)e<l with numbers 
from 125000 to 156409. 

The Division of Plants has been rather more favorably situated as 
regards funds than any other division of the Museum. Since its trans- 



70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 31K)2. 

fer from the U. S. Department of Ag-riculture in 1894 it has expended 
each year, as ao-reed upon, th(^, sum of $10,000, a larger amount than 
allotted to any other division. I n the present quarters, however, it can 
not hope for the facilities which a less crowded building would afford. 
On the other hand, it is to be stated that the division has not main- 
tained an extensive exhibition series, as has been the case with ivearly 
all other divisions of the Museum. 

Plans of the new cases adopted for the Division of Plants were sent 
b\' request to Mr. F. D. Gardner of the Porto Rico Agricultural

CATALOGUE HOOKS. 

Tlie supply of catalogU(^ books for the several divisions having been 
exliaustcd, the opportiuiity was taken to revise the headings, which had 
been in use with but little modilication for about tifty years. After 
Pull consideration it was found impracticable to make the catalogues 
conform to thos(^ of the other two departments of the Museum, l)ut by 
introducing two columns without headings a form was devised which 
can ))e used ])y all tho divisions of the Department of Biology, except 
the Division of Plants. The size of the l>ooks was not changed. 

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES AND I'UKLI CATIONS. 

As already said in another place, nuich of the work done during the 
year covered l)y this report was continuation of work begim last year 
or earlier. The first volume of the large manual ly ]Mr. K. Ridgway, 
entitled Birds of North and Middle America, which was mentioned 
last year, was published on October 21, 1001. The second volume is 
nearly I'eady to issue, and the third volume is well und«H"way and will 
piobably go to press sometime during the coming year. Mr. Ridgwaj^ 
has had little time for othcM" duties than reading pi'oof and completing 
manuscript on this work. 

Dr. C W. Richmond pri^pared a report on the large collection of 
birds from the Andaman and Nico])ar islands i)resented 1)y Dr. W. L. 
Abl)ott, and identitied the collections from Linga Island, Sumatra. 

Much of the time of Dr. Stejneger was occupied in re-identifying 
the general. collections of n^ptiles and batrachians prepai"atory to their 
re-arrangement in tiie new cases already mentioned. Although this 
work affords nothing for j)ublication, it amounts to a revision of man}' 
genera. The investigations of the reptile faunas of the Antilles and 
of Japan, mentioned in last year's report, were continued. The mono- 
graph on the reptiles and batrachians of Porto Rico was not completed 
as expected, owing to the receipt of new material from Mona Island 
which re(juired description and illustration. In the course of his

Mv. G. S. Miller, jr., iiuhlished li\e jjapcrs bused on the niannnal 
collections durino' the year, the principal on(\s containino- desciiptions 
of Dr. Al)l)ott\s collections from the Nicobar and Andaman islands 
and Indrag'iri River, Sumatra. In both numerous new sp('ci(\s were 
descril)ed. Mr. ^lillei' also pul)lished several nouienclatural and classi- 
ticatory notes, and jointly with Mr. James A. (t. Ivehn. of Philadelpha, 
a very carefully prepannl list of mammals of North America, entitled 
Systematic results of the study of North American land mannnals to 
the close of the year 1900. Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr., published two 
papers on l)ats and one on the Venezuelan mannnals collected by Capt. 
Wirt lvo))inson and himself. He has been engao-od in th(^ study of the 
skeletons of Amc'rican hares and pikas. 

The Museum pul)lished during- the y(»ar a series of pajxu's by Pr(>si- 
dent D. S. Jordan, and Messrs. J. 0. Snyder, E. C Starks, and M. 
Sindo, on the fishes of Japan. Thes(^ papers covered H! groups, such 
as the eels, cardinal fishes, surf fishes, anglers. <'tc. The types of now 
species were deposited in the National Museum. President flordan 
also published conjointly with Mr. .T. O. Snyder a list of the fishes 
collected for the Museum by the late Pierre L. Jouy in Ja})aii in 1888 
and 188."). Dr. TarhHon H. Bean and Mr. B. A. Bean completed 
reports on the fishes of New York for the State Museum and of Great 
South Bay, New York, for the New York Fish Connnission. Notes 
on the whale-shark received by the Museum from Ormond, Florida, 
on a steelhead salmon, and on a larval conger eel were also published 
by Mr. B. A. Bean. .V report on the fishes of the Nile River pre- 
sented by Prof. Bashford Dean was prepared by Dr. Theodore Gill 
and Mr. Bean. 

The conchological work accomplished during the year is sununed 
up by Mr. AY. II. Dall. Honorary Curator, as follows: 

The curator lias continued his work of revising and sunnnarizing the groups of 
American bivalves. The revision of the fossil S2:)eeies (Tertiary), those of the general 
collection (recent), and of the American recent species all proceed together, so that 
for the most part concluding the work on a group means that the si)ecimens in the 
collection belonging to that group liave been brought np to date. The work which 
has chiefly occupied the curator during the past year has been (1) the ])reparation 
of a report now finished, Imt not yet printed, on the newly discovered l^'ocene of 
Alaska, and (2) the revision of the family Veneridse, one of the largest and most 
interesting of all the groups of Invalves, including 137 Auierican species not includ- 
ing those of sonthern South America. TheAvork on the recent species, including the 
description of 22 new ones discovered during the research, is completed, ])ut the fos- 
sil forms will require further study as comjirising many undescribed species. 

Mr. Bartsch, under the supervision of the curator, has continued his researches in 
the Pyramidellidte of the Pacific coast, a wholly unexpected influx of undescribed 
forms having come to light l)y search in the sand and gravel reserved for the scrutiny 
of the student of Foraminifera. The nomenclature being in a l)ail statt', a large

amount of research has been necessary, and this has occupied Ihe time not taken up 
hy the nmltifarious duties in the division wliich tlie absi-nce of an efficient clerk 
makes it necessary to call upon Mr. Bartscli to perform. 

Ml". Simpson has been continuing his work on the Naiades of tluMvorld, which 
has made reasonal)le progress, hut has called for little in the way of i)ul)licati<in dur- 
ing the year. 

A very large numl)er of identifications and lists of species for correspondents was 
made during the year, as usual, but this work, though taking much time and more 
or less directly beneficial to the Museum, calls for no extended remarks. 

Prof. Charh'S B. Wilson, who hfis \olunteered to work up the collec- 
tion.s of parasitic copepod Crustacea belonging- to the Museuui, com- 
pleted a monograph of the family Argulidtv. The monograph of the 
Crustacea of the familj^ Galatheidte b}' Dr. J. E. Benedict, mentioned 
in last year's report, was completed, but has not 3'et l)een pul)lished. 
Miss M. J. Rath bun completed a stud.y of the macruran Crusta<H>a of the 
northwest coast of America, and prepared preliminary descriptions of 
both Macrura and Brachyura, which were published in the Proceedings 
of the Museum. She also prejiared a list of decapods of the Northwest, 
with descriptions of new and rare forms, for insertion in one of the 
volumes of the report of the Harriman Alaska expedition, now in 
press. The collection of stalk-eyed Crustacea made by Dr. D. 8. Jordan 
and Mr. J. O. Sn} der in Japan was also reported on by Miss Rathbun. 
In addition she described a new species of fossil crab for Branner\s 
Geology of the Northeast Coast of Brazil, identified the Brachyura and 
Macrura collected by the U. S. Fish Commission in the Hawaiian 
Islands, 1901, and renew^ed work on the fresh-water crabs belonging- 
to the collections of the Paris Miiseimi, pul>lishing in that connection 
a description of a new species of Parathelphusa. Prof. W. P. Ha}^ 
described two blind crustaceans from Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, and 
Nickajack Cave, Tennessee. Miss Harriet Richardson, collal)orator, 
continued studies on the isopods. She prepared, at the request of 
Prof. A. E. Verrill, a report on the isopods of the Bermudas, and 
began reports on the Japanese isopods. She also took up the study 
of the general collection of Bop3a'id{e, and prepared descriptions of 
two new isopods from Indiana and Cuba, respectively. 

Dr. L. O. Howard, Honorary Curator of the Division of Insects, 
who is also Entomologist of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, 
pu])lished during the year a large niunber of papers having for the 
most part an economic bearing. A list of these will be found in the 
bibliography accompanying this report. In addition Dr. Howard 
published a large popular work entitled The Insect Book, treating of 
North American insects exclusive of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. 
The scientific work of other members of the staff of the Division of 
Insects for the year is thus summarized: 

Mr. Ashmead still continues his classificatory work on the Hymenoj)tera an.l has 
published much on the subject. He has just iinished his classification of the 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 78 

chalcid-flies of the ^uiierfaiiiily Chalcidoidea, a complex fully as largo as the Icli- 
iieuiiKiiKiidea. The material in this suiieffamily in the national collection is most 
valuable and has heen arranged by Mr. Ashmead ac(X)rding to his classification. ! U- 
also continues his work on a monograph of the North American Bracoiiid.c iK'gun 
ten years ago, and has every reason to believe that his manuscript will ))e ready for 
publication in the Proceedings of the Museum this fall, lli" has also linished and 
lianded in for pul)licatiou in the Proceedings of the Washington Academy of Sciences 
his reports on (1) the Rynchota of the Harriman exi)edition, and (2) the Hymenoj)- 
tera r)f the Galapagos Islands, collected by the Leland Stanford Junior University 
expedition. Mr. Ashmead has also done much work upon a catalogue of the 
Hymenoptera of North America and the West Indies. A' complete bibliograi)hical 
catalogue of our species has never been published, and it is believed that such a 
work will be found useful and valuable. Difhculty has been found in ])lacing some 
of the species described from Mexico and Central America, and before these can be 
assigned to their proper genera it will be necessary to examine the -types in the 
British Museum. 

jNIr. Coquillett has com))leted a synoi)sis of the dipterous family ('luronomid;c. 

Dr. Dyar has completed and handed in for publication in tii-e Proceedings a cata- 
logue of the North American Lepidoptera north of INlexico. 

Mr. Currie has been engaged when other work would i>erniit in monographing 
the North American species of the antlion flies, family Myrmeleonida'. He has 
begun the compilation of a catalogue of the neuropteroid insects of North America. 

Mr. F. A. Lucas completed a paper on latiloid lishes. 

The scientific work of the ])otanists has covered a wide field. Mr. 
F. V. Coville, Honorary Curator of the Division of Plants, continued 
his studies upon the genera Sali.r and Rthes^ and is also preparing a 
flora of Alaska. He published during the 3'ear a paper on a new genus 
of heather, IlarrlmaiuJla^ of which specimens were obtained by the 
Haniman Alaska expedition, and a paper on two species of Rihei<. 
Dr. J. N. Rose continued work on the Mexican flora, and engaged 
with Dr. N. L. Britton in preparing a revision of the Crassulacew of 
North America. Mr. C. L. Pollard published papers describing new 
species of violets and of (Jlianisecrhta^ also a popular account of plant 
families and on the formation of the Florida Keys. Mr. W. R. Maxon 
pu))lished A'arious notes on ferns. 

COOPERATION OF STECIALISTS AND LOAN OF SPECIMENS. 

The Museum has always enjoyed the cooperation of s})e('ialists in 
difl^erent branches of sj'stematic zoology and ])otany in classifying 
the collections and identifying species in groups with which the mem- 
bers of the scientiflc stafl' are not familiar. These transactions are of 
a varied nature. Sometimes the use of all the Museum specimens of 
a group are solicited l)y a specialist engaged in pre])aring a monograph, 
to enalde him to ])ase his conclusions on greater masses of material 
than he personally has at his disposition. In cases of this kind the 
Museum benefits chiefly by having the specimens in its collection identi- 
fied. In other instances the Museum asks the assistance of an expert 
in working up a collection, both to get the specimens identified and to 



74 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

obtain ii paper for publication in the Proceedings, or Bulletin. Tn still 
other instances both the above-mentioned o})jects arc aimed at, the 
expert getting the use of material for use with other collections in a 
work of general scope, and the Museum r(>ceiving a report on its own 
specimens. 

The system has worked to tho advantage of the Museum and also, it 
is believed, has facilitated in no small degree the work of zoological 
and botanical specialists, both in the United States and abroad. Manj^ 
collections were in the hands of specialists at the beginning of the 
year covered ))y this report and others were sent out during the year. 
The most important were as follows: A series of 208 Patagonian mam- 
mals sent to Dr. J. A. Allen, American Museum of Natural History, 
for use in connection with his work on the Manunals of the Princeton 
expedition to Patagonia; 68 Alaska squirrels, also sent to Dr. Allen; 
49 mammals sent to Dr. i). G. Elliot, Field Columbian ^luscum. for 
use in connection with his work on the mammals of Mexico and Cen- 
tral America; (>8 martens sent to Mr. S. N. Rhoads, Academy of Nat- 
ural Sciences, Philadelphia, for use in a study of th(> genus J/jf.'<fr/a/ 
315 Hshes from Negros Island, Philippines, to Dr. D. S. flordan, to 
be identiiied for the ])enetit of the Museum; the general collection of 
Salpa^ and simi)le ascidians to Dr. William E. Ritter, University of 
California, to be identitied for t\m benefit of the Museum; the general 
collection of Pj^cnogonida (which had previously been in the hands of 
Dr. Meinert, of Copenhagen) and other specimens, to Prof. Leon J. 
Cole, University of Michigan, to be worked up for the benetit of the 
Museum; 14 lots of Porto Rican echinoderms to Prof. H. L. Clark, 
Olivet College, to be identified at the request of the U. S. Fish Com- 
mission; ()4 lots of Alpheidie to Dr. PI. Coutiere, Paris Museum, added 
to the collections of the same kind previously sent him, to ])e classified 
for the benefit of the Museum; 11 lots of leeches to Dr. J. Percy 
Moore, University of Pennsylvania, added to similar lots previously 
sent him and identitied for th(> Museum. The following insects, with 
many smaller lots, were lent for study: One hundred specimens of the 
genus Lri/raniri to Prof. J. B. Smith, Rutgei's Colleg(^: liS specimens 
of Ophionini to Dr. E. P. Felt; 138 Lepidoptera to Dr. W. J. Holland, 
Carnegie Museum; al)out 400 specimens, illustrating the natural his- 
tory of the dragon-fli(^s and their alliens, to Prof. James G. Needham, 
Lake Forest Cniversity, for monographic w'ork; 832 Tettigidie to Dr. 
J. L. Hancock. 

Loans of plants were 30 in number, among which the following 
deserve notice: 214 specimens of Amorj?ha and PhUadelphu>< to the 
Biltmore Her])arium; 197 specimens of Equtsetum to Mr. A. A. Eaton; 
589 specimens of Curdinu'mc to Dr. A. Engler, Royal Botanical 
Museum, Berlin; lOO Hepatica? to Dr. A. W: Evans, Yale University; 
474 specimens of Nyctaginaceso to Dr. A. Heimerl, Vienna; 223 mis-

The shells of the family Achatiuellidie which were in the possession 
of the late Prof. Alpheus Hyatt at the time of his death werc^ trans- 
ferred to Prof. A. Ct. Mayer, of lirooklyn, who is (Mioiio'ed in com-

STUDENTS. 

In addition to the use made of the collections hy the s])ecialists to 
whom specimens wer(^ sent, various iiiAi^stioators and students work 
in the laboratories every 3'(>ar for longer or shoi'ter ))ei'iods. A yreat 
deal of such work is don(> f»y the scientitic statf of the various bureaus 
of the li. S. Department of Aii'riculture which are coiuMU-ned in 
zooloL^ical and botanical i-(\searches and by the oflicers of I Ik- W S. 
Fish Commission. Dr. E. A. M<nirns, V. S. Army, s})ent the summer 
and early autumn of P.Mil in work on the natural history of the Mex- 
ican boundary. Dr. D. (J. P^lliot, Field t'olund»ian Museuiu, spent a 
few \v(H>ks in rlanuary and Februai'v, liMliJ, in examinino- Mexican and 
Central American mammals. Mr. Outram Bangs, Museum of Com- 
parative Zoology, spent some time in studj^ing South American and 
Japanese birds. Mr. Frank M. Chapnran, American Museum of Nat- 
ural History, examininl the collections of South American, and espe- 
cially Peruvian, birds. Mrs. Florence M. Bailey made some in\'esti- 
gations on the l)ird collections preparatory to the publication of a 
work on the l)irds of Avestern North Anun-ica. 

Prof. W. P. Hay continued the work on i\n\ crayfishes mentioned 
last year, and rendered valuable assistance to the Museum by idcMiti- 
fying recent additions to the collections. Mr. T. Waylaiid Vaughan 
continued work on the geiuu'al collections of corals, as o])i)ort unities 
occur I'ed. 

Numerous specialists and students examined various poiTions of the 
collections of insects. 

Dr. N. L. l^ritton, director of the New York Botanical Garden, was 
a frequent visitor to the Herbariuin during the year, especially in 
connection with his studies on the Crassulacea' and Cyperacea». The 
collection repi-esenting the genus Plantaijo was studied by Mr. P]. L. 
Morris, director of biology in the high schools of Washuigton City. 
Dr. P. A. Rydberg examined the Rocky Mountain plants, Dr. Charles 
F. Millspaugh the plants of Yucatan, Dr. L. M. Underwood the fern 
collection, and Mrs. E. G. Britton the mosses. Prof. PI L. Greene, 
of the Catholic University of America, was a frequent visitor to the 
Herbarium, and Mr. J. B. Lei)>erg devotcnl much time during the

winter in identifying* a western collection of his own and one obtai^ied 
by Prof. I J. F. Ward in Arizona. 

Several students whose purpose was to familiarize thems(4^'(^s with 
different groups of animals have had desks assigned to them for longer 
or shorter periods. Such students are always welcome, but in the 
present cramped condition of the building they work under grout 
disadvantag'es both as regards space and light. 

DISTRIBUTION OF DUPIJCATR SPECIMENS. 

The distribution of so-called "duplicate" specimens to educational 
institutions continued as far as circumstances would permit. The 
preparation of these sets consumes much time, and witli the limited 
force only a moderate number can be got together in any one year. 
The sets of marine invertebrates mentioned in last year's report were 
distributed to 71 institutions, chi(>fly colleges, normal schools, and high 
schools. In May work was ])egun on the preparation of a n(>w series 
of 100 sets of fishes. 

EXPOSITIONS. 

The Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo, New York, closed November 
2, 1902, and certain members of the staff were detailed to repack the 
exhibits of the Department. This work was under the supervision of 
Dr. Charles W. Richmond. The President having signified his d(\sire 
that such portion of the Government exhibit at Buffalo as could be 
accommodated should be transferred to the Charleston Exposition, a 
selection of objects was made, packed separately, and shipped direct to 
that city. The remainder of thc^ Buffalo exhibit was returned to Wash- 
ington and installed in the permanent exhibition cases. The Charles- 
ton Exposition closed May 31, 1902, and just prior to that date several 
members of the scientific staff were detailed to repack the objects 
exhi))ited there. 

PERSONNEL. 

The Head Curator was appointed representative of the Smithsonian 
Institution and National Museum on the U. S. (Tovernment Board for 
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, 1904. 

Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr., returned to the service of the Department, 
September 1,1901. 

Mr. Georg(> B. Turner was appointed chief taxidermist, Septem))er 
21, 1901. 

Miss A. K. Knapp was apj)ointed on April 1, 1902, to a clerical 
position in the Division of Plants. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY 
FOR THE YEAR 1901-2. 

By George 1*. Mekriij-, 
Head ('uraior. 

The year that has passed, though characterized by no sin<;l(> excnt 
of great importance, has, nevertheless, l)een one of steady [)rogr(>ss 
along lines essential to good administration. More has prol)a})ly Ixmmi 
accomplished in the way of sj'stematizing and completing the recoi'ds 
of the collections than in an}"- single year in the history of the Depart- 
ment. Changes of importance in the personnel have occurred, iiiv()i\'- 
ing the resignation of Dr. Peter Fireman, on the !»tli of September; 
the furloughing of Mr. John W. Coleman, preparator in tlu^ Section 
of Vertebrate Paleontology; the appointment of ]\Ir. R. S. lUissler, 
preparator in the Section of Invertebrate Paleontology, and the 
appointment of ]\lr. W. C. Phalen as aid in the Division of Ceology. 
The resignations and furloughs, it should be stated, were voluntary, 
Dr. Fireman retiring to accept a more lucrative position elsinvhere, 
and Mr. Coleman accepting temporary emplo^aiient in ]\Iexico on 
account of the condition of his health. Temporary services have 
been rendered by ]\Iiss Moody and Miss Youte. 

ACCESSIONS. 

The total nund)er of acc(>ssions received by the \arious divisions of 
the Department is shown in tal)ular form below. 

For purposes of comparison those for the years lSi>!>-li»Oi» and 
1900-1901 are also oiven.

From this it might appear that there has been a stinidy falling off in 
the amount of material received. The discrepancy is, howe\'er. largely 
apparent. With the gradual increase in the size and degrcM' of com- 
pleteness of the collections we are enabled to exercise more and more 

77 



78 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

discrimination as the years go on, and material that would at one time 
have been acceptable is now rejected. No idea of the value of the 
accessions, moreover, can be derived from these figures, and it is safe 
to say that in at least two of the divisions the materials are of a 
\'alue equal to that of any corresponding period in the history of the 
jNlu.seum. 

It is well to note in this connection that as time passes a propor- 
tionally smaller amount of desirable material comes to the Department 
in the way of gifts, while the funds that can l)e devoted to i)urchase 
and collecting remain far too small. As a natural consequence the 
growth of the collection is likely in time to be seriousl}^ checked. 

The most important of the accessions noted above have been: 

I. A collection of 173 specimens of ores and 6 transparencies of 
mining regions received from the Government exhibit at Paris in VMM). 

'2. A fine example of native tellurium from Delamar, Nevada, gift 
of B. F. Swindler.

24. About 100 specimens of Upper Carboniferous fossil plants from 
the vicinity of Clinton, Henry County, Missouri, the gift of Dr. J. H. 
Britts, of Clinton, Missouri, The collection includes a number' of 
types described by Dr. David White in the Fossil Flora of the Coal 
Measures of Missouri. 

SOURCES OF NEW MATERIAL. 

The sources of the new material are in part indicated above. As 
in years past the U, S, Geological Survey has been the principal con- 
tributor, though several valuable specimens have been obtained by 
purchase and exchange, jus noted, 

Mr. F. W. Crosby collected for the Museum a remarkabl}^ fine series 
of pot holes in l)asalt, found in the vicinity of Snake River Falls, Idaho. 

The meteorite collection and the collection of minerals have been 
enriched mainl}^ through exchanges and purchase. As noted, Dr. L. 
T. Chamberlain has made an important addition to the gem collection. 

Mr. Schuchert, during his vacation, made important additions to 
the collections in the way of Helderbergian and Cretaceous materials 
from New York and New Jerse}'. Mr. Bassler, while at the Pan- 
American Exposition, devoted a few days to collecting- Bryozoa in the 
Devonian and Silurian rocks of the vit-inity. 

ROUTINE, 

In all the divisions of the Department there were received upward 
of 4,100 specimens requiring entering and numbering, and in many 



KEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECKETAK\. 81 

cases the preparation of eards for card catalogues suid, perhaps, hilx'ls 
for exhibition purposes as well. In addition, considerable progress 
was made in working over the old materials. 

Much time, as before, is occupied in identifying material received 
from other institutions or from individuals, and for which the Museum 
receives no adec^uate return. Some 297 of these temporary accessions 
have received attention during the year. 

Mrs. Jouy, who has been placed in charge of the records of the 
Department, reports the following entries in the catalogue^, books: 
Division of Geology and Sections of Paleobotany and Vertebrate 
Paleontology, 1,750; Section of Invertebrate Paleontology, 2,102; 
Division of Mineralogy, 129. Three thousand one hundred and fifty- 
seven catalogue cards have been prepared, also manuscript for 558 
labels for the Government Printer. Some 30,000 numbers have been 
painted upon specimens by ]\Ir. Gruikshank and the Misses Voute 
and Moody. 

Several of the collections, including the concretions and cave and 
glacial deposits, in the Division of Geology, have been thoroughly 
overhauled and resirranged, and over 500 specimens re-installed in new 
exhi])ition jars. Some one hundred photographs, maps, and other 
illustrations have been distributed among the exhibition series. The 
details of this work, as in years past, have been looked after 1)}^ Mr. 
Newhall. The mineralogical hall was disarranged in January, owing 
to the erection of the new galleries, and is now in process of restora- 
tion. The work can scarcely be finished during the present fiscal 
year. 

Mr. Schuchert reports that altogether he has put awa}" in final 
museum form during the year some 21,000 specimens. Twenty-tive 
boxes of old material have been Avithdrawn from storage and the 
material worked into the Museum collections. The installation of 
the Harris collection has been completed. 

Mr. Lucas, who still remains in charge of tlie vertel)rate fossils, 
reports the mounting of the hind legs and pelvis of Ti'iceratops jjror- 
siis and similar parts of the carnivorous dinosaur Allosaurus. 

The time of Dr. Peale has been iuWy taken up in attending to the 
routine of his department, and no progress whatever has been made 
on the exhi])ition series. The study material, which has received his 
chief attention, is rapidl}- becoming systematized and put in tirst-class 
condition. 

A systematic eti'ort has been made toward preparing a catalogue of 
the type and illustrated specimens in all the sections and divisions of 
the Department. This has taken a considera])le amount of time on the 
part of the heads of the various divisions, the clerical work remaining 
largely in the hands of Mrs. Jouy and Miss Graves. The manuscript 
for nearly G,()00 type and illustrated specimens has thus been prepared. 

NAT MUS 1902 



82 REPOKT OF NATIOISTAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

It was hoped that this catalogue might be completed in season to hand 
in with m}^ annual report. 

In accordance with the plan originated several years ago, a small 
series of rocks, illustrating the various stages of rock decomposition 
and formation of soils, was prepared for distribution to schools and 
colleges. Ninety-one sets were prepared, (comprising eleven speci- 
mens each. These were accompanied by a descriptive pamphlet of 
three pages, giving localities and analyses. 

As the years go on, and particularly as the halls grow more and 
more crowded, there accumulates a large amount of duplicate and 
less desirable material, which has been stored away in boxes or 
wherever available space can be found. This is especiall}^ the case 
with the Division of Geology proper, where the character of the 
material is such that it often comes to the Museum in bulk to be 
trimmed up and prepared for exhibition on the ground. During the 
past year a systematic effort has been made to sort this and dispose, to 
the advantage of the Museum, of such as was not actuall}' needed for 
study or exhibition. Nearly 2,500 specimens and upward of 4,500 
pounds of rocks and ores in the rough have been thus disposed of. the 
returns coming in the form of meteorites and minerals in which a 
maximum value is represented 1)}' a minimum amount of material. 

The regular routine of the Museum has been somewhat disturbed 
this year, as in years past, by exposition work. Messrs. Xowhall, 
Stewart, and Bassler were at Buffalo for a period of eighteen da3^s in 
November, engaged in packing the exhibit of the department, which 
had been there throughout the exposition, and in January following 
Messrs. Schuchert and Stewart went to Charleston to install the 
exhibit there. In May, Messrs. Stewart and Newhall and the Head 
Curator visited Charleston for the purpose of packing the collections 
for their return to Washington, I may note here that the collections 
forming the exhibit at Buffalo and Charleston have been all returned, 
those from Charleston arriving too late to receive attention during the 
present fiscal year. Mr, Bassler Avas engaged during July, August, 
and a part of September, at Newport, Kentucky, in packing the 
Ulrich collection, noted elsewhere, 

PEESENT CONDITION OF THE COLLECTIONS. 

Tl)e condition of most of the collections of the Department is fairly 
satisfacctot-y. We are, of course, badly hampered for space, and a 
large amount of material is needed to render many of the collections 
complete or systematic. The final installation, in the Section of 
Invertebrate Paleontology, of the Harris collection, received in 1898, 
is practically' accomplished. The exhibition portion now comprises 
some 3,400 specimens mounted on 365 tiles and blocks and occupving 
50 running feet of the gallery rail case in the southeast court. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 83 

This collection, which has been briefly referred to in previous reports, 
i.s the result of nearly fifty years of work on the part of Mr. Harris, 
and is generally accepted as being the finest collection of its kind extant. 
It is particularly rich in Crinoids, of which, in the form of slabs and 
free specimens, there arc not less than 1,3(»0 specimens. It is also 
extremely rich in Silurian starfishes and Trilobites, containing some 
600 out of the 750 known species of this crustacean so far described 
from the Cincinnati formation. The Museum, as well as the country 
at large, is to be congratulated on the fact that so valuable a collection 
has become permanently housed where it will l)c accessible to all work- 
ers. Much credit is due Mr. Schuchert for the efficient manner in 
which he has handled this and, indeed, all the collections that come 
under his care. 

It may be well to remark in this connection that the skeleton of 
IlesperornU regalis^ obtained a year ago for the Pan-American Expo- 
sition, has been returned in safety and now constitutes one of the most 
interesting exhil)its in the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology. 

The collections in the mineral hall are not yet fully restored from 
the confused condition into which they were thrown in January by 
the erection of galleries, as already noted. 

KESEARCH A\l> PUBLICATION. 

Work of research in the Division of Geology has been greatly cur- 
tailed through the resignation in September of Dr. Peter Fireman, 
chemist of the Department, as before noted. What investigations 
have been carried on have been limited mainly to meteorites. As will 
be seen by reference to the bil)liograph3", two papers relating to the 
Felix and Admire meteorites have been prepared and published dur- 
ing the last year \)\ the Head Curator, the chemical work having l)een 
done in part by Dr. Fireman and in part by Mr. Tassin, the Assistant 
Curator in the Division of Mineralogy. This investigation has yicdded 
what is believed to be important contributions to our knowdedge of 
these interesting bodies, the Felix stone having been shown to ))e a 
tufi' containing minerals of undoubted secondary origin, and that of 
Admire showing the iron under such conditions as to suggest its origin 
through reduction of a chloride or sulphide. 

Mr. Tassin has himself studied and prepared for puldication a paper 
on the large mass of meteoric iron from Casas (Irandcs, Mexico, and 
has continued his studies on the dehj^dration of the ferric h3Tlrates. 
He hopes to be a])le to publish the result of this latter work during 
the next calendar 3^ ear. 

Mr. Schuchert has continued his study of the Silurian and Lower 
Devonian of the Appalachian region, and has in preparation mono- 
graphs of these fossils from the Maryland region, to l)e puldished in 
the main by the Maryland Geological Survey. He has also continued 



84 KP:P<>RT of national MU8EUM, 1!>02. 

his work on the monograph of the fossil sturftshes. A nionog-niph on 
the fossil Ostracoda is in conteinpUition. 

Mr. Lucas is still engaged on the monograph of the Stegosauria 
mention(Hl in my last report, and has also devoted some time to the 
study of certain points in the structure of Hesperornis and Baptornis. 
He has also studied a series of birds from the Pliocene of Oregon sub- 
mitted b\' Prof. J. ('. Merriam. 

ASSISTAXCK TO I^■DIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS. 

The usual custom of lending material for study has been followed, 
as in previous years. Material from the divisions of Geology and 
Mineralogy has thus been lent to the U. S. Geological Survey and ver- 
tebrate material to Messrs. Osborn. Gidley, and Hay. of the American 
Museum of Natural History in New York, and to Mr. .1. B. Hatcher, 
of the Carnegie Museum at Pittsburg. Material from the Section of 
Invcrte))rate Paleontology has l^een lent to Dr. John M. Clarke, of 
Albany; Dr. C. E. Beecher, of New Haven; Mr. ,]. K. Duerden, of 
Johns Hopkins University, and Miss Elvira Wood, of the Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology. The U. S. Geological Survey, as usual, 
has had free access to the materials whenever occasion demanded. 

PLANS FOR THE FUTURE. 

The generalized section across th(^ entire American continent, which 
was referred to in my last annual report, remains as yet untinished, 
owing to lack of funds. The collection which was to accompaii}" the 
same is also incomplete and remains in an old wall case entirely 
unsuited for this use, but which, it is hoped, may shortly be replaced. 

It is expected that the skeleton remains of the Triceratops or Clao- 
saurus will be mounted for exhibition dui'ing the coming 3'ear aiul, 
possibly, also, that of the Mastodon ol)tained at Church. Michigan, in 
the sununer of 1901. 

Furtlxu' development along lines other than those alread}^ estab- 
lished is rendered practically impossible, owing to lack of space. 

It is extremely desirable, if not essential to the welfare of the 
Museum, that the Department should l)e allowed to have an annual 
allowance for Held and collecting exi)enses. No museum can rel}^ 
wholly upon gifts for its advancement. Collections coming by this 
means ai'c invariably lacking in certain essential materials which can 
be Old}" in part supplied by purchase. Mon^ than that, the scientific 
force can not, 1 believe, be kept up to the desired point of efficiency if 
they are obliged to i-emain at their desks throughout the summer 
months. 1 am strongly in favor of sending men into tlie tield when- 
ever it is possible. At present thei'e are at least three I'egions capable 
of furnishing desirai)le fossil in\ertebrates, which it is very essential 
we should in\estigate at once, besides numerous localities for Axrte- 
brate fossils, minerals, and general geological materials.

Fifty-four species are described, 10 of which 
are new. Three of the new species and 
several of the old ones, though found in the 
We.st Indian region, are not known to inhabit 
Porto Rico. The name Pagurias is suggested 
for Pagurus.

to decide. The writer thinks it is a holotliu- 
rian related to Spxrothuria, but the spines and 
"digestive tube" are very much like those of 
an echinoid.

Proc. Ent. ,Soc. Wash., v, No. 1 (author's

The Diplopoda are discussed as an example 
of kinetic evolution, a progressive modifica- 
tion without natural selection and without 
diversification of habits. 

The earwig'.s forceps and thephy- 

logeny of insects. 

Proc. Ent. Soc. Wash., v, No. 1 (author's 
extr s publi-shed Apr. 28, 1902), pp. 84-92. 
The use of tho earwig's forceps is found to 
be the unfolding of the wings of the in.sect 
before flight, not the closing of them on 
alighting, as in the Staphylinid beetles. 
Winged insects with complete metamorpho.sis 
are held to be more primitive, and the anal- 
ogy of Dyscriiina as a larval earwig with Pro- 
Jaj)y.r as the larva of Japyx is pointed out. 
The cockroaches are less primitive than the 
May flies, Odonata, and other insects with 
acpiatic larva', and the derivation of the 
wings of insects from larval gills seems prob- 



COOK, Orator F. — Continued. 

able. The homology of the stylets of Proja- 
pyx with those of ScalopcndreUa, as suggested 
by Silvestri, indicates that the Diplopoda 
may prove to be a larviform offshoot from the 
insect phylum instead of an ancestral type, 
as commonly supposed.

DALL, William Healey, and SIMP- 
SON, Charles Torrey — Continued, 
a discussion of the literature relating; to tliat 
fauna, and the relations of the land and ma- 
rine faunas to those of adjacent regions. This 
is followed by an enumeration of the species 
known, together with a brief description of 
each, as well as a fuller description of those 
supposed to be new. In all the fauna con- 
tains 653 species, of which 42 are new. The 
enumeration is followed by a check list of 
the species, a list of the U. S. Fish Commission 
dredging stations, plates with explanations, 
and an inde.x. A few old species character- 
istic of the island are figured, and also the 
newly described forms, excepting one or two 
belated species. The species deseril)ed as 
new are as follows:

This is the first part of a general treatise on 
the birds of America north of the Panama 
Railroad, but including the Galapagos Islands. 
It embraces the family Fringillida', or Finches, 
of which 391 species are here recognized as 
coming within the limits of the work. Each 
species is fully described, its geographical 
distribution isgiven in detail, and an ample 
synonymy is appended. Twenty plates, rep- 
resenting the characters of the 69 genera 
treated, accompany the volume. The first 
37 pages of the work deal with the classifica- 
tion of birds, with keys to the family of 
Oscines, or songbirds, and to the genera of 
Fringillidse as represented within the geo- 
graphical limits stated above. Carpodacus 
mexicanus ."^onoriensis (p. 135), Saltator mag- 
noides medianus (p. 664), and Geospiza harterti 
(p. 507) are described as new.

scribed and illustrated, and their .source and

the age of the beds is that they are referable 
to the upper part of the Pottsville. The rela- 
tions and systematic position of the species 
are also con.sidered. They are found to ])e 
more closely allied to the group of broader 
proportions, in general characteristic of the 
Upper Pottsville, than to the linear group 
which prevails in the lower portions of the 
Pottsville of the Appalachian province. Sys- 
tematically they are regarded by the author 
as referable to the Ginkgoales, the Whittle- 
sey:e, in the judgment of the writer, being the 
oldest representatives of the Ginkgoales stock 
yet di.scovered.

Report on tiik Exhibit of the National Museum at the South 
Carolina, Interstate and AV est Indian Exposition. Chaiiles- 
TON, 1901-2 

By Frederick W. True, 

Head f'xrator, Department of Biologn, in chart/e. 

The South Carolina, Interstate and West Indian Exposition, held at Charleston, 
South Carolina, opened Deeeniber 1, 1901, and closed May ol, 1902. The olijcct ol" 
this exposition, as shown in its prospectus, was "to inaugurate new industries and 
commerce in the South; to open up new foreign markets, particularly in the West 
Indies; to I)egin the twentieth centur)M)f the Christian era with an exhibitimi of Ilu> 
arts of peace; to develop the American culture of silk and tea; to promote the Soutii- 
ern manufactures of cotton and iron; to establish new steamship lines from Cliarles- 
ton, the central seaport of the great Southeast; to show the woi-ld the resom-ces 
and attractions of the territory along the Southern seaboard and the advantages of 
Charleston as a connecting link between the producers of the Southeastern States 
and the IMississippi Valley on one side and the markets of the world on the other." 

In the sundry civil bill making provision for the expenses of the Government for 
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1902, an item was inserted for a Government exhibit 
at Charleston. This item was subsequently rejected, and as the Exposition would 
open befoi-e the matter could again be brought to tlie attention of Congress tiie 
director-general appealed to the President to order an exhiliit sent to Charleston 
with the understanding that the exposition company w'ould meet all expenses. 

The President was favorably inclined toward this request, and by his direction tlie 
Secretaries of the p]xecutive Departments instructed the proper ofheials to select from 
the exhibits made at the Buffalo Exposition, and send to C-harleston, such objects as 
would be appropriate for display in the latter ])lace. The Secretary of the Smith- 
sonian Institution also received a request from the dii-ector-gent'ral that some ]iart of 
the exhibits of the Institution and National IMusemn at the Buffalo Ex{)ositioii be sent 
to Charleston at the expense of the exposition company, which recjuest, after due c( m- 
sideration of all the circumstances, was granted. 

In his first message to Congress President Roosevelt mentioned the matter ol a 
Government exhibit at Charleston, as follows: 

"The people of Charleston, with great energy and civic spirit, are carrying on an 
exposition which will continue throughout most of the present session of ('ongress. 
I heartily commend this exposition to the good will of the people. It deser\-es all 
the encouragement that can be given it. The managers of the Charleston Exj)osition 
have requested the ('al)inet officers to place thereat the Government exhibits which 
have been at Buffalo, promising to pay the necessary exjienses. I have taken the 
responsibility of directing that this l)e done, for I feel that it is due to Charleston to 
help her in her praiseworthy effort. In my opinion the management should not be 
required to pay all these expenses. I earnestly re(!0unnend that the Congress a])pro- 
l)riate at once the small sum necessary for this inirpose." 

The space allotted to the Government exhibits was in the seiiucircular coloiuiades 
connecting the large central building known as the Cotton Palace with two otiier 
buildings— the Palace of Commerce and the South Carolina Building. These colon- 
nades were originally designed to be open on the sides, l)ut in order to properly 
house the Government collections they were enclosed and furnished with windows 
and skylights. A very good exhibition space was thus obtained at a moderate 

lti6 



lOT) REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM., 1902. 

expense. The portion of this space assiufned to the Smithsonian Institution and 
National Museum was on the west side of the grounds, between the Cotton Palace 
and the Palace of Commerce. Including a small Iniilding called an "exhedra," it 
comprised 5,682 s(iuare feet. The whole of the curved arcade, comprising 4,727 feet, 
was occupied by the Museum. 

After consultation with the officers of the Institution and Museum, anumlierof 
objects in the Buffalo exhibit which were too large for the space at Charleston, or were 
otherwise unsuitable, were ordered sent to Washington, and the remainder, com- 
prising about two-thirds of the original exhibit, were packed separately and for- 
warded to South Carolina. A number of preparators and mechanics were detailed 
from Washington to install the exhibit. This work was completed .lanuary 13, 1902, 
at which time the doors were thrown open to the public. 

As the collections displayed by the Museum at Charleston were the same as those 
shown at Buffalo, it is unnecessary to enumerate them here. A full description will 
be found in the Report for 1901 (pp. 177-231). 

The principal omissions at Charleston were the larger mammals, a part of the 
birds, reptiles, and fishes, the larger ethnological groups and the models of aboriginal 
dwellings, the skeleton of ILsperornh, the collection of native elements, etc. 

The largest ol)ject exhibited was the skeleton of the huge extinct reptile, Tricera- 
tops. This stood in a central position, and, on account of the excellent lighting, 
showed to even better advantage tlian at Buffalo. Around it were groujjed the other 
geological exhibits, occupying eight cases and comprising minerals, cave deposits, 
and invertebrate fossils. On the two sides of the central space were the exhibits of 
the departments of Anthropology and Biology. 

The principal exhibit of the Department of Anthropology consisted of six large 
groups, in separate cases, representing native American peoples. These were supple- 
mented by collections representing the products of different arts of t he native Ameri- 
cans, such as basketry and pottery, and native hunting and fishing implements, fire- 
making devices, etc. The group cases were placed against the west wall in a single 
row, and opposite them were the smaller cases, nine in number, arranged so as to 
form alcoves. 

The exhibit of the Department of Biology, which was at the opposite end of the 
space, had as its principal feature a case 40 feet long, containing mammals. This 
was placed against the west wall, and opposite and at the extreme end of the space 
were the smaller cases, arranged like those of the Dei>artmeiit of Antliropology, in 
the form of alcoves, and containing characteristic American tishcs, n'])tiles, batra- 
chians, and birds. 

The collection remained on exhibition until May 81, 1902, when the exposition 
closed. At this time preparators were again sent from the Museum to repack the 
collections, which work was completed June 16, 1902. 

On January 21, 1902, Congress appropriated $^90,000 to reimburse the exposition 
company for expenditures made in behalf of the Government exhibit. This appro- 
priation was not disbursed under the direction of a Government board or of the 
individual representatives of the several departments and bureaus, but by the Treas- 
ury Department directly to the exposition company. This arrangement worked 
somewhat disadvantageously, in so far as the Government exhibits were concerned, 
as it was necessary for the exposition company to a('tual]y pay out inoney from its 
own funds before reimbursement could be made by the Treasury. On June 12, 
1902, the affairs of the exposition company passed into the hands of a receiver, and 
no payments could be made until the court a(;ted in the matter. As the president 
of the exposition company declined to continue paying Government expenses from 
his private purse, and the court was unable to pass upon the case at once, a consider- 
able time elapsed during which no bills were settled. It is to be hoped that in 
similar cases in the future provision will be made for disbursement under the direc- 
tion of a Government board. 



APPENDIX VI. 

Report of Delp^gate to the Fifth Intkkxatioxai, Zooi.ociicAL 
Congress, Berlin, August 12-It;, 1'.H>1. 

I'n.f. S. P. Langley, 

Srcrcfarji, S'inil]isoiil<ni Tiixtilnllon. 

Dear Sir: I havt> tlie lioiior to sulmiit herewitli a ])v\vi acroiiiit nt' my vinit to tlic 
Fifth International Zooloirical t'on;.q-css at Ik-rlin, to whicli, on .Inly 1">, IHOI, yon 
appointed me a delegate to represent the Smithsonian Institution and the I'nited 
States National IVInsenm. 

The congress was opened on Angnst 12 and lasted until August 10, when the dele- 
gates and mem1)ers adjourned to attend the reception given in their honor hy the 
High Senate of Hand)nrg. The 17tli was spent in Ilanihnrg ins])e('ting the zoological 
collections there, and on August 18 and 19 most of the nunnhers visited the Marine 
Biological Station on Heligoland. Having urgent business at the Hand)urg Natur- 
historisches Museum, I remained there instead of going to Heligoland. 

The congress was in every respei't a success. Not only was the attendance (about 
750 members) greater than at any previous congress, but the standard of the scientific 
papers and discussions was unexcelled. I need only refer to the lectures by Prof. 
G. B. Grassi (Rome) on the malaria prol)lem from a zoological standpoint, Prof. 
Yves Delage (Paris) on the theories of fecundation, Professor Biitschli (Heidelberg) 
on vitalismus and mechanismus, and Professor Branco (Berlin) on fossil remains 
of man. 

One of the main factors of this success was the unexampled interest in the con- 
gress displayed by th('(i('rman ( iovernment. A large sum of money was placed at 
the disposition of the local committee l)v the Government, and the German Crown 
Prince, as the high protector of the congress, was only prevented from opening the 
congress in person by the death of his grandmother, the dowager Emj)ress Friedrich, 
a few days previ<nis. The c( mgress was lavishly entertained by the cities of Beiliii and 
Hamburg, as well as l)y the Zoological Society of Berlin. P>ut the most extraordi- 
nary proof of the ])ublic interest in the congress was probably the fact that tiie entire 
" Reichstagsgebaiide," the magniticent house of the Glerman I'arliament, was placed 
at the disposition of the Congress for its meetings, lectures, etc. Thus all the general 
sessions were held in the great "Plenarsitzungssaal" of the Parliament. The Emperor 
himself, though prevented from receiving the members oflicially on account of the 
death of his mother, took occasion to greet them informally. 

The more special object of my joining the congress was to take part in the delib- 
erations and decisions of tiie connnittee on zoological nomenclature, of whicli I had 
been elected a mendjerat the congress in Cambridge in 1898. The work of the com- 
mittee, which met before the congress opened and continui'd for some time alter its 
close, occupied so mucli of the time of the members that the meetings of the sections 
had to be neglected. I was thus prevented from reading a paper on the Herpetology 
of Porto Rico, which had Invn announced, but was able to act as one of the vice- 
presidents at the second general session. The work in this I'ommittee on nomencla- 
ture was, on the whole, eminentlv satisfactory from the standpoint of American 

if.r

zoologists, though it was found impossible to lay a draft for a complete code for the 
congress at its Berlin meeting. It is hoped that this will be accomplished at the 
next congress, which is to be held in Berne, Switzerland, in 1904. 
Very respectfully,

INTRODUCTION 

Aboriginal Britisli or Pictisli baskets aiul a thousand receptacles, 
says Terence, were carried to Rome by the successors of Julius Cwsar, 
and Martial adds that the word ""basket" is Pictish." though the Romans 
would have us l)elieve it to have lieen indio;enous. 

R(Mnnants of basketry are o-athered from the Swiss lake dwidlino's. 
made in several of the technical proces.ses well known to thc^ American 
Indians and to be desci-ibed later. 

In the second volume of Keller's Lake Dwellin<>-s (pis. i;^>4-13T) 
are startlingly interesting groups of such basketry. Vou have, first 
of all, the methods of treating the bark of trees and tlax to form the 
tiber in various stages of preparation. Network and frame weaving- 
are also there illustrated, but in this plac(>. attention is drawn only to 
the basketry. On his Plate l;-!4 may l)e seen plain checkerwork and 
twined work in 2-strand and ;^>-stand varieties, also coiled work in the 
following varieties: {a) Foundation of two rods, sewing done with bark 
strips so as to inclose both rods l)elow. the stitches interlocking; {h) 
foundation of two rods, sewing inclosing them both, ))ut not one of the 
I'ods underneath; the stitches interlock and split the upper portion of 
the one just below, as in many American baskets. The twined work of 
Robenhausen and Wangen is in a great number of varieti(\s. There is 
solid, plain weaving; also open work twined weaving, th<* body being 
stems of plants; l)orders are held together with twined weaving. In 
some specimens of open work the warp of twined weaving is in })airs; 

«0n the derivation of the word, however, connult the New Enfrhsh I)ictioiiar\- :uid 
the Century Dictionary.

186 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

but there are not .shown in an}' of Keller's plates the types of twined 
work in which the warp plays an}' part for ornamentation; and in the 
remains, so far as examined, no attempts are made at eml)roidery, or 
overlaying-, or any of the species of tine decoration, to be seen in the 
Alaskan or Calif ornian weaving." 

In the Arabian Nights, the story of tlie lady who was murdered by 
her husband mentions a very large basket, by its size reminding one 
of the granary ])ask(^ts of California, ))ut this was evidently in coiled 
work, very nuich in the style of the Hopi plaques. The Caliph, 
Haroun Alraschid — 

came to the bank of the river, and Wui fisherman, liavini; tlirown in his net, when 
he drew it ont again bronght up a trunk, close shut and very heavy. The CaHph 
made the vizier pay him 100 sequins immediately and sent him away. Mesrour, 
by his master's orders, carried the trunk on his shoulders, and the Caliph, 
eager to know what it contained, returned to the palace with all speed. Wlien the 
trunk was opcMied, they found in it a large basket made of palm leaves, shutuji, and 
the covering sewed with red thread. To satisfy the Calipli's imimtience, they cut 
the thread with a knife and took out of the basket a package wrapped in a sorry 
piece of hanging and bound about with rope, in wluch, when untied, tliey found, to 
their amazement, the dead body of a young laily cut in small pieces. 

The Ute Indians in ancient times used basketry for mortuary pur- 
poses, but by th(nn made of the rarest material and with faultless 
workmanship, adorned with symbols of their religion. The dead man 
or woman was covered with a large carrying basket, and all around 
were laid witii loving care the finest specimens of the craft. 

It is interesting to know that the lirst mention of })askets in the 
Bible is in connection with dreams, floseph was a prisoner in Egypt. 
He had interpreted the l)utler's dream so favorably that Pharaoh's 
baker came also to him. 

When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, 

1 also was in my dream, and, behold, I liad three white baskets on my head; and 
in the njjpi'rmost basket [»»/] there w'asof all manner of baked meats [sweetmeats] 
for Pharaoh ; and the 1 )irds did eat them out of the liasket upon my head. And Joseph 
answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three 
days; yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall 
hang tJK'e on a tree; and the liirds shall eat thy Hesh from off thee. 

It may in general be assumed that thc^ baskets used ])y the Israelites 
were not unlike those of the Egyptians. If the ancient l)askets of 
Egypt resembled the modern, those mentioned were of the coiled type, 
made from palm leaf, resembling thick bread pla([ues of the Hopi 
pueblos of Arizona. They were doubtless in use throughout North 
Africa long l)efore the days of Joseph. 

Specimens of this type of ancient coiled ])asketry were dug up In^ 
Randal I-Maclver and Wilkin at El Armah, miles south of the site of 

'^' Ferdinand Keller, The F^ake Dwellings of Switzerland and other jiarts of Europe, 

2 vols., London, 1S7S. 



ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 187 

Abydos, ill luiildlc Ejij;vpt. I'hey are tlio oldest thut 1kiv(! y«^t boon 
found in the world. El Arniah dates back to tlie earliest ••new rac(\" 
throuo-h the entire middle period down to the late prehistoric in 
Eg-ypt. Far up the Nile the type persists. It will l)e seen in abun- 
dance at Aden, and it exists in much more elegant mat(M-ial in Hin- 
dustan. This proves the pcn'sistenee of a single tyi)e througii six 
thousand years. Long ago caravans took it into the heart of Africa. 
and the reader must not be surprised further on in discovering at 
least a limited sphere of intluence for it in America, where the descend- 
ants of tlie Moors who invaded Spain left them. 

The Greek word for basket is kaneon, or kanastron, from kanna. a 
reed, whence our cannister, through the Latin canistra. Or. (o come 
closer to our theme, basketry was made long ago in the warmer coim- 
tries of the Old World, as they are now in the New, from cane. In tlie 
time of Homer this word was applied frequently to receptacles of 
clay, bronze, and gold. Doubtless, in earlier ages the Oreek women 
were nimble-tingered l)asket makers. ]>ut tiie forms are not presei'\ cd. 

Wherever civilization has come in contact with lower races, whether 
in Britain, Africa, Polynesia, or America, it has found the woman 
enjoying the most friendly acquaintance with textile plants and skill- 
ful in weaving their roots, stems, and leaves into basketry, matting, 
and other similar products Avithout machinery. Basketry was well- 
nigh universal throughout the Western Hemisphere before the dis- 
covery, while at least one-half o^the area was devoid of pottery. 

Ancient cenieteries, mounds, caves, ruins, and lake dwellings gave 
evidence of the high aiiti([uity of the art in both continents. The 
researches of Holmes and A\'illoughby on mound pottery; of Yarrow 
and Schumacher in southwestcn'n California; of Cushing, Fewkes. and 
Hough in ancient pueblos; of Nordenskjold and Pepper in the clill' 
dwellings of the southwest; of G. O. Dorsey, of the Field Columbian 
Museum, and many European ex])lorers in Peru, demonstrate that no 
cBanges have taken place in this respect, either in the variety of the 
technical processes or the fineness of the workmanship. Thi'i'c is an 
unbroken genealog}' of basket making on the Continent, running back 
to the most ancient times. 

For a time cheap patented ware made from veneering threatened to 
o})literate the ancient plicated basket, but at the same time the latter 
became exalted to a pastime and a fine art, and there >vere never so 
many genuine lovers of the handicraft as at present. 

In the past few years a sympathetic spirit has been awakened in the 
United States to keep alive this charming aboriginal art and to pre- 
serve its precious relics. In every Stat*^ in the Union will be found

" nierchantnian seeking goodly pearU, who, when he had found one 
pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it." 
The genuine enthusiasm kindled in the search, the pride of success 
in the acquisition, the care bestowed upon them, witness that the 
basket is a worthy object of study. The story is told of a distin- 
guished collector who walked many weary miles to the shelter of a 
celebrated old weayer. He spent the day admiring lier work, but 
still asking for something better. He knew that she had made liner 
pieces. At last flattery and gold won. She tore out the back of her 
hut, and there, hid from mortal eyes, was the l)asket that was to be 
burned at her death. Nothing could be more ])eautiful, and it will be 
her monument. 

I. DEFINITION OF BASKETRY 

A jilafo for cvorythins. — Franklin. 

Basketry is the mother of all loom work and beadwork. In that 
elaboration of industries, through which they pass from naturism to 
artilicialism, from handwork to machine work, from human power to 
beast power, wind power, water power, steam or Are power, and electric 
power, the loom is no exception. The iirst and most yersatile shuttles 
were women's fingers. Machinery has added speed. But there are 
many niceties of technic to which the machine deyice can not yet 
aspire. 

Oyer and aboye the sympathetic, spirit engendered and the kmd 
encouragement giyen to exquisite and most worthy artists })y the col- 
lection of basketr}^, the study is a yery important one from the side of 
culture. It is the alpha of an art in which ])illions of capital are 
invested, millions of human beings are employed, whose materials and 
products are transported to earth's remotest limits, whose textures 
are sought by eyery tribe of mankind. It is from this last point of 
view that the present work is written. 

The praises of men who inyented the cotton gin, the power loom, 
and the tapestry loom will be repeated, and monuments erected to 
memorialize those who harnessed the forces of nature to do their bid- 
ding. Here a good word is said for the earlier, more primitive, women 
who made the others possible. It is true that pride in the ownership 
of an exquisite piece of work may be joined Avith frigid indift'erence 
toward the maker. It is to be hoped that with admiration of Amer- 
ican basketry may be coupled a humane feeling for Indian women 
themselves, who have made so nuich genuine pleasure possil)le, 

American basketry, ancient anel modern, ma}' be studied under the 
following subdivisions: 

I. Definition of the art, its Tuateriais, tools, processes, and products. 
II. Materials for basketry, with lists of plants, animals, minerals, including the 
Indian name, cnmmon names, scientitic names.

Southeastern Alaska, Queen Charlotte Archipelaoo. 

3. Fraser-Colunihia region: Fraser drainage, Colunihia drainage. 

4. Oregon-California region: Southern Oregon, California. 

."). Interior Basin region : Between Rocky Moiuitains and the Sierras. 

G. Middle and South American region: Mexico, Central America, 
eastern and Avestern South America. 

These regions nuist be regardcnl only as convenient divisions for 
reference. The last named is a meastire of ignorance, rather, for it 
could easily be divided into half a dozen r(>gions. Again, !>efore the 
balance of savagery had been violently disturbed by the discovery of 
the hemisphere there were migrations of native ])lood and speech and 
arts. Basketry further on will be witness to many of these. 

Basketrv is ditierentiated from network by the fact that the meshes 
of the latter are not formed Ity decussations, but by knots; and from 
loom products, not only })y the material, which is usually less rigid, 
but b}' the workmanship, which is done l)y machinery. Needlewoi'k 
is approached in coiled basketry and beadwork ))orrows from all weaves. 
Xo wide gulf separates the diti'erent varieties of textiles, however, 
beginning with such coarse products as l)rush fences and lish weirs and 
ending with the finest lace and needlework. 

In form })asketr3" varies through tht^ following classes of objects: 

1. Flat mats or wallets, generally tiexil)le. 

2. Plaques or food plates, which are slightl}' concave. These octtir 
in (juality of the coarsest sieve to that of the sacred meal tray. 

o. Bowls for mush and other foods and for ceremonial purposes, 
hemispherical in general outline. 



190 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

4. Pots for cooking, with cylindrical sides and i-ounded or Hat 
bottoms. These vary into cones, truncated cones, and trough-shaped 
baskets. 

5. Jars and fanciful shapes, in which the mouth is constricted, fre- 
(juently \ ery small, and now and then sup})lied Avith cover. Thev arc 
s])indle sha})ed, pyriform, nai)if()rm, and, indeed, imitate fruits known 
to the natives. The intlueuce of civilization in giving modern shapes 
to basketry has not always been benericial to this class of forms. 

W. II. Ilohnes, writing of the transition froiu service to decoration, 
speaks of foim in and on basketry as (1) functional and essential oidy, 
(2) functional and a'sthetic combined, and (H) as suprafunctional and 
wholly aesthetic. 

There are two distinct types of technic in ))asketry, namely, (1) hand- 
wo'oen l)asketry, which is ])uilt on a warp foundation, and (2) sewed 
or coiled basketry, which is built on a foundation of rods, splints, or 
straws. 

KINDS OF WOVEN BASKETRY 

A. Checkerwork: The warp and the weft having the same width, 
thickness, and ])liability. 

B. Diagonal or twilled basketry : Two or more weft strands over two 
or more warp strands. 

C Wickerwork: lntiexil)le warp; slender, tlexible weft. 

D. Wrapped weft, or single weft wrapped: The weft strand is 
Avrapped, or makes a bight al)()ut the warp at each decussation, as in 
the Mohave Kilio. 

K. Twined or wattled bask(»try: Weft of two or more elements. 

KINDS OF C'OILED BASKETRY 

A. Coiled work without foundation. 

B. Simple interlocking coils. 

C. Single-rod foundation. 

D. Two-rod foundation. 

E. Rod and welt foundation. 

F. Two-rod and splint foundation. 

G. Throe-rod foundation. 
//. Splint foundation. 

/. Grass-coil foundation. 

K. Fuegian coiled basketry. 

These will be descri))ed at length in the proper ])lace. 

In basket-making there are several characteristics to be observed 
which will enable one to classify the objects and to refer them to 
their several tribal manufacturers. These characteristics are the 
material, the framework, the methods of weaving, the coiling or sew- 
ing, the border, the decoration, the use, etc. 



AHORUUNAL AMKKrCAN 15ASKKTKV. 19] 

The tool almost utii\-(M'sally cniploycd in the inamil'act iirc of coiled 
AVai'(> is a bone awl or pricker. ()!' the manipulation of tlie matei-iai 
previously to the weaving little is known. 

In the technical drawing's accompanyinu- this })aper the actual sizeol" 
the specimens is o'eiu'raily indicated hy a series of inch marks in 
the niaro'in. The inches on the standai'd line ai'e shown li\ spaces 
between dots. In order to indicat(^ exactly the manner of weaxino-, a 
stpiare, usually an inch in dim(MisioM. is taken from a ])oi'tion of the 
surface wherein all the methods of maiii[)ulation occur. This s(piare. 
is enlaru'ed sutiiciently to maki^ the structure comprehensihje. 'I'his 
plan enat)h's one to show form and ornamentation in the whole Hirure, 
as well as the method of treatment in the eidaroed inch. 

The writer is indol)ted to a large numlx'r of fricMids in various ])arls 
of the. United States, especially on the Pacific slope, who have u-i\-eit 
him access to tluMr \aluat)le collections, furnished informatioji, and 
sent i)hotographs. Especial thanks are due to F. V. Coville for writing 
the chapter on plants, to William H. Holmes for a(l\ice in matters of 
ornamentation, and to Dr. C. Hart Merrituu for privilege of studying 
the |)recious colleetion made by him. Many friends who have gener- 
ously given their specitd knowledge and supj)lie(l photographs and 
illustrations will be mentioned in tlie proi)er place. At the same time 
he would express his admiration of their zeal and generosity, through 
which the Syl)illine lea\'es of an almost lost chapter in hmnan industi-ial 
history has been rescued from ol)livion. 

AVith a few exceptions the m;d<ers of baskets are women. In i\w 
division of labor belongitig to the lowest stages of culture the indus- 
trial arts were fostered by women, the nnlitary and aggressive arts by 
men. It is a wtdl-known rule in these first stages of pri^gress that, 
with few exceptions, the user of an implement or utensil was the 
maker of it. There are })eoi)le on the earth among whom the men arc 
the basket makers. Indeed, for ceremonial })urposcs our own Indian 
priests or medicine men arc fre<[uently the makers of their own basket 
drums, etc. 

xA..s soon as tlie products of this art entered into the world's com- 
merce, and uncanny machinery was necessary for the manufacture, the 
art of ))asket weaving pass(^d from the hands of its fostei- mothers and 
became man's work, but in the Western Hemisphere almost exclusively 
the basket makers ha\"e been women. 

It is a matter of profound regret that already over much of the 
United States the art has degenerated, or at least has been moditi<Hl. 
In methods, forms, and colors truly old things ha\e passed away, and, 
behold, all things have become new. But proof is forthcoming that 
the contrary is true in some places. The Hyde Expedition and other 
associations have made determined etiorts to resist the demoralizing 
influences of trade. 



192 BEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

This process of extinction has g-onc on with (litierinu- i-jipiditv in the 
several areas. Nothing ancient in mechanical processes, in form, and 
design can be predicated of the basketry sold atsiunnier resorts. The 
trees are felled by the white man and the trunks divided into ribbons 
by his latest machineiy. The Indian woman uses a steel gauge to 
regulate t\w widtii of her weft, steel awls for sewing. Even in West- 
ern ware the demand and influence of mei'ceiiary motives drown the 
cry of the ancient spirit in the lowly artist. Plate 1 will sliow the 
contiict for preeminence between the old and the new. Dogs and 
horses are mingled with designs older than the Disc-overy. (See 
also Plates 42, 16S.) 

But it is not alone the unrefined })ublic who eliminate tlu- delightful 
classic from the decoration of basketry; men and women with the 
most exalted motives have for centuries substituted Euroi)ean and 
Asiatic forms for aboriginal in basketry. 

Plate 2 is worthy of notice in this regard. Eliminate the human 
figures altogether as pictorial and realistic and without standing in an 
art whose designs are pi-eeminently synd>olical. Tiie others are 
divided into two series, thosi^ ))earing some suggestion of old patterns 
and those covered with classical fretwork as the underlying motive 
and then I'un wild with savage freehand. (See also Plates 50, 5S, 23o.) 

The reason for the genuine unspoiled art of the tribes in northwestern 
California is given })y Carl Purdy. The Franciscan fathers who built 
the missions in the central and southern portions of the State never 
penetrated these wilds; the traders of tiie Hudson's Ba}' Company, 
whose presence and traffic changed the arts of other Indians so pro- 
foundly, did not come so far south, and Mexican soldiers were driven 
out of the country. It was not until settlers in the middle of the last 
century began to maltreat the Indians that bloody conflicts arose which 
resulted in their present status, but, fortunately, these pioneers had 
no interest in baskets and probably did not notice them. There are in 
possession of old families in the Eastern States baskets sent home b}^ 
the Forty-niners that now are worth their weight in gold. The forms 
and designs on these are similar to many still made. This indicates 
that the art has kept its old-time purity. 

It must be distinctly understood that many basket-making Indians 
are not now in their priscan homes. Besides the migration occasioned 
by the ordinary motives operating on the minds of savages, the rapid 
intrusion of white settlers and the strong arm of the Government have 
hastened these movements. For our purposes these compulsory migra- 
tions must be noted specially in the case of basket makers. For 
example, on the Round Valley reservations in northern California are 
the Concow (Pujunan) ; and from the eastern side of the Sacramento Val- 
ley, the Nomolakki and Wailaki (Copehan), Little Lakes (Kulanapan), 
Ukie (Yukian), and Pit rivers (Palaihnahan), belonging to five al)so- 
lutely different linguistic families. Now, in a collection of baskets

from Round Valley one must not be surprised to Ihul shapes, uses. 
decorations, und names for the same form or p;u-t oi- desiun extr(«mely 

varied and mixed. 

The author is aware that he has come far sliort of doiii.o- justi(;e to 
his theme. Omissions will be noticed, and it is feared that some refer- 
ences of work to the wrong band or tribe have ))een made. This is 
unavoidable in a great museum. It is only in such rare collections 
as have been gathered with one's own hands that such errors can be 

avoided. 

VOCABULARY OF BASKETRY 

So nuich is said and" written on the subject of Indian ))asketry that 
a ^-ocabulary is desirable. On some terms all are even now agreed. 
All things considered, words in common use should be adopted. 
There are, as before mentioned, two absolutely diU'ercnt kinds of 
technic employed, dividing l)asketry into -wore/i and roJ/r/L The 
former leads to the loom, the latter to the needle. It is not correct 
to speak of warp and weft in the latter, only in the former; the parts 
of coiled basketry are the fouudafio/t and the .sv //v'y^y. The following 
terms and detinit'ions are suggested, not ar!)itrarily, but subject always 
to amendment and common consent. AYords from Indian languages 
are purposely omitted. A few of them, however, ought to be retained, 
such as "tee," for the Pomo twined weaving: 

Bad'ef.^A vessel or receptacle in textile material: a technic product 
resembling this. 

Basketry.— X general term including (1) basket making, the process 
or art; (2) basket work, the technic or stitches, any textile motive 
resembling work in baskets; (3) basket ware, a collection of finished 

products. 

Becunng.—X strip of bark or a splint run in and out through the 
spaces in woven or among the stitches in coiled basketry. 

Braidwork.—FvihYiQ in which three or more elements are braided, 
as in some three-strand twined Ixrsketry. See False bmJd. Preferred 
to the word plaited. There nray l;)e flat, round, or square braid. The 
term sennit is also allowalde. 

Buttonhole stitcL—A series of half hitches, as hi Fuegian coiled 

basketry. 

67/t'ci'.— Where warp and weft cross. 

CheckerworL— Basket ys^ovk in which the warp and weft are equally 
flexible and the checks are square, or at least rectangular. 

j7/^^.„^.(,,,._V-shaped ornament, in which two or more colored lines 
meet at an angle; for example, the device on the sleeve of a non- 
commissioned officer. {See IL'rrni(dMait and Z/gmfj.) 

Ch.-nl'tnf/.—Soit materials Ijetweeu hard stems in the foundation ot 
coiled basketry.

II. MATERIALS FOR BASKETRY 

Miiil is oiii' world, ;mil liath anotluT to-attfinl liiiii. — Emk.rsox. 

In the manufacture of their baskets the Indians have ransacked 
the three kingdoms of nature — mineral, animal, and vegetal. For 
the lirst named Cushing has shown how the Ilavasupai Indians line thi^ 
inside of a basket with clay in order to render it fireproof. A great 
many of the paints or dyes with which the baskets are colored are 
drawn from the mineral kingdom. In the decoration of l)asketry 
beautiful stones and the mineral shells of mollusks are employed, 
either whole or cut into beads and pendants. (See Plate 3.) 

Besides the beautiful shells, teeth, wings of insects, and other hard 
animal su])stances used for added ornament, softer parts enter into 
the very texture of l)asket work. In a few localities the tril)es have 
relied on them largely. It will be seen that wool of goat, sheep, and 
llama are treated in preciseh^ the same manner as splints of wood. The 
imdressed skins of smaller mammals, notably the rabbit, are cut into 
strings and twisted; and dressed hides into babiche to sei'V(» as weft in 
woven baskets and bags. Sinew thread was employed in making coiled 
basketry about the Great Lakes and farther north. But the most 
serviceable animal substance for basketry was the feather, its j)Iume 
for decoration and its quill for hard work as well as ornament. Por- 
cupine quills were likewise split and worked into coiled l)asketrv, in 
addition to their embellishment of birch-bark utensils. The multitude 
of uses for feathers in this art will be described later. 

The chief dependence, however, of the l)asket maker is upon the 
vegetal kingdom. Nearly all parts of plants have been used by one 
tribe or another for this purpose — roots, stems, bark, leaves, fruits, 
seeds, and gums. It would seem as though in each area for purposes 
intended the vegetal kingdom had Ijcen thoroughly explored and 
exhausted above ground and under ground. Is it not marvelous to 
think that unlettered savages should know so nuich botau}- ? Mr. Ches 
nut, in his Plants used by Indians of Mendocino County, California, 
calls attention to the fact that in our advanced stat(^ we are yet liehind 
these savages, not having caught up with theui in the discoverv and 
uses of some of their best textile materials. 



198 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

How did the savages find out that the roots of certain plants hid 
away under the earth were the best possil)le material for this function ( 
And for another use the stem of a phuit had to be found, perhaps 
miles away, so that in the makeup of a single example leagues would 
have to be traveled and much discrimination used. Unless the utmost 
care is exercised the fact will be overlooked that often three or four 
kinds of wood will be used in the monotonous work of the weft. One 
is best for the bottom, another is lig'ht and toug'h for the body, a 
third is ])est for the flexible top. This in addition to the employment 
of half a dozen others for designs, for warp or foundation, or for 
decorative purposes. 

Among the basket maker's materials must not ho forgotten the 
deuiand for water-tight vessels. Besides the widely spread faculty of 
securing- this result b}" texture, there were present in certain areas 
natural substances such as the gum of the pin3'on {Pinus exhilU), the 
resin of various pines, and even the mineral asphalt. 

The making of canteens and other water vessels, in lieu of potter}^, 
in this way was most prevalent among the Shoshonean tribes of the 
Interior Basin and the migratory Apache farther south. Barrows" 
calls attention to Humboldt's Essay on New Spain,'' in which the 
Indians around Santa Barbara are spoken of as '"presenting the Span- 
iards with vases verj- curiously wrought of stalks of rushes" and 
"covered within with a ver}^ thin layer of asphaltum that renders 
them impenetrable to water.'' 

The author is greatly indebted to Mr. Frederick V. Coville, Botanist 
of the- Department of Agriculture, for the identification of plants 
used in basketry h\ the Indians of America north of Mexico. This 
list contains those that have been certainly identified. There are 
other plants alleged to be used in basketr}^, but of which no scientific 
determination has been made as yet. A complete discussion of this 
part of the su})ject would demand that for each tribe making baskets 
there should be a list of the plants employed by them, and for each 
plant used a list of the tribes hj whom it is used. Such a discussion 
requires a long and tedious investigation by a number of talented 
workers cooperating. It is hoped that the chapter here given by 
Mr. Coville will be a starting point iov a complete study of Indian 
phytotechn}^

ABORIGINAL AMEKICAN BASKETRY. I'jy 

PLANTS USED IN ];ASKETRY 

By Frederick V. ('o\ii,i.f.. 

While some of the. materialis used by Aniefican Indiiui trihcs in 
their hjisketry have long' been known, by far the hirger nuinhcr had 
not becMi identihed with precision ])rior to tlie beo-inning of the [)ast 
decade. Most students of Indian phints had ))een satisfied with casual 
names ap})lied ])y themselves or given to them by botanists after (he 
examination of fragmentary specimens. Since the yeai- Ls'.Mi u few 
])()tanists, notably Mr. V. K. Chesnut, of the Department of Agricul- 
ture, have turned their attention t(j the plants used by the aborigines 
and have made new records with detinite identifications of the })lants 
concerned, covering among other sul)jects of Indian activity that of 
l)asketry. When, therefore, after Professor Mason's in\ it-.ition to 
prepare a chapter on the subject, the compilation of existing records 
was begun it was found that the earlier pu})lications contained much 
that was indelinite, c()nsideral)le that was incorrect, and a little that 
was })oth correct and exact. The nota])le exception to the general 
ruh^ was the puljlications of Dr. Edward Palmer, Avhose work as a 
})otauical collector in the western United States and Mexico extended 
from the late sixties of the last century to the present time, lender 
the circumstances it was determined to admit only such matter as was 
capable of veritication, based, first, on the writer's own ol)ser\ation; 
second, on published records that seemed to come under the last of 
the categories mentioned above; and, third, on the collections of the 
United States National Museum. A few unverified statements have 
been admitted for the purpose of bringing them to the attention of 
those who may be in a position to ^'erify them. In the case of state- 
ments which did not originate with the writer a parenthetic rc^ference 
indicates the source of the information and, if published, the year of 
its publication. The work as here presented is recognized as by no 
means complete, but it is .oli'ered as a substantial ])asis for future 
investigation. 

Acer macropliylluni. Orejjon Majile. 

Pa!-sun^-slu (Ynki). 

The Indians of Mendocino C^ounty, California, particularly the Con- 
cows, who now occupy a reservation there, use the white inner bark, 
preferal)ly gathered in spring, in making baskets. (V. K. Chesmit, 
190:>.) Froip its inner bark the Indians of the Pacilic slope mak(^ 
baskets so closely woven as to hold water. (J. T. Rothrock, IStJT.) 

Adiantum pedatum. Maidenliair Fern. 

The slender, black or dark-brown, shining stems, after splitting, are 
used by the Indians of Mendocino County, California, in the orna- 



200 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSETTM, 1902. 

mentation of some of their baskets, particularly those worn as hats. 
(V. K. Chesnut, 1902.) The Hupa Indians of Humboldt County, Cali- 
fornia, and other near])y tribes use the stems in the same way. The 
practice extends also to the Snohomish Indians of western Washington 
(C. M. Buchanan, letter) and to the Tlinkit Indians of southern Alaska. 
(G. T. Emmons, letter). 

Agave deserti. -^ Pesert Agave. 

In the coiled basket bowls of the Coahuilla Indians of southern 
California the cleaned fiber from the leaves is used to form the first 
few turns of the coil, which is then continued with grass stems. Evi- 
dently the grass is not sufiiciently flexible to make these first turns 
without breaking, but the Agave fiber answers the purpose admirably. 
(Cat. Nos. 207580 and 20T581, U.S.N.M.) Some of the basket hats of 
the Diegueno Indians of San Diego County, California, are woven from 
cords made of the cleaned and twisted fiber, and from their great 
strength must be almost indestructible b}^ a.ny ordinary wear. (Cat. 
No. 19T61, U.S.N.M.) 

Alnus oreg-ana. Red Alder. 

Among the Hupa Indians of northern California the roots are some- 
times used as weft at the beginning of a l)asket and in a round between 
the bottom and the sides (P. E. Goddard, notes). 

Alnus rhombifolia. White Alder. 

Various species of alder have ])een used by the American aborigines 
to produce an orange or red-brown dye, l)ut the only authenticated 
use of alder in dyeing basket materials seems to he that of Alnus 
rhonihi/olia among the Hupa, Yuki, and other Indians of northern 
California. The dye is obtained from the bark by infusion in water, 
or sometimes the bark is chewed and the material to be dyed is drawn 
through the mouth. 

Amaranthus palmeri. Amaranth. 

Ko'-mo (Moki). 

This is the source of a pink to purple dye used in the coiled and wicker 
plaques of the Moki Indians of northern Arizona, (W. Hough, 
notes.) The identification is by C. F. Millspaugh. 

Amelanchier alnifolia. Sarvieel)erry. 

I-ta^-ge (Apache). 
Chak (Klamath). 

The small, straight, peeled branches of this and other species of 
Amelanchier are used by the Apaches of the White Mountain Indiar 
Reservation, Arizona, to form the uprights in their large carr3nug 
baskets, a use for which the very tough wood is well adapted. The

Apocynum caimabinum. Indian Ilcniii. 

Tlie well-known Indian hiMiip, inclvidino- a nniiil)er of jjlaiit forms 
once referred to Aixxijinn}! cannul)! mi m ^ but now treated as belono-- 
ino- to several species, occurs from the Atlantic to th(» Pacific coast and 
was and still is wicUdy used by the aborioine.s in the making of uiany 
kinds of cordage articles. It is commonly cit(^d as an Indian basket 
material, and althoug'h it has not been possible to s(H'ur(> a veritial)le 
record of its use in a basket, it is altogether probable that some of 
the string's and cords so frequentl}' used in beginning a basket, or in 
making the carrying loops, are twisted from Ww iiuier bark of this 
plant. (See illustration in Chesnut's Plants used l»y the Indians of 
Mendocino County, California/') 

Artemisia ludoviciana. Worm wood. 

Hantj-al (Coahuilla). 

In that portion of the Colorado Desert of California known as the 
Cal)eson Valley the Coahuilla Indians make from the stems of this 
plant the large granary baskets in which they store seeds and other 
dried vegetable foods. (D. P. Barrows, lOOO.) The plant was identi- 
fied by W. L. Jepson. 

Arundinaria tecta. Cane. 

The split outer portion of the stems of the cane was the favorite 
basket material of the Southern Indians, including the Choctaws, 
Chickasaws, Cherokees, Creeks, Seminoles, and other tribes from 
Texas and Arkansas to the Carolinas, and it is still in use among the 
remnants of these peoples. The handsome ))askets of the Chetimacha 
and Attakapa Indians of Louisiana are made from split cane. 

Berberis nervosa. Oregon Grape. 

.Vmong the Hupa Indians of northern California a yellow dye is 
obtained by steeping the twigs and bark of one of the species of 
evergreen barbeny, or Oregon grape. (Mary H. jNIanning. letter.) 
Leaves of scjuaw grass {Xerophyll urn. tena;e) d ved with this are some- 
times used in the 3^ellow patterns occasionally seen in the Hupa hat 
baskets. The same material and dye are used in the huckleberrj^ 
baskets of the Snohomish (C. M. Buchanan, letter) and Klikitat 
Indians of western Washington. The particular species used has been 
definitely identified in one instance as Berherln ncrvom. Another 
species, £. aqulfolhivt, is undoubtedly used also.

202 EEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

Betula populifolia. "White Birch. 

The soft Avood of this tree is still ('iiipk)yecl in the northeastern 
United States and Canada by the descendants of the Algonkin and 
Iroquois in the making of baskets. (V. Havard, 1890.) These bas- 
kets are thoroughly modernized and doubtless give little idea of the 
aboriginal methods of using this material. 

Bromus sitchensis. Bromegrass. 

The split stems are sometimes used by the Tlinkit Indians of the 
south Alaskan coast as an overlaying material for the white patterns 
of spruce-root baskets. (G. T. Emmons, notes.) 

Butneria occidentalis. Calycanthus. 

Sai ka-le^ (Pomo). 

Both the wood and the bark from young shoots of this shrub are 
used in basketr}^ by the Indians of Mendocino Count}^, California. 
(V. K. Chesnut, 1902.) 

Calamagrostis lang-sdorffii. Bhiejomt. 

Chu^-kan shark ki-kark-tnsh^ (Tlinkit). 

The split stem is sometimes used for overlaying material in the 
spruce-root baskets of the Tlinkit Indians of the south Alaskan coast. 
(G. T. Emmons, notes.) 

Carex barbarae. Sedge. 

Ka-hum^ (Pomo). 

The long, tough, woody, interior portion of the rootstocks of this 
sedge is used to form the white sewing strands in the fine coiled bas- 
kets of the Pomo Indians of northern California. Among the neigh- 
boring Wailakis the roots of another unidentified species of Carex are 
used in the same way, and the leaves are made into hats and crude, 
somewhat flexible baskets. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.) 

Cartharaus tinctorius. False Saffron. 

A-sap-zran^-I (Moki, from the Spanish). 

This plant, introduced by the Spanish, produces a bright 3'ellow 
dye, used in basketry by the Moki Indians of northern Arizona. 
(W. Hough, notes; Cat. Nos. 11721 and 11726, U.S.N.M.) 

Ceanothus integerrimus. California Lilac. 

HiM)i (Concow). 

The long, flexible shoots are used in basket making by the Concows 
of northern California. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.) 



ABOKIGINAt AMEEICAN BASKETRY. 208 

Cercis occidentalis. Keillnid. 

Che-e (Yuki). 

The wood of the branches, with or without the })urk. is used in ])as- 
ketry b}^ man}' California tribes, notably ])y the Round Valk\y Indians 
of northern California. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902). Among the Nishinani 
Indians of Bear Valley, Placer County, the willow foundations in cer- 
tain coiled baskets are sewed together with a thread of redbud wood. 
(Stephen Powers, 187T.) The dark red patterns in tiie l)askets of the 
Pit River Indians and the Tulare Indians are formed from split 
branches with the })ark left on. 

Ceropteris triangularis. (Told('nl)ack. 

This little fern, known usually as Gijinmxjranniia trlaiHjKfaris^ luis a 
black stipe or stem which is sometimes used by the Round Valley 
Indians (V. K. Chesnut, 1902) and the Hupa Indians (Mary II. Man- 
ning, letter) of northern California as a substitute for maidenhair 
stems, when these are not availal)le, in l)lack basket patterns. 

Clirysothainnus laricinus. Kal)l)itl)rnHh. 

:\Ia'-i-bi (Moki). 

The l)ranches are sometimes used by the Moki Indians of northeastern 
Arizona for the weft of theii liner wicker pla([ues. (W. Hough, notes.) 

Chrysothamnus moquianvis. - Rabbitljruhih. 

Ha^-no Khi^-va-pi (Moki). 

The twigs are used at Oraibi, Arizona, to form the weft in the 
wicker plaques of the Moki Indians. (W. Hough, notes.) The identi- 
fication of the plant (U. S. Nat. Herb, 271-057) is by E. L. (xreene, 
the species being one closely related to the widel\' distributed ('hnjso- 
tliamnus \B!<jdovl(i\ graoeolens. 

Cinna latifolia. Wood Keinlgrass. 

Chu^-kan sliark (Tlinkit). 

Among the grasses employed ))y the Tlinkit Indians of the south 
Alaskan coast for the white patterns in their spruce-root baskets this 
species is the commonest. The part used is the stem, from which 
sections are split to be applied as an overlay on the spruce-root strands. 
(G. T. Emmons, notes.) 

Cladium mariscus. Clad i am. 

From the root, coiled baskets of excellent quality are made by 
tribes on the lower Sierra from Fresno River to Kern River, Califor- 
nia. (C. Hart Merriam, 1903.) Identified by Miss Alice Eastwood. 

Corylus californica. Hazelnut. 

01 iiiaiii (Yuki). 

The shoots of the hazehiut are used by many of the Indian tribes 
from northern California to Washington, west of the Cascade Moun- 



204 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

tains, ill the making of baskets, especiall}" as radials or uprights. 
(Mary II. ^Manning, letter.) The burden basket, })aby basket, and 
salmon plate of tlie Hupas are made entirely of the shoots of hazelnut. 
(P. E. Goddai-d, notes.) (See Plate 4.) 

Covillea tridentata. Creosote Bu8h. 

A gum-lac found upon the branches of this desert bush has a wide 
application among the southwestern Indians as a cement and among 
the Cocopas of northern Lower California it is used for pitching 
baskets. (E. Palmer, notes.) The gum, which occurs in conspicuous 
nodules of a reddish amber color, is not a direct exudation from the 
plant, but is deposited by a minute scale insect, Carteria larreae. 

Dasylirion ■wheeleri. Sotol. 

The leaves, split into strands about a quarter of an inch wide and 
the coarse marginal teeth removed, are used among the Pima Indians 
of southern Arizona in coarse twilled baskets. (Cat. No. 218027, 

U.S.N.M.) 

Delphinium scaposum. Larkspur. 

So-r(/-si (Moki). 

The flowers are the source of a light-blue dye used by the Moki 
Indians of northern Arizona in their coiled and wicker plaques. (W. 
Hough, notes.) 

Desclianipsia caespitosa. Tufted Hairgrass. 

Kut-kuk-kli'-te shark (Tlinkit). 

This is one of the grasses the split stems of which are used among 
the Tlinkit Indians of the south Alaskan coast to form the white pat- 
terns on their spruce-root baskets. (G. T. Emmons, notes.) 

Dondia suffrutescens. Sea Elite. 

The Coahuilla Indians of the Colorado desert in southern Califor- 
nia, blacken the stems of their l)asketry rush {Juncus acutits) by steep- 
ing them for several hours in a decoction of this plant. (E. Palmer, 
1878.) The identification of the species is by W. L. Jepson. 

Elymus mollis. Beach Rye. 

The split stems of this grass are sometimes used for the white pat- 
terns in the spruce-root baskets of the Tlinkit Indians on the south 
Alaskan coast. This material is employed only for coarse Ayork, and 
when other grasses better adapted for the purpose are not available. 
(G. T. Emmons, notes.) 



AJ5()RI(iIiNAL AMEKK'AN lUSKETllY. 205 

Epicampes rigens. Eiiii;iiii|)«'H. 

In the rooMon of tlie MoIuiac and Coloruilo dcsorts of soiithcasliM-n 
California tiio Panainint, Coahuilla (D. P. Barrows, 11)00). and otlici- 
tribes use this u-rass for the packing of their coiled l)askets. The purt 
used, at least in the better baskets, is that portion of the stem above 
the uppermost joint, which sometimes reaches a length of 45 centi- 
meters (18 inches). 

Equisetum palustre. Horsetail. 

Dalits (SiioliomiHh). 
Hill iiiuii-i' (Tlinkit). 

The rootstocks of this plant, which sometimes reach a diameter of 
1.5 centimeters (f inch) and a length of 20 centimeters (S inches) 
between the joints, were used in the early days, though rarcdy now. 
in th(> patterns on spruce-root Tlinkit baskets of the south Ahiskan 
coast. Strips are split from the surface of the rootstock and used as 
an overla3'ing material. The color is a i-ich. \'ery dark purple, which 
appears as a l)lack. (G. T Emmons, notes.) A similar use was madt^ 
of the plant, in their cedar-root baskets, })y the Snohomish Indians, 
of Puget Soiuid, Washington. (('. ]M. Ruchanan. notes.) 

Equisetum robustum. Scouriiiii' Knsli. 

The coal-black surface of the rootstock is sometimes used by the 
(yowlitz Indians of south westiM'n Washington as a substitute for the 
rootstock of E(iui'<etiu)h palnst I'o in the black o\erlay patterns ou cedar- 
root baskets. 

Evernia vulpina. Wolf IMoss. 

Se'-lio-li (Tlinkit). 
Swil'-ii-sani ( Klamath ) . 

This 3-ellow tree-lichen was widely used as a dye by the Indians of 
the timbered area of the western United States. The Klamath Indians 
of Oregon, as well as the Hupas of northern California (Alary H. 
Manning, letter), use this dye in their l)askets, the coloring matter 
])eing extracted In' boiling. In the case of the Hupas the dye is 
applied to Xeroph3dliun leaves, but the Klamaths use it only for the 
porcupine (piills which form the beautiful canary yellow patterns of 
their twisted tule baskets. The Tliidcit Indians of the south Alaskan 
coast also use the dye in their spruce-root baskets, the lichen T)eing 
secured by them not on the coast, ))ut fi'om the interior. (G. T. 
Emmons, notes.) (See Plate 5.) 

Fraxinus nigra. Black Ai^li. 

The remnants of the Six Nations in New York, Pennsylvania, and 
adjacent portions of Canada make extensive use of ash. presumat)ly 
black ash, in their modern splint-basket industry. (T. Donaldsori, 
1891.) 



206 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

Helianthus petiolaris. Sunflower. 

A-ka^-u-shi (Moki). 

The .seeds are used l\y the ^loki Indians of northern Arizona to make 
a blue dye for use in ])oth coiled and wiclier plaques. (W. Hough, 
notes.) The color produced in the coiled plaques, on sewing material 
of Y-ucca glaiica^ is of a dark, almost prussian-blue shade, when the 
sewing strands are applied with their broken inner surface outward, 
but of a much lighter shade when the epidermal surface is outward, 
(Cat. No. 128708, U.S.N.M.) 

Hicoria ovata. Hickory. 

The wood of some unidentified species of hickory, probabh^ Hicoria 
ovata, is emploj-ed among the remnants of the Six Nations in New 
York, Pennsjdvania, and adjacent portions of Canada in the manufac- 
ture of modern splint baskets. (T. Donaldson, 1894.) The inner bark 
of a hickory is used by the North Carolina Cherokees for yellow pat- 
terns in their baskets. (Cat. No. 03077, U.S.N.M.) 

Hilaria jamesii. Galleta. 

Ta^-ka-8hu (Moki). 

The stems of this grass, roughly stripped of leayos and seeds, are 
used for the filling in of the coiled plaques of the Moki Indians of 
northern xVrizona. (W. Hough, 1898.) In the first few turns of the 
spiral, which are too short to ])e made of the grass stems, the packing 
is of shredded leayes of Yncca (jlauva. (Cat. No. 128467, U.S.N.M.) 

Juglans nigra. Black Walnut. 

The Cherokee Indians of North Carolina use the split inner bark to 
make black patterns in their baskets. (Cat. No. 63077, U.S.N.M.) 

Juncus acutus. Ruah. 

The Coahuilla Indians of the Colorado Desert, southern California, 
use the stems to make patterns in their coiled basket bowls. The 
material, as gathered in a marsh at Palm Springs, is immersed for 
seyeral days in the nuiddy water of the spring to render it flexible, 
and is then dyed a dark oliyaceous or almost black color with the juice 
of a sea blite. (E. Palmer, notes.) (See Dondia xuffrutescens.) 

Juncus balticus. Rush. 

Tsin-a'-u (Klamath). 
Kloli-tso^-sic'> (Apache). 

The stems of this rush, which is commonly known as wire grass, 
are often used by Indian children to make small baskets. The prac- 
tice has been noted among the Klamaths of Oregon and the White 
Mountain Apaches of the Arizona plateau. 



ABORIGINAL AMEKIOAN liASKETKY. 21)7 

Juncus effusus. Hush.

Juncus textilis. liasket Mush. 

The Luisefio Indians of southern California nse the split stems of 
this i-ush as the sewing- uiaterial of their coiled baskets. (('. Hart Mer- 
riaui, notes.) The varying- natural colors of the stem at ditierent 
heio-hts produce a very attractive etl'ect. 

Liibocedrus decurrens. Post Ct'dai'.

Lonicera interrupta. Iloiu'ysuckie. 

Hai-wat' (Yuki). 

The long- flexible stems are used to a slight extent among the Round 
Valley Indians of California in the coiled ""one-stick" baskets, in 
which the foundation consists of a single stem. (V. K. Chesiuit, 1002, 
and notes.) 

Martynia louisiana. IVvil Ilnnis. 

Ta-s'at'-(-' (Apaclie). 

This plant, which is often known in books as th(> unicorn plant, has a 
large green pod with a slender terminal projection. At maturity the 
green outer layer becomes dry and falls off. the rcMnaining interior 
portion of the projection splitting into two parts or horns which arc 
exceedingly tough and black, and sometimes reach a length of 35 
centimeters (13 inches). Moistened and split they are used extensively 
to make black patterns in the baskets of vai'ious Indian tribes, notably 
the Apaches, in the desert region of ^Vrizona, southern Nevada, and 
southeast(U"n California. 

Panicularia nervata. Manna (irans. 

Among the Tlinkit Indians of the south Alaskan coast, strips s[)lit 
from the internodes of this grass are sometimes us(h1 as an <)\erlay for 
the patterns in spruce-root baskets, either white or varioush^ dyed. 
((t. T. Emmons, notes.) 

Parosela emoryi. Parosola. 

The Coahuilla Indians, of the Colorado Desert, in southeastern Cal-

Philadelplius gordonianus. 8yriiiy;a. 

Han^-li (Yuki). 

The pithj^ stems of this shrub, which is locally known as ari'owwood, 
are employed by the Indians of Mendocino Count3% California, in the 
manufacture of baskets for carr^dng- babies, a use to which the stems, 
on account of their lightness, are well adapted. (Y. K. Chesnut, 1902.) 

Phragmites phragmites. Reed. 

Tkap (Ivlainath). 

The white patterns in the twisted-tule baskets of the Klamath and 
Modoc Indians of Oregon are made from tSis reed. The part used is 
the shining- surface covering- of the stem, taken from less thrifty 
plants, particularl}^ those which have i)roduccd no flower cluster. 

Plate 6 is a twined gambling tray of the Klamath Indians living on 
the head waters of Klamath River, Oregon. The warp is of twined 
tule stems, the body of the weft is of the same material, the overlay- 
ing in white is with split pieces from the stem of the reed. The black 
is twisted tule dyed in mud springs, the yellow borders of the trefoil 
are in porcupine quills d3'ed with wolf moss. 

Design unknown; the projections on the large ornaments are called 
arrowheads. Collection of Frederick V. Coville. 

Picea sitchensis. Sitka Spruce. 

Sit (Tlinkit). 

The roots of this tree, ])oiled and split, are the basis material of the 
baskets manufactured by the Tlinkit Indians of Yakutat Bay, Alaska. 
(F. Funston, 1896.) The same use prevails among the Tlinkits of the 
Alexander Archipelago, notabl}^ those of Sitka, Juneau, and Douglas. 
The Indians of Neah Ba}^, Washington, and doubtless other tribes 
also, use the split roots for their coarse burden baskets. (See Plate T.) 

Pinus edulis. Aiizona Nut Pine. 

0-bi^ (Ajiache). 

The Apaches of the White Mountain district, Arizona, use the resin 
of this tree, often called pinyon, as a pitching material for their water 
baskets. 

Pinus lambertiana. Sugar Pine. 

Slender strands split from the root of the sugar pine, woven about 
uprights of California hazel, are the foundation material of the acorn- 
soup baskets of the Hupa Indians, northern California. To make 
them split more easily the roots are steamed by burying them in sand 
and building a tire over them. (Mary H. Manning, letter.) 

Pinus monophylla. Nevada Nut Pine. 

The l*ananiint Indians of southeastern California use the pitch of 
this tree to make their water baskets imp(>rvious to water. 



ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 209 

Pinus ponderosa. Y(>1 low Pino. 

The split wood of the root i.s one of the niatei-ials used l)v the Ilnpa 
Indians of northwestern California for tlu^ principal i)art of the weft 
in elosely-woven baskets. (P. PI Goddard. notes.) 

Pinus sabiniana. Di.iT^er Tine. 

Pol'-kumol (Yuki). 

The Little Lake Indians of Mendocino County, California, use the 
split roots to make their large V-shaped baskets for carrviny acorns. 
The root is warmed in hot damp ashes, and the strands are split ofi' 
before cooling. (V. K. Chesnut, l!H)2.) A similar use extends north- 
ward among the llu])a and other California coast Indians as far as 
Klamath River. (V. llavard, 1890.) '^ 

Populus trichocarpa. Balm of (lilead. 

In northwestern California the Hupa Indians sometimes used the 
root to fasten the ribs of their baskets at the beginning and to form a 
round at the base of the sides of the basket. (P. E. Goddard, notes.) 

Pseudotsuga mucronata. Ked Fir. 

According to the authorit}" of rJ. W. Hudson, the Porno Indians 
of Mendocino County, California, use the roots of this tree in the man- 
ufacture of some of their tine baskets. 

Pteridium aquilinuni. Bracken. 

Bis (CaliK'lla). 

A form of the connnon bracken occurring in the western United 
States is occasionally employed as a basket material among the Indians 
of Mendocino Comity, California. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.) The part 
used is the two Hat strips of black hard-celled tissue in the rootstock. 

ftuercus alba. White Oak. 

Splints from the wood of a white oak, presrima])ly this speeies, are 
still used by the Cherokee Indians of North Carolina as the material 
for certain of their baskets. (Cat. No. 63073, U.S.N.M.) 

QiUercus lobata. ('aiifornia Wiiite Oak. 

The Concow Indians of Mendocino County, California, sometimes 
blacken their basket strands of redl)ud {CercU occidental is) on which 
the bark is still attached, by soaking them in water containing the bark 
of this oak and scraps of rusty iron. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.) 

Rhus diversiloba. Poison ( )ak. 

KatsMe (Wailaki). 
Mii-tyu^-ya'''-ho (Pomo). 

The slender stems are occasionally used for horizontal withes in 
some of the baskets of the Mendocino County Indians of California

(V. K. Chesnut, 1902), while the juice, which turns black rapidl}^ on 
exposure to air, is the source, according to J. ^V. Hudson, of a 
d}' e sometimes used to stain the purest black strands of the Pomo 
basketry . 

Rlius trilobata. Threeleaf Sumac. 

SF-i-bi (Moki). 
Chn-chin (Navaho). 
Tseh^ kan^-i (Apache). 

Among the desert Indians the slender branches of this bush are 
used extensively, perhaps more extensively than an}^ other plant 
except willow, in the manufacture of their baskets. For warp the 
peeled branches are used. , For weft and for the sewing material of 
coiled baskets the branch is usually split into three strips and the bark 
and brittle tissue next the pith removed, leaving a flat tough strand. 
The use of the threeleaf sumac has been noted among the Apache, 
Panamint, Paiute, Navaho (W. Matthews, 1886), Moki (W. Hough, 
1898), and Coahuilla (D. P. Barrows, 1900). (See Plate 8.) 

Salix. Willow. 

Brancnes from various undetermined species of Avillow were widely 
used among the western Indians, probably more generally than any 
other plant, particularly in the various forms of coarsen* baskets. 
Among the tribes in which travelers have recorded the manufacture 
of willow baskets, in addition to those given below under the identified 
species of willow, are the Mission, Mohave, Coahuilla, Cocopa, Yuma, 
and Coconino Indians of Arizona and southern California; the Zuni 
of New Mexico; the Hupa, Yurok, Modoc, Chimariko, Gualala, Nishi- 
nam, and Yokut of northern and middle California, and the Tinne 
of the Yukon Valley, Alaska. The split roots of willow are sometimes 
used for the weft in beginning the hat baskets of the Hupa Indians. 
(P. E. Goddard, notes.) 

Salix argophylla. Willow. 

Bam ka-le^ (Pomo). 

The Pomo Indians near Ukiah, California, consider this their best 
willow for the manufacture of coarse baskets. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.) 

Salix lasiandra. . Willow. 

A willow, which is referable to Salix lasiandra in its broad sense, is 
used to some extent by the Panamint Indians of Inyo County, Cali- 
fornia, in their twined 1)askets, and by the Apaches of the White 
Mountain Reservation, Arizona. 

Sambucus mexicana. Elder. 

The Coahuilla Indians of San Diego County, California, give a deep 
black color to strands of the threeleaf sumac, used as a sewing mate-

rial of their coiled baskets, by soaking- them for about a week in an 
infusion of the berry stems of this elder. (D. 1\ Barrows, 1900.) 

Savastana odorata. HolyjjrasH. 

The Indians of the northeastern United States and adjacent parts of 
Canada, such as the Penobscots of Maine (V. Havard, 181)0) and the 
Abenakis of Ontario (Cat. No. 206394, U.S.N.M.), use the long-, sweet- 
scented leaves of this g-rass in some of their baskets. 

Scirpus lacustris. Tule. 

Ma^-i (Klamath). 

The principal basket material of the Klamath and ]\Iodoc Indians of 
Oregon is the tule, a plant Avidely used by the tribes of the Pacitic 
coast States in the manufacture of mats. Narrow strips from the 
surface of the stem are twisted into long threads and these used for 
their tiner twined l)askets, giving a great variety of green and l^rown 
shades or, when dyed, a black. For coarser l)askets whole or split 
stems are conmionly employed, without twisting. The very slender 
roots of the tule, which occur in great abundance on the stout root- 
stocks, are used, without any other preparation than drj^ing, to make 
patterns of a maroon color in the twisted tule baskets. (See Plate 9.) 

.3cirpus niaritimus. Bulrush. 

Tsu-ish^ (Porno). 

The Pomo Indians of California use for the brown and black patterns 
of their line coiled baskets a tiber extracted from the rootstock of 
this bulrush. Structural!}^ the fiber is the same as that described 
under Oarex iarbarae. The identitication is by Miss Alice Eastwood. 

Smilax californica. Greenbriar. 

TJie long and exceedingly strong stems, Ijrought from the watershed 
of the Sacramento River, are sometimes employed by the Indians of 
Mendocino County, California, in their basketry. (V. K. Chesnut, 
1902.) 

Thelesperma gracile. Thelesperma. 

0-haMi-shi (Moki). 

A decoction of the whole plant was formerly used to give a red- 
l)rown color to the stems of Y'Ah\At}n-nsh {0/rri/sot/iam.m/s ?no(2uia7iiis) 
for the patterns in the wicker plaques of the Moki Indians of northern 
Arizona. (W. Hough, 1898; Cat. No. 128708, U.S.N.M.) 

Thuja plicata. Giant Cedar. 

The split roots of this tree are the common sewing material for the 
strong, water tight huckleberry baskets of certain tribes of the North- 
west Coast from northern Oregon to British America, including the 



212 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

Klikitat, Cowlitz, Puviilliip, Tulalip, Snoqualmie, Skagit, and Fraser 
River Indians. The Indians of Neah Ba^^, Washington, and of Van- 
couver Island, British Columbia, use the split brown inner bark as the 
warp of their finely woven but artificiall}^ d3'ed flexible baskets. The 
Nisqualli Indians of Fuget Sound, and doubtless man}' other tril)es of 
the Northwest coast, employ the same material in coarser strands in 
making rough burden ])askets, frequently in conjunction with a warp 
of split l)ranch('s from the same tree. (See Flate 10.) 

Tsiig-a inertensiana. Black Hemlock. 

The Indians of Neah Ba}', Washington, sometimes use split hemlock 
roots in their coarse openwork quadrangular V-shaped burden baskets. 
The tree was described ])y a Neah Bay Indian as having cones 2^ inches 
long, in which case the species would be the black hemlock instead of 
the Western hemlock {Tsuga heterophylla), which is the commoner 
of the two at low elevations in that vicinity. 

Tumion californicum. California Nutmeg. 

K'oM)i (Poino). 

The split roots of this tree are sometimes used by the Fomo Indians 
of Mendocino County, California, in the manufacture of their finer 
baskets. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.) 

Typha latifolia. Cattail. 

Po^-pas (Klamath). 

Twisted strands made of slender ribbons split from the sheathed 
portions of the leaves are used by the Klamath Indians of Oregon in 
their smaller flexible baskets, either to form the body of the basket or 
to make an ornamental band. The color is a lusterless, slightly ashy 
white. 

Ulmus americana. Elm. 

The Sioux Indians of the northern plains region used the inner bark 
of the elm to make a coarse basket. (V. Havard, 1890.) 

Vaccinium inembranaceum. Elueberry. 

Ka-na-ta' (Tlinkit). 

The juice of some species of blueberi'y, prol)ably Yacciniurn mein- 
hranaceum^ is used as a purple dye in spruce-root baskets b}^ the Tlinkit 
Indians of the south Alaskan coast, ((i. T. Emmons, notes.) 

Vitis californica. Grape. 

Shi-Tii^ (Pomo). 

Among the Hupa Indians of northern California the root is some- 
times used to fasten the ribs of a basket at its ])egimiing, and to make 
a round at the outer edge of the basket's bottom, while in fine hats

Woodwardia spinulosa. < iiaiit, (Uiaiii ]''ctii. 

The llupa Indians of northern California use a portion of this fern, 
either white or dyed orange hrown with alder l)ark, in the pattei'ns of 
their hat l)askets. (Mary H. Maiming, letter). Tlie parts employed 
are two slender Hat strands, very flexible and leatliery when moist, 
which arc extracted from the stalk of the frond. 

Xerophyllum tenax. Xctnpliylluiii. 

The long, tough, minutely serrated, grass-like, lustrous leaves of this 
plant, often called squawgrass, are very commonly used l)y the Indians 
of the Northwest Coast as an overlaying material to make the white 
patterns of their baskets. Occasionally it is dyed. The base of the 
leaf for an inch or more often has a natural faint purple color which 
is used to gO(jd efl'ect. The use of the material extends from the Pit 
River, Shasta, and Hupa Indians, in northern California, northward 
through most of the tribes west of the Cascade Range to the Neah 
Bay and Vancouver Island Indians of the Straits of Fuca. These last 
two use Xerophyllum leaves, cut to a uniform width by a gauged 
knife-edge, as the weft of their gaudily dyed flexible baskets. 

Yucca arborescens. Tree Yucca. 

The slender roots are sometimes used for red tigures in bask(>ts of 
the I^mamint Indians of Inyo Coimty, California. 

Yucca arkansana. Yucca. 

The leaves are used in the basketr}^ of the Kaiowa Indians of ( )kla- 
homa. (J. Moone}^, notes.) 

Yucca baccata. Banana Yucca. 

The Mescalero Apaches of southern New Mexico and adjacent parts 
)f Texas, in the region between the Rio Grande and Pecos rivers, use 
the split leaves of this plant for the main portion of their baskets, and 
its roots for the led patterns (Cat. Nos. 204646 to 204653, U.S.N. M.). 
It is probable, I am informed by Mr. Vernon Bailey, that they use 
also in the same way the leaves and roots of Yucca inac/'ocarjMr, an 
arborescent species growing at lower elevations in the same region. 



214 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

Yucca filamentosa. Silkgrass. 

The leaves of this plant were formerh" in use among the Indians of 
North Carolina as a Vjasket material. (J. Lawton, 1714.) 

Yucca glauca. Plains Yucca. 

Mo^-hu (Moki). 

This plant is used in the basketry of the Moki Indians (W. Hough, 
1902) of northern Arizona. In some of the coarser twilled baskets 
the warp and weft are made up of the narrow unsplit leaves thinned 
by the removal of a strip from the back. (('at. No. 213254, U.S.N.M.) 
In the coiled plaques the sewing material consists of narrow strips split 
from the leaves. The outer surface of the leaves gives various shades 
of green and greenish yellow or, in the case of the young leaves, 
white, or they are dyed in several colors. The d3^ed strips are often 
applied with the inner, broken surface outward. This surface takes 
the dye more readily and gi\es a deeper shade. For the use of the 
shredded leaves as a packing material in the first few turns of the 
spiral, see Ililaria jcmieml. 

III. BASKET MAKING 

The sallow knows the basket maker's thumb. — EMERSON. 

Under the head of basket making are included all the activities 
involved in and fostered by construction, namely: 

1. Harvesting 'materials. — This embraces intimate acquaintance with 
the places where just the right substances abound, knowledge of the 
times when each element is ripe, methods of growing, harvesting, 
and conveying involved, as well as the tools and apparatus used in 
gathering. In their rough state much of the materials would be as 
unfit for the use as quarry clay would be for the potter or crude ore 
for the metallurgist. 

2. Preparing materials. — Frequenth' the raw materials ar«^ stored 
away at the time of harvesting until rc(piired for maiuifacturo. Nature 
makes the rules for gathering in her own good time. But this might 
be the busy season, whereas this art may go on in difi'erent seasons. 
When the time comes for their use special manipulations are neces- 
sary, such as peeling, splitting, making splints, yarning or twisting, 
twining, braiding, soaking, gauging, coloring. These should each be 
noted carefulh' and described for the several basket areas. 

3. Processes of 'manufacture. — The materials Ijcing ready, the maker 
seats herself in the midst and begins the technical operations that 
should be minutel}' watched, and photographed, if possible. Collec- 
tions should also be made of tools, apparatus, and patterns. 

Each of these will be examined with minute care, especially the 
third. If this art is to be imitated and become a stimulus in technical 



ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY.

iiistructioii it is of the utmost iniportanco that the suhstaucos he cor- 
rectly known, tiiat the manipulations of material he familiar, and, 
ahoN'e all, that the coursi» of each element in the war}) and weft, the 
foundation, and sewing- he imderstood. Care has hccn taken to draw 
correctly the tigures us(^d in illustration. They are all in the huskctry 
of the Indians, and, more than that, they ar(^ the bey-inniniis of more 
retinetl processes and structures. 



HARVESTING MATERIALS 

Since the materials used in l)asketry are derived from different })arts 
of a great variety of plants, the gatherine- of them involves many 
industries. The harvesting of hasket material is no exception to the 
rule that ever}- human activity begins with a natural process slighth^ 
modified. The hirds are in a sense the original basket makers, and it 
is known that some very expert Indian tribes take the grasses and the 
stems of plants as they find them. They know nothing of drying or

manipulating. Improvement grows out of study into the nature of 
suhstanees, until with some tribes the obtaining of raw materials 
involves quite as much sagacity, toil, and travel as the making of the 
basket. 

For procuring the roots, the apparatus of digging is necessaiy. 
To be sure, the hand was the first hoe and the strong arm draws the 
root from its hiding place, but our Indians had gotten bej^ond that. 
The northern Indians, especially those of the Columbia River in west- 
ern Canada, use quite elaborate forms of this device. It is wonderful 
to think of the sagacity developed in savage minds by the quest for 
underground substances and the proper discrimination of the places 



216 REPORT OF NATIONAL MTTSEUM, 1902. 

where the best examples abound. From tlie farthest north, in the 
neighborhood of Point Barrow to the southern portions of South 
America, roots form sul)stantial materials in basket making-, l)oth 
twined and coiled. It is not enough to say simply that roots of plants 
were the materials of the baskets, but it is well known that the savage 
women knew in each section what plant furnished the toughest and 
most pliable roots, the localities in which this kind of root reached 
its best, the plants that jaelded l)rown, i-ed, and black colored splints, 
which produced unrivaled effects, though the portion above ground 
gave no sign of the treasures held or the time of 3"ear when it was 
proper to ol)tain these substances, and the processes by which they 
could 1)6 extracted and saved most economicall}^. Incidentally to this 
quest of material, of course, was that of carr3dng, so that here in the 
very beginning of our art a host of useful human activities are 
engendered. The Klamath invented a peculiar kind of mud shoe 
to wear when wading about in shallow marshes after roots for their 
basket work. (See tig. 1.) 

The stems of plants, of grass, rushes, and woody species are to be 
found in the basketr}^ of almost everj^ portion of the Western Hemi- 
sphere. The young and tough shoots of a single year's growth are 
choice materials for some purposes, and were eagerly" sought. In those 
regions where spinous plants 3ielded the materials, a sort of gathering 
knife was employed resembling a miniature sickle with a wooden handle. 
There is a time of yeav when they are in the best condition for the 
basket woman's craft. There are certain parts of the stems which are 
useful in this direction, while others are valueless. In wood}^ species 
the outer hu'er next to the bark has the toughness of leather, while a 
littl(> Avay inward the Avood is almost as brittle as glass. Furthermore, 
th(^ stems of plants vary greatly in color — different parts of the same 
stem are in different colors. 

Now, the student would be surprised to find in the East, in the West, 
in the North, and in the South that there is very little more for the 
savage woman to learn. Distinguished botanists will say that instead 
of trying to teach the Indians the use of new plants, the best wa}" to 
search for uqw materials to introduce into modern textile arts can l)e 
learned from these savage artisans. The leaves of plants are used in 
basketry, especialh' in the South. In the extreme North, among the 
Eskimo and Athapascan tri])es, no leaves are suitable for basketry. 
Among the Aleutian Islanders stems and leaves of grass come into 
play. Down the Pacific coast of the continent, in southeastern Alaska, 
British C'oluml)ia, and the coast States of the Union leaves, either in 
their natural color or dA'ed, are employed Avith great effect in many 
types of ornamentation, as will be seen further on. The range of use- 
fulness, either for texture or ornament, is well known to the basket 
maker. In Mexico and tropical America this division of the subject

time substances. 

PRKPARIN( i MATERIA J.S 

As is W(dl known, e\'ery industr\- may be divided, eithei- in saxau'ery 
or in <'ivilization. into four parts: First, that which is associated with 
takino- the oifts of nature, called in this particular instanc(> harvivstinu-; 
second, the transformation of this material into })roper form for special 
ti-ades: third, the mamifactiire of useful and ornamental objects; and. 
tinall}'. the activities of consumption and enjovment, by which th(> 
thing-.s may take their places as servants to supply the wants and 
desires of mankind. 

The preparation of materials for basketry consists in splittino- and 
separating- the desirable from the undesiralile portions; in removing 
the bark; in taking the soft and spongy mattcM' from the fibrous por- 
tion, like soaking- and hackling- in Hax; in making ribt>on-like splints 
of uniform width and thickness; in shredding, as in cedai- bark; in 
twisting, twining, and braiding; in gauging, and coloring. 

The apparatus for this intermediate work must have l)een in abo- 
riginal times very simple, a stone knife and shell for scraping supple- 
menting the work of the lingers and the teeth. The <piality of the 
finished workmanship depends largel}" upon this secondary process. 
In those regions of very uniform moisture the plants used were of 
quick growth and pliable, and it would be easy, even without metal 
tools, to secure fine splints and other elements in tlie maiuifacture; 
but in those localities where the raw substances were more brittle, 
fine work would be difficult and indeed was impossible until tpiite 
recently. It is a question, therefore, wdiether anciently some of the 
modern processes in basketry were known at all. Certaiidy there was 
no sucli delicate basketry made in Canada by the imtaught al)origines 
as can now be procured from tluur descendants; but in the old graves 
of Califoi'nia and the adjoining areas wonderful piec(\s of delicate 
workmanshi}) are brought from ancient pre-Columbian t<)ml)>. 

It nuist not be forgotten that coloring matters wer<> in ancient times 
among the prepared materials of basketry. Nature furnishes oppor- 
tunities for diversity of color in the substances themselves. The Indian 
also knew how to change or modify the natural color of difiierent 
materials by burying- them in mud. The juices of the plants and the 
mineral substances in the nuid combined to produce darker shades of 



218 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

the same color or an entirely different one. But tlie savage woman 
had gone further, for they well knew that certain plants were useful 
as d3'es. In point of fact, the l)est dycstuff's of each area had been 
exhaustiyely exploited. A list of these for each area would include a 
large number of useful plants. As in gathering materials the simplest 
processes involye slight artiticialit}', so in this intermediar}' art the 
most primitiye basket makers modified little their raw materials. They 
did not store them away for the conyenient season, and, saye that they 
soaked them before using, practiced none of the refining processes 
necessary to the highest results. 

In each of the culture areas of America the methods of preparing 
materials were peculiar. 

Dr. Walter J. Hoffman " described in 1895 the aboriginal process of 
preparing material for wicker baskets among the Menomini Indians 
(Algonquin Family) on Lake Michigan. See figures 110 to 111 of this 
paper. 

A small log of wood, 3 or 4 inches in diameter and as long as it is 
possible to procure one without knots, furnishes the splints. (Hoff- 
man's fig. 37.) These logs are cut when the rings of annual growth 
are most easily ruptured. The log is beaten with a wooden mallet. 
The example shown in Hoffman's illustration (fig. 3S) is of modern 
tjj'pe, made with steel tools, but the ancient Indian, no doubt, had a 
much rougher ])ut c[uite as efficient implement. The strips thus loos- 
ened are torn off' one by one as long as the material is sufficiently flex- 
ible for basket making. The next process is the shaping of these 
splints for the desired work — splitting them, shaying them down thin 
and smooth, and finishing them for the hand of the weayer. 

The basket-maker's awl of bone, the old aboriginal implement, may 
be seen at work in many camps; but the knife with which the pre- 
Columbian woman cut her basket material has utterh^ disappeared 
from use. Now, among the Algonkin, the knife of steel yastly 
improved their art and it raises a question whether in the pristine 
condition of savagery some forms of basketr}" were as good as they 
are at present. This query applies only to work done in hard wood. 

The knife now in use among the Indians for this and other wood- 
working purposes is an interesting survival from- the remote past in 
Europe. It is now active in the farrier's shop for paring the frog of 
the horse's foot, prior to putting on the shoe; but two or three centu- 
ries ago, under name of man's knife,^ it found its way through the 
entire English and French area of North America. 

A curved blade of steel is inserted or laid in a groove on the side of

Pacitic Ocean, the Ainos, Japanese, etc. (Hotl'mairs hg. iV.K)

ferent widths ready for the hand of the basket maker, and in tig. -ii

up the war}) and applying the weft in wicker basketry of the Menonuni. 

It is not known that the ancient Menomini usckI any dyes on their 
baskets whtitevei-. In their modern ware the}' procure these sul)staiices 
through traders. 

The sW'Cet grass (Savasfdna odorata)^ of which large quantities of 
baskets are manufactured, was dried in the shade to hold its color. 
Further, it was rolled into bunches and sewed with sinew, as the 
Eskimo do in making their coiled baskets. Very old specimens of 
such w'are are preserved in collections. But in the ware now in the 
market twine and braid of this material are prepared beforehand in 
larg-e quantities for the future use of the weaver and frequentl}' by 
ditierent hands. 

Farther south in the Eastern l)asket area the canes for twilled bas- 
ketry needed no knife for the splitting. A slight blow would crush the 
stalk, the spongy matter adhering to the inside was scraped away, and 
the splints were ready for the dyer or the weaver if the}' wore not to 
be colored. 

The following information concerning natural sources of color for 
basketry and other objects among the Cherokee Indians comes from 
Miss Harriet C. Wilkie, of Raleigh, North Carolina. The petals of 
the iris rubbed on a slightly rough surface are said to yield a rich 
and lasting purple. The blossoms and tender green tops and leaves of 
the common sneeze weed {Ilelenium aatumnale) made into a tea yield 
a beautiful and fadeless yellow. Long boiling dulls this to a yellowish 
olive. The common broom sedge {Andrajjogoti sccqMrlus)^ winter 
dried, yields another yellow, less pure and brilliant, also much allected 
by continued boiling. The color is known as ])urnt orange and works 
beautifully in basketry. 

In central Alaska the Athapascan tribes use both spruce and willow 
for their coiled basket jai's and trinket material. Much care is bestowed 
in splitting the roots and stems, in order to procure uniform sewing- 
material. In the U. S. National Museum the specimens all show care 
in this regard. The Alaskan Eskimo on Bering- Sea also manufacture 
coiled basketry as well as twined, but it is from dried grass and sho\vs 
very little care in the preparation. Crossing over to the Aleutian

When Attn weavers wanted the grass to be white it was cut in 
November, the whole stalk (wild rye), and hung points down out oi' 
doors to dry. It" grass was to be yellow, the common color, it is cut 
in the middle of July, and the two youngest blades that are full grown 
are then cut out and split into three pieces, the middle one being 
thrown away. The other pieces are then tied into bunches about '1 
inches in diameter and hung up to dry out of doors (points down). If 
the grass is to be cured green it is prepared as when it is wanted to 
be yellow, but the tirst two weeks of the curing is carried on in the 
shade of the dense growth of grass and weeds that is found in the 
villages. After that it is taken out and dried in the house. Under no 
circumstances is the sun allowed to shine on any of the grass in the 
process of curing, which takes about a month or more. 

Beautiful coiled basketry is made by the Chilcotin, Harrison Lake, 
Lower Thompson Indians in British Columbia, Salish on the coast, 
as well as Klikitat and Tulalip in Washington. Onl}^ women and girls 
occupy themselves with this work. The baskets are made from the 
small, trailing roots of the cedar {Thuja 2)1 icata). These are dug up 
with an ordinary root digger, and pieces of the desired length and of 
about the thickness of a finger are cut off. These are buried in the 
ground to keep them fresh. When recjuired they are taken out and 
peeled or scraped with a sharp stone or knife. They are then hung 
up until dr}" enough for use. Next the}' are split into long strips by 
inserting and pressing forward the point of the awl used in basket 
making, made from the long bone of a deer. The pieces which have 
the desired width and thickness throughout their entire length are 
used for stitching purposes, while others which split irregularly, or 
are too short or too thin to be used for that purpose, are put together 
in bundles to form the foundation of the coils. In the sewing these 
foundations are kept continuous and of uniform thickness bv adding 
fresh pieces as required. (See Plate 11,) 

In other basketry, thin, pliable strips of cedar sap or other wood in 
pairs, having both smooth sides out, are used for foundation instead 
of the bunches of split roots. These are stitched in the same manner, 
but are neither as strong nor as durable nor are the}" water-tight," 

The Upper Eraser and the Lytton bands sometimes use Elymus 
triticoides instead of Xeropliyllmti. The bark used is that of Primus 
demism., which is either left its natural light reddish-brown color or 
is dyed b}^ burying it in damj:) earth, B}- thus keeping it under 
ground for a short time it assumes a dark-brown color; if kept longer 
it becomes quite black, (Teit,) 

The Makah Indians make a red color by mixing vermilion with 
chewed salmon eggs; black color is a combination of bituminous coal

and the same carrier; cedar bark is colored l)l;ick hy soakino- in nnid, 
and red by means of alder bark chewed. (Swan.) 

The Twana Indians, on Skokomish lleservation, Washinuton, now 
nse a steel-bladed knife and an aAvl of the same material in basket 
making-. Formerly they employed a pointed stick or ])one for their 
imbricated ware and for pressing home the weft of twined baskc^try; 
bnt in large measnre their lingers are theii- tools. (]\Iyron p](dls.) 
The same remark applies to basket makers in all the culture areas. 
Fingers and teeth are still in vogue and can not be dispensed with. 
The metal awl, however, quite displaces that of l)one, and it is not 
surprising to find scissors of the ])est make added to the steei-l)laded 
knife, especially for clipping oti' the projecting- ends of materials. 

Hazel stalks are gathered l)v Oregon tril)es in best form on ground 
that has been burned over, the young ones springing up straight and 
strong from the rich soil. The peeled stems are the warp, those split 
by means of the teeth are the weft, and a d3'e is made from the bark 
chewed b}^ the l)asket maker. (Mrs. Harriet K. McArthur.) The line 
white grass, like ivory in smoothness and tint, is o])tained at great 
elevations, their excursions leading them to the sunnuer snow line of 
Moifnt Shasta. 

PROCESSES OF IMAXUFACTITRE 

As you gaze on the Indian basket maker at work, herself frecjuentl}^ 
unkempt, her garments the coarsest, her house and surroundings sug- 
gestive of anything- but ])eauty, you are amazed. You look about 
you, as in a cabinet shop or atelier, for models, drawings, patterns, 
pretty bits of color elfect. There are none. H(>r patterns are in her 
soul, in her memory and imagination, in the mountains, water courses, 
lakes, and forests, and in those tribal tales and myths which dominate 
the actions of every hour. She hears suggestions from another world. 
Her tools are more disappointing still, for of these there are few — a 
rude knife, a pointed bone, that is all. Her modeling block is herself. 
Her plastic body is the repository of forms. Over her knee she molds 
depressions in her ware, and her lap is equal to all emergencies for 
convex effects. She herself is the Vishnu of luu- art, the creator of 
forms. 

The Tlinkit in weaving, saj-s Emmons, sits with the knees drawn up 
to the chin, the feet close to the body, the shoulders bent over, the 
jirms around the knees, the hands in front. Sometimes one knee is 
dropped a little to the side, and, in the cas(^ of old women, they often 
recline on one hip, with the legs drawn up, the elbows resting on a 
pillow or l)lanket doubled up. 

In all t3^pes of weave the working strands are constantly dampened 
by dipping the fingers into a basket or cup of water close at hand, or, 
in the case of embroidery, 1)v drawing the section of grass stem 



222 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1!X)2. 

through the lips. The material is kept in a plaquc-likc work hasket 
called tarlth (".spread out," from its flat bottom and low, flaring 
sides). Besides the shell or metal knife there is generally a rude awl, 
consisting- of a spike of goat or deer horn, a bear's claw, or a piece of 
bone rubbed down to a tapering point, and a large incisor of the brown 
bear or the tooth of the killer whale. These constitute all of the tools 
and accessories used in basketry. (Emmons.) 

Plate 12 represents a Porno Indian basketmaker. In front of her 
is an unfinished water-tight l)asket jai- in plain twined weaving. The 
warp elements are willow rods dressed down to uniform thickness; 
the weft is of carex root and cercis stems split, the patterns being 
made in the latter. Photographed by H. W. Henshaw. 

Plate 13 represents a Tlinkit woman of Sitka, Alaska, making a 
twined basket. All the native surroundings are absent — the environ- 
ment, as men are wont to say — but the artist's mind and skillful 
fingers remain. She has four elements to handle simultaneousl}^ — 
warp, two wefts, and decorative material. The mouth, therefore, is 
brought into requisition, as may be seen. The operation consists in 
twining with finely diAdded spruce root and wrapping each outside 
splint with colored straw. The work resembles embroidery IVhen 
finished and is, -in this work, called false eml)roidery. 

There seems to be always an affectionate fellow feeling between the 
skillful hand of the artisan and the materials which it fashions. The 
more tractable the latter, the more deft the former. That is not 
always true in culture. The best endowment does not alwa3^s Afield 
the best results. But the statement holds good in our art with few 
exceptions. Where the finest grasses grow, and the toughest roots 
and stems, they set up a school of mutual refinement between the 
woman and her work. It needs only a few miles eastward or north- 
ward to change the garden into a desert and correspondingly to degen- 
erate the artist. It would be unjust to her ingenious mind to over- 
look the fact that she has not been utterly cast down by the failure of 
one kind of material. She is not long in finding out new substances 
and new technic processes for each environment. 

WOVEN BASKETRY 

The various processes of manufacture will now be definitely 
explained. In technic, as already said (p. IIH)), basketr}" is either hand- 
woven or sewed. The hand-woven basketiy is further divisible into 
(A) Chech' nrofl^ (B) TvuUedirorl'^ (C) Wlch'nr<>)'l\ (D) W7'aj)pedioorl- , 
and (E) Tvrhiedirorl'., in several varieties. The sewed work goes by 
the name of coiled l)asketrv, and is classed both by the foundation and 
the fastening. In addition to these technical methods on the body, 
special ones are to be found in the ])order.

A. Checl'eru'orl: — This occurs especially in the liottoms of many 
North Pacific coast examples, and also in the work of eastern Canaclian 
tribes (fig. 2); in matting its use is well nigh universal. 

In this ware the warp and the weft have the same thickness and 
pliability. It is impossible, therefore, in looking at the ))ottoms of 
the cedar-bark 1)askets and the matting of British Columbia (fig. ?>) or 
Eastern Canada to tell which is warp 
and which is weft. In very many exam- 
ples the warp and weft of a checker 
bottom are turned up at right angles t(^ 
form the warp of the sides, which may 
be wicker or twined work. A great 
deal of bark matting is made in this 
same checkerwork, but the patterns run 
obliquely to the axis of the fabric, giv- 
ing the appearance of diagonal weaving. 
The fine hats of Ecuador are especially 
noticeable in this deceptive appearance, 
which is caused by the weaver\s begin- 
ning the work at the center. Perhaps, 
though there is no positive information on this sul)ject, the North 
Pacific coast women proceed in the same manner to give a tiled efl'ect 
to the surface of their matting. When warp and weft are fine yarn 

or threads the result is the 
simplest form of cloth in 
cotton, linen, pifia fil)er, 
or wool. The cheap fa))- 
rics of conunerce are of 
this species of weaving. 
In art and industry lattice- 
work frequently shows 
the bars intertwined as in 
checker basketry (fig. 4). 
From this results a most 
stable figure, the elasticit}'' 
of the material and the 
friction of the surfaces 
holding the fabric to- 
gether. (See figs, tt, 5, 6.) 
The pleasing eflects 
that niay be produced in 
checker are shown in Plate 14. At tlu^ ])ottom is coarse work. At 
the end of seven rows the warp strips of })ark are held firmly in place 
by a row of twined weaving and then split into four, each sixth one

tion will he called to the variet}" in this mass of unity b}' the individual 
characteristics of each square in the weaving. 

B. TwUJedwork. — This is seen espe- 
cially in those parts of the world where 
cane abounds. In America it is quite 
common in British Columbia, Washington, 
Southern United States, Mexico, and Cen- 
tral America, and of excellent workman- 
ship in Peru, Guiana, and Ecuador. The 
fundamental techuic of diagonal basketry 
is in passing each element of the weft 
over two or more warp elements, thus 
producing either diagonal or twilled, or, 
in the best samples, an endless variety of 
diaper patterns. (See figs. 5 and 0.) 
The example shown in Plate 15 represents a cigar case made b}' the 
women of Bolivia, who weave the celebrated Panama hats, the texture 
being fine twilled work. The ornamentation should be studied care- 
fully, for it consists of twined weaving, in which ]>oth warp and weft 
strands are brought together in pairs and one twined about the other.

parallel to each other, across the face of the cloth. In Manket twill 
every third thread is crossed. In some fabrics -t, 5, 6, 7, or 8 threads 
are crossed. In fall satin twill there is an interval of 15 threads, the 
warp {(yrganzine slllv) being floated over 15 threads of the woof {tram), 
giving the glossy appearance. 

Twills require heddles equal in number to the threads that are 
included in the intervals between the intersections. This disposition 
of the warps in the heddles is termed mounting the loom, and the

heddles are termed leaves. A twill takes its name from the number 
of leaves employed, as a three-leaf twill, a five-leaf twill, etc. 

Twills are used for the display of color, for strength, variety, thick- 
ness, or durability. 

On a fragment of ancient pottery from Alabama, Holmes also 
discovered marks of l)asketr3' in twilled weaving, as shown in 

It will be noticed that material of cat-tail or split cane was used. 
The efl'ect shown in the tigure was produced by passing each weft 
strand over three warp strands and under one on the side exhibited. 
On the other side of the texture, no doubt, the process was reversed, 



ABOKiaiNAL AMEKICAN 15ASKETRY. 227 

the warp strands passing over three and under one. In such work 
there was opportunity to use double warp and weft, the strips of eane 
hiid together so as to expose two bright surfaces. 

In order to var}- the texture of twilled work, the ancient inhabitants 
of the Mississippi Valley knew how to use for war[) and weft sub- 
stances of different widths. On a fragment of ancient potter}^ from 
Pope Count}', Tennessee, Holmes found impressions of ancient basketry. 
Fig. 8 shows how these ancient weavers utilized wide fiber of bast or 
split cane for the warp, and string for the weft, j)assing in their work 
over two each time. For the uses of woven fabrics on making pottery

and the interesting way in which the history of lost arts hav^e })een 
preserved, see Part Vll. 

Excellent variety was also produced in this kind of weaving by 
means of color. Almost any textile plant when si)lit has two coloi's, 
that of the outer, or bark surface, and that of the interior woody 
surface or pith. Also the different plants used in diagonal l)asketry 
have great variety of color. By the skillful manipulation of the two 
sides of a splint, by using plants of different species, or with dyed 
elements, geometric patterns, frets, labyrinths, and other designs in 
straight line are possible. (See fig. 9.)

Examples from the saltpeter caves, and modern pieces from the 
Cherokee, both in matting and basketr}", are double. B3" this means 
both the inside and the outside of the texture expose the glossy 
siliceous surface of the cane. By changing the number of warp splints 
or a stem over which the weft passes, it will be seen in the figure here 
given that great variety of diaper or damask effect ma}^ be produced. 
C. Wicherwm'k. — The name is from the Anglo-Saxon wlcan^ to bend. 
Common in eastern Canada, it is little known on the Pacific coast and 
in the Interior Basin, excepting in one or two pueblos, but is seen 
abundantly in southern Mexico and Central America. It consists of 
a wide or a thick and inflexible warp and a slender flexible weft (fig. 
10). The weaving is plain and differs from checkerwork only in the 
fact that one of the elements is rigid. The effect on the surface is a 
series of ridges. It is possible also to produce diagonal effects in this 
type of weaving. 

Wickerwork must have been a very early and primitive form of 
textile. Weirs for stopping fish are made of brush, and wattled 

fences for game drivers are set up 
in the same manner. A great deal 
of the coarse basketry in use for 
packing and transporting is made in 
this fashion. The Zuni Indians 
make gathering baskets of little 
twigs after the same technic, the 
inflexi])le warp being made up of a 
small number of twigs of the same 
plant, laid side by side. The transi- 
tion from checker to wicker in some 
examples is easy. The moment one 
element, either warp or weft, is a 
little more rigid than the other, the 
intersections would naturall}^ assume 
a wicker form. 

The finest specimens in America are the ver}^ pretty Hopi plaques 
made of Ch7'i/sotha7nnus inoqidanus and C. laricinus. Short stems are 
dyed in various colors for weft, the ends worked into the warp and 
the whole driven tightly home, so as to hide the ends of the warp and 
even the manner of weaving. (See fig. 11.) 

Various patterns are effected on the surface — geometric figures, 
clouds, mythical animals and persons, and symbols connected with 
worship. Wickerwork has pleasing effects combined with diagonal 
and other work. Fig. 12 is a square Hopi plaque, having twilled 
weaving in the middle and a band of wicker outside of this, the whole 
finished with rough, coiled sewing on the border. 

It has passed into modern industr}^ through the cultivation of osiers, 
rattan, and such plants for market baskets, covers for glass bottles,

and in ril)bod cloth, wherein a flexibh^ weft is worked on a rig-id warp. 
Also, good examples are now produced by the Algonkin tribes of 
New Eno-Iand and eastern Canada. 

P'or commercial purposes, wicker baskets precisely like those of the 
Abenaki Indians are thus made. 

The wdiite-oak timber is brought to the 3'ard in sticks running from 
6 to 40 inches in diameter and from 4 to IS feet long. It is Hrst sawed 
into convenient lengths, then split with a maul and wedges into fourths 
or sixteenths. The bark is then stripped ofl' with a drawing knife. 
The next process is cutting it into bolts at what is called the splitting 
horse, to be shaved down with a drawing knife into perfectly smooth, 
even bolts of the width and length desired. These are then placed in

the steam box and steamed for a half hour or so, which makes the 
splints more pliable. They are taken thence to the splint knife, which 
is arranged so that one person, by changing the position of the knife, 
can make splints of any desired thickness, from that of paper to that 
of a three-fourths-inch hoop. 

The 03"ster baskets and most small })askets have the bottom splints 
laid one across another and are plainly woven in checker. 

But the round-bottomed baskets, used for grain and truck, are made 
by taking from 10 to 18 ribs and laying them across each other at the 
middle, in radiating form, and weaving around with a narrow thin 
splint until the desired size for the bottom is reached, when the splints 
are turned up and set in other baskets, about a dozen in a series, for 
twenty-four hours. 



230 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 



They 'Avo then woven around with a fine .splint and placed on a 
revolving- drum or form and tilled up the required hight and set in the 
sun to dr}" for six hours. The}" are then shaken hard b}" striking the 
bottom on the floor, which causes the splints to settle tight together 
and prepared for the rim. They next proceed to fasten the handles to 
the sides and put the rims or hoops on l)3'titting- them into the notches 
made in the handles and binding them tightly with tine splints. The 
different st3des are made ])y using' different-shaped drums and vari- 
ously colored sj^lints, the lat- 
ter lieing done by dipping 
the splints before weaving 
into dj^es. 

The most curiously made 
l)askets are those for the char- 
coal and eelpots. 

The charcoal baskets are 
shaped like a tray and are car- 
ried on the head by the coal 
carriers. 

The eelpots are used as traps 
for catching eels. The wood 
is prepared for them in the 
same manner, and they are 
made on a form about 40 inches 
long and in the shape of a bot- 
tle minus the bottom, and have 
a funnel arrangement at either 
end, which is detacha))le. 

D. Wrappeduiork. — \V rap- 
ped basketr}^ consists of flex- 
ible or rigid warp and flexible 
weft. Examples of this tech- 
nic are to be seen in America at the present time among the Indians 
of southern Arizona for their carrying frames. (See flg. 13.) 

The warp extends from the rigid hoop, which forms the top, to the 
bottom where the elements are made fast. Firmness is given to the 
structure l)y means of two bowed rods crossing at right angles at the 
bottom and securely lashed at the top. The weft, usual! v of twine, is 
attached to one of the corner or frame pieces at the bottom and is 
wrapped once around each warp element. This process continues in a 
coil until the top of the basket is reached. In some of its features 
this method resembles coiled work, but as a regular warp is employed 
and no needle is used in the coiling, it belongs more to the woven 
series. Hudson mentions the same among the Ponios for holding roof

poles in place. The wrapping is very close where the rafters come to 
a point. As they widen the weft comes to be farther apart, l^eing- 
quite open on the outer margin. This method of weaving was 
employed b}^ the mound builders of the Mississippi Valley. Markings 
of wrapped weaving pressed on ancient pottery taken from a mound in 
Ohio are to be seen in the Thii-d Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. 
(See fig. 14.) 

This style of weaving had not a wide distribution in America and is 
used at the present day in a restricted region. When tlie warp and 
the weft are of the same twini^ or material and the decussations are 
drawn tiglit, th(> joint resembles the first half of a square knot. The 
Mincopies of the Andaman Islands construct a carrying Imsket in the 
same technic. Specimens of their work were collectcMl and presented 
to the U. S. National Museum l)}^ 
Dr. W. L. Ab])ott." These baskets 
resemble most closely the Mohave 
specimens, only they are smaller and 
more attractive. The Min<'o]ii(»s and 
their neigh])ors far and near have the 
incompara1)le rattan for warp and 
weft, which combines the strength 
and flexi])ility of copper wire. The 
distril)ution of this wrapped wea^'- 
ing has not been studied. Plate IT

weaving from the Moha\(» Indians, ]^hotograph(Hl from the original 
now in the Field Columbian Museum, CHiicago. 

E. Twilled irorl'. — This is found in ancient mounds of th(> Missis- 
sippi Valley, in ])agging of the Rocky Mountains, down the Pacific 
coast from the island of Attn, the most westerly of the Aleutian 
chain, to the })orders of Chile, and here and there in the Atlantic 
slope of South America. Indeed, it is fyund among savages through- 
out the world. It is the most elegant and intricate of all in the woven 
or plicated series. Twined work has a set of warp rods or rigid 
elements as in wickerwork, l)ut the weft elements are commonly 
administered in pairs, though in three-strand twining and in l)raid 
twining three weft elements are enqjloyed. In passing from warp to 
warp these elements are twisted in half -turns on each other so as to 
form a two-strand or three-strand twine or l)raid and usually so deftly 
as to keep the smooth, glossy side of the weft outward. 

The position of the weaver at her task on twined work, in Plate 18, 
shows the transition between the hund)le posture of the primitive 
basket maker and her successor later on seated at a loom. The name

of the weaver in the lower fig-nre is Elizabeth Propokoffono. Her 
home is on the island of Atka, far out in the Aleutian chain. The 
Tlinkit weaver sits on the ground in the old-fashioned way, because 
her warp is rigid and self-supporting; Elizabeth, however, is working 
in soft grass, both for warp and weft. For this reason the former is 
suspended, and she is working from below upward. The Haida Indians 
on Queen Charlotte Archipelago south of her, as will be seen later on, 
weave in the same manner, the war]:) resting on a disk fastened to the 
top of a stake. Enough of modern technical appliances are mingled 
with this thoroughl}' aboriginal process to mark a sharp contrast 
between the woman's lingers and her beautiful basket on the one hand, 

and her loom-woven clothing, her flat- 
iron, and the iron hinges on her door 
on the other hand. 

The upper figure is from the Attu 
Island, also weaving a grass wallet in 
twined work in front of her under- 
ground home or barabara. It is most 
interesting to observe that her Avork is

Indians at the period of discovery. 
According to the relation of the weft elements to one another and 
to the warp, different structures in twined weaving result as follows: 

1. Plain twined weaving over single warps. 

2. Diagonal twined weaving or twill over two or more warps. 

3. Wrapped twined weaving, or bird-cage twine, in which one weft element 
remains rigid and the other is wrapped abont the crossings. 

4. Lattice-twined weaving, tee or Hudson stitch, twined work around vertical 
warj)s crossed by horizontal warj) element. 

5. Three-strand twined weaving and braiding in several styles.

streams to aid in catching or impounding fish, drove a row of sticks 
into the bottom of the stream, a few inches apart. Vines and lirush 
were woven upon these upright sticks which served for a warp. In 
passing each stake the two vines or pieces of brush made a half turn 
on each other. This is a very primitive mode of weaving. Plain 
twined basketry is made on exactly the same plan. There is a set of 
warp elements which may be reeds, or splints, or string, arranged 
radially on the bottom and parallel on the body. The weft consists

of two strips of root or other flexil)lc material, and these are twisted 
as in forming- a two-strand rope passing over a warp stem at each 
half turn. (See lig. 15.) Many wastebaskets are woven on this plan. 

Plate 10 shows two bowls in plain twined weaving, called Bamtush 
by the Pomos, which are excellent examples of the possi])ilities and 
limitations of this style. They are in the collection of C. P. Wilcomb, 
of San Francisco. The upi)er figure, 10 inches in diameter, is from 
Cloverdale, Russian River, Sonoma County; the lower from Potter 
Valley, in Mendocino County. The warp is of willow rods, the weft 
of carex root and splints 
of cercis. A small space 
at the bottom is in three- 
ply braid and the nar- 
row band near the top, 
with wide twists, is plain 
twined work over more 
than one warp stem. (See 
Plates U, U, 71, 72.) 

In this connection nuist 
not ))e overlooked a xn- 
riety of twined weaving 
in which the warp plays 
an important part. It is 
a transition l)etween the 
plain twine and the next 
type, the halves of the 
dou})le warp standing for 
the independent warp 
stems of the diagonal 
weave. If the weft be 
administered in open 
work with the rows from 
a fourth to a half an inch 
apart and the warp ele- 
ments be flexible under 
the strain of weaving, they will assume a zigzag shape. 

Pleasing varieties of this type of twined weaving w411 be found in 
the Aleutian Islands. (See tig. 1(5.) It resembles hemstitching. The 
Aleuts frequent! 3^ use for their warp stems of wild rye or other grasses, 
in which the straws are split, or a pair used, and the two halves pass 
upward in zigzag form. Each half of a warp is caught alternately 
with the other half of the same straw and with a half of the adjoining 
straw, making a series of triangular instead of rectangular spaces. 
(See tig. 17.) 

A still further variation is given to plain twined ware by crossing

the wiirps. In l)am])oo ])asketr3^ of eastern Asia these crossed warps 
are also interlaced or held tog-ether by a horizontal strip of bamboo 
passing in and out in ordinary weaving. In such examples the inter- 
stices are triangular, but in the twined example here described the 
weaving passes across l)etween the points where the warps intersect

each other, leaving hexagonal interstices. (See tig, 18 and Plate 166,) 
This combination of plain twined weft and crossed warp has not a wide 
distribution in America, but examples are to be seen in southeastern 
Alaska and among relics found in Peruvian graves. 

2. Dtagoiial tunned inenving. — In diagonal twined weaving the twist- 
ing of the weft filaments is precisely the 
same as in plain twaned weaving. The difier- 
ence of the texture is caused b}' the manner 
in which the weft crosses the warps. This 
style aboinids among the Ute Indians and 
the Apache, who dip the bottles made in 
this fashion into pitch and thus produce a 
water-tight vessel, the open meshes receiv- 
ing the pitch more freely. The technic of 
the diagonal weaving consists in passing 
over two or more warp elements at each 
turn, just as in weaving with a single ele- 
ment. But the warp of the diagonal twined 
weaving never passes over or under more than one weft as it does in 
twilled weaving. There must be an odd number of warps, for in the 
next round the same pairs are not included in the half turns. The 
ridges on the outside, therefore, are not vertical as in plain weaving, 
but pass diagonally over the surface, hence the name. (See Plate 20, 
and figs. 19 and 20.)

Plate 20 will make clear th(^ difference between plain twined weav- 
ino- and diagonal twined or twilled work. The tio-urt\s ar(> of the bur- 
den basket, the granary, and the mush bowls of tiie Porno Indians, in 
Lake, Sonoma, and Mendocino counties, California, in the collection 
of C. P. Wilcoml). Especial attention 
is here drawn to the inlinittdy greater 
possibilities of decoration in the twilled 
work. The foregoing phite shows that 
the ornamentation of plain twined 
l)asketry is confined chiefly to hands, 
but here the artist revels in the cycloid, 
which widens and becomes more intri- 
cate as it ascends. It rivals in com- 
plexity the best coiled work of th(> 
Pomos and should be compared with 
Plates 20 and 5«;. 

8. W/'aj)jjed ttnincd tnari/u/. — In 
wrapped twined weaving one element 
of tlie twine passes along horizontally 
across the warp stems, usually on the 
inside of the ]>asket, forming a lattice. The binding element of splint, 
or strip of l)ark, or string, is wrapped around the crossings of the 
horizontal element with the vertical warp. (See lig. 21.) 

On the outside of the basket the turns of the wrapping are oldique; 

on the inside they ar(^ vertical. It 
will be seen on examining this fig- 
ure that one row inclines to the 
right, the one above it to the left, 
and so on alternately. This was 
occasioned l)y the weaver's passing 
from side to side of the square car- 
rying basket, and not all the way 
round as usual, l^he work is simi- 
lar to that in an old-fashioned bird 
cage, where the upright and hori- 
zontal wires are held in place by a 
wrapping of liner soft wire. The 
typical example of this wrapped or 
bird-cage twine is to l)e seen among 
the Makah Indians of the Wakashan family living about Neah Bay, 
AVashington, and in the soft hats of Salish and Shapaptian. (See tig. 22.) 
In this type the warp and the liorizontal strip behind the warp are 
both in soft material. The wrapping is done with a tough straw- 
colored grass. When the weaving is beaten home tight the surface is 
not unlike that of a tine tiled roof, the stitches overlying each other

with perfect reo-ularity. Such a simple style of fastening- warp and 
weft together would seem to have occurred to tribes of savages in 
many parts of the world. Strange to relate, however, excepting in 
Washington and the ocean side of Vancouver Island, the process is not 
known. The exception to this statement is to be found in a few spo- 
radic cases where, perhaps, Nutka and Makah women had married into 
adjoining tribes. A few of the Salish women make similar ware, and 
it will be seen in basket hats of the Nez Perce Indians. A small col- 
lection of this Avare came to the 
Museum through the Wilkes Ex- 
ploring Expedition, but the orna- 
mentation is decidedly Skokomish. 
Figs. 23 and 24 show the detail 
of mixed twined weaving, diago- 
nal twined weaving, and wrapped 
twined weaving, inside and outside 
view. The facility with which 
the basket maker combines these 
weaves in the same texture gives 
her complete control over her mate- 
rial in the matter of ornamentation. 
The coloring of the two sides of 
the splints of cercis shows, in the 
figures, the difference between the 
outside and the inside of the basket. Another element of technic, not 
mentioned hitherto, is made apparent here in the requirements of 
these three different stjdes of workmanship controlling the space 
somewhat of the warp rods. Perhaps in no other tribe than the Pomo 
is there such free use of any numl^er of textile methods on the same 
piece of workmanship to secure different results. 

It is possil)le to combine the several methods of twined weaving 
and, calling the aid of color, to produce good effects even in unpromis- 
ing materials. Figs. 25 and 26 show back and front of a square from 
a Ute basket jar. The first two rows are plain twined work, then 
come three rows of plain twined work also, though it does not look 
like it. It incloses warp stems in pairs, and the back and front are 
alike. It changes to diagonal merely by alternating warps. Below 
these three rows are diagonal twine, wrapped twine, or Makah weave, 
comlnned with diagonal. Plate 21 contains five figures, all in diagonal 
twined weaving. They were made by the Ute Indians and collected 
long ago by Major J. W. Powell. They represent first of all the dif- 
ferent results of the same technical process in varied materials. The 
specimens are all woven precisely alike. Fig. 1 has a coarse, inffexible 
warp. Fig. 2 has a liner warp, and hence the twists ma}^ be driven 
closer home. Fig. 4 shows the adaptation of modern shape in facili-

-t. Lattlce-t wined irenrlng. — The lattice-twined weaving, so far as 
the collections of the National Museum show, is contined to the Porno 
Indians, of the Kulanapan famil}', residing on Kussian River, Cali- 
fornia. It is so called because it has a vertical and a horizontal warp

resembling latticework. Dr. J. W. Hudson calls this technic tee. 
This is a short and convenient word, and may be used for a specilic 
name. The tee-twined weaving consists of four elements, {a) the 
upright warp of rods, (/>) a horizontal warp crossing' these at right 
angles, and (r, d) a regular plain-twined weaving of two elements, 
holding the warps tinnly together. (See tig. 27.) 

In all these examples in the National Museum the horizontal or 
extra warp is on the exterior of the basket. On the outside the tee

basket does not resemble the ordinary twined work, ])ut on the inside 
it is indistinguishable. Baskets made in this fashion are very rigid 
and strong, and frequently the hoppers of mills for grinding acorns, 
and also water-tight jars, are thus constructed. The ornamentation is 
contined to narrow bands, the artist being restricted by the technic.

Plate 22 shows two examples of tee weaving. The upper one, 19 

inches in diameter, is from Pinole rancheria, Mendocino County, Cali- 
fornia. The lower one is froiu 
Lake County, and ])oth are in 
the collection of C. P. Wilcoml). 
The warp is in stems of the wil- 
low, the dull colored material of 
the weft is the root of sedge, 
the brown and very white colors 
are in the stem of cercis — the 
former color being outside bark, 
the latter of wood next to the 
bark. (See also Plate 173. ) 

The technic of these two bas- 
kets is as follows: Beginning at 
the upper edge there is no spe- 
cial })order, the ends of the warp 
stems being cut off; two or three 
rows of plain twined weaving 
are at the top; just below will 
be seen three or four rows of 
alternating brown and white 
rectangles; these are also in 

plain twined weaving, although the twists pass over two or three warp 

stems instead of one; after that twined tec weaving follows over the 

entire surface. With an ordinaiy 

hand glass the two sets of warp, 

vertical and horizontal, can be 

made out, and also the way in 

which the weft of thin splints is 

administered. The limitations of 

ornament to the narrow bands 

with triangles and parallelograms 

for the elements are clearly seen. 

On the plain bands a form of orna- 
ment will be noted, in which splints 

of cercis unite with those of sedge 

root to form an alternation of 

wood color and very white. In 

the colored bands the eti'ects are 

produced by exposing now the 

outside or l)ark of the cercis, now 

the inside or wood color. No at- 
tempt has been made to change the color of these splints artificially. 
5. Three-strand twined weaving. — Three-strand twined weaving is the

use of three weft splints und othcM- kinds of weft elements instead of

(a) Three-strand twine.

(r) Three-strand, false enil)roiderv. Tlinkit. 

{(/) Frap])ed twine, Thompson Kivei'. 

It will )»e seen in stud3'ino- these four methods that they are partly 
structural and partly ornamental, especially the last two. Inasnuich, 
however, as the Indian woman 
makes her ornamental work a 
part of her industi'ial work, the 
four methods may l)e all studied 
here. Ver}- little was known 
among' the American aborioincs 
concerning" additional ornaments 
given to the textile after the 
foundation was woven. Tiie part 
which furnishes strength to the 
fabrii- and that which gives deco- 
ration were in technic one and 
the same process. 

{(f) Thi'i'c-fifrand tmlne. — In 
this technic the basket-weaver holds in her hand three weft elements 
of any of the kinds mentioned. In twisting these three, each one 
of the strands, as it passes inward, is carried behind the warp stem 
adjoining, so that in a whole revolution the three weft elements have

in turn passed behind three warp elements. After that the process is 
repeated. By referring to the lower halves of tigs. 2S and 20, the 
outside and the inside of this technic will be made plain. On the out- 
side there is the appearance of a three-strand string laid along the warp 
stems, while on the inside the texture looks like a plain twined weaving*. 



240 



EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSIEUM, 1902. 



The reason for this is apparent, since in ovoiy third revolution one 
element passes behind the warp and two remain in front. Three- 
strand twined work is seldom used over the entire surface of a ])asket. 
In tij^. 30 will be seen the drawing- of a very old piece of twined Avork 
from the ancient Hopi or Mold Pueblo. The bottom of this old basket 
jar and a portion of the bod}', as will be seen, are covered with plain 
twine weft. The shoulder and neck and two bands of the body are in 
three-strand twined weaving-. A small portion of the inside, seen in 
the top of the'drawing, as will be seen, has the appearance of small two- 
strand twined work. In lig. 31 is shown a square inch from the sur-

of teclmic. T'he upper portion of the figure has all the appearance of 
twilled and twined work in two-strand weft. The three-strand work 
shown in this figure is a Ute motive. The U. S. National Museum col- 
lections represent at least seven different styles of basketry technic 
attributed to the Hopi people of Tusayan, and philologists have come 
to the conclusion that the Hopi are a very mixed people.

twine and three-strand braid. Th(^ three-strand braid is found at the 
starting of all Pomo twined ])askets, 
no matter how the rest is ])uilt up.

of coarse stems of rushes. The

bottom and as the specimen widens

These are securely joined together 
by a continuous coil of weft, which 
is a three-strand l)raid. At the lie- 
ginning these turns of the coil touch 
one another, but as the w^ork pro- 
gresses and the basket widens the 
distance from one row to the next increases until thev ai'e n(»arlv an 
inch apart at the to}). The l)raiding is done from the outside, two of 
the stems showing always there and only one on the inside, resem})ling 
common twined weaving. This is the otdy specimen in the Museum 
in w^hich the whole surface is braided. In manv twined baskets of the

Pomo an inch or so at the bottom is thus woven. The top is finished 
oii' in the following manner: Three warp ends are braided together 
for at least 2 inches, turned down and cut off. The hook-shaped ends 
are held in place by a row of connuon twined weaving at the top. 
Just below this and close to the ends is a row of three-strand braid.

Another row of the same kind is made halfway between the upper 
edge of the solid weaving and the border. A hoop of wood is held in 
place on the inside by a wrapping of coarse twine. The appearance of 
three-strand braid in the drawing on the inside of the baslvet is given 
by the strands of twined weaving and the ends of the warp bent over. 
The basket is strengthened on the outside by five vertical rods, and 
the carrying string is in three-strand braid, precisely as in the body 
and margin of the basket. Height 22 inches, diameter 23 inches. In 
the collection of Dr. C. Hart Merriam arc two closely woven Klamath 
baskets in the same technic (see Plate 174). Styles (c-) and (d) Ijclong

Something should be said in this connection about the manner of 
laying the foundation for weaving baskets. In many of the specimens 
illustrated in this work it will be seen that very little tasteful care has 
been bestowed upon this part of the work. The Eskimos, for instance, 
do not know how, seemingly, but use a piece of rawhide, and it is said 
that the Indians of British Columbia formerly inserted a piece of board 
or wood at the bottom of their coiled baskets and sewed the coils 
around an edge of it, but there is method in much of the basket weav- 
ing iu this point, as will be seen on examining the plates. Miss Mary

other eight are spread out in the same way. The drawing illustrates 
exactly the manner in which this is done. 

Fig. 36 shows another method of beginning with 1(5 warp stems, 

plaiting them into checker pattern at first, 
then afterwards spreading them out radi- 
ally. 

Fig. 37 brings us into the Hop! Indian 
type of twined weaying. Here four stems

COILED BASKETRY 



Coiled basketry is produced ))y an oyer-and-over sewing with some 
kind of flexible material, each stitch interlocking with the one inune- 
diately underneath it. The exception to this is to be seen on Salish, 
Maidu, and other baskets, in which the 
passing stitch is driven through the wood 
of the one underneath and splits it. 

In the coiled basketry of British Colum- 
bia, as well as here and there farther south, 
this splitting of stitches, so clumsj^ look- 
ing when done without plan, is turned 
into an element of ])eauty. The top of 
each stitch is carefully Ijifurcated or tri- 
furcated, so that to the uninitiated the sew- 
ing appears to have ])een done vertically 
instead of horizontally. This type of 
work may be called furcate coil. (See 
Plate 23 and figs. .51 and 55.) 

The specimen (Plate 23) is a nnnarkabh" old piece found near 
Death's Valley, California. Diameter, 6^ inches; depth, 4 inches; 
colors, dark wood, with line of l)rown around top. This is one of the 
finest specimens of furcated stitches. It resembles conmion Ute l)as- 
ketry of the two-stem variety, and in the sewing the stitches are not 
driven home tight, but left as wide apart as possible. On the inside

of the basket it i.s plain coiled sewing", showing the foundation rod 

clearly ])etween the stitches. Passing tlu^ awl jjoint between the 

stitches on the inside, it is carefully pushed through so as to divide 

the sewing splint of the previous coil exactly in the middle. This 

gives the appearance of embroidery stitches from 

the center of the bottom to the outer mai'gin. This 

specimen of furcated stitching is in the collection of 

Edward L. McLeod. Those familiar with the coiled 

basket making taught in the industrial schools will 

compare this work with their own, in which the 

colored raha is hidden in the foundation for a space 

of wrapping and comes out at the point where the 

double stitch is to be made. 

The transition ])etween lace w^ork and coiled bas- 
ketry is interesting. In the netted bags of pita 
fiber, common throughout middle America, in the 
muskemoots or Indian bags of tine caribou skin 
thong from the Mackenzie River district, as well as 
in the lace-like netting of the Mohave carrying 
frames and Peruvian textiles, the sewing and inter- 
locking constitute the whole texture, the woman 
doing her work over a short cylinder or spreader of 
wood or bone, which she moves along as she woi'ks. 
When the plain sewing changes to half hitches, or 
stitches in wdiich the moving part of the filament or 
twine is wrapped or served one or more times about 
itself, there is the rude beginning of point lace work. 
This is seen in basketry and soft wallets of the Mac- 
kenzie River tribes, the Hopewell mound relics in 
Ohio, here and there in California, and especially 
among the Fuegians, as well as in many pieces from 
various parts of the Old World. (See iigs. 59, 115). 

The sewing materials vary with the region. In 
the Aleutian Islands it is of delicate straw; in the 
adjacent region it is spruce root; in British Colum])ia 
it is cedar or spruce root; in the more diversified 
styles of the Pacific States every availal)le material 
has been used — stripped leaf, grass stems, I'ushes, 
split root, broad fillets, and twine, the etiect of each 
being well marked. The gathering and preparation 
of these materials for use have already been described in the first por- 
tion of this paper. It is understood that, as in woven basketry, the 
grasses, roots, and splints of wood are soaked in water and kept as 
pliable as possible until the work is done. 

In all coiled basketry, properly so called, there is a foundation more

or less rigid, inclosed within stitches, the only implement being an awl 
of some kind. Fig. 40 shows the metatarsal of an antelope sharpened 
in the middle and harder portion of the column, the joint serving for 
a grip for the hand. It was the universal prehistoric sewing imple- 
ment of savage women and persists to our day. 

In every living tribe of basket makers these awls are among the com- 
monest of woman's tools, most serviceable in sewing garments as well. 
They are dug up in mounds, found in caves, and are rarely absent from 
the work baskets of mummies in the arid regions." 

Frank H. Gushing was of the opinion that the bone awl was far 
better for fine basket work than any implement of steel; the point, 
being a little rounded, would find its way between the stitches of the 
coil underneath and not force itself through them. The iron awl, 
being hard and sharp, breaks the texture and gives a very rough and 
clumsy appearance to the surface, as will be seen in fig. 51. 

Coiled basketry in point of size presents the greatest extreme. 
There are specimens delicately made that will pass through a lady's 
finger ring, and others as large as a flour barrel; some specimens 
have stitching material one-half inch wide, as in the Pima granaries, 
and in others the root material is shredded so fine that nearly 100 
stitches are made within an inch of space. In form the coiled ware 
may be perfectly flat, as in a table mat, or built up into the most 
exquisite jar shape. In design the upright stitches lend themselves to 
the greatest variety of intricate patterns. 

Coiled basketry may be divided into ten varieties, based on struc- 
tural characteristics. 

The foundation of the coil may be (1) a single element, either splint, 
or stem, or rod; (2) a stem or other single element, with a thin welt 
laid on top of it; (3) two or more stems one over another; (4) two 
stems or other elements laid side by side, with or without a welt; (5) 
three stems in triangular position; (6) a bundle of splints or small 
stems; (7) a bundle of grass or small shreds. 

The stitches pass around the foundation in progress (1) interlocking 
with and sometimes splitting stitches, but not inclosing the founda- 
tion underneath; (2) under one rod of the coil beneath, however many 
there may be; (3) under a welt of the coil beneath; (4) through splints 
or other foundation, in some cases systematically splitting the sewing 
material underneath. With these explanations it is possible to make 
the following ten varieties of coiled basketry, matting, or bagging: 

A. Coiled work without foundation. 

jB. vSimple ititerlocking coils. 

0. Single-rod foundation. 

D. Two-rod foundation.

subtropical areas the latter. If a plain, spiral spring be coiled or 
hooked into one underneath, the simplest form of the open coiled 
work will result. An improvement of this is effected when the 
moving thread in passing upward after interlocking is twined one or 
more times al)out its standing part. (See tigs. 41 A and 100.) 

The technical process just mentioned is practiced among the Atha- 
pascan tribes of the Mackenzie River drainage. It is doubtful whether 
anciently the predecessors of these Indian women did such tine work 
in rawhide. The steel-bladed knife made slender babiche possible, 
and the thrift brought about l)y the Hudson Bay Company made it 
desiral)le. But it will be seen that the Mound-builders had the weave 
and could produce in flax texture even more delicate than the muske- 
moots or huntino- baas of the northern tribes.

coils, looking- as all-coiled ])as- 
ketry would if the foundation 
wore removed. 

Further on illustrations will be 
g-iven show'ing- the wide extent of 
this technical process of coiled 
basketry without foundation. P]x- 
amj^les in the U. S. National Mu- 
seum come from as far south as 
Paragua}^ and even the Straits of 
Magellan. It is in common use as 
far north as northern Mexico. 
J^oth the possession of different 
material and the demands of a 
tropical life have occasioned the 
employment of this particular 
technic in articles of connnon use 
a))out the household, its relation 
to coiled ])asketry and bead work 
is shown l)y the fact that women 
in making the fabric use a nee- 
dle to carry the thread or string- 
around through the row of work 
preceding. A small rod or mesh 
gauge is used to secure uniformity in the size of the meshes. 

B. Simi^le infcrloch'ing colh. — Coilt^d work in which there may be 
any sort of foundation, but the stitches 
merely interlock without catching under the 
rods oi' splints or grass l)eneath. This form 
easily passes into those in which the stitch 
takes one or more elements of the founda- 
tion, but in a thorough ethnological study 
small differences can not be overlooked.

intorlock. Two (luito distinct stylos of foundation are usod, namely, 
hunches of splints tak(Mi from tlu' moi-e hrittle and i-ouuh interior of 
the cedar root, and two flat strips of the smooth layer on the outside 
of the root. The surface of the one will l)e rugose, of the other, flat 
and smooth. (See figs. 52, 53, and 54 and Plates i5(>-lt;i.) 

Fio-s. 44 and 45 represent a type of coiled work in vogue among 
the Mescalero Apaches. As has been said previously, the Apache 
Indians, who live in the arid regions of Arizona, made the foundations 
of their coiled l)asketrY of hard rods. In various ti-ibes these rods 
are arranged in a foundation after difterent patterns. It will he seen 
by examining the drawing here given that three rods form tlu' basis 
of the coil. Thev are laid one on another in a vertical row. the

stitches simply interlocking so that the greatest economy of work is 
ettected. It is not known that any othcu- tribe in America practices 
this peculiar arrangement of the foundation rods. This specimen, 
(Jat. No. 211941, in the U. S. National Museum, was collected by 
F. M. Covert. 

Plate 24 shows a style of coiled weaving called openwork. This 
specimen, in the collection of C. PI Rumsey, Riverside, California, is 
termed a grasshopper })asket, but it belongs to a type of technic that has 
a very wide distribution, and probably has nothing to do with holding 
live insects. The foundation is a bundle of shredded material or grass. 
The sewing is a splint of hard wood. This is wrapped a certain number 
of times around the foundation and then caught under the sewing of the 
coil underneath, the stitches interlocking. Perhaps a few bits of the

foundation are caught also in the stitch. After two stitches are made 
in this way the wrapping- continues. It is possible by counting this last 
as well as the number of stitches to reproduce beautiful patterns on 
the surface. The ornamentation also may be varied by the use of 
different colored splints. This specimen is from the Watchumna 
(Mariposan) Indians of middle California, but examples are in the 
-|,^,,^_ ..^^ National Museum collected from 

Norway, Porto Rico, and Peru. 
(See Plates 224 and 248.) 

C. Single-rod foandation.—ln 
rattan basketr}' and Pacific coast 
ware, called by Dr. J. W. Hud- 
son tsai in the Pomo language, 
the foundation is a single stem, 
uniform in diameter. The stitch 
passes around the stem in prog- 
ress and is caught under the one 
of the preceding coil, as in fig. 41 C. 
In a collection of Siamese basketry 
in the U. S. National Museum the specimens are all made after this 
fashion. The foundation is the stem of the plant in its natural state; 
the sewing is with splints of the same material, having the glistening 
surface outward. As this is somewhat unyielding it is difficult to 
crowd the stitches together, and so the foundation is visible between. 
California is not far behind the East in the quality of material, willow 
for the basis of the coil, and plants 
in a variety of colors for the sew- 
ing. The Siamese coiled basketry 
has little of design on its surface, 
but the Amei'ican basketmaker may 
fix whatever her imagination ma}" 
suggest. The effect of the plain 
stitching is pleasing to the eye by 
reason of the regular broken sur- 
face. In America single-rod bas- 
ketry is w^idely spread. Along the 
Pacific coast it is found in northern 
Alaska and as far south as the bor- 
ders of Mexico. The Pomo Indians 
use it in some of their finest work. 
The roots of plants and soft stems of willow, rhus, and the like are 
used for the sewing, and, being soaked thoroughly, can be crowded 
together so as to entirely conceal the foundation. (See fig. 40.)

tshai by Carl Piirdy. These specimens are in the collection of C. P. 
Wilcoml); the foundation is of willow rod, the sewing material of 
sedge root, the design in the cereis splints, the decoration with shells, 
heads, and partridge plumes. The method of sewing is on all of these 
baskets the same as shown in tig. 41 C. 

Plate 26, Cat. No. 89801 U.S.N.M., is from Point Barrow, Alaska, 
and was collected ])y Capt. P. 11. Ray, U. S. Army. Tlu^ material is 
shoots and roots of willow, and the specimen was secured from Eskimo 
people living at the extreme northern [)oint of Alaska. It had evi- 
dently been procured, however, from Indians near b3\ On the bot- 
tom small rods are used for the foundation and the sewing is in straight 
lines l)ackward and forward until this portion is finished. Here the 
foundation rods are somewhat larger and the sewing splints wider. 
Comparing this specimen, then, with a great many others from the same 
area, the uniformity in size of the foundation rod is noticeable. It 
will also be noted that the stitches arc 
not driven home closely, a feature which 
occurred over and over again in coiled 
basketry between Point Bai'row and the 
Republic of Mexico. 

I). Two-rod fomiddtlon. — One rod in 
this style lies on top of the other; the 
stitches pass over two rods in progress 
and under tlie upper one of the pair 
below, so that each stitch incloses three 
stems in a vertical series (fig. 47). A 
little attention given to fig. 41 D will 
demonstrate that the alternate rod, or 
the upper rod, in each pair will be in- 
closed in two series of stitches, while the other or lower rod will pass 
along freelv in the middle of one series of stitches and show on the 
outer side. Examples of this two-rod foundation are to ))e seen among 
the Athapascan tribes of Alaska, among the Pomo Indians of the 
Pacific coast, and among the Apache of Arizona. An interesting 
or specialized variety of this type is seen among the Mescaleros of 
New Mexico, who use the two-rod foundation, l)ut instead of passing 
the stitch around the upper rod of the coil below simply interlock the 
stitches so that neither one of the two rods is inclosed twice. This 
Apache ware is served with yucca fiber and the l^row^n root of the same 
plant, producing a l)rilliant ettect, and the result of the special technic 
is a fiat surface like that of pottery. The U. S. National Museum 
possesses a single piece of precisely the same technic from the kindred 
of the Apache on the Lower Yukon. (See figs. 44 and 45.) 

E. Rod and 'in<M foundation. — In this kind of basketry the single- 
rod foundation is overlaid by a splint or strip of tough fiber, some-

times the same as that with which the sewing is done; at others, a strip 

of leaf or bast. The stitches pass over the rod and strip which are 

on top down under the welt only of the coil below, the stitches inter- 
locking-. The strip of tough liber 
between the two rods which serves 
for a welt has a double purpose — 
strengthening the fabric and chink- 
ing the space between the rods (fig. 
-ts). This style of coil work is seen 
on old Zufii basket jars and on Cali- 
fornia examples. This type of foun- 
dation passes easily into forms C, D, 
E, and F. In fact, it is impossible 
to distinguish between them without 
mari'ing the specimen. (See fig. 41.) 
The specimens shown on Plate 27 
are a Avater bottle and a gathering 

basket of the Utes; that is, they are of Ute motive. Such pieces, 

however, are often seen among other tribes and in some of the later 

pueblos. By looking carefully ut the surface of the pictures it will be 

seen that there may be two 

rods, the upper much smaller 

than the other; or on the top 

of the principal rod will be 

a splint or two of material. 

The foundation of such bas- 
ketry is not uniform in 

composition, l)ut in motive 

they are all the same. The 

strength of the basket is in 

the principal rod. The joint 

is made stronger l)y having 

between the stitches of two 

coils an additional rod or 

smaller piece. There are no 

wide gaps separating any 

two styles of weaving, and 

it will be easily seen that this 

Ute type passes readily into 

other forms.

one mig'ht guess, into the Lillooet style, in which the two elements of 
the foundation are thin and Hat. Fig. -ti> is a watei- jar from tlie Wolpi 
pueblo, one of the Hopi group, collected long ago by James Stev^on- 
,son. It is Cat. No. 42lL>l> r.S.N.M., and was tirst figured in the Second 
Animal Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. (See tig. 41 F. ) 

Plate 28 represents two line old coiled baskets from the pueblo of 
Sia, on the E,io Grande River, New Mexico. In addition to the struc- 
ture, which consists of two rods and a splint al)ov(» sewed witli willow 
splints, the stitches interlocking and catching in the welt Ixdow, the 
ornamentation a stepped design, suggestive of pueblo ai'chitecture on 
the upper ligure and spirals made up of colored rectangles on the lower 
figure, needs to l)e merely pointed out. The characteristic sought to be 
illustrated here in this connection is the false braid maUe on tiie sur- 
face produced by sewing a single 
splint in a ligure of eight wea\ing, 
shown in the plate. The modem 
Indians of this puel)lo do not make 
basketry of this character, and it is 
altogether reasonalde to think that 
in the olden times these pieces came 
into the possession of these people

G. Thiue-i'od foundation . — This is 
the t^^pe of foundation called l)y Carl 
Purdy bam shi l)u, from bam, sticks, 
and sibbu, three. Among the Pomo 

and other tribes in the western part of the United States the most 
delicate pieces of basketry" are in this style. Dr. Hudson calls them 
"the jewels of coiled basketry.'* The surfaces are beautifully cor- 
rugated, and patterns of the most intricate character can l)e wrought 
on them. The technic is as follows: Three or four small willow 
stems of uniform thickness s(M■^'(^ for the foundation, as shown in 
fig. 50; also in cross section in Hg. 41 G. The sewing, which may 
be in splints of willow, l)lack or white carex root, or cercis stem, 
passes around the three stems constituting the coil, under the upper 
one of the bundle below, the stitches interlocking. In some examples 
this upper rod is replaced l)y a thin strip of material serving for a 
welt (see lig. 41 F). In the California area the materials for Ixisketry 
are of the finest quality. The willow stems and carex root are suscep- 
tible of division into delicate filaments. Sewing done with these is 
most compact, and when the stitches are pressed closel}^ together the

foundation does not appeal'. On th(^ surface of the bam slii bu 
basketry the Porno weaver adds pretty bits of bird feathers and deli- 
cate pieces of shell. The 1)asket represmits the wealth of the maker, 

and the gift of one of these to a 
friend is considered to be the highest 
compliment. 

Plate '2\) is a beautiful example of 
Bam shi bu coiled basketry, having 
a foundation of three Bams, or shoots 
of Hind's willow {Sdlie i<et<)< HI folia). 
The sewing of the lighter portions 
is in carefully prepared roots of 
a sedge, Kahum {Carex harharae)., 
while the designs are in the roots of 
a l)ulrush, Tsuwish {Srirj>>/s 7>ia7'i-

fornia woodpecker are scattered over 
the surface. This faultless speci- 
men, now in the collection of C. P. Wilcomb, was made in the year 
1896 l)y Squaw Mary, a noted basket maker, wife of Ned Dunson 
(Indian), then living at Santa Rosa Creek, Sonoma County, California.

has no standing in that tribe. In the (irreat Interior Basin, where the 

pliant material of the C-alifornia trilies is wantino-, only the outer and 

younger poi-tion ot" the stem will do for sewing. The interior parts 

in such examples are made up into 

the foundation. All such ware is 

rude, and the sewing frequently 

pass(^s through instead of around 

the stitches ))elow. In the Kli- 

kitat l>asketry the pieces of spruce 

or cedar root not used for sewing 

materiid avo also worked into the 

foiuidation. (See tig. 41 H.) 

In a small area on Fraser River, 
in southwestern Canada, on the 
u])per waters of the Columl)ia, and 
in many Salishan tril)es of north- 
western Washington, l>asketry, 
called iud)ricated, is made. The 
foundation, as said, is in cedar or 
spruce root, while the sewing is done with the outer and tough por- 
tion of the root; the stitches pass over the upi)er bundl(> of splints 
and are locki^d with those underneath. On the outside of these bas- 
kets is a foi-m of t(>chnic. which also constitutes the ornamentation. 
It is not something added, or overlaid, or sewed on, ]>ut is a part of 
the texture etiected in the progress of the manufacture. (See fig. 62.) 
The method of adding this ornamentation in strips of cherry bark, 
cedar l)ast, and grass stems, dyed with Oregon grape, is unique, and 

on this account I have applied the 
term "■iml)ricated" to the style of 
weave here shown. (See fig. 53.) 

The strip of colored bark or grass 
is laid down and caught under a 
passing stitch; before another stitch 
is taken this one is ])ent forward to 
cover the last stitch, doubled on 
itself so as to })e underneath the 
next stitch, and so with each one it 
is bent backward and forward so 
that the sewing is entirely con- 
cealed, forming a sort of "knife plaiting," 

In some of the finer old l)askets in the National Museum, collected 
over sixty years ago, the entire surface is covered with work of this 
kind, the strips not being- over an eighth of an inch wide. James 
Teit describes and illustrates this type of weaving among the Thomp-

of the basket is in the root of Thuja pJicatu^ and the ornamentation 
in strips of Elyniu^ triticoldcs and Primus demissa. (See fij;". 54.) 

Imbrication is one of the most restricted of technical processes. 
Eells says that some women in ever}- tribe on Puget Sound could pro- 
duce the stitch, and he names the 
Puyallups, Twanas, Snohomish, 
Clallam, Makah, Skagit, Cowlitz, 
Chehalis, Nisqualli, and Squaxon. 
It doubtless orioinated here. It is 
the native art of the Klikitat, Yak- 
ima, and Spokanes, all of whom 
are of the Shahaptian family. The 
Thompson and Fraser River In- 
dians have long- known the art. 
(See Plates 68, 74-79, 156-167.) 

Fig. 55 is a squai-e inch from the 
bottom of a Fraser River imbri- 
cated coiled basket. It illustrates 
several important features in the basket maker's art. In the first 
place, the Indians of this ai'ca did not know how to make a ])eginning 
of the bottom of a rectangular l)asket wnth coiled work, so a block w^as 
inserted or foundation strips were laid parallel and were w^hipped 
together after the manner of coiled Avork. This figure also shows 
how the splitting of stitches before mentioned in sewing may have 
at first been accidental, the basket 
maker having in mind only the i)ur- 
pose of placing the stitches in vertical 
rows. From this unintentional fur- 
cation of the stitches comes the pur- 
poseful splitting, the forked stitches 
being made alike and uniform. Thus, 
out of a careless hal)it has come one 
of the beautiful ornamentations in 
coiled basketry. A third purpose in 
this figure is to show% perhaps, tln^. 
initial step in imbricated work. In- 
deed, this form of overlaying is seen 
on many examples of it. A straw^ of 
squaw grass {Xeroplnjlhini tciKi.i) is 

inclosed under a stitch; it is then turned back; a second stitch is made 
and the strip of grass laid over it. Thus, over tlie surface there is an 
alternation of exposed and concealed stitches b}' means of this material. 
This is elsewhere called ' ' beading. ''

steins, oi' siniill nii(lri))s from })alin leaves, oi* sliredd(Hl yucca. The 
effect in all such ware is o-ood, for the reason that the maker has per- 
fect control of her material. Excellent examples of this kind are to 
be seen in the southwestern portions of the United States, amono- the 
Pueblos and Missions, and in northern Africa. The sewing may be 
done witli split stems of hard wood, 
willow, rhus, and the like, or, as in 
the case of the Mission l>askets in 
southei'n California, of the stems of 
rushes [JitiieKs acutu.s) or stiff' o-rass 
{^Epicdiiip, s rhjcni^). (See tig. 56, 
and the cross section given in tig. 
•il I.) In the larger granar}' Ijaskets 
of the Southwest a bundle of straws 
furnishes the foundation, while the 
sewing is done with ])road strips of 
tough l)ark, as in lig. 57. 

Plate ;^0 shows specimens of Hopi 
coiled pla({ues on shredded founda- 
tion made up of the harder parts of 
the yucca split and rolled into a Imndle. The sewing is with tue 
tough, leafy portion and |)asses simply under the coil in preparation, 
the stitches interlocking. BetweiMi the retined type of coiled work 
of this class and the old-fashioned straw beehive or the Mohave gran- 
ary is a long distance. These thick Hopi phujues have their nearest 

resemblance in tlie Moorish Itasketr}' 
of Xorth Africa and leave the question 
on the mind whether from long contact 
the llopi themselves may not have got- 
ten a suggestion therefrom. These 
specimens are Cat. Nos. 106S56 and

(See also tig. 58.) 

K. Fu('(jhi)i <r>H((lh((.s]ietr(j. — In this 
ware the foundation is slight, consist- 
ing of one or more rushes; the sewing 
is in l)uttonhole stitch or half hitches, 
with rush stems interlocking. The 
resemblance of this to Asiatic types 
on the Paciffc is most striking. (See ffg. 5U.)

mens just illustrated from the Straits of Magellan. It is described by

Basketry is rendered water-tight by closeness of texture and by 
daubing with pitch or asphaltum. Both twined and coiled ware are 
useful for this latter purpose. It is said of the mother of Moses that 
she "took for him an ark [a boat-shaped basket] of bulrushes and

fuegian coiled b.isket, and details. 

daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the child therein, and 
she laid it in the flags by the river's brink." (Exodus ii, 3.) Now, 
the Egyptians and other Hamites of our day make coiled basketrj^ of 
type flg. 41 1; that is, with a foundation of shredded material sewed 
with flnely split palm leaf. The foundation is quite thick, so that the 
ware is strikingly like the Hopi plaques of the Middle Mesa. There is 
no reason for believing that the ancient ware diflered from the modern. 
In the Interior Basin also baskets are used for potter}^ by tribes that 
are not sedentary. (See Plate 32.) 

Major J. W. Powell, during his topographical and geological sur- 
vey of the valley of the Colorado River of the West, in company with 
Prof. A. H. Thompson, made a collection of water-tight basket work 



ABOEIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 259 

from the Paiute Indians (Shoshonean family) in southern Utah, and 
additions liave been made by Dr. Walter Hough and others. Both coiled 
and twined work are found in great varieties. Plato 32 represents the 
varieties of these water-tight carrying jugs or bottles. Fig. 1 of the 
l^late, Cat. No. 118S2, is a Tsai a wats, in twined weaving, the pattern 
being twilled work. Lugs on the side support the ])road, soft, buckskin 
band. The pitch is evenly laid on, just revealing the texture beneath. 
Height, 7i inches. 

Fig. 2, Cat. No. 10700, is a globose jar in coiled weaving, carelessly 
done on a splint foundation, as among the Utes. Height, 7i inches. 
There are no lugs on the outside, so this piece would be a pitcher 
rather than a canteen. 

Fig. 3, Cat. No. 10758, is a Tsai a wats of squat form in single-rod 
coiled weaving,with three lugs at equal distances around the shoulder 
for carrying. Height, 4f inches. 

Figs. 4 and 5, Cat. Nos. 213101-2, in the U. S. National Museum, 
are small canteens, collected from the Havasupai Indians, in Cat- 
aract Canyon, by Dr. Walter Hough. They are precisely the same 
in structure as the foregoing, though the Havasupai are of the Yuman 
family, while the Utes are Shoshonean. Height, 7i inches and 8i 
inches. 

Fig. 6, Cat. No. 211020, U.S.N.M., is Paiute water jar for carrying, 
from the collection of Captain Carr, U. S. Army. The foundation is 
of splints, and the pitch is carefully restricted to the inside. Horse- 
hair lugs support the headl)and of old leather. Pleight, 9 inches. 

Fig. 7, Cat. No. 11880, U.S.N.M., is an excellent specimen of twined 
work in twill, with single rows of three-ply twine and the neck in 
openwork. In many examples like the one here shown the melted 
pitch or asphaltum is poured inside and rinsed around until the sur- 
face is covered. Height, 9 inches. The rope handle gives the appear- 
ance of a pitcher. 

Fig. 8, Cat. No. 10750, U.S.N.M., is pear shaped and has wooden 
lugs upon the sides for the cai'rying bands. It is twined and twilled 
weaving and thoroughly overloaded with pitch. The rounded l)ottom 
serves to keep the bottle erect. Height, 8i inches. 

Plate 33 is a water jar of the White Mountain Apaches, Cat. No. 
213278, U.S.N.M., collected by Dr. Walter Hough. It is made in 
diagonal twined weaving and covered with pitch. Three lugs of wood 
attached to the sides are for the purpose of suspension and carrying. 
The height is 12 inches. 

BORDERS ON BASKETRY 

Having studied the structural processes on the body of these textiles, 
it will now be in order to note how the work is finished off. A glance 
at a lady's workbasket or a waste-paper basket shows how important 



2()0 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MURETTM, 1902. 



such an examination must ))g. Both in woven and in twined ware 
many ])eautiful .specimens will be seen, whose edges differ not in the 
slightest degree f I'om other portions of the basket. Indeed, the Tlin- 
kit, the Porno, and the Mission weavers all frec^uently affect the plain 
border on their ware, and certain kinds of plaques of the Hopi 
Indians, said to be the workmanship of unmarried women, leave the 
foundation exposed, and the work is suddenly brought to an end. 

Another fact will surprise the student, namely, that technically the 
border is often in quite another class of weave. This grows, as will 
be seen, out of the (exigencies of the case. A checker weaving, with 
the edges left open all around, would l)e a flimsy affair. Coiled work 
lends a hand in putting a flnish on woven work; the latter, or an 
imitation of it, on the contrary, becomes an embellishment of the 
f oruKn-. The drawings and the plates will explain more clearly than 
words the structure of borders. The motive in this inquiry should be 
to learn the steps or e\'olutionarv processes through which the inge- 
nious savage Avoman's mind has 
])assed in this series of inven- 
tions to discover, if possible, a 
little truth about the relation- 
ship and communication among 
tribes in olden times, and to learn 
some new manipulations in an 
art now becoming popular. It 
is like the lireaking out of an old 
hereditar}' complaint in the tips 
of the lingers. The borders will 
be studied in the following-order: 
Thelinishingoff in checker work, 
in wicker work, in twilled work, in twined work, and in coiled work. 
The first and simplest method of making borders is illustrated in 
examples collected among the Abenaki Indians of Canada belonging 
to the ^Vlgonquian famih'. The baskets are made of splints from the 
ash, formerly worked out with aboriginal tools (see tig. 60), but 
nowadays made l)y machinery. The foundation of the borders con- 
sists of three narrow hoops. Ever}' alternate warp splint is cut off 
flush, the others are bent down over the middle hoop and pushed 
under the upper row of weaving, having first been pointed. Outside 
and inside of this middle hoop and clasping the bends in the warp 
splints are the other two hoops, the whole being bound securel}^ 
together by a coiled sewing in splint. The specimen here figured is 
Cat. No. 206390, U.S.N.M., made by Caroline Masta. Diameter, 5i 
inches; height, 3 inches. 

The border of twilled work, when the weaving is finished, resembles 
closely the interlacing of a series of crossed warps. In matting made

ends of the warp and of the weft are bent backward 

and forced under the texture. In one example a 

finished out with wicker weaving, both sets of ele- 

•aightened out for warp. (See fig. 12.) The margin is 

as if the whole mass had been in wicker weaving. The 

hown was made recently by an Indian woman in the 

estern New Mexico. (See fig. <;i.) The material is 

of yucca, from which coarse mats, l)asket bowls, and 

The mat is woven square and a lioop of wood is pro-

vided for the border. The mat is forced down into it, the ends of the 
warp and w eft cut off about an inch above the hoop. They are then 
bent down on the outside in groups of fours and held in place with 
one row of twined weaving, as shown in the accompanying drawing, 
giving both front and back view. The basket is the gift of Mr. G. B. 
Raggett. Diameter, 11 inches. Cat. No. 2151:88, U.S.N.M. 

In the simplest forms of wicker work the ends of the warp are all 
cut off in uniform lengths and each bent down by the side of the next 
warp, or behind one warp and down beside the second warp, or is 
woven behind and in front of the other warp stems with greater or

less intricacy, forming a rope pattern on the outside. So much of 
wicker basketry as orio-inated with the Indians is very simple in the 
matter of finishing. Cat. No. 215487 shows how this sort of work is 
done. The basket is the work of the Zuiii Indians, New Mexico, and 
is the gift of Mr. G. B. Ilaggett. Diameter, i)^ inches. (See fig. 62.)

they have adopted it. This drawing is made from specimens in the 
collection of G. Wharton James. (See fig. 03.)

In the next example the handle is a stifi' splint of hickor)% circular 
in shape. The wide hoop l)order shown in the drawing and the circu- 
lar hoop are the frame-work from which the weave begins. All the 
smaller warp elements focus at the junction of these two. The widen- 
ing is ett'ected by the introduction of fresh warp elements as the work 
proceeds; the weft makes only a .short excursion at the beginning

work widens and additional warp elements are inserted. This specimen 
is Cat. No. 21455S, U.S.N.M., and was collected by Mrs. C. (i. Bon- 
jamin from the Moravian settle- 
ment, North Carolina. Diam- 
eter, 5f inches. (See fig. (J-t.) 

The term twined basketry is 
applied to every variety whose 
warp elements are held together 
l)y twined weaving. The warp 
is either soft 1i lament, or hard- 
wood splints, or roots. The weft 
likewise may l)e yarn of Hax. 
wool, or other very plial)le ma- 
terial, or it may he rigid splints 
from roots or tough .young wood, 
such as osier, red l)ud, sumac, 
or the like. Such a ^'ariet3^ of 
material will demand in the hnisliinj. 
Lieutenant Emmons speaks of th(^ l)order of the basket as its life and 
says that while a rent in the side or bottom of a wallet may l)e sewed 
^ .,-_.^,^«^ ,,^«"»:.^ with fresh root, the breaking of 
i- ,.\ .^i^ >- fj^Q edge suggests at once to the 

woman the gathering of niaterials 
for a new basket. The great va- 
riety of borders in this type of 
weaving can be best understood 
by studying specimens. It will 
)>e interesting to begin this by 
comparing examples from two 
widely separated areas, namely, 
the caves of Kentucky and the 
distant islands of the Aleutian 
chain, both in soft warp. (See 
Plate Un.)

quarter of an inch to an inch apart. At the toj), where the twined 
work finishes, the warp cords are brought together in groups of five 

and twisted into a rope for a 
short distance. They are then 
gathered into a continuous 
braid; the ends of those plaited 
in are cut off when the ends of 
a new set are taken up. This 
very elaborate form of border 
will also be found later on in 
Washington. (See fig. 65.) 

The methods of finishing 
borders on twined work among 
the Salishan tribes are shown 
ill the accompanying figure. 
The Quinaielt wallet (Cat. No. 
127843, U.S.N.M., collected 
by Charles Willoughby), has 
several noteworthy character- 
istics. The twined weft is ver- 
tical, woven over a frail warp. 
At the upper margin are out- 
side strengthening rows of 
close-twined work. Finally, 
the two ends of each vertical 
weft element are brought to- 
gether as one, bent backward 
behind the two preceding ones, then forward under a row of twined 
weaving, serving to hold them in place, the loose end showing on 
the inside. (See fig. 6Q.) 

Turning now to twined weav- 
ing on hard foundation, it will 
be a matter of surprise that the 
Porno Indians, who make some 
of the finest twined basketry in 
the world, take no pains in fin- 
ishing off' the upper margin of 
many pieces. Cat. No. 165659, 
U.S.N.M., is a basket of the 
Porno Indians, collected for the 
Bureau of Ethnology by H. W. 
Henshaw. Diameter, 11 inches. 
(See fig. 67 and Plate 19.) 

The weaving is done when the material is wet and soft, and in dry- 
ing the weft shriidvs and binds itself to the warp, so that the basket

actiialh" wears out before it unravels, (xraiiarv ])iiskets, mill hoppers, 
mush bowls, and other varieties in common use have this sort of mar- 
gin. In the drawing- here shown the weft is su])posed to Ix' untwisted, 
and the whole is enlarged in order toexhilnt the texture, ^^'hen com- 
plete the warp is driven close together and the little sticks of alder or 
willow forming the warp are left 
protruding. 

In the following illustration the 
same principle obtains of making 
little or no change in the finishing. 
but the technic is three-strand instead 
of two-strand. The figure repi-esents 
a section of a meal l>owl of the C Vyal 
Pomo, Cat. No. 2();328T. r.S.N.M.. 
which was collected by .1. A^'. Hud- 
son. (See tig. ()S.) 

Plate 3-i makes evident the dilier- 
ence between the plain twined bor- 
der and the three-strand border. In the upper ligure the inside of the 
basket is exhil)ited and the effect is that of common two-strand twine, 
but in the lower figure the three-strand twine a])pears in a single i-ow 
of weaving on the upper border. The cutting of!' of the margin is 
also shown. It is to he undei-stood that the trimming of the ends 

of the warp stems is not done 
until all tlie weaving is entirely 
finished. 

The Hupa Indians in some 
cases finish the bordi^rs of twined 
work by bending down the ends 
of the war}) and wrapping or 
seizing them with splints of wil- 
low or other tough material. An 
inch of the border in a l)asket of 
the liay collection in the U. S. 
National Museum is shown. (See 
hg. 00 and Plate ITO.) 

Another example of this wov- 
en and coiled work is shown. 
The l)asket (Cat. No. 08491, 
U.S.N.M.) is the work of the 
Zufii Indians of New Mexico. It will be seen that the last row of 
weaving at the top is three-strand. Th(> warp rods or stems extend a 
little wa3's upward, then bend sharply to the left. They are then cut 
so that there will be always three of them included. The coil or seiz- 
ing of splints holds them all tii-mly in place. The top of the basket 
nie^sures 4^ inches in diameter. (See fig. TO.)

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 



The McCloud River Indians in Shasta County, California, cut off the 
warp flush and finish the border with what looks like plain twined 
weaving on the edge, but a regular half knot is tied between each pair 
of warp stems. 

Fig. 71 shows a bonhu- of Paiute Indian twined basket, in which the 
warp rods oi" stems are ))eiit to the left at right angles and cut oQ 

af t(»r passing two or more stems, 
tlie objeet Ixung to have at least 
three ends in a })unch forming 
the foundation of the l)order. 
The luiiting material is a long 
splint of willow or rhus, pass- 
ing to the left, up and around 
the foundation in front of the 
standing part, and under the up- 
per foundation stem backward, 
forward to begin another series. 
It is in fact an application of the 
half hitch or button-hole stitch. 
When these are drawn tight they form an effective border which on 
the upper margin has all the appearance of a four-plv braid. The 
basket itself is an example of twined weaving in twilled style, and 
shaped something like an inunense strawberry. 

This same process of imitating braid on the border of a basket by 
the ingenious wrapping of a single splint ))ecomes much more com- 
plex in coiled basketry, as will be seen later in many figures.

Alaska, and the Ilaida Indians, on the Queen Charlotte xsiands. 
Neither of these great families use eoiled work, and they emplo}^ little 
of other types of weaving' than the twined. The Tlinkits are more 
ornamental and use colored grasses in their false embroider}^, while 
the Ilaidas n(>ver employ such decorations, ])ut excel in plain and 
diagonal twined work and in 8-strand weaving. Lieut, (x. T. Ennnons, 
IT. S. Na\y," has studied these people closely foi- many years, and the 
information regarding the borders of these tribes isdcrive(l Ti-oni him. 
According to this authority, fully ninc^-tenths of all the baskets used 
by th(^ Tliidvits are of the open cylindrical type, in which the border is 
called ui)()n to sustain more than its })roporti()n of the wear in use. 
Some tribes have always used certain trinnnings, plaitings, or braidings 
to the exclusion of others, and the work of diti'erent periods within 
tribal limits shows niai-k(Ml })i-efei-ences. Two principal methods are 
employed in the finish of the l»()i-d(>r edge, (1) l)y trinunijig otf the waip

ends flush with the last spiral of weave (see Plate 44), and (2) b}^ turn- 
ing the warp over and fastening it down to the standing part by twined 
weaving or braiding. The tirst system is always used with covered 
baskets and generally with dou])le baskets, wdiere the two borders give 
protection to each other, with hats and mats, juid generally with all types 
of baskets made for the tourist trade. The second method is emplo3M^.d 
in all open ])askets made for use and in the finer varieties with double 
warp. When extreme nicety is required, the inner strand or layer of 
the double warp is cut oti' two lines of weave below the top, so that 
when the outer strand is turned down on the standing half the thick- 
ness of the border is not increased beyond that of the regular walls. 
But whether the warp is cut ofl" flush or turned over, the last few 
spinds of weave are generalU^ strengthened l)y additional twining, 
braiding, sennit, or embroidery. There are a few examples in the

This braided warp is held together 1)}' rows of twined weaving. 

1. The crudest border, or really want of border, consists in cutting 
off the ends of the warp even with the last spiral of two-strand weft. 
This is universally practiced with the covered work basket, and is often 
the finish of the smaller double ])asket. (See fig. 67.) 

2. Border with the warp ends cut oft' fiush, the one or more rows of

3. In the third type of border a two-strand twine is laid vertically 
against the outside of the warp stems and held in place by another two- 
strand twine passing through the vertical twine and around the back 
of the wai-p stems. The vertical twine appears only on the outside of 
the ]>asket. The horizontal twine is seen on the outside and the inside 
alike. (See fig. 73.) 

4. In the fourth type of border a two-strand twine is ornamented on 
the outside with false eml)roidery precisely as on the l)ody. In some 
cases a narrow band of this st3de of weaving occurs at the upper 
margin and is decorative as well as useful.

ished at the border by cutting oft' the warp ends fiush and weaving a

in use b}' the Haida in basketry, and may have been borrowed from 
them. (See fig, 75.) 

7. In all open baskets made for use where strength is of primary 
importance the warp ends arc doubled over on the standing part of 
the next warp splint in the direction of the weave, that is, to the right, 
and twined down to it with the weft. This finish is found on the old- 
est pieces of Yakutat work. It is often strengthened by the overlaid 
embroidery in straw or root around the last few spirals of weave. A 
number of technical processes employed when the warp is cut off flush

will be found also on the borders of speciuiens in which the warp is 
turned down. 

8. With the turning down of the warp strands the three-strand woof 
twining is sometimes used in the place of the two strand.

basket used as a work basket in weaving and as a berry screener, con-

weaving a two-strand twining over the bights, forming a rope-like twist 
over the outer edge, and thoroughly protecting the more exposed parts 
of the warp. This character of finish occurs more among the Sitka, 
Hoonah. and Hootz ah tar tribes. The Chilcat never used it and the 
Yakutat only in the case of the basket-worker's basket. It is certainly 
of more recent date, although not of to-da3^ (See fig. 76.)

one of the three meml)ers of the braid passes behind the warp, the

of which hammocks and other weaves without foundation are examples, 
is finished off by simply stopping- the work. The same would be true 
in all the varieties of foundation mentioned in the previous section. 
In the present example the foundation consists of tlireo rods or stems 
not set in triangular fashion, as in the best Pomo coiled work, but in a 
vertical series. This maizes the rows much wider and economizes the 

sewing-. But the varieties of 
this type are as numerous as 
the tril)es of Indians practicing 
coiled weaving. (See fig. 82.) 
Fig. 83 illustrates the same 
statement already made with 
reference to the so-called grass- 
hopper basket (Plate 24). The 
drawing shows how, with a 
splint foundation, the sewing 
material interlocks with the 
stitches underneath, taking up 
at the same time one or more 
splints. 

In Plate 23, illustrating bifur- 
cated stitches on a basket in the McLeod collection, will be seen the 
simplest departure from the ordinar}" coiled sewing on the border. 
The stitches pass forward one space, through and backward a space, 
making a herring-])ono effect on the upper edge of the basket. 

Plate 35, upper figure, illustrates a simple type of border work. 
The foundation is a bundle of splinters wrapped with splints of spruce 
root and sewed on here and 
there in regular order to the 
coil underneath, being bent 
between the stitches so as to 
form a regular simious line. 
On the next round the row is 
straight, wrapped like the first, 
and is sewed to the top of the 
sinuous coil underneath. On 
the top of all is another row, 
the bends not being so high, 
the lower portions being sewed 
to the joint of the other two. The border forms a series of lenticular 
openings, with a bar across the long diameter. This method of orna- 
mentation is not confined to one area, an Eskimo specimen from Davis 
Inlet, northern Labrador, collected by Lucian Turner, being made on 
substantially the same plan.

Fig-. 8J- is the border of a coiled basket collected amono- the Hopi 
Indirns by Victor Mindeleff, Cat. No. 84500, U.S.N.M. It will be 
seen that the foundatioii of the coiled work on the body of the 
basket consists of three rods on the same perpendicular plane. The 
stitch passes over the three; catches under one of the previous coils, 
the stitches interlocking-. In hnishing off this work a single rod is 
used for the niargiii or l)order. It is sewed to the upper rod of the 
previous foundation in plain 
coiled work; but while this proc- 
ess is going on a series of three 
splints are twined around ))oth 
the foundation and the stitches 
of the border, ^^'hen the whole 
is drawn tight it gives the ap- 
pearance of a very elal)orate

make the style more compre- 
hensible, a drawing from the ])order of Cat. No. 20-1883 is introduced,

The two examples just shown illustrate what was previously said about 
using twined work for the borders of coiled weave, and the opposite 
among the Tlinkits.

coiled splint on the outside of this. The ornamental border consists 
of an ordinary figure-of-eight wrapping, as in doing up a kite string, 
going from left to right. A splint passes under the foundation rod 
toward the front, and then forward five stitches over, behind, and

IV. ORNAMENTATION ON BASKETRY 

There's magic in the web of it: 
A sibyl that had numbered in the world 
The sun to make two hundred compasses, 
In her proplietic fury sewed the work. 

—Othello, III: 4. 

Onuimentatioii in and on l)ask('tiT is to be studied with three teach- 
ers or guides — the technician, the artist, and the folklorist. With 
the first named are learned the varied niatei-ials as to color and texture, 
the technical elements and tlieir forms, and the methods of assem])ling 
them. The artist will show how these elements, on the one hand, open 
possibilities for a'sthetic effects, and how, on the other hand, the 
stitches and decussations handicap attempts at free-hand drawing. 
The folklorist examines the pictography, the totemism, the lore and 
mythology of the ornamentation, with a view of putting the student 
into intellectual and spiritual relationship with the l)asket maker. 
Without her l)asket-making would ])e merely a trade or calling, and 
the art student would ))e utterly helpless in detecting the alphabet of 
design. This phase of the subject will be elaborated in the chapter on 
symbolism. 

Great help in this investigation would be derived from a visit to the 
humble artist to watch the processes through which the line effects 
have been elaborated. To this inquiry special attention will here be 
given. It should l)e added in passing that in producing her effects the 
basket maker nuist l)e fully ei^uipped for her work l)efore the ffrst 
stitch or check is attempted. The painter, the potter, and the sculp- 
tor may add tinishing touches or make corrections after the wovk is 
done, but the basket maker is like the musician — every detail in the 
production must be attended to correctly at the time. There is no 
chance to go Ijack and remedy defects. Decoration on basketry is 
studied under the following heads: 

A. Form and structure. 

Jj. Ornamentation through color. 

Form and color may Ije studied (1) on the l)asket as a whole; (2) on 
the minutest structural elements; and (8) in the designs upon the sur- 
-face. These will be taken up in order and treated in their relation to 
the sense of the beautiful, present in the humble Indian woman's mind 
as well as in those more reffned. (xrowth, progress from pure natural- 
ism to greater and greater artiffciality, ma}" be observed here <iuite as 
marked as in other activities. To illustrate what is here said by way 
of introduction, Plate 30 represents a coiled basket of the Mission 
Indians in the collection of G. Wharton James. The noteworthy 
characteristics of this l)asket l)owl are the effects produced by variety 
in designs and color in shades, as well as by symmetry of outline. 
The sharp contrast seen in the designs are due not to modern dyes, but 



280 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

to a skillful use of Nature's colors. Under the descriptions of materials 
attention was called to the vai"iety of natural pigmentation in tlie 
stems and roots of the plants used in the construction of the Mission 
work. The center of the specimen is in rectangles the colors of which 
alternate between white and dark hrown. The center zone is made up 
in straw color, white, and black; the third or outer zone in natural 
shades of the stem — white, brown, and black — with here and there spots 
of brown introduced into the straw-colored sewing. The outer edge 
is in brown and white. Anciently the Mission baskets were not nearly 
so gaudy looking, but among the frequent transformations in artistic 
forms and colors this example illustrates progress in the adoption of 
really beautiful motives of a high order. 

The elaboration of decoration in form first, and then of color, will 
now be taken up more minutely. The aesthetic side of this part of 
the sul)ject is so well explained by Holmes,'^' that it is here only neces- 
sary to make plain the technical elements and processes involved in 
ornamentation. 

As on Pueblo pottery, so on })asketry, some patterns are merely 
likenesses of things, and that is all. A step in advance of this is the 
portraiture of some particular and sacred natural feature, mountain, 
body of water, trait, etc. Pictography is one grade higher, and, 
beginning with attempts at figuring animals and plants entire, runs 
the whole gamut of transformation, ending with conventional meto- 
nymies, synecdoches, and geometric patterns of the classic type. 

FORM AND STRUCTURE 

Form in basketry is decided at the outset, not by the desire to create 
somethin'g artistic, but to produce a useful receptacle. There is 
scarce!}^ a basket so rude, however, that a sense of symmetr}" and other 
artistic qualities did not enter into its composition, both as to its gen- 
eral outline and the management of its details. These varied forms 
are decided in reality by: 

(a) Function, which is discussed in the chapter on uses, from the 
purely industrial point of view. 

(h) Materials, shown in the chapter on manufacture as to their 
variety and quality, but here considered as suggesting and restricting 
form. 

((') Imitation of natuial o])jects and of forms of utensils in other 
materials. 

{(l) Physiological limitations. Both in the making of the basket 
and in using it the Indian woman had ever in view the convenience of 
her own body. The curves of the basket itself, the length and width, 
the proportion of all its parts, as well as convenience of holding,

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 281 

transportino-, and utilizing-, all had reference to the woman's ])hysical 
frame. 

(e?) Aesthetic purpose. The desire to produce something beautiful 
in itself without any regard to other motives. 

If there l)e any })eauty in work lielonging- to the first step it is purely 
adve7it!tloHt<^ the weaver did not effect it purposely. In the next higher 
grade there are no separate elements of beauty, but the utilitarian 
features are dominated by taste purposely. A third class of aesthetic 
forms, one step higher, enhance the beauty of the l)asket, but do not 
diminish its serviceability. It seems a pity to waste so much pro- 
longed work and lovely design and color on a mere ])errypickingl)asket 
or a pot for cooking with hot stones, hut who will say nay? Finally, 
usefulness is ignored or sacrihced to pure aestheticism. (See Plates 11, 
23, 15, 70, and 71.) 

When the very lowly and practical functions of a great deal of this 
ware are considered one has a striking example of the way in which 
the sense of heauty may coexist with forlorn poverty and surround- 
ings, as may also he seen ])y comparing the most skillful hasket 
maker with her workshop. This thought uuist not be carried too 
far, however, in understanding- the culture status of the woman, since 
all artists are busy practically with uncleanly materials and do not 
wear their best attire in the studio. On this same practical side, also, 
the love of beauty for its own sake may not be the entire motive in 
the artist's mind; her natural ambition and pride of achievement in 
technical skill, and perhaps envy, have much to do with preeminent 
success — quite as much with her as with artists at the other end of 
civilization. The same discrimination is made by art critics in the 
highest walks of culture. The singer or musician who renders a 
technically difficult piece may l)e stimulated quite as nuich by pride 
of performance as by the overpowering influence of aesthetic feeling. 
It is difficult to sound the depths of the Indian woman's motives, but 
in the matter of shape, as will be seen, her masterpieces are fine models 
of symmetry and grace. Quite every plate in this paper will illustrate 
in some way or another what will be said r(\specting the ornamenta- 
tion of Indian basketry in the six geographic areas. In each one of 
the phases under which shape as a decorative element is studied there 
will be found a response in the different parts of the hemisphere. 

The study of form and structure in the ornamentation of basketry 
will be now considered under the heads named: First, the shape of the 
basket as a whole; second, the minute structural elements out of which 
all designs on basketry are formed, and third, the designs on the sur- 
face of the basket and their combination into symbols or composite 
ornamentations. (See Plate 37.) 



282 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 



SHAPES OF BASKETS AS A WHOLE 



The shapes of basketry have relation to the forms of solid geometry. 
The cube, the cone, the cylinder, the sphere, are the bases of all sim- 
ple and complicated varieties. In softer material basketry approaches 
mattino-. The products are then flat or pliable, although the process 
of manufacture is the same. Among the eastern tribes of the United 
States the Algoiikin and Iroquois baskets are all cylindrical or rect- 
angular in outline. The same is true of the tribes in the Southern 
United States, although the greater flexibilit}^ of the reed cane invites 
the basket weaver to a wider diversity. In the Interior Basin and 
everywhere else the wild flax and other tibrous plants abounded, the 
sack, rectangular in outline, prevailed, but in the western portions of 
Canada east of the Rocky Mountains the prevalence of birch bark 
occasioned a variety of solid forms. The Indians of the Interior 
Basin also eiuplo}^ the cylinder largely. The same is true of the 
Eskimo, of Alaska, while the Aleutian Islanders, especially in the 
outer islands, having the flexible wild grass to work with, return to 
the form of the bag or satchel. The cylinder and the rectangle pre- 
vail among the Haida and Tlinkit, while the soft wallet, rectangular 
in outline, were more common farther south. The Salish and other 
tribes of Indians, of Columbia and Washington, diversifled in their 
tribal and linguistic elements, produced many forms of baskets. 
Those in touch with the Hudson's Ba}^ Company were very quick to 
imitate the shapes of packages used b}" them. In this region, also, 
since the boiling with hot stones was a prevalent method of cooking, 
the basket pot, somewhat cylindrical in motive yet more in the form 
of a truncated cone, was seen in every house. What is said about the 
diversity of form among the Salish tribes is true all along the Pacific 
coast of the United States. Here also is to bo found the conical 
baskets in great abundance, since the people were partly vegetarians 
or diggers. The carrying basket is a prominent feature in collections 
from this area. From these simple geometric forms were developed 
dishes, jars, ])ottles, packing cases, and so on, in unlimited numbers, 
combining the cylinder, the cone, and the rectangle. In many of 
these the jar-shaped necks of pottery are imitated, in which the 
elements of the sphere and the spheroid are used. 

In giving the forms just indicated to basketry the Indian woman has 
always in mind the elements of the beautiful as well as of the useful. 
It is considered a reproach to violate the I'ules of bilateral symmetry or 
proportion in form. A superficial view of a large collection of baskets 
from any portion of America would strike the most careless observer as 
the fruits of thoughtful and painstaking labor on {esthetic lines. These 
forms are often said to be mere imitations of something the savage 
woman has seen in nature or in other arts. Imitation is indeed one 
of the elements in this problem, but it is an entire misconception of 



AHORiciiNAL amp:rican uasketky. ^83 

the underlying plan to suppose that the .skillful weaver is a slave to 
natural patterns. Indeed, it might also be averred that she is less 
subservient to such things than artisans of much higher grade. On 
entering the workshops of civilization one sees the walls loaded with 
designs and models after which to work, but rarely would the observer 
see an Indian woman looking to any other source than her own 
imagination for the model of her basket; strictl}' speaking, she never 
makes two alike. A close observation of the wea\er at her work 
demonstrates the fact that the eye, the hand, the curves of the body, 
the angles of the lower limbs, all contribute their share to giving 
beautiful forms to basketry. The following illustrations will show 
the gradaticjns of general outline through which l)asketry passes, the 
maker keeping always in mind the sense of pleasure to be awakened 
or gratified. 

They are as follows: a^ flat forms; h^ dish forms; c, bowl forms; 
d, jar forms; and e, miscellaneous forms. 

{(() The simplest of these is the flat tray, mat, wallet, sail, gambling 
plaque, and more. They assume endless varieties of outline, and 
through the stimulus of trade all sorts of shapes result, table mats of 
standard patterns in 8itka and Vancouver Island, rectangular wallets 
in Washington, Idaho, and Montana, Init especially the gambling 
plaques of California. 

Plate 38 shows two flat plaques of this form, the upper one from 
the Tule River country, Tulare County, California, the lower one 
from Madera County, both in the collection of E. L. McLeod, of 
Bakerstield, California. The coiling, if well done, would produce the 
circular outline. The Indian woman who constructed the plaque 
made the stitches under the spell of this art motive. A number of 
additional (examples of artistic forms in flat basketry will be found in 
Plates 6 and 01. « 

(h) Use cooperates with beauty in deepening the basket into a shal- 
low plate as among the Hopi (Moki) for the sacred meal in their pra}' er 
ceremonials, but more attractive still are the so-called Navaho cere- 
monial baskets. (See Plate 39)- These beautiful o])jects have attracted 
much attention also through their association with Navaho ceremonies. 
They are called ghost drums, wedding baskets, and various other 
names, all associated with the Navaho religion. Tlie dish baskets shown 
in the plate are in the collection of Fred Harvey. The same form 
exists along the Pacific States wherever meal or other vegetal diet is 
eaten. The}' are the common dish in which the mush is served 
throughout the acorn-bearing parts of California. It is an excellent 
example of adaptation to use, consistent at the same time with correct 
aesthetic expression. Doing her best in producing the proper form

284 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

she was not hampered by the fear of lessening utility. Figures of 
similar shapes will be seen in Plates 93, 216. 

(c) Deepening the plate or dish gives the bowl an unlimited number 
of forms and emancipates the basket maker. All through the south- 
western United States the olla is the prevailing form. It is a segment 
cut from a sphere, marvelous in s^^mmetry when the production of a 
master hand. Departing from this simple outline, varieties are pro- 
duced ))v flattening the bottom and straightening the body until the 
truncated cone and regular cylinder are reached. The quality of the 
material used may have a little to do with the general outline, but it 
is charming to see how easil}" the savage woman overcomes the obsti- 
nacy of nature and persuades reluctant wood to do the work of grass 
and soft libers. Cylindrical forms are in favor with the Aleuts, with 
the Haidas of Queen Charlotte Islands, with the Tlinkits of south- 
eastern Alaska, and some tribes in Washington and Oregon. In the 
eastern parts of Canada and the United States cylindrical forms are 
mixed with rectangular. The baskets shown in Plate -lO are in the 
collection of E. L. McLeod, of Bakersfield, California. These are all 
from Kern County, and include hats as well as domestic forms. It will 
be noticed that some of the examples have straight conical bodies 
and others are curved outward, but none are incurved. As models 
for modern basketry these shapes can not l)e iniproved upon, since 
they are grounded in the structure of the human body itself. Refer- 
ence will be again made to the baskets in this plate when the elemen- 
tary forms are studied that go to make up the designs. The photograph 
does but half justice to the basketry from this region, which adds to 
the beauty of outline and variety of design the charms of tints and 
colors in varied materials. 

(d) Baskets with constricted borders go I)}' the general name of 
bottlenecks. If a motif be sought outside the desire of the Indian 
artist to have it thus, there is a style of old Puelilo pottery at hand 
which stands preeminent in southwestern United States." After the 
body of the vessel or basket is built up to the required height the 
work is drawn into the form of a jar or bottle. Attention has already 
been called to the fact that no pottery existed formerl}" on the west 
coast of North America. The few exceptions to this rule only intensify 
this absence. The place of pottery is taken by basketry, even for 
cooking. There is no limit to the pine trees yielding gum which will 
render basketry water-tight. The bottle-shaped basket soon appears 
and is installed as Aquarius of the Utes, the Apache, and other tribes 
and as a seed vessel. No sooner was its office fixed than it began to dress 
up in artistic form, and the inimitable bottleneck of the Panamint and 
other tribes in the Inyo-Kern and Tulare area appeared. The Apaches

are havino- the la.st word at this point in the adoption of correct a?sthetic 
forms purely European. Plate 41 shows a group of Kern Count}^ 
bottlenecks in the collection of E. L. McLeod. Plate 4:^2 illustrates a 
lot of Apache ollas in the collection of J. W. Benham, of New York 
City. 

That these pretty jar shapes have little sio-niticance so far as tribes 
are concerned is shown by the fact that they occur all the way from 
Point Barrow in Alaska to southern California. 

(e) This class includes all odd forms whatever. The}^ are frequently 
made in imitation of objects that struck the Indian woman's fancy. 
The very best examples of this are the imliricated l)askets of the 
Eraser-Columbia drainage. A good collection of them tells the whole 
story accuratel}', starting from the conical forms, with foundation of 
splints and bottoms in shape of a watch spring to ))e found on the 
Klikitat and the Thompson Kiver and ending below and al)ove the 
Eraser mouth with Hat and uniform foundation and straight lines in

so on. These ])izarre shapes are not contined to the mere imitation 
of white men's devicc^s. The demands of ceremony and religion 
re(iuired special forms of basketr}'. (See Plates 4;), 1.57-17!^.) 

Einally, ornamentation in th(» form of the basket as a whole has 
kei)t ]jace with the nudtiplication of uses. The tirst contact of the 
Indians with the whites created new desires in their minds. Eurther- 
more, it was not long before they discovered their best interests to lie 
in the direction of service to their conquerors. The supply of new 
wants and responses to the demands just mentioned would necessarily 
break in upon the ancient regime. Not at tirst, however, did the new 
object respond to the best workmanship. Plate 44 represents a i^art 
of the outfit of a Tlinkit Indian in the service of the Russians. Among 
his other accouterments there must be a receptacle for ammunition. 
This nuist conform to those already in use. The result is the three 
forms shown in the plate. Eirst, a small jar-shaped holder with a bas- 
ketry cap-like cover; second, a bullet holder, in which the one basket 
fits exactly over another; third, a combination in which the cover is 
attached to the basket l)y means of a running string. All of these 
forms are shown in the plate. While draw ing attention to these de- 
signs it will be well to examine their characteristics. The cover of No. 
2 is plain twined weaving of the old-fashioned sort. The attractive- 
ness of the work is in its regularity. ))oth of vertical lines and hori- 
zontal weaving. The under portion of this double l)asket is covered 
over with false embroidery designs. No. 1 is an evident departure 
from ancient shapes, and the surface is covered with poor work in 
embroidery. No. 3 is more worthy of scrutiny. On the outer bas- 
ket, or cover, plain weaving and eml)roidery alternate in single lines

and narrow bands. The lower, or inside, basket has its surface envel- 
oped in embroidered weaving of excellent character and is wrought in 
three colors. The specimen is in the collection of L. H. Brittin, of 
Edgewater, New Jersey. 

MOSAIC ELEMENTS IN DECORATION 

The composition of the basket, its molecular elements, so to speak, 
is guided largely by the materials. In cross section they are in their 
coarsest forms round, then half round, resulting from splitting whole 
stems. The finer sorts arise from further subdivision of stems, being 
roundish on the outside and flat within; or flat on both surfaces, as 
in the Canadian ash splints and the flat foundations of Fraser River 
baskets; or ribl)on-like, as in basketry made of palm leaves; or thread- 
like, as in the coiled basketry of the Pomo, sewed with split sedge 
root as fine as pack thread. These various kinds and grades of mate- 
rials in their tractability are dependent on climate, latitude, and ph3"to- 
geography in the first place, and finally upon the maker's grade of 
culture, on the form and function she had in mind, as well as on the 
higher forms of fine art, social rivab-y, and mytholog3\ (See Plate 45.) 

In ultimate structure, basketry is free-hand mosaic or, in finest 
materials, like pen drawings or beadwork, the surface being composed 
of any number of small parts — technically decussations, stitches, or 
meshes, practically separate from one another so far as tlie effect on 
the eye is concerned. These mosaic parts are with some materials 
quite flat on the outer surface, as in the ])est matting and bags, while 
in others they stand out on account of the coarseness and rigidity of 
the wood. The object of mosaic ordinarih^ is to produce aflat surface 
for pavements or floors. The term " mosaic," here used as a simile, 
applies to such as is seen in mural decoration, where projections and 
depressions are wrought into artistic designs. In nmch basketry the 
separation of the stitches and exposure of a warp l)eneath having 
another color have precisely the same effect. In many examples the 
stems and roots are thoroughly soaked and rendered plastic and then 
pressed home, the parts being forced together, in which case the little 
elements become spindle-formed or hexagonal. Mosaic effects in 
basketry may be — (a) Tessellate, as in checker or twilled weaving; 
(h) concentric, as in wicker and twined weaving, and (c) radiate in all 
coiled weaving. These must be kept in mind. 

Unity in variet}^, the underlying principle of all a\sthetic composi- 
tion, finds its first step illustrated in the making up of a basket. The 
perfection of an Indian basket in its artistic technic is monotony, or 
monotechny, if such a word existed. In looking at a clumsy bit of 
work done by a child, or a beginner, one is aware of painstaking 
efl'ort to make all the checks or stitches alike, ending in failure. In 
the most elegant pieces the victory is won, unity is achieved. With

her mouth for a vise and other i)urposes, with a Unit knife, and the 
educated fingers, the patient and skillful artist formerly brought all 
her filaments to uniform thickness. At present scissors, awls, knives, 
and gauges (all of mejal) aid her immensely in her task. The eyes 
and hands cooperating, in some instances through a hundred thousand 
efforts, produce elements of astonishing uniformity. This unity is of 
a ver>' high order; for in many examples, cou])led with a monoton}^ of 
elements absolutely undei" control of the artist there is at the same 
time a charming variation in width and length of parts in harmony 
with, and made necessaiy l)V, the wideinng and narrowing of the 
basket. This unity in a myriad of details is tiie more noteworthy in a 
basket-maker's art, in conunon with that of all other textile workers, 
because the individual elements are not lost or destroyed in the opera- 
tion. The exceptions to this are rare, as in a few California speci- 
mens, where the coiled sewing is entirely obscured ])y overlaying of 
feathers. Usually the perfection of the stitch is the aim of the worker. 

Plate 4(i is a rare coiled ))asket made by a Washoe woman named- 
Datsolalee. It is in the collection of A. Cohn, Carson City, Nevada. 
The piece measures Si inches high, is 12 inches wide, and »i inches 
wide at the opening. The stitches nuiulxn- over .'')(),< )()(), being thirty 
to the inch. The body color is a rich light gold, and the figures are 
in red and Idack. It weighs IG ounces, and is valued at many hun- 
dreds of dollars. The figures on the basket represent ])irds migrating 
or flying away, the motto l)eing, "When the birds leave their nests 
and fly awa}', we shall move." The shape of this i)iece and the (juality 
of the sentiment in the markings are excelled only b}^ the inimitable 
quality of the work on the surface. It is difficult to conceive of a 
more perfectly uniform piece of handiwork than this. 

In pottery all vestiges of coiling and molds are commonly ol)liter- 
ated. In a very few examples of ancient ware there seems to have 
))een an aim to perfect the coiling and render its detail monotonous 
and artistic, ))ut in the many thousands of other examples the potter 
has erased the marks of the fingers, the paddle, and the mold. On 
the other hand, the whole development of the art of l)asketrv has been 
an effort to perfect the individual stitch, or mesh, or check, if neces- 
sary to make any nund)er of thousands of them exactly alike over the 
entire surface of a large recei)tacle, or to study the greatest possible 
number of variations that may be given in form to these primary ele- 
ments consistent with the unity of the whole efiect. The Eskimo near 
the mouth of the Yukon must have only lately acquired the art of 
basket making. With coarse hay for the foundation and sinew for 
thread they produce the clumsiest excuses for basketry, ugly in form, 
slovenly in stitching, and utterly devoid of designs on the surface, 
while the Aleuts, close hj, have unique elementary forms and work 
W'ith surprising uniformity. With the monotony or uniformity of

the mosaic elements in anj^ basket one must not fall into the error of 
thinking that there is not the greatest variet}' of fundamental shapes 
in the things to be monotonized. The}' vary in outline and relief in 
position with reference to the horizon; that is^ the rim of the basket, 
in relative proportion to the whole and its parts. 

In checkerwork the basketrj' tiles, one 
might call them, keeping in mind the 
use of the word mosaic, are squares or 
rectangles in close or open work. The 
mosaic of checkerwork pleases by its 
uniformity, and 3'et many baskets made 
l)y hand with tools not over refined have 
in them enough of variety to relieve 
them from the dull monotony in machine 
products. Flexibility in materials, as 
between hard-wood splints and those of 
cedar bark and palm leaf, offers all the chance the weaver needs to 
pla}' tricks in reliefs. The eye is never wearied in rambling up and 
down among these crooked paths. There is possibility of variety even 
in checkerwork, through changing the widtli of warp and weft ele- 
ments. 01)long rectangles there mingle with tiny or larger squares in 
tessellated surfaces. (See Plate 14 and figs. Itt; and i>7.)

TWILLED WORK IN TWO

from a drawing after Frank H. Cushino-. The surface of the liasket 
is mosaic in two colors, made up of little square blocks, and bj- their 
alternation not only sloping and vertical patterns are produced, but 
the most intricate labyrinth of fretwork. Thert^ is no limit to the pos- 
sibilities any more than there is to the Italian 
workman making a tessellated pavement with 
marble blocks in white and black. 

As soon as the weaver steps outside of her 
monotonous checkerwork into the province of 
wicker, or especially twilled weaving, the 
possibilities of ornamentation are intinitely 
nudti})licd. In plain weave, wicker elements 
are sigmoid or spindle-shaped; on twilled wc^aA- 
ing, they are oldong rectangles. Passing into 
the most intricate damask etfects in modern 
linen weaving, in which materials of one color 
onl}" have to be used, it will be seen how 
greatly varied this sort of ornamentation may 
be made. The elements of wickerwork mosaic 
are horizontal, but twilled Aveaving, in single elements may be both ver- 
tical and horizontal in the same piece. The three accompanying figures 
are from Holmes and show better than words the possi))ilities of the 
little s(iuares and rectangles for decoration. In tig. D-t in two colors 
the white work is under two and over one; the weft over one, two, or 

three and under one; the result being a series 
of sloping designs of great beauty. Fig. 05 
in precisely the same materials shows how 
])y \'arying the count the pattern is changed. 
Fig. IM) is interesting because it exhi])its a 
widespread type of mat weaving farthest 
away from loom work. The woman begins 
at the corner to weave. All the little blocks 
are rectangles; all stop at the same angle, 
and the result is a perfect Greek fret in two 
coloi's. (See Plate 47.) 

In twined weaving the effect of the single 
rows is funicular one way and corrugated 
the other. If the reader will notice any 
number of twined baskets in plain twined 
weave, it will at once become apparent that 
it has its limitations. The Pomo make only bands in it to represent 
the skin of a snake or some such motive. The Haida and Tlinkit 
vary the ribbed effect with decorative overlaying or three-strand weft. 
With the diagonal twined work the case is entirely different. The 
boldest of spiral designs covering an immense surface are wrought

in weaving in twilled fashion. Nothing- can excel the Porno, Pit 
River, and other northern California carrying baskets in attractive- 
ness of decoration. In openwork twining, where the warp has a 
chance to show its versatility, as in mound-builders' ware, but especially 
in Aleutian wallets, the pleasing effects in a single color are without 
end. For examples of the great variety' in twined-work decoration 
see Plates 19, 21, and 48. 

Plate -18, illustrating twined decoration in its elements is a repre- 
sentation of food bowls of the Klamath Indians of southern Oregon. 
These old specimens were among the first received at the U. S. 
National Museum and Avere collected by George Gibbs, Cat. No. 7568, 
U.S.N.M. The resources of ornamentation used by the Klamath 
Indians are fine stems and rods for the fiber, difi'erent colors in the 
wood, and superadded elements for decoration. Much of their work

is done in soft material and in the type of overlaying used by them 
the ends are fastened off carelessly on the inside of the structure so 
as to give a rough appearance. 

Further illustrations of Klamath ornamentation, as well as that of 
their kindred, the Modocs, will be found in Plates 167, 17-1. 

One of the prettiest and boldest attempts at securing effects in 
twined weave in the U. S. National Museum is from the vast ceme- 
tery of Ancon in Peru. The illustration (fig. 97) shows the decorative 
belt on a small workbasket made from rushes. One might be deceived 
into thinking that the motive came from the Yokut Indians of Cali- 
fornia (figs. 98 and 99), Itut a glance at the texture reveals a different 
method of achieving the same result. The warp is double, consisting 
of two straws side by side as in the Aleut wallets. At the bottom are 
three rows of plain twined weaving, each twist inclosing two warps. 



ABOEIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 



291 



Follow these pairs up to the top of the basket and note that the two 
rows of twined weaving — one dark, the other light — also inclose pairs, 
])ut not the same pairs, between the single twinings. Here seven 
human figures are woven in black on a lirown ground. The pairs are 
holding- in their hands between them a rhomboid ol)ject, reminding 
one of an Iroquois wampum belt in which two warriors are shown as 
Ibearing the sacred pipe. The weaving on this space is twilled mixed 
"with twined, the latter being subservient to the former. The warp 
elements no longer are worked in pairs, but singh^ The twined 
weaving on them is twilled on the brown body surface and vertical 
across the black rectangles, making the double warp conform to the 
twined weaving below everywhere save on the feet. All this is finger 
w ork and deserves a prize for its maker both for the plan and the size 
of the molecules.

Coiled basketry, on the contrary, is made up of radial elements 
only, which are the stitches, some being long and thin, others short 
and wide. The a\sthetic efl'ects depend on the quality of the material. 
The very coarsest ware of the Utes and the Klondike nations has little 
beauty of texture, while that of the Alaskan Tinne or the California 
Washoe, Panamint, or Porno is faultless. In finer coiled work, when 
the stitches barely interlock, they appear to stand one over another 
from row to row; but when the stitches pass underneath one of the 
rods at least of the foundation below there is an alternation of stitches 
with open spaces on the surface resembling twilled weaving, each one 
being wedged between two, over and under. It is impossible to ti-ace 
any ornamentation in coiled work among the eastern Indians of North

America through lack of material. The Arctic Alaskan coiled basketry 
also is lacking in color features. It is not until the Salish tribes 
of British Columbia are I'eached that attempts are made to produce 
beautiful effects in the primitive coiled elements of ornamentation. 
The resources of the artist are fourfold. 

(1) Her regular stitches are in tough root splints coiled in such manner 
that the smooth outer surface of the last year's growth is exposed to 
view. Seldom will the rough inner splints which constitute the

foundation come into sight through or between the stitches, Indeed, 
there is a type of weaving in this area in which smooth, thin strips of 
wood are laid together in pairs so that when the warp is exposed it is 
the bright outer surface that is seen. The Salish woman is not back- 
ward in making most of her opportunities with the dull brown color 
of the cedar in that she has learned to practice uniformity in the 
stitches themselves. 

(2) Mention has already been made of splitting stitches in the sew-

iiio- of these savage women. It is done in such a careful manner that 
it becomes an element of beauty, otherwise it would become a contri- 
bution to ugliness. Examples of this work will be seen in Plate 24. 

(3) Another resource of ornamentation in the elementary American 
work of coiled ))asketry has been well used by the ISalish Indians — 
that is the so-called beading-, which consists in running- a strip of l>right 
grass in and out among- the coiled stitches at regular intervals. Many 
examples of brown cedar sewing- with l)right golden-colored straws 
for the beading- are in the U. S. National Museum. This arrests the 
radial effect of the coil stitches and substitutes tlie concentric or 
parsillel motif.

(4) The last elementary resource referred to among the Salish tribe 
is imbrication, which will be more minutely descriV)ed in the section 
devoted to color in ornamentation. The sewing on such s})ecimens is 
entirely ol)literated and the surface reconstructed in A'ellow, red, ])rown, 
and wood color, the effect being tesselate mosaic. 

Among the California tribes these coiled elements, being much 
smaller in size than those in the ])askets of the Salish tribes, afforded 
opportunity for different artistic effects. An inspection of the work 
done by Pomo, Maidu, and other tribes of northern California shown 
in many plates and figures will prove this. 

Fig. 98 is from the surface of a beautiful coiled basket of the Tulare 
Indians, Tulare County, California. It gives an <)pi><)rtunity of study- 
ing the elementary stitches on the best of coiled work. These Indians

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 



have at their command four colors, that of the root or wood with which 
the body of the basket is sewed; black filaments taken from the root 
of a peculiar sedge; where the redbud or cercis is available, the outer 
bark is a rich brown and the inner side quite white; in addition there 
is a bright reddish root, J^iwca arhorescens. 

The stitches are, of course, hexagonal in form, but the pressing of 
the wood together gives them quite an oval outline, and they naturally, 
in the course of sewing, incline toward the right. With these colors 
and oval elements to which the artist is bound to restrict herself, the 
attempt is here made to produce a step-formed cycloid. In the spaces 

between each two designs is 
the figure of a man. It is 
interesting to note how, un- 
der such narrow restrictions, 
so good effects can be pro- 
duced. 

In southern California 
among the Tulare and other 
neighboring tribes, as well 
as among the Apache and 
Navaho, most pretentious fig- 
ures are attempted in coiled 
elements. Fig. 99, after 
Holmes, in the Sixth Annual 
Report of the Bureau of Eth- 
nology (fig. 339) furnishes a 
good example of what is here 
mentioned, but the farthest 
departure from old-fashioned 
types is exhibited in the work 
of the Apaches, who attempt 
all sorts of animal forms in 
coiled work, and the Pima 
tribes, who lose themselves 
in labyrinths and frets. 
The basket from which this 
elementary rectangle is taken will be found illustrated on Plate 30, in 
Report of the U. S. National Museum for 1884. « 

Plate 49 shows two covered jars in exquisite coiled work, brought 
from Santa Barbara, California, b}^ William Alden Gale, of Boston, 
between 1810 and 1835, and owned by the Misses Eaton. The upper 
basket is 11 inches high and 5 inches wide; the lower 15i inches wide 
and 10 inches high. The}' are introduced here for the purpose of 
calling attention to their combination of iesthetic qualities. One does

not know which to admire most, their forms, tlie fineness of the 
stitches, the simple ])ut eli'ective designs, or the charming- etfect of 
color both in the patterns and in the mosaic work. Covers on !)askets 
from this area are rare and may not be ancient. It is just sug-oested 
that their motive came from the old preserve jars common in ships' 
outfits a hundred years ago. 

In hg. loo the ornamentation has all the features of lacework; 
indeed, it might be called the ])eginning of lace. The detailed draw- 
ing above the figure shows, however, that the example is simply a 
piece of coiled basketry from which the foundation rows have been 
carefully withdrawn and only the sewing remains. In the long 
stitches between the thread has been simply wrapped twice around 
the standing part instead of once. It is within the weaver's power to 
make this change at any moment from single wrap to double wrap, 
the result being a figured surface, as in the lower drawing. This sort 
of ornamentation has rare existence north of the present ])oundaries 
of Mexico, but may be found all through tropical America. The 
example here shown was procured fi'om the Pima Indians of the 
Piman family in Arizona and Mexico, but beautiful examples were 
also collected by W J McGee among the Papagoes, their kindred. 

DESIGNS IN DECORATION 

The fundamental checks, decussations, stitches, and meshes of which 
the mosaic of basketry is made up are used, associated or not with 
color, in forming designs or patterns on the surface. Compare the 
severe!}^ plain Haida cylinder wallet with the exquisitely decorated hat 
from the same tribe. Both are in the color of the spruce root, but the 
latter resembles fine lacework on account of the delicate pattern cov- 
ering its surface. All Indian tribes know how to give variety to unity 
by simply making up various technical compositions that add no new 
processes. These compositions are aggregations of simple forms 
which are the alphabet of the Indian woman's most intriciite patterns. 
It matters not how complicated the whole design may be, it is com- 
posed of the following simple parts: 

(a) Lines In ornament. 

{b) Squares or rectangles. 

(c) Rhomhoidal figures. 

{(7) Triangles. 

(e) Polygonal elements. 

if) Com/plex patterns. 

It may be well to devote a little more space to the consideration of 
these. Many seemingly incomprehensible patterns become clear when 
resolved. At the same time the secret of their pleasure-giving qualit}^ 
is revealed. Just as a subtle pleasure creeps into the mind in scrutin- 
izing the uniform stitches on the surface of the Washoe basket (Plate 



296 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902 

46) SO, in a hig^her sense, the orderly recurring of the same geometric 
shape over and over in an intricate design adds to the enjoyment of 
the whole. These elements are not exact, however, being hand-made 
and bounded by lines produced by the curved forms in most basketry. 
The artistic effect is thus heightened. 

(a) Lines hi ornament. — It may not have occurred to the reader to 
observe how scrupulous almost every Indian basket maker is to relieve 
the monotony of her work by a simple line of some other kind of 
weaving. It would be safe to say that no basket is without them. In 
the entire Hudson collection in the National Museum there is not a 
twined basket whose texture is not improved in more than one place 
by a line in a different style of technic. These lines may run in almost 
any direction, and, as in the Haida hat, be worked into geometric 
figures. 

Plate 50 is a collection of Pima basket bowls from southern Arizona 
belonging to F. M. Covert, of New York city. It shows how many 
different effects are produced in the same tribe by the mere adminis- 
tration of lines wandering about. In some of the figures shown it 
will be seen how easy it is for a row of stitches to become double and 
then to add or to make additional rows at the ends or on the sides, to 
separate lines or to give to a line any sort of curved effect. This is 
especially noticeable in fig. 3. The line may pass by further additions 
into rectangles, triangles, or geometric figures. The Indians of the 
southwestern portion of the United States have exhausted the situation 
in this matter of meandering lines. 

{h) Squares or rectangles. — The next simplest form upon which the 
basket artist may venture is the square or rectangle, which may be a 
l)and of two or more rows interrupted by vertical spaces, perhaps in 
another color. It is a matter of counting the same number over and 
over as the work progresses, and is one of the first steps in arithmetic. 
In a Porno gift basket the square patterns on the bottom are the mats 
on the ffoor, and so the simplest of weaving motives lends itself to 
symbolism. In the plainest forms of work the checkers or squares 
are oriented at right angles to the horizon or border of the specimen. 
Variety is effected by the position of the squares and their relation 
one to another and to other decorative elements. A delightful effect 
is produced on matting especially where the squares or checkers are 
oblique to the borders. Such work is to be seen in America, but was 
much more common in the islands of the Pacific. 

The rectangle gives a wider scope still to variety in artistic effects. 
Bands of rectangles are to be seen around basketry, and more compli- 
cated forms are made up of them or have them in their composition. 
A departure from the rectangle, but in the same line of workmanship, 
is the parallelogram. Such work is easily produced in the diagonal or 
twilled weaving, ^n excellent example of an intricate design made up 



ABORIGIISAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 297 

of rectangles in various positions and relations one to another is shown 
in the old Skokoniish wallet from Washington in the collection of 
F. Harvey. (See Plate 51.) The decorations on this wallet consist of 
vertical collections of geometric tigures, one hanging from another, in 
suits of four. Each one of the designs which go to make up the whole 
decoration in its simplest elements is a rectangle. The projections 
from the sides of these are the same, and the wolves around the upper 
border are simply a collection of the same elementary design, the head, 
the neck, the l>ody, the legs, the tail, each one is the same. On the 
larger rectangles are nests of geometric tigures of the same class, one 
inclosed in the other by widening lines. The entire eti'ect on the sur- 
face is produced by the clever use of a single element. 

In many examples, when the rectangular figure is set obliquely the 
pattern on the basket appears to have a rhom])oidal form. The types 
of weaving have much to do with the administration of the rectangle, 
whether it ])e radial or concentric. In diagonal weaving the long axis 
is horizontal, l)ut in coiled work the long, sk'nder rectangles are per- 
pendicular. ]n loose coiling the tigures become rhom])oidal on account 
of the longer slope of the stitch. Twined work produces an infinite 
number of rhoml)s in rows having ragged edges. In the style of 
weaving produced by the Makah the separate elements are rectangular 
on the inside, l)ut they form a charming patchwork of rhombs on the 
outside. The rectangle aside from color, which will be studied later, 
lends itself to ornament ])y its relief, its proportions, and its position. 
The relief depends on the material, which may be soft inner bark or 
bast, or pliant leaves. On the other hand, it may be soft fillets of ash 
and stems of willow or coarse brushes as in the fish weir. When the 
projecting elements are intractable the possibilities of plain geometric 
ornamentatio!! are limited in the extreme, l)ut with fibers highl}' flex- 
ible and well- soaked materials the field of the decorator becomes 
greatly enlarged. 

Plate 52, a large bottle-shaped granary of the San Carlos Apache 
Indians belonging to the fine collection of F. S. Plimpton, of San 
Diego, California, shows what is meant by proportion. Upon the 
surface of this coiled basket will be found stepped patterns rising in 
a cycloids from the bottom to the neck and even to the rim of the 
specimen. Each one of these spaces is covered with black and white 
rectangles, or as near as rectangular forms can be made on a globular 
surface governed in length and width by the widening or narrowing 
of the specimen. In the spaces between these patterns so made up 
are men and horses, but even these have square heads, bodies, legs, 
and feet. The fingers on the men are in proper shape. An amusing 
departure is manifest in the effort to give a little shape to the tails- 
and ears of the horses.

surface of the basket has a tessellated or mosaic appearance. These 
figures also ma}" be oriented with reference to the borders, but the 
patterns become oblique, and more pleasing diaper effects are caused 
when the figures are not oriented with reference to the horizon or 
border. Plate 53 shows a number of beautiful bowls in the collec- 
tion of C. P. Wilcomb from Kern, Inyo, and Tulare counties, Cali- 
fornia. They are introduced here for the purpose of showing how, 
on many of them, diamond-shaped patterns have been worked into 
basketry with excellent effect. Associated with these geometric form 
pol3"gons are also the elements of cycloids, covering almost the entire 
surface, liadiating from the bottom, triangular spokes proceed to the 
outer margin and these are decorated with diamond patterns and 
irregular polygons. The human form and other tj^pical patterns are 
united with those now under consideration. The majority of the 
decoration, however, is in the simple elementary geometric shape 
here considered. 

{d) Triangles. — On the surface of basketry the triangle, as an element 
of design in mosaic, does not occur in the single stitch or check, but it 
is found in open-work basketry, as among the Aleuts, where the warp 
is bent backward and forward or crossed. By the combination of 
elementary parts triangular effects in great variety are obtained. In 
this technic a triangle is not a three-sided figure with straight outline, 
but a pyramid made by piling up rectangles, vertical or radial in 
coiled basketry, horizontal or concentric in woven basketry. The 
base of the triangle may be straight but the sides are notched and 
stepped as in the bead work. 

A great many symbolical designs of arrowheads, mountains, and 
other artificial and natural objects which suggest the three-sided form 
are produced on both coiled and woven basketry, the base of the tri- 
angle being at the top, at the bottom, or on either side of the figure. 
The conical or the globular basket lends itself most cheerfully to this 
element in design. On cylindrical, and especially on vertical vasi- 
formed basketry, for ornamental effects the triangle easil}^ passes into 
curved figures of infinite variet3^ After the foundation of the figure 
is laid on a certain round of weaving or coiling it is possible on the 
next round to widen or narrow above either end of this line. In some 
examples a sweeping cycloid beginning at the base, narrows and curves 
to the right or left, terminating with the outer border. The Filipino 
hat makers are exceedingly fond of creating a series of these triangle 
cycloids in different colors, some of them turning to the right, others 
to the left. The Oalifornia basket maker also produces flame-like 
effects with elongated triangles. There seems to be no end to the 
versatility of this figure on globular basketry. 

Plate 54 represents two of the Tulare bowls in the collection of 
F. S. Plimpton. The upper figure, especially, shows in its bands of 



ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 299 

decoration in brown and black how the rhonil) and triang-le cooperate 
to produce regular and pleasino- decoration. The lower figure is a 
better illustration of the use of narrow parallelograms, combined in 
lines concentric and radial, to give expression to phenomena such as 
lightning. 

Plate 55 is an imbricated box from the Fraser River country, in 
British Columbia. Excepting the parallel bands, the front and body 
of the basket are covered with white and dark-brown triangles, no other 
elementary geometric figure being introduced. Each triangle is an 
example of the limitations before mentioned, which practically cut the 
basket maker oti' from free-hand drawing. The geometricians say that 
a circle is a polj^gon with an infinite number of sides. With them all 
curved lines resolve themselves into the rectilinear. The basket maker 
does not stop there, but resolves rectilinear forms into still minuter 
rectilinear forms of another class. The mosaic elements on the basket 
are most regular squares of imbrication. There is for her no other 
way to make a triangle. This specimen is in the collection of 
F. Harvey. 

(e) Polygonal elements.— ^\\^i has been said of the triangle is also 
true of polygonal figures — that is, of those having more than four 
sides. These figures may be produced in the texture of baskets in 
openwork. The}' are also ])rought about by uniting difl^erent forms of 
checks or stitches in the same piece of work. On the hats of the Haida 
Indians and on twined work of the Pacific coast excellent diaper pat- 
terns are woven. In closely packed basketry the individual stitches 
assume the form of the hexagon, after the manner of the bee's cell. 
On matting, wallets, bags — that is, on flat surfaces — all of the geomet- 
ric figures before mentioned having straight borders occur. In many 
rhombs the ends are cut off ]jy boundary lines of bands and turned 
into hexagons. 

However, as soon as basketry begins to assume curved outlines, 
borders that would be straight on a flat surface are bent in one or 
more directions. The effect of this, both in the single mosaic element 
and in the larger designs, is to change the figure from a hard outline 
to one that is far more graceful. In a coiled basket the foundation 
coil is curved horizontally, but the stitches cross these at right 
angles. In a coiled bowl with globose bottom there are three sets 
of curves with different radii — the horizontal curve of the founda- 
tion, the curve of the pattern, and the vertical curves of the stitches. 
The shapes of polygons that may be worked on the surface of 
basketry are legion. The designs which may be made out of these 
are even more numerous. It will be possible to illustrate only a 
limited number of them, but the reader may be pleased to turn from 
plate to plate in the decorations on the surface of basketry in the 
various chapters to see how versatile the Indian woman's mind was in 



800 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

making the best of her limitations. Bein^- contined to angular ele- 
ments, having no opportunity to introduee tiic curve, except so far as 
the ])ody of the basket itself made straight lines cur^'ed, it became 
necessary to rack her ingenious Ijrain to satisf}' her cravings for ex- 
pression of the beautiful with straight lines only. (See Plates 56-59.) 

{/) Comqylcx jxitterns. — The most striking artistic effects in basketr}^ 
are realized when the simple lines, l)ands, and geometric figures are 
united and modified to suit the weaver's fane}-, to fit the general shape 
of the object, and oftentimes to correct a miscalculation on the part 
of the maker. The effect of lines is changed by ])reaking, curving, 
setting at different angles, widening, and coloring. Geometric figures 
become subsidiary to and are lost in m3'thological compositions, but 
the}" are the organic parts of the whole design. 

Plate 60 will illustrate what is here said al)out the production of 
intricate designs by combining two or more of the separate elements 
ill the foregoing ])aragraphs. In every one of the Ixnvls shown in 
this plate a circular form in basket work is attained by using material 
of the same color in the coiling at the bottom. From these central 
beginnings designs in triangles, s([uar(\s, rectangles, and poh^gons are 
built up into lal)yrinthian decorations for the whole surface. In the 
middle figure of the bottom row five patterns radiate from the central 
circle, each one of which is made up of three groups of rectangidar 
figures in black and white. Specimens are in the collection of J. W. 
Beidiam. 

Plate 61 will interest the student as an example of bold design, being 
the American eagle, with expanded wings. It will surprise him to 
note how, with the use of straight-line figures before mentioned, some 
little life is given to the neck and to the talons of the bird by the fine 
marking of stitches, which lend themselves somewhat to curved eti'ects. 
It can not be said, however, that this treatment is a success. 

ORNAMENTATION THROUGH COLOR 

Quite as much as form, the colors in basketry are an element of 
beauty. As in basket forms the sense of pleasure is awakened bj^ the 
mass, by the minute elements, and by the shape of patterns or designs, 
so it is with colors. One does not know which to admire the most — 
the subdued shades of the natural materials, the pretty effects of the 
infinite variety of hues in the stitches, or the combinations of patterns 
in ornamentation through colors furnished by Nature's laboratory, 
which the importunate Indian women of America have secured in their 
tireless quest. The gamut of shades runs from pure white through 
the yellows and browns to sooty black, and age only ripens the effects. 
The peculiar golden shade of an old piece from California will set the 
connoisseur\s face aglow. No doubt a part of this admiration springs 
from association of ideas such as age, rareness, the seeming disparity 
between the maker and her art, and, maybe, the pride of ownership. 



ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 301 

\Vh(Mi it is remembered that for utilituriuu purposes merel}" not one 
speck of this artistic coloring- is needed, and further noted that great 
fatigue and search and critical judgment are necessar}^ in order to 
assem])le materials for a single basket, surely no one will withhold 
admiration from the creator of colored ornamentation in l)asketr3^ 
One can scarcely begin to appreciate her struggles and triumphs until 
the eti'ort is made to reproduce her results. 

Ornamentation b}" means of color is effected in basketry through 
the following processes, already hinted at in the chapter on })asket 
making: 

(rt) By employing materials which are of different colors by nature. 
This has Ijeen partly described in the foregoing sections. 

(h) By the use of dyed materials. 

{(') By overlaying the w^eft and Avarp with thin strips of pretty mate- 
rials before weaving or by wrapping strips about them in various 
ways. 

{(I) By embroidering on the texture during the process of manufac- 
ture, called false emln•oider3^ 

(e) By covering the texture with plaiting, called im})rication. 

(y) By adding feathers, shells, beads, and other ornamental objects. 

In the making of designs on basketry, dyeing, overlaying, false 
em])roidery, and imbrication are merely artificial methods of repeat- 
ing and heightening the decorative effects already- shown to be possible 
through use of materials in their native colors. No new designs are 
added, symbolical or otherwise. The efl'ect of new forms in elementary 
technic has alread}^ been mentioned. But the artist ol)tains an immense 
advantage in the num))er of colors as well as the richness of shades 
and harmonies. After all, excepting in California, there are only a 
few colors in tough fibers to select from in any area. If it were not 
for pretty grasses which have brilliancy of color, but little tenacity, 
and the bright dyes in mineral and vegetal substances which have no 
value as textiles, the aesthetic power of basketry would be greatly 
curtailed. There are two or three small linguistic families of Indians 
in California that seem to have gathered unto themselves every kind 
of ])asket decoration. As in the island of Crete the culture of the 
ancient peoples about the eastern Mediterranean seem to ha\'e assem- 
bled, so in the Porno and Mariposan tribes of Indians the composite 
art reached its climax of decoration. Is it not marvelous that here 
hundreds of years ago, perhaps, In-oke out the first ])asketry epidemic; 
not as now resulting in a fever to ow^n them merely, but manifesting 
itself in a passion for making them. In the chapter on uses it will be 
seen that this passion was intimately related to the most sacred feel- 
ings that dwelt in the soul of the maker, namely, those associated with 
the spirit world. It is also true that the natural materials for other 
forms of art expression were lacking or not courted. 

{a) In natural 'materials. — Color in basketry is effected, first, by the 



302 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

materials from which the structure is made up. In the Aleutian 
Islands the ware is in the color of the wild grass stalks, unripe and 
ripe; farther south the spruce root decides the shade, and in British 
Columbia cedar root and bast and bark give a brown or white appear- 
ance to the ware. In eastern Canada ash splints are white and brown; 
so are the baskets made therefrom, but the cane of the Southern States 
has a glossy yellow-green surface, and that predominates in Cherokee 
and Choctaw ware. 

Among the bewildering varieties of baskets between British Colum- 
bia and Mexico the foundation colors will be decided by that of the 
Indian hemp, spruce and cedar root, bulrushes, cattail stems, shoots 
of willow and rhus, roots of sedges and agave, roots of yucca, and 
so on. 

In this connection it must not be overlooked that these same 
materials are not lacking in responsiveness to the severest a?sthetic 
demands of the artist. The Abenaki woman knows that last year's 
growth of black ash is almost as white as snow, while the rings of 
growth farther in are brown. She therefore makes warp of one and 
weft of the other, or bands of them alternately, much to the embel- 
lishment of the surface. The commonest iishwoman on the coast of 
British Columliia will show you that cedar root has three colors — that 
of the woody portion, the brown of the outer bark, and the newest 
wood nearest to the bark. She also knows how to overlay with 
grasses. The California cercis, or red bud, has a prettj' reddish- 
brown bark, but the wood inside is pure white. Remarkable sug- 
gestiveness to a wide-awake mind exists in the 3'ucca leaf of the 
Southwest, which may be used in basketry, whole or split. The out- 
side is mottled green in a number of shades, while the inside is white. 
The leaf of the yucca {Yucca arborescens) is green, the root a reddish 
brown. 

Holmes calls attention to the possibilities of aesthetic effects in a 
single color shown in a workbasket from the ancient cemetery of 
Ancon, Peru, produced through variety in the management of diag- 
onal weaving. There will be found on all these workbaskets (1) ordi- 
nary diagonal weaving, over and under two or three or more; (2) bands 
of greater or less width formed b}^ haying a piece of wood or cane 
between warp and weft and then continuing the weaving on the other 
side; (3) the forming of hinges and ridges by twining in each weft 
element about two or three warps before continuing the weaving. 
The herringbone effects are pi'oduced by leaving in front alternately 
warp and weft in the padded bands. If the number of rows of com- 
mon diagonal weaving is even, a herringbone effect is seen; if odd, the 
checks in the two rows will be parallel. In Mexico and Central 
America the valuable 3' uccas give color to all textiles, as do the palm 
leaves in South America. (See figs. 207-209.) 



ABOEIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 303 

It is said that the Japanese in sawing up logs will keep the planks 
bound tog-ether until the workman is ready to use them, and when the 
carpenter places them in a ceiling or a piece of furniture he is careful 
to have the ends al)ut on each other as they were together in nature. 
The grain, in sucli case, fits and produces odd but pleasing forms. In 
the same way the l)asket maker, by showing discretion and taste with 
roots or stems of ditl'erent shades, succeeds in producing cloud effects 
upon the basket or mat. So nature comes in to the assistance of the 
Indian woman in her elementary steps. She does not start out with 
tlie design in her mind which she will produce in color, but by using 
the colored elements she is able to get her effect with less forethought. 
Indeed, it can be seen that in such a way the earliest thoughts of l)eauty 
might have been awakened. 

Plate 62 shows two coiled Mission baskets in the collection of G. 
Wharton James; the upper one is 10 inches and the lower one llf 
inches in diameter. They are made of rush, but the, interesting fea- 
ture for which they are introduced here is the design — the upper 
figure might be called the keystonii pattern, the ))ody of the bowl 
having two zones of patterns in brown and black material, each one 
made up of wedge-shaped figures, narrow on the inside and widening 
outward. These ijatterns are in four parts, each one surmounted by 
a middle piece extending two rows ])eyond the next pair and each pair 
of the series ending two rows nearer to the center. They are of ec^ual 
width. A narrow wedge separates the four groups. Between the 
zones is a band of white preserving the outline of the border. The 
lower figure is a five-pointed star, the border of the segments being- 
curved as in the orange-peel pattern. The central figure might be 
called a sun design, which, though it be modern, shows the adaptabil- 
ity of the Indian mind to invasion by suggestion. 

A second step in color resources, without going away from the 
natural and necessary structural elements, is in the use of different 
materials. Very few areas in the Western Hemisphere are so poor 
in resources as to have only one good basketry plant. On the Great 
Lakes ash, hemp, and sweet grass are white, brown, and green; in 
the Southwest rhus is white and martj^nia is black; in California willow 
is woody white; cercis is red outside and snow-white inside, and at 
least one sedge has black root, and the j^ucca a red one. Most dainty 
effects are secured in coiled basketry by sewing with strips from quills 
of flickers and other highly colored birds. Not to pursue the state- 
ment too far, it is only in Alaska and the Straits of Magellan that the 
body of our textile does not contain varied material. 

The moment a savage woman has in hand these variegated substances 
her fancy is emancipated. Warp may be of one plant and weft of 
another, either in plain checker or in twilled weaving. Wickerwork 
is not entirely irresponsive to the opportunity. In twined weaving 



304 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

the two strands of the weft may ditier in color, so that the result will 
be the mottled line. If the warp stems be odd in number, then on the 
next round the colors on vertical lines will not match. With these 
simple resources the basket-maker may play an unlimited number of 
melodies. An excellent example of lines in simple and two-color 
effects from southeastern Alaska is shown in colored plate 67. 

But the aml)itious artist is not satisfied with flecked lines and mottled 
surfaces, and broad ])ands in one color. Her bands are divided into 
rectangles, trianoles, and rhomboidal elements. The zones of element 
are widened and the geometric patterns composing them are multi- 
plied and variegated. Those who have large collections may have 
noticed how the several styles of technic behave in this ri^gard. 
Checkerwork is little restrained, so also are wicker and twilled orna- 
mentation; but in twined and coiled ware the case is entirely differ- 
ent. Plain twine and the Poino tee work venture little beyond the 
banded ornament. The same is true of most coil types; but the 
twilled or diagonal-twined work and the three-rod coil leap over the 
parallels and spread themselves out in ])ewildei'ing cycloids of colored 
patterns, or, keeping to the angular elements, the weaver covers a large 
surface with fretwork in endless variet3^ All of this is wrought into 
the structure of the ])asket in the substantial everyday material, which 
possess tenacity and color as well. Quite a number of tribes in the 
southwestern United States use no superadded material or d^^es what- 
ever, and yet the tribes of the Piman family excel all others in the 
endless variety of fretwork on their basketry produced with splints in 
wood color and the undyed splints from the pod of the cat's claw, or 
Maiiynla louisiana. (See Plate 63.) 

(J) By dyeing. — The colors of natural textile materials were still 
further diversified with d3"es and paints, the latter either stamped, 
stenciled, or applied freehand. At the present time the cheap and 
obtrusive d3'es and paints of the trades supplant the aboriginal and 
more attractive substances. The latter have also l)ecome more diffi- 
cult to procure as civilization has preempted the ground. 

The artificial coloration of basketr}^ material was known to the 
American savages in pre-Columbian times. For mineral dyes they 
use earth colors, burjnng the splints in different soils, where they 
acquired permanent shades. Vegetable d^^es were known from Alaska 
southward everywhere. The substances used were such as have the 
power of directly fixing themselves within the texture of the basket 
material. It is true and also interesting to note that certain of the 
processes of the Indians in dyeing their basketry materials were, all 
unconsciously to them, foreshadowings of the later and more compli- 
cated processes in which a mordant is employed to fix the dyestuff in 
the materials. The Indian had no knowledge of the effects produced. 
They discovered the fact, but their theories would lead into dreamy 



ABOKIGII^AL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 305 

myths in which the personcity of tlie dyestuli' would be the proniinent 
characteristic. 

Plate iU shows twilled basket No. 76T7S, U.S.N.M., from the New 
Orleans Centennial Commission. It is a basket of the Chetimacha 
Indians of Louisiana made in split cane in the natural color and dyed. 
The union of textile effects and the three colors — orange, l>lack. and 
straw color-are most pleasing, the motiye being ellipsis and rhombs 
made by the use of small squares and rectangles. The upper portion 
of the ligure also shows how a diaper effect may be produced on the 
surface b}" the lights and shades of the uncolored material. 

It is useless to tarry al)out thi^ eastern l)asket makers in search of 
native dyes. There is no doubt of their haying possessed them. The 
porcupine-quill w^orkers about the Great Lakes and all the way to the 
Arctic circle are still adepts in the art. In the National Museum are 
little wallets of bladder from Anderson River, Canada, each one tilled 
with porcupine quills dyed in a separate color. 

The basket weavers of Yakutat Bay, in southeastern Alaska, color 
their splints of spruce root from which they weave their twined Ixis- 
ketry with dye from the willow. They scrape the roots of willow 
and make a decoction in a wooden tul) in which they soak the spruce- 
root splints. Their neighbors of the same linguistic family had a 
more extensive laborator}' in color. For more than a hundred 3'ears 
they were in contact with the Russians and from them obtained good 
dye-stuffs and knowledge of processes. Many an old piece of their 
basket ware, although it has stood hard use in all the years and in spite 
of all, has grown more beautiful with age. 

Plate 65 shows two covered baskets of the Tlinkit Indians in twined 
work which are inserted here for the purpose of exhibiting the influ- 
ence of modern traffic. C»sar in his Commentaries speaks of the 
Belgians as being the most manly of all the Gallic tribes, because mer- 
chants less frequently went among them and sold them the things that 
tended toward effeminating their minds. The Mercatores have also 
been among the tribes of the Northwest. On the right-hand basket 
even the bands that would show soiue little survival of the ancient wood 
color have been dyed, while the red, yellow, black, and white shades 
are in aniline. The form of these baskets is also borrowed from 
civilization, and the handles in braided ware are not aboriginal. Cat.

cedar bark or grass. Governor Dagget, writing of the Indian women 
on the Hupa reservation in northwestern California, uses ahnost pre- 
cisely the same language with reference to making a d3^e pot of their 
mouths. The processes of weaving there are in twined work and sug- 
gest connection with the Washington state tribes. 

The Navaho Indians, according to Washing-ton Matthews, employ 
native dyes of yellow, reddish, and black. In their blankets they have 
also wool of three different natural colors, white, rusty black, and gray. 
The black dye i ; made from the twigs and leaves of aromatic sumac 
{RJtKS i/'ilohata ). Thc}^ put into a pot of water leaves and branches of 
the sumac. The water is allowed to boil live or six hours. Ocher is 
reduced to a hue powder and slowly roasted over a fire until it assumes a 
light-brown color. It is then combined with an equal quantity of Finon 
gum {PinuH edulis)^ and again the mixture is placed upon the tire and 
stirred. The gum melts and the mass assumes a mushy consistency. As 
the roasting progresses the mass is reduced to a tine black powder. 
When it has cooled it is thrown into the decoction of sumac, with which 
it forms a rich^ blue-black fluid. This is essentially an ink, the tannic 
acid of the sumac coml)ining with the iron of the ferric oxide in the 
roasted ocher. The whole is enriched ])y the carbon of the calcined 
gum. 

Ileddish dj^e is made from the bark of the AT mis tenui folia and 
the bark and root of Cercocarpus jparmfolius^ the mordant being fine 
juniper ashes. These dyes are now applied b}- the Navaho. The 
so-called Navaho blankets are in three colors. 

For yellow^ the fiow^ering tops of Chrysotliainnus graveolens are boiled 
about six hours, until a decoction of deep yellow is produced. The 
dyer then heats over the fire some native alunogen (native alum) 
until it is reduced to a pasty consistency. This she adds to the 
decoction and puts the whole in the dye to boil. From time to time 
a portion is insi)ected until it is seen to have assumed the proper 
color. The tint produced is nearly lemon yellow. 

Julian Scott makes the statement that the Coconinos or Havasupais 
in northwestern Arizona use only black in the ornamentation of their 
basketry, while the Apaches and Wallapais use black and red also. 

(c) By overlaying. — This process of ornamentation consists in lay- 
ing a strip of prett}^ grass, dyed or in the natural color, on the out- 
side of one or both the strands in woven or coiled weaving. It is 
virtually furnishing a dull-brown strip of root with a bright-colored 
bark. B3" this ingenious cond)ination beauty and strength cooperate 
in the result. The weaver has it always in her power to twist the 
strand so as to hide this bark side or bring it into view. The Hupa 
Indians especially, but many other tribes in northern California and 
northward, do the weft of their beautiful twined weaving in somber 
materials. The men are most adept in lining the backs of their bows

with sinew .shredded and mixed in glue. In a siniihir way, as though 
one had suggested the other, the}^ line the back of the weft strands 
with bright straw. It is not glued, since the Aviniving would hold it 
in place. When the llupa reveals the straw side of the strand at ever}' 
half turn, she covers the surface of her basket with straw color which 
turns to gold with age. The overlaying of only one of the two weft 
strands gives a freckled ett'ect on the surface. In some of the tribes 
the patttn-n does not show on the inside. 

This will ]>e a good place in which t(j mention a kind of overlaj'ing 
common in countries where the cane abounds. The outside of the 
stem is glossy and may be dyed. The inside is spongy and unat- 
ti-active. By laying two strips together, so that the smooth surface 
may be outward, there would l)e reall}' a double fabric with two 
gloss V surfaces. The southern Indians also fre(juently passed only 
one of the pair of splints over or under weaving. 

Fig. 101 shows a style of wa-apping done in Mexico City." The illus- 
tration is from a hand wallet. 
The body of the checker 
weaving is in hard, flattened 
straws of vai'ving shades. 
Each warp straw is wrapped 
with two flllets of thin mate- 
rial in darker color so as to 
leave small scpiares or^ the sur- 
face set diagonally. When 
the plain weft is run among 
the warp elements, the sur- 
face of the fabric is covered 
with larger and smaller 
squares in white set in tri- 
angles of darker material. The white squares run diagonally across 
the surface. There are endless variations produced by this wrapping- 
added to the body of the fal)ric. 

This overlaying must not be confounded with the many tricks which 
cunning women play with the strands of the regular twined weaving, 
which are frequently of brilliant straws of squaw grass and other 
pretty materials. (See Plates 110, 161, 170, 177 and 17S.) 

Plate 06 represents twined basketry of the Klamath River Indians 
of various types, and is here introduced for the purpose of showing- 
how the tough weaving material may be overlaid with basketry and 
other colored tilaments so as to conceal the foundation both outside 
and inside. It has been shown in the chapter on processes, however, 
that the exposure of the overlaying material need not occur on the

Akin to the "beading," so common in the Eraser River coiled bas-

work by the onlaying of colored straws in regular geometrical designs 
and catching the angle under the strand of the weft. Holmes " figures 
an example of this from the Klamath Indians in northwestern Cali- 
fornia, a rare process in North American Indian basketry. (See fig. 
102.) It reminds one of the stamps for printing tapa cloth used in the 
Polynesian area. 

Beading is the insertion of narrow strips of prettj^ grass or other 
material into the sewing of coiled baskets, passing it under one, over 
the next, and so on. Plain beading produces a broken line of dark 
and light color alternating, and shifts the direction of the elemental 

figure from vertical to hori- 
zontal. If several rows are 
made, figures are produced by 
the process of twilled weaving. 
The basket maker may pass 
her filament over and under as 
many stitches as she chooses; 
she may make the elements 
of an}' row inimediatel}' over 
those of the preceding row, or

the outer surface of a twined basket is covered wholly or in part with 
designs, but they do not show on the inside. The Tlinkits excel in 
this, calling it uh tah yark tu twage (outside lifted up and put around). 
It has the appearance of being sewed on after the weaving is done. 
The process is described on the next page, and many figures in this 
paper show examples of it. Plates 71 and 74, in color, demonstrate 
more plainly how effective false embroidery may be made. The body 
of all Tlinkit and Haida ware is in dull-brown shade of spruce root. 
The saving feature which lends itself cheerfull}^ to ornamentation is 
the plialjility and even fiber of the young roots. Nothing can be more 
pleasing to the eye than a fine old Haida hat, its surface covered with 
intricate patterns. The Tlinkit false embroider}^ in subdued colors, 
yellow, red, and black, contrasts harmoniousl}" with the cinnamon-

fallen. The incline of the stitches in false embroidery is in the oppo- 
site direction. In Plate 67 charming effects are produced l)y alternat- 
ing the plain weaving and the embroider^-. (Emmons.) 

The twined false embroidery might be classed technically with three 
strand twined weaving. (See 
tigs. 29, 31, and 104.) The 
warp is in normal position. 
The weaver selects three 
strands for weft, two of 
spruce root and one of 
brightly colored grass. They 
all have their places in the 
weaving, but the third, or 
decorative element, instead 
of taking its turn to pass 
behind the warp, remains 
on the outside and makes 
a wrap about the strand that 
happens to be there. The 
wrapping may pass, also, over two by skipping every alternate twist of 
the warp. The Thompson Indians vary the mode of wrapping by pass- 
ing a strip of corn husk or other soft material entirely around the 
twining each time, showing the tigure on the inside.

(6^) Tmhrication. — This term, derived from the Latin imbrex, a tile, 
is applied to a style of decoration used in Washington and British 
Columbia b}^ the Klikitat and man}^ of the Salish tribes, and most 
closely allied in technic with the feather work on basketry farther 
south. Leaves of JLei'opkylhmi tenax^ strips of wild cherry bark or 
of the inner bark of the cedar, in natural color or djed black, are laid 
over the sewing- of the coiled work. The juice of the Oregon grape is 
used to produce a bright yellow dye. The separate elements of the 
imbrication are squares or rectangles, varying in size with the fineness 
of the workmanship. But the mosaic effect is most striking, and 
designs of intricate character are successfull}'^ expressed in it. The 
Salish tribes about the Fraser mouth have learned to widen the coils 
by using thin strips of wood, often half an inch wide, as foundation of 
the coil. This increases the size of the imbrications and of the pat- 
terns. (See page 254 and Plate 68, also Plates 11, 13, 15, and 55.) 

Ornamentation in Thompson River basketry is produced by imbrica- 
tion and by })eading (for detail drawing see iigs. 52 and 53 and Plate 
102). Imbrication is done by l)ringing the piece of grass over the 
outside of the last stitch and forward, then doubling it back and 
catching the dou])le end with the next stitch. The outsides of Klikitat, 
Cowlitz, and Thompson baskets are completely covered in this manner, 
so that the whipped cedar splints can only be seen from the inside. 
Lillooet baskets have the lower part of the body plain, while the 
Chilcotin baskets have a separate band in the middle of the body. 
The grass used is that called Nho'itlexin. It is long, ver}^ smooth, 
and of a glossy yellow-white color {X^67'0]:)liyUum tena:e). To make it 
whiter diatomaceous earth is sometimes spread over it and it is then 
beaten with a flat stick on a mat or skin. The grass is seldom dyed, as 
the colors are said to fade soon. (Teit.) 

(/') Feather-worl'^ headx.^ etc. — The California baskets adorned with 
feathers are called jewels. They no longer serve vulgar uses. The 
beautiful productions covered with styles of ornamentation before 
described have often the marks of fire, the stain of berries, the smell 
of fish about them, proclaiming that they were not above combining 
the beautiful with the useful. The feather baskets sacrifice use to 
beauty. 

The tribes of eastern America have not emploj'cd feathers in basket 
work in recent times. The nearest approach to it is the porcupine- 
quill work of the Indians in Canada and the United States. The quills 
are dyed and set on the surface of birch baskets by thrusting the sharp 
ends into the bark. The old historians tell of gorgeous feather robes 
made doubtless in the Indian fashion of twined weaving, which is akin 
to baskctr}'. The Eskimo, Aleut, Ilaida, and Tlinkit do not ornament 
baskets with feathers, but they do apply in dainty fashion to some of 
them worsted, hair, and furs. Neither do the tribes of the Fraser-

Columbia area. It is the California tribes chiefiy that have developed 
the art, of whieh they practice two styles. In the one tiny bits of col- 
ored feather are sewed by their .shafts to coiled Ijasketry just to give 
a iiazy effect to the sui'face. Plate TO is an excelhMit example of this. 
It will be observed that the elaborate pattern in ])laciv is jiot obseui'ed 
in the l(>ast ])v the feather. In the other process the feathers ai'c laid 
one upon another so thickly that the surface of the ])asket is hidden. 
Th(^ addition of so nuich extraneous matter thickens the foundation 
and coarsens the work. As previously remarked the best (examples of 
coiled sewing- are not to be found in the feathered baskets. 

Plate ♦>!) is a colored illustration of a feathered basket, of the Ponio 
Indians from Sonoma County, California, in the collection of C. P. 
Wilcoml). It is examples such as these that technically are called 
jewels. The foundation is a three-rod coil, the sewing is with split 
sedge root {Carex harbar»'), and the stems of tho feathers are caught 
under the stitches. The feathers on this rare specimen are as 
follows: 

Red — AVoodpecker (JL/a/icrj^t s fonn /clnoriON).

the woodpecker {Melanerpes f<)7n)iiclvoru.s)\ and the l)lack feathers at 
the top are from the crest of Chikaka, the quail {Lophortyx ealifor-

showy birds gotten in trade are used. The perforated disks are

V. SYMBOLISM 

All the high and low 
Of my wild life in these wild stems I snare; 
The jagged lightning and the star I show; 
The spider and the trailing snake are there. 

— Anna Bali,. 

All industry leads to fine art and all savage arts begin at the foot of 
the ladder and end "'beyond the bourne of sunset.-' In this apotheosis, 
basketiy is the rival of stone working, wood carving, skin dressing, 
and pottery. The merely useful basket has some beauty, but the 
exalted specimen of handiwork is the acme of intelligent discrimina- 
tion in the materials as well as of hand skill and taste, and leads up to 
the choicest textile productions. Its maker must be botanist, colorist, 
weaver, designer, and poet, all in one. But could the windows of her 
mind be thrown open wide there would be seen, in addition to all these, 
the mystic love of her tribe alive and active. In the old days of 
unsophisticated savagery, no doubt, there was everywhere in America 
the overseeing and guiding presence of the mythic in the practical. 
Its relics are still to be found on fragments of pottery especially, and 
there is no reason to douV)t that it reigned in other departments of 
activity. The old-time basket makers were under its spell every- 
wdiere. It would be an interesting study, but it can not be pursued 
here, to And out how far the various peoples of Europe in settling 
down upon the lands of the savages had by their ethnic traits and 
l)eliefs gradually eliminated or modified those of the aborigines in the 
matter of symbolism. 

Besides the umnodified artistic motives in the designs on basketry, 
there still survives in the Pacific coast area a symbolism more or less 
connected with Indian cosmogony. The maker is a sorcerer. In 
such tribes as the Hopi this idealism in design is still alive and activ^e. 
Among the Algonkin Indians of the Atlantic States the thought seems 
to have escaped entirely from the design, and the Indian woman mak- 
ing her baskets at the seaside resort, at the springs, or at Niagara 



AROKIGINAL AMERICAN J^ASKETKY. 313 

Falls has no more idea of putting a thought into the colors and pat- 
terns which she weaves than though such a thing never existed. The 
designs are changed to suit the whims of the buyers. Idealism is 
buried in conmiercialism. Tracing the motive around the Arctic 
region there still is found no pattern in basketry until southern Alaska 
is reached. In the birch-bark ware of middle Alaska and Canada, and 
in the rawhide-parfleche receptacles of the Sioux and other Plains 
tribes, the mythical conception is reawakened. The Oiil)w^a al)Out 
the Great Lakes preserve all sorts of ancient patterns in porcu- 
pine-quill work on birch bark, while the Sioux, the Arapahos, and 
Kiowas paint upon their partleche cases the totemic s3^ml)olism of 
their tribes. '^^ It is well to keep in mind these other symbolic repre- 
sentations in speaking- of basketr}', since they raise questions of origins 
and relationships. Boas is inclined to refer the designs on Salishan 
basketry to the tribes inland across the Cascade Mountains. 

The Haida Indians of Queen Charlotte Archipelago make wallets 
and hats of spruce root, now and then weaving in a band of black, but 
the ware is extremely plain. Its decoration depends upon the various 
types of weaving employed and painted symbols. But the Tlinkits on 
the mainland and islands of southeastern Alaska, on the other hand, 
cover the surface of their baskets, made precisely similar to those of 
the Haidas, with symbolism connected with their daily life. J.t has 
been thought that anciently the Tlinkits made baskets like the Haida, 
without colored ornaments, and that the designs on the baskets have no 
ra3^thological signiiicance. The Chilcats, however, who are akin to the 
Tlinkits and live on the mainland, cover the surface of their fringed 
robes with their totemic symbolism in most subtle fashion. The tech- 
nical process on these blankets is precisely the same as that on the 
baskets, only the blankets are made in soft wool while the baskets are 
in hard material. Coming farther southward the land of the imbri- 
cated basket is reached. The sybolism on this, ware has been worked 
out by Livingston Farrand.'' Further on these designs will l)e taken 
up with greater detail. As the inscriptions on Assyrian slabs have 
preserved the thoughts and lore of Mesopotamia and the hieroglyphics 
of Egypt held secure for millenniums the story of the oldest of empires, 
so in a much humbler fashion the myths and stories of these Indians 
have been in the olden times symbolized on their basketry. There is 
no Rosetta stone nor alphabet of design for their decipherment, all 
the more diligent must the present seeker be to save the evanescent 
records. The basket is frequently made for no other end than to 
record the legend.

314 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

The Salish tribes of Washington and Oregon, and those of Califor- 
nia, Arizona, and New Mexico, all place some kind of designs on their 
basketr3\ Whether it has a symbolical significance or not has to be 
determined in each case l)y inquiry. Looking at the whole field as 
revealed in collections and publications, the following classes of objects 
and phenomena sought to ])e represented seem to be complete: 

1. Natural phenomena, such as lightning, sunrise, clouds, and sky. 

2. Natural features of objects, such as niountains, lakes, shores, and rivers. 

'A. Plant phenomena, including splints of the plant used to make the design. 

4. Animals and parts of animals. There is no end to this species of design, from 
the attempt to represent the entire animal alive and in motion, to the few stitches 
which stand for a part of the creature, perhaps a wing, a fin, an eye, or a tooth, to 
show what the animal might be. 

5. Human beings, either full or in part. 

0. Devices used by the Indians in their occupations, arrowheads especially. 

7. Ideas connected with the Indian thought and life; for example, such as the 
opening in a Navaho basket. 

8. Mythical personages connected with sorcery and witchcraft. 

9. Their gods and heavenly beings. 

In thinking of symbolism the sign or form on the basket and the 
thing signified must be kept separate in the mind. The sign ma}^ be 
at the beginning pictorial and pass down through changes and abbre- 
yiations to a mere outline that has no suggestion in it, or a simple 
geometric figure common in the techuic may become a mythic being, 
by making here and there a significant addition through suggestion. 

When it is remembered that the Indian represents in a general way 
the childhood of the race, one has but to revert to that period of life 
to recall how a spot of ink or a meaningless form was transformed 
into a picture of something real or ideal. A fundamental geometric 
figure on basketry may in similar fashion by the add'tion of a line or 
two become almost any design, the visible home of any symbol. 

In this paper, devoted more particularly to the technical side of 
b,' sketry, the manner of realizing the symbol is still important. How- 
ever, it is not so much sought to teach that a certain design I'epresents 
a butterfly as to see how the woman put the form into the texture of 
her basket. 

The sculptor, the painter, the carver, and the potter are more realistic 
than the basket maker, since the making of portraiture and pictures are 
easily within their reach. Yet nothing is more common among them all 
than abbreviation and synecdoche. Not only are the}^ under the spell 
of sym])olism, l)ut the symbol is curtailed to the lowest terms. A fin 
stands for a whale, incisor teeth for a beaver, the beak for a bird, and 
often the imager is completely obliterated in the symbol. Now the 
basket maker i.s still more handicapped by her technical limitations 
and driven to syml)olism if she did not largely invent it. For pic- 
torial effects on the surface, the maker is hampered b}^ the limitations 



ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 315 

of weaving and sewing. It will be found, therefore, that her tempta- 
tions are to pass more quickly to the sym])olic stage of representa- 
tion. It is well to remember also that just as on the baskets themselves 
the symbolism, starting with pictures, has in some tribes been reduced 
to its lowest terms, so in the basket maker's mouth the legendw have 
])ecome faded into concrete words and then into meaningless terms, 
yet the thought is there. Of a certain form on a basket plaque the 
Hopi woman would say it is the bird that carries messages to the 
rain god; another tribe would call it a bird; a third name it wings, 
and finally it becomes an empty geometric design. Again, the student 
himself passes through a process of initiations as the subject is 
exploited. 

It is said that Pompey declared, when he had drawn aside the veil 
of the Holy of Holies, at Jerusalem, "The Jews worship nothing." 
With some such feeling the collector of baskets begins his quest. The 
first impression is that no set patterns were in the maker's mind. She 
has a sense of the beautiful and loves to give her fancy free rein. 
Indeed, the reticent and suspicious basket maker helps the delusion. 
A little later the discovery is made that the patterns stand for things, 
Init still for general notions. It is only after long familiarity and sj^s- 
tematic converse with old basket makers that the veteran collector 
learns that the belief that these patterns stand for mountains, lakes, 
rivers, men and women, deer or other mammals, flying birds or bird 
tracks, fishes, insects, flowers, plants, heavenly bodies, or articles of 
use and worship merely is but a fraction of the truth. They are con- 
crete, standing not for all or any, ])ut for one, and underneath them is 
charming folklore. Mrs. Shackleford tells of a certain intricate pat- 
tern on a Washington basket that it represents ripples, but on patient 
inquiry it was found to mean the subtle movements in the under waters 
of a certain lake upon a special occasion. To appreciate symbolism 
fully one must know the sign, hear the story, and then study the 
skies, the landscape, and the social environment. 

To attempt to discover an alphabet in this primitive art would be 
useless, for each trilie adapts old and new standard forms to its own 
concept myths. T'he artists alone, in every case, can interpret them. 
This existence of concrete stories in art form is not confined to bas- 
ketry. Dr. Boas is authority for saying that the intricate totem post 
and composite painting of the North Pacific coast can be interpreted 
only by the carver. The attempt to find a clue to the mystery of 
their composition is hopeless, for none exists. As soon as the perfec- 
tion of monotony or uniformity has been reached in the technic to 
form the basis of real art, there ensues a variety no less thorough and 
diversified in the ornamentation for sym])olizing the same idea. The 
rule in the Indian woman's mind seems to be reduced to a fornuila like 
this: "The minimum of variety in the technic, the maximum of variety 



316 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

in the symbolic." Or, in other phrase, variet}" of symbolic expression 
in the unity of the real art. One looks careful!}^ at a set of drawings 
like those of Eunnons, Farrand, Fe\ykes, or Dixon, and turns to a 
familiar collection to Und the same symbols. They are not there; 
or, rather, they are hiding- there. It is a question whether there be 
two baskets alike in design among any tribe. This is the real charm 
of sayage hand work as compared^ with the rather dull uniformity of 
machine products. All the tribes of the West that haye preseryed 
their S3^m1)olisms haye at the same time made the most of their liberty 
to modify the original. 

The suljject of symbolism may be studied from seyeral points of 
view, the tcchnic, the elaboratiye or historic, and the ethnic. Begin- 
ning with the technic as the easiest, symbolism is wrought in checker, 
twill, wncker, twine, and coil. Looking at a coarse piece of matting 
made up of monotonous squares, it is not easy to see how the story of 
creation or tribal preservation could ))e wrought into them. But with 
finer elements and the introduction of color, a part of the difficult}' 
vanishes. In point of fact, however, there is little evidence that sen- 
timent was wrought into checker, or even into twilled weaving. There 
is no essential difficulty in the way. Mosaic in stone or other hard 
material is made up of little blocks, chiefl}' squares, and both the 
twined and the coiled basketry surfaces contain innumeral)le designs 
made up in small squares in black or other color. 

Symbolism may be studied in its elaboration or historic develop- 
ment. The history of a symbol on basketry is the same as that of a 
design on pottery or a painting on hide. Perhaps, since the technical 
demands are more exacting, the progressive appearance of the ideal 
is more rapid and the hiding of the original more complete. A 
moment's thought makes it clear that one is dealing simply with a 
universal law of mental development. The basketry of any one tribe 
will show what is meant. On a single Hopi plaque it is not rare to 
see side by side the complete figure of a bird or butterli}' with out- 
spread wings and near by an abbreviated cross which means the same 
thing. (See Plate 47.) " 

Another specimen constructed by the same hands will have the cross 
but not the birds. By and l)y enough examples are brought into com- 
parison to show the process of fading out through which the realistic 
becomes only a skeleton. There is a celebrated Japanese painting- 
showing seven stages in the life of a beautiful girl. As she passes into 
womanhood, through all its years, behind the real face the pretty child 
is seen, and even the skull that lies among the flowers shows to the 
beholder, after a moment's gaze, the loveh" girlish face. In the last 
relic of symbol on basketry to the trained eye of mythology the same 
transition takes place. The comparison of an ordinary lot of Califor- 
nia basketry, their zigzag lines, arrowheads, mountains, and crossing 
paths, with such treasures as are in the ]\ierriam collection, each gath- 



ABORIGINAL AMElllCAN BASKETRY. 317 

crod from the hand of the maker, together with the song of the soul 
whose melody is written there also, makes plain what is here set forth. 

Professor Farrand calls attention wisely to the fact that in the 
reduction of symbols to their lowest terms yery dissimilar forms haye 
converged until the same figure does duty for many objects, the 
technical exigenc}' or strain predominating. This has led to differ- 
ences of opinion among natiye connoisseurs and fre(|uently confusion 
to the ethnologist. The same obseryation would ])e true in working 
the other way. It is only in most recent times that psychologists haye 
appreciated the power of suggestion in helping one to determined action. 

Recently a package of beautifully marked shells were sent to the 
National Museum as the probalde origin of designs in sayage art. 
Nothing could l)e farther from the truth. Form does not come to the 
sayage artist's mind in that way. Whether the syml)ol arise l>y con- 
ti'action or expansion, the artist is the creator of new forins, working 
always within the school of her materials and tools. 

Wicker basketry in its worst state is positiyely ugly. In the eastern 
part of North America no attempt is made to put a legend upon it, 
but in New Mexico and Arizona it is found in two forms side by side, 
one as plain as undressed stems can be made and the other at the top- 
most point of pictorial representation. In Oraibi, the most western 
of the Hopi (I\Ioki) towns, are made the pretty little wicker plaques 
called Katchinas. The finding of fragments of these in ancient ruins 
by Dr. Fewkes is good proof that th(\y have long been made by the 
Hopi. Farther on, the designs themselves will be examined. They 
are mentioned here rather to show that where there is a will with the 
human species, of whatever color, there is a way. Examples of 
Katchinas are shown in Plates 85 and 93. The Ilopi wicker plaques 
are made up of short stems of CJtrysotlutinnus that have been previously 
smoothed and dyed in as many colors as are needed. The work resem- 
bles closely that in porcupine quills. Figures do not show effectively 
on the back, for the reason that a single stem often passes over only 
one warp element. Sj^mbols of complex pattern are also fi'equentl}^ 
finished out with the brush. In many of the intricate symbols on the 
Katchinas the narrow limitations of the material and the curve of 
texture that can go in one direction only put th(». artist to her wits' 
end for conventionalisms. She does not mind, but goes ahead. True, 
a rainbow nnist be upside down, the sky goddess must have rectangular 
eyes and mouth. There is no perspective, the round must be flat, and 
even those features that are out of sight must be l)rought to view. 
Never mind, the ideal wins and the plaque is ffnished. 

With twined work the case is different. All its varieties are capa- 
ble in themselves of expressing ideas even in one color, l)ut as soon as 
overlaying, embroidery, and the use of different hues are added there 
is practically no end to the possibilities. In this connection the reader 
may be reminded again that designs must not l)e confounded with sym- 



318 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

boLs. The former are apparent and coiistaut and extremel}" limited, the 
latter ideal and as varied as an Indian woman's fancy. But in the chapter 
on ornamentation it was seen how varied in different hands and mate- 
rials twined patterns might be made. Twined ware is, if anythin«-, at 
the start the coarsest of all, for what could be ruder than the wattling 
of a lish weir or the wall of a granary ( Taking the geographic areas 
in turn, it is not until southeastern Alaska is reached that an attempt 
to tell a story in twined decoration occurs. Even there the S3'mbol 
exists more in the false em])roiderv on the surface than in the twined 
work. In point of fact, however, whether studied with Ennnons for 
southeastern Alaska; with Farrand on Salish ware; or with Dixon in 
northern California tribes, it is not in twined work that the most 
exalted and idealized s3'mbolism has l)een wrought. 

Coiled ware also has such a variet}' of technical treatment, with the 
whole color scheme of nature to select from, that in practice there is 
no limit to the form and coml)ination of designs or of syml)olism. In 
these the weaver secretes her thoughts. You must ask her what the}^ 
mean. Rarely is one of her symliols widespread. In the next tribe the 
sign will stand for quite something else. It is well to observe here that 
a vast deal of coiled basketry has no symbol or design on it whatever. 

Etlvnic .si/n(hoJ!stn. — Recui'ring to the six ethnic areas which for 
convenience have been adopted in this publication, basketr}' has lost all 
trace of symbolism among the Indians of eastern North America. It 
can not be for a moment supposed that they have none, for with 
Algonquian, Siouan, Kiowan, the substitutes for basketry, rawhide 
receptacles, as well as moccasins, cradles, and objects in three dimen- 
sions, are covered with idealism in painting and embroidery. 

To understand the richness of this survival of aboriginal symbolism 
the student will receive his principal aid at hand in the researches of 
A. L. Kroeber among the Arapaho." Four hundred and fifty-eight 
distinct symbols are given in figures covering Indian ideas from com- 
mon objects to spiritual beings. All the closing pages of the above- 
named paper (pp. 138-150) must be examined carefully in order to 
comprehend both the sign and the thing signified, the thought and the 
overthought, the text and the symbolic context in Arapaho embroid- 
eries, paintings, and three dimension designs. The closing paragraph 
will give the gist of Dr. Kroeber's stud}'': 

The closeness of connection between this Arapaho decorative symboHsm and the 
religious life of the Indians can not well he overestimated by a white man. x\.2>art 
from the existence of a great amount of decorative symbolism on ceremonial objects 
not described in this chajiter, it should be borne in mind that the making of what 
have been called tribal ornaments is regularly accompanied by religious ceremonies;

that some styles of patterns found on tent ornaments and [larfleches are very old and 
sacred, because originating from mythic beings; that a considerable number of 
objects are decorated according to dreams and visions; and, finally, that all syndiol- 
ism, even when decorative and unconnected with any ceremon\-, tends to be to the 
Indian a matter of a serious and religious nature. 

The Kskiino also and the Aleuts perpetuate no thought or niyth in 
basketry synilwls. The etchinos of the former on i\'ory are also mod- 
ern and were learned from outside teachers. It is not in these that 
the idea is to bo sought. Not for a moment is it to be thought, how- 
ever, that ther(^ is no syml)olisin existing. All the life is wrapped up 
in hunting. The long, dark wnnter, the return of the sun with the 
innum(u-a])le retinue of life in the air and in the waters gives the key- 
note. It is in the dramaof hunting and tlu^ masks worn in dances that 
symbolism is embodied. 

On the Pacific coast from Alaska to the peninsula of C'tilifornia and 
in the Interior Basin the tribes have l)een left to their own devices 
through the centuries, and it is here that survivals of symbolism are to 
be sought. They will ])e found in one place full of life and ancient 
spirituality; in another stung l)y civilization, they are as torpid as the 
spiders that are placed in their nests bv the mud wasps. 

The name Tlinkit applies to a luuuber of basket-making tribes in 
southeastern Alaska. In their charming archipelago they^ have devel- 
oped a uni([ue scheme of symbolism growing out of their mode of life. 
This has been thoroughly studied hy Lieut. G. T. Enunons, U. S. 
Navy, in his collections in the American Museum of Natural History, 
New York, and the identifications here made are on his authority." 
They cover a wdde range of meanings. Supplementary to this l)asket 
symbolism, or rather preeminent over it, are the Chilkat blankets and 
the endless variety of carvings in stone, horn, and wood, and the sym- 
bolic paintings on all sorts of surfaces. The following identitications 
are from specimens in the U. S. National Museum: 

Ars suck har ha yar ku, "Spirit voice, or shadow of a tree." 

Kah thluckt yar, " Water drops." 

Kisht, "The crossing."

320 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 3902. 

Plate 71 shows specimens of twined wallets made of spruce roots, 
for carrying- berries and other articles of food on the back. The left- 
hand figure in this plate is Catalogue No. 20704 in the National 
Museum and was collected by James G. Swan, at Sitlca, Alaska. It 
is an excellent specimen of twined weaving, with what is here called 
false embroidery. The figures on the surface, determined I)}' Lieuten- 
ant Emmons, are as follows: The two wide l)ands contain the following 
ornaments: The large five-sided figures in the middle are the "Shark's 
tooth;" the chevron pattern covering the shark's tooth means the 
"Flaking of flesh of fish into narrow strips;" the small triangular fig- 
ures are the "Salmon berry cut in halves," ))ut in this arrangement 
also called "Water drops;" the narrow middle band is rendered 
" Single tying around;" l^elow the ornamental band the cross-shaped 
figure represents the "Raven's tail." 

The right-hand figure in this plate is also a berry basket. The two 
wider bands have the same design, having a bar in the middle with its 
ends bifurcated, known by the Tlinkit as "The crossing." The trian- 
gles in these bands stand for " The salmon berrj^ cut in halves." The 
middle band is "Tying around." The vertical designs at the bottom 
represent "An eye" on one side, and on the other side "Shark's 
tooth." The five-sided figure with a reentrant angle stands for "The 
Arctic tern's tail." Catalogue No. 21560, U.S.N.M., collected by J. B. 
White. 

The right-hand figure in Plate 72, Catalogue No. 20701:A in the 
National Museum, collected by J. G. Swan, is a cylindrical basket in 
twined weaving. The upper part of the body of this basket is divided 
into three bands worked in straw, natural color, and dyed red and 
brown. The symbols in the upper and lower band are (1) the " Spirit 
voice, or the shadow of a tree," in zigzag lines; (2) vertical rows of 
rhombs, which indicate the ej^e; the middle band, made up of sinuous 
lines on rectangular figures is called "Tjnng around." The allusion 
may be either to the fact that this figure constitutes an encircling 
band, or to the sinuous pattern itself. On the lower part of the body 
the fretted pattern, with three rectangles inclosed in the Ijeuts like the 
bars on an epaulette, stands for "The tattooing on the back of the hand 
of an old person." 

Plate 37 represents two small, beautiful l)askets with rattles in the 
tops, made by the Tlinkit Indians of southeastern Alaska. Both of 
them are covered over the entire surface with false embroidery in 
thr^e colors. The small patterns on the baskets j^ortray the salmon 
berry and the triangular figures stand for shark's teeth. These are 
fine old specimens collected in 1875 b}^ Dr. J. B. White, U. S. Army. 
Catalogue No. 21562.

warp is crossed, and the weaving- is in twined work ornamented with 
false embroidery. The upper band and the one across the middle 
of the body represent ''The salmon berry cut in half," while the band 
of the shoulder and the one at the bottom stand for "The leayes of 
the lire weed." 

The upper covered jar on the same plate illustrates the com])ination 
of false em])roid('rv and the use of two colors in the material out of 
which the specimen is woven. This specimen is Catalogue No. 9112 
U.S.N.M., and was collected in Alaska by Lieut. F. M. King, U. S. 
Army. 

The Haida Indians on Queen Charlotte Islands are near to the Tlin- 
kit in arts, but weave no symbols into their basketry. They paint 
various designs on their ceremonial hats and have no (Mid of richest 
sjniibolism on their canoes and carved in wood and slate. They also 
now engrave on silver and keep alive the poetry of their tmcient art. 

The following story, collected for Lieutenant Kmmons ])y a friend, 
proves that the basket is not altogether out of touch with their world of 
myth: 

Once upon a time there were two Haida Indian orphan girls living 
on Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia. After being punished 
by their stepmother for eating up a store of deer tallow they resolved 
to run away\ They wandered about in the forest a long time and were 
eventualh" rescued by the '"seek quan ni" (Black Bear tril)e), one of 
whom married the girls. Years afterwards these girls determined to 
visit the scenes of their sad childhood. For their journey ])ack from the 
forest to places of human habitations their good totem spirit directed 
them to w^eave two baskets apiece large enough to fit over the end of 
the thumb. These they were directed to till with crumbs of various 
kinds of cured meats and deer tallow. As in the miracle of the live 
loaves and two lishes which sufficed for a nuiltitude, the contents of 
these tinj'' baskets furnished food for the two women on their journey 
of many moons. Arrived at the entrance of their father's house their 
baskets suddenly l)ecanie very large, so large, in fact, that it required 
the strength of many slaves to take them into the house. The women 
found their stepmother still alive. They oli'ered her the various meats 
and tallow which they had brought from their forest home. More, 
and yet more food they pressed upon her until th(^ unhappy woman 
died of overeating. 

Professor Farrand selected happil}- the most versatile of all the 
North American families of Indians for his studies, the Salishan. 
Among these the Lillooet and Thom])son baskets, of British Columbia, 
supply the fiat and round types of imbricated coiled work, and the 
Quinaielt, on Puget Sound, the overlaid twined weaving. The Klikitat 
ware is not included, but a comparison of its symbols with the Salish 
would be profitable. The line of development in symbolism among

the Salish tribes lia.s beini from the pictorial to the g'cometric. Pro- 
fessor Farrand finds that the use of animal designs is by no means 
predominant. This was seen to be true on the Tliidvits also, while 
the Chilcat (Tlitikit) blanket shows the dissected and distorted motives 
described by Boas/' 

The list of symbols on the baskets of the lower Thompson Indians 
is given b}' Mr. James Teit. It is made up of: 

1. Arrowhead pattern (tataza, arrowhead). 

2. Root pattern (mula, a variety of root). 

3. Butterfly pattern (nkikaxeni, ))utterfly). 

4. Star pattern (nkokucen, wtar). 

5. Packing strap pattern (tsupin, packing strap). 

6. Zigzag pattern (skolotz, crooked). 

7. Box pattern (kika, grave box). 

8. Eagle pattern (haMu, eagle). 

Each of these words is compounded with the suffix "aist," pattern; 
but the lower Thompson also have s3'mbols for snake or snakeskin, 
snake or snake tracks, rattlesnake tail, grouse or bird tracks, bear 
foot or l)ear tracks, bird or geese flying, fly, l)eavcr. deer, horse, 
man, hand, tooth, leaf, shells (dentalia), stone hanuncr, comb, neck- 
lace, net, root-digger handle, leggings, canoe, trail, stream, lake, 
mount, air, lightning, and the same is true of other Salishan tribes. 

Plates 74 to 71), reproduce Professor Farrand's figures and the 
descriptions are from his monograph. -' These illustrations, l)eing most 
of them in a difficult technical process called imbrication furnish excel- 
lent studies in mosaic p;ctographs. The elements are all little squares 
in difl'erent colors, var3"ing from one-eighth to one-quarter inch in 
dimensions. Much charity is needed in detecting the thing in the 
symbol. The shark's mouth with its horrid teeth, is rather intensified 
by the angularity of the design, })ut most of the things represented 
are hidden in the symbol. 

Plate 74, fig. 1, shows a coiled and imbricated berry basket of the 
Lillooet Indians, British Columl)ia. It has a pyramidal form, flat 
foundation in the coils, and the decoration is in two segments or bands. 
The designs are flies, arrowheads, and half circles {'i). The lower 
stripes are clusters of flies. Height, 10^ inches; 1 inch = 71 stitches, 
4i coils. Compare Cat. No. 213585 U.S.N.M. 

Plate 74, fig. 2, shows a twined and overlaid ])asket of the Quinaielt 
Indians, Washington. Its design represents flounders. Height, 5^

same. The design is a head, with open mouth, below are arrow heads. 
Compare fig-. 3. 

Plate 74, tig. 6, represents a coiled and imbricated basket of the 
Lower Thompson Indians, British Cohuu])ia. Special attention is 
called to the ridged surface caused hy a bundle of s])lints. On this 
plate are shown the two radically different methods of laying- the 
foundation for the coil. The two narrow black and white stripes on 
the upper portion are made hy ])eading. and represent earth lines. 
The lower figures are grouse tracks. Height, G inches; 1 inch = 6i 
stiehes, .5 coils. 

Plate 75, fig. 1, represents a coiled and iml)ricated cooking liasket 
of the Lower Thompson Indians, British Columbia, with a design of 
flying geese. The foundation of the coil is of splints; the distinctive 
characteristic is that the ornamentation covers the whole surface and 
is not divided into bands. Height, i» inches; 1 inch = 6i stitches, 4i 
coils. 

Plate 75, fig. 2, shows a coiled and imbricated covei-ed Ixisket or 
trunk of the Lower Thompson Indians, British Columbia, while the

Plate 75, fig. 7, is a coiled and iinl)rieated globular basket of the 
Lower Thompson Indians, British Columbia. The design represents 
a snake coiled around the basket and exists on baskets in other 
Sali.sban tribes. The vertical line interrupting the coils shows the 
limitation of this style of weav ing, made up of a continuous spiral and 
not of a series of rings. Height, 7i inches; 1 inch = 8 stitches, 4^ coils. 

Plate 75, fig. 8, is a coiled and imbricated basket of the Lower

Plate 76, fig. 2, is a coiled and imbricated basket of the Lillooet 
Indians, British Columbia, with a design representing a net; the inter- 
spaces show deer shot by arrow, deer, man, dogs, flies. The flat coil 
in the bottom, the absence of angles, the design over the surface are 
noteworthy in the Lillooet. Height, 13^ inches; 1 inch = 6 stitches, 
3i coils. 

Plate 76, fig. 3, is a coiled and imbricated basket of the Lillooet 
Indians, British Columbia, with a design representing a man with 
feather in his hair, bow and two arrows, and at either end a notched 
ladder (?). The lower segment is beaded. Height, 8f inches; 1 inch = 8 
stitches, 5^ coils. 

Plate 76, fig. 4, shows a typical coiled and imbricated basket of the 
Lower Thompson Indians, British Columbia. The design is a plant 
with fernlike leaf, end view. Height, 8^ inches; 1 inch = 7i stitches, 
3i coils. 

Plate 76, fig. 5, shows a coiled and imbricated basket of the Lillooet 
Indians, British Columbia, having a design representing arrowheads 
and flies. In technic this example represents the older forms. 
Height, 11 inches; 1 inch=7 stitches, 4 coils. 

Plate 77, fig. 1, shows a coiled and imbricated basket trunk of the 
Lillooet Indians, British Columbia. The structure and form are 
decidedly Hudson Bay Company in motive. The design represents 
arrowheads of difi'erent shapes. Height, 9 inches; 1 inch = 5i stitches, 
3i coils. 

Plate 77, fig. 2, shows a bag in twined weaving with wrapped orna-

For the northern California and southern Oregon tribes the guide 
to the study of symbolism is Roland B. Dixon." who divides basketry 
into three types (see fig. 163.): 

I. N<yrt1iwestet'n. tyjx' includes the area occupied ])y the Hupa (Atha- 
pascan), Karok (Quoratean), Yurok (Weitspekan). The technic is 
twined work overlaid. 

II. Noi'theastern type comprises Modoc and Klamath (Lutuamian), 
Shasta (Sastean), Pit River (Palaihaihan), Yana (Yanan), Wintun 
(Copehan), and Maidu (Pujunan). The technic is twined and coiled. 

III. Porno ty2)e. — This versatile people of the Kulanapan famih' in 
its technic is cosmopolitan, using both twined and coiled ware in every 
variet3^ The Yidci and the Costanoan are left unclassed. 

Three groups of symbols are distinguished by Dixon— animal designs, 
plant designs, and representations of natural or artificial objects. For 
the Pomo symbols he relies upon Carl Purdy, collector of material 
from that people in the American Museum, New York. For the 
northeastei"n grt)up, Dr. Dixon has made exhaustive personal observa- 
tions and illustrated the symliols in I'lates i-xvi of his monograph. 

The following story applies to a ])eautiful piece of basket work from 
the Yuki Indians, now in Round Valley Agency, Covelo, California. 
They are associated with the Wailakis. who are Athapascan, liut the 
Yuki themselves form a separate family. Catalogue No. 1311(»8 in the 
U.S.N.M., Plate 80, is called a sun basket, of Yuki manufacture,

collect(^cl l)y N. J. Purcell, and in order to complete its history it is 
necessiirv to know what the Ynkis ))elieve to be the oi'igin of the 
workl. " In the ])co-inning there was no land; all was water. Dark- 
ness prevailed everywhere. Over this chaos of dark waters hovered 
'On-coye-to,' who appeared in the form of a beautiful white feather, 
hence the love of the Yukis for f (Withers. In time the spirit became 
weary of his incessant tlight thi-oui^h the murky space and lighted 
down upon tiie face of the watei". Where he came in contact with the 
water there w;is a whirlpool that spun his body round and round. 80 
rapid became the motion that a heavy foam gathered al)out him. This 
became more dense and expanded in width and length. It gathered 
up the passing bubbles until it was a huge Hoating island. On the 
bosom of this rested the snowy form of ()n-coy(^-t(). As he lay upon 
this island after an almost endless flight through the dark space, the 
idea of a permanent resting place came into his mind. 80 ho made 
the land and divided it from tlie water. From the form of a feather 
he assumes that of a luan and rested upon the land. Still there was 
no light, and the spirit was troubled. On-coye-to saw far off in the 
firmament a star, po-ko-lil-ey, and resolved to visit it and learn how it 
emitted its sparkling light. After a long journey he arrived and 
found a large and Ix^autifully lighted world, inhal)ited ])y a numerous, 
hospitalde people. Still, he saw not whence came the light. He was 
allowed free access to all the habitations save one, ' the sweat house.' 
This was guarded night and day, and was accessible only to sick per- 
sons. Finally a great hunt was planned, and as the time drew near all 
was prepared for the occasion. But On-coye-to feigned sickness, that 
he might investigate the sweat house. When the morning arrived for 
the hunt he was too ill to accompany the hunters, A council was held 
to determine whether this stranger should be admitted to the sweat 
house, Avhich is even now a sacred place with the Yuki tribe, and it 
was decided to give him the benetit of this house of medicine, religion, 
gambling, and man}^ othei- practices. A few old men were left to 
administer to his wants and to see that all went well. As he entered 
the sweat house he was almost blinded by the light that Hashed upon 
him. As he became accustomed to it he looked around him and dis- 
covered its origin. Hanging high over his head in several baskets 
were as many beautiful suns. Having found the fountain of light he 
waited patiently until the old men were all asleep, then climbed cau- 
tiously to what seemed the brightest of the suns, took down the basket 
which held it, slipped from the sweat house and made his way rapidly 
back toward his own world. He was hotly pursued by the indignant 
warriors, l)ut he arrived safely after many adventures. He hung the 
sun in its basket far in the east, then surveyed it. It did not light up 
to suit him and he moved it a little higher. Still it did not suit him, 
so he continued to move it on and on, and is moving it to the present

day/' Thus the Indian accounts for the moving of the sun. and thinks 
not that the earth moves. 

The basket here shown is believed to be a copy of the same in which 
the sun was stolen from the other world and brought to this. On 
the bottom is a piece of polished a})alone shell cut round to represent 
the sun. Below this is suspended a new moon, then a fish, and all 
around the sides hang pieces of the same shell, which the Yuki say 
represents the stars. (N. J. Purcell.) 

As before mentioned. Dr. Dixon relies on Mr. Purdy for the sym- 
bolism on the Pomo basketry. The collection was made in 11)00, and 
the names of designs given. Since that time more information has 
come to Mr. Purdy, and some of the terms are changed. The U. S. 
National Museum has the collection of Dr. J. W. Hudson for com- 
parison, made some years earlier. The interpretations of the symbols 
b}' the two men are quite as interesting a study in the psychology of 
the collectors as of the Indian liasket women. From Dr. Hudson's 
manuscript accompanying his collection the following notes on sym- 
bolism are taken. The underlying thought in his mind is that each 
separate social group of the Pomo has peculiar types of basketry 
known by the keynote in the ornamentation, which is the totem of 
that group. 

Both in painting and in feather decoration the following colors have 
a signiticance with the Pomo: 

Red: bravery; i^ride. (Personified by the woodpecker.) 

Yellow: amatory; success; gaiety; fidelity. (Lark.) 

Blue: demoniac cunning; perfidy. (Jay.) 

Green: astuteness; discretion; watchfulness. (Duck.) 

Black: conjugal love; beauty, ((^uail.) 

White: riches; generosity. (Wampum.) 

The following interpretations of signs were given by Dr. Hudson 
in connection with his collection of basketry secured b}' the U. S. 
National Museum: 

Baiyalcan (Baiyak, net mesh). Same as Mr. Purdy' s. The design is an alterna- 
tion of dark and light stjuares between two boundary lines. 

Bishekamak, deer's hoofs or trail made by those animals in the mud. Very rare 
pattern, once common to the Taco ( Yukian) of Potter Valley. Consists of two right- 
angled triangles joining so as to rej)resent the track of a deer's hoof. 

Bisheniao, deer's loins, the mottles on the buck's rump when struggling out of the 
slime of Clear Lake at the creation. Parallel lines with the inclosed space filled 
with dark and light parallelograms. 

BisJu'o, deer's teeth, seen by the primal Indians when that animal called to them 
for help as he struggled in the mud. A row of little squares with open spaces 
between. 

Danokakca, Mountain Waters tribe, totem of a tribe once living 6 miles north of 
Ujiper Lake, in the mountains at the headwaters of McClure Creek, and a close affin- 
ity and neighbor of the Pomo of Potter Valley. A band of equilateral triangles in 
two colors alternating. 



ABOKIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 329 

Ka toi na otc, or Kavjinaml yak, turtle neck. A charm of halved tnrtlo l)acks 
strung one ahove the other, iu<lieated hy three equilateral triangles, one resting on 
another. 

Kattilid, arrowheads often represented on the basket as strung together and worn 
as necklaces. 

Katshak, arrowhead. A row of equilateral triangles bounded by two lines and 
touching by their bases, or having the apex of each one touching the middle of the 
base of the other. 

Kawinateedi, turtle backs which were seen floating on the waves of ('lear r>ake. 
A series of rhombs adjoining one another. 

Kt'd, quail plume. Totem of the confederated tri])es of Lake County, California, 
especially tluise living in the valleys around Clear Lake. This excludes the Napo, 
Kabe najx), rock village; and Kura napo, water-lily village, who had no recognized 
totems. The Yokaia also claimed the Kea totem, being close kin to Lake tribes, 
though living across the range. L-shape and Z-shai^e designs in color. Most common 
of Porno sj^mbols. 

Mlsakalak, blacksnake, a totem recognized as belonging to the Shokowa of Scho- 
kowa valley, around Hopeland. Represents a snake trail. Two parallel lines near 
together with a sinuous pattern l)etween. 

Na va kai, a totem consisting of a series of ponds connected l)y a slough, and this 
tribe is totally extinct, yet the pattern is often seen in the Yokaia village and called 
Baketch, or man's spit. This is a row of squares made up of dots. 

Poma, red earth. Named from the mound of siliceous earth in Potter Valley, 
whence all Pomos sprung, and from which, to this day, their ceremonial yeast or 
sacrament is dug to be mixed with their bread and eaten. The totem of a Potter 
Valley tribe. Pomo = red (stone) mine or quarry, where argillite or magnetite is 
mined for wamimm. A row of triangles in red Si^lints. 

Shakobii/a, grasshojjper elbows, or the spines on the tarsi. Trail noted in mud. 
It consists of a line of right-angled triangles joined at their bases. 

Sltakohimak, grassliopper tracks made in the mud at creation. Parallel rows of 
dots in fours. 

Tsi yo tsi yo, up and down, the word Ka being understood. "Waves" rolling 
back from the shores of Clear Lake, releasing the new-born creatures. Three zigzag 
lines parallel and oblique. Certain Lake County Pomo tribes use the term tsi yo tsi 
yo, signifying waves, or the marriage of the east wind to the waters of Clear Lake, 
representing it l)y a series of dotted parallelograms in stepped pattern. 

Carl Piirdy's vocal )iilarv of Pomo symbols on basketry is as follows: 

Baiyakan (Baiyak, net), band of rectangles, called meshes; also, snake. 

Bishe mao, or )nl<t, backljone or ribs of a deer. Rectangles or rhomVjs en i^chelon.

Mr. Purdy's interpretations of Ponio .synibol.s will l)e found in Dr. 
Dixon's paper before quoted. If the reader have a eollection of Ponio 
baskets, an examination of the S3^mbols on them in comparison with 
the Dixon plates will demonstrate what liberties the basket weaver 
took with her designs. May be, it were ])etter to sav, what strugoles 
she made to realize a design or symbol under general and special lim- 
itations.

To illustrate the technic of symbolism, Plate 81, Catalogue No. 
203398, collected by Dr. d. W. Hudson, is presented. It shows a 
gift basket of the Pomo Indians, made by a Yokian woman whose 
name is Keshbim, who worked upon it seven months. The pattern is 
a pictograph of a feast, the bottom of the basket being tule mats 
(bitsan) interspersed on the assemldy hall Hoor, not shown in the 
figure. The band of rhomboid figures around the bottom is the roof 
of the dance lodge w^ith its rafters crossed and interlaced, and the 
dancers, male and female, are celebrating the Ma a ca ka (food-falling) 
harvest (acorns). The Pomos have four seasons in their year, begin- 
ning on the first full moon (cha na bu sa da, thuml) jnoon) in duh", and 
Sahanim, smoke-floating time, has four moons; Ma a ca ka has three 
moons, beginning with Batooda, index moon. Kat sa na, green 
earth, has three moons, and Kat sa mi, green-things time, has three 
moons. This basket, under the old regime, would have been presented 
to some friend during the feast, demanding a very handsome return, 
for no one appreciated a fine piece of work like a Pomo woman. The 
foundation is of willow rods. The sewino- i.s not done with linen

Dr. Dixon has made careful personal invcstio-ations concerning the

Dr. Dixon's conclusions are of interest. Designs are subject to 
much variation, chiefly through difl'erent arrangements of elementary 
and constant foi'uis in the })attern. If there are two or more types 
for the same element they are never found together. Designs are 
essentially the same on coiled and twined basketry, but most of the 
Maidu baskets are coiled, and there is suggestion of acculturation from 
the Pit Rivers. Fiuiction and form of the ])asket have something to 
do with symbols, certain designs l)eing restricted to plaiiues, others 
to SOU]) bowls, and so on. The spiral line is a favorite in massing 
syml)ols. Some of the pattei'ns are found everywhere in the Maidu 
area, others are ((uite restricted. In most cases, and this is the uni- 
v(>rsal t(\stimony, th(> intent of the design is not clear from mere 
inspection, but must be e.\])lain(Hl ))efore it can be understood. The 
author's summai'v of Maidu s3nil)ols is the very large variety and 
number, the fre([uency of animal designs, the unusual predominance 
of plant designs, the numl)er in which the realism is ol)s('ured, the

tendency to spiral and zig'zag patterns, and the well-nigh universal 
practice of putting- but a single design on a basket. 

Plate yiJ, hg. 1, is a Washoe basket Si inches high, 12 inches wide, 
and 6 inches across the opening. There are 80 stitches to the inch. 
Colors, red, black, and brown. Weight, 1(5 ounces. The legend is 
named " Migrating," or "When the l)irds leave their nests and fly away 
we shall move." The lower left-hand basket, fig, 2, is 7 inches high, 
Hi- inches across, and inches over the opening, with 30 stitches to the 
inch. The ])ody is light-gold color, and the ornamentations are in 
red and l)lack. Weight, 15 ounces. The legend is, "Rays of the 
sun ascending," An attempt to imitate the radial appearance of the 
light at sunrise. The lower right-hand l)asket, fig, 8, is 7 inches high, 
6 inches across the opening, and 11^ inches in diameter, with 30 
stitches to the inch. The body is light-gold color and the decorations 
are in red and black. Attention is invited to the intricate combina- 
tion of squares and triangles, stepped patterns, and rhombs to form 
the total desion on the surface. These symbols relate to the different 
ranks or degrees in the chieftancj" of the tribe which they are entitled 
to receive by inheritance. This information is based on the studies of 
A. Cohn, of Carson City, Nevada. 

Plate 83 is a Tulare bottle-neck, collected on Tule River, Tulare 
County, California, and is in the collection of C. P. Wilcomb. The 
material and sewing are similar to those in other Tulare baskets. 
The ornamentation deserves especial attention. The bands of rhombs 
on the body and the part on the upper border which resembles the 
shaftment and feather of an arrow are common to the region. On the 
middle of the body, however, is a band of ornamentation which 
resembles the Egyptian ankh. It is useless to speculate on the origin 
of this symbol, since the Indians in this part of California have been 
in touch with the Latin-American race for centuries. In this Inyo- 
Kern-Tulare subarea Dr. C. Hart Merriam finds the crenellated 
design to be associated in sjmibolism with the spasmodic flight of the 
butterfly as it flits among the flowers (see Plates 41, 188, 192, 194) 
and calls attention to the dispersion of the symbol as far north as 
southeastern Alaska, 

Designs were found by Dr. George H. Pepper" on the ancient 
basketry from the caves of southeastern Utah. He refers them to 
s3'mbols as they are now understood among living tribes, but recognizes 
that such forms do not stand for the same object always, even in the 
same tribe. The designs given are the butterfly of the Maidu, water- 
fowls, mountain, and sun. A glance at the beautiful workmanship 
and the designs on Dr. Pepper's specimens at once places them not

in the Ute or Sho.shonean family, but witii tiic exquisite bafslvet-malving- 
tribes westward in California. They have the three-rod foundation. 
The upper one is ITi inches in diameter and 5 inches deep. 

The basket having- the butteriiy design was found over the body of 
an infant, and this led the finder to the conviction that the forms had 
•some mythic significance. These specimens, and many more, belong- 
ing to the Wetherill, the McLeod, and Graham collections are now in 
the American Museum of Natural History, New York. (See Plat(> 84.) 

The Pueblos called Hopi in northeastern Arizona were visited ]\y 
the Spaniards in the early part of the Kjth century. Having no gold 
to tempt the avarice of the conquerors, they were let alone. On their 
coiled and wicker ])askets, used in their religious ceremonies, are shown 
the personages and phenomena most intimately associated with their 
cult. I am indebted to Dr. J. Walter Fewkes for the interpretation 
of their symbolism. 

The basket shown in I'late 85 is peculiar to the Hopi ^'illage of 
Oraibi; has a picture of the Corn Maiden (Shalakomana or Palahiko- 
mana). The head bears the representation of a tal>let which is sym- 
bolic of the rain clouds. The colors represent the rain clouds of the 
four cardinal points: Yellow, the north; l)lue, the west; red, the south; 
white, the east. Usually in representations of this maiden the Hopi 
hair pufl's are represented. A design on the forehead stands for an ear 
of corn, which is one of the syml)olic marks of this maiden. There 
ought to be represented in the middle of the forehead, dependent from 
this ear of corn, a fragment of Haliotis shell. This is for the rain- 
bow. The two ej'es appear as bands, and should ))c of difl'erent 
colors, the left green or blue, the right red. The two l)ands below 
the eyes are meant for facial markings which are generally triangular 
in shape. Green and red stripes on the chin represent the rainbow. 
On paintings the bow is curved the other way, but the restrictions of 
basket making require the curve to be downward. The blanket on 
the body is a garment made of feathers, the individual feathers being 
represented by blue and red ])ands. This is the earth goddess or 
corn goddess. Interesting descriptions of the ceremony in which 
this Corn Maiden or sky goddess is engaged will be found in Dr. 
Fewkes's interesting paper" on the Minor Hopi Festivals. On Plate 
24, opposite page 494 of his article, is illustrated the Palahiko-mana 
dance. She is shown as the central figure. The headdress, l)ody 
garment, and embroidered blanket are represented in full. The head- 
dress is decked with feather plumes, and altogether the appearance 
is more striking. The basket weaver has done her best where her 
pictorial ability gave out, at least, to indicate the presence of even the 
clan markings on the face, which in the drawings picture the human 
hand.

334 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

The top tigure, Plate 93, shows the birds of the four cardinal points, 
two very much enlarged and two smaller. The stripes on the border 
are the tail feathers of the larger birds. The limitations of the basket 
maker are well shown in the specimen, in that all perspective is neg- 
lected and ever}^ part of the body brought to the same plane; the feet 
are turned around so as to show the toes. 

The lower figure in the same plate represents one bird. The head 
on the upper margin having rain-cloud appendages, the beak being 
represented by an extension on the right hand side. The wider sym- 
bolic colors are abbreviated in every part. The bend in the knee is 
shown by the rectangular spaces representing the leg. (See Plate 93.) 

The basket shown in Plate -iT was made at the Hopi tillage of 
Oraibi. The symbols on this basket represent the sky birds of the 
four cardinal points, two of which are larger, two smaller, apparently 
made so for want of room. The central figure represents the heart of 
the sk}' with geometrical rain-cloud figures. The sky god has a 
number of names. 

In the upper figure (see Plate 216), the designs have got past the 
pictorial stage, and the meaning could onlv be known by consulting 
the maker of the basket. It is doubtful whether she did any more 
than what she saw her mother do. It might be possible, if a large 
series were had, to follow this s3^mbol outward to the known pictorial 
form. 

The lower figure in this plate represents the four birds of the car- 
dinal points. The standard colors of the cardinal points are not all 
in the design because the basket itself is yellow, which deprived the 
workwoman of the privilege of representing the north. The symbol 
is very highly conventionalized. 

The figures on both examples, Plate 30, denote rain clouds. 

The same t3^pes of symbolism, occasioned b}" the climate, the ph3^s- 
ical features and productions of the arid region will be found at Zuiii 
and among the Rio Grande Pueblos." Symbolism on the basketry of 
Middle and South America has not been worked out.

VI. USES OF BASKETRY 

Bk'ssfd shall bo thy basket and thy sti.ro.— DkitkhoNhmy. XXVIII: 5. 

Nature bus provided nienibors ot" the uiiinial kiniidom with recepta- 
(des which are a part of their anatomy. The eaiiiel has its water 
sack, the ruminant animals have their extra stomach for the storao-e 
of grasses, the squirrel carries nuts in the })ouch in the side of his 
cheek, and cerhiin insects are provided with various means of trans- 
portino- food to a distance. It remained for the human race to invent 
appliances to accomplish simihir results, and basketry forms one of 
tiie principal means adapted to such needs. There is practicalh' no 
limit to the uses to wdiich ])asket-work weaving has 1)een put. The 
enumeration of these uses in detail will sliow wiiat a })i-omiiient place 
the receptacle has had for holding water, food, and other precious 
objects, for gatiiering the materials connected with industry and for 
transporting them. Basketry also enters into the house, the furniture, 
the clothing, the armor, the domestic economy, the family life, and 
religion of the American tribes. 

There are a multitude of secondary uses of baskets which will be 
mentioned in the proper place. Certainly they have done as much as 
any other industry to develop the intellectual life of savage women, 
both a knowledge of the resources of nature and a taste for aesthetic 
products. It will also ])e found that there is no gulf l)etween ])asketry, 
beadwork, lacework. and loom work. There are times when the basket 
weaver suspends her work and, with the use of her lingers alone, 
imitates the products of most complicated weaving fi'ames. The 
highest steps in basket making will ])e the first steps in the great 
mechanical art which now costs so many millions of dollars and 
employs so many human beings. 

Before the coming of the European, basketry supplied nearly ever}' 
domestic necessity of the Indians, from an infant's cradle to the richly- 
decorated funerary jars burned with the dead. The wealth of a family 
was counted in the num])er and ]:)eauty of its baskets and the highest 
virtue of woman was her ability to produce them. Some domestic 
vessels were named for the particular service they performed; as 
bi-ti-bo-um' (dishes), or Ka-dem (water giver) among the Pomos; but 
the majority were known by their weave or shape. Vessels of the 
Tee weave, says Hudson, bore the l)runt of culinary usage, as pots, 
pails, roasters, etc. There were two varieties of sifters; the coarse 
pshu-kau separating the cruml^s for nut cake, etc., and the ma-a-po-i, 
or finer sifter (a conoid utensil), which, slightly tilted and struck 
sharply within by the linger tips, spills the chatf over the outer 
margin.

The great value of her work reflected upon the make'" herself. It 
was the most expert woman in basketr3% says Miss Jennie C. Carr, 
who brought the highest price, nameh", two strings of shell mone3^ 

Of old basketry some examples are clean while others are soiled and 
dilapidated. The former had the good fortune to fall into careful 
hands half a century ago, when they were new, and have with the years 
merely faded down to their indescribable shades. The other precious 
old pieces have been 

Dipped in baths of hissing tears 
And battered by the shocks of doom. 

The study of structure in basketry, as in other activities, leads to 
investigations concerning functions and use. Among the least favored 
tribes in this regard there is a similarity to the lower forms of animal 
life where the same structure performs a number of processes. It is 
also common to see among plain sort of people and the uneducated 
one utensil used for many purposes. So with the little advanced 
tribes of Indians there will be one technical process in basket making 
and very small variety of forms for many uses, but whiMi the more 
advanced and skillful tribes are reached there is a differentiation of 
function and along with it corresponding differences in stiaicture and 
technical processes even in the same piece. 

In the study of function there are two inquiries of ociual value, 
namely, (1) the geographic distribution of functions together with 
the particular types of basketr}^ that are used to perform these offices 
from place to place, and (2) tribal origins and purposes in order to 
connect function with ethnological and geographical studies. In each 
one of the six areas into which the Western Hemisphere has been 
divided the uses to which baskets are put will be decided by the ani- 
mals, plants, and minerals that are indispensable to the happiness of 
the people, and the forms and characteristics of the baskets will 
depend upon the plants that are to l»e had for making them. On the 
seashore there must be clam baskets and tish baskets. In the interior 
there will be l^erry baskets; and in tliose regions where no pottery is 
to be found cooking Imskets, in which food is boiled b}^ means of hot 
stones, are among the commonest objects in sight. From the other 
point of view a more subtle question arises, wdiether ethnology has 
anj'thing to do with basket materials or things to be carried in them. 
In tracing the historj^ of invention during its primitive stages it will 
at once be recognized that the art of basket making was greatly stim- 
ulated by the multiplication of ends to be served; that the inventive 
faculty having such a versatile and accommodating material found 
scope for its own enlargement and improvement. In the end it be- 
comes apparent that the art and the artist have set themselves one to 
the other "like perfect music unto perfect words." The basket

adapts itself to the wouuurs life. It is not oas}^ to pin an}" spocial 
structure upon a delinite tril)e, liowever, since women were captured 
or ran away nia^'hap into other tribes. A quiet S3'steni of pedagogy 
was going on all the time in basl^etr}', as well as in other activities. 
The uses of ])asketry will be given in further detail, the topics arranged 
in alphal)etic order. 

An interesting phase of the struggle between use and beauty is to 
be seen in the compromises which d\ey make for space on the same 
basket. The jewel, the cremation chef d'oeuvre, the precious gift to 
a friend, may be covered with designs, have the most beautiful on the 
bottom, or where the makei'\s fancy led her. On the other hand, the 
piece for common uses is a despair of the artist; it is bereft of orna- 
ment. Among the Tlinkit of southeastern Alaska, while the covered 
trinket baskets are decorated to the ground, the cylindrical food 
baskets are plain near the bottom, and in many examples half the way 
up the body. This compromise in decoration is more apparent in the 
heav}' coiled work of the British Columbia tribes. Boxes for show, 
cradles, and such examples are surrendei'ed to the decorator, while the 
berry baskets and cooking pots have their decorations chiefly on the 
upper portion of the body. This fact limits the motives in the design. 
On old pieces it is melancholy to see how the hard wear of years litis 
invaded the sacred precincts of art and destroyed even the symbols of 
religion. On the California basketry art was predominant. The 
spirals descend nearly to the l)ottoms of the mush l)owls and the 
carrying baskets, but a glance reveals at the point of strain a patch 
of ordinarj" strong weaving or a protective covering. 

As i)reviousl_y mentioned, baskets are receptacles of some kind or 
other. They do not of themselves usually perform work, but are 
used for holding tlie materials and apparatus of work. The art of 
basketry, however — that is, the plication or working of somewhat 
rigid materials — easily passed out of the mere making of receptacles 
into the construction of all sorts of objects needed in dailv life. 

The uses of basketry are either industrial or ideal. Industrially, 
they are connected lirst with the whole range of ol)taining food or 
nourishment and the other natural materials upon which all history 
depends. 

With the secondary industries, called manufactures, with trans- 
portation, and with consimiption or enjoyment, one has but to take a 
stroll along the crowded dock, as in a great seaport, or the Ijusy ware- 
house of any modern city, to become familiar with the inlinite number 
of ways in which the basket lends its services to the comfort of the 
human race. 

All of these functions, so intricate and diversified in civilization, are 
represented in savagery by much more simple occupations, from 
which, however, the basket is never absent.

Beyond the drudg-eries of life lie its beatitudes, and here the basket 
is also present. In fine art, in social functions, in birth, in lore, in 
custom, and even in burial it is not absent. 

A detailed description of the way in which these functions are per- 
formed by basketr}', with abundant illustrations, will show just what 
is meant in these declarations. 

IN THE CARRYING INDUSTRY 

Carryino' in l)askets was done by the Americans on the head, on the 
back with head band or breast strap, and in the hands; about the 
home the basket was scarcely ever absent. It was the strongest of all 
Indian fabrics, easily made into any shape conv^enient to the load or 
the carrier, and it was lightness itself. In a hemisphere almost devoid 
of pack animals, where woman was the ubiquitous beast of burden, is 
it any wonder that she invented the most economical of devices for 
holding and transporting? Since nothing grows where it is wanted, 
an attempt to enumerate the things transported in baskets would be to 
list every natural material that contributed to the Indian's happiness. 
Mineral, vegetal, and animal substances are all in there. Clay from 
the quarry, water from the spring, stones for working, firewood, 
edible roots, fruits, and seeds, textile materials, fish, flesh, and fowl 
are a part of the freight ever on the move throughout the culture 
areas. 

The carrying basket did not lose its multitudinous functions for 
women with the departure of savagery. One has onl}- to look into 
market houses and stores, walk along the streets, or visit farms in the 
country to be convinced of this. 

They are borne on the head, shoulder, hips, or knees; they are hung 
to the body in every possible fashion, and carried by two or more 
persons with the hands — all for loading ships, cars, or wagons. They 
are used also as panniers on the backs of animals, and smaller and 
better specimens are used by the interminable procession of children 
and l)u_yers and travelers. 

The transportation basket did not cease as a stimulus to invention 
with its holding things and spurring the maker to do her best in its 
composition. It waked up her mind in other directions. Her feet 
had to be fith^ shod to gather materials; thus sandals were often in 
basket work. Her clothing required adjustments to new occupations 
and exposures in the new activities made possible by the art. Even 
the baskets of other functions were perfected and new functions were 
created by the carrying art.

boat which they call " cora," woven so ti^ht as to be waterproof 
without the aid of pitch or other application. And upon the .same 
parallel of latitude, along the Gulf of Mexico, the Indians used to 
cross the rivers on floats of cane woven together and called "cajen." 
Bundles of cane were laid together sidewise, and over them others, 
the whole being woven together.'^' 

Formerly mats were used by the Makah as canoe sails, but at 
present the}' are employed for wrapping up blankets, for protecting 
the cargoes in canoes, and for sale to the whites, who use them as linirg 
of rooms, or as floor coverings (James G. Swan). 

Besides the endless carrying of things among the Indians, called 

transportation, there is, it must 
not be forgotten, a large amount 
of passenger movement. The 
cradle, or, more correctly, the 
papoose basket, was the beginning 
of devices for carrying persons. 
Except a little riding by people 
of note on the backs of men in the 
Andes, only infants were passen- 
gers in aboriginal days through- 
out America. 

For the infant there were three 
zones of going about in the West- 
ern Hemisphere, the Arctic, the 
Temperate, and the Tropical; 
speaking technically, the zone of 
the fur hood, the zone of the car- 
rying frame, and the zone of free 
motion. The Atlantic province 
tribes made use of flat boards or 
racks, the Eskimo mother carried 
her babe safely ensconced in her 
ample hood of fur. The cradle 
of southeastern Alaska and the 
mainland near by were troughs, but most of the Pacific tribes made 
their papoose frames of basketr}^, and it is to these that attention is 
invited. In nearly all of them the feet and head are left free.^ The 
Hupa Indians, on the Hupa Reservation, in northwestern California, 
belong to the Athapascan family in Alaska and northwestern Canada, 
and that may account for the resemblance of their cradles in form 
to those of birch bark made by the tribes of that northern region.

Structunilly, they are in plain twined weaving, with here and there a 
row of Avnipped twine and false braid. In passing, it may be noted 
that these Hupa babies are not strapped on a board as among- the 
eastern tribes, nor are their heads bandaged as are those of the tribes 
along the coast of British Columbia." (See tig. 107.) 

IN DEFENSE AND WAR 

Basket armor of the tri})es on the Pacific Coast is made of narrow 
slats of wood, recalling those in the bottoms of some of the Lillooet 
Indian basicets in British Columbia. The slats are associated with 
straight rods of hard wood. These are woven with cords in regular 
twined weaving. The twine is finely spun and laid on so as to produce 
an ornamental effect upon the surface. This basket ornament has been

found in caves of the Aleutian Islands, also among the Tlinkit Indians 
of the Pacific Coast as far south as the Hupa Indians of the coast of 
California. In some specimens wicker weaving takes the place of 
twined weaving.^ 

An examination of Hough's Plates 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 11, and 15 will 
show how the weft of twine in basketry is transferred to slat armor 
worn anciently by the Tlinkit, Aleut, Takoo, Shasta, Hupa, and 
Klamath Indians was held together. 

Fig. 108, reproduced here, illustrates one in which the twined 
basketry was applied to this sort of armor.

342 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

The Massawomekes, on the Chesapeake Ba}', had similar basket 
shields or armor. Smith" speaks of them as made of little small 
sticks woven ""betwixt strings of thin hempe and silke grass," ])ut so 
hrmly that no arrow could possibly pierce them. Comparing this 
description with the figure above leaves no doul)t of the similarity of 
the defense on both sides of the continent. 

IX DRESS AND ADORNMENT 

Basketry, laying aside its chief function of holding something, is 
even now used extensively among many tribes in dress and adornment 
of the person. It was mentioned in the section on carrying that the 
exigencies of going about stimulated the inventive faculty not onl}- in 
the basket industry but in other crafts accessory to travel. The fore- 
most of these companion arts is that of sandal or shoe maker. It is 
true that boots of hide and moccasins of tawed skin are the commonest 
suppl}' of this want, but there is a vast portion of America where the 
sandal holds sway. They are made of tough fiber and woven in wicker, 
checker, twill, twined in a number of fashions. Some of the clifi'- 
dwellers' sandals are studies in weaving thi'ee and even four pl3\ 
Many of them are figured in a paper on Primitive Travel and Trans- 
portation.'^ (See Plate 87.) 

But, far more than the feet, the head claims the ])asket weaver's ar-t 
the world over. In America the basket hat clings to the Pacific slope. 
As soon as the Indian area is reached in southeastern Alaska the hat 
bursts into bloom. It is made not only for comfort, to save the eyes 
of the hunter from the glare, and to act as an umbrella, but the handy 
weaver, having first scoured the earth for the most delicate spruce 
root, exhausts her artistic skill in its composition. The Tlinkit 
woman and the Haida woman solve the problem difi'erentl}'. Given 
the task to make the most elegant hat that can be done in spruce root, 
the Haida artist relies upon her delicate fingers to get the result. 
Twined weaving is her technic, but plain and twill and three-ply are 
so happily blended that she discards color. The Tlinket, just a whit 
less refined in touch, or majbe not having such perfect material, 
resorts to color. The designs are not always wrought, but are fre- 
quently painted, while beard of seal, abalone shell, and beads exhaust 
the possil)ilities of decoration. These hats are made for men as well 
as women. Indeed, the finest are doubtless made for men to wear on 
the chase, with the conviction that a hunter must not only do his best 
but wear his best. 

The use of the basket in clothing reaches its climax in the California 
hats. In a description of the costume worn b}' Hupa Indians in

northern Calif orniii a larg'c collection of designs on their basket hats 
arc shown in Plates o, 4, and 5 in the Ray collection from the Hupa 
Reservation," and on Plate 6 of the same paper will !)e shown the 
relation of i)asketry to foot gear. (See Plate 88.) 

Excepting the head gear and the foot gear, the American Indian in 
places needed protection from rain and cold. I'he rolx^s made from the 
tender skins of rabbits and other small animals by cutting tliem into 
strips and making them into l)lankets by twined weaving were widely 
diti'used in Morth America from Virginia to the Pacific. Wherever 
the tough cedar bark abounded soft capes and rol)es were made there- 
from by the same women who made the liaskets. The rain cloaks of 
middle America, if they are not of oriental origin, are knotted and do 
not belong to basketry. Other ])asketry dress was chietiy ornamental. 
Leggings reaching to the knees made n\) by well-known processes are 
to be found. A great deal of ceremonial regalia, even that from buck- 
skin, is put together by ])asketmaker's [)rocesses. 

IN FINE ART AND CULTURE 

Basketry has been most useful as the patron of tine art and culture. 
Like all other human activities, it passes from the homely useful to the 
useless ))eautiful, and in so doing combines the two qualities whose 
union was long ago said to be the acme of excellence. The best art 
critics will saj^ that in man}' of their productions the American Indian 
woman had, l)y obeying the voices within, attained a high degree of 
excellence. The practice of this superb work, and the admiration of it, 
elevated her; her abject state is not her fault. 

There is no doubt that in the centuries of sorrow men have suH'ered 
more than women, since all their old occupations in which they excelled 
have been destro3'ed and hope with them; but the pride of excellence 
remained with the woman, who easily surpassed the whites in the work 
she was allowed to continue. That thousands of children are now 
being taught her art is witness of this. 

Plate 89 shows two coiled baskets from Tulare Count}", California, 
specimens of the combined art of three or four well-known basket- 
making stocks wdio have united at this point — the Shoshonean from the 
east, the ^Mission Indians from the south, and the makers of coiled 
basketry from the north. In the upper figure the basket ])owl is in 
open sewing over a grass foundation, with ornamentation in plain 
vertical stripes. Every item of form, color, and design in this speci^ 
men has in it the true element of art. 

The lower basket is jar-shaped, in closer weaving and more uniform 
in texture, but its design is especially attractive. The base is a rec- 
tangular outline, but the pattern is made up of hourglass form 

« Smithsonian Report, 1886, pp. 205-2:!8. 



344 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

flanked by two triang-les. The body color is that of the material, the 
hourglass is black, and the triangles in reddish brown. Especial 
attention is called to this figure. It occurs many times in the basketry 
in the Merriam collection. It is also seen in McLeod's specimens from 
the Kern County tribes. The symbolism is not known, nor is there 
any attempt at imitation of natural objects in these figures, which are 
natural size in the plate. 

Plate 90 shows the resources of the western California tribes of Men- 
docino County for heightening the l)eauty of ordinary coiled basketr3^ 
The abalone shell, having been ground away from the back, the nacre- 
ous surface becomes one of the most beautiful natural objects. The 
beadlike ornamentation aroimd the edges is the money of the tribes, 
the feathers are the crests of the partridge, and forming the body of 
the basket the plumage of various species of birds is sewed on in 
bands. These o])jects, of course, have no other value than to show 
the taste and skill of the maker, and they are chiefl}^ employed in 
making presents to friends, who are expected to give something quite 
as good in return. 

Emulation in aesthetic ideals and technical skill, a potent factor in 
education and refinement, found unrestrained opportunity in basketry. 
It is doubtful whether pottery excelled this art in the demand for 
scrupulous care in every movement. Many of the best pieces in Cali- 
fornia ware are marked with the monogram of the maker; and these 
special marks are often at the bottom of a piece, as though the artist 
with consciousness of excellence had felt the Horatian thrill when the 
poet wrote: Suhlhni feriain sidera vertice. 

A sense of beauty in detail was the motive which led the basket 
maker to search the fields and dig into the earth for fiber. It edu- 
cated her mind and sharpened her judgment. In order to secure the 
plume of the quail, the crest of the woodpecker, the shoulder tips of 
the blackbird, the mottled feathers of the duck, and more, the woman 
must catch her birds. So she becomes an inventor, more dangerous 
than the owl, more skillful than the hawk, more subtle than the ser- 
pent. At first the inventions were crude enough but effective in 
damming the waters and barricading the air. Ministering to these 
called forth a new grade of artificialities; culture grew by what it fed 
upon until it is not possible to comprehend in one grasp the multitude 
of materials, the variety of technical methods, the shapes, the designs 
and their meanings, involved in what one forlorn woman had to master 
in order to graduate in her art. 

Dr. Washington Matthews « figures the so-called Navaho basket 
plaque as a drum, and says that the art of basket making is little cul- 
tivated among them to-day, because it was neglected through the 
development of blanket weaving. The. material is the twigs of the

aromatic sumac. The work is done in coiled weaving. The founda- 
tion is in roots of the same matei'ial. and in starting the basket the 
butt of the rod is placed in the center, the tip tow^ard the periphery 
all the way to the end of the work Around the middle is a l)and in 
red, and branching from this band outward and inward triangles in 
black. The ]>and is not continuous, but at one point is intersected l)y 
a narrow line of a colored wood. At tirst this seemed to be an imita- 
tion of the Pueblo ""line of life" on pottery, but the Navaho line is 
put there to assist in the orientation of the ])asket in the medicine 
lodge when the light is dim. In plasdng their game the l)utts and 
tips of the Navaho give preference to the })utt end of the gamlding 
stick, associating the idea with that of the position of tiie warp in the 
coiled basket. When the basket is hnished the butt of the first twig 
and the tip of the last twig in the outer edge must be on a line with 
this radial opening. When the basket is used in ceremony this 
line must lie east and west. The stick for this drum is made from 
the leaves of the yucca bent together, wrapped and sewed. The 
dull ghosth^ sound accords well with the other portions of their 
ceremonies. 

IN PREPARING AND SERVING FOOD 

The basket is closeh" connected with the Indian kitchen and dining 
room, if these terms be allowed. After the purveyor has gleaned 
from the waters, the air, the range, or the field, with appropriate 
devices, and the patient carrier has emptied her baskets at the tent 
side, and forsooth the miller has put through their exercises cpiite 
another series, the cook and caterer take up the burden. She is gen- 
erally the selfsame woman who made the baskets and performed the 
forenamed drudgeries. But she is prepared for this task as well. 
There is first of all the mixing bowl or basket, about the shape of the 
bread trays in millions of kitchens. The coiled method suits the pur- 
pose, especially in their manufacture, since to be solid and water-tight 
are desirable, and weight is not an objection; yet there are tribes that 
make excellent mixing bowls in twined work. (See Plates 50, 53, 
92, 93.) 

It must not be supposed that basketry cooking pots are placed over 
a fire, as one of metal. Great preparation and skill are necessar}' to 
success. The basket must be substantial and water-tight; the proper 
kinds of stones must be selected and cleaned. After heating to a high 
degree they must be dipped into water to reduce the heat. A red- 
hot stone would spoil the broth, sure enough. Tongs of wood of a 
certain species and bent just so must be made ready, and paddles for 
incessant stirring." 

«For illustrations of cooking with hot stones see W. H. Holmes, Report of the 
U. S. National Museum, 1900, pp. 170-173, pis. 9-15. 



346 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

Plate 91 shows two of the best examples of Klikitat imbricated 
basketry. The foundation is seen in the basket exposed, consisting 
of a ])undle of rude splints of cedar root; the sewing is with prepared 
splints of the same material, and in both figures it will be seen that 
no ornamentation ever occurs on the inside of this type. The method 
of laying on the outer ornamentation has already been explained in 
the earlier part of this paper. 

The designs are made up of rectangular figures in the grass color 
for the body, with yellow material d3-ed with Oregon grape, cherry 
bark, and cedar bark. The designs represent in the upper figure 
geese migrating; the lower, some species of swamp plant. 

The border of the lower figure is in false braid, laid on the upper 
row of sewing. The stains on the lower basket show that it has ])een 
used in gathering berries for a long time; the upper one has not yet 
seen use. Both of them, however, are vessels for gathering and cook- 
ing food. 

This cooking with hot stones is mentioned by man}^ older writers, 
which proves that it was not an innovation with the discovery of 
America. After the cooking of the food, the next thing was the serv- 
ing of it, for which purpose there were a number of forms in basketry 
for holding the fish or mush and for the individual eater. 

Plate 92 represents a collection of baskets used for preparing and 
serving food. The lower figure is a cooking basket in which either 
mush or fish can be prepared to eat by means of hot stones. Spoons 
are made from the horns of the Rocky Mountain sheep or goats, and 
may be used for the individual eater. The upper basket is for drain- 
ing food or for holding fish or some hot substance and allowing the 
water to drain off. The other figure shows the method of twined 
weaving and introducing a new splint into the texture. 

Plate 93 shows two of the meal trays of the Hopi Indians in northern 
Arizona. When the coils are left open, as in these examples, they are 
said to have been made by an unmarried woman. The base or founda- 
tion of the coil is the shreds of 3'ucca stems and the sewing is done 
with the rib-like strips of the leaves. The colors used in dyeing are 
those employed also by the weavers in the same region, but of recent 
years common cheap dyes of traders have taken the place of the native 
colors. The mythology of the figures in the plaques is explained on 
page 333. 

Plate 94, from a photograph by G. Wharton James, shows a 3'oung 
unmarried woman of the Oraibi pueblo preparing the corn meal for 
bread making. The chimney is interesting as a first chapter in the 
history of draft. Fire is built in the corner of the room and a few 
adobe bricks supported on a log of wood form the flue. A few pieces 
of brick on the upper part of the roof continue the chimne3^ Other 
utensils common in the pueblo lifeari^ seen. The young woman wears 
her hair in the fashion of the tribe. 



ABOKIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 347 

IN GLEANING AND MILLING 

Gleaning- or harvesting, storing away, and milling, what a vast 
number of men are nowadays employed in them. Women arc not 
al)sent from them altogether in the United States and nothing is more 
common in the Eastern Hemisphere than to sec harvest lields and all 
activities associated with root and seed gathering thronged with them. 
The industrv was almost solely hers in America. Baskets are named 
for their part in these crafts. There are picking baskets, root baskets, 
berry ])askets, and on to the list of acorns, fruits, seeds, and roots 
without end. Carrying baskets arc universal, ))ut there are a great 
many of them used by this set of workwomen, and it will ])e found 
that special varieties have been devised for these pursuits. 

Also, as every other important invention calls for a host of subsidiary 
devices, there must be wands for beating off seeds, sieves for separat- 
ing grain from chaff', fans for the same purpose, roasting trays in 
which the raw material is parched before grinding. Brooms are 
made from l)askct liber, hoppers for the top of the millstone also, and 
the open, generous ]>owls to hold meal. All this is ])efore the cooking- 
processes are reached. If the meal is not to be used up at once, all thrifty 
tribes had learned to store up vegetable supplies against the day of 
need. The granary liasket was the rival of the pit and the wooden 
crib. There must have been something retining about this entire 
round of activities. In many of the baskets associated with them the 
ornamentation is exquisite. The hunter and the fisherman had scant 
encouragement to cultivate the {esthetic sense in their employments; 
but nuts, seeds, grain, most fruits, and roots are clean. Even berries 
when the}" stain do not soil the outer part of the receptacle, so the 
Eraser River tril)es adorn the upper portion of the ])askets with beau- 
tiful patterns. The lower part is left plain. The use of baskets in 
the plant quest was well-nigh universal. The eastern Indians employed 
the cane or split ash for their wicker or twilled baskets. As far as 
the cane extended, even to Guiana and Brazil, this is true. The 
ino'cnious cassava strainer belongs to this class. 

Plate 95 shows the domestic utensils of the upper Amazon tribes for 
various household purposes. Palm leaf, out of which fiber is made; 
the fiber itself, used in various forms of domestic utensils; baskets in 
two types, twined and crossed warp weaving. The cassava strainer on 
the left is in twined weaving, so that when the weights are taxed the 
bag is increased in size and the water forced out of the cassava. The 
specimen shown was collected for the U. S. National Museum by J. B. 
Steere. 

Lewis H. Morgan writes" that in the art of basket work, in all its 
varieties, the Iroquois Indian women also excel. Their baskets are 

« League of the Iroquois, 1851, j). 382, showing twined baskets. 



348 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

made with a neatness, ino-eniiity. and simplieit}' which deserve the 
highest praise. Splint is the chief material, but they likewise use a 
species of sweet grass, and also corn husks. Among- these various 
patterns, which are as diversified as convenience or ingenuitj^ could 
suggest, the most perfectly finished is the sieve basket. It is designed 
for sifting corn meal, to remove the chit and coarse particles after the 
corn has been pounded into Hour. The l)ottom of the l)asket is woven 
in such fine checks that it answers very perfectly all the ends of the 
wire sieve. Another variety of baskets was made of corn husks and 
Hags very closely and ingeniously braided. In their domestic economy 
the basket answered many purposes. Cat. Nos, 221161-3, U.S.N.M. 

From the historians of the disco^•erv it is learned that ])asketry was 
used in connection with the gathering and preparing of food. Bartram 
mentions the use of a sieve which the Indians of Georgia have for 
straining a "cooling sort of jelly called conti, made b}" pounding cer- 
tain roots in a mortar and adding water." Dumont describes the sieves 
and winnowing fans of the Indians of Louisiana. The Indian women, 
he says, make tine sieves with the skin which the}' take off of the canes; 
they also make some with larger holes, which serve as bolters, and 
others without holes, to be used as winnowing fans. They also make 
baskets very neath' fashioned, cradles for holding maize. By compar- 
ing this statement with what is said about the California gleaners it 
will be seen that the Louisiana tribes knew how to sift meal, leaving 
the coarse particles inside the sie^'e, and also to separate seeds from 
chaff, and finally from coarse material, by beating over the edge of a 
tightly woven basket. 

Du Pratz also sa^'s that for 

sifting tlie flour of their maiz, and for otlier uses, the natives make sieves of various 
finenesses of the splits of cane. 

John Smith, speaking of the Indians of Virg'inia, sa3^s they 

use a small basket for their Temmes, then pound againe the great, and so separating 
by dashing their hand in the basket, receiue the flowr in a platter of wood s(:raj)ed 
to that forme with burning and shels. 

Strachey makes the following statement: 

Their old wheat they firste steepe a night in hot water, and in the morning pound- 
ing yt in a morter, they use a small baskett for the boulter or seaver, and when they 
have syfted fourth the finest, they pound againe the great, and so separating yt l)y 
dashing their hand in the baskett, receave the flower in a platter of wood, which, 
blending with water, etc. 

There are no gleaning baskets in the Arctic and few in northern 
Canada. Birch, elm, and pine bark usurp the place of textile mate- 
rials. But all along the southern l)order there were gleaners and a 
variet}^ of basket forms in their hands. Maize, wild rice, roots, nuts, 
and berries were food staples. Checker matting, wicker basketry, 
and twined bagging supplied the receptacles. 

For the basket maker there are four Alaskas: — Athapascan, and 



ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 349 

Eskimo, where there is no g-leaning- or milling; Aleutian, in which 
the harvests come from the sea, and tlic daintiest of twined weaving- is 
made in grass stems; and southeastern Alaska, which shall receive fur- 
ther notice. Storage baskets are attributed to them by early voj-a- 
gers. Nowadays the ware is small, no piece exceeding- half a bushel in 
capacitv. Since seafaring- is mixed with hunting- and gleaning the 
fields, the g-athering basket leads a bus.y life. Plates 136-149 represent 
the types, which, larg-e and small, are chief!}' cylindrical in shape. The 
methods of manufacture and decoration have been described. 

In Gerstaecker's Journal is the following- account of seed gatherers 
in California: 

While I was standing there a couple of pretty, young girls came from the woods 
with fiat baskets full of flower seed emitting a peculiar fragrance, which, they also 
prepared for eating. They put some live coals among the seed, and, swinging it and 
throwing it together to shake the coals and the seed well and bring them to contin- 
ual and close contact without l)urning the latter, they roasted it completely, and the 
mixture smelled so beautiful and refreshing that I tasted a good handful of it, and 
found it most excellent (p. ^7b). 

Edwin Bryant, in his Rock}' Mountain Adventures, gives this 
description of the acorn harvest: 

We soon learned from them that they were a party engaged in gathei-ing acorns, 
which to these jioor Indians are what Avheat and maize are to us. They showed us 
large (iuantities in their baskets under the trees. When dried and pulverized, the 
flour of the acorn is made into bread or mush, and is their "staff of life." It is 
their chief article of sul^sistence in this set'tion of California. Their luxuries, such 
as bull beef and horse meat, they obtain by theft, or pa}' for in labor at exorbitant 
rates. The acorn of California, from the evergreen oak {Qnercus Hex), is much 
larger, more oily, and less bitter than on the Atlantic side of the continent. In 
fruitful seasons the ground l)eneath the trees is covered with nuts, and the Indians 
have the providence, when the produce of the oak is thus ])lentiful, to jirovide 
against a short crop and the famine which must necessarily result to them from it l3y 
laying up a supply greater than they Avill consume in one year (p. 240) . 

The Hupa Indians for collecting- seeds, according to Prof. P. PI 
Goddard, use the l)asket in the shape of a common burden basket in 
closely woven style. '^ They also made large storage baskets of close- 
twined work called djelo, the base being of greater diameter than the 
top." 

Plate 96 represents the harvesting outfit of the Hupa Indians on 
Hupa Reservation in northwestern California. There is the open- 
work-twined basket for picking- the seeds, the carrying basket in 
openwork with a decorated band at the top for bearing the crop home, 
the grauar}' basket, which bears significant!}^ on the outside the image 
of destructive worms that eat the crop after it is harvested. The 
woman's head has a pad of soft-twined worlv on the foreliead, across 
which the buckskin band of the carrying baslvet rests. The outfit of

the mill consists of a large basket at the bottom for catching the acorn 
meal and millstone set in this for grinding-, a hopper basket, most 
elal)orately made, resting on the rock to hold the acorns that are being- 
ground. A similar hopper is shown below, both in its form and struc- 
ture. The pestle for grinding the acorns and the broom for sweeping 
up the meal complete the paraphernalia. Throughout the entire acorn 
area implements resembling these will be found. 

The outfit for the Pomo acorn mush maker in Mendocino County, 
California, is illi>.trated by V. K. Chesnut" in his paper on Plants 
Used l)y the Indians of Mendocino County, California (fig. 71 and 
Plates 13, 18), issued in 1902, by the Department of Agriculture, 
Washington. 

It consists of eleven pieces: The picking basket for the individual 
gatherer; the holding basket for receiving the contents of number 
one; the cone-shaped carrying basket, with headband; the granary 
basket at the home, holding two or more bushels, many of them have 
beautifvil covers; the basket hopper, open at the l)ottom to fit on the 
mortar stone, the work of strengthening these tax the ingenuity of 
the weaver; the mat for the meal to be placed under the millstone; the 
sifting plaques, in openwork for coarse separating and tightly woven, 
for shaking the waste over the edge; the cooking pot of the closest 
weaving; the dipper; the eating bowls, and the daintily woven basket 
hat. 

William H. Holmes illustrates at length the acorn harvesting and 
milling industr}- in northern California, carrying and hulling the nuts, 
pounding them in stone mortars, grinding the meal, separating the 
coarse particles, cleaning the meal by shaking and blowing, leaching 
in sand and using hot stones for cooking in basket pots.''^ 

Plate 97 is a group of baskets in plain-twined weaving (Bamtush) 
in the collection of C. P. Wilcomb, of San Francisco, It consists 
of a conical carrying basket, mill hopper, granary basket, and mush 
bowl. The carrying basket is in plain-twined work throughout. Even 
the narrow bands near the top are no exception, for though each 
twist in the twine passes over two warp stems, on the next round the 
same two are included in the twist above. Casting the eye upward will 
show that in the upper band next to the border the same motive occurs, 
but the same pairs of stems are not inclosed in the twist. The eti'ect 
of this ornament is quite pleasing, as the two bands with intervening 
space form an endless zigzag pattern. The border of this basket is 
formed by bending the warp stems down as the foundation of a coiled 
work which is strengthened by a hoop of wood. The bands of orna- 
mentation on this and the other baskets in this group is explained 
under "Symbolism."

The mill hopper is also in plain-twined weavino-, strengthened with 
three narrow^ bands of tee weavino-. The granary basket and the mush 
bowl are noteworthy especially on account of the peculiar method of 
finishing- the work l)y merely cutting otf the warp stems. 

Plate 08 represents two specimens in the collection of C. P. Wilcomb, 
both of them from Tulare County, California. Tlie upp<'r figure is a bowl 
connected with ))()dy in twined weaving. The diameter is l-i,| inches. 
The ornamentation is in four bands, the lower broken, the second in 
chevron pattern, the third human figures, the fourth the standard hour- 
glass pattern. On the margin iire spots in ])lack material in grou]3s of 
fours. The lower figure represents a typical mortar stone with pestle 
and hopper, in this case glued to the upper surface of the millstone. 
The ornamentation on the up]3er is also the standard band of hexagonal 
figures. 

Plate 99 represents a Yokut woman on the Tule River Reservation 
shaking acorn meal and sifting it for making mush. 

In Plate 100, the same collection, is represented a Havasupai (Yuman) 
Indian woman screening corn in a roasting basket with hot stones and 
blowing out the chati', using the specimen both for parching and clean- 
ing the seeds. 

Plate 101 shows a Coahuilla (Shoshonean) woman grinding acorn 
tlour on a mortar stone, on the top of which has l)een cemented a hop- 
ptn* ))asket with open bottom. This method of grinding is extremely 
old, inasmuch as some of the pieces of ancient baskets in prehistoric 
graves, found by Mr. Pepper and others, are in this tjqDC and stitch 
of basketry. 

Speaking of the Apache Indians and others farther south, Capt. John 
G. Bourke mentions their fanning trays for grinding the seeds of grasses. 
Hot stones are placed in them, with the coarse material and the chafi' is 
burned out. The Captain also mentions that the trays are wet to keep 
them from burning. This can not ])e a universal practice, because in 
some of the specimens in the Museum the texture is very nmch charred. 

Plate 102 shows the most primitive form of storage, holding several 
bushels, used by the Mohave Indians in the desert between Mexico 
and southern Arizona. It resembles more a bird's nest than a textile 
pre})aration. The specimen is in the Field Columbian Museum, Chi- 
cago, and to the courtesy of C. L. Owen and G. C. Simms I am 
indebted for the photograph. 

The Mohave and other tribes have curious granaries for storing 
mesquite beans, corn, etc., near their houses. A platform is con- 
structed on high poles; upon this is placed a round, bottomless l)asket 
from 3 to 5 feet in diameter and 2 to 3 feet deep. These are made 
of arrow- weed stalks tightly interwoven. When filled the top is 
sealed with mud to keep out rain. In specimens examined l)y Owen 



352 EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

and Simms, of the Field Columbian Museum, several of these nest-like 
baskets were clustered on the same platform and a rude fence served 
for inclosure.'^ 

IN HOUSE BUILDING AND FURNITUEE 

House and furniture were here and there constructed of basket 
work, so the basket maker became architect and cabinetmaker. Of the 
former, the wall may have been constructed like a huge, coarse basket, 
with upright stakes for warp and brush, canes, rushes, or leaves of 
palm for weft. The roof, also, especially in its framework, was in some 
tribes an immense shallow basket bottom inverted. The rafters were 
the parallel or radiating warp and the interlacing vines the openwork 
woof into which many kinds of thatch were fitted. 

Accessor}^ to the house, whether a woven structure or not, were 
fences, awnings, screens, and shelters. They were woven after the 
fashion of the walls. In middle America and the tropical portions of 
South America, but far more skillfully in the Philippine Islands and 
all about the Indo-Pacific, the mat and light basketry serve for seclu- 
sion and decoration among the houses. Open checkerwork, twilled 
weaving, wattling, or twined textile are as effective as they are light 
and easily put together. When they were moving about, or in situa- 
tions where a compact dwelling would have been burdensome, it was 
an atiair of only a few moments to imitate the nest-building birds and 
throw together a wickiup or leaf shelter of some kind. 

The winter houses of the Pomo Indians were a rude kind of feath- 
ered basketry. They are described by Carl Purdy * as domes of wicker- 
work, thatched heavily with grass or tules (p. 443, with illustration). 
The summer houses were of wickerwork covered with boughs, and 
the tribe moved several times a year as acorns, fish, game, or dry 
quarters were desirable. They solved the problems of transportation 
b}' moving themselves about. 

Furniture had not the pretentious meaning that it possesses in civ- 
ilization. The bed for the Indians was the most desirable luxury. 
Their chairs were mats of many styles of weaving and many colors. 
All of them were plicated ])y hand and were the production of the 
basket maker. 

But the bed was not always a basket. In the North it was the 
warmest fur and rol)es; in man}' tribes the mat took the place of the 
robe, and over a wide area the hammock was chair Iw da}^ and l)ed at 
night. In some of these the twine is knotted or netted and the ham- 
mock is in no sense a basket. Throughout the Southwest a resting 
device is formed by the very ancient basket-makers' process of string- 
ing a number of stifi' rods together b}^ three or more rows of weaving.

IN MORTUARY CUSTOMS 

The ba.sket is intimately associated with Indian life in the " last act." 
Not onl}' fa])rics woven in basketry technic were wrapped a])out the 
dead and used to protect the bod\', but on the sentimental side exam- 
ples of the finest workmanship were either (le]iosited or burned with 
their makers. Phite lo4 is taken from Pepper's account of the basket- 
making- Indians of Utali, and is interesting as exhibiting the method of 
burial among the ancient tribe of southeastern Utah in the canyon 
country. These old people must have lived long in these curious 
retreats, ft)r on top of their graves are found deposits made by later 
tribes. The corpse was placed in tlie hollow of a rock, covei'ed with a 
rabbit-skin robe made in twined weaving. On top of all was turned 
upside down a coiK'd basket. The plate shows the method of admin- 
istering the l)lanket and the ])asket, and the lower figure of the plate 
declares the type and style of weaving used by these ancient ])asket 
makers. The foundation is of three-rod type. The four figures on 
the surface near the margin are like the butterfly design seen on some 
modern ware, but the symbol is not known. Horatio N. Rust tells of 
a young Indian girl who was dying of consumption. She wore on her 
person a small l)ask(>t of ))eautiful workmanship and gave it to a young- 
American, begging him to have her buried in a coffin and the little 
basket placed within. 

Another Indian, Roherio ))v name, living in the southern California 
country, tells of his wife, who, when dying, called him to her and said: 
Take my basket cap, which I have always worn since 1 have been 
3'our wife, and burn it, with everything that is mine. He obeyed her 
and burned two truidvs full of personal property. 

Clarence King describes vividly, in his Mountaineering in the Sierra 
Nevadas, a cremation scene: 

In tlie opening between the line of Iiuts a low pile of dry logs had Ijeen carefully 
laid, upon which, outstretched and wrapped in her blanket, lay the dead form of 
"Sally," the old basket maker, her face covered in careful folds. Upon her heart 
were the grass-woven water bowl and her latest jiapoose basket. The flames slowly 
lapped over, consuming the blanket, and caught the willow papoose basket. When 
the husband saw this the tears streamed from his eyes; he lifted his hands elo- 
quently, looking up at the sky and uttering heartliroken sobs. All of the Indians 
intoned in pathetic measure, " Himalaya, Himalaya," looking first at the mound of 
fire and then out upon the fading sunset. 

The desert region of Peru was favorable to the preservation of 
delicate textiles, and it is in the cemeteries of this region that large 
quantities of basketry in every style of weaving here descriV)ed have 
])een found." (For lace work see Plate 105.)

Report of the Peabody Museum, pp. 280-292.

354 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

IN RELATION TO THE POTTER'S ART 

Potten" and basketry were in America, especially among the savage 
tribes, both the work of women. Before answering the question how 
far one art was useful to the other, attention must be called to the fact 
that in eastern United States both prevailed almost universall}'. In 
the Arctic, excepting the rude pottery of Alaska on Bering Sea, and 
on the Pacific from Mount St. Elias to Santa Barbara Islands, the 
tribes made only basketry. Those of the interior basin and all south- 
ward were expert in both. 

It was formerly believed that in the eastern division of the United 
States, especially, pottery was made to a large extent in basketry. 
Eminent students held this opinion and there seemed to be abundant 
evidence of its truth. Gushing figures a basket with clay inside to 
protect the former in the cooking of seeds and grains." 

Holmes now believes that the extent to which good baskets were 
used for modeling pottery in this province has been greatly overesti- 
mated. There are innumerable examples of basketry and other textile 
markings on earthenware, and he divides them into five classes. 

1. Impressions from the surface of rigid textile forms. 

2. Impressions from cloth and nets. 

3. From woven textures used over the hand or modeling implement. 
•I. From cords wrapped about modeling paddles or rocking tools. 

5. Impressions of bits of cords or other textile units, singly or in 
groups, applied for ornament only and so arranged as to produce 
textile-like patterns. 

In modeling a clay vessel a basket might be used as a support and 
pivot. It might assist in shaping the bodies of vessels, assuming to a 
limited extent the limits of a mold. Also, the mat upon which a 
plastic form rests will leave impressions that firing will render indel- 
ible. The tribes of the Pima linguistic family produce jars and baskets 
of the same shape; but if a row of Zufii or the Hopi pottery be compared 
with a row of their basketry they would not suggest that either one 
was the predecessor and occasion of the other. Laying aside the 
inquiry whether the basket was the progenitor of the pot, inasmuch as 
the same hands often produced both, the former unwittingly rendered 
itself immortal by its many little helpful attentions to the latter in its 
formative stage. The pot was afterwards fired and worn out and 
broken into fragments that were buried out of sight. In these last 
years the archeologist exhumes the shards, washes them carefully, and 
makes casts of their surfaces in plaster or artist's clay. A glance 
shows that, though the surfaces of the shards are much worn awa}" by 
time, the lines in the little cavities are as sharp as when the clay and

the Iniskct made oiicli other's acquaintauce centuries ago. (See Phites 
!(»(>, 107.) 

In the shards examined by P^g-gers and Hohnes one fact is preserved 
that no historian recounts, namely, that twined l)asketr3^ as varied and 
l)eautiful as that of the Aleutian Islanders was made by the tribes in 
the Mississippi Valley before the fifteenth century. 

AS A RECEPTACLE 

Very few of the Indian tribes of America were so unsettled in life 
as to be without a home. About such a place accumulated personal 
property and provisions for the future, large and small. On the Great 
Plains of the West, receptacles were made of rawhidi^ gaudily painted. 
On the MacKenzie drainage, bark of the white birch was the material, 
decorated with (luills of the porcupine dyed in many colors. But for 
holding the bone awl and the sinew thread, the trinkets belonging to 
dress, the outfits of tisherman and hunter, the l>asket and the wallet were 
well-nigh universal. In the industries and other activities of life in 
which materials, utensils, apparatus, in a word, things were involved, 
there were receptacles for holding them. The basket maker herself 
has a kit of appliances for making her wares. 

One of the primary functions of ])asketrv, if not the very first, was 
to contain or restrain something. The weir, fence, wing of the game 
drive, wall of the house, besides many smaller objects of the coarsest 
weave were invented long ))efore basketry became cooking utensils or 
works of ceremony. The myriads of Indian baskets sold at railroad 
stations and summer resorts have gone ))ack to first principles and are 
made for the sole purpose of holding. 

In the north the small tools of the fur worker and trinkets are 
easily lost in the snow. The workl)asket or something in its stead is 
universal. About Point Barrow the Tinne (Athapascan) Indians make 
coiled baskets in se\eral styles of weaving. These are traded to the 
Eskimo. On the Bering seacoast of Alaska rougher trinket cases 
appear. The Attn makers of dainty wallets in grass, living away out 
on the Aleutian chain, are quite as skillful in the manufacture of cigar 
cases, which, ])y the way, are nothing more than two of their old-fash- 
ioned cjdinders fitted one into the other and fiattened. Receptacles of 
basket wood, with no other function than just to hold things, are to be 
found in all the areas of the Western Hemisphere, in all sizes from 
the granary down to the sheath for an awl, in every one of the tech- 
nical processes and in every degree of fineness. It is the one function 
of universal application. 

Plate 108 is an ammunition holder in twined Ixisketry from the 
Tlinkit Indians of Sitka, Alaska. It is ornamented b}^ false embroid- 
ery. The interesting fact concerning this specimen is that as soon as 
these Indians came in contact with the Russians they began to imitate 



356 BEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

modern forms of apparatus in textile material. This telescope ))asket 
was used b}^ the owner for holding caps, l)ullets, or other delicate objects 
for huntincr. It also shows that the acculturation of form did not begin 
recently, but took place as soon as the Indian woman's eye rested 
upon some novel and attractive form. This specimen is Catalogue No. 
1156 in the U. S. National Museum and was collected by James G. 
Swan. 

Plate 109 represents a woman\s workbasket of the Tlinkit Indians, 
of southeastern Indians, in twined weaving, ornamented in false 
embroidery. Doubtless the form is derived from Russian motives, 
but it is extremely common among the Indians in this locality and is 
useful in a thousand ways for holding material. This specimen was 
collected in Sitka, Alaska, b}^ J, J. McLean. 

The Fraser River tribes in British Columbia illustrate also what is 
said a])out the power of suggestion in modifying form, and even 
structure, in an art. The bulk of their stalwart baskets are made for 
cooking and harvesting apparatus. But where the Hudson Bay 
Conipany's and Malayo-Pacihc packages came into view, another class 
of baskets appeared, fashioned in their shapes and ornamented over 
their entire surfaces. (See Plates 43 and 1:4.) 

IN RELIGION 

The one who carried the sacred basket in the Greek religious pro- 
cessions was called the Kanephoros, and it will be remembered that in 
the consecration of Aaron and his family to the priesthood, among the 
multitude of paraphernalia was the basket of shew bread." 

In one tribe, at least, of American aborigines — the Hopi of north- 
eastern Arizona — bread consecrated to the service of religion is set 
before the altar in l)eautiful plaques of coiled and wicker l)asketry, on 
which the emblems of religion are wrought in coloj's. 

By religion is meant beliefs about a spirit world, with all its inhab- 
itants and their relations with mankind; this is creed, and (udt, or 
worship. " The best for the gods " is the talisman in the rudest faiths 
as in the highest. So it will be found that basketr}^ devoted to religion 
is worthy of its object. 

In the autumn, during the months of September and October, the 
Hopi Indians of northeastern Arizona celebrate their basket dances. 
They have been studied by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes and J. G. Owen. 
The basket dance is a public exhibition, closing a series of secret rites, 
the whole festival being called LaJahmtl. It is rather a posturing of 
the body in rhythm, together with songs, during which baskets are 
carried by women or thrown as gifts among the assembled spectators. 

Those taking part in these dances are in two groups — the basket 

« Leviticus, viii, 2. 



ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 857 

bearers, or chorus, iiiid the basket throwers, or Lahme 'tucoHis. The 
only man participating is a priest called the Lal'one fal-a. 

The costumes of the participants, the method of holdini;- and throw- 
ino- the baskets, and the struggles of the men for the specimens are 
all carefully described by Dr. Fewkes." 

In archaeological studies at the Chevlon ruins, al)out 15 miles cast 
of Winslow, Arizona, a large amount of l^asketry was found in the 
graves. Much of it had the form of plaques like those still used in 
Oraibi and the Middle Mesa. The inhabitants of the old pueblos at 
Chaves Pass were also clever basket makers, and had the same beliefs 
as their descendants concerning the kinship and close relationships of 
life between spirit beings and men. 

With reference to these basket dances. Dr. Hough says the baskets 
used are shallow, circular trays, either coiled or wicker, invariably of 
Hopi manufacture and all decorated in colors. The designs on the 
Lahd-oiiti ])askets are various, and there seems to be a greater use of 
symbolic ligures than in those specimens commonly offered for sale. 
In some examples the designs are conventionalized merely to the 
extent of adapting them to the held of the basket and the exigencies 
of the weaving. In most cases, however, the design is in the last 
stages of convention and the original motive is lost. 

Plate 110 shows the portion of the Hopi Lalakontl ceremony in 
which the baskets are introduced by the young ^vomen. 

The uses of baskets of the plaque type by the Moki may throw light 
on the reason for their occurrence in the '■'l)asket dances.'"' In the 
household these plaques are devoted to various purposes; ground 
meal is heaped upon them in high cones l)y the grinders, or dry food, 
such as piki bread or dried peaches, is served in them. A basket being 
difficult and la))orious in construction and high priced, besides being 
easily soiled and unsuitable for the uses to which pottery is put, is 
emplo}^ed in cases of nicety, or, one might say, of luxury. Wh(Mic\ (m- 
presents are exchanged it is proper to carry them on })asket trays. 

Baskets form an important part of the paraphernalia of the religious 
fraternities, being used to at least as great an extent as pottery for 
containing sacred meal, the prayer-stick offerings, etc. Usually new 
plaques are prepared for sacred use upon the altars and in the service 
of the fraternities, notably the Lalahjiifl. It may be found that 
plaques are almost entirely of ceremonial import. 

Sometimes baskets are placed on the walls of rooms as a decoration. 
This was observed at Sichomovi, where a frieze of Cohonino baskets 
decorated a room in iho house of Wa lu tha ma. 

The use of baskets in religious ceremonies ))y the Navaho Indians 
is described in Dr. Matthews's paper, The Mountain Chant, a Navaho

IN SOCIAL LIFE 

Baskets played a role in the etiquette of the Indians. The Choc- 
taws, in sending a gift of fruit, use a heart-shaped l)asket to conve}^ 
a sentiment of sincerit3\ (See Plate 134.) The wedding basket of 
the Pomos is an exquisite production in twined weaving. During a 
marriage festivity the bride's mother presents her son-in-law with a 
large, handsome basket, which he nuist immediately till with cakes and 
pine sugar for the guests. It is thereafter known as chi-mo pi-ka, or 
dowry. On such occasions the artist is incited by a combination of 
powerful motives to do her best. Among the same Indians the gift 
basket, presented by the maker as a token of friendship, is a master- 
piece not only in fineness, l)ut in the exquisite sentiments of its design. 
In the National Museum are good examples both of the wedding and 
of the gift baskets. (See Plates 112-114.) 

The Gualala style of gaml)ling, says Powei's, prevails all over the 
state, but the Tulare have another sort, which pertains exclusively 
to the women. It is a kind of dice throwing, and is called U-cJik-ux. 
For a dice the}^ take half of a large acorn or wahuit shell, fiK it level 
with pitch and pounded charcoal, and inlay it with Ijits of bright-colored 
abalone shells. For a dice table they weave a very large, fine basket 
tray, almost fiat, and ornamented with devices woven in black or brown,

mostly rude imitations of trees and g-eometrical figures. Four squaws 
sit around it to play, and a fifth keeps tally with fifteen sticks. There 
are eight dice and they scoop them up with their hands and dash them 
into the basket, counting one when two or five flat surfaces turn up. 
(See Plates 115, 116.) 

The rapidity with which the game goes forward is wonderful, and 
the players seem totally oblivious to all things in the world beside. 
After each throw that a player makes she exclaims yd-nl (equivalent 
to " one-y "), or vu-a-tak^ or Jco-mai-eh., which are simply a kind of sing- 
song or chanting. One old squaw, with scarcely a tooth in her head, 
one eye gone, her face all withered, but Avith a lower jaw as of iron, 
and features denoting extraordinary strength of will — a reckless old 
gambler, and evidently a teacher of the others — after each throw 
would grab into the basket and jerk her hand across it, as if by the 
motion of the air to turn the dice over before they settled, and ejacu- 
late wiatnk. It was amusing to see the savage energy with which this 
fierce old hag carried on the game. The others were modest and spoke 
in low tones, but she seemed to be unaware of the existence of any- 
body around her. ^^ 

The plates show two varieties of the Yokut gambling trays, the flat 
and the dished. The former is in the National IVluseuui, collected b}^ 
AV. H. Holmes; the latter is in the C. P. Wilcomb collection, collected 
on the Tule River. 

IN TRAPPING 

One of the earliest and most primitive uses of basketiy textile was 
in connection with the capture of animals. In a paper on traps pub- 
lished by the Smithsonian Institution, * the word tnfj) is defined as 
""an invention for inducing animals to commit self-incarceration, self- 
arrest or suicide.'" The basketry traps are used principally for pen- 
ning or impounding animals and not for killing them. In every one of 
the areas mentioned, coarse wickerwork or twined weaving are used in 
this function and there is little doubt that many of the very finest pro- 
cessses of weaving by hand were derived originally from coarse work 
of this character. 

The Pomo Indians make a trap for catching fish from Jimcm^ eifasus. 
The interesting feature about these objects is that they are a gross 
production in brush of the rare Mohave carrying basket, in which the 
weft is wrapped once about each warp element in passing.

IN CARRYING WATER 

Nearl}' everywhere throughout the ^\'estern Hemisphere the Indian 
was encamped near springs of water, and in his journeys about for 
hunting and other purposes knew always wliero to obtain it. An 
exception to this is the arid region of the western portion of the United 
States. 

Among the Shoshonean tribes and in the pueblos, seeking out, car- 
rying, and storing water was the chief industry and most of the relig- 
ious ceremonies and prayers were with reference to rain. 

The canteen and the larger carrying jar among the sedentary tribes 
was of pottery, but w ith the Utes, Apaches, and other unsettled tribes 
these vessels were of water-tight basketry made with round or conical 
bottom, so that in settling on a level the center of gravity would bring 
the vessel into an upright position and thereb}' keep the water from 
spilling. (Plates 32, 33.) 

The transportation and storage of drinking water is one of the 
functions of pottery. A(iuarius, the water beai'er of the sk}", is repre- 
sented with a jar in his hands, and the spirits that haunt the springs in 
classic mythology are all of them friends of the potter. The Indians 
of the Atlantic area were well supplied with water and had vessels of 
clay. The Eskimo made bottles of sealskin; so did the tribes of the 
Pacitic coast as far south as the Columbia. But in the interior Basin 
of the ITnited States, Indians of the Shoshoean, Athapascan, and Yuman 
families substitute basketry for pottery in their canteens, jugs, pitch- 
ers, and small tanks. These are made in coiled or twined ware, and 
sealed with pine tar in the north and asphaltum in the south. It is 
probabl}^ owing to the unsettled life of these tribes that they out and 
out invented this ingenious substitute for fictile ware. There is no 
lack of clay, for pueblos in the midst of the region are the last strong- 
holds of Keramos in America. And there was in pre-historic times no 
lack of pottery there, as the supply of charming whole pieces and 
precious fragments bear witness. 

The most interesting connection of hydrotechny with basketr}- was 
discovered in a cliff-dwelling 3 miles north of White River Agenc}^ 
on tiie A\'hite Mountain Apache lieservation, Arizona, by Charles L. 
Owen, of the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago. On the floor of the 
cavern baskets were built without bottoms. The warp was of willow 
shoots with the leaves on. The weft was in juniper and willow twigs 
in twined weaving or wattling. The interstices were filled with pud- 
dled clay, to make them useful for receptacles of water, which had to 
be transported from the canyon 300 feet below. An example l)rought 
away, No. (58876 in the Field Museum, measures 4 feet 10 inches in 
diameter and is 1,5 to 20 inches in height. (See Plate 102.) 

The occurrence of basketr}^ water receptacles is a good problem in

tlio study of the paralleloorain of ,sul)i('cti\-c uiul objective forces which 
oiiojnated and developed special arts in primitive^ times everywhere. 
In this particiihir example, the orioinators of ceiiient-tlghten(xl l>ask(>ts 
had o()()d textile material, knew the arts of weaving" them, w(M-e on the 
move in desert countries where water sources were far apart, and 
could easily secure the pine sap or the asphaltum for tightening' 
purposes. 

Plate 117 illustrates the water jug or pitcher of larger size, called 
O-oats by the Paiutes. Most of these are in coiled weaving-, but 
even there a variety of technic is shown both in the foundation and 
in the sewing. 

The upper tigure is a pitcher-shaped water carrier with globular 
body, used also for holding seed. The coiled foundation is of two or 
more lods, the stitches are wide apart and oveilap in what is called in 
Porno, t'<a! work. The l)order is in oblique coiled sewing, and the 
handle is an afterthought set on the neck. Its height is 10 inches. 
This specimen. Cat. No. 11249 in the National Museum, was collected 
in southt^rn I'tah hy Major J. W. Powell. 

The lower tigure is a much neater specinien in which the foundation 
is a single rod and in sewing the stitches simpl}^ interlock with those 
underneath, giving a very nnich more regular form to the surface. 
The border is in oblique coiled sewing-. There are lugs on the side 
for the purpose of carrying, and the headband is of soft deerskin. 
This specimen is Cat. No. 11S7»> in the U.S.N.M., and also was col- 
lected in southern Utah by Major J. W. Powell. 

The Powell collection contains a large number of these carrying- jars 
in coiled work. They differ in the form of the body souK^what and in 
the length and shape of the neck, 1)ut in other respects, in sti'ucture and 
function, they are the same. 

Plate 118 shows two Navaho Indian girls carrying water in their 
txsjehs^ or l)asket jars, after (1. Wharton James." The photograph is 
ititerestitig also in illustrating the two methods of suspending ])urdens 
employed ])y the Indians. The girl on the right has a band across the 
top of her head,* while the one in the rear supports the load from her 
shoulders. The latter method is also conunon in the south, especially 
in Mexico. The 1)askets are made in coiled weaving and dipj)ed in 
])itch to make them water-tight.

VII. ETHNIC VARIETIES OF BASKETRY 

For all arts belonging to humanity havo a common bond and aru included, as it were, in the same 

kinship. — Cickro. 

The technical processes, the decorations, and the synil)olism that 
may exist in the single basket having- been scrutinized, it is in order 
to examine the geographic distribution of these forms in relation to 
ethnology and environment. Geography has much to do with human 
enterprises. It does not furnish the ingenious mind nor the skillful 
hand, but it does supply their materials for their exercise and set 
bounds in which the mind and hand soon discover how to reach their 
best. 

America Avas, in aboriginal times, unequally occupied by native 
peoples. On the Atlantic slope in both continents vast areas were in 
possession of single linguistic groups called families. On the Pacitic 
slope there were also a few influential families, but the rule was 
otherwise. Wedged in among the moiuitains wherever there was an 
inclosure abounding in food supply there were crowded what seemed 
to be shriveled remnants of once larger peoples, or fragments of dis- 
rupted families. 

At once arises the query, Did they bring with them and preserve 
uncontaminated the stitches and patterns of their priscan basketry and 
keep the ancient models unchanged? It is to be feared that they did 
not, and that is why the ethnologist becomes embarrassed in trying to 



364 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

harmonize ethnology and technology. There are, notwithstanding, 
certain general effects which may be associated with definite peoples. 

1. In the Eastern province the prevailing families were Algonquian, 
lro(|uoian, Muskhogean, Caddoan, and a few remnants of smaller 
ones, in some instances numbering at present less than a hundred p*er- 
sons. The Siouan and other buffalo-hunting tribes on the plains will 
be omitted because the hide of the slain animals furnished them with 
receptacles as well as other conveniences of life. The basket makers 
in their territor}- belong elsewhere. 

2. In the Alaskan province an interesting state of affairs existed 
with reference to the matter here investigated. In the interior of the 
peninsula are the Athapascan (or Tinne) tribes. Around the coast 
line dwell members of the Eskimauan family, having entirely different 
materials, workmanship, and technical processes. It will be seen 
later that the Eskimo as a whole are not skillful basket makers. There 
has been contact, however, between the two linguistic families. The 
Aleutian peoples are ver}^ different in this art from the Eskimo, their 
ware being among the most highly admired on the continent. In 
southeastern Alaska the Koloschan family are found, who are different 
from the Athapascans in the interior of the peninsula in that they do 
not make coiled basketry at all. The same is true of the Haida or 
Skittagetan family, in the Queen Charlotte Archipelago. 

3. In the Frazer-Columbia province, including the drainage of these 
great rivers, the Salishan family, the Wakashan, the Shahaptian, and 
the Chinookan are the present basket-making families. As in the 
Siouan areas, so here a few small fragments or surviv^als till in the 
gaps and waste places, but contribute little to the technical processes 
involved. In the discussion of basketry in this province a special 
characteristic will be brought out. 

4. The Calif oi'uia province, including also southern Oregon, is the 
most mixed of all in its ethnology. Many stocks of people whose 
languages are not known elsewhere, and many fragments of stocks 
that have a larger existence in other parts of America, are wedged 
into the mountain valleys and drainages of the streams. Nature has 
been most lavish here in her materials, and the tinest textile plants for 
making baskets are to he found in California. The diversity of technic 
is ahnost as great as that of language. Few styles of weaving or coil- 
ing exist that do not have their representatives among this intermin- 
able labyrinth of valleys. 

5. The Desert, or Interior province, is occupied in its northern 
portion l)y the great Shoshonean family, which extends from the 
forty-ninth parallel to Costa Rica, pushes its way over the Rocky 
Mountains into the Mississippi drainage and across southern California 
to the Santa Barbara .islands on the Pacific coast, giving and receiving 
technical suggestions in its way. In the southern portion of this 



ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY, 805 

interior province, Athapascan tribc.s, the iS'avaho and the Apache, 
the Yuiuau, and the Piman family arc basket makers. 

6. Tlie sixth province includes Middle and South America, not 
because all the basketr}" in these reg'ions is on the same plane, but 
owing- to the small collections received from these (juartiM-s. A g-reat 
poi'tion of it is in the Torrid zone, where palm leaf and tough cane 
and reeds await the basket maker. There will be missing the charac- 
teristics of the North American tribes, and also local weaves will appear 
worthy of stud3\" 

Unlike pottery, this fabric is not destroyed by frost, so that wher- 
ever textile material could be o))tained there was no meteorological 
reason wh}' the basket should not ])e forthcoming. The Athapascans 
of Alaska and northwestern Canada, possessed of l)oth willow and 
spruce root, at once developed the coiled ware which theii- descend- 
ants, the Apache, are still making- in Arizona. 

East of the Rocky Mountains, in the Atlantic drainage of Canada 
and the United States, at the present time checker and willow work 
are practiced almost universally; but in the mounds of the Ohio Val- 
ley quite well diffused twined ware is found. The Gulf province 
afforded excellent cane {Ariindtnaria macroKpeniui^ Ariuul'iiuifid <jigan- 
tca^ Anmdinaria tecta), and here, both in ancient times and in modern, 
diagonal plaiting of basketry and matting was prevalent in all tril)es. 
The Plains province in its central portion relied chiefly on the hide of 
animals for its receptacles. But around its borders will l)e found 
intrusive processes of manufacture in twined, diagonal and coiled 
workmanship. 

On its Pacific slopes North America is the home of basketry. From 
Attn, the westernmost island of the Aleutian chain, to the borders of 
northern Mexico is to t)e found practically every type of this art. 

In Middle America, including southern Mexico and the Central 
American States, pottery was exalted among receptacles, and excellent 
fibers usurped the function of the coarser pliable materials of basketry. 

Owing- to diflerences of climate, rainfall, and other characteristics 
of environment, the materials for l)asketry vary greatly from region 
to region throughout America, and this in spite of all ethnic considera- 
tions. Again, the motives for the use of basketry differ from place to 
place, so much so that peoples of one blood make one ware in this 
place and another in that. Finally, however, it must never be for- 



«The author acknowledges that many statements made in this ethnic portion of 
the work are at second hand and has l)een fortunate in being able to consult men of 
expert information. The Hudson and the Merriam collection, in Washington City, 
the Benham, Tozier, Emmons, Teit, Long, Whitcoml), ^IcLeod, and others of the 
west coast have been placed cheerfully at his disi^osal. To IMr. C, C Willoughby, Dr. 
Boas, Mr. Pepper, Dr. Dixon, Dr. Kroeber, and others mentioned in these pages, he

j^otten that the ideiis, utilitarian and artistic, in the minds of the man- 
ufacturers themselves, serve to bestow special marks upon the work 
of different tribes so as to give to them ethnic or national signiticance 
under any circumstances. In the following chapters the typical forms 
of the various families of Indians will be iUustrated. 

Were there no mixture of tribes it might be possible to state in 
every case the maker of each specimen from the technic and the orna- 
mentation, though this opinion must be held with reserve. Through- 
out the entire continent the practice of capturing women was common; 
in each case the stolen ones carried to their homes the processes they 
had been familiar with in their native tribe. The Twana Indians on 
Puget Sound practice ten different methods of basket making; the 
Pomo Indians have eight processes; the Hopi Indians of Arizona have 
at least live. It is well known that each one of these tribes belong to 
synthetic families. In order to comprehend the extent of this rela- 
tionship between the tribe and the art, the various basket-making 
groups will be defined and the t3^pes of their work illustrated. (See 
Plates 154, 155.) 

The mixing of basket work through the traveling about of women 
is well illustrated in the story of Maria Narcissa, told by E. L. McLeod, 
of Bakersffeld, California. Maria was born at San Gabriel mission 
and brought up in Tejon Canyon. There she retained the knowledge 
of her native speech and learned the dialects of the surrounding tribes. 
She married an American, reared and educated a large family of chil- 
dren, and is still living. On her testimony tribes from the north as 
far up as Tule River would come down to Tejon for social and religious 
purposes, hold great feasts and dances, and gamble on the gaming 
plaques. Parties came longer journeys from San Fernando. San 
Gabriel, Ventura, Santa Barbara, and Santa Inez, and Mr. McLeod 
finds undoubted evidences of these meetings in the technic and the deco- 
rations on basketry. (See Plates 115-116.) 

From the Tule River country there came the beautiful flexible work, 
an improvement on the Fresno ware. But the Tejon basketry 
excelled, the pieces were better finished, there was more emulation, a 
greater variety of patterns, showing the influence of both north and 
south. 

There was trading of materials likewise, for you will see fine old 
pieces from the caves on the Tejon with mission bottoms and Tejon 
tops, also old specimens from caves in Santa Barbara County which 
were made in Tejon.

EASTERN NORTH AMERICA 

For thus the tale was told 

By a Penobscot woman 

As she sat weaving a basket, 

A basket or abaziioda 

Of that sweet-scented grass 

Which Indians dearly love. 

— Charles Godfrey Lelanp. 

Eiisterii North America will include the tribes east of the Rock}^ 
Mountains. Many of them are now basket makers, l)ut archeology is 
doing excellent service in helping- to complete a map of this area in 
order to determin(> the distril)ution of the various technical })rocesses 
that obtained in al)original times. The few^ types of the art that now 
survive must not l)e taken as covering the ground of ancient weaves. 
The recovery of the latter by the Bureau of American Ethnology, the 
Peabody Museum, and othei' explorations is one of the most wonder- 
ful contri))utions of the spade to the ethnologist. Though basketry 
wan anciently made of grass, hemp fil)er, ])ark, young stalks, and sap- 
wood, and for that reason is the luost perishable of human manufac- 
tures, under favorable conditions salt mines, nitrous caves, the desert's 
aridity, metallic earths, and even tire have kindly preserved enough 
of the delicate textures to reveal the processes of weaving in vogue 
many centuries ago. 

Indian women in the Mississippi Valley used to decorate the out- 
sides of (day vessels ])y pressing string and basketry products on the 
soft material before Inirning. Thus they preserved the record of 
the art for all time. By applying modeler's clay to these ancient 
fragments the texture is at once revealed. In Popular Science 
Monthly'^' will be seen account of experiments with these sybilline 
shards, by George E. Sellers. William II. Holmes simultaneously 
made larger investigations and published accounts of experiments by 
him on Mound Builders and other ancient pottery of this area.* He 
carefully washed the fragments of their ware and made casts of the 
outer surface. The result was astonishing. Natural forces had eaten 
away and greatly obscured the marks of textiles on the outside surface 
of the shards, but in the ])ottom of the cavities, tilled for centuries 
with earth, the impressions have been carefully preserved, and "the 
mann(>r in which the fabric in all its details of plaiting, netting, and 
weaving were constructed can be brought out quite as graphicall}' as

though ono wore exaniinino- the sui'facc of the original vessels/' On 
the surfaces of rocks the paleo-botanist discovers the delicate impres- 
sions of leaves. In these indelible lines he reads the names of species 
of trees that grew millenniums ago. So, through these impressions 
on potsherds the archeologist is able to discover lost arts of whose 
existence all other evidence has perished. (See Plate 107.) 

Ail along our northern frontier and in many parts of Canada the 
Ir()([uois and Chippewa now fabricate baskets from the ash, hircli, 
linden, and other white woods and the vernal or sweet grass (AV//v/.s-- 
tiind ()(l<>rat<(). The method of manufacture is universally the same; 
it is the plainest in-!ind-out checker and wicker weaving. (See Plates 
117 and 121). The basketry is far from monotonous, however, for the 
greatest variety is secured by ditl'erence of form, of color, of the 
relative size of the parts, and of ornamentation. In form the baskets 
run the whole gamut as among the Haida and Makah, guided by the 
maker's fancy and the demands of trade. These Indians all live on the 
border of civilization and derive a large revenue from the sale of their 
wares. The colors are of native manufacture — red, yellow, blue, 
green, alternating with the natural color of the wood. To ])eg'in with 
the rudest, let us take a dozen or sixteen strips of paper half an inch 
wide and cross them so as to have one-half perpendicular to the other 
half, woven in checker at the center and extendingf to form the equal 
arms of a cross. Bend up these arms perpendicular with the woven 
checker and pass a continuous splint similar to the framework round 
and round in a continuous coil from the l)ottom to the top. Fit a 
hoop of wood to the top, bend down the upright sjilints over this, and 
sew the whole together with a whipping of splint, and you will have 
the type l)asket. (See tig's. !♦ and lo on Plate 11^».) Now, by varying 
the width of the splint used to cover the sides a g-reat difference of 
appearance is secured. The complete operation among the Menomi- 
nees was studied out by W. J. llotiman," and will l)e seen in tigs. 
110 to 114. In the National Museum are baskets made of uniforiuly 
cut splints not over one-sixteenth of an inch in width. 

Finally, the Algonkin, as well as the Southerji Indians, have learned 
to decorate baskets with a great variet}^ of rolls, looking- much like 
the napkins on the table of a hotel. The weaver draws a splint under 
the warp stick, gives it a turn up and down, or two turns in ditferent 
directions, and draws the loose end tig-htly under the next warp stick 
but one. This operation is repeated, forming around the basket one 
or more rows of projecting- ornaments. Morgan bears testimony to 
the skill of the Iroquois women in the art.'' 

The basket woman at her work sits upon the ground in front of her 
lodge, or frequently of a little booth or shelter — the tirst step in the

evolution of the artist's studio. Tlie materials which she gathered 
long ago with nuich pains, and has been hoarding up, are within easy 
reach. Her hands and her teeth are both available in her work, aided 
by only a small supply of tools. A number of Indian women at work 
will be seen in ditt'erent connections throughout this paper. 

IMate 120 shows Caroline Masta, an Abenaki Indian woman from 
Pierreville, Canada, seated in her humble laboratory at Belmar, New 
Jersey. Her materials are of black ash {Fraxmus n i</r<() and sweet grass 
[Savd.stanti i)d(>v<it(i). The former has been worked out by machiner}" 
in Canada, and is piltnl up around her; the latter is gathered and 
braided by her relatives, and sent to her all ready for the last step 
in maimfacture. This Indian woman conducts a thriving business, 
not being able to make up ware as fast as there is demand for it. 
Specimens of her work are shown in Plate 119, photographed })v 
Herbert B. Rowland. 

To illustrate more fully the survival of the old art in the new era, 
Plate \'1\ represents three Chippewa women near Saginaw. Michigan, 
making splint baskets. They are seated no longer in the midst of 
wretchedness, but in an apple orchard. The clothesline and the recep- 
tacles tilled with fruit mark the changed life. It will l)e noticed, also, 
that the woman on the left is us^ing for her splints a gauge set with 
metal blades. Indeed, the broad strips lying on the ground were 
worked out by machinery. Checkerwork and wickerwork are the 
onl}' forms of technic practiced by these Chippewas. It will not be 
assumed l)y anyone that the improvement in environment has i-c 
dounded to the benetit of the savage art. The baskets are the com- 
mon frame ware, and often the best of them bear no comparison in 
retinement with the work of their most savage sisters on the west 
coast. Photographed by Harlan I. Smith. 

The acme of the northern Algonkin weaving is in twilled matting. 
The operation, technically, is just on the border between free-hand 
plaiting :ind loom work. Plate 122 is a mat plaited ))y a Chippewa 
squaw% about 50 years old, at Grand Marais, Minnesota. It is of cedar 
bast made in strips a quarter of an inch wide, and is in three colors — 
one the natural tinge of the material and the other two dyed. The 
interesting features are, first, that the weaving is done from below 
upward, as in the Haida basketry and in the work carried on by 
Virginia Indians in the days of John Smith. 

A small rod or stiff cord of bark is suspended by means of eight 
loops from a pole resting oii two forked sticks. This is to giVe free 
motion to the womaivs hands. Over this the warp strings are sus- 
pended freely. The Chilkat blanket weaver, also, as will be seen, has 
no other machiner3^ For a few rows the weaving is simple checker- 
work of the plainest kind, and then begins a series of twilled patterns 
over two and under two. But even this simplest technic so lends

itself to chiinning etfects of lig'ht and shade that there is not a monot- 
onous s([uare incli on the surface. Another band of plain wearino- is 
followed by zigzag and angular work, inelosing lines and s<[uares, 
giving birth to a very pleasing eti'eet. Some of the oldest ])ietures 
preserved in the early chronicles of the Algonkin Indians, to whom 
the Chippewa belong, show them weaving in exactly the same fashion. 

The mat described above was made for Capt, K. D. GaiUard, 
U. S. A., in a single day, tiie work beginning at 9 o'clock in the morn- 
ing and the finished product being delivered '2 miles away at 4 o'clock 
in the afternoon. It is (> feet 5 inches long and -i feet 5 inches wide. 

The Menomini Indians of the Algonquian family, li\'ing in northern 
Wisconsin, are quite expert in various forms of ))asket work and hand 
weaving. Mats are woven from the leaves of rushes, ilags or cat- 
tails, and cedar ])ark. They are for rooting' temporary structures, 
such as medicine lodges, for partitions, tloor mats and wrappings, and 
for various ])urposes in the canoes. The leaves and stems are strung

together by means of threads made of l)asswood fiber. In this they 
imitate a kind of textile well distributed throughout North Amei'ica 
formerly. 

The mats shown on Plates 21, 22, and 23 of Dr. Walter J. Hoff- 
mann's paper" on this tribe are made from the inner bark of the cedar, 
cut in strips averaging- one-half inch in width, in mixed, twilled, and 
checker weaving, which, cond^ined with the native coloi- of the material 
and dyed strips, produce the greatest \'ariety of diaper patterns. They 
do not differ essentially from Captain (Jaillard's mat just described. 

The baskets of the Menominees resemble those of the eastern Cana- 
dian Indians. A log of elm wood is beaten until the space l)etween 
the annual layers of growth is destroyed; the thin strips are then 
pulled off, cut to a luiiform width, and scraped as smooth as possible. 
At present gauges of steel are used for the purpose. The weaving is 
done in checker, twilled, and wicker work. A section of the beaten 
log, showing the annual layers loosened, the mallet of wood, and the 
modern knife, resembling the '^ man's knife" throughout all the north- 
ern tribes, are shown in tigs. 110 to 114. For the finer kinds of bag-

g'lng the inner bark of the 3'oung' sprouts of basswood is emploj'ed. 
It is removed in sheets and boiled in water with a quantity of lye. 
This softens the liber and prepares foi; the next process, which con- 
sists in pulling bunches of the boiled bark forward and backward 
throug-h a hole in the shoulder blade of the deer. The 
liber is twisted into yarn and made into cord or twine 
by winding- on the thigh with the palm of the hand. 
This advance in the preparation of the textile elements 
paves the way for twined weaving. 

Fig-. 1, Plate 123, is an example of hexagonal weaving 
in a Mackenzie River snowshoe in which 
the vertical elements answering to warps 
are crossed and not interlaced, and the 
fabric is bound together by the weaving 
in and out of a single rawhide thong. Fig. 
2, on the same plate, illustrates the next 
step in this weaving, and is suggestive of 
a feature in the twilled basketrv taken from 
graves in a cemetery at Ancon, Peru, 
namely, the method by which a bar of the 
snowshoe frame enters into the weaving and 
widens the meshes. Most beautiful eti'ects 
are produced on the surface of these snow- 
shoes by the diti'erent methods of adminis- 
tering the warp. This has l)een carefully 
worked out ))y John Murdoch in his paper upon the 
Eskimo of Point Barrow, Alaska," and is referred to 
here simply to show how the metliods of weaving in 
basketr}- are to be seen in other materials for other 
purposes. 

In fig. 8, same plate, the warps at certain points in 
the manipulation are twisted in pairs about each other, a 
technical process in vogue throughout middle America, 
beginning as far north as the Mohave country in south- 
ern Arizona. It might be called the first step in lace 
making. Fig. 4, same plate, introduces another element 
of complexity wherein the warp elements instead of being- 
twisted around each other are wrapped once or twice 
about the weft, so that th(> primitive lace work is efl'eeted 
both vertically and horizontally. 

Charles C. Willoughby, of the Peabody Museum, Cambridge, Massa- 
chusetts, is of the opinion that coiled basketry was used among the 
Ojibwa Indians (Chippewa) on the Great Lakes before contact with the

whites, jiiid mentions very old speeiniens now in the possession of tiuit 
nnisenni.and others have been seen in private eollections. The founda- 
tion coils are of sweet oruss and al)oiit one-quarter of an inch in diam- 
eter. In some very old specimens the sewing- is done with looped 
stitches, being- continuous from the edge toward the center of the basket 
and not following the coils, as is usual. He also finds the following 
references to old basket work of the New P^ngland Indians. (See Plate 
124.) (lookin is (juoted, writing in 1(>7-J:, with the following words: 

Several sorts of baskets, great and siaall, some of them hold 4 bushels or more, 
and so on downward to a pint. * * * Some of these baskets are made of rushes 
and some of l)ents (coarse grass), others of maize husks, others of a kind of silk 
grass, others of a kind of wild hemp, and some of bark of trees. JNIany of these are 
very neat and artificial, with the portraitures of birds, lieasts, fishes, and tlowers upon 
them in colors. 

The .soldiers under Captain Underbill, after destroying the Pequot 
fort in Connecticut in 1637, brought back with them ''several delight- 
ful baskets." Brereton (lf)(»il) found baskets of twigs ''not unlike our 
osier." Champlain saw corn stored in " great grass sacks." Josselyn

writes, "Baskets, bags, and mats, woven with bark of the lime tree 
and rushes of several kinds, dyed as before, some l)lacTv, blue, red, 
yellow." In 1()20 the Pilgrims found on a cache at Cape Cod "a 
great new basket, round and narrow at the top and containing 8 or 4 
busliels of shelled (^orn, with 30 goodly ears unshelled." The New 
England Indians were probably not less expert basket makers than 
other tribes to the west and south. Does not the fact that the three 
distinct forms of weaving — twined, checker, and coiled — still found 
among the Ojibwas seem to indicate a survival of these types from 
prehistoric times all over the great Algonkin area? A few years back 
this type of coiled work was more in vogue than at present. The 
next specimen described will take the reader a long way from the 
Great Lakes. (C. C. Willoughby.) 

Plate 125 shows the detail of a flat coiled basket of the Eskimo about 
Cumberland Inlet, eastern Canada. The foundation likewise contains 
a Inindle of straws, but badly put together and sewed with sinew 
thread, the stitches being wide apart and caught beneath a few straws 
of the preceding coil. The bottom is flat and the walls drawn in so as

to give a compressed shape. This interesting- specimen has been many 
years in the National Musemii and is credited to Capt. C. F. Hall, the 
Arctic explorer. It ma}- be compared with others of the same type 
from the southern Canadian border. Catalogue No. 10203; height, If 
inches. A much later specimen also from the Eskimo is shown in the 
next plate. 

Plate 126 is openwork coiled basketry of the Eskimo of Davis Inlet, 
eastern Canada. The foundation is of straw and the sewing is done 
in the same material, the stitches merely interlocking. The noteworthy 
characteristic of the basket is the slight amount of sewing in certain 
portions. The bottom is not unlike the work of the western Eskimo, 
and, indeed, is a typical illustration. There is a little splitting of 
stitches. })ut probably not designed. On the sides the openwork is 

produced by wrapping the foundation with 
the straw for one-half an inch and then 
sewing, as in ordinary coiled work, the 
angles to the coil ])elow. This may be 
compared in the wrapping with the open- 
work coiled basketry of the Kern County 
Indians in California. (See tig. 19C>.) 
Sewing of exactly the same style is to 
be found in northern Europe, and the 
suggestion is made that this particular 
method among the eastern Eskimo is an 
acculturation. To come nearer home, 
coiled l)asketi'v in ratia tiiat is taught in 
tlie schools is largely in this wrapped and 
sewed method. The Eskimo of this area 
were for centuries in contact with Norse 
settlers. This specimen is 8i inches 
in length, and was collected by L. M. 
Turner. 

Plate 127 gives the profile and inside view of a shallow coiled basket 
tray of the Comanche Indians, living on the plains east of the Rock}' 
Mountains, used principally in gambling. The foundation is of rods 
and splints, the sewing with leaf of yucca ( Yuera <irl-(()isana). Especial 
attention is invited to the furcate stitches, designedh' and symmetric- 
ally split. This technic relegates the basket to the Ute or Shoshonean 
area, west of the Rockies. The Comtuiches belong to the Shoshonean 
family. Its diameter is 1> inches. 

In the National Museum are four small, dish-shaped, coiled gambling 
baskets, Catalogue Nos. 63-1:2, 8127, and 153932, gathered from the Rees 
or Caddoan Indians, the other one from the Mandans, Avho are Siouan. 
These baskets are made from willow, on a two-rod foundation, but 
roughly assembled and sewed with sj)lints of the same material. The

mens are to lie found in this eollection. 

There are four other gam))lint'- baskets of the same typo, ])ut of 
ditierent material, and are fairly made. The foimdation is a singlo 
stem of, perhaps, willow, the sewing in the leuves of yucca ( V>ic<(/

gathered from the Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Kiowan Indians in Indian 
Territory. 

Finally, modern pedagogy has found in the long leaves of the Geor- 
gia pine a material by means of which poor people may weave a little 
of the sense of beauty into their lives. 

Plate 128 is a covered basket, made near Augusta, Georgia, from 
the leaves of the pine by a native Georgia woman, under the instruc- 
tion and patronage of Mrs. Percy H. Ralx-ock. of Hudson, Ohio. The 
sewing material is tough, brown linen thread. The interesting charac- 
teristic in this specimen is the undesigned resemblance l)etween the 
stitching and thiit on the Hudson Bay Eskimo specimen, as well as 
the old Chippewa specimen in the Peabody Museum, in Cand)ridge, 
Massachusetts. 

Coiled work, as was shown in the chapter on weaving, changes to 
lace work by omitting the hard foundation. In this Eastern Area two 
witnesses, far apart in time, are here to testify to the widespread 
ancientness of a coiled work now universal in tro})ical Anuu'ica. 

Figs, a and /», Plate 12t>, represent the method of weaving in the 
game bags, or nmskemoots, of the Dog Kib and othei' Athapascan 
Indians in northwestern Canada for domestic pui'pos<\s. Th(\se tri])es 
and their relatives in central Alaska use the ])irch-bark vessels for all 
sorts of domestic purposes. For transpoi-tatioii they do not make 
regular baskets, but buckskin wallets, in which a process of coihnl 
weaving now to be described is employed. The sides and bordei's of 
the game l)ags are of dressed skin of moose and reindeei-. For the 
l)ody of the bag the same material is cut into tine string and rolled. 
This material is called ■•' ba})iche.'' It is (piite evident that before the 
introduction of the steel knife this material was nuu-h coarser, as may 
!)(' known not only from the game bags, but also from the snowshoes. 
By examining tig. h a small section from one of the nmskemoots will 
show how the work is done. The border of the ])ag on its lower edge 
is pien-ed at e([ual distances for the rece})tion of the tirst row of weav- 
ing. Through these holes the babiche is stiauig by half hitches, or 
what is called "" ])uttonhole stitch.'' Th(> work proceeds in the same 
manner round and I'ound until it is desinible to make a variation in the 
technical process. In the middle of the drawing* it will be seen how 
this is done. The end of the l)a])iche is carried through a stitch in the 
row al)Ove and twisted one and a half times al)out itself. As many

of methods (page 24S), does not occur again among the Inditius until 
the borders of Mexico aj-e reached, wliere tlie tri))es in their carrying 
nets, and farther south in their wallets and hanunocks, employ precisely 
the same method of workmanship. This specimen, Catalogue No. 2023, 
with several others in the U. S. National Museum from the Dog Rib 
Indians of northwestern Canada, was collected by Bernard II. Ross. 

Warren K. Moorehead found examples of the muskemoot weaving 
in the Hopewell mounds, Ohio. There was nothing but an easy por- 
tage here and there to hinder passage by water from the mouth of the 
Mackenzie to the neighborhood of the Hopewell mounds. Examples 
in Peabody Museum, Massachusetts, and in the Field Columbian, 
Chicago, prove the identity of technic. (See ligs. 115 and 110.)

There is a general impression that th(^ baskets of the ordinarv soft 
character described were used by these eastern peoples in the manu- 
facture of pottery and were ruthlessW destro^'cd in the burning, 
but Holmes's investigations tend to show that pliable materials had 
been almost exclusively employed. In the Pueblo region the case was 
quite different, though there is no evidence of the burning of the 
basket. 

The twined wallets or other fabrics used were removed before the 
vessel was burned or even dried. In many cases handles and orna- 
ments were added after these impressions were made, also incised 
designs were executed in the soft clay after the removal of the textile. 

It is quite evident that textile impressions were used to enhance the 
beauty of the vessel, not to support the clay in process of construction. 

In man}" examples, notably the salt vessels of Saline River, Illinois, 
the fabric was applied after the vessel was finished, inasmuch as the 
loose threads sag or festoon toward the rim. Simple cord markings 
arranged to form patterns have been employed on many examples. 
And in those cases where basketrj^ textile was pressed on the surface

it was not the common, careless weaving, but the elegant desions, as 
will be seen in the plates. 

The textile markings on potter}^, ancient and modern, arc of live 
classes: 

1. Impressions on the surface, made l)y rigid basketry, used in 
molding and modeling. 

2. Impressions of pliable fal)rics on the soft clay. 

3. Impressions of woven textures used over the hand or on a 
modeling or malleating implement. 

4. Impressions of cords wrapped about modeling or malleating 
paddles or rocking tools. 

5. Impressions of bits of cords or other textile luiits, singly or in 
groups, applied for ornament only, and so arranged as to give textile- 
like patterns."

If the reader will turn to the classification of l»asket-making meth- 
ods (p. 10(1), it will l>e noticed that many of these are to bo found in 
the ancient basket ware impressed on pottery ])y the eastern Indians. 
Referring to Professor Holmes's paper, openwork checker weaving is 
very rare among impressions on chiy. Foster illustrates one example 
on pottery from a mound on Great Miami River, Hiitler County, Ohio. 
Checkerwork of the close tvpe, on the other hand, was practiced in 
nearly all the Atlantic States, upon the testimony of pottery fragments. 

From potsherds found in the State of New York, closely packed 
checkerwoi'k patterns have been copied. Charred fabrics from 
mounds in Ohio reveal tlie coarsest kinds of oV)Ii(jue checker weaving. 
Holmes illustrates an example in which the oblique work imitates 
mat plaiting without a frame, worked from a corner. The selvage 
and the weft cross the texture obliquely.'^

Not only checkerwork, ))ut twilled work in cane and in twine and 
wickerwork in soft material have been brought to light l\v cave explo- 
rations in the Western and Southern States. In the Third Annual 
Report of the Bureau of Ethnology Holmes figures an example of 
wickerwork in soft materials from a cave in Kentucky. (See figs. 117, 
118, and 119.)" 

To show the distribution of this ancient style of weaving, reference 
is here made to — 

1. Coarse oblique checker twilled work from Ohio, made of twine. 

2. In the same volume (fig. 12) is shown a fragment of twilled cane 
matting from Petite Anse Island, Louisiana. It has been preserved 
all these years by salt. (See fig. 126.)

H. Plate 2 in Holmes's report shows a mat of split cane from a rock 
shelter on Clifl' Creek, Morgan County, Tennessee. It is 6 feet 6 
inches by 3 feet 4 inches. The variety of twilled eft'ects and the 
patterned border leave nothing to be desired. 

4. In a mound near Augusta, Georgia, a fragment of twilled matting 
was found attached to the surface of a bit of copper, Holmes's fig. 11. 
The interesting feature of this example is that on the side shown the 
warp passes over one and under four, the weft, over four and under 
one. His fig. 15, from Alabama, is similar, only the fornuda is three 
and one. 

5. Fig. 14 is from an impression of twilled weaving on a fragment 
of pottery found in Polk County, Tennessee. Three characteristics of 
this fragment claim attention. The warp is of fine twine, the weft of

coarse yarn; the work i.s over two, l)oth in war[) and weft; the weav- 
ing is oblique. The ett'ect of this technie is ))leasing and unique, the 
components being l)ands of ck)se work alternating witii bands of open- 
work, made up of sloping elements giving great variety to unity. 

It will be seen that the checker and the twilled work in ancient 
eastern North America had al)out the same distribution as now. 

Twined weavin"- was connuon throughout the Middle and Eastern 
States of the Union in prehistoric times. Fabrics of this class were 
employed by the ancient i)otters in nearly all of the States. Every 
variety of twined weaving known to the modern Indian was practiced

by the old-time people — the mound-))uilders especially. Holmes 
figures examples from potter}' in Tennessee, Georgia, Arkansas, Illi- 
nois, Missouri, and Iowa. Even the intricate and delicate forms of 
twined weaving described on page 234 as zig-zag or divided warp and 
crossed warp were well known. 

The ancient pottery of the Mississippi Valley furnishes many ex- 
amples of this, as will l)c seen in Holmes's papers."

sissippi Valle}^, where imprints of the interlaced canes occur in the 
baked clay plaster with which the dwellings were finished. In the 
same connection eTohn Smith, Butel-Dumont, Du Pratz, Latitaa, and 
John Lawson arc quoted on the use of wattling for houses, inclosure, 
biers, and burial platforms. A fish trap with long wings done in 
twined wattling is figured in Hariot and here reproduced from Holmes. 
(See tig. 120.) 

The illustration shows a warp of stakes driven into the bottom of 
the stream close enough together to let the small fry pass through 
and to offer no impediment to the liow of water. Brush or poles con- 
stitute the warp. The rivers of the Atlantic coast teemed with shad, 
herring, rocklish, sturgeon, and more, in the spring, and it is per- 
mitted to infer that twined fish traps were universal there. 

Plate 130, thanks to the preserving care of potsherds, introduces the 
reader to the old basket makers of no one knows how many centuries 
ago. From three fragments, selected out of myriads and shown in 
the plate on the right hand, the casts on the left being in plaster, one 
might think himself studying specimens from the Aleutian Islands or 
the Great Interior Basin. The figure at the bottom is in plain open- 
work of twined weaving, the material being a soft bast, perhaps of 
native hemp. Hundreds of wallets indistinguishable in texture from 
this are now brought from around Bristol Bay, Alaska. The figure 
in the middle is openwork twined weaving in diagonal pattern. The 
warp strands are in pairs and flexible, making the interstices triangu- 
lar and giving to the weaving the appearance of '"'fagoting." If 
the weft were forced close together, the texture would be the common 
twilled work of the Pacific slope. The upper figures are also twined, 
but of rarer st3de, the warp being set diagonally. This figure is 
worthy of note in two respects. The workmanship in twisting of the 
threads is superb. One would have to look a long time through a col- 
lection of twined weaving of the present da}- to see threads near so 
fine. Not until the outermost island of the Aleutian chain was reached 
would the specimen appear. The other characteristic is the sloping 
warp, a thing of rare occurrence in twined weaving. 

A further glance at basketry technic preserved in impressions on 
pottery and in caves shows plain twined weave, open or closed, with 
vertical or oblique warp; twilled weaving in twined weft and twined 
weaving with zigzag warp; three-ply twined weaving, and a style of 
twined work, which for exhausting possibilities of variety in warp 
treatment will vie with any modern example. The material is good 
twine, the warp is administered in groups of sixes, oblique toward the 
right. The weft is a two-ply twine which in crossing the warp takes 
in a strand at each half turn and is twisted tightly in the open spaces. 
The pattern is varied by bands of close weft in three rows, above and 
below which the groups of six warp strands are split into threes.

TWINED WEAVE FROM ANCIENT POTTERY. 

Tennessee. 
After W. H. Holmes. 



Attention is called to Plate cS in the Thirteenth Ijureau Report, where 
is shown ancient twined work preserved ])y being- wrapped about 
copper celts." (See iio-s. 1lU-1l>-J; also Plate lo7.) 

Plate L31 represents an open twined wallet of the Ojibwa Indians 
(Alo-on(itiian stock), at Angwassag Village, near St. Charles, Saginaw 
County, Michigan. 
The native name is 
Na iNIoot and it is 
made from the inner 
bark of the slippery 
elm ( Ulnius (u n eri- 
ca n a). Othe r bags of 
the same technique 
in the U. S. National 
Museum are from the 
elm bark associated 
with red and black 
yarn. The tech n ic of 
these wallets is so in- 
teresting in the sur- 
vival of ancient weaves that they justify a special description. The 
weft i.s plain twined weaving; all the ornamentation, therefore, is effected 
by means of the warp, which is partly vertical, but more of the zigzag 
type seen in many Aleutian Island wallets. In all of the specimens 
examined the warp is made up of twine, partly in the material of the 

weft and partly in colored yarns. 
The diametci' of the warp twine, 
especially' the yarns, seems to be 
greater than the length of the 
twists in the weft, so that there is 
a crowding which l)rings one color 
to the front and leaves another 
color inside— that is, the figures 
that are l)rown on the outside will 
appear in yarn on the inside and 
the reverse. To be more explicit, 
beginning at the lower edge of any 
one of these wallets the Avarp may 
l)e in pairs, the elements of which 
.separate and come together alternately in the rows of weaving. On 
the outside of the bag two elm-bark warp strands will be included 
and appear; in the next half twine two yarns will be included and 
show on the inside of the wallet. After this zigzag process goes on

for a short distance the weaver changes her plan, omits the bark or 
the \'arn warp altogether, but continues the twining process, catching 
the warp in every other half turn of the twine. Again, there will 
1)0 a row oi" two of ordinary twined weaving with straight warp, wdien 
she returns to her zig'zag method, covering the entire surface there- 
with. At the top of the bag an inch or less of plain twined weaving 
in which the warps are vertical and included in pairs brings her to the 
outer border, where all the warps are twisted together and turned back 
to be fastened off in the texture. In an old example in the National 
Museum long, cut fringes are sewed to the upper margin and to the 
sides of the bag. 

The photographs of the twined bag shown in Plate 131 were taken 
by William Orchard, of the American Museum of Natural History, and 
presented to the National Museum by Harlan I. Smith. On one side 
a mguntain lion and the other an eagle with geometric figures are 
shown in l)lack. The te(;hnic of this particular example -from left 
to right Avould ])c live vertical rows of plain twined weaving; nine 
rows of mixed warp, but plain weaving; a course of braided 
warp in which the four elements of two rows of warp are braided 
together and included in the twine. On the other side is a similar 
administration. The middle portion shows zigzag twined w'eaving, 
figured. Above this is a row of three-ply twined weaving, as 
among many of the Western tribes; above this three rows of plain 
twined weaving in openwork including all the warps. At the top the 
warps are twisted and fastened into the texture. It must be clearly 
understood that the figures which show black on the outside — that is, 
the eagle and the lion — will be white on the inside, necessarily. The 
colors used in the small specimen of the National Museum are the nat- 
ural color of the bark mixed with brown, black, and blue yarns. The 
National Museum is indebted to Andrew^ John, a Seneca Indian of 
New York, for a number of specimens of modern Iroquoian twined 
ware from corn husks. 

There was a decided lack of coiled ))asketry in all this vast region. 
Every kind of hand-woven ware was known. Algonquian, Iroquoian, 
Siouan, and Muskhogean tribes of the present, and all the cave-dwell- 
ing, mound-building, ancients, seem, so far as the evidence points, to 
have known little of coiling. 

From this hasty survey of ancient hand weaving in ])asketry and 
the other receptacles, as well as in matting, webbing, sandals, and 
such products of the textile art as resemble basketry, it is now allow^ed 
to examine their modern representatives in the southern portions of 
the same area. 

In the States of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida,

Often in weaving two thin 
strips are laid together, the soft 
sides inward. The evident mo- 
tive in doubling- th(> tlun strips 
is to have l)otli sides of the bas- 
ket or mat glossy and smooth. 
Further on it will be noted that 
in twined weaving, where the 
strands of the weft are from 
split roots, both sides are ren- 
dered smooth l)y revolving each 
strand half a turn as it passes 
through between the warp

bent clown and inclosed in a wrapping of the .same material. Under- 
neath this is a row of twined weaving, which holds in place those 
warp elements that do not enter into the texture. A nmch neater 
example of worlc of this kind is shown in the next tigure, m here tlie 
lilaments are more carefully prepared and manipulated and the border 
more neatly finished, but the technical j)rocess is the same. The artistic 
efi'ect of plain twilled work is shown in this example. 

Fig. 12-1: exhibits the process of crossing in what might ])e called 
diaper or figured work. The effect is heightened by dyeing ])lack one 
set of the filaments, eithei' Avarp or weft. In that case the figures 
stand out most prominently. The entire efi'ect of this sort of weav- 
ing, however, is in the endless combination of rectangles, ])lack and 
white, all having the same width and difierent lengths. 

The basket shown in this dissected weaving is Choctaw, Catalogue 
No. 24143, in the U. S. National Museum, collected by Father 
Ro(iuet, of New Orleans. 

Plates 132-133 represent the twilled basketrj^ of the Chetimacha 
Indians, Chetimachan family, who have their home on Grande River 
and the larger part in Charenton, St. Mark's Parish. The name is 
derived from the Choctaw words tchuti^ ''cooking vessels," inasha^ 
"they possess." Mr. Gatschet in 1881 found about fifty individuals 
still living. The material of their work is the cane {Anindlnaria 
tecta) and all of their weaving is in the twilled style of technic. 

Compared with the work of the Choctaws (Plate 134) and their 
neighbors, the Attakapa (Plate 135), it is more picturesque and attrac- 
tive, the colors being the original of the cane, red and 3'ellow. Similar 
work is to be seen in the northern part of South America, especialh' 
in Guiana. The interesting feature of the Attakapa wea\'ing is that 
frequently the specimens have the appearance of being doidile — that 
is, both the outside and the inside of the receptacle presenting the 
small surface of the cane. At once the work connects itself with mat- 
ting found in the caves of Kentucky and Tennessee. 

Plate 133 represents a fine collection of old Chetimachas in the col- 
lection of ]\Irs. Sidney Bradford, of Avery Parish, Louisiana. They 
should be examined carefully, since they were posed so as to exhibit 
the technic of the various parts. 

Plate 135 shows a small number of twilled basketry made by the 
Attakapa Indians living in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. They are the 
last remnant of an independent linguistic famih" once spread south- 
ward along the Texan coast. The l)askets are made from the stems of 
the cane. The outer tough la}^^- is split ofi' and dyed if necessary. It 
is then worked into twilled ware, which hy the texture and variety of 
colors shows elegant designs.

their outer, some their inner

The weaving was done by an 
Arikara woman in Dakota. 
Now, these Indians ar*^ not Sioux, but belong to the Caddoan family

produces a most charming effect which is not lost, after many thousands 
of years, in the cast taken from the surface of the fragment. (See p. 225. ) 
An example of matting, also illustrated b}^ Holmes, was taken from a 
piece of pottery found in Alabama. It is worked in the diagonal st3de, 
but on one side the warp passes over one and under three, and, conse- 
quently, though the matting was destroyed hundreds of years ago it 
is certain that on the other side of the faliric the weft made a similar 
figure, but vertical. (See p. 225.)

1866. Petit Anse Island is the locality of the remarkable mine of 
rock salt, exploited during the civil w'ar, and from which, for a con- 
siderable time, the Southern States derived a great part of their supply 
of this article. The salt is almost chemically pure and apparently 
inexhaustible in quantit}^, occurring in every part of the island, which 
is about .5,000 acres in extent, at a depth below the surface of the soil 
of l.j or 20 feet. The fragment of matting here photographed was 
found near the surface of the salt. No vast antiquit}" can l)e argued 
on this account, but the specimen is without doubt very old and a relic 
of the weavers who lived a long time before the discovery of America.

ATHAPASCAN COILED BASKETRY 



Perhaps no other family of American tribes has such a variety of 
contacts with neighbors of different linguistic families and of limita- 
tions in environments having little likeness to one another. This 
northern branch of them, as Mill be seen in Father Morice's list," is in 
touch along their southern border with Algonquian descendants of 
Mound Builders on the Ohio, with birch-bark workers in northern 
middle Canada, and with Pacilic coast tribes here and there. Some of 
these were noted in speaking of Region 1, i>age 379, with illustrations. 
Further on other contacts will be shown. The distril)ution of the 
family is given by Powell on his linguistic map of North America.^ 

Here the Athapascans are in touch with Eskimo; indeed, most of 

the specimens of their ware

a very coarse coiled basket now 
becoming common. Some of 
the very old pieces have the 
l)uttonhole stitch in the sewing. 
In a collection of pieces no two will agree either in shape or composition. 
The best of the ware is from near the Mackenzie mouth, where 
dyed feathers are used for decoration. Some of the oldest specimens 
in the National Museum entered in the first catalogue are coiled basket 
trays of the Athapascan Indian tribes living in Fort Simpson at the 
mouth of the Mackenzie River. Splints of willow and spruce root 
are employed in the work and the ornamentation is meager, consisting 
of stripes on the side, and borders in ([uilled work dyed in different 
colors. These specimens vary from (> to 8 inches in diameter, and 
were gathered ])y R. MacFarlane, B. R. Ross and W. L. Hardesty. 

Fig. 127 is a coiled basket jar of the Tinne Indians near Point 
Barrow% Alaska. The specimen l)elongs to the single-rod type, in 
which one rod or stem constitutes the foundation. The sewing is done 
with split stems of willow, passing over the rod in progress and under 
the one forming the coil underneath. The illustration here given of 
this specimen is from Murdoch's paper on the Point Barrow Eskimo.''

ing over a single rod, from Sidaru, northern 
Alaska, near Point Barrow, collected by Lieut. 
P. H. Ray, U. S. Army. It is similar in tech- 
nic with No. 89801. Its height is 4^ inches, 
and it has been described by Murdoch. (See

coiled l)asketry, from Point Barrow, Alaska, also collected })y Lieu- 
tenant Ray. The material is willow and the technic is coiled work of 

the single-rod t^^pe. The neck of the bas- 
ket is of black tanned sealskin and is tied 
with a string of the same material. Height,

Take an example from another part of 
Alaska. Fig. 130 is a coiled basket of the 
Tinne Indians who are settled on the Lower 
Yukon River. The foundation is a single 
rod of spruce root and the sewing is done 
wdth splints of the same material. It be- 
longs to the type of coiled work called a 
single rod (see p. 250); the stitches inter- 
lock with those underneath and inclose also 
the rod of that coil. Each stitch, there- 
fore, really incloses two foundations. In 
the explorations of Dall, Nelson, and Turner, in this long stretch of 
river bottom were collected man}^ specimens showing transition be- 
tween Indian and Eskimo activities. 

On the bottom the basket maker has taken the greatest pains to split 
the stitches of each coil with those of the coil beyond, giving to each 
one, looked at from the center, a bifurcated appearance which is quite

basket work splits the stitches of her coil and sews through them. 

This process is kept up on the ])ody of this specimen half the wa}^ up. 

Above that it ceases, as shown 
in the square inch enlarged fig.

are not of the same size, so that 
there is l)v no means the uniform 
regularity, cither horizontally or 
vertically, that one observes in 
the California area. It will be 
noticed, too, that the top of each 
stitch is narrowed by reason 
of the crowding. Over the en-

it is quite impossible to see the 
foundation rod because of this 
crowding of stitches.

ESKIMO BASKETRY 



Baskets not only have an infinite variety of uses from village to 
village, but among each people the}^ have a nuiltitude of uses. From 
the shore of Norton Sound to the Kuskokwim the women are expert 
in weaving grass mats, baskets, and bags. Grass mats are used on 
the sleeping benches and for wrapping around ])edding. They are 
used also as sails for umiaks. The}^ now frequently serve as curtains 
to partition off the corners of a room or sleeping platform. Small 
mats are placed also in the manholes of kaiaks as cushions. The bags 
are used for storing fish, lierries, and other food supplies, or for cloth- 
ing'. Smaller bags and ])askets are made for containing small articles 
used in the house.'' 

Two types of basket work are found in close proximity among the 
Eskimo in the neighl)orhood of Norton Sound and Bristol Bay, north 
and south, the twined and the coiled. In the former (fig. 133) the

treatment is precise!}" the same as in those of Aleutian Islands to l)e 
described, l)ut the Eskimo wallet is of coarser material and the weav- 
ing- is far more rudely done. Quite as interesting as the wallets is the 
matting. (See Plate 136.) 

At Chuwuk, on the Lower Yukon, Nelson saw a woman making one 
of thes(^ mats and watched the process she employed. A set of three 
or four straws was twisted and the ends turned in, forming a strand, 
a number of which were arranged side by side with their ends fastened 
along a stick, the primeyal loom, forming one end of the mat and 
hanging down for the w^arp. Other strands were then used as woof. 
By a deft twist of the lingers it was carried from one side to the other, 
passing aboye and below the strands of the warp; then the woof strand 
was passed ai'ound the outer strand of the warp and twined to repeat 
the operation. The strands were made continuous ])y adding straw\s 
as necessary, and with each motion the strands were twisted a little so 
as to keep them lirmly together. By this simple method a variet}^ of 
patterns are produced. 

Grass bags are started from the bottom where the strands of the 
warp, consisting of two or more grass stems, are fastened together 
and extend vertically downward. The woof is formed by a double 
strand of grass, each of which is twisted about itself and both twined 
with the strands of the warp inclosed in the turns; both are continually 
twisted as the weaving progresses. In coarsely made bags the strands 
of the woof are spaced from an inch to two inches apart, and those of 
the warp at intervals of from a quarter to half an inch. These bags 
have a conical bottom, which slopes from, the center to the sides. At 
the mouth the ends of the w^arp are braided to form a continuous 
edge." 

The lower figures in Nelson's group of Alaskan basketry (Plate 136) 
show plainly the matting, the closely woven twined wallet, and the 
openwork. Plates 137 to 145 in this paper are all excellent illustra- 
tions of the ware here described. The specimens are in the U. S. 
National Museum. 

Plate 137 will show better the detail, bod}' and bottom, of one of 
the twined wallets of the Norton Sound Eskimo. The warp and the 
twining of the bottom are of a very coarse, rush-like grass. The 
bottom is in openwork and oval. In this example the warp is radi- 
ating from a median line; in others the strands are laid parallel, so 
that they form a rectangle. At the boundary line between the bottom 
and the body of the wallet there is a row of three-strand weaving, the 
rows running in opposite directions, as will be seen in the drawing. 
The body is of rush color: the spotted lines on the cylindrical portion 
are in black, produced by the insertion of rags and bits of hide. This

effect may be varied by mixing- two strands of different color in the 
twine. The fastening off' at the top is done by working the warp 
strands into a three-strand braid, turning down on the inside of the 
vessel, and cutting off' an end whenever a new warp thread is taken up 
by the l)raid. Frequently the last three or four warp straws are not 
cut off', but ])raided out to their extremities in order to form a handle 
for the basket. 

In order to show how the warp and weft are administered in this 
far north region, a square inch of a wallet is represented much 
enlarged, ffg. 13?>. The openwork producing parallel ffgures is 
effected by leaving spaces between the different lines of twining. 
The four rows at the top of the drawing are plain, solid, twined weav- 
ing; the fifth row from the top is twined in an opposite direction, giv- 
ing the effect of a three-strand braid between the two rows; the third 
row from the top represents imper- 
fectly the effect produced by the 
three-strand work. It is interesting 
to find this method of basket weav- 
ing so far north. 

The student will notice farther on 
that very much of the elegant use 
of the warp in ornamentation, so 
common with the Aleuts, who 
speak a kindred language and live 
near b}^, is lost. It will be seen, 
however, that with their rude ma- 
terials and tools the Eskimo have 
still acquired the art of making a 
great variety of basketry, showing 
that they have had a multitude of 
teachers. This specimen, Catalogue No. 38ST2 in the IT. S. National 
Museum, was collected, with many others, at Norton Sound, l)y E. W. 
Nelson. 

To furnish a means of comparison ))etween the two sides of Bering 
Sea, Plate 138 is a twined Avallet of the Chukchi people of Kamchatka. 
The foundation is of straw laid parallel, and the weft is of plain twined 
weaving, the rows one-half an inch apart. The l)order is finished off' 
by gathering the ends of the warp into a braid. The decoration on 
this l)asket is effected first by coloring warp strands black and group- 
ing them systematically, and also l)y three narrow l)ands of black 
twined weaving near the top. Its height is 12 inches. This specimen, 
now in the American Museum of Natural History, New York, was col- 
lected by the flessup Expedition. 

To pursue the comparison farther into Asiatic territory, Plate 131) 
is a wallet in twined weaving from Kamchatka, introduced here for

comparison with the Chukchi type just shown. The warp is of coarse 
hemp cord; weft or tilling is of grass stems in natural color d3'ed 
black. The bottom is ornamented with bands in two colors; in each 
band there are alternate rows of })lack and white stitches arranged 
perpendicularly; in the next band they are oblique, and in the next 
perpendicular, forming a interminable mass of changing patterns, 
having a very pleasing effect. The body is covered with alternations 
of plain and variegated bands in which the white and black are admin- 
istered in triangles, rectangles, chevrons, and zigzag patterns. The 
work on this wallet is tinelv done. The effect of the ornamentation is

very attractive— on the top the ends of the warp are bent down and 
held in place by loops of sinow thread. The work nearest like this 
will be found quite common on the eastern side of Bering Sea and on 
the Pacific coast of America. The writer is indebted to Dr. Franz 
Boas for drawing attention to these similarities. 

Its height is 13 inches. This specimen, now in the American

carelessly, passing the thread sometimes through the stitches just 
below and sometimes l)etween them, and does not work her stitches 
home (tig. 51). It can not be said that she has no skill with the 
needle, for her embroideries in fur, intestines, and ({uill are excellent.

Most of the baskets in the Eskimo collection in the National Museum 
were gathered by E. W. Nelson and have a round bit of leather in the 
bottom to start upon (tig. 1:^5). The shape is either that of the 
uncovered bandbox or of the ginger jar.'' Especial attention should 
be paid to this form of stitching, as it occurs again in widely distant 
regions in a great variety of material and with moditications produc- 
ing striking etfects. (See tigs. 18-1, 135.)

deer hair taken from between the hoofs are modernly used in orna- 
mentation, just as the California women catch the stems of feathers 
under their stitches as they sew. 

Figs. 185 and 136 will illustrate this rude type of coiled basket of 
the Plskimo about Norton Sound. It is quite certain that the art of 
basket making is not an old one with these people. They have not 
learned how to begin the work from the center of the foundation, and 
always leave a circular space, either vacant or to be tilled with some 
other substance. In the example here shown a piece of hide 4 inches 
in diameter and irregular in outline constitutes the starting point. 
Holes are punched around the edge of this, as shown in the detail 
drawing (tig. 135), and the foundation of grass stems and leaves is 
sewed immediately to this with strips of the same material, not with 
any regularity or neatness. The basket has a cover, which is also 
interesting in its leather hinges, fastening, and handle. It must be 
admitted, however, under the stimulus and demands of trade, that the 

art is improving. Specimens are at this 
date brought home that are vastly better 
made than any of the old pieces in the 
National Museum; charming cloud effects 
are produced in sewing by using straws of 
different tints.

basket from the Kowak River region, north 
of Boring Strait, Alaska, collected by Lieut. George M. Stoney, U. S. 
Navy. The foundation of the coil is a small numl)er of slender grass 
stems. The sewing is in material of the same kind. The special char- 
acteristic of this specimen is that, in the sewing, the grass filament is 
wrapped once around the foundation and on the next turn is locked in 
the stitch underneath. This is an economical method of working, but 
it weakens the basket. The work on this specimen is slovenly done. 
It has a small piece of leather in the center of the foundation. Height, 
If inches. This example is a waif. It comes from the Arctic Ocean 
area, and most of the pieces in the Museum from near by are Tinne 
and gotten by the Eskimo in trade. More curious still is the extra 
wrap about the foundation every time a stitch is taken. The rafia* 
coiled baskets made in some of the schools are similar.

unique. A grass foundation is held together by half hitches or button- 
hole stitches in the same close together. There arc IG rows. The 
stitches pass over the foundation, lock with the stitches underneath, 
and in returning make a turn a])out the standing part. The technic 
is not half hitch, but, if the foundation were pulled out, would resemble 
the twisted coils in the Mackenzie River game bags, nmskemoots

gives an uneven line on the outside. The sewing is done with strips 
of willow rods without l)ark. The stitches pass over l)oth stri])s of 
the foundation and are caught between the two strips of the foundation 
coil imderneath. This is the onlj^ specimen of its kind in the Museum 
from Alaska. The use of a l)road foundation gives a tiat ap])earancc 
to the surface, something like that of the Mescalero baskcti'y in

stitches, in passing outward, split the underlying stitch of the previous 
coil. On the surface these stitches pass from top to bottom in regular 
vertical lines, resembling feather stitch. The upper margin is orna- 
mented with a row of birds' feet. Its height is '2i inches, and the 
specimen was collected l)y I. Applegate. 

Catalogue No. 127183, U. S. National Museum, is a coiled l»asket jar 
of the P]skimo on Togiak River. A rude ornamentation is attempted 
on the surface near the top by overla3'ing the foundation with a l)and 
of brown material underneath the stitches. Much will be said about 
this device of overlaying among Indian tribes farther south.

Its height is '2 inches, and it was collected by Mr. Applegate. 

The upper fig-ure in Plate 140 is a covered basket in coiled work of 
the Chukchi people of Kamchatka. Foundation, a piece of sealskin; 
bottom, coarse coiled work in straw held together b}" sewing in sinew 
thread, the stitches being one-half inch apart. The bod^- is l)uilt up 
of coiled sewing, similar to that of the Eskimo of Alaska. Decora- 
tion, bands of chevron pattern in black. Hinge and fastening of seal- 
skin. Top decorated with six-pointed star. Diameter, 7 inches. 

This specimen, now in the American Museum of Natural Histor}^, 
New York, was collected bv the Jessup expedition. The students of 
culture will be interested in the results of this exploration, which 
settle the question of unity of industries in the two continents. 

Fig. 2 in Plate 140 is an oblong coiled ])asket of the Chukchi people 
of Kamchatka. In the foundation, as in the Eskimo baskets, an oblong 
piece of sealskin is inserted. The people of this north region do not 
seem to know how to make the coil beginning which prevails among 
the Indian tribes. 

Around this sealskin the bottom consists of a continuous coil of 
grass stems held together l)y a wide, open coiled sewing in sinew 
thread. The body is built up on a grass foundation with sewing in 
the same material, resembling precisely the work done by the Eskimo 
of Port Clarence. Three rows of coiled work at the top are like that 
at the bottom, and over all is a band of sealskin rawhide with holes 
here and there for carrying. Its height is i> inches. This specimen, 
now in the American Museum of Natural History, New York, was 
collected by the Jessup expedition. 

The bottom figure on Plate 140 is a braided and coiled wallet of the 
Koryak people of Kamchatka. The foundation is a strip of sealskin. 
The body is ])uilt up in a continuous coil of six-strand braid, as in 
making hats. The decoration consists of alternating plain with col- 
ored rows of braid. Loops of sealskin on the top serve for fastening 
and carrying. This is a rare type of basketrj^ in America. Its height 
is 18 inches. 

There is a small specimen in the U. S. National Museum, obtained 
by Captain John liodgers, U. S. Navy, in 1852-5, made in the same 
way. As his expedition was on the Arctic coast of Asia, this piece 
also may have come home from that quarter. 

Plate 141 is a cohered coiled basket in the collection of F. Harvey. 
It is from the Lower Y'ukon River country and represents one of the 
best t3^pes of Eskimo work. Especial attention is called to the even- 
ness of the stitches, which interlock and at intervals gather in a few 
of the straws of the foundation. The mottled surface of the basket 
should also be noted in connection with the delightful effects produced 
by simply managing the natural colors of the straw with which the 
sewing is done. Attention has been directed to the glorification of

ALEUTIAN BASKETRY 

In 1ST4. William H. Dall contributed to the LI. S. National Museum 
a num])er of specimens of twined Ijasketry, from Attn and other 
islands far out in the Aleutian chain. (Catalogue Nos. 10-tT«)-l'.>4:S()). 
There for the first time this ext{uisite weaving' was .brougiit to light. 
Warp and weft are straws of l)each grass" and the workmanship will 
compare favorably with that of any other l)asket makers in the world. 
In the conical wallets, which resemble in outline those of the Eskimo 
and southeastern Alaskan tribes, the warp straws radiate from the 
center of the bottoiu. On the body the twined weft, always the same 
plain two-strand work, is applied to the warp so as to give rise to sev- 
eral technical varieties, which may be classified as follows: 

1. Plain twined weaving, the weft driven home (Plate 14::^). 

2. Open twined work, there l)eing open spaces ])etween the rows 
of weaving, but the warp strands ai'e parallel. 

3. Crossed warp, in which there are two sets of warp elements, one 
half inclining to the right, the other half toward the left. The twined 
wea\"ing binds the decussations, making hexagonal meshes. This tv'pe 
has an interesting distril)ution on lx)th sides of the Pacific. 

•I. Divided warp. A pretty efJ'ect is produced l)y these Aleut Ijasket 
makers, who split the warp, or divide it, if it consists of straws in pairs, 
and twining the weft straws around two halves of the same straw and 
next around two half straws not of the same ])ut of adjoining stalks. 
If the warp be of straws })v twos, the left side member of one pair is 
entwined with the right-hand member of the adjoining pair. On the 
next round there is an alternation, the stra^\s that belong together 
being entwined. The residt of this is a series of lozenge-shaped open- 
ings or meshes (figs. 16, 17). The gentu-al appearance of the surface 
resembles a form of needlework called hemstitching. The Aleuts in 
dou!)ling the warp do not place one element behind another as do the 
Tlinkits, but alongsid(\ This enables the weaver to convert her tech- 
nic into some other type in the successive rounds. She may have plain 
twining, crossed warp, zigzag warp, or hemstitch at any moment. 

5. Diverted warp. By this is meant a form of weaving in which 
certain warp straws are deflected from the perpendicular for a few 
courses and then brought back or changed to the upright position 
again. The result of this is a most pleasing efi'ect (Plate 113) and of 
the greatest variety on the surface. Attention has been previously

invited to the similarit}" of mound builder's work in the MississijDpi 
Valle^r to ttie plajing- witli the warp of which the Aleuts were so fond. 
Away down among the mummies of Peru are found relics of weav- 
ing of precisely the same sort. 

Ornamentation is produced b}' what looks like darning- or whipping 
one or more rows of colored grass after the body is formed. It is in 
effect the false embroider}^ of the Tlinkits farther south. The worsted 
patterns are woven into the texture and do not show at all on the 
inside. (See fig. 10.) Another plan of attaching the ornamentation 
is very ingenious, but not uncommon. Two strands of colored straw 
are twined, and at every half turn one of the strands is hooked under 
a twist on the body of the basket by a kind of "aresene" work or 
false embroidery with twine. This ornament has a bold relief effect 
on the outside and is not seen at all on the inside. 

The making of the beautiful twined ware is not new in these small 
islands. Lisiansky" afiirms that the Aleuts made baskets called 
" ishcats," in which they keep all their valuables. 

To begin with the eastern tribes, Catalogue No. 21i)2, in the 
U. S. National Museum, is a twined wallet of the Aleuts (Eskimaun 
famih^) on Kadiak Island, Alaska, Native name, Enakhtak. It is 
made entirely of Topkhnaluk or wild rye {Ely mas). The lower stalks 
are chosen because they become yellow through want of light. The 
wallets are woven from the standing grass, generall}^ in July and 
August, by the women, while engaged in curing salmon. In order to 
secure uniformit}^ in texture the broader leaves are split. An ordinary 
knife is used to cut the grass, but no other apparatus than nimble 
fingers has to do with the manufacture. The twining is called agan- 
khak. The Kadiak baskets are used chiefly in gathering berries and 
also in straining a kind of wine made from them. This specimen was 
collected l)y Lieut. G. T. Emmons, U. S. Nav}'. 

These wallet baskets are woven without ornamentation, or may ))c a 
line or so near the mouth, often effected by introducing one or more 
rows of black rags, the warp strands forming a heavy plaited rope-like 
border, which permits carriage by means of cords through the open- 
ings. In the Kadiak wallets the Tlinkit border is also imitated where 
the warp ends are bent down and held by twined weaving. 

Catalogue No. 14978 in the U. 8. National Museum is a typical old 
A.leut wallet. The cj'lindrical part is covered with meshes in diamond 
pattern, shown in fig. 9, Plate 136. The ornamentation on the surface 
is produced l)y false embroidery with strands of red, blue, and black 
worsted. The continuous line between the open stripes is formed by 
false whipping with a single thread of worsted on the outer stitches of 
one of the twines of straw. The border is a complicated braid.

A s<iuiir(' inch of this weave, enlaroed (see li<>-. IT), taken from the 
part of tlu> t(>xtui-e where the rectangular nie.sh(>s or phiin work pass 
into the lo/cnge-shaiM'd in(\shes, will show the peculiar method of sepa- 
rating tiic wai'p threads and working the halves alternately to the right 
and to th(> left.' In tlu^ bottom row the pairs of warp straws ar(^ per- 
pendicular and gathered into the twined weaving so as to produce rec- 
tangular spaces. All the rows above this are in the pattern luu'o 
described. From the Attn Island, collected ])y William 11. Dall. 

Plate 1-tli shows the tine close-twined work done on the extreme 
western islands of the Aleutian chain. The specimen luu'c described 
is Catalogue No. 204588, U. S. National Museum, the gift of Mrs. 
Mary Ij. D. Putnam, of Davenport, Iowa. Its noteworthy features 
are the crossed warp and the patterns worked in colored worsted on 
the surface. The material is beach grass, some species of Elyiuus. 
The false embroidery on the surface, there can be no doubt, is bor- 
rowed in its method from the Tlinkit Indians of southeastern Alaska. 
Among the old Aleut wallets, of which there are many in the National 
Museum, the weaving does not begin to be so tine as on this later ware. 
It is the same story of progress. With the possession of better 
knowledge, of superior tools, of gauges for sizing the straws, and, 
above all, of such demands for their products as to stimulate emulation 
to its highest pitch, the Atka and Attn weavers have reached their 
climax. 

Plate 143 is introduced to show the technic of variety No. 5, 
diverted warp coml)ined with variety No. 2, or open work. Fig. 1 
illustrates the general etfect of this combination. Attention has 
been called l)efore to the enigmas awakened by the great variet}^ 
and exquisite taste of these people, our first possession in the East- 
ern Hemisphere. In tigs. l> and c the detail will be better under- 
stood. In tig. 1j the first row has parallel warp. In the next row 
each pair of continuous warp straws are crossed. In the third row^ 
they proceed vertically, and so do most of them in the fourth I'ow, Init 
here and there they ai*e crossed again l)ack to the position they occu- 
pied in the second row. These, too, continue in the oblique direction 
in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth rows, crossed in each with a 
straw of that particular row. In the upper course they return to 
the vertical position. The twined weaving is precisely the same in 
every case. It does not vary whether in the closed weaving or open 
weaving. No artistic effect is expected thereof rom. In this plate, where 
the decorative form is started in the bottom row and begins to w^den 
out all of the intersections within the parallelograms are crossed. At 
the tenth row, above the iq^pcr border of the draw'ing, the straws 
return to their vertical position immediately over the starting point,

These two are onl^^ specimens of the innumerable ways of producing 
efl'ects in Aleutian 1)askets by changes in the warp. 

It will add to the interest in the Attn weaver to see her at her work. 
Plate 144, taken by Engineer C. (ladsden Porcher, of the United States 
Revenue Marine, shows her at the front door of her 1)arabra or under- 
ground hut. She is essentialh^ a cave dweller. The framework of 
the house may be driftwood, wreckage, or timl)er deposited l)y ships. 
Over this moss from the tundra is piled, and nature plants her garden. 

The first thing that demands notice is that she is weaving upward — 
upside down, a careless first thought would say. The bottom of her 
line wallet is suspended from a pole, most primitive of warping ])eams, 
stuck into the I'oof of the barabra. John Smith's Indians used a limb 
of a tree (fig. 148). The Bristol Bay Eskimo now employ a stick sup- 
ported on forked stakes; so do the Chilkats for their highl3^-prized 
blankets, and the tribes farther south to make cedar-bark garments. 
Indeed, the loom is al)out to be born. With a lens it will be seen that 
the basket maker is doing the best work, in which every variet}^ of 
Aleutian technic is engaged. Her costume shows her to r)e in the 
current of world-eml^racing commerce and thought. The plants 
about her and the precious work of her hngeis, together with the 
ideas in her attentive mind, are survivals from the past. 

TLINKIT BASKETRY 

The basket work of the Tliidvit Indians is superb. Everyone who 
sees it is struck with its delicacy of workmanship, shape, and orna- 
mentation. Most of the specimens in the National Museum collection 
are of the bandbox shape, but they can be doubled up flat like a 
grocer's bag. (Plates 65 and (il.) The material of foundation and 
sewing is the young and tough root of the spruce, split, and used 
either in the native color or dj^ed brown or black. The structure 
belongs to the twined tjq^e before mentioned and there is such uni- 
formity and fineness in the warp and woof that a water-tight vessel 
is produced with very thin walls. In size the wallets vary from a 
diminutive trinket basket to a capacity of nearly a bushel. All sorts 
of designs in bands, crosses, rhombs, chevrons, triangles, and grecques 
are produced thus: First, the bottom is woven plain in the color of 
the material. In a great many pieces a row of plain weaving alter- 
nates with the twined weaving for economy. Then in the building up 
of the basket bands of plain color, red and black, are woven into the 
structure, having the same color on both sides. " Afterwards little 
squares or other plain figures made into designs are sewed on in

aresene, or what is here called false embroideiT, that is, only halfway 
through, g'ivino- the most varied effect on the outside, while the inside 
shows only the plain colors and the red and black V)ands. Wild rye 
straws {Elyinu.s) for coarse work and hair grass {iMsc/iat/ij/sia) on tine 
work are used in this second operation, in plain rich golden color or 
dyed, being whipped over and over along the outer threads of the 
luiderlying woof. Other grasses for false embroidery are Panlcularia 
nervata^ Cahiniagrodis langsdorfli^ Cinna latifolia, and Broinussitchen- 
sk. (See Plate 1-1-5.) 

No more attractive form and ornamentation are to be seen than 
those produced ])y the Indians of this Tlinkit stock. 

The Tlinkit recognize tive styles of weave, not including the tish- 
trap, the false embroidery in grasses and plant stems, and the plaited 
l)orders. These are all in twined weaving, the progress of the woi'k 
being from left to right and the outer woof strand sloping downward. 
Lieutenant Emmons gives the native name of each as follows: 

1. Plain close-twined weaving, Wush tookha r-kee ('"close together 
work''), which is perfectly water-tight and is the standard weave of 
fully three-quarters of all baskets made. It consists of the simple 
twining of two woof strands around each successive thickness of 
warp splints. The regular weave produces the vertical ridge-like 
appearance in the line of the warp, the polished exterior surface of 
the root forming the outside or ornamental face of the work. 

An openwork work ])asket in this plain twined weaving is known 
as Khart ("a strainer,"" literally, " will not hold water"). It is used 
in trying out tish oil and in cooking and straining l)erries. 

'2. Twined and checker weaving, Khark gheesut ('Mietween," "in 
the middle of"), from the introduction of a single woof strand in 
checker or wicker weaving between the lines of the regular twined 
stitch. It gives a broken, irregular effect from the exposure of the 
warp along the line of the single weft, as well as from the dull, ffljrous 
surface of both of these strands, which are of the coarsest inner sec- 
tions of the root. This weave is of a later origin; the plain weaving 
has been l)orrowed from the mainland and from the more southern 
people. It is characteristic of the cedar-bark work from Frederick 
Sound to the Straits of Fuca. It is wanting on the oldest specimens 
of Yakutat baskets. Its use is conlined to the coarser work, such as 
the plaque-like berry, sewing, and workbaskets of the woman, the 
bottoms of the 1)askets and the unexposed tops of the covered basket. 
It is in gi-eat favor among the C'hilkat, who make many large baskets. 
It is used for economy, l)oth in the (piantity and the (piality of the 
material, as one woof strand is saved in every three and in the more 
valued exterior root section the saving is one-half. But its disadvan- 
tages are loss of strength, rigidity, and closeness of texture, and it 
does not admit of the embroidery in grasses and plant stems, which is 
the characteristic feature of Tlinkit basketry. (See tig. 1-iO.) 



408 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

3. Diag-onal twined weaving-, Hiktch hee ha r-see (rough or uneven, 
like tlie skin of the frog's back, from its mottled character), is formed 
by the simple twining of two woof strands about pairs of warp ele- 
ments. The weave separates the pairs in each superimposed line of 
woof, and breaks joints in the units of weave, just as in myriads of Attn 
and Ute baskets. (See Plates 96, lis.) It is, in fact, w^ell-known twilled 
weaving. This weave was never extensively used among the Tlinkit, 
except as a skip stitch in conjunction with the ordinary twining (No. 
1), whereby a number of geometric figures are produced which form 
the ornamentation of the Haida hat rim and the Chilkat basket border. 
As a weave it seems to have been confined to the double basket. 

Shuck kuhk (straw^berr}' basket) has erroneously been classed as a 
type of weave, but it is simply a variation of the regular twined weave 
(No. 1), in which the woof strands are of different colors, so that in 
both the vertical and the horizontal lines there is produced a variety 
of effects, supposed to resemble the seed-covered surface of the wild 
strawberry. This character of ornamentation is more commonly 
found in hands on the women's workbasket and on mats of basket 
covers. The ffecking of the surface of twined ware with dark and 
light spots is not confined to the Tlinkit, but will l)e o()served among 
all Western tribes that have this weave. 

4. Crossed- warp twined weaving, Wark kus-ka rt ("ej^e holes" 
from the polygonal meshes of the openwork weave), in which the warp 
splints are drawn aside from the perpendicular at a fixed angle, the 
odd numbers trending one way and the even numbers the other. These 
cross each other successively in parallel series, just after which they 
are inclosed and held in place by the ordinary twining of two-woof 
strands. The size of the meshes is regulated by the distance apart of 
the spirals of the weave. This tj^pe was used for rather long, flat 
cases or bags, l)ut more particularly for spoon baskets, which are fit- 
ted with a twisted root handle to hang them to hooks or pegs on the 
wall. In later years ornamental baskets are often made in this weave. 

5. Three-strand twined weaving, Uh ta'hk-ka (twisted). This gives 
a longer winding, rope-like appearance to the weave outside, while 
on the inside the regular twining stitch in its ridge-like regularity is 
seen. It is strengthening as well as decorative and is often met with 
in circles at intervals near the bottoms of the larger, older baskets, 
which are required for the heavier work. It is in general use to-day 
as a single line of woof around the outer circumference of the cylin- 
der Ijasket, w^here the warp splints are bent upward to form the 
sides. Its more important use has been in the construction of the 
crown of the hat as well as of the cylindrical ornaments surmounting 
it, and other ceremonial headdresses among both the Haida and the 
Tlinkit. 

The Tlinkit do not seem to have learned, or were forbidden by

Figs. 138 and 13t> illustrate the method of making false embroideiy 
on the basketry of the Tlinkit Indians, As the woman proceeds with 
her work she wraps the grass stem once around each strand of the 
regular twine when it comes outside. On the inside, therefore, there 
is no appearance of ornament: the figure plainly shows how this work 
is done and it might be called a type of three-strand twined weaving in 

which one of the elements passes inside 
the warp. Ornamentation on this ware is 
also produced b}^ dyeing the filaments of 
which the basket is made. This specimen 
is Catalogue No. 20726 in the U. S. National 
Museum, and was collected by James G. 
Swan. 

Fig. 140, from the Tlinkit tribes aljout 
Fort Wrangell, in southeastern Alaska, is 
a carrying wallet for general purposes. 
It is an interesting and important speci- 
men in that it forms the connecting link 
between common plain in and out weaving 
and twined work, both plain and twilled, 
from the tribes immediately north and the Haidas. The specimen 
is made of spruce root and the rows of weaving are alternately 
twined and wicker over the entire surface of the wallet. In examples 
already described this combination of two weaves was seen on the bot- 
toms, for economy, but in this piece the whole surface was thus cov- 
ered. The coarser type is shown in fig. 141 from the Tlinkit Indians

Chilkats, Hunalis, Sitkas, Takoos, Tongass, and Yakutats." It will 
be noted in lookino- at the women in the group that the Tlinkits are a 
well-fed, vig-orous race. The Russians spoke well of them, not oidy 
for their physical qualities but for their intelligence. 

The group is a study in more respects than in basketry. They are 
all clad in trade goods. As to jewelry, one wears her rings on her 
fingers, but the chief woman has hers in the septum of her nose. Old 
forms of basketry are mingled with covered bottles and the ubiquitous 
can (Kanastron), formerly a basket ])oth in Greek and Tlinkit, stands 
by the side of the genuine article. Before leaving the group it is 

worth while to recall that 
with thrifty tribes new tricks 
of handicraft are readily 
borrowed and too nuich 
stress must not be laid on 
the assumption of identity 
of race because of identit}" 
of art. It is worth while to 
linger here a moment. The 
Attn woman as well as the 
old time Algonquian tribes 
did suspend warp for bas- 
kets and matting, l)ut here 
among the Chilkat is to be 
seen the pristine loom. It 
is not surprising when it is 
remembered that here the 
Rock}" Mountain goat is at 
home. 

On the main land of the 
northern Pacitic slope the 
mountain goat ( Oreainnos 
montann^i) abounds. From the Chilkat Indians about Mount St. Elias 
southw^ard to the Nez Perces of Idaho, blankets are woven from the 
wool. These fabrics are, in their manufacture, the transition from 
basketry to loom work. The}" are in twined weaving. The only 
shuttles are the skillful fingers of Indian women; the warp hangs down

Vernon Bailey .says of the material that the winter coat of the 
mountain goat is a dense piece of long, soft wool, with strong, coarse 
hairs scattered through it. In spring and earl}- summer, when the 
wool is being shed, and hangs in loose strings on the. goat, it catches 
on bushes and rocks and the low branches of timber line trees. On

HAIDA BASKETKY 



The Haida Indians live on Queen Charlotte Archipelago and adjacent 
islands. Their basket work is all in twined weaving and differs from 

that of the Tlinkits in 



artistic finish only, owing 
pro])al)ly to the demands 
of trade. Their wallets 
of spruce are devoid of 
decoration, save here and 
there a band in plain 
black color, as would be 
the Tlinkit without em- 
broidery; but hats made 
by these Indians are mas- 
terpieces in execution and 
ornamental weaving. The 
crown is in three strand 
or plain twined weaving 
of the most delicate work- 
manship, and the fabric 
is perfectly water-tight 
when thoroughly wet. 
Ornamentation is intro- 
duced into the brims b}'^ 
a series of diamond pat. 
terns in twilled weave 
covering the whole sur- 
face. This decoration is 
produced thus: Beginning 

at a certain point, the weaver includes two warp strands in a half twist 

instead of one; then makes two regular twists around single Avarp 

strands. The next time she weaves around 

she repeats the process, but her double 

stitch is one warp stem in advance of or 

behind its predecessor. A twilled effect of 

any shape may be thus produced, and 

rhombs, triangulated fillets, and chevrons 

made to appear on either surface. (See 

figs. 143 and l-tl.) 

The fastening off of the work is done 

either by bending down the free ends of 

the warp and shoving them out of sight 

under the stitches of the twisted web or a 

braid of four strands forms the last row, set on so that the braid 

shows outside and only one strand at a time shows inside. The ends 

of the warp splints are then cropped close to the braid.

Special attention slioiild l)e paid to the fact that the oruamentation 
on these hats is painted and not woven. 
(Sec tig-. 143.) Not far awa}^ on the 
mainland, the same motives appear on 
l)lankets, woven into the texture. Fig-s.

of ornamentation in vogue among the

of their various totems on all of their 
houses, wood and slate carvings, and 
the ornamentation of their implements." 
Shells, l)eads, and feathers are often 
sewed on in profusion. 

Catalogue No. 88064, collected by 
J. G. Swan, is a twined openwork bas- 
ket of spruce root made l)y the Haida 
Indians. This piece of coarse work- 
manship shows both phases — the open 
and the close weave in rough inner 
splints. The handle is a twine of the 
same material fastened into the weaving 
while it is in progress. The border is 
effected by bending down the warp ele- 
ments at the rim externally and sewing 
them in place with a row of twined 
weaving. 

A square inch of this specimen taken 
near the top, where the open work and 
the close work come together, is shown.

next, the uniinished portion exhibiting 
the warp as it appears before weaving.

" A very interesting instance of survival is to be seen in the rag carpets of these 
Indians. The missionaries have taught the women to save up their rags and to cover 
their floors with pretty mats. They are allowed to weave them in their own way, 
however, and the result is constructed on the ancient twined model, precisely as the 
weaving is done on the mats and hats.

The material is splints of spruce, 
some of which have been dyed sim-

mud. The Haidas used little color 
decoration other than black bands 
in their work, but they have learned 
the art of producing figures b}' in- 
cluding more than Avarp element in 
the twining. They also know the 
art of three-strand twined work, as 
will be seen on the upper border 
of the two larger wallets. The

Basketry is the most expressive veliicle of tlie tribe's individualitv, Hie embodiment of its 
mythology pnd folklore, tradition, poetry, art, and spiritual aspiration. — Neltje Blanchan. 

The next general area for study will be the drainage region of the 
Eraser River and the Columbia River. The families to be visited will 
be the Chimmeseyan, Wakashan or Aht, Salishan, Shahaptian, and 
Chinookan. Other smaller groups are scattered around and will be 
treated at the proper place in the text. The transition from south- 
eastern Alaska to this area is almost imperceptible in some respects 
and radical in others. The Tlinkit false embroidery will not disap- 
pear, but it will be remanded to a far humbler place. The roots and 
inner bark of the cedar will occupy the front rank. Coiled and imbri- 
cated work, unknown among the Tlinkits and Haidas, will bloom out 
in British Columbia and Washington. The semifiexible wallet will 
be replaced Iw the rigid cooking basket and the soft bags of hemp. 
The differentiation from the next area south of it will also be mai'ked.

The small Chimmcscvan family, also called Tsimshian and Letter 
known as Nass, are the extreme northern of the group. Their bas- 
ketry is of root and runs largely into the mixed twined, checker, and 

twilled. i. ^ 4.1 

Necessarily coming southward from the spruce-root country to the 
cedar area would have the effect to change nuich of the basketry from 
rioid surfaces to tlexil)le and from twined weaving to checker and 
twilled work. The National Museum possesses no specunens ot 
Chinnnesevan ware of striking individuality. 

The ^Vakashan tribes occupy northern and western Vancouver Island, 
the coast of British Columbia, and a small point of land m the north- 
west corner of Washington. They are generally known by the name 
\ht or Nootka on Vancouver Island, and include Boas s Ivwakmtl 
•md the Bella Bella and Haeltzuk on the mainland. In recent years 
they have been studied by Boas, by Tolmie and Dawson, and l>y hwan. 

A list of authorities will be found

"^ In addition to thc^ matting, both

tion, or the alternate rows of lacing may run in opposite directK.ns, 
as in fio-. l-t9. As a matter of fact, in a soft and pliable material this 
operation pushes the uprights forward a little, giving to the fabric an 
appearance of the lathe work on the back of a watch. (See fig. l..(>.)

checker work from the plain twine which completes the bottom. The 
sides are built up of cedar-bark warp, both vertical and horizontal, and 
a wrapping of golden-colored grass stems. These straws take different 

colored dyes readil3^,and so the Ma- 
kahs have learned to ornament their 
l^askets with geometric patterns in 
black, yellow, drab, red, blue, etc. 
The pattern, therefore, is alike on 
both sides, although the wrappings 
are, as in Clallam, Nez Perce, and 
other specimens, inclined on the out- 
side and vertical on the inside. The 
rows of wrappings run at an angle 
of 45 degrees, which separate the 
elements, having a rhomboid ap- 
pearance.

thuH formed l)eing white upon one side and l)laok upon tlie otlier. These double 
strands are used not only where figures appear, but througliout tlie groundwork 
of the design as well. The figures are principally black upon a white ground. In 
forming them the strands are simply reversed, the black sides which were con- 
cealed beneath the grass spires in the white background being carried outward. 
In some of the specimens the knob at the top is woven separately and afterwards 
joined to the hat. (See figs. 152,153. ) 

Comparing the descriptions with tiio technical processes worked out 
in this paper, it is evident that the Nutka trilies understood what 
is called overlaying. It is not the Makah wrapped weaving nor 
like the Nez Perce and other Shahaptian weave, 1)ut will be found 
in the Modoc and other California tribes as well as abundantlj'^ 
among the Salish. (See Plate 155, tig. 5.) The double hat is sug- 
gestive of the Orient, from which the royal Spanish fleet returned 
by wa}^ of Vancouver every 3'ear for two centuries (1570-1770). 

The National Museum has an example of twilled weaving from Van- 
couver Island, which should bo compared with Clallam ware. It is a 
large fish basket made from the split root of a cedar. Attempts at 
ornamentation are, first, in using alternatcl}^ the smooth, natural 
wood and the inner, coarse surface of the splint, also b}^ introducing 
strips in cedar root with the bark adherent, and finally, hy laying on 
the outside certain strips the leaves of bear grass. With this variety 
of material, although the basket is as coarse as it can be, the effect is 
excellent. The finishing ofi:' is in three rows of twined weaving, in 
which black yarn and bear grass are laid on the fiber to give variety 
and color. The upright elements in the weaving are bent down on 
the inside and held together b}" a continuous row of buttonhole stitches. 
On the border is a scallop formed ])y a two-strand rope which passes 
underneath the l)order, back and through itself. Dimensions: height, 
18 inches; width, 24 inches. Collected by G. T. Emmons. (See 
Plate 152.) 

Plate 153 is a delightful mixture of two extremes in culture. Two 
Makah or Nutka women are clad in calico, woolen blanket, piano cover, 
bandana handkerchiefs, etc., not neglecting the latest patent in safety 
pins. They are seated on a mat of cattail {Typha latlfoUa) stems, 
sewed together ia genuine aboriginal fashion, known before Columbus. 
And their fingers are following their conservative thoughts as though 
these cunning weavers had been born centuries ago. They are making 
from filanuMits of cedar bark and leaves of squaw grass the kind of 
twined weaving called wrapped in this paper (figs. 18, 14). The warp 
is plain, twisted from cedar bark. One element of the weft is of 
the same material and laid horizontally inside the warp; the other 
weft element, of scpiaw grass {Xeroj)hiiUvm timax), is wrapped in a 
continuous coil al)out the intersections of the other two elements.

One of tho laro(\st fiimiiics and most diversitiod, so far as industries 
are concernc^d, are the Salishan tri])es, east and soutii of th(^. Wakashan 
A small and detached ])ody of them are to be found on Bentinck Arms, 
northern l)i-itish Cohunbia, hemmed in on the east ))y Athapascan 
tribes and on the west l.)y Wakashan tribes. The rest of the family are 
spread out in British Columbia and Washington, extending from 
Pug-et Sound northward, southward, and eastward across Idaho and 
even into Montana. A small body of th(^ same family ai'e on the 
Oregon coast, about the forty-tifth parallel. 

Situated as thesc^ tril)es are, in the midst of so many other linguistic 
families, it is not surprising to tind a great variety in the types of 
their basketry. In the plates here shown (Plates 154 and 155) tig. 1 
represents ])lain checker weaving; tig. li, twilled weaving, in which 
both warp and weft pass over two; Hg. 3, another form of twilled 
work, in which warp and weft pass alternately over two and imder one. 
Figs. 4 and 5 show the methods of coiled and ind)ricated sewing 
in the bottom and on the body of a Thom})s()n Riven- or si so-called 
Klikitat basket. Especial attention will be called later to these 
types. Fig. O is plain twined weaving in openwork. Fig. 7 is an 
example of plain twined weaving in openwork over crossed warp 
of a special character in which every alternate one is \'ertical and 
the other inclined. It can be easily seen by looking at the tigure 
that warps arranged vertically and parallel, ever}' other one turns 
to the left and is caught, not in the twist just above it, but in the 
first one beyond. Figs. S and i> show the outside and inside of lat- 
ticed or bird-cage work; tig. 10, a form of twined work in which 
the tough liber is overlaid hy grass leaves or other colored tiber, 
adding to the ornamentation but not to the strength; tig. 11, false 
embroidery, in which the outer element of the twine is wrapped 
with an additional filament. Myron Eells, who has spent many 
years among them, and to whom Plates 154 and 155 are to l)e 
credited, asserts that styles of weaving peculiar to the stocks near by 
are practiced by a few women of Salishan tribes. This can l)e accounted 
for in two ways — women from these outside stocks may have married 
into the tribes under consideration, or, as is fre(|uently the case, the 
Salish women, in order to learn something new, have taken up the 
methods of their neighl)ors. 

Immediately south of the Haidas and Tlinkits, the bark of the 
white cedar {Thuja yllcatit) becoming common, the inner portion is 
quite tenacious, and since tilaments of almost any recjuired width and 
length may be obtained, checkerwork weaving is in demand for mats, 
sails, receptacles for all sorts of objects, parts of house furniture, 
and even of clothing. The tigure here shown is a typical example 
of many hundreds of such baskets to be found in collections. The 



422 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 



bottom and side.s are in the same type of weaving. By an endless 
variety of real and proportional width of warp and weft and by col- 
oring some of the strips an indefinite number of patterns may be 
produced. (See fig. ISi.) 

In many cedar-bark receptacles of this region the two sets of fila- 
ments — warp and weft — run diagonall} ; that is, they are not woven 
as in a loom, but the maker begins at the corner. Looked at verti- 
cally, the surface has a diamond rather than a checker appearance, but 
from the point of view of the maker the intersections are square. 
Again, but much more rareh', three sets of filaments are involved, 
two belonging to the warp and the other one to the weft. The warp 
elements cross at right angles or less, and the weft element runs 
across through the intersections, making a series of rhombs. This 
same technic is ahnost universal in Japan.

Bilhula Indians, British Columbia. 

Collected bv James (i. Swan. 



In addition to the oblique method of weaving the checker patterns 
in cedar ])ark, occasional diagonally or twilled weaving is to ]>e seen 
in the same area. 

A large collection of these were gathered l)y James CI. Swan along 
the coast of r>ritish Cohnnbia, and are now for examination in the 
U. S. National Museum. 

Ornamentation in bark work is effected both ])y introducing different 
colored strands and 1)y varying the width of the warp and the woof 
threads. In many exanq^les the bottom of the basket is bordered and 
outlined with one or more rows of the twined or plaited style of weav- 
ing to give greater stabilit}^ and definition to the form. Cedar mats of 
large size and made with the greatest care enter as extensivel}" into 
the daily life of the Indians of this vicinit}^ as do the buffalo robes into 
that of the Dakota Indians. 

The Bilhulas made ver^^ neat baskets, called "•Zei))usqna"' as well 
as hats and water-tight vessels, all of fine cedar roots.

They boil the cedar root until it becomes pliable to l)e worked by the hand and 
beaten with sticks, when they pick the fibers apart into threads. The warj) is of a 
different material — sinews of the whale, or dried kelp thread. 

They also are expert in weaving the inner bark of the cedar. 

It is not astonishing that a material so easily Avoven should have 
found its way so extensively in the industries of this stock of Indians. 
Neither should we wonder that the checker pattern in weaving should 
first appear on the west coast among the only people possessing a 
material eminently adapted to this form of manipulation. It is only 
another example of that beautiful harmony between man and nature 
which delights the anthropologist at every step of his journey. 

Farther south in British Columbia a Salish people demanding care- 
ful attention are those formerly called Couteau or Knife Indians ])y 
the Hudson Bay Company's people. Their home is the southern 
interior of British Columljia, mostly east of the Coast Range, and is 
about 100 miles long and 90 miles wide. Their basketrj^ is described 
by James Teit of Spences Bridge, British Columbia." The basket 
work above L3'tton is of birch bark, spruce bark, and willow twigs, 
and the rims ornamented with stitches made from the bark of Prumis 
deinism. The Indians on the lower division of the Thompson River 
and on the Upper Fraser make beautiful coiled and imbricated baskets 
of cedar roots (77/7yrtj>>//cc<to) This type of basketry is also made by 
the Chilcotin and Lillooet, and Shushwap, who are said to employ 
spruce root. 

William Arnott, of North Bend, gives the following Thompson River 
Indian names for baskets: Tsai, ordinary ol)long style; spanach, 
small oblong and square; spa panach, very small; nikwoeten, round; 
spanikwoeten, small round; sklokw, very large. 

Wallets are made of a twined weaving, the character of which is 
shown in Teit\s tig. 132. Designs on these fal)rics are in embroidery 
or by weaving colored grasses or bark twine into the fal)ric, as 
shown in the same figure. This style of weaving seems to have been 
acquired recently through intercourse with the Sahaptin. 

The Lower Thompson Indians weave mats of strips of cedar bark of 
the same style as those used by the coast Indians (Teit\s tig. 133). 

At the present day rag mats or rugs are often made from scraps of 
cloth, calico, etc. The patterns on these are mostly the same as those 
on basketry. 

The Thompson Indians also practice twined weaving in coarse bag- 
ging and in matting from tule {Scirpus), bulrush {Ty2)ha latifolia)^ and 
the twined weft of the bark of Apoci/n urn connahinum. These Indians 
also knew how to make mats by stringing them. The reed or stick is 
perforated at two or more places and a cord passed through the holes. 

It is interesting to find among them also blankets made from twisted

424 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

strips of rabbit skin used as weft and laid together bj^ twined weaving. 
Attention is especially called to a method of ornamental overla3'ing 
among the Thompson River Indians that has not a wide distribution. 
An ordinary wallet is made of twined work from the fiber of Ajyocynurri 
can nah 1)111111 and Ascle-pui.s speckmL In the fabric these do not differ 
from the world-wide twined weaving, but in the ornamentation a strip 
of grass or other colored material — may])e corn husk — is wrapped 
around the twined work as it proceeds. Comparing this with the 
Makah wrapped work the twined weft takes the place of the strip laid 
behind the vertical warps, the wrapping is precisely the same, ])ut in 
the Thompson River work the patterns are quite similar on Ijoth 
sides, only the elements are oblicpie on the outside and vertical on the 
inside. 

The weaving of ])lankets In' basketry processes was former^ an 
important industry among them. The coast Indians utilized both dog 
hair and goat hair in their manufacture, l)ut the Thompson Indians 
seemed to have used the latter oid}-. Sometimes the wool was made 
whiter or cleaned by mixing a quantity of l)aked white diatomaceous 
earth with it and ))eating the whole with a flat stick. The manner of 
making the thread is exactly the same as that described ])y Dr. Boas 
for the process employed by the Songish. The loom and spindle are 
also the same, excepting that both disk and shaft of the latter are of 
wood. The whole process of ))lanket making and the implements used 
are said to be exactly the same as those found among the Lower Eraser 
Indians. Most blankets had a f i-ing(^ of tassels, (3 to 9 inches in length, 
along one end. Black liear's hair madc^ into threads, and spun threads 
of goafs hair dyed either yellow with lichens or red with alder bark, 
were woven into the Ijlankets in patterns similar to those used in ))as- 
ketry. The Indians of Spuzzum contimie to make these blankets at 
the present day. 

For making nets, threads of the bark of Apcc/f/nn// <-aii)i((hl)iuiii Avere 
used. A wooden netting stick (Teit's fig. 184) served for making the 
meshes of ecpial size. Th(> meshes wer(? tied with a sc[uare knot. 

The Rev. Myron Eells states that tiic imbricated basketry is made 
))y the Puyallups, Twanas. Snohomish, Clallam, Skagit, Cowlitz, Che- 
halis, Nisciually, Spokan, and Scpiakson who are Salish, as well as 
by the Yakima and Klikitat Indians of middle and western Wash- 
ington who are Shahaptian. Only womiMi and girls are basket 
makers; they use in securing material the ordinary root digger. 
Pieces of the desired length and about the thickness of a finger are 
buried in the gi'ound to keep them fresh. When re(pured they are 
taken out and peeled with a sharp stone or knife and hung up to 
dry. When needed they are split into long strips by means of the 
bone awl. The pieces of the desired width and thickness throughout 
are used for stitching; the others form the foundation of the coil, 



ABOEIGIKAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 425 

which in the weaving- is kept of uniform thiclcness by adding fresh 
material. Foundations are also in narrow strips of wood. Mr. Teit 
makes the important assertion that the stitches of the preceding- coil 
are intentionally split b}^ the awl. Examples of this kind of work are 
common in collections. On the bottom and back as well as ends of the 
baskets ornamental strips are often overlaid or decorated l)y a proc- 
ess here called beading. In many examples strips of cedar and other 
woods are used as foundations. The method of ornamentation employed 
is imbrication, described on page 310, the material for the overlaying 
being a glossy yellow-white grass. 

As soon as enough is known about the geographic distribution of 
this imbricated type of weaving a bettin- classitication can he made. 
The following characteristics will sufhce as a general guid(»: 

1. F<)un<lathin. — Either a I)undle of splints, someAvhat cylindrical in 
form, oi- narrow Hat strips of wood usually laid in pairs. 

iJ. SciriiKj. — All done in splints of root; in some baskets the stitch 
is carefully and systematically l)ifurcated on the outside, in others 
whole. 

3. Bott<ym. — Either a flat spiral circular or eilipticid in outline, as 
in most of the Washington varieties and in some of the farthest 
removed of the British C-olumbia specimens, or a series of straight 
rows of sewing. The bottoms of many of the baskets of this last type 
are receding, and even a border is built up outside of the structure of 
the basket. (Compare Plate 157 with Plate 103. ) 

■1. (rOKi'dl s/i<//)f. — Either conical, rectangular, pyramidal, or 
fanciful. 

5. .Decoration. — Designs covering the whole surface; designs on the 
upper part of the surface only; and designs around the middle, leaving 
the top and ])ottom plain or separately figured. In some heading is 
mixed with the imbricated ornament. It may not amount to tribal 
diti'erences, but some baskets are decorated in front with iml)rications, 
and plain or beaded on the back and ends. Jt is impossible with the 
knowledge at present in liand to make a perfect ethnic chai't of this 
wonderfully \aried type of workmanshi}). 

Plate 150 is a covered basket box in imbricated coiled work, from 
Douglas Harbor, liritish Columbia, now in the collection of Fred 
Harvey, Albucpierque, New Mexico. Th(» foundation and sewing are 
of cedar or spruce root, and the im)>rications are in s(]uaw grass and 
cedar bark. The noticeal)le feature in this s})ecimen is the coiled 
work. In order to diminish the amount of sewing, the basket maker 
has thought of the expedient used 1)V the Mescalero Apache Indians 
of the south, and seen on specimens from other localities, of widening 
the foundation of the coil. In the Douglas Harbor examples, strips 
of wood take the place of two or more stems arranged one above 
another.

baskets, showing both imbrication and overlaying with grass. The 
specimens shown in this plate are in the collection of Miss A. M. Lang, 
The Dalles, Oregon. They should be examined carefully with respect 
to the characteristics of foundation, stitch, shape, design, and quality 
mentioned above. 

Fig. 155 is a precious old coiled and imbricated basket. The bot- 
tom is made up of lifteen foundation rods laid parallel. Each one of 
these is overlaid by a strip of bright yellow squaw grass. Thus pre- 
pared, these rods are sewed together by coil stitching, which are split 
or bifurcated, and some trifurcated in the operation. Again, while 
the stitching is solid on the inside, those in sight are from one-eighth 
to one-fourth of an inch apart on the outside, showing that every 
other stitch is under the straw. On the outside of this rectangular

bottom the regular coiled work ])egins and the body is l)uilt up, the 
stitches all ])eing concealed bv what in this treatise is called imbricated 
ornament or knife plaiting, carefully descril)ed and Illustrated else- 
where. In this example the oi-namentation is in squaw grass, cherry 
bark, and cedar bark, dyed black. (See iigs. 52-55.) 

The foundation of the coiled work is not a single rod, but a Ininch 
of splints made from the cedar root. Catalogue No. 60235 in the 
U. S. National Museum was procured from Sitka, Alaska, Indians by 
J. J. McLean, to which place it had doubtless drifted in trade from 
the Fraser River region. Its length is 8i inches and height 3i inches. 

Mr. Hill-Tout reports that for boiling their food the N'tlaka pamuq 
tribe (Salishan famil}'), on the Fraser and the Thompson River, always 
used basket kettles made like their other basketry from the split roots 
of the cedar. These roots are sometimes red and bhick, and very 



ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 427 

beautiful patterns are made from the three tlifferent colors. The red 
d^^e was obtained from the bark of the alder tree, and the dark stain 
was obtained l)y soakinj^ the roots" in Inack slime or mud, or from the 
root of a fern (Franz Boas). 

Dr. G. M. Dawson, in his " Notes on the Shuswap people of British 
Columbia,'' tells us that these baskets were made from roots of the 
spruce, and Dr. Boas, in his report on the Shuswaps, informs us that 
the basketry of the Shuswaps and N'thika pamuq always used the 
root of the cedar. As the N'tlaka pamuq were preeminent in ])asivet 
making, it is possible that the information oained by Mr. Hill-Tout 
may be accepted as correct, although the cedar {Thuja) is not abun- 
dant in the Thompson River country.''' So skillfully did the women 
make these l)askets that they would hold liquids without trouble. \i\ 
preparing food two kettles were used, one containing water for wash- 
ing otf any dirt that jnight adhere to the heated stones, and the other 
for holding the food. In ]>oiling salmon for eating, the tish were tied 
up in birch bark to prevent ))reaking and falling to pieces. 

The Washington or southern imbricated ware is far more true to 
the old type than the northern, as exaiuples will show. It may be 
divided roughly between Salishan and Shahaptian. (See Plate IHS.) 

The Klikitat or Shahaptian basket (Plate 158, tig. 2) is thus made: 
The foundation consists of the roots of young spruce and cedar trees. 
TheyMire macerated and split or torn into shreds and soaked for a long 
time. The materials for the ornamentation are thus prepared. Most 
of it is of s(|uaw grass {X<i'<>plujUiiiii tenn.t-). It grows on the east side 
of the Cascade Mountains and can ])e gathered only during the late 
summer, when the snow has melted and the grass has matured. The 
broad leaves are split into the recpiisite width and if they are to retain 
their natural color are soaked in water only. To l)e dyed they are 
soaked in nuid and charcoal for black, in a dye from willow bark for 
brown, and a long time in water for yellow. In some cases cedar l)ast is 
dyed black instead of the grass, but it is not so dui'al)le, or willow bark 
takes the place of the grass. l)ut the surface shrivels. AMth the three 
elements of structure around her, the Klikitat l)asket maker makes up a 
roll of root splints for the beginning of her foundation, which she wraps 
at one end for an inch with sewing splint. Doul)ling this she begins 
her over and over sewing, splitting, sometimes with exquisite taste and 
care, the wood of the stitch underneath. The ornamentation covering- 
more or l(\>^s the surface of every Klikitat basket, called imbricated 
work, is laid on in the process of manufacture. The woman (1) catches 
the end of a strip of grass or bark under a stitch, (2) bends the strip 
forward to cover the stitch, (3) bends it back on itself, leaving about 

« According to Dr. Boas the black dye was oV)tained fi-om the fern root. It is pos- 
sible it was gotten in both ways.

one-eighth of an inch for the next stitch to rest on, (4) makes her 
stitch, draws it home, and bends the grass strip over and covers it. 
It is a kind of knife jjlaiting- hekl down by coiled sewing and is an 
invention of this region." 

Plate 15S, fig. 1, is an example of the Salishan or older type on the 
coast of Washington. It is specimen Xo. 2G12, U. S. National Museum, 
collected ])y Capt. Charles Wilkes. 

The imbricated basketiy of Washington is divided l)y ]V[rs. Molson 
into two classes, by districts. The eastern slope of the Cascade or 
Yakima district belongs to the arid plateau of eastei'n Washington 
and the ])asket technic is heavy, staunch, and of good workmanship, 
but it shows the eli'ect of climate. But the western or Cowlitz liiver 
district produced the perfect imbricated basket, with more coils to 
the inch, more stitches in the same space and also more })eautiful 
designs. 

I am indebted to Mrs. Harriet K. McArtluir for copies of the old 
records relating to the southern imitricated ])askets. The most abso- 
lutei}' beautiful and perfect baskets of this type were made on Cowlitz 
and Lewis rivers in Washington. These places are but a short dis- 
tance from Portland, over in Washington. No imbricated l)askets 
were ever made south of the Columbia, the finest and best are from 
west of the Cascade Mountains. The shaping is more graceful, being 
"woven much finer, and the designs are far more intricate. They 
rarely have the openings around the top for lacing strings. Beautiful 
ones come from the Skokomish ReserA^ation and from the coast, but 
they may have reached these remote places through the medium of 
trade. 

Immersion in water, charcoal, and l)ark dyes is practiced. Cherry 
bark is employed much in British Colum])ia, and sometimes by the 
Klikitats who occasionally put in willow hark which shrinks and 
leaves an ugly stitch. The rare ones with colors — not the tine old 
brown, yellow, and 1)lack, but old rose and purple, are valuable because 
the}" are rare. The old rose is a berry stain and the purple is from a 
root; but they will never rival the old brown in beauty. 

The typical coiled and im])ricated biiskets from west Washington, 
therefore, may l)e called the Cowlitz type. According to Dr. Boas 
most of them are made on the Cowlitz River and north to Fraser 
River. He also l)ears witness that the split sewing and the interlocking 
of stitches are both practiced. The Athapascans seem to have dwelt 
originally in this area, and it is just possible that they carried the 
coiling everywhere. 

The so-called Klikitat baskets are now found on the Yakima Reser- 
vation, in Klikitat and Cowlitz counties, along the Columbia River, in 
the vicinity of The Dalles.

Plate 159 represents old Klikitat baskets, coiled and little iiiil)ri- 
cated, in the collection of Miss Anne M. Lang, The Dalles, Oregon, 
At once the difference will be seen l)etween these conical and quite 
aboriginal forms and those of rectangular shapes farther north in the 
Fraser and Thompson River countries. The method of ornamenta- 
tion is the same, but the borders are finished olf with c-onsiderablc 
skill and taste in braided work. In the National Museum are photo- 
graphs of excellent old pieces in the Harvey collection in Albuquerque. 
For the sake of comparison, Plate 1<!0 is inserted to show later and 
more highly embellished foi'ms. 

The baskets made in imitation of a truidv are used for a similar pur- 
pose and not for berries. The Hudson Bay and other people ])rought 
camphor trunks from the Hawaiian Islands, taken there from China. 
The work is wonderfully good in this as well as in others. The intei"- 
esting part is that the weavers before this time had made baskets with 
rounded bottoms, and began, of course, with the coil in the center; 
but the oblong shape with corners was another matter, so a thin board 
was covered with cloth to form the bottom, and on the edge of this 
the bone awl was used to make perforations to fasten the first row on 
this l)ottom. Later baskets had an ingeniously woven bottom over a 
number of narrow slats, and the patient weaver subsequently mastered 
an ol)long coil. 

From a report of the Conunissioner of Indian Affairs, Governor 
Isaac L. kStevens, 1854, the following statements are taken iji order to 
comprehend the migrations of the tribe after whom imbricated ware 
has been popularly named: 

Tlie tribes of the Klikitat ami Yakima inhaljit i)n)perh' the valley lying l)etweeii 
Mounts St. Helena and Adams, but they have spread over the distrirts ])elonging to 
other tribes and a l)and of them is now located as far south as Umpqua. 

The Klikitats and Yakimas in all essential peculiarities of character are identical 
and their intercourse is constant, but the former, though a mountain tribe, are more 
unsettled in their hal)its than their brethren. The fact is probably due in the first 
place to their having been driven from their homes many years ago by the Cayuses, 
with whom they were at war. They then became acquainted with other parts of the 
country, as well as with the advantages derived from trade. It was not, however, 
until a))out 1839 that they crossed the Columbia, when they overran the Willamette 
Valley, attracted by the game with which it abounded and which they destroyed in 
detlance of the weak and indolent Callapooyas. They still boast that they taught th?; 
latter tribe to ride and hunt. They manifest a peculiar aptitude for trading. 

Under the term Walla Walla (p. 228) are emlu-aced a nund^er of 
bands, living usually on the south side of the Colum])ia and on the 
Snake River, to a little east of the Palouse. 

The Tai-tin-a-pam, a band of the Klikitats already mentioned, liv- 
ing near the head of the Cowlitz, were called by their eastern brethren 
wild or wood Indian. 



430 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

From the report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for 1858 
(p. 225), Puget Sound Agency, T. Simmon, agent, is quoted: 

There is a portion of the Indians of my district whose homes are high up on the 
river, principally on the Nisqually, Puyallup, and Snoqualmie. They are nearly 
related to the Yakimas and Ivlikitats l)y blood, and are sometimes called Klikitats. 

R. S. Landsdale, agent, Wliite Salmon Agency (p. 275), writes: 

Many of the Klikitats were removed during the late war from their former homes, 
west of the Cascade Mountains, to this agency. 

The home of the Klikitat Indians, says Mrs. Molson," was along the 
waters of the Columbia and its tributaries, from the Cascade Mountains 
on the west to the Bitter Root Range on the east, and from 46 degrees 
44 miiuites north, to what is now eastern Washington and northern 
Idaho. They were not only rovers and marauders, but they went on 
annual expeditions to trade, carrying dried buffalo meat and robes, 
but also wild hemp, dried and twisted, to exchange for dried salmon 
and dentalia. They held the gateway between the East and the West, 
for the river was the only route of comuuinication. South of the 
Columbia, along the ocean, is an old path known as the "Klikitat 
trail." They journeyed south by this route and returned north by 
the Klamath trail on the eastern side of the Cascades. There are no 
indications of their being basket makers. Their kindred, still in the 
old home, make no imbricated ware. 

Plate KU is a tj^pical coiled and imbricated berry basket of the Kli- 
kitat Indians, from the collection of Mrs. R. S. Shackelford, from whom 
the following information is received: The inside walls, both founda- 
tion and sewing, are from splints of the root of the giant cedar 
{Thuja plicata)^ collected on the sides of Mount Hood. The orna- 
mentation is the imliricated work described in detail on page 427, the 
materials being of the white Tooksi or squaw grass. Cedar and cherry 
})ark are also used, and for color the yellow dj'e is procured from 
the Oregon grape {Berheris nervosa)^ the brown dye from alder bark, 
and the black from acorns soaked in mud. The meaning of the 
artistic terraced design is not known. Six months were consumed in 
making it. Catalogue No. 207756, U. S. National Museum. The 
following story was gathered from a basket maker b}- Mrs. Shackelford: 

The Spirit told the first weaver to make a basket (tooksi). So she repaired to the 
forest and pondered over her mission. Gathering the plant yi, squaw grass, elk 
grass, pine grass, and the red cedar roots, noo wi ash {Thuja jiUcaia), she began to 
weave, and after many toilsome days a basket was produced. She carried it to the 
lake and dipped it full of water, but it leaked, and the Spirit said to her: " It will 
not do. Weave again a tight basket with a pattern on it." She sat by the water- 
side, and as she looked into the clear depths of the lake the pattern (chato timus) 
was revealed to her in the refracted lines, and with new courage she repaired to the 
depths of the forest and worked until she wrought a basket on which the ripples of

only very few are now left who can weave a faiiltles-s hasket and a i>erfeet imitation 
of chato timus. 

Tho locality whero the .story was learned is Luinini Island. Bellino--

Klikitat, and the Indians of that stock are expert in the use of it; but 
the exploring- expedition did not come in contact with tribes so far in 
the interior. The Salish Indians on Puget Sound make the same type of 
work, and it is known that the very best come from the Cowlitz coun-

imbrication or a knife plaiting-, explained on p. 427, and illustrated in 
figs. 52-54. 

Catalogue No. 2614, U. S. National Museum, shown in Plate 45, is 
an imbricated basket made by an Indian of Salishan family, in Wash- 
ington. It is one of the oldest specimens in the National Museum, 
having been ])rought home by Captain C'harles AVilkes more than sixty 
years ago. The material of the foiuidation and sewing is of cedar 
root. The surface is covered entirely with imt)ricated ornamentation, 
the body color l)eing produced by strips of squaw grass. The figures 
are in cedar bark in natural color and dyed black by means of charcoal 
and mud. The golden color in the straw filaments is produced by 
longer innnersion in water. The most interesting feature in this 
basket is the bottom, which is formed upon a strip of wood three- 

foui'ths of an inch wide and 6 
inches in length. It is very closel}^ 
wrapped or served with a splint of 
root. Upon the margin of this 
the coiled work begins, one round 
being made in plain stitches. Af- 
terwards the patterns are attached 
immediately to this and extend out- 
ward to a black line on the margin, 
th(^ body of the l)asket being com- 
pletely covered with other figures, 
the ends dift'erent from the sides. 
The border is neatly finished ott' in 
false braid. There are about eight 
rows of coiled work and from 
twelve to sixteen stitches to the 
inch. On the outsid(> the stitches are regularly split or furcated. 
Length, 8 inches; depth, 4^ inches. 

Fig. 158 represents a specimen of twilled work by the ('lallam 
Indians and should be compared with Niitka example, Plato 152. It 
is made of fiat splints of white wood, resembling l)irch. The V)ottom 
was woven first and all of the splints ])y ])oing hent upward ))ecome 
the warp of the sides. Twilled ett'ect is produced by passing each 
weft splint over two and under two warj) splints. The fastening off 
of the upper border is done l)y bending down the warp splints and 
holding them in place by a whipping of the same material. The 
scallop on the upper border is formed ]\v looping the middle of two 
splints under the rim, twisting botli pairs of ends into a twine, passing 
one twine through the other, and doubling down to repeat the process 
until the whole is finished. 

Illustrations of this method of makiii<>- twilled work are shown in.

Charles C. Willoughby, who was agent among the Quinaielt or 
Quinault Indians in northwestern Washington, makes the following 
report of their basketry: 

They have the cedar l)ark for the foundation of basketry and strips 
of the pine root for rigid work, hem}), rushes, and grass for the weft 
and ornamentation. The grass used in strengthening the borders of 
mats, rain cloaks, etc., grows on flat places. It is prepared like flax 
b}^ soaking in water until the outer portion decay's, when it is beaten 
with sticks until onh^ the fiber remains. The yellow fiber of squaw 
grass used by Indians for the outside of baskets is a great source of 
traffic, as it is only found in this locality. The basket grass is 
gathered carefull}^, one blade at a time, to secure that part of the 
stalk that reaches about 6 inches under the ground before it meets

at the ends with tihcn-s of cedar ])ark. It is then spread upon the 
ground or upon roofs in the sun. When to be used it is moistened 
with water and split with two small knife blades, set in a stick in 
such a manner as to make tiie strips of the same width, the smaller 
l)ortion being thrown away. The grass is kept moist with water 
while being made into l>askets. The colored grasses are prepared by 
using aniline dyes. They were formerly colored by steeping the 
roots of plants that yielded a yellow coloring. A red dyo was made 
from the bark of alder, and a ])aint was made of blue clay. "

pass above and below the warp, as 
in ordinary plain weaving, across

Plate 163, bottom tigure, is a Thompson River basket in the collec- 
tion of J. W. Benhani. It is introduced here for the purpose of show- 
ing how the Indian woman's mind struggled with the problem of 
starting the bottom of a rectangular coiled 1)asket. It has been said 
that the Thompson Piver Indians do not understand this process, but 
many old Thompsons have coiled bottoms and this technic is older 
than the other. The work begins by wrapping a foundation of splints 
with the split root of spruce or cedar for or more inches. This is

then doubled upon itself and the sewing begins and proceeds back- 
ward and forward, as in plowing, until fifteen rows are made; the 
coiling then actually begins, the sewing extending not only along the 
sides but across the ends, making a parallelogram, which is extended 
for ten rows farther outward, at which place the additional ornament 
begins. So far it is plain coiled work with split stitches; afterwards 
it becomes a mixture of plain coiled work with upright bands of 
imbrication. Its height is 13 inches, and its width at bottom is 1)^ 
inches. 

The twined baskets of Washington, with little animals around the 
margin, ])elong to the Skokomish and other Salishau tribes al)out 
Puget Sound. When the tails turn up they are dogs or wolves; when 
they turn down they are horses. Especial attention has been called 
to the varied and tasteful effects produced by the use of the rectangu- 
lar element. 

Plate 104 represents two carrying wallets of the Skokomish Indians 
living in Washington. The examples shown are done in the style of 
weaving called here "wrapped twine" (figs. 21 and 212). 

Plate 165 shows specimens of carrying baskets made l)}- Salish tribes 
in Washington; the one in the center is Tillamuk, Catalogue No. 
151149 in the U. S. National Museum, collected by Dr. Franz Boas. 
The others, Nos. 2709 and 23511, are very old specimens in the 
National Museum collection and are accredited to the Clallams. The 
upper one on the plate is credited to the Wilkes Exploring Expedi- 
tion, secured more than sixty years ago. All of these are in plain, 
twined weaving with splint of root, probably spruce, made browner 
by soaking in mud. The ornamentation is false embroidery in squaw 
grass. The three methods of forming the border are noteworthy. In 
the upper specimen stout cable is formed b}^ "sewing" a small bundle 
of root splints with the same material. This is sewed here and there 
to the upper margin of the wallet. The other figures show the margin 
finished by braiding down; the loops of root were twisted in subse- 
quently. The animals on the margin are horses. 

The specimen. Catalogue No. 23511, which is the lower one on the 
plate, was collected in Washington by James G. Swan. 

Plate 166, upper figure, is an open twined wallet of the Tillanuik 
Indians, Salishan family, the remnant of which is living at Grande 
Ronde Agency, Oregon. The bottom of this basket is rather ingenious. 
The warp splints of the sides pass across the bottom also and are held 
together there by courses of twined weaving. At the edges of the end 
portions of the ])ottom the splints of the weft or twined work become 
the warp for the l)od3'. At the upper boi'der two rows of squaw grass 
are beaded in. The braided border around the top is formed by the 
ends of the warj) spliiits plaited together in a d()ul>le row, additional 
material being used if necessary.

The lower figure i(> an open wtiUet of the Chinook Indians, Chinoolvuii 
family, oceupyinu- formerly both sides of the Columbia River from 
the mouth to The Dalles, a distanee of t^OO miles. Aceording to Lewis 
and Clark most of th(nr villages were on the northern bank. To this 
family also ])elong the Clatsops and Wascos, to be mentioned later. 
The wallet illustrated in the plate is made of root in twined weaving 
with crossed warp. The ])ottom ov foundation is a reetangidar struc- 
ture, al)out 4 inches square, made of double splints of root, securely 
lashed together backward and forward. From this central portion the 
splints spread out and the twined weaving ])egins. Additional warp 
elements are added from time to tiuie as the structure widens. A 
coarse form of ornamentation is produced by overlaying some of the 
warp elements with squaw grass. The fastening otf of the ui)per l)order 
is peculiar and on the outside imitates precisely a three-ply braid, but 
on the inside the structure is at once revealed. A strip of root is laid 
along the top of the warp elements and these are ])rought ovei' in 
buttonhole stitch and tucked ]>ehind the strip, then cut oti', making a 
a very rough appearance. It will be noticed that in the weaving of 
this wallet the half turns of the twine do not go around the crossings 
of the warp elements. ]>ut jiist below the crossings, so as to include 
(^acii Avarp separatelv. On tlie outside of the warp splints here and 
there a strip of grass is regularly overlaid. 

Catalogue Nos. 151447 and 151118 in the U. S. National ]Museum 
were collected by Dr. Franz Boas. 

The Nez Perce Indians of the Shahaptian family, i)rior to the advent 
of the whites on the Pacitic coast, made heavy and l)eautiful blankets 
of the wool of the Rocky Mounttiin sheep and of the hair of animals 
killed in the chtise, dyed in dillVrent colors. The })atterns are all 
geometric, and are, in fact, Avoven mosaics, each figure being inserted 
separately by twisting two woof threads backward and forwai'daroimd 
the warp strands. Scarcely ever does the twine extend in stripes all 
the way across the l)lanket in a direct line. 

The same Indians at present weave l)ags from the bast of the Indian 
hemp {ApocyniiDi <-(t}ui(il>! tnoii) and from grass stems siiredded. The 
ligurc^s are produced by overlaying the regular warp strands with 
corn husks or colored grass in false embroidery. In some examples 
(see fig. 161) the entire surface is covered with geometric figures; in 
others they are only partially covered. The Nez Perce are in the 
same family as the Klikitat and Yakima, l)ut they make no indjricated 
baskets. 

Fig. 161 is a twined wallet of the Nez Perces. The body weaving, 
both warp and weft, is of Indian hemp. In the process of manufac- 
ture a suificient number of warp strands were joined together in the 
middle ])y a row of twined weaving and pr()l)ably sus])ended, the ends 
hanging doAvn. The weaver tilled this warp with the ordinary twisted

work, proceeding from the ])ottom to the border. The ornamenta- 
tion, in corn husk or other weak material, in the natural color or dyed, 
is laid on externally by what is here called false embroidery. The 
process was fully descri))ed and illustrated in speaking of Tlinkit weav- 
ing (lig. 139, p. 410). This specimen should be compared with the 
making of soft wallets among the Fraser River tribes, illustrated in 
Teit's monograph, where the corn husk, instead of b(>ing wrapped 
merely around th(^ outer element of the twine, passes around both 

strands and the tigure ap- 
pears on the inside of the 
receptacle, which is not true 
of the Nez Ferce example. 
Fig. 162 will show a square 
inch of this wallet, the espe- 
cial feature of which is that 
while the rows of plain twin- 
ing seem to be vertical in 
the false embroidery, the}- 
^^^1 are inclined to the right.

The Cay use (Waiilatpuan) and Umatilla (Shahaptian) m-dko soft 
baskets in twined weaving. They are horse Indians and use their 
wallets for saddle l)ags. The matei'ial is rushes, wild hemp, corn 
husks, and worsted. The l)ottoms and undecorated portions are plain- 
twined work. In the ligured parts the 
husks, split into narrow strips, are admin- 
istered in four ways — by o\erlaying, not 
showing on the inside; b}' overlaying and 
twining so as to show on the inside; l)y 
false embroidery, wrapped about the weft 
twine elements on the outside, and by 
frapping the twined weft as in the 
Thompson River work (Mrs. jVIcArthur). 

The soft wallets illustrated in Plate 1()S, 
often called "Sall\' bags," were made 
by ^A'asco Indians, who belong to the 
Chinookan family. At present they are on the Warm Springs Reser- 
vation in Oregon, and the Yakima Reservation in Washington. The 
wallet in the middle of the plate No. 9041 was presented to the U. S. 
National Museum by Dr. James T. Ghiselin in 1869; the others were 
collected ])y Mrs. R. S. Shackelford and Miss E. T. Houtz. They are 
all made in plain twined weaving over warp of rushes, the ijatterns 
being eiiected by overlaying the twine of hemp with strips of fiber 
that in structure reseml)le corn husks. On the newer specimens the 
designs are clearly shown, representing man (tillacum), elk (mowitch), 
sturgeon (pish), duck (culla-cuUa). By o))serving the men's faces in 
the newer specimens, it will be easy to detect the idealized faces on 
the fine, old wallet in the middle. 

Prof. O. M. Dalton figures in ^^Man" (London), I, note 17, an old 
Wasco basket wallet with the image of a man in knee breeches on the 
surface. In the National Museum are a number of new wallets bear- 
ing this same figure, but the Dalton specimens show that it has been 
a motive in Wasco weaving for a long period.

in plain-twinecl weaving-. On the body of the wallets birds, beasts, and 
men are wrought in grass or husks of corn in corners. 

Clatsops make flat mats and wallets of cat-tail rush. The latter, 
wnth strap of grass and woolen to wear across the shoulders, are excel- 
lent for carrj^ing tish. The}' also construct a sack in open-twined work 
in roots. The line-twined small baskets in three colors are equal to any 
in Oregon (Mrs. McArthur). 

THE CALIFORNIA-OREGON REGION 

The human hand is so beautifully formed, it has so fine a sensibility, that sensibility governs its 
motions so eorrectly, every effort of the will is answered so instantly, as if the hand were the seat 
of that will.— Sir Charles Bell. 

The California-Oreg'on basketry region has onh' one definite ])Ound- 
ary, the hard coast of the Pacific; on other sides there is no sharp 
ethnic limit. North, east, and south, it is full of turnstiles that 
move in one direction only. Triljes from far away pushed through 
them into this region, but if they had desired to turn their backs on 
abundant game, lish, and vegetal foods, they would have been pre- 
vented by the column in the rear. 

The ancient basket makers of this area knew nearly every type and 
technical process of the art, both in weaving and coiling. They added 
at least one new technical process, the tee weave. In ornamentation, 
imbrication is wanting as well as false embroidery, but there is quite 
enough else to make up the deficiency. Within the California-Oregon 
area there are subareas, and the following list of linguistic families 
will help to unravel the tangle: 

NORTHERN GROUP 

Athapascan family: Hupa, lower Trinity River and Wailaki, western slopes of the 
Shasta Mountains. 

Chinuxrikan family: Trinity River. 

Copehan family: Wintun under many names, western drainage Sacramento River. 

Kalapooian familj': The Willamette Plains, western Oregon. 

Kulanapan family: Pomo, under many names, in Mendocino and Lake counties. 

Kusan family: Coos River and Bay, western Oregon. 

Lutuamian family: Klamath and Modoc, Upper Klamath Riveror Klamath Lake. 

Palaihnihan family: Pit Rivers; on Pit River to eastern boundary of the State. 

Pujunan family: Concow (Konkau), Maidu, Nockum (Naknm), western drainage 
of the Sacramento River, south of Palaihnihan. 

Quoratean family: Ehnek, Karok, middle Klamath River. 

Sastean family: Shastas; middle northern Ijoundar}- of State. 

Takilman family: Lower Rogue River, Oregon. 

Weitspekan family: Yurok, Weitspek, Lower Klamath River. 

Wishoskan family: Wishosk, Eel River, and Ilundjolilt Bay. 

Yanan family: Nozis, north of Pujunan. 

Yukian family; Ashochimi, Chumaya, Napa, Tatu or I'otter A'alley, Yuki or Round 
Valley, in Potter and Round valleys. «

The locution of the lino-ui.stic fiuiiilies in California is .shown on the 
map. (See tig-. 1(53.) A g-lance at the map will show how, in a general 
wa^^the State is divided into northern and southern })()rtions hyaline 
running" from San Francisco Bay to the angh^ of Nevada, and also in 
the same manner the subdivision of the northern portion of the State 
into three vertical sections. A little difference exists between the 
nomenclature of this map and that of Powell. For instance, the 
Wintun are Copehan; the Maidu are Pujunan; the Yokut on this map 
correspond to the Powell Mariposen, but in Powell's subdivision of 
tribes the Yokuts are placed in the Mo(iuehunnan family. With these 
slight aiuendments the map will l)e easily iuid(M-stood and of g-reat 
importance in locating C-alifornia basketry. It is interesting to note 
that, Avhile the Powell map was made long ago from voca))idaries only, 
the Dixon-Kroeber map is based on grammar, and yet the agreements 
are nearly complete. Especial attention is called to the ^•ast area 
occupied by the intruding Shoshonean family from the interior basin.* 

The western division of the north California arc^a, including the 
coast of Oregon as well, may be divided into three locations, contain- 
ing each different tri])es. The most northern ^voldd be Athapascan 
and adjoining families; the middh; division, those tribes associated in 
Round Valle}"; and the most southern of all, the Pomo. 

The following list of })lants carefully prepared by V. K, Chesnut, 
of the Department of Agi-icidture,'' will apply to the Hupa, the Roiuid 
Valley, and Pomo basketry: 

Acrr iiKicroplnilhnn, Pal gun sche ( Ynki), maple. The Yukis of California use the 
l)ark for their basketry. The Puget Sound Indians emjiloy it in their textiles, and 
Rothro.ck says that from the inner bark the triljesof the Pacific slope weave baskets, 
mats, and hats waterproof.

twine, ropes, and nets. 



ABORlOINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 448 

Asdepias criocarpa, Go to la (Little Lakes); Bo ko (Concow); Machal and Chaak 
( Yuki) , i)oieonous milkweed. The inner ])ark is used by the Eel River, Concow, 
Potter Valley, and Little Lake Indians for strings, nets, and other textiles. 

Bntneria occidentalism Sai ka le (Ponio), spice bush or calycanthus. Both the wood 
and the bark from fresh shoots are used in basket work. 

Care.r, Tsu wish (Pomo), blackroot sedge. Used by the Porno in their coiled 
basketry for decorating in black. 

Carex sp. The long, tough rootstocks of several and perhai)s most of the sedges 
(saw grass) in ]\Iendocino County, California, are used by the basket makers. Great 
patience is exercised in tracing these from 2 to 5 feet through sand and mud and in 
preparing the splints. The baskets made from them are called "root baskets." 
Sedge rootstocks are the most important underground matei'ial, ami the Ijaskets 
made from them are the strongest, most dural)le, and most costly. Special char- 
acteristics belong to the different species. 

Care.v hnrbarac, Dewey, Kahum, (Pomo for water-tight baskets). The rootstocks 
furnish the splints for the white or creamy groundwork of most Pomo baskets. They 
are dug out with clam shells and sticks aiding the hands and feet." One end of the 
stock is grasped l)y the first and second toes, the clam shell serves for scraping away 
the soil, and the stick for j)rying out stones and loosening the ground. A woman 
will secure 15 to 20 strands a day. They are placed in water over night to preserve 
the flexibility and to soften the scaly bark, which is removed in the morning by the 
women. The end of the stick is chewed until the bark is separated. The wood is 
then held by the teeth, the other end of tlie stock is held taut l)y the first and second 
toes, and the bark is scraped away, leaving a tough white or tan-colored strand al)out 
one-half the original thickness. These are done up in small coils and carried by the 
women to the camp. Mr. Coville draws attention to a bit of primitive agriculture in 
this connection. The Pomo women insist that the toughest and finest roots can be 
obtained only at certain spots. Unconsciously they have been making this true by 
means of their digging sticks and clam shells, during all the years loosening the 
ground and removing weeds. 

Caret; sp. , Ta tet el (Wailaki), sea grass or sedge. The njots and leaves used in 
basketry, especially for hats and cheap semiflexible baskets. 

CeanotJins iniegerrimu)<. The Concow squaws gather the young and flexible shoots 
of the California lilac, Hibi, for the warp of their baskets. 

Cenyis occidentalis. The Ijark and the wood from sprouts of the redliud, C!ha-l)a, in 
Yuki; Mula, in Little Lake; Kala-a-kala, in Yokaia; and Dop or Talk, in Concow, 
are used in finer baskets as foundation, as weft in twined ware, and as sewing 
material in coiled work. The Indians produce a variety of results in Cercis. The 
stems are sometimes cut in winter and early spring to insure material for the next 
fall. The color of the bark is then slightly red, which may be darkened by exposure 
to smoke and blackened by soaking in dirty water, in water and ashes, or in a decoc- 
tion of oak bark to which scraps of iron have been added. The bark to be used in 
sewing coiled baskets is separated Ijy steaming. In twined basketry some of the 
white wood is left adhering to the bark, in which case designs in two colors are pro- 
duced, since the willow and carex are both much darker. 

Corylus californica. The slender stems of the Hazelnut, Olmani, in Yuki; Goni he 
ni, in Concow; Ch' ki, in Wailaki; Cha-ba, in Little Lake, are commonly used in 
place of willows in Round Valley for coarse sieves and fish traps and as warp in saw- 
grass baskets. A baby-carrying basket at Ukiah was made from the same material. 
The Calapooias make the finest openwork twined basketry of hazel sticks. 
The Coos and Roque river ware resembles the Shasta, the latter produce excellent 
work in hazel stems (Mrs. McArthur). 



"J. W. Hudson, Overland Monthly, XXI, 1893, pp. 561-578. 



444 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

CoviUea iridenUda, Tah sun up (Paiutes), creosote Avood. It is one of the common- 
est industrial plants in southern California, Arizona, and southern Utah. The gum 
is used by the Apaches for cement. It is also used to produce a greenish-yellow dye. 
Owing to the odor emitted when heated, the plant is called creosote wood. 

Gymnogramma triangularis, Gold-back fern. Common on open brushy hillsides 
throughout Mendocino County. As in the case of the five-fingered fern, this plant 
grows much more thriftily near the coast. The stems are also used there in the mak- 
ing of baskets. 

Juncus effusufi Linnaeus. The stalks of wire grass. Lolum, in Yuki; Cha-ba, by 
the Potter Valley, Little Lake, and Yokaia Pomos; and Sito by the Wailaki, are 
used in Mendocino County for making temporary baskets. With them also children 
are initiated into the art of basket making, and rackets used in gathering pinole 
seed as well as fish traps are Moven. 

Lonicera interrupta, Ilai wat (Yuki), honeysuckle. The Yukis employ the 
flexible stems slightly for hoops in basket borders. 

Philadelphus gordonianus, Ka kuss (Wailaki); Slion a hi (Little Lakes); Hawn li 
(Yukis), arrow wood. A species of syringa or jnock orange. The pithy stems are 
valued on account of their lightness for the manufacture of baskets used by women 
for carrying babies. 

Pimis sahiniana, Pol cum ol (Yuki) nut <ir digger {>ine. Used for Itasketry. The 
more pliable wood from the root is the chief source of material used in making large 
V-shaped baskets, which Little Lake Indians use for carrying acorns. The root is 
warmed in hot, damp ashes, and strands are split off before cooling. They are brit- 
tle when dry, but after being soaked in water they are easily manipulated in the 
more simply woven baskets, which are made by passing the strands out and in 
through tlie numerous vertical withes that make up the skeleton. They are not 
sufficiently pliable, as sedge roots are, to be used like thread in wrapping round and 
round a horizontal withe. 

Pseudotsuga mu'cronata. The smaller roots of the Douglas spruce, Nu, in Yuki lan- 
guage, are used in fine Porno baskets. They are found in sections 8 to 10 feet long, 
uniform in thickness, and about the diameter of a lead pencil (quoting Hudson). 

Pteridiuni aguiUnum, Bis (Calpella Pomo); Bebi (Little Lakes); Sulala (Con- 
cows); Dos (Nomelakkis); Ma orda-git (Yokaias), the bracken fern. The hard 
wood is easily split into flat bands, which are sometimes used by the coast Indians 
for the black strands of their cheaper baskets. They are much less frequently used 
for this ]uirpose by the Indians of Round Valley and Ukiah. Because susceptible 
of a fine polish, they ai'e far weaker and more brittle than the saw-grass roots which 
compose the weft of their choicest baskets. The black I'olor is imparted Ijy burying 
in mud. 

Quercus loJiaia, Ky am (Yuki), white oak, acorn. The l)ark is used to a very 
slight extent by the Concows to blacken strands of the redbud for use in l)asketry. 
Eusty iron is added to the water extract of the bark to produce a black solution in 
which the strands are allowed to remain for some time. 

Plms diversiloba. For dyeing the splints with which somo Pomo baskets are sewed. 
Dr. Hudson is quoted as saying that an intense black is produced by applying to 
them the fresh juice of i^oison oak in Pomo, Matuyaho; in Wailaki, Kots ta. The 
slender stems are also worked into the foundation of coiled basketry. Phu>^ arornatica, 
says Purdy, was formerly used by tribes eastward from Ukiah, as redbud is used by 
Pomos. 

Salix argyropliylla. The white-leaved willow, Bam Kal 6, in Pomo; Kalalno, in 
Yokaia, is considered the best for coarse baskets. It is common along Russian River, 
in California. It is not found at Round Valley, so these Indians would carry back 
small supplies of the slender stems when they returned from hop picking near Ukiah. 
The roots are also highly valued in making certain baskets.

Sdrpvf! sp. The most, valuable of the sedges for basket splints in Mendotdno 
County is an unidentified species of the bulrush, Sclrpux sp., Tsuwish, in Porno. It 
is an article of commerce. Being rare near Ukiah, it is purchased at a cent a root 
from plants collected l)y Clear Lake Indians and in parts of Sonoma County or along 
the seacoast. The rootstoc-ks, about one-fourth of an inch in diaincter, cdusist of 
three distinct tissues — the outer, brown, like parchment; the middle; and the heart, 
a tough, woody structure. The outer surface of this woody tissue, wiiich makes up 
the great l)nlk of tlie l)lack fiber in the finest Pomo baskets, is slightly ribl)ed and 
varies from light l)rown to nearly jet-black. The interifir is more or less white. 
Some of the dark splints are used just as they are, while others are blackened with 
the juice of poison oak, Bliiis direri^Uoba, or by burying them with charcoal, ashes, 
and earth for about eighty hours. 

A detailed account of the manipulation of tliese rootstocks at Round Valley is 
given." 

Smilax califnrniai Gray, the only species of smilax in C-alifornia, does not occur in 
INIendocino County, but is cf)mmon along the headwaters of the ITpp(>r Sacramento. 
The fine, long trailing liml)S are exceedingly strong and are used to some extent in 
Round Valley and perhaps at Ukiah for basket making. The Indians say that the 
strands have a l)rownisli-black color. 

Tumiun cn/ifornicuni. Splints from tiie roots of tlie C'alif(jrnia mitmeg, Kalic in 
the Yokaia language and Ko^-bi in Pomo, are said to be used li}' the Ponio in some 
of their tine baskets.

damp places to a height of 30 feet or more. The smaller, woody parts of the vine 
are extremely flexil)le and are very consideral)ly used l)y the tribes for the rims of 
their large, cone-carrying baskets. It is gathered at almost any time, soaked in 
water and hot ashes, after which the Ijark is removed and the wood split into a 
couple of strands, which, although very coarse, are used sul)stantially as tlii'ead. 
The tribes of Cahfornia make ropus and various houseliold aT'ticles from the vine. 

As a conncctino- link botween the >Salisli and otlior ba.sketry iiortli of 
the Khiniath River and the true California types there is h(M-e shown 
the tigure of an ohl piece of basketry l^rought from Oreo'oii n^ore than 
sixty years agx) (tig. 164). It is the ordinary coiled weave of the 
West Coast, covered with red and white feathers. The feathers are 
caught by their stems under the stitches as the work progresses, just 
as in tlie Pomo and other California tribes of to-day. Jt is interesting 
to find this t^^pe of work so far north. It points to the fact that 
many of the gaps which occur in this study. coidd have been easily 
tilled when the Indians were in their native situations. Holmes has 
other tigures in the same type of Ijasketry, only the f(>ather work is 
coml)ined with the ornamentation in the weaving on the surface. 
Attention is called again to the fact that the imbricated ware stopped 
short at the ColumlMa River. The plaits of grass or bark overlie one 
another just as feathers do in the feather work, and the stem of the 
feather is doubled under the stitches in the same way. To be espe- 
cially noted are the groups of ^-ertical stripes on the margin and the 
chevroned design at the bottom. Whether there was genetic relation-

log'ue No. 2138 in the U. S. National Museum, w^as collected b}^ 
Dr. .1. L. Fox, U. S. Navy, of the Wilkes Exploring- Expedition. 

The Pacilic slope branch of the Athapascan family is found in the 
northwestern corner of California and far northward into Oregon. 
On the Hupa Reservation were placed, in 1864, a number of bands 
scattered around Trinity River, the names of which ma}" be found in 
the Smithsonian Repoi-t for 1SS6, Part 1. As late as 1850 the Hupa 
are said to have lived in pristine simplicity. Autumn supplied the 
all-important acorn, large quantities of which were collected and kept 
in store for use during the winter and spring. The vegetable food is 
gathered chiefly by the women. The outfit of the primitive gleaner, 
miller, and cook was chiefly in basket work. While no edible root or 
food was despised, the oak furnished the chief l)readstufi^. The acorns 
were gathered in an osier hamper about 16 inches high and 20 inches

in diameter, made in twined weaving. It was used l)y the women in 
carrying loads, supported by a band across the forehead. Filled with 
acorns, this hamper was placed on the back and held in position by 
means of a carrying pad consisting of a disk of mat 5 b}^ 4 inches. 
About the middle of Octol)er the Indians beat the acorns from the 
trees with long poles and carry them home in these baskets. The 
squaws remove the hull by giving it a slight tap with a pestle. The 
nuts were then dried and beaten to powder in a mill with a basket 
hopper. The flour was soaked in a hollow scooped in the sand and 
cooked into a kind of mush in baskets by means of hot stones and 
were baked into l^read in an underground oven. 

If the harvest were of seeds instead of acorns, they were winnowed 
in another basket of close-twined weaving which the good woman 
had not failed to decorate with graceful patterns, following that 
unconquerable artistic instinct which is the heritage of all the peoples 
who breathe the air of the Pacific Ocean. Under the heading of

Dr. W . L. .Icpson lias doterniined for Dr. V. E. (to<1(1:ii-(1 the mate- 
rials used by Ilvipa in baskets. The burden l)asket, the baby basket, 
and the salmon plate are made entirely of the shoots of ( 'oi'ijl nx was-- 
tnifit var. cal !f(>rii!ca. Hupa name is nnlk-kai-kit-loi. These shoots 
form foundation or warp of all other baskets except tlie finest hats and 
the covered bottles. For these shoots of willow ar(» us(m1. of which 
S'(fh'.i: sessUifoIld and aV. fiuvlatU'i x var. argijroplnjihi are indicated. 
These willows are not connnon in Hupa Valley. The warp stems 
while slimmer than those from the hazel, arc said not to be so durable. 
They are fastened at the origin of the basket and at the ))eginning' of 
the bodv by rounds twined with the root of certain deciduous trees. 
This material is called indiscriminately " kut." The roots of the more 
common willow as well as the two mentioned are used besides the root 
of AlnnH oregaiKi, Vlfis c<dlfonh!ca and Populns trlcJiocarpd. The 
principal weft of all close-woven baskets is composed of the root of 
Coniferse. Of the trees o-rowino" in or near Hupa the roots of P'tntis 
ponderosa, P. .'«ihi)ilana^ and P. honhertkoia are used. The selection 
of the species and of the individual trees depends on their readiness to 
split properh'. These roots are roasted in the ground. Resides these 
the Hupa import from the coast, material from Stqiioia xem/pervirenn 
and Plcea s/fchmsi!^. These root materials are called '' xai." The 
root of the wild grape, V!tts cKliforrilcd^ is used in place of the con- 
iferii? roots in tine hats for the woof. For decorative work the leaves 
of XcropJii/lfnni tevd.i' serve for white, and the bark of the stems of 
Adianiuia pcddfinii for black. A reddish brown is obtained ])y d,ye- 
ing the inner part of the stem of Woodirord/a radicam^ with the bark 
of Ahiiis oregiiJKi. The primitive method of dyeing was to chew the 
bai-k and draw the splint through the mouth just ))eforc introducing 
it into the woof. The alder dye is now sometimes applied b}^ steeping 
in a dish but the results are said to be not so certain. Yellow is 
obtained by dipping the leaves of XeroplujUHiii, femi.r, into a decoction 
of Ercritla riiJphia. The setting of this dye is difficult and many 
women do not use the yellow in basket making. Porcupine quills are 
dyed with this lichen giving a brighter effect. Their use is not com- 
mon. A few women are now employing the ""Oregon grape'' for 
dyeing the xerophyllum leaves. Baskets are sometimes collected for 
Hupa work which are made by the Tolowa in Del Norte County. 
These have a steel-gray color obtained by dyeing the root of the tide- 
land spruce with rusty iron. The root and iron are buried in the 
damp ground for some time.''

448 REPORT OF NATIOISTAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

Plate 170 represents three granary baskets of the Hupa Indians in 
the Harve}" collection. The figure shown on the right is used as a 
cover for the granar}-. These baskets furnish excellent examples of 
form and decoration, as well as technical processes, among this Atha- 
pascan group. It has been mentioned before that we have here an 
example of acculturation through women of an art created b}^ the 
conservative sex. If a number of Hupa men of Athapascan stock 
broke into this area and took to themselves wives of the country the 
weaving processes would not be changed, so that in an}^ one of these 
baskets will l)e found, beginning at the bottom, three-strand twined 
weaving; above that two-strand plain-twined weaving, and over the 
surface decoration in overlaying. On the granary baskets the trian- 
gular and rectangular elementary forms are worked into vertical 
stripes, the basis of which is the bent line, or zigzag, forming the 
ornamentation, the leaves of grass alternate with the foundation color 
by laying a strip of the former on the latter and exposing it or turn- 
ing it under at will. Dr. Goddard, in his paper published by the 
University of California, gives the following symbolism: 

The isosceles triangle the Hupa calls "rattlesnake's nose" (Luwminchwuw); 
right-angled triangles made with a hoi-izontal line meeting a vertical line are called 
"sharp and slanting" (chesLinalwiltchwel). Oblique-angled parallelograms are 
very frequently used. The name given them is "set on to^i of one another" (niLkut- 
dasaan). Another design, which lacks beauty on account of its jagged appearance, 
is called "grizzly bear his hand" (mikyowe mila). Another figure is called "frog 
his hand" (tewal mila). A third design has angles projecting upward with the 
vertical lines on the outside of the figure and the oblique lines sloping inward and 
downward. This jjattern is called "swallow's tail" (teschechmikye) or "points 
sticking up" (chaxcheuiieL). 

When the isosceles triangles (called Luwminchwuw) are grouped one above 
another they are called Luwminchwuw nikutdasaan ("snake's nose piled up"). 
When these figures come back to back so as to form diamonds alternating with tlie 
background they are called Lokyomenkonte ( "sturgeon's back" ). When the figure 
apex is superimposed on a trapezoid the name cha is given to the design. These 
figures are nearly always so connected as to encircle the basket, when the name 
LenaLdauw is given to it, signifying "it encircles." A design which seems to be 
the trajjezoids superimposed is called LekyuwineL ("they come together"). The 
conception of the design seems to be that of the second variety of triangles back to 
back. A series of rectangular parallelograms superimposed so that each higher 
one projects to the right of the one below it, the whole being bordered by a double 
line conforming to the outline, is called kowitselminat ("worm goes round" or 
"worm's stairway"). The oblique-angled parallelograms in pairs, with the upper 
one at the right, are the designs most frequently found on the hats. They are found 
in series on the storage baskets (djelo). Usually even numbers are emi:)loyed, jjre- 
serving the symmetry of the zone. Designs in red often have horizontal lines in 
black. Oblique lines in white often run across the design. When such lines run 
through the oblique-angled parallelogram they are called niLkutdasaan mikiteweso 
( ' ' one-on-the-other its scratches " ) .

northern California, wearing one of the beautiful twined basket hats,

SO called among- this tribe. She also has about her, as a o-annent, a 
deerskin decorated with long fringes of false l)raided work in straw, 
the work done in a single strand. This photograph was taken l)y 
Governor John Daggett, of Black Bear, California. 

Plate 172 is a portrait of Mary or Sheretta, a Klamath Indian 
woman, using different forms of basketry in the milling and cooking- 
industry. Acorns are picked in a gathering basket, brought home in a 
carrying basket, ground in a mill with a basket hopper, the bitterness 
leeched out of the acorn mill hxed in a l)ed of sand, dipped with a 
basket ladle into a basket where it is cooked 1)y means of hot stones, 
and afterwards served in dishes of basketry. This was also photo- 
graphed ])y Cxovernor Daggett. 

The lower iigure is a Wintun woman on McCloud River, in northern 
California, making a basket. The utter wretchedness and lack of 
inspiration from the environment could not possibly l)e worse. The 
Wintuns belong to the Copehan family. 

From Governor Daggett comes the information that the California 
Indians about him make the frame of the coiled baskets of hazel twigs 
skinned. The weaving is done with split ]iine root. The ornamental 
patterns are produced by sour grass and maidenhair fern. The white 
splint is dj^ed by being chewed in the woman's mouth together with 
alder bark, making a kind of animated vat of herself. For the conical

South of the Hupa Indians is the liound Valley Reservation with 
the following-named tribes: Concow (Pujunan); Little Lakes (Kula- 
napan); Redwoods and Yukies (Yukian); Wailakis (Athapascan); Pit 
Rivers (Palaihnahan), and the Nomelakis (Copehan or Wintun fam- 
ily). A moment's thought will show why it is that varieties in basket 
types come from this reservation. The Indian tribes of the neighbor- 
hood arc mixed with those of the Sacramento Valley and Maidu or 
Pujunan people east of the Sierras. With biological mixture there 
has been corresponding fei'tilization of ideas. 

N. J. Purcell, for a long time agent among the Round Valley 
Indians, describes the gathering basket as coarse meshed and I'oughly 
constructed. He has sent to the National Museum an example made by 
the Little Lake tribe. It is woven of sticks with the bark on, and is 
very quickly made. It has a Inickskin string- attached al)out the center, 
by which it is carried. It is used for gathering- acorns, nuts, grain, 
etc. When filled, this basket is emptied into a large carrying basket, 
this being repeated until the larger basket is tilled. 

The large carrying l)asket is alwa3^s put in some convenient place

450 EEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

and a smaller one is used for picking of nuts or grain. Several of the 
other tribes there use the same basket, though it seems to have orig- 
inated among the Little Lake Indians. The willow of which it is com- 
posed is of the ordinary kind which is seen along nearly all the creeks 
in the East and is equally as plentiful here. 

The sticks are generally used while green, though the}' are fre- 
quently gathered in quantities, allowed to dry. then soaked in water 
as the}' are re(]uired for use. 

The carrying sack is made like an ordinary hunting bag and about 
the size. It is manufactured 1)}^ the Concow Indians only. The buck- 
skin string attached is thrown across the shoulder, allowing the sack 
to swing by the side, as we carrv the hunting bag. The material of 
which it is made is from a weed-like plant that grows from 3 to 5 
feet high, found in but one place in this country. At the foot of the 
Black Butte, about T,0(»0 feet alcove sea level, it grows in great quan- 
tities. This plant, bo-coak, ))ears a large white tiower, which is filled 
with seed and has quit(; an agreeable odor. The heaves are large and 
long, tapering at the points. In winter the stalks die and become 
hard and dry, and are gathered in great ([uantities b}' the Indians. 
The l)ark is carefully taken off and the material from which the twine 
is made is stripped from the inside of the bark. This flax-like material 
is as white as cotton and seems nuich superior in strength. In mak- 
ing his twine the Indian seats himself, after first removing his trousers, 
takes enough of this flax to twist into about the size of No. 10 cotton 
in his left hand, lays it across the fleshy part of his right leg, licks the 
palm of his right hand, places it upon the flax and twists it. In this 
way they make twine of all sizes, from that of the coarse sewing 
thread to that of a half-inch rope. 

In early times all the sewing they did was with this thread, using a 
sharpened bone for a needle. The larger size twine was for making 
fish nets, bird nets, carrying sacks, snaring deer, etc. 

The mortar basket is used for pounding acorns, grain, all kinds of 
nuts and seeds. It is made of tough roots of the fir, which are usually 
gathered in spring or winter, when the ground is soft. Koots of the 
small saplings are preferred, being tougher than those of the old tree. 
The size of the roots gathered varies from one-half to li inches. 
These are now buried under hot ashes and are allowed to remain thus 
for an hour. They are then taken out, not burned, but very hot. 
This steaming process toughens them and makes them split more 
easily, besides seasoning them to some extent. The squaw now takes 
this hot root in both hands, seizes it near the end with her front teeth, 
throws her head back and her hands forward, and the root is split 
exactly in the center in less than half a minute. 

The two halves are again split in like manner and so on until the 
pieces become about twice as large as required. The craftswoman is 



ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY, 451 

now more careful, and the last piece is sometimes started with a 
sharp rock or knife, but usually with the teeth. One end of the splint 
is caught in the rio^ht hand, the other being kept between the teeth. 
The thumb and foretinger of the left hand are clinched tightly on the 
stick below the mouth. The head and right hand are now pulled 
slowly from each other. As the operation proceeds the linger and 
thumb of the left hand are slowly slipped down in front of the split 
part. Thus this last piece is divided accurately in the middle. The 
splints are not used at once, but are tied up in large circular coils and 
allowed to season, which, however, does not take long, as they are 
thin and the heating process aids in seasoning them very quickly. 
Being now prepared to make a basket, the woman uncoils the splints 
and throws them into a pan or basket of water, which renders them 
pliable and easy to be worked. The ribs of the basket are willow 
switches with the bark scra])ed off. In beginning the basket two of 
tho splints are taken from the water and attached to one of the rit)s 
with a kind of wrapped knot, so fastened as to allow one splint to 
stand toward the weaver and one directly from her. Another rib is 
now set close to the rirst one, and the splints are reversed; that is, the 
outside is pulled toward the weaver and the inside one is put from 
her; this forms a half turn around each side of a rib, the splints 
crossing or twining between the ribs. The same weave is used in the 
construction of the whole basket. Around the extreme top of this 
basket is a half-inch stick usually wrapped or stitched on with small 
vines split in the center. The dark red material used occasionally in 
this l)asket {Cercls occidental Is) is found in the mountains and is an 
undergrowth never attaining a size larger than one's ankle. The 
Indians call it "mo-lay.'' It bears a red lilossom and small slender 
switches grow up at the bottom of the larger bush which are of a 
dark red color. These are split open in the middle in the same way 
as the tir root, save that they are not heated. The stitches represent 
half the size of the stick, as it is split only once. The wood with 
bark otf is snow white. 

Mr. Purcell, in describing a pretty little l)asketof grass root covered 
with red feathers, made l)y the Little Lake Indians, sa3^s every mother 
in this tribe presents one of these baskets to her child when it is about 
7 years of age with the admonition to take care of the gift. They 
have a superstition that if the basket is lost some evil will befall the 
child. It is impossible to obtain one of these from the Little Lakes, 
the specimen described having been secured in the Concow tribe. 

Under the name of Pomo are included a great num))er of tribes or 
little l)ands, thirty, according to Hudson, Purdy, and Wilcomb — 
sometimes one in a valley, sometimes more — clustered in the region 
where the headwaters of the Eel and Russian rivers interlace, along 
the latter and around the estuaries of the coast. In disposition the

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 



Pomo arc quite different from the Yuki and their congeners, being 
simple, friendly, peaceable, and inoffensive. They are also much less 
cunning- and avaricious and less quickh' imitative of the whites than 
the lively tribes on the Klamath, to whom they are inferior in intel- 
lect. As to their ph3^sique, there prevails on the Russian River 
essentially the same t3qDes as that seen in the Sacramento Valley. 
When first occupied by the European, the valleys inhabited by the 
Pomo teemed with wild g-rasses and the streams were hedged in with 
carex and willow. The native grasses have almost disappeared, while 
the carices have given place in the lowlands to hops and alfalfa. 
Man}" ranchers forbid an Indian to dig on their lands, thus limiting 
the weaving-material supph' to outl3nng can3^ons or compelling a sub- 
stitution of inferior material. Sometimes an indifferent worker will 
use but one character of material in a })asket; for instance, the redl)ud 
shoots for warp and the two contrasting sides of the cortex for pat- 
tern. This method, called l)i-to'-i, effects looseness of weft and warp, 
incongruity of colors, and instability of the vessel, and is strongl}" 
condemned by an expert. Some weavers will conscientioush' refuse 
to work rather than substitute liai (woody material) for ma-3'em' 
(roots). The following notes by ,1. W. Hudson accompanied his col-

Plate 173 illustrates a coiled basket of the Ponio Indians left unfin- 
ished to show the workmanship. The foundation is in the style called 
Tee weaving, twined work, described and illustrated on page 239 and 
in fig-. 27. These structural features are clearl}^ set forth in the plate. 
In the foreground the vertical and the horizontal warp, as well as the 
twined weft, appear in their true association. The bod}' sewing is 
done with white splints of mu le or redbud {Cerels occulentalls); the 
figures, representing mountains, are wrought with brown splints of 
cercis. It is 10 inches in diameter, collected b}^ Dr. J. W. Hudson, 
and is Catalogue No. 200013 in the U. S. National Museum. 

In feather work, each feather is plucked from the prepared skin of 
the bird and neatly caught under a stitch, which is then drawn tight. 
They are used either to heighten the color without aiding the design 
or the design is in the feathers and not in the stitches. For the former 
quail plumes and the red feathers from the woodpecker's head are 
employed. The red feathers are placed regularly but thinly on the 
stitches of the upper half of the basket and the quail plumes scattered, 
or below three rows of shell disks (kaia) on the upper edge of the 
basket. In the feather basket proper there are two varieties called 
'"tapica" and '"'epica.'"' The tapica is the so-called sun basket; but 
Purdy insists that the word means "red basket."" The oldest speci- 
mens are saucer-shaped baskets, covered with red feathers, decorated 
with pendants of kaia and abalone, with circles of shell money. The 
use of other feathers tharf red is a charming innovation. The Ballo 
kai Pomo name for feather baskets in any other shape is "epica.'' 
When the Pomo use shell disks (kaia) to decorate coiled basketry, a 
thread is carried along under the stitches and the disks threaded on as 
needed. Beads are usually applied in the same way, but in some 
examples the}" are threaded on the sewing filaments. (Carl Purdy.) 

There is no more interesting group of Indians in America than the 
Pomo with respect to the variety of technical processes in basketry. 
They not only understand many of the processes common among 
other tribes, but have introduced one or two types of manipulation 
peculiar to themselves. The following classification, prepared by 
J. W. Hudson and Carl Purdy, shows the variety of basket work 
made l)y them: 

TWINED WOKK (tSHAMA) 

.1. Pshukan (Shakan, Purdy), coarse twined work of shuba or hazel. 

2. Pshutsin, wrapped weft, happily called backstitching by Hudson. 

3. Bam tush, plain twined weaving. 

4. Shuset, twine over two warp rods, diagonal. 

5. Sheetsin, three-strand braid or twine. 

6. Lit, Makah style, wrapped weft twined (figs. 20, 21). 

7. Tee, twined weaving over lattice foundation. 



ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY^ 455 

COILED WOKK (sTIIHU) 

8. Shailo, foundation of .splints (Sliailo, rurdy). 

9. Tsai, foundation of one rod. 

10. Bauniko, two-stem foundation laid vertically. 

11. Bamshibu, foundation of 3 rods. 

12. Bamteek, four-stem foundation. 

i;>. Tsawam, the half-hiteh work on cradles. 

Purdy adds rinj>-ed and sewed; each circle of foundation coni[)lete. 
These names are from Yokaia, Upper Yoksiia, Calpella, and Potter 
Valley. The word for basket in Potter is Pika; :it Upper Lake, Sitol; 
at Lower Lake, Kolob; at Cache Creek, Kawah. 

1. Pshu-kan' (fish weir) in its simplest form is the binding of a row 
of uprig-ht warp rods b}' means of pairs of hazel or willow shoots pass- 
ing them horizontally with a half tw^ist in each space. Undressed 
material is the rule, but in more delicate household vessels the willow 
is decorticated, even polished. Hazel (Shu ba, the fisherman) was the 
original material. It is nothing more than a very coarse oi)en twined 
work, passing now and then into three-strand twine. (See fig. 20.) 

2. Pshutsin, a very substantial means of framing a large, heavy 
structure, such as granaries, sheathing for thatch, game fences, etc. 
It is in efiect wrapped twined weaving, seen also in Mohave ctirrying 
frames. From the periphery a strand of grapevine loosely encircles 
two ribs, passing to the left over four ribs, then backward, catching- 
two or more and repeating gradually, ])ack two, forward four, inward 
to the center or apex. A second vine catches a rib at the bottom of 
the roof passiug to the left over four ribs, encircling two, thence zig- 
zags parallel with No. 1 to the top. This is repeated till s])aces are 
covered. Pshutsin efi'ects in house building a coarse mesh at the 
foundation, but gradually closed in at the apex, where most ueeded. 
In granaries the conditions are reversed, but the effect is the same. 
Fences require an additional top vine. (See fig. 13.) 

3. Bamtush (Bamtu, grapevine) plain twined weaving. Pattern 
and {esthetic art w^ere here born, the brown bark of the vine contrast- 
ing with pale yellow of the inner vine splittings. The grape has long 
since been discarded for stronger and more polished material. Bam- 
tush is the strongest weave and is used in carrying baskets, acorn bas- 
kets, and very large, heavy nmsh l)askets. There is a warp of willow 
or other stems radiating from the bottonh On this the warp is laid 
in pairs, the two splints being twisted a half time in passing a warp 
steuL The effect is that of ribbed cloth or corduroy. The ornamen- 
tation is usuall}" in bands. (See fig. 15.) 

4. Shuset is twining over two warps and alternating from round to 
round and affords the amplest opportunity for artistic display. It is 
called diagonal or twilled-twined work, as its surface is the smoothest 



456 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

of Porno weaves; the patterns arc bold and clear and cover the whole 
area. It is the only weave whose pattern is not woven through. 
It has also the mode of delicate striicture. It is used in large acorn 
baskets, also in mush baskets, being strong, smooth, and moderately 
close. Some fine gift baskets are also in this weave, and it seems to 
be susceptible of much more elaborate ornamentation than the plain 
twined work. The word Shuset, says Hudson, is understood only as 
far south as Ukiah City, the Yokaia term for diagonal twine being 
Bam tsai. (See fig. 20.) 

5. Sheetsin is a style of three-strand twined weaving in which at 
each third of a turn one weft filament is carried behind a warp stem. 
It will be seen at once that when the bundle of weft filaments has 
made a whole revolution, each one of them will have been carried 
behind the warp. On the inside this basketry does not difier in 
appearance from common twined weaving, but on the outside each 
weft element passes over three warp stems and under one. 

There is a peculiar tj'pe of Sheetsin used chiefly to start the foun- 
dations of twined baskets. It is a three-strand weft in which a braid 
is formed instead of a twine, one of its elements passing over each 
warp, the other two remaining outside. On the inside the efl^ect is of 
plain twined weaving, while on the outside the effect is diagonal. 
(See fig. 28.) 

6. Lit is a style of twined weaving in which one of the elements 
remains on the inside of the basket and the other is wrapped around 
the checks foimed by the crossing of this horizontal element with the 
vertical warps. The Makah Indians, of Cape Flatterv, employ this 
technic almost exclusively, but Hudson says the Kulanapan tribes used 
it only to give variety to a surface in which plain twine and Shuset 
are used. On the same authority", this word Lit is known among all 
the Pomo tribes, even among the Tsawalu Pomo, near Guernerville. 
(See figs. 21, 22.) 

7. Tee (intricate) is a double structure, a Bamtush reinforced by 
horizontal warp across the outside of the vertical. On the inside this 
ware is undistinguishable from plain twined work. Its characteristics 
are great strength, the closest mesh, and a pattern dim and impres- 
sional. It is the most difficult and highest priced of the Tshama 
weaves. The openwork basket trays in tee weave are called by Dr. 
Hudson psher kom, or fish plate. (See fig. 27.) 

The name Shi bu, or Tschibu, applies, says Purd}^, in reality to 
only the three-stick coiled baskets. The full name is Bam shi bu, or 
Bamsibu, sticks three. No branch of the Pomo use it except for three- 
stick baskets and only the Calpella, Kalshe, and Ballo bai Pomo use it 
at all as a basket name. One-stick baskets in Calpella, Kalshe, and 
Ballo bai Pomo are bam cha, stick one, or tishais. The filaments of 
Pomo Shibu coiled basketry are shaved down to uniform width and 
thickness with the greatest care. 



ABOKIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 457 

8. Shailo, suggested by the spinil rib of Tee, was constructed of a 
spiral coil of tir-root fibers ])ound to its adjacent coil t)clow by a single 
strand of the same material catching in the lower coil fibers or the 
tops of its lacings. This method, the Protean Shibu, developed and 
considered by other California Indians, notably Yokut, as the acme 
of art, has long since been discarded by the Pomo as inadequate to the 
demands of even close weaving and pattern. However, it proved the 
coil to be practicable and from it evolved Tsai. 

9. In the Tsai (bam-cha, one rib) or single-rod coiled basketry the 
foundation is a single willow shoot of uniform thickness throughout, 
seasoned and smoothed, spiraling from base to rim and sewed down 
with narrow splints of various materials. Two rods are inclosed in 
each stitch which passes beneath the ril) of the previous turn, the 
stitches interlocking. This structure is quite light and elegant, per- 
mitting the most delicate treatment, both in stitch and pattern. Speci- 
mens frequently average 60 stitches to the linear inch. (See fig. 40.) 

10. Baumko is the Pomo name for coiled basketry on a foundation 
of two stems, one a])Ove the other. It is an economical method of 
work, for it widens the coil and to that extent diminishes the amount 
of sewing. (See fig. 47.) 

11. Bamshibu or bamtsuwu (tsu-ba, three) consists of a three-rod 
warp or coil bound down l)y its lacings, catching in the lacings and 
one stem of the next lower coil. This is justly regarded by the Pomo 
as the highest type of basket art. Its materials require the most care- 
ful tests of evenness, pliability, and color. The legitimate function of 
treble ribs besides solidity is its adaptabilitv for retaining the bulbs 
of feathers, and was doubtless created by an incentive for this rich 
ornamentation. Comparison with other styles of work reveals the 
fact that by reason of fine material and pressing together of the stitches 
the sewing conceals the foundation, while in the varieties before 
mentioned the latter is visible l)etween the stitches. (See fig. 50.) 

13. Bamteck is scarcely to be looked upon as a separate style of 
weaving. It is simply a variety of No. 11. The manipulation of the 
stitches is precisely the same in both. 

13. Tsawam. This is an application of the backward and forward 
braiding or false braiding found on the margins of many baskets and 
descri))ed in the proper place in this work. The rods of the cradle 
are held together by a coarse cotton string obtained from the traders, 
formerly, no doubt, made of splint. Carried across the Avarp rods the 
weft material passes forward four, l)ackward two, light; forward 
four, backward two, left — and so, alternately backward to the right 
or left, forms a ver}^ neat braid on one side of the basket, and what 
looks like two rows of twined weaving on the other. 

Th(^ making of a fine coiled basket requires an infinite amount of 
patience. The rootstocks carefully gathered during the summer and 



458 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 



early autumn are split into fine strands for direct use. At Round 
Valley the process is as follows: The rootstocks, denuded of their outer 
coverings, are thoroughly soaked in warm water, and one end of a root 
is divided through the center, by means of the finger nails, into three 
parts. One of these parts is held firmly between the teeth, while, by 
means of the fingers, the whole root is carefully and very evenh^ split 
into three sections. Each of these sections is again separated into 
three parts in the same manner, and the same process is carried out 
until the strands are as fine as may be desired, the value of the basket

depending in great measure upon the fineness of the strands used as 
well as the general beauty of the finished faljric. These strands are 
used not like those from the pine root in twined work, but for thread 
for sewing coiled ware. In beginning the basket, three very pliant 
stems are so selected that when placed together their combined cross 
sections will be nearly circular. The use of three "sticks" instead of 
one, as is sometimes the case in less costly baskets, gives much more 
elasticity and greater strength to the basket. The strand is wrapped 
tightly about one end of the compound withe, and as the wrapping

progresses, the wand is bent into a minute circle; the central hole is 
filled in by stitching over and over again, and with this as a basis the 
little plaque is gradually built up by coiling. The general shape and 
plan of the basket must necessarily be carried in mind, for there is no 
skeleton to serve as a guide. Infinite care must therefore be exer- 
cised, not onl}" in preserving the symmetry of shape, but also the 
symmetry of the designs which are worked in with the black and white 
strands. It requires many months, sometimes years, of leisure work 
to complete a first-class basket. Some of the ver}^ best are more or 
less individual in their shape and pattern. (Chesnut.)

Fig. 165 is a coiled basket of the Ponio Indians (Kulanapan family) 
in a style of sewing called Bamshibu. The foundation consists of 
three stems or rods. The stitches pass over the foundation and inter- 
lock with those underneath, giving a ribbed appearance to the fabric. 
This tiny object is a little over one-half an inch in diameter and passes 
easily through a lady's finger ring. In the foundation, the uniform 
width of the coil and of the stitches, and the neatness of the sewing, 
it would be difhcult to find a more charming piece of Indian handi- 
work.

stitches passing l)oth over the rod of the course in progress and under 
the rod of the foundation of the course beneath. These small pieces 
represent fairly the best Pomo workmanship. 

These two baskets are in the collection of C. P. Wilcomb, curator 
of the Golden (late Park Museum, San Francisco, California, and were 
made under his supervision. 

Fig. 107 is a coiled basket of the Hoochnom Indians, Yukian fam- 
ily. It is made in a style of coiled weaving called rod and welt. In 
this method one or two small rods or stems of uniform thickness con- 
stitute the bod}" or foundation of the coil. Over this is laid a thin 
tilament or strip of material, and the stitches of each coil pass over 
the foundation, under the splint, and interlock. The work of the 
Hoochnom Indians is of excellent character, the coils about the same 
width of the number of stitches to the inch, uniform. In the example

here shown the coils are one-eij^hth of an inch in diameter, and there 
are twenty stitches to tlie inch. The ornamentation appears to be the 
usual California combination of mountain and coil plume. The use of 
light and dark tilaments and the alternation of triangles and rectangles 
on the two sides of the open space form a ver}- attractive ornament. 
The use of shell disks improves the appearance of the object. Feathers 

are also employed on some speci- 
mens from this locality.

Plate IT-i represents two Klamath Indian baskets in the collection 
of Dr. C. Hart Merriam. The interesting feature in them is that the 
entire structure is in three-strand twined work. The border reseml)les 
closely one of the simplest among- the Tlinkits, namely, the warp 
strands are turned down and held in place by a row of twined weaving. 
All the Indians of this area practice the three-strand work, but do 

not cover the whole basket with it. 
This weave is reserved for strength- 
ening weak places and for ornament. 
It has the disadvantage of being 
wasteful of material. 

South of the Klamath and Modoc 
tribes and closely associated with 
them live the Shasta Indians (Sastean 
family, formerly on the Klamath 
River from Bogus Creek to Scott 
River; on the Shasta River, Little 
Shasta and Yuka Creek; and in Scott 
Valley, to which has been added the 
LTpper Salmon and a part of Rogue 
River in Oregon). Stephen Powers 
commends the strength and beauty of the Shasta women. With their 
basket hats fitting tight on their round heads and walking with a 
grenadier stride, they present quite an Amazonian appearance." The 
specimens of Shasta Indian baskets in the U. S. National Museum are 
not to be distinguished fundamentally from those just described. 
They are in twined weaving with overlaying in straw. Their special 
marks are in the designs or symbols.* 

Plate 175, top figure, represents a twined basket of the Pit River 
Indians, Copehan family, in Shasta Count}^ California. In Dixon's 
paper precisely the same symbols are seen on a basket labeled Yanan 
(Plate 25). The warp and weft on the bottom are of some kind of rush. 
The weft on the body is in stems of the squaw grass. There are 
twelve twists and twenty rows of twined weaving to the inch. The 
color of the bod}^ is a beautiful old gold produced l)}- age. The orna- 
mentation is in three sets of three rhombs, each done in black material, 
perhaps fern stems. Crosses and diamond patterns are employed to

and peeled. Charming effects are jiroduced in the seasoning of the wood. Rarely 
stems dyed black by soaking them in mud are used in weaving. Besides the old- 
time plaques, baby frames, and conical burden baskets, the latest willow ware is 
being freely imitated in hazel for all domestic and industrial uses. — Mks. Hakriet

The ornamentation consists of four rows of double rhomljs in l)lack

Fig. Ill is a carrying basket of the McCloud River Indians, Copehan 
family. The tribes of this family are described bv Powers under the 
general name of Wintun. Those living on the McCloud Fork are 
named Wiunimin, the meaning- of which term is North River. The 
similarity of the McCloud River basketrv with that of the Pit River 
people will be apparent. The technic, poorly shown, is in twined 
weaving with a foundation of stems. The noticeable feature is the 
overlaying of the filaments with grass stems or fern stems to produce 
the ornamentation. The strength of the basket is in the weaving. 
The bottom is cup-shaped, and for 3 or 4 inches is in three-strand 
twined wea^'ing. The rest of the workmanship is in the ordinary 
two-strand twine. In order to strengthen the basket a coil of rods is 
sewed around the l)ottom for about a foot. The l)order is a strong- 
hoop attached to the w^arp stems by bending down the latter and 
sewing them in place with splints, forming a single row of coiled 
work. The overlaying passes to the inside, so that the figures are 
the same without and within the })asket. On the body the rhomboid 
figures forming triangular ornaments are named in Mr. Dixon's paper 
''leaves strung along-."

foi-nia. They belong to the Palaihnihan family, which Mr. Gatschet

places the basketrj' of these tribes in his northeastern group of Cali-

Shastas (Sastean, but probabh' Palaihnihan), Pit Rivers (Palaihnihan), 
Yana (Yanan), Wintun (Copehan), and Maidu (Pujunan). Powers^'

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 465 

The eastern portion of northern C-alifornia, as before mentioned, is 
laro-ely divided between the Palaihnilian, Yanan, and Pujunan ling'uistic 
families. It might be easily supposed by one who had no knowledge 
on the subject whatever, that the coiled basketry of the interior basin 
w^ould obtrude itself here and either push backward the tri])es making 
twined work, or at least the latter would be forced to a very subordi- 
nate position. Dr. Roland B. Dixon has published in the American 
Anthropologist, liut more extensively in the Bulletin of the American 
Museum of Natural Histor3\'' the result of accurate studies in the 
])asketrv of the eastern tribes. The most extensive researches of Dr. 
Dixon are on the basketry of the Maidu Indians described by Powers. 
On Powell's linguistic map these Indians are assigned to the Pujunan 
family. Their countr}^ lies east of the Sacramento River and extends 
as far as the Nevada line, stretching north and south from the southern 
line of Lassen and Tehama counties to the Consumne River. A number 
of examples of Maidu basketry have already been described, and illus- 
trated in Plates 56 and 57. The specimens are in the U. S. National 
Museum. 

The body is either in splints of willow or other wood and a species 
of root. At the time of this writing Mr. Coville was not quite sure as 
to the species employed. The designs on the body of the basket are 
in the splints of CercisoccidenUdis^ the l)ark and young shoots remain- 
ing in place. An inspection of a number of Maidu baskets together 
leaves the impression of distinct individuality. They ])elong to the 
three-rod variety of coiled weaving and the sewing passes over the 
foundation, under one of the rods of the foundation beneath, the stitches 
interlocking. Frequently on the inside they split, which enables the 
sewer to give each stitch on the outer surface a vertical position. The 
material used in the sewing is hard and is not driven tight home, each 
stitch being wide below and narrow above. After a study of one of 
these specimens, its colors and patterns, the investigator will have no 
trouble afterwards in identifying a Maidu basket. 

Dr. Dixon, who has given most attention to the lore in Maidu bas- 
kets, divides the symbols into three classes, namely: Natural designs, 
plant designs, and those representing natural or artificial o])jects. His 
plates 1 to 17 are devoted exclusively to ^Vlaidu Ijasketry. Among 
them will be seen a few in twined weaving, principally conical burden

Museum were collected by W. H. Holmes. 

A suggestion might be made in this connection that the so-called

feather design on the Dixon baskets^' may be those on arrows, which 
in some California tribes are notched. This is only a suggestion. One 
of Dixon's most intricate feather patterns has narrow lines between, 
resembling the letter H, whicli might be either the rib of the feathers 
or the owner's mark on the shaftment of the arrow. The association 
of this notched half feather design with the symbol for arrow points 
would be in harmony with this yiew. No other artificial object enters 
so profoundly into Indian art, gaming, lore, and ceremonj' . 

On the map of California, covering a small spot at the angle of the 
eastern border, are the Washoe Indians (Washoan family). They 
extend into the parts of Nevada adjoining, occupjdng the mountain 
region in the extreme western portion of the State about Washoe and 
Tahoe lakes and the towns of Carson and Virginia City. They for- 
merly extended farther east and south, but were driven back by the 
Paiute, who conquered them and reduced them to complete subjec- 
tion. Their basketry is the same general type as the Maidu, just 
north, but in execution it is far above. The material is willow, 
Datill-yah-wee; the brown or reddish tint is that of the bark of moun- 
tain birch {Cercis occidejitalls), Et-ba-sha, and the black is from the 
root of a mountain brake {^Pteridmm aqulllnum)^ mes-a-weg-a-see, all of 
lasting qualit}^, and they acquire with age a richness that makes them 
incomparable. The sewing is faultless. Stitch after stitch, over and 
over, increases in width and length with the swelling and shrinking of 
the basket like a harmony in music. The form of the specimen is 
charming, and the ornamentation ideal. The recognition of worth in 
the Washoe basketmaker is encouraging, for the price of a few pieces 
reaches into the thousands of dollars. The author heartily acknowl- 
edges the aid of Mrs. A. Cohn, of Carson City, Nevada, for information 
about the Washoes and for photographs. 

The tiny Washoe offering or gift basket (Sing-aru-mi), when used 
to propitiate the harvest spirit, is filled with choicest grain or seeds 
or acorns from the last crop to insure a future good harvest. One or 
two of the large storing or household baskets (Da-gee-coop) will hold 
the winter supply of grain or nuts. The flat cradles (Bicose-modi- 
mi-odi) are for the papooses (now gung). If the child's father is a 
famous brave or chief, the basket is covered with buckskin and gaily 
decorated with beads, trinkets, tasseled fringes, or feathers. The 
ornamentation of the little sheltering cover for the head tells the sex 
of the occupant.* 

Plate 179 represents three basket bowls in the U. S. National 
Museum labeled Washoe. They all show the characteristics of uni- 
formity and plain ornamentation referred to. The lowest in the series 
has also a margin of feather work which allies it with the t3^pe of the

National Museum. 

Plate 180 is one of the best specimens in Mrs. A. C'ohn's collection 
in Carson City, Nevada. The symbol on the surface is a collection of 
points meaning ''clear skies, good weather.'' Mrs. Cohn finds varia- 
tions in these, the number of points ranging from three to seven. In 
some examples they are contiguous; in others s(»parated by narrow 
spaces. 

Plate ISl is a picture of Datsolallee, the maker of the linest 
specimens of Washoe basketry. She is hokiing in her left hand the 
bowed stick in shape of a racquet, with which hot stones are taken 
from the fire to be placed in the basket of mush in order to cook 
it. The svmbols shown on the various baskets at her feet represent 
men, women, snakes, arrows, wind, weather symptoms, morning, and 
migrating. 

Plate 182. upper figure, shows a basket bowd of the Washoe Indians, 
collected by Eugene Mead. The foundation is the three-rod style in 
willow. The sewing is done in splints of the same material. The 
ornamentation on the l)ottom is a many pointed star in brown cercis. 
On the ])ody there are three circles made up of isosceles triangles in 
the same. Two of the rows on the body of the basket are so arranged 
as to have a narrow ))elt of white between them, the points of one 
being downward and the other upward. This form of ornamentation 
is suggestive of the patterns on the sewed coils of the Navaho basket 
bowls. The border is plain coiled sewing. Its diameter is 8f inches, 
and height 3^ inches. 

Plate 182, lower figure, is a basket bowl. Catalogue No. 204853, 
U. S. National Museum, coiled work from In,yo County, California, 
tribe not positively known. There are four sets of ornamentation on 
the side in step pattern in threes, done in sewing splints dyed black. 
The most interesting feature of the basket is the border, which is in 
false braid, made of a single splint wrapped over the upper founda- 
tion, forward, under, and back, over again and down beneath the two 
foundation rows, making a figure 8. 

The southern portion of the Oregon-California basket area is 
bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean and there was little encour- 
agement to venture beyond the shore line except in San Francisco Bay 
and around the Santa Barbara Islands. On the north of it are the 
Maidu, Copehan, and the Yukian families. On the south and forming 
a part of the subarea itself are the Missions, some of which belong to 
the Yuman family, the southern boundary of the area. The great 
Shoshonean family has pushed across the drainage of the interior 
basin to the coast at Santa Barbara. This southern region is a long 
rectangle inclined toward the west. Its axis would be a meridian 
through diagonal corners. The eastern portion is Shoshonean terri-

tory. The western portioi belong-s to the following- linguistic families: 
Moquelumnan, Costanoan, Mariposan, Esselenan, Salinan, and Chu- 
mashan. Along the median line of this subarea are Mono, Fresno, 
Inj'o, Tulare, and Kern counties — another basketry Caucasus or Babel. 
(See tig. 1<)3.) 

Those who have made collections from this part of California will 
bear witness that the exchanging of baskets and of women who make 
baskets from stock to stock has rendered it almost impossible to 
identify forms ethnically. Here Itlood and speech and industry are 
apt to be confounded. At least, it is too early in the investigation to 
be positive on the subject. 

Another tlifhculty arises in this studv from the fact that language 
groups, tribal names, and county names are also mixed up. For in- 
stance, a basket may be called Tuhire })ecause it was purchased in that 
county of California, having no reference to the Indian tribe. A 
specimen made by the same woman Avill bear the name of the tribe of 
which she is a member. Still another one of her productions might 
be called from the g-roup of languages to which her own belongs. At 
present the confusion extends ])eyond form and design to the sub- 
stances and technical processes. The author acknowledges his obliga- 
tions to E. L. McLeod, of Bakersfield; C. P. Wilcomb, of Golden 
Gate Park ^Museum, and Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of Washington, for 
the information here given. Each of these has given most careful 
study to this cosmopolitan basket region. Dr. Merriam has devoted 
special attention to the plants used." 

Of this war(> Dr. Merriam says that most of the coiled baskets made 
by the Indians inhabiting the lower slopes of the Sierra from Fresno 
River south to the Kern are celebrated for excellence of workmanship, 
beauty of form, elegance of desig'n, and richness of material, which 
ditfers in tone and texture from that used by the tribes north and 
south of the region indicated. When fresh, its color is brownish buff; 
with age it becomes darker and richer. By careful selection a hand- 
some dappled effe(^t is produced. It is made from the root of a marsh 
plant which the Indians traveled long distances to procure, identified 
by Miss Alice Eastwood, botanist of the California Academy of Sci- 
ences, as Cladmvi riumscvs. The foundation consists of a l)undle of 
stems of a yellow grass, Eplcampes 7'igens. The black in the design 
is the root of the ''•l)racken" or "brake fern," Pterklium aquilmum. 
The red is usually split l)ranches of the red])ud, Cercis occidentalism 
with the bark on, gathered after the fall rains, when the bark is red. 
The tribes making the CJadluin baskets are the Nims, Chukchancys, 
Cocahebas, Wuksaches, Wiktchumnes, Tulares, and perhaps one or 

« It is too early to complete a plant synonymy for the Inyo-Kern and Tulare bas- 
ketry. The Hst of Coville (pp. 199-214 of this paper) and the follov/ing i>aragraphs

two others. Besides these, tlie root is sometimes used ])y certain 
squaws of the Mewah tribe living" nortli of the Fresno and by the 
PakanepuU and Newooah tribes living- south of the Kern; l)ut among 
these its use is exceptional. 

Another material which has proved a stuml)ling-])lo<'k to collectors 
is the red of the design in the handsome baskets made by the Kern 
Valley, Newooah, and Panamint Shoshone Indians. This material is 
often called cactus root. It is the unpeeled root of the tree yucca 
{Yucca arh(t)-ei<ce}ii<), which grows in the hig-her parts of the Mohave 
Desert, pushes over Walker Pass, and reaches down into the upper 
part of the valley of South Fork of Kern. The so-called Tejon Indians 
ol»tain it in Antelope Vallej", at the extreme west end of the Mohave 
Desert. The yucca root varies considerably in depth of color, so that 
hy careful selection some of the Indian women produce beautiful 
shaded effects and delinite pattern contrasts. 

Some of the Panamint Shoshones inhabiting the desolate desert 
region between Owens Lake and Death Valley use, either in com))ina- 
tion with the yucca root or independently, the l)right-red shafts of the 
wing" and tail feathers of a woodpecker — the red-shafted flicker, 
Colaptes caft'V coUaris. These same Indians use two widely different 
materials for their black designs — the split seed pods of the deviPs 
horn, Mdiiijn'ut, and the root of a marsh bulrush, Sclrjms. The Jfar- 
tynld is a relatively coarse material, and when properly selected yields 
a dead ])lack. The Sc!rj)us root is a flne, delicate material, which, by 
burying in wet ashes, is made to assume several shades or tones, from 
blackish brown to purplish black, or even lustrous. black. 

In parts of the Colorado Desert in southeastern California the Coah- 
uilla Indians use split strands from the leaf of the desert palm {ISfeo- 
icashhi<jt<>niajilainent(m() as a surface material for their coiled baskets. 
The design is usually black or orange-brown, and is a rush {Juncus).^ 

The following list gives the families of the tribes in Tulare, Kern, 
and Inyo counties, using the plants named in the first part of this 
description: 1. Chukchan cysChukchan si (Mariposan); 2. Cocahe])as; 
3. Mewah (Moquelumnan); 4. Newooah; 5. Nims; 6. PakanepuU; 
7. Tulares (part of Olamentke di v., Moquelumnan); 8. Wiktchumnes, 
Wikchumni (Mariposan); 0. Wuksaches, Wiksachi (Mariposan). 

The elements of ornamentation are lines direct and crooked, in 
shapes as varied as the margins of leaves, and they might without 
affectation receive the same names — dentate, serrate, sinuous, etc. 
These simple lines are combined in i^arallels, herring-bone, chevrons, 
crenellations, and many more patterns. The triangle, the rectangle, 
the rhomb, and the pol3^gon are used in great variety. Out of these 
elements the designs on this basketry are separate, concentric, or 
radiate. 

«C. Hart Merriam, Science, May 23, 1903. 



470 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

The separate designs are, after all, subservient to the others. Very 
little of this ware shows entirely free and scattered patterns. The 
plume or L-shaped, the white and colored rectangles associated, the 
groups of marks on the border, and chiefly the rectangles in two colors 
with hourglass middle arc most common. 

Concentric designs are narrow or wide bands, whose middle portion 
is decorated with crooked lines and geometric figures in endless variety 
of combinations. Most of the ])ands have entire margins, Imt project- 
ing margins are not unknown. The most noteworthy is Merriam's 
"Initterfly flight design.'' (See Plate 194.) 

The radial designs are straight or spiral. The composition of each 
ray is a study in itself. But a glance at a large numlnu- of baskets 
from this central region shows the predominance of the cuneate 
motive. These truncated wedges spring out of a central, circular 
pattern and widen toward the margin. Their surfaces and their mar- 
gins are seldom entire. The spiral designs are also frequently wedge- 
shaped, but the manner of their composition is of the greatest interest. 
Lurking in them all is the stepped motive in which herringbone or 
jagged lines and simple geometric figures follow one another by echelon. 
This on a roundish surface gives spirals of any amount of curvature. 
By widening and lengthening the rectangular elements the wedge- 
shaped interspaces are filled with the spiral pattern and the whole 
surface is covered with a single design. This charming decoration 
is peculiar to the Santa Barbara baskets. (See Plate 49.) In outward 
form the baskets of the area here considered vary from round, flat 
gambling mats, through trays and bowls of various depths, and hats 
of conical shape, to narrow-mouthed vases, or '"bottle-necks" as they 
are called. Some of these are low and broad and closely resemble 
the best of ancient Arizona pottery. 

The basketry of the Panamint Indians (Shoshonean) living in Death 
Valley, Inyo County, says Coville, is made ])y the squaws at the cost 
of a great deal of time, care, and skill. The materials are very simple. 
They consist of the year-old shoots of some species of tough willow, 
splints from Salix las/andra^ the year-old shoots of the aromatic 
sumac, Hhifs trilohata^ the long, black, slender, flexible horns on the 
mature pods of the unicorn plant, Marty nia Jouisiuna, locally known as 
devil horns, and the long, red roots of the tree yucca, Yucca arhorescois. 
These materials gi^e three types of color — that of the willow and the 
sumac, the black of the devil horns, and the red of the yucca roots. 
This last material, although it has a .strong fiber and a prettv red color, 
is rarely used, for it is too thick to pack closely and the resulting 
fabric is full of interstices. 

Sumac and willow are prepared for use in the same way by the 
Panamint Indians. The bark is removed from the fresh shoots by 
biting it loose at the end and tearing it off. The woody portion is 



ABOKIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 47 1 

scraped to remove bud protu])eraiK"es and other inequalities of the 
surface and is then allowed to dry. These slender stems serve as 
foundation. The sewing material is prepared from the same plants. 
A squaw selects a fresh shoot, breaks off the too slender upper por- 
tion and bites one end so that it starts to split into three nearly equal 
parts. Holding- one of these parts in her teeth and one in either hand, 
she pulls them apart, guiding the splitting with her lingers so dexter- 
ously that the whole shoot is divided into three equal ev^eii portions. 
Taking one of these, by a similar process she splits off the pith and 
the adjacent less rtexil)l(' tissu*^ from the inner face, and the bark from 
the outer, leaving a pliant, strong, liat strip of young willow or sumac 
wood. Both stems and splints may be dried and kept for months and 
pro])ably even for several years, but before ])eing used they are alwaj^s 
soaked in water. 

The pack baskets and some, at least, of the water baskets are made 
of these splints and rods in twined work. The women begin at the 
bottom with two la3'ers of rods superimposed and fastened b}' their 
middles at right angles. The free ends are bent upward, and in and 
out between them the strands are woven, new warp rods being inserted 
as the basket widens. An attemjjt at ornamentation is frequently 
made by retaining the bark on some of the strands or by staining 
them and l)y slightly varying the weave. A squaw conmionly occu- 
pies an entire month constructing one such basket. 

Starting from a central point to make a coiled basket, a bundle of 
two or three grass stems and one ver}^ slender rod is wu-apped with a 
willow splint. At the proper point the foundation is drawn more 
tightly, so that the remainder of the spiral forms the sides of the 
basket. The wall has the thickness, therefore, of one of these ])un- 
dles, and is composed of a continuous ascending spiral. The willow 
rod furnishes a strong hold for the stitches, and the punctures are made 
with an iron awl. When such an instrument can not be obtained an 
admiral)le equivalent is substituted in the form of a stout, horny 
cactus spine from the devil's pincushion, EcJiinocactus polijcej>halus^ 
set in a head of hard pitch. The grass stems, when the stitches are 
drawn tightly, make a perfect packing, and the basket when finished 
is water tight. 

The pack baskets of the Panamint Indians have the form of a 
funnel, from 1^ to 2i feet high and not quite so broad. The loaded 
basket is held against the back between the shoulders, either by the 
hands grasping its rim, or by leather or rope throngs passed around 
the forehead, the bod}^ meanwhile bent forward. 

The plaques are small, flat, circular pieces of closely sewed coiled 
work, usually 9 to 12 inches in diameter. They are flexible and some- 
times slightl}" saucer-shaped, and are used not only as plates and pans, 
but also as substitutes for sieves. The material to be sifted, coDjposed 
of ground seeds, is placed upon the plate and the chaff winnowed out. 



472 REPORT OF NATIONAL MITSEUM, 1902. 

The pot })askot of the Punumints is in coiled work uiul Ims the shape 
of a rather deep bowl with curved sides and a deep bottom, and has a 
capacity of about 3 })ints. The squaw uses it as a general measure, 
as a bowl for dry food and for soup, and often, when in the sunshine, 
as a hat. ]\lost of their starchy food is roasted dry l)y mixing- seeds, 
before they are ground, with liot coals and Stirling them in the ])as- 
ket. This process is still largely used. 

Tlie water basket has a capacity of '2 or 8 gallons. Its outline is 
that of an urn with a narrow neck and a rounded, conical bottom. 
The entire inner surface, and frequently the outside, is coated with 
pitch. Woven into the shoulder of the basket on one side are two 
loops of horsehair, or other strong material, to which is attached a 
thong. In carrying, this thong is passed around the forehead, while 
the basket is rested on the back between the shoulders. 

All the Shoshonean types of weaving, all their forms of baskets, and 
most of the patterns on them are ancient. The can\'on walls of the 
upper tril)utaries of the Colorado are honej^combed with clitf and cave 
dw^ellings. From them came inexhaustible treasures of l)asket work." 

In the collection of Dr. C. Hart Merriam in Washington City there 
ai'e most excellent examples of the Panamint (Shoshonean) Indian 
basket work in which the ornamentation has been a matter of especial 
stud}". Plate 183 illustrates live examples from Dr. Merriam's collec- 
tion, which I am allow^ed here to reproduce. Before speaking of them 
it will be at once noticed that these Indians, whose origin, or at least 
most numerous kindred, are in the Interior Basin, have been in con- 
tact with well-known California tribes and have been subjected to their 
influence. (See also Plate 185.) 

Fig. 1 will be recognized at once in its relationship with the Tulare 
tribes. The ornamentation consists of four cycloidal radii made up of 
rectangles in black, arranged in stepped pattern. Each one of these 
rectangles is ornamented with two double chevron patterns called hour- 
glass designs bj^ Dr. Dixon. In some examples the color is mixed red 
and black. Collections of short and parallel lines on the ])order ter- 
minate the patterns. 

Fig. 2, another Panamint bowl, has the center ornamented with 
groups of small rectangles in threes. The tirst ])and near the bottom 
has for decoration a design which resembles a barbed harpoon head 
with unilateral prongs. The principal band on the body is decorated 
with a series of rhombs in black, containing white and black designs 
within. In some of the Californian eastern tribes this design repre- 
sents the eye, but until the symbol is surely known, denotive names 
are better. The border is decorated with grou])s of short marks in 
threes.

Fig. 3 is a ])owl with plain center, excepting a short owner's mark, 
and on the body an; two bands, each one decorated bv a thrcefokl 
chevroncd pattern. It will ho noted that the oti'sets in the three bound- 
ary' lines of the designs are exactly in line with the tinishing otf at 
the upper border. This feature is often mentioned l)y basket collect- 
ors among other tribes. 

Fig. 4 is another Panamint bowl, the interior d<>corated by plain 
rings in black. From the l)ottom project four ('({uidistant wedge- 
shaped designs decorated on the surface with rhombs in white. On 
the border, the pattern shown in fig. 1 appears rectangular in form 
with eight single chevroned designs on tht^ surface. One of the pat- 
terns is abbreviated, and l^etween the two wedge-shaped designs on 
the right side of the ligure is an arrow nu^tive which may represent 
arrowheads strung or the feather of the arrow notched. 

Fig. 5 is another Panamint l)owl, with five wedge-shaped designs on 
the l)ody. proceeding from a dark ring bordering the bottom. Each 
design has outside edges bordered in white, with serrate edges in 
brown and straight venations in white on the middle portion. The 
little gi-oups of marks in threes on the 1)order have nothing to do with 
the radiate pattern. 

Plate 184 is introduced here for the purpose of showing how the 
colors mentioned in the foregoing pages are used in giving variety 
and beauty to the surface of the ware in this area. The yellow golden 
color is that of the usual sexting material. The black is produced by 
the use of martynia. The red is from the Yucca ((r7jorc.sce/ix. In the 
ordinary photographic plate the effect of these colors is lost, but in 
the illustrations here given the full effect is brouoht out. Attention 
is called also in the lower ffgure to the union of two methods of sewino-. 
In the figured stripe in the middle, open sewing is shown, while on the 
rest of the bod}^ the stitches are packed close together. It has Pana- 
mint designs. On the upper bow 1 thev are Yokut, but the materials 
of both are Panamint. The open weaving also and the shred founda- 
tion point in the same direction. 

The following information concerning the basket tangle in this area 
is from Mr. C. P. Wilcomb, of the Golden Gate Park ]Museum, San 
Francisco. The Inyo and the Kern (Inyo-Kern) l)asketrv are virtu- 
ally undistinguishable, the tribes are Paiute (Shoshonean). The 
Tulare County basketry is that of the Yokuts, and is identical 
with that of the Yokuts of Fresno Countv and of the Monache or 
Monos (Shoshoneans inhabiting the headwaters of the San Joaquin and 
Kings rivers). The Monache and the Fresno work are somewhat coarser 
than that of the Tulare tribes, but in materials and shapes are identical. 
The Kern tribes are mostly on upper Kern Kiver in the vicinity of 
Kernville. 



474 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

The distinction between the two groups seems to rest on a geograph- 
ical basis, inasmuch as the In3x^-Kern tribes are all east of the Sierra- 
Tehachapi range, and the other group. Ijoth Yokuts and Shoshoneau 
Monache, west of the main divide. 

The Tulare-Fresno foundation is made of grass stems {Sporoholus 
mlfa^ or Epicanvpes rigens). The Inj^o-Kern foundation is of willow 
{Salic las/andra) or sometimes of the root of sumac {JRJnis irilolmtci). 
For the Tulare sewing, roots of slough-grass {Ctjj>e7'a8 virens, or Cla- 
dium marisGus) are used, while in the Kern, willow is usuall}' employed. 
For the red of their patterns the Tulare-Fresno women employ the 
redbud {Cercis occ/'de/ttal/.s), which is coarser than the root of the Jucca 
arhorescens^ used for the same purpose l)y the In3'o-Kern and Pana- 
mint. The Yucca root is of light yellowish red like willow bark, but 
is sometimes as dark as cercis. In some of the Inirden baskets and 
winnowing trays willow bark is used for red. The Paiutes do not 
use redbud. For black the Tulare-Fresno women use the common 
fern root [Pteridimn aquilinum\ while in In3"o-Kern and Panamint 
the heart of the tule root (Sc/'rpns nevadensis) and Mart\'nia are 
employed. In Inyo-Kern ware quail tips and red wool are rarely 
used on baskets as they are on Tulare; but small private marks and 
symbols are wrought with split pink quills from the woodpecker known 
as redshafted flicker. The Tulare make many large bowl-shaped bas- 
kets. In In3^o they are small, if of this shape. 

Plate 185 will emphasize the ditference hinted at in the foregoing 
text between the coarser and liner weaving in the same area. The 
upper figure in the plate is a Tejon bottle-necked jar in the collection 
of E. L. McLeod, of Bakerslield. The ornamentation is the striped 
pattern well known among the difl:'erent tribes in this area. The 
foundation is laid up rather wide for the size of the basket and the 
sewing far apart, the stitches not being crowded home. Compare 
this with the specimen which follows. 

Fig. 2, catalogue No. 204851, U. 8. National Museum, is a tine 
coiled basket bowl collected 1)3" Eugene Mead. The foundation is of 
the three-stem type. The scAving is in splints of Cladimn. The 
ornamentation is in the black fern root {Pteridmin CKjuilimmi). 
There are nine rows of sewing and thirteen stitches to the inch, but 
the most remarkable feature in this large bowl is that the three i-ods 
foundation and the sewing together make a fabric not an eighth of an 
inch in thickness. The designs are two serrated lines in black. On 
either side is a combination of S3aiibolic figures which almost resem- 
ble letters of the alphabet. There is no exact history of this basket, 
but it is pronounced b3" Dr. Merriam to be the Fresno t3"pe of Yokut 
basket. It is an intrusive form among the Owens Valley Paiutes, 
captured l)v them on a raid into the interior side of the Sierra Moun- 
tains a long time ago. Its height is 7^ inches, and diameter 15 inches. 



ABOEIQINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 475 

Plate 186, one of the interesting- specimens in Mr. Wilcom})'s collec- 
tion, is an Inyo basket, made in Inyo County ]\y a Tulare (Yokut) 
squaw. It is 18 inches in diameter. The ornamentation outside the 
plain center is radial in two bands of stepped patterns, the inner band 
of six, the outer of thirteen. Each one of the latter having- five 
parallel elements, there are with the interspaces seventy-eight ele- 
mentary stepped designs in the l)and. The border is the oft-recurring 
bunch of colored stitches in groups. 

Plate 187 represents baskets in the collections of, Powers and (Javin 
and Leonard. They are Tulare, but an examination shows what has 
heretofore been alluded to, the dili'erence between the open and rather 
coarse texture of the Tulare basket mentioned by Mr. Wilcomb and 
the very nuich more refined type of the Inyo-Kern makers as in the 
lower figure. One characteristic worthy of observation is the use the 
weaver has made of small difierences of shade in the splints for sewing-, 
g-iving- a clouded efi'ect to the surface. 

From the Tule River country', says E. L. McLeod, we have the 
fine flexible work, an improvement on their more northern sistei's in 
Fresno. But the women of the Tejon and adjacent mountain tribes 
certainly excelled in their basket work. Their choice ware is much 
more beautifully finished, their patterns much more numerous, and 
here is where they show the influence of both north and south in the 
number and diversity of their patterns, also in the trading of mate- 
rials. Old baskets have been taken from the caves in the Tejon where 
the bottom was Mission and the top ])eautifal, tine Tejon; also exam- 
ples brought from caves in Santa Barbara County that were made 
over in the Tejon, as the stitch, texture, and all general appearance go 
to show that they were carried a])out by the Indians with them. 

An excellent example of moving about of l)asket makers is given 
b}' McLeod. A woman was born at San Gabriel Mission, Avhere 
she was baptized as ]VIaria Narcissa, and is now about 70 years old. 
She was brought to the Tejon Canyon while a young child about 9 
years old, and she still remembers much of the language and customs 
of her native people. Her uncle Sabastian was General Fremont's 
guide into the San Joaquin Valley through the Tejon Pass. Maria 
Narcissa not only learned the language of her adopted people, but 
man}' of the dialects of the surrounding tribes. Between forty and 
fifty years ago she was taken as wife by a young American of English- 
German parentage. The}^ were the parents of a large family of chil- 
dren, and he gave them all as good an education as possible, especially 
the eldest daughter. 

She was not able to give uuich light on the general family relation. 
The tribes from the north as far up as Tule River used to come down 
to the Tejon for some purpose, either religious or social. She tells of 
great feasts and dances and great gaming baskets where they used to

pla}' games of chance. But far the long-est travel was from San 
Fernando, San Gabriel, Ventura, Santa Barbara, and Santa Inez. 
Many came from there every j-ear to the Tejon, and we find unques- 
tionable evidence in the meeting of all these streams in their basket 
work. 

In a translation from Costanso (17f)9)" occurs this account of the 
Santa Bar])ara basket makers: 

Ttiei^e are [the Indian women] who make the travH and vaHes of rushes, to which 
they give a thousand different forms and graceful patterns, according to the uses to 
which they are destined, whether it he for eating, drinking, guarding their seeds, or 
other ends, for these people do not know tlie use of earthenware as those of San 
Diego use it. * * * 

The large vessels, whicli hold water, are of a very strong weave of rushes [jum-o], 
pitched within, and they give tliem the same form as our tinigas [water jars]. 

Plates 18S to 195 are taken from baskets in the McLeod collection 
and cover the subjects of form and design in the Inj^o-Kern and Tulare- 
Fresno area. They furnisli an excellent opportunity of seeing how far 
a few simple geometric elements coml)ine in kaleidoscopic eU'ects in the 
hands of the skillful Indian woman. Some of these specimens are of 
exceeding delicacy, and it is a matter of wonder how so many little 
stems of uniform diameter could be gathered together. Gauges are 
out of the question.

Plate 193 is a tine coiled ])asket of the Kern County Indians, who 
belong to the Shoshonean family. It was made in Canebrake Canyon 
by the last old basket maker of the tribe, who was swept away in a 
flood in August, lltol. The decorative patterns are ideal. Nine ver- 
tical stripes in black and red, with stepped borders and diamond figures 
on the interior, rise from the plain bottom and extend to the lower 
edge of the rim. The latter has its own fine-checkered, sloping 
designs, with no relation to the decoration on the l)ody. Circumfer- 
ence, 29 inches: diameter, 9 inches: height, 5 inches; stitches to the 
inch. 32; colors, red. black, and cream. A design of quail plumes is 
shown on the border.

were both made by the same squaw, who was supposed to be about 85 
years of age, and was the last really good weaver in Kern County. 
The ornamentation on this basket consists in a band of dentate figures 
on the bottom and three bands of crenelated ornament on the body 
and top. The dentate figures also occur on the outer projection of the 
crenelles on the body. Dr. Merriam has found this pattern symboliz- 
ing the spasmodic flight of a butterfly. Below the border of the lower 
band are rhombs in pairs, and there are five checker oblique patterns 
about the rim.

this as tno most beautiful specimen in liis collection. The woman was 
three years at work on it, and it is at least 60 years old. The orna- 
mentation consists of dis- 
crete figures of five rec- 
tangles, thirteen men on 
the upper part, but chiefly 
of seven radial patterns 
ascending- to the mouth. 
Each is made up of a con- 
tinuous series of rectan- 
gular figures touching and 
by echelon. This pattern 
will be seen frequently, 
and the specimen may l)e 
taken as a type of that 
particular design. 

Fig. 172 is a grasshop- 
per basket of the Wikch- 
umni Indians (Mariposan 
family), in a style of tech- 
niqiu^. which may be called 
interrupted coiled work. 
The foundation is a small 
bundle of stems or shreds. 
The sewing consists in 
wrapping the foundation 
from five to ten tim(>s with the si)lint, and then catcliing this under 
one or two turns of the coil below in the form of stitches, the only 
bond which holds the fabric togetlier being these few stitches. Another 
example of this sort of interrupted 
work in North America is shown in 
Plate 120, ilhistrating basketry from 
the Eskimo of Hudson Bay. 

The existence of this type of bas- 
ketry in a restricted area among the 
Mariposan family raises interesting 
questions about the cause of its oc- 
currence here. The ornamentation 
consists in rows, hourglass patterns, 
and figures resembling the letters 
of the alphabet, don(» in })rown ma- 
terial, like cercis or fern stems. 

The detail of this interrupted work 
is well shown in fig. 173, where the wrapj)ing is plainly iUustrated, 
and also the methods of joining. By bringing the stitches one over

another, g-eometrical patterns are produced. As the vrork ^vidcns, 
new rows are introduced, as will he seen in the ])rincipal tij^ure. 

This specimen Catalogue No. 21558(>, in the IT. S. National Museum, 
is a o-ift from C. V. Wilcoml), of California. 

Mr. McLeod. who has the largest collection of th<> grasshopper 
baskets, says of them that the}^ have no such function. They are all 
made by two families, the Butterbread and the Williams living in 
Kelsey Canyon, Kern County, California. Tiio sewing and wrapping 
are faultless. The ornamentation is chiefly in plain lines and rec- 
taiigl(\s. On one of them, fig. 10, the chevroned design is attcMupted 
with d()ul)tful success, but figs. 2 and 8 have the stepped radial pat- 
terns well carried out, and on fig. r) the human conventional figure is 
cleverly executed. (See Plate 19(3.) 

Mission Indian basket makers belong to the Shoshonean and Yuman 
families. They receive their several names fi-om the Franciscan mis- 
sions of southern California, into which they were gathered, and where 
their tribal identity was lost. In the pi'esent state of knowledge it is 
not possible to distinguish the linguistic family by tlu^ shape, technic, 
or designs of basketry. 

The material of Mission Indian baskets differs according to locality. 
A rush, proI)a]dy several species, is used for the sewing-, the best 
known to Mr. Coville is Juiichs IrKiwril, the Techahet Indians using it 
almost exclusively. This plant is collected and dried, and what are 
often thought to be brushes by strangers are merely bunches of this 
rush prepared for the weaver's use. A tall, thin grass, ]7//}/ r/yens^ is 
used as the body of the coil, about which pieces of the Jwto/s are 
wound. Such of the latter as are intended for ornamentation are 
dyed black b\' steeping in water portions of Sut'dtf, dlff'Hxn, and a rich 
yellowish brown is produced in a like manner from the plants Ddlea 
emoryi and Dalca pohjadeuui. . The bottoms of large baskets are often 
strengthened l)y the introduction of twigs of RJhus arovudlea or thvee- 
leaf sumac. Dr. Merriam finds that latterly the leaf of a jmlm {Xrn- 
iva><Ji! iKjfonId jilainentosa) is used for sewing. The work resembles 
that done in rafia. 

In beginning a basket a central foundation is made and the rush 
wound al)Out it and coiled, fastened ))y fibers passing through holes 
made for the purpose with a point(Kl l)one or metal awl. This is the 
commonest method employed. 

To assist the student in understanding {\\e relationship of arts in 
southern California, the following account of tril)es from Dr. Barrows 
will be helpful. The Indian tribes south of Santa Inez Mountains on 
the coast and San Joaquin Valley in the interior fall into three divi- 
sions: (1) Tril)es of Santa Barl)ai'a channels and islands covering the 
coast of Ventura County; (2) Serranos; (3) Coahuillas. 
NAT MUS 1902 31

The Serranos live on a .small reservation at San Bernardino and 
on the Morongo Reservation in the San Gorgonio pass in southern 
California. They are called Takhtani by Loew. 

The Coahuillas live in the Colorado Desert and the San Jacinto 
Mountains. The word is also spelled Kauviiyah b}^ Gatschet after 
Loew. Dr. Barrows thinks this to be only the German spelling for 
Coahuilla (pronounced Kau-vii-yah). 

With them ho joins by speech the Indians of the missions north- 
ward, making a Coaliuillian linguistic family; perhaps it were better a 

subfamily.

Barrows narrates that the Coahuilla basketry and that of the Diegue- 
nos as well as Luiseiios is of the one California type, namely, coiled 
ware, and fragments of similar technic have been found by Schumacher 
in the graves of the Santa Barbara channel. He quotes Humboldt to 
the eti'ect that the Indians j^resented the Spaniards "with vases 
curiously wrought of stalks of rushes and covered within with a very 
thin layfr of asphaltum that renders them impenetrable to water." 
Lumps of the material are said to have l)een put into the l)asket with 
hot stones and shaken with a rotary motion to distribute it. The 
foundation of the coil is a biuich of grass, su-ul ( YUfa r!(/r'n.s). The 
sewing material varies according to the color desired. The three-leaf 
sumac {Rhus trilohata) gives a light straw color; these are dyed black 
in a wash, made from the berry stems of the elder, hun kwat {Sani- 
hucm). The other sewing material is a bulrush or reed grass {'/uncus 
lesnerit, or Juneus rohuHtus). The scape and leaves are 2 to 4 feet high 
or more, stout and pungent. A supply of these is gathered by the 
basket maker and cut into suitable lengths. The woman then with her 
hands and teeth splits the scape carefullv into three equal portions. 
Near its base the reed is of a deep red, lightening in color upward, 
passing through several shades of light brown, and ending at the top 
in a brownish yellow. For d3'eing black, ngaial {Suedadijfusa) is also 
employed, and Dr. Palmer also mentions a dahlia {D. jyoluadenid) as 
furnishing a yellowish brown dye. 

The Techahet, use the reed grass {J\in<ms rolxiM'us) or the Rhus

basket is beouii at tiie center of the bottom, the thickness of the coil 
of o-rass dependino- upon the size of the basket to be made. A bone 
pricker is used. The coil is begun by la3dno- one end of the filament 
upon tlie bunch of grass and taking a few wraps about it to hold it 
down. 'Piiis is bent doutde and the sewing progresses l)y catching the 
filament ovei- the bunch of grass through the coil of the sowing filament 
made at the last tuj'n. 

Basket making among the Coahuillas belongs to the old women. 
They sit flat on the ground with the feet thrust out in front. The 
<left artist holds her work in her lap, at her right lies the grass for the 
foundation, on her left, soaking in a pot of water, her variously c<)l- 
ored splints. Her only tool is her awl, '' wish,'' anciently of bon«^ or a 
cactus spine set in a piece of asphaltum; but now a nail servers the pur- 
pose, one end pointed, the other in a handle of manzanita wood. The 
sewing materials are named according to colors — the scapes of jmieux 
se il; the red portion, i i ul; dyed Idack they are se-il-tu-iksh. Splints 
from sumac are se-lit and the grass of the foundation suul. No model 
or pattern is ever used. The border is finished by simply cutting the 
sewing material close on the inner side. The most common form, 
se-whaldal, of Coahuilla basket has a flat l)ottom and gently flaring- 
sides, a depth of from 4 to 7 inches and a width of from 13 to '10 
inches. These are for holding foods, including seeds, grains and 
fruits, household utensils, and basket matei-ials. Small, globular bas- 
kets, with bulging sides and rather wide mouths, 5 to 10 inches in 
diameter, are called te-vin-ze-mal. They are the prettiest and the 
most carefully ornamented and are used to hold trinkets and sewing 
materials. The deep packing l)askets, se kwa-vel-em, are about IS 
inches deep and are used for packing loads. Rawhide strings, ka wi 
ve, are tied to opposite edges to pass around the forehead, but usually 
the basket is sustained in a net. They are used not only for food gath- 
ering, but on the threshing-floor for storing foods. The chi-pat-mal is 
a round, almost flat basket, 10 to 18 inches in diameter and one or more 
inches deep, used for harvesting. The woman beats it full of grass 
seeds or fills it with elder berries or cactus fruit, and transfers the 
contents to the packing basket on her back. It makes a good tray, 
platter, fruit dish, or receptacle for meal, and is exclusively the 
winnower. 

The basket hat, yu-ma-wal, shaped like a truncated cone, is worn by 
women especiall}^ to protect the head from the carrying band. It 
serves also for a water dipper or mixing pan. The chi-pa-cha-kish, 
holding al>out 2 quarts, is an openwork ))asketof network, made from 
the unsplit, flattened scapes of the se-il, or Juncus. They are often

Fig. 174 is a coiled basket of the Coahuilla (Shoshonean family). 
The foundation coil is of stems of grass; the sewing is in splints of 
sumac {RJniH trllobata). The ornanientation is in stems of rush dyed 
black with sea blite {Sueda diffimt). 

No special study has been made of the meaning in the designs upon 
the Coahuilla basketry. It is impossible, therefore, to guess what the 
combinations of parallelograms may mean. From the point of view of 
elementary forms in d(^sign, it is interesting to note what diversities 
of effects may be produced by variations in the form and composition

so suggested with reference to the other that the white space ))etween 
forms a continuous chevron. It is a little difficult to say wheth(>r the 
whole meaning of such a result from simple processes was in the mind 
of the basket maker. While not wishing 
to deprive her of all the credit due to her 
for this beautiful work, one can scarcely 
refrain from thinking that the total effect 
was not comprehended by the artist.

Twined weaving is not so common as coiled work in southern Call

ever, than is shown in tig. 178, from the Dieguenos Indians (Yumau 
family) living al)out San Diego, California. The specimen is a ])asket 
for cactus fruit. The warp is gathered singly or in pairs in the twists 
of the weft. Old specimens of twined weaving from the region, on 
the contrary, are tinely wrought.

Mrs. Watkins, the Government teacher there, and sent to the National 
Museum by Miss Constance Goddard DuBois. The dark threads are 
said, l)y Mrs. Watkins, to be made from the inner bark of A^elepim 
"iieHtttd and the lighter threads, in which the decorative bands are 
worked, from Asdcpias ascicularis. It is a very ancient piece, the 
only one that had been seen in those pai'ts. Narciso Lachapa. whose 
father owned it, says it was old when he was a boy. 

The majority of baskets from the Mission region are in coiled weav-

seen in collections, but none equalling this in size and beaut3\ Its 
height is 20 inches. 

THE INTERIOE BASIN REGION 

Not the hands, but reason teaches mankind arts; but the hands are the instruments of arts, as the 
lyre is of the musician and the forceps are of the mechanic. — Galen. 

Leaving now the Pacific slope we ma}^ examine the l)asketr3' of the 
Great Interior Basin, bounded on the east l»y the Siouan, Kiowan, and 
Caddoan families be^'ond the Rocky Mountains. The Siouan tribes, 
together with the western Algonquian and other tribes wedged in 
among them, borrow coiled gam])Iing l)askets and substitute the con- 
venient butl'alo hide for textiles; but the Caddoan (see tigs. 124, 125) 
were excellent workers in twilled weaving. 

On the north, this l)asketry ai'ea merges into the Fraser-Colum])ian 
group, Salishan and Shahayjtian tribes chiefly, who are especially skill- 
ful in twined work of peculiar t3'pes. The soft hat in wrapped twined 
work and most of all the twined wallet overlaid predominate with the 
Shahaptian, but the kSalish have a wide range of technic. 

On the west there is no sharp boundary line as will be soon shown, 
the Interior Basin area and the Oregon-California fitting into and 
invading each other as shore and w^ater line on an irregular coast. 
This will l)e especially noticeal)le with coiled work, the three-rod 
foundation of California being adopted l)y some Ute tribes. 

The same is true of the southern ))oundar3', the linguistic families 
dovetailing into those of Mexico. The Apache cross the boundary 
southward, the Yuman and Piman tribes also reaching northward and 
excelling in coiled ware with fine grass foundation. 

The tribal or ethnic groups in this area are chiefly the Shoshonean 
and the Athapascan. The first named is a vast linguistic famil}' reach- 
ing from near the forty-ninth parallel to Costa Rica, the latter, (juite 
as widespread, extending between 30° and 70° north. Care must 
again ])e taken to separate the classific <'oncept of language from that 
of ])lood kinship or of arts. Where peoples live contiguous and have 
the same speech, their blood becomes mingled as a matter of course.

SnOSIIOXEAN AND ITEULO BASKETRY 

By far the hiro-est ])art of the Interior Basin is Shoslionean. The 
tribes also spread out far to the north in the drainage of the Snake 
River; have pusjied themselves across the Rocky Mountains on the 
southi^ast into the drainage of the Gulf of Mexico, and on the western 
side ()ccu})ied a lai'ge part of southern California as was shown. The 
basket-making tribes are the Shoshoni in Idaho; the Ute, with many 
subdivisions, in C-olorado and Utah; the Paiute in western Nevada 
and Califoinia adjoining. As ])efore intimated, ])oth exclusions and 
inclusions of the term are undefined. 

This grtnit stock of Indians emj)loy 1)oth structures, the woven and 
the coiled. The twined weave of all kinds is used in the conodial 
basket hats, the baskets, jars and bottles, the roasting trays and wands. 
The coiled and whipped structure is used in pitched water bottles, 
trays, and l)owls. The liat is a conical basket made of s])lints, the 
warp I'adiating from the apex, the woof splints being carried around 
and twined in pairs, generally in diagonal weave. The woof is not so 
thoroughly driven home as in softer and more pliant material, but 
remains open so as to have the appearance of the osier weaving of the 
East. Simple ornamentation is produced by using one or more rows 
of red or black splints in elementary geometric patterns. 

Roasting trays are shaped like a scoop rimmed with a large twig. 
The Wiirp is mad(^ of parallel twigs laid (dose together and held in 
place by diagonal twining. The Shoshonean tribes place seeds of wild 
plants in these trays with hot stones, and thus roast them. Some 
specimens are much charred on the ui)per side. In the Ute country 
could be seen Indian women gathering seeds in conical baskets. l)eat- 
ing the heads with a spoon-shaped wand toward the basket held in the 
left hand with its mouth just under the plants. These baskets are con- 
structed in every respect like the conoidal hats and the fans are made 
of twigs coarseh' woven on the same pattern. 

The water bottles of the Shoshonean tribes on the other hand l)elong 
to the coiled and whipped structure. As before mentioned, this style 
can be made coarse or tine, according to the uiaterial and the size of 
the coil and the outer thread. If twigs not of uniform thickness are 
carried around in the coil, the stitch will l)e hatchy and open; but if 
one is larger than the other, or if yucca or other fiber replace the 
upper and narrower sewing material be used, the texture will l)e 
much tiner. These bottles differ in shape — one class has round ])ot- 
toms, another long pointed bottoms; one has wide mouths, another 



490 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

small mouths; one class has a little osier handle on the side of the 
month like a pitcher, ])ut the majority have one or two loops of wood, 
horsehair, or osier fastened on one side for carr^^inj^. All of them 
are quite heavy, having been dipped in pitch. The same form is found 
among the Apache, Mohave, Hopi, and Rio Grande pueblos, but it 
is not improbable that they were obtained from the Ute. These 
bottle-shaped baskets are used for small granaries as well — to hold 
s<>ed !ind keep them away from vermin. 

The basket trays of the Ute do not differ essentially in general 
style from those of the Gila River or California tri])es, but the}' are 
nuich coarser. Among the coiled basket trays in the collection 
accredited to the Ute are indeed two styles, but one of them resemldes 
so nuich those of their Apache neighbors on the south as to raise the 
suspicion that they were obtained by barter.

The typical styles here mentioned, as well as interesting variations, 
will be best understood from examples. 

The National Museum has a rare old collection of Ute or Shoshonean 
material, of which A. H. Tliompson writes that of the l)askets and 
other articles of Indian manufacture gathered by the Powell expedi- 
tions between 1870 and 1876 the greater part, prol^ably nine-tenths, 
were secnired from the Kaivavits at Kaibal) and the Shivwits about 
St. George, southern Utah, and the Moapas al)()ut St. Thomas, south- 
eastern Nevada. These clans all belong to the Paiute Nation. The 
articles secured from the Ute were from the Gosiute al)out Deep 
Creek in western Utah and the Uinta Ute on the Uinta Reservation. 
By far the larger part of the Paiute collection was from the Kaiva- 
vits. Much of the clothing (buckskin and ra])bit fur) and many of 
the baskets were made by the Indians working under the direction or

The warp stems eonverg-e at the top and additional ones are addcnl as 
the texture widens. The weft splints are 
twined so as to inchide the vertical warp 
twigs in pairs. On the next round the 
warp elements are again in<dosed in pairs, 
])ut not in corresponding ones to those of 
the row underneath. The lines of weft 
elements ascend diagonall\" and a twilled 
effect is produced on the surface. This 
form of twining must not be confounded 
with three-ply twine around the border 
which has a somewhat similarappearance, 
])ut is so (dose that the warp stems do not 
show. The l)order of this Ute l»asket is 
ingeniously made. First, the projecting 
warp elements were ])ent and whipped in 
l)lace with splints to form the body of the 
riu): on the top of this the weavei- has 
sewed an ornamental false braid catching 
the splint into the l)ent warp stems under- 
neath. The ornamentation on the outside 
is ])roduced b}' three-strand monochrome 
or dichrome weaving. The Ut(\s are skill- 
ful in various methods of technic. but the 
matei'iais in which they work are coarse 
and rigid, giving a rough appearance to 
the surface. The hats are used also as 
receptacles, so that the terms top and 
bottom are only relative to function.

method of ])eating the ripe grass into a conical carrying basket. The

'Jlie first, tig. 182, represents the entir(» structui-e which is at basis 
open-twined work. The noticeal)le feature about this piece is the 
treatment of the war]), which, instead of rising perpendicularly from 
the ])ottom to the top. is twisted to the left, each radial element of the 
warp making al)out one-fourth of a turn from the vertical. Again, 
the technic is diagonal Aveaving in twined work. The diverting- of the

quite frequently in this area and among this family.

started. Four pairs of wai'p stems constitute the base. These are held 
in i)lace by very coarse twined weaving. The ends of the stems are

In a paper by Dr. George 11. Pepper," attention is called to a cliff 
people formerly living in (Irand Gulch region of southeastern Utah 
called the '"Basket ^Makers."' They are shown to have worn beautiful 
rob(>s of feathers and of ral)l)it skins woven, and sandals of yucca libei' 
s([iiar('d in front, and to ha\e had little or no pottery. They fought 
with "atlatls'' rather than bows, and hunted with the Hopi rabbit 
stick. Most interesting of all, they lived in caves, but not in stone 
houses. In some of the caves the houses of the Cliff Dw^ellers have been 
found overlying the remains of the earlier Basket Makers. Finally, 
the bodies of the dead were doubled up, 
})laced at the bottom of potholes or gran- 
aries, some of which were lined with 
l>aked clay, covered with robes and linally 
with baskets, either several small ones 
or one large carrying basket. The last- 
named feature is said to have been almost 
invuriabl}' in evidence, and it is to this 
that attention is here given. The mate- 
rial is willow, the designs on the baskets 
being in splints of black or a peculiar dull 
red. The bottoms of the carrying baskets 
were reenforced with heavy yucca cord. 
The borders were finished with the ordinary coiled stitch, but in some 
the last inch or two are finished off' with false braid or herringbone. 

One example of Dr. Pepper's, called openwork or sifter basket, has 
a single rod foundation and the wrapping at one turn passes around 
the foundation only; at the next it is drawn under the rod in thf^coi! 
below and returning is wrapped about itself or '"the standing part," 
as the sailors say. The ordinary Japanese lunch baskets, Samoan 
basket work, and those from the Straits of Magellan are on the same 
plan. But it is certainly a rare sight in this part of the world. (See 
Plate 817.) 

Plates 20.5 and 206 are from the Pepper collection of coiled basketry 
from the caves of the ancient Basket Makers. The particular speci- 
mens will be described under separate photographs of each one, but 
the group shows both the forms and functions of the material gathered 
in this interesting localit3^

opportunity to speculate about the relation of this desert region with 
prayers to the water god. 

Plate 208 is another coiled tra}^ from the cave dwellers, with an 
ornamental design, showing two sinuous rings in black. 

Plate 20!) contains two bowls apparently with the three-rod coil; 
such is now common among the best Ixisket makers of California. 
The ornamentation is also suggestive of the same locality. On the 
up})er figure are four radial designs triangular in outline, two having 
their bases at the })ottom and two on the outer border, each pattern 
made up of fringe work of triangles, reminding one of the strings of 
arrowhead patterns mentioned by Dr. Dixon in his pamphlet on the 
Maidu. The lower figure is similarly constructed in coiled weaving, 
the ornamentation being in circular patterns; the bottom is plain; 
then follow narrow rings in ])lack, a broad ring in white, a Inroad 
band with seven triangular rays, a narrow band in black, and a broad 
band in the natural color of the wood. 

Plate 210 is interesting as showing the function of the baskets which 
were found in the Utah cave. All of them have relation to food. 
They" are in twilled and coiled weaving and show how in ancient times 
the basket entered into the service of these agricultural Indians,

coiled weaving on splint foundation. It is not possible to determine 
the material of the stitches. It is lo inches in diameter and '4^ inches 
deep. The interior is coated with meal and the surface of tbe sewing- 
is worn through from long iise. Mortar baskets are common among 
the California tribes, both in twined weaving and in coiled work. A 
specimen quite similar to the one here shown in the U. S. National 
Museum has a coiled basket top, cemented to the shallow mortar stone 
underneath l)y means of pitch. The specimens are in the collection of 
the American Museum of Natural History. 

Pepper describes four varieties of sandals among the ancient Cliff 
Dwellers — thin soles in twilled Aveaving from narrow leaves of j'ucca; 
those made of broad leaves split; a padded variety made from the same 
leaves shredded; and an exceedingly fine kind, of spun fiber and worked 
into'clegant patterns. In these last the warp is in two or more layers 
or plies, so that the body is thick and durable. He quotes Richard 
Witherill to the effect that while the chamber-building Cliff" Dwellers 
wove the sandal with pointed toes and a jog or step a few inches from 
the toe, those of the Basket Makers were square in front. McLoyd 
and Graham " assert that square-toed sandals were made by the people 
that inhabited the underground rooms, since they are found only with

The term Puehlo l)asi^etmaker is far from speeitic. It applies to 
women of all the settled villag-es in New Mexico and Arizona, f lom Taos 
on the Kio (Irande, in the former, to the Hopi in Arizona. The peo- 
ples l)elon,u- to the Tanoan and Keresan families on the Kio (irand(>, to 
the Zunian in western New Mexico, and the Hopian or Shoshonean in 
Arizona." 

Far hack in time those structures whose ruins furnish inexhaustible 
supplies of pottery and some textih's have to tell the tale as to the 
ancient types of basketry. At the present moment oreut confusion 
exists concerning the ethnic signiticance of })asketry in the pueblos. 
Beautiful old pieces came twent}' years or more ago from these tillages 
about which there is little information. James Stevenson wrote then 
that the women of the villages were fond of si^curing in trade and 
hoarding rare forms and weaves. The l)est that can ]>e now done is to 
classify ruel)lo basketry as follows: 

(1) What the women are actually making and old material precisely 
like it. 

(2) vSpecimens dug from sites of old pueblos and carefully labeled. 

(0) Old matei'ials stored up in the modern puebk)s, handed down 
from the past, whose authorship is not known. 

If all this material could be assembled a variety of technical proc- 
esses would be revealed, some of them common over wide areas and 
a few characteristic of the pueblo culture. The following weaves are 
among the list: 

(1) Checker weaving, rare. 

{'2) Wicker weaving, coarse and line. 

(3) Twilled work, in hard stems and in 3'ucca. 

(4) Twined work of many kinds on old baskets. Thought to be 
intrusive. 

(5) Coiled work with foundation of stems, splints, grass, and 
shredded leaves. The tine wicker and the thick coiled phKiues are 
peculiar. The great variety mentioned is (piite as much between 
pueI)los as ])etween these and tribes outside. The Hopi are note- 
worth}' in this regard, having in their hands the making of the two 
imique kinds of weave in their sacred meal plaques. A better insight 
into these dift'erences will be gained ])y an examination of specimens.

mens are the following: The foundation i.s of splints, the sewino- is 
done with willow or rhus, and the stitches are just l)arely carried 
around a small portion of the foundation underneath where they are 
interlocked. Note also that th(^ oi'iianientation — an ascending- .spiral — 
is in one case a rhombic figure and in the other is built up of little 
rectangles formed b}^ counting stitches, which may be few or many, 
as the curve on the body of the basket expands or contracts. This 
mingling of very simple elementary forms is capable of an infinite 
variety in treatment. 

The attention of the student is especially called to the margins of 
these baskets, which appear to be in a three-strand plait; but the}^ are 
really done in a single splint which passes backward over the founda- 
tion, then under and forward, inclosing the rod underneath, forming 
a tigure of 8, and the multiplication of this produces on the surface 
the braided appearance. , For detail, see page 276, hg. 87. Catalogue

Although there may be seen at the pueblo of Zufii all sorts of 
baskets, the most of them include pitched bottles for water, coiled and 
whipped tra3's, Hopi-coiled and wicker-basket trays, but it is not to 
])e understood that they Avere necessarily made there. The only work 
made by the Zuni nowadays is their small, rough peach baskets, of 
twigs and wickerwork, hardly worthy of notice except for their ugli- 
ness and simplicity. Those who are familiar with this intei'esting 
tribe of Indians say that trading is a passion with them, and that 
through their agricultural products and their retined loom work they 
are able to gratify this taste among the surrounding tribes for old 
basketry. 

Plate 213 shows some old so-called Zuni ware, collected for the 
Bureau of American Ethnology b}^ James Stevenson in New Mexico 
long ago. 

Fig. 1 is a wicker basket, globular form. The warp consists of a 
num])er of stems of OIiry-sotha)iinu>i laid flat. The weft of the same 
material is in wickerwork, the border being fastened down in coiled 
sewing with yucca leaf. Handle, a rawhide thong. Used ])v these 
Indians in gathering fruit and other food substances. Height, 8 inches. 
Cat. No. 68603, U.S. N.M. 

Fig. 2 is a jar-shaped basket of Chrysotharmius {Bigelovlo) splints. 
The warp is radiating at the bottom and parallel on the body; the 
whole basket is made in twilled style of twined weaving over two. 
The border is not finished off. The handle is a rawhide thong around 
the neck. This is a very coarse specimen of twined work. The 
height is 8 inches. Cat. No. 68480, U.S.N.M. 

Fig. 3 is a rare and interesting specimen of twined basket jar. 
The bottom has radiating warp and is in coarse twilled weaving, but 
the body from the bottom to the upper margin is plain, twined weav-

ino-, without variation. There is not in the National Muscimi collec- 
tion from this Puehlo reg-ion another })a8ket in which the whole body 
is ti-eated in this monotonous manner. Its height is Si inches. Cat. 
No. »;s.5i3, U.S.N. M. 

Fig. 4 is a water-tight jar from the Zuni Indians. The whole sur- 
face of the object is in twilled type of twined weaving and well satu- 
rated in pitch. The characteristic feature is the lugs of wood on the 
side for the carrying- strap, and llattening of the surface l)etween these 
lugs, as in a canteen. This is partially shown in the photographs, but 
is quite apparent on the jar itself. Its height is 9 inches. Cat. No. 
6Sr>1.5, U.S.N.M. 

Fig. 5 is a water- tight ])asket jar constricted in the middle for the 
attachment of a carrying- strap. The whole surface is in coarse 
twilled weaving in two-strand twine with the exception of one row be- 
tween the l)ottom and the body, which is in three-strand. The constric- 
tion of the body is said to be an imitation of a custom of tying- rag- 
around the 3"oung- gourd so as to stop its growth, which results in a 
moditication, useful for holding the carrying strap. Its height is 
y inches. Cat. No. 6851:1, U.S.N.M. 

Fio-. is a water-tight basket iar from the Zuiii Indians, symmetrical 
in outline. It is in the twilled type of twined weaving, with wooden 
lugs on the side and no flattening of surface between them. Its height 
is Ti inches. Cat. No. 6S502, U.S.N.M. 

Fig-. 7 is a gathering basket from the Zuni Indians. The weaving 
on the bottom and the body is in the twilled type of twined work; 
the neck, on the contrar}^ has about an inch of plain twined weaving 
and is finished oti' with four rows of three-strand twine. The border 
is in coiled sewing of yucca. This specimen, like the preceding, is 
made from the stems of Chrj/sothammis. Its height is 7t inches. Cat. 
No. 68491, U.S.N.M. 

Fig. 8 is a gathering- basket from the Zuni Indians. The bottom is 
in twilled twined work; the body is in plain twined work relieved at 
varying- distances with single rows of three-ply weaving; border fin- 
ished oti' with coiled work in yucca. Its height is 6 inches. 

The Zuni pueblos in western New Mexico lie in the very heart of 
the desert region. On the east are the Kio (irande pue))los, on the 
northwest the Moki, and far to the south the Gila River. Beside 
the settled communities long inhabiting- this region, the Navaho and 
Apache are close at hand on every side, and the Utes are not far away. 
There is no surprise, therefore, in finding on the same plate illustra- 
tions of wicker work, twined work in its many varieties of plain 
twilled and three-strand work, and all of these at times on the same 
piece of basketr3\

A jar-shaped coiled basket attributed ])y the collector to the Zufii 
Indians is shown in tig.. 189. It is a very beautiful and smooth piece 
of coiled ware, to which justice is not done by the drawing. In reg-u- 
larity of stitch, symmetrical shape, and ornamentation it is almost 
without fault. It belongs to the class of technic termed in this treatise 
lod and welt. The fou^idation consists of a single rod, over which is 
laid a thin splint, perhaps of the same material. The stitch passes 
over rod and welt in the row that is in progress of manufacture, and 
not only locks with the stitch underneath but in each case takes up 
tiie welt. This forms an excellent packing. The stitches are crowded 
so closely together that in the original those of the different rows lie 
practically one over the other, with a slight inclination from the per- 
pendicular. On the bottom, not shown here, it has a circle in black 
from which radiates six spiral rays. On the bod}^ the ornamentation 
is as shown in the iigur(\ It is made from the pod of Marfynia Jonh- 
idiKt. On the shoulder two lugs of leather are sewed for the purpose 
of carrying the jar, ))eing intended, doubtless, for the transportation 
of food or water. It is customary to attribute such ware to the 
Apache Indians, although in the National Museum there are quite a 
number of Aery old coiled jars of this type and tine workmanship 
purporting- to come from the Zufii Indians. This specimen was got- 
ten by iVIajor Powell, one of the most careful collectors, so that there 
is no doubt of the location. It is possible, however, that the Zufii, 
since thev are potters, may have acquired this coiled specimen in 
traffic. 

The detail of this texture, both in its sewing and ornamentation, is 
illustrated in tig. 48, also bj^ Gushing".

pUuiues are from Mushongunuvi, Shipaulovi, and Shumopavi, all on

Wicker baskets are made at the Hopi pueblo, Oraibi. The radiat- 
ing franu^work is of slender shoots of siibi, RJniH frUolxifa. The 
interwoven element is of branches of hanoshivapi, C'/tri/.s(>t/i<(miius 
(/mreofchs^ also called Bigeloiu'a, carefulh^ smoothed and d3'^ed, as in the 
coiled l)askets, red brown, red, yellow, dark blue, purple, green, 
blue and white, the latter with kaolin. 

The white of the background is applied after the basket is tinished. 
The edge of the basket is tinished with a Avinding of yucca over the 
several rods of rhus bent down after the basket has reached the size 
required. This edge is often painted with red ocher (Hough). The 
framework consists of two cross sets of twigs, four or more in a bar 
of the cross. These are lirmly held together at their intersection by 
weaving. The}" are then spread out radially, the space ))eing from 
time to time sui)plemented by additional stems. The worker pro- 
vides herself with bunches of white, yellow, orange, purple, black, 
blue, and green twigs only a few inches in length. These she proceeds 
to weave into patterns of the greatest beauty, even imitating cloud 
ert'ects seen on Japanese screens, using long or short twdgs as the 
occasion demands, hiding the ends between the ribs and the filling of 
the preceding coils. (See Plate 21G.) 

The variety of ornament created with these i)oor appliances is 
mar\elous. In no other tribe of Indians and in no other type of 
basketr}^ are more striking eft'ects realized. It seems almost as 
though the women had set themselves the problem of producing with 
the least ])liable materials the icost versatile of eft'ects, in which are

from the pictograph to the mere conventional mathematical scene 
Both, however, represent the same ideas. Lender the influence of 
ti-ade the ancient patterns are really mosaics and could ])o picked out. 
It will be easily seen that the figures on th(> l)ack and fi-ont do not 
exactly conform, the corresponding square on the back being always 
one space to the right or left of the same in front. 

Attention is called at this point to the ornamental l)eginning of the 
wicker plaque, or sacred meal baskets. In the chapter on structure 
attention is directed to the methods of holding the central warp stems 
together before bending them apart radially. Two methods are 
resorted to. On one, half a dozen or more stems are laid side by side 
and wrapped together by a process shown in fig. 38, after Miss 
White. The same number of stems are similarly joined and laid 
under this at right angles, the whole twelve being bound together by 
one or two rows of wicker weaving. From this central point the 
twelve or more wrapped stems are bent apart at equal distances and 
the regular wicker weaving proceeds. At a certain distance outward 
new warp stems are added between each pair of those already in use, 
and from this circle the weaving proceeds to the margin. 

With the same number of warp stems quite a different process is 
sometimes employed, by which the two sets of the upper and lower 
are held together in pairs by wicker weaving, and at an inch from the 
center the whole series are bound together as before and widening and 
weaving proceed in the same manner. 

Fig. IIH) is a coarse wicker tray of the Hopi Indians of northeastern 
Arizona, and is introduced for the purpose of illustrating the method 
in which the nuich finer work on the sacred meal trays is done. Here 
may be seen the plan of starting out with a few stems crossing each 
other at right angles for warp; the method of hiding the large end of 
the weft stems to ])ecome a portion of the warp, and the method of 
adding new warp stems as they are needed. Fspecial attention is 
called to the way in which several stems for weft are introduced at the 
same time and worked along in sets or series. The common method 
of working out the twill would be to introduce a weft stem, carry it 
as far as it would go, and th(>n insert a ncnv weft stem, but in this 
cas(» the series of half a dozen stems are all worked at the same time. 
(V)mpare description of a Mexican wicker basket, on page 527. 

The modern twilled basketry is as rough as it can be. The same is 
true of the fiat mats used about their dwellings; in fact, the mat and 
the basket are identical in weaving. The ])asket is formed hy bending 
the mat over the edge of a hoop and sewing down with a row of 
twined weaving.

of mending a broken strand. The corn, the mixture of objects belong- 
ing to civilization and savagery, the homespun and woven clothing on 
herself, and the maiden at her side are all a study in the culture of 
the region. The ado})e and stone wall and the coarse beams of wood 
inset must be included. It is an excellent picture of very little modi- 
fied savage life. Yucca baskets and trays are made ])y the Hopi in 
plain checker; although the material is coarse, quite pleasing effects 
are produced ])y means of the two sides of leaf and different shades 
of the same size.

is enough dissimilarity of form to give the Hopi the credit of invent- 
ing this peculiar style. (See Plate 218, figs, -i and 7.) 

Plate 218 shows a collection from Oraibi, the westernmost of the 
Hopi pueblos in northeastern Arizona, gath(>red ])y Colonel James Ste- 
venson and Cosmos Mindelefl'. The three types of work always in 
mind when Oraibi and the pueblos of the adjoining mesa are men- 
tioned, to wit, twilled, thick coils, and wicker, are utterly wanting 
here. The cosmopolitan character of the Hopi is further attested by 
the varieties of technic in the plate. The baskets on the upper row

Di". J. Walter Fewkes was so fortunate as to recover from the 
Chevlon I'uin, 15 miles from Winslow and in sight of the station 
Hardy on the Santa Fe Railroad, fragments of ancient l)ask(4ry, 
shown in the acconipanj'ing- plates. The custom of burying baskets 
with the dead is still preserved in the Tusa^-an towns, and from the 
specimens here figured, it has ))een inherited from ancient times. 
Baskets, says Fewkes, are not now made at the east mesa, and the 
craft is contined to the middle mesa and Oraibi.

The wicker baskets from several gi-aves at Chevlon were identical 
with those made to-day in the pueblo of Oraibi. Some of these spec- 
imens were painted on the surface a green color with malachite, or 
blue with azurite. In other examples the small stems had been 
stained before they were woven. Plate 21!t represents a segment from 
a wicker basket made from the stems of O/u'i/sothaninus graveolens. 
The warp consists of small l)undles of stems; the weft, of the same 
material barked and smoothed down, in some places dyed. The inter- 
esting feature of the specimen is the increasing of the lumiber of 
warp elements as the l)asket erdargcs. At first in the drawing there 
are live ])undles of stems; about 2 inches lower down the number is

increased to seven, and near the bottom, ]\y iho introduction of new 
stems, ten warp elements are provided for. As in tiie modei-n l)asketrv, 
in this ancient example the weft is soaked and woven in tiiat condition 
and i)ressed home so ert'ectually that the warp is invisible. 

In Plate 220, tio-. 1, is shown a specimen of ancient matting- in twilled 
weavino-. The work is done in split yuccii leaves, just as to-day, 
and in certain places the tigure shows where the leaf was stripped 
from the stalk. Kxaminino- the thousands of mats and soft ])askets 
from the sam(> pueblo reveals the identical method of doing the 
twilled work. t)ut in a yreat many of the modern examples regular 
diaper patterns are introduced. In the same plate (tig. 3) is an ancient 
example of coiled basketry, having foundation of three stems or rods. 
Bv referring to the California l)asketry it will be seen that this foun- 
dation is the same. This makes a very smooth surface, easily distin- 
guishable from the rugose condition of Apache ])asket built on a 
single rod." 

These specimens are Catalogue Nos. 157012, loTDl;"). 157018 in the

Plates 221, 222 illustrate the forms and uses of basketry in the 
pueblos of northeastern Arizona before the coming of the whites. 
The explorations of Dr. J. Walter Fewkes in Sikyatki and Awatobi, 
and the Museum-Uates expedition in lOOl to examine two ruins on the 
-letyto Wash, a few miles from Keams Canyon, ha\'e bi-ought to light 
wicker, twilled, and coiled basketry. The wickerwork is precisely 
identical with the little wicker trays or phupies made in the pueblo 
of Oraibi and used in their religious ceremonies. The twilled work 
is the matting of to-day, and the coiled resembles that of the Utes or 
Pimas rather than the Apaches, having a foundation not of rods, Init 
of line material. The uses of the basketry nuist ha\e been in all 
respects as among the Hopis of our day. but Plate 223 shows the 
connection of such material with the care of the dead (Catalogue No. 
213074). The plate illustrates the fact that coarse wicker matting 
was placed in the ])ottom of the grave; on this was laid a matting 
of yucca liber, and on this was deposited the body. In the dressing 
of the hair, then as now, a plaited cord of human hair was employed. 
A description of its discovery appears in Dr. Walter Hough's paper, 
Archeological Field Work in Northeastern Arizona, 

Judging from the artifacts secured by the Museum-Crates expedi- 
tion, these pueblos belong to the type of Awatobi and Sityatki,,and, as 
fai' as appearances go, may have been contemi)oraneous. Dr. Fewkes 
regards Sityatki as one of the most ancient pueblos of the Hopi group. 
It is well known that Awatobi was inhabited up to the year 1700, but

ATHAPASCAN BASKETRY 

A summary of Atha])ascan basketr\' in its etlinic areas would include 
the foUowino- : 

The northern Athapascans in the interior of Alaska and in the 
Mackenzie drainage make coiled ])asketry in a variety of types, the 
material being willow and root of the conifers. The Pacific coast group, 
living formerly in Washington, Oregon, and northwestern California, 
near the sea, of which the Hupas are the best known, excel in twined 
work with decoration in overlaying, but these tribes have not the ver- 
satility of the Pomo, farther south. All the weaving is of one variety , 
well known in the region. 

The southern Athapascans, under many names, practice both coiled 
and twined basketr^^ The}^ base their coiled work on hard stems and 
sew them with splints of cottonwood, mulberry, sumac, and willow or 
strips of yucca. They also used agave tiber. 

The mescal plant {Agave amerlccma), says Bourke, is to the Apache 
what the palm is to the East. It is baked in ovens for victuals and its 
juice is fermented to make a drink. For the basket maker the thorns 
are good needles, the fibers excellent thread material, and the flower 
stalk forms the frame of the carrying outfit. 

The Apaches or southern Athapascan basket makers were formerly 
spread over eastern Arizona, western New Mexico, and in Texas along 
the Rio Grande, as wnll be seen in PowelFs linguistic map.'' The}" 
were gathered on reservations by Gen. Nelson A. Miles. Scattered 
bands are to be found here and there. Mr. James mentions one near 
Short Horn Mountains and in the neighborhood of Palomas and Agua 
Caliente, comprising about thirty families of basket makers. The 
collector or student must not be surprised, therefore, if in the hands 
of Apaches are seen work of other tribes. Indeed, he will frequently 
see the women borrowing materials, structures, forms, and even designs 
from outside. A large and varied collection of Apache ware is exhibited 
in the Free Museum of Phoenix, Arizona, collected bv Messrs. Benham. 

On the authority of Mrs. J. S. Newman there are live tribes on 
the Apache Reservation, and a few scattered members of other tribes, 
but five to class as basket makers. Of these the Tonto should rank 
fii-st, making chietiv oUas, which require more skill than plaques or 
bowl shapes, and their work is universally even and good. Their

specimens are nearly always marked with the arrow pt)int, the pattern 
running- vertically from the center. Their proriciency is accounted 
for in the fact that the land allowed them on the (J ila River is the 
least productive of any on the reservation, hence their dependence 
on basket makino- for a living-. 

The center or l)eg-innino- of either Apache coiled bowl or olla is 
always wrapped with l)lack (devil claw) and the rim finished with the 
same stitch as that used throughout the body of the work, both or 
either colors l)eing used. 

Plate 224 is a nund>er of Apache coiled ])owls belonging- to the col- 
lection of J. W. Benham. The foundation is in whoh^ stem and the 
sewing done with splints of white wood and maftyina. A compari- 
son of these ten pieces reveals tolerably well the genius of Apache 
decorations. There are discrete figures of men and beasts; there are 
both radial and concentric designs; in the crenelated (tig, 10) and 
fretted motives (tigs. 5 and '.)) suggestions arise which point to the 
Tulare area. The Apache, naturally a wanderer, has picked up here 
a little and there a little of design. 

The White Mountain Apaches are clustered around Camp Apache, 
the agency, and on two of the lai-ge creeks running- south from the 
Mogollon mesa. The art of basket making is not actively practiced 
at ])resent, the younger members of the tribe finding- it difficult to 
learn and saying that it injures their hands. Some of the old women, 
however, retain the ancient skill, and even superior work may be 
secured from the reservation. It nniy he said that the carrying baskets 
and the pitched watcu- bottles arc as freijuently made as ever and are 
in constant use, when^as the tiner l)owls, which were formerly connnon, 
as among the Pueblo tribes, for storing meal, etc., are growing rarer 
every year and conunand high prices.

The specimens were collected by Dr. Walter Hough on White 
Mountain Apache Reservation, 1(»0 miles south of Holbrook, Aiizona. 
The syml)ol is that of the martynia hooks, the sharp points having 
been allowed to project from the inner surface in certain areas. 

The shoots for basket material are gathered in the spring, tied in 
bundUi's. and put away in the houses for future use, sometimes with 
the hark on, at others without. When tht; basket maker is readv the 
osiers are soaked thoroughly in water; the stems are employed whole 
for the foundation of the coil, and the sewing is done oni}^ with the 
outer layer, tho inner ])()rtions being peeled ofi' and the splints scraped. 
One end is held in the mouth, the other in the left hand, whiie the 

steel knife, formerly the 
stone knife, is used in the 
right hand. 

The ornamentation on 
all this basketry is in 
Martynia lomslana^ or 
devil's claw (Tahuate), 
the design itself often 
being the figure of the 
plant. The awl used in 
the sewing is called b\'

Fig. 192 shows the or- 
namentation on a coiled basket bowl of the Coyotero, on the San 
Carlos Agency, in southern Arizona. The parts are in threes; the 
smaller design is made up of a combination of little squares and tri- 
angles, the larger design being more comj)licated in its elements, with 
its three vase-shaped parts, which terminate in the dark circle of the 
center. The meaning of this design is ind^nown.

Dr. Hough, long ago by the Mescalero Apache, before they adopted 
the present wide variety. The foundation of the coil consists of a

Fig. 19-1: is a design on a coiled basket l)<)wl of the Apache. The 
foundation of the bowl is the rod-and-splint pattern, and the sewing 
passes over it, under the splints of the coil below, the stitches inter- 
locking. The design is in ^fartytua loiilxHina. The apparently 
uns\^stematic ornamentation is, in eli'ect, perfectly regular. Four 
lines of black stitching, of the same lengths in each, proceed from a 
black ring around the center. From the ends of these lines the sew- 
ing is to the left in regular curves. The four radiating lines are 
repeated and then the curved lines until the border is reached. The 
suggestion of lightning or the limbs of some insect has been made out. 
The design has not been explained by an}- basket maker.

This .specimen, Catalogue No. 21493 in the U. S. National Museum, 
was collected in Arizona by Dr. J. B. White, U. S. Army. 

Plate 227 represents a jar and a plaipie by the Mescalero Apache 
Indians of New Mexico, collected by Dr. Walter Hough, Catalogue 
Nos. 204651 and 204646 in the U. S. National Museum. Especial 
attention is directed to the width of the coils in these baskets. It 
will be remembered that the Fraser River tribes in British Columbia 
obtained an economical result of widening coils by the introduction 
of narrow strips of wood instead of the roots or bundles of grass for 
the foundation. These Apache Indians have also discovered that using 
two or more rods, one lying on the top of the other, would give the 
same result. The stitches in yucca also, instead of passing underneath 

another rod in the coil be- 
low, are simply interlocked 
with the stitches under- 
neath. The ornamentation 
is produced l)y dift'erent 
colors of thesame substance. 
The outside of the leaf is 
green in diti'erent shades, 
l)ut the inside of the split 
leaf is perfecth' white. ]^y 
exposing the inside or the 
outside the angular orna- 
mentation results. In such 
wide foundation the designs 
must be verj" simple. The 
dark lines in the lower figure 
are produced by using the 
small roots of the same i)lant 
in sewing. This fiber is very 
nnich more bj'ittle than the 
leaf. Comparing these two 
examples with the plaipies of the Plopi Indituis (hmionstrates better 
than any other figures yet employed the limitations of the basket maker 
in the very elements of ornamentation. Kach separate part of the 
mosaic is a long stitch, set vertically in the jai' and radially on the 
platpu^ or bowl. From this the basket maker can not (>scape.

of C. M. O'Leary, of Abbottsford Inn, Los Angeles, California, the 
Navaho do not manufacture baskets; but they use a ceremonial basket 
that is made by the Apaches and comes from Arizona. Other observ- 
ers attribute these curious pieces to the Ute; but old Navaho women 
still understand the art.

In this example the foundation is a single rod. The ])ody color 
of the bowl is that of the wood. The ornamentation is in splints of rhus 
d\'ed mahogany brown and l)lack, and consists of four quadrants 
in each of which is a cross-shaped figure. The boundary of the space 
is black, tilled in with ])rown. The figure is in the color of the 
wood and has a black border. In the sewing the stitches simply 
interlock with those underneath. The border of the specimen is 
worthy of study, being what is called elsewhere false braid. The

pas.sino- l)y a " fisj-ure of eight" movement under the foundation and 
over the outer margin. In the ancient days a Navaho woman invented 

this pretty l)order. She was seated 
undci- a juniper tree finishing' her 
work in the old, plain way, when 
the god Hastseyath threw a small 
spray of juniper into her basket. 
Happy thought! She imitated the 
fold of the leaves on the border 
and the invention was complete.

The decoration also of the Navaho 
baskets is in designs taking the form 
of ])ands for their sacred drums 
(fig. 196), and of crosses (fig. 195) for their sacred meal baskets. The 
colored bands on the drums are founded on a central stripe which

may be lig-nt or dark, and from the borders i^roject variously notched 
or ang'ular tio-ures. The one characteristic to which attention is always 
directed in this ware is the break in the band. It is mentioned else- 
where on the authority of Matthews that a line drawn from the center 
of the basket through this open pathway will end at the point where 
the basket was linished otf, and when it is used as a drum tiiis is the 
point where the hand of the medicine man must ])e placed in tlie 
plaque, the radial line pointing eastward. Anothtn- interpretation of 
tliis, which can not here be proven, is that this l)reak in the orna- 
mentation has something to do with the passing })ackward and forward 
of the spirit of the liasket, as in the Pueblo potter}^ decoration." (See 
%s. VM) and 197.) 

l^r. Ales Hrdlicka writes that the l)asket work of the Hualapai 
and Havasupai can ])e studied better l)y having it understood that 
although both these peoples are associated with the Yuman famil}' 
linguistically, they are decidedly one with the Apaches in physical 
characteristics. Their basketry, therefore, will have to be compared 
with that of the Apaches and not that of the Mission Indians of 
southern California, who are Yuman. The foundation is a solid stem 
with a welt. The sewing is done with splints of willow, and also now 
with those made from the young and tender suckers from the cotton- 
wood tree, from 2 to o feet in length. The geometric ornamentation 
is in martynia. Among the Hualapai and Havasupai there are three 
kinds of baskets — that is, three forms exist, but the IIa\'asupai are the 
best workwomen. The tirst is coarse coiled ware. When the twining 
is going on they lea^'e the linished ends projecting outside and inside 
until the whole basket is completed and afterwards they are trimmed 
otf all at the same time. The second is a plain coiled bowl in the shape 
of a caraffe, covered with pitch to make it water-tight. The third is 
decorated coiled work. The tirst is a plaque with l)lack decoration 
in martynia only. The second shape is more or less cylindrical, or 
the rim turning in or tending toward a spherical form. In the 
plaque there is seldom any other decorative color than black, but the 
other forms, cylindrical r.nd globose, have various colors, although 
mostly different shades of i'3d. The designs are tooth-shaped or den- 
tated, star-shaped, and crer lated. No curved lines or animal forms 
are used. The Hualapai ako make conical carrying baskets with a 
head-band, the decorations bsiug meager and consist only of lines, no 
geometric figures being used. Occasionally designs are painted, not 
woven. (See Plate 229.) 

Plate 230, fig. 2, represents a Havasupai coiled l)asket bowl. The 
foundation is of rods and splints of willow and the sewing is the same. 
The most interesting feature is the border. It is false In-aid in which two 
rows of the coil are involved. A single splint passes down and includes

both foundations, up, over, and under the upper foundation only, then 
back and under l)oth to the point of beginning. This is an old speci- 
men, had been in the possession of a family for many years. From 
theSichomovi (Hopi) Pueblo, made l)y the Havasupai (Yuman) Indians, 
collected by Dr. Walter Hough. 

Plate 231 represents the Havasupai basket maker at her home, which 
is in Cataract Canj^on emptying into th(> Colorado liiver from the 
south, in northwestern Arizona. The most interesting feature of this 
phite is the association of the baski^t maker with her home. The steep 
wall of the canyon forms the back of the house, and a slight ])rush 
awning covered with grass is hei" shelter. So far as the house is con- 
cerned, we are as near to the lowest sa\'age and primitive man as it is 
possible to get, but in the woman and her work we are on the top 
round of savagery. The Apache-Yuma basket makers at Palomas, 
Arizona, sit in front of their brush and stniw shelt(M-s tho same as the 
Pimas, hold the right side of the ])la([U(^ or bowl inwaid, and work 
their sewing toward the left hand. (C. C. Simms, Field ( -olumbiau 
Museum.) In the previous plate the woman is making coiled basketry, 
l)ut in the one here given by George Wharton James the bottlt^ and the 
carrying l)askets are in twilled or diagonal-twined weaxing. 

The Walapai, spelled often Ilualapai. fi'om Walla, tall })ine, Pai, 
people, are also of thc^ Yuman family and dwell near '^ri'uxton. Hack- 
berry, and Kingman, in northern Arizona. There are less than 600 
of them. They make water jars of several shapes and many sizes; 
household buskets and phupies, never decorated, often covtu'ed with 
pitch on the inside, always shallow; more or less cylindrical baskets with 
geometric designs in martynia, rarely painted ))luish, red or white on 
the outside; the same with bail-like hajulles; great conical carrying 
baskets, sparingly decorated; small plaques, tiner work, splints dyed; 
baby boards, and fanciful shajK^s. These are coiled on the rod and 
splint foundation and resemble Apache. Basketr}" terms are: 

Wi-uat we-se-ma, prepared root of yucca, of l)rownish-red color. 

Ma-k-tu-na, red roots of a little plant on the moimtains. 

K-he-e, or K-he-e-he-vah, reeds used for vertical ribs, also white or 
green fiber. 

Ma-tha-kigh, reed for making bal)v boards, hoods, also for warps 
of baskets. An example was collected b\' Dr. Hrdlicka, ornanuMited 
with triangles and crenelated lines in pink and black. 

The Mohave Indians (Yuman famil}) do not make baskets, but obtain 
them from other tribes, and examples will be found in every house. 
The}^ obtain their rabbit-skin robes, done in twined weaving, from 
Paiutes (Shoshonean family) and Walapai (Yuman family). The 
Mohaves make constant use of the wrapped weaving. (See page 231,

The foundation is a rod and the sewing- is done Avith wiUow or other 
splints, niaylx^ cottonwood. The l)lack figures are in the pods of mar-

Kspecial attention is called to the ])urely geo

lines, i-hombs in bands, crtMKdated and ser- 
rated lines in great vari<'ty. In the central 
figure the middU^ band i-ecalls the design, a 
modification of which becomes the well-known 
flying l)iu,terfly pattern. (See Plate V,)^.)

The Piman bask(>try is unmistakable. The 
foundation is of split cat-tail stems {TtjpJta 
aiKjiisftfoHa) and the sowing is with willow 
[Sdlt.i- ii!(/i'(() and pods of martynia, but the 
stitches are so fine and the work so uniform 
that the surface is not rugose but smooth. The 
Pima decoration is the exuberance of fretwork. In the National Museum 
are many old pieces brought home by Army officers. Edward Palmer 
also collected many, and recently Dr. Frank Russell has enriched the col- 
lections with material which will be the subject of a special monograph. 
Coiled work without foundation finds aj)plication among the Pima in 
the network which supports their g-ourd receptacles. (See fig-. IDS.) 

It has })een said that basket making w^as introduced among the Pima 
one hundred years ago, when the Maricopa sought shelter among them 
from the slaughter of the Yuma. At that time the Pima made pot- 
tery only. On the other hand, the Maricopa allowed basket making 
to fall into disuse, and now make pottery only. Both Pima and 
Papago make matting in twilled work, and also carrying fnuues cov- 
ered with rude coiled lace.

They had no pails or vessels of wood, but were not slow to invent. They there- 
fore took willows, which grow in abundance along the river, and a reed, and 
stripped the bark, then very adroitly split these with their teeth and wove them so 
closely together as to hold water. This they accomplished by means of needles or 
thorns of cactus, of which there are over one hundred varieties in this territory. 
They used these baskets while digging small ditches, the women filling them with 
earth and carrying them up the bank." 

Catalogue No. 76033, U. S. National Museum (see fig. 100), is a carrying 
basket (ehikrs) of the Pima Indians, a pyramidal bag netted of the fiber 
of the agave; at th(> vertex is an opening 3 inches in diameter. The 
base is attached to a hoop by a string of agave fiber, with which the 
hoop is served; the bag is decorated with fretted work painted black 
and red. Two stems of the Cereus glganteus^ 34i inches long and one- 
half inch in diameter, are passed from the outside of the hoop to the 
inside of the hag, 1<» inches apart, thence down till they pass through 

the opening in the vertex; 
at this point thej^ cross each 
other at an acute angle and 
extend 7i inches beyond; 
two other stems 14 inches 
h)ng are passed into the 
])ag. in front, in the same 
way, 9 inches apart, and 
their ends stop at the cross- 
ing of the other sticks; at 
this point the four are 
firmly hished together and 
the margin of the bag at 
the vertex opening is fas- 
tened to the sticks. 
Where the sticks enter the hag the hoop is tied to them by ji cord 
of black liorsehair; these also serve to tie the load in tlie basket. 
Near the bottom a small brace of wood is passed through the meshes 
of the bag and in front of the sticks on either side, to give it additional 
strength. A jjiece of matting of split reeds, 16 by 7 inches, is attached 
to the ])ack of the ])asket to protect tlie l)ody of the carrier; a pad of 
cloth is placed l)etween the basket and matting for the same purpose. 
A strong cord of twisted agave fiber, 3 feet long, is looped around 
the vertex; the ends passed along the posterior sticks, outside the bag, 
are fastened to the sticks by a loop of fiber. Above, the ends are 
attached to the forehead ])and, woven from the softened fil)er of the

vertical lines start from the black bottom. At uniform distances from 
the beginning all the way out to the rim horizontal lines proceed to 
the left, terminating in small black squares. It can easily be seen that, 
while the vertical lines are narrow and depend upon the width of the 
stitches, the horizonal lines must necessarily be as wide as the rows of 
sewing. About two-thirds of the way from the beginning a new set 
of zigzags are started, and these are continued to the outer margin.

it is systematically done for the purpose of ornamentation, as is the

MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICA 

This genius [Clothd] led tlie souls first to cloths, and drew them within the revolution of the spindle 
impelled by the hand. — Plato's Republic. 

On the ))order line between the Kepu])lic of Mexico and the United 
States is a transition between the standard forms which have hitherto 
been studied and the more open types of lace work and loom work. 
Coiled basketry of well-known varieties continues on .southward, both 
in the lowlands and in the mountainous regions to within a few miles of 
the City of Mexico. Variations from these types are also in evidence, 
both coiled and twined, the former predominating. Foundations of 
grass more than an inch thick are built into immense baskets for carry- 
ing and also granaries, the sewing being done with wide strips of ])ark, 
wood, and leaves. Taking these coarse baskets for a motive, smaller 
and finer ones are done in better material, but still the stitches are half 
an inch apart. There is no occasion for surprise in this, since the linguis- 
tic families which are represented in Arizona, New Mexico, and Cali- 
fornia are also continued into the Republic of Mexico. In this area the 
student is clearly "within the revolution of the spindle.'' In addition 
to the coiled work just mentioned will l)e found coiling of the hammock 
type, and, interesting to know, the Chippewa on Lake Superior and 
the Loucheux type on the Mackenzie River are here reproduced in the 
carrying basket (see fig. 106). Starting out from very plain, coarse 
varieties of this work, it passes on into the lace-work burden baskets 
of the Pima, Papago, and Mohave. The figures wrought into these 
lace-work baskets are the same as are to be seen in the labyrinthian 
patterns on the basket bowls of the Pima. Quite as interesting as 
an}^ of these types, the wrapped weaving before described is found in 
burden baskets of the Mohave. It must be recalled at this point,

however, that Hudson mentions the same style of workmanship among 
the Pomo Indians for roof building- and traps, and W. H. Holmes 
brought from California a framework for carrying birds in which the 
rods are held in place })y a similar wrapping. There is also in the 
National Museum an old coarse mortar basket made of sticks which 
are bound together in the same wa3^ A great deal of twilled and 
wicker work comes from the neighborhood of the City of Mexico and 
from Central America, and a species of coiled sewing which exists 
vsporadically all the way from the Arctic Sea to Magellan Straits. 
The stitch, in addition to passing around the foundations to hold them 
together, also makes a wrap about the standing part between the coils. 
Modern coiled ware in great quantities is made up from agave fiber of 
fine quality, Init it resembles African work more than American. A 
variety of forms and uses exist in baskets in Mexico; among others, the 
innneuse liats. The Caribs on the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua are said 
to have plaited a pretty water-tight basket of reeds, called "" patapee," 
but these peoph^ had been in touch with natives of Africa, who knew 
how to make water-tight ])askets from the time of Moses at least. 
The Tlaxcala Indians used twined weaving in making slings. Types 
of work just mentioned continue on into the Central American States. 
No account is here made of the fine weaving and needlework, in which 
typical and extraordinary patterns are wrought, because they are across 
the boiuidarv line and are no longer in the famil\^ of basketr}- made 
merely by hand without machinery. 

Twined l)asketr3' and matting are preserved in the Peabody Museum 
from prehistoric burial caves in Coahuila, Mexico; among the Tlax- 
cala Indians (Nahuatlan famih') in Central Mexico; from prehistoric 
graves at Ancon, Peru, and Arica, Chile; from graves at Pisaqua, 
Chile; from the Guatos Indians (Tapuyan family), in southern Brazil, 
and from the Cadioes Indians ((luaycuruan family), on the Paragua 
River. (C. C. Willoughl)y.) 

Plate 236, U. S. National Museum, was brought by Frank liussell from 
the Yaqui Indians of northern Mexico. It is in the form of the so-called 
' ' telescope trunk," and old specimens of the National Museum were col- 
lected many years ago l)y Edward Palmer. The material is a kind of 
rush, and the weaving is in twilled work. Su(}h baskets are employed 
for holding all sorts of useful articles, but especially in connection 
with religious practices they are the depository of charms and fetish 
objects. 

Plate 23T, in the collection of Dr. A. Hrdlicka, shows two covered 
baskets bandbox shaped. Thej are made of palm-leaf strips in twilled 
weaving. Hundreds of these objects are woven of various sizes, and 
packed in nests, and are the common receptacle for all sorts of articles 
among the Yaqui. Especial attention is called to the lower basket, since 
it is an excellent example of what has been mentioned several times in 
this work — namely, double weaving. Strips of palm leaf are worked

in the pairs, the upper side of the leaf being outermost. At any 
moment, however, these stri]>s may he separated and each member of 
the pair do serviee for warp or weft separate!}'. 

The Yaqui of Sonora, Mexico, says Palmer, split the stems of 
arundinaria for basketry by pounding- them carefull}' with stones. The 
reeds divide along the lines of least resistance into splints of varying 
width, which are assorted and used in diffenMit t(^xtures. They now 
manufacture to order Hoor mats, porch screens, and the like, and sell 
them in Guaymas. 

The lluichole Indians, living in the Statc^ of Zacatecas, Mexico, 
belong to thcAztecan l)ranch of the great Shoshonean family. They 
have been described by Lumholtz, and are living in a state of native 
.simplicity. They make a basket '2 or ;-) feet long and oul}^ (5 inches in 
height with a similar cover. The material is pahu leaf and the technic 
is twilled weaving. Similar baskets are Avoven l)y the Tarahumara 
(Piman). State of Chihuahua, and also by the Tepeguanos (Piman) in 
Durango, Sinaloa, Chihuabua, and flalisc-o. These low, tra3'-shap(>d, 
rectangular baskets with covers arc the conuuon packing cases among 
these tribes mentioned of northern Mexico. (Ilrdlicka.) 

A wicker basket from Santa Maria del Kio, 1-f leagues soutli of San 
Luis Potosi, jVIexico, is ('ataloguc No. 76925, U. S. National Museum, 
made from the prepared stems of willow. The weaving is not after the 
fasliion of tlie connnt)n market basket, but its parts are woi'ked .■![)irallv 
in such manner that the smallei' ends of the stems terminate in a l)raided 
l)an(l around the top of the Ixxly. (("ompare tig. l'.M».) This arrange- 
ment reminds ont^ of Dr. Matthew s's Study in liutts and Ti})s." The 
warp consists of groups of tine stems arranged in fours. As the bottom 
is oblong, live of the groups pass straight across it widthwise, while 
at the (nids others radiate from the foci of the ellipse. The weft of 
the bottom is formed by means of fourteen stems, seven of which run 
in one direction and seven in the other, the smallei" ends being fastened 
oti' on the l)order. The ]»ody is built up in the same way. In the 
ordiTiary wicker basket a stem is wo\(mi among the warps, and when 
the end is reached another stem takes its place, and so on; but in 
this example all the weft stems of the ])ody l)egin at the very ])ottom 
and are wound in a spiral up to the up})er margin. At this border the 
war}) stems are all bent to the right for an inch and a lialf and then 
turned back again, l)eing intertwined in a sort of openwork diagonal 
weaving. To form the handle se\'(ui stems on each side ai'e thrust 
between the weft, and these bundles are wrapped about each other to 
form the twisted handle, the smaller ends being deflected so that the 
ends of the stems w hich form the body and the ends of the handle and 
the stems of the l)ody are all woven together to form the braid-work 
at the top. Collected by Edward Palmer.

H. Ling Roth, in liis paper on the aborigines of Hispaniola/' says 
that although none of the histories make reference to the island in 
which baskets were manufactured, nor even to tlie material out of 
which they are made, there is occasional mention of them, proving 
that formerly, as now, the Caribs and their tribes knew how to weave 
basket work. The Spaniards 1)oth in Hispaniola and Cuba on several 
occasions found men's heads cut off and sewed up with great care in 
small baskets. He quotes Benzoni in speaking of a feast in which 
baskets were adorned with roses and various flowers. Coliunbus found 
baskets in Guadeloupe full of men's bones. 

A glance at the map of northern South America shows how easy it 
is to pass from the AVindward Islands u]^ the Orinoco and over the 
drainage of the Rio Negro, down to th(^ Amazon. On this central 
position it is not difficult to make communication with the highlands 
of middle Brazil, Bolivia, eastern Peru, and Ecuador, and to pass from 
the Xingu River to Paragua}^ is easy. This explanation will clear 
the way for the collection of baskets now to be described. 

The seventieth ]xirallel from Greenwich may l)e used to divide South 
America into east and west basketr}' sub-areas. The West Indies will 
be counted with the eastern portions. The few widespread linguistic 
families serve as a l^ond to hold the tribes in mind. At the extreme 
north the Carib and the Arawak are conspicuous; the Tupi-Guarani 
and the Geez answer for Brazil; over the Amazon watershed, the 
La Plata areas, tlie Gran Chaco tribes follow. Patagonia and Fuegia 
complete the series. Over a large portion of this eastern region the 
types of weaving practiced in the Southern States of the Union pre- 
vail. On the western side of the continent, in the Andean valleys, 
the basketry is more varied and interesting, as the description and 
illustrations will show. The information which follows is far from 
complete. The little which is said will serve at least as a starting 
point and show that aboriginally and technically there was onl}^ one 
America. 

Plate 238 shows an Indian woman standing in front of the agave 
plant — a fitting combination, since in Mexico, Central America, and 
northern portions of South America the agave is to the native popu- 
lation an enduring friend. In modern industries it has not lost its 
influence. The lechiguilla, ixtl, sisal, and other standard flbers are 
therefrom. In old times it was the substance from which receptacles, 
clothing, parts of household utensils and conveniences, and man}" 
other useful things were made. The figure standing in front of the 
plant might be called the Clotho of the agave, whose skillful fingers 
will turn the ideal plant into many supplies of wants. 

Baskets from British Guiana are like those described by E. F. im 
Thurn in his work entitled Among the Indians of British Guiana.

The specimens in the National Museum are all of the twilled pattern, 
wrought from a bi-own vegetalile tiber whieJi shows the same on l)oth 
sides. This twill is used witli good eftect in tlic diagonally woven 
cassava strainers, widely distributed, wliieli may l)e contracted in 
length by a corresponding increase of width. When tlie cassava is 
packed into this strainer the latter is suspended and a great weight 
fastened to th(> l)ottom. The same device is used among us by country 
housewives in making curds. There is an entire lack of gaudy dyes in 
the Guiana l)askets, tlie only colors being the natural hue of the wood 
and a jet-black varnish. The gorgeous plumage of the l)irds replace 
the dyes in ornamentation. (See Plate 239.) 

The material used for basket work among the Indians of Guiana is 
the split stem of a kind of maranta {Ixch/tosJjiJion) called iturite by 
the Indians. For rough work other species of iturite are used, and 
for the roughest of all the unsplit stems of certain creepers, especially 
one called l)y th(^ Indians mamamoorie {(JarhKJorlc-d'phiinicri-i). 

The so-called pegalls (packalls) are sipiare generally. The basket 
and lid are the same shape; the latter, being larger, slips over the 
former and entirely covers it. Many Caribs made their pegalls of an 
oblong shape, with gracefully curved lines, and adorn them with long 
strings of thick, white cotton on which are knots of colored feathers. 
Sometimes the true Caribs make the pegall and lid double, and l)etween 
the two layers of basket work certain leaves {Ixc]in<»<i2)li<>n) ar*^ inserted 
to make the whole waterproof. Here is another example of double 
warp noted in several ]^;irts of North America. 

Another basket, shaped like a slipper, is the suriana, for carrying 
heav}" loads. This useful form has a wide distribution, being seen in 
Guatemala. The '"'quake," another ])asket, is used for storing pro- 
visions. They also serve as cages. It is made of open wicker work 
with a rounded l)ottom. Most of the T)askets are manufactured in the 
same way and of the same material. The Nikari karus, living on the 
Brazilian l)orders, make their pegalls of the leaves of the palm 
{Orh!(jn<t), very rare in British Guiana. These are square or oblong." 

Plates 24:0 and 2-1:1 are from photographs pi-esented by the distin- 
guished ethnologist, Carl von den Steinen. The}" represent carrying 
baskets from eastern Brazil in the collection of the Berlin Ethno- 
graphic Museum. In order to bring the structure into (-omparison, 
baskets of the same function were selected. The following descrip-

half of the warp (dements arc vcn'tical and the other inclined. Phe weft 
passes through the interstices formed by the crossed warp in twos and 
threes. At the top a hoop is used for strengthening; the warj) turned 
back and held tirm ))v a single row of three-strand weaving. On the 
sides a roi)e is attached to the weft elements for loops and tht» head- 
band is made, as in the other specimens, from the toug'h inniu- l)ark of

are made of four elongated hoops of wood. One furnishes the bed or 
bottom of the frame, two others the sides, and the smaller one the end. 
Those who are accustomed to studjdng utensils used in transportation 
will recognize in these two fi'anies African forms. The}" are not 
basket work, either of them, in the strict sense of the word, since the 
webbing which fills up the hoops is true network of string; the cross- 
ings form regular knots. In both examples the headband is of bast, 
or the inner bark of a tree, and in the larger the binding of the ])ottom 
is in the same material.

Indians, on the Rio Sao Lourenyo, Brazil, in the collection of Dr. von

throughout the world. The interesting portion, which ought not to be 
overlooked, is the border, which is the midrib of the palm leaf, with 
the leaflets attached. The carrying band or headband, as in other 
examples, is in tough inner bark of a tree.

Nieuhoff describes the 
Brazilian basketry of his 
day." 

The baskets of the In- 
dians of southern Brazil 
are made of palm-tree 
leaves. They call them 
patigua. They have also some made of reed or of cane. These are 
with one general name called karamemoa. They make also large 
broad baskets of reeds and ])ranches twisted together. These they 
call panaku, and are chiefly used for the carrying of the mandioka 
root. In their journeys they alwa3's make use of the patigua, but the 
panaku is used by the slaves and negroes in the Receif for the con- 
veniency of carriage. 

The Guatos Indians in southern Brazil employ twined weaving in 
the manufacture of mantles and the Cadricios Indians on tht^ Paraqua 
River make grass bags i)i the same technic.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 




The figure of an Araucanian woman acting as both freight and 
passenger carrier is introduced from De Schryver'^' to show the exten- 
sion of the buttonhole stitch technic southward. The insertion of a 
foundation in coiled work is not common farther north, l)ut will be 

again noted at the ver}^ extremit}^ 
of the continent. (See fig. 204:.) 
The basketry of South America 
reaches its southern limit in the 
Fuegian coiled ware with slight 
foundation and sewing in button- 
hole stitches, illustrated in fig. 59. 
Coming over to the western side 
of the continent, fig. 205 is a coiled 
carrying bag from Chiriqui, Co- 
lombia, and is a type of an enor- 
mous amount of ware to be found 
in Middle America, North Amer- 
ica, and South J^ merica. It is rep- 
resented in fig\ 42, and is called in 
this monograph ceiled work with- 
out foundatio' . It will be seen, 
by looking at the detail, that the 
twine constituting the fabric inter- 
locks with the stitch underneath and makes a complete revolution, catch- 
ing the next stitch, and so on. Without definite information on the sub- 
ject, it is believed that in making these bags some sort of a gauge is used 
by the Aveaver — a small stick which may be slipped along as the work 
proceeds. 

The detail is shown in fig. 200. and 
especial attention is called to the 
ornamental effect of using a two-ply 
twine and the additional decorative 
feature of having the twines in dif- 
ferent colors. 

The fibers of the Middle Americans 
and Mexicans are of the best kind and 
texture, and are used in hammocks 
and for the most exacting labor in 
transportation. 

An interesting example of the friendly cooperation between the 
best material and the best workmen is to 1)e found in the Republic of 
Ecuador in the manufacture of the so-called Panama hat. In Con- 
sular Report No. 821 Consul Perry M. de Leon gives the following

account of it: The JMiinavi (Panama) hat was first made in the province 
of Manavi, F^cuador, about two hundred and seventy-tive 3'ears ag-o by a 
native named Francisco Delgado. The present centers of the in<histry 
are Monte Cristi and Jipijapa in the province of Manavi, and Santa 
Elena and Cuenca in the provinces of Guayas and Azuay, respective!}'. 
The}' came to ])e Ivnown as Pananja hats years ago when that city was a 
distributing- center. Those who are familiar with them can tell ])y the 
method of beg-iiuiing the work at the center of the crown the locality 
where the work is done. In Ecuador, Colombia, and C'entral America 
the hat is known to the natives as the Jipijapa (pronounced hipi-hapa), 
but as they ar(» made elsewhere in Ecuador, principally in the province 
of ]\Ianavi, and as the name is eas}^ to pronounce, it might take the place 
of the ]H-esent misleading appellation. (See Plate 242.) 

They are made from a native species of palm {CajTlttdoi'led ^^nltnata). 
It is cultivated in the provinces of Manavi and (iuayas and is known as 
"paja toquilla." In appearance it resembles very much our saw pal- 
metto; it is fan-like in shape. Low-lying w(>t land is selected and the 
seed planted in rows during the rainy season. When thc^ plant attains 
a height of \\ or 5 feet it is cut just l)efore ripening. The leaves are 
boiled in hot water and aftei- being thoroughly sun dried are assorted 
and ready for use. 

The material is lii-st carefully selected, dampened to make it pliable, 
then yery tinely divided into recpiisite widths, the little tinger and 
thumb nail being used for the purpose. The very finest specimens 
are prepared from delicate^ leaves that need no splitting or stiffening. 
The plaiting l)egins at the apex of the crown and is continued in cir- 
cular form luitil the hat is finished. The story that they are made 
under water l)y candle light is untrue. The work is carried on while 
the atmosphere is humid, from al)out midnight to 7 o'clock in the 
morning. At night the hat is hung out in the open air so that the 
dew may fall upon it, and it is then in position to be worked the next 
day. If the strand breaks it can be replaced and so plaited so as not to 
aftect the work nor be yisil)le to the naked eye. The ingenious woman 
uses her knee for a head ])lock. This antedates all modern appliances 
for giving shape to head gear. It requires from three to five months 
daily labor of three hours a day to make one of the finest hats. The 
business in its highest development is really an art, requiring patience, 
fine sight, and special skill — qualifications few of the natives possess. 
The plaiting completed, the hat is washed in clean, cold water, coated 
with a thin solution of gum, and polished with drj^ powdered sulphur. 
They are so pliable that they can be rolled up without injury and put 
in one's pocket. They will last for years and can be repeated!}^ cleaned. 

Natives of both sexes and all ages are engaged in this work at odd 
times, the business being a side issue. Children make from raw, 
undressed straw about two of the common hats a day.

The specimen here shown is in the colleotion of Dr. S. O. Richey, 
ot" Washington City, and has "20 or more c'rossinj»"s to the linear 
inch. The hats vary from the ordinary form ha\'ino- IS crossings or 
checks to the finest quality, which have twice as many. In the market 
they are sold at from $10 to $15<». The most costly specimens are 
those in which there is not a break in the straw, mismatched color, or 
a knot showing- in the work. 

During the nineteenth century the cemeteries of Peru yielded the 
greatest abundance of relics and remains. Among the former were a 
mixed variety of textiles, which were types of basketr}' hereafter to be 
described. The climate of Peru is arid and almost a desert like that 
of Arizona or Eg} pt. The frail products of the textile industry that 
might have perished utterly in North America almost ever3'where 
have here all been preserved. Fine specimens of old Peruvian work 
are to be seen in all the leading museums of the world. The Field 
Columbian in Chicago is especiall}' rich in productions of this kind, 
gathered through the agency of the Woi'kFs Columbian Exposition 
in 1893. 

In the Peabody Museum and in the U. S. National Museum also are 
fine old collections brought home fifty years ago by earlier travelers 
and explorers in South America, and in this Peruvian basketware are 
to be seen not only great varieties in form and exhaustive treatment 
of native technical processes but adaptations to uses without number 
extending literally from the cradle to the grave. 

The name Peru has for the ethnologist a long perspective in time, 
reaching through mau}^ centuries; in elevation it covers the range of 
ha])ital)le areas from reeking seacoasts to heights barely endura])le by 
man. In coast line it stretches through 15 degrees of south latitude 
(5° to 20' ). Only hi width is it restricted to the narrow watershed of 
the Andes and a slight portion of the incline on the eastern side, 
reaching down to the forest line. The most celebrated of the explora- 
tions in this area have been by Reiss, Stiiljel, and Koppel." 

These authors figure the following-named types of hask{^try: 

1. Checkerwork: In this connection should be noted a kind of open- 
work in which the warps are set at an angle of -15 degrees, running in 
two directions, forming diamond-shapcxl spaces. A weft passes around 
among these warps so as to divide the diamond-shaped spaces into tri- 
angles. Such weaving is seen in many specimens of the North Pacific 
area; even the Aleutian islanders practice it. It has been alreadj" 
described and figured in von d(Mi Steinen's plat<\s for the eastern area. 

2. Wickerwork, in Colombia and Uruguay. 

3. Diagonal or twilled work, widel}" diffused. 

4. Twined work has been recovered from prehistoric graves at 
Ancon, Peru, in matting, both coarse and fine, and on baskets; from

ture on other specimens, however, to which attention is drawn by

production of triangular figures. The weaver in going from right to 
left produces the efl'ect of right-angle triangles, but in returning so 
regulates the decussations of the fibers as to give to the pairs of tri-

But the most charming effects in these Peruvian workbaskets are

Another char- 

actcn-istic of this 

Peruvian work 

is the hinging of 

the cover of the 

basket as part of 

the weaving. In 

Plate 243, evidently the workbasket of an ancient spinner in Vicuna 
wool, there is a single cover, but it will l)e seen that the modern com- 
partment trunk has been anticipated, the basket being in three divi- 
sions, the middle one forming the cover of the lower one. The detail 
of the hinge as a part of the texture may be seen in the small drawings 
at the bottom of the plate.

the top the t'orni of an olilique hexagon. The ends are hekl in place 
b}^ a stout cord of hair in natural brown color. The warp of this 
basket is formed by winding a white string round and round these 
sticks on the outside, about one-eighth of an inch apart, from the 
bottom to the top. The weft is a series of vertical rows of twined 
weaving, in some places close together and in others wide apart, for 
ornamental eliect. The vertical stripes seen on the surface are in 
green, red, l)lack, and white, twined, and in twined weaving, each block 
including two or more warp strands. By using two colors in the twine 
the patterns arc variegated on the surface, first the white and then the 
colored strand coming into view. B}' comparing these specimens with 
the one from the Arikara Indians, lig. li>5, it will be seen that in the 
latter two of the bows projected downward and formed the l)ottom, on 
which the liasket rests. But in this case no such protection is afforded. 
The woman has sewed a coarse piece of woven stuif along the bottom

as a protection of the more delicate threads. The specimen is in the 
Field Columbian Museum, Chicago, and the colored plate was fur- 
nished by Dr. George A. Dorsey. 

Fig. 212 is a fragment of a coiled basket from a copper mine in the 
district of Chuc^uicamata in the desert of Atacama, Chile. It was 
found, together with other industrial implements, associated with the 
body of a woman who undoubtedly met her death on the spot. From 
the dislocated })ackbone and the small stones embedded in the skin, it 
is supposed that she was buried by a caving in of the works. The 
basket of which this is a fragment, was in ever}^ respect similar to the 
Pima ware in southern Arizona. This fragment bears such remarkable 
similarity to Pima workmanship that J. W. Benham, of Arizona, who 
is most familiar with it, was struck with the Chilean example and 
wondered whether it were possible that the Pima Indians and the 
Chileans could have been under the same instructors. 



538 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

Plates 245 to 247 are also specimens of coiled work exhilMted in 
the Pan-American Exposition, witli the mummy from C'hile; the 
foundation of the coil of shredded material and the sewing also in soft 
splints. The stitches pass over the foundation and are not only inter- 
locking but take up a portion of the foundation in its base belov,'. 
These should be compared with the specimens from northern Mexico 
in the Peabody Museum, described b}^ C. C. Willoughby. 

Plate 248 is the side and bottom view of a coiled basket from Peru. 
The style is entirely modern, but it is introduced here to show two 
features in technic well wrought out in the northern continent. The 
foundation and the sewing are both in a brilliant-colored straw, species 
unknown. Sewing is reduced to the minimum, most of the founda- 
tion being neatly wrapped, or served with the sewing material. The 
stitches on the body are l)if urcated most neatly, and coming one above 
the other give the impression of herringbone work done vertically. 
Finding this openwork coil and furcate stitches in Eskimo land, Cali- 
fornia, and Peru would tempt one to see the same invention arising 
independently in regions wide apart; but, omitting the unlimited 
going about in pre-Columbian times, during hundreds of years the 
sovereigns of Spain, France, England, and for a century Russia mixed 
the native tribes and their industries. Catalogue No, 150844, U. S. 
National Museum, 

The two areas of South America, eastern and western, unite in the 
Straits of Magellan, There are three linguistic families of Indians, 
among whom two types of basketr}^ are found belonging to the coiled 
variety. They are made l)y women of J\inei(s inayeJIanieus. Descrip- 
tions and figures of the stitches involved will lie found in the RcA^ue 
d'Ethnographie," See also Lovisto,'' The rim is made of wood veya 
or tshelia. The specimens in the U, S, National Museum are all of one 
variety, the sewing ])eing in the buttonhole stitch, so called, and in 
openwork. Nothing of the kind exists in the neighborhood, so that 
it is within the limits of possibilit}^ that the style of technic was 
introduced.

Hemisphere it would seem that all the types and processes known 
throughout the world are to be s(H>n here, 

VIII. COLLECTORS AND COLLECTIONS 

As David and the Sibyl say— Thomas of Cei-ano. 

Basketry and pottery are the Sibylline leaves on which are written 
the thoughts and lore of our Indians, Alread}^ much has gone bej^ond 
recovery; it is for this reason that a good word is here spoken for 
those lovers of art who have spent time and means in redeeming the 

"Paris, IV, p. 517. ^Guida Cora's Cosmos, October, 1884, pi, v. 



ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 539 

more perishiUilc- of the two treasures from destruction. Pottery may 
be Ijroken, Imt its fraonients endure and bear witness. Not so bas- 
kctr}^, made of the most perishal)ie portions of plants, it can endure 
only when in contact with preservative materials, or partly reduced 
to ashes, or deposited in caves and other dry places, or finally, their 
technic but not their stor}' may be saved l)y impressions left on 
potter}'. 

The following instructions are pulilished for the great number of 
persons who are interested in the collection and preservation of 
American basketry. Besides the a\sthetic elements involved and the 
pride of saving- the ])est examples of a rapidly vanishing industry, 
there is a vast deal of culture study which ought not to b(^ neglected. 

In every collection, public or private, there are opportunities for 
special investigation that should not l)e in the possession of a single 
individual only. If all who are gathering ])askets would preserve such 
information as they may be al)le to obtain, the bringing together of 
the results of all this study would be a monument for our American 
aboriginal women. 

As pointed out in former chapters, knowledge concerning basketry 
seems to be illimital)le, the technician, the artist, and the stud(Mit of 
folklore finding etpial pleasure in the acciuisition. To begin with the 
manufacture, a correct knowledge of thc^ materials includes the name 
of the tribe and their location, the name of the different kinds of 
weaving in the native tongue, and chiefiv, the nativ(> name, the com- 
mon name, and the scientific name of every plant or animal substance 
or mineral involved. The reason for this is that in order to know 
whether an art is indigenous or acquired, it is necessary to compare 
the names for definite things with those used by other tribes for the 
same things. Not to discourage the collector, however, it must ])e said 
that this is an ideal toward which he ought to work. 

The following label of a specimen in the Hudson basketry collection, 
U. S. National Museum, will starve as a model to guide the collector in 
saving information alwut his specimens:

Kahum, or California sedge {Cair.v Ixirbarac), throat and scalp feathers of KatAtch, or wood- 
pecker {Mekmerpes forminvorus), breast feathers of Jucil, or meadow lark (Slnrndla ticgh'cta), 
scalp feathers of KayAii, or mallard {Anas horchas), plumes of TchikAka, or crested quail 
(Lophorlt/x. cqlifornirii.'i), neck feathers of TsawAlii, or jay {Ci/anura stdlcri), and Kiiya, or pre- 
pared clam shell {Saxidomus f/racilis) , in a style of coiled sewing called Tsai, in which a single 
roil constitutes the basis. The sewing i)asses over this rod, under the preceding one, and locks 
in the stitch immediately underneath. Ornamentation, a row of shell disks around the margin 
and another row serving as a handle.

540 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

For the artistic collector there is a verjMmportant mission, to know 
and to foster the aboriuinal patterns and motives in decoration. JNIan}^ 
of the shapes and designs in basketr}' are spurious. Besides the trashy 
imitations of letters and common things on basketry, which mislead 
no one, there is an important habit springing up of getting women of 
one tribe to imitate the designs of another tribe. This works con- 
fusion in two ways. It confounds the student of folklore absolutel}^ 
and if there be any truth in the belief that in all art the material and 
the motif have in the ages adapted themselves to each other '" like per- 
fect music mito perfect words," the attempt to put Apache ornaments 
on Pima, or Wasco on Klikitat is discordant. 

PRESERVATION OF BASKETS 

The art of a people must be judged by what they need not do and yet aceomplish. — A. C. Haddox. 

Textiles are among the most fragile and perishable of human indus- 
trial products. Insects and rust, heat and cold, too inuch and too little 
moisture, the common accidents of life, are hastening our pretty 
baskets to their dissolution. Therefore, how to prolong the life of 
a basket is a living question with all basket lovers, and the answer 
will be easier if the causes of destruction are known. The three 
enemies of baskets are moth and rust and human lingers. By the 
moth are meant all destructive animals; by rust, natural decay ; and in 
the last agency must be classed the myriad waj'S by which our fellow- 
creatures purloin and destroy our treasures, E. S. Morse tells us that 
the Japanese do not make of th(ur houses bazaars for the ostentatious 
display of art objects, but they put them awa}^ in silk bags to bring 
forth when they wish to delight their friends. Those collections that 
have been made with a view to permanence should be kept so that the}" 
will suffer least from damage. The dust may be blown from the speci- 
mens with bellows. Those containing remnants of vegetable matter, 
berries, food, etc., should be careful!}' scrubbed with soap and water, 
and rubbed down with a very small portion of oil and drj^er. Above 
all they should l)e poisoned with ia weak solution of corrosive sublimate 
or arsenic dissolved in alcohol. A card catalogue giving the legend and 
history of each piece would add much to the value of the collection. 

A list of collections of rarities in American basketr}^ is here 
appended, by no means complete, but it will aid the student who 
wishes to prosecute his investigations further to find the material. 
First of all, in the great museums there are permanently in store 
priceless examples of basketry, and in addition mau}^ costl}^ collec- 
tions belonging to private individuals, have thus rendered a great 
service to this writer. It is interesting to read over the names of the 
men and women who long ago contributed to the great museums 
precious examples of uncontaminated Indian art.

N.\tional Museum. — The Museum is rich in collections of American basketry made 
to show all forms of technic and also to exhibit handiwork from tril)es in the six 
areas. Beginning at the north, the collections of Ray from Point Barrow; of 
McFarlane and Ross at the Mackenzie mouth; the rich treasures gathered by 
Nelson in western Alaska; those of Dall, Turner, Ajaplegate, and Fisher further 
south; and the Tlinkit ware selected by McLean, Swan, and Emmons amply 
illustrate the technical pjrocesses in that area. 

Going southward, the Salish and other Fraser-Columbia basketry includes 
among others Wilkes, Swan, Eells, Shackleford, Emmons, and Willoughby col- 
lections. 

The largest collections from California were made by Purcell, Ray, Stone, 
Powers, Hudson, Henshaw, Curtin in the north; by Holmes, Merriam, Rust, 
and Mead in the south. 

The collections of basketry from the Interior Basin are the largest of all, 
being gathered by Palmer, Powell, Cushing, Stevenson, Holmes, Fewkes, Hough, 
Mooney, and Russell, and officers connected with the numerous surveys. Much 
of this is very old. From further south, from Middle and South America, the 
Museum is indebted to explorers and officers of various departments of the Gov- 
ernment for tyjiical material, the latest gathered on. the Amazon by J. B. Steere.

The following- list of publications will help to follow up this study 
in special lines. A great awakening of interest in the processes of 
savao-e industries as the foundation of all modern machine work has 
stimulated the production of excellent books and papers on basketiy.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE 4. 
Hazelnlt [Corylus calif omlca) . 

The main figure is a fruiting branch. Above at the left are two staminate catkins, 
with a pistillate flowering l)ud at their base, accompanied by a sectional view of a 
catkin scale and stamens, enlargetl six times. To the right above are a terminal bud 
and a nut. Underneath the main figure are views of catkin scales and stamens, from 
front and back, six times natural size, and at the right a terminal cluster of pistillate 
flowers, enlarged three times. Except in the cases noted, the figures are of natural 
size.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE 6. 
Klamath Gamblixg Tray. 

A sak-lotks^ p'a'-hla or flexible gambling tray of the Klamath Indians of Oregon. 
Both warp (pa-chish^) and weft (twach) are of cords of undyed twisted tule (p. 211), 
which are fully exposed only in the pale-brown stripe at the margin, where the ends 
of the warp are interlaced and lx)und with a strengthening cord of gray fiber from the 
nettle ( Urtica breweri), sl^dsh. Every other stitch of the tray is covered by an over- 
laying material: the white is of reed (p. 208); the black (mok^-was) is of tule dyed 
in mud springs containing iron; the canary yellow is of porcupine quills (smai^-am) 
dyed with wolf moss (p. 205), and the brown of the ring near the center of the tray 
id of undyed tule. Nettle cord was used in binding the strands of warp together at 
the beginning. 

The main trefoil pattern is of unknown significance. The triangles upon it are 
bird-wing patterns (slas-al'-tKs), while the triangles on the marginal design are arrow- 
head patterns (sa^-wal-sal'-tls). The brown and black ring near the center is an 
op^-k'a, a name applied only to a ring of transversely alternating colors. A ring of 
uniform color would be a smel-6'-g'a.

THE HERPETOLOGY OF PORTO RICO. 



By Leonhari) Stejnegek, 
Curator, Dir'moii of Reptiles (ind Batrachimis. 



INTRODUCTION. 

The present account of the herpetology of Porto Rico i,s based 
primarily upon the collections recently accumulated in the United 
States National Museum, consisting- of about 900 specimens. 

Of this larg-e amount of material nearly 350 specimens were collected 
by Mr. A. B. Baker, of the National Zoolooical Park, who accompanied 
the U. S. Fish Commission expedition to Porto Rico during the early 
part of 1899, and the other naturalists then attached to the Fish Ilawh."' 

About 540 specimens were secured in 1900 by Dr. C. W. Richmond 
and the present writer, who visited Porto Rico and Vieques from 
February 12 to April 19. This number includes various specimens 
collected then or shortly afterwards at our request by other persons, 
among whom may be mentioned Dr. A. Stahl, of Bayamon, Porto 
Rico; Mr. L. M. McCormick, of New York; Mr. B. S. Bowdish, of 
New York, and Mr. Charles E. Adams. 

It may be added that the National Museum during 1901 employed 
Mr. B. S. Bowdish for several months in collecting in Porto Rico and 
Mona Island. The most important result was the discovery of a new 
species of AnoUs in Mona. 

The trip which I undertook in conjunction with Dr. C. W. Rich- 
mond, Assistant Curator of Birds, was primarily for the purpose of 
collecting specimens characteristic of the West Indian fauna for exhi- 
bition at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo. It was originally 
our intention to proceed from Porto Rico to the smaller islands on the 
east and south, but an attack of fever to which we both fell victims 
prevented us from carrying out our plans. The fever and the long- 
convalescence also seriously interfered with our work in Porto Rico, 
so that we lost nearly three weeks collecting. 

«For an account of this expedition see Dr. B. W. Evermann's General Report on 
the Investigations in Porto Rico of the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Fish. Hawk 
in 1899, in U. S. Fish Commission Bulletin for 1900, pp. 3-25. 

553 



554 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

Our principal and most important collecting was made in the high 
and wet region of the El Yunque Mountain, near the eastern end of 
the island. There, at an altitude of 2,978^' feet, onl}^ about 500 feet 
below the top, we camped for five days during an almost continuous 
rain and fog, while an equal length of time was spent on Mr. Agostini's 
hospital)le coffee plantation on the eastern slope of the same mountain, 
at an elevation of 886 feet. One of the first reptiles I collected there 
was a fine specimen of the larg-e Anolis cimieri, which seems to be 
quite rare. In the excessively moist climate near the top, in a trop- 
ical forest of palms and tree ferns covered with dripping moss and air 
plants, while a dense matting of wet begonias concealed the ground 
reeking with dampness, we collected a large number of tree toads, 
some of which turned out to be new species. Here also we saw the 
new species of AnoJts, the gorgeously emerald green A. evermmini. 
in its greatest glor} . 

Another new species of Anolis. we discovered toward the end of our 
sta}' in the dry, southern part of the island, in fact, only 8 miles from 
Ponce, the most important commercial city of the island. The surface 
of the hills, which rise out of the coastal i)lain east of the city, is 
covered with a white, calcareous, marl-like formation, and here we 
found this species, AnoUs poii ceitsls, which lielongs to the same group 
of the genus as A. pulchelhm and ^4. hrugl. 

Some time was spent in Utuado in a diligent search for Peters's 
ArioUx (/iindktch!, the types of which, now in the museum at Berlin, 
are said to have been collected at Utuado. We secured only a single 
young specimen near that town, which is the lowest altitude in which 
the species seems to occur. In the higher regions of El Yunque and 
at Adjuntas we found it abiuidant. 

That I only obtained one specimen of Celestus plei'i^ and that we, as 
well as Mr. Baker and others of the Fhli Hawh party, entirel}^ failed 
to secure a single specimen of 2f<ihin/(( .^/oa/rh' is less extraordinary, 
for doubtless the scarcity of these purely terrestrial species is due 
to the mongoose, which now infests the whole island and in places is 
exceedingly common. 

This ferocious little animal is also responsible for the present com- 
parative infrequency of snakes in the island. Formerh" snakes were 
common enough, for as late as 1836 Dr. Moritz found them so numer- 
ous that in places one could hardly make a step without seeing sev- 

«My own aneroid measurements gave for our camp an altitude of 2,863 feet and 
for the top of El Yunque 3,351 feet. On the latest map of Porto Rico issued by the 
U. S. Coast and Geodetic^ Survey (No. 920, December, 1901) the height of El Yunque 
as obtained by triangulation is given as 1,062 meters, or 3,485 feet, consequently 
134 higher than found by me. Accepting the latter altitude as correct, and distribut- 
ing the error proportionally, the altitude of our camp may be assumed to have been 
2,978 feet above sea level.

eral. At present one may traverse the island from one end to the 
other without getting a glimpse of a single one. 

The apparent rarity- of the toad [Biifn humir) is i)robal)ly due less 
to the mongoose than to its very retired hal)its and the scarcity of 
suital>lo localities. The name Sapo is known to the inhahitants, but 
inmost places is misapplied to the Leptodactyhis and the tree toad. 
8ome even knew the name S<q>o coiicho^ b}'^ which the Porto Kican 
toad is known spe('ilically because of the shell-like hardness of the 
bonv head covering, but no one seemed able to give us any informa- 
tion which would lead to its discovery. P>en a large reward which I 
oti'ered proved ineti'ective. Dr. Stahl, who, during a residence of more 
than forty years, had collected assiduously, and to whom the country 
people used to bring all the natural curiosities they could tind, assured 
us that he himself had never seen the toad in its native haunts, and 
that altogether only six specimens had been brought him, so that our 
prospects of finding it were very slight. Mr. Baker and the Fish 
Couuuission party had also failed to obtain a single specimen. We 
were constantly watching for it, and nearly despaired of getting one 
but finally decided to spend some time in Arecibo as the most likely 
place for them to occur. Even here we were on the point of giving 
up our search for the now almost mythical animal, when on the last 
night of our stay there, after our baggage was packed for our depart- 
ure the next morning, I became the happy possessor of five fine speci- 
men^, thauks to the zealous and intelligent assistance of Enrique L. 
Brascoechea, a young Porto Rican of Aguadilla, a United States tele- 
graph operator, and at the time temporarily in charge of the telegraph 
office in Arecibo. 

During this trip I psiid special attention to the colors of the living 
reptiles and bati'achians which I collected, and full descriptions were 
prepared with Kidgway's Nomenclator of Colors in hand for reference. 
These descriptions will 1>e found in the present account under their 
proper headings. 

The figures illustrating this paper are mostl}^ the work of Mr. R. G. 
Paine. A few have been drawn by Miss Sigrid Bentzon. 

The author wishes to express his obligations to various yjersons who 
have assisted in accunmlating the material at hand, either directly by 
collecting part of it or indirectly by assisting him while in Porto Rico. 

Thanks are particularly due to the authorities of the U. S. Fish 
Commission for the use of the magnificent collections made by the 
Fhh Ilaivk expedition, and to Mr. A. B. Baker for the zeal and care 
displayed in getting together the finest collection of reptiles made up 
to that time in Porto Rico. I am also under ol)ligations to Mr. Louis 
McCormick, Mr. B. S. Bowdish, Mr. ('harles E. Adams, and Dr. A. 
Stahl, for specimens collected by them in various parts of the island 
and presented to the National Museum. 



556 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

To Prof. Samuel Garman, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology 
at Cambridge, Massachusetts, I am greatly indebted for the loau of 
various specimens of Porto Pican reptiles. 

To Dr. G. Pfefler, (airator in the Natural History Museum in Ham- 
burg, I am also greatly in debt for the opportunity to examine the 
Mona Island specimens under his care. Dr. Steinhaus, assistant at 
the same museum, rendered valuable help during this examination. 

I wish specially to acknowledge the assistance received from the 
military authorities then in charge of the island. Col. John L. Clem, 
U. S. Army, the chief quartermaster, rendered material help in the 
matter of ti-ansportation, and Lieut. Col. William A. Glassford, U. S. 
Army, the chief signal officer, has placed us under lasting obligations 
by his generous and thoughtful assistance in many ways. 

Finally, I have to thank my associate, Dr. Charles W. Richmond, 
for active help and cheerful companionship during an expedition which, 
though offering but little in the way of excitement and adventure, 
nevei'theless was devoid neither of arduous work nor of hardships of 
various kinds and degrees. 

HISTORICAL REVIEW. 

The first attempt at an enumeration of the reptiles and batrachians 
of Porto Rico is by Mr. Ledru (as he is called on the title-page, or 
Le Dru, as his name is spelled throughout the book), who accompanied 
Captain Baudin in 1796 to 1798 on a scientific expedition to Teneriffa, 
Trinidad, St, Thomas, St. Croix, and Porto Rico, of which he pub- 
lished an account in two volumes in 1810 (see bibliography). The 
second volume contains what purports to be an account of the reptiles 
occurring in Porto Rico under the following names: (1) Lacerta mon- 
itor Gm., (2) Lacerta strumosa Gm., (3) Lacerta sputator Gm., (4) 
La/ierta igxiami Gm., (5) Lacerta araelva Gm., (6) Lacerta prmcipalis 
Gm., (7) Lacerta rapicauda Gm., (8) Col uher colubella Gm., (9) Coluber 
mela7wcephalu,s Gm., (10) Boa murma Gm,, (11) Liana ocellatalAn.- 
Gm., (12) Ltana arhorea Lin. var -S Rana Americana rubra Seb., Gm. 

This list is only less amusing than that of the birds and need not be 
taken seriously. Evidently Ledru, who was a botanist, did not bring 
home any reptilian specimens.'* He probably made notes of some 
which he saw and of names which were given him on the island. 
Consequentl}^ it is not worth while to attempt any identification of 
his names, and no reference is made to them in the synonymies of the 
species in this paper. To illustrate how worthless the whole account 
is I may quote his description of the boa, which evidently is meant to 
be the Epiaxites inornatim, a species nearly uniform grajash-brown

and deposited in the National Museum at Paris. Vol. II, p. 291.

above and .slate-gray beneath, but which according- to Ledru has the 
'•color on the back agreeably marbled with sea-green; pale and 
speckled with black on the belly." 

The next time we hear of Porto Ricau reptiles is in a paper by Dr. 
C. Moritz/' who collected insects for the museum in Berlin during 
four months in the spring of 1835. On page 375 he presents a few 
general remarks on the reptiles, of no particular interest except that 
it appears from his account that snakes were much more numei'ous at 
that time than at present, for he speaks of places in which one 
scarcely could make a few steps without seeing- several snakes. That 
he was not nmch of a herpetologist is evident from his reference 
to Caicilla, b}^ which he apparently means either Typhlopx or 
A')nphishdena. 

Long Ijefore this time, however, a certain Monsieur Plee had also 
visited Porto Rico, apparently on his way from New York to Mar- 
tinique. He sent his specimens from the latter place to the Museum 
d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, where the reptiles without any discrim- 
ination were all credited to Martinique. Amphl><tmna cceca^ Anolls 
cristafellm, Anolls jjulchellus, and (Jela^tus 2yleii belong to this category. 

With the DanifL'h Virgin Islands so near to Porto Rico, it was quite 
natural that specimen,-; from the latter should occasionally find their 
way to the museum in Copenhagen. Thus Reinhardt was enabled, in 
1843, to describe the large boa as Boa inornata. Later, Mr. Riise, 
an apothecary in St. Thomas, who collected extensively in the Danish 
islands, visited Vieques personally and sent a number of Porto Rican 
specimens about the same time to the Smithsonian Institution and to 
the museum in Copenhagen. The former came under the notice of 
Cope, and scattered references to them were made b}^ him in 1862. 
In the following year Professor Reinhardt and Dr. Luetken published 
their admirable contril)utions to the herpetology of the West Indian 
Archipelago, particularly that of the Danish West Indian Islands (see 
Bibliography) in which the first list of Porto Rican reptiles and batra- 
chians based on reliable material was published. The list was a very 
meager one, embi-acing only one batrachian,* four snakes, hve lizards, 
and two turtles, together eleven species, as follows; 

1 ? Hylodes antiUensis (Vieques), 

2 'I Alsophis antiUensis (Vieques). 

3. Alsophis portoricensis. 

4. Chilahothrus inornatus. 

5. Typlilops richardil. 



«Arcli. Naturg., II, 1836, pp. 373-392. 

^ In their tabular synopsis of West Indian species, Porto Rico is credited with one 
species of batrachians (Author's separate, p. 7), though by an oversight the species 
is not indicated in the table. The only batrachian referred to in the text as belong- 
ing to Porto Rico is a young Hylodes from Vieques doubtfully referred to H. antiUensis 
(Author's separate, p. 57).

As the record of the North American Knnj.s conclnna" is based upon 
two 3"oung- specimens received from Mr. Riise, who had only a "well- 
founded idea'' that they came from Porto Rico, it may be excluded 
from the list which thus contains only ten species. 

Not long after the publication of lieinhardtaud Luetken's list, speci- 
mens collected by Mr. Georg-e Latimer in Porto Rico were received 
by the Smithsonian Institution, and reported on b}^ Professor Cope in 
his kSixth Contribution to the Herpetology of Tropical America.'' The 
number of species sent l)y Mr. Latimer was nine, as follows: 

1. Pelta/pJiryne lemur.' 

2. GyHt'ignathnx alhilahr!s var. 

3. Ilenddactylus mahuiu.

8. CJdlaljothruH inornatus. 
\). Alsophis smicticrucis. 

At least five of .hese species are additional to Reinhardt and I^uet- 
ken's list — namel}, the first five — thus bringing the total number of 
species definitely known from Porto Rico and Vieques in 1868 up to 
fifteen. 

The next addition is in ISTl, when SpJutrglx corincea was added by 
Dr. Bello y Espinosa.'' He also mentioned the occurrence of the 
Hylodes, though without identifying it. With this addition the num- 
ber of species l)ecame sixteen. 

A decided step forward in our knowledge of the herpetology of 
Porto Rico was taken when Prof. W. Peters, .in 1876,'' published his 
paper upon the collections made by the German vice-consul in Maya- 
guez, Mr, L. Krug, and the well-known zoologist of Habana, Dr. J. 
Gundlach, who visited the island in 1873 and again in 1875-70.'' The 
collections, which are deposited in the Berlin Museum, embraced nine- 
teen species of reptiles and batrachians, of which six were additions 

« One of the specimens in question seems to be now in the Hofmuseum at Vienna, 
and is there determined as the Mexican Fneudemys ornata cataspila.

Gundlach in tiie Anales de la Sociedad Espaiiola de Histona Natural 
in Madrid, translated into Spanish, with the addition of two species, 
namely, the marine turtles ClicJoiiia n!r!dl)< and Cdirtta htihr/cata^ 
thus brinoinu- the number of species up to twenty-four. 

Dr. Ao-ostm Stahl, the venerable patriot and naturalist of F)ayamon, 
Porto Kico, in 18S2 pu])lished a Fauna de Puerto-Kico. intended 
mainly as a catalogue of his laroe collections, but with bii(>f indica- 
tions of the characters of some of the species. In- his list of the 
re])tiles he omits two species, namcdy. ]\f((hin/<i shnui!/ M\d Ifenudac- 
t(/h(s nidhoiild^ thouo'h the latter is indicated without name, but a 
marine turtle is added, namel}" Clx/Jonin cdrdtd^ thus increasing- the 
number of species known to tvventy-tive. 

In 1896 Dr. Boulanger, the celel)rated ht'rpetoloo-ist and icthyologist 
of the British Museum, reported upon a small collection of reptiles 
from Mona Island (h^posited in the museum at Magdel)urii-, (lermany, 
by Mr. H. Boettcher. It contained but three species, ()ut the Ainelra 
turned out to be an undesci'ibed species which Dr. lioulanuci- named 
A. (ilhoguttdtd., raising- the munber of species to twenty-six. 

The twenty-seventh species also comes from Mona Island, beinoa])oid 
snake, Epicr(ifr.'< nionensts^ described in 181*8 from four specimens in the 
museum at Hamburg, Germany , ])y Dr. Zenni^ck. These specimens were 
collected on Mona Island during 181)1 and 181>-1: by Mr. CUi. Bock, who, 
at that time, sent the Hambui-gnmseum a large munber of specimens of 
other species from this interesting little island. These were reported 
u})on by Mr. Meerwarth in 11N)1, who thus was able to add three species, 
two of which he described as new forms, namely IlyJodcs inonensu and 
S2>fKvrodactyh(s nuicrolt'ph monensis^ the third being MiiopMX-efOH cornu- 
tit.s., making a total of thirty species for Porto Rico and dependent islands. 

This ends the published records of the batrachians and reptiles in 
Porto Rico." 

The present work increases the number of species to thirty-nine, being 
an addition of nine species. The number of species described as new 

"It should be added, however, that in the various iin})ortant contributions to the 
West Indian herpetology pubhslied )jy Prof. S. Garnian there are fre(juent references

been additional to the fauna they have not been noticed in the present connection.

HERPETOLOGY OE PORTO RICO. 50 1 



RELATIONS AND ORIGIN OF THE PORTO RICAN HERPETOLOGICAL 

FAUNA. 

In analyzing the composition of the Porto Rican herpetological 
fauna we lind that out of a total of thirty-tivc species (excluding the 
marine turtles) no less than twenty-one are peculiar, of which fifteen 
are peculiar to Porto Rico proper and six to Mona. 

On the other hand Porto Rico has onl}^ 2 species in common with 
the Caribbean Islands, the same "2 species also ranging over. the other 
larger Antilles. Two more species Porto Rico proper shares \Yitli the 
latter. The rest of the species occur in the Virgin Islands. Porto 
Rico thus forms with the latter a group characterized I)y an extraor- 
dinarily great proportion of peculiar species. 

But while the fauna of Porto Rico, ])oth in itself and in combination 
with the Virgin Islands, shows a high amount of specialization demon- 
strating a considerable degree of isolation in time, it must not be 
imagined thtit the separation is very deep seated. On the contrar}', 
the affinities with the other Antilles, especially the larger ones to the 
west, are very close and can readil}' l)e traced. 

Before doing so we must first dispose of those species which, as 
show^n in the ta])le of distribution of the Porto Rican species, have 
been found outside of the Antillean islands. 

The first of these is the ])lind snake, Typhlop^ liiiiihr!c<d!.i<^ of which 
specimens are said to have come from British Guiana. The range of 
this species embraces almost all the Antilles, and its presence in 
northeastern South America presents nothing unusual except, perhaps, 
the circumstance that it has been aide to retain its specific integrity 
over an area so disconnected. But examples of this kind are not rare. 
The species is further on referred to the category of forms showing 
South American affinities. 

The next species is Ilemklactylus mahoula. This is one of the most 
widely distributed geckos and seems to possess an extraordinary 
capacity for being carried about in cargoes and establishing itself 
permanently in places where so introduced. It is most likely that 
this dispersal is effected through the eggs, which are fastened to the 
objects shipped, i-ather than by transport of the adult animals them- 
selves. It is now found in South Africa, Madagascar, various parts 
of South America, Mexico, and several of the West Indian islands. 
Its introduction into Porto Rico is probably of very recent date, which 
accounts for its comparative rarity. 

The status of the frog, Leptodactylus alhilahris^ is quite different 
from that of the other species of the fauna. In the Antilles it is 
restricted to the Virgin Islands, St. Croix, Vieques, and Porto Rico. 
There is apparently no indigenous species of the genus in the Carib- 
bean chain, the other two which occur in various islands being evi- 
NAT MUS 1902 36 



562 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

dentl}^ introduced by man and belonging to widely different South 
American species. No LeptodactyJm or related form is found in 
Haiti, Cuba, or Jamaica. But the most curious feature is that a f rog 
which neither Dr. Boulanger nor I can distinguish from L. alhilabris, 
is a native of southern Mexico, State of Vera Cruz, and the Isthmus 
of Tehuantepec." 1 know of absolutely no parallel to this extraordi- 
nary range, which is inexplicable on ordinary distributional grounds, 
for certainl}^ it w^ould transgress the boundaries of the probable to 
suppose either that this species had once covered the whole country 
between Tehuantepec and the Virgin Islands and l^ecome extinct in 
the intermediate territory, or that there had at any time been a direct 
connection between the localities mentioned to the exclusion of the 
large Antilles. Nor can it for a moment be supposed that the species 
exists in the latter without having attracted attention. No doubt 
there are many species yet to be discovered in these islands, but Z. 
aXbllahrk is not likely to be one of them, for it is one of the conunon- 
est, most obtrusive, and most easilj^ caught batrachians wherever it 
occurs. In suggesting accidental introduction by man I am fully 
aware that this explanation does not at first appear plausible, as there 
does not seem to be or to have been any direct route of communication 
between southern Mexico or Yucatan and Porto Rico or the Virgm 
Islands, but I offer it as the only possibility I can think of. The 
wrecking of a vessel with a cargo of logwood or mahogany a hundred 
years or more ago might account for this remarkable distribution. 

Leaving, then, out of consideration the two species whose introduc- 
tion we ascribe to man, Hemidactylvs mahouia and Lejjtodactylus alhi- 
labrls, the herpetological fauna of Porto Rico falls into two groups, 
namely, the species which have in all probability originally extended 
their range from northeastern South America and those whose ances- 
tors came from the west, primarily from the present mainland of Cen- 
tral America, and secondarily from the other Great Antilles. 

Comparatively few, probably not more than five of the genera 
inhabiting Porto Rico, point toward South America, 

Ameiva is probably of southern origin. The West Indian members 
of this genus form several minor but fairly well circumscribed groups, 
indicating that they originated from a secondary evolutional center 
located in the archipelago. Nevertheless, on the whole they appear 
to be more closel}" allied to the types characteristic of northeastern 
South America than to the Central American forms, those found hi 
Cuba and Jamaica being most divergent, perhaps, from those of the 
mainland opposite. 

The Amphisbgenians, judging from the present distribution of the 
genus, probably also entered from the south, and the blind snakes 
{TypJdojJs) almost certainly did so. 

«Also possibly Yucatan. Ives, Proc. Phila. Acad., 1891, p. 461. 



HEEPETOLOGY OF PORTO EICO. 563 

The snakes of the genus Alsophis, though forming an ahiiost exclu- 
sively Antillean group, nevertheless betray South American relation- 
ship, and those of the genus Lelmadojyhis in a still higher degree. 

The great majority of the Porto Rican species, however, are of 
decidedly western affinities. Thus the Bxfo, the various species of 
EJeutherodacti/hiK, the AFahuya, the CehMu.s. the two boas and the 
fresh-water turtle are o])viously related to species in the Great Antilles 
to the west of Porto Rico. The Anoles and the Sphferodactylu.s are 
also allied more intimately to western species. As a matter of fact 
the most characteristic species of Anolls, for instance, A. ctimeri, 
A. cnstatellus, and the little group represented by A. piilchrUus, are 
utterly foreign to the Caribbean islands, and it is (juite apparent that 
the Anoles have developed in a secondary ev ohitional center located 
somewhere in what is now known as the Greater Antilles. 

Compared with the other Greater Antilles the herpetology of Porto 
Rico is negatively defined by the absence of a great many character- 
istic forms. This poverty is easily understood, however, when we 
reflect that Porto Rico is located at the extreme eastern and northern 
point of the two series of islands, the Greater and the Lesser Antilles, 
and that at the maxinnun distance from l)oth the Central American 
and South American mainland Porto Rico has obtained its fauna by 
immigration from both directions, and being at the farthest end has 
received the fewest number of colonists. 

The herpetological fauna as here understood, for obvious reasons, 
embraces only the main island and those of the adjacent islands with 
which it passed into American possession by the treaty of Paris. 

As has been demonstrated, Porto Rico shows great affinity herpeto- 
logically to the Virgin Islands, and the two islands belonging to the 
former, but situated intermediate, Culebra and Vieques, are also inter- 
mediate in their fauna to a certain extent. The coronelline snakes, 
however, and one of the tree-toads occurring in Vieques or Culebra or 
both are identical with those of the Virgin Islands, diflering decidedly 
from the corresponding species inhabiting Porto Rico proper. This 
is the more interesting as we know of only one species which occurs 
both in Porto Rico and Vieques or Culebra and does not also inhabit 
one or more of the Virgin Islands, viz, Splixrodactylus (jrandlsquamiH. 
The little island of ]\lona, on the other hand, is situated Ijetween 
Porto Rico and Haiti. Thus far not less than nine species are known 
to occur there, namely: 

1. H^eutherodactylus i/wtiensis. 

2. Sphserodactylus nionensis. 

3. Mahiiya sloanil. " ' 

4. Ameiva alhogiittata. 

5. Anolis monensis. 

6. Cyclura cornuta. 



564 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

7. Typhi ops himlyricalis. 

8. Ep'icmtes monensis. 

9. Ahoj)hls portoricensis. 

These also show a mixture of types. Ahophis portoricensis is tj^p- 
ical Porto Rican; SpJtxrodactylus monen.ds^ Ameiva aJhoguttata^ and 
Anolis monensis, although described as separate forms, are very closely 
allied to Porto Rican species; Mahuya sloanii occurs both in Porto 
Rico and Haiti; Eleatlierodactylus inonenslt^ and Ep>icratts monensis ^yq 
most nearly related to Haitian species, while Cye-liira cornuta is typ- 
ically Haitian, the o-enus even being unknown in Porto Rico; Typhlops 
lumhricaJis is of wide distribution, as shown above. The herpetolog- 
ical fauna of Mona is consequently exactl}^ intermediate between Porto 
Rico and Haiti, as is its geographical position. 

The herpetological relations of Porto Rico to the Virgin Islands 
immediately to the east is very close, as might be expected, located, as 
they are, within sight of each other and on the same bank limited by 
the lOU-fathom line. St. Croix, which is separated by a deep channel 
from the others, is also more distantly related, possessing, as it does, 
several species not found in the Virgin Islands proper, much less in 
Porto Rico, namely, Thecadactyl us rapicauda (possibly accidentally 
introduced), Anolis actitus, Ameiva polops, and Alsophis sancti-crucis. 

If we compare the fauna of Porto Rico with that of St. Thomas and 
St. John more in detail, we will lind that the chief difference lies in the 
absence in the latter of a great number of species occurring in the 
former, as will be seen from the following: 

Lht of Porto Rican species («) not found in St. Tliomas or St. John. 



1. Bufo lemur. 

2. Eleutherodactijlus auricnlatus. 

3. Eleutherodactylus richmondi. 

4. Eleutherodactylus unicolor. 

5. Sphperodactylus grandisquamis. 

6. Celestus pleii. 

7. A.nolis cuvieri. 

8. Anolis gmidlachi. 

9. Anolis evernianni.

14. Typhlops rostellatus. 

15. Epicrates inomatus. 

16. Leimadophis stahli. 

17. AlsopJiis portoricensis. 



It will be seen that the existence of many of these species in Porto 
Rico is not due solel}^ to the fact that it is much the larger island, but 
also to its more Avestern location and more intimate relation to the 
other large Antilles. On the other hand, some of the species in 
this list are represented in the Virgin Islands by very closely related 
forms. 

aExcludiiiii those found in Mona Island. 



HERPETOLOGY OF PORTO RICO, 565 

The numl)er of jspeeies occurring in St. Thomas and St. John l>ut 
not in Porto Rico proper are very few, as shown in the following:

2. EleutJurodactj/hi.s antillensi.'i. 
o. Sphnrodarti/hi.'^ m<(crolepis. 
4. lynana i(/uaii((. 

It will be seen in every case but one that these represent species living 
in Porto Kico, and, moreover, that three of them extend so far west 
as to include Vieques and Culebra, namely, Ele^itlurodnvtylm antil- 
/eii.sf'.s, LehiKidopliis exiguvx, and Alsoj/Iu'.s ((nfUJeiisis. The only spe- 
cies which is not represented at all in Porto Rico is Iguana iguana^ 
and it is altogether probable that this species has ))een introduced 
originally by man. 

As an olfs<^t to the three peculiar Virgin Island species mentioned 
above, which extend as far west as Vieques, we may mention for the 
sake of completeness a Porto Rican species which reaches Tortola, but 
which has not been recorded from St. Thomas or St. John, namely, 
Anolis cuvleri. 

It is then plain that the sixteen species of reptiles and batrachians 
found in St. Thomas and St. John ^ form only a herpetological appen- 
dix to Porto Rico. 

VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION. 

With regard to the vertical distribution of the batrachians and rep- 
tiles in Porto Rico it must ])e l)orne in mind that the island, although 
very mountainous, does not rise to such great altitudes as the other 
Greater Antilles. The El Yunque Mountain, which has been consid- 
ered the highest point in Porto Rico, has lately lieen determined to be 

f'Only such species are included the occurrence of which is corrol)orate<l by 
repeated finds, and consequently undoulited.

A number of species credited to St. Thomas on the strength of uncorroborated 
museum labels is here left out. It is not unusual that museum specimens are cred- 
ited to the place from which they were shii:)ped, which may have been another than 
the one in whiih they were collected. On the other hand, single specimens acci- 
dentally introduced from near-l)y islands may well be expected in a place like St. 
Thomas.

only 3,485 feet. Nevertheless, there are several species which are 
confined either to the lowlands or to the mountains respectively, while 
others range over the whole territory, from sea level to the highest 
peaks. The elevations reached ])y the batrachians and reptiles vary 
to a great extent locally, depending, as they do, on the climatic con- 
ditions. Consequently, the species inhabiting the higher altitudes 
descend lower on the northern slope of the great mountain chains 
which traverse the island from east to west, and the lowland species 
ascend higher on the southern slope. 

Only a single species ranges all the way from sea level to the high- 
est mountain tops, namely, the tree toad, or coqui {Eleutlierodactylus 
aurlcuIatuH). 

On the other hand, about ten species are confined to the lowlands, 
some never reaching, others ver}- seldom ascending, beyond 500 feet. 
In this category fall the following species: 

Bufo lemur. 

Jleniidactylus niahouia. 

SpJiderodactylus grmidisquamis. 

Mahuya slomiii. 

Anieiva exid. 

Anolis ^ulchellus. 

AtwUs jooncensis. 

Typldiypx hunhricalis. 

Alsojyhis portoricensis. 

Pseudemys palustris. 
A few species reach well into the coffee belt, though it is doubtful 
whether they go much beyond 1,000 feet altitude, namely: 

Anolis Guvieri. 

Amphishsena cseca. 

Epicrates inornatus. 

Leimadophis stahli. 
Others, again, we know to range from sea level to about 1,600 feet, 
such as — 

Leptodactyltcs alhilabris. 

Afiolis crisfatellus. 

Anolis stratulus. 
Among the species which do not descend to sea level there are a few 
confined to intermediate altitudes. These range between about 500 
and 1,500 feet, though the blind snake and the blind lizard probably 
do not reach much higher than 1,000 feet. They are: 

Celestus ])leli. 

Anolis hrugi. 

Amphishsetia hakeri. 

Typhlops rostellatus. 



HERPETOLOGY OF PORTO RIOO. ' 567 

Two species we have found occupying all the zones from an average 
altitude of, say, 500 feet to the highest mountain tops, namely: 
Anolis gundlachi. 
An olis everm arm I. 
One batrachian which also reaches the highest elevations but which 
scarcely descends below 800 feet is Eleutherodactylus rlchmondi. 

Finally a single species, thus far only known from one specimen, 
appears to be confined to the tops of the mountains, about 8,000 feet 
altitude, viz: EJeuthei'odactylus milcolor.

HEKPETOLOGY OF PORTO RIOO. 569 



BATRACHIANS AND REPTILES OF PORTO RICO. 

Custom and practical considerations account for the batrachians 
and reptiles still ])eing- treated of tog-ether, though it has been dem- 
onstrated long ago and now universally admitted l)y naturalists that 
they constitute separate classes, more nearly related perhaps to the 
birds on the one hand and to the fishes on the other than among 
themselves. The nonscientific public, however, can not ])e blamed 
for confounding- the two classes, especially since the distinguishing 
characters are chiefly anatomical, and it is consequently the more 
necessary that their distinctness be insisted on and emphasized when- 
ever the herpetologist, whose studies embrace both, addresses himself 
to this public. As it is among the objects of the present work to 
afford those who have not given special attention to this studjMi ready 
means of identifying the ""creeping-" animals of Porto Rico, it may 
not be out of place here to mention that the members of the two 
classes occurring- there can be distinguished by external characters as 
follows: 

I. Batrachia. — Body covered with a soft skin and not incased in a 
bony shell. 

II. Rcj^tifid. — Body covered with horny scales and plates, or 
incased in a bony shell, with a horny or leathery covering. 

Class BATRACHIA. 

Of the three orders composing the living l)atrachians only one, 
namely, the Salient !a^ or tailless batrachians, is represented in Porto 
Rico. This order, usually known as frogs and toads, again falls into 
three suborders, of which Porto Rico also has representatives in only 
one, namely, the Llnguata. that is, those with tongue but no ribs. 
Two families with three genera comprise the Poi'to Rican fauna and 
may be disting-uished as follows: 

KEY TO THE BATRACniAXS OF PORTO RICO ACCORDING TO GKXERA.

The above synomymy only embraces such names as are additional 
to previously published lists or directly referable to the group to 
which the Porto Rican species belongs. 

The toads (Spanish Sapo) with their warty skin are so well known 
that a generic description seems superfluous in this connection. 

Only one species of this numerous and ahnost cosmopolitan genus is 
found within our territory, though a second one has been reported 
upon insufficient or erroneous evidence.

Gakman, Bull. Essex Inst., XIX, 1887, p. 16 (part, specimens from 
Bayamon, Porto Rico) . 

This species has been united hy Peters with a related one from Santo 
Domingo, a conclusion since adopted by Boulenger and Garman. 

Though having no specimens from Santo 

Domingo for direct comparison, I venture 

to disagree with them, as Boulenger's own 

description * and Giinther's figure ^ of Santo 

Domingan specimens show characters suffi- 

^ cient to separate the two species, as, for 

Fig. 1. instance, the vastly greater development of

of the upper jaw into a labial crest, the pres- 
ence of a parietal crest, and of a prominent subnasal ridge. The 
Porto Rican specimens also have single conical tubercles under the 
digital articulations, while the Santo Domingan ones are said by Bou- 
lenoer to have toes ' ' with double subarticular tubercles. "

Iris pale brassy, sprinkled with l)lack. General color above dull clay- 
colored with a strong olive wash; blackish brown markings and an ill- 
defined hourglass-shaped mark between shoulders; also a larger black- 
ish spot on each side of the coccyx, which is marked by a pale streak; 
indications of blackish cross bands on legs; underside dirty white, 
becoming Hesh-colored behind and strongly reddish flesh color on 
underside of fenmr and nearest portion of bell}^; tips of toes dark 
brown; tips of warts on back black, those between shoulders particu- 
larly large. 

Another specimen (No. 271-1:9) was colored as follows: Upper side 
olive, strongly suffused with "gallstone yellow,*" which is particularly 
noticeable over the insertion of the fore limbs; very few traces of 
dusky markings, but the pustules are black, especially anteriorly; an 
intensely ochraceous-rufous spot on the middle of the back; on the 
underside the yellow suffusion invades the white ground-color on 
the portion nearest to the flanks. 

The third large specimen (No. 27150) was quite similar to the last, 
though without any rufous spot on the back, which seems to be an 
anomaly. Whole upper surface darker olive, and flanks, including 
space at base of fore liml) and l)elow the ear, more intenseh' and more 
well-defined yellow; underside dirty yellowish white. 

A young specimen (No. 27151) was colored as follows: General color 
above drab, more isabella-colored on head; dark markings blackish, 
those on shoulders pale-edged externally; flanks with a purplish suffu- 
sion and indications of a broad longitudinal band, well-defined and 
pale-edged above, l)ut gradually fading below into the pale Isabella 
color of the bell}^; underside with a network of coarse dark-grav mot- 
tlings and marblings. 

Habitat. — The toad seems to be somewhat rare in Porto Rico, pos- 
sibly because of lack of suitable localities. Dr. Stahl informed me 



HEBPETOLOGY OF PORTO RICO. 



573 



that during- all his forty 3^ ears of collecting- in the island he had never 
come across it himself, and the six specimens which in that time he 
had obtained were brought to him l)y the peasants as curiosities. 
Neither Mr. Baker nor any of the Fish Commission parties saw it, and 
for a long while all the incpiiries of Dr. Richmond and myself were 
unavailing. The natives knew the name "Sapo concho," but when 
told to bring specimens they invarial)ly handed in some Eleidherodac- 
tylm or Lej^todartijlas. A rumor had it that a certain druggist in 
Arecibo many years ago had had a specimen on exhibition in his store, 
and consequently wi> at last repaired to that city as a last resort. The 
druggist was found and corroborated the rumor, but the specimen 
had long since disappeared. We made diligent inquiries in the neig-h- 
l)orhood through our young friend Mr, Enricpie L. Brascoechea, tmd 
finally, as we had almost given up hope, he found an old beggar 
who rememl)ered a place where as a boy he had seen the sapos. He 
was promised a sul)stantial reward, and on the last e\'ening of our sta}^ 
in Arecibo brought in five fine specimens captured al)Out 3 miles south 
of the town. He said he had found them in holes under the roots of 
palm trees at the l)order of a fresh-water pond, where they keep in 
hiding during the day. 

Bvfo Jeinur is the only toad found in Porto Rico, and is not known 
from any other island. In Vieques we were informed that the '\Sapo 
concho" occurs, but we failed to obtain specimens, although we made 
special efl'orts and ofi'ered a high rew^ard for specimens."

"Bufo marmus (Linnpeiis), which occurs in many West Indian islands, probably 
introduced, is only mentioned here, because Reinhardt and Luetken write (Vid. 
Meddel. Naturhist. Foren., 1S62, p. 202; author's reprint, p. 50, footnote) that it is 
occasionally brought to St. Thomas with lumber from " Vietiuesand Hayti." There is 
no reason to believe, however, that the reported origin of these imported toads is 
correctly given by their informant in so far as Vieques is concerned. Bifo marimis 
is a very large species with enormous triangular parotoid glands, wliich are nearly 
smooth.

Although not a frog- in a strictly scientilic sense, the Lej>todactylus 
counterfeits the external appearance of the true frogs to perfection, 
and the one living in Porto Rico will probably always be known to the 
English-speaking people there as the frog, as it has always been known 
to the Spanish population by the name of " Rana." 

Only one species occurs in Porto Rico and dependent islands, pos- 
sibly originally introduced through the agency of man, as elsewhere 
suggested in this work (p. 562). The genus is tropical American.

Like Boulenger, I have compared Tehuantepec specimens. Cope's 
C. lahlalis^ with the Antillean series, without being able to discover 
any tangible difference upon which to base a separation. To prove 
that there is no difference whatever in proportions I submit the fol- 
lowing measurements, carefully taken from two individuals of identi- 
cal size:

Whether BrocchV^ Ztptodaetyh/s coliginosus" realh^ l^elongs here is 
somewhat more doiibtfal. The iio-uro docs not much resemble this 
species, nor does the description mention the conspicuous white labial 
stripe. Bocourt's observation that the voice of the species collected 
by him at Isal)al and at Pansos resembles the ba} ing- of a dog and 
may be rendered by the syllable rJiouap! rhoiutp! is also at variance 
with my own experience with L. aJhUahrls in Porto Rico.

('oloration of living specimens.— Adult; U.S.N.M. No. 26820: L. S. 
No. 9043; Mameye.s, Porto Eico, March 3, 1900. General color al)ove 
olive, the dusky marking's dark grayish brown, nearly blackish brown 
below the dorso-lateral fold and on femur; the dorso-lateral fold and 
narrow edges around the dark markings pale olive gray; the trans- 
ocular band and cutting edge of lip dark grayish brown; the supra- 
labial light band pale straw yellow; underside whitish; throat finely 
sprinkled with dark chocolate In-own; iris olive silvery, overlaid with 
blackish. 

Another adult specimen, same locality and time (U.S.N.M. No. 
26821, L. S. No. 901:'l), had the general color a little more cla^^ey and 
the dark markings darker and arranged longitudinally. (In alcohol 
the middle line of the back becomes quite light, forming a pale median 
band from between eyes to vent, bordered on both sides by a blackish 
line.) 

J7/M«(/.— U.S.N.M. 26891; L. S. No. 9040; Catalina plantation, about 
890 feet altitude; March 1, 1900. Above clay-colored, becoming darker 
posteriorly and on sides below the dorso-lateral fold which, like the 
warts on the sides and a few on the back, is copper colored, the 
fold being edged with dusky below; a broad cream-colored band from 
tip of snout under eye and tympanum to arm, bordered above and 
below by very distinct black lines, the upper one through nostril, eye, 
and tj^mpanum, the lower margining the upper lip; the light labial 
band is continued as upper side of the arm, which is slightly more 
brownish, and the l)lack band below also continues halfway down to 
the elbow; a black mark in the groin; hind limbs pale olive, barred 
with black; posterior surface of femur with a conspicuous longitudinal 
streak of silvery white, margined witli black; iris golden, overlaid 
with black. 

In a large lot (56) of specimens from Vieques (U.S.N.M. Nos. 27084 
to 27139; L. S. No. 9052; March 24, 1900), of all sizes, there is a great 
amount of individual variation in color. The ground color of the 
back varies between reddish brown through various shades of brown 
and olive to olive green and even olive yellow, mostly with dusky 
markings and mottlings between the dorso-lateral folds, though often 
quite uniform, especially when the ground color is more or less olive. 
The light labial line is variously developed, but nearly always plainly 
indicated. The dusky markings on the back show no tendency to

578 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

Beak white with black edges, the cutting edges plainly denticulated 
like the dental rows; lips with a double row of papilUv except on the 
median half of the upper lip, the sides forming an inward fold; the 
series of labial teeth f . all ecj^ually long and occupying the whole width 
of the lips; the lirst uppei- series narrow!}^ interrupted in the middle-, 
the others uninterrupted. 

Lines of muciferous ducts rather indistinct in this specimen. They 
are better developed in the specimens of No. 27234, taken by me at 
Utuado on April 9, 1900, especially in 27234c7, which shows also the 
lateral lines. Two lines start on the head; one between the nostrils, 
the other near the corner of the mouth, converging backward above 
and below the eye and meeting a short distance behind the latter; 
from this point they diverge again toward the tail; from the eye a 
short line of crypts descends a short distance in a vertical direction; 
a lateral line begins above the anterior end of the spiraculum and 
curving above the latter is lost above the insertion of the hind limbs. 

Color (in alcohol) dusk}^ olive gray on back, underside and tail 
whitish, the latter more or less irregularly marbled and mottled with 
dusky.

The total length of the largest adult animal being 144 mm., it is 
consequently a little more than three times as large as the largest 
tadpole. 

Habitat. — The frog — as we may well call the Leptodactylm alMlahris 
on account of its exceedingly frog-like aspect — is found all over Porto 
Rico and Vieques near streams and in marshy places, except in the 
highest altitudes. It has been found as high up as Adjuntas (about 
1,400 feet altitude) by Mr. Baker, but it is doubtful whether it ascends 
above the coffee l)elt. On the northern and eastern side of El Yunque 
Mountain Dr. Richmond and 1 did not see it much above the Catalina 
plantation, or al)out 000 feet altitude. 

Ilahits. — The l)reeding season of this frog seems to be early in the 
year, as we found a young one with the tail still unabsorbed on Feb- 
ruary 20. Full-grown tadpoles were also observed at the Catalina 
plantation on March 1. In a little stream behind the town of Utuado, 
on April 7, I not only obtained tadpoles in all stages, but also observed 



HERPETOLOQY OF PORTO RTCO.

the remarkable foamy "nest" of this species, with numerous small l)lack 
larvae just hatched. In raising a large flat stone in the shallow stream 
I found a compact ball of snowy foam of a somewhat gelatinous con- 
sistency. The ball was about To mm. in diameter, and through the 
center there extended a canal about the width of a linger. In this 
hollow the blackish larvae were located. 

The voice of this species is fairly loud for its size, and can be 
expressed by the word "pink"' in fre(|uent succession.

This genus is usually, but wrongly, known as Hylodes. A genus of 
this name was instituted by Fitzinger in 1826,^ based upon two species 
onl}^ one of which must be the type. They were Tlyla (jTavenliorstli 
Fitzinger and Ilyla rcmoides Spix. The former is a nomen nudum and 
was never described, the generic term Hylodes being thus restricted 
to //. rajwides. Regarding the word Hylodes as improperly formed, 
Wagler, in 1880, substituted'' Enydrohius^ which consequently is a 
synonym pure and simple. Tschudi, in 1838,'^ expressl}^ recognizes H. 
ranoides as the type of Ilylodes^^ but at the same time he erected Elosia 
for Lichtenstein's Ilyla 7iasus (or oiasuhis, as Tschudi writes), not 
knowing that this species was identical with 11. ranoides., the tj^pe of 
Hylodes. This error has been perpetuated by later writers, chiefly 
led b}^ Dumeril and Bibron, and also possibly influenced by the fact 
that Fitzinger himself, in 18-i3, followed the example of these authors 
and substituted H. inartinicensis., which was not described until 1838, 
as type for the genus established by himself in 1826. 

As to the proper name for the genus the choice lies between the one

Elei(,theTodactyl((s is a genus characteristic of tropical America, and 
comprises a large number of species often dithcult to distinguish. In 
man}" respects they resemljle the true tree toads, though structurally 
they are nearer the frog-like Lejjtodactiilu^. 

Numerous species occur in the Antillean islands, live being found in 
Porto Kico and dependent islands.

The identity of the tree toad of Porto Kico has been a matter of 
great uncertainty. Peters, who compared Porto Rican specimens 
with the type of lf(/lodc.s in(it'f!)i!censix from Martinique, declares 
them to be identical; and Garman, who also had ])efore liim specimens 
from both localities, came to the same result.

I have no specimen.s fvoni Martinique itself, but with a large series 
from Guadeloupe (whence it is said the species was introduced to 
Martinique), which, therefore, I take to represent E. martinicensis 
fairlv well, and another large series from St. Kitts agreeing with the 
Guadeloupe series, I nu;st dissent from the above conclusion. The 
Porto Rican specimens are certainly ver}^ close to the latter species, 
and the proportions of the hind legs to the length of the head and 
l>ody are nearly the same; nevertheles.s, the Porto Rican specimens 
have constantly a shorter second toe and the exposed tympanum 
averages larger. In the Porto Rican specimens the end of the first 
toe when pressed alongside the second nearly reaches the disk of the

latter, while in the Guadeloupe, St. Kitts, and Tobago specimens the 
interval between the two disks is considerably larger than the diameter 
of the disks. 

In both respects the Porto Rican specimens agree well with typical 
Cuban specimens of E. auriculatm (Cope), from which 1 can not sepa- 
rate them. Boulenger refers three Santo Domingo specimens in the 
British Museum to the same species, and describes them as having the 
first toe "as long as second," a character he also uses in the "key" as 
the distinction of //. auriciHatus^ and I take it that by this phrase he 
intends to express the same relation between the toes as I have 
described above. A poorly preserved specimen in the U. S. National 
Museum (No. 9858) from Santo Domingo I am also unable to separate 
from E. auriculatuH. 

I can not agree with Boulenger, however, in placing Reinhardt and

by this species is simply endless, there being scarcely ever two speci-

less. The description of the first adult specimen collected may serve 
as an example, however, to which 1 may then append the notes writ- 
ten down with large series of living specimens before mo.

and reticulated with blackish. 

At our camp about 500 feet below the top of El Yunque Mountain 
(3,485 feet) I gathered, between February 24 and February 27, over 
50 specimens, adult and young, upon which I based my observations 
on the truly extraordinary varialiility of this species, both as to ground 
color and pattern. 

While the adult specimens seem to show a more uniform pattern with 
certain nearly constant features, namely, a pale triangular snout to 
the middle of the upper eyelids, followed by a dusky cross-band and a 
blackish narrow streak along the canthus rostralis through the eye 
(the horizontal pupil forming part of this line) over the ear to the 
shoulder, the individual range in their ground color is very great, from 
pale olive gray through clay color and pale cinnamon rufous to dark 
sepia. Their power of changing their general color is also great, for 
one which when caught on the ground under an old palm leaf was 
nearly blackish brown, changed within a quarter of an hour to pale 
clay color. The most abnormal among the large specimens is rather 
dark grayish brown (slightly paler after being caught) and covered 
with numerous cream-colored irregular blotches, which on the legs 
assume the character of more or less regular cross-bands. But the 
young specimens show a much wider and more perplexing range of 
variation, for while the pattern indicated above for the adults can be 
traced in perhaps most of these youngsters, in others it is absolutely 
obliterated. Yet in all this bewildering variability there ma}^ be 
traced several ditl'erent styles which, however, are connected by all 
sort of intermediate individuals. 

The most striking of these patterns consists in a cinnamon-colored 
stripe down the middle of the back edged with dusky and widening 
on the sacrum and toward the head, where it is al)ruptly cut ott" by the 
interorbital dusky cross-band; this triangular expansion thus formed 
incloses on the occiput a small spot which, like the sides, is bright 
light yellowish green; the pale triangle on the snout and cross-bands 
on the hind limbs are similarly colored, but much duller. This style is 
not rare, though apparently confined to the smallest specimens. I 
found four essentially alike at the base of the leaves of the same air- 
plant, probably belonging to the same brood. 

The most common pattern (found in perhaps 75 per cent of the 
young specimens) consists in a pair of elongated pale dorsal marks 
slightly curved, with the convexitv toward the median line, as well as 



HERPETOLOGT OF PORTO RICO. 587 

a similiirly colored .spot on the occiput and cross-hais on the hind leg-s, 
all the pale marks more or less plainly edged with dusk}-; the ground 
color varies from dark to light grayish brown overlaid to a varying 
degree with yellowish or reddish. This style is evidently only a 
moditication of the one descril)ed above, the dark ground color haAing 
encroacluKl upon the light flanks. Some of these specimens art* so 
(hirk that the pattern can l)e made out only with ditticult}'. One of 
the large adult specimens shows distinct traces of the dorso-hitei'al 
pale semilunar marks. 

The next style, rt^presented ])y a few^ specimens onh, is very diflerent. 
These are nearly uniform dark brownish gray with a very narrow, 
sharjily defined pale line from tip of snout down the middle of the 
back to the vent, where it ])if urcates and extends along the posterior 
edge of each femur; another line, less pale, crosses this one on the 
interorl^ital space. Several specimens combine the common pattern 
as described above with this narrow median line. 

A single young specimen in the lot is light olive gra}" with a pale 
longitudinal ])and on the middle line from snout to vent so broad as to 
nearlv till the interorbital space; the post-femoral streak is faintly indi- 
cated; the pale lines are indistinctly outlined with dusky and there 
rare similar cross marks visible on the hind legs. 

A curious feature is also the varialiility in the coloration of the iris. 
In the younger specimens it is ])rassy, more or less overlaid with 
dusky. In the adults, however, it is golden with a vertical blackish 
streak in the middle of the lower half. However, if the sides of the 
face are much darker than the region above, the iris is also darker in 
the lower half below the narrow horizontal pupil which, as indicated 
above, forms the continuation of the canthal black line. 

That the coqui or tree toad in other localities assumes a coloration 
closely agreeing with the surroundings is proven l)y several specimens 
collected in the western part of the island. A large adult specimen 
caught by Dr. Richmond near the summit of the pass between Adjuntas 
and Ponce, was of a reddish lu'own ground color, closely resem- 
bling the clay upon which it was found (U.S.N.M. No. 27280; L, S. 
No. 9067). The four specimens, on the other hand, which we took 
under stones in the white clay hills east of Ponce on April It), were 
nearl}^ uniform pale clay colored, with no markings, not even a trace 
of a pale dorso-lateral band. 

IlahUat. — The "coqui" is common all over Porto Rico, from sea 
level to the top of the highest mountains; in fact we found it most 
abundant in the excessively damp woods near the top of El Yunque. 
It does not occur on Vieques, nor has it been found on Mona Island, 
a distribution quite unexpected in view of the fact that the species also 
occurs in Santo Domingo and eastern Cuba. 

Ilaljit.s. — Although by no means confined to living on or among the 



588 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 



trees this species probably deserves the name of tree toad more than 
any of the other species of the genus inhatjiting- these islands. A 
favorite place of concealment during the day we found to be the axils 
of the leaves of palms and liliaceous plants, but it was also caught 
under the bark of trees, fallen logs, stones, or in crevices in the rocks, 
cla}" banks, or in holes in trees. 

They keep usually quiet during the day, ])ut tow^ard dusk the}^ 
come out from their hiding places and the island then l)egins to 
resound with their call notes. These I believe to be different in the 
adults and the young. The former utter a loud and rather sonorous 
o-ki'-ki'-ki' or simply a persistently repeated o-ki', o-ki' , 
The chorus of soft "pit, pit, pit"" around our camp in the evening I 
attributed to the young ones. 

Living specimens placed in a glass jar adhere to the sides chiefl}^ by 
their digital pads or disks. The bell}^ is tlattened against the glass, 
but there is apparently no special adhesive area. 

The reproduction of this species is most extraordinary in that the 
young escape from the egg a full developed frog without undergoing 
any tadpole stage or metamorphosis. The eggs are usually deposited 
in the damp axils of an air plant, about 20 to 80 in a lump. The de- 
velopment of the young in the egg is remarkable for the fact that the 
anterior and posterior limbs appear simultaneously and that there is 
no trace of gills. In al^out three weeks the young escape from the 
egg, the only sign of immaturity being a short rudiment of tail which 
is absorl)ed, however, in a few hours. The discovery of this extraor- 
dinary ])atrachian development, which so strongly foreshadows that of 
the amniote vertebrates, was made by Dr. Bello y Espinosa in 1870 
and has been confirmed and elaborated by Gundlach and Peters.

ELEUTHERODACTYLUS ANTILLENSIS " ( Reinhardt and Luetken. ) 

1863. Ilylodcx aiitillciisix Reinhardt and Luetkkx, Yid. Meddel. Naturh. Foren. 
(Copenhagen), 1862, p. 209; author's separate, p. ;>7 (type Ideality, St. Thomas; 
type in Mu8. C'openh.). 

This species has l)ecn placcnl as a synonym of K (airicuhifu.s hy 
I>c)iileni>'ei% l)ut the two are very different indeed. If individuals of 
the same size arc phiced side l)y side the diti'ercnce in the size of tlie 
leg's and feet are pjirticularly striking, they being much shorter in 
E. anttlh nxls. The fore lim])s are especially minute, so much so that 
the length from axilla to tip of longest linger is about one-half the 
length from tip of snout to vent, while in E. <iur/ci(lafi(s the corres- 
ponding length of arm and hand greatly exceeds, often ])y 83 per cent, 
half the total length of head and body. As a rule, the heel and elbow 
of the adpressed limbs barely touch in II. antille)isi,s^ while in E.

mu'lculatMS they overlap considerably. In the latter the heels also 
overlap when the bent bind limbs are placed vertically to the axis of 
the body — while in this position the heels of E. antlllensis just meet. 
Notwithstanding the enormous variation in the coloration of E. ax/'lc- 
ulatus, there seems to be some difference in the average color of lioth 
species. The larger E. antillensis ol)tained in Vieques are nearly 
uniformh^ pale above, and are therefore closely approximated by 
the pale specimens of E. auricidahis which we collected in the white 
limestone hills near Ponce (Nos. 27314-17), ])ut all the young ones 
were "dull grayish brown with regular dusky longitudinal markings," 
thus presenting none of the peculiar patterns so characteristic of the 
young E. auricidatvs and described above under the latter species.

This is the largest of eleven specimens collected by us in Vieques. 
The largest specimen from St. Thomas described by Reinhardt and 
Luetken measured 31 mm. in total length. This species seems there- 
fore to be somewhat smaller than K aiirlculatus. 

Coloration of living HpeGiinenn. — The larger specimens collected by 
us in Vieques were pale gra}?^ with scarcely any dusky marking except 
a dark streak from nostrils, through eye, over and behind the tym- 
panum, a few dark mottlings on the posterior concealed part of the 
thigh, and a dusky longitudinal line on inner side of tibia and tarsus. 
The smaller specimens were of a uniform dull grayish brown above 
with regular longitudinal dusky markings. 

llnbltat. — This species seems to be contined to Vieques and St. 
Thomas and is apparently not common. Its occurrence on St. John 
and St. Croix is somewhat doubtful, according to Reinhardt and 
Luetken. It was not found by the U. S. Fish Commission parties in 
Vieques during their visit in 1899, but a young specimen from this 
island is in the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen.

The only place we found it in Vieques was in the n(nirly dry bed of 
a small creek back of the town of Isa])ella Segunda, wliere they kept 
themselves concealed on the damp ground under flat stones.

Several specimens (26958-62) taken at an altitude of a])out 2,078 
feet near the top of El Yunque Mountain, Februar}^ 24-26, were essen- 
tially like the above, to the description of which may be added that 
the brown color on the back becomes more of an Indian-red on sacrum 
and femur, fading- to a clear rufous flesh-color on the heel. The lar- 
gest specimen in this lot has the throat strongly sufi'used with gam- 
boge-yellow. 

This species seems to be as remarka])le for the stability of its color- 
ation as E. aariculat'iis is for the reverse. 

Remarl's. — The present species, which I take great pleasure in ded- 
icating to Dr. Charles W. Richmond in grateful memory of cheerful 
companionship in the native haunts of this interesting novelty, is appar- 
ently nearest related to MeutherodaGfylus Jentas (Cope), from which 
it difl'ers in many important points. Thus, the vomerine teeth are 
placed much farther back from the interior nares, and the second finger 
is considerably longer than the first instead of equaling- it in length; 
there is no trace of a web between the toes and the outer metatarsal 
tubercle is much larg-er. The coloration also is difi^erent and remark- 
ably constant. 

Habitat. — This new species thus far has only been collected on El 
Yunque Mountain, from an altitude of about 900 feet to near the top. 
It was found on damp ground under stones and leaves.

Remofi-ks. — The present species is so different from the other Eleu- 
therodactyli in Porto Rico, and in fact from all the species of this 
multitudinous genus that a special comparison with any of them is 
quite unnecessar3^ The declivous snout with the extreme posterior 
position of the nostrils are quite unique, and I know of no West 
Indian species which might be regarded as nearly allied. The uniform 
coloration above and below is also remarkable.

Class REPTILIA. 

Order SQUAMATA. 

This order eiiibnicos the lizards and tlie snakes, which in most cases 
may be easily told apart by the former possessing legs. A small 
number of lizards, however, are entirely limbless, externally resem- 
l)ling snakes very closely. The only limbless lizards in Porto Rico are 
the amphisbffinians, which are readily distinguished from the snakes by 
having no imln'icate scales, the integument being divided by longi- 
tudinal and transverse grooves into squarish segments which form 
regular rings around the })ody. 

Suborder SAURIA. 

The lizards form the most numerous group of the reptiles in Porto 
Rico there being no less than nineteen species out of a total of twenty - 
eight land reptiles.

602 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

Habitat. — In 1881 Dr. Gimdlach wrote that thi.s species had not been 
observed by him in Porto Rico, but had been sent b}^ Dr. Stahl, who 
had found it in a house at the capital, San Juan, adding- that "it seems 
to ])e rare." Dr. Stahl does not give this species in his Fauna of the 
following year (1882), but on page 71 he mentions that Don Tomas 
Blanco, a pharmacist in Porto Rico, had met with "another species of 
the gecko family," which he himself had observed later on in Agua- 
dilla and other places. It is probably the present species to which he 
refers. It was not collected by Mr. Baker, nor by any of the Fish 
Commission naturalists. Dr. Richmond and I were equally unsuc- 
cessful. However, the species was reported as having been sent from 
Porto Rico by Latimer as early as 1868, and Boettger mentions two 
specimens in the Museum Senckenbergianum donated in 1879 by 
Mr. Carl Knoblauch; Garman also mentions specimens from Porto 
Rico in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at ('ambridge, Massa- 
chusetts, and, finally, I have recently examined a specimen in the 
museum in Hamburg collected by Mr. Herman Engel, in San Juan. 
//. mahouia is a species of extremely wide distribution. Besides 
having been found in various other West Indian islands, it occurs in 
man}^ places in South Ameiica, South Africa, and Madagascar. It 
has prol)ably been carried to many distant places in ships, and its 
occurrence in Porto Rico is undoubtedly due to a similar agency.

This Sphxroddcfijlus^ of which we now possess a large series, dif- 
fers in no other respect from typical S. macrolejns from St. Thomas 
than in the size of the dorsal scales. 1 owe the opportunity of a direct 
comparison with specimens of the latter to the kindness of Prof. S. 
Garman. The Vieques and Porto Rican specimens agree completely, 
and their difference from the St. Thomas form is sufficient to warrant 
their separation by name.

Coloration of living specimens. — Adult; U.S.N.M., No. 27007; 
L. Stejneger, No. 9045; Luquillo, March 4, 1900. General color 
tawny-olive, with indistinct marblings of darker raw 
umber; across the shoulders a wide, black band, 
edged anteriorly and posteriorly with whitish, and 
inclosing two pure white spots; underneath, pale 
Isabella color; chin and throat, pure raw sienna; 
'^^MfW, underside of tail suflused with russet; iris, brassy, 

^^^^^ overlaid with blackish, leaving a very narrow bright 

ring bordering the pupil. 

Another specimen (No. 27008, L. S., No. 9046)

All the above specimens which were brought us by the children in 
Luquillo, and which were said to have been caught inside the huts 
and houses of the natives differed notably in coloration from the 
specimens which we ourselves collected afterwards, both in Vieques 
and near Ponce, under stones far from human habitations. 

Three of the specimens on the })each at Vieques (Nos. 27142-4; L. S.,

No. iHlSa) on March 2(5, were isabella-colored with dusky spots on 
back and upper side of legs, the tail siraihir l)ut more ochraceous; 
the scapular band less extensiv^e than in tlie Luquillo specimens, and 
without white edges, in two specimens jet black with pure white spots; 
in the third, the scapular band was merely indicated, the great differ- 
ence being in the color of the head including chin and throat and part 
of the neck which were uniform, unspotted, orange-ochraceous, 
approaching ochraceous-rufous, the black ej^eball shining through the 
skin as greenish spots; ])reast, belh^, and legs underneath, pale dral), 
and underside of tail, ochraceous. The fourth specimen (No. 27145; 
L. S., No. 9056) was entirely different; the whole upper surface was 
tawny olive with dusky irregular spots; on the shoulder, traces of the 
black shoulder band with the white spots; the head was of the same 
ground color as the rest of the upper surface, but with markings of a 
similar pattern as tig. 52; throat and chin with very distinct irregular 
dusky spots. 

In the specimens collected in the white clay hills about 8 miles 
east of Ponce on April 10 (Nos. 27306-12) two similar t^pes of colora- 
tion are also easily distinguishable, namely, those with uniform yellow 
head without dusky markings but with the tail spotted like the l)ack, 
and those with an unspotted ochraceous tail but a 
drab-colored head with a pattern, like ffg. 52, and 
longitudinal dusky marks on the back. In all these 
specimens the scapular band is limited to a black 
median spot. 

Habitat. — Sj)Jiserodactylus grandisquamis, which 
is the form with the largest scales, is confined to 
Porto Rico and Vieques. On the east it is repre- 
sented in St. Thomas and the other Virgin Islands 
by 8. macrolepis^ with smaller scales, while on the 
west a form with still smaller scales is found on 
Mona Island. 

As earh' as 1863 Reinhardt and Luetken recorded 
a large-scaled individual from Vieques and it has 
since been recorded from Porto Rico by various 
authors as 8. macrolejtls. Mr. A. B. Baker in 1S99 
collected several specimens near Isabella Segunda on 
Vieques, where we also secured a few in 1900. We also collected a 
large series in Luquillo, a small town on the main island just oppo- 
site, and later on some near Ponce, on the south side. I have also 
examined four specimens in the Hamburg Museum, collected by Mr. J. 
Michaelis at Arecibo in 1900. It thus seems to occur all around the 
island near sea level; it is probably confined to the lowlands, as we 
did not see it nor hear of it in the higher altitudes.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902o 



Habits. — Like most geckos the Lucia or Santa Lucia, as the Sphpuro- 
dactylus was called b}^ the natives, is probably nocturnal or crepus- 
cular, as we saw none except such as we caught under stones or in other 
hiding places. The children in Luquillo })rought us numerous speci- 
mens which were said to have ))een taken in the huts of the natives, 
though we saw none in the miserable shanty which we ourselves inhab- 
ited. On Vieques we found a few specimens on the beach near Isabella 
Segunda under the pebbles of surf- worn coral of the size from a walnut 
to that of a fist. In the white limestone hills east of Ponce we also 
found them under small stones.

SPHAERODACTYLUS MONENSIS" (Meerwarth). 

1901. SplKicrodacfijhts macrolepis a moneimt^ Meerwarth, Mitth. Natiirh. Mus. 
Hamburg, XYIII, ]>. 20 (type locality, Mona Island; types, Ham- 
burg Mus., nos. 1207a-l)). 

This form is diagnosed by Mr. Meerwarth as having 4:<> to 48 scale 
rows around the body and as having- the scales on the upper side of 
the snout imbricate. 

Through the kindness of the authorities of the Naturhistorische 
Museum in Hamburg I was allowed to examine the two type speci- 
mens. I found the scales decidedly smaller than in specimens of 
S. macrolepis from St. Thomas, consequenth' still smaller than in 
8. gr'andisquamis. The specimens are quite young and j^ale. On the 
smallest there are indications of the shoulder band. The scales on the 
chest are keeled. 

Hahitat. — This species seems to be confined to Mona Island, where 
a couple of specimens were collected in 1891 by Mr. Bock and sent to 
the museum in Hamburg.

The Slipper v-backs, as these skinks (Scincidie) are called by the 
En<j^lisb-speakiiio- people of the Antillean islands because of their 
smooth, shiny surface, belong to a family of lizards widely distributed 
over the Tropics of both hemispheres. The}' are not numerous in 
America, however, and in the territory we are here dealing- with only 
one species occurs.

A direct comparison between the six typical specimens of JI. ful- 
gUIa from Jamaica (U.S.N.M., No. 5759) and the specimen from 
Porto Rico here figured and described, for tlie loan of which I am 
greath' indebted to Prof. S. Garman, convinces me that Bocourt and 
Garman are correct in regarding them as distinct forms. I can not 
agree, however, with Professor (xarman in the nomenclature he pro- 
poses, following Bonlanger, as he does, in ascri))ing the name J/, shuoiu 
(Daudin) to the Jamaican form. True, Daudin referred Sloane's 
Lacertns mino)' Ixvls, from Jamaica, to his Scrncffi^- .sloanil under the 
impression that it was the same species as the specimen he described 
as being in the ''Museum d'histoire naturelle de Paris,"" without giving 
the locality of tlie latter, but we have Dumeril and Bibron's express 
statement to the elfect that his type was collected in St. Thomas by 
Richard pere," and according to modern rtdes of nomenclature the 
name follows the type. It is consequently the Jamaican form which 
requires a different name, Wiegmann's J/, i^j^jllonotus lieing apparently 
available for this form. 

1 have been unable to find any character by which the Porto Rico 
specimen can be separated from topical J/, doan'il. The t3^pe of the 
latter has a somewhat abnormal arrangemiMit of the frontonasal and 
the prefrontals, the former being very short and the latter broadly in 
contrast, l)ut on the whole the St. Thomas form seems to be the same 
as the Porto Rican. 

Professor Garman has pointed out the characters separating the 
two forms from flamaica and Porto Rico, though I nmst add that one 
of the characters, namely, the alleged lower niuu})er of scales from 
chin to vent in the Jamaican species does not seem to hold, as in our 
series the number \'aries from 48 to 60. On the other hand, there is 
a strong tendency in the Jamaican form towards three pairs of nuchals. 
Of the six specimens before me there is only one specimen with two 
pairs of nuchals; two have 3 on one side and 2 on the other; while 
three specimens have three pairs of enlarged luichals. 

It must lie admitted that no one single character seems to be abso- 
lutely constant, but it is believed that it will always be possible to 
refer a specimen to its proper category l)y a combination of the domi- 
nant characters. Thus, separated supranasals and three pairs of

nuchals seem to predominate in Jamaican specimens, Avhile suprana- 
sals in contact and two nuchals belong more to the eastern form. 

During my visit to Berlin in 1901 I was enabled to examine two inter- 
esting type specimens in the Natural History Museum there, thanks to 
the kindness of the curator, Dr. G. Tornier. They were Euprej)€S semi- 
taeniatus and E. spilonotus, both described by Wiegmann from unknown 
localities. The latter (No. 3785) has three pairs of nuchals and the supra- 
nasals are not in contact, thus agreeing with the Jamaican form. The 
other (No. 5290), E. semitseniatus, has two pairs of nuchals and the 
supranasals are in contact; it has also 32 scale rows around the body. 
In these respects it agrees with 3L sloanii., but the coloration is so 
different and so peculiar that I can not refer it to this species. On 
the head and anterior portion of the body there are two very dark 
brown longitudinal bands, with a narrow, light band on the middle 
line. The dark bands gradually taper off posteriorly, disappearing 
on the middle of the back. The lateral dark band is traceable to the 
groin.

VaHation. — This species, like all the others of the genus, shows con- 
siderable variation, especially in the head shields. Thus, the type has a 
remarkably short frontonasal, l)ehind which the prefrontals are broadly 
in contact. Sometimes there are only four supralabials in front of the 
so-called subocular, which in this case is the fifth labial. Garman 
states that there are occasionally only three supraoculars, and that the 
number of scales on median line between chin and vent varies from 60 
to 63, but a larger series would probabl}' show a greater variation. 
The normal number of scales around the bod^y is stated to l)e 30. 

The two specimens recorded by Boulenger from Mona Island have 
the supranasals touching behind the ventral without forming a suture; 
frontonasal broader than long: five or six supralabials anterior to sub- 
ocular; 32 scales around the bod}^; typical coloring. 

Three specimens from Mona Island in the museum at Hamburg (No. 
1476 a-c) have all two pairs of nuchals and two pairs of chin-shields in 
contact; in two specimens the supranasals are in contact, while in one 
they are barely separated. K fourth specimen (No. 1206) has the 
supranasals similarly arranged and in addition three pairs of nuchals. 

Habitat . — This species, which is recorded from Vieques (Riise), Porto 
Rico (Cope, Peters, Gundlach, Stahl, Garman), and Mona (Boulenger, 
Meerwarth), must be quite rare now, as it was not seen either by Mr.

Kichmond and myself. Its present scarcity is probably due to the 
mongoose. 

Mabuya sloanll occurs also in the Virgin Islands, and according to 
Garman the form inhabiting Haiti is identical with the Porto Rican 
species.

The family Teiidge, to which the Ameivas belong, represent in the 
New World the Old World typical Lacertida?. Some of the species, 
like the South American "Teju," reach a considerable size. In places 
where the true Iguana does not occur, as in Porto Rico, the}^ are often 
known to the inhabitants b}^ this name. 

Within our area only two forms occur, namelj^, Ameiva exiil^ in 
Porto Rico and Vieques, and the form recently described by Boulenger 
as A. alboguttata from Mona Island. They are very closely related, 
the latter being plainly descended from the former. The main differ- 
ences are as follows: 

a^ Generally white-spotted only on the posterior half of the back; femoral jjores 
averaging 15.5 on each side; number of scales in fifteenth tail segment from 
base averaging 45; median gulars forming a group of slightly enlarged scales; 
plates on upper arm much wider than long A. exul, p. 612. 

n^ Back with white spots to the neck; femoral pores averaging 13.3 on each side; 
number of scales in fifteenth tail segment from Ijase 34; median gular grouji of 
enlarged scales less <lifferentiated, often confluent with the adjoining scales;

ules of slightly varying size, a faintly indicated 
band of slightly larger ones extending across the 
middle in which again the median ones are forming an ill-defined cen- 
tral group of somewhat enlarged scales; on the portion between the 
two throat folds (the so-called mesopthvchium) several rows of larger 
hexagonal scales; back, sides, and upper side of limbs covered with 
very fine uniform granules; underside of body with ten longitudinal

These dimensions are only those of a medium-sized individual. The 
largest specimen in our collection (No. 25570, from Cayo Santiago, off 
the Playa de Humacao) measures to the vent 160 mm. and to the tip 
of the tail 470 mm., but I am sure that some of the specimens of 
apparently patriarchal age which I saw in the city of San Juan near 
the quartermaster's wharf were considerably larger. 

Coloration of living specimens.— Adult; U.S.N.M. No. 37116; L. 
Stejneger No. 9057; Arecibo, April 3, 1900. -Ground color above of 
old skin (the specimen was shedding) "pea green," of new skm more 
olive green, the difference being slight, however; underside pale 
"pearl gray" with a decided wash of "turquoise blue" on the groin 
and tail; dark markings blackish; eyelids edged with whitish; iris 

very dark brown. ^ . 

A somewhat larger specimen {male), U.S.N.M. No. 27221; L. Stej- 
neger No. 9065; Utuado, April 7, 1900, had the ground color above 
tawny olive becoming olive gray on the tail; head not colored differ- 
ently from back; lower back with a broken network of black meshes; 
flanks with a series of vertical black spots on a slightly browner ground 
alternating with a double or triple series of pale dots, which continue 
indistinctly on hind legs and sides of tail; tip of snout and of lower 
jaw pink flesh color; sides of head pale drab; underside whitish with 
a bluish cast, which is strongest on the sides and under hind legs and 

tail. 

A specimen (young) (No. 27222; L. Stejneger No. 9066) from the 
same locality as the last had head and neck uniform tawny olive; 
ground coloV of back similar, but becoming duller toward the tail, 
which is dral) above; ground color of flanks similar, though more rus- 
set nearer the light lateral line, especially anteriorly; sides of head 
and neck nearly uniform pale cinnamon; a narrow pale cream-buff line 
from superciliaries slightly broadening on the back and fading out at 
about the posterior third of the back, margined with blackish on both

sides; on back and flanks a series of narrow blackish crossbars ])ecom- 
ing- obsolete on the lower back, the interspaces filled with roundish 
isaljclla-colored spots; lower back similarly spotted, as are also the 
upper side of the legs; tail above with these spots more faintly indi- 
cated; underside whitish with a turquoise-blue suffusion on both sides 
of a])domen and under the tail; underside of thighs pale gra}^ dappled 
with white round spots like those on the back. 

Variation. — In the large series of specimens before me (58) there is 
considerable variation in minor structural characters. Thus the num- 
ber of superciliaries varies between 6 and 8; the upper labials between 
5 and 8 (normally 6), lower labials between 5 and 6 (normally 6); the 
number of supraoculars is fairly constant at J^, sometimes one may be 
abnormally divided; in one instance the third supraocular is entirely 
seyjarated from the frontoparietal by granules; the occipitals are of 
very variable size and shape, the median, perhaps, more often smaller 
than the next pair than otherwise; the central group of enlarged 
throat scales, or gulars, is of very variable aspect. The ventrals are 
nearly always in 10 longitudinal rows, and the transverse rows vary 
from 31 to 39, averaging about 35. The number of anal plates is by 
no means limited to 3. Frequently there are 5, two narrower ones 
being added, one on each side, to the two posterior plates, or even 6 
when the anterior plate is divided by a transversal suture. Femoral 
pores, from 12 to 18 on each side; of sixt3^-seven specimens, three 
have 12; one, 13; eight, 11; twenty-five, 15; eighteen, 16; eight, 17, 
and four have 18, the average being 15.1 and the vast majority of 
specimens having 15 or 10 pores. 

The coloration is still more variable. Specimens with or without 
white dots, with or without stripes, are found in all localities. There 
are quite young specimens with comparatively few markings, but as a 
rule the spots and stripes l)ecome more and more obsolete with age. 
The pink color of the tip of the snout is also present in a varying 
degree, many having no trace of this tint. 

Habitat. — The ameiva, or, as this ground-lizard is generally though 
erroneoush^ called b}" the natives,.the iguana, is common all around 
the coast line of Porto liico in the neighborhood of water, salt or fresh, 
preferably where the ground is sandy or g'ravelly. In the interior it 
follows up the river courses, but it does not reach a high altitude. 
Thus, on the Rio Grande de Loiza the U. S. Fish Commission party 
found it as far up as Caguas, while on the Rio Grande de Arecibo we 
traced it to Utuado. 

This species is also common in Vieques, St. Thomas, and the other 
Virgin Islands. It is represented in Mona Island by a closely allied 
form.

618 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

AMEIVA ALBOGUTTATA" Boulenger. 

1896.^ — Ameiva alhogutlata Boulengek, Jahresber. Naturw. Yer. Magdeburg, 
1894-1896, p. 112 (type locality, Mona Island; types in Mus. Mag- 
deburg).— Meerwarth, Mittli. Naturh. Mus. Hamburg, XVIII, 1901, 
p. 32, pi. II, figs. 6-8 (Mona Island). 

This form is so much like Afneiva exul, from Porto Rico proper, 
that a detailed description is unnecessary. It will suffice to indicate 
in what respect the Mona Island specimens differ from the typical 
species. 

The main difference seems to be one of coloration. Judging" from 
the alcoholic sj)ecimens, the Mona form is considerably paler than 
those from Porto Rico proper. The white dots, as a rule, are more 
numerous and extend farther forward on the back to between the 
shoulders or slightly beyond, and it is probable that these spots do 
not disappear with age, at least to the same extent as in the old 
A. exiil. There are young specimens of the latter, however, which 
are fully as spotted as A. alhoguttata^ thus, for instance, Nos. 25665 and 
25667, from San Juan, Porto Rico. In the young A. alhoguttata 
there is also present a more or less continuous white line between 
axilla and groin, but this line disappears entirely in older specimens. 
It is only indicated in a few young A. exul. 

In spite of the great variation in the size of the scales on the tail it 
seems possible to establish an average difference between the two forms. 
In 31 specimens of A. exul in which the scales in the fifteenth tail seg- 
ment from the base were counted the number varied between 38 and 
54, considerably more than one-half having M to 48 scales, the average 
being 45.3. In the 7 specimens of ^4. alhoguttata at hand the scales in 
the fifteenth segment of the tail from its base numbered from 33 to 38, 
the average being 34.4. 

The gular scales are exceedingly variable. As in typical A. exul 
there is a median enlarged group, but it is not equally conspicuous in 
all specimens. Sometimes it is fairly well defined, as in No. 29368; in 
others the difference between these median scales and the adjacent 
ones on both sides is so slight that they seem to form a band of nearly 
equal scales across the throat, as in No. 29369; while in others again 
the decrease in size of the scales from the median ones is so gradual in 
all directions that no specially differentiated group can be made out. 
Whatever difference there is in the covering of the throat in the two 
forms seems due to the scales surrounding the median group being on 
the whole slightly larger in A. alhoguttata than in A. exul. The 
difference is one of slight degree, not of kind. 

It seems as if in A. exul the inner row of enlarged tibials averages 
somewhat larger. In some of the Mona specimens this row is very

(>J9 



slig-htl}^ differentiated at the lower end, but the difference l)ctween the 
two foi'ins is neither constant nor well marked, and is at l)est an 
average one. 

The same remark holds good with regard to the preanal plates. In 
all our specimens of ^i. aJhogidtata a smaller but well differentiated 
pUite is located on either side of the two posterior plates and a similar 
one in front of the anterior plate, but this arrangement is also frequent 
in A. edcnl., though not nearly universal. 

There is an average difference between the two forms in the width 
of the plates on the upper arm. In A. exnl they are considerably

wider as a rule, especially the upper ones, while in ^i. aJhoguttata they 
are usually comparatively narrower, with a tendency to decrease in 
size gradually at the upper end, but intermediate and identical speci- 
mens are not uncommon; thus in No. 29372, from Mona, and in 271-i6, 
from Arecibo, Porto Rico, the relative size of the plates as well as 
their relationship to the ones on the lower arm are exactly alike. 

As to any distinction derived from the entire separation of the plates 
on the upper arm from those on the lower arm, or their more or less 
apparent continuation, there is absolutely no difference in the two

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 



forms. The plates are definitely separated in the specimens from St. 
Thomas, Porto Rico, and Mona. 

Neither can I discover an}" difl'erence in the situation of the nostril 
with reference to the two nasal plates between which it is located. 

The difference in the number of femoral pores is a real one, altliouo^h 
it is only shown in the average and the figures intergrade considerably; 
in fact the range of individual variation in A. exul covers the extremes 
of A. alhoguUata. Thus in sixty-seven specimens of A. exul from 
Porto Rico and St. Thomas the number of femoral pores varies between 
12 and 18. Of these sixty-seven specimens, 61 per cent have 15 and 
16 pores, while 12 per cent have 11 and other 12 per cent have 17 
pores. In sixteen specimens of A. alhoguttata the number of pores 
varies ])etween 12 and 15. Of these sixteen specimens, more than 81 
per cent, have 12 and 11 pores. The exact averages are, for A. 
exul 15.1, and for A. alhogiMata 13.3. Curiously enough there seems 
to be an aversion for the numl^er 13, as only one specimen in sixty- 
seven of the former and one in sixteen of the latter have 13 pores. 
Although the series of A. cdhoguttata is comparatively insignificant, it 
seems safe to conclude that the great majority of this form have 12 
to 14 femoral pores, while most A. exul have 15 to 16. 

From the tables published hj Mr. Meerwarth,® one might be led to 
suppose that there is a fairly constant difference between the two 
forms, consisting in the greater number of labials in A. exxil., as the 
average number of supralabials is ^.'o and of infralabials 6.1 in the lat- 
ter against supralabials 6.0 and infralabials 5.1 in A. alhoguttata. This 
result, which is entirely at variance with what I have obtained, is 
probably due to his scantier material. At first I suspected that the 
discrepancy might l)e due to a real difference between the St. Thomas 
specimens and those from Mona, and that the Porto Rican specimens, 
of which he had none, might be intermediate. I consequently arranged 
my series from the three islands separately, with the following result:

It will be seen (1) that my Mona specimens agree with Meerwarth's 
from the same island; (2) that my St. Thomas and Porto Rican speci- 
mens average nearly the same, and (3) that they also average the same 
as the Mona Island specimens. It seems therefore pretty safe to con- 
clude that there is no difference in this respect between the two forms.

as A. exiil.

(Porto Rico).— Stahl, Fauna Puerto-Rico, 1882, p. 69 (Porto Rico). 

The type of Celestus jyleil collected by Plee and now in the Paris 
Museum is said to be from Martinique. Taking into consideration 
that it remains unique and that the genus is entirely foreign to the 
fauna of the Lesser Antilles, there can be no doubt that the locality is 
erroneous, like that of the majoi'ity of reptiles reported as having been 
collected in Martinique by Plee. 

The next question is to decide to which of the known species the 
name C. j)leil should be applied. Bocourt'^ has given a very fine figure 
of the unique type, which has every appearance of being accurate. It 
shows a Celestus very close to our Porto Rican specimens. Cope's C. 
degener. The only differences I can discover consist in the latter having 
the second upper labial higher and broadly in contact with the post- 
nasal and an apparently larger nostril. The postocular and temporal 
scales are also different, being of about equal size in the figure, while 
in our Porto Rican specimens the postorbital series consist of quite 
small scales followed by a series of three very large temporal plates. 
It is very doubtful whether any stress should be laid on these apparent 
differences, which, after all, may be due to inexactness of the drafts- 
man or engraver. The division of the prefrontal in the type of C.j^le'i 
as shown in Bocourt's figure is probably onl}^ an individual aberration, 
a similar case being also recorded in one of the Jamaican species. 

Knowing as we now do that Plee sent Porto Rican fishes to the Paris 
Museum, probably collected by himself on that island while en route 
to Martinique, we have ever}^ reason to believe that a number of his 
reptiles were obtained there also, the present species among them, and

in front and a straight border behind, the latter forming a suture with 
the entire anterior border of the frontal; frontal large, longer than 
the width between the supraoculars, but not as long as its extreme 
width at the posterior border, in contact with four supraoculars; no

Our largest specimen (No. 25528) is somewhat larger, measuring 
101 mm. from snout to vent, but the tail is broken. 

Variatlofi. — Our four specimens are essentially alike, and the species 
does not seem to be subject to great variation. In the type the pre- 
frontal seems to be divided, and in our number 25634 only three chin- 
shields are present on the right side. The number of scales round the 
body varies between 34 and 88, two having 36. A rather young indi- 
vidual (No. 25634) dift'ers chiefly in the head being proportionately 
larger, snout to ear measuring 8 mm. and snout to vent 40 mm. 

Hohitat. — So far as known this species is confined to Porto Rico 
proper, where it seems to be rare. The four specimens in our collec- 
tion are the onl}^ ones apparently of which the exact locality is known. 
They were all taken in the'cofi'ee belt. 

Hahits. — Nothing is known of its habits. The one I collected I 
picked up from under a flat stone. Its movements were slow, and 
when grabbed by the tail it wriggled itself loose from this member 
without much efl'ort.

The great facility witli which Diany species of this genus are able 
to change their colors has earned for them the name American Chame- 
leons, and the larger species are also usually known by the name 
"cameleon" in the Greater Antilles, the smaller ones being called 
"lagarto." The generic term Anolis, which is supposed to be of 
West Indian origin, might very appropriately be adopted also as the 
vernacular name. 

The faculty of changing color is quite astonishing in some of the 
species. Thus the brilliantly emerald green Anolis eve'n/iarml turns 
in an instant to a dingy wax-yellow with various dusky markings. 
Under certain conditions ^1. gundlacJii and A. cristatelhis may appear 
entirely sooty black, and while in affect A. krmji may lose its very 
conspicuous longitudinally otriped pattern and become a semitrans- 
lucent olive. The brilliant color of the gular sack, or dewlap, of the 
males does not seem to l)e subject to this changeabilit}^

626 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

The Porto Ricau species of AnoUs are easily identified when alive 
or recently killed, their colors being in most cases quite characteristic. 
Thus the large A. cuvieri is not only easily recognized by its size 
and the peculiar flat, bony surface of the head as well as the separa- 
tion of the dorsal scales by granules, but also by its more or less 
greenish coloration. 

A. evermanni is also green, but it is a small species and the terminal 
third of the tail is black. 

A. stratidus is more or less drab, brownish, or grayish, mostl}" with

dewlap, or pendant throat fan of the male, is deej) orange. 

A. cristatellus and A. gundlachi are also more or less brownish or 
grayish, though while alive many specimens, especially of the latter, 
are nearly black, but the dewlap is more or less tinged with olive or 
greenish in addition to the orange. A. gundlachi 
is, moreover, easily characterized by the metallic 
blue color of the "white" of its eyes, and by the 
oblique series of bead-like yellowish spots on the 
flanks. 

The three species A. pidchellus, hrugi^ ^w^jpon- 
censis form a small group bj^ themselves, charac- 
terized by the coloration, which is disposed in 
longitudinal stripes. Of these A. jponcensis is at

With female specimens, as well as those preserved in alcohol, 
recourse must be had to the structural characters as contrasted in the 
"key." It is not always, however, that a single character is sufficient. 
Sometimes a criterion based on the presence or absence of a scale fails, 
mostly only on one side of the specimen, so that it is always advisable 
to examine both sides. Moreover, a specimen should alwaj^s be com- 
pared with the detailed description to see if it agrees in the majority 
of characters.

The early technical history of this species is somewhat obscure. 
Cuvier briefly mentioned it under a French name in the tirst edition 
of his Reg-ne Animal (1817), saying- that it is from 'Mamaica, and prob- 
ably the other Antilles." A somewhat crude figure is added, and from 
the statement that he had "found berries in its stomach" it is plain 

«To the great French zoologist G. Cuvier, because of his having indicated the 
species in the first edition of Regne Animal, 1817.

that he had a specimen. On these meager data Merrem established 
the S3^stematic name AnoUs euvierl^ but Cuvier himself subsequently, 
in the second edition of his famous work, repudiated this name, sub- 
stituting- that of AnoUus vellfer. He added nothing- to the original 
account, onl)^ eliminated the word '^ probahhf^ in front of "the other 
Antilles," and reproduced the old tig-ure. The following year, how- 
ever, Guerin published another tig-ure, without a description, under 
the latter name. Seven years later Dumeril and Bibron give a very 
elaborate description, under the name of Anolis vellfer^ of the only 
specimen in the museum at Paris, the origin of which they were 
ignorant of, but suspected to be from the Antilles. No mention is 
made of it being the type of the species, or of Jamaica lieing its hab-

itat, as alleged by Cuvier, Neither is there any mention in Dumeril's 
Catalogue (1851) of the reptiles in the Paris museum of this specimen 
being Cuvier's type, notwithstanding the statement on page ii of the 
introduction that " all these t3"pes [those of Cuvier and others], so 
precious to the naturalist, who should always take them as standards 
of comparison, have consequent!}^ been exactly recorded in all cases 
in which the}^ have been found.'" Nevertheless, the proba])ilitv is that 
they had before them Cuvier's original specimen. 

We next hear of the species in 1861, when Cope reported the habitat 
to be Vieques, and in 1863, when Reinhardt and Luetken identified 
specimens from Vieques and Tortola with Dumeril and Bibron's descrip- 
tion. Afterwards specimens from Porto Rico were similarly identified

by Cope, Peters, and Garman. When Boulenger Ynil)lishe(l tlu^ stM-ond 
volume of his catalogue of lizards the British Museum did not possess 
any specimens of this species, and his description is apparently only a 
condensation of that of Dumeril and Bibron. It is consequently to be 
noted that no direct comparison of Porto Rican specimens has hitherto 
been made with the type specimen without locality in Paris. 

Detailed as Dumeril and Bibron\s description is, it is not sufficiently 
so for proving whether their specimen really is the Porto Rican form 
and not the same as A. rlcordU, from Santo Domingo. So much is 
certain, that the characters which they rely upon for distinguishing 
the two species do not hold in any one particular. As a matter of 
fact, the two descriptions both fit Santo Domingo specimens, some 
agreeing with that of A. velifer, some with xL ricordlL It may even 
be stated that the character assigned to the forhier as pni-ticularly dis-

tinctive, namely, the greater flatness of the scales on top of the snout, 
is more characteristic of the Santo Domingo specimens than those 
from Porto Rico. Another distinction derived from the descriptions 
of Dumeril and of Boulenger (namely, the scaling of the gular pouch, 
that of A. ricordii being entirely covered with granules, while that of 
A. mlifer {—cuvieri) is said to be " nearly naked, with only a few lines 
of small ovalo-rhomboid, feebly keeled scales on each side " does not 
hold either, as it is only a sexual difierence, the former being that of 
the female, the latter that of the male. Nevertheless, the two species 
differ quite sufficiently to establish their claims to separate specific 
recognition. 

The differences between A. cuvieri, from Porto Rico, and A. ricordi% 
from Santo Domingo, though slight, are both constant and easily 
applied. The scales on top of the head seena to be smaller in the for-

mer. Thus, whenever the indiAidual scales can be made out, I find a 
series of scales between the two rows which form the frontal ridges, 
while in A. ricordii the scales of the two ridges join along their whole 
length. In the former the scales which surround the occipital cavity 

on the sides and behind are flatter, 
more polygonal, and distinctly keeled, 
while in A. rieordll I find them to be 
undift'erentiated, rounded, and tuber- 
cular, like the others. In A. cuvieri 
the scales covering the loreal triangle 
are somewhat larger, especially the 
lower row, and all the scales on the 
sides of the head are rougher, while in 
A. ricordii they are fairly smooth. The 
scales on the sides of the tail are smaller 
in A. ricordii than m A. cuvieri. At the level of the fifth "ray" 
there are about lO-l-I longitudinal rows and 3—1 vertical rows between 
the rays, while in A. ricordii we find about 16-20 longitudinal rows 
and 5-6 vertical rows ])etween the rays. In the latter the scales are 
also more regularly squarish, forming more regular vertical rows. 
There may be other minor differences, but the above appear sufficient 
for distinguishing the two species with comparative ease. 

Any possible uncertainty as to 
the exact applicability of the name 
A. cuvieri to the Porto Rican spe- 
cies is now set at rest, thanks to the 
kindness of Prof. Leon Vaillant 
and his assistant. Dr. Mocquard, at 
the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle 
in Paris. In order to satisfy ni}^- 
self on this question, I sent them 
copies of figs. 87 and 88, repre- 
senting the pholidosis of the tail 
of both species. After a careful 
comparison with the tj^pes. Dr. 
Mocquard wrote, under date of 
February 21, 1901: 

The type specimen oi Anol'is velifer Cuv. {^=An. curleri Merrem) agrees exactly 
in the pholidosis of the tail with the drawing of No. 26843 [fig. 87]. Between the 
fourth and fifth or fifth and sixth spines of the caudal crest the scales form three or 
four vertical rows and two longitudinal rows. On the lateral aspect of the tail, as 
also indicated on the drawing, they are disposed in verticils, in each of which there 
may be counted ten more or less irregular longitudinal rows of scales. The vertical 
rows do not appear quite as regular as the longitudinal series. On the other hand, 
the drawing of No. 12108 [fig. 88J corresponds to the pholidosis of the tail of Anoiis 
ricordii D. B. (Erpet. gen., t. iv, p. 167).

Description. — Adult male. Mu.s. Comp. Zool. Cambr., Ma.s.s., No. 
6167; Porto Rico; Dr. Stahl, collector. Top of head flat, with only 
shallow depressions on prefrontal and occipital region, the scales 
being rather small and roughly keeled and tuberculated, even those on 
top of the snout, but especially those of the supraorbital semicircle 
and frontal ridges; about nine enlarged supraoculai's, flat, keeled, and 
in contact with the semicirculars; supraorbital semicircles separated 
by about three scale rows from each other and from the occipital, 
which is barel}" noticeable; scales surrounding the occipital depression 
on the sides and behind rather large, flat, polygonous, each with a strong- 
keel; six loreal rows, the scales composing the lower row next to the 
supralabials largest; one row of large keeled suboculars; 7-8 supra- 
labials to under the center of the eye; temporals flat, with a low 
tubercle, all the scales of the sides of the head being more or less 
rugose or wrinkled; ear-opening rather small, upright, oval; back and 
sides covered with uniform scales tuberculated or keeled, separated 
from each other by one or more rings of minute granules; on the 
median line of the neck and back a series of about fifty triangular 
spines forming a saw-tooth ridge scarcely connected with the caudal 
crest; ventral scales about same size as dorsals, though more closely set, 
but not keeled or distinct!}' tuberculated except on the flanks; scales 
on chin and throat more elongate, distinctl}'^ keeled or tuberculated; 
scales on upper side of fore limbs larger than dorsals, juxtaposed or

The adult female differs chiefly in having- no lin to the tail, a smaller 
dewlap with the scales set more closely and uniformly, and in lacking 
the enlarged postanal plates. The upper edge of the tail is even, the 
ridge on the posterior two-thirds consisting of a series of rather flat 
more or less regularly hexagonal scales of nearly equal size sur- 
mounted by a keel, but slightly higher than those on the lateral scales. 

It is a curious fact that the young of this species is unknown. 
Moreover, nobody seems to have described the young of the corre- 
sponding species, equall}" large and peculiar Anolis, which inhabits 
the islands of Haiti, Cuba, and Jamaica. As we know the adults of 
the other species, it is not possible that any of these can ])e the young 
of these giants, nor do any of them present structural characters which 
would strengthen a suspicion in this direction. The large species 
do not seeui to be common on any of the islands, but that fact hardly 
explains why no young ones or even half-grown specimens have thus 
far been observed. 

Colors of living animal.— AAwM male; U.S.N.M. No. 26843; L. 
Stejneger, No. 9021; Catalina plantation, about 890 feet altitude; Feb- 
ruar}^ 21, 1900. Iris hazel, with a ])right brassy ring bordering the 
pupil; general color above greenish gray; back clouded with brown- 
ish and sides with blackish dots, the dusky of the back and the black 
spots on the sides arranged in four perceptible, though indistinct, 
cross-bands; eyelids blackish, with a citron-yellowish spot above and 
behind the ej-e and a smaller one in front; under the e3"e a long semi- 
lunar white spot barely invading the posterior supralabials; several 
whitish spots on temples and sides of neck; underside white with dark- 
gray mottlings and spots; dewlap delicately Naples-yellow, scales on 
the edge white; legs indistinctly crossbarred with dusky Imnds more 
or less spotted with blackish. Tongue pale cadmium orange, whole 
interior of mouth of same color, but duller. 

During my absence three specimens, all males, were brought alive 
to Dr. Richmond while in Luquillo, two of which (Nos. 26999 and 
27000) were colored like the above, while the third (No. 27001) was 
uniform emerald green when alive. In alcohol it is colored like the 
others. 

Habitat. — This giant Anolis seems to })e confined to Porto Rico, 
Vieques, and Tortola, but is absent on St. Thomas and probably also on 
St. John. In Haiti it is replaced b}^ a nearly allied species, A. r'lcordli. 

In Porto Rico it occurs at least as high up as 900 feet above the sea. 
It is rather rare, since none of the Fish Commission parties obtained 
it. This scarcit}^ can hardl}^ be attributed to the mongoose, as it seems 
to live in tall trees rather than on the ground. As already stated, 
young and half-grown specimens are as yet unknown. Besides the 
specimens from the localities mentioned in the list below I have exam- 
ined two specimens in the Hamburg museum, collected by Mr. J. 
Michaelis at Arecibo in 1900.

It will be noticed that the animal described and figured l)y me differs 
greatly from Peters's original description of Anolis gundlachi The 
discrepancies are so many and so great that at first J felt quite con- 
fident of having a new species. My doubts were dispelled, however, 
when I took my specimens over to Berlin and compared them directly 
with Peters's types, with which they are identical. 

The present species in many respects resembles A. cristatellus^ 
which also has a caudal fin and a brownish ground color. It is easily 
told apart, however, by the more numerous scale rows between the 
supraorliital semicircles and between the latter and the occii)ital.

T\\e female difl'ers chiefl}^ in the absence of dewlap, tin to the tail, 
and postanal plates. The tail is nearly eydindric, the median series of 
scales above being only slig-htly enlarged and forming a scarcely 
appreciable serration. The full-grown female appears to be consid- 
erabl}^ smaller than the male, one (No. 27270) distended with large eggs 
measuring only 42 mm. from snout to vent. One of the eggs meas- 
ures 11 by 5 mm. 

Variation. — The greatest variation is found in the size of the occip- 
ital and the scales which separate the latter from the supraocular 
semicircle, the number of rows sometimes being as low as five. These 
scales are alwa3^s small, almost granular, and their increased number 
appears to be at the expense of the occipital, which is sometimes quite 
small and difficult to distinguish. In exceptional cases the median 
row of small scales between the larger ones separating the supraocular 
semirings is absent, in which case there are only two rows. The 
number of polygonal scales composing the supraocular disk is also 
very variable, there being often as many as 17 or 18. In some speci- 
mens, especially younger ones, the ventrals are less sharply keeled 
than in others.

slio"htly browner in the basal half or a little l)e3^ond the compressed 
elevated portion, followed l)y a median uniform blackish portion and 
a terminal part which is uniform pale brownish olive; feet nearl}-^ uni- 
form dusk}-; dewlap very large, with thickened edg-e, the color of the 
skin being a dull orange-olive, the distant scales straw yellow; iris 
blackish brown; tongue plumbeous. 

No. 26900, adult male, same locality, February 26, ver}^ similar, 
but the crossbars less well delincd on the flanks. 

Another adult male (No. 26901), same locality and date, on the other 
hand, was more deeply colored, the oblique strings of yellowish beads 
across the velvety black sides ])eing very conspicuous. Eye deep 
indigo hhie. 

No. 26902, also an adtdt niale caught at the same place and time, 
was nearly uniform olive brown when captured, but the pattern came 
out gradually and the body color became lighter while being held 
alive in the hand; feet above black; chin back to the beginning of the 
dewlap bright orange yellow, the dark marblings on the yellow being 
Indian red. A pretty high cervi co-nuchal fold of rounded outline. 

A young specimen. No. 26904, same locality and date as No. 26903, 
resembled the latter closely, though lateral crossbars and oblique 
bands of yellow spots were obsolete; a pale vertebral band extends 
from occiput to some distance on the tail, the black dorsal crossbars 
being hourglass shaped; dewlap present, but small. 

Another young specimen (No. 26905) was uniformly velvety blackish 
brown above. 

Numerous specimens collected at Adjuntas (l,-i50 feet altitude) during 
the second week of April agree in color with those from El Yunque, 
including the yellow chin, though they did not seem to be as dark 
and velvety, the greater richness of the color in the latter locality 
being probably due to the greater humidity. The narrow bands of 
pale bead-like spots on the flanks, the yellow spot on the chin, and the 
dark metallic blue of the "white" of the eyes may be regarded as 
absoluteh" characteristic of this species. 

Ilahitat. — This species seems to be confined to the coffee belt and 
the high mountain tops above it. In the western portion of the 
island it probably goes farther down than at the eastern end, where 
we found none at the Catalina coffee plantation, about 900 feet alti- 
tude, though it is to be noted that the United States Fish Commission 
party obtained a single specimen (No. 25723) on the slope of El 
Yunque, somewhere between 600 and 900 feet above the sea. At 
Utuado, in the west, it occurs, though apparently rare and not at the 
level of the town. There is no record of the exact altitude at which 
the types were collected, and the single specimen obtained by me dur- 
ing a diligent search for nearly a week (No. 27180) was taken in a side 
valley at least lOO feet higher than the town, consequently over 500 
feet above sea level. At Adjuntas it was common in the coffee planta-

tions, and near the top of El Yunque Mountain it was almost equally 
common in the orig'inal forest.

mail}' times laroer than the largest dorsal g-ranules; supraorbital disk 
consisting of al)()at ten enlarged, polygonal keeled scales surrounded 
by several rows of granules; two small and one large scale between 
the superciliaries and the supraocular semicircle bordering the supra- 
ocular granules anteriorly; canthus rostral is sharp, consisting of five 
elongated shields, the second one from the superciliar\^ ridge being 
particularly large; superciliary ridge consists of one ^'er3' long and 
narrow anterior shield followed by a double series of smaller scales 
which separates the supraocular granules above from those covering the 
lateral orbital region; loreal rows six, with raised low^er edges; subocu- 
lar semicircle keeled, separated f rom supralabials by one row of scales; 
supralabials nine, the suture between seventh and eighth being under 
the center of the eye; temporals granular, with a bare indication of an 
enlarged supratemporal line; dorsals minutely granular, the granules 
being pointed or keeled, with a bare indication of a median double 
series of slightl}^ larger ones; ventral scales large, imbricate, rounded 
behind and flat or slightly convex, those on the throat smaller, more 
elongate and more strongly convex; fore legs above with sharply 
keeled scales, those on the u])per arm smaller, those on the lower arm 
larger than the ventrals; anterior face of femur and underside of 
tibia similarly covered, the scales on the former gradually decreasing 
on the underside, the upper side of both being covered with granules 
like those on the l)ack; scales on fingers and toes sharply carinate; 
digital expansion wide, about 20 lamelh\? under phalanges ii and iii of 
fourth toe; tail moderate, compressed, the l)asal half above with a fin 
supported by about 14 l>ony rays; caudal verticels distinctly indicated 
by a vertical series of more enlarged scales, those between being 
pointed and smaller, in about nine vertical, somewhat irregular 
series, all imbricate and keeled; the scales covering the upper edge of 
the tail raised and spinous, forming a serrated ridge the teeth of which 
increase in length tow^ard the posterior end of each verticel, about six 
spines corresponding to each verticel in the basal portion; dewlap 
large, with distant series of scales, the anterior edge thickened; post- 
anal scales slightly developed. 

The dermal folds on upper neck and back are present, the former 
quite prominent, the latter perhaps less so than in Anolis gundlachi.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 



^\\Q female and young differ chiefly in the absence of dewlap and Ihi 
to the tail, the female also by entire absence of postanal plates. 

Yariation. — The greatest variation is found in the head scales, the 
most important being in the relation of the supraorbital semicircles to 
each other and to the occipital plate. In the majority of cases the 
semicircles are broadly in contact across the interorbital space, but a 
small scale is often developed at the intersection of the sutures in this 
region, and it is very rare that not at least one pair of semicirculars 
touch. The number of scale rows separating the occipital varies 
between 2 and 4, the latter number but rarely, however. The 
enlargement of the two median rows of scales or granules on the back 
is variable, forming an appreciably raised line in many individuals, 
but almost absent in others. The height of the caudal fin is also 
somewhat variable, as it is not always the highest in the largest males,

but I believe it to be present in all full-grown males and do not at all 
understand the remark by Reinhardt and Luetken to the effect that the 
caudal crest is absent in specimens from Porto Rico and Vieques. In 
some specimens the ventral scales are more or less distinctly keeled. 

One of the individuals, a half grown male (No. 25Y7T), from the island 
of Culebra, collected by the Fishhauik party, differs at first sight so 
much from the other specimens of the same locality collected by Mr. 
Baker that at one time I believed it to belong to a different species. 
The scales separating the occipital a,nd supraocular semicircles, as well 
as the enlarged scales forming the supraocular disk, are rather numer- 
ous, but these peculiarities are matched by various Porto Rican species, 
and a careful comparison of other points fail to discover any tangible 
differences. It is very light colored, with scarcely any dark mark- 



HERPETOLOGY OF PORTO RICO. (Ul 

ing.s, Init with a pale baud along the middle of the })ack. It is lig-ured 
(figs. 1)5-97). 

Colors of Thing animal.— Adxit male, U.S.N.M. No. 2(hS03 (L. S. 
No. 9011); Pueblo Viejo, near San Juan, February 14, 1901. Iris 
dark brown; edge of eyelids light yellowish: general color al)oye 
bronzy greenish gray; head and seyeral faint longitudinal in-egular 
spots on the sides of the back more bi'ownish; on each side of the 
median dorsal line between the insertion of the hind legs a better 
deiiuiHl and larger spot of irregular outline, pale brownish edged with 
brownish l)lack and a light line outside the dark margin: on the middle 
line of the tail a series of dusky spots located at the liase of the largest 
spines; throat whitish; rest of underside sutfused with greenish yel- 
low, most intensely in the preanal region; dewlap greenish yellow 
verging into l)ro\vnish orange toward the edge. 

A youiKjrr inah' (No. 208O5, same locality and date) was similai- })ut 
darker, and with no definite markings of brown; tail cross -l)anded, 
light and dusky; dewlap fairly well developed. 

An advJt female (No. 2(3801:, same locality and date) resem])led the 
male, only browner, especially the supraorl)ital disk, which was almost 
ferruginous; median dorsal line paler grayish with a dusk}- shade on 
each side; throat whitish with gray marl)lings; abdomen greenish 
yellow; no dewlap. 

The coloration of the liying specimens not only varies greatly indi- 
vidually, 1)ut to some extent also locally. Thus, as a rule, the speci- 
mens which we saw in Utuado were much more distinctly marked, 
the dark dorsal cross bands standing out in much greater contrast than 
in other localities. On the other hand, those collected in the white 
limestone hills east of Ponce were nearly uniformly dral) without 
distinct markings. The specimens obtained in Vieques had the dewlap 
more brightly colored, thus in No. 27o6S (L. 8. No. 9053) it was green 
very l)roadly margined with brownish orange in strong contrast. 

Ilahitat. — Aiaillx eristatella-s occurs not only in Porto Rico, Culel)ra, 
and Vieques, but also on all the Virgin Islands, specimens having been 
recorded by lieinhardt and Liu'tken from St. Thomas, St. flohn. Just 
van D3^ck, Water Island, and St. Croix. On Mona it is represented by 
a nearly allied form. 

In Porto Rico it is proba)>ly the commonest species, being found 
everywhere in the lowlands and in certain localities at least as high up 
on the mountain sides as 1,4:1:0 feet. The highest point where I met 
with this species was at Adjuntas, in which localit}", however, AnoUs 
gundlacid was the commoner species. The few specimens of A. eris- 
tateUxts seen there were found on rocks near the river and in the tow^n 
itself, but not in the woods and coffee plantations.

ANOLIS MONENSIS," new species. 

Dhiffvokh. — Dorsal .scales small, juxtaposed, convex, gradually 
diminishing' from the median line, becoming granular before reaching 
the sides; tail strongl}' compressed, in the adidt male with a very high 
tin-like crest supported 1»y rays, much less than twice the length of 
head and body; ventrals iml)ricate, smooth; occipital large, larger 
than ear opening, separated from the supraorljital semicircle by one 
row (exceptionalh", two rows) of tlat scales; semicirculars broadl}- in 
contact; tibia much shorter than head from tip of snout to ear-open- 
ing; two shields between supraocular semicircle and superciliaries 
l)ordering the supraocular granules anteriorly; anterior femoral scales 
keeled; color very pale gray, with a dusky, transocular line.

Ilahttat. — Mona Island. 

A)i<)lls iiionenxis is closely related to ^i. ertstnteUits^ and is possibly 
directly descended from the latter. The scales are larger throughout, 
hence the fewer rows on the loreal triangle, the single row betwe(^n 
occipital and supraorbital semicircle, the greater size of the dorsal 
scales or tubercles, etc. The caudal tin is excessively high, more so 
than in any A. cristatellus^ or even ^4. gimdlacJi!^ examined by me. 
The coloration is also peculiar, being of a very pale gray, with a dis- 
tinct transocular, dusky line. In many specimens there is a distinct 
white line from shoulder to groin. The color of the dewlap can notlu^ 
made out in the alcoholic specimens, but there are indications that it 
is ditferent from that of A. oriMatellus.

ANOLIS EVERMANNI," new species. 

Dia(j)ios/H. — Dorsal scales granular or tii])erc'ulated, juxtaposed, 
slightly larger than the laterals, the median series not diti'erentiated 
from the others, all much smaller than ventrals; tail slightly com- 
pressed, with an upper median series of enlarged keeled scales form- 
ing a serrated edge; digital expansion strongly developed; occipital 
shield nearly as large as the ear opening, separated from supraorfjital 
semicircle 1>3' two or three scale rows; semicirculars in contact or sep- 
arated by one row of scales; tibia less than length of head from tip of

of granules; one large shield in front of the supraocular granules 
between the superciliaries and the supraocular semicircle; canthus 
rostralis sharp, consisting of five elongated shields increasing gradu- 
ally in size posteriori}^, superciliary ridge consisting of one narrow 
elongated shield and one similar but very small one, but not followed 
by a differentiated series of small scales, the granules of the supra- 
ocular disk continuing uninterruptedly into the granules surrounding 
the eye; loreal rows five or six; subocular semicircle keeled, broadly 
in contact with the supralal>ials ; supralabials nine, the suture between 
seventh and eighth being under the center of the eye; temporal gran- 
ules about the size of dorsals, a well-marked double series of small scales 
forming the supratemporal line; dorsals coarse, keeled granules, with- 
out any median enlarged series, laterals smaller but similar; ventral 
scales rather small, slightly imbricate, rounded behind, flat, those on 
the throat granular; fore legs above with small keeled scales, about three

series on the anterior face of the lower arm being greatly enlarged, 
more than twice as large as the vcntrals; anterior scales of femur 
enlarged, keeled, gradually diminishing posteriori}^ and below; scales 
covering hands and feet above multicarinate; digital expansion wide, 
al)out twenty-eight lamell;\? under phalanges ii and iii of fourth toe; 
tail moderate, slightly compressed, with fairly well-marked verticils, 
every eighth or ninth vertical row being somewhat enlarged and sur- 
mounted by a strongly serrated edge of enlarged triangular spines, 
the fourth or fifth corresponding to the enlarged vertical scale row 
being larger than the others; dewlap naked, with distant series of 
scales, edge not thickened; postanal scales slightly developed. 

The dermal folds on upper neck and back are very low, especially 
the latter, but there is a distinct depression between them on the 
shoulder region.

Female and yonng differ in the absence of dewlap and eervico-dor.sal 
folds, the former also of postanal plates; the tail is more cjdindrie and 
the spinous upper edge less ])ronounced. 

YaTiation. — As usual g-reiit variation is found in the size and conse- 
quent number of the head scales. The supraorbital semicircles may 
be in contact, though I have never seen more than one shield on each 
side meeting, but just as often they are separated entirely by a single 
series of scales. The supraorbitals again are separated from the 
occipital usually l»y three, often by two, but very i-arely by four 
scales. The loreal rows are mostly live, often four, more rarely six. 
There are usually six supralabials anterior to the center of the eye, 
sometimes only live, occasionally seven. The keeling and wrinkling 
of the upper head shields and scales are also subject to consideral)le 
variation, being usually less pronounced in youth. 

Citlors of living mvinial.—AdnU imiJe, U.8.N.M. No. 2686(3 (L. S. 
No. 9026). Catalina plantation, a])Out 890 feet altitude; Fet)ruary 22, 
1900. Iris, dark brown; eyelids, abruptly flesh-colored; general color, 
bright emerald green without markings; a))domen, underside of hind 
legs, and thick l)asal portion of tail below, pale glaucous green; ter- 
minal third of tail, black, tip, pale; dewlap, gamboge yellow; scales, 
pale yellow, no thickened edge. 

When handled the animal changed from green to wax-yellow with 
numerous dusky spots and marblings on body and crossbars on tail, 
as well as longitudinal dusky stripes on throat; when reassuming its 
normal color the dusky markings disappeared before it turned green. 

Another specimen (No. 26855, L. S. No. 9022), from same locality, I 
descril)ed as follows: General color, changing from bright parrot- 
green to almost dusky olive yellow, with faint indications of l)rownish, 
dusky mar))lings on back; terminal third of tail, blackish, extreme 
end pale; belly, underside of thighs, and thii'k ])art of tail, verging 
on pale glaucous green; throat and dewlap, wax-yellow; pinkish 
edges to the eyelids; iris, very dark brown with a dark steel-blue 
ring; inside of mouth, pale yellowish. 

An adnlt female (No. 26867), same locality, is described in the note- 
book as like No. 26866, but with a very small dewlap not differentiated 
as to color. No soft cervico-nuehal or dorsal crests. The male has a

veiy low, curved nuchal flap and a still lower dorsal fold, with a distinct 
depression between them at the shoulders. 

The young, as observed near Utuado, are pea-g-reen with brownish 
spots arrano-ed longitudinally with a pale stripe on flank from shoulder 
to groin, and one down the middle of the back, the latter interrupted 
b}^ spots of dark brown; underside, whitish. When caught the}^ 
change immediately to a more or less uniform brown. 

Ilahltat. — Like Anolis giindlachl, the present species is peculiar to 
Porto Rico and has almost the identical vertical distribution. In the 
eastern part of the island we found it on the slopes of El Yunque from 
about 800 feet up nearly to the top, while in the west we traced it 
from above Utuado to Adjuntas. Near Utuado I saw it only in a deep 
wooded ravine facing north, in which the animals of the higher regions 
prol)ably descend farther down than in the surrounding country and 
still more so than on the south slope of the mountain chain. Gener- 
ally speaking, Aaoll^ <nvrmanni is confined to the coffee belt.

the semicircle by one row of smaller scales or granules; one large 
shield in front of the supraocular granules between the superciliaries 
and the supraocular semicircle; canthus rostralis consisting of live 
elongated scales gradually increasing in size posteriorly, the last two

Variation. — The variation in the head seutellation is as great as in 
the allied species. Thus, while in the specimen described the supra- 
orbital semicircles are completely separated by a row of scales, in many 
others they are in contact, in some cases e^'en extensively so, as, for 
instance, in No. 25532, in which two pairs of the semicircle scales are 
broadl}^ in contact. In the large series before me they are separated 
in about one-half the specimens. In none is there more than one scale 
row between the semicircles. The single large shied d separating the 
supraocular semicircle from the superciliary ridge just in front of the 
supraocular granules is remarkably constant, it being di\'ided in two 
specimens only, namely, Nos. 26849 and 20990, and in these only on 
one side. 

The keels on the scales covering the arms are often so feeble as to 
appear entirel}' al)sent. 

Colors of IJvlug animal. — Adult male. U.S.N.M. No. 2(;soT (L. 
Stejneger No. 9007). Pueblo Viejo, near San Juan, February 18, 
1900. Iris dark brown; general color above light yellowish gray, 
much lighter l)elow; the saddle-shai)ed spots on ])ack very pronounced 
blackish ]>ro\vn l)ordered by whitish; on sides an irregular series of 
burnt- uml)er brown spots, also with white margins; throat and adja- 
cent portions of underside of neck of a delicate pale l)luish green; 
skin of the dewlap deep orange, the distant scales canary yellow, those 
on anterior edge moi'e whitish. 

Another male (No. 2r)S(;5. L. S. No. !»02T, Catalina plantation, Feb- 
ruary 22, 1900). — General color a])ove grayish drab, the saddle spots 
blackish brown, and indetinite blotches and spots on sides cinnamon; 
edge of eyelids pale yellowish; a pale semilunar stripe on keels of 
sul)oculars; dewlap orange, the thickened edge pale greenish white; 
otherwise as No. 26S07. 

Habitat. — The saddle-spotted anolis is not exclusively Porto Rican 
inasmuch as it is also an inhalutant of the Virgin Islands, specimens 
being known from St. Thomas, Tortola, Just v. Dy ck, and Vieques.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1!)02. 



It is also reported from Haiti ))y Prof. S. Garman, who mentions 
specimens in tlie Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, as hav- 
ing been collected by Professor Ackermann at Port an Prince. It is 
highly desirable, however, that the accuracy" of the latter locality 
should be confirmed as no other collector seems to have obtained this 
species in Haiti or Santo Domingo. 

In Porto Rico this species is most commonly found near sea level 
and in the lower altitudes. We found it still numerous, however, at 
nearly t»()0 feet, and a few specimens were collected by us at Adjuntas 
and 1)\' the I'lsh Ilawl' parties and Mr. Baker at tlie same place and at 
Cayey, but it was not found in the higher regions of El Yunque. On 
the whole its distrilnition seems to coincide with that of Anolls 
cristdtelliis!. 

It is also connnon both on Vieques and on Culeljra islands.

Tlie present species, together witli A. j>vlc'/tellu.s and A. iioncensk, 
form a very natural group of Anoles characterized by their slender 
form, the h)ngitudinall y striped coh)ration, the strongly cai'inated scales 
in ridges on the underside, and the excessively long tail, which in 
uninjured specimens is much longci- than twice the length of head and 
body. This character would have been an excellent one to separate 
this group from all the other Anoles in Porto Rico were it not that 
occasionally an old ^1. gutidlacJu is found in which the length of the 
tail also is more than twice the head and l)ody.

smaller than these, the rest of the back and the sides covered b}- 
minute granules; ventral scales large, imbricate, strongly kindled, the 
keels forming continuous ridges, those on throat much smaller and 
narrower, also keeled; legs covered by keeled scales, those on upper 
surface of arms and on anterior aspect of femur larger, equaling or

long, more than twice the length of head and body, moderately com- 
pressed and covered b}^ large, subequal, keeled scales, with scarcely 
any indication of verticils, and the median series al)ove forming a but 
slightly enlarged and feebly serrated edge; dewlaj) naked with distant

The females have merely an indication ot a dewlap and a nuchal 
fold; they also lack postanal plates. The ijoiiixj are devoid of the 
dermal folds. 

Yariatwn. — There is a variation in the scutellation similar to that in all 
the other species, though perhaps of less importance in this species, as 
its differences from the nearest allies are to be found more pronounced 
in other features. Thus there is one single row separating the supra- 
ocular semicircles as often as two, and there is considerable variation 
in the number of rows on the loreal triangle (five to seven), of supra-

labials, etc. The number of rows of clearly differentiated imbricate 
keeled scales on the back is also variable to some extent, but they; 
always form a narrow zone along- the median line of the back. 

Colors of living animal.— Adult male, Cat. No. 26874 (L. S. No. 
9028), Catalina Plantation, El Yunque, 890 feet altitude, February 21, 
1900. General color bright yellowish olive-green, sides of back and 
flanks with minute black spots, larger on back, but none along the 
median area occupied l)y the enlarged scales; from under eye through 
ear to groin a l)road and very distinct line of canary yellow, l)rightest, 
nearly lemon j^ellow, on middle of flanks; a black spot immediately 
behind eye, but no postocular band; underside paler, more buffy; 
immediately below the lateral yellow band the color is more olive, 
with minute black specks; hind legs posteriorly suffused with ferru- 
ginous; tail crossbarred with dusky; dewlap yellowish, gradually 
deepening to orange toward the edge; eye dark brown, nearly black, 
with a faint silvery edge to the iris; eyelids edged with whitish. 

Another adtiU male (No. 26876, L. S. No. 9030), caught the follow- 
ing day on the same plantation, was in every respect similar to the 
above, but in addition the temples and the dorsal surface of the neck 
were densely speckled with 1)luish white dots, the equivalent of the 
black dots on the back. 

The female, No. 26875, U.S.N.M. (L. S. No. 9029), same locality 
and datCy was above dark olive-brown, paler on sides below lateral 
line; the latter straw-yellow, beginning on supralabials below nostril 
through ear to groin; color of sides gradually fading into pale y^el- 
lowish on belly; edge of eyelids whitish. Scarcely anv indication of 
a nuchal fold or a dewlap. 

The specimens (6) which I collected at Utuado (altitude about 500 feet) 
on April 6 had the lateral stripe pure white and not yellow. The live 
colors of one were noted on the spot as follows: 

No. 27157, U.S.N.M. (L. S. No. 9063). Head and a broad stripe 
down the middle of the back, olive-brown; sides of back abruptly 
much darker, nearl}' blackish, bordered below by a pure white band 
extending from snout over labials through ear to groin; below this 
olive-brown dusted over with black; underside whitish; behind eye- 
opening a conspicuous black spot; dewlap orange with white scales. 

After death the dorsolateral dark band fades and is replaced ])y num- 
erous minute black dots, while the neck above is dusted over w^ith 
minute bluish white dots. In the large specimens the outline of the 
median dorsal band in life is straight, while in the young ones caught 
to-day [April 6] it is strongl}^ scalloped. In all six the lateral stripe 
impure white, even in one which was just shedding, and extends to the 
groin. All the individuals seen were colored like these. 

At Adjuntas (altitude about 1,400 feet) the specimens collected and 
observed on April 13 had the lateral stripe, which was distinctly

defined all the wa}' to the groin, of the same vivid yellow color as 
those observed on the Catalina Plantation, but one individual with 
3'ellow stripe which was kept alive over nig-ht had the stripe white on 
the next morning. 

Hahitaf. — Thus far AnoJix l-rnyi is only known from Porto Kico. 
It reseml>lcs A.jnde/tcIIif.^ so closely, however, that it would not be 
surprising if it should be found to have been confused with the latter 
in the higher altitudes of St. Thomas and other islands of the Virgin 
group from which ^l. /niJchellus is recorded. 

In Porto Rico itself this species is limited to the intermediate region 
between about 500 and 1,500 feet altitude, though in exceptional 
localities specimens may be found above and l)elow these limits. We 
found it common at Utuado and Adjuntas, also on the (Jatalina Plant- 
ation, but it is not found normally on the coast plain, where its place 
is taken by A. ptdchellux, nor on the higher mountain tops.

The type locality of AdoUs pulchcl/uv is given as Martinique, col- 
lected ))y Plee, but it can ])e asserted with confidence that the state- 
ment is erroneous, and that the species does not occur in that island, 
nor in fact on any of the Caribbean islands south of the Virgin group. 
It is only one of the nian}^ instances in which Plee's reptiles were 
accredited in Paris to Martinique because shipped from this island. 
Plee collected both in Porto Rico and in St. Thomas, and from one of 
these islands the type has come. 

Dumeril and Bibron's description of A. jjulchellus agrees best with 
the form here so designated. It certainly does not apply to either of 
the species we call A. h'l/gi or A. jjo7icensls. On the other hand, 
there are a few discrepancies in the relative size of the dorsal, lateral, 
and ventral scutellation; but, although rather detailed, the original 
description is not sufiiciently precise. I have not been able to com- 
pare my Porto Rican series with St. Thomas specimens, and there is 
consequently a possibility that they may be different, and that in the 
later case the name of A. jnilcliellus ma}- be applicable to specimens 
from St. Thomas only. In this connection I wish to call attention to 
the possibility that although only one species of this group of Anolis 
is recorded from St. Thomas, namely, A. pulchellus^ at least one other 
may have been confounded with it and overlooked. A large series of 
these lizards from the Virgin Islands is therefore a great desideratum 
as well as a direct comparison with the types in Paris. 

This species is closely allied to A. krugi^ differing chiefl}" in the 
greater extension of the enlarged keeled scales on the back, in the 
much lower and narrower head which is covered with larger scales. In 
A. hnigi the interorbital space is consequently wider with larger and 
more numerous scales between the supraor])ital semicircles, and the 
loreal rows are also more numerous. The adult males are easily told 
apart, the A. pidcheUus having the skin of the dewlap crimson, while 
in A. hrugi it is orange.

ing of one very long and narrow anterior shield, followed by a double 
row of small scales separating the supraocular granules from those sur- 
rounding the eye; loreal rows four; subocular semicircle keeled, broadly 
in contact with supralabials; eight sup ralabials, keeled, the sixth being 
under the center of the eye; temporals granular with a well-de^^eloped 
double supratemporal line of scales; dorsal scales small, much smaller 
than ventrals or those on upper side of arm, keeled, graduall}^ fading 
into the lateral granules; ventrals large, imbricate, sharpl}" keeled, 
the keels forming continuous ridges, those on throat much smaller,

The yemales have a mere indication of dewlap and nuchal fold; the 
young are devoid of both. 

Variation. — The most important variation in this species appears to 
be in the size of the dorsal scales. Thus in the specimen figured the 
median dorsals are nearly as large as the ventrals, while in the one 
described they are much smaller. The single row of scales separating 
the supraocular semicircles is sometimes disconnected sufficiently 
to allow a pair of the semicircular shields to touch. The loreal rows 
vary between four and five, exceptionally six, etc. The relative size 
of the scales on the interorbital space and in the frontal hollow is also 
variable. 

Colm^s of living animal.— Adult male; U.S.N.M. No. 26790 (L. S.

brown; upper surface dull clay-colored, more dusky along the median 
line; head darker, more brownish; from eye to half way down the 
side of neck a broad black line, and another on the edge of the lower

lip; a third ])lackisli line, Init con,sidcr!il)ly faiiitor, on lower edoe of 
mandible, ))ein<^- more distinct between ear and shoulder; tlanks and 
underside Naples-yellow, a stripe on upper lal)ials over ear to shoul- 
der more primrose-3^ellow; on Hanks a series of ol)li([iu', (dong-ated 
spots of brightest gamboge- yellow narrowly margined with blaek; 
skin of dewlap bright crimson anteriorly verging into dark r(jse-pink, 
posteriori}" into orange, the distant scales arranged in rows and 
colored gamboge-yellow. 

Three specimens (No. 26800-2) collected at Oatano, near San Juan 
(sea level), the next day were browner a])Ove and postocular streak 
less dark; no 3"ellow spots on sides. 

An adult nude (No. 26801); L. S. No. DolS) collected at rue])lo Vie jo 
(also near San Juan and at sea level) on February IT was ab<)\-e almost 
olive-yellow, gradually fading into the pale waxy-yellow of the Ixdly; 
head nearly tawny ochniceous; supralabials to oar primrose-3'ellow; 
in continuation with this line a well-delined dusky ])and from ear to 
loin sprinkled minutelv with gaml)oge-yellow and with se^el•al irreg- 
ular cross markings of the same color on tlanks; tail and limbs faintly 
crossbar red with dusky; a l)lack postocular spot, but a dark postocu- 
lar band is only faintly indicated; dewlap crimson as in No. 26T!>!>. 

Another adtdt //ude, same localit}' and date (No. 26810), is similar, 
but color above more dark olive, strongly contrasting with the flanks, 
which are bright lndian-3'ellow; a few dusk}' specks in the olive- 
colored area. 

In none of the above specimens was there an3' lateral pale band 
beyond the shoulders. I have recorded two specimens, however, both 
taken at Pueblo Viejo, the same locality as the ones descri])ed above, 
on February l-i and IT, respectively, which had a light band on the 
flanks when alive. Of these, No. 26808 (L. S. No. !»015) is quite y<><ni(j. 
Above rich tawney brown, with irregular dusky markings; upper 
mandible and a stripe over the ear to the shoulder sulphur-yellow, 
continued behind to the groin, but duller ochre-yellow, and bordered 
above and below by a dusky line; underside pale straw-yellow. 

The other specimen. No. 26811 (L. S. No. 9020"), .is quite similar to 
Nos. 26809 and 26810, described al)ove, but upper side and flanks are 
rather densety speckled with blackish; the supralabial-supraauricular 
band is primrose-3"ellow to the shoulders and continues beyond as a 
distinct gamboge-yellow ])and to the groin, the flaidvs underneath it 
being pale olive with yellow, dusky-margined vertical markings like 
No. 26T99; as in all tiie other specimens, the dewlap is crimson. 

Curiously enough this yellow lateral l)and, which in this species 
appears to be exceptional, fades out entirel}' in the alc<diolic speci- 
mens, while it is permanent in the allied A. hrugl. 

Habitat. — Anolis jpidclielltis., as mentioned above, is not confined to 
Porto Rico, l)ut is recorded as numerous in the Virgin Islands, speci-

men.s from St. Thomas, St. Croix, Tortola, and Just van T>\ck being 
in the Copenhagen museum. The hitter also has it from Vieques, 
though neither the jp'ish Hawk expedition nor I myself collected it on 
that island, and for some unexplained reason it ma}' be scarce around 
Isal)ella Segunda, the onl}' locality visited b^^ us. Prof. S. Garman 
also mentions specimens in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cam- 
bridge, as having been collected by Professor Ackermann at Port au 
Prince, Haiti; but, as in the case of Aiiolis stratulus, this locality is 
unconfirmed, and no other collector has apparently found this species 
in Haiti. Is it possible that there is some error involved in Professor 
Ackermann's record and that the specimens of both species were 
actually collected in St. Thomas, although possibly shipped from Haiti? 
In Porto Rico ^1. pidcheJlus is confined to the coastal plain and its 
extensions into the larger river valleys up to an altitude of about .500 
feet. The highest localities from which we have it are Caguas and 
Utuado. At the latter place it occurs alongside of A. Irugl^ which 
occupies the higher altitudes.

in some points of the scutellation of the head, namely in the wide 
contact of the supraocular semicircles, which probably are more com- 
monly separated by a single row of scales, and in the single row sepa- 
rating the occipital shield from the semicircles, there being- usually two 
rows. No. 27290 is rather extreme in the latter respect, the occipital 
being broken up so that there appears to be three such rows (fig. 121.) 

The degree of distinctness of the keels or wrinkles on the head 
scales is greatly variable, as in some of the younger specimens these 
scales are smooth or nearl}' so.

with cinnamon on the sides; middle portion of l)ack about five scales 
wide, uniform without spots, but on the sides of back

which, howev^er, appears to be whitish; iris blackish brown. 

Three yoiuujcr specimens collected at the same place and time ditfer 
in coloration in that they have a well-defined, nearly white median 
dorsal line, one whole and two half scales to three whole scales wide, 
bordered on each side l)y a wide blackish-brown band, which is a con- 
tinuation of the transocular blackish patch seen in the adult; ])elow 
this another, but very narrow, whitish line on the ])()undarv between 
back and sides in continuation of the subocular white band. 

Hah/tat. — Thus far this new species is only known from the type 
locality, 3 miles east of the city of Ponce. It was on the very last 
day of our collecting- in Porto Kico that we almost stumbled upon this 
very distinct novelty. On the morning of that day Dr. Richmond 
went out alone collecting-, as 1 myself was invalided so as to he able to 
walk any distance only with difficulty, and at noon he returned with a 
single lizard. This 1 at once recognized as an mdvnown species, and 
as Dr. Richmond fortunately remembered the exact s])()t ^vhere he 
collected it we took at once a carriage and drove out to the place, 
which is on the south side of the military road. On the side of a little 
hill, rising less than a hundred feet up from the coastal plain, and 
consisting of disintegrating coral limestone, we found a few additional 
specimens, mostly 3'ounger ones, among the scant grass and weeds. 
They were exceedingly agile, \\kQ A)iolts pulclnU ux^ which was found 
in the same locality, l)ut were not common. 

Honarhs. — Though closely allied to A/io//'-'< l-ni(ji and A. piiU-luHus^ 
the present species is very distinct, and much more so than these are 
from each other; in fact, its uniform covering of large, strongly im- 
bricated keeled scales, with hardly any granules anywhere, is almost 
unique. The perfectly covered white dewlaj) and the coloration are 
also very characteristic.

There are certain intlications that the hirge rock iguana which lives on 
Mona Island is difi'erent from what is usiiall_y considered typical Gyclura 
cornuta from Haiti, but laclc of specimens from the latter island for 
direct comparison with our four ^lona specimens makes it impossible 
to prove it at present. These lizards are scarce in collections, and in 
no one museum is there at present material enough to decide the ques- 
tion; in fact, there is only one museum which has specimens both 
from Haiti and from Mona, one from the former and two from the 
latter island. 

The first character to attract ni}^ attention was the absence of an 
intercalary row of scales between rostral and nasals in all the known 
specimens from Mona Island, six in all, namely, four in the U. S. 
National Museum and two in the museum at Hamburg. Moreover, 
all our Mona specimens have a double row of scales between the 
median frontal horn and the last one of the prefrontal shields or 
horns. 

In the Haitian or Santo Domingan specimens which I have seen, or 
of which I have record, these features are as follows: In the type 
(from Santo Domingo) described by Dumeril and Bibron the series 
of scales between rostral and nasal is well developed; so I found it in 
the specimen in the Hamburg Museum (No. 101:7); so also in the spec- 
imen from Gonaives, Haiti, in the Vienna Hof Museum (collected by 
Erber in 187S); and so Prof. S. Garman writes me that it is in the 
Haitian specimen in the Museum of Comparative Zoology (from 
Jeremie, Haiti, collected by Dr. D. F. Weinland). But according to 
a recent letter from my friend, Dr. Siebenrock, there is another spec- 
imen in the Vienna Museum from Haiti in which "the rostral is sepa- 
rated from the nasals by a series of scales only laterally but not 
medially." Consequently, out of six Mona specimens and five from 

a kvkXo<;, ring; ovpd, tail. ^Latin=h6rned. 



HEKPETOLOGY OF PORTO RICO. ^71 

Haiti, one from the latter agrees at least partly with the former in 
the relation of tlu^ rostral to the nasals. 

In our four Mona Island specimens (the Ham])urg- specimens were 
not examined for this characte)-) the frontal median hoi-n is separated 
from the nearest pi'efrontal shield or horn l)y a double row of scales. 
In the type of C. cornu'a there seems to be no interval ino- series at 
all ("la troisieme plaque * * * touche a la pr()tuberanc(> frontal(>/' 
Dumeril andBibron,p. 212); in the Camlu-idge specimen '-the horn Is 
separated from the hindmost of the three enlarged scales by a single 
row of very narrow scales" (S. Garman in letter); according to Dr. 
Siebenrock's statement to me the Vienna specimeti from (lonaiv(\s has 
likewise only one row of intervening- scales, and as he makes no excep- 
tion for the second specimen I conclude that this is similar. 

As will be noted further on, there may l)e other diftVrences, more 
important, perhaps, though less obvious, but which have not been 
verified in the whole series. There is consequently very good reason 
for believing that the Mona Island iguana is distinct, and 1 would 
have hesitated ])ut little to descri))e it as such were it not for Dr. (iun- 
tlier's description and figure of a specimen from an unknown locality 
in the Zoological Garden of London." These agree so minutely with 
the specimens from Mona that if his specimen did not come from 
that island the idea of the existence of two species would most likely 
have to be abandoned, for it nuist be admitted that the chances of a 
Mona Island iguana hav'ing found its way to the Zoological Garden in 
London as early as 1882 are very slight, and it is certainly nuu'li more 
likely that it came from Haiti or Santo Domingo. There is of course 
a possibility that two forms occur in the latter island, one of which is 
identical with the Mona form, but the whole matter is thrown into 
such uncertainty that it seems best to await the accumulation of more 
authentic material l)efore deciding. 

In calling attention to the differences thus far noticed others may be 
in a position to judge better, and I therefore subjoin the few additional 
notes which I made in comparing the three specimens from Haiti and 
Mona in the museum at Hamburg. In the adult ]\Iona specimen I 
found the enlarged keeled scales on the forearm nnich smaller than in 
the one from Haiti (ratio 20 to 12), the preauricular tubercles were 
much larger, also the median frontal horn; the two cond)s on the third 
toe were very large in the one from Mona, nmch larger than in the 
Haitian specimen.

SO many of the head shields develop into horns and tubercules, the 
boundaries between the scales and their shapes become oliscured. 

The adults which reach a length of at least 1 meter are character- 
ized b}^ the enormous development of some of the head shields into 
pointed horns or cones, and the increase in the height of the spines 
which form the crests on neck, back, and tail. 

Thus, in No. 29366, an adult male about 1.06 m. long, the frontal 
horn is 9 mm. high and the lower preauricular shield has grown out 
to form a stout horn not less than 12 mm. high; the posterior pair of 
the prefrontal shields are also raised, forming hornlike protuberances; 
many other scales have their keels form sharp ridges or knobs; thus 
several at the posterior end of the superciliary ridge, the median pre- 
auricular, a smaller shield in front of the big lower preauricular at 
the angle of the mouth, one or two of the posterior suboculars and 
the posterior scales of the mandibidar or malar series. The nuchal 
crest is very low, scarcely more than 2 nun. high, but the scales of 
the median dorsal series have developed into flattened, more or less 
falcate spines, the longest of which are 17 nmi., while the spines of the 
caudal crest, which are stronger and broader at the base, measure no 
less than 19 mm. In this specimen the vertical diameter of the tym- 
panum is 17 mm. and equals seven of the larger keeled scales on the 
forearm and ten dorsal scale rows. The femoral pores are in two rows, 
with a few additional forming a third row near the upper end. Length 
from tip of snout to ear, 101 mm. ; width of head, exclusive of pre- 
auricular spines, 76 mm. 

No. 29365, another adult male, differs but little from the above, the 
main dift'erence being that the preauricular spines are hardly devel- 
oped. The femoral pores are arranged in three unequal rows, 18-19 
in the anterior row, which is the longest. 

The adult female (No. 2!»642) does not difl'er much, except that the 
spines are somewhat smaller; thus the lower preauricular spine is 
onl}^ 9 mm., the highest dorsal also 9, and the highest caudal 13 mm. 
The femoral pores are not large and are arranged in one complete 
series, with a second incomplete in the intervals between the first. 

The number of dorsal spines seems to be quite constant, var3"ing as 
it does in our four specimens only between 50 and 55, as follows: No. 
29365, 50; No. 29366, 50; No. 29367, 51; No. 29642, 55. 

llahltat. — If the present species is correctly referred to Cydura 
cormda, the habitat embraces the whole island of Haiti as well as 
Mona. In the latter island Mr. Bowdish found it among the rocks.

A number of names cluster around the original Amp}dsl>sena cee,ca, 
described from a specimen said to have come from Martinique. 
Specimens have been mentioned and described from various localities 
in the West Indies or even in South America.^ namely, from the 
alleged type locality as given abovx, the Virgin Islands, Porto Rico, 
Haiti, and Cuba. Some of these have received separate names, such 
as A. fenestrata from the Virgin Islands, A. innocens from Haiti, and 
A. Gubana from Cuba. The characters assigned to the first and last 
of these are such that they have been recognized by most writers as 
distinct species, though it should be mentioned that Boulenger has 
expressed the opinion that the fusion of the ocular with the second 
supralabial in both type specimens of A. ciibana (the only ones known 
at the time he wrote) may be an individual anomaly. This is not 
likely, however, as the U. S. National Museum has recentl}^ received 
two specimens from Matanzas, Cuba (Nos. 26363 and 26364), 
which in the relation of oculars and second supralabial agree 
minutely with the types. More specimens of A. fenestrata than of 
all the other West Indian species have reached the museums, and 
it seems that all those recorded from the Virgin Islands, with one 
exception, to be mentioned further on, agree in having the rostral 
produced so far backward as to completely separate the nasals from 
each other, a pecnliarity thus far not observed in any specimen of 
this group from any other locality. The exception alluded to above 
is a specimen in the Paris Museum, mentioned by Strauch ^ and alleged 
to l)e from St. Thomas, having been obtained from the Copenhagen 
Museum. It is possible that there is a mistake about the localit}^, for 
it is not likely that Reinhardt and Luetken, in describing A. antillen- 
sis {—fenestrata)^ should have overlooked this specimen. On the 
other hand, the Copenhagen Museum may have received it since the 

« Latin =blind. 

''Thus Boulenger's Amphisbwna aem (Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., II, 1885, p. 445), from 
Porto Bello, probably in Brazil, has later on been recognized by himself as not 
belonging to Cuvier' s species, and is stated to be the same as Boulenger's Amphisbxna 
ridlcyi, from Fernando Noronha.

gestion tiiat it is only annhnornml A. fe7iesfr((U/, however, is streno-th- 
ened by the number of ])ody ring-s, which is said to be 247. 

Aiivphhhaena Innoeeiix from Haiti has l)een pronounced an unquali- 
lied sj^nonym of A. eseea h\ such authorities as Peters " and Strauch,'' 
both of whom had the opportunity of comparing the types of both 
species. Reluctant as 1 am to question their conclusion without having 
examined the same material, I would call attention to the small 
num))er of body rings in the Haitian specimens, 211-215. and to the 
occui'rence of only two small scutes ))ehind the unpaired postmeiital 
instead of three. Moreover, a specimen in the U. S. National Museiun 
(No. I0i(>8) from the Island de la Gonaives, off Port au Prince, Haiti, 
consequently not very far from the type locality of A. hniocen-s, shows 
these same characters (211 bod}^ rings, 13 caudal rings). In addition 
it has 18 segments above the lateral line and 24 below it. Another 
Haitian specimen (Hamburg Museum, No. 1983) is recorded by Meer- 
warth as having 211 body rings and 14 caudal rings; it has IC segments 
above the lateral line and 21 below. Consecpiently it agrees closely 
with the others and differs in all these points from true ^1. cseca. 

The whole question hinges essentially on the amount of individual 
variation to be found in specimens from the same locality. Unfortu- 
nately, not only is the number of specimens from each locality very 
limited, but not all the specimens known to exist have l)een described 
individually with sufficient details. The only minutiae given for nearly 
all the specimens are the number of rings on the body and tail. If 
we place these ffgures together it will be seen that in the specimens 
hitherto recorded there is a certain uniformity in those from each 
locality, with a perceptible difference according to the various localities, 
as follows: 

Martinique {i) specimens (^4. c»ca), 227-230 bodv rings; 18 on tail. 

Virgin Islands specimens {A.fe)iestr(it<()^ 242-250 body rings; 13-16 
on tail. 

Haitian specimens (.4. innocenx), 211-215 body rings; 13-15 on tail. 

That we have not to do with a curious coincidence only, due in a 
measure to the scantness of the material, seems certain from a consid- 
eration of the specimens from the Virgin Islands and from Porto 
Rico. Specimens from the former islands are more common in 
museums than the other species, about 10 })eing recorded in some 
detail, including the one St. Thomas specimen in the Paris Museum

678 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

referred to A. cseca ))y Strauch and mentioned above. In addition I 
have before me a specimen (U.S.N.M. No. 11715) from St. John, 
proba])ly one of the types of .1. fenedrata. In all these 11 specimens 
the body rings vary only between 212 and 250 and the caudal rings 
between 13 and 16. I ma_y further add that our specimen agrees 
exactly with the other details recorded by Boulenger in his description 
of the 3 specimens in the British Museum, namely, 2 temporals, 4 to 
6 preanals, 12 to 14 segments a])Ove the lateral line and 14 below in a 
ring around the middle of the ])ody. Finally, Reinhardt and Luetken 
mention one temporal (or postocular) as an exception. Even if we 
include the so-called ^1. Ccera ixoiw St. Thomas as an abnormal speci- 
men, ha^'ing the nasals contiguous behind the rostral, it will 1)6 seen 
that in this series of 11 specimens the individual variation is Imt very 
slight. This result tallies exactly with that obtained from an examina- 
tion of 19 Porto Rican specimens of one species, the largest series 3^et 
compared anywhere, showing that these animals exhibit a most unex- 
pected small varial)ility in certain characters contrary to what was 
formerly believed to l>e the case. 

An examination of the five specimens of Anvphisbsena collected at 
Lares by Mr. Baker shows that they fall into two groups. The first, 
consisting of three specimens, has 221 to 230 body rings and 17 to 19 
rings on the tail; 1 postocular + 1 temporal; nasal suture short, not 
longer than portion of rostral visible from above, or entirely lacking, 
the rostral in one specimen being l)arely in contact with one of the 
prefrontals; color, darker. In the other group of two specimens the 
rings on the body are 249 and 251 and on the tail 16; a single post- 
ocular and no temporal; long nasal suture, it being about three times 
longer thaii the portion of the rostral visible from above; color, paler. 
Preanals, number of segments around the body, and postmental scutes 
nearly alike in both groups. 

The fact that these specimens were collected in the same locality, 
and the evident close relationship of the two groups, at first suggested 
that we had to deal with a rather extreme case of individual variation. 
On the other hand, the correlation of such a great number of charac- 
ters w^th no indication of intergradation, viewed in the light of the 
conclusions arrived at from a study of the forms collected in the other 
islands, convinced me of the specific distinctness of the two groups of 
specimens. 

This conclusion, which I had arrived at before my visit to Porto Rico, 
was amply sustained by the material l)rought home by me or received 
since my return. This material consists of IT additional specimens, 16 
of which belong to the group having a short nasal suture, 1 temporal, 
and 220 to 230 body rings, while the seventeenth specimen is as typical 
of the other group, having a long nasal suture, no temporal, and 250 
body rings.

I'he fact that the types of A. ccrca are said to have been collect(»d 
in jVIartinique is of no nionient whatever, and it is pretty safe to 
say tiiat the .species does not occur 
there. It is now known that Plee,

Yariation. — The amount of variation in the large series of 19 speci- 
mens before me is rather insignificant and affects chiefly the arrange- 
ment of the occipitals. Thev are alwaj^s broader than long, but they 
are in contact behind the frontal as often as they are separated. One 
specimen (No. 25540) is rather more aberrant, inasmuch as the ros- 
tral is elongated backward somewhat imsymmetrically so as to touch 
the right prefrontal and thi;s prevent the contact between the nasals. 
In this specimen the temporal is also prolonged downward so as to 
touch the corner of the mouth with its lowest point. The number of 
rings varies only between 220 and 230 in a series of at least 20 speci- 
mens; the dorsal segments vary between 14 and 16, and the ventral 
segments between 16 and IS. The number of postgeneials is invaria- 
bly 3, of anal shields 6. 

Ilahltat. — ^The true Amplushse.na cseca has thus far only been found 
in Porto Rico, where it seems to inhabit tho lowlands and the moun- 
tain sides, possibly as high up as 1,000 feet altitude. In the eastern 
end of the island we collected it on the Catalina plantation, on the 
northern flank of El Yunque, at an altitude of about 890 feet, while 
in the west Mr. Baker obtained it at Lares. Mr. J. Michaelis, in 
1900, sent a specimen to the Hamlnirg Museum from Arecibo. We 
found it under stones, burrowing like earthworms, or in ants' nests.

AMPHISBiENA BAKERI," new species. 

Diagnosis. — Nasal.s foriiii»t>' a long- suture on the snout, more than 
twice longer than portion of rostral visible from above, and about one- 
half the prefrontal suture; four anal pores; two prefrontals; no tempo-

about 250 rings on the body; 6 anals; ocular forming 
suture with second and third supralabials; 8 small scutes 
(postgeneials) behind unpaired postmental. 

Type.—V. S. N. M., No. 25541; Lares, Porto Rico;

Varlatuni. — Apart from a slight oscillation in the relative length of 
the sutures on the head the variability is insignificant. As in ^4. cpeca^ 
the occipitals appear most subject to variation, but they seem to be 
longer than l)road, as a rule, even in the ch^irly a))normal specimen 
(No. 255H7) as shown in lig-. i?A. The number of rings varies only

between 249 and 251 in the three specimens at hand, but more specimens 
will undoubtedly show a o-reater range, though probably not more than 
a difference of ten, as in A. civva. 

The ventral segments vary between 16 and IS in our specimens, but 
otherwise the scale formula is constant. The eye is plainl}^ visible in 
No. 27458. 

JIahltat. — Apparently confined to Porto Rico. The only definite 
locality whence we have specimens is Lares, where Mr. A. B. Baker 
collected two specimens. A third one was sent by Mr. (Charles E. 
Adams from Porto Rico without any record as to the place where it 
was actually taken. 

Remarks. — In addition to the characters pointed out in the key and 
diagnosis, this interesting- novelty ditfers from A. cxca in several 
other points, the constancy of which, however, must remain doubtful 
till more specimens can be examined. Such are the elongation and 
broad contact of the occipitals and the lighter color, but the other 
characters, as demonstrated by the great uniformity In the large series 
of A. cxca^ are sufficient to distinguish ^1. hakeri.

Tlio l)lind-siiake.s are small })urr()Avino' snakes, smooth and nearly 
CTlindrical, and covered with rounded imbricate scales of nearly uniform 
size and s!iape both above and lielow; only a few shields covering the 
anterior portion of the head are clearly differentiated from the rest. 
The eye is concealed under a large shield and may be shining through 
as a blackish spot or be entirely invisible. They have teeth only in 
the upper jaw, and there is no enlarged preanal shield. 

At the first glance they resemble earthworms, and like these animals 
they live underground in self-made burrows. 

Two species of blind-snakes occur in Porto Rico, one of which is 
here described as new. They may be distinguished as follows:

whitish below; twenty to twenty-two scale rows T. IwnbricaHs, p. 684

YarUifion. — The individual varia- 
tion in scutellation and color is l)ut 
slight. Tlie number of scale rows 
in six specimens from Porto Rico 
and Mona is 20; in 2 (U.S.N. M. 
Nos. 29198 and 30908) it is 22. The 
color of one of the specimens from Mona Island in the Hamburg 
Museum (No. 1582), examined by me in August, 1901, was nearly 
uniform whitish, having the appearance of an albino. 

Ildhltai. — The true Typldopx, //^///7;/'/cv///.s extends from South Amer- 
ica into nearly all the Antillean islands. Thus, it is recorded from 
Martinique, Guadeloupe, Dominica, St. Kitts, Antigua, the Virgin 
Islands, Porto Rico, Mona, Haiti, Cuba, and Jamaica. 

In Porto Rico it has thus far been found only in the low land, not 
far above sea level. There are two specimens in the Hamburg 
Museum from Mona Island, collected bv Mr. Bock in 1891 and 1894.

Variidloii. — Phe individual variation appears to be similar in char- 
acter and extent to that indicated for Tuplilopx Imnhrkudis. Three of 
our specimens have 18 scale rows, the fourth has 20. 

JIabifat. — Thus far the only definite locality whence we have 
received this species is Lares, in the western part of Porto Kico. In 
this place Mr. A, B. Baker obtained three specimens. A fourth was 
sent from Porto Rico ])y Mr. Charles E. Adams, but without indica- 
tion of the exact locality where he collected it. 

lieiiKd'l's. — This interesting novelty resembles in color closely the 
specimens which Boulenger has described from Dominica under the 
name of Ty2)1(^ <>l>^ }>^ nt ii<'(-l>^>(fl^i^- The latter differ, however, by hav- 
ing- 24 scale rows around the body and by a much wider rostral which 
is said to be one-third the widtli of the head. Dumeril and Bibron's 
TypJdops j>JatycrphaJ>is^ wdiich is said to have come from Martini({ue, 
collected by Plee, nuist l)e a very diti'erent one from the Dominica 
species. It is described as having 20 scale rows and it might conse- 
quently be suspected to be the same as our Porto Rican species, but 
apart from the radically diti'erent coloration, the true T. ]>l(tfii<;'plinhiii 
is descril)edas liaving the head more depressed than T. luiiihf/caJis and 
the posterior supralabials much lower, while, as we have seen, two of 
the })est characters of our new T. ro-stelJufus are the lack of depres- 
sion in the profile of th(» head and the unusual height of the posterior 
supralabials. 

Boulenger's T. j>I<ft//cc/>/HfIt/s" is apparently different from that of 
Dumeril and Bibron and may ]>e appropriately named TypJilop^ doinhi- 
Icana^ from the island of Dominica, of which it is a native.

The snakes of this genus belong to the Boicl family, characterized, 
among other things, by the vestiges of posterior limbs, which are often 
visible on the sides of the vent as small, claw-like appendages. The 
Boas, as a rule, have undivided subcaudal shields and are mostly 
inhabitants of the New World. They are not poisonous, but kill their 
prey by squeezing it to death. 

Two species occur within the territory covered b}' this report, one 
in Porto B.ico proper, the other in Mona Island, both related to species 
inhabiting other islands of the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas. 

The two species may be distinguished as follows:

Yariation. — There is considerable variation in the head shields, mostly 
due, however, to the breaking' up of the individual scales than to their 

original difl'erence in shape and 
proportions. The only ^oung 
specimen examined by me (No. 
1244()) appears the most normal 
and is consequently figured here 
(figs. 151-152). The scutellation 
of the others can readily be re- 
ferred to this model. The nasal is 
often undivided, possibl}^ oftener 
so than divided. The scale rows 
round the body vary between 38 
and 42, ventrals (in 12 specimens) 
between 261 and 271, and caudals 
between 67 and 75 when tail is not defective. Specimens with 36-57 
caudals have probably lost the tip of the tail T)y accident.

ventrolateral) are recognizable; the crossbars increase in width pos- 
teriorly; a blackish postocular band indistinctly connected with a 
medio-lateral faint longitudinal line on the neck; supralabials fading

No. 29583 a somewhat smaller individual (1,5()() nun. total length) 
brought home hy Mr. liowdish is very similar in coloration, only the 
underside is more slate color, and the pattern much more distinct, the 
crossbars showing paler centers with ))lackish margins; t\w spots of 
the lateral series show a tendency to form a lateral l>lackis]i line on the 
anterior third of the body. 

No. 2745() (1, .■)*,♦( > nnn. long), collected by Captain Hansard, died at 
the National Zoological Park on July 0, 19(10, show(Kl hardly any traces 
of bars or spots; general color al)ove, chestnut, darkest on the median 
region and tail, gradually becoming lighter toward the ventrals; the 
latter brownish-slate color with pale edges; throat and chin mottled 
dull rufous and brownish slate; scattered obscure dusky spots on 
flanks. 

Ilahltaf. — This large snake is contined to Porto Rico, where it is 
found in wooded and rocky places of the foothills. It is now" getting 
to be rather rare, so nmch so that neither the FlsJihairl' parties, Mr. 
Baker, Dr. Richmond, nor myself saw one during our explorations. 
Mr. Baker, however, saw the trail of them in the grass. 

E. mornafiis has l)een recorded unqualifiedly from Haiti ))y Bocourt 
upon the strength of a specimen in the Paris Museum. He gives no 
particulars, however, but there can be no doiil)t that it is the same 
specimen briefly described by DumeriP' as showing some peculiarities in 
the cephalic scutellation as well as a very aberrant coloration. Dumeril 
himself seems strongly inclined to regard it as belonging to a difl'erent 
species, and to me it appears quite possible that the specimen in <pies- 
tion may be a young E.ford'il. 

Zenneck* gives Cuba as one of the localities of Eplcrates inornatus 
and cites Bibron'' as authority, but I have been unable to find any such 
reference. As a matter of fact, Bibron's work was published before 
Reinhardt described E. inoniatus.

nasal and loreal; loreal large, longer than liigii and in contact with 
nasal, ])c>th prefrontals, prcocular and second, third, fourth, and fifth 
supralabials; a large preocular with a suhpreocular consisting of the 
detached upper half of sixth supralabial; seventh supralahial reaches 
eye; eighth supralabial separated from eye b}- a small snbocular; no 
labial pits; live postoculars; temporal scales small, somewhat larger 
and more angular than the l)ody scales; 42 scales around the body; 
259 ventrals; anal entire; 7!) subcaudals. 

The pattern of the upper side of the l)ody consists of two upper 
(dorso-lateral) rows of spots, which almost everj^wdiere are connected 
with each other across the back; the dorso-lateral spots, which extend 
to the end of the tail, are of more irregular form than in E. f()rdli^ 
their number varying between 51 and 57; on the sides of the bod}', 
but not beyond the vent, there is a single row of rather large spots, 
which frequently connect with those of the upper side so as to form 
transverse bands; a rather indistinct postocular stripe seems to be a 
continuation of the lateral scale row; on the head there are but traces 
of markings except on the posterior part; the ground color of the 
upper surfaces is a very light yellowash-brown in the young specimens, 
the markings very dark ])rownish-black; in the older ones the ground 
color is much darker, so as to make the markings less prominent.

The largest adult specimen (No. 2034b), with a defective tail, meas- 
ures from snout to vent 1.010 m, 

Yarkit'ion. — According to Meerwarth the scale rows (in five speci- 
mens) vary from 38 to43, the ventrals from 250 to 2r)t), and the caudals 
(in two specimens) from 79 to 82. Four specimens have 13 suprala})ials 
on both sides, one (No. 2034a) has 11 on one side, 13 on the other. 

Ilahiiat. — This form seems to be confined to Mona Isliuid. Not- 
withstanding the fact that Bock collected five specimens for the museum 
in Hamburg it can not be connnon there, for Mr. Bowdish, during 
his visit to the island in 1901 failed to see a single one. In his letter 
he assures me that it was entirely unknown to the few inhabitants now 
living there. 

Remarks. — Never having seen a specimen of JE. fordil I shall pass 
no opinion on the distinctness of E. moiiensis. The latter certainly 
seems to have more scale rows (38 to 43 as against 33 to 37) and if 
E. fordil always has one or more scales interpolated between the pos- 
terior prefrontals as indicated 1)\' Zenneck's figures, the}' may be more 
distinct than Meerwarth seems to admit, as he makes E. monensU a 
variety of E. fordil. 



694 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 



On the other hand, I would call attention to the fact that in many 
points E. inoiiensh agrees more closely with Cope's E. chnjtiogader^ 
from Turks Island, Bahamas, which certainly merits separation" if 
E. monensls is entitled to specific or subspecihc rank. Thus E. chry- 
sogaster has 43 scale rows. It has 54 dorsal spots {E. r/wnensis 51-57; 
E. furdil 69-78). The number of the spots is the cardinal point which 
led Zenneck to regard E. monensis as a species distinct from E. fordil. 
It will be seen that E. chry.'ioganter in this respect is identical, so much 
so that E. monensis and E. chry wg aster ^ to use Dr. Zenneck's phrase- 
olog-y, are only ditierent " Zeichnungsf ormen " of the same thing. 
He suggests differences, however, in the cephalic scutellation, and until 
that (question can be settled it is the better plan to keep the different 
forms apart under separate names. 

There are no specimens of this form in the U. S. National Museum, 
and I only know it from a cursory examination of the five specimens 
in the Ilamlnirg- Museum in August, 1901, when the above description 
was made.

Onlv two ooronollinc .en era occur in Porto Rico, both of which are 
very inu.-h alike. Thev may be easily disting-uishcd by the presence 
or absence of paired pores, or round transhicent spots, near the apex 
of the dorsal scales. In the present oenus there is occasionally found 
asinole more or less obscure, pore, but in the genus AIs<.j>/us th,^ ptiir 
is very much in evidence, and can usually be seen with the iiaked eye. 
■ Two species occur within our territ..rial limits, the ciiiet distinction 
of whic4i is the number of subcaudal shields. They may be id.mtihed 
as follows:

Vaination. — Only one of the specimens examined shows any marked 
variation, namely, No. 20883, in which the posterior nasal is fused with 
the loreal. The number of ventrals (in 10 specimens) vary between 

151 and 159, the subcaudals between 83 
and 97 pairs. The coloration is also fairly 
constant. In No. 25529, the largest speci- 
men at hand (550 mm.), the spots on the 
median dorsal row are forming an almost 
continuous line; the underside is also less 
dusted over, the blackish specks being more concentrated in the lateral 
abdominal line, which is rather broad and continuous, and toward the 
middle line, Avhere they form two lines of ill-defined spots. In No. 
26883 (fig. lt;i) the median dorsal line of spots is but slightly indicated.

IMifdf.—Thuti far this species has only l)een known from St. Thcmias

secured a single specimen there. The probability is that it will also 
be found on Vieques. It does not occur in Porto Rico proper, where 
its place is taken by Le'DnadopHs sfahh\ described above. 

Bemarl-s.—Tho only essential difference between Z. ,:.e!guus and 
L. stahJi seems to be the lower number of ventrals in the former. 
Altogether 1^9 specimens of both species have ])een examined and 
recordtnl, and in these the difference is marked and constant.

1894. Dromicus Boulenoer, Cat. Sn. Brit. Mus., II, p. 118 (type D. aiKjulifer),

The species of this genus reseinl)le those of Leimadoj>his closely, 
but may easily be distinguished by the pair of conspicuous pores or 
pits near the tip of the dorsal scales. 

The type of Bibron's genus Droinicas is plainh" stated to be (Joluher 
curmr of Lacepede, and J>. (inguUfer, therefore, can not be so 
regarded. 

Two species of this West Indian genus occur within our territory, 
their distribution being exactly parallel to that of the two .species 
of Leimadophis^ inasmuch as one inhal)its Porto Rico proper (and 
Mona Island), while the other is confined to the Virgin Islands, Culebra 
and Vieques. The chief diHerence in this case is not in the number 
of the ventrals, which is almost the same in the two species, l)ut in the 
number of scale rows round the body. 

The}" may be distinguished as follows: 

«' Scale rows, 17; iifth scale row without any distinctive color feature. 

A. portoricensis, p. 700. 
a^ Scale rows, 19; every second or third scale of the fifth scale row particolored,

From the above synonymy it might be inferred that the present 
species is most intimatel}^ related to AUophis smicticrucis of Cope, as 
it has been made a su])species of the latter by authors who regard 
A. antillensis as specifically distinct. Such is not the case, however. 
This treatment of the three forms is only due to the fact that both A. 
poTtor'tct'nxh and A. sanetlcrucis have 17 scale rows while A. antillen- 
sis has 19. But apart from the difl'erence in the number of ventrals 
between the former, a character at least as important as that of the 
scale rows, the ^1. lyoi'torieencis and A. antillensis are realh' more nearly 
related than either of them is to A. sancticrucis.

The question whether Cope's ^I. inchoucJi/ius, from lluiti, is iden- 
tical witli the Porto Kican specii^s can not l)e said to ])e settled yet. The 
scale formula seem to be tiie same. l)ut it is not certain that tliere ma}" 
not 1)e other distino'uisliino- features. It will be noted that the AIsopJus 
from ]\Iona is referred to the Porto Kican form witiiout hesitation by 
those haA'iny" had an opportunity to exainin(> it, but it should be 
remembered that none of these authors luid any Porto Rican speci- 
mens for com})aris()n and that the identitication is liased entirely on 
the scale formula, lender these circumstances the whole (juestion 
can not be sohed until someone is able to com})are directly laro-e scries 
from each of these islands. We Xyaxq such startling- proof of the eli'ect 
of isolation working- with a variable material 
to })roduce sei)arate forms of these snakes 
that it is ({uite unwarrantable to lump 
the various names without incontrovertible 
proof. 

Professor Garman" mentions as a good 
distinguishing character of the Porto Rican 
specimens "the narrow^ness of the h)wer 
postorbital.'' This charactei" is not confined 
to this form alone, as it is also found in 
Alsoph is (Oitlllensis.

Variation. — The scutellation of this species shows very little varia- 
tion. Of •i-i specimens referred to it all have 17 scale rows; nor is it 
known that the number of labials, temporals, or oculars show any 
abnormalities in this large series. The ventrals vary between 109 and 
183 (average ITs) and the su])caudals between 112 and 129 pairs. 

The coloration is apparently more variable. A somewhat larger 
specimen from the same locality as the one described above is colored 
essentially alike, and with these agree the type specimens from Porto 
Rico as described ]).y Reinhardt and Luetken. Our single specimen 
from Desecheo Island (No. 29356), which is somewhat smaller, does not 
show the characteristic reticulation, there being only some scattered 
black edges to the lateral scales; the underside is whitish, with no 
black posterior edge to the ventrals or caudals, Init the throat is 
densely speckled with blackish and there is an interrupted dusky line 
on each side of the abdomen on the lateral angle; the upper labials are 
white with numerous blackish spots near the commissure; a heavy 
black line across the rostral extends on each side of the face on the 
upper labial suture through the eye, continuing backward on the side 
of the neck where it gradually disappears as a series of ill-defined 
spots; there are also traces of a blackish line on the parietal suture 
with a posterior continuation as a median vertebral line. Mr. Meer- 
warth indicates a similar, though greatly variable, coloration for the 
large series of snakes from Mona Island. 

Professor Garmari mentions that on young Porto Rican specimens 
"the dark-bordered scales are distributed in such way as to form 
irregular transverse bands, more indistinct in larger ones." 

JIalitat. — This species was originally described from Porto Rico 
proper, where it now seems to be comparatively rare, since none of 
the i'T.s'A Hawk parties, including Mr. A. B. Baker, nor Dr. Richmond 
and myself encountered specimens. The mongoose is probabl}^ respon- 
sible for this state of affairs. 

The status of the snake living on Mona Island, especiall}^ with refer- 
ence to the form occurring in Haiti, remains yet to be investigated. 
For the present it is left with the Porto Rican species. It must have 
been ver}^ numerous on that little islet, since no less than 38 speci- 
mens have found their way to the museums of Magdeburg and Ham- 
burg. It is then (juite remarkable that Mr. Bowdish, who visited the 
island in 1901, failed to hear of it there.

species is shown (apart from its habitat) by the peculiar color pattern 
of its fifth scale rows, which shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that 
it is only an abnormal ^1. antiUemis.

Variation. — As in the foregoing species, the scale formula and other 
characters derived from the scutellation are unusually constant. Men- 
tion has already Ijeen made of No. 25556, from Culebra Island, the 
only one out of ?A specimens to have the exceptional number of 17 
scale rows. At the same time it was remarked that this specimen is 
easily identified as Alaophis antillensis by the characteristic pattern of 
the fifth scale row — a feature first mentioned by Mr. Meerwarth. This 
marking appears to ])e constant, howe\'er variable the coloration may 
otherwise be. On the whole the coloration is nmch as in the speci- 
men described above, but in the smaller specimens there is sometimes 
an indistinct dusky vertebral line from the parietal suture backward, 
while on the posterior part of the body and on the tail the scale rows 
next to the ventrals darkens so as to form a more or less distinct longi- 
tudinal band.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 



JIah/tat. — Like Leiuiadojjhis exlyiia.s, the present species does not 
reach Porto Rico jjroper, hut is confined to the islands of St. Thomas 
and St. John, Vieques, and Culebra. It is absent in St. Croix, where 
it is replaced l>y Ahojjhis .sanctlcmcis (Cope), and in Porto Rico proper, 
where the corresponding species is A. portoricensis. 

Prof. S. Garinan records specimens of ^. antillensls in the Museum 
of Comparative Anatom}^, Cambridge, as coming from Haiti. This 
is the only report from this island, I believe, and I can not be but very 
skeptical as to the correctness of the locality, in regard to which I 
refer to similar remarks under Anoll>i stratulus and A. pulchellus, 
pages Qh4i and Q%4i. 

Mr. Riise, who collected for the nuiseum in Copenhagen about forty 
years ago, obtained specimens of tliis spec-ies from Vieques. Neither 
Dr. Richmond, myself, Mr. A. B. Baker, nor any of the other mem- 
bers of the FiMimrh expedition met with it in that island, where it 
must now be rather scarce. On Culebra, however, the snakes are yet 
fairly couunon, and several specimens were collected there by Mr. 
Bajser.

caught, though he does not ^iye the locality. It measured 2.08 meters 
over the curyature of the carapace. The color was of a plumbeous 
gray, with numerous small whitish spots; head and feet somewhat 
darker gray, the latter with whitish spots, the former with dark spots. 
It contained a large number of eggs. 

It may be this same individual to which Dr. Stahl refers. He 
reports that in the playa of Dorado a "tinglado" was seen coming 
out of the sea; it immediately dug a pit, in which it deposited in a 
few moments 78 eggs.

median keel on the carapace; the nuchal is wider, especially in front; 
first vertebral with longer anterior suture than the posterior and 
straig-ht lateral sutures; the vertebrals are wider than long, nearly as 
wide as or, in the smallest specimen, even wider than the costals; the 
wrinkles and ridges are also stronger. The color above is darker, 
and some pale but obscure crossbars may be seen; two of the speci- 
mens have the marginal and costal sutures widely edged with a broad 
pale margin; the dusky markings on the plastron are more distinct; 
the symphyseal median pale line and the two lateral throat lines do 
not meet so as to form a fork. 

Ilahitat. — The present species is recorded from Jamaica, Cuba, 
Haiti, and Porto Rico. There are indications at hand that there may 
be some constant ditferences between those inhabiting the different 
islands, but the material at my disposal is not sufficient to warrant an 
attempt to separate them. 

In Porto Rico the species is found apparently sparingly in streams 
and })()nds in rh(> lowlands.

Genus CARETTA" Rafinesque. 

1814. Carella RAFixEsauE, Specchio d. Sci. (Palermo), II, no. 9, 1 Sett., 1814, 

p. 66 (type C. nasuta= Testudo caretta). 
1836. TlmldssoclLelys Fitzinger, Ann. Wien Mus., I, 1835, p. 121, (type Testudo 

caouana = T. caretta ) . 
1838. Caouana Cocteau, in Sagra's Hist. Fis. Pol. Nat. Cuba, IV, Kept., p. 31 

(type Chelonia cephalo—T. caretta). 

The generic name Caretta is usually credited to Merrem, 1820, and 
because Ritgen in 1828 limited it to C. imhrlcata it has often been 
given the precedence over Eretmochelys of Fitzinger. This is a 
mistake, however, for Rafinesque, as early as 1814, not only estab- 
lished the generic term, but limited it to the species he called C. 
Quisiita^ which is nothing but the Testudo caretta of Linna?us, the 
Atlantic Loggerhead. 

«The name Caret (New Latin Caretta) according to Lac^pede is the one by which 
the hawksbill turtle is generally known in the countries it inhabits. The derivation 
from cara, face, is doubtful. Carey is Spanish for tortoise shell.

The Loggerhead turtle is readily distinguished from the other 
marine turtles by having live pairs of costal shields, while the other 
two species with horny covering have only four pairs. The additional 
pair is situated' in front of the others, in contact with the first verte- 
bral. No Porto Rican specimen being at hand, a .voting one from 
Florida is figured herewith, so as to help in identifying specimens. 

This species is included in the Porto Rican fauna on the strength of 
Dr. StahPs testimony. It is probably not rare, but being of no com- 
mercial value it attracts no attention.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 



The gTocTi turtle is easily distinguished from the other Porto -Rican 
marine turtles Ijy the single pair of elongated prefrontal shields on 
top of the snout. The shell alone can be recognized by having only 
four costal shields and by the shields not overlapping- posteriorly. 
The loggerhead {Caretta carettdt) has live costal shields, while the 
hawksbill {Eretrnochelys inihrleata) has overlapping shields (tig. 193). 

None of our expeditions to Porto Rico brought back an}^ specimens 
of the green turtle, but its occurrence in the waters surrounding the

island is well known. Dr. 15. W. Evermann, in his general report on 
the investigations in Porto Rico of the United States Fish Commis- 
sion steamer FisJi llawl' in 1899, writes that it is rare except at the 
east end of the island, and he accounts for the scarcity of turtles by 
the absence of largo areas of shallow water with sandy bottom.

The hawksbill, which furnishes the valuable "tortoise shell," is 
superlicially characterized hy the horny plates on its back overlapping 
with their posterior borders after the fashion of fisli scales or shingles. 
The accompan^ying- ilhistrations (tigs. 11K5-19T), which are from a Porto 
Rican specimen less than half grown, give a fair idea of the external 
characters by which this species is distinguished from the other marine 
turtles frequenting the same waters. 

The U. S. Fish Connnission J^ls/i Hawk expedition brought home 
several young specimens from Mayaguez, but Professor Evermann 
writes that this species, like the green turtle, is rare except at the 
eastern end of the island.

INTRODUCTION. 

The Klamath Indians now live upon a resei'vation in the State of 
Oregon, which lies within a somewhat larger area occupied by them 
long before their discovery ])y the white race. The I'eservation is in 
the southwestern corner of the plateau of eastern Oregon, at the east- 
ern foot of the Cascade Mountains and near the southern border of 
the State. The rainfall of the region averages only about ^0 inches 
a year, the greater portion of the moisture that comes from the Pacific 
Ocean having been precipitated in passing over the Cascade Moun- 
tains. Most of the Klamath Plateau is covered b}^ forests of yellow 
pine {Pi/n/x j>(>/t(P/'<>s(f)^ but tow^ard the east and toward the south are 
tongues of treeless sagebrush country {AiiciiiJsia fi'ldtntafa and other 
species of the same genus) which extend along the valleys into the tim- 
ber from the sage plains of eastern Oregon and northeastern California, 
while about the lakes and marshes mentioned l)elow are several large 
areas, originally lake deposits, which are now raised a))ove the surface 
of the water and are covered with gi-ass, but which are still too wet to 
have acquii'ed a co^'ering of timber. That portion of the Cascade Moun- 
tains opposite the Klamath Reservation is made up largely of volcanic 
rock, covered by a layer of })umice gravel and dust. With such a por- 
ous soil the heavy precipitation in the mountains is not carried off by 
surface streams, but sinks into the ground and appears upon the plain 
at the base of the mountains in iinuunerable large springs of very cold 
and very clear watei', which has filtered for many miles down the 
mountain slopes. As a consequence, the Klamath Plateau, although 
having a comparativeh' small rainfall, is nevertheless well watered and 
possesses some of the most beautiful streams on the continent. The 
drainage from these springs and streams produces two bodies of water, 
Klamath IVIai'sh and Klamath Lake, which furnish a wealth of game. 
The richness of xegetable life, particularly in Klamath Marsh, is no 
less remarkable than that of the animal life, and the latter is in fact 

727 



728 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

dependent upon the former, for the l)ird,s feed upon the seeds and 
starchy roots of the larger plants oi- upon fish or other animals that 
ultimately depend for their supply of food upon the minute alg{» with 
which the waters of the marsh and lake abound. 

One of the plants growino- al)undantly in the marsh and less exten- 
sively in some of the bays of the lake, the great ^^ellow water lily 
{Nyiii'pliaea poJy^iepala)^ was a staple farinaceous food of the Klamaths 
in primitive times and now is regarded ))y them as a delicacy (Plates 1 
and 2). An opportunity presented itself to spend a week at Klamath 
Marsh in August, lOO:^, and to see the Indians harvest their crop of 
wokas (wo'-kas)," or waterlily seed. The industry is well preserved 
in so nearl}" its primitive form that a detailed record of it has seemed 
desirable and is herewith presented. A wokas gatherer's camp is 
shown in Plate 3. 

It is estimated that Klamath Marsh contains about 10,000 acres of 
a solid growth of wokas. The plant is so vigorous and has such a 
habit of growth as usually to occupy an area suited to it to the com- 
plete exclusion of other characteristic and conspicuous marsh plants, 
such as tule and cattail. Certain plants associate themselves habitually 
with the waterlily, but tliese plants are for the most part submerged 
in the water, are inconspicuous, and subsidiary in their relationship to 
the waterlily, and in no effective or important way contest its spread. 
The principal of these latter plants are bladderwort {Utricidaria vul- 
garis)^ mare's tail {lUppurls vi/lgf/r/s)^ and pond weed {Potaiiiogeton 
natans and other species). 

HARVESTING. 

Wokas is harvested exclusively in boats of the kind known as a 
" dugout. " The dugout (wuns) is hollowed from a single log, commonly 
of the yellow pine {Pinus jponderosa)^ and ordinarily is about 18 feet 
long, 2 feet wide, and 16 inches deep (Plate 4). Sometimes logs 
of Douglas fir {Pseudotmign mucronata) are used. This tree makes a 
superior ])oat, but as the species normally grows at a higher elevation 
than the lake and marsh, it is less easily available to the boatmaker. 
The dugout is propelled usually by poling instead of paddling. The 
pole (la-gak'), made of a peeled sapling of the lodge-pole pine {Pinus 
rmiTrayanxi)^ is about 9 feet long and \\ inches thick. The lower end 
is split for a distance of about G inches, and the two split points are 
then spread abruptly to a distance of about 4 inches, where they are 
held by the insertion of a transverse brace. In all the poles seen the

in church. Secondary accents are not marked when they occur at the normal dis- 
tance of two syllal)les from a primary accent. 



WOKAS, A PRIMITIVE FOOD. 729 

brace consisted of a laro-e wire nail. The triangular base thus formed 
presents a larger surface to the mud and often permits the pole to rest 
firmly across one of the stout rootstocks of a wokas plant. Paddles 
(ka-chik') are seldom used in wokas harvesting, as the water in the 
wokas fields is rarely open, and when open is seldom too deep for the 
propulsion of the boat by poling. Within a wokas field the use of a 
paddle would be very laborious if not wholly inefl'ective, while the 
resistance offered l)y tli<^ plants in the water is readily overcome when 
the dugout is shoved ])y a pole resting on the l)ottom. In localities 
afi'ording consideral)le deep open water, paddles also are carried. The 
other necessary implements in the boat are a fiat-bottomed coarse tule 
basket (tliiks) holding about half a bushel, and a large wicker spoon 
(nap, or s(V-ot a-ko'-olks) made of tule or willow. 

When a l)oat is poled by a single occupant, she takes a position not 
in the stern, like a paddler, nor at a point a little aft of the middle, 
like an oarsman, but at a point a few feet from the bow, and for the 
most effective work she stands instead of kneeling (Plate 5). As the 
boat is poled slowly along among the wokas plants the woman stoops 
forward, and, grasping a full-grown wokas pod (ka-kar'-ga'-li), pulls 
it off' its stem and throws it into the boat. At tiiis ])oint occurs the first 
step of differentiation into grades or qualities of wokas. The pod 
when fully mature bursts open irregularly at the l)ase; the white, 
moist, but mealy interior, as soon as it is l)rought into contact with 
the water ))egins at once a mucilaginous dissolution, and the seeds are 
soon scattered in the water. The seeds contained in these dissolving 
pods are more fully matuivd, larger, whiter, more palatable, and pre- 
sumably more mitritious than those of the other pods, and consequently 
are much more prized and sought after hy the Indians. They have a 
special designation, spokwas (spok'-was), which is applied also to the 
dissolving capsule itself and to the mucilaginous mass it forms when 
gathered. Spokwas constitutes only a small part of the whole gather- 
ing of wokas, and this fact, in yicw of the great demand for seeds of 
this (juality, led to the (piestion. Why do not the women gather only the 
fully matured pods of the spokwas grade 'i This is clearly answered b}^ 
the result of a day's harvest of wokas pods. Ordinarily not more than 
10 per cent is spokwas, a proportion due to the rapid dissolution of 
the fully ripened pcxls. If the women gathered only these, their day's 
harvest would ])e very small, while by gathering the full-grown but 
still hard pods they get a several times greater product. 

The spokwas pods, in a state of mucilaginous dissolution, are lifted 
from the water not by the hand, but in the wicker spoon already men- 
tioned, and are placed in the tlaks (tlaks), or spokwas })asket. 

The wokas gatherer's day is a long and laborious one. The women 
set out at about 8 o'clock in the morning and, taking a lunch, remain 
on the water until about C) o'clock in the afternoon. They often go 



730 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

2 or 3 miles from camp. An hour or so before their arrival the 
various boats from any one camp may be seen slowly approaching 
from different directions, the boat itself usually hidden among the 
wokas leaves, its occupant seeming at a distance to glide over the 
marsh with a spectral motion, unaccompanied by any evident means 
of support or propulsion. 

A day's harvest, judging from actual measurements of several loads, 
is ordinarily 4 to 6 bushels of hard pods and a peck to half a bushel 
of spokwas. (Plate <>.) 

SPOKWAS. 

The basketful of spokwas as it is brought from the boat is emptied 
into a pit dug in the g-round for the purpose, to which each suc- 
cessive day's harvest of spokwas is added. The disintegrating pods 
undergo some process of fermentation, which changes them into a 
mucilaginous liquid mass having the texture of a thin but very 
elastic dough. The pits are commonly li to 2 feet in both diameter 
and depth. The top is covered with grass, tules, or an empt}^ grain 
sack. These holes may be found anywhere about a wokas camp, 
and from the inconspicuous character of their covering, among the 
miscellaneous furniture of an Indian's summer camp, it is altogether 
too easy to step into one. If a motto were to be suggested for visit- 
ors, it might well be: Let the stranger in a wokas camp beware of the 
spokwas hole. 

Other cases were observed in which an old dugout, a large spokwas 
basket, a grain sack, or even a wooden box was used as the fer- 
menting receptacle for spokwas. Large holes plug themselves with 
pieces of the pods and small ones are sealed by the drying of the 
mucilaginous contents. In every case the receptacle was shaded, a 
fact which, taken with the limited diameter of the receptacle or pit, 
which never exceeded 2 feet, suggested that the contents were liable, 
under adverse conditions, to overfermentation and heating. 

At the end of the period of harvesting by any individual, whether 
it is one week or live weeks, the contents of the spokwas pits are 
dipped out and placed in a dugout. Water is then poured in, the 
whole mass stirred, and the coarser portions squeezed with the hands, 
much as curdled milk is manipulated in a cheese vat. The seeds, no 
longer held in suspension in the mucilage, drop to the Itottom, and the 
floating refuse, nuicilage, and water are removed by skimming, by 
rocking the boat, and by baling. The wet seeds, with a small amount 
of mucilage and occasional small scraps of pod adhering, are scooped 
from the boat and spread on a tule mat (shtap's) in the sun to drain. 
They are then ready for manufacture into lolensh and subsequently 
into shnaps. 



WOKAS, A PRIMITIVE FOOD. 731 

LOLENSH. 

Fresh wokas seeds, in which the kernels are still moist, are in the 
condition necessary for manufacture into what is called lolensh 
(lo-lensh'). This condition exists in spokwas and in the two grades of 
seeds, nokapk and chinialvum, derived from cooked pods, or awal, 
described below. The dried seeds, h)wak and stontaldaks, can not be 
made into lolensh. 

The fresh seeds are placed in a frying' pan, one or two quarts at a 
time, and held over a lire for perhaps ten minutes, constantly stirred 
or shaken. This operation dries and partially cooks the seed, leaving 
the shell l)rittle and the kernel in a tough, elastic condition. In early 
times the cooking was done in a wicker tray with live coals, as 
described below under shiwulinz. 

The removal of the shells is accomplished by grindingthe seeds lightly 
on the ordinary mealing stone and then winnowing them. The lower 
mealing stone (Imach) is a piece of Hat lava rock commonly about a 
foot and a half in length and a))out 1<» inches in width. The upper 
stone (si-lak'-al-ish), also of lava, is nuich smaller and has usuall}' two 
ni))s upon the back which Jit into the haiul's of the user as she sits or 
kneels on the ground. The seeds to l)e gi-ound are placed, a few hand- 
f uls at a time, on the end of the lower stone next to the grinder. The 
seeds on that side of the pile farthest from her are spread out in a thin 
layer reaching to or beyond the middle of the stone. She seizes the 
upper stone in both hands and rubs it lightly over the lower and over 
the thin layer of seeds upon it. The forward stroke does the grind- 
ing, while the deft ])ackward stroke serves to catch between the stones 
a small amount of seeds from the thin edge of the pile on the lower 
stone. The product of the grinding accumulates on the end of the 
lower stone farthest from the grinder and is shoved off upon a circular 
mat or very shallow, tightly woven dish, commonly known as a wokas 
shaker, described below, upon which the end of the mealing stone has 
been placed. (Plate 7.) 

The notable feature of the grinding of these seeds is that the shells 
are cracked so that they can be removed, while the kernels, from the 
tough, elastic texture they have acquired through their partial cook- 
ing and from the lightness of stroke exercised ])y the grinder, are 
not cracked as are thoi'oughly dried or roasted seeds when similarly 
manipulated upon the mealing stone. 

The next process is that of winnowing, by which the loose pieces 
of broken seed shells are separated from the seed kernels. The imple- 
ment employed is a winnowing tray, known to the white people of the 
Klamath Lake region as a wokas shaker (p'a'-hla). This is a broad, 
circular, very shallow dish closely woven of a cord twisted from nar- 
row strips of tule stems, from the great tule marshes of the Klamath 



732 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

Lake and Marsh countrv. The wokas .shaker has eommonl}" a diam- 
eter of 22 to 30 inches, and sonietinies has some slight adornment in 
figures lighter or darker than the main body of the shaker, Ordi- 
naril}'^, Indian winnowing trays are of rigid construction, but the 
wokas shaker, which is the general winnowing implement used b}^ the 
Klamath s and Modocs for the preparation of a wide variety of seed 
foods, is flexible, a characteristic which giyes it a more yaried useful- 
ness than an ordinary stitt' tra3\ 

Al)Out a quart of the seeds, after cracking on a mealing stone, as 
already described, is placed on the shaker. This is seized ])y the oper- 
ator in ])oth hands, at opposite points of the margin, each hand, palm 
upward, grasping from beneath a radial fold in the margin, the end of 
the thuml> usually extending up over the margin and occupying the 
inside of the fold. The woman sits with her back to the wind, and, 
grasping the shaker in the manner just described, proceeds ])v a series 
of skillful movements to separate the broken shells from the rest of 
the seed. One of these movements is the rotation of the shaker back 
and forth upon its own center as an axis. This accomplishes a general 
shaking up of the contents, through which the seed shells accumulate 
at the surface, A second movement is a circular motion of the whole 
shaker, which makes the seeds travel about in it like water in an eddy, 
the shells gathering in the center. The shells are then shifted to the 
farther margin by a jerk of the shaker, when they are tossed into the 
air and are carried away either l)y the wind or, when there is no wind, 
by blowing. The broken seed shells (tsi'-hlak) thus winnowed from 
the seeds are used in dyeing, in a maimer to l)e hereafter described. 

In the stage of preparation which the}' have now reached the seeds 
are known as lolensh (Plate 12, fig, 4). This may be made inmiediately 
into parched wokas or shnaps, or it may be spread out upon a mat in 
the sunlight to dry and then stored in sacks, to be parched later as used. 

SHNAPS. 

In the preparation of shnaps from shelled wokas kernels, or lolensh, 
the primitive method of roasting with live coals in a wokas shaker, as 
described under shiwulinz, seems to have been entirely discarded. 
The frying pan is now used instead by all the Indians. A handful or 
two of lolensh, either the fresh or the dried and stored product, about 
enough to barely cover the bottom, is thrown into a hot fr3'ing pan 
and roasted briskly over a fire until it is nicely parched and slightly 
browned, the pan being shaken meanwhile to prevent scorching. The 
kernels swell, crack their coats, and roll over like animate objects, but 
do not explode like popcorn. When the parching is completed the 
grains are roughly spherical, with a tul^erculate surface (Plate 12, 
fig. 2), and the bulk of a mass of the kernels has increased two and one- 
third to three times. A thick-bottomed cast-iron frying pan is much 
better for parching wokas than a thin-bottomed one of pressed steel,

a much more even tind not extremely hioh temperature l)eing thus 
secured. 

The parched wokas, or shnaps, has a delicious flavor, somewhat 
similar to that of popcorn or, more especially, parched corn. When 
freshly parched it is more crisp and appetizing-, and doubtless more 
fully dig-esti])lc, than after it has Ix^en allowed to stand in a humid 
atmosphere and absorl) moisture. 

Shnaps is often eaten dry, and in this state it is most palatal)le to 
white people, but ordinarily the Indian places it in a dish and pours 
over it ])arely enough cold water to cover it. It is then eaten with a 
spoon, with or without salt, a modern innovation. Sometimes the 
shnaps is linely ground before the addition of the water, and the pre- 
paration is then known as shlotish (shlo-tish'). In primitive times 
the Klamaths used for eating wokas a spoon cut from the breast bone 
of the swan, which is conveniently shaped for the Durpose. Their 
name for such a spoon is siro-ko)>h'. 

LOWAK. 

The nearly mature ]>ut still hard wokas pods that makt^ up the prin- 
cipal part of a day's harvest are ordinarily spread upon the ground to 
dry, in flat-topped piles a1)out S inches thick (Plate S). Each day 
the margin of the pile is added to as new pods are brought in from 
the marsh. The l)right sunshine prevalent at tiie time <^f the wokas 
harvest hastens the drying, thick and mucihiginous as the i)ods are, and 
in from one to two weeks those on the surface and margins of the 
piles are thoroughly dry. The pods thus dried are phiced on a mat 
or piece of gunny sack and pounded with a stone or short pestle 
(ska). The seeds are tlioroughly dry and drop out easily, and when 
the mass is sufliciently pounded portions of it are placed on a shaker 
and the light corky or pithy pieces of the pods are winnowed out. 
Some of the women, before winnowing the seed on a shaker, separate 
the coarser pieces of waste matter ])y running- the whole mass through 
a coarse wicker sifter (ti-a'). Seeds thus prepared from dried pods 
and still covered by their shells are known as lo-wak' (Plate 12, tig. 1). 
They are commonly stored in sacks for winter use. The screenings 
(kakt-chi'-as) from lowak, thoug-h made up mostly of the light corky 
pieces of the dry body of the pods, do contain a small percentage of 
seeds. They were sometimes stored, in the old days, for use in case 
of famine. 

STONTABLAKS. 

In the preparation of lowak, the pods in the interior of the drying 
piles do not dry, but turn into a soft, moist, rotten mass (Plate 9), 
the seeds themselves, however, retaining their freshness. When the 
piles are opened the dry pods are thrown in a pile by themselves to be 
made into lowak, bat these moist, decomposing pods are diflerently 



734 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

treated and produce a superior grade of seed having- a different name, 
stontablaks (,stont"-a'-l)laks). The rotten pods, denuded of their 
covering of dry ones, are pounded to a pulpy mass with a ska. 
According to information from the Indians, the pounded pulp is fur- 
ther exposed until dr}^, and is then screened and winnowed, being thus 
left in the same form as lowak, suitable for cooking as shiwulinz, but 
not as lolensh and shnaps. 

SHIWULINZ. 

When required for cooking, the dried seeds, either lowak or stonta- 
blaks, are first roasted, shell and all, then cracked, and the shells win- 
nowed out from the T)roken seeds on a shaker. The seeds, called in 
this condition shi'-wu-linz (Plate 12, tig. 3), are then boiled, forming 
a sort of nuish to which the Indians apply the same name. 

The word is derived from shi'-wi, meaning to shake or winnow, and 
refers to the winnowing of the shells from the cracked seeds. Among 
the younger women the cracking is often done in a hand coffee mill, 
but the usual instrument is the primitive mealing stone. 

The roasting of lowak, preparator}' to the making of shiwulinz, is 
now usually done in a f lying pan, but the primitive method of roast- 
ing with live coals in a wokas shaker is still occasionally used ])y some 
of the old people. This operation, as witnessed at one of the wokas 
camps on Klamath Marsh, is conducted as follows: About 3 quarts of 
lowak were placed in a shaker and several pieces of live coal from a 
lodge pole pine tire were laid on top of the seeds. Most of the coals 
were 1 inch or less in diameter; a few were 3 or 4 inches long and 2 
or 3 inches thick. The seeds and coals were then tossed so as to roll 
over and over each other in the shaker, the contents going into the 
air from the farther margin of the shaker and falling in the middle. 
After a few minutes the coals began to cool. They were then brought 
to the top of the mass of seeds by a rotary motion, the shaker was set 
on the ground, and a little vigorous fanning with another empty shaker 
soon brought the coals to a lively heat. Then the tossing went on 
again as before until the roasting was completed. The whole process 
requires dexterity, both to keep the coals in motion so that the shaker 
will not burn and to roast the seeds evenly without scorching th(Mn. 

Another form of food prepared from lowak is named stilinsh (stil'- 
insh). This differs from shiwulinz in that the shells are not win- 
nowed out on a shaker, but are skimmed from the boiling pot while 
the seeds are cooking. The name is derived from sti-lin', to skim, a 
word now applied to various operations, from the removal of cream 
from milk to the washing of gold in a miner's pan. In earlier times a 
food named talwas (tal'-was) was prepared from lowak. This was 
essentially the same as shiwulinz and stilinsh, but the boiling was done 
in a water-tight basket into which hot stones were dropped, a method 
of cooking not practiced among the Klamaths at the present day. 



WOKAS, A PRIMITIVE FOOD. 735 



AWAL. 



When seeds are required to be extracted from freshl}" gathered 
pods, either to furnish an innnediate food supply, or to secure material 
for the preparation of shnaps, or because the wokas gatherer is near- 
ing the end of his harvest and can not wait for the pods to dry, a 
process of cooking or steaming the pods is employed which facilitates 
the extraction of the seeds. These cooked pods are known as awal 
(a'-wal). The process of making awal, as observed at one of the camps 
on the east side of the Klamath Marsh, was a follows: Two pine sticks 
about 5 feet long and 4 to 5 inches in diameter were laid parallel, 4 
feet apart, upon the ground. Upon these and at right angles to them 
are laid close together a row of cross sticks 2 to 4 inches in diameter, 
making a low platform about 4 feet square. Upon this platform was 
placed al)out 3 l)ushels of freshly gathered wokas pods, forming a low 
pyramidal pile about a foot deep in the middle (Plate 10). The space 
between the cross sticks and the ground was stuffed looselv with dry 
needles of the yellow pine {Plnus ponde7'(>sa) , which were then lighted. 
A dense column of smoke rose high in the air, for awal is made only 
on calm da3^s, The cross sticks soon ignited, and the blaze reached 
through the cracks to the wokas pods. In ten minutes the lowermost 
and outermost pods, sizzing and singing from the steam generated in 
them, were considered sufficiently cooked. The cross sticks were 
spread open a little and the cooked pods fell through to the ground, 
making room for the spreading out of the raw ones from the upper 
part of the pile. After five minutes more some of the burning cross 
sticks were pried upward through the steaming pods and left still 
burning on the top. Pods with their surface blackened ]»y the fire 
were left upon the ground, but any green ones that fell off were 
thrown back again. In ten minutes more all the cross sticks had been 
brought to the top of the pile of pods and were roasting them from 
above. The Indian woman who was conducting the operation poked 
continuously ai'ound the margin with a pole to get the cooked pods 
out, occasionally removing one of the charred hot sticks, imtil at the 
end of an hour from the time of lighting all the sticks had been 
removed and the cooking- was completed. 

The awal is separated after cooking into two grades, based on the 
degree of maturity of the seeds. The better one (no'-kapk) makes 
up ordinarily much the larger part of the awal, while the poorer grade 
(chin-i'-a-kum) consists of the smaller and more shriveled pods. In 
separating the two the woman tosses the large plump pods directly 
into the nokapk pile, but coming occasionally to a doubtful one she 
breaks it open, and from the appearance of the seeds themselves 
decides into which pile to put it. 



736 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. 

DIACHAS. 

In wokas pods properly roasted as awal the interior tissues are in the 
condition of a mucilao'inoiis paste. The seeds do not separate from 
this paste as readily as they do from the mucilage in pods of the spok- 
was grade, and therefore the Indian has invented another method of 
extracting- them. This method is known as diachas (di-a"-chas'). 
About a peck of awal, of either the nokapk or the chiniakum grade, is 
placed upon a sack or upon a hard smooth area of bare ground and 
pounded with a small stone (ska) into a gluey mass. To this is added 
about half the (piautity of dr}^ rotten wood (mu-lo') of a sort that is easily 
crumbled into dust. This is pounded and rubbed into the mass of 
pounded pods (Plate 11). Finely pulverized charcoal or ashes is often 
substituted for the rotten wood when the latter is not readily obtainable. 
After the manipulation is sufficient to take up the moisture and leave 
the surface of the seed dry and free al)out three quarts of the mixture 
is usually placed in a wicker screening basket (ti-a') and the empty 
capsule skins screened out, the liner matter falling through into a wokas 
shaker. Sometimes a screen is not used. The material in such case 
is placed directly in a shaker, and the skins, after being brought to the 
top by rotating, are shoved off. The winnowing of the seeds, as in the 
preparation of lowak, follows, and the seeds are then made into lolensh 
by the process already descrilied. 

THE GRADES OF WOKAS. 

Inquiry among the Indians as to the relative quality of the different 
kinds of wokas, irrespective of the method of cooking, but on the basis 
of what in the grain trade would be called grade, elicited replies show- 
ing the following order: (1) Spokwas, (2) stontablaks, (3) lowak, 
(4) nokapk, (5) chiniakum. 

The significance of this arrangement of grades by the Indians lies in 
the fact that the sequence they gave represents exactly the relative 
degree of maturity of the seeds. In chiniakum and nokapk the seeds 
in the still green pods are roasted at once, usually on the da}' after 
they are gathered, and of these two grades the one called chiniakum 
is visibly the less fully developed. In lowak the seeds have several 
days longer to grow, since between the time when the pods are spread 
out in the drying piles and the time when they actually become dry 
the seeds are undoubtedly making considerable progress toward matur- 
ity. The stontablaks, lying in the center of the drying piles, and 
therefore remaining moist for a longer time than the pods on the sur- 
faces of the piles, have a still further opportunity for the development 
of their seeds, and in spokwas the seeds are of course fully matured 
when they are gathered. 



WOKAy, A PRIMITIVE FOOD. 737 

TSIHLAK. 

Ill the preparation of lolensh and of .sliiwulinz the broken seed sliells 
(tsi'-hlak) are winnowed, as already described, from the seed kernels. 
These seed shells or hulls are not always thrown away, hut they are 
often saved for a later curious use. In the manufacture of their 
finer baskets and trays the Klamaths use for both w^arp and weft cords 
twisted from the split outer surface of the tule {Scirpus lacuatrls). 
Ui)on the main Ijody of the basket as woven from these cords are over- 
laid various designs in white, black, yellow, and maroon. The patterns 
in 1)lack are made from the same material as the l)ody of the l)askets, 
split tule stems, which have l^een colored by a certain dyeing- process. 
Ordinarily this is accomplished by immersing the tule stems in the 
black mud of sluggish si)rings containing iron. A superior color, 
however, is obtained ]>y the addition of a (piantity of wokas hidls, 
which contain a large amount of tannin. The same result is now fre- 
quently secured among these Indians by prolonged soaking of the tide 
stems in an iron kettle, in water containing a lil)eral amount of the 
hulls. The color is evidently due to the development of tannate of 
iron. Samples of the wokas hulls analyzed through the courtesy of 
Dr. H. W. Wiley, Chief Chemist of the Department of Agriculture, 
were found to contain 20 per cent of tannin. 

WOKAS AS AN ARTICLE OF COMMERCE. 

Wokas, when freshly parched so as to l»e nicely browned, is a deli- 
cious food, particularly if slightly salted and eaten w' ith cream. There 
is every reason to believe that wokas could be brought into successful 
use as a breakfast food. Small quantities of it can l)e purchased from 
the Indians, but only at a price of from 10 to 20 cents a pound. It is 
evident that in order to enter into successful competition with 
other breakfast foods economical machine methods must be devised 
for extracting- the seeds from the pods and putting them through the 
processes necessary to bring' them to the lolensh stage, which is the 
best form for shipment. The primitive methods at present employed 
by the Indians are altogether too expensive. Some of the various 
means now used by seedsmen, cofl'ee dealers, and millers for macerat- 
ing, roasting", milling, and cleaning seeds are undoubtedly applicable, 
with some modifications, to the production of wokas. 

The writer does not consider the cultivation of the wokas plant 
on a commercial scale to be feasible. The available supply of the 
seeds nuist be limited to the natural product, which in the Klamath 
country is estimated at a])out lo,oOO acres. Other, but, so far as 
known, smaller areas of the plant exist on the Northwest Coast. There 
seems to be no probability that the pods can be harvested by any other

method than that now practiced by the Indians — hand picking- from 
boats. It should he possible to secure the pods in this wa}^ at 10 cents 
a bushel, a bushel of the pods producing about one-fourth its bulk of 
seed, and the seeds about one-third their bulk of lolensh. The weight 
of lolensh to the measured l)ushel is about 59 pounds. When parched 
the lolensh expands to nearly three times its original bulk, a sample 
of the best shnaps weighing about 21 pounds per bushel. The sea- 
son of harvesting in the Klamath country is about six weeks — from 
the middle of August to the end of September. For an illustration of 
a wokas camp at the close of the season see Plate 13.
